8092963,4,B000BUU7GQ,I was very happy with this movie. Good plot and a twist at the end. I admit I only bought it be use Kim Coates was in it. And he is actually in it to the end. But I liked it enough that I have watched it several times. If you are a Kim Coates fan you should get it.,1480896000,,265,3.433333333333333
