8355067,4,B0027PIA6M,"Let's see now, how should I word this. When the show first comes on with the opening title sequence you just about jump out of your seat. The way in which it is done is quite well and David McCallum does a good job as narrator. If you like being scared about the future then this video is for you. I wish it were available in dvd format.  However, although some things have come to pass many have not and it is past time for them to come to pass according to the video so they are not correct on some of the predictions but that is actually a GOOD THING if you know what I mean. There are three more in the series: Ancient Prophecies II, Ancient Prophecies III, and Ancient Prophecies IV, and yes David McCallum narrates them too. Ancient Prophecies II (Countdown to Doomsday), Ancient Prophecies III (Visions of the Future), and Ancient Prophecies IV (Final Visions) have the same hallmark of the first and are well done.  I haven't seen the fourth one listed on Amazon recently.  However, in the fourth one there is something shown about three quarters of the way through it with the late Walton McCarthy (Radius-Defense)that many people would be interested in that the powerful people in Washington,D.C. do not want any one to see.  This portion is about a secret underground bunker which is made by his company that many in Washington have purchased to be buried underground on their hidden properties. These same bunkers are available for sale to the general public but those in power do not want us to know about. His former company is now located in Texas.
If you are an avid Nostradamus, Edgar Cayce, Paul Solomon fan or believe wholeheartedly in the book of Daniel, Isaiah, and Book of Revelations, the Torah, Zohar, and Kaballah, this set is for you. If you think things are bad now just wait until Nuclear Armageddon. Be prepared to buy survival food or write your will.",1276387200,8,1881,4.572700296735905
