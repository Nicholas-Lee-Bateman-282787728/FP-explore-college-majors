4435749,5,B004NEUXPQ,"I am a great fan of all three leading actors in this movie, and they all deliver marvelous performances, great wardrobe and a romantic fantasty designed to make any theatre lover's heart beat faster.  Vera Ellen is her usual beautiful, graceful dancing self--David Niven exhibits his urbane, suave, sophisticated and wonderful comic timing. Cesar Romero is over the top!  If you love the golden age of movie  musicals as much as I do, you'll love ""Happy Go Lovely.""",1370563200,,465,4.935897435897436

4435751,4,B004NEUXPQ,"Vera Ellen falls in love with David Niven.  She thinks he is a local newspaper reporter, but he is actually a millionaire.  Not an original plot, but the setting is unique.  She is part of a musical being staged by Cesar Romero for the Edinburgh Festival in Scotland.  The production is out of money and the creditors keep threatening to take away the sets.  Cesar Romero's acting never moves beyond frantic yelling and running around.  The musical numbers are a little ""odd.""  The first one is probably offensive to natives of Scotland.  Another one has a singer in blackface.  David Niven is terrifically funny and able to use his trademark smirk to full advantage.  Vera Ellen dances up a storm.  Fun to watch.",1367625600,2,713,4.715447154471545
4435752,3,B004NEUXPQ,Always love David Niven and he plays his role well.  Music not very memorable. An fun diversion if not totally satisfying.,1365033600,,122,4.809523809523809

4435754,5,B004NEUXPQ,"Happy Go Lovely (1951) is a British/American co-production featuring the lovely Vera Ellen in a frothy romantic musical comedy opposite the urbane and very charming David Niven. The film was shot in Technicolor by director Bruce ""Lucky"" Humberstone, who was a sure hand with creampuff comedies such as this one.

Vera Ellen plays a chorine who is catapulted from obscurity to stardom when she accidentally hitches a ride to work one day in a millionaire's limousine, which causes everyone to believe that she is the millionaire's mistress. The improbable consequences of this vaguely titillating premise make for a delicious bubble bath of mindless romantic escapism, enlivened by Mischa Spoliansky's upbeat music. Cesar Romero and Diane Hart provide excellent support as Vera Ellen's Director and Best Friend, respectively.

Look for Gordon Jackson (Mr. Hudson of Upstairs Downstairs fame) in a minor early role.

I love to watch this movie when I'm feeling blue; it always lifts my spirits! This movie is not a work of genius, but it is a sprightly piece of well-crafted silliness and holds up very well on repeated viewings. If you enjoy David Niven, you'll love this film as it provides Niven with one of his most engaging roles as the uptight millionaire whose life is transformed when Vera Ellen mistakes him for a newspaper reporter. And I love Vera Ellen, who is delightful in this movie... especially while dancing, when she is often quite radiant. Most of the musical numbers are enjoyable if somewhat forgettable except for the jazz ballet finale, which is very good.

When you're sick of edginess and cynicism and are craving some old-fashioned light-hearted entertainment, give this movie a try.",1361664000,8,1708,5.133093525179856

4435759,4,B004NEUXPQ,"For some reason I had never heard of this film, so I assumed it must have been one of the less-than-stellar films cranked out during the old studio contract days. Never assume! I believe it was actually a British-made film and it was a delight! Vera-Ellen's dancing is always lovely and a pleasure to watch, but the entire cast absolutely clicked, making this movie so funny, entertaining and a new-found treasure. There is one dance number that pairs Vera-Ellen with a couple of creepy-looking dance partners, in my opinion, but that is a minor complaint. It's a new favorite for me.",1475020800,,584,4.792079207920792
4435760,5,B004NEUXPQ,"This is a really charming and sweet British romantic, musical comedy! I enjoyed the performances of Vera Ellen and David Niven. I thought that the plot was interesting as it moved along with Vera keeping up the pretence of not knowing people were mistaking her for David Nivens fianc&eacute;e. Lots of lively music, twists and turns in the story line make this a timeless class to be watched over and over again!

I'd say that the movie is enjoyable to see on a snowy evening and you see some famous names in their prime.  However, there are much better movies available to be seen.",1454112000,,528,4.645161290322581

There was nothing spectacular in the music and dance routines, but Vera-Ellen naturally did a good job with what she was given in this post ""On the Town"" musical.

4435798,3,B004NEUXPQ,"Vera-Ellen (of White Christmas fame, where she played Judy Haynes) stars in this fairly predictable story of chorus-girl-makes-good.  Set in Scotland (which required a fair number of Americans to fake a Scottish accent), the story line involves a mistaken assumption in which Janet Jones (Vera-Ellen) is thought to be engaged to B. G. Bruno (played with his usual panache by David Niven), a wealthy Scottish greeting card magnet.  Lots of comical mishaps and situations, with the a happy ending you can see coming from a mile away.  Vera-Ellen's gams never fail to amaze, but her dancing is a sideline to the main story line -- she's a girl in the chorus who happens to dance.  Never the less, Happy Go Lovely is a nice enough way to spend an evening with a comfortable story line that leaves you with a comfortable smile on your face.",1433721600,,835,4.7379310344827585

4435812,5,B004NEUXPQ,"One of the best movies ever made, but you might have to be a scholar of Shakespeare to get it in its full content.
It starts with a clash of cultures, and it ends with a one word response that tells the heroine with whom she is in love.
In between you get Anglo-American relations told mostly in untruths and few words; for instance, Mae's classic untruthful retort,
""Charmingly put."" in response to a boorish invitation to dinner.

There is a sad prognosis to the fairy tale ending.  Any guy, with a past and future of his own, who ties himself to a budding superstar of stage and screen, has a tiger by the tail.  One answer is told in another Vera-Ellen movie, ""Three Little Words"", where she gives up her career for him.  I wonder if there is a movie around where the hero successfully gives up his career for her, and remains happy about it?",1417219200,,846,4.369426751592357

Vera Ellen struggles at first,  but a reliable performance from David Niven saves the day.",1484006400,,270,4.428571428571429
