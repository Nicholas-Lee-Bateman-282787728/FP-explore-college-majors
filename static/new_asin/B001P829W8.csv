3742172,5,B001P829W8,This is a disturbing portrait of a married man stuggling with his sexuality - it challenges all of us to question the meaning of the word 'forgivess'.,1239926400,2,150,4.592592592592593
3742173,5,B001P829W8,"I really enjoyed the DVD about Ted Haggard. I was heart broken that his church and denomination turned their back on him. I am deeply saddened that he has to deny who God made him to be all for the sake of pleasing ""society."" It was so sad that he had to be who he was in secret and not openly and still serve God.  I also feel sorry for his wife who one day may be devastated when he finally comes to the realization that he too was made in the image of God who created him gay, and he ends up possibly leaving her. I will continue to pray for him and his family.",1237334400,,564,3.8620689655172415
3742174,5,B001P829W8,"This documentary actually brought me to tears.  It was well done and emotionally riveting.  I saw an extremely well meaning man living a public life and living in the shadows with a secret that, if found out, would ruin just about everything he had worked for in his life.  Before seeing this documentary I really didn't care much about Ted Haggard's trials and tribulations.  Being a supporter of Gay & Lesbian Rights (as I am a supporter of all equal human and animal rights) I had been appalled by what I saw as a two-faced fraud doing a lot of harm to a group of people who had never done him any harm.  After seeing the documentary, I walked away with a huge dose of respect for him for picking himself up and trying to find his place in life and for his family for sticking by his side when all of his ""so-called"" friends and Christian community wouldn't.

I'm not sure why Ms. Pelosi decided to do this documentary, but I'm glad she did.  It was pure, honest and sincere.  I loved it.",1235520000,15,991,4.3478260869565215
3742185,3,B001P829W8,"Interesting documentary about the fall from grace for Ted Haggard.  In one way I can't help but feel like he got what he deserved, but in another I feel like his lack of truthfulness was probably just a survival mechanism that we gays learn early in life.  Anyway, it is a well-done documentary.",1447113600,,295,4.547169811320755
3742186,4,B001P829W8,"As a pastor of a small church, I was intrigued by this film. Good insight into the temptations large church pastors face. The afterstory is that Haggard has started a new church. I'm not sure that's a good idea.",1441584000,,211,4.435897435897436

Ted Haggard was the only pastor who I know who has allowed the cameras into his life after the sex scandal.  This video was a real eye opener to teach us of the pains we WILL experience when we call ourselves ""Children of God"" and live a worldly life filled with the pleasures of sin.  Wow, sad how we'll risk everything in life to have pleasure for only a season.  Great documentary.",1389225600,,572,4.126126126126126
3742193,4,B001P829W8,"It is hard, as an atheist, not to delight in the fall of such a powerful voice of non-reason. But that delight quickly vanished when I started watching as a human being.

3742194,3,B001P829W8,"So the 3 stars is only because in the end, it's an interesting documentary.  If the movie was bad i'd give this whole thing zero stars, but it's good so I can't.

The problem is the packaging/selling.  It's about $20 after shipping, but it's only a FORTY FIVE MINUTE MOVIE. I dunno about you, but if it's half a movie I expect to pay half the price.

Also, it's not even a legit DVD press from a factory. It's a burned DVD by amazon with the purple bottom, not silver.  You could literally do the same thing at your house with the torrent and a blank DVD and it'd be NO different.

So until amazon gets it together, I can't recommend you buy it at this price...",1284681600,3,661,4.165354330708661
3742205,5,B001P829W8,"Ted Haggard didn't make an extraordinary amount of money off of the people from the church that he founded. During his ministry he thought that his homosexual feelings were wrong and struggled with them and lost. He still reads the Bible and expects it's principles to work. He did deceive his congregation about his homosexual tendencies because he knew the judgmental type of people that he surrounded himself with and ministered to. He wasn't a con artist...he was a disillusioned man! I know that he shouldn't be guiding people anymore, but as a human being with only a bible degree, a fallen reputation and living in a poor economy...he can't get a job! The Christians he knew wouldn't lend him the cloak off their backs or feed him their leftover table scraps. Maybe they didn't know that the outcasts were the very people Jesus had compassion for. After the priests and the Levites pass by, he did get help from people he didn't know. It's just another of the many instances of Christians behaving badly. But, isn't this pretty much what we've come to expect? I give this documentary 5 stars for accuracy.",1284076800,6,1112,4.766839378238342

Jesus suffered on the cross and your DVD's imagery is blasphemous at best.  It's disgusting to think that you're comparing Jesus dying for our since to the problems you AND YOU ALONE created through your denial, deceit, deception, and arrogance.",1275350400,,419,5.028985507246377
3742208,3,B001P829W8,I found this to be good.  I read his wife's book and had a lot of mixed feelings.  I just can't understand why people who claim to ge Christian treat a fellow person the way they did to Ted and his family.,1272240000,,205,3.857142857142857
3742209,5,B001P829W8,"Like a couple of other reviwers, I did not like Ted Haggard and the other so-called evangelicals. As a Libertarian I feel the Religous Right is a threat to freedom in America. After seeing Pastor Ted in the excellent ""Jesus Camp"" my contempt grew. So, naturally, when he was caught in a homosexual liaison including drug use, I found it laughable. Another Religous Right icon goes down. However, after watching this documentary, my feelings completely changed. Please understand, now that Pastor Ted has been exposed, he deserves some amount of critizism for his previous anti-gay doctrine. He was hypocritical and knows it. However, he is not alone. Most people, religous or not, have skeletons in their closet and, in life, we all, at some point, play the hypocrite. Life, by its very nature, is contradictory and is defined by change. While I am not a christian or religous, when I finished watching The Trials of Ted Haggard I felt what can be described as christian compassion. I never thought that someone like Pastor Ted would open the window to his life after such a humiliating downfall. This, to me, is a sign of character. Most so-called conservatives when confronting open secrets will deny, deny, deny (think of Sen. Craig). Pastor Ted opens to the cameras his new life and all its trails, ups and downs. I was shocked. Here is a man shunned by his community, living in hotels, and trying to find gainful employment to support his family. His openness about his feelings about everything that happened is quite moving. You will not be disappointed with this documentary. While I believe there still is some contradiction in how Pastor Ted views his homosexuality even now, as I stated earlier, that's life. I believe this documentary will suprise a lot of people. I hope we will remember, if there is indeed a god, that we all fall short of the glory of God and that those confessing to truly love and follow the teachings of the man known as Jesus of Nazareth, will remember the essence of christian love and for whom the man gave his life. Thank you.",1270598400,31,2065,4.754874651810585
3742210,4,B001P829W8,"Alexandra Pelosi is a good, if not great, documentary maker...if for no other reason than she does make efforts to portray without an obvious agenda.  I never got the thought that Pelosi was trying to make any obvious statement about Ted, and for that I'm glad she's making documentaries.  The reason I gave it 4 stars was simply for the quality of the film and assembly of the video.  It's objective enough that it's somewhat slow and boring at times...but I my propaganda detector never pinged higher than 30% from Pelosi.

BUT,

This video shows a side of Ted Haggard that he should have never let out.  If there was ever any confusion about his orthodoxy, or lack thereof, this video gives some pretty clear quotations from Haggard's own mouth that are horribly damning.  For those of us Evangelicals (with whom Haggard lumps himself) who have a biblical understanding of sin, repentence, the holiness of God, the noetic effects of sin, etc., it's saddening to see things like Haggard going to take Psych classes at U of Phoenix.  When asked why, Haggard answers:

""Well, because after my crisis, it was the, the therapists were the ones that gave me answers...and I thought to myself, okay so, all these years I've thought I was a dog and worthless and an awful person, and then I sat down and talked with some experienced therapists and they're able to say `Oh, we can help walk you through that', and so I'm thinking to myself `I want to be able to help people like that'.""

So Haggard felt guilty over his unconfessed, premeditated, habitual sin for decades, went to a secular therapist, learned *something* that 'helped' him, and now wants to be able to help poeple like that (which he admits he could never do).

Then, later on, he says:

""I'm not mentally ill, however, I did have some things in my mind from childhood that were extremely powerful, now I've learned, and, uh, and then I chose to... well I don't know about that `cause I've warred against it...but now I know I'm healthy enough, I can make a choice about those types of things and...I'm fine.  That's no excuse, I'm guilty.  I was doing things, I'm a sinner.  I was doing things contrary to what the bible teaches and what I believe.  I'd still rather be the way I am now, though, and broke, and a man of dis-repute, than the way I was and have that horrific internal struggle that I had.""

So Haggard learned that he was sinning because of ""things in my mind from childhood"" and now he's ""healthy enough"" to ""make a choice about those types of things"".  He's ""cured""?  Cured of what?  Cured of sin and sanctified by his therapist?

Sorry Ted.  You've moved from one deception to another.  Sanctification isn't by your therapist, and sin can't be cured by self-realizations.

Then, He admits it's not an excuse but he thinks he was ""doing things contrary to what the bible teaches and what I believe"".

Oh dear.  He was doing things contrary to the bible and his beliefs?

Sorry folks.  That's not sin.  Sin isn't 'not keeping the rules' or 'not doing what you think is right'.

He goes and says:

""(the thing that) I lay up at night in angst over is that I've lost so many friends because of my betrayal of them.""

and:

""The church chose not to forgive me but instead to exile me...""

Well, if you don't think sin is a direct affront to God himself, then you'll only be worried about not 'keeping the rules' and mad when people don't treat you the way you feel you should be treated.  Sin is first and foremost against God, and God should be foremost on the repentant mind...not loss of friends or a lack of forgiveness you feel your owed.

In the whole video, I never see Ted connecting his sin with God, or repenting as opposed to simply feeling miserable and complaining about life being so hard.

I know plenty of pastors who've struggled with sin for years and were overcome with joy when they were found out; they were publically repentant (which is different than apologetic) and restored to God and right standing with Christ.  They lost their ministries (which they should lose), but they were restored with their Lord and saved from God's wrath by his grace in their hearts and lives.

Ted should be overwhelmed with a sense of relief that he was found out.  He should be embracing repentance and proclaiming Christ, not whining about how miserable he is selling insurance and being poor/maligned.  His 'recovery' seems to be as self-centered as his choices that led him there.",1266883200,4,4466,4.60253164556962

You can not blame the film for not including your side of the story if you hid it until now. If you felt so strongly about this, you should not have waited all these years, until Pastor Ted was on Oprah and Larry King, to come out with your allegations. Maybe next time you will answer the phone when the filmmaker calls!",1249776000,,496,4.231578947368421
