2327605,5,B0009WIDX0,"This is a joy. Yes, there is an element of slapstick but the cast are so obviously enjoying themselves in what is a superb performance. The music is attractive end tuneful and the second act, when Comte Ory's band of rogues inveigle their way into the castle dressed as nuns,is riotous - particularly after they have raided the castles's cellars!
I'm not aware the there is a disc of another performance and I am so pleased that this has come my way! Elizabeth Thompson

2327606,3,B0009WIDX0,"Rossini's opera might well have been a knee-slapper at its first performances, but this kind of vaudeville seems quaint today.  If you can bring a loose, indulgent attitude to the work, it is pleasantly amusing.  This production probably does the piece as well as it deserves.  Musically, of course, Rossini recycles much of the music of an opera he had written that he was convinced would never circulate (The Trip to Reins) with great skill; it is here very well performed.",1236988800,6,475,4.839506172839506
2327607,4,B0009WIDX0,"I am not quite sure about this opera buffa, it is well sung and recorded, but I still do not know Rossini's intention. I have to hear it again to form an intelligent opinion",1219536000,,173,4.117647058823529
2327608,5,B0009WIDX0,"What more can I say?  This performance is delightful from start to finish.  The score sparkles under Jerome Savary's direction and the production has a storybook charm about it.  The singers appear to be having as much fun as the audience with this operatic piece of fluff.  Marc Laho is very funny in the title role, and Annick Massis is perfect as the Countess Adele.  Diana Montague seems to have had an especial affinity for the role of Isolier.  (She also recorded the part for Philips, and I remember seeing her in the role in Rome several years ago.  This film dates from 1997.)  I shouldn't miss mentioning that Jerome Robbins is excellent as the Governor.  Highly recommended for an evening's entertainment!",1173484800,9,716,4.80327868852459
2327609,5,B0009WIDX0,"All the more reason to enjoy it! Goofy as the story seems, and gaudy as the costumes are, the music is profoundly crafted and polished in tehniques of composition, and the singing on this disk is superb. Other tha Mozart, no composer of comic opera comes close to Rossini's brilliance in combining sophisticated music with witty fluff on stage.",1161561600,16,344,4.8474576271186445

2327611,5,B0009WIDX0,"Given the infrequency of productions of Rossini's ""Le Comte Ory,"" this DVD performance from the 1997 Glyndebourne Festival production is an absolute must-see for both veteran ""Ory"" fans and newcomers alike. Happily, the performance of this infectiously delightful opera is completely entertaining, few quibbles aside.

Count Ory, like Mozart's ""Don Giovanni,"" is a sex addict on the loose, prowling about the countryside for women. But any darker shades you might find in Mozart are absent in Rossini's bright and bubbling score. Disguised as a religious hermit/spiritual counselor, Ory sets his sites on the beautiful but chaste and unwed Countess Adele. Along the way he settles for an appetizer or two. The women, you see, are all alone and unprotected because their men are off to fight the Crusades.

Ory's page, Isolier, has similar designs on Adele. By the second act, both Isolier and Ory, this time disguised as a nun, get a go for Adele's bed. But the Crusaders return in the nick of time; Ory takes flight; Isolier wins the Countess's hand.

Tenor Marc Laho is a smiling, ingenuous, but persistent Ory, a lovable character with expressive eyes. The terrors of Rossini's high tessitura don't daunt Laho, though I'd prefer a more focused top in the voice. But Annick Massis, the Countess Adele, is phenomenal!  She sails through the role with a bright, attractive, and accurate soprano. I found myself very drawn by her graceful moves on stage. Mezzo Diana Montague is a trim and expressive Isolier. The grand trio at the end of Act II is heavenly, especially the contributions of Massis and Montague.

Julien Robbins sings a stolid Governor and Jane Schaulis is a comic Ragonde. Andrew Davis conducts.

Jerome Savary's direction is fluid, keeping one's attention through Rossini's repetitions. Though some silly moments, thankfully, there is a minimum of distracting stage business; the bit of Glyndebourne picnickers wandering onto the stage brings a good laugh. Ezio Toffolutti's production is tastefully hued in the color of medieval tapestries. It has many nice touches, such as the rain falling during the storm at night or the languid, steamy baths in the beginning of Act II. This is a production you will actually want to watch again, let along listen to over and over!

My love for Rossini's ""Le Comte Ory"" was based only on the three commercial recordings. How wonderful to have the visuals in my mind's eye fulfilled by this video! If you don't already know the opera, you're in for a treat.",1130889600,50,2512,5.024038461538462
2327612,5,B0009WIDX0,"Excellent cast,Diana Montague in the trouser role sang and acted with her usual brilliance. All the other singers were in great voice .  Thought that the mens' role descended to farce at times but on the whole a very enjoyable experience. For sheer entertainment thoroughly reccomended.",1129852800,11,286,5.217391304347826
2327613,5,B0009WIDX0,"Rossini composed the opra comique Le Comte Ory in 1828 for the Opera of Paris. Eugne Scribe and Charles-Gaspard Delestre-Poirson wrote the French libretto. Part of the music Rossini borrowed from his opera Il viaggio a Reims. In fact, only one of the scenes from Act One is from completely newly composed music - all the rest is either adapted, or simply put to new words.

The new DVD is from a 1997 production of the Glyndebourn Festival. This is absolutely a charming production, a joy to look at visually. The first act settings looks like drawings taken from some children books. The costumes are colorful and beautiful. The second act happens in a large room in countess Adele house. Well designed, and the rain going on the other side of the widow is so realistic. The entire cast act impressively and there is much humor and fun with many brilliant ideas in the director work. Andrew Davis is conducting The London Philharmonic and everything moves well with energy and drive. The music is absolutely charming and bubbles like champagne.

As for the singers: most impressive of all is the French soprano Annick Massis. This lady is AMAZING!!! : A beautiful soprano, not even a pinch of shrillness, excellent technique and brilliant coloratura. In the first act, she finishes her aria with a long sustained note and then faints. I almost fainted too... The other women in the cast are excellent too. Isolier is sung by mezzo-soprano Diana Montague. She is a well-known singer from numerous recordings, and she is charming both in singing and acting. So is the other mezzo, Jane Shaulis as the countess companion Ragonde.

The leading role is sung by the Belgian tenor Marc Laho. He has a sweet and flexible, if not a very large voice, but it is totally appropriate for this not especially dramatic role. It is good to have so many French native speakers in the cast so pronunciation is excellent with Laho, as it is with Ory's friend Raimbaud sung here by one of the best French baritones - Ludovic Tezier. Bass Julien Robbins sings Ory's tutor. He is generally ok, even if here and there I noticed a not absolutely perfect note.

Technical quality is excellent. 136 minutes of delight and amusement.",1121731200,61,2207,4.769633507853404
8068353,1,B0009WIDX0,"Le Comte Ory is supposed to be a light, opera buffo, a comic opera. This presentation has turned it from comic to tawdry, replete with inappropriate groping, double entendres and homosexual overtones. Some of it is amazingly stupid and out of context.

 It starts out, appearing to be a traditional presentation, taking place in Catholic France, during the time of the Crusades, with the characters in appropriate costume. When Raimbaud makes his appearance, as Orys assistant, to collect the fruit and cheese offerings of the waiting maidens, he remarks that the offerings would be better rounded, if there was wine. Suddenly, we have the appearance of two adult males, in present day tuxedos, plus an adult female, in a current-era cocktail dress, one of which men is carrying a woven, wicker, picnic basket, from which Raimbaud extracts a bottle of champagne. Those cocktail party characters, then walk off stage, with no further involvement. As the rest of the women leave the area, Raimbaud starts groping them and patting their rear ends, something never in the original.

 Having the part of Isolier, Comte Orys young page, played by a female, is not unusual, since a page is, typically, a young male and there aren't a lot of very young, male, opera singers. However, when the Governor has Isolier sit on his lap, then begins to fondle Iroliers chest, as he speaks to him, there is a strong suggestion that the Governor is homosexual, since Isolier is supposed to be a young male. While the Governor receives Isoliers rebuke, in response, in the form of a strongly presented elbow to the mid-section, it is, at best tasteless.

 From there, this presentation goes downhill, RAPIDLY.

 Dont waste your time or money and avoid this, at all costs, unless you enjoy tawdry, revisionist opera.",1454284800,,1796,4.963333333333333

I wanted to see this opera to get familiar with it before The Metropolitan production of the HD series was shown on TV.
I found this production on Amazon among others. I gas glad to get this one because it is very good. I enjoyed it very much, it was very funny. The setting, costumes and of course the singers/actors were great.
The only singer that I knew from other productions was Ludovic Tezier, but I read the reviewers and decided to buy this one.
The whole cast was excellent. There were some funny scenes such as the one as marc Laho dressed as a nun using two oranges as breasts and loosing one of them while he is singing.
This is also a character that doesn't have any concern seducing women, first as a pilgrim and then as a nun, at the end he is discovered and punished for his actions.
Countess Adele and Isolier played by Annick Masie and Diana Montage were also very good as well as the rest of the characters.
A few weeks later I saw the Met's production which I found very good,it is probably that I will buy it.",1316908800,3,1368,5.305555555555555
8068361,5,B0009WIDX0,"The production sparkles.  It is fun.  The set is clever and the costumes bright.  However all of this could have been ruined by poor video direction, jerky camera work and distracting editing.  Anyone who has watched a significant number of opera or ballet DVDs has seen this kind of irritating production.  Fortunately for this product Brian Large was in charge of the video.  His camera is always where the action in.  His tasteful use of 3/4 shots and head shots augment the story.  The scenes are fairly long and there are no jerky cuts.  It is well worth seeking out his work as he adds so much to the quality of a DVD production.",1306713600,3,635,4.5
8068362,5,B0009WIDX0,"A beautiful production, wonderful performance by all involved.
The casting is perfect.  Laho in the title role is both comic and roguishly likeable.  Both his acting and singing are first rate.
As Ory's 'accomplice', a young Ludovic Terzier gave a performance with flying colours.  The 'cellar' song is the climax of the Ory gang's hilarious adventure.
The director manages to make the 'bedroom scene' funny and tasteful at one single stroke.
The 'stars' of the show are undoubtedly Terzier and Annick Massis, Countess Adele.
Massis is simply the most beautiful and accomplished coloratura soprano of her generation. As indeed, she sung ALL the four roles in Offenbach's 'Les Contes d'Hoffmann' in 2009!
Here, as the Countess Adele, she brings in terrific singing and marvellous vocal acting.  Her stage presence is magnificience itself, and her acting is also wonderful.
As Solier, Ory's rival, Diana Montague is also terrific both vocally and dramatically. A slender and handsome figure, she convinces the audience that Adele should abhor Ory and be drawn to Solier the page instead.
The supporting roles of Ragonde and the Governor are both superbly portrayed, and there is simply no weak link in this truly wonderful performance.
Unreservedly recommended for all opera lovers.",1301961600,2,1280,5.29064039408867
