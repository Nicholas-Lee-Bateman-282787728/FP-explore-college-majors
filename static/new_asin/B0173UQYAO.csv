7489244,5,B0173UQYAO,Yes!!!!!!!! I've been waiting for this,1449705600,,38,5.5
7489245,5,B0173UQYAO,"When I first saw this, my heart lit up and I was smiling for days...that is until I saw the price. Thinking to myself ""It's not worth that much"" I decided to wait for just the regular DVD to come out. But, one day, I thought to myself that I could have it payed off easily if I'm smart about my money and after talking it over with some friends I went ahead and bought. Now I anxiously wait for February to come and it to deliver the greatest birthday present ever, Akame ga Kill Box Set.",1449532800,,488,4.041237113402062
7489246,4,B0173UQYAO,"When I was scrolling around, looking for shows up for pre-order, my heart stopped. AKAME GA KILL! One of my most favoritest action shows! But...lo and behold, the Sentai price has shot down my dreams. ESPECIALLY since this release only has 12 episodes while the entire series is 24.
No. Just no. Sure, you can get the entire series for under $70 on itunes. But only if you don't mind censoring, could care less about a collector's edition, and want neither DVD nor Blu-Ray (which it will look fantastic on); These are all requirements for me, so it's a no-go. Still, I'll do you a favor and review this series. After all, the price is not so blood-vessel-popping as those of Sword Art Online, Kill la Kill, and Fate/Zero.

PLOT: This is a Fantasy/Adventure anime, through and through. Think Code Geass during the time of Tower of Druaga. Basically, it is the story of the revolutionaries, Assasins known as Night Raid, as they take on the corrupt monarchy/dictatorship that oppresses the people. We follow the main character on his journey of growth after he is abducted by said assasins and joins their ranks. But that's no fun. Let's throw in magical weapons made from monsters that only an elite few can use, and it'll be AWESOME!
And it is, dear ones, it is.

CHARACTERS: Here we have a diverse cast of stereotypes, archetypes, and completely original takes. I won't go into much detail, but you'll like these characters. They work as a family unit, and it is touching to watch. When someone dies, you feel it; that goes for both the protagonists, Night Raid, and the antagonists, The Jaegers. Be prepared for you heart strings to be violently raked. Or, at least the show will try to. Neither side is at fault, only the corrupt minister at the top, so it's kinda sad to watch them duke it out. But that's plot for ya. Just be prepared to hold onto your feels. Of course, I'm trying not to spoil anything, but people die in war; it's as simple as that. If the pacing was a little better, you might've found a few tears shedding down your cheeks.

MUSIC: The openings are pretty rockin' (literal rock music) and the ending are skippable. Electric guitar is a favorite, and you can expect it a lot because the battle music uses it, and there is an overabundance of battles.

ANIMATION: Phenomenal. What else can I say? It's what you'd expect from Sword Art Online or Riddle Story of Devil. The designs are bright and unique for the characters, and the world created is so very expansive by keeping to its medieval roots. The battle animation is some of the best you'll ever see, and the magical weapons allow for some very neat effects. Definitely a feast for the eyes, though sometimes the characters seem drawn a tad flat.

FLAWS: There are very many, but one of the most vexing is that they make the main character NOT A WIMPY LOSER on his own, but every time he fights the antagonist he becomes like every sorry sod of a protagonist you've seen before. Even so, I will not deny that the show was so entertaining that I couldn't put it down, but there are some gaping holes. To refrain from spoiling, I will merely say that the story takes some unorthodox turns at times. Try to understand from a narrative point of view the near necessity of the outcomes, but you ought to just see it and determine them for yourself. I tell you, folks, the pacing could've been a lot better if less time was focused on childish pranks for giggles, and the writer could've made better traction if he focused on the serious side of the tone-coin if he planned to make us feel any sympathy.

I am biased, so very biased. What made this show for me was the inclusion of General Esdeath, my favorite character of ""Akame ga Kill."" Every moment with her is gold, just as the mastermind in ""Danganronpa."" This anime is above average...There are certainly better shows out there, but I was completely drawn in, especially since the time period focuses in the dark ages; few anime incorporate such a setting. If you want sword-fighting action, you've come to the right place. If you want high philosopy, twists that make sense, and conventional anime plot, look elsewhere. For 12 episodes, considering the production values, I think $60 is at least near fair, and I still really want to own this series despite the expense and the flaws. I mean, c'mon; Parasyte is $50 at the moment, and the production values there seem in a different league. Of course, looks can be deceiving, so I guess I'll bide my time for one of those wonderful Amazon price-cuts. Take my word as you see fit.",1449100800,15,4562,4.584558823529412
7489247,5,B0173UQYAO,Great series that is a little dark and serious but also is funny and lighthearted at times. The story is resolved in the two volumes. I think Amazon still has it on their Amazon anime channel Strike if you don't want to buy both blurays,1498262400,,236,4.266666666666667

7489250,5,B0173UQYAO,This is a very good anime in my opinion. The best thing about it is the Imperial Arms - special weapons with extraordinary abilities.,1494374400,,133,4.583333333333333
7489251,3,B0173UQYAO,"This anime had the potential to be one of the better animes to come out in a while but it failed in a very simple and easily fixable way. This anime is all about fighting and killing but there's very little fights that we actually get to see and all the killings were either blacked out or not shown. What would have made this series better would have been a more adult themed series that would allow the fight scenes to last longer and for us viewers to actually see the killing blows. This is essentially a weak PG-13 series that should have been an R rated series. So instead of getting more blood, gore and actual death scenes, what we get is a watered down version of what it could have been. It's a series I'm glad I borrowed, from a friend, instead of buying. Oh, the friend I borrowed from didn't even open the second set as he hated it. A very average series with average animation.",1493856000,,891,4.27810650887574

7489254,5,B0173UQYAO,Great show,1481760000,,10,4.5
7489255,5,B0173UQYAO,"I was thoroughly impressed with Akame Ga Kill, it is a great mix of humor with seriousness, coupled with amazing animation. I think the different character arcs are well planned and though sometimes disappointing, they work well. I won't spoil anything, but the ending kinda left a hole in me...

This series is about a group of assassins known as Night Raid, and they are working to rid the tyrannical empire of corruption. All the characters that are portrayed are given so much life, both the ""good"" guys and the ""bad"" guys, and all have different and unique personalities, and I really liked that. The animation is great, and I was pleased with the opening and closing songs. The characters in this series engage in deadly battles with weapons called ""Imperial Arms"", each having a unique power or function. When two Imperial Arms wielders clash, one always most certainly dies, and this makes for some great high points and at other times, very low points. I felt that some battles were anti climactic, thought when you're dead, I guess that's it, so maybe that is the feeling that the studio was trying to capture. In any case, I definitely recommend this series, I also liked that it is 24 episodes, giving the creators ample time to build a good story line instead of cramming it into a 12 episode series (which I am seeing all too often as of late...).  Just make sure you get part one and two, otherwise you will be left hanging. I wish it was sold as a set, but alas. Good English dub too, I picked Misato from Evangelion out right away :)",1479686400,2,1550,4.571942446043166

7489257,5,B0173UQYAO,"Fun and exciting action anime that shows no fear of blood, dismemberments, and some fanservice.

I don't understand why people are complaining about the price, anime is almost always expensive, some shows are cheaper, but in general Anime is just one of those things you need to pay for.  I don't blame them as these are not main stream movies or anything and have to make up the difference somewhere.  (Honestly this show is actually worth it, well IMO anyhow, very well done)

Regarding the show though, it is really well done and the artwork is great (including some goofy art in goofy moments).  I recommend this show, if you can afford it.  If you can't just rent it/buy it on Amazon.",1456963200,2,812,4.4391891891891895
