415404,5,6302032199,"MAN OF THE WEST is one of the greatest of all westerns. Dismissed for being too violent, too dark, too grim and downbeat when it first opened back in the fall of 1958, its reputation has been growing ever since.  Unfortunately, the video available from MGM/UA is in pan-and-scan, and  unless you see MAN OF THE WEST in letterbox, you aren't really seeing the  film as it was meant to be seen. Turner Classics shows it in letterbox, so  I recommend forgoing this video and waiting until TCM shows it in  letterbox. Toward the end of his career, Cooper through off the shackles  and took on several dark characters, characters deeply flawed and deeply  wounded. Whatever the merits of some of these final films, Cooper's  performances are stunning, at times even shattering. MAN OF THE WEST is one  of those performances. The metamorphosis his Link Jones goes through shows  just what range Cooper possessed as an actor. This film is one of the real  champs.",953510400,5,956,4.733333333333333

Anthony Mann delivers a fair drama where complex psychologies are stripped bare. It's made watchable by the presence of an always excellent Gary Cooper, but it's not one of Mann's better westerns.

Gary Cooper plays Link, a man who started his life anew several years ago in order to escape his criminal past. He's on his way to Fort Worth to hire a school teacher when circumstances reunite him with his old gang. Doc Tobin, leader of the gang, is filled with rage at Link for running away, but loves him like a son. Doc longs for the past, for youth, and for a world that's disappeared and Link is his link to all that he misses.

Surrounding players each contribute to this psychological drama; Julie London gives a good performance as Billie, who finally learns what it is to love. Also, look for a vicious, unrecognizable Jack Lord from Hawaii-Five-O.

For all its strengths, there is a staginess about this film; some scenes are too long and set in one location. Also, a sense of the outer world disappears around the point when Cooper stumbles upon his old gang in the farmhouse. For this reason, I'm giving it 3 stars out of 5.",1438041600,,1147,4.580487804878048

415489,1,6302032199,"This is the kind of 50s psychological western that gave the genre a bad rap and helped bury it forever. The implausible plot is nothing more than a poor excuse for indulging in an unending display of sadism that has nothing to do with real issues in the old west. Its a question of being different, but not necessarily better.

As is the case with many films of that decade, the leading man, Gary Cooper is about 30 years too old for the part. Yes, Im aware hes an icon - so what. He looks haggard and feeble - and completely ridiculous when he has to tangle with a much younger Jack Lord. He should have passed on this one and stayed home to nurse his health. Lee J. Cobb, who, in real life was 10 years younger than him, plays his uncle (!!!). And leading lady July London looks like she could be his daughter - make that grand-daughter. An underused and gorgeous actress, hers is the only subtle an heart-felt performance in the entire film. In the case of Cobb, an electrifying actor in his earlier work, he had by this time turned into a shameless and embarrassing ham and helps bury what was already a ludicrous mess, chewing up the sets, the cactus, the cast & crew, all at the top of his lungs. I found myself fast forwarding every time he was on. You cant wait for him to die - of a stroke.

The contrived plot about a reformed outlaw forced to face his past is full of unconvincing coincidences and inconsistencies - since others have described it in detail I won't waste time on it. Half the film looks like a one-set TV play and the other half tries to make up for it with dramatic landscapes, but by that time its too late.

Anthony Mann was responsible for some of the best film noirs of the late 40s and some of the best westerns of the early 50s, particularly those with James Stewart, but by this time, he was settling for squalid and depressing clunkers inhabited by despicable characters as in the case of this stiff and Gods Little Acre.

I have to say that the blu-ray print is the best Ive ever seen, but thats no reason to buy this if you truly love westerns. This belongs to a genre that back in the 50s was known as Anti-Western, a term I never understood. I mean, would you make an anti-comedy?

Following the train tracks Cooper seems to be heading into familiar territory and soon runs into some old buddies. However this is not a friendly reunion as Cooper left the murderous outfit years ago because he had enough of the killing. The rest of the movie is dark, tense, and compelling as Cooper tries to outwitt and convince the leader of the gang and once old friend, played by Lee J. Cobb,  that he's back to join the old gang. Cobb gives a wonderful perfromance as an aged and rather elderly outlaw who has long since passed his prime.

But because of the nature of this cut throat gang pretends to be married to her. In an attempt to keep her from surely being raped and most likely killed. By Coopers presence alone this also keeps Arthur O'Connell from being killed too. As the gang seems content with giving O'Connell chores to do for the time being.

415547,5,6302032199,"One of the truly great films.  What makes it great is that you never have any idea what is going to happen next.  It takes the assumptions of the Western genre, and rethinks them all (all except the shooting of the second string bad guy off the roof, was that really necessary?).  The camerawork is particularly amazing (beautiful long shots that matter).  It is a mark of the pull of the genre that the one thing you want to have happen in the film is denied to you (Mann does this over and over again in his films as if to inoculate you), and it seems forced, even so.

Lee J. Cobb is perhaps way too over the top, but everyone else is perfect.  Cooper is great: you would think that doing everything he does he would be a parody of himself (as John Wayne became), but he isn't. And as has been said many times,  this is Julie London's greatest performance -- she has some cliche lines to speak, but she carries it all off.  Her striptease is very unsettling, because we are criminalized by it (we want it to go further and are disappointed when it stops so soon, thank you 1950s), she is so statuesque.

415552,1,6302032199,"boy, are the reviews here way off the mark. this is basically a three act play: character set up (passengers on the train), plot thickening (robbery and cabin fever), violent climax (ghost town show down). the problem is with the plotting of the lead characters. lee j. cobb is stridently annoying -- bawling, hollering, yelling, bellowing, hooting, roaring, screaming -- except for the stretches where he's drunkenly muttering. menace isn't created, only the impression that he's a mental defective who needs a hearing aid. julie london is quietly effective as the abused woman, if you believe a woman of her experience can fall in love with a man simply because he hasn't raped her.

it's bad enough that the chemistry between cooper and london is nonexistent; he flinches every time she touches him. it's barely tolerable that cooper has the gait of an arthritic farmer and would never stand up in a real brawl. the problem is that his character is deeply stupid. once a hunted outlaw, he saunters into a big town with a bag full of money. rather than deposit the money in a local bank where it can be wired ahead, he packs it with him on a train. rather than hide from train robbers, he stands around where one can conk him on the head. rather than walk along the tracks to the next town, he heads across open country to the shack where he knows his evil uncle used to live. guess what! evil uncle ""doc"" still lives there! and rather than sneak off in the night, he beds down in the barn. and although cooper and his friends have only come to the cabin because they've been stranded by the fleeing train -- as the robbers are quick to point out -- doc hollers and bellows and takes cooper back into his gang anyway. just like that! and so it goes, right up to the final anticlimactic and weirdly unconvincing shootout.

the cinematography, alternating between enclosed spaces and the big outdoors, and the cliched action movie musical score, as predictable as a borscht belt comedy routine, can't possibly redeem it. i have not seen *every* western ever made, but ""man of the west"" competes with ""el topo"" as one of the most confused and poorly conceived. a stagey and hokey bore.",1328313600,6,2184,4.640826873385013

415554,5,6302032199,"When the subject of Anthony Mann's contribution to the western genre is explored, it is his cycle with James Stewart that is inevitable brought up. Indeed the Stewart collaboration Naked Spur (1953) remains Mann's highest praised achievement in the great American genre. However, it is his nearly forgotten and last true western, Man of the West (1958) starring Gary Cooper that is his most strikingly modern. A telling sign of this film's greatness lies in its still debated status.

Mann's casting of Cooper is nothing less than inspired brilliance, although it probably cost the film box office revenue. Mann and Stewart had fallen out during the making of the previous year's Night Passage, but by then audiences had come to accept Mann's reinvention of Stewart's on-screen persona. Starting in 1950, under Mann's direction Stewart had been portrayed as violent, selfish, cynical and remarkably complex.

In 1958, Gary Cooper was nearing the end of his career and no director had manipulated Cooper's screen personality in such a way as Mann had done with Stewart. Andre de Toth, a competent journeyman director who, never the less, lacked a real consistent vision, had come closest in Springfield Rifle (1952) by portraying Cooper's character as an accused coward in the first half of that film. However, that turned out to be an undercover ploy to smoke out the real traitors, so Cooper retained his pure as the driven snow nobility after all. Still, even then, neither audiences nor critics bought it. Laconic simplicity and nobility were Cooper's well established personality trademarks. Mann took advantage of what was already established and manipulated it with a darkly hued underbelly. Under Mann's direction, the ""Yup"" mannerisms of Cooper's Link Jones convey evasiveness in an attempt to hide a less than noble past.

Link Jones is about to catch a train, heading for Texas. He is on a mission to find a school teacher for his small town's new school and is carrying the funds to pay for her. A Marshall at the local train station thinks he recognizes Link, asks Link his name, inquires into Link's past and asks him if he knows the fugitive Doc Tobin (Lee J. Cobb). Link cautiously shakes his head, lies, squints, and evades the Marshall's penetrating looks. Mann's expert manipulation of Cooper's personality traits is so subtle as to be believable and, thus, unnerving. It was unsettling enough for 1958 audiences to reject it, and even contemporary critics have often lamented the casting of Cooper, as opposed to Stewart, in this film. Stewart would not have worked nearly as well simply because his casting would have been acceptable, even expected.

Cooper's Link Jones consistently plays dumb throughout the film, first to evade discovery, then out of sheer necessity for survival. It can well be believed that Link Jones hides a sordid past. Link's train trip is cut short when bandits rob the train. Link, saloon singer Billie (Julie London) and the con man Sam (Arthur O' Connell) are left stranded by the train. Link recognizes the nearby area as his one time home. Knowing the nearest town is 100 miles away, Link leads his fellow two passengers to the hidden farmhouse of his uncle and onetime foster father Doc Tobin. Link is surprised to find Doc there with his white trash gang. It is the same gang that robbed the train. Doc is even more surprised to see his prodigal son, Link. Doc reminds Link of a murder they committed together. Link looks away, vulnerable, embarrassingly exposed as if naked in front of the gang. Cobb expertly captures the trashy Doc without resorting to over-the-top, mannered melodramatics, such as the type Donald Pleasance' resorted to with a similar character in the otherwise well done Will Penny (1968) directed by Tom Gries.

Man of the West becomes a reversal of a biblical melodrama, with a dash of Oedipus thrown in for good measure. Here it is the father figure who needs redemption, but he is too unyielding, too far gone down the wrong path, too broken to find it. The prodigal, who has found his first redemption, away from his uncle/father, will eventually have to commit patricide in order to survive and secure his redemption. Billie and Sam have unwittingly joined the intentionally monikered ""Link"" on an existential journey that will transform them as well. The prodigal's cousins/step-brothers resent Link and feel betrayed that Doc still favors Link, even though they have proven more loyal and did not abandon their father the way Link did.

One of the gang has been mortally injured from the train robbery. Doc wants to display his still strong leadership and ""family pride"" to his returned prodigal. Doc orders his men to shoot and kill their wounded comrade. Neither cousin Punch (Robert J. Wilke, memorable in High Noon) nor cousin Trout (the always impressive Royal Dano) can do it. They are not real men, according to Doc. Link attempts to hide his smile, pleased that the first sign of Doc's lack of loyalty is blatantly apparent to all. Vicious cousin Coaley (Jack Lord) will do it.

When Coaley does the deed, Link's tension is felt. Indeed, this is a film of diaphanous tensions. We do not know just how long Link can continue his act or whether he will be able to protect his fellow passengers from harm. At greatest risk is Billie. Julie London invests an internal sexual tension in her character that she is sickened by. The sex appeal of London has often been compared to Elvis Presley, but it is London's complexity that renders Presley comparatively banal. Billie is as frightened for Link as he is for her. Thankfully, the romance that one keeps expecting to blossom between the two, never does, which only heightens the sexual tension. She knows full well what these men are capable of doing to her since she has dealt with types akin to these for years. ""You are not like these at all"" Billie tells Link. ""I was. There was no difference."" He tells her. Link's fear parallels Billie's fear. It is not the fear of the unknown, but the fear of what they both know all too well that threatens to consume them. Both characters resonate authenticity. Neither of them could survive their tormentors if they did not understand them and, in Link's case, if he had not once been that himself. This will lead to a second redemption for Link, in finally coming face to face with what he has been attempting to outrun for so long. Billie was on the verge of her escape when she boarded the train, but escape cannot be equated with redemption. When she left for Texas, Billie was on the verge of spiritual bankruptcy, from having seen and experienced too much. Now, out of necessity, cynicism and coldness have been replaced with co-dependency, vulnerability, and faith in someone else. Sam does not have enough firsthand experience in familiarity to ensure survival. However, he too must find redemption. Sam the con man is ready, willing and able to abandon Billie in escape. Sam does not need Billie, but he needs Link, only Link will not resort to such selfishness. Link's inspired example will provide Sam his own opportunity for an unselfish choice.

Cousin Claude (John Dehner) returns to the lair, having heard Link was on the train. When he finds Link alive and well with Uncle Doc, he is embittered, knowing that Link is only pretending to go along with Doc's dream of a full reconciliation between himself and Link. Claude loves Doc, especially in light of Doc's increasing senility and alcohol-induced nostalgia for older, better days, which he knows Link is taking advantage of in order to survive. Claude begs Doc to kill Link, even though he knows Doc, who truly loves Link, will never allow it.

Link, echoing the Davidic Absalom, takes revenge upon Coaly for his intended violation of Billie. Link humiliates Coaley in the same manner that Coaly humiliated Billie, in front of the ""family."" In the earlier sequence, Coaley forced Billie to expose herself by stripping down to her corset as he held a knife to Link's exposed throat. Drained and vulnerable, Billie collapses in abject humiliation. That earlier sequence is, by turns, titillating, repulsive and unbearably tense. In retaliation, Link now similarly exposes Coaly, stripping him down after a savage beating. Link identifies all too well with Billie's vulnerability. They both felt naked and humiliated in front of this family. The retaliation scene is equally tense and well executed. Doc is so proud of Link's raw humiliation of Coaly, that he slaps, father-like, Link on the back. Doc's number one boy is back. It is more than Coaley can endure and he tries to shoot cousin Link. Ready, willing, and able, Sam intentionally takes the bullet meant for Link. The dying Sam tells Link, ""I don't know what came over me. I never would have done that before."" Sam tires to pooh-pooh his sacrifice,"" It was a shrewd move of me. If they had killed you, they never would have allowed me to live."" Link knows better than to accept Sam's half-hearted downplay of what he just gave up. Inevitably, Link and Billie will join Sam, unless an opportunity soon arises.

Doc wants to consummate the old father-son relationship with a bank job in the nearby town of Lassoo. The senile Doc is unaware that Lassoo is now a ghost town, but Link is aware of it and sees this as the opportunity to reverse the situation for Billie and for himself.

Billie is raped (off-screen) by Doc (shades of the biblical Lot) while, simultaneously, Link is killing Doc's ""sons"" in Lassoo. In the showdown between Link and Doc, Link tells his father, ""I have killed your sons. Lassoo is a ghost town, like you. You are a ghost who has outlived his usefulness."" Man of the West is brutal poetry and may well the best film of Mann's entire oeuvre. Par for the course, MGM has issued it in a ""ho-hum"" release.",1285200000,5,9834,4.8545887961859355

This was one of Cooper's final films and, frankly, he seems a bit old for the role, even though the movie itself is an excellent adult western with some good action scenes.

Former outlaw Cooper, now a family man and rancher, is riding on a train that is robbed by his old gang.  He, along with fellow passengers Julie London and Arthur O'Connell, are taken hostage, their lives threatened by half-crazed gang leader Lee J. Cobb, who wants Cooper to return to his old ways.

Jack Lord plays a gang member.

Cobb) he used to run with --- They don't trust him and he loathes them but they decide he can help them with one last bank job --- The rest of the gang is Robert J. Wilke, Royal Dano, Jack Lord, and John Dehner. Lee J. Cobb is Dock Tobin and though he's 10 years younger than Cooper, he plays his uncle. Along for the ride are fellow train passengers Julie London and Arthur O'Connell --- It's an admirable cast --- Jack Lord as a wild and rebellious killer, John Dehner as a cool but equally violent person, Lee J. Cobb as a filthy old man who was the leader of the gang and who surely was the example for the other gangmembers and Arthur O'Connell and Julie London as the innocent bystanders who Cooper must look out for --- Also thought that the content and violence was very well done to help people get the feeling of what people could be like --- All in all, ""Man of the West"" is not only one of Cooper's best but one of the best westerns ever --- Anthony Mann's final foray into the western genre is a disturbing examination of man's basic instincts, rising in intensity to the level of Shakespearean tragedy.

415592,5,6302032199,"I first saw this movie about 40 years ago. I thought it was great then and it is still great. Gary Cooper gives an outstanding performance. Jack Lord is excellent as a bank and train robber, this is pre Hawaii 5-0. Lee J. Cobb is great as the patriarchal head of an outlaw clan. One of the great western classics from before the advent of the spaghetti westerns.",1216166400,,362,4.338235294117647
415593,4,6302032199,"This under-rated classic along with ""The Hanging Tree"" which came out a year later, was one of the last westerns that Gary Cooper made.  Unfortunately, it was dismissed upon its first release but the French, particularly Francois Truffaut lauded praise on it and it is now one of the many classic westerns that Anthony Mann has made.  It's plot really foreshadows that of Eastwood's ""The Unforgiven"" in many ways though I do lean more to Clint's western classic than this one. But don't let that deter you from checking this out.  Mann was a master at using the natural landscape/terrain to convey the tensions in his characters and this is no exception. Like Coop, this was to be Mann's last western before he directed the big spectacles like ""El Cid"" and ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"". One example of Mann's use of the environment is the shootout scene between Coop and John Dehner (cousin Claude).  The brilliant tension that Mann achieved in this particular scene was exceptional and not even Eastwood could equal this as much as I like him but of course, Clint's particular strength was more in the psychology of his characters whereas Mann's strength as a director was using the natural environment to convey tensions in his characters.  Anyway, I will renting this film from Blockbuster and if it holds up well, perhaps I will buy it.

415625,5,6302032199,"This Western stands far above 95% of the other films in this genre. Why? Great direction, flawed and therefore interesting characters, quirks, twists, classic conflicts, Julie London at the height of her mythic beauty, memorable dialogue, enigmatic situations, wonderful actors and performances. This is most definitely not a formulaic picture. When is the last time you saw a fight in a western where one guy rips the clothes off of another, just for humiliation sake?

Gary Cooper is topnotch as usual, here toward the end of his long and glorious career, but taking some chances by playing a once-super nasty hombre who's now gone straight. My friends and I memorized long passages of the dialogue, particularly the lines spat out by gang leader Doc Tobin, played magnificently by Lee J. Cobb. Here's Doc waxing nostalgic, upon first recognizing Link after many years : ""Uvalde.....Saltillo.....Black Fork! Remember them times?? We killed that bank guard together. You held him and I took the top of his head off?"" Later Link complains that Doc makes him stay in a room with the creepy mute Trout, played by one of filmdom's alltime great psychos, Royal Dano. Doc again: ""Being with Trout is like being alone!"" If you don't know about Royal Dano, think of Crispin Glover to get an idea. The two are probably related somehow.

What a great supporting cast as well, featuring, besides Dano, some of the dirtiest and most lowdown badguys ever: the frightening John Dehner as Cousin Claude, and that unsung antihero of countless westerns, snarling Robert J. Wilke. And we would be remiss if we did not mention the guy who got his pants ripped off and ends up shedding tears of humiliation: Jack Lord!",1209081600,7,1699,4.937062937062937
415626,5,6302032199,"Why was this film not liked by alot of people when it came out? Lee J. Cobb is one of the best leaders of a band of outlaws I have ever seen in movies. Gary Cooper is great, definitely not on par with his masterful perfomances in ""FRIENDLY PERSUASION"", ""HIGH NOON"", or ""THE WESTERNER"", but he is very good. The rest of the cast play their roles wonderfully. Royal Dano plays a mute, but he usually did portray either a very quiet character or a somewhat different character, so he is alright. John Dehner is also very quiet, calm, cool, and collected, but in his last scene, in his gunfight with Cooper, he becomes very nervous and worried, because he knows that Cooper is coming for him, but he does not know where Cooper is. Robert Wilke turns in a usual villainous role as Ponch, another member of the gang. His performance is definitely not as good as his small roles in his earlier part of an adversary against Gary Cooper, as one of the bad-guys from High Noon, his earlier work with director of this movie, Anthony Mann, in ""THE FAR COUNTRY"", his later work as ""Wallace"", the braggart competing against James Coburn, in ""THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN"", or the first mate of the Nautilus in one of my other favorites, the Disney version of ""TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA"". Julie London is good, but I cannot compare her to anything else because I have never seen her in anything else but this movie. Arthur O'Connell fits his role like a glove. A role of a person who is talkative, nosy, and very nervous under pressure. Enough with the okay-but-not-perfect performances. On to the ones who should have won some awards for their portrayals. These people would be Lee J. Cobb and Jack Lord. Lee J. Cobb is a particular standout with his deep, cackling, cracked voice of an old man. He is also the only one out of the entire cast, except for London and O'Connell, that actually likes Cooper's character, Link Jones. He is obviously very surprised when Link kills him, because of the soft spot that he has held for Link ever since their good old days of being outlaws. Anthony Mann required Cobb to ham up his voice from just a deep, resonant, booming presence into the voice of an old, old man that has seen better days, both physically and metaphorically, has apparently lost his mind, is usually drunk, and still harbors feelings of a type of father-son relationship for Link. This father-son relationship is what was a big factor towards Dock Tobin's demise. But, unfortunately, it also gives Link an edge against Dock so he can surprise him by drawing his gun to kill him before Tobin can draw his. Jack Lord is absolutely superb as Coaley. He has a particular characteristic in this movie. This characteristic would be the sneer that he has- very cruel, unforgiving, evil, and nasty all at the same time. Another standout from Lord's performance is one of his last scenes, which is his fight with Link, that ranges from in the middle of the small circle of wagons, to a tree a little distance away, and back again. The last part of the fight is definitely the best part of the fight. The reason for this is because Link tears Coaley's clothes off, down to his undershirt, in exchange for what Coaley forced London's character, Billie Ellis, to do, earlier in the movie, back at the gang's hideout shack. Then, Coaley pulls his gun on Dock, but who he really wants to kill is Link. He fires at Link, but somebody else is killed, because they jumped in front of the gun to save Link's life. Dock then kills Coaley. All through this fight, ever since Link gained the upper hand, that is, Coaley was crying. He was still crying when Dock shoots him. This is when we realize that Coaley was a coward, and had, ever since Link ""joined"" with them again, been jealous of Dock's preference of Link above the rest of them. Coaley just obviously could not stand it. There are two other performances that deserve praise. These would be the one-of-a-kind relationship between Billie and Link, which is very hard to put into words. They cannot get married, but if Link was single, we all know that she would marry him in a heartbeat. When you think about it, Link and Billie do not really need to get married, because the audience would not know what to expect if they were. Cooper and London are perfect for their roles just the way they are. The last, but certainly not the least performance is the great scenery. Sure, its not nearly as good as the scenery in Mann's colloborations with James Stewart, but the scenery in MAN OF THE WEST is not Oregon or Canada/Alaska, such as in ""BEND OF THE RIVER"", Stewart and Mann's second Western, or in The Far Country, Stewart and Mann's fourth Western. However, the scenery in Man of the West is quite superb. But all these great performances make up an even greater movie. Man of the West would not be what it is, a great Western, if it did not have the performances of Cooper, Cobb, Lord, and all the rest.

THIS REVIEW IS DEDICATED TO ANYONE, LIVING OR DEAD, INVOLVED IN THE MAKING OF ""MAN OF THE WEST"".",1200960000,4,5195,4.58494623655914
415627,5,6302032199,"Mann's cycle began in 1950 with ""Winchester '73,"" continued up to 1958 (his pallid remake of ""Cimarron"" in 1960 hardly counts here) with ""Man of the West,"" and included a remarkable body of work as ""Bend of the River,"" ""The Naked Spur,"" ""The Far Country,"" ""The Man from Laramie,"" ""The Last Frontier,"" and ""The Tin Star.""

""Man of the West"" starred Cooper instead of James Stewart, and its highly charged story of the conflict between two one-time partnered outlaws, one now reformed, carries strong overtones of sex and violence, the one motivated by the presence of Julie London, the other taken care of by Lee J. Cobb's particularly repulsive villain... The film is replete with interesting, complex characters and exciting situations...

Gary Cooper, in the Arizona of the 1870s, sets forth from his little town with six hundred dollars to hire for it a teacher... A trip on a train introduces him to a comely saloon singer (Julie London), to a card sharp (Arthur O'Connell), but also to a bit of his past he'd rather forget... For when the train is held up it is all too soon apparent that the gang is one to which he'd belonged in the bad old days, led by a villainous kinsman (Lee J. Cobb) and containing another member of the family (John Dehner).

The reformed Cooper's only chance of a getaway--and the girl's chance too--lies in him convincing Cobb and Co., that his loyalties lie with them... Fine, says Cobb, in effect, but do something to prove it.

The 'something' is joining in a stage bank hold-up...

From this moment, the theme is familiar in Mann Westerns and here the mechanics of the 'purging' and the power of it get their best expression... Mann's picture shifts from half-comedy to tense melodrama... Cooper stops being a hick and starts acting serious and clever... ""You've changed,"" O'Connell observes. ""You act like you belong with these people.""

The clash of family loyalties soon makes itself felt... The old man brought him up when he was a boy--the old man still obviously thinks something of him, since he stops an attempt on his life... But the old man is also a villain, and villainy is his prevailing climate and that is why Cooper initially made his breakaway...

The difference between Cooper and his depraved relatives was significant when it comes across in the way they treat Billie (Julie London). Most Western heroes distrust women, but Cooper respects at least two: his wife and the pretty saloon singer... It makes no difference to him that in Billie's shady past she has probably taken off her clothes for many men and gone much farther than that... When Jack Lord forces Billie to disrobe, Cooper realizes her humiliation... After beating Lord, Cooper makes him cry by stripping off his clothes in front of Billie, reminding him of how he insulted the dancehall girl: ""How does it feel?!""

Gary Cooper must take part in two gunfights at the end of the film... The first one in Lassoo, a ghost town which represents the life Cooper left behind... Here, Cooper reveals the very bad talents Cobb taught him... And after finding the saloon singer has been raped, Cooper goes off to find Cobb... Mann typically sets his final gun duels far away from civilization, off in the wilderness, away from all eyes...

Released in CinemaScope and Technicolor, this visually beautiful dramatic Western gained instant notoriety, in 1958, because of the scene in which Julie London strips for the Tobin gang...",1163030400,8,3440,4.836734693877551
415628,5,6302032199,"Director Anthony Mann's compositions for the frame always tended towards classic simplicity and uncluttered spareness, even in epic forms like El Cid. In Man of the West, they are pared back to the bone, mostly to a single claustrophobic interior and a journey through a barren desert landscape into a ghost town (ironically called ""Lassoo"").

Gary Cooper, in one of his most interior late performances, and sporting the resonant name of Link Jones, plays a former outlaw long gone straight and respectable, who through an unhappy chain of circumstances falls afoul of his old gang, presided over by ranting father/mentor figure Lee J Cobb, in a grandly theatrical role.

The most extreme of Mann's exploration of dysfunctional families and betrayed friendships, Man of the West encompasses sexual and physical humiliation (there are two remarkably nasty parallel scenes involving, respectively, Julie London and Jack Lord, and Gary Cooper and Jack Lord), madness and fratricide. Gary Cooper functions very differently from James Stewart in their respective westerns for Mann: while Stewart's demons are generally unleashed from within or through a contemplation of his alter ego in another strong protagonist (Bend of the River, The Naked Spur, The Man from Laramie), Cooper's are re-imposed from without (the accidental meeting up with his old partners in crime).

The film ends in tragedy: Cobb's death at the hands of his erstwhile ""son"" Cooper is staged with a grandeur that is consistent with Mann's proposal to film a western version of King Lear with John Wayne, a project sadly interrupted by Mann's sudden death. This is one of the great westerns.",1157068800,4,1657,5.245283018867925
415629,5,6302032199,"Man of The West was one of Gary Cooper's last Westerns, and he had transitioned from virile, youthfully exuberant characters to older, wizened, wiser, and scarred characters.

In this film, directed by masterful director Anthony Mann, Cooper plays a leading citizen who is on his way to hire a schoolteacher. On route, the stagecoach he's on is robbed, leaving Cooper, a dancehall girl played by Julie London, and a gambler played by Arthur O'Connell to fend for themselves. They end up crossing paths with an outlaw gang that Cooper used to run with; in fact, he's related to some of them. The old gang leader, played by Lee J. Cobb, wants Cooper to rejoin the gang, but Cooper wants to protect himself and his two charges from his greedy, bloodthirsty ex cohorts.

Mann and Cooper are both in their element, and this film is a rousing, entertaining, psychologically deep adventure that seems to point out the fallacy of thinking that your past will never catch up to you. This is a great film that deserves a DVD release.",1152144000,9,1023,4.741573033707865

415631,4,6302032199,"This is not a typical ""B"" Western.  Jimmy Stewart plays a man with a dark side, and a dark past for a change.  He had about given up Westerns because he found himself playing parts that were too similar too often.  This one was different.

Playing opposite Julie London, who played a saloon singer whose complaint was that everyone made passes at her, she fell into a situation (along with Stewart) where she was subjected to real brutality--tastefully handled.  Lee J. Cobb played the heavy, and did his usual great job.  Stewart was thrown back in with his old gang, from whom he had escaped once, and again was expected to rob banks and kill.

The story was good, and the acting was superb, as might be expected from such a cast.  A dark, forboding film, which will hold your attention.

415632,4,6302032199,"Gary Cooper stars in this intense Western as a former outlaw, now reformed, who finds himself trapped by circumstances with his former gang.  Cooper is on a train that is held up by the gang, and left behind, he, Julie London, and Arthur O'Connell meet up with the gang and witness firsthand their brutality and violence.  The gang is headed by Cooper's uncle, Lee J. Cobb, who is pleased to see Cooper return.  He's planning a big bank heist, the heist to end all heists, and wants Cooper to be a part of it like old times.  Of course, Cooper must find a way out.
The tension in the film never lets up, as the threat of violence hangs in every scene.  Cooper is fine in one of his last performances, portraying a man who has tried hard to overcome his past, finding himself in a situation where he must literally fight for his survival.  London also does well as the saloon singer finally experiencing love, giving a quietly moving performance.  Cobb is explosive as usual, helping to give the film some of its tension and edge.
Man Of The West is well photographed in colour, with empty spaces looming everywhere in the backdrop of the struggle.  Director Anthony Mann keeps everything simple, if not elemental, not shying away from portraying the brutality of the characters and the situation.  Other than an obviously ""stagey"" fight between Cooper and one of the gang (lots of easy to spot fake punches), there is a dark realism throughout the movie.

However, when he meets up with his Uncle and  former partner, Dock Tobin (Lee J. Cobb, brilliant) he is forced to  confront the fact that there is still a killer inside him. There is a  brutal fight between Cooper and Jack Lord which is one of the meanest, most  vicious fights I've ever seen in film. The only flaw, as others have  pointed out, is that this video version is not letterbox. Avoid it and wait  for TCM to show it in its original widescreen format. Better yet, why  doesn't MGM/UA simply release a letterbox version? Cooper made this  back-to-back with another classic, The Hanging Tree. But Warner Home Video  has seen fit to remove it from distribution here in the U.S. It's available  in Europe and Canada, but not here. Idiots!",953942400,17,924,4.601226993865031

Acting -- especially Gary Cooper's Link Jones, a man who is drawn back into his earlier life as a killer -- and direction and script and cinemaphotography, they are all flawless. The only  flaw is in this video, from MGM/UA. I've written them, trying to get them  to release this in letterbox and DVD, all to no avail. Do not buy this  pan-and-scan version, since director Anthony Mann took full advantage of  the wide screen to tell his story. In the pan-and-scan version, Cooper is  missing from much of the action. This is because it is a typically  tight-lipped Cooper performance, thus he is lopped out of the frame -- even  though he is central to every single scene in the entire film! This is a  magnificent film which is deserving of a better fate than MGM/UA video  distribution. TCM shows it in letterbox, catch it there.",953683200,29,866,4.607843137254902

The Shakespearean undercurrents in Reginald Rose's screenplay are fully realized by Mann and cinematographer Ernest Haller, who utilizes the Mohave Desert landscape to striking effect. Cooper's admirably complex portrayal is matched by an excellent cast  notably Lee J. Cobb's theatrical bravura as the King Lear-inspired outlaw leader. A critical and commercial disappointment upon its 1958 release, ""Man of the West"" has finally been recognized as an American classic. Featuring an impressive widescreen transfer and a long-overdue commentary track, the ""Masters of Cinema"" Blu-ray does justice to one of the great unsung Westerns.",1495929600,,749,5.871559633027523
7819839,4,6302032199,"Released in 1958 and directed by Anthony Mann, Man of the West stars Gary Cooper as a reformed owlhoot who becomes stranded with two others (Julie London & Arthur O'Connell) in the Arizona wilderness after their train is ambushed.  They eventually make their way to a hidden ranch in the rolling hills, which ushers in phantoms of the ex-outlaws past.

This is hailed as a cult classic and its obvious why: To compete with so-called adult TV Westerns of the mid-late 50s, like Gunsmoke, Cheyenne, Maverick and the brutal The Rifleman (for which Sam Peckinpah directed several segments), Mann made Man of the West so adult that there would be no comparison. He obviously wanted to spur people away from their TV sets and into the theater, along with the added attractions of widescreen, color, spectacular locations and just all-around superior filmmaking.

Whats so adult about Man of the West? The portrait of the West it paints is decidedly harsh with its band of psychotic killers and an ex-outlaw as a protagonist whos constantly on the verge of letting loose his long-held-in-check violent nature to stamp out the specters of his past. On top of this you have risqu&eacute; and risky moments for the era (which are rather tame today), like Londons character being forced to strip in front of the dudes and an off-screen rape. The other gang members, by the way, are played by Jack Lord, John Dehner, Royal Dano and Robert J. Wilke.

Some reviewers criticize the film for reasons that aren't very justified; for instance, the fact that Lee J. Cobb, who plays the half-mad uncle of Link (Cooper), was ten years younger than Cooper. Yet Coopers role was originally slated for the younger Stewart Granger. (James Stewart, Manns go-to man in five of his previous Westerns, desperately wanted the role, but Mann overlooked him due to their falling out during the pre-production of 1957s Night Passage wherein Mann pulled out). In any case, Cobb is made out to be about 10-12 years older than Link and I think it works for the most part, particularly since Cooper was still lean & mean at 56 during shooting, although his character is supposed to be 20 years younger. (Cooper would incidentally pass away a mere four years later). True, Links face looks withered, but it could be argued that thats what a hard life in the Old West does to a man.

Another criticism is the idea that Dock believed the bank in Lassoo would be full of money when the settlement turns out to be a virtual ghost town. Yet ghost towns were birthed overnight back then when mines would suddenly shut down, etc. The looney Dock obviously based his scheme on data from years earlier and an update on the towns status hadnt yet come to him or his gang. They were used to hiding out in their spare time and there was no internet or cell phones. Wheres the beef?

That said, there are some justifiable criticisms, like the surreal and lame melodramatics, the slow-pace and the dubiously choreographed fist fight sequence. These elements are so bad they might send modern viewers running away screaming. Thankfully, lame aspects like this went out of vogue by the 60s.

If you can roll with these issues and enter into the world of the movie, however, it has a number of attractions, including the subtext: Coopers character is named Link because he represents the link between the barbaric and the cultured, the primitive (his old gang) and the civilized (his new life).  Unfortunately, with the gift of volition some people inevitably choose to eschew progress and continue in their ape-headed, animalistic ways (which is actually offensive to animals).

After the aborted train robbery, Link starts to recognize his old stomping grounds and is attracted to the hidden shack for shelter & refreshment; yet perhaps also to revisit his past and the good ol days.  He vacillates between his new identity and the temptation of regressing to the wild freedom of his lawless youth.

Interestingly, Man of the West is very similar to the slightly superior The Law and Jake Wade, which debuted four months earlier. As good as the subtext is in Man its meatier in The Law (see my review), which is also a little less talky and melodramatic. Yet Man has since emerged as a cult classic while The Law has fallen into obscurity; no doubt because the latter lacks the two strip sequences and the iconic Cooper.

Although obviously flawed, Man of the West was the precursor of the Leone and Peckinpah styled Westerns that came into fashion in the mid-late 60s. The grim, laconic Link is the predecessor of future antiheroes, like Eastwoods Man with No Name, but Link is better IMO because he has more human dimension.

BEST LINE: ""There's a point where you either grow up and become a human being or you rot, like that bunch.""

The film runs 100 minutes and was shot entirely in California (Santa Clarita, Red Rock Canyon State Park, Jamestown, Thousand Oaks, Newhall, Sonora and the Mohave Desert, with studio-bound scenes done in West Hollywood). The script was written by Reginald Rose from Will C. Browns book The Border Jumpers.

7819840,5,6302032199,"This is an enjoyable film about a man who was raised by a thug who trained him to shoot to kill and rob what belongs to other people. When he grows older, he realizes that he is doing wrong, runs away, and starts a new life. He marries and has two children. The people of his town know about his past and trust him. They even give him their hard earned money to take with him to another city to bring back a teacher for their school. Gary Cooper does a splendid job portraying this man.
Things go wrong during the train ride to the other town and Cooper finds himself and two other passengers, one of whom is a beautiful woman, once again with the man who raised him and his gang. Both the old man and at least one of the gang want to rape the woman despite Cooper trying to save her by saying she is his woman.",1486080000,,811,4.043478260869565
