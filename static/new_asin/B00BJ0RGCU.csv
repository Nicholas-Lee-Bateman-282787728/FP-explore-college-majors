5625614,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"The real hero is not the man called Mud, but a 14 year old boy, Ellis, with women trouble. His mother wants to divorce Dad, and one can easily see why. His attempts at gaining his rightful status with girls of his age suffer from his relative underdelopment: his preferred girl friend May Pearl condescends to kissing him on the cheek, because he is so sweet, but no more can be expected there. She is half a head taller and looks almost adult. Puberty is hard for boys. (Maybe for girls too.)
Ellis adopts the case of a fugitive killer whom he found hiding on a little island. Mud has a girlfriend, Juniper, and Ellis, the romantic white knight, wants to help the pair elope from police and a revenge posse that was put together by the father of Mud's victim. Another woman who disappoints.
The story explodes into much gun violence. Background  checks might have been useless in this case.
Not memorable enough to stay with me for long, I expect, but good enough for 4.5 stars.",1369526400,9,979,4.5
5625615,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Matthew McConaughey has suffered for the last decade in romantic comedy hell with films like The Wedding Planner, Fool's Gold, Sahara and How To Lose a Guy In 10 Days with the only remotely decent films in that time being Frailty and Reign of Fire. How did he manage to climb out of acting mediocrity? Well we have to go back in time to the beginning of his career before we can go forward to the present and future. McConaughey struggled early in his career in the early and mid-1990's trying to find his footing as he took minor roles in films and one starring role in the dreadful Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation. McConaughey finally got his big break in Joel Schumacher's adaptation of John Grisham's A Time to Kill starring as Jake Brigance taking the spot like from the likes of Samuel L. Jackson, Kevin Spacey, Sandra Bullock and Donald Sutherland. He embodied the Grisham's character so well that you can't imagine anyone else playing the character. From A Time to Kill he moved on to the small film Lone Star followed by Contact and Amistad showing off his acting capabilities and that is how he found redemption by making better film choices as he has chosen to work with great and good directors like Christopher Nolan in Interstellar and Martin Scorsese in The Wolf of Wall Street. It seems like McConaughey decided end his reputation as a pretty boy who can't act and return to his roots showing everyone how capable of an actor he which bring us to Mud.

Mud is an intentionally sluggishly paced coming of age drama that follows the life and struggles of Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and the friends and family around him. Ellis and his best friend Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) live a river life on in southern Arkansas. The two find a boat resting high up in the trees on a small island on the river as if it is a sign from heaven the boys decided to make it their own only to find that someone has been living there. That is when they encounter a man simply known as Mud. Mud tells the boys he is waiting for someone and that if they boys help him get supplies he will then give them the boat. Through their journey with Mud we explore their hard lives as they deal with divorce, young love, facing the reality of the world and growing up. Jeff Nichols's screenplay is well written and thought out and inspired from Mark Twain. Yes his screenplay is slowly paced and for one moment in the film I wanted something to explode, but that was only a brief moment and otherwise I really enjoyed the story. The only flaw I had in the film was the climax at Ellis's boat home. It just seemed out of place, forced and didn't really work for me, but once the climax was over the epilogue was great.

Reese Witherspoon like McConaughey seems to have spent most of her career in the romantic comedy world, but unlike McConaughey Witherspoon is good at it. She is charming, beautiful and has a good sense of humor, but it is nice to see her take a dramatic risk in Mud as Juniper the woman Mud loves since he was a child and has killed for. Reese shines in her supporting role displaying her charm, but in a more of a heartbreaking way. The Incomparable Sam Shepard does an outstanding job as the Tom Blankenship the only man Mud respects and the closest thing he has to a father. Michael Shannon the ever ready quality actor does a good job as Galen, Neckbone's uncle and the man who's raised him as he tries beautifully shows the nervousness yet desire to be more than a uncle to Neckbone, but a father. The rest of the cast from Sarah Paulson, Bonnie Sturdivant and to Ray McKinnon all do a good job in their roles and add something to the film.

Mud is a naturally beautiful film. Filmed in Dumas and Stuttgart, Arkansas Adam Stone the cinematographer does a wonderful job showing off the natural beauty of the south and Arkansas which was matched by captivating minimalistic score done by composer David Wingo that fit the sluggish pace and cinematography of the film perfectly.

While Mud isn't perfect story wise or pacing wise it still has a really good heartwarming coming of age story that is greatly complimented by the actors such as Matthew McConaughey in his best acting job of his career, Reese Witherspoon, and Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland who I think have a potential of a very bright career in Hollywood. That along with the cinematography and score make Mud a great film and one of the two best films I've seen this year along with Beyond the Pines. Though I don't think the pacing of the film will make it for everyone I still I highly recommend Mud before the deluge of the summer films starting next week.",1368489600,,4633,4.492289442467379
5625616,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"""Mud"" (2012 release; 130 min.) is the newest film from writer-director Jeff Nichols, who just last year brought us the excellent ""Take Shelter"" thriller (starring Jessica Chastain). As the movie opens, we get to know two young boys, 14 yr. old Ellis (played by Tye Sheridan) and his best friend Neckbone (played by Jacob Lofland), in a small boat on the Mississippi river, on their way to an island where they have found something incredible: a boat that somehow ended up high in a tree. The boys think the boat is abandoned and want to make it their playground, only to find out that someone is living in the boat: Mud (played by Matthew McConaughey). Mud is a refuge of the law for killing a man who got involved with Mud's on-again, off-again girlfriend Juniper (played by Reese Witherspoon). Mud gains the trust of the boys and convinces them to assist him in getting the boat lowered from the tree. We also get to know Ellis' family, as his mom and dad are going through tough times and are contemplating divorcing. This frightens Ellis as it may lead to having to move away from his beloved house on the river. At this point we are not even half-way through the movie. Is Mud really who he claims to be? Will the boat be lowered from the tree? Do Mud and Juniper find true love? Will Ellis find a way to save his house on the river? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: this movie feels like a tour-de-force from Jeff Nichols. Even though ""Take Shelter"" was itself quite good, ""Mud"" feels like a quantum leap forward, both in the writing and the directing. The Mississippi river and surrounding Arkansas landscapes play a huge role in the movie, and at time it all feels quite surreal, or at least there is a sense of magic-realism. McConaughey plays another great role (although for me not quite as career-defining as his role in last year's ""Killer Joe""). But as much as I like McConaughey, the film is stolen by young Tye Sheridan, who acts and has a screen presence far greater than you might expect. In that sense, and as the movie ultimately is more about Ellis than it is about Mud, the movie could've just as easily have been called ""Ellis"". Jacob Lofland in the role of Ellis' friend is great as well. The two boys take up a huge amount of screen time, and hence this movie reminded me of that great movie ""Stand By Me"" from the mid-80s, starring a then young and unknown River Phoenix. Sheridan surely looks to have the talent and the chops to build a long and rewarding acting career.

This movie premiered at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, to generally great acclaim, and for the life of me I do not understand why it has taken almost a year to get the movie finally released in US theatres. The screeing I saw this at this weekend here at my local art-house theatre in Cincinnati was very nicely packed, I'm happy to say. Bottom line, if you are in the mood for a top quality indie movie that is miles away from the standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Mud"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1367625600,270,3113,4.488536155202822
5625617,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"MUD may be the best movie of 2013 through the end of April.  I was thoroughly entertained and captivated from the opening moments until the final shot.  The movie is so well crafted and acted.  It grapples with resonant themes.  This is a small movie that never feels small.  It's as gripping as any blockbuster thriller...yet is told on a small, personal level.

It all starts with a great script by director Jeff Nichols (who also did the outstanding, but leisurely paced TAKE SHELTER).  Nichols is telling a coming-of-age story...and that's about as worn-out an idea as you can think of.  Yet even as portions of it feel as familiar as a Mark Twain novel...it's also never less than fresh and invigorating.  Nichols has packed his script full of serious themes, yet he never forgets to tell a good story.

The story is set in Eastern Arkansas, right along the banks of the Mississippi.  In fact, our hero is Ellis, lives in a houseboat right on the water.  His parents (Sarah Paulson & Ray McKinnon) having a crumbling marriage, and Ellis is feeling uncertain about his place in the world and is worried about the seeming transience of love.  (And the livelihood his dad makes along the river is also endangered; and tied directly to the failing relationship of his parents.)

One early morning, Ellis and his friend Neckbone (yep, that's the name) take a boat out to an island in the middle of the river.  They've heard that there's large boat STUCK UP A TREE.  The boat is there, and there's another surprise too.  Someone is living in it!  The boys meet Mud (Matthew McConaughey), the man on the boat.  He's hiding out on this island, waiting to meet up with his girlfriend Juniper (Reese Witherspoon) and avoiding the men who are trying to track him down and kill him.  This is over-simplifying the situation, but I don't want to spoil it.  Suffice it to say that Ellis is drawn to this strange but charismatic man...and offers to help him because he sees in Mud & Juniper another chance to prove the power of true love.

This only skims the surface of the nuances at play in this movie.  Nichols the writer also touches on Ellis' first love.  He gives Neckbone a peculiar family relationship of his own, because Neckbone is an orphan who lives with his eccentric & magnetic uncle (Michael Shannon).  Even Mud has a peculiar father figure (Sam Shepard) that he has a complicated relationship with.  Thus, MUD is about boys and their fathers as much as it is about boys learning hard lessons about love.

A lot happens in this movie, but not for one second is it complicated or difficult to follow.  Nichols the writer has laid his script out magnificently, and Nichols the director delivers a clear, almost old-fashioned movie.  The cinematography is gorgeous and the land (and river) become a character.  The acting is outstanding.  Characters don't always say what they're thinking, but all the performers show us on their faces what is going on in their hearts.  So many movies these days show blank-faced actors hiding their feelings.  MUD is old-fashioned in that the characters are clearly presented.  The script helps them, but each actor is given room to emote and feel.  This makes for a character drama that grabs hold of the viewer from the opening moments.  I found it to be a beautifully immersive experience.

McConaughey is fantastic.  I've never been his biggest fan, but his Mud is fascinating, frustrating and compelling.  It's easy to see why Ellis is drawn to him.  And young Tye Sheridan (TREE OF LIFE), who is really our guide through the story, is remarkable.  McConaughey will get all the attention, but Sheridan is in the crucial role.  If we don't care deeply about Ellis, the film doesn't work.  And we care VERY deeply about Ellis.  I could almost feel the audience tangibly drawn to him and rooting for him.

And everyone else is terrific too.  Shannon & Shepard are swell (is Shannon ever anything less than interesting?).  Ray McKinnon (SONS OF ANARCHY) is truly compelling as a man who is truly losing his grip on everything he's held dear.  Jacob Lofland plays Neckbone, and is the perfect partner to Sheridan.  These two boys have a deep friendship and we totally believe that these two kids WOULD be close friends...even as they have their differences.

Even as I've sat here writing this review, my appreciation for the film has grown as I've tried to put into words just how and why it works so well.  I simply admired the movie from beginning to end.

It's not perfect.  The female characters are generally unlikeable (even if well performed...Witherspoon is very much cast against type).  The climactic confrontation, terrifying as it is, seems a little like it's from another film.  But these minor flaws only stand out because the rest of the film is so fantastic.  It's been quite awhile since I've been able to recommend a film so whole-heartedly.  See MUD at your earliest opportunity!",1367539200,200,4936,4.74793875147232

5625632,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"RELEASED IN 2012-2013 and written & directed by Jeff Nichols, Mud is a southern gothic crime drama taking place in Arkansas along the Mississippi River where two boys discover a fugitive named Mud (Matthew McConaughey) hiding out on an island and decide to help him evade the authorities & vigilantes that are on his trail in hope of reuniting him with his true love, Juniper (Reese Witherspoon).

This is a film about authentic Southern people and the code by which they live. Urbanized types usually refer to them as rednecks. While some of them may be white trash, most of them are not. Theyre independent of the government, hardworking and respectful citizens, not to mention rooted in Christian morality, although not necessarily Christians. The film respects the intelligence of the viewer, leaving it to him/her to read between the lines. Its similar to Joe, which was released a year later, but not as abrasively pessimistic and is overall better. In tone, its akin to Undertow (2004) and Snow Angels (2007). If you appreciate those flicks, youll like Mud.

There are a lot of gems to mine: Ellis (Tye Sheridan) mirrors Mud as an adolescent. Will he make the same mistakes that brought Mud to his current state? The movies basically a rumination on the potential in both masculinity and femininity for good or bad, but the focus is more on the toxicity of some women, which is refreshing, as Hollywood tends to paint men as evil incarnate or thoroughly inept while women are usually sterling examples of eminent nobility (Why Sure!). The film also reveals the idealization of love and how love is blind. Just because you truly love someone in a romantic sense doesnt mean s/he is good for you and that you should develop & maintain a relationship.

I was never a fan of Witherspoon, but didn't dislike her either. In any case, shes quite good as the seemingly innocent-yet-toxic love interest. Bonnie Sturdivant is excellent as her teenage counterpart, May Pearl; they shouldve done more with her.

THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hour 10 minutes and was shot in Arkansas (Crocketts Bluff, Eudora, Dumas and Stuttgart). ADDITIONAL CAST: Sam Shepard, Michael Shannon, Paul Sparks and Joe Don Baker.

5625724,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"One of the 'new' Matthew McConaughey movies, I find it to be one of the most interesting of all he has done.  It is a strong story told through the eyes of a boy on the edge of manhood.  It captures the flavor of a place, and while most of the acting is great, Mr. McConaughey nails this one, and he creates an amazing character who I love to watch.  Strongly Recommend. There is a shootout near the end that is perhaps somewhat over the top, not done quite as well as the rest of the movie, and there is a scene that shows violence towards a woman that is disturbing.  Reese Witherspoon does what I think is some of her best work as McConaughey's troubled object of desire.

One of the things I especially  like about this movie is is that it starts slowly, and scene by scene, it increases in depth and intensity, until the
somewhat disappointing literally explosive end, followed by just enough hopeful information to make it an exciting, at time disturbing almost always enjoyable watching experience.  I have now seen it three times, and that has only increased my appreciation for the movie, warts and all.",1477958400,,1112,4.502487562189055

The mood, the nature, the characters. Everything just oozes poetry about it. The yound kid is fantastic in this one, as he was in Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life. Even Matthew McConaughey, who I am normally not a fan of, is great.
A great story about love and coming of age.
Masterfully directed by Jeff Nichols

Picture quality: Aside from one or two minor bandings, I wasn't bothered by anything, and it was a sight to behold. The scenery is breathtakingly-gorgeous. Detail fantastic. Contrast nicely dialed in. Colours natural and warm. There are some mindblowingly sumptuous shots in this one.

Audio Quality: Wonderful. Very immersive and rich. Great dynamic range and natural.

Extras: There are plenty to be had, including a director's commentary.
The making-ofs are interesting and informative.

My highest recommendation.

Movie Review:  Matthew McConaughey stars as a more than undesirable individual who has been on the run for many years because of a mistake he made many years ago.  He befriends two young boys who help him to find a way to make his final escape.  I have never seen McConaughey in such a role.  Although he would not be considered approachable in this movie, you can also see the sensitive side of him in his relationship with Ellis and Neckbone.  I really enjoyed this movie and you will two.

Given little scenery with which to be impressed, or a story line that was terribly unique, there was an intriguing, if simple, connectivity between McConaughey, the boys, and Reece Witherspoon and defining love from the perspective of a fourteen year-old, to that of McConaughey who, himself, fell in love with Witherspoon at approximately the same age and has been pursuing that love without much reciprocity on her part,  until the end. Throughout the tension-building series of events it appeared unlikely that anything but a disastrous end could be expected, yet, as only Hollywood (and good writers) can do, all of the main characters leave with a smile, wiser for the experience.

5625847,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"This is a beautifully observed coming of age drama, written and directed by Jeff Nichols that, now and again, teeters on the edge of melodrama but is none the worse for it.  It tells the story of a seminal episode in the lives of two mid-teen friends barely past puberty, when during one summer on, what they believe to be, an uninhabited island on the Arkansas River, they encounter an mysterious stranger, known only by the somewhat unprepossessing name of Mud (Matthew McConaughey).  The boys, Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and the equally oddly named, Neckbone (Jacob Lofland), are persuaded by the romantic allure of the enigmatic Mud to aid him in his bid to escape the clutches of a pursuing band of nasties out to avenge the death of a man Mud has been accused of killing.

McConaughey is at his brilliant best and the two young actors playing the teen-aged friends are a revelation.

Theres an always welcome cameo from Sam Shepherd playing what seems to be his stock character (see also Cold in July) as well as Reese Witherspoon, playing Juniper, Muds long time love and a damsel in a distress largely of her own making.

It recalls, exquisitely, particularly in the Quixotic scraps Ellis cannot seem to avoid on behalf of members of the fairer sex, the bitter-sweet pain of youthful idealism: Neckbone is altogether more pragmatic!

The fateful events of that summer mean Ellis is to grow up quickly.",1448755200,,1403,4.776859504132231

Having travelled these same highways to visit a dear friend in Ward, Ar.....I had to watch rest of movie. I do not like hollywood movies. My preferences range between Blair Witch  Project and 2001. The plot developement was slow at first, gathering background information and charecter development....then of course there are BOATS....how did that cuddy get up in that tall tree on an island in the Mississippi River?

Acting is superlative and the kids in the film were better than one would expect from teeners.  It's a deep story about love lost, found and the dynamics of jealously, betrayal, and survival gave me a new understanding on how elusive love can be even when it is experienced and then lost.  It's restorative drama and penetrate4s deeply into life in the South and Texas values.  Life is hard and being young is even harder!

But I was hoping Ellis would get his chance at banging the one easy teen slut that he ran up and hit the teenage boy over.

But she ended up just being another rude crude easy jocks-only banging slut that broke Ellis' heart with her backseat-on-Friday-Nights threesome-like sexcapades.  And the movie didn't even show That!!

Just hints of Louisiana easy sluts and their tits-and-ass-at-the-bar scenes and one 3-minute action gun-play!  But hey, at least the mocassin pit and the snake bites were interesting!!",1440201600,,626,5.019417475728155

I was surprised Witherspoon's role was so small, but she did a good job. I don't know why I waited so long to see this. There was one minor problem that I saw with the plot, but my boyfriend disagreed. I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen, but I can summarize - there was a character that was at the right place at the right time and had the right skills to help the protagonist at the end and it just seemed a little too convenient. But their acting was so perfect I didn't care. Well done to everyone who worked on this film - props, costume, makeup, writing, photography, set design, sound.

the man says he is waiting for someone, then telling them it's a long
lost love who lives in the nearby town on the mainland.
He's soon asking them to bring him food and parts to help him get the
boat which is currently lodged in a tree, working.
The man tells the boys to call him 'Mud'(Mathew McConaughey)
The boys soon realize that their new friend is on the run and attracting the
attention of both the law and bounty hunters.
'Ellis'(Tye Sheridan) and 'Neckbone' (Jacob Lofland) form a trusting friendship with the stranger and
try to help the man they now know as 'Mud'
Who is this man ? what crime has he committed ?
This for me is the best role I've seen 'Matthew McConaughey play...so far.
a film that tells of trust, truth, fantasy and friendship, a touching tale,
well worthy of a viewing.",1437523200,,871,4.382716049382716
5626534,3,B00BJ0RGCU,Good story....,1437523200,,14,6.5
5626535,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Mud is a coming of age story centering around a boy named Ellis and his friend Neckbone. The adventure begins with the boys piloting a small boat to an island on the Mississippi, where they discover a boat lodged in a tree. They claim the boat as their own, but soon find evidence that the boat already has an occupant. It turns out a mysterious man who goes by the name ""Mud"" lives in the boat. He makes a deal with the boys, first for food, and later for help in restoring the boat. When they agree to help him, they are drawn into a life-changing series of events.
The always excellent Matthew McConaughey anchors the film as the titular character. He's a likeable rogue, and the audience can't help but like him, even though it's almost certain his stories are all lies. His charisma draws the boys into his world. Ty Sheridan plays Ellis, a resourceful, stoic boy who is taking his first tentative steps into manhood. Sheridan plays the role with just the right combination of energy and understatement. He's intense, but also reserved, which works well with the movie's subject matter and setting. He's used to doing things on his own, and was raised to keep his emotions hidden.
Reese Witherspoon rounds out the cast as Mud's love interest Juniper. Like the rest of the cast, she plays her role with a quiet intensity that works well.
The film is well-written, well-acted, and shot in an understated manner that focuses on the characters rather than the plot. It's a great story of a boy's loss of innocence, and well worth watching.",1437436800,6,1540,4.624087591240876
5626536,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Acting was great, especially the two boys in the lead.  There wasn't a false note in any of it.

5626807,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Kind of slow to get started, and infusing the dialogue of the two young protagonists, Ellis and Neckbone (played by Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland), with lots of mild profanity in the first several minutes seemed artificial and contrived. But I hung with the show and discovered a marvelously complex tale of love and betrayal, of bad families pulled together and good families torn apart, and solid character development. Yes, Mud's act of heroism comes as no surprise, but who cares? The cinematography alone makes it worth watching; the revelation of Mud's true quality of character is almost secondary. I've always been ambivalent about McConaughey; no more after watching this. I'm a fan of his work now.",1435363200,,709,5.068376068376068

5626908,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"This is a very well done coming of age film that probably should have been called ""Ellis"" as he is the main character. The picture of Matthew McConaughey on the cover going for his gun with a sinister look on his face is very misleading. Although he does a great job, it's not his film at all. The small town two teenage boys from the wrong side of the tracks dominate the film. The movie is rich with character development and background story that will probably take most people back to that formative year in their lives when so much happened to make us grow up and learn about life. To say this is simply a movie about the boys' relationship with Mud is to minimize everything else that went on. It's almost like you can see the gears turning in their heads and hearts. It's touching and real (although not in a ""I remember that time on the river..."" way that most of us didn't have). It is like watching that point where childhood transforms into adolescence and you can never go back.

5627093,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Mud is the story of 2 young boys who happen upon a strange drfter who is hiding out on an island close to their home. Over time they befriend him, and then slowly learn more about him and how he came to be on the run. Matthew McConaughey plays the drifter named Mud, and does a great job of appearing guarded but friendly as well. This is the role where his natural southern charm really comes in handy. It also works well because you never know whether he's shooting straight with the kids or just making stuff up. The supporting cast is loaded with great character actors like Sam Shepard, Ray McKinnon, and Sarah Paulson. This isn't even mentioning Reese Witherspoon who is delightful as Mud's girlfriend. Yet despite this superb grouping of talent the one who really impressed me was the lead boy, Ellis, played by Tye Sheridan. He delivers such a strong performance, and it feels so genuine to the way a kid his age would react to the things he's going through. You see, while the main action of the film centers around Mud's struggles, this movie is really about Ellis' search for the truth about love. Every aspect of his life is causing him to question what real love is, and if it can last. It's a coming of age story in the truest sense of the word. While I love all the acting across the board, and certainly connected with the characters' struggles, there was something about this story that just felt familiar and predictable. It's a nice film, and if you are a fan of Stand By Me and other films that have that coming-of-age storyline, then Mud is a must. However, I found it to be great at what it was doing, but probably a bit forgettable in the long run.",1432944000,,1671,4.428571428571429

I don't know if the comparison holds up to scrutiny, but that is the memory it sparked.  Overall, it was a calm,solid story about a kid who discovers a mystery in a man he finds hiding out on an island in the river near his house.  There are no glam effects.

Love and lies are intricately woven together to create a film that will have you still thinking about it the next day.  There are so many familiar faces along side McConaughey  that offer some very fine performances.  If you've enjoyed Winter's Bone, I think you'll also enjoy  this movie.  It's not an action packed thriller but a thought provoking piece that examines the many faces of love.  Trust me, you will not waste your time watching this movie.",1431993600,,610,4.635514018691588

5627152,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Clearly, female directors are stating nuances in film that many overlook, and the perspective in this story is fresh. Matt McConaughey is quite good, as you might expect, as are all the other actors involved. The thing that really grabs you is the visual story telling, and the lessons being taught through the information given, shown, and not ""told"". Delivered with Aplomb, and functional, and not a single question about how the characters react, how they did things, and what they thought. Very real in the sense of functionality, and I doubt this film will show up on ""Everything Wrong with Mud in 3 minutes or Less"".",1431993600,,622,4.822429906542056

No one in the story, adult or teen, really knows what true love between two intelligent people is about - starting from the very beginning. The ending is foregone but not before several people are killed with no repercussions.

5627506,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"""Mud"" is the story of two boys, Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland), who come across a man, Mud ( Matthew McConaughey), hiding on a small island in the Arkansas River, a tributary of the Mississippi River. Mud wants the boys to help him reunite with his girlfriend, Juniper (Reese Witherspoon). Mud killed a man who impregnated Juniper and caused her to lose the baby by pushing her down a flight of stairs. The law and bounty hunters are searching for Mud.

Jealousy, betrayal, separation, revenge and violence are prominent themes in ""Mud"". They issue from the main theme, the difficulty in human relationships, particularly the relationship between man and woman, husband and wife, which often starts off so promisingly and hopeful.

Snakes are also a theme in ""Mud"", particularly the Cottonmouth, a poisonous water moccasin. Early in the movie Ellis says, ""I hate snakes."" To which Mud replies, ""That's because God put um here for us to fear."" Later in the movie as Ellis' parents argue while their marriage disintegrates into separation and probable divorce, Ellis' father Senior (Ray McKinnon) accuses his wife and Ellis' mother Mary Lee (Sarah Paulson), of raising Ellis to be ""a snake just like herself.""

In Genesis 3:12 after Adam and Eve fell for the temptation of the Serpent, the Snake, we see the first division in human relationships between the man and his wife: ""The woman whom you put here with me - she gave me fruit from the tree, and so I ate it."" This will eventually lead to murderous violence as Cain kills his brother Abel.

When Ellis and Neckbone first learn that someone else is on the small island where they are hiding a boat, they see a footprint in which it looks like a cross is in the heel of a boot. But Mud eventually tells the boys that he has ""nails shaped like crosses"" in his boots.

Jesus nailed to a Cross has obtained the Grace to heal human beings and repair their sometimes stormy, and even violent relationships.

I thought ""Mud"" was excellent with an exciting climax. How refreshing it is to see an unabashedly Southern story in which the Southerners aren't being portrayed as stupid yokels. Mark Twain, whom ""Mud"" writer and director Jeff Nichols mentions in an extra after the movie, knew good stories could be set in the South. Would that more modern creative people would learn that the South isn't just part of ""flyover country"". Reese Witherspoon, a Tennessee native, touches on this also in an extra, saying, ""There aren't a lot of Southern film makers.""

Texan Matthew McConaughey as Mud is excellent as always. He's now on the A-List, if he wasn't already, after his Best Actor Oscar win for ""Dallas Buyers Club"". But he remains an interesting character actor.",1429833600,,2730,4.8081023454157785

5627530,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"This film was slow paced at times but that did add to its tension near the end involving Mud's plan. This was very much a guy's film.

For me, it's his best performance to date; however, his two young co-stars match him scene for scene. Both Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland are priceless as two teenage boys dealing with friendship, high school crushes, family dysfunction, and becoming adults in an adult world. Writer-director Jeff Nichols directs the proceedings with a sure and methodical hand. Now I want to see his previous two efforts. Last but not least, DP Adam Stone and composer David Wingo provide the perfect visual and aural complements to round out Nichols' story. This movie is a must see.",1428883200,,729,5.083333333333333

The title character is a guy who had formerly lived nearby by is now bring pursued by the police. The town is a strip of dry land alongside of a water way. Mud is hiding on an abandoned boat on an island.  Although he is right on the water and leaves a lot of footprints. The cops are totally mystified. They can't find him even though the two hapless teen age boys find him in the first reel. Apparently these southern cops have no dogs available to them or using blood hounds never occurred to them.

Matthew McConaughey has a good role. He gets to take off his shirt a lot and show off all the work he's been doing at the gym.  This is what they used to call a 'star vehicle' in the big studio days. The whole thing is an artifice built around the needs of its main star.",1428710400,,925,4.099447513812155

McConaughey's ""good ol' boy"" persona works well as the main character Mud and he plays the fugitive-in-love with subtlety and wry humor. Reese Witherspoon is at her trailer trash best as the object of Mud's almost obsessive love. But it's Ellis and Neckbone (Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland) who give the most outstanding performances as the two young boys who discover Mud and slowly learn why Mud is hiding out on an island in the Mississippi River. Although the movie centers around Mud, it's really a coming-of-age story about Ellis and how he learns that hurt and change are a part of growing up.

The movie runs long (over 2 hours) and although the ending is a little drawn out, overall Mud is an unexpectedly good movie.",1427500800,11,873,4.490566037735849

Gal he defended is in town and boys deliver notes to her so she can escape with him but not meant to be as she loves all the guys.  Boys are brave getting black eyes trying to protect her and one boy thinks he has a girlfriend but she publically ridicules him.  One boy's parents are splitting up.

5627987,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"So the kid falls for an older woman who he thinks is his girlfriend after he gets in a fight trying to protect her, yet she stops taking his calls and ignores him completely, especially around her friends and family.

The mom is divorcing the dad and is willing to split up the family because she needs something different. Being very jaded, he continually goes into a diatribe about not being able to trust women

Mud ends up killing a man who was mistreating Juniper, who doesn't even show up at her rendezvous point because she is too busy flirting with another man.

All 3 of the women's characters are all cast in a negative light.

At the same time there is emphasis of brotherhood in this movie. Tom finally comes around when he is most needed, helping Mud at the end.
Ellis and his friend, the movie also revolves around their friendship along with Mud's friendship with boys.

Men are dumb when it comes to women, women can be mischievous, and for men to value your friendships with your guy friends more so than women. They are likely to be on a more solid footing, perhaps and even more fulfilling emotionally. I'm hoping this is not me reading something into the movie that is not there. I have had some bad relationships in my time, but I have some fulfilling ones and I've known both men and women to not be truthful. Just an interesting insight.",1426032000,,1360,4.489878542510121

Some of the things the boys got to do and where and how Mud ended up are not fully explained, so if you are a stickler for detail and reality, you might not like the film that much.  But if you can suspend reality and just go with the action, it's a very enjoyable. tale.  Since what the characters do is not always what is legal and what they ""should"", it is a questionable film for pre-teens and teens, though it is perversely moral, perhaps worthy of family discussion.

I work with ropes, pulleys, cables, and chains.  Mud moving the boat out of the center of the island alone was really hokey.  Is it a law in Hollywood that in order to write a script you must have no knowledge of how work is done, you must love using guns for action, but have no knowledge of how they work or are used, and above all you must firmly believe that the script has to be written so that when things go wrong, the hero must compromise his or her integrity in order to help someone.",1425254400,,704,4.192592592592592

5628391,4,B00BJ0RGCU,Very interesting character study with an unusually subdued MM as a mysterious character discovered by two boys who land on an island while out fishing. A nice contrast between innocence and darkness as the boys are drawn into helping Mud. Quiet and intense.,1424131200,,257,5.0

5628408,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Matthew McConaughey is on a tear with so many great films in the past few years, The New Yorker magazine aptly called the actor's resurgence as McConaissance.

Mud is a coming of age story about curiosity, love, family and hope.

Mud instantly reminded me of  the story Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer. Ellis and buddy Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) visit a secluded island and discover a boat in the tree. They bump into Mud ( McConaughey), who is a drifter and on the run from the law. They strike a bond and he makes them his errand boys to get food, supplies, parts for his boat and to deliver love letters to  his girlfriend Juniper ( Reese Witherspoon) who is waiting for him.
Mud examines the life in the rural belt and how the economy of the river is related to family ties and its health. The father and son love is portrayed beautifully and so is the slow destruction of a marriage.

Director Nichols makes the film look beautiful with visuals and lighting. A lot of credit must go to the young actors who make the film their own with their natural acting. This is great film and although it was a bit too long for my taste, it was worth every minute.",1423612800,,1155,4.403755868544601
5628409,1,B00BJ0RGCU,don't waste your time movie is not good ...McConaughey is a very poor actor in this,1423526400,,83,4.25
5628410,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"Quick Story recap: Rural town USA two boys investigating an island find a man named Mud, played by Mathew McConaughey.  They make a deal to help him in various affairs only to learn the truth about Mud and the world around them.  It's an ok movie. There is some mystery and romance to keep you vested in it.  I think the length was too long at 2 hours and 11 minutes, portions of the movie move at a very slow pace.  Some nice juxtapositions in there with how love is dealt with at different ages of boyhood and at manhood.

Mathew McConaughey was fabulous as usual, he is a great actor. Reese Witherspoon does a good job with the few scenes she had.  The most screen time goes to the two boys, they did ok too. Everyone was believable in their roles, and no one stuck out as being miscast.

The way they let the story unfold about Mud was nicely done and makes the middle and early third of the movie intriguing.  As a whole, it is an ok movie, I don't think I'll feel the need to revisit it but it is high quality production wise. It's  a coming of age, romance, drama. I can see how someone might like this better than me.",1423526400,,1125,4.171296296296297

****SPOILER ALERT****

The story takes place in a hodunk small town centered around 2 young country boys set out to find an abandoned boat they heard about. Arriving on a small offshore island using one of the boy's fathers fishing boat without permission they find the boat high in the trees after a high tide left it there to rot. While searching the boat they discover fresh bread letting them know they aren't the only ones on the small remote island. After meeting Mud, unbeknownst to them a fugitive on the run, they make a deal to bring him food in exchange for the boat once he's gone. One of the boys against the judgement of the other agrees and periodically goes back to help Mud. The young boy, with a big heart and a romantic, feels compelled to help as Mud tells the story of the woman he loves; the woman he's waiting for on the island. Back in town the boys see the girl Mud describes and set out to pass messages between them even after finding out he was wanted for murdering a man who was violently abusing his love.

Turns out the police weren't the only ones searching for Mud. The man he murdered was a well connected business man with a brother and father set on exacting revenge. The brother was in town with his hired hitmen looking and waiting for Mud to appear, while his love was under constant threat. The boys continued to help even as they were in danger feeling like helping true love come together was worth the risks, especially after one of the boys parents were facing a divorce and his way of life being torn apart. They deal changed as Mud needed the boat to escape, so the boys helped him get supplies together and hastily bring the boat back to life. Mud proves his appreciation when one of the boys falls into a pit getting bitten by a snake. He risks it all to take the boy for help. Even though circumstances prove to be more than true love to handle for Mud and his girl, he visits the boy before leaving for good in the middle of the night unaware he's being followed and cornered. After a gun battle, Mud makes his escape while the boys are left to wonder if he survived or not.

While the ending was not really complete or failed to live up to the storyline, I still thought it was entertaining enough to give it 4 stars.",1419897600,,2489,4.369330453563715

5628680,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"I enjoyed it more than my wife did, and I certainly see why so may critics compared it to Huck Finn. The coming of age of the two young teen boys drove the script Mud as a character is a true picaresque one, a rascal, who drives the action and plot but not personal development.

This is a very Southern tale. It is rife with the love of language, story telling in everything, and men overplaying their hands. While the plot line stretches credulity in several pieces (the ex-CIA sniper just happening to live across the river e.g.), the blend of action and dialog don't make you suspend belief too much. It is well paced.

To a family criticism, my wife notes that it fails the Bechdel test, as in women/girls are peripheral and no two female interact meaningfully. Really only three females figure at all  a moderately neurotic mom, a bit of a mean girl teen, and the white-trash girlfriend/love-object. The heavy hand comes after Mud tells the two boys they remind him of himself, and in fact, one is as driven in his idealizing and fetishizing of girls as Mud is of Juniper. That's an ominous forecast.

Acting is top notch. Most of the accents (minus Mud's) are Arkansas passable. The setting and scenery are like additional actors in their presence. It's a fine story well done.",1419811200,,1284,4.593886462882096

5628785,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"This is purely an American classic, just as the cover says. And that ""newly-minted American classic"" line isn't just some blurb to put on the front of the DVD/Blu-ray. This is a wonderfully crafted film, a uniquely unified vision of life, love, and loss. It's richly acted, perfectly cast. The cinematography is brilliant & the locations they chose for shooting lend real grit to the story. This is the film that for me finally cemented Matthew McConaughey's status as a truly brilliant actor, somehow reborn after a string of terrible romantic comedies. I'd had an inkling his career was taking a turn when I saw Tropic Thunder and then his cameo in Eastbound & Down. But it was Magic Mike that really gave me pause--in that film, he was so dedicated the role, so committed to living that character I finally ceased to see Matthew McConaughey as a man who could only play himself. Now, when I saw Mud in theaters I hadn't seen Bernie or Killer Joe (both absolutely brilliant in terms of the his performance and in their totality). But Mud is one of those incredibly rare & unique films where the entire cast and crew seem to have come together in almost perfect unison to form a unity of vision that is simply unparalleled. Everything to the film's pacing, its length--I could go on, but it's perfect. It's funny, it's incredibly sad, it's hopeful, it's full of love. And that's what is so pleasantly surprising about it--it's a story about love wrapped up in a crime drama centered on a mysterious criminal on the run from an equally mysterious past. The two young boys that are essentially the main characters (along with Mud, McCohaughey's titular antihero) were absolutely perfect for their respective roles and act with more skill and aplomb then seems possible for kids their age. But the acting is top-notch from everyone, down to the very last supporting character. Sam Shepard is wonderful, of course. Reese Witherspoon gives a low-key but ultimately heartfelt and solid performance. Michael Shannon is unexpectedly and pleasantly hilarious. It's a uniquely American film that will hopefully, in time, be recognized as a classic, in every sense of the word. For whatever reason, it wasn't recognized within the Hollywood awards-season institution, but don't let that stop you. How can you pass up an artistically brilliant rumination on life & love with the tempo & intrigue of a crime thriller?",1419206400,,2405,4.897058823529412

5628923,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"This is a film that can probably not work as well as it should with a non-American audience. The cultural roots connected to this Mississippi river and to the section at the level of Arkansas have been made famous in the 19th century by Mark Twain, so much that we have forgotten this river along with the original Missouri were and still are sacred rivers for American Indians.

The film is an extremely well done and sensitive version of Huckleberry Finn. Two boys on the river are having an adventure with some kind of an escapee from civilization, wanted by the FBI or State troopers for the murder of a man and having to fight against their own parents, the police, the neighbors and a band of hit men in the form of a private posse that are after that escapee, that outlaw, out of pure vengeance.

The two boys, fourteen years old as for age, are going through an initiation into real life, into adult lying and tall tale telling. They also learn the limits between right and wrong, true and false, under age and of age, immature and mature, in the rough way with a couple of kicks and punches as well as in the soft or sentimental way. Dont you fall in love, boy, because love is not that acme of life they all say it is.

For us, the audience, it is more entertainment than education. We know all that and we know from the very start that Mud is not a very clean and clear man. We know the boys are right and wrong at the same time to trust him. Right for their own maturation (it is by trusting you learn what and who must not be trusted), but wrong because of the pain and sadness they may get out of it. We of course know there is no joy with some suffering somewhere around or after it. We know love is not everlasting and if we want it to last we have to change with time and change our love too.

There is in the mind of everyone, every man or every woman, the illusion that love is at first sight and for life, like Tristan and Yseult or Romeo and Juliet, and we forget that it is true provided we accept this life to be shortened in a way or another. The four heroes I have just quoted die before their old age. If they had been able to live their love through many things would have had to change.

The last remark I would like to add is that apart from the Mississippi river itself the vision we get of the USA is not particularly brilliant: dilapidated areas, crazy and wild aerial wiring, very poor paving and roadways, derelict buildings, all kinds of dumps and salvage yards. There is no beauty in that film, except the Mississippi river twice or thrice in the whole film, for just a short glimpse. Thats what happens when you get off the highways and away from the big cities, and even so in these big cities do not go into the socially dilapidated or ghettoized areas.

We could also note the fate of women in a film that is not exactly trying to depict women. Only one is important, Juniper, and the picture of her is not brilliant. Keep away and keep your hands off her, I would say. She is trouble all along and when she is not causing trouble she is the victim of trouble herself. It always ends badly anyway.

But thats a good film for romantic and nostalgic people who believe, still believe should I say, in the innocence of children. More innocent than I, I die, and yet it would not be difficult to be more innocent and nave than I, but children are not what we thought they were fifty years ago. I said thought because they were not and I seem to remember a lot about the perversions children were confronted too fifty years ago, not to speak of the war before.

5628925,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"I usually really like Mathew McConaughey, but I felt that the plot in this movie was way to dull for even him to liven it up.  The movie started slow, the middle was slow, the climax fell flat, and the ending was disappointing.

  Two poor Mississippi boys, Ellis and Neckbone, find a boat and steal an engine to drive it out to a deserted island.  The action seems like real life.  As a kid I remember doing a lot of dumb things which I thought were amazing because I was just discovering the world around me.  So in that regard, I think that Jeff Nichols, the director, did a good job.  There was nothing magical, nothing unlikely or out of the norm in the film.  Just a couple of kids having what any young boy would consider an adventure.

  There is some conflict because the two boys come from pretty sad backgrounds.  Ellis has parents who are always fighting, and will likely separate, and Neckbone lives with his brain-dead uncle who spends his time diving for oysters.  Neither of the boys really have a parental figure looking out for them, so the catalyst for them wanting to leave their lives and explore the world is relevant.

  They get a boat and head out to the deserted island to explore.  They find another boat lodged high up in a tree, a subject which baffles the boys, but drives them to explore.  They decide to make the boat their new ""fort"".  Upon returning to the island, they find that it is already inhabited by a man called simply Mud.  The boys are instantly fascinated with him, and he feeds their curiosity with wild stories.  There are also myths about him floating around town.

  The boys feed Mud, and make repeated trips to the island.  As it turns out, Mud is wanted by the law.  He came back to their little town to retrieve his old girlfriend who got him in trouble with the law to begin with.  The magic around the mysterious Mud is peeled away, and he is revealed a lovesick, desperate man who would do anything for his love.

  The boys are eventually followed and a stand-off between Mud and a begrudged bounty hunter who isn't on the up-and-up ensues.  The climax is fairly disappointing, however.

  I think Mud had some potential, but the realism of the situation, and cheesy acting from the two boys, made the film boring.  It's hard to criticize it though because the set-up and lack of actual action is due to the fact that the story is closer to real life than a film.

  The film was boring, but I would still have to give it 3 stars because Mr. Nichols didn't romanticize a true adolescent story of adventure.",1418256000,,2563,4.441810344827586

This is one of the best movies we have seen this year, 2014. This movie kept us thoroughly entertained and captivated from start to finish. It was full of twists and turns, love and hate and the good and bad in people.. Q Bert finds Matt ""Mac Daddy"" McConaughey very ""physically  fit"" ,were her exact words. ""Ellis"", Tye Sheridan and ""Neckbone"", Jacob Lofland are very good young actors and we expect to see more from these young men in the future. We highly recommend this film and give it 5 Stars from Stradog and 5 Stars from Q Bert for a total of 10 Stars. If you don't have Amazon Prime, GET IT! .  .",1415318400,,746,4.20979020979021

We stumbled upon this movie and a few others before coming down to this and Jack Reacher.  Both starring amazingly hot men who have recently created some of the best movies.  After Matthew McConaughey's award-winning performance in Dallas Buyers Club I thought this would be anything but disappointing.  The movie starts out with two young boys looking for trouble, and they found just that, Mud, aka Matthew McConaughey.  The rest of the movie is just fucken pointless.  You should skip to the last 20 minutes and I can guarantee you won't have missed a thing.  This will save you time, energy, and mental frustration.  Unless you fancy afternoon naps, by all means set an alarm and do just that.",1414627200,2,831,4.7622377622377625

5629609,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"McConaughey has had a terrific reinvention over the past few years.

This is a combination coming-of-age/fugitive-on-the-run story. The two young boys go looking for danger and adventure in the Mississippi River in Arkansas.  The boys met Mud, played by McConaughey, who's on the run from pretty much everyone. The three decide that they will help Mud fix a boat abandoned during Katrina so that he can make his escape. Along the way, the boys also help Mud communicate with his sometime girlfriend (Reese Witherspoon) and recluse father.

The more the boys help Mud the deeper they get into his messed up, criminal world. The two young actors are convincing in their roles of youths looking for adventure while struggling with adult life drama.

McConaughey shines during his scenes that are helped by his minimal dialogue. Witherspoon is good in her role as a disillusioned, femme fatale who is lost in her life of problems.",1412985600,,926,4.9935064935064934

Working on the outboard engine with no tools to speak of and presumably no spare parts, many people shot at the end with the shooters cruising down the river afterwards with no apparent manhunt on.

I watched it because of the positive reviews, but those reviews are a reflection of how stupid many people are in America. This movie feigns to teach people a little something about life and relationships, but the storyline is utterly ridiculous and poorly acted in many scenes; too easily anticipated in others; and there are so many inconsistencies overall that are distracting and destroy any cohesion in the plot. Worst of all, is things that happen which would or could never happen in real life. Trust me on this one.

First, I'll admit that there are qualities that make it feel very similar to the old standby classic, Stand By Me (based on Stephen King's The Body). And it's not just because one of the young boys is an eerie twin to the young (late) River Phoenix. It's a couple of poor young boys, stealing away from everyday life to do something their families wouldn't approve of. And as Mud, Matthew McConaughey is not in his typical role. He makes a great, somewhat haggard drifter, and though he's a bit mysterious and not exactly the best overall role model, he's great for these young kids. The story weaves around in a twisted tale that gets you mesmerized from the start, and though it's not a fast-moving story, it keeps you enthralled all the way to the end.",1411776000,,919,4.380116959064328

The two young friends were convincing as small town boys who mean well but are also looking for something to give them their own identity as they come of age. Enjoyable movie.

Also the adults in the film don't suspect anything strange with the kids (even though they are taking things) until late in the film.  There are some big plot holes here.

5630147,2,B00BJ0RGCU,"I wanted to like this movie more.  The kids' performance is great, as is the cinematography.  But the directing is bad and so are many other elements of the film.  Spoilers:
The bounty hunters are just retarded.  If they were staking out the girlfriends house then surely they would have bothered to send someone to follow the kid after he keeps showing up there over and over and over again.  And the shoot out at the end is the worst.  They follow the kid from the hospital when the parents take him home.  So they know that there are at least three in innocent people in the house, but then they initiate a shoot out by firing randomly into the house.  I say randomly because they don't see mud through the window and shoot at him.  No, they just start shooting through a wall that has no windows.

Why would these bounty hunters, who significantly outnumber and out gun this poor family all risk going going to jail or prison for manslaughter for randomly shooting up the parents' (who don't know mud, and are not complicit in hiding him) house.  Further, how do they know mud is even in the house to begin with?  (No windows in the room on that side of the house, remember).  If they saw mud come down the river and go to the house, they could have easily confronted or just shot him then and there.

But apparently the director really just wanted a shoot out in the movie, so he forced it in there.

There's other issues with the film as well, but this just tops the list.

Don't have high hopes for a believable plot.",1408320000,,1524,4.351063829787234

And where Mud (McConaughey) came from.  He came from the woods?  And the relationship between Mud and Reese Witherspoon,  the details were vauge.

5630345,2,B00BJ0RGCU,"Mud had the potential to be a great movie. The characters were likeable, the acting was enjoyable, and the setting was very interesting.

But Mud completely dropped the ball on the story and needed some serious editing done to the script before shooting the movie. How is the script broken? Well, the character motivations just don't make any damn sense.

(SPOILERS INCOMING, skip this section if you're planning to watch.)

Why would a 14 year old kid care that Mud wanted to be reunited with his girl Juniper?
Why does Juniper stick around in a hotel room to wait for Mud, yet then goes and makes out with some random dude at a bar only to then burst into tears when Mud breaks up with her?
Why does Mud seem like such a laid back, nice guy when he's supposedly killed people?
Why the hell did they feel it was necessary to throw in a shoot out at the end of this movie?

(END SPOILERS)

In my opinion, the Juniper character was a complete waste of space. She doesn't do anything except get in trouble from time to time and serves simply as a plot device. Her motives are inconsistent with the character and quite frankly, the 14 year old kid shouldn't have given a damn as to what happened between her and Mud. She is completely useless in this film and is 100% unlikeable and not in the ""love to hate"" kind of way. Everything she does completely ruins this movie.

They imply that the ""baddie"" chasing after Mud is some kind of evil dude who has the whole town on his payroll. This totally fails and feels completely unnecessary for the plot. The character is just going to such extremely lengths to capture Mud but I never once got the impression that this was a guy you shouldn't mess with. It just wasn't genuine or believable by any stretch of the imagination. It would have been more interesting of the ""evil"" dude was actually considered a good guy or if the stakes were just a little bit higher. Yes, I know the death of a son is a strong motivator, but it just felt too over the top. It should have just been HIM and none of his cronies going after Mud.

This movie wasn't supposed to be about revenge or violence or crime, but about love. I mean the whole premise was about this kid Ellis learning about love. Love gave him hope that it would keep his family together, get him a girlfriend, and let Mud live happily ever after with his girl. Instead, the film veers off course and changes shape as you're watching it. It seems to be a coming of age, then it becomes a romance, then it becomes a mystery, then it becomes a thriller, and then finally it becomes an action movie.

Quite frankly, they should have just gotten rid of the Juniper character and made this film about a man deceiving kids into helping him escape from the law. Instead, it becomes this huge mess of different ideas that simply don't work.

Yet, for all its faults. Mud is still kind of enjoyable to watch. I personally didn't mind watching it, but my girlfriend felt it was a waste of time.

So it's up to you to decide if you want to sink 2 hours into a movie that doesn't know what it wants to be about.",1407110400,,3092,4.34315424610052

5630369,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Wow ... I was not expecting to like this film, and it blew me away. I particularly loved the atmosphere that exudes from the film -- the murky Mississippi somehow creeps from the screen and into the senses.

So, whats the film about? Its about blindly discovering whom you can trust and whom you cant trust. Whos telling the truth and whos lying? Who are the bad guys and who are really the good guys? And most importantly -- what is real love and whats not? As the film plays out, we discover that the answers aren't always clear, or, what they first appear to be.

Finally, who is Muds true love? It's the one who left it all to run away with him, of course. But, you will have to watch the entire film to see who that is. Ill give you a hint: true love doesnt always come in the packages that we expect.

The acting is excellent by all. The plot is engaging, intertwining and thought provoking. If you're not comfortable with churning undercurrents, this may not be the film for you.

5630457,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Spectacular adventure.  I didn't know what to expect and was blown away!  This is the story I'd imagine Mark Twain telling if he were here today.  Much like Twain himself, this movie captures not only a captivating story, but also fully embraces a place and a culture making them as much a character as the actors themselves.  And the actors do an amazing job of bringing very real characters to life.  Everyone has their motivations, their reasons, their history, and it results in a movie without a single caricature.  An amazing story about what it means to be an adult and the power that love holds over all of us.",1406505600,,618,4.572727272727272

 Everything about this movie is super authentic (i.e., acting, setting of rural Arkansas, story-line, etc.).
 Few movies really capture the essence of morals & values like Mud does.
 I love both of the kids - Ellis is a great protagonist and Neckbone adds a lot of humor.
 And for those of you didn't already notice, Matthew McConaughey has been killing it recently (and it's no different here).

If you're looking for a wholesome drama, look no further - Mud (2012) has all that you need.",1405296000,,560,4.4950495049504955

Matthew McConaughey has the acting chops to pull off Mud as an odd drifter with a past.  Girlfriend Juniper, the adults and the ""bad guys"" are fairly flat characters, but Ellis and Mud are well-rounded and create a good story with tid-bits of moral truths.

His love and protection for his girlfriend played by Reese Witherspoon was a perfect match. Didn't like the way it ended though, with the family getting their home destroyed.

Mathew M gets star billing, but I thought the stars were the two boys who act with him, as well as the Mississippi River and surrounding rural area that acts as the stage for the story.  There is some intrigue and suspense to keep viewers tuned, but there are also the (more) interesting stories of the boys families and challenges of growing up. Really loved the movie and highly recommend.. .....

5630930,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"This was a very unique and entertaining film about two young boys who, while sailing on their own boat, spot a cabin cruiser in a high tree. After this exciting discovery, they take a trip to the small island where the boat is located. Their plan is to claim the seemingly deserted treasure until they encounter Mud on their visit, a strange, disheveled man who has been living on the boat. At first, the younger boy, Neckbone, is very suspicious about this man and becomes very defensive when he learns that Mud is living in the boat in which he spotted. Unlike Neckbone, the older boy (Ellis), shows a fearlessness and trust that is at first, quite concerning for the adult audience. Even after the boys find out that this man is wanted for dangerous activity, Ellis continues to trust and help Mud (much to our initial dismay) while also keeping his whereabouts a secret. Although Neckbone remains hesitant about the situation, he follows Ellis' lead, accompanying him in his risky adventures to help Mud. I don't want to give any more of the story away, as it is quite fascinating to watch it unfold on its own. I can say that it's not your typical movie, which is one of the reasons why I enjoyed it so much. The quality of the acting is also worth noting. Great performances by Matthew McConaughey and the two young boys.",1403827200,,1327,4.579831932773109

5630982,4,B00BJ0RGCU,Well done. Nice change in whats out right now. I've already told a few friends they should watch it. No SPOILERS from me! Just watch it.,1403481600,,136,4.269230769230769
5630983,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"We enjoyed this movie. It was a refreshing break from the typical adrenaline rush movies of late, without being dull or boring.

I also enjoyed the authenticity.  Having grown up in a small town, in a predominately rural area, I believe the movie captured the feel and character of rural America without being condescending, which is unfortunately how most movies treat middle America.

Well done!",1403481600,,397,5.076923076923077
5630984,3,B00BJ0RGCU,Good rainy Sunday afternoon flick. Well acted and directed. Entertaining but not good enough to brag about or recommend though,1403481600,,126,5.35
5630985,4,B00BJ0RGCU,Matt McConaughey Showed why he got the oscar  as best actor. Kids in the movie were better than I expected. All around good movie.,1403481600,,130,4.416666666666667
5630986,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"I really loved this story. A wonderful cast and interesting plot. The ""behind the scene"" life lesson is very real and absorbing. The molding of a young man by lessons learned and hints of what to expect in life is wonderful. Hidden meaning are not so hidden. What life boils down to is what is learned from others mistakes.",1403481600,,323,4.491525423728813

5631002,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"I thought that the front, center, middle, every angle would be wrapped around Matthew McConaughey.  It was not.  It's actually a story about a young boy coming of age and a man coming of age as well.  The movie is solid from beginning to end.  It's not going to keep you on the edge of your seat but it will keep you in your seat through the end.  Very well done!",1403395200,,363,4.056338028169014

5631005,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"A classic American movie focusing on self-reliance/hard work/toughness, and the fight for the American dream. It is the perfect anti-liberal movie.",1403395200,,147,6.0476190476190474
5631006,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Yes the movie is not an action packed thriller, but it's not suppose to be, it was a very good movie.  I watched it with my wife and we both loved it and thought it had a lot of character.  The Two boys were fantastic and Matthew was awesome as usual.  Reminds me of sort how Slingblade is as a movie.  Don't hesitate to watch this movie",1403308800,,337,3.985074626865672
5631007,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Theres been quite a bit of press and hype about this film, and I think much of it is well deserved. Mud revolves around a coming of age theme of one young boy, Ellis (played by Tye Sheridan). It involves two Ellis and another boy, Neckbone, befriending a man, Mud (played by Matthew McConaughey), who they discover living on an island. Mud has an appropriate name; he seems to be gritty in every sense, and seems to be a drifter hiding out from something. Mud tells them his in need of food, and makes a pact with the two boys to give them the boat if they will bring food back to the island. Ellis is willing to do this, but along the way the boys find out information about Mud that Mud hadnt told them. Muds life is in danger, and he has a few secrets in his past. The action revolves around the boys efforts to reunite Mud with a long time love and also protect him from those out to do him harm.

There are many thinking points in Mud, one of which is Ellis trying to understand the idea of what constitutes love. Ellis experiences a crush, and he connects his hopes of romance with that of Muds first love Juniper. Another point explored is simply the importance of trust and friendship. Bonds are not easily formed, but Mud is a central character in understanding what loyalty means.

Over all, Mud is a very impressive film, one with beautiful scenery and cinematography as well as believable characters. It has a quiet mood that builds to quite a finish. The central characters (Mud and Ellis) become characters who you want to root for, and you become invested and interested in their fates.",1403308800,,1601,4.423728813559322
5631008,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"A good clean movie for the whole family.  Suspenseful, dramatic storyline kept me glued to the screen. I would recommend this movie to all my friends and family.",1403308800,,161,4.75

5631010,4,B00BJ0RGCU,enjoyed Matthew McConaughey as usual.  Interesting and moving.  A little too much killing in the end.  Could have done with out that.,1403308800,,133,4.954545454545454
5631011,5,B00BJ0RGCU,This is a awesome movie. Matthew mcconaughey is great. and so are the two boys in the movie. I do think this movie should of been called ellis cause it is more about him then mud. the kid stole the movie. the acting and the directing is amazing. and the story is great. I liked how they filmed the whole thing in Arkansas. this is a good movie. I have not seen to many mat mconaughey movies but when I do I like them. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do,1403308800,,473,3.9375
5631022,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"Interesting, but not much joy to be found here. I finished it only because I wanted to see a nice outcome.  Didn't happen, unless you consider a fugitive escaping the law and vigilanties to be a dose of happiness.",1403222400,,213,4.461538461538462

5631024,3,B00BJ0RGCU,I felt the story was a bit weak and not too realistic.  The children were good little actors and I enjoyed watchig them.  Maybe not my kind of movie.  It was log and a little slow.,1403136000,,180,3.9444444444444446
5631025,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"Not bad.  Wouldn't watch it again.  Story leaves you hanging a little.  But if you like stories that can show you how evil and full of hate humanity can be, then this is for you.",1403136000,,178,4.0285714285714285

5631030,2,B00BJ0RGCU,not much happens the whole movie. And most of what does happen is very predictable. Just not a good movie.,1403136000,,106,4.35
5631031,3,B00BJ0RGCU,Good Movie. Foul language not for younger kids. Interesting yet a bit elementary. I would recommend this movie for a cheap date.,1403049600,,128,4.863636363636363
5631042,1,B00BJ0RGCU,Don't want to listen to 9 year old kids cussing every other breath. Turned it off when that started after the first scene.,1403049600,3,122,4.3478260869565215

5631045,3,B00BJ0RGCU,Mud is a very good Saturday Night Movie to watch. Entertaining without being predicable.  A good family movie to watch.,1403049600,,119,4.95

5631047,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"McConaughey doesn't usually appear in this sort of movie as a dirty red-necky sort of guy. Neither does Reese Witherspoon usually play that sort of role. However, I really enjoyed this movie and its message of hope for all us rednecks.",1403049600,,235,4.7560975609756095

5631051,4,B00BJ0RGCU,Matthew McConaughey is one of Hollywood's best actors.  He brings depth and dimension to any role he plays.  Mud is a study of humanity and emotions.  I highly recommend watching this movie.,1403049600,,190,4.875
5631052,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"This is a really well put together movie.  It keeps you very interested all the way through, and I will leave it as that not to spoil it for anyone who has not watched it...  A must see.......",1402963200,,192,4.026315789473684

5631054,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"I think Mud should have died at the end to kick up the emotions. I am not sure what the next to last scene of underwater fishing with Neckbone's stepfather wearing a metal diving helmet shining bright lights into the bottom of the river was about,if not to discover Mud's body- maybe there was a last minute change in plot. The rest of the movie as many others have stated, was great. Though Mud's girlfriend, Juniper's thoughts were understated in the movie, but maybe this movie was intended to show a man's perspective of relationships. I appreciated that Ellis attitude and behavior in male-female relationships was a reflection of Muds way of thinking that got both Mud and now Ellis into trouble. But at the end, Mud seemed to becoming a good father figure to Ellis,not only when he saved his life, but just before the shooting scene when he told Ellis not to fear marriage because he was a good man and would find a good woman. At the end, Mud reconciled with his stepfather as did Ellis with his.",1402963200,,1004,4.552486187845304
5631055,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"This was a very good movie. Kind of a ""Stand By Me"" with an Arkansas southern twist. Matthew McConnahottie must have been in full unbathed character, for I don't know how else, for the entire movie, Reese W. could've stayed more than 50 feet away from the love of her character's life ;-) It was well worth watching.

5631059,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Mud was not what I was expecting going into the film. That being said, that is a good thing. I really enjoyed the film. The acting is well done, the story is different, but hooks the viewer early on, and kept me invested in the characters until the end.

5631073,1,B00BJ0RGCU,"If eleven-year-old little boys with no sign of pubescence whatsoever are running around after dark talking about girls' ""titties,"" and asking whether they've ""got any,""  it is because we have taught them to do so. It is most certainly not because their bodies are telling them so.  Movie makers and movie watchers have better things to do than give children the impression that their world revolves around sex.  Childhood should be sweet and beautiful.  Our adult addiction to sex and violence is robbing our children of that.  Matthew McConaughey, as a devoted father, should know better.",1402876800,,589,5.09375

He must have quit smoking, because he never lights up again and doesn't ask the boys to bring him a carton.

5631154,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Matthew McConaughey has really shown versatility in the past year or so, and Mud is no exception. A bit like Stand By Me, the tale follows two boys who come of age as they help a drifter they discover on an island.",1402444800,,214,4.119047619047619
5631155,5,B00BJ0RGCU,Enjoyed this movie and the characters.  Not a huge storyline.  Great for a relaxing evening with friends and buttered popcorn!,1402444800,,126,5.25

5631158,4,B00BJ0RGCU,A nice story of the hopefulness of young people... friendship and love. Also a beautiful showcase of the river community in the South.,1402444800,,134,4.869565217391305
5631159,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"It reminded me a little of Stand by Me.  Watched the whole thing without so much as moving.

5631182,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"I watched this because I love Matthew ! But this movie was a let down....it really didn't capture my attention. If it weren't for the fact that I like the lead actor, I would've turned it off.",1402444800,,192,4.216216216216216
5631183,5,B00BJ0RGCU,It's a thrilling coming of age story of two young boys learning about trust and love in a difficult way.,1402444800,,104,4.25
5631184,1,B00BJ0RGCU,It was a very slow moving movie with nudity and violence which dragged on and on. After one hour we gave up watching it.,1402444800,,120,4.041666666666667

5631186,4,B00BJ0RGCU,This was a good movie.  Not a whole lot of action but more of a story.  The children in it were great and it was not the typical Matthew mcConaughey movie.,1402444800,,155,3.967741935483871

5631188,3,B00BJ0RGCU,It was ok. Kind of disappointed with all the good actors that were in it. The content was rather slow moving and a little boring. The theme about love was good though. Didn't keep me on the edge of my seat.,1402444800,,206,4.048780487804878
5631189,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"A very different kind of movie, but I think that is one of the reasons I like Matthew McConaughey so much.  It seems he is willing to tackle anything.  The premise -- fugitive hiding out, is run of the mill -- but the interaction with the two young boys and winning their trust was the best.  I would recommend this movie to anyone, but especially an MM fan.",1402444800,,358,4.235294117647059
5631190,5,B00BJ0RGCU,i love this movie.  the 2 young actor's have incredible talent.  this movie is  character driven and the plot stays interesting.,1402358400,,128,5.0
5631191,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"The driving force behind everything in this film, love.  Love between friends, family members and romantic love, and though the paths love leads the characters down are arduous ones, it all seems to be worth it through the lessons they learn.  Happy I watched it!",1402358400,,263,4.822222222222222
5631222,2,B00BJ0RGCU,It is a long overextended movie. The events are slow. It could be twice shorter what would make the movie more interesting. Good actors play though.,1402358400,,148,4.730769230769231
5631223,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Lead actor was great, played the part well.  The two young boys played great roles.  Story portrayed life in a different world that

5631224,1,B00BJ0RGCU,We were completely disappointed. We like Matthew McConaughey but this movie was not entertaining and did not hold our interest,1402272000,,126,5.35
5631225,4,B00BJ0RGCU,I showed this movie to high school seniors for English class as an example of the elements of the hero's journey (as set forth in the Campbell text The Hero with a Thousand Faces (1949).  My classes were very receptive to the narrative and the cinematography.  A movie that can capture the attention of seniors in June is something pretty extraordinary!,1402272000,,353,4.770491803278689
5631226,4,B00BJ0RGCU,This is a good movie.  I just thought it seemed slow moving in parts.  Mathew McConaughey is excellent in this role. Nice ending.,1402272000,,129,4.565217391304348
5631227,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"But not bad.  I watched it in segments, while I was at work, and enjoyed it.  Would recommend tentatively, I guess.",1402272000,,115,4.428571428571429
5631228,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"Ok movie. Not a typical movie for Matthew. Interesting at times, and boring at others. Almost lost me to sleep.",1402272000,,111,4.6
5631229,5,B00BJ0RGCU,Grungy Matthew McConaughey excellent in this movie: all wrong but still likable. The young boys were great. I almost didn't recognize Reese Witherspoon.  this was a different role for her and gave me a better look at her acting ability.,1402185600,,236,4.9
5631230,5,B00BJ0RGCU,Great movie! This movie has characters that believe and trust. Loyalty plays into the movie. Morals is there. I learned to not seek revenge and you will see what happens in the end.,1402185600,,181,4.515151515151516
5631231,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Great movie, acting outstanding by McConaughey, and his two young costars.  Movie takes you back to the summers of your childhood, much like ""Stand By Me""

I think it wouldbe enjoyed by teenagers up to seniors.",1402185600,,210,4.805555555555555

5631254,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"This is a beautiful story and a beautiful movie in many different ways. The story is beautiful because it is shown through the eyes of a young boy who wants to believe in love but his faith that love actually exists is slowly crashing and falling apart. This story captures his innocence of hope clashing with his realization of the pain that is in the world, and that in my opinion, is a beautiful thing. Concerning the other characters, they are a strong addition to the story and have a story within themselves (the mother is fighting for respect from her husband and she is such a strong character). The elements of  the movie are well done too. From the acting (some of my favorite scenes are between the parents and the boy) and the directing obviously as well since the movie flowed so nicely. The script, again I will mention, was wonderfully written. I hope to see more movies by the screenwriter.",1402185600,,906,4.558282208588957
5631255,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Pretty good story, good acting by all the main players. Matthew McConaughey was on the path to big time recognition with this performance. I don't get into the plot as everyone else dose, I give an option if the movie is worth watching. This suspense drama is well worth your time, takes place in the bayou. I give it a solid 4 stars. I will always tell it like I see it and this one is worth your time and money. A keeper.",1402099200,,423,4.108433734939759
5631256,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"At first I struggled to understand the dialog thru the accents.  Patience...the movie bloomed into a multilevel experience  of visual, cultural, and psychological drama.  Highly recommended to my thoughtful friends.",1402099200,,215,6.1
5631257,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Enjoyed movie, had my doubts at first.  Leaves you wondering about whether younger boy will be hooked on protecting girl in the future the same way - with or without love in return?",1402099200,,181,4.484848484848484
5631258,3,B00BJ0RGCU,Predictable.  It was fine for a rainy Saturday afternoon. The young actors were good.  Ms. Witherspoon walked through that role.,1402099200,,128,5.35
5631259,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"This film will keep your attention, not only with Mathew McConaughey and his co-star's superb acting, but also with an intense script that looks deep into the troubled souls of those living in Bayou Country.  It has the requisite ingredients for a great film, love, violence, sex, revenge, and more.  I found the ending a wee bit unsatisfying however, thus the four stars.  Regardless I can recommend this movie.  It's well worth your time.",1402099200,,440,4.905405405405405

5631273,5,B00BJ0RGCU,This is an independent beauty -- a heartwrenching yet heartwarming story -- but as classic as To Kill a Mockingbird. You really get involved in each character's story.,1402012800,,167,5.0
5631274,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"This a story about learning and love. It's about growing up and realizing the world is not as idealistic as you once thought. A good combination of comedy, drama, and action, I enjoyed Mud and watched it in a few sittings so I could extend my enjoyment of it. If you'd rather sit and feel than sit and think, this is a movie for you. That's not to say there aren't any philosophical questions addressed by Matthew Mc. and the gang, just that I haven't quite decided what they are yet.",1402012800,,484,4.329670329670329

5631277,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"I really liked the two young boy actors coming of age. They were eager to be friends and learn about life. Interesting friendship development between Mud and themselves. Jolene's character was weak and sappy. I would not recommend this movie to anyone,  but it was interesting. the boy actors were great.",1402012800,,304,4.96078431372549

When two boys (one actor  ""Neckbone"" remains me so much of a Rivers Phoenix) discover a man hiding out on an island in the river, their whole world becomes energized with adventure. The acting is superb, the regional dialects are spot on, and a story so believable. I don't want to say much more, other than I highly recommend this film.",1401926400,,397,4.513888888888889
5631283,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"good drama, realistic. good characters - not too good, not too bad (evil) just ordinary people who make mistakes. Too many movies these days think you gotta have sensational characters and lot of shoot-em-up, bang-bang or FX to be good movies. I thought the kids' involvement was handled well, too.

5631285,3,B00BJ0RGCU,Don't get me wrong...the story line was good but very predictable and because of that it moved a little slow for me.  I have to say that the actors were all fantastic and completely submersed in their character to make them believable.  I wouldn't hail this movie as being fantastic...but I liked it and certainly wouldn't discourage anyone from seeing it.,1401926400,,356,4.819672131147541

5631358,4,B00BJ0RGCU,A few swear words but any more a decent family movie.  I liked the premise that 2 kids were helping out a person in need even though he was in trouble.  They saw through all of the fluff and wanted to help anyway.,1401667200,,213,3.9302325581395348
5631359,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"This was a great movie.  Highly recommend.  Good plot, surprise ending.  Excellent acting.  Sorry we missed it at the theater but got to see it in the comfort of our own home.",1401667200,,175,4.375
5631360,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"This movie has a nice feel and good acting.  It's good to see a movie that has a real plot and doesn't rely strictly on action and special effects.  However, the story has some predictable elements.  With certain shots or lines you just know its a set-up for something coming later.  The ""action packed"" sequence near the end is also a bit unrealistic in such an earthy, real feel film.",1401667200,,386,4.4714285714285715
5631381,5,B00BJ0RGCU,The actors were realistic. Women were beautiful. Scenery was great. Hope to see more movies like this. Snakes could have been a bit more realistic.,1401667200,,147,4.92

5631386,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"I wish writers could write parts that don't require actors to smoke.  In this day and time,  it seems a little out of place.  Maybe I'm just unrealistic, but I don't think all poor white trash smoke. Why is it that the bad boys came from Texas?  Seems like Louisiana would have been a better mafia stereo type.

It was nice to see that Matthew could do more than cheap comedy entertainment.  True love ""or the misconception of it"" always brings out the best or worst in us. The story line toward the end was a little sketchy. The two young boys played their parts exceptionally also.  See no reason to watch it again.  With great movies (The Notebook), I watch again and again.  Once was enough on this one.",1401580800,,707,4.376923076923077

5631402,2,B00BJ0RGCU,This moving was ok but it lacked luster. We saw the 4 star and thought with Matthew McConaughey it would much more.  Good story line but dragging!,1401494400,,146,4.407407407407407
5631403,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Matthew McConaughey is an excellent actor and he shines in this underrated movie!  The story is slow moving at times but the interplay between Ellis, Mud and Neckbone is so touching and true of their lives that you pull for them right to the end.  It is a ""coming of age"" movie that speaks to so much that could be overlooked if one isn't retrospective.  Well known supporting actors are so good that you believe they are who they say they are!  This may not be a movie for everyone but I sure liked it.",1401494400,,503,4.2631578947368425

5631433,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"This was just a fun movie. Good story. Good acting. Real characters. Reminded of when movies were often well-made and fun; in other words, it was like a old movie in many ways. Hard to find anything worth calling a movie these days with stupid, rude, and crude taking control of most movies. If not outright stupid, then modern movies lack story, meaning, and character development. Either fast nothing action or stupid depictions. Time to read more. Takes too many movies to get to a decent one like this.",1401494400,,506,4.696629213483146

5631436,4,B00BJ0RGCU,I watched this movie with my 12 year old and we both enjoyed it.  It was a little slow at times but a good age appropriate movie for around 13.,1401408000,,143,3.7666666666666666
5631437,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Mud is unlike most movies. The main character is named Mud played by Matthew McConaughney as a down is his luck drifter who comes upon a boat in need of repair lodged in a precarious position on a deserted island in the Mississippi River.

Two local Arkansas river boys also claim the boat when they come across the shabby Mud.

Mud is a mystery, who will claim the boat?, will Mud reunite with his ex girlfriend played by the beautiful Reese Witherspoon and who is the shadowy Tom (Sam Shepard) who refuses to help Mud?

Mud is well done, with enough action to keep you interested from beginning to end.",1401408000,,604,4.472727272727273

The story line is well done. A man in blind love who makes bad decisions for the right reasons.",1401408000,,209,4.225
5631439,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Splendid performance by the cast!
My only complaint would be it was a tad slow.
But great plot, dialogue and cinematography.",1401321600,,124,4.9523809523809526
5631440,5,B00BJ0RGCU,Great movie.  Talented actor!  Nice to see him NOT being this sex symbol.  Great acting.  Kids are great actors too.,1401321600,,116,4.65
5631451,4,B00BJ0RGCU,McConaughey and Ellis were magnificent in this movie and were on top of there game in this down south adventure. just loved the ending,1401321600,,134,4.625
5631452,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"I liked the movie, my wife thought it was a bit slow. There are some deep connections that are realistic and possibly missed if merely looking to be entertained. I wouldn't buy it, I wouldn't watch it multiple times, but I would watch it again in the future.",1401321600,,258,4.395833333333333

5631454,4,B00BJ0RGCU,Very good sudo-love story.....or rather a lesson in love for both the young and old at heart.  Mathew never fails to present a good show.,1401321600,,137,4.48

5631459,3,B00BJ0RGCU,This movie was an overall kind of bleak and pretty slow moving movie. I wouldn't want to watch it again.,1401321600,,104,4.25
5631460,3,B00BJ0RGCU,We enjoyed the movie and we appreciated the acting. Maconahay is very good in almost any role.  It was an interesting story any an interesting view of Southern Swamp culture.  Good entertainment?,1401321600,,195,5.0625
5631471,4,B00BJ0RGCU,There was a great deal of swearing by the boys in this film.  I am always disappointed with this when watching with my family. Otherwise it was a good movie which kept our attention. Matthew McConaughey is always great!,1401321600,,219,4.615384615384615

5631476,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"It was fun to relive my youth, exploring wild places and finding cool things despite the warnings of my parents to stay out of there!  There was little profanity, violence and some nice scenery.  I would recommend it.",1401235200,,217,4.684210526315789
5631477,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"This is a great movie for people who love Matthew McConaughey. It is very reminiscent of Huckleberry Finn with two young boys befriending a fugitive on an island. Unfortunately, this movie, while having an adventurous story-line, does leave the viewer feeling unsatisfied because some elements seem to be missing. It attempts to be dramatic at the expense of deeper character development and elements of fun that the movie needs to keep it from seeming boring. The elements of adventure are all there, however. So, those looking for a more dramatic movie will probably be pleased with the results. Personally, I would have given it 3.5 stars if that option had been available, but it definitely was better than a 3-star movie for me.",1401235200,,733,4.967479674796748
5631478,5,B00BJ0RGCU,I was so very pleasantly surprised by this movie - it hadn't received the accolades that McConaughey's other work for the year did but it was equally enjoyable. The boys are wonderful and really steal the show.,1401235200,,210,4.702702702702703
5631479,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"I thought it was a good movie, but a bit slow at times. Matthew looks different with his teeth. The main young boy character did a great job. I would recommend it.",1401235200,,163,4.125
5631480,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Admitted McConaughey fan. He does a great job in the role and the two boys do a great job as well! A bit long, however, the underlying storyline and message are strong.",1401235200,,168,4.28125
5631501,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"A very strange story in an unusual environment. You know from the beginning how it all will end, but it is enjoyable getting there.",1401235200,,131,4.5
5631502,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"This is a modern day Huckleberry Finn kind of story..... predictable, but good for a dull evening. I wished Matthew McConaughey would wash off some of the grime, but the movie is called ""Mud"", so I guess that explains it.",1401235200,,221,4.55
5631503,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Good love, bad love and in between.  Disappointment and redemption.  Pretty good, even if a little cliche--but what love story isn't?",1401235200,,133,5.285714285714286

5631505,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"Acting is good but the story drags on and on. Not very entertaining. Not sure what the overall message of this movie is, if any. Clear as mud.",1401235200,,142,4.107142857142857
5631506,4,B00BJ0RGCU,Kept my attention the whole time- intriguing to watch. Makes you think about things and try to make connections. I'd recommend,1401235200,,126,5.0476190476190474

5631510,3,B00BJ0RGCU,It was okay. It could have been a lot better. The story didn't delve into the main character's past. There were a lot of missing pieces.,1401235200,,136,4.269230769230769

5631523,2,B00BJ0RGCU,"Felt as if they were trying to make today's version of ""Stand By Me"".  Only this time with 2 pre-teen boys that get into some trouble by trying to find ""the boat"" not the body as the former.  Was very slow...McConaughey a fugitive kept saying his shirt was one of two most important things...so we knew with all the shirt chatter it would come off eventually and well, it did.",1401235200,,376,4.357142857142857
5631524,5,B00BJ0RGCU,I liked this movie because it was very different and very well done.  Amazing job by Mathew McConaughey and the two awesome young boys.,1401148800,,135,4.625

5631528,4,B00BJ0RGCU,This movie made me miss being a kid and running off into the woods; doing things we would get in trouble for,1401148800,,108,3.9545454545454546

5631544,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Matthew McConaughey is fantastic in this movie. I highly recommend! Very representative of the South where my children were born. It wasn't too hokey, it was just right. The story line was believable and engaging! Loved!",1401148800,,220,5.138888888888889

5631546,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"My title could have just as easily been the title of the film. McConaughey does a fine enough job portraying the title character, but this film seemed to be more about Ellis and how he learns some important life lessons as his parents gradually move toward divorce, Mud and Juniper grow farther apart, and both couples finally go their separate ways. Ellis's so-called girlfriend also teaches him some realities about adolescent love, and how it's not as idealistic and chivalrous as Ellis has it in his mind.
The young man portraying Ellis really carries the movie.",1401062400,,566,4.90625

5631549,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"I didn't think much of this movie until I watched it. The story line is simple but keeps you guessing right up until the end. And then you are still guessing... This was a ""watch at least twice"" type of movie. From a person who is not into movies I would and have told friends to watch MUD",1401062400,,289,4.0
5631550,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"McConaughney really steps out of character and leaves his "" handsome and charming boy next door type"" to play a bedraggled man on the run.  The two boys who befriend him lead lives that give us a glimpse into life on the river and show us how friendships can take many forms. It is a slow moving movie, but it will keep you engaged all the way to its conclusion. I think it is worth investing some of your time in watching it.",1401062400,,426,4.132530120481928
5631561,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"The filming itself is extraordinary at creating mood with the camera work. The music often elevates the mood. The actors are superb in conveying a culture that has high expectations of justice and honor. The children, especially, are superb; though I cannot think of a single weak performance. The thing I like best about this film is the underlying theme of love. rather than take the easy way out and make a breezy Hollywood film about love, we are presented with a challenging context for the subject of love. Characters are consistently pulled by their ethical belief of what love should be in directions that reek of purity even as they demand violence. This is seen not only in the main character, Mud, but also in Ellis, his parents, and ultimately the assassin. Levels of meaning, nuance, and artistry are there and that makes the film worthy of watching multiple times.",1401062400,,878,4.821192052980132
5631562,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"McConaughy was right on the money with his portrayal of this ambivalent and unreadable character!  However telling the story through the eyes of a 14 year-old boy was both a strong point and weakness. It lent to the understandable search for right v. wrong and swells of emotion at the unfairness of life, the joys of being loved. But it also seemed to drive you towards the somewhat predictable ending of Mud a little too ""pat"".  Still, not everything is explained and you could use your imagination to fill in the blanks as you see fit.

I'm not sure if there was a moral to the story, which I am not always looking for but with the talk about love and what not I didn't feel like I took away anything.

I didn't think the acting was anything special, although I liked all the actors.
Story was good, although I had the feeling it was based on a book that I hadn't read, like there was more to the story then was told.  My GF is from the south and I think it rang truer to her than it did to me.  As if this wasn't all that far fetched of a story.

I would probably be giving this movie a 5, were it not for the fact I found it to ""drag"" in certain moments. The young performers were exceptional, as well. Reese Witherspoon's talents seemed rather wasted in the film. All in all, a movie worth watching.",1400976000,,347,4.8

I remember the very first film I'd ever seen him, because I love all of the books from John Grissom, that when I heard about the movie I had to see it. I knew who Sandra Bullock was and never saw anything of hers to date, that I didn't like, and I wanted to see if the film would follow the book or butcher it as sometimes happens. The film was awesome, Matthew, was a wonderful as the attorney for the father of the young black girl who had been murdered, but not before being raped and tortured, and been left tied naked to a tree if memory serves by some white supremacists/dumber then a sack of rocks, bunch of deliverance types, that would never possess the wrongness of their actions to a little,very young black girl.

McConaughey always does a great job with his characters and he did not fail in this movie.

A strange juxtaposition of moral templates.  What's right and wrong to different people, how they get what they want at the expense of others sometimes.  Then, other times, they sacrifice themselves for someone out of loyalty.  Essentially, the movie is about two boys.  One boy is an orphan whose parents are dead,  being raised by his drifter/diver brother.  The other boy is in crisis, his parents are splitting up--which will result in the father losing his livelihood on the river because that spot belongs to the mother.  The boys go out to a sandbar type island to stake their claim on an old boat in a tree--where they meet up with Mud . . . a man on the run from the law.

5631725,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"It was nice to see a movie about folks in Arkansas that was actually filmed in Arkansas.  Matthew McConaughey portrays Mud, a man involved in a very complicated and obsessive relationship with Juniper (played by Reese Witherspoon).  Viewers are introduced to Mud when two young boys (Ellis and Neckbone) boat to one of the many islands that dot the Mississippi river along the Arkansas line.  Mud, Ellis and Neckbone soon develop a friendship and the boys help Mud by bringing him food and supplies.  The plot is well paced.  A lot of movies spend 3/4 of the screen time either developing the backstory or developing the characters so all you get is about 1/4 of the screen time that actually deals with the plot which all too often is wrapped up in a big hurry.  This movie develops the backstory, the characters and the plot simultaneously so you aren't cheated out of anything.  Nothing suffers because of drag.  I loved everything about the movie.  The scenery, the characters, the plot, the performances and the ending.  Great movie and can be watched by all ages.",1400371200,,1069,4.760869565217392

5631746,4,B00BJ0RGCU,This is the story of a seemingly strange man who is befriended and helped by two boys. The movie is very entertaining and the characters keep your attention.,1400198400,,157,4.642857142857143
5631747,4,B00BJ0RGCU,your rules are tired & I don't have time for all this. the product was as advertised. nuf said! OK,1400198400,,98,3.95

5631749,5,B00BJ0RGCU,The kids in this movie remind me of the kids we see here in Arkansas every day living on the river. Great movie...,1400198400,,114,4.0
5631750,4,B00BJ0RGCU,Mud was a movie which depicted a simple life along southern rural river communities.  It was a mix of madcap adventures easily believed to have occurred in characters every day life.,1400198400,,182,4.870967741935484
5631761,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"The movie wrap up was... weak.  It was exciting, but the movie might have been better with something more anti-climactic and predictable.

The two boys do a great job - and I guess partly because they are locals.  The writers leave a lot unsaid about how people live and interact in the movie but it comes through with just a little attention paid.

And hey, a McConaughey movie with a plot device to make him keep his shirt on... heck, that makes it worth while right there!",1400112000,,475,4.425287356321839

5631763,4,B00BJ0RGCU,This movie was a really nice surprise.  I expected a typical bang bang shoot em up flick and instead it was more a coming of age story of a young boy and a story of relationships and all the strange forms it can take.  In other words this movie has a really good story line that's more than just some superficial eye candy imagery.,1400112000,,331,4.15625

I enjoyed the movie so much that I watched it three times.",1400112000,,336,4.524590163934426

5631770,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"The two young boys that were friends in the film acted their age, and were good actors.

5631798,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"The boys who starred in that did a great job selling their parts as did MM.  In my opinion I don't like how it portrayed a cold criminal as a the good guy.  I hated MMs character and was waiting and hoping for is demise. To have young boys look up to that kind of thinking, that mind set made me question the movie as a whole, but still it kept my attention.",1400025600,,358,3.8904109589041096
5631799,5,B00BJ0RGCU,This movie is well worth renting and watching. The storyline keeps you involved and interested. The setting and actors are well chosen. I just decided to watch it with not looking at reviews and was very glad I did. A child's curiosity to give Mud a second chance to tell his story was well written.,1400025600,,299,4.454545454545454

5631822,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"Young actors do a great job. McGonaghey's character is dark but likable. Witherspoon part is very small, but her role is the plot behind the movie. Okay as movies go .... Another McGonaghey image change.",1400025600,,203,4.828571428571428
5631823,2,B00BJ0RGCU,"How did you get McConaughey, Witherspoon, Sam Shepard and Joe Don Baker to do this movie anyway? Their acting was good to terrific!

5631828,1,B00BJ0RGCU,"This movie was both too cliche and too unbelievable, certainly never really good.

It was silly to think these kids would commit so completely to this stranger.  And the whole finale was bizarre.

5631842,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"By now, Matthew McConaughey's acting talents are widely acknowledged. He is excellent here. But so are the two boys, one of whom had never acted before. For that matter, the entire cast is great. But more than anything is the sense of place established by the writer-director Jeff Nichols. He grew up in Arkansas and it shows in the dialog.

If you haven't seen his two earlier features, check out ""Shotgun Stories"" and ""Take Shelter.""

After the first 10 minutes I didn't think I was going to like it but I ended up watching the whole thing and being quite pleased with it by the end.

The movie starts slow, stays slow and really just is very uninteresting the whole way through. Character development is non existent. The whole movie is just poorly put together and you probably won't establish a connection with any character in this film.

5631912,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Good movie...tho' Matthew must like to play roles where he is
borderline disgusting - I sometimes imagine that being in his presence; if I were to actually meet him in person, he would smell like he hadn't bathed for days.  More than one role, he just comes across as this might be his demeanor in real life.  (just saying)

The star of this movie, was the young boys - and it could have rated higher, had the profanity been kept at a minimum.
Leads one to believe that if you are low income, you are low minded and less intelligent.  Is this really how it is in real life?
Does morality have a dollar sign attached?  I would think not... since the mother seemed to display herself as having and
wanting a higher standard of life, she seemed to lack in teaching this to her son.  While honesty was important to the father, it didn't seem important to raise his son to be a better person in other aspects.",1399852800,,904,4.319526627218935

5631940,1,B00BJ0RGCU,Love Mathew but the movie was a bit boring.  The kids played a good roll.  They gave him the benefit of the doubt and in the Intrim they learned about love,1399593600,2,155,3.967741935483871
5631951,3,B00BJ0RGCU,To slow for me. I watched the movie to the end only because he is a hunk. It was very predictable.,1399593600,,98,3.7142857142857144
5631952,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"I absolutely loved this movie. I know it sounds clich to say that watching the boys tear around town and go on their adventures reminded me of my youth, but it did. I really related with Ellis and Neckbone and actually felt that I was watching myself.

For his age, Tye Sheridan is truly a remarkable actor and McConaughey was perfect for the roll of Mud. Without giving anything away, I will say that if you want to take a magic carpet ride back to your youth and be reminded of how the world looks through the eyes of adolescence, then you have found the vehicle to do so...Great movie!",1399593600,,588,4.345454545454546
5631953,5,B00BJ0RGCU,A mix of the often misunderstood 'deep south' with everyday gritty life anywhere. Understated performances with a - literally - blow up ending. I liked it.,1399593600,,155,5.0
5631954,2,B00BJ0RGCU,thought the movie was slow at times. Near the end  (Aprox. 20 minutes left) it stopped to recharge it self and and never did start up again,1399593600,,139,4.148148148148148
5631955,5,B00BJ0RGCU,In the genre of Stand By Me. Great coming if age movie. McConaughey gives one if his best performances. Young boys will love it!,1399593600,,128,4.375
5631956,4,B00BJ0RGCU,I liked the movie and the story but it was a little slow at times. The casting was terrific and McConaughey was great as Mud,1399593600,,124,4.0

5631958,5,B00BJ0RGCU,Thought the boys learned lessons for life from this.  What people will do to help others when they think it is for love and they are not a bad person.,1399593600,,150,4.0
5631959,4,B00BJ0RGCU,.i like to watch matthew mcConaughey in movies. He is a very good actor. The two young boys in this movie played very good parts.,1399507200,,129,4.2
5631960,4,B00BJ0RGCU,probably would have given it 5 stars but i am not a McConaughey fan  the two youngsters were awesome especially Ellis,1399507200,,117,4.571428571428571
5631980,2,B00BJ0RGCU,The movie was too drawn out and the plot was pointless for my taste.  The acting was good especially the Mom and Dad.  Matthew was good also,1399507200,,140,4.148148148148148
5631981,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"This movie reminded me a bit of Stand By Me.  Just a great movie, plenty of suspense, well developed characters, beautiful cinematography and the storyline is exceptional.  Enjoy!",1399507200,,179,5.357142857142857
5631982,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"Like I said, good but not great. I wouldn't recommend to others. Matthew and Reese only decent actors in movie.",1399507200,,111,4.6

5631985,5,B00BJ0RGCU,Great movie! Not your typical Hollywood story which makes the movie that much better. I would recommend this to my friends.,1399507200,,123,4.904761904761905
5631986,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"This movie was not what i was expecting out of Matthew McConaughey, in the beginning I felt like it was going to be bad but stuck with it a couple more minutes and it grew into a decent/good movie!",1399420800,,197,4.076923076923077
5631987,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"I didn't dislike this movie. Or even find it bad in any way.
The problem is, I started this movie thinking that it was a comedy. That I would be able to get a few good laughs out of watching it. The only thing I had to laugh about, was just how un-funny this movie really is. Its a serous drama with no humor in it. So, if you want to watch a decent drama, then you may enjoy it. It definitely should not be listed under comedy.",1399420800,,428,3.875
5631988,5,B00BJ0RGCU,Well produced and with interesting characters and scenes. Different than most movies shown recently. Would like to see more movies like this.,1399420800,,141,5.454545454545454
5631989,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"This movie was excellent - a must-see. McConaughey doesn't disappoint. Only thing that caught me off guard was the language. If you have children, you will want to watch this movie alone first before watching it with them.",1399420800,,222,4.868421052631579

5632011,3,B00BJ0RGCU,There must have been a hidden meaning that I did not catch.  It seem to amuse my wife and keep her occupied.,1399420800,,108,3.909090909090909
5632012,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"I loved the movie but it cut out close to the end  and I couldn't get it back although I tried over and over.  This has happened often lately.  I don't know why but it discourages me from trying  new ones.  Frustrating to spend up to 2 hours and never know the ending,.",1399420800,,269,4.0

5632014,3,B00BJ0RGCU,This movie was pretty entertaining. Shows the innocence of young boys and their willingness to help. Liked the area where this was filmed.,1399420800,,138,5.043478260869565
5632015,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"The movie was great it just took a while to get started. However, once it took off it managed to keep my interest.",1399420800,,114,4.0
5632016,3,B00BJ0RGCU,Very interesting story that unfolds slowly to crazy fast ending.  The main chacter turns out to be someone other then the lead actor in my opinion.  The sweet innocent that we all once held is shattered for a young boy way too early in his youth to learn life is way too harsh.,1399420800,,277,4.2075471698113205
5632017,4,B00BJ0RGCU,This was a good movie. Several twists and turns. Keeps you interested and wondering about the characters and the  outcome of the story. Even the young characters played their roles well.,1399420800,,186,5.0
5632018,3,B00BJ0RGCU,The trailers for this movie led me to believe that this would be an exciting suspense/thriller.  Not so much. The young boys performance saved it for me.  They were pretty good.  Mathew . . . ehh.,1399420800,,196,4.388888888888889
5632019,3,B00BJ0RGCU,Not bad but rather slow moving and not enough excitement or action for me. Mathew does do a good job.,1399420800,,101,4.1
5632020,2,B00BJ0RGCU,Very similar to Stand by Me.  Worth watching on-line or rental DVD... not worth full ticket price at theater.  done,1399420800,,115,4.7
5632021,5,B00BJ0RGCU,Great find on Amazon Prime. Both my husband and I loved it. It really held our attention and we found all the character believable and genuine in this offbeat suspenseful  coming of age story. I love Matthew McConaughey's latest movies quite a lot and feel that he has really shown us a much greater range lately - and Mud is no exception.,1399420800,,339,4.467741935483871
5632022,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"We missed this movie when it was in the theaters, and then noticed that it was free on Amazon Prime.  Both my wife and I thought it was a first rate movie.  I told one of my running buddies about it, and he and his wife also really like it.",1399420800,,240,3.78
5632023,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Interesting story line.  Kept me interested the whole time.  Had never heard of the movie previous to watching it, glad I found it on Amazon to watch.",1399334400,,150,4.518518518518518
5632024,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"As with many Hollywood creations,this drama required a bit of ""OK, I'll go with this"" ex: the mechanics of getting a boat out of a tree!! The teenagers were superbly authentic, McConaughey was intensely off-center, we were thoroughly entertained being drawn into the characters, their agendas, and the fickleness of life presented in this flick.",1399334400,,345,5.290909090909091
5632025,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Mud was somewhat slow, but with Matthew McConaughey in it I can forgive the slow paced storyline. This movies slowness has a lot to forgive, mainly the lessons to be learned in the storyline.",1399334400,,191,4.647058823529412
5632026,5,B00BJ0RGCU,Awesome movie!!!,1399334400,,16,7.5
5632027,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"This movie was a bit of a surprise as the clips and trailers I've seen didn't give much away.  If you've seen it, you know what I mean. It's a story of two boys who befriend a mysterious man with a dubious past and get entangled in his drama.  Life lessons and it's reality play a large part of the story and it's not always pretty. I won't spoil it for people who haven't seen it, but I was a little surprised at the ending though the clues were there. It kept me interested to the end.",1399334400,,487,4.010309278350515
5632028,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Entertaining movie.  A movie that is okay for older children, as there is quite a bit of stealing and negativity.  Entertaining noe the less.",1399334400,,141,4.833333333333333
5632029,4,B00BJ0RGCU,I liked it. Better than I expected. Matthew is on point in this film. Playing in what seems to become a typical role for him. The young actors are also good.,1399334400,,157,4.096774193548387
5632040,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"If you like McConaughey you will like this movie.  He is great. too many flash backs, the plot is so-so.",1399334400,,104,4.2
5632041,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"Mud was just that - Mud.  I don't think it was a coming of age movie as it is advertised.  It is a goofy avenue for Maconaghy to try to take the starring part, but in this movie there was no main star.  It was so washed into each character that I did not enjoy it.  It seems that Matthew is following DiCaprio's direction of doing roles that are so way out there that they are charactlures.",1399334400,,390,4.025974025974026
5632042,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Storyline  has holes. The Kids story  & performance is solid. The life's lesson intended gets lost. Good movie overall, with good actors.",1399334400,,137,5.181818181818182
5632043,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Not McConaughey's best, but a great movie. If a movie can keep me up past sleep time, its a good movie and this one did just that. While a little slow in the middle, it had an action packed ending. While I find it difficult to enjoy a movie about people who are struggling in life, the story and plot was well done and kept us engaged.",1399334400,,335,4.014925373134329
5632044,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Not great for the family, but my wife and I loved it. It was a very good movie I would recommend -- maybe not the best dare night movie either.",1399334400,,143,3.8
5632045,4,B00BJ0RGCU,love the streaming of movies and this was a good movie to watch on a rainy day.  hope you continue to get more titles,1399334400,,117,3.875

5632061,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Insightful portrayal of the transition between two ways of life.  Compassionate representation of relationships among generations with all the requisite excitement and adventure for the southern setting.  McConaughey is outstanding, as always, and the other characters belong with his performance.  I plan to see it again.",1399334400,,322,5.956521739130435
5632062,4,B00BJ0RGCU,Very entertaining. I would recommend that you watch this film. A little lesson learned. Easy to watch and focus on,1399334400,,114,4.75
5632063,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"I thought this did not appear to be a good movie but decided to give it a try after seeing Matthew McConaughey in ""Dallas Buyers Club"" I enjoyed the story more than expected. Not a real excitement but I enjoyed it.",1399334400,,214,4.2439024390243905

5632067,3,B00BJ0RGCU,Pretty predictable but liked most of the movie. I'm glad I watched it through Amazon versus in the movie theater.,1399248000,,113,4.7
5632068,3,B00BJ0RGCU,Matthew McConaughey is an actor I'll watch in almost any movie.  The plot was OK but the not worth 5 stars.,1399248000,,107,4.095238095238095

5632132,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"A better than average movie but not perfect, maybe a tad long in a couple of spots. It really does play as a modern Tom Sawyer/Huck Finn type of tale. The movie revolves around the two boys caught in the middle of the adult drama that is taking place in their little river town world. The boy who plays Ellis is particularly captivating to watch. McConaughey, the title character, is well cast but he is not the focus of the movie so much as one of the supporting characters in this exciting chapter of the boy's lives. Well worth watching.",1399161600,,540,4.41

5632160,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"I decided to watch this movie just because of Matthew.  But I ended up really getting into it.  I was surprised because he usually plays a good guy or the guy to fall for, and in this movie, for most of it you aren't even sure you like him.  The plot was a look into the souls of real people and what makes them who they are.  REALLY a good movie in my opinion.  Worth watching more than one.",1399075200,,392,3.911392405063291

It's about making decisions when you're growing up. I really didn't get McConaughey's  role; for me, it was hard to follow. Is he a good guy? Or a good bad guy? I really enjoyed some of the smart allecky remarks that Neckbone made in his character, and I enjoyed the brashness of Ellis, but also the straightforwardness in his relationship with McConaughey.

5632192,4,B00BJ0RGCU,Matthew McConaughey is outstanding no matter what character he plays. He turns a so-so dialog and tired story line into a must see performance. All of the actors help to shore up the script.,1398988800,,190,4.617647058823529

5632197,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"This movie made me think of  ""Stand By Me"".
They both involve young boys that are growing up in life.
Muc (McCounohy) is not the lead actor in this film.
Eliss, a young boy, is the lead in my opinion.
McCounohy is probably the big draw for the chicks because this is more of a guy flick.

The plot of the movie reminded me of Huckleberry Fin - both need to build a raft to get down river, both have adults being assisted by a young boy.

If you like drama and adventure, you will probably enjoy the movie.
My lone critique of the movie is that it is somewhat predictable in places.",1398902400,,581,4.123893805309734

The border with neighbouring states here follows old oxbow meanders some of which are completely dried up or infilled making a mess of the map. The island in question is variously described as being in the Mississippi and Arkansas Rivers not that it matters much. Either my hearing has gotten worse or the actors southern drawl is difficult to follow. The words are slurred and tossed off quickly. Whether its my present mood or the movie I do not like this flick. It drags on far too long and McConaughy playing Mud as usual is on the make and the boys at 14 motivated to help with the promise of a handgun. Muds former guardian describes him as a two-time loser. This does not appear to be headed for a happy ending for anyone involved. But of course this is a Hollywood flick, what can I say.",1398902400,,924,4.409356725146199

Growing up in the south this movie almost makes me homesick I some ways. If your looking for a movie outside the usual action/romance/drama, watch Mud. Its a story about discovering life isn't always what you believe it to be. Not as rosy. Not as simple. And certainly not as cut and dried as you want it to be, regardless of the tenacity and fierceness of your belief and willingness to fight for that belief.",1398729600,,571,4.447619047619048

As it turned out I did not feel as if it deserved that high of a rating.  It wasn't a terrible movie, but I just lost interest over halfway through the movie.  I felt that parts of the movie lagged, the movie could have been much shorter, and I really didn't feel a connection with any of the characters.  I would recommend checking it out for yourself to form your own opinion, but just don't expect too much from this particular film.

5632378,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"This coming of age movie had some high points and some lows. The most challenging thing for me was that I missed a lot of the dialogue due to the dialect! I understand the movie was set in the South, but I really struggled to catch everything. I thought the teenage actors were good; McConaughey's make-up (teeth, especially was great. The concept was decent, if a bit predictable. I did have trouble believing that the antagonist would bring quite so much ""heat"" to this small town and no one seemed to notice. It was a relaxing evening, but I probably wouldn't bother seeing it again.",1398643200,,586,4.59047619047619
5632399,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"I like McConaughey and Witherspoon, in general, so this rating is mostly about the story in the movie.  Ellis is played well and comes across as experiencing a lot of the typical early teen angst and issues of life including be snubbed by his first love.  His friend Neckbone is a great character, too, showing that he is loyal throughout and deeply loves those around him despite not having parents around to raise him.  The story about Ellis and Neckbone is better than the story of the character of Mud which is simply that Mud is in love with a woman who abuses his love by using him throughout their lives.

The movie falls short in that despite being trapped on an island, Mud still somehow has cigarettes that he is always smoking yet nobody supplies.  Also, he's starving at the beginning of the movie when he's first found yet somehow he's not so hungry as the movie moves on.  The need to constantly provide him with supplies is completely left out.  I think that requirement and Mud's continued dependence on the boys for supplies would make the movie story better because it would show that Mud continues to take and take more from the boys until they just can't give him any more whether it's food, love, or good advice.

I probably missed and overlooked a lot of the deeper story plots and components that real critics note, but I'm an average guy that likes to watch movies so I don't do this for anything other than fun.

Overall, I enjoyed the movie as I did not have any expectations going in.  Knowing I liked the actors helped me get started on the movie but the lack of story elements left it at 3 stasr for me (i.e., decent/pretty good) and made it fall short from 4 stars for (i.e., really movie) and not even close to 5 stars (i.e., excellent) for me.",1398643200,,1775,4.450617283950617

5632482,3,B00BJ0RGCU,The acting was good and I liked the characters but I just lost interest about half way through the movie.,1398470400,,105,4.3
5632483,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"""Mud"" is a movie about a good and decent man pursued by an angry family with law on their side. The movie takes place in the poor American South. The story is about young boys who try to help this man played by Mathew McConaughey. I think Mathew McConaughey is a new Humphrey Bogart. I doubt he can do anything poorly. The story is packed with moral choices that provide lessons of life. It reminds me a bit of Tennessee Williams. The main character is so strong that we suffer less anguish than Tennessee Williams would supply. The movie is full of the beauty of Swamp life. It made me think of another old favorite from the 1950s, ""Goodbye My Lady,"" about a boy and a dog and you get to spend a lot of time with Walter Brennen, Sydney Poitier, and Phil Harris at his best. That movie I can recommend highly for children. Mud has too much violence. It is an adult movie. Generally I avoid violence as much as possible. I can advise you that the violence is not run of the mill.",1398470400,,978,4.263440860215054
5632484,4,B00BJ0RGCU,Good coming of age story.  The boys are believable and Mathew is believable as an escaped convict. The pain of childhood dreams of a perfect family are dissolved but it's refreshing that the new life has perks also.,1398470400,,215,4.657894736842105

5632486,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Loved this movie. If you grew up in a small town in the South, near a big body of water, you will relate to this movie. The two 14 year old boys are great actors & talk just like the kids I grew up with. Many of the supporting actors did great jobs too. The movie had everything-action, plot, suspense & was perfectly executed & connected.",1398470400,,339,4.151515151515151
5632487,3,B00BJ0RGCU,The two young actors were excellent.  McConaughey's character was not quite believable.  A loaf of soft bread in the locker of a man standed on an island.  And how did he get there?  Forget all this and the movie is interesting enough,1398470400,,234,4.5
5632488,1,B00BJ0RGCU,A complete waste of any person's time. Very disappointing. A very very very very very bad waste of any person's time.,1398384000,,117,4.619047619047619

5632508,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"I enjoyed the two young boys Ellis (Tye Sheridon) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) who became friends with Mud. They are your typical boys getting in trouble, yet trying to do the right thing by helping others. Tom, played by Sam Shepard is an old friend of Mud's who doesn't want anything to do with Mud, but comes around at the end of the movie to help Mud out of some trouble he is in.  I don't care for the music, I keep expecting them to break out some good classic rock in the movie, but they never did. It just seemed like that kind of music. Typical ending, but that is what I was hoping for. It is a good family movie for all.",1398384000,,631,4.088709677419355

5632514,1,B00BJ0RGCU,"Like the actor, but if the story was any more boring we would have fallen asleep. Actually, we decided to shut it off just short of the last few minutes because we couldn't watch it any more since it was clearly going no where.",1398297600,,227,4.181818181818182
5632515,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"This movie is gritty and feels like a contemporary Tom and Huck style story, complete with a fickle young love interest and river adventures. Mr McC was fantastic in this non-type role as a nice guy with a shady past. This IS NOT Wedding Planner or some similar peppy romcom with cute, glossy characters. It IS an edgy and provoking drama with realistically grungy details. Really enjoyed it.",1398297600,,392,4.779411764705882

But after the movie ended, I felt it was not as great as I wanted it to be.  Maybe it was unfair to watch Dallas Buyers Club first.  That was a great movie.  This one is good but not great.",1398297600,,319,3.921875

5632524,4,B00BJ0RGCU,There is violence in this movie that is not appropriate for young children even though the story is about 2 young adolescents -14 year olds.  The boys do use some bad language but lol my husband assured me that he and his brothers spoke the same way when adults were not around.  Bad choices had consequences even though the motives were right.  Good food for discussion with your kids afterwards.,1398297600,,397,4.642857142857143

5632526,4,B00BJ0RGCU,The reaction of the young boys to the mystery and the seeming romance of the man on the lamb tugs at your heart and makes the unrealistic situation one in which you root for the underdog.,1398297600,,187,4.222222222222222

5632546,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"This movie really had promise.  The acting was good and the storyline started off good.  But I was completely confused at the ending.  The whole storyline was based on Mud's relationship with Juniper, and them being back together, but the ending didn't explain why they didn't end up together.  I was just lost at the end.  The two boys in the movie -- Neckbone and Ellis -- really did a superb job and were the best part of the movie for me.",1398211200,,442,4.341463414634147
5632547,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Good acting, directing and writing....a coming of age, love story, drama.  I agree with previous commenters, the female characters are not well developed and almost unlikeable and the gunfight scene seems like it is from another movie, edited into this one.

5632563,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"This movie was kind of a surprise. When I read the synopsis I thought I would give it a few minutes and then if it didn't pan out I would just turn it off. It had potential and I wanted to really like it but something was missing. The kids in the movie did a good job but the characters weren't completely developed. At the end, when you reflect on each character, there were so many unanswered questions. For instance they set up ""Neckbone"" as a kid who lived with his uncle...why? The tension between the main character's parents...explanation...not enough to satisfy your curiosity. What motivated the kids? And what about Mud and his unrequited love...just not compelling enough. Reese Witherspoon was just decoration but had nothing to do. The actors showed up. Good casting...just not enough to work with. The biggest waste was Elis's dad. Convincing acting...you just wanted to hear his story.",1398211200,,900,4.85064935064935

5632572,4,B00BJ0RGCU,Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland were truly amazing in this movie.  I think that was my biggest take-away from this film. A great lessons-learned story with a heart warming twist.,1398211200,,177,4.9
5632573,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Not knowing what to expect from this movie or ever seeing it advertised, I did enjoy.  If you are the type that likes a flick similar to some of Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer, Huck Finn or similar, this might be right up your alley.  Matthew McConaughey does a great job of acting.  The two young boys who discover him and become involved in the plot also do a great job.  Joe Don Baker, Sam Shephard, Reece Witherspoon are others in the film.  A change from the typical R rated films since there is no nudity or crude language.  Some may want more action, but I think it is a great change of pace.",1398211200,,592,4.1946902654867255

I am a huge Matthew McConaughey fan and I was drawn into watching this because of him and it sounded like an adventure/Huck Finn type movie.  I guess it was, just moved too slow.

5632606,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"It was a great ""coming of age"" story about a boy trying to understand about the nature of love - his own and that of others.",1398124800,,124,3.8076923076923075
5632607,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"This is one of those movies that really doesn't do that much but keeps you interested in what is going to happen next.  They slowly share the details of this hideaway who is staying on a small island and is discovered by two curious boys.  The story revolves around a boat that is stuck high in a tree on the island.  Past love lost, legal troubles and a strange neighbor add to the mystery of this movie.",1398124800,,405,4.233766233766234
5632608,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"A mix of a ""coming of age"" movie and an adventure/drama.  An interesting story of a fugitive (Mud) hiding from ""bad guys"" and the police, and being helped by two 14 year old boys.  The complicated story starts off very slow and then picks up the pace, leading to an interesting but not fully satisfying conclusion.  Still, if you're in the mood for an unusual storyline (and like McConaughey) then you'll probably enjoy this movie.",1398124800,,431,4.72
5632619,5,B00BJ0RGCU,I enjoyed the story and the characters. The boy playing Ellis did a great job. It is a very entertaining movie.,1398124800,,111,4.333333333333333
5632620,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Matt does that sort of blank, wheels turning but the mouth isn't moving quite as fast thing really well. I do love movies about the South and the boys that back him up do a great job of portraying what you might see down in Arkansas. The accents were dead on too.",1398124800,,263,4.076923076923077
5632621,4,B00BJ0RGCU,Great acting and good story line.  Perfect movie for just a relaxing afternoon -the story line may appeal to men more than women but very entertaining.  The 2 young men were a breath of fresh air too.,1398124800,,200,4.378378378378378
5632622,2,B00BJ0RGCU,The movie seemed pretty good until the end. The ending was nonsensical & I still didn't know very much about the main character & what made him tick really. Very sloppy.,1398124800,,169,4.483870967741935
5632623,5,B00BJ0RGCU,Mud was a really good movie.  I think it would be good for kids also.  There are messages in there to show kids what like is like when you are poor and what can really happen in real life. That is why I gave it a high rating.,1398124800,,225,3.6666666666666665
5632624,5,B00BJ0RGCU,Great modern day Tom Sawyeresque film. I have seen this movie twice and still fun to watch. I recommend it,1398124800,,106,4.35
5632625,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"The story line of this movie has some flaws and is not very believable.but it is sort of a modern day Huck Finn story about the river.  The two boys and Matt McConaughey work well together, and Reese Witherspoon is easy on the eyes.  All in all, an entertaining movie and worth watching.",1398124800,,287,4.39622641509434
5632626,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"Overall a sad tale, with a young boys search for romance in Mud's life, with his parents and in his own life.  Mud himself was about clear as mud.",1398124800,,146,4.0344827586206895
5632627,5,B00BJ0RGCU,An excellent portrayal of roles on the part of all actors.  Superb cast. Matthew McConaughey is at his best. Film explores various facets of family relationships and friendships.  As good a coming-of-age film as I've seen in quite some time.  Bare bones budget producing unexpected results. Serious stuff--don't expect comic relief.,1398124800,,332,5.470588235294118
5632628,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Excellent acting and directing. Original story. Gritty and real feeling, without being too heart-wrenching to watch. In my opinion, one of the most underrated films of the year.",1398124800,,177,5.357142857142857
5632639,4,B00BJ0RGCU,A different type of movie for McConaughey from our perspective. But he did good. Took a while to understand the plot but it was a good story. Some aspects not very believeable.,1398124800,,176,4.53125
5632640,5,B00BJ0RGCU,This storyline was refreshingly different and the acting was really good. Was a good choice for a Friday night movie.,1398038400,,117,4.9

Moves a little slow.
Not appropriate for children under fourteen years of age.

5632642,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"Overall this was an okay movie.  There was nothing in it that would make me have to watch it again soon much less ever again.

The storyline was fairly basic.  Take a bit of The Fugitive add a dash of Stand By Me, et voil, you have MUDdled.",1398038400,,240,3.9583333333333335

5632644,2,B00BJ0RGCU,"Slow to develop and not a very deep plot makes this one a dull movie to watch. I have not been able to finish it because I get disinterested and cut it off to watch some other programming.  It got good reviews, and McConaughey does a fairly good job with his role, but.............",1398038400,,281,4.30188679245283
5632645,1,B00BJ0RGCU,"After fighting staying conscious during this painfully slow moving, we came to the conclusion Mudd could have been a 45min short story/film and been more interesting than what was filmed.  Half the movie is completely irrelevant to the plot, and it moved so slow, you can literally take 6 walk away 5-10 min breaks and not miss anything.
Why it is, when ever I see ""Critically Acclaimed"" I skip it, as it's double speak for ""movies the elitists like"", not what the general public likes.

Example of Movie industries grasp of the actual movie 'watchers'...Boondock Saints.  1 week in only 5 theaters, and the stars are still doing appearances, almost 20yrs after.  Sequel came 10yrs after the first, and the third is rumored as of 04/2014.  I can't even remember a name of a Critically Acclaimed movie that wasn't released in the last year, besides Mudd.  Only remember it as it was so painfully slow.",1398038400,,900,4.774193548387097
5632646,5,B00BJ0RGCU,This is a great movie. Matthew M. is a sgood as always but the star of the show was the young boy. He and his pal were so good they were real.,1398038400,,142,3.46875
5632647,2,B00BJ0RGCU,I thought the movie was depressing.  Was not what I was looking for at the time. Disliked several of the characters.,1398038400,,116,4.523809523809524
5632648,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"My personal thing, I just didn't care for it. Why, I'm not sure. I really like both Matthew McConaughey and Reese Witherspoon.

Very strange, MM was filthy dirty throughout the movie, and RW just didn't look like herself.

MM's name was MUD, never really explained why, or I sure missed it. I can't think of anything to recommend this movie, and I sure wouldn't watch it again.",1398038400,,377,4.611940298507463

Went to see Dallas Buyers Club and decided to reassess my opinion of him.  When I saw Mud on my amazon site, we watched it.  He has really come into himself.  And Sam Shepard was outstanding as well.  Watch it!",1398038400,,335,4.253968253968254

5632665,5,B00BJ0RGCU,I think this is just another movie to chalk up for the director and Matthew McConaughey. Matthew put on a great performance that is part of an increasingly good number of acting choices by the man. I highly recommend this movie.,1398038400,,228,4.585365853658536

5632668,3,B00BJ0RGCU,Kind of disappointed in the movie.  It's on the slow side and you really don't get the jist of it until close to the end.,1398038400,,121,3.84
5632679,4,B00BJ0RGCU,Enjoyed this soundtrack by Lucero as well. Good flick! I would reccomend and I liked the Mississippi landscapes and portrayal of Ellis growing up in a small town.,1398038400,,162,4.821428571428571
5632680,2,B00BJ0RGCU,I did not care for the movie at all. It was not what I had expected from Mathew . He has had better work.,1398038400,,105,3.4166666666666665
5632681,2,B00BJ0RGCU,"We were turned off by the language, especially coming from the mouths of kids. It may be an accurate depiction of what typical southern boys say, and even more so of the adults, but the story could be well told without all the @#$%!!&^$$.",1398038400,,238,4.431818181818182
5632682,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"First of all, I thought the movie was predictable. I told my husband what was going to trigger the black moment/final turning point in the movie about 15-30 minutes. I was right.
Secondly, I really disliked the underlying message that women are liars when it comes to love. Nearly everything that went wrong in the movie was because a woman lied about loving the man.
Minor point: where was Mud getting all those cigarettes when he had to have the kids scrounge food for him?",1398038400,,475,4.6
5632683,4,B00BJ0RGCU,It kind of reminded me of a Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn type movie. Some pretty good action all in all,1398038400,,99,3.761904761904762
5632684,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Loved it!  Great dialogue great acting great story, great characters ...surprisingly rich in emotions.  Stories from the south of our country always pull me in because of the contrast in way of life, way of speaking and living is so different from my northern sensibilities yet the depth of emotion teetering on violence draws me in like the exotic scent of a magnolia flower.",1398038400,,376,4.859375

5632686,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"The last thirty minutes were the best. The beginning is slow; I considered vacuuming while it was playing. The dynamic little boy is the best character. We watch him struggle with the dynamic of love between adults. When he applies it to his own desires, it's a different outcome (sorry, don't want to spoil anything).",1398038400,,318,4.8
5632687,4,B00BJ0RGCU,I enjoyed the movie.  It was entertaining and had a good story line.  The adventures of the two boys reminded me of when I was a kid.,1398038400,,133,3.888888888888889

5632700,3,B00BJ0RGCU,I thought the acting of the two young boys was better than the headliners.  They were natural in their roles and gave some credibility to the adults.,1398038400,,149,4.518518518518518
5632701,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"The story was good, the acting and cinematography well done.

5632705,5,B00BJ0RGCU,Drama and mystery in a good old southern setting. A very good cast. Filmed in the south! A good movie.,1398038400,,102,4.15
5632706,3,B00BJ0RGCU,This movie starts out slow and never really picks up the pace. Good story lines but a little difficult to follow at times,1398038400,,121,4.304347826086956
5632707,4,B00BJ0RGCU,It was an ok movie. Kind of like a B movie use to be .I thought it was a little long. I wouldn't pay a movie theater price to see it. The acting was good. Looked like real life in places.,1398038400,,187,3.5853658536585367
5632708,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Well made, sweet story. Engaging characters. A nice balance of action and friendship. A good coming boys of age story.",1398038400,,118,4.95
5632709,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Had seen promos for this movie but never viewed till now.
It has a great story and excellently acted.
Matthew McConaughey gives an Oscar caliber performance.",1398038400,,157,5.076923076923077
5632710,5,B00BJ0RGCU,Great movie.  Loved the concept of the movie.  It has so many things that are real about life. Would definitely watch it again.,1398038400,,127,4.478260869565218
5632711,2,B00BJ0RGCU,"I'm not sure why this move was so well received by critics. The acting was generally well done, but the movie was dull and drawn out with a silly Hollywood ending. I watched it all the way through, but I had a hard time caring about any of the characters. The breathless reviews by reviews proclaiming this as ""The best movie of the year"" are simply high on pretentiousness.",1397952000,2,374,4.434782608695652

5632713,4,B00BJ0RGCU,Interaction between main characters were reminiscient of Mark Twain adventures.  It was a great adventure worth watching.  Loved the horizonal ending with dad and son.,1397952000,,167,5.64

5632717,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"I watched this movie on a recommendation from my brother and was not dissappointed. This was not your ""typical"" McConaughey role which was a good thing. I liked that the movie wasn't moving rapidly from one scene to the next. If your looking for something to zone out to, go watch Transformers or G.I. Joe. This film expects the audience to actually have an attention span. The story is told through the eyes of 14-year-old Ellis as he learns lessons about life, love, trust, and friendship. A great movie that would highly recommend!",1397952000,,534,4.752688172043011

The story and characters developed into a very interesting story. Not quite edge of your seat, but kept me entertained and wanting to see how this story played out. I would recommend the movie for the adventure.",1397952000,,388,4.402777777777778

5632730,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"I was a bit shocked at how much I liked this movie.  In the beginning the southern accents seemed a bit campy, but honestly as the movie progressed I forgot about them and the whole thing was like a present you didn't expect to enjoy.  The kids kind of make the movie, in particular the one that plays Ellis.  Good overall.",1397952000,,323,4.262295081967213
5632731,4,B00BJ0RGCU,This was one of McConaughey's best movies in my opinion. It was very thought provoking. I would recommend it to anyone.,1397952000,,119,4.714285714285714
5632732,2,B00BJ0RGCU,The movie had a very weak story line and the only real essence in it was the innocence of the boy cherishing the purity of love and to experience the tainting of it by those who violated it due to selfish motives.,1397952000,,213,4.095238095238095

5632750,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"The show is a darn good action drama and buddy film.  The acting is above and beyond the usual acting and I didn't see one bit of CGI.

The big river is one of the stars here.  I would give this a HUGE thumbs up.

Almost all American action dramas today are short on logic.  The endings almost always ignore obvious things which are natural occurrences of violence and law breaking.  In fact most shows ignore or violate the laws of physics.

In this instance, there might be some of that but the way this film was done pretty well gets over those objections at the end.

Great show sad but fulfilling.",1397865600,,602,4.3125

5632756,5,B00BJ0RGCU,I was pleasantly surprised by this movie although I shouldn't have been since it has Matthew McConaughey in it and he always has stellar performances! It has a sad touch of romance rolled into a very dramatic story that will capture your attention through the whole movie. Not to give any spoilers all I can say is to pick out a couple of hours of free time and sit down and watch it for yourself and you will find in the end that you enjoyed it!,1397865600,,446,4.1976744186046515
5632757,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"This is not really the type of movie I watch but, I took a chance. I was surprised by how much I liked the movie. First, you should know, it was really well acted. You won't be disappointed by any of the acting. Anyway, it hits the ground running with 2 pre-teen boys doing the typical pre-teen thing by sneaking out of the house and piloting down a river to an abandoned island. At least it was supposed to be abandoned. Which is where they meet Mud....a shady character to be sure but, definitely somebody a boy would find interesting. He's got good stories, a gun and a boat in a tree. The story really gets going as the boys get dragged into Mud's life and problems and comes to an action packed climax.

It was worth the watching. I recommend you give it a shot.",1397865600,,767,4.2534246575342465
5632758,5,B00BJ0RGCU,The young boy that plays Elis in this movie is absolutely amazing.  It is a fantastic movie defiantly worth a watch.,1397865600,,116,4.523809523809524
5632769,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"What was the people/person or whoever decided to name this movie MUD???  I'm sure it didn't help it at the box office
As movies go these days, this movie is outstanding.  I agree with another critic about the name it should have been named ELLIS, anything but MUD.  Mathew gets to take his shirt off after previously telling the boys the only thing left to his name is the shirt on his back and his gun.  Matt Damon does a hilarious take off on McConaughey when he's working,  he keeps asking the director when can I take my shirt off?  Now, is it time... my fans want to see me without my shirt... I see why the MF is built to be sure.  The story goes he was discovered in a bar by a very famous Gay director whose name eludes me right now and I can sure see why",1397865600,,763,4.046666666666667
5632770,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"good production, good acting. McConaughey showing his continued progress in acting and the young actors in the film will certainly be seen again in the future.  Good supporting actor, too.  Story line may throw you at first, seeing McConaughey portrayed as run-a-way felon living up to the title, ""Mud"".  But, the story also shows a way of life many are not familiar with--not just life on the river, but the difficulty and hard-scabble existence many endure. The writers have to be commended, and can see why McCoaughey wanted to be in this one. Don't miss this one.  (The only reason for 4 stars, not 5--seldom give 5 stars, but certainly leaned toward the 5)",1397865600,,661,4.771929824561403

5632778,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"I found Mud entertaining because the performances were pretty well done by all the main characters, especially the two boys. But the premise was pretty thin and too many obvious liberties had to be taken to hold it together; Tom Blankenship's character comes to mind for example. He had to be s retired sniper, living directly across the river from Ellis's house to make the shoot up scene even remotely plausible. Still, Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon and Tye Sheridan made it worth watching.",1397865600,,501,5.048192771084337

It got a bit slow at times, but the story was interesting.",1397779200,,265,4.28
5632797,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"This movie was a total surprise hit for me.  I am a big Matthew McConaughey fan, but the plot, young teen boys, subject matter were all winners in my opinion.  Take time to view this one.",1397779200,,187,4.166666666666667

5632804,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"This drama takes some time to develop and for the most part is more about the characters and dialogue than the plot. It is an interesting glimpse into river life in the Arkansas region. While I'd bet aspects of how river life is portrayed are pure ""Hollywood"" there is still a distinct culture that is very different than city dwellers or suburbanites. I found this to be an intriguing dimension to the movie that kept my interest.

Overall I wouldn't say it was great (in terms of acting or plot), but the film is unique and worth a watch if you're just browsing for an evening movie.",1397779200,,585,4.4672897196261685

5632821,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Excellent story of love, trust and what happens when things go wrong. McConaughey is excellent, worth the price of admission on his own.

Whats forever for?

Thats a song from Billy Gilmans debut album that kept coming to my mind after watching Mud. Im coming to the conclusion that some of my favorite films to watch are dramas with complex character relationships. Something about the quest to understand the characters, as well as identifying with all the little emotions, make a well-done drama something I can watch over and over. Mud is among the best as far as an exploration of character relationships. The depth of Mud (McConaughey) and Ellis (Sheridan), the two leads, is incredibly written and superbly acted. Several of the themes among the other characters are relevant and pointed as well. Going back to that song, Mud is largely an exploration of people who fail in their relationships with one another. Looking at the story in the end, I suppose its not the happiest tale, but one of the most powerful ways to communicate a message, the same as the song, is negatively.

Now, it can also be a challenging and dangerous way to tell a story. Theres a difficult line to walk when the viewers instinct is to justify the protagonists actions. And Mud has some difficult actions. Let me begin by saying I loved the character of Ellis. There are very few films that showcase the complexity of a kid like this, and I don't know if Ive ever seen one do better. The film connects us to him very quickly, and despite his faults, I was instantly sold on his story. Hes also the most solid guy in the film. Yes, he tells some lies and makes mistakes, but the film always gives us something to think about and in the end hes the one I respect the most. The character of Mud is a little shadier, but again, were given so much to think about that the films emphasis is on trying to understand him rather than justify him, and eventually he makes the statement that no, Im not a good guy.

Though Mud may seem to be filled with cheap emotions and temporary relationships, I found it crying out so loudly that this isn't the way its supposed to be. For me, it perfectly hit the narrow goal between connecting us to the characters and telling us, don't do this.

Matthew McConaughey is an amazing actor. He flawlessly performs the role of Mud, and few actors can pull off the trick of opening a characters depth without much direct talk about their issues. Tye Sheridan is, after watching this, in my opinion, one of the very finest actors of his age in the industry. As flawlessly as McConaughey, he pulls off the complex role and his climactic low-point scene is so real that Ill admit I had tears in my eyes. Though some of his upcoming films look to be pretty dark, Ill certainly be keeping an eye out for his performance.

However, very few films are perfect, and Mud has a few glitches along the way. There are a few rough spots in the script, mostly structural rather than the action. I just felt that a few things were out of place and/or happened too quickly. I also should mention the language. Its frustrating when I like so much about a film, but its loaded with bad and crude language, especially when, in this case, a lot of it comes from kids (usually Elliss friend, Neckbone). Most of the time its lazy writing, and always it keeps me back from being able to recommend a film to a friend without reservations.

For a thoughtful exploration of relationships and absolutely phenomenal performances from McConaughey and Sheridan, Mud is very close to perfect. Holding me back from a full five stars however, is the fact that the script could be paced a little better, and also cause Im tired of sloppy language where it isn't needed.",1397520000,,3715,4.54559043348281

much from young kids. I finally started getting the story line toward the very end. You can almost guess what is

5632973,4,B00BJ0RGCU,Coming of age stories are one of my favorite genres. This is a story of young fourteen year old boy's life lesson on what love is and is not. His idyllic romantic notions of love are adjusted by a destructive relationship between a stranger he befriends and the stranger's girlfriend. His parents prove to him that true love perseveres through commitment. This could have been a five star rating except for the violence.,1397433600,,420,4.767123287671233

The values of truth, love, loyalty drive the story--including what kind of sacrifices one should be willing to make to 'do the right thing'.

I gained respect for him in this movie, but it was the kids who made it a 4-star movie for me.  The characters were industrious, compassionate and vulnerable.

Taking place in South Arkansas, it opens with typical small town life.  It then developes characters you want to know more about and, in the end, find yourself cheering for.  The kid actors are great and the directors sneek in a few life-lessons we all face someday - someway.",1397088000,,398,4.642857142857143

5633112,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"I don't generally care for movies where the good guy is really a bad guy - you know, he HAD to be bad because he was more right than law enforcement, etc., as in, take retaliation into his own hands and now evade retribution from society.  But I liked this story . . .  maybe because every other good guy was likeable and even the really bad guys were just trying to avenge a family member.

Man on the run meets and befriends two boys. Even though he is in trouble with the law, he really isn't a bad guy, is he??  I liked the fact that we can see positive male influences without kids getting beat up by older males/role models.  All the male relationships were  supportive and more realistic than those usually portrayed in films.

Some bleh language, but it actually fit the character.

Female roles - there were no admirable females in this movie.

Acting was very well done, and I liked the ending, sad but believable.

Many characters actually mature throughout the course of the film.

Scenery good, too.

For both of them it's a story of growing up and acceptance. It's not an action flick, as most of the action takes place in the mind--your mind and the minds of the characters--but for the viewer it's an engaging journey as one follows the characters on their journey of awareness.",1397088000,,466,4.367816091954023

5633130,2,B00BJ0RGCU,Story was unbelievable from the start.  The guy is on this island with no provisions and yet he always has a cigarette in his mouth and is pretty clean.  Where does he keep getting the smokes?  Probably could have been much better but once again the movie is poorly edited.  The kids do a good job of acting.,1397088000,,308,4.258620689655173

Cinematography takes you truly inside the Arkansas culture explored and depicted. Movingly relevant story. Honest depiction of the situation and plight of the men and the women in that particular culture, especially that of the women. One caveat: the ending was justified but a bit conventionally soft, Hollywoodish, thereby failing to reach the archetypal depth that was available.",1397001600,,537,5.6419753086419755

The writers did a wonderful job telling the characters stories.  The director blended it all together flawlessly.  It is not overly dramatic.

5633173,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"This movie was better than okay.  I would take it to dinner, but I wouldn't marry it.

The acting was very good.  The directing was excellent.  The writing left much to be desired.

The movie runs a slow pace, but it needs to.  The generic plot line I do love, and there is a deeper meaning all around.  If one desired, they may watch this movie a number of times to get a deeper and more meaningful story for themselves.  The problem is, I was left not wanting to.  I watched this once.  I'm glad I did, but that's it!  I'm not going to own it,  I'm not going to buy it.

The character dynamics were well written, but the unfolding of the plot line is true to life in the sense that it lacks direction.  Once the storyline really unfolds, it is still uneventful.  There is a little action and a lesson to learn or discard, but even the surface of the deeper meanings isn't enough to make a person say, ""I really want to explore this more.""

If you are an art film student and need to do a report, this may be the movie for you.  If you have a job, you probably won't want to purchase this film because once is enough.  The more you like art films the more likely you will want to see this.  I enjoyed watching it.  I enjoyed the characters.  I enjoyed the basic plot and the idea that was conveyed, but it seems like a warn out idea in a movie where everything in it is warn out, and I feel warn out after watching it.  I would not watch it again for some time.

If you've watched ""The Yearling"" ever, you know what I mean.",1396915200,,1524,4.074324324324325

5633176,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Matthew McConaughey does his usual great job acting in this movie.  I hesitated to give it a five star rating for two reasons:  first, I felt the focus on the two juvenile characters was not the most interesting point of view for the film; second, the ending seemed both confusing and hard to believe.

The movie had good suspense and reasonable character depth for the two main characters.  The other characters seemed somewhat cardboard, especially the females.  Overall, the film kept my interest and I would recommend it as good evening entertainment.",1396915200,,555,4.989130434782608

5633181,1,B00BJ0RGCU,This was awful!  I heard a friend didn't like it and couldn't stick with it. I couldn't understand that from all the previews I had seen. I am a HUGE Matthew McConaughey fan and I turned it off after about 20 mins! Alas.,1396915200,,220,4.116279069767442

5633211,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"This was a really good movie. Surprising that it seemed to go relatively unnoticed in theaters. I'm a fan of MM, but the boys who played Ellis and Neckbone are also very talented. Again, good movie about so many facets of L O V E",1396915200,,229,4.111111111111111

5633213,1,B00BJ0RGCU,"so slow I could barely follow what was going on, not worth the time I wasted watching it. Waste of time",1396828800,,103,3.9523809523809526
5633214,5,B00BJ0RGCU,First of all I love Matthew McConaughey.  Wonderful acting by all in the movie. The movie is of the teen movie genre.,1396828800,,117,4.318181818181818

5633217,5,B00BJ0RGCU,Another fine character delivered by Mathew McConaughey....one of the most underrated actors alive today.  One of the few actors alive able to play a true southern soul....The two young men who starred alongside Mathew were the heart of the movie.  The setting was beautiful.....a typical red neck Riviera....which made the story believable.....the setting was in fact alive....as another character....perhaps a classic coming of age story.  This story could lend itself to a sequel...!!!  The kind of movie the viewer would watch again just on the chance of noticing the things missed the first time...!!!  Mark Twain would have been proud of the depiction of life on the river and the culture it inspired...!!!,1396828800,,711,5.256637168141593
5633218,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"I hadn't heard of Mud but when I found that McConaughey starred in it I gave it a try. He was terrific, movie was compelling, catching enough of our own weaknesses to pull you in. He made the movie.",1396828800,,198,4.102564102564102
5633219,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"I have relatives in Louisiana and some of the river life seems to ring true to visits I made to see them.  Characters are believable and sympathetic.  It should have gotten more notice for the portrayals but is a little slow and draggy, kindof like the life and river featured.",1396828800,,277,4.52
5633220,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Simple story, a somewhat typical good ""bad guy"" type of move, but interesting to watch, good acting by the actors. On the other hand, it is the type of movie that one will only watch one time, for the story is simple.",1396828800,,217,4.190476190476191
5633221,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Thoroughly satisfied with my movie experience....b/c it engaged me, created a sense of sympathy and was intriguing. I would recommend this movie for the previously stated reasons.",1396828800,,179,5.666666666666667

5633223,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"All in all, an interesting story. There are a few parts that I question. For instance, when the young lead sucker punches an older boy, why doesn't that boy or his friends start a fight? Why isn't the young boy interested in girls his own age? Does this kid go to school ever? If you can get past those issues, it is a compelling story of people who don't have much materially, but do have a lot of issues to deal with in their lives.",1396828800,,434,4.117647058823529

5633225,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Don't watch this if you're looking for an action packed film.
Some of the negative comments I've read are focused on the lack of action or the fact that it's long and drawn out, but that's the point.

It's not just a story about two boys helping a fugitive. The story puts focus on WHY one the boys is so ADAMANT on helping.

No spoilers in this review, but I will say that the focus on Ellis' story and what compels him to help Mud (Matthew M.'s character) is rather genuine.

A good Sunday afternoon film.",1396828800,2,507,4.260416666666667
5633226,4,B00BJ0RGCU,I've always loved Matthew in most of his films and this one is no exception.  He's so romantic in his love of Juniper that he became a role model for a young boy just coming of age who's just starting to feel the same way about a young lady his own self.  Both he and Matthew learn the same lessons.  Love can be great and it can turn fickle but life must go on and it's best not to look back on failure but look forward to future adventures.,1396828800,,442,3.943820224719101

The underlying tone of this movie movie is about the relationships between fathers and sons and about their relationships with the girls and women in their lives. It is similar to coming of age movies such as Stand By Me (River Phoenix, Kiefer Sutherland) and The War (Kevin Costner, Elijah Wood) and keeps your interest throughout the movie.",1396828800,,577,4.548076923076923

5633230,4,B00BJ0RGCU,Not great but very good. Worth the time and the rental. Mud is a movie about grown ups and yung ins growing up.,1396828800,,111,3.869565217391304

5633234,1,B00BJ0RGCU,"I usually love Matthew McConaughey, but this video left me hanging. I watched much more than I normally would trying to get into the storyline. I did not finish viewing the film...it may have gotten better, but I usually don't spend time watching something that doesn't catch my imagination within the first 30 minutes. The accent was difficult for me to follow as well which also led me to abandon the movie.",1396828800,,409,4.694444444444445

Watched with older gent who commented ""wasn't it wonderful when kids could go out like that and have adventures"".  Absolutely.  I was frequently amazed and reminded that they were acting....... seemed like watching a live action.
Some would find the pace too slow but I thought it depicted the languid qualities of life along a southern riverfront and community really well.  Subtle and nuanced places.  Really enjoyed.  good human character statement.",1396828800,,583,5.34065934065934

5633240,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"First, I love Matthew McConaughey as an actor and does he give a believable, great performance.  The two young men were as outstanding.  The supporting cast were excellent as well.  For me personally, this movie isn't a 'Sting', it was entertaining and kept my attention throughout.  I personally would give a 'worth seeing' on the 'don't bother' to 'must see' scale.",1396828800,,367,4.967213114754099

5633251,4,B00BJ0RGCU,I watched this with my 13 year old son. We both thought it was a good movie. The kids are like modern day Huck Finn.  They are resourceful and use a natural setting as a place for adventure.,1396828800,,190,4.0
5633252,4,B00BJ0RGCU,The movie showed a great deal of emotional aspects that take place in peoples lives.  How love and hate are very closely linked and can result in not so good things happening in a persons life.  It was very interesting.,1396828800,,219,4.45

This little gem was a real treat for me. The story line was believable, because who among us has not, at one time or another, had a love that we believed no matter what, and the main actors came across as if they were enjoying the work. The two unknown (to me anyway) child actors were absolutely wonderful. The casting director really earned his keep with those two selections.

They check out an island that is uninhabited to check out rumors that they have heard about a boat that got stuck in a tree. Your guess is as good as mine about how it got there. When they found it, it became obvious that someone was living in it. They soon came across a man in ragged clothing who told them his name was Mud. He told them that he was hiding out from a man and his son and other bounty hunters who worked for this man who wanted him dead for killing the man's son, who he claimed he murdered because he kept beating up the girl (Reese Witherspoon) that he loved and that she loved him. Mud decided that he needed to get the boat out of the tree and move it to the water so he could make his getaway. Of course he needed the boys to help him. The boys come across Mud's so called girlfriend and find out that she and Mud have a very unusual relationship. I am sure that I will watch it again.",1396742400,,1020,4.054455445544554

My parents had strongly encouraged me to read about and see this wonderful story as they prepared to catch it on the art house circuit . I read and was intrigued but elected to wait for a rental release .
I've been enjoying Matt's growing body of swell work , in my estimation , back to Tropic thunder . Through Lincoln Lawyer , Bernie and so on .
If you've really enjoyed Matt in pictures like Contact , Dazed And Confused , A Time To Kill among others , prepare to be knocked out and delighted . I'll take this jewel over any of the ""nominees"" of 2013 . A number of them were excellent also .",1396742400,,782,4.25503355704698

5633295,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Matthew McConaughey gives another great performance in this unusual film.  In the beginning we're wondering what is going on with him.  But, as the story develops, we begin to understand his character so much more.  ""Mud""s character ranges from quietly frightening to sad, even tragic.  We gradually realize what drives him, why he lives the way he does.  It's a very engrossing story, with wonderful performances all around, especially from the two young actors who portray the boys that befriend him.  I will watch it again.",1396742400,,526,5.058139534883721

5633304,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Came across this movie by browsing Prime.  Fascinating story. I was not aware that it had been made.  Really surprised by the number of veteran actors who were in Mud. Love the setting is in The South. The movie kept my interest because of the 5-6 sub-stories involved.  These revealed intriguing  information about the characters while leading me wanting to know more about each, but not wanting to bog down the story.  As the characters seemed to care or interact with each other, I wanted to become involved with each character's individual story.  There a lot mystery and unknowns in the story holding my interest and questioning where the story was going...then BAM!  The booming climax (no spoilers here) and a smooth ending.  Not everyone lives happily ever after and not everything is tied up neatly at the end.",1396742400,,819,4.841726618705036

The first few minutes of the movie made me think of Stand By Me, but it isn't the same at all.

It took me awhile to appreciate the story.  I didn't get it at first.  Why would a man living in a boat in a tree make a good story?

Because it isn't about that. It is about so much more, it is oozing with life lessons but not a single one is thrown in your face or blatantly obvious.

I found myself thinking about this movie repeatedly the next day.  I may watch it again to see if my original press ion sticks.",1396742400,,649,3.827067669172932

5633308,5,B00BJ0RGCU,This is by far the best movie I've seen this year. So many questions.

He befriends two local boys who end up helping him avoid arrest by the police and being shot on sight by some other red necks who took exception to Mud shooting and killing one of their kin.  Mud is in love with Juniper (Reese Witherspoon) who is supposed to meet him and go away with him.  One of the boys, Ellis (Tye Sheridan) also happens to be having a tough time because his parent's marriage is on the rocks.  They are no longer in love, while at the same time Mud is risking everything because he IS in love.  Ellis also believes that HE is in love with the older May Pearl.  So, the young Ellis (14 years old) is learning about love and loyalty while life and death circumstances play out around him.  Entertaining coming of age story.",1396656000,,860,4.298136645962733
5633327,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"There is a great deal to like about this film but the real stand out performances
come from the two little boys who discover Mud on a deserted island in the Mississippi.
They put me in mind of the boys in Stand By Me and never fell out of character throughout.
Matthew McConaughey didn't have to stretch too far to convincingly play this slow-talking
fast-thinking fugitive as he works out his obsession with his life long love wonderfully
realized by Reese Witherspoon. The rest of the supporting cast, including the ever and
always pitch perfect Sam Sheppard was terrific. The Director of Photography certainly
made the most of the natural landscape catching the somewhat sinister mood of the
whole place.",1396656000,,707,4.9

This movie is underrated now but thanks to new viewing vehicles which will allow more people to watch it, in time Mud will be recognized as the American Classic it is. Two early teen boys take a motored row boat out to a secluded river island, Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) wants to show his older and best friend, Ellis (Tye Sheridan) a twenty foot boat sitting up in a tree. The burning question to the boys is not ""How did it get here?"" But ""How do we make this boat our own?""  To their disappointment they discover Mud (Matthew McConaughey), a young muscled nearly wild trickster man, is already living in it. Mud offers Ellis and Neckbone a deal -- help me rescue and reunite with my girl Juniper (Reese Witherspoon) who is being stalked by her murdered lover's thug-business men father (Joe Don Baker) and brother (Paul Sparks) and the boat is yours.

5633375,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"I admit it, I love this guy but I felt the Mud movie was a bit boring and the best part was the very end.",1396569600,,105,3.24
5633376,3,B00BJ0RGCU,It was an okay love story but I wouldn't show it to children. It should be an adult movie only,1396569600,,94,3.75
5633377,4,B00BJ0RGCU,Mud was better than expected. Well acted coming of age story. Would recommend this movie without hesitation. Matthew McConaughey has really become a well rounded actor.,1396569600,,168,5.5
5633378,3,B00BJ0RGCU,The best part of the movie were the two boys.  I love their forthright personalities.  And their are lessons to be learned about love.,1396569600,,134,4.541666666666667

5633380,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"South east Texas and Louisiana is marking a period in this actors career that will some day be as important to film buffs as the music of Sinatra & The Dorseys are to serious Music fans. His current Trilogy ( Mud, True Detectives and Dallas Buyers Club ) are just about as deep into the ""Blues"" as films can go. None seem to be high budget works but they fit the mood of the stories they portray.",1396569600,,396,4.1558441558441555

5633384,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"It held my interest. Good story. Pretty good acting. I found it pretty unbelievable that someone could stowaway on an island that was so close to land and no cops ever searched for and alleged murderer there; but, it takes your imagination on somewhat of a ride.",1396569600,,262,4.595744680851064

5633387,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Matthew McConaughey has always been a favorite of mine.  This film is a complete departure from other films he has made and it works.  His relationship with the two boys, who are equally important to the story, works very well.  He is a very good looking man, but in this film he relies on his acting chops instead of just taking his shirt off.",1396569600,,344,4.34375

All the supporting actors (both boys parents and Reese Witherspoon, Sam Shepard, Michael Shannon, etc.) are a great addition to the cast.  You'll enjoy the movie.",1396569600,,325,5.113207547169812

It was a wonderful story about real characters, living real lives, directed and acted perfectly.  It seems some of the people who watched this were thinking it was going to be a bang bang shoot em up type film.  For them I say try ""Last man standing"".",1396483200,,341,4.121212121212121

Tension between several sets of characters, exploration of the male/female relationship in a meaningful way, adventure, a fine story with nice movement and rhythm""coming of age""  and endearing characters.  All this in a specialized, dreamy, dark setting, the perfect place for a nest of personalities, conflicts and resolutions.  In spite of what sounds like a dreary film, there is spirit and there is are  heart lifting moments galore.",1396483200,,497,5.32051282051282

5633419,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"Good rainy day film. Interesting story, but mostly from the two young actors' points of view. I like McConaughey and Witherspoon as actors, but I think they are too big for the roles they play in this film. Reese just doesn't pull off the deep south role. She is just too polished.",1396483200,,281,4.423076923076923
5633420,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"This is one of the best ""coming of age"" movies I have seen in many years.  This is a great movie for families with middle school or high school age children who are learning how complex love relationships can be.  Great to see a movie that is not sugar coated, but that is also not full of gratuitous sex or violence.  The characters are all multidimensional, not your black and white heroins or villains.  And, my favorite part, growing up in the South with parents who grew up truly poor, poor people are portrayed in this movie as they really live.  Can't say enough about this well-woven story or it's phenomenal cast!  Must see of the year.",1396483200,,645,4.47008547008547

5633424,4,B00BJ0RGCU,Caught me off guard how good it was. Didn't see that coming.  They really got the most out of the star actors but more so with the newbies. Slow go but worth the wait,1396483200,,166,3.8823529411764706
5633425,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"Not much of a story , and it was slow. But really enjoyed the 2 young men's mature outlook. It was okay, but I like a little more entertainment in a movie.",1396483200,,155,3.875
5633426,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Loved the movie!

The raft was updated to a boat with a motor, the white-washed fence was a boat in a tree, and there were villains aplenty.  Oh! And there was a love story and a ""mysterious"" person.  Not to mention the final scene on the river.

Mark Twain would be impressed.

5633430,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"The movie was kind of long, but entertaining.  Although some of the content may be questionable for young family members, was still an acceptable family movie with feel good plot and ending.  With a little work, it could have been a great family movie.  The movie would lend itself to goog family or youth group discussions.  The actors did a good job and it  didn't seem cheesey.",1396483200,,380,4.611940298507463

Unrealized love, won and lost, so pitiful, yet undying.  In this story I saw a man so beaten down, making all the wrong choices for all the right reasons...sacrificing himself...Will he ever wake up and see the truth?  About her?  About himself?  About the example he is setting for the boys who are trying to help him rescue ""true love""????

In fact every relationship between each pair of characters was left undeveloped and unfulfilled  The relationship between Juniper and Mud was twisted and never truly resolved.  The relationship between Ellis and Neckbone could have been a more fully expanded friendship and if it had been could have made the core of the film.  The relationship between Ellis and his mother and father was cold.  Their relationship eventually moved to a brief and unsatisfying conclusion as did the relationship between Mud and Tom.  Directors/writers attempted to create a surprise ending but it was far from unexpected.  I am a big McConaughey fan but in this case ""MUD WAS A DUD"".",1396396800,,785,5.133858267716535

5633468,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"McConaughey does a good job in an odd story about a man who loves a woman who causes him nothing but trouble, most of which is caused by his own refusal to face facts which leads to his being hunted by the family (and minions) of a man he killed in her defense. Oh, and there are a couple of boys involved in a generic ""coming of age"" tale that really seems to go nowhere IMHO. I have to admit that I'm not familiar with life on a river somewhere South-ish but this isn't Tom Sawyer or even close. There is an awful lot of foreshadowing throughout (one kid gets bitten by a cottonmouth just like McConaughey's character did when he was a kid). Basically the kid part of the story seemed to be that Mc wanted to believe in his love for his woman and the kid wanted to believe that love will conquer all. Both are predictably crushed. I'm glad I didn't pay $15 to see this one.",1396396800,,875,4.152941176470589

5633472,1,B00BJ0RGCU,"I really wanted this to be a good movie, but...

Terrible, unnecessary language from the first scene.
The base storyline is abruptly abandoned 3/4 of the way into the movie, in favor of the main character suddenly deciding to forget his life-long  love and ambitions, and just go off to Mexico,

Leaves the audience wondering why they wasted over 2 hours of their lives.",1396396800,,370,4.75

5633475,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"It does help a movie to have top actors and actresses.  This is a remake of Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer, but the tale translates well into modern times.  Times may have changed but human nature hasn't.  I think McConaughey played the part of Jim the run away slave and he did a good job.  It is always tricky for stars to be cast with children, because the children can steal the stars thunder.  The younger actors did a splendid job.  I enjoyed the character of Chicken Neck, which I beleive was a re-enactment of Huck Finn.  fI watched the first time for the storyline, and the second time to enjoy the interaction of the characters.  I highly recomend",1396396800,,650,4.4491525423728815

They come upon a drifter (Mud), played by (Matthew McConaughey) and embark on an adventure centered around helping this stranger get off the small river island he's hiding on. Along the way they learn some valuable life lessons. Mud tells to boys that he's followed a woman named Juniper (Reese Witherspoon) across the country every time she's needed help and in his last assist, he's said he killed a man and that the man's family is coming after him to even that score. In short order, the boys find the beautiful Juniper in their small town with a threatening group of men following her, in search of Mud.

5633555,4,B00BJ0RGCU,I enjoyed watching this with my 14yo boys. Coming of age movie. Some real gaps in the polt meant that I would have rated this movie less if I was watching on my own,1396396800,,164,3.8529411764705883

5633560,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"We thoroughly enjoyed this film.  Despite the top billing of Mathew McConaughey, he plays second fiddle to a pair of kids that do a great job!  The chemistry between them all worked very well.  This story is one that pulls you into growing up in a 'life on the river' and you feel like you are really experiencing the story rather than simply watching a fiction on the screen.  Excellent writing, directing and producing on this film.",1396396800,,434,4.597402597402597

5633564,5,B00BJ0RGCU,Typical Mathew McConaughey movie.  is usual good portrayal of a slightly off center character  Not too complicated a plot but with enough twists to be interesting.  Toss in some great island scenery and you have a thoroughly enjoyable movie..,1396396800,,242,5.153846153846154
5633565,4,B00BJ0RGCU,McConaughey gives an outstanding performance as usual.  This movie wouldn't have been as watchable without him.  Reece Witherspoon's performance is also adequate.,1396396800,,162,6.318181818181818

5633567,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Honestly it took me 3 separate viewings over 6 months to finish it, as I fell asleep early on the first two times. To be fair, I started watching in bed late at night both times and I've fallen asleep during many amazing movies, but it also was because this movie takes it's time and doesn't leap right out at you. This seems to be the reason most people gave for not liking it in the 1 and 2 star reviews. You got to put a little time in and watch it through, but in the end the reward is big because as a whole this movie is beautiful, touching, thought-provoking and expertly crafted. The shots on the river are gorgeously shot, the acting is impressive, the dialogue doesn't ever seem fake or melodramatic, the story is affecting and in the end exciting and rewarding and in the end it stays in your mind for a bit leaving some good questions/answers/observations on love, family, childhood, marriage, revenge...The actor who plays Ellis and Matthew McConaughey were so good in their roles, but I wouldn't say they stole the movie because all around the acting was good. I especially liked the actors who played Ellis' parents. In the end, this movie won me over and I would say it is in my top 5 for 2013.",1396310400,,1210,4.40625

5633574,4,B00BJ0RGCU,Good storyline. McConaughey proves he's one of the best actors in Hollywood again.  Never a dull moment. It keeps you glued to the screen the entire movie. Neckbone and Kelly are worthy of two good young actors themselves.,1396310400,,222,4.842105263157895
5633575,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Great , entertaining and well-acted movie.  Sort of something that Nick Nolte might have liked to play a few years ago.  Not that Nick is not still a great actor, but this called for a younger guy because of the age of Mud's father in the movie.  I think that this would appeal to all ages (except small children)",1396310400,,313,4.271186440677966
5633576,1,B00BJ0RGCU,I had seen the ratings and I was expecting a lot more from this movie.  The movie pace was too slow and the ending very disappointing.,1396310400,,134,4.153846153846154

5633584,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"The acting was okay, and maybe kind of tough to have great acting with kids as main characters. I like the general story but, as always with movies for me, there was too much focus on the ""being in love"" but I guess that's what gets people watching...
Good ending but I think there could have been at least a little more action like that leading up to the end. Good fun, overall. I give it 4 broken down boat motors.",1396310400,,416,4.148148148148148

5633591,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"This was a great story.  I was engaged right away and it was refreshing to watch a film that was not filled with vulgarity, violence (although there is some, it is tame by today's standards) or nudity (of which, there is absolutely none).  Matthew McConaughey is great as the character Mud, and the two young boys were excellent in their own right.  It somewhat reminded some of Stand By Me in a tale of young idealism and hope.",1396310400,,428,4.461538461538462

I do agree it was slow moving, but the intent of the story didn't really lend itself to a fast paced car chase either. MM is a great actor and this movie was a good choice for him to showcase his ability. I also agree the dialogue was at times difficult to hear or understand. Was definitely worth my time to watch it.",1396310400,,440,3.955056179775281

5633633,3,B00BJ0RGCU,kinda a long movie with some boring parts if it is a rainy day would watch i guess there are better movies out there in my opinion,1396224000,,130,3.8518518518518516
5633634,1,B00BJ0RGCU,Very slow moving movie. Did not even finish the video. Puts one to sleep. Not like any other McConaughey movies,1396224000,,111,4.6
5633635,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Entertaining, cheesy ending. Would recommend this movie for the characters and the story line just felt the ending was one of those recalls where the audience told Hollywood they wanted a happy ending. BFF",1396224000,,205,5.0588235294117645
5633636,2,B00BJ0RGCU,Not thrilled with this movie. Thought it was boring and the acting mediocre and I am a huge Matthew McConughey fan.,1396224000,,115,4.523809523809524
5633637,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"A great plot. Plenty of mystery and excitement, Keeps your interest. The truth is revealed piece by piece throughout the whole movie.",1396224000,,133,5.090909090909091

5633640,3,B00BJ0RGCU,It was hard to follow. It somewhat reminded me of Stand By Me. I saw nothing I'd write home about.,1396224000,,98,3.95
5633641,1,B00BJ0RGCU,"Not sure why Hollywood feels necessary to poison our children with filth, actually I do know why.  Had to turn this off before it was hardly into it because of the language.",1396224000,,173,4.40625
5633642,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Good story. Actors are great, boys in the movie were very genuine. And Matthew was great as always. Enjoy it.",1396224000,,109,4.5
5633643,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"Good story line, good acting, but somewhat predetermined plot.  Young actors were the focus of the plot, with Matthew making his presence felt.",1396224000,,143,5.217391304347826
5633644,2,B00BJ0RGCU,"What was this movie?  A couple of kids who swear a bunch, one of the two can act, except for parts.  Matthew McConaughey is on an island for how long? How did he get there?  Why doesn't he get off?  Why does he rely on these boys?  Why does Reese Witherspoon hang out in that hotel?  So many dumb questions and dumber answers in the movie.  This plot bumps around, moves around and doesn't have much reason to almost every shift.  The suspense was almost comical, but mostly not even that.  If it wasnt' for star power this would have gotten a 1 star.",1396224000,,551,4.221153846153846
5633645,4,B00BJ0RGCU,Good pace and suspense...you never know what's going to happen! The characters change their behaviors according to events and actions of others. Keeps it interesting.,1396224000,,166,5.68
5633646,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Matthew and Reese Witherspoon were awesome.  Actor Ray McKinnon was different from what I have seen, I mostly remember him from the Blind Side but this role was very respectful of a strong dad.  Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland are great in their role and will be well known if they plays their cards right.  Overall I think the movie was great.",1396224000,,343,4.5
5633647,4,B00BJ0RGCU,Very well done coming of age movie. Tye Kayle Sheridan is someone to watch for in the future. He has a very mature expressive acting style for someone so young.,1396224000,,160,4.366666666666666

realistic.",1396224000,,153,5.333333333333333
5633649,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Not the greatest movie I've ever seen, but definitely worth your while. Intriguing story. Strong characters. Very surprising scene at the end that had me on the edge of my seat. Solid movie, in my opinion.",1396224000,,205,4.722222222222222
5633650,5,B00BJ0RGCU,Excellent movie.  The acting across the board was wonderful and the story riveting.  Matthew McConaughey proves himself again to be a most excellent actor.,1396224000,,155,5.416666666666667
5633651,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"I'm not much of a fan of Matthew McConaughey however his performance in this film was outstanding. Despite the title, the film performed above expectations of what it would be like in a country hick town in Americas South.",1396224000,,222,4.717948717948718
5633652,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"Interesting story, kinda boring, but great character development and writing. Acting a bit off but that's due to cast compatibility issues. Felt a little Sling-Blade/Napoleon-Dynamitish at times, production-wise, but overall better than staring at a wall.

5633653,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"I liked the movie.  It held up my interest just to see the children survive the growing pains of dealing with adults, especially one that is a fugitive from the law.  Fortunately the outlaw was not a callous inconsiderate felon.  But I did admire the way of life on the river as depicted in the movie very well.",1396137600,,311,4.327586206896552
5633654,5,B00BJ0RGCU,A movie that a Family can watch. Been awhile since I saw it though. I always like movies with Mathew M. and also with Reese Witherspoon..,1396137600,,137,4.3076923076923075
5633655,4,B00BJ0RGCU,Pretty good pic. Plot was good and acting was real. kids did a great job of acting better than the adults.,1396137600,,106,4.095238095238095
5633656,3,B00BJ0RGCU,with Matthew McConaughey in the movie I expected more of a story line.  was disapointed.  silly story I was disapointed.,1396137600,,120,4.95
5633657,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Another great performance from Matthew McConaughey.  Everyone in this movie is great.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I tend to like lighter or adventure movies best.  This is a straight character driven drama with serious overtones.  Not usually my cup of tea.  But I had heard so may good things about the movie, I had to see it, and I'm glad I did.  Well worth the time!  Something I really appreciated -- I'm a native Texan and too often movie characters have some sort of generic southern accent and call it ""Texan"" (or the accents are just plain terrible!).  This time, the accents and little touches were perfect --- I guess it helps when most of the actors are actually Texans!  :)",1396137600,,710,4.484375
5633658,5,B00BJ0RGCU,Yet another substantial performance by actor Matthew McConaughey.  The young actors who befriended Matthew in the movie were also outstanding. Thoroughly enjoyable. A terrific cinematic treat for those who enjoy great acting and an excellent story line.,1396137600,,253,5.837837837837838
5633659,4,B00BJ0RGCU,I did not expect to like this movie. The title gave me low expectations. What a pleasant surprise. Well written. Great acting and great casting. It does move a little slow in the beginning thus I removed one star. I love when Matthew McConaughey is brave enough to do a character study instead of the typical leading man trip. The child actors were superb. I expect to see much more from them in the future.,1396137600,,407,4.44
5633660,5,B00BJ0RGCU,Very good movie!!  I woiuld definitely recommend this movie!!  It's intense and surprisingly well rounded.  I wonder if a Mud2 is in the making??,1396137600,,145,4.958333333333333
5633661,5,B00BJ0RGCU,Great movie !! never got boring and had did not have too much violence in it. Mathew McConaughey good as usual,1396137600,,110,4.285714285714286
5633662,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"This movie was very entertaining.  The boys portrayed the correct ages and traits.  Would recommend this movie as enjoyable.  In my opinion recently some of Matthew McConaughey's movies have been lacking, this one is very enjoyable.",1396137600,,232,5.388888888888889
5633663,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Matthew McConaughey shows his full potential in this part.  Pretty violent but shows a lot of human insight into how people get
into trouble in life trying to do the right thing at times. People becoming involved and trying to help someone, not fully
understanding the entire picture of what is going on with the person they are trying to help.  This is a fairly long movie.",1396137600,,374,4.567164179104478
5633664,4,B00BJ0RGCU,I thought the movie was excellent and it quite intense.  Very good movie I would recommend seeing it you won't be disappointed.,1396137600,,127,4.7727272727272725

5633666,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Video and Audio were just fine. This movie is better than most. For some reason it felt like it was not the Hollywood type baloney, but made by an independent film maker. Everyone in this movie do a great job, the kid and Matthew specially so. Movie with a heart, that renews the spirit of good film making. Saw it the first time at the marine base in Camp Pendletton, Ca, for an amazing $2 a ticket, and we all liked it very much. When I found it in Amazon Prime I had to see it once more. 4 Stars.",1396137600,,499,4.0

5633670,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"A great coming of age movie that touches on the intricacies of right and wrong and developing a value system.  A wonderful story with suspense, romance, and heart.  You really connect with these characters as they tackle life or get swept up by it.  The acting is superb by all the characters which lets you get immersed in the movie.  An entertaining movie that also gives food for thought.",1396137600,,391,4.6231884057971016

5633673,4,B00BJ0RGCU,The actors are uniformly terrific especially the young male lead - Huckleberry Finn Mississippi river movie mixed with a shoot-em-up.  Sam Shephard is a great surprise as the old codger and Matthew McConaughey is great.,1396137600,,219,5.257142857142857

5633677,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"My husband and I liked the movie.  We thought that the two boys were great and Matthew McConaughy was excellent, as he usually is.  It was sweet that the boys could see the good in the man when most of the adults were blind to it.  We especially enjoyed the shoot out scene.",1396137600,,274,4.132075471698113
5633678,4,B00BJ0RGCU,A pretty good flick. Was looking for a lazy Sunday afternoon movie. This kept my attention (which is a challenge). Would watch again.,1396137600,,133,4.826086956521739

5633681,4,B00BJ0RGCU,The young male leads were astonishingly good. McConaughey's performance was spot on. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a riveting story told well.,1396137600,,156,5.28
5633682,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"It has elements of Tom Sawyer as well as Shakespeare rolled up in a modern setting on the Mississippi River.

5633685,3,B00BJ0RGCU,This was an average movie. The premise and the writing were a bit of a stretch. The two boys in the movie good in their parts. This movie is just not that good.,1396137600,,160,3.878787878787879
5633686,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Yes, this is a different kind of movie... in that it tells several life stories at once and intertwines them at the end. A coming of age for both the boy, Ellis, and Mud. It's about love and love lost. The scenery is very nice along the Mississippi and the flow of the movie is perfect for a relaxing day on the couch.",1396137600,,318,4.063492063492063
5633687,2,B00BJ0RGCU,"The trailer looked good, but it was very misleading. The movie is extremely slow moving. The story is OK, but nothing groundbreaking. Would not recommend this to anyone.",1396137600,,169,5.071428571428571
5633688,5,B00BJ0RGCU,McConaughey was great and the supporting cast was perfect.  Thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Characters were flawed and real.  Good movie!,1396137600,,137,5.75

5633691,4,B00BJ0RGCU,Two boys help a fugitive get away and learn about love  and all the problems that come with it  the Mcconnahey is good and understated but the young boys steal the movie. Worth seeing for their performances,1396137600,,206,4.54054054054054

5633693,3,B00BJ0RGCU,Well I love Matthew so I had to watch it. Its a pretty good show. Just a drama. There's nothing to exciting in it.. But its still a good flick. Two teen boys growing up and  their view on girls. I think Ennis is like Mudd when he was young...so taken in with being in love.,1396137600,,273,3.875
5633694,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"Overall, Mud was a good movie. For the most part, the actors did a good job with their characters. The move fell short in trying to develop too many characters. This was more a story about Ellis--one of the boys helping Mud--than it was about Mud. A boy having to wrestle with growing up.",1396137600,,288,4.351851851851852

5633697,4,B00BJ0RGCU,Enjoyed the story line.  Matthew McCaughnehey's performance was well done. The two young boys did a terrific job in their roles. Pure enjoyment.,1396137600,,144,5.260869565217392
5633698,1,B00BJ0RGCU,"The slowest movie ever!

5633700,4,B00BJ0RGCU,Nice story.  Not complicated.  Mild enough for the grandkids (10 & 11).  It doesn't have to be a great movie; I just like to look and listen to Matthew McConaughey!,1396137600,,164,4.4
5633701,4,B00BJ0RGCU,it's a good movie Matthew McConaughey looks weird though. O.o  ...... but other than that it has a good story.,1396137600,,110,4.5
5633702,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Wasn't sure what I was getting into, when I first opened the movie - but it hooked me in, quickly.  The movie stars Matthew McConaughey as Mud, but the true star was Tye Sheridan in his role as Ellis.  McConaughey gave a stellar performance, revealing various aspects of his character in small bursts, while Sheridan gave us an emotional view of his coming of age as he experienced his first heart break, and more, in ever increasing intensity.  As one who enjoys the reality show, Swamp People, I found the characters in Mud to be as realistic as Troy Landry, Bruce, Jay Paul, et al.

Previews for this movie never quite grabbed my attention, so it was definitely under my radar.  I am so glad it popped up as a recommendation in my Amazon account, as it was not only entertaining, but very interesting, as well.  Some have commented the movie has a slow pace - welcome to the South!  The pace of the movie seemed to slowly flow, just as life in the South tends to; however, there was a lot packed into this movie.  If you want to see a nicely written, character-based movie, you would probably enjoy this one.  Glad I watched it!",1396051200,,1131,4.451456310679611

5633704,2,B00BJ0RGCU,This movie didn't hold my attention well.  I kept waiting for something exciting or funny or anything other than the monotony to happen but it didn't.  I can only give this two stars.  I only watched it to see Matthew who wasn't even very good in this role. Reese was even worse ...,1396051200,,282,4.283018867924528
5633705,1,B00BJ0RGCU,Terrible movie...so not worth your time ! I could not get past the first few minutes. So boring and not his best movie!,1396051200,,119,4.217391304347826

5633707,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Normally, I don't like love stories. Too girlie and silly.

But this film was about love and other things: doing the right thing, honesty, chivalry, and more.

It's great. I enjoyed it so much I had to leave a quick review.",1396051200,,223,4.414634146341464

5633714,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"As others have said, good casting and good actors. I especially liked that it was easy on the violence, moderate on the language, and stuck to the story well. The tone reminded me of ""Stand By Me"". I also appreciated the grain and texture of the film; it never wavered from the title.

5633719,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"While watching this film I kept wondering why McConaughey was in the film; expanding his repertoire?  The ways of a Mississippi river community were portrayed well.  The boys in the film were remarkably resourceful.

5633721,4,B00BJ0RGCU,It was a good movie. Kind of like a new Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn movie. It had more drama and more of an adult themed movie.,1396051200,,131,3.888888888888889
5633722,4,B00BJ0RGCU,I really enjoyed this movie! I watch a ton of movies and its gets to the point where you feel like you wrote it. You know every little twist. This was different!  It had a good plot and a great cast. A must see!,1396051200,,211,3.7954545454545454

5633727,3,B00BJ0RGCU,I found it a bit slow going. I enjoyed watching because of the setting in an area I knew little about. Don't think i would pay to go see it in the movies but for at home it was OK. I think it is worth watching.,1396051200,,210,3.5869565217391304
5633728,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"Entertaining enough to hold my interest, but the basis of the film is somewhat hokey and the twist I expected never came to fruition.  Mob guys weren't believable but child actors were pretty good.  MM turned in a typical decent performance but didn't seem to change his character approach much from other films.  Not worth the theater but good film for home rental.",1396051200,,366,4.777777777777778

5633733,5,B00BJ0RGCU,Great movie and Matthew's acting was at its best.  Surprised he wasn't nominated for this movie as well. I highly recommend it.,1395964800,,127,4.7727272727272725
5633734,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"I actually liked it, and also thought the acting and story was pretty good. I didn't much care for the ending to be honest. Killers should NOT get away with no punishment, but in this society they already do.
The average sentence served for murder is 7.7 years in this country where we actually worship violence and teach it to all our kids.
And that's part of the reason were always in wars killing foreigners someplace in the world as well,not to mention the 15,000 murders in this country last year alone.
Nice direction as well. Pretty entertaining film that is impossible to figure out the ending I thought.",1395964800,,612,4.623853211009174

Just wish movie makers would try to make something to inspire and lure us on to be better people and not continually debase our standards.

But when it came to the ending? I couldn't even believe it! I had to go back and ""rewind"" (for those of you older folks) to make sure I hadn't missed something. Did they just run out of time or what? I don't know how to rate this. It was good up until the last 30 minutes or so.

With a fresh take on a development and plot -- despite the rushed ending -- this movie is well worth the Amazon primer membership. I think had the ending been cleaner (less ""muddy,"" HA), this movie would be a potential 5-star on here.",1395878400,,476,4.734939759036145

5633790,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"This is a Hardy Boys mystery made by Hollywood. The two boys that star in it are terrific young actors. McConaughey does his usual good job of acting and keeping the movie going. The movie has some very obvious contrived parts that you see coming such as the climax of the film involving a shoot-out with Mud (McConaughey). There are some very obvious unexplained things too such as how did Mud get to the island in the river in the first place if he needs a boat to get off of it?? We know he didn't swim. And we find out he has some food stashed there too including a fresh loaf of bread. How did he shop for that?? There is no store there and the nearest one seems to be far away in town. Putting all of that aside, and there is a lot here you have to take with a grain of salt, I still liked the movie because of the actors and actresses involved.",1395878400,,851,4.071428571428571

Family movie maybe, if kids are older, up to you. Teenage boys do talk about girls' tiddies and cuss, some. I don't remember vulgarity, like the F-word. Not from the kids, anyway.
Great story that builds to a climax with a  surprise (won't say good or bad) ending. Wish there were more movies like this with a good story in them without gratuitous sex, vulgarity, violence. (anyone in Hollyweird reading this?)",1395878400,,680,4.762711864406779

5633810,4,B00BJ0RGCU,I live on the Mississippi and found this visually exact. Especially enjoyed the white pelicans in flight. Floods along here can definitely leave a boat in a tree like this. Enjoyed the movie but not everyone's cup of tea.,1395878400,,221,4.6923076923076925

5633812,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"I enjoyed this movie. Mr. McConaughey is a really good actor, very believable. Made me think about the characters and their mindsets and conditions. I don't like plots handed to me on a silver platter so to speak, I like to think about the plot and reasons behind actions and situations without being spoonfed.

5633814,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"McConaughey and the kids deliver. Joe Don Baker was a welcome surprise although the role didn't bring much to the story.
The locations and the feel of people living in the middle of the country but outside the middle class is delivered seamlessly, without need for explanation and the story is buoyed by it.
It's a fairy tale though. The premise doesn't require the story to unfold as it does and while being delivered in the framework of gritty, down to earth American life it expected a suspension of disbelief from me too often. Not in the portrayals, in the events.
Worth the time to watch if for nothing else than the slice of life component. The boys, Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland are well cast. Not a classic, but a keeper.",1395878400,,732,4.553030303030303

5633832,5,B00BJ0RGCU,this was a refreshingly good people story. I'm so tired of action movies and bad story lines. This had some good redemptive relationship elements.,1395792000,,146,5.125

5633836,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Slow moving story of love in its many forms: good, bad, unending, budding, hopeful, unrequited... everything but desperate. This movie may not make many top ten lists and, due to its lesser-known status, probably won't be earning any acting awards for the main stars, but it has some very powerful writing, cinematography and acting, especially by the two young teen boys who carry almost the entire movie themselves.

Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland are two names to keep an eye out for in the future. These two kids are old souls, as seen by their understanding of life as written in this movie. They are able to convey with the simplest movement, glance, or utterance of syllable an entire paragraph of dialog and thirty minutes of back story. Their acting is nothing short of oscar quality throughout.

The storyline stays on track, albeit slowly, but there is not one second of corny, gratuitous, wasteful or useless dialog in the movie. The message, from start to finish, though seemingly hopeless at times, is one of friendship, adventure, honesty and intrigue, but more than anything else, the making of a good man. The insight into the vastness, the wonder, the beauty, the hollowness and also the depth and greatness of love are all explored through the eyes of the talented Sheridan as we watch him gain another fifty years of understanding of the human condition in a few days.

No sugar coated, feel-good smarm in this tale, but exceptional acting by two fine young actors and a whole cast of well known Hollywood names that will keep those who appreciate the craft of storytelling and high quality acting interested from beginning to end.

If you're looking for a fast paced shoot'emup, look elsewhere. If you like great acting, watch this movie, if nothing else, for the incredible talents of Sheridan and Lofland! They will most likely be doing great works in the future!",1395792000,,1886,4.866043613707165
5633847,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Very engaging movie.  McConaughey and the two boys in the film were just about perfect in their roles. I think the violence near the end of the film was a little overdone, but other than that I thought it was a great picture.",1395792000,,225,4.232558139534884

5633855,3,B00BJ0RGCU,I've seen worse.  What made this movie worthwhile were the two young boys; what excellent actors!  Plot was okay with decent writing and overall acting.  Thought it was a bit too long.  It really has to have something special to be 2 hours long or more.,1395705600,,253,4.434782608695652
5633856,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"This movie showed so many aspects to real life emotions. McConaughey did an excellent job playing the bad ass know it all kind of guy, but also showed his true feelings of caring for others.  I enjoyed this movie.",1395705600,,213,4.461538461538462
5633857,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Personally I loved this movie. However whether you like this movie or not totally depends on your own mental make up and how you grew up and WHERE you grew up. Part of this is what would be called ""coming of age"" because of the prominent roles that the two young boys played. That part carried me back to my own childhood in several ways. The movie had adventure, drama, a bit of romance in a shallow sort of way, and the coming of age part. If you were reared in the city you probably wouldn't enjoy this movie. If you were reared in a small rural town or in the country you may well love it. McConaughey was really ""in character"" as I have never seem him before and IMHO did an outstanding job with his character. The two young boys, I forget their names, also did a great job of acting. The supporting roles were mostly done very well also. I am very glad I got to see it and will definately watch it again.",1395705600,,910,4.146892655367232

5633859,5,B00BJ0RGCU,Matthew McConauhey is a terrific actor.  He does a great job in this coming of age story.  The two young boys did a great in their roles as a modern day Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer.  The plot line is a bit unbelievable but I still enjoyed it.  I wish I'd caught this on the big screen.  The cinematography on the river is beautiful.,1395705600,,329,4.078125

Although the boys realize he's a wanted criminal for murder, they agree to help him escape with his girlfriend who's camping out in a nearby local hotel. The story reveals the boy's own families, one who is being raised by an uncle and the other who's parents are on the verge of divorce. The idea that they are helping McConaughey reunite with the one he loves is what drives the boys, even though they are told later McConaughey is always getting in trouble because of her. When hitmen come to town to track McConaughey down, the boys' families are put in the line of fire. The themes of love, dreams, and families is cleverly portrayed through the boys' eyes.",1395705600,,798,4.548611111111111
5633875,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"I loved this movie, not just because it has a happy ending, but because it completely immerses you in a way of life.  The backdrop of the Mississippi River is a world unto itself, the people who live on it and make a living by it are disappearing, and characters like Mud and his friends are few and far between these modern days.  Children are not as unsupervised as they used to be and ""Mud"" reminds us of the good things and the bad things that can lead to.

I have always thought that he was and underrated actor and had not had the right movies/scripts to really draw out his talents. No longer. This movie along with his recently winning an Academy Award for best actor in Dallas Buyers Club has elevated him to a place he deserves.

He is stumbled upon and ultimately aided by Ellis and Neckbone, each presenting a slightly different slant of that complex creature that is the early adolescent boy; at once tough, yet vulnerable, knowing, yet naive.  Sam Shepard's depiction of a wily, care worn, former Marine sharpshooter is a bonus, and Reese Witherspoon has all but disappeared into the role of Juniper, the fallen idol of Mud, his lifetime love, continually beset by bad choices and dangerous miscreants.

Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

Today, 'independent' fictional dramas are not much different from those released by the big Hollywood studios. They both have trouble being believable. That's the case with director Jeff Nichols' 'Mud', starring Matthew McConaughey, who seems to have a penchant for playing southerners of late.

It begins of course with the two De Witt, Arkansas boys, Ellis and his pal, Neckbone, discovering the boat up in the tree on an island in the middle of the Mississippi River. When they come upon McConaughey's character, 'Mud', a drifter (who we later find out is wanted for murder by State Troopers), it looks like this might be going in the direction of a tale about a serial killer who has a penchant for young boys (a la John Wayne Gacy). But soon, to our relief, we discover that Mud is much more benign.

Actually Mud has been pining away for years for his childhood love, Juniper (Reese Witherspoon), who just happens now to show up in De Witt. The man Mud killed was abusing Juniper and in one incident (according to Mud), threw her down the stairs, resulting in the loss of a baby she was expecting. While Mud decided to play vigilante and take the law into his own hands, somehow that's okay because not only was the act despicable (and worthy of execution in Mud's eyes) but the victim's family were also bad people (so bad that the family patriarch is referred to by Mud, as the devil himself!). Mud in effect really is not a bad guy at all, despite committing a murder. Actually he's just a bad boy with a heart of gold. When the family of the man he killed comes after him later on, he becomes a hero of sorts, blasting them all to smithereens with an aid of one particular ally.

That ally is Mud's former mentor (and father figure of sorts) Tom Blankenship (Sam Shepard), a former Marine sharpshooter, who happens to live right across from Ellis and his parents, on the river. Ellis believes Mud's crazy stories that Tom used to be a CIA agent but Tom debunks them. In fact, he correctly fills Ellis in on Mud's true history--that he's been obsessed with Juniper for years and refuses to accept the fact that she's no good and cheats on him whenever she gets the chance.

Bad boy Mud finally gets to prove that he's not so bad after all when, with the help of expert shot Tom (of course), mows down the brother of the guy who abused Juniper, along with a bunch of mean looking bounty hunters, who attempt to gun him down inside Ellis' home, after Mud comes to say goodbye to the kid. The 'heart of gold' machinations continue when Ellis lashes out at Mud on the island, after he's disillusioned by both Juniper and Mud's expected reconciliation falls apart, and he himself is rejected by a slightly older high school student he develops a crush on. Ellis falls into a snake pit and is bitten by a poisonous snake. Guess who rushes the stricken Ellis to the hospital on the mainland and saves his life?

There's also a sub-plot involving Ellis' parents who are divorcing, resulting in the appropriation by the State of the houseboat they're living in. At film's end, Ellis and his mother move into a regular apartment, in town. As for Mud, you guessed it. He survives bullets and near-miss snake bites and nursed back to health by kindly mentor Tom.

Despite solid performances by the two child actors, 'Mud' pretty much feels as phony as a three dollar bill. Here's a portrait of a killer whose main problem is that he's a love sick puppy dog. Even Tom, the man who really knows about all of Mud's shortcomings, gives him a free pass after Mud helps him to do away with a gaggle of cartoon bad guys and then saves the film's youthful protagonist from certain death, after the kid ever so conveniently falls into a pit of poisonous snakes.

Don't get me wrong. 'Mud' is thoroughly watchable but please don't believe that most of this could actually happen in real life. For those viewers who do believe in the verisimilitude of this type of narrative, I can only surmise that such aficionados, are also seriously addicted to contemporary Hollywood and Indie dramas, featuring antagonists with clear cut and ever-so unrealistic, 'hearts of gold'.",1392940800,,4221,4.609853528628495

5633966,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"Mud is a strange coming of age story, where one boy learns that love isn't forever and that friendship comes in many different forms. Critics and fans on the movie sites I go to have been raving about this film, so I had to check it out and chime in. I agree with those who say that newcomer, Tye Sheridan, gives an amazing performance, but as for the rest of the film, I think it leaves something to be desired. While out exploring, two boys meet a strange man named Mud, stranded on an island. This man is full of stories and needs the boys help to reconnect with his girlfriend and leave the island. For starters, the film is full of inconsistencies. Mud is starving and needs these boys to bring him food, but somehow, he always has a cigarette in his mouth. One or two things could be overlooked, but the inconsistencies fill up this film. While it's a good story, there isn't a lot of substance to it and the film moves at a snails pace, another thing that tends to turn viewers away. The best thing to do would have been to use flashbacks in Mud's stories to fill the time, instead there are a lot of symbolic scenes of people lost in thought, the business of the town, the kids hanging out, it was very methodical, but also very dull. Matthew McConaughey plays Mud and does a decent job, the problem doesn't lie with him. The film is based on this guy, and for a character with such an interesting past, he really is a sad, dull guy. The only real positive I took away from this film was Tye Sheridan, who plays one of the boys. He does a tremendous job as he starts to realize that love isn't everlasting. To see how this character matures from the beginning of the film to the end, is really remarkable, but it's not unique. Off the top of my head, I can think of a dozen similar stories, where the film is much more interesting and the same thing ends up happening.

5633975,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"There is no doubt that the movie is intentionally somewhat slow movie where it needs to be, with an intentional low budget, yet high quality to get the story line the way the director intended. The film doesn't give anything away, till it happens, or you are told about it, then it's up to you to decide who it telling the truth as the plot develops. It begins when a 14 year old boy takes his friend to an island on the river where there is a motor boat is stuck up in a tree from a past flood, which they want to make their hideout and play. Once they make their way into the boat, they find someone is living there. Ellis needs to leave to get back to his houseboat to help his dad collect the days fishing to take them to the markets for a paltry living. Just before they leave the island, one of the many they make to help Mud), they meet Mud (Matthew McConaughey, who shows his prowess of character role playing) which makes Ellis late getting back home. We find out that Mud is hiding for killing a man who has severely beat a young woman who he considers to be his lifelong girl (Reese Witherspoon), and she is there is this tiny town to meet up with him. It inspires Ellis to make a move on a pretty high school girl. At the same time the movie becomes somewhat of a thriller. Any further and I would be getting into the plot of the movie, so I'll leave it here.

5633982,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"Set in rural Arkansas, MUD is at heart a coming-of-age story in which fourteen-year-old Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and his friend Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) learn something about the realities of existence - that people's motives are not quite what they seem; that love involves complicated emotions; and one should not place one's trust too much in other human beings.  This gradual process of discovering self-awareness evolves through regular encounters with the eponymous hero Mud (Matthew McConaughey).  Mud himself experiences a similar process of self-discovery, even though his emotions are clouded by an enduring - and perhaps futile - attachment to childhood sweetheart Juniper (Reese Witherspoon).  Beautifully shot by director Jeff Nichols, the film sets this story against a backdrop of a vanishing way of life, as Ellis' family discover that life on a houseboat can no longer sustain them.  The film ends in elegaic mood: just as Ellis discovers something about himself, he is forced to leave the river and live with his mother in an anonymous condo.  What spoils MUD, however, is its sprawling structure; within its two-hour running-time it tries to cram in a revenge plot, a subplot involving Mud and his closest childhood friend Tom (Sam Shepard), and a gun-battle at the end that seems quite at odds with what has gone before.  Nonetheless MUD is worth looking at, especially for its photography (by Adam Stone).",1390435200,,1422,5.214912280701754

McConaughey once again proved to me that he is an outstanding actor, one of my favorites at this time.
He is really good at playing southern/dark character types (Bernie 2011) (Killer Joe 2012) (Dallas Buyers Club 2013).
Mud is a thriller-drama, with happy ending. This is not an action movie. The only action one gets to see is at the end of the film; very similar in retrospect to The American (2010) with George Clooney.  Also, Matthew's character in the story, I would say, is secondary to the two young male characters who take much of the screen-time.

The main protagonist of the story is Ellis played by Tye Sheridan, a 14 year old boy with a big heart and courage of a grown man.
To say more would only spoil the movie.  If you liked The American (2010) or No Country for Old Man (2007) then Mud is yours to watch.",1388102400,,896,4.484662576687117

Anyhow, I loved the acting in this movie and it alone almost elevated the rating to 4 stars. But the story couldn't make up it's mind as to what the focal point was going to be. A man and woman who were supposedly in love were going to meet up and run away together. Typical love story, hence, elope into the night with all odds against.

However, even though the love story seemed like the driving force for Mathew McConaughey aka ""MUD"" throughout the movie, in the end it became anti-climatic and left me wondering as to why it never matured after it's feeble attempt to ""hook"" me with it for nearly 2 hours.

Instead, the movie was about broken relationships between men and women, however in contrast to coming from a female perspective; this movie presented from a male view point.

Mud is very much a coming of age drama featuring several great performances. At the top of the list, though I've never much liked Matthew McConaughey as an actor, he's shockingly good here, as is the young Tye Sheridan, whose character is truly at the center of the story; and Sam Shepard  man, that dude just oozes gravitas!

But don't let the drama label lead you to believe that Mud is a dull or overly self-serious movie. I found it to be highly accessible and entertaining, though it may take a few minutes for your ears to get acclimated to the strong Southern accents.

The characters in the film are very compelling and they draw you into the story nicely. The action sequences are equally as exciting (though slightly predictable) and add a nice element to the film, but they are not the whole point.  It is battle or the conflict between seeing the world in ideals and being faced with the reality of life.  It is harsh and it is moving and it is the struggle of a young boy to do what he feels is right and stay true to his ideals in a world that is challenging and less than ideal.

The story is a painful delight with the ending one expects from a postmodern tale, but it's predictability is redeemed by how much the audience wishes for a Hollywood ending.
The characters are so engaging, one can't help but wish for that happy ending.  The boys' innocence, the father's cynicism, and Kidman's stubborn and self-destructive resignation to her fate as a sperm repository and punching bag in the face of a much more appealing and hopeful offer of rescue and love, illustrate  life's harsh, complicated realities and our timeless, ageless struggle to do what we can, and keep some faith in the face of so many who have none.

5634091,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Where writer and director Jeff Nichols set ""Take Shelter"" (2011) in the American Midwest, ""Mud"" takes place in rural Arkansas, on the Mississippi River. The milieu and young cast  conjure memories of Mark Twain's ""Huckleberry Finn"" and the 1986 film ""Stand By Me"". Fourteen-year-old friends Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) set out for a small island in the Mississippi with plans to claim a motorboat that was stuck in a tree on the island during a flood. But they find someone else has beaten them to it. A mysterious drifter calling himself ""Mud"" (Matthew McConaughey) is living on the island and asks the boys to bring him food. When they do, he has some more challenging requests and regales them with tales of a long-lost love named ""Juniper"" with whom he intends to reunite soon.

The strong sense of place in Jeff Nichols' films lends them a potency that the stories alone might not have. Nichols returns to his native Arkansas for ""Mud"". This is his strongest effort since ""Shotgun Stories"" (2007), and this one's a little more optimistic. ""Mud"" is part coming-of-age tale, part suspense. From the moment the boys meet Mud, it doesn't look like this character could come to a good end, but Nichols keeps us guessing. Ellis is quick to take the romantic view of Mud. Neckbone is more circumspect. The audience will tend to think that Mud could not be what he says, but it is difficult to know what to make of him. Ellis, meanwhile, is getting conflicting views of love, from Mud's stories, his parent's crumbling marriage, and his own painful experiences with a slightly older girl. ""Mud"" is slow to reveal its secrets.

5634101,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"WARNING: This is a critique of the movie and contains ""spoilers.""  The  movie is worth seeing, with much to enjoy.  But see first and read later (if you want to!).

There's a lot to like about ""Mud.""  It's well-cast and well acted, it touches on engaging (and oft-treated issues), and it gives us a glimpse of a way of life in Arkansas that has a distinctive texture for all its difficulties and economic limitations.  The problem is, for me, that the movie gets in its own way, so to speak.  A rather clear thematic structure is undermined by aspects of the plot that turn the movie into a kind of shoot-em-up revenge thriller, and that seems gratuitous and not particularly expressive of the dominating themes of the movie.  These dominating themes have to do with love and with the idea that love is unstable.  The idea that love can bring a kind of stability into ones life is one that is cherished by the protagonist, a 14-year-old called Ellis (Yes, that means that Matthew McConaughy isn't the protagonist, despite the film's being named for his character.)  Ellis is watching his parents' marriage fall apart for reasons that have to do with their disagreement about continuing to live in a houseboat on the river so that his father can continue to make a precarious living doing what he has always done.  His mother has come to a point where she can't stand the precariousness, and she's ready to move out.  Both insist that they ""love"" Ellis, and he loves them, and the inefficacy of his love for them and their once-secure love for each other to keep the family together is deeply troubling to Ellis ( touchingly played by Tye Sheridan).  He doesn't want to give up his vision of love as able to effect more than it can, so when he and his friend Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) find a man who calls himself Mud hiding out on an island in the Mississippi (where they had discovered a boat stuck in a tree following a hurricane) and when Mud tells them that he is planning to snatch his beloved Juniper (Reese Witherspoon) from under the noses of the family of a man who want to kill him (Mud) for killing a member of the family who had treated Juniper badly, the idealistic Ellis is gung-ho to help love find a way.  When Mud reveals that he has been in love with Juniper since he was Ellis's age, then he seems like the perfect example of the perfect lover.  So a plan is hatched to get the boat out of tree, have it reconditioned with whatever the boys can find or steal (including an engine!), and use it to have Mud and Juniper make their escape.  As the plans go forward, the patriarch of the family seeking revenge on Mud (Joe Don Baker, looking old) arrives in the town (called DeWitt in the movie) knowing that Juniper is there and figuring that Mud must be nearby.  Joe Don brings along a bunch of hired guns to make sure that Mud will not escape them.

Well, it all goes pear-shaped.  To Ellis's deep disappointment, Juniper (although she claims that she once loved Mud) isn't really all that keen to be rescued by him, and Ellis learns that her relationship with Mud has for years been marked by serial unfaithfulness on her part.  In her defense, she tells Ellis that Mud is unreliable and a liar.  Ellis is devastated -- this isn't the fairytale romance that he hoped to enable, and he is the more vulnerable because his first awkward attempts to get a girlfriend end in humiliation.  He goes back to the island, excoriates Mud, tells him what Juniper has been saying, and rushes off, wanting nothing more to do with him.

So how to wrap this all up? This is where another kind of plot (the thriller) takes over and blurs the thematic clarity.  Ellis, in running away from Mud, is bitten by a poisonous snake.  Mud, throwing caution to the winds, gets him off the island and to a hospital, but his coming into town in such a dramatic fashion tips off the family and killers who are hunting him.  He accepts that he and Juniper have no future and tries to make his escape, but first visits Ellis in his home to say goodbye and patch up their relationship -- he did save Ellis's life, after all.  He is followed to Ellis's house by his pursuers, heavily armed, and the scene is set for mayhem.  Enter the deus ex machina in the shape of Tom Blankenship (Sam Shepard), who has a house across the water from Ellis's family and who has known and looked out for Mud for years -- and who is . . . a sharpshooter with a high-powered rifle (apparently he was either in the Marines or the CIA, depending on whose story you believe).  It's all far too convenient; when the shooting starts, he sits on his porch and picks off the bad guys.  At the end, he and Mud are heading down the Mississippi on the refurbished boat, Juniper, as well as Mud's illusions, having been left behind.

This Hollywood-ish ending is unfortunate.  It distracts from our appreciation of subtler representations of trust and love (between the two boys, for example) or between the fatherless Neckbone and his uncle who looks after him, and even between Mud and Blankenship, perhaps.  Unfortunate too, I think, is that the movie isn't all that visually interesting.  It looks fine, but there's no visual rhythm to it.  But see it for the ambiance and the acting.  The boys are very good, and Reese Witherspoon does a fine job in what is really a very small part, as the fadedly pretty, rather slutty and shallow Juniper.  Much has been made of McConaughy's Mud -- he does a fine job, and it's not his usual kind of role, but I don't see it as a huge stretch for a professional actor.",1384992000,34,5565,4.474257425742574

McConaughy plays a scruffy, down-on-his-luck, aggrieved outlaw who charms and captivates the children to help him survive.  His disquieting, almost sinister yet ambrosial portrayal of a multi-faceted outcast is brilliant; he is transformed as a human being by his interactions with the children as much as they are transformed by him.

Was Mud an obsessed stalker or was he a little under-par mentally? Hard to tell, and the movie never quite realizes it's potential because the plot has some inexplicable scenes.

In the end, several people are shot dead, Mud escapes and makes his way out of the area, leaving everyone thinking that he was shot and killed.

I like the freedom he and his friend have to explore & express themselves. I love the expansive feeling of the river scenes.

There's a bit of Huck Finn in here, a whole bunch on the cost of love and the loss of a way of life that is disappearing forever, mystery, and a great pay off for a set-up early in the flick.

This is an indie film done on a low budget, but look at the talent it drew. Some of the hottest and highest paid actors in Hollywood. They don't go low budget if the story isn't worth it. This story is. And good grief! Matthew McConaughey spends most of the movie trying to keep his shirt ON and I still loved it.

It's a deeply satisfying movie for those who enjoy a film that touches the heart and soul without the need of all the Hollywood plot points hit on cue (no cats are saved here). If you're looking for spectacle, this isn't the film for you. If everything has to be pretty, watch something else.

It's a Mark Twain type of story where two boys discover a boat in a tree in Arkansas. The two boys are amazing to watch.  They run that river in a boat like a kid rides his skate board. I liked the character played by Matthew McConaughey, (Mud).  I would suggest this for older children 12 and over. There is some profanity used by the boys, violence and sexual reference, but not too graphic. I also liked the way family values were taught.

5634231,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"A lovely film, full of strong characters and oddly beautiful locations. A classic coming-of-age story, particularly strong on the varying father/son dynamics between the men and boys.

5634232,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"""Mud"" is amazing.

It's the story of how two 14-year-old boys--Ellis and Neckbone--help Mud in his quest to avoid the law and regain his lost love, Juniper.

But it's really the story of how love is always imperiled, lost, renewed, deepened.  It's a coming-of-age story for Ellis, but it's also a growing-up story for Mud, the 35-year-old.

Everything works.  The intense hand-to-mouth Arkansas scenery, the timeless overpowering Mississippi River, the wonderful naturalistic acting, the terse and powerful script, roles that fit seamlessly together and reflect each other: Mud, his father-figure (Sam Shepard), Ellis and his father reflected in Mud, Neckbone and his father-figure uncle, Ellis's mother who reflects his questionable girlfriend, Juniper and her questionable relation to Mud, etc.

The story is suspenseful and powerful and unpredictable.

It's like an update of Huckleberry Finn: the helpless, ceaseless, intense struggle for freedom, the unending resourcefulness and optimism of a boy's point of view, which, amazingly, triumphs.

The overall feel of the movie is like ""Winter's Bone,"" but this is a very much brighter and warmer film, filled with quixotic hope that manages to transform a small world.",1381622400,2,1220,5.521505376344086
5634233,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Two fourteen-year old boys befriend a stranger (Matthew McConaughey) who has been living on their secret island in the Mississippi River.  His name is ""Mud,"" he's wanted for murder, and he's being followed by some very dangerous men.

This movie is a real gem; it's smart, honest, and edge-of-your-seat exciting.  It portrays the boys' hardscrabble life in their backwater town with uncompromising violence and grit and is also filled with decency, understanding, and many forms of love.

The two newcomers who play the boys are natural actors, both expressive and sympathetic.  McConaughey plays a tough guy who never had a break; he's an anti-hero to root for.  Reese Witherspoon has a small but important role as Mud's trampy girlfriend and Sam Shepherd and Joe Don Baker round out the excellent cast.

All of the characters are well-developed and the audience comes to really care about them.  The story blends good bits from ""Stand By Me,"" ""A Perfect World,"" ""Whistle Down the Wind,"" and even ""Tom Sawyer"" and is still unique.  It pulls no punches and is truly enjoyable.  4.5 stars.",1381536000,,1088,4.9944444444444445
5634234,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"While Matthew McConaughey is featured prominently on the poster for this movie and he is the title character, the film seems to be more influenced by movies like ""The Goonies,"" ""Stand by Me"" and more recently ""Super 8.""  I think fans of ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" would also appreciate the movie.  It offers a very vibrant sense of ""place"" that oozes through every frame.  The place is the Mississippi River as it runs through Arkansas and the people are those who make their lives from it.  The film centers on two 14-year-old Arkansas boys (Ellis and Neckbone) who value friendship and yearn for adventure and romance in equal measure.

I particularly liked both of the actors who played the boys Mud befriends as they both really believed that love and marriage is for ever and they couldn't understand why it was a normal course of events that in their neighbourhood it was far from that and they could see why Mud had killed as a result of the disrespect his long-time girlfriend had received at the hands of this thug type in Texas which had now caused his running with the father of the guy killed pursuing Mud with a group hell bent on returning the favor.,1381363200,,722,4.239130434782608

5634242,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"I don't know if it is my life experiences or what that got me to enjoy this movie. I enjoyed it. It is a duel story of two similar lives..Mud and Ellis. They are different stages but experiencing similar trials. The real morale of the story is being strong within yourself and recognizing when someone is not worth your effort and it is time to move on. Initially I thought ""here we go, a depressing struggle"" but it turned out to have some really good high notes. I think the young Ellis did a great acting job in this role. Some may knock the movie and it's profanity but it does fit the characters in relation to their lives. I would recommend watching!",1381190400,,656,4.341463414634147

Most of the time it spends on pushing through some very basic morals, chewing them down to the state of baby food: stealing is bad, marriage is good, divorce affects children....

I cared about the boys Ellis and Neckbone, and even though we know Mud isn't all good, I cared about what happened to him as well.  I have a feeling that the young boy who played Ellis - Tye Sheridan - is going to be a household name one day.

5634250,5,B00BJ0RGCU,Crazy good movie and one of those examples of perception is reality.  It also is a classic example of you see what you want to see and believe what you want to believe even when it often isn't the reality of the situation.  Love can exist but sometimes is not always meant to be.  Great story around all of these themes and as always Matthew McConaughey provides a character you cannot help to love even if they are not the best person out there.,1381104000,,446,4.285714285714286

In the middle of the movie I looked it up and sure enough it was....not the type of movie role I associate with her. Mathew was great in this movie also.

It was a bit drama, a bit mystery, a bit suspense, a bit adventure. You weren't sure who to believe at times.

This was not the current genre of over the top shootem up, bang, bang, blow things up, get shot 10 times, run over by a tank yet still be able to get up and fight off 40 bad guys to get the woman and be the hero.

5634326,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

When looking at a film like Mud it's hard to picture Matthew McConaughey being fit to play the titular character. Sure, he's had a handful of serious roles in the past, but majority of his work consists of Rom-Coms and things of that nature. However, it's this odd casting choice that makes Mud such a surprise hit. Not only is McConaughey able to pull of this role, but he does it with such ease that you would think he gets offered roles like this all the time. With that said, though, Mud is such a unique film that even McConaughey's stellar performance feels like a minor element in a much bigger picture.

There's no denying that Mud's title and marketing are a bit misleading. While the story does center around the titular Mud, he isn't necessarily the main character of the film. No, that titled is reserved for a young boy named Ellis (Tye Sheridan). Living in De Witt, Arkansas with his friend Neckbone (Jacob Lofland), the two boys come across a presumably deserted island while riding their boat one morning. However, it doesn't take long before they come across a man named Mud. After sharing his story with the boys, they learn that he is trying to reunite with his childhood sweetheart Juniper (Reese Witherspoon), but is on the run from some bounty hunters and needs their help.

One of Mud's strongest attributes is its cast and their performances, but the story's purity and unpredictability are what really connected with me. Because of this, there's no way to gain a real understanding of the story based on the brief synopsis provided above or on the back of the box. At its core, Mud is about a young boy's crippled understanding of love. Ellis believes that if two people love each other then they should be together, but everywhere he turns another relationship is crumbling. Whether its his parents marriage, the complicated relationship between Mud and Juniper, or his horrible experience with his first ""girlfriend"", Ellis' faith in true love slowly deteriorates as the film progresses and its almost heartbreaking to watch.

As a result, Mud's character progression makes itself known throughout the entirety of the film. Not only from Ellis, but from Mud as well. By the time you reach the story's conclusion you see drastic change in both of these characters and its arguably the result of them meeting each other. Ellis is no longer the naive boy blindly living in an imperfect world and Mud is finally able to move on and do the right thing for both himself and those around him. The viewer also sees a slight change in both Neckbone and Senior (Ray McKinnon), Ellis' father, but their growth isn't as apparent as the two leads.

Mud's casting is something that's been praised quite a bit by those who have seen the film, and for good reason. Not only were the actors perfect for their roles, but everyone involved did a phenomenal job of bringing these characters to life. Sheridan and McConaughey are bound to leave the biggest impression due to them receiving the most screen time, but it would be wrong to ignore the fact that Witherspoon, Lofland, McKinnon and Sam Shepard all delivered outstanding performances as well. While I would have liked to see more emphasis put on some of the characters like Juniper and Tom, it's no small feat that even the minor performances stood out as much as they did.

Finally, the film's sense of atmosphere is outstanding. Part of this is brought out by the cast's performances, but it's also accomplished through the film's score, composed by David Wingo. Both of these elements combined really help bring to life the gritty southern setting. David's compositions are dark, ominous, and, at times, even a little thrilling. They're a perfect fit for the story being told and without them there's no arguing that the film wouldn't be nearly as enjoyable.

Overall Score: 8/10 - Among other things, Mud is powerful and confident. The story is engaging, the setting is raw, and it's all tied together with some fantastic performances and an equally enjoyable score.

It has an appealing texture of river culture with some rural/Southern values thrown in.  It's actually refreshing in that it touches on life in the South (though not the Deep South) without the often-mandatory and sometimes heavy-handed, unflattering race relations bromides.  The film isn't as tight as we'd like but that aspect is offset somewhat by the interesting character of Mud, played well by Mathew McC.  Joe Don Baker as the protagonist doesn't live up to the advance depiction of him by Mud.  Sam Shepard, as the hesitant force for good in the background, conveys just the right scoop of mystery and authenticity.  The actor playing the central role of the 14-year-old kid does a good job of pulling the audience into the narrative.

Coming of age stories have always been a favorite of mine if they are done right. ""Stand By Me"" comes right to mind as a classic coming of age story. Well this Matthew McConaughey lead film is right up there as one of those done right. Now I have always liked Matt and never really understood the hate that people place on him. I will admit that I have liked some of his romantic comedies. I went to my Aunt's house to see this movie as we all do from time to time. After it was over we all agreed that ""Mud"" was a really good film.

Ellis and Neckbone are best friends and are always looking to have a good time and go on that great adventure we all dream of. They find their chance when they decide to go to a small island on the Mississippi in Arkansas. Once there they find a boat that is up in a tree, they have to investigate. They soon realize [after finding some interesting reading material] that someone is living there. A drifter named ""Mud"" who befriends the kids and even gets them to help him out. Just what he wants their help for leads the boys into the biggest and most dangerous adventure they will ever know.

Writer/director Jeff Nichols' did an excellent job with this film as his direction and script flowed so smoothly. A story like this in the wrong hands or off just a bit in the writing department could easily have been for lack of a better word boring. But Nichols' manages to keep you hooked until the credits role in this tale of love, betrayal, murder, and growing up. Also the look and feel of this film only adds to the experience, you almost feel like you are there.

This movie was also superbly acted by the entire cast, from the leads to the supporters. Most of the praise has gone to McConauahey and rightfully so as he has been on a role lately with his performances. He is great here as Mud and from what I have read he was actually who Nichols' wrote the part for in the 90's or something like that. Nay way I have to say that the two kids here [Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland] did just as good as their famous co star. This story really is more about them and Tye's ""Ellis"" in particular. It is through Ellis that the story moves and thus the role had to have been cast perfectly, it was. Also all three of these character's guardians were just as well cast and all play a major role in the personalities of the lead trio.

This was a great movie full of great scenery and cinematography that gives this Arkansas based film a feeling of being real. The characters here seem like real people and it is because of that that you actually care about these people. Now this is not the greatest movie ever made, at least to me, but it is a really good one that I would recommend. this is a really well made drama that has made my list of best I have seen this year.",1379376000,,2806,4.20817843866171

5634435,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"I had heard this movie was reminiscent of Stand By Me and I can see how people may think that as it focuses on two young boys that stumble onto something secret and have an adventure unbenownst to most everyone. I have to be honest, I wanted to see this movie because Matthew McConaughey is hot! And he didn't disappoint, hot as usual and such a good actor. You really believe he could easily be Mud. All the acting was really good but I wish Reese Witherspoon had a bigger part. It was nice to see her in an edgy role like this.
The scenery was beautiful in a sad sort of way, if that makes sense. How the people live and have to survive was a little depressing but works with the tone of the movie. I do wish they would have dug a little deeper into the characters more. I think that would have given it much more depth.

This is the first reason I watched the movie, but I have to say I absolutely loved this film and it's not just because I like the director's brother. I loved the scenes from a rural poor town in Arkansas and the simplicity of making a life with your hands. The two young boys are Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn on a deeper search for the meaning and possibility of what love and family truly is. They finally find that inadvertently at the end of the movie. I love the scenery, and the music is spot on. This is not a movie for the theater that everyone will love, but if you like poignant tales of deeper meaning on life's journey, then this is a fantastic movie to bring back the running around and fresh viewpoint of basic love and life of youth.",1378598400,,881,4.188235294117647

As I've gotten older, I've found that it is harder and harder for movies to hold my attention the whole time.  Whether I'm watching a certain trope play out for the hundredth time or am watching my thousandth car chase, no matter how well done, it just isn't as magic as it once was.  Despite, or perhaps because of, its relative lack of action, MUD was enchanting throughout.  The acting, writing, music, sound, cinematography, and character development all came together in a way that I found irresistible.  To me, the title of this review was not hyperbole.

5634457,3,B00BJ0RGCU,OK story about two boys who befriend a stranger named Mud.  it's never made clear why Mud is hiding on the island or why the bad guys are after him.  Good photography though.  It got a 98% liked rating on Rotten Tomatoes.  Everyone in Arkansas must be voting for it continuously.,1378598400,,279,4.411764705882353
5634458,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"A good story needs an interesting plot and interesting characters. Mud has both, and the acting is strong - all the way from Mathew McConaughey to the two boys, their parents, Reese Witherspoon, and the always dependable Sam Shepard. Set in the river country of southeast Arkansas, the film is rich with local color and gives us pause to reflect on love, loyalty, coming of age, and overcoming adversity.

5634463,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"""Mud"" was probably a hard film to market because its themes are difficult to pigeonhole.  Centered around the banks of the Mississippi it concerns itself with two fourteen year old friends, Ellis(Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland), whose bond is probably forged by less than ideal home lives.  Ellis' parents are on the cusp of separation and Neckbone lives with an uncle his natural parents nowhere to be found.  They have a secret hideaway on a desert island on the river and one day they find an interloper to their idyll, Mud(Matthew McConaughey).  Rumpled in appearance with a pistol strapped to his waist Mud relates a tale of him being on the run from bounty hunters because he killed a man who was abusing the love of his life, Juniper(Reese Witherspoon).  The boys are taken in by these tales of alleged gallantry and start doing favors for Mud.  It begins with them bringing him food, then passing messages to Juniper, and finally scrounging parts for Mud's boat.  The message here is twofold.  ""Mud"" illustrates the rocky road from adolescence to the teen years and secondly how the impressionable clamor for romance even if it is far removed from the truth.  McConaughey is absolutely spellbinding as the rascal Mud and the two newcomers are screen naturals who seem to be playing real teens and not facsimiles.  Director-writer Jeff Nichols not only crafts a terrific script but establishes an eerie mood to accompany his words.  ""Mud"" is a fascinating film that takes any number of twists and turns that you won't guess the ultimate outcome.  Just enjoy the boat ride.",1378512000,,1590,4.891791044776119

I especially liked the way the parents  and uncle interacted with them.  It was nice to see parents who care about their kids, despite the poor living conditions.  And I am dying to know, how did the boat get in the tree?",1378425600,,595,4.425925925925926

5634476,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"I love this movie. In fact, I bought it to share with others. MM did a terrific job and looked perfect for the part. It was reminiscent of growing up in earlier times and the way things and people looked and acted. The values expressed by the parents gave it depth. I give this movie four stars.",1378425600,,295,4.192982456140351
5634477,4,B00BJ0RGCU,I found this to be a slow southern all around nice movie. Keeps your interest right until the end. Lessons about moving on in life..any young man Ten or older would love this movie..as truly the main character is Ellis the fourteen year old. Another Matthew McConaughey movie to add to my library.,1378339200,,297,4.622641509433962
5634478,3,B00BJ0RGCU,I would say it was the worst mcconaughey movie i have seen.  usually his movies are excellent but this one was not great,1378339200,,120,4.217391304347826

5634480,5,B00BJ0RGCU,This is a FANTASTIC movie.  The story line is unbelievably deep in that Nichols mixes the beauty of the Mississippi River culture with the complexity of the human condition as experienced by some remarkable actors.,1378339200,,214,5.114285714285714

5634482,1,B00BJ0RGCU,"How did this movie ever get so many good reviews. It was horrible! It seemed to start out semi-interesting, but then fell flat.

5634491,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"I am not a big fan of Matthew McConaughey, but that did not stand in the way of me enjoying this film. Ultimately, the storyline was not what I thought it was going to be - not quite sure what I thought. However, it was good and it was different. The acting was on par, and it was nice to see a film that did not retell the same story. Although it would not rank amongst my top or favorites, I think anyone who rents this will not feel as though they wasted money or walk (or get up from the couch) being disappointed as I do more times than I would like to remember.",1378252800,,567,3.9391304347826086

5634493,5,B00BJ0RGCU,Great story. Great characters. All in all a great film. I'm not one to divulge storylines so to spoil the enjoyment of the film. So I'll just say this is a coming of age story executed masterfully by one hell of a storyteller. And the two lead boys in the film are very exceptional indeed. A definite watch in my opinion.,1378252800,,321,4.278688524590164

5634495,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"A friend recommended this, said I had to see it, and was not disappointed. Matthew McConaughey has never registered with me, but his performance is so strong. The real surprise was Ellis, the lead boy, and his friend, Neck Bone. This starts out as a small story and just grows and deepens.",1378252800,,289,4.576923076923077
5634496,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Enjoyed the movie and the young boys determination to help a person in need. My son and my grandsons told me about this so had to watch it, Thank you Amazon for the offer of such good movies.",1378252800,,191,4.052631578947368

5634498,3,B00BJ0RGCU,Kind of slow.. The plot was trite to me. I like watching movies with Matthew McConaughey don't know if the boys learned any lessons or not..,1378252800,,140,4.423076923076923

5634501,2,B00BJ0RGCU,"Previews looked good, but plot did not tie together.  Left many unanswered questions.  Wouldn't recommend.  Love Matthew M and Reese W.  Thought they would be great, but not on this one.",1378252800,,186,4.903225806451613
5634502,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"A very well-crafted drama. Contrary to what the trailers would have you believe, this is not an action movie, it's a drama through-and-through. Mostly centers on the three main characters, with a handful of supporting characters for balance. Languid setting of rural riverboat Mississipi. Love, honor, lies, good and bad intentions. We don't know what Mud's true intentions are until the end. The boys, on the other hand, are transparent throughout, providing a nice counterbalance to Mud. All in all, a very well thought out story, with deeper meanings just like the deeper undercurrents of the rivers that the story is set on.
Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys drama, character studies, a bit of suspense, a bit of action, and a bit of romance.",1378252800,,753,5.032
5634503,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Stellar performances by McConaughey, Witherspoon, and Sam Shepard.  The two boys were solid!  Fantastic script with some very moving family conflict and good suspense.",1378252800,,167,5.916666666666667
5634504,4,B00BJ0RGCU,McConaughey is getting better and better.  This is a very strong movie with a great dramatic performance from him. Enjoyable and not too heavy in tone.,1378252800,,151,4.8076923076923075
5634505,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"Take out Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, replace them with Matthew McConaughey and Resse Witherspoon, then take out Tokyo and replace it with Arkansas. Add in a total disregard for subtlety, and a shot of violence...walla, you are ""Lost in Mud.""

Acting: Solid
Set design: Solid
Script: Solid
Plot: Seriously? No

I liked the ending to ""Take Shelter."" For me that did not leave me hanging, and that movie balanced tense scenes with scenes of stillness, to masterful affect. Mud, however, did not really end with any sense of resolve at all. It found a strange spot to end, that did not seem to give me a reason for spending the last two hours or so with it.

Also: What kind of kid cries about unrequited adult love, but doesn't cry when a man punches him in the face? Did I miss something there? I want to like this, because I was not having a bad time watching it, but ultimately it's the character's motives which felt confusing and incomplete to me. I guess I'll give it three stars for quality, but that's the most I can give it.",1378252800,,1038,4.481481481481482
5634506,4,B00BJ0RGCU,This movie has a very small interesting cast and most of the players are adolescent boys. The suspense and tension of the story really carries through and McConaughey keeps us guessing as to his motives as well as his background. The boys discover him living on an island in the Mississippi that they thought was unknown to anyone else. We discover more about everyone's background as the complications accelerate and come to an action packed conclusion,1378252800,,453,4.973684210526316
5634507,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"""Mud"" what a movie bringing up so many issues we all face daily, crushes, love, jealousy, narcissistic personalities or what we psychologist use to call sociopaths.  We even saw a psychopath, who was the brother of the murdered man by Mud played by the star of the movie Matthew McConaughey, who I first saw in the movie  ""A Time To Kill"" and what a movie that was of the true south.  Guess what the South has not changed spent 6 months down in Georgia and there still is a Clan or KKK, as well as Bigots all over, who are willing to say the most unspeakable things about black people, when they are standing right there in a store talking to me.

Let's not forget the police in the South, oh how they truly hate us Northerners, those that were born and breed there.  You would think we started our Civil War here in the states where .  The controlling rich man, who is not afraid to use others to take the Law into his own hands.  King was played by ""Walking Tall"" star Joe Don Baker.

What a performance by Sam Shepard who played Tom Blankenship the neighbor, who lives across the river on another houseboat, who helped raise Mud when he found him in the swaps of the Bayou country.

Last but not least the Real Stars were Tye Sheridan who played Ellis and his best friend Jacob Lofland who played Neckbone, these two young men have a future in the movie business and I do hope they continue, as they will go far with their craft of acting.  You felt like you knew them, as I had friends, where I lived in Charlotte, New York like them growing up through thick and thin we were together at that age.  Playing baseball, telling stories, getting into trouble and getting caught by our parents or a neighbor.  Those were the good days when we were just starting to realize we were growing into adults like our parents, and that was scary for 12 and 15 year olds.  We wanted to love, but did not know much about it in those days, but we learned once in high school and there was a lot more to love than the sex, there was the emotions and feelings we all kept hidden and only told our best friends.  Two in our group of chums are gone one saved his troop in Viet Nam and the other got involved in drugs and passed, his choice with the alcohol to get him started.  Just like Ellis and Neckbone we all believed in Love, but really did not understand it, much like they did not.  It was a word you only said to the right person who came along in your life.  That is what Mud had with Juniper his childhood sweetheart played by Reese Witherspoon, who I almost did not recognize her, she has changed, but even as a child she could act and she did a wonderful amount of acting in this story of the childhood love that really never dies for Mud and Juniper.  They are connected throughout their lives.

This is a wonderful movie with a great cast of actors and the writing of Jeff Nichols tells us a story we all have been through in our childhood, with friends and parents, who confused most of us children.

Cast (in credits order)Matthew McConaughey ... Mud, Reese Witherspoon ... Juniper, Tye Sheridan ... Ellis, Jacob Lofland ... Neckbone, Sam Shepard ... Tom Blankenship, Ray McKinnon ... Senior and Sarah Paulson ... Mary Lee, were Ellis parents, Michael Shannon ... Galen, brother of the man Mud killed to save Juniper from dying, Joe Don Baker ... King,
Paul Sparks ... Carver, Bonnie Sturdivant ... May Pearl, who Ellis thinks is his girlfriend and Stuart Greer ... Miller.

5634510,4,B00BJ0RGCU,I was pleasantly surprised by the acting and the early plot. I fear the last 30 minutes were written by a studio hack rather than the original screenwriter giving it a somewhat contrived ending.

The boys in the movie are excellent, tho a couple of blemishes in a couple of scenes where the acting is off(blame the director for not catching it).

Tom the neighbor intrigued me. Mud called him assassin, then Tom revealed he was a sharpshooter. I have to go back and watch the old photographs on the wall at tom's place again. And his shooting at the dock. And mud saying he was on the CIA payroll and Cuba and 1963, JFK assassinated on the same year. Fifty year anniversary this year.

5634526,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Aside from some initial difficulty in understanding the two boys the initial part of the movie was charming.
Mud brought a new complexity to the boys' lives. The acting was quite strong as the boys and Mud tested one-another.
The film picked up in intensity as it progressed however the viewer never knew with certainty what was true and what wasn't. Uncertainty persisted as to the existence of love and ""who the characters really were."" The ending was not fairly tale but satisfying.

Then, about halfway into the movie, you realize it's all about a fairly dull and formulaic ""boy meets girl - boy loses girl - boy wants the girl back"" story.

Much of rest is disposable as it did not hold my interest. Witherspoon wasted in her poorly defined role, you just do not care about her. There's a story that's just OK, but it could have been better.",1377820800,,342,4.276923076923077
5634545,4,B00BJ0RGCU,Good story. I liked the whole 'boys will be boys' concept. Reminded me of being a kid and exploring and having fun with friends.,1377820800,,128,4.375
5634546,4,B00BJ0RGCU,The constant fear of wondering when the bad guys are going to surface keeps this movie interesting start to finish. Like Tom Sawyer for the 2010s...,1377820800,,148,4.730769230769231

5634548,4,B00BJ0RGCU,This a good movie without a lot of shoot 'em up action throughout. Good story. Really liked this one. Witherspoon in my opinion was not a high point of the flic but the rest of the cast did well.,1377820800,,195,4.0256410256410255

5634560,3,B00BJ0RGCU,The acting was good but the story kept me waiting for something interesting to happen.  I found the story to be just another 'boys on the river' tale.  Predictable formula.  My wife suspects that the positive reviews are based on women enjoying McConaughey's shirtless scenes.,1377734400,,276,5.088888888888889
5634561,2,B00BJ0RGCU,"HE FILM SHOWED A LOT OF PROMISE DUE TO THE INGENUITY OF THE TWO BOYS AND THE WAY THEY INTERACTED WITH MATTHEW McCONAGHEY.  HOWEVER, ULTIMATELY WAS NO REAL PAYOFF AND THE LAST THIRD (OR SO) OF THE MOVIE WAS A DUD.  THE ENDING LEFT ME SAYING ""WHAT THE H--L?",1377734400,,255,4.183673469387755

5634563,4,B00BJ0RGCU,The acting in this movie is superior. It has a powerful plot that reveals the culture of the poor who live on the gulf. The two boys who take the lead in the story are remarkable actors.,1377734400,,186,4.054054054054054
5634564,5,B00BJ0RGCU,I loved the story and the acting was superb! I would recommend this movie to anyone. Matthew McConaughey is great,1377734400,,113,4.7
5634565,2,B00BJ0RGCU,Long and drawn out.  Could have done a better job with character studies and relationships.  Child star stole the movie.,1377734400,,120,4.95
5634566,4,B00BJ0RGCU,A different movie with a different story that challenged Matthew McConaughy's acting ability. He rose to the occasion and provided a believable portrayal of a down and out emotionally challenged individual. The kids were fantastic. I might even watch it again.,1377734400,,260,5.365853658536586
5634567,5,B00BJ0RGCU,I was in a motel and was trying to have a quiet evening while someone slept in the room. I wanted a movie that would grab me and hold my attention. This movie did grab me from the start and carried me to the end. It was one I really enjoyed it and it turned an evening of being quiet and bored so someone could sleep into a very enjoyable evening. I give it 5 stars for that!,1377734400,,375,3.8205128205128207
5634568,4,B00BJ0RGCU,Mud is a great coming of age type movie with surprisingly strong acting by some young newcomers. Matthew McCaughnehy shows a differrent side from his normal comedic characters and is excellent as the mysterious Mud.,1377734400,,215,5.171428571428572
5634569,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Matthew McConaughey was great in this movie, because his speech and mannerisms were so realistic.  I live in the south and know what a fake southern accent sounds like!  Good story, good acting... Not 5 stars but still a movie worth watching!",1377734400,,242,4.738095238095238
5634570,4,B00BJ0RGCU,One of Matthew McConaughey's best efforts in a long time.  It was good to see him in a story with some grit (no pun intended) to it.,1377734400,,132,3.888888888888889

5634572,1,B00BJ0RGCU,"Boring, slow, contrived. Excellent performance by McConaughey but the script lacked substance and left too many loose ends. The movie itself lost focus about 30 minutes in and never got back on track. A disappointment unfortunately.",1377734400,,232,5.472222222222222

5634574,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"I think it's because of the big build up, I was expecting more. For me Lincoln Lawyer was much better. The acting was very good it's just the plot dragged on. What really lost me was trying to sell me on Reese Witherspoon being a beautiful hard drinking, trashy sex pot... I was like really? Reese Witherspoon? She was so misscast in this film.",1377734400,,344,4.390625
5634575,4,B00BJ0RGCU,My husband and I really enjoyed this movie. The plot was great. A love story without any inappropriate scenes and no bad language.,1377734400,,130,4.695652173913044
5634576,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Although I love Matthew, those two little boys were my favorite.  So very authentic.  Being from the south, I can tell they are true southern boys....they run, jump, get dirty and just overall act like real boys would in their environment.  Authenticity runs high on my scale of appreciation!",1377734400,,292,4.918367346938775

5634580,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"However; This movie was very good. It was easy to identify with the characters. McConaughey was excellent! I also very much enjoyed the ""Father"" of the young man. I will so watch this again.

5634583,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Mud is a story about two boys, Ellis and his friend Neckbone, who find a man named Mud hiding out on the Mississippi.  Without giving away the plot, just want to say the story is exciting and has a surprise ending.  Matthew McConaughey has always been one
of my favorite actors.  Highly recommend this movie.",1377648000,,308,4.5636363636363635
5634584,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"This is a good story about a couple of kids helping a lost soul played by Matthew McConaghey.  The kids' roles are very well done.  The acting keeps the movie entertaining, especially following the actions of the two young boys playing their roles.  The movie keeps interest level from the beginning through the exciting climax.  I would recommend it to adults and older teens.",1377648000,,377,4.84375
5634585,2,B00BJ0RGCU,This movie just dragged on without a real point to it.  I did not enjoy watching these dysfunctional characters. I found it quite boring and nothing about the Mud character really engaged me or interested me.  I can't recommend this one.,1377648000,,237,4.7560975609756095
5634586,2,B00BJ0RGCU,It was an interesting story but very depressing.  The amount of people hired to hunt him down didn't make sense or the relationship he had with the gal.,1377561600,,152,4.428571428571429
5634587,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"It's nice to know that they still make movies where you actually have to pay attention to follow the story line and where real human characters populate the screen. Nice acting all around and like last year's Beasts Of The Southern Wild, young kids have predominant roles. Simple story really but with nice touches and with characters you care about. If your attention span is measured by minutes between big blow up scenes, Don't bother seeing this movie. But for one's that want to see a movie that makes a real attempt at character building and story than this is a nice attempt worth watching.",1377561600,,597,4.695238095238095

5634595,4,B00BJ0RGCU,I liked it. Thought the story line was very interesting. Love gone bad. How you never really get over someone you loved.,1377561600,,120,4.5
5634596,5,B00BJ0RGCU,I liked this movie.  The kid actors are really good especially Tye Sheridan (from 'Tree of Life').  The plot is kinda slow but unique.  I enjoyed the Arkansas river scenery and the side characters like Sam Shepard and Michael Shannon.  There's an almost film noir feel at times which works well to give a little edge but fortunately it doesn't go overboard into complete gritty darkness. I'm hoping to see Tye in some more good films soon.,1377561600,,439,4.662337662337662
5634597,3,B00BJ0RGCU,"Good acting, especially from the younger actors, but not enough story. Too easy to guess what would happen and too unbelievable.",1377561600,,128,5.142857142857143
5634598,4,B00BJ0RGCU,Above average movie..  Great story line and cast.  The lack of the F word  and the MF made it an enjoyable family movies. The violence was acceptable but not excessive. (Done with purpose rather than for shock value,1377561600,,215,4.605263157894737

MUDD is not that case. It is a fresh and wonderful movie!!!!!
The children in this story steal the show, the acting was phenomenal by all the cast members.  I didn't think it was possible to ""ugly up"" Mathew McConaughey , but they did.  It was a moving movie.  Worth seeing twice.",1377561600,,364,4.246376811594203

5634606,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Lots of reviews already. I won't try to add. I will just say I loved it. Just people in messy circumstances down in a red state. The kids were great.

Tough boys. The older one had a weakness in that he romanticized love to a fault. Thus he sadly identified strongly with the drifter who killed to protect his screwed up girl friend. It was not really so unrealistic as boys and girls go. There was plot uncertainty, yet you could be sure that the trajectory would be tragic because this was their shared tragic flaw. It was interesting to see this side by side in a boy and a man at the same time.

The vendetta society angle was also interesting. The old man who lost a son was so intent on vengeance that you could just feel that he would also loose his remaining son in his passion-driven obsession. Again, a tragic trajectory as I saw it.

Strong misguided passions and hard lives in a hard society. Solid film.",1377475200,,916,4.345029239766082
5634607,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Mud is simply the best film I've seen this year, period. I loved all the well-developed characters. Michael Shannon is one of my favorite actors and though his role was only as a side-character, he made the ""Crazy Uncle"" Galen shine! And of course, Matthew McConaughey dirties up real good for the role of a lovable criminal. Great coming-of-age in the South fun!",1377475200,,363,4.777777777777778

What mattered more was that these two loners had few people to count on and formed a friendship based upon a fighting spirit to survive.",1377475200,,348,4.688524590163935
5634616,4,B00BJ0RGCU,It was the most twisted love story.  Unrequited love taken too far.  But it kept my interest.  There was plenty of suspense.  The development of the boys characters was also very good.  The 2 young actors were real stars!,1377388800,,221,4.564102564102564

MM is Mud living temporarily on an island and discovered by two young boys trying to recover an old boat washed up in the top of a tree. And that's how it begins. R.

5634673,2,B00BJ0RGCU,"The product, Amazon's VOD player, played very well. Clear, with no hiccups.
The movie itself....Some have said that this was a 'Coming of age' kind of storyline, that it was more about the boy and his difficult life, than the man named Mud. Yes, the film did focus on the boy more, but it equally focused on Mud and his hard life. The acting was superb. The cinematography was at times beautiful, as well as dark and gritty. The soundtrack was very, very subtle, allowing the viewer to hear the surroundings, making it even more realistic. For parents and those concerned about the rating: There are no nude scenes. No sex scenes. Yet there is a boat-load of foul language. No 'F' bomb that I heard, yet within the first 10 minutes of the film I counted 9 'S' words alone; after counting to 15 I stopped keeping track, and a slew of other foul words just kept on from there. It was just too much foul language, and really not needed. Also quite a bit of gun violence, with people being shot at close range. Boys fighting each other, a grown man punching a boy in the face. Sex references, including porn magazines, and references to girls breasts.
Spoiler Alert....For me this movie can be summed up in one word, tragic. No happy endings here. Ellis the boy ends up with the life he didn't want. His father ends up with the life he didn't want. When you start to care about Mud, you then learn that his trials were all for nothing and in the end he doesn't learn a thing. You are lead to care about Mud's girlfriend Juniper, only to dislike her later. The characters seem to be thrown together at which point they all experience tragedies and hard times, then they all sort of go their own way, and life goes on with no one really happy (or caring) about anything. Two hours of unhappiness, dirt, violence, and foul language.",1377043200,,1825,4.450746268656716

5634681,1,B00BJ0RGCU,"The motion picture ""Mud"", is a constant reminder of bad story lines and terrible plots. First off was actor ""Mathew McConaughey"", who petraid a muderer on the run. The actor was hiding out on a river island, with a deserted boat in the trees and a history of plain boring. Two kids, portrayed by ""Tye Sheridan (Ellis)and Jacob Lofland (neckbone)"",  find him and help to get the boat water ready. Into the movie, the two boys come in contact with ""Muds'"" enemies and girlfriend. A truly long and boring movie indeed. The action scenes were as followed, Ellis is fourteen years old and punches another boy and Muds' victims brother. He gets snake bit and house boat shot up in the end. Mud saves Ellis and gets shot at in the end of the movie, gets wounded and miraculously shows up on the deserted boat headed for open water. All of this occurs within days, but drags out for hours. Thank God for dollar rentals, because if I had spent the movie theatre admission price of seeing this waste of film and time, I would've been very sick. The story line could've had more twists and turns. The actors themselves should've had better lines to read from and more coaching. A better plot would've improved the exhausting tasks of keeping my eyes open during the film. This movie reminds me of ""The Lincoln Lawyer"", in which it dictates the same boring story line and poor attempts at a plot. Unfortunately for myself, I guess giving actors and directors another chance at a good movie is simply impossible!

I guess it was a little different for me because of where it was filmed so it was a little strange to see those places in a movie.  Now, Matthew McConaughey has a natural accent so he didn't have to change too much for the movie.  It made it seem more natural anyways.  But the two boys in this movie had a thick accent that even I couldn't understand and I have lived here all my life.  Even though I am sure that there are thousands of movies just like this, and this was not a high budget film, it seemed unique.  I enjoyed it just as much as some of McConaughey's other movies.

5634718,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"""mud"" has many things going for it -- a strong script, great acting, believable and compelling characters, and the foreboding of cottonmouth country. the four subplots (marriage, reunion, revenge and first love) are motivated by the same premise: how a woman can make a man suffer, and where that can lead when love goes bad. each subplot is enriched by various male relationships: father/son, love competitor or mortal enemy, same age buddy or cross generational mentor. there is shadow and light across every relationship and all the characterizations blend as a result of superb casting. the script has a clockwork quality in which every detail has significance in the whole; both the cinematography and sequence editing are technically impressive but shaped to tell the human story. the focus is on relationships in a small southern river town, how the people came to where they are and how they move forward; you're pulled into the story as if you're living it, and this dictates a leisurely pace that is part of the storytelling and that allows you to linger with scenes the way you'd pause over a memorable passage in a novel. i want to alert viewers to the subtle fairytale elements in the film -- a boat in a tree, a lone boy approaching an island forest at night, a damsel in distress standing on a balcony, a sky that fills with birds when a man talks of love, a woman who casts dark spells on men, killers who plot revenge with prayer, two boys performing the quests set for them by a man who appears from nowhere wearing talismans and spinning tales -- these magical elements serve as highlights on the realism and guide our emotional intuitions about the characters. mcconaughey gives an insightful and unsentimental performance as the drifter who struggles to master his past and his passion, tye sheridan is very strong as the boy trying to become a man despite betrayal by those he trusts, and ray mckinnon is deeply affecting as the father trying to salvage his family, home and masculine identity. it's a mark of the high quality of the production that sam shepard and michael shannon accepted relatively minor roles to be a part of it. i loved this film, and i will be very disappointed if it does not get some 2013 best picture nominations.",1376697600,,2261,4.755725190839694
5634719,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"""Mud"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Two boys, Ellis and his friend Neckbone, who find a man named Mud hiding out on an island in the Mississippi. Mud describes fantastic scenarios -- he killed a man in Texas and vengeful bounty hunters are coming to get him. He says he is planning to meet and escape with the love of his life, Juniper, who is waiting for him in town. Skeptical but intrigued, Ellis and Neckbone agree to help him. It isn't long until Mud's visions come true and their small town is besieged by a beautiful girl with a line of bounty hunters in tow.

The cast led by Matthew McConaughey (as Mud), Tye Sheridan (as Ellis), Sam Shepard (as Tom) & Reese Witherspoon (as Juniper) is brilliant. The directing & story & screenplay by Jeff Nichols is brilliant.

The music by David Wingo is brilliant. The cinematography by Adam Stone is brilliant. The film editing by Julie Monroe is brilliant. The casting by Francine Maisler is brilliant. The production design by Richard A. Wright is brilliant. The art direction by Elliott Glick is brilliant. The set decoration by Fontaine Beauchamp Hebb, set dressings by Mitchell Crisp, Henson Flye, Matthew Martin, Joey Santoro, James Smith & Karen Young is brilliant. The costume design by Kari Perkins is brilliant. The special make-up effects design by Matthew W. Mungle & Clinton Wayne is brilliant. The special effects supervised by Everett Byrom III is brilliant. The visual effects supervised by Jason Schugardt & coordinated by Zafar Janjua & Anastasia Von Rahl is brilliant. The stunts coordinated by Mickey Giacomazzi is brilliant.

This is a brilliant, well-made and well-done drama that is entertaining and intriguing. It is also an interesting movie, thematically and visually. Matthew McConaughey gives his best performance to date, thus far, as Mud and Tye Sheridan gives a star-making performance as Ellis. Jeff Nichols has directed his best film to date, thus far. This is one of the best movies of the summer season and one of the best movies of the year, if not, the best movie of the year, thus far.

5634756,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"At the heart of `Mud' is a coming of age tale about adolescence, innocence and love.  This was surprising to me, and quite moving to be honest.  I didn't expect something so honest and `simple' to come from a film seemingly so much darker.  That isn't to say that `Mud' doesn't have thrilling elements, and it certainly reaches levels of darkness, but at its core it is something softer, kinder and more delicate.

It is richer than I expected.

`Mud' tells the story of fourteen year-old Ellis, a young boy living on a river in Arkansas.  His family is riddled with turmoil as his parents fight in the open air and make plans to separate.  Ellis and his friend Neckbone escape their homelives by venturing down river to a small island where Neckbone found a boat in a tree that the two plan to use as a clubhouse of sorts.  The problem is that the boat is occupied by a strange man named Mud who is awaiting the arrival of his girlfriend, Juniper.  He cannot leave the island, for reasons he leaves a mystery, but strikes a friendship with the boys, who agree to bring him food in exchange for the boat.

While the main draw to the film is of course the mystery surrounding Mud's backstory, and don't get me wrong because it certainly is exciting and worth sticking around for, the real soul of the film comes from the development of Ellis and the unveiling of his emotional development.  As Ellis reflects on his homelife, his parent's marriage and the threat to lose his home, the girl he thinks he loves and the realization that love is not as easy as you want it to be, and then having him live vicariously through Mud, soaking in his stories and falling in love with his charm and the ideals he represents, he become drawn to Ellis and completely enwrapped in his tale.  While Mud's story may be the flashy central point in the story, it is Ellis's tale that haunts us long after the credits have finished rolling.

I'm excited for where Jeff Nichols' career is going to lead him.  I have yet to see `Shotgun Stories', but both `Mud' and `Take Shelter' are remarkable films that show so much unique vision and potential for greatness.  I see a masterpiece in his near future.  `Mud' is through provoking and atmospheric, using the river and the light to create such charged appeal.  Even the running length feels organic thanks to the way that Nichols worked out every detail.

I would like to take a second to address Hollywood's ridiculous bias against young male actors.  All this attention on Matthew McConaughey's career revival and his performance here being a `career best' (he's very good, surprisingly) only masks the fact that this film is not his.  Mud, while a title character, is a supporting one.  This is purely Ellis's story, and young Tye Sheridan carries this film with such authentic grace.  In fact, both he and Jacob Lofland are better than McConaughey here.  If Ellis had been a female and had been played by someone like Hailee Steinfeld then you can bet your bottom dollar someone would be trying to push for a category fraud campaign to get her a Supporting Actress Oscar nomination.  Sadly, no one will do that for Sheridan, despite the fact that his performance is achingly effective.  He handles everything with such natural enlightenment.  You can feel him embrace Mud with a sense of adolescent wonderment, capitalizing on Ellis's innocence and naivety and yet as he discovers the nasty truth regarding love and life he begins to melt away and become hardened.  Contrasting his father's jilted views with Mud's fantastical coloring to strike an accurate balance is beautifully played and honestly felt.

It's just a beautifully honed performance.",1376524800,,3682,4.7109375

In this film Nichols expanded his canvas and scope.
It is a well-made drama about relationships, failed hope/love/marriages, friendship and growing up pains.
Matthew McConaughey continues his impressive acting streak although the star of this film belongs to Tye Sheridan,
the young actor who played the central character.
The storyline and development, the characters, the settings, the acting are all very fine.

5634779,5,B00BJ0RGCU,I thought this movie was surprisingly good-- and certainly a breath of fresh air for Matthew M.  The young boy who played Ellis was fantastic and should be nominated for an Oscar.,1376352000,,179,4.59375

It's 2+ hours long and I never walked away or even paused it.  I read one reviewer say this movie is like reading a novel and I agree.  Great characterization across the board.  Some are barely on screen but they all get a nice little twist, a nice moment, to reveal themselves.  Real good.

Edit:  I read the 1-star reviews because I was just wondering what the heck were they thinking.  I have to say they must've not been in the mood for a dramatic picture. They probably should've watched something like ""Space Pirates Hangover""!  This film is pulling 98% on Rotten Tomatoes.  Ignore the 1-stars.",1376352000,,738,4.425373134328358

5634783,4,B00BJ0RGCU,We were entertained. What we most enjoyed was that the movie was not a replay of the same theme that you've seen in  twenty other movies. The theme was unique in it's concept. The character and commitment display by the two young boys is a good life lesson to today's youth.,1376352000,,274,4.372549019607843

5634787,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"This was a great movie. I watched it kind of late at night, and it moved sort of slowly, so it was a bit hard to stick with at times. It's the kind of movie you want to be invested in.

Basically, the story is about two kids, Ellis and Neckbone, who stumble upon a drifter living in a boat that has inexplicably ended up in a tree in the middle of a small river island. The two are drawn to this mysterious man, especially Ellis, who is dealing with some family troubles at home.

The story is fairly compelling, but it requires some patience. Aside from one sequence, it never gets particularly action packed, and so the payoff is really an emotional one, but it's a powerful emotional punch. From his parents, to Matthew McConaughey's drifter, to his friend's uncle, Ellis pays close attention to the examples of romantic love he sees around him. At it's heart, this story is all about Ellis' coming-of-age, especially in terms of how he views women, and how he views love. It's a very powerful story, and I remember waking up the next day, and thinking a lot throughout the day about Ellis' transformation, and thinking a lot about love.

It sounds sort of cliche the way I write it, and maybe it won't hit you the same way it hit me, but the movie didn't feel cliche. I found it very powerful, and I would highly recommend this movie.",1376352000,,1338,4.4089068825910935

There was a lot of talk about McConaughey's weight loss for this picture. I thought it had to be a good script for him to put himself through that. It was worth it. The two boys in the beginning on the river reminded me of Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer. Then they meet Mud on an island and he is hiding out from some people. There are some twists and turns that involve a girl. It was not the same old predictable movie. I didn't think about what else I could be doing with my time or wonder when it would be over. I was hooked the whole time and wondered what was going to happen next. The acting was great. There was none of that type cast stuff, where the people had planned this same character in five other movies.

I knocked a star off for sound and editing.

Loved the actors and thought the story line was very intriguing, it kept me wanting to see more. I was disappointed with the little kids cussing though. I guess the director thought this was necessary due to the boys upbringing or the lack there of. So if you are planning on watching this with small kids you might want to take that, and the sexual discussions that take place within this movie, into consideration. Otherwise, I absolutely loved this movie! I would watch it again and most definitely think it was worth the rental price, and I will be suggesting it to family and friends.

5634842,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Mud is a movie about two boys, Ellis and his friend Neckbone who find a man named Mud hiding out on an island in the Mississippi. Mud describes fantastic scenarios-he killed a man in Texas and vengeful bounty hunters are coming to get him. He says he is planning to meet and escape with the love of his life. Skeptical but curious, Ellis and Neckbone agree to help him.

Although the movie at times dragged a little and I thought a bit too long, the story was entertaining and was well acted.

Matthew McConaughey, Tye Sheridan, Jacob Lofland all did excellent acting jobs and were very believable in their roles. The movie gave the true feel of riverboat life. Although the action part of the movie happened mostly towards the end, it was worth waiting for the climax.

Mud is definitely a worthwhile watch and a good dramatic suspense movie with a touch of action thrown in.",1375920000,,876,4.56687898089172

5634845,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"`He's not dangerous.'
Writer/director Jeff Nichols presents a film with many levels of meaning and entertainment. It is at once a thriller of sorts, a mystery, a love song that manages to touch every character in the drama, a character study of a lovesick criminal on the run and a coming age story for a 14 year old boy discovering all the permutations of love and belonging and family and needs. It is a remarkable stage for the talents of Matthew McConaughey and Tye Sheridan and will likely place them in the Oscars race.

The best synopsis of the film has been summarized by Roadside Attractions and is referenced here: `14 year-old Ellis (Tye Sheridan) lives on a makeshift houseboat on the banks of a river in Arkansas with his parents, Mary Lee (Sarah Paulson) and Senior (Ray McKinnon). He sneaks out early one morning to meet his best friend, Neckbone (Jacob Lofland). Neckbone, also 14, lives with his uncle, Galen (Michael Shannon), who makes a hardscrabble living diving for oysters. The two boys set out to an island on the Mississippi River, where Neckbone has discovered an unusual sight-a boat, suspended high in the trees, a remnant of an extreme flood some time in the past. They climb the tree and into the boat only to find fresh bread and fresh footprints. Realizing that they are not the only ones who have discovered the treehouse boat, they decide to leave. When they reach the shore, they find the same footprint in their boat. And that's when they meet Mud (Matthew McConaughey). Mud is a gritty, superstitious character; his clothes are dirty, his tooth is cracked, and he needs help. He tells the boys he will give them the treehouse boat, his current hideout, in exchange for food. Neckbone is reluctant, but Ellis brings food to Mud, and they develop a tentative friendship. Ellis learns that Mud has killed a man in Texas, and police and bounty hunters are looking for him, but Mud is more concerned about reuniting with his longtime love, Juniper (Reese Witherspoon). Ellis, who has recently developed his own crush, agrees to help Mud escape with Juniper. Ellis and Neckbone carry out bold schemes in an effort to protect Mud and relay messages to Juniper, who is holed up in a fleabag motel, under constant surveillance by Carver (Paul Sparks), a Texas bounty hunter. Carver and his gang are intent on capturing Mud, on orders from the cold-blooded King (Joe Don Baker). As the boys risk everything to reunite these seeming mythical lovers, Ellis's own ideas about love and romance are challenged by the strains in the relationships closest to him: his parents' marriage is dissolving while he himself falters in his efforts to impress May Pearl (Bonnie Sturdivant). Through it all, Ellis struggles to look for an example of love that he can believe in, learning about the unspoken rules and risks of love and the reality of heartbreak.'

As important and impressive as the story is the overwhelming aspects of the film are the moments when the concept and meaning of love is shared  - many times, by many people, in many ways.  It is insightful and deeply moving. This is a film that proves that a fine entertainment visually can also be a great cerebral fix! Grady Harp, August 13",1375920000,2,3217,4.770197486535009

The storyline was interesting right off the bat, and kept me invested until the end of the movie. Yes, Matthew M. does give a strong, nuanced performance, but the young teen boys are the ACTUAL stars of the film. The emotional range they portray is impressive for such young actors, and I believe they each have a long acting career ahead of them! The one puzzling aspect of the film to me was why Reese Witherspoon took the part of Mud's ex-girlfriend? The script gave her absolutely nothing to do but stand around with a ""hangdog"" look. Mostly I felt that this film was worth watching, because it is such a great portrait of how some people are chaos-junkies and create endless drama for themselves and others. All of Mud and Juniper's problems were brought on by themselves. (Don't we ALL know people who can't seem to keep the negative drama out of their lives?)

5634851,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Those giving Nichols' latest film poor reviews must be those who found films like Mall Cop to be entertaining.  ""Mud"" is a rich and complex narrative that movies slowly at first.  The influence of William Faulkner, Mark Twain, and Cormac McCarthy is most obvious in the script's slow unfurling but it is no way a fault.  All three authors have a rich talent of developing sophisticated and complex characters with sparing dialogue.  Nichols does not differ from that style in his own writing.  Although Mud (McConaughey) is the title character he is by no means the protagonist; Ellis (Tye Sheridan) steals the story.  Ellis' teen love affair and its intensity mirrors that of Mud and Juniper(Witherspoon) but is not ready to grasp its complexity of dysfunction. On the surface, Ellis' presumed adolescent simplicity makes him a sounding board for all other relationships in the story.

Many have billed this movie as a thriller.  It is not.  It is much deeper and profound study of human relationships and the principles that drive our actions.  It is not a quick thrill adrenaline rush like ""The Call"" for example.  The ending of the film is intense but if you are expecting fast-paced action this film is not in that genre.  ""Mud"" is a brilliant character study more akin to ""Huck Finn"" meets ""Stand By Me.""  Nichols has created both a cinematic and budding literary masterpiece.",1375747200,,1382,4.905172413793103

I have to admit that I am a McComaughey fan, I think he is a very good actor and doesn't get the recognition that he deserves, mainly due to his rom-com movie choices, but I have a feeling that this will change all that. He seems very comfortable in this role and it really suits him. The movie has a little Slingblade quality to it and I think that helps the movie. This is the kind of movie where you aren't really sure who is honest and it keeps you guessing the whole time waiting for someone's true colors to show and see if your intuition is right. This is a lesser know movie but I think is one of the first Oscar contenders of the year not only for McConaughey, but also for the kid who plays Ellis and a dark horse best picture candidate. This is a very good movie and I recommend it. Overall, a movie that should finally give McConaughey the recognition he deserves. I give it a B+.",1375660800,,1266,4.088353413654619

I like all genres of movies; i am just a movie person. And in choosing movies to watch, I prefer the ones that serve their purpose. As a film that is one of a kind, Mud does just that and more.
Mud stars Matthew McConaughey as the title character with a unique supporting cast that includes Michael Shannon as Galen, Tye Sheridan as the other main character Ellis, Jacob Lofland as Ellis's friend Neckbone,Sarah Paulson as Ellis's mom, and Reese Witherspoon as Juniper. The acting in Mud is well drawn up and beautifully shot.

The storyline is a honorable mention. It is very southern, but it is heavily centered around the two young boys and Mud. Expect an enjoyable combination of drama, occasional humor, and just the right amount of action for this movie.
 It is still considerably early in the year, but this IS one of 2013's movies to watch and is one that will be talked about(in a good way) for quite awhile.
To close, Mud fires on all four cylinders and executes all three acts to perfection.

This is a coming of age movie that even if you aren't a McConaughey fan, you will probably enjoy it.  No one character, including McConaughey as Mud, really has the screen to themselves to the degree you feel like they are the movie.  Everyone in the movie is great.  Most of the time is with the two boys and Mud.  Mud is a down on his luck man that got into trouble trying to watchout for a woman he loves, played by Reese Wetherspoon.  Now Mud is hiding out because he killed a man.  We find ourselves drawn to him because he isn't a truly bad man, but a man that believes in a lucky shirt and bonfires to ward off evil.  The camera work is good along with the directing, acting, story, scenery, sets, make up, wardrobe, and music.  It is just a nice movie that the whole family can enjoy.

McConaughey has never been better, and the two boys are equally excellent. It even has the great Sam Shepard as the ""father"" of the title character Mud.

Two 14 year old boys, find the boat and claim it as their own, until they discover the residence of Mud.  In an unusually remarkable performance by Tye Sheridan as Ellis, he portrays an honest sense of age transition most of us will remember.  His best friend Neckbone (a nice first time performance by Jacob Lofland) is an orphan being raised by his uncle (Michael Shannon who starred in director Jeff Nichols only other film, ""Take Shelter"").  Ellis believes in people and he believes in love, having fallen for a high school senior.

Neckbone is leery of people, including Mud but is guided by Ellis's instincts.  Together they work to get Mud and Juniper paired up and help with their escape from the law and the family of the man Mud killed back in Texas.  Ellis's own life is falling apart.  His father (Ray McKinnon) and mother (Sarah Paulson) are separating.  The mother is tired of living on the river in a houseboat.  Father and son like the arrangement.  Sam Shepard has a turn as the man who was a father-figure to Mud and who gives clues to his neighbor Ellis about the Mud-Juniper relationship.  Mud and Ellis form a special bond.  Both are incurable romantics which keeps them focused on their goal.

This is a superbly acted, beautiful film; well written, with wonderful photography and a perfect musical score.

The Blu ray transfer from Lionsgate is just as good as the film.  With a 1080p resolution and a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, the film sparkles with some excellent lighting choices showing well on video.  Often using hand held cameras, we get some excellent close-ups, which offers excellent detail.  Good contrast prevails throughout.  Likewise the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is superb.  As noted, much of the film takes place on a remote, uninhabited island in the middle of a river.  The surrounds are in play here as the natural environment is well recorded, birds, bugs, wind envelope the viewer.  The musical score sounds great as well.  Subtitles include Spanish and English SDH.  Extras include a commentary track with director/writer Nichols and a separate segment where he details his desire to make the film.  Three other brief pieces focus on the casting, the locale and the sequence called the Snake Pit.",1371427200,15,2717,4.772532188841201

Another home run for Matthew McConaughey, this film combines grief, action, and compelling drama in one package that will certainly hold your attention for its two-plus hour duration.

5634892,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"While some movies that Matthew McConaughey is in are great, few movies are great because Matthew McConaughey is in them.  Now, that may seem like a cheap shot (and it is), but it should be overlooked because Mud represents his best film and performance since 2002's Frailty.

Mud is a slice of Americana.  Two young Arkansas boys, Ellis and Neckbone, happen upon a runaway convict hiding out on a deserted island in the Mississippi.  McConaughey plays the convict known only as ""Mud.""  He is charming and mysterious, and as his story begins to come into focus, the boys are swayed to help him fix up a broken down boat so he can meet up with his girlfriend Juniper (Reese Witherspoon) and escape down the river to freedom.  Now if this sounds slightly familiar, perhaps you're thinking of another slice of Americana where two boys try to help a social outcast find his family and escape captivity by traversing the Mississippi River: Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.  The parallels between Mud and Finn are actually quite numerous, most notably that both examine the trials of a young boy's integrity.  Whether or not director and writer Jeff Nichols is intentionally invoking Finn, he has nevertheless created a fine companion to the 1885 novel.

The success of Mud lies in the hands of McConaughey and relative newcomer Tye Sheridan, who plays Ellis.  As the unlikely relationship forms between them, Nichols is able to weave in significant observations about fatherhood, childhood, love, and respect.  Protection is a recurring motif that truly sits at the heart of the film.  In fact, known for taking his shirt off, it is ironic that in Mud, McConaughey's shirt remains on as a symbolic form of protection.  Consequently, it is actually quite significant when it is ceremoniously and inevitably removed.

Mud is certainly no technical achievement and will no doubt be lost in the shuffle as the flashy summer blockbusters start releasing, but it is a strong resonating film full of the kind of tension, drama, humor, and realism Mark Twain would be proud of.  A-",1370131200,16,2083,4.92836676217765
5634893,4,B00BJ0RGCU,"Genre-wise I would say ""Mud"" is best described as a coming of age drama thriller. Matthew McConaughey sporting the most terrifying prosthetic dentures in film history outside of the horror genre, stars as the title character Mud. As good as he is in his role and as good as the other adult actors are, the film ultimately belongs to the young teen actors Tye Sheriden (The Tree of Life) and Jacob Lofland (film debut). I actually would love to see these boys get noticed come Oscar season but that isn't likely to happen.

Film Breakdown
After a flood in a small Arkansas town, two teenage boys discover a boat lodged in a tree in a wooded area near the river. They quickly discover that someone resides in the boat's cabin area. The boys soon find out that it is Mud living in the boat and that he is hiding out for reasons I won't say in this review. In no time road blocks are set up to try and find Mud, one of the boys lets Mud know of this development and that is when Mud realizes he must flee by river. There is more to all this involving the Reese Witherspoon character whom is staying in a near by motel and supposed to be joining Mud in this escape plan. Amongst all this our two teens learn some valuable lessons about life and love.

The film is just over 2 hours and also stars Sam Shepard, Sarah Paulson, Ray McKinnon and Michael Shannon which I thought would've been great as the bad guy here but Shannon is playing a lot of bad guys lately with ""The Iceman"", ""Man of Steel"" and ""Premium Rush"" that is was also nice to see him play a regular guy and even provide some of the films comic relief.

Overall highly recommended to all audiences! The film has mild language and gun violence, no sex or nudity. I would approve the film for 10 years and up.",1369699200,126,1765,4.2942942942942945
5634894,5,B00BJ0RGCU,"Alright alright alright. MUD is about that moment in our lives when our crazy dreams about life come into contact with its even crazier realities. MUD is a mix of Mark Twain and Joseph Conrad and William Faulkner and F. Scott Fitzgerald with a splash of GOONIES, WINTERS BONE and BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD.  As he did in The Paperboy and Killer Joe, McConnaughey tones down the pretty boy image and completely disappears into this role.  It's a standout performance in a film that also features notable performance by Sam Shepard, Reese Witherspoon, Michael Shannon, and a whole host of newcomers.

(In a role that had to have been written for him and him alone) Matthew McConnaughey plays a hard-living sociopathic castaway kept alive by a steady diet of romantic readiness and a rather less steady diet of Beanie Weenie.  Like all American dreamers (and MUD is really a distillation of them all), he is completely out of touch with the world as it actually is and a practiced master of the art of self-deception, and, as is the case with so many American dreamers, it's this eternally renewed self-deception that allows him to remain innocent despite his years of experience. Or at least from a distance he appears to be innocent, but when we get up close his gritty drifter skin and his empty stare seem to tell the part of his tales that he dare not speak aloud.  When two 14 year-old Arkansas boys, Ellis and Neckbone, find him living in a boat stranded in the treetop of an uninhabited isle, one, Neckbone, immediately assumes he's a bum but the other, Ellis (played by one of the best kid actors I've ever seen), senses something noble and even inspiring about his determination to dream big despite the fact that he has nothing in this world but a dirty shirt, a rusty Colt 45, and an old boat stuck up in a tree (that he's claimed as his own). It's through Mud that they get their initiation into life and it's through them that he gets his.

This doesn't sound like your typical coming-of-age story and it isn't. For one, most kids never meet much less befriend a homeless man (and, possibly, a murderer) who lives (for the moment) on a swampy copperhead-infested isle.  But these aren't your normal kids, these are river kids, born and raised on riverboats and moored to a way of life that dates back a good two-hundred or more years. These are not suburban kids. They do not even have computers nor do you get the idea that they've ever seen one. They don't even have tvs. They're not interested in ""that life."" They spend every spare second they have exploring the rivers many estuaries and venturing out  further and further toward ever bigger bodies of water. These kids are adventurers.  They are in search of life (and everything that word suggests).  They are aearching for the same thing their daddies searched for (but maybe didn't find or haven't yet found).  They mind their daddies (or uncles) and they respect them and talk like them and gather what wisdom they have just as their daddies did -- by listening and watching how other people live and absorbing whatever they can from whoever they can, but they are young and idealistic and they are not ready to settle down just yet. There is a wildness in them that they need to explore first, especially in Ellis. And Elllis sees that same wildness in Mud.  As unlikely as the friendship is between Ellis and Mud, it also makes sense: they are each at a crucial point in their own coming-of-age stories and each seems particularly suited to offer the other some much-needed and sought-for insight and perspective.

Part of the appeal of this film is that it features two roughhewn American figures in Ellis and Mud and that they make such a perfect team. One is still genuinely innocent while the other has never really figured out how to make that transition from childlike innocence/idealism to adult experience. What really attracts Ellis to Mud is the way he talks about his lifelong love. The other adults in Ellis's life (mainly his parents) have been worn down by their relationships but Mud is enlivened by love.  And that appeals to Ellis and helps encourage his own bourgeoning romanticism. The difficult thing for both Ellis and Mud is figuring out how best to adjust and align their romantic notions/expectations with actual reality instead of making one the enemy of the other.  Mud has never been much good at learning from experience and adjusting his sites and expectations as he goes but, as romantic as he might be, Ellis is a quick learner and Ellis seems to be the one person Mud is willing to learn from. So MUD works as an interesting twist on The Great Gatsby: Mud can be viewed as the eternally romantic Gatsby kept afloat by dreams and Ellis can be viewed as the much more grounded Nick Carraway. It's not so much that Mud's version of Daisy, Juniper (played by a hot-blooded, booty-shorted Reese Witherspoon), is a bad girl or unworthy of his affection, it's just that she knows that no human being can be asked to accompany a dreamer to their own private dream lair and that's the only reality that Mud has ever known.  He loves her, but she always runs away. She loves him, but he lives in his own private world. They've played this dangerous game of attraction/repulsion their entire lives without understanding it. And Ellis (like Nick Carraway in The Great Gatsby) becomes the messenger who must read each character and translate each to the other. And Ellis proves magnificently capable at this task.

So after some near-lethal run-ins with a den of copperheads, a girl named May Pearl, and a band of pissed-off redneck assassins (seems the guy Mud killed awhile back has a lot of angry friends) everyone comes of age in a satisfying way.  Great film.  McConnaughey is on a streak. Also fun to see Sam Shepard in this story since this is exactly the kind of tale (doomed lovers ensnared by one another) he has been telling his entire life. Witherspoon is perfect as well. But the real break out star is the child actor, Tye Sheridan (Ellis). A must-see.",1369612800,8,6060,4.6679174484052535
