2750401,5,B000MV9OBS,"Criminals deserve to be in prison forever is the point of this well done older film.

It's in black and white and has a classic sense to it but the message of the film is just as valuable today as it was when the movie was made.

It tells the story of a criminal who gets out of jail early on parole and then kills people.

It's just like real life and has a valuable message about being tough on crime.",1146873600,3,403,3.950617283950617
2750402,5,B000MV9OBS,"""I was full of admiration for Alfred Zeisler's brilliant handling of `Parole, Inc.' tricky theme. Apart from being an all-time entertainer, it has a message that our prison system would do well to take notice of. Michael O'Shea does his role to perfection. Anyone who claims that `oldies' are pass? needs to see this brilliant piece of classic film-making...""",1146528000,,359,5.101694915254237
8172913,5,B000MV9OBS,"I watched on Amazon Prime and was happy with it, considering it is a 'B' movie type detective noir style. Black and white, bland viewing it, and by that I mean the actors and actresses don't endear themselves to viewers much but the story and quality was better than I expected.
To be truthful, I didn't expect to watch the movie all the way through, but the story moved along at a steady rate and I actually giggled late in the movie when faced with possible tear gas, one bad guy says ""my sinus's aren't good"" and another bad guy punches him in the nose and says ""now, maybe that will fix em"" or something like that.
After watching 'Amazing Mr. X', I looked up other Turhan Bey movies and I'm glad I found this one. Actually, Evelyn Ankers was also interesting and enjoyable to watch in this movie as the criminal role of 'JoJo', too.
I was planning to give this movie a four star out of five rating, but now that I write this stuff, I'm thinking it was a enjoyable enough 'B' movie to get five stars. There was probably a lot of work put into this movie so I don't mind giving five stars when deciding between four and five.",1490659200,,1127,4.271028037383178

8172915,3,B000MV9OBS,"OK way to pass about an hour and a quarter. Relatively interesting story about corruption in the parole process. Michael O'Shea (real-life husband of Virginia Mayo, the lucky stiff) actually does well in the lead.",1473984000,,213,5.114285714285714
8172916,2,B000MV9OBS,"Filmed by a Poverty Row studio with a largely unknown cast, augmented by former Universal stalwarts Evelyn Ankers and Turhan Bey, PAROLE INC., is a good example of a so-called ""problem picture"" designed to draw attention to one of the iniquities blighting late Forties American society.

In this case it is the corrupt parole system whereby habitual criminals are let out of jail on the promise of reform and promptly resume their nefarious habits. This is chiefly due to a corrupt system headed by lawyer Barney Rodescu (Turhan Bey), who bribes two of the five-person Parole Board to vote in the prisoners' favor while trusting in the Board's ability to return positive verdicts.

Intrepid federal agent Hendricks (Michael O'Shea) volunteers to expose this racket by posing as a master criminal, infiltrating the racket at its lowest level and discovering how it works. He frequents The Pastime Club, a seedy joint run by Barney's fiance Jojo (Ankers), and peopled by a clutch of hoodlums all in baggy suits and snap-brimmed hats. The rest of the story is predictable.

For an action thriller PAROLE INC. is remarkably static with too much time devoted to lengthy voice-overs from Hendricks as he tells what happened to a tape recorder from his hospital bed. The two nominal stars do what they can with the material: Bey looks immaculate in his tailored suits, but shows a tendency towards sadism, even though he assaults no one. He has a good line in dialogue delivery, describing one of his unfortunate minions as ""a jackass,"" and vowing to get rid of any double-dealers daring to cross him.

On the whole, however, Alfred Zeisler's B-Movie is rather too moral for its own good, even though it dramatizes a scenario common to late Forties movies, suggesting that corruption is so rife in American institutions that no one knows how to separate friends from enemies.",1469836800,,1868,4.958466453674121
8172917,2,B000MV9OBS,"Genre: Crime-stopper of the 1940's
Stars: 2.5

Pros:
-The Acting wasn't horrible
-Appropriate for most audiences

Cons:
-The main actor is just difficult to listen to
-Storyline is ok, but the execution of it is not very interesting nor original
-You already know the outcome in the beginning so there is no real tension in the film

Summary, not the best.  I thought that this movie was a B-movie, but given the year and I could be wrong.  Leave this be until you have nothing else to watch (I hope that never happens",1462233600,,518,4.526881720430108

8172922,2,B000MV9OBS,"Had 'Parole, Inc.' been made in 1934, it might have been noteworthy within its genre, not because of its artistic sensibilities, acting or writing, but because of its hardline, pro-law-and-order social sentiment.  As it stands, however, being a product of the late '40s, well after the country had tired of Hollywood's alternately romanticizing and pitying the criminal class, and with the Breen Office at full sway, what we're stuck with is another low-budget procedural-style crime drama that otherwise watches like it was made in 1934.  Now the story itself-- in which a federal agent goes undercover to infiltrate a small-time parole-board-tampering syndicate-- is interesting enough, and unfolds efficiently under German-film producer Alfred Zeisler's direction (its running time is 71 mins., not 90 as Amazon states).  But the wooden characters, hokey dialogue and uninspired camerawork relegate PI to poverty-row-programmer limbo, even by 1948 standards.  2 stars.

Note: The public-domain version I viewed (fair-to-good quality overall) is from one of Mill Creek's multi-disc sets, so I can't comment on Alpha's or Synergy's print.",1338249600,7,1139,5.637426900584796
