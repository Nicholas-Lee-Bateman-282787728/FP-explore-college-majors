8239861,1,B00112BIVQ,"I had purchased the Sinister Cinema version of this film a couple of years ago and was not particularly impressed with the picture quality. There is very considerable digital artifacting, like a bad JPEG file, and the night scenes are pale and flat. My impression was that the film was too long for one single-layer disk and that it must have been overcompressed, thus the mediocre image quality.

Because I was dissatisfied with the quality of the Sinister product I purchased the official Lenfilm DVD from a website that specializes in Russian DVDs. It appears identical to the DVD on this page: It comes in a giant jewel case rather than a standard DVD case, but that's just glitter. If I thought the SC DVD's image was inadequate, this is worse. The image is very soft (SC's is not). The night scenes, rather than being pale, are so black that often nothing at all is visible (whereas, in the SC DVD, the image is perfectly clear, if not beautiful). In fact, the blacks on the Lenfilm DVD are so deep that they cannot be opened up by turning up the brightness; there is no information in 100% black. And, in places there are the fine horizontal lines that one sometimes sees in transfers from older videotape; these are not present in the Sinister product.

So, what are we to make of this? It's apparent that Greg Luce at Sinister Cinema did not use this DVD as his source; there is no way he could have gotten the image he did from this awful official release. Perhaps the SC version is from an earlier videotape release; there is an occasional sign of minor tape wear in the Sinister image. The Lenfilm DVD represents a 2007 remaster which is touted on the front, but it's pathetic. (It also is on a single disk, so my theory about compression being responsible for the quality of the SC image is not proved.)

The image on the Lenfilm release is dreadful, and the illustration shown above matches that on my Lenfilm DVD exactly.

The Sinister Cinema copy may not be beautiful, but it's much better than the official release. If anyone knows of a better version, I invite them to inform Kress del Rey at Hotmail.",1282089600,,2119,4.553805774278215
