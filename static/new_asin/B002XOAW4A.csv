8383772,3,B002XOAW4A,"This review is for your average person.  If you adore Rainbeau Mars you will hate this review, but I'm being really honest.  I truly like all of Rainbeau Mars dvds except this one.  Ra'yoka is similar to a Cameron Shayne dvd, without any detailed explanations of how to perform the movements.  I find it strange that there are not many explanations and alignment cues, considering she is so talkative.  The program is martial arts style moves mixed with yoga poses that we already know.  It would earn 5 stars if it had a tutorial section.  I am very disappointed.  I gave it 3 stars because I may have been impressed by it, had I not seen Shayne's dvds first.  The average viewer might feel the same.  Sorry Rainbeau, but I would not recommend this to a friend.  Rainbeau should stick to what she knows best; and I feel bad to say it is not this combination of movements.  It appears that many of the non-yoga movements are new to her :(",1301270400,5,938,4.421052631578948
8383773,1,B002XOAW4A,"I'm a huge fan of Rainbeau, but this DVD is a joke.  There is really nothing different from this video as compared to her others.  I'm a yoga and pilates instructor, I am severely unimpressed w/ this DVD.",1267574400,6,204,4.342105263157895
8383774,5,B002XOAW4A,"I have to preface this by expressing that I absolutely adore Rainbeau and all she has done for the world of yoga. In my own personal world it was her first set of dvd's which brought yoga into my life. That was 7 years ago. Since then I have found that even those I explore the teachings of others from time to time I ALWAYS come back to Rainbeau and her ever evolving practice and style.

This DVD is no exception. Filled from start to finish with a challenging but yet oddly peaceful flow of vinyasa. I say oddly because most times I find that challenging work outs always result in more frustration or just challenge than a balance of the two aforementioned qualities of this video.

This is most certainly not a beginners level video. I am pretty experienced and I still have to modify and find myself often shaking and quivering through the set.
What I appreciate most and what I believe imparts the unbelievable peaceful energy to the practice is Rainbeaus ability to push you physically whilst relating it to the breath and heart of yoga. She is quick to note that we are not allowed to hurt ourselves and to back off if it feels uncomfortable. She teaches us to respect our bodies and minds whilst challenging ourselves into more rigorous movements designed to open us up fully.

Personally I find that Rainbeau embodies the true spirit of a yogi. Through her own site and also through her various facebook pages Rainbeau always put forth effort to respond to those who reach out to her. I personally have been blessed to have her answer many of my questions and in a very expeditious manner. I find this to be a quality not many other teachers (that I have thus far experienced) have as she does.

I would have to add the following to help guide those viewing this:

1) This is NOT beginners level work out. Whilst she always encourages you to modify even the movements in modified form require a great deal of strength and stamina....

2) Which is why a good foundation of fitness is a requirement, in my opinion, for this video.

3) This is not your typical yoga routine. This is a blend of martial arts inspired movements coupled with yoga. This provides you with both the cardio found in martial arts and the peace and alignment found through yoga.

4) There are a few (very few) parts of this video that are breath centered and with little to no instruction. I would suggest watching this flow a few times and being extremely patient with yourself the first few times you go through it until you have it memorized.

5) You must be prepared to sweat and challenge yourself! There are many difficult balancing moves as well as some sustained and strength movements that I personally find myself dripping with sweat from. Bring a towel.

Most of all I would say to take this video with an open mind and prepare yourself for a wonderful experience that allows visible results as well as those you feel come alive internally!

Bless!",1266796800,13,2942,4.553030303030303
8383775,4,B002XOAW4A,"I tried the Rayoka Level Orange 60 minute work out of Rainbeau Mars' on youtube (in 9-minute segments), and I really loved it, so ordered this DVD.
I admit I was a bit disappointed, since there wasn't a lot of new stuff from the youtube version, and I was kind of hoping it would be a series of work outs you could choose from... in other words, an entire practice dedicated to level red all the way through to level purple, focusing solely on those 7 areas of the body. I love that principle... but if that's what you are looking for, this isn't the DVD for you. I am sure that would have cost a little more than this one, but I would gladly pay for it!
The work out is good - it is very challenging. I do not recommend this for beginners. I think if you've done yoga before, or dance, then you will pick this up easily. However, if you've never even done a basic sun salute before, then this is going to be confusing and disappointing for you.
I think her instruction is a bit too wordy. I understand she's trying to insert her little catch-phrases, to brand herself (""what is in the way, is the way"", etc) but when you're trying to follow instruction without constantly looking up at the TV to see what she's doing, the words kind of get in the way of trying to figure out what you are meant to do!
I am sure that with many more practices, I will know what's coming next, and it won't be a problem... but in getting to know the ""routine"", it's quite fast paced and complex to understand. Also, I find the music a bit too intense. I guess maybe it matches the workout, but I was a bit bummed cuz the music is always a part of what I really love about good yoga videos.
Also, there is one portion in the DVD where she doesn't instruct at all! She is moving along through several postures and I don't hear anything! This is very weird, and maybe it's just my copy. Not sure.
If you love yoga, and you love Rainbeau Mars, you should get this DVD. If you want to whip your body into shape, and are already quite athletic, this is perfect for you. I will use this DVD regularly, and I am sure I will see/feel results.
Another DVD that I really LOVE is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Shakti/dp/1591791847/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga Shakti</a>, by Shiva Rea. This is a really cool interactive DVD, where you can choose which asanas you want to include in your practice, there are loads to choose from. It's all filmed in India, absolutely gorgeous setting! And the music is wonderful.",1262131200,7,2533,4.484848484848484
8383776,5,B002XOAW4A,"I bought the ra'yoKa DVD from Rainbeau at Bhakti Fest, and I am so glad that I did!  The workout is challenging with great instruction on breath and the yoga flow poses from Rainbeau.  This is the kind of yoga DVD which doesn't get boring, rather it gets better and better as you gain a deeper understanding of the integration of body and mind...Rainbeau style...using ra'yoKa.  It's a fun workout that I look forward to...perfect warmup, flow, twists, strength, and relaxation!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ra-yoKa/dp/B002XOAW4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ra'yoKa</a>",1261180800,,614,6.285714285714286
8383777,4,B002XOAW4A,"This ra'yoKa DVD is amazing. It gives the body an amazing workout while still providing the clarity and mental benefits of traditional yoga. The poses are compiled in a way which works the core, increases flexibility and strength. Aside from the Zen Mama DVD, I have Rainbeau's entire collection of yoga DVD's and this one is definitely her best!! I attempt to do it everyday and I am seeing the results. It's a nice workout to improve overall tone, wake up the body and the bonus workout is definitely something to aspire to. One day!",1260489600,,535,4.6421052631578945
8383778,5,B002XOAW4A,I am a vinyasa junkie and love rainbeau mars' other dvds.  This is a fantastic workout and a nice change adding in martial arts moves with yoga postures.  It really works the core and has quite a challenging balance sequence.  And the bonus advance sequence gives me something to work towards.  I highly recommend this dvd!,1260316800,,323,4.714285714285714
8383779,5,B002XOAW4A,"My daughter and I started practicing with the Ra'Yoka DVD just as soon as I brought it home.  For me, it's challenging but in a good way.  The movements aren't overly difficult but they really give us a workout.  We absolutely love it!  It's definitely our new favorite.  I know my body will be happier because of it!  I highly recommend it - Rainbeau Mars is an exceptional teacher and is an incredibly gifted athlete.",1260316800,,419,4.52
8383780,3,B002XOAW4A,"I am a HUGE Rainbeau fan, she introduced me to yoga and was soooo excited to get this new yoga fusion. It came quickly after ordering it and I popped it right into the DVD player, and selected beginner, thinking I could ace it. I have been practicing yoga for about two years now and consider myself above beginner maybe intermediate... boy, was I wrong! I need more practice!
I found the Ra'Yoka to be very challenging and difficult.  I am quite flexible, which helped, but am shown now that I need to work on my strength and balance. I found the movement poses (like the windmill arms spins/leg extensions) very challenging and also noticed that when she would say, for example, to bring up your left foot, she was actually moving her right.  The left foot was tucked under me in position, making it very confusing to follow. Because of this, I was having to re-adjust and lost concentration. I also thought that because I am trying so hard to focus and keep up, I am missing some steps as her vocal directions were fast.  I wasn't even into the down dog position before I noticed that she was already starting to stand up!
Lastly... I just don't get the color levels! I am a Reiki Master so I know what she is speaking of, but I must be the only one that doesnt have any 'level' options on the DVD... or am I just missing something?!
 The first fifteen minutes is about all I could handle for now until I seriously gain some muscle and balance abilities. The idea is great and spot on.  The delivery was a little tough for me though.  I have to admit that I am a little bummed  :(",1260230400,6,1583,4.327702702702703
