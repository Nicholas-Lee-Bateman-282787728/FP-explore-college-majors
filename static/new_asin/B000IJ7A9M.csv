2657964,5,B000IJ7A9M,"This was my introduction to the world of Darkstone Entertainment and boy was it one heck of an intro. To try to explain what Skeleton Key is pretty well impossible so I won't try. The basics are a pair of bumbling reporters with an equally bumbling Hatian cab driver (and Hatian Husky named Codo) enter the mythical town of Nilbog and all Hell breaks lose. This is what genre films should be, just fun no deep meanings of trying to stop Global Warming just fun. Having bought this film I have gone out and purchased everything Darkstone has released. This one will have you laughing and forgetting your troubles for about 90 minutes.",1243296000,4,633,4.610619469026549

2657984,5,B000IJ7A9M,"While you will need to take breaks, as an indy it is awesome. I tend to try at least a few times a month to watch what I term ""gradutate film studies films"" and if that is what you are looking for...here it is. Better film angles and asides then ""Night of the Living Dead"". Yes, there are so many plot changes that perhaps that is why I say watch in segments. The acting..superb. The comedy...choice. The total endeavor...fantistico! I came on this site to buy the DVD. Alas, said is not sold. Good job guys and girls...keep them coming.",1410912000,,537,4.38
2657985,1,B000IJ7A9M,"Why do people feel the need to make this kind of movie? They must be either really bored or really retarded. After watching about 10 minutes of this piece of kukka, I vote on the latter. No storyline. No acting abilities shown. Just stupid people running around be stupid. Well, I guess that was unfair. Maybe they aren't stupid. They thought of this film and made it. They must be way beyond stupid. Hope you don't make a mistake and pay to watch this one. I wouldn't watch it if they paid me.",1409184000,2,494,4.32258064516129
2657986,1,B000IJ7A9M,Please do not waste your time with this one. Amazon seriously has no shame in selecting videos. Stupid. Boring. Unintelligent trash.,1398902400,,132,5.333333333333333
2657987,1,B000IJ7A9M,"WT?. Somebody please kill me now? Just make it quick, this is much like watching Sesame Street while on CRACK COCAIN. and an LSD trip where ya miight see Big Bird as a vampiric Big Foot, Godzilla creature, your wildest drug induced hellucinations could not be as bad as this atrocious horrific garbage. I like B and low budget movies but this isn't one in fact it comes under the category of a WT? a rarely used and lowest rating muwhahaha, wish they did have that rating for real lol The Hatian dude is cool though. For the love of god skip this torture, got a headache now got to go take something for it",1385251200,2,606,4.278260869565218
2657988,4,B000IJ7A9M,"This was an interesting twist to a good idea.  I liked the premise, the acting and the plot.  Well done.",1376438400,,104,4.15
2657989,1,B000IJ7A9M,"I rented this based on the one 5star review it had, and I would truly love to know his dealer because this was atrocious... I like horrible movies but GD this was bad I suffered through an hour hoping Timothy's review was accurate but Jesus, DO NOT RENT THIS!!!!!!!!!",1367193600,5,267,4.469387755102041

8145713,4,B000IJ7A9M,"Low budget horror comedy at it's best. People who don't like this movie just don't ""get it""",1515801600,,91,4.411764705882353
8145714,5,B000IJ7A9M,"Taste is subjective. Taste about movies, double that. Taste about horror movies, triple and quadruple that. If you're a mainstream-movie fan, stay (the hell) away from John Johnson's Skeleton Key. If you're a mainstream-horror-movie fan, stay (the hell) away from John Johnson's Skeleton Key. If you think Michael Bay is the greatest filmmaker who ever lived, make yourself a Clorox smoothie, then stay (the hell) away from John Johnson's Skeleton Key. Not every movie is for everybody, and some films know EXACTLY who they're for. Skeleton Key is certainly one of the latter.

This is a fun movie. It's not the least bit pretentious. It's not the work of experienced and jaded filmmakers. It's not meant to be the launch-point for a vast cinematic universe full of grim-dark heroes, CG explosions, and a dozen (or more) Funko Pop figures. It's nothing more or less than what it is, a fun, fast-moving horror flick that wears its heart (and its numerous genre influences) on its proverbial sleeve. You'll see a great ensemble of actors, including John Johnson himself, and horror stalwarts like Conrad Brooks (R.I.P.) and Debbie Rochon (F.T.W.), and you'll definitely roll your eyes a time or three, because not all the jokes land where they're supposed to. I mean, head on over to the film's IMDb entry and look at the cast/character list. There's a ""King of Zombies"" and a ""Leprechaun Stowaway,"" for God's sake. Is this a highfalutin flick? Nope. It is not. It's...Skeleton KEEEEY!",1515628800,,1483,5.004048582995951
8145715,5,B000IJ7A9M,"Really, some people take themselves waaaaaaaaay to seriously. Relax, its just a movie....why get so angry? Its a indie low budget movie, so if you only like high production Hollywood type movies then don't watch it. It's also Comedy/Horror...that a silly and immature genre of movie anyway.....so what did you expect? Anyway....I for one loved this movie, I watched it twice actually. Thought it was funny and silly and entertaining. You can tell it was made by people who just love movies. But if you have a stick permanently inserted in your ass, don't watch it, cause it won't be your cup of tea.",1507334400,,599,4.769230769230769
8145716,1,B000IJ7A9M,"Shame on the people who produced this POS and shame on Amazon for putting it up. I'm starting to think that Amazon has, as one of its first criteria to adding a movie, is that it must have been rejected by all the other streaming services in the world.",1493251200,,252,4.163265306122449
8145717,5,B000IJ7A9M,"If a second of these were made with an entirely new cast, I honestly wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Completely forgettable.",1485993600,,133,4.826086956521739

I made it to the 10 minute mark. Beat that, masochists !!!",1462838400,,136,4.230769230769231
8145721,1,B000IJ7A9M,I made it through ten minutes. I think this film wins the prize for the worst film EVER produced. I think it's supposed to be a comedy? It's not funny. AT ALL. It's stupid. It's so stupid it makes me nauseous.,1447459200,3,209,4.121951219512195
