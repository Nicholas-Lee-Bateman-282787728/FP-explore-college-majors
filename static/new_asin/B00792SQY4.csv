5063871,3,B00792SQY4,Not a comprehensive but poignant view of a superstar's life. Full songs should have been included. A star that no  longer shines.,1385769600,,129,4.863636363636363
5063872,1,B00792SQY4,I love Whitney but this is tabloid trash. That's all I can say about it. Don't waste your time on this documentary.,1375401600,,115,4.2727272727272725
5063873,4,B00792SQY4,"This movie is put together well. It really is just a documentary that put together all the stories of her carried in the media plus interviews. Ignore the two fanboys who poorly rated it. I suppose cause this show talks about the REAL Whitney, not the Whitney everybody demanded, which drove her to drugs.

A sad story of one of the best singers all time. Covers her rise to fame and downfall. Shows a sad side to fame and how difficult it is to pretend to be someone your not. It pulls no punches with the truth. Even though raised in middle class Whitney has famous relatives and way too much expected of her from birth. As a young girl, prior to fame, she began a long hard road of drug usage that ultimately ended her life too young.

I recommend this movie to anyone who wishes to see all the media stories all in one place, including news coverage.",1372982400,5,854,4.33125
5063874,5,B00792SQY4,The video was great and so was the quality. I learned things I never knew about Whitney. I will watch it again.,1367193600,2,111,4.090909090909091
5063875,1,B00792SQY4,"Just absolutely terrible.  Do yourself a favor, don't purchase.  Not anything like I'd thought it be.  I got suckered!  This DVD should recieve a zero star.",1338595200,9,156,4.884615384615385
5063876,1,B00792SQY4,"If you're a frequent viewer of Whitney-fan.com's message board, you'll likely recognize my username as the co-moderator of the forum.

When this DVD was ORIGINALLY planned, its description touted unreleased footage and rare interviews with Whitney.  When I got it, it was anything but.  The DVD cover art was XEROXED and the DVD itself was a regular DVD-R with a HQ printer label on it.  Moreover, they used stock Google images photos of Whitney (the whole 4 they used).  Otherwise, there were a bunch of random ""fans"" (I use the term lightly) giving their take on Whitney Houston and their favorite songs of hers--outside, on their couches, behind their computers, on campus.  It looks as if it was recorded on a HQ cell phone camera or a handheld camera.  NOTHING about this is professional.  Heck, they showed NO footage of Whitney, barely showed pics, BARELY heard her music.

LEARN your Whitney Houston history if you're gonna try to release something like this.  Whitney-fan.com and ClassicWhitney.com would be places to start.

I've had the DVD one day and it's going BACK for a full refund.

If this is the way you show your love to Whitney, I'd damn sure hate to see how you show your hate to her!  I wish I could give this 0 out of 5 stars.",1337731200,22,1250,4.65296803652968

I'd rather hear the stories from friends or other musicians, not from people who made a living being a part of the paparazzi machine that drives a lot of artists to drugs.

5063913,5,B00792SQY4,"This documentary helped me renew my respect for Whitney Houston, by helping me understand her addiction. Bless her for being of such service to humanity, using her gift to bring emotional releases for many that needed it while listening to her music.  Perhaps she helped others overcome their own addictions (by having her music to listen and turn to) to ease emotional pain.  As a retired professional singer myself, I know the dangers of the entertainment field.  Although I was able to gain ""my high"" through simply singing and playing musical instruments, others are not that fortunate.  Incredible amounts of fame obviously took its toll on her.",1431993600,,650,5.046728971962617

I know that how she lived her life - all the way to the end - I know for sure that that was the path she, her highest self - her soul had chosen to walk. She had lessons she needed to learn - and I hope she learned them - But she also had a purpose. I feel that she had a purpose to deliver a message from God and spirit. And how she would deliver that message here on earth was going to be through her voice. Listening to Whitney Houston calls all of me to look at my deeper self - to my divine self - my higher self - to my God given soul self. Her voice pulls people into their own hearts - into their own SOUL.  She came to fulfill a purpose. And I feel she did.",1424908800,,948,3.6699507389162562
