It's something that you can do in your own home on your own time.  It gave me a great overall body workout, and really helped me relax my mind and body.  The instructor, Anastasia, will guide you through many helpful workouts, breathing techniques, more to help you tone your body and ease your mind.  My wife and I do this workout together, and we both love it. I definitely do not regret this purchase and would recommend it to anyone.",1325980800,2,599,4.3125
