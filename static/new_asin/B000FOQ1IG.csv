2580199,5,B000FOQ1IG,"While I lived in Hollywood, Fl. I met all those who played in this DVD

I know the homes and other locations where it was filmed. as well I knew a lot of people who dressed in Indian attire and gathered for filming when no one was saying anything to be on film. They got paid enough to have various things doen for them. Children who played in the film I knew all those who played the d. of the leading man. as well Carrillo is just a very nice man when you know him and see him most every day. People dodged the couple who played the parents of Maria Isabel. all stayed dressed in filming wear at all times. Many of this DVD and others I know were filmed in Hollywood during 1996(year I met Fernando Carrillo) up to middle of 2004=Fernando and Abel Rodriguez, jr. and Sr. and three other men, including Marcelo B. who played in Maria Isabel as business partner, came to Indigo Point Brandon, Fl. where I moved April 30, 2004, and looked at the possibility of filming something in the setting which has 5 lakes with fountains, a tennis court, swimming pool and has a beautiful landscape.

  So I give them all a great big 10 star, for all worked hard and kept busy as many were also Jehovoah Witnesses and Sat's gave the day to recruit 'new believers' but in seeing homes, found new places to have filming and therefore gain funds for the home renter or owner. All went door to door in the clothes they filmed the series in.

(the actress who played the aunt of Carrillo ie leading man of Maria Isabel, almost had a heart attach and looked like she had a mild stroke when the 9/11 happened. She had worked for one of those young men. He and his mother owned a dress shop, where the actress got clothes, shoes, bags, jewerly on loan for the filming of various of those soap operas. but in the Maria Isabel filming was when the 9/11 took place. IT hit us all hard in Hollywood, and many of these actors and actresses knew many of those who took over all those planes. was a sad rememberance and so very hard for all to even accept that the Men whose photos we had to see on TV and in papers, were the actual ones we had known for so long.",1173830400,,2136,4.212713936430318
2580200,3,B000FOQ1IG,"Apparently the people who made this DVD couldn't get the rights to the music so they put in generic music.  One of the thing I was looking forward to was the song ""Si tu supieras"" but it's not there.  Otherwise it's a fun Telenovela.",1173657600,3,233,4.2727272727272725
2580201,5,B000FOQ1IG,Super Novela. 2 Doble sided DVDs. Total of about 10 hours. You got to see the quality of this series. But it is not from 1966 as suggested by amazon but rather 2006(?).,1167350400,6,168,4.121212121212121
2580202,5,B000FOQ1IG,"This is one of my all time favorite Telenovela.  Adela Noriega portrays Maria Isabel and does an excellent job.  This was the first novela that ever made me cry.  It is heartwarming, fun, passionate, and the editing for the DVD is very good.  Of course there are parts that have been edited out, but nothing real major.  You are able to follow the story very well.  Fernando Carillo is also a dream.  I can watch him all day!

There are 2 double sided DVDs in total.  It includes English subtitles, which is great!  2 of my friends from college were hooked with me when it first aired on TV.  They did not know any Spanish, so I would always have to translate.  I am getting each one their own copy as a surprise.  I wanted to wait for Christmas, but I can't wait that long.

If you collect Novelas on DVD, this is a must in your collection, and if you like Novelas, but have never bought one on DVD, this is your chance to get a great one!",1156291200,31,940,4.17877094972067

2580240,5,B000FOQ1IG,"I bought this dvd for a gift, but I heard is a good dvd.  Always recommend it.
My sister the owner enjoyed very much from a soap opera she missed in tv.",1356480000,,152,3.75
2580241,4,B000FOQ1IG,"I have a lot of telenovelas on DVD. I have just come to accept that they will be HIGHLY edited. Sometimes they do a good job and this is one of them. No, they don't use the original music, but at least the weird midi music they do use does not drown out the dialogue. I am impressed with this DVD. Some of them (Marimar, Maria Mercedes and Maria la del Barrio) are really, really awful.

PS: Dear Televisa I am willing to pay for an entire telenovela. I wish you would issue them on DVD without editing.",1347753600,,503,4.13265306122449
2580242,4,B000FOQ1IG,"This was good.  I recommend people buying this.  The foundation of the story was set up really good, so there was no confusion at all as to what was going on.  It was romantic and all the actors did a good job and were really likable.",1344556800,,234,4.043478260869565
2580263,5,B000FOQ1IG,"I love this movie. The writer touched on all side of this movie for the character of Maria Isabel. The actress played the part of Isabel was so real heart felt. The spiritual side was awesome. She the actress played very well of a woman who loves so deep and then to be protrade by her husband. I felt the pain she was going through. It was so real. This day drama is in my collection with Gone with the wind. I can and have watch this dvd at least three times. I purchased it two days ago. 04-29-2012 What a movie . This is by far my favorit. Maria Isabel!
It speaks for all women and there hurt. The main message was FORGIVENESS, when Your HEART HURT SO BAD!",1335830400,,660,4.084615384615384
2580264,2,B000FOQ1IG,"I ordered this dvd because it is one my sister and I saw when we were younger and that is now being shown on an alternative tv station. We were so excited to see it but couldn't stand the wait between episodes, so I ordered this so we could watch it together but was really disapointed. This is basically the cliff notes version, a lot of scenes have been cut that the story is rushed and jumbled. It really takes away from the original passion and beauty of this Novela. I never really write reviews for the things I order but I was disapointed. I only rated 2 stars because the company was fast in shipping and delivery and it got her before the estimated date. So if you're ordering this dvd because you saw it on tv, my advice would be don't order it.",1335052800,,755,4.213793103448276
2580265,3,B000FOQ1IG,Esta novela es muy buena . Pero no me gusto que este dvd no tiene la cacion Principal de la novela si tu supieras de alejandro fernandez. Y tambien le quitaron muchas esenas. En el dvd la novela no es tan larga como cuando la presentavan por la televicion,1333670400,2,255,4.224489795918367
2580266,3,B000FOQ1IG,"Esta Telenovela la Compre por el Elenco que tiene y porque la encontre en Oferta.
Me Gusto mucho, contiene lo mas importante de la Novela.
No tiene el Tema Principal, de Alejandro Fernandez, Si Tu Supieras, tiene una Musica Instrumental.
Faltan muchas Escenas, pero dentro de todo vale la pena.",1308096000,,294,4.9
2580267,2,B000FOQ1IG,"I live in Australia so it is difficult to find these sort of products here. I was happy to find Maria Isabel, however when I played it here didn't work in my dvd or PS3 since it is region 1 and here is region 4 (not even in the multiregion dvd) so I had to watch it in the computer which allows a limited number of region changes. That was disappointing. Obviously this product is for US residents only, that should be very clear before buying.
The story was very edited, sometimes characters appeared without knowing how they met or what the relationship was. Also some important parts were missing. It was entertaining though.",1268524800,,628,4.517543859649122
2580268,4,B000FOQ1IG,"I saw this soap when it first came out on TV.  This version of it is lacking of some important things.  There were questions that I had that were not answer., Overall is very similar to original version but with some questions without answer.",1252800000,,242,4.4772727272727275
2580269,5,B000FOQ1IG,Adela Noriega gave the performance of a lifetime enhanced by a storyline that kept your interest to the end. This is the type of novela that should go on forever......,1231891200,,167,4.6
2580270,5,B000FOQ1IG,"What can you say about the different classes of people from mexico.
Here you see the abuse the lower class is subject to and being ridiculed because of their heritage. Love lust and passion rule this film not to mention greed wealth and power. Although this novela is missing parts when they put it together it's as complete as when they transmitted on the television. My hands out to the kids their performance was excellant. The main characters proved that love conquers all obstacles. Those that were greedy got their just punishment throughout the novela. Adela Noriega's acting was as genuine as the culture of the indians way of life in that town. Fernando Carrilo's acting was very reflective of the higher class who still can be rich and very understanding and down to earth to their constituates. Thumbs up to the writer and producers of this excellant novela.",1218499200,2,869,4.8389261744966445
2580271,5,B000FOQ1IG,"Love it!  I am a Spanish teacher and my Spanish III and IV kids are totally hooked on this telenovela.  We just wish there was a second season...it will be hard to find another that is quite as campy and fun to watch.

The first few episodes have a few uncomfortable scenes where men keep trying to accost Maria Isabel, but there are only a few of these and once they get past this the fun really begins.",1201046400,2,404,4.153846153846154
2580272,5,B000FOQ1IG,"I really loved this one. It has all the essentials of a really good telenovela-drama,suspense,murder,love,conspiracy.  This is one of the best I have seen, and the English subtitles are excellent. I caught maybe 2 mistakes that were very very minor.  I would definately recommend this one to anyone with an interest in telenovelas or foreign TV Drama or Soap Operas however you want to word it.  Never a dull moment in this one.  Looking forward to more telenovelas like this one!",1183852800,,480,4.888888888888889

8125084,4,B000FOQ1IG,"Maria Isabel (573 minutes)

This is all about equality, racism, bullying, pollution, and then plain old ordinary sex. It has a terrific script and boasts a roll call for future stars who will be in the limelight later (Jorge Salinas La Que no Podia Amar, Yadhira Carrillo La Otra, Valentino Lans Las tontas no van al Cielo).

We see our main characters as youngsters, then as adults. After their children are born, we see them age appropriately as their offspring become toddlers, then tweens, next as spoiled late teens and arrogant young adults.

Our young heroine, Maria Isabel (Adela Noriega) a proud Indian, was close friends with wealthy Rosaura from childhood. Poor little rich girl Rosaura was desperately unhappy and became pregnant by a fellow soon murdered by her controlling father. The two young women run off to the city where Rosaura has her baby girl, then dies, leaving the baby in the sole care of Maria Isabel, who becomes a housemaid in Ricardo Mendiola's (Fernando Carrillo) home.

The principal characters age appropriately, with Ricardo not recognizing Maria Isabel''s love for him until late on the second side of the first disc. Our sweet heroine's favorite expletive is Holy Cow! She is often described by prejudiced characters as That Stupid Indian, but she quickly learns how to read and write when her daughter goes to school. We can hardly wait for each of their daughters, both of whom have become selfish and prejudiced, to grow up and learn some important life lessons.

Soon after our lovers finally marry, temptation enters in the person of an old flame who quickly seduces Ricardo, to his everlasting shame. Our Stupid Indian is proud and independent, so she does NOT suffer her husband's infidelity lightly. By the time pollution in the river near her old home town finally takes its toll, she has left him forever.

This is a telenovela, so despite the odds, look for a happy ending.",1431648000,,1921,4.895384615384615
