191388,5,1573411205,"I was eight months pregnant and couldn't sleep.  At 2am I turned on the TV and saw this video.  I was shocked and appalled and deeply disturbed but I was compelled to continue watching.  I was moved to tears and disgusted by the horrific awful reality of the real life abortion that showed a fully developed fetus being pulled apart limb by limb and placed on an adjacent table to make sure all body parts were accounted for.  Gruesome, real, disturbing.
  Dr. Bernard Nathanson, an ex-abortion provider and founder of NARAL turned pro-life, accepts personal responsibility for the murder of thousands of unborn babies.  His speech is unemotinal and focused as he explains abortion procedures and techniques from a medical point of view.
  Includes insightful and honest interviews of women who have had abortions describing their various medical problems since and how they were mislead and medically uninformed of possible risks prior to their decision to abort.  It made me want to run down to the nearest abortion clinic to tell women what they should know about the grim realities of abortion.
  If you want to know what abortion really is, see this video before you take a stance on the issue.  Eclipse of reason presents the facts and realities of abortion as it shows a baby being killed and dismembered.
  Pro-choice people, prepare to change your mind.",1055289600,37,1362,4.912280701754386
7798076,5,1573411205,Very informative information about abortion I bought the Silent Scream as well,1512259200,,78,5.583333333333333
7798077,1,1573411205,"An older video.  It shows an abortion with the help of an instrument (here called a fetoscope) with reasonable quality given that it's an in utero image.  The issue I have is that the host/narrator  of the video uses emotionally charged words seemingly in order to generate empathy and/or disgust.  It's reasonably effective, if completely unbalanced.  This is definitely a pro life video so if you are looking for more of a ""just the facts"" type of video in order to make an impartial decision please look elsewhere, but if you are pro life and want something to reinforce your views, this may be for you.  I'd on the other hand your are a pro choicer, you might at least get a glimpse of your opponent.  In the end this feels like propaganda more than anything else, but it's compelling propaganda.",1453075200,,800,4.631205673758865
7798078,5,1573411205,"This is definitely a DVD everyone should see...it really puts things into perspective.  There are a few parts that are graphic in this DVD, but it affirmed how precious life is...  Soooo glad we purchased it!!!!!!!!",1393891200,,215,4.944444444444445
7798079,4,1573411205,"This video, probably more than any other, made me pro-life.  It is very easy to talk about abortion using sanitized words or phrases but Eclipse of Reason shows in graphic detail one form of the most frequently performed surgical procedure in America.  Although I also found The Silent Scream to be compelling, I do not believe you can view Eclipse of Reason and look at abortion-on-demand the same again.  People who are close to me have criticized me for showing the film because it is so graphic but I ask them ""if you think watching the film is so horrible, how do you think the baby in the film felt?"".  How did the baby feel when it was being torn apart, limb by limb, by limb?  The Kenrick Gosnell trial showed that this procedure is not as uncommon as people thought.  This DVD is, in my opinion, not appropriate for kids under 13 years of age because it is so graphic, however above that age we know that many kids are sexually active.  They need to see the film to see the consequences of pre-marital sex.  Babies should not be considered things we throw away if we don't want them.",1367452800,4,1092,4.425
7798080,5,1573411205,"I watched silent scream and must admit I struggled to see what was taking place inside the womb, but this video is far more explicit as we see the doctor pulling out bloody body parts. The explanations of whats happening are very explicit and we get to see what's really happening: a child is having its arms and legs ripped from its body! Yes we are a sick society when we not only allow this to happen but our media and government(The FCC) don't allow videos like this to go on national or local TV. If people saw this, they would have a change of heart!",1354579200,7,556,4.254716981132075
7798081,5,1573411205,"I'm shocked that I'm the first to review this DVD. It is a MUST Have. The DVD exposes the reality of abortion. This DVD can be used by pro-lifers to show others what an abortion really looks like from the baby's perspective. The DVD is very professionally done.

The video is on youtube.  The run time is 27.04.  Watch it and tell others to watch it.",1285286400,19,350,4.2727272727272725
7798082,5,1573411205,"This video is impossible to find but needs to be published for all to see.  It needs to be viewed so that more will realize that we as a Nation are murdering millions of people every year by way of abortion.
This is a graphic video but murder is often graphic when viewed.  Abortion puts the Holocaust to shame in the number of people murdered without provocation.
Watch an abortion then decide whether or not an embryo is, in fact, a person.",1241740800,4,442,4.378048780487805
7798083,5,1573411205,a very powerful video / this is reality production. Although it is dated (made in 1987) it is still relevant since the human body has not change and murder is still murder. Very good for revealing TRUTH. This should be on DVD format.,1191456000,8,233,4.441860465116279
7798084,5,1573411205,It is unreal that this happens thousands of times in the U.S. everyday and it is acceptable.  This is an accurate account of what goes on behind clinic doors.,1177200000,10,158,4.448275862068965
7798085,1,1573411205,"This video, dated to say the least, gives false and misleading information.

Useless as an educational tool and not worth your 27 minutes.",1143331200,,138,5.0
