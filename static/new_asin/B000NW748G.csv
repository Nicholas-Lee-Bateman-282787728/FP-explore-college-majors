8182168,5,B000NW748G,"This is by far, and surprisingly my favorite tv show i have ever watched. since it's a uk television show i had to watch it on youtube. at first it seems very quirky and odd but not long after watching, it will captivate the viewer and you will not want to leave the boosh's side. the humor is amazing, sometimes dry, other times just straight out gonna-pee-my-pants funny. the first episode i saw was called ""old greg"", youtube it. i would recommend for anyone ages 14-45. it's adventurous and has an atmosphere of - well i cannot really pin point it, i just love the feeling i get from watching it. naboo is so funny, well all the characters are, really. i highly recommend this.",1235520000,,681,4.456

8182171,5,B000NW748G,"If you like your comedy surreal and foolish with a gently twisted edge then look no further and come with us now on a journey through time and space to the world of the Mighty Boosh.

English comedians Noel Fielding and Julian Barrett play Vince Noir and Howard Moon two dreamers who in the 1st series are working in a zoo (the Zooniverse owned by American Bob Fossil, played by Rich Fulcher) who spend each episode on magical, and often rather silly adventures. By the 2nd Series the Boosh Boys have left the Zooniverse and are sharing a groovey psychedelic pad with Bollo the ape and Naboo the Shamen. In the second series the sets and backgrounds definately become even more colourful and surreal. Whether they are arguing about jazz versus electro like two 12 years olds, crossing the arctic tundra to steal a magical emerald, trying to escape from Ape Hell, meeting with Old Gregg or mateing with a Yeti,  their colourful sets, costumes and fabulously original music numbers (each episode has a musical set piece) will take you with them to the Surreal Life.

Strange little animations, puppets, men in animal costumes, cheap but effective sets and special effects all add to the charm. It's an innocent charm but an odd one. The comedy is innocently surreal rather than dark but it's never over sweet.

Beware though - if you like your comedy mainstream and obvious humour, move along. There is nothing for you here...",1174435200,28,1424,4.753036437246964
