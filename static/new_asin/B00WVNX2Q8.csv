8714495,5,B00WVNX2Q8,"Appropriate for our whole family.  Pearl Buck was a woman ahead of her time.  A passionate hero who gave a voice to the voiceless at great personal emotional and financial cost.  Great archival and reenactment footage at her Bucks County home.  We have visited PSBI and seen that tiny typewriter where Pearl Buck wrote so many of her novels.  The voice sounds just like her!
We also enjoyed Rob Child's docudrama on Washington Crossing-  another American hero with Bucks County, PA connections. America's First D-Day.",1458777600,2,517,5.023529411764706
