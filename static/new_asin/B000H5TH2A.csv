If you want quality for DVD, then get the 2013 print version of 1 & 2 on a double feature. That is 5 dollars at wal-mart too by the way. Then, get the 3rd movie separately. Then you will have all 3 widescreen and cheaper than this awful package. If you decide on Blu-ray, get 1 & 2 on Blu-ray and the 3rd on DVD.",1444435200,8,413,3.7586206896551726

He loves Stuart so much we watch at least one of these several times a week. He is always talking about Stuart.

The rest of us enjoy watching Hugh Laurie in a totally different character than House. All of the characters were well chosen, and the Stuart Little movies are great family entertainment.

I like that a lot of these movies slip in references that adults can enjoy. As many times as I have now seen all three, I still have fun!",1302134400,,582,4.471698113207547
