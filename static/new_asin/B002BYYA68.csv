3901642,5,B002BYYA68,"All of the episodes on this inspector gadget cartoon DVD are great, but the only problem is that the DVD does not have all of the episodes. About 1 week ago I just bought all of the inspector gadget episodes from I-Tunes. Even if you do not have a Mac computer you still can, for free, download and install I Tunes on your computer. Once you have an I Tunes account, you can buy for only $1.99 per episode, all of the episodes of the original inspector gadget cartoon series. After you look up Inspector Gadget in the General Search option, go to the section T.V. Series, or, T.V. Episodes, and just to let you know there is also other sections like Music and Movies and I Phone Aps, but I did not buy anything from those sections though.

Have fun watching all of the episodes of the Original Inspector Gadget Cartoon. My prayers were answered when I tunes released these episodes to buy on I Tunes.",1301270400,2,900,4.389221556886228
3901643,5,B002BYYA68,"When my son was a boy, he watched Inspector Gadget all the time. I had been waiting for these to come out on DVD, and it seems like the Inspector Gadget movies with Matthew Broderick were popular enough to warrant these original cartoons, with Gadget voiced by Don Adams (Get Smart), being released.

This made a great Christmas present for my son, despite the fact that he is in his 20's now. A little bit of nostalgia is a wonderful thing.",1292630400,,441,4.444444444444445

3901645,5,B002BYYA68,"I wanted to get the first box set of Inspector gadget when shout release it, but I never did and I'm mad at myself for not get it, but I got gadget a go go and I love it , fox you need to release the whole season of Inspector gadget on dvd , there's a lot of people waiting for it to come out",1285200000,,292,3.5076923076923077
3901646,5,B002BYYA68,if you like the 80s cartoon inspector gadget then you should buy this dvd go go gadget collection & i should point out this is not the entire complete series,1285113600,,157,4.266666666666667
3901647,4,B002BYYA68,"It's a shame that Shout Factory didn't sell enough copies of their first and only chronological collection of Inspector Gadget. This was probably the best cartoon of the 80s, and I was looking forward to owning the original run of episodes. After waiting 3 and a half years for more, Fox finally released this new single disc. The episodes are random, out of order selections, and like the other reviewers have said, I want sets that are in order. Still, getting this release is better than nothing. It's 10 episodes that were previously unavailable, and for that I'm thankful. Hopefully this time around it sells enough to merit more releases, preferably with more episodes next time.",1256342400,14,685,4.913793103448276
3901648,3,B002BYYA68,"a grip! Please release the full sets of these episodes! I bought the first box set hoping to complete the entire series only TO BE LEFT HANGING!

5 stars for the show, Inspector Gadget, 1 star for the releases!!!!!

Let's hope the full series comes out on dvd.... the wait has been too long!",1255910400,13,291,4.37037037037037
3901649,4,B002BYYA68,"This dvd is the first release since Fox aquired the rights to the series.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-first-release/dp/B000EF5N4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The first release</a>&nbsp;from Shout gave us the first 22 episodes of the series. This release from Fox is one of those ""couple of episodes to test the waters"" dvds we all hate so much. Just release the series and stop these innane few episode releases.

If you own the first release from Shout you will be happy to know the 10 episodes on this DVD are NOT from the 22 previously released. The episodes are here in thier entirety, with the exeption of an updated Dic Logo at the end, (and in some cases a ""Cookie Jar"" logo [the company Fox hired to release these]). This is a one disk, double sided unfortunatly. The episodes automatically play, however there is a menu from which you can choose which you want to watch. No special features, but there are Spanish subtitles.

The 10 episodes released on this disk are
The Coo Coo Clock Caper
The Japanese Connection
Pirate Island
Mad Academy
In Seine
Launch Time
Photo Safari
Bermuda Triangle
Arabian Nights
The Great Divide

I gave this collection 4 stars instead of 5 because we all would rather see a season release. Since this is unlikely however I would reccomend buying this dvd.",1253491200,39,1344,5.155963302752293
3901680,2,B002BYYA68,"I purchased this because I wanted to let my kids see it, as it was a show I watched as a kid and I knew they'd love it. However, the quality of these DVDs is very poor. They are fuzzy, and the DVD itself doesn't play each time it's put in the player. I wouldn't recommend if you're wanting a nice, crisp picture...",1385424000,,314,4.0

3901684,2,B002BYYA68,"Overall the episodes were fun but the picture quality was not improved from the 80's at all.
We are in 2013 so I would have thought that they would be able to make some improvements.",1371772800,,182,4.228571428571429

3901687,5,B002BYYA68,"This was one of my fav's as a child of the 80's.  Arrived packaged nicely, and have zero complaints.  It's nice to have around the house when you want to put a smile on your face.  How I miss awesome cartoons!  My 12 year old loves it too!",1353628800,,239,3.9166666666666665
3901688,4,B002BYYA68,"I was happy to learn when this DVD came out it contained some of my favorite episodes (""The Japanese Connection,"" ""The Coo-Coo Clock Caper"" and ""The Bermuda Triangle"" come to mind), and they all have not been previously released on DVD sets before. The ""Inspector Gadget: the Original Series"" DVD set from Shout! Factory released in 2006 left me wanting more, and this gives you quite a bit to work with!
Purists be warned: ""The Coo-Coo Clock Caper"" does NOT have Frank Welker voicing Dr. Claw. This was not done for the DVD, but was done during the show's production back in 1983, and I remember hearing this unusual substitution Claw voice as a kid when watching that episode. But anyways, here are my so-called Gadget Factors (ala the previous DVD set review)...

PROS:
10 episodes on a single double-sided disc.
No double-dipping here; all these episodes were not on the Shout! Factory DVD set or on the previous Sterling/UAV DVDs released in 2004.

CONS:
No special features.
The print used for ""Launch Time"" has some noticeable DVNR on it.

EDITS:
All episodes except ""Launch Time"" have the episode's title digitally superimposed onto the opening scene after the intro sequence (usually in a white or red all-caps font.) When these episodes originally aired, including reruns throughout the 1990s, they had no visible episode titles! This wasn't really needed.
The original DiC logo where Gadget dots the ""i"" was cut on all episodes. ""Launch Time"" simply ends with a newer (and admittedly annoying) Cookie Jar Entertainment logo, and the other nine episodes end with the extended 2001 ""Incredible World of DiC"" logo, followed by the original early 1980s LBS Communications logo and a Bohbot Entertainment logo (most episodes on the Shout! Factory DVD set end with these logos too.) This was sort of unnecessary.

Overall, not a bad DVD, and it is a step up from the early UAV/Sterling offerings, and perfectly compliments the Shout! Factory DVD set, so it's perfect for the casual viewer to the hard-core DiC/Inspector Gadget fan!",1332720000,,2036,4.979411764705882
3901689,4,B002BYYA68,"I remember watching Inspector Gadget when I was a kid. I remember I liked OK.  My kids watch DVDs in the car because we have a longer than usual commute to school and home each day.  They've seen everything so we were up for giving Inspector Gadget a try.  They like it.  They are glued to the screen and interested to keep watching as many episodes as time allows.  Occasionally, Inspector Gadget turns to the kids viewing and tells them some sort of ""safety tip"" like not to touch a hot stove, etc.  It's a bit quirky.

As a mom, I think it's alright. Inspector Gadget reminds me of Get Smart. The overall tone of the show is unoffensive.  I don't recall the bad guy being as nasty as he is.  Dr. Claw was a vague memory to me from way back when I saw the show myself. But now that I am the mom, I dislike a lot of the things Dr. Claw says and does.  Obviously -- he is the bad guy for a reason.  But this isn't what I want my kids to take into their storybook icons.  Still, it isn't so annoying that I ""lose"" the DVD.  The kids don't seem to notice the subtleties of Dr. Claw's evil doings.

We'll keep it in our library but will not seek any other versions.  I am not sure if this is the only DVD.",1327104000,,1202,4.012658227848101
