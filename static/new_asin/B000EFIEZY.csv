8155754,1,B000EFIEZY,"This movie is a documentry of a nudist camp in Los Angelos. The movie reveals about being free to run around nude and free to whoever you want to have sex with. If this movie is not avalible on VHS anymore,then don't exspect it to be released on DVD or Blu-ray in the near future unless you have the movie yourself to burn over. So what I'm trying to say is that this movie is no block buster hit.",1359763200,,397,4.037974683544304
