8127220,5,6304290373,"I have been collecting video recordings of classical music, and this is one of the best.  The sound is excellent, as are the camera angles.  Ozawa (unlike many conductors) does not hog the camera; one really gets a fine sense of how the music is actually made.  It is an outdoor concert, but that contributes to the fun: the orchestra members smile and chuckle when, occasionally, the reaction of a child in the audience is heard.  All in all a superb video; I highly recommend it.",1109030400,2,481,4.558139534883721

The selections played are some of our favorites (including Sabre Dance, 1812 Overture, Nutcracker Ballet Suite)! I would highly recommend this video to anyone who loves classical music!!!",1060732800,2,255,5.095238095238095
