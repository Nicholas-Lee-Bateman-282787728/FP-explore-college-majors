7795612,5,0970365500,"This is one of the best video about Capoeira. Actually this is the only documentary VHS that you can find in internet.
The video does not include many roda's or acrobatics or basic but it has very good, friendly conversation about what capoeira is.
Mestre Acordeon and his students in Berkeley prepared this video to show what Capoeira is, and how it works in States.
This video is the best way to understand the capoeira and show other people what you are actually practicing.
Mestre Acordeon gives lots of information about different aspects of the game, history, school and of course AXE.
I loved it and strongly recommend it to all capoeiristas around the world.",1046131200,3,666,4.8
7795613,4,0970365500,"The is the best capoeira video I've ever seen (but there are not  a lot of capoeira videos availible in the US). Even though ""Jogo de Capoeira"" focuses on Bira Almeida's (Mestre Acordeon) Capoeira Arts Cafe in Berkeley, it is a great documentary about the game of capoeira and what is means to be a capoeirista.
People from other martial arts often don't understand why someone might to a handstand in the middle of what they percieve as a fight. Get this video if you want to understand why.
This video won't teach you any capoeira moves. It will help both the capoeirista and non-capoeirista understand why people play capoeira, why they sing the capoiera songs, and why people live capoeira.
Get this video if you want to better understand what is in a capoeirista's heart and mind...",996969600,6,787,4.702898550724638
