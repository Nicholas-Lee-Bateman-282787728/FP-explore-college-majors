4387262,5,B004IO0R1Q,"We have a 3 1/2 year old that spends some time in our home. We catch the 10 minute episodes of Pocoyo on PBS on occasion, and he just loves them, but they only come on twice a day. I thought it would be fun to have a video for rainy or boring days in the house. We really enjoyed this dvd. The cartoon is quite cute, entertaining, and fun, even for adults. The stories are short, so they keep the kids' attention, and they always have a wonderful little moral (like sharing, working together, helping a friend, etc.). And, unlike some of the popular cartoons or shows, they're not annoying or tiresome for adults to watch. I have shown this show to several children, both boys and girls, and ages 6 months to 5 years, and they all enjoy this show. I purchased 4 Pocoyo dvds at once, and ended up giving two of them to a girlfriend who has a toddler and runs a child day care from her home, and she and her kids love them, as well! And again, they range in age from a few months old to almost kindergarten. She loves that, on a rainy or housebound day, it catches and keeps the kids' attention, they laugh, play along, and really enjoy the stories.

I didn't notice when I was considering purchasing this dvd, but there are several stories/skits on each dvd, which adds up to an hour (or more) per dvd. I wasn't certain, since the shows are only 10 minutes on tv, so that's why I purchased 4 dvds. But, since they are each so long and have so many shows on each one, that is why I gifted two of them to my friend. I knew her kids would enjoy them and she would make good use of them. Great purchase!",1334102400,,1598,4.15483870967742
4387263,5,B004IO0R1Q,"My 2 year old daughter & 4 year old son LOVE Pocoyo - This is a great DVD for little learners & lots of fun to watch!  The only tiff i have with it is it take WAY TOO LONG to get to the Pocoyo Clips because they over filled it with clips pushing other PBS shows, etc.  PS - I'd also recommend the entire Word World collection.  It's highly educational, fun, colorful and more!  I figured all Mommy's need to know about ""Word World"" too.  ;)",1333411200,,440,4.011494252873563
