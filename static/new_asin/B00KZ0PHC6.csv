8662764,4,B00KZ0PHC6,"Although I think there are some flaws in this movie, I enjoyed it because of the great acting by Lee Jong Suk who is the lead character.  This movie had a little bit of everything; violence, comedy, romance, high school gangs, and teens living in rough home situations.  It also had some interesting music choices, including some American classics.  The countryside scenery was beautiful.  I do think the ending was too abrupt, though.  If you're interested in a little education about high school in the Korean countryside in the 1980's, and you're a fan of Lee Jong Suk, you'll probably like it.",1529107200,,597,4.813725490196078
