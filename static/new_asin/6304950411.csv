7880397,5,6304950411,"This is a very sweet movie. I like movies where people go back in time, and this movie has this element.  I don't remember any cursing, like one reviewer said, but I do agree this is not really the kind of movie that most children would like; not because of any bad language, but because it has so many subtle parts that make the viewer think and wonder and discuss, even after the movie is over.  It is not an explicit, ""in your face"" or action movie at all.  If you don't like that, this is not the movie for you.

A last note: I find that one either likes these kinds of movies very much, or not at all. (Re: ""The Lake House"" and ""Field of Dreams,"" for example.)  I, for one, love them!",1394841600,,689,4.074074074074074
7880398,2,6304950411,"Bought this on the strength of loving ""Marley & Me."" Marley fans should note he appears only for around 2 minutes about half way into the movie, and doesn't keep still enough for a full shot in all that time! John Grogan's description of Marley's breathing destroying the sound is right - but sadly the ""exit the car"" scene he makes so much of in the book is reduced to a few frames of the dog lying inside the van in the actual cut.

Of the movie itself, and the human cast, they all struggle with dodgy dialogue and enthusiastic but deeply flawed direction. The main issues, though are in script narrative, editing and continuity - all of which left this viewer howling with frustration.

Tom Guiry and Danielle Comerford should consider full-time dramatic careers as they are both watchable youngsters who give great warmth to the tale (Comerford in particular lifts the ending with a sensitive moment). The adult actors should probably lose this movie on their resumes, though.

As another reviewer here says, you can see what they were trying to do, but just don't get there in the end. If you see a copy of this tape cheap in a flea market, buy it, but if you are a Marley fan, think twice before spending big bucks - aside from two minutes of the hound, there isn't much that will hold the attention of anyone unless a 10 year old baseball nut.",1179705600,6,1351,4.506122448979592
7880399,5,6304950411,"Jonathan Lyle (SEYMOUR CASSEL ""Indecent Proposal,"" ""It Could Happen To You"") is a retired doctor who is confined to a retirement home because of his failing heart.

Jonathan now spends most of his time watching the kids in his neighborhood playing baseball. Although he loves watching them, he regrets that when he was a boy he never had the chance to play ball -- Jonathan grew up during the tough times of the Depression, and baseball was a luxury that Jonathan's family could not afford.

Jonathan's friend Emma sees this sadness in Jonathan. Concerned about his ailing health, she makes a deal with a MYSTIC who gives Jonathan a second chance to achieve his dream of being a young boy again. The only conditions: once transformed, Jonathan will have no recollection of his past, and he can only be young for five days. At exactly 6 o'clock, on the fifth day the process will be reversed, and he will once again turn into an old man.

Jonathan goes with Emma to the MYSTIC, and is magically transformed. The ""young"" Jonathan (THOMAS GUIRY ""The Sandlot,"" ""Lassie,"" Disney's ""four Diamonds"") shows up at the local arcade where all the kids who he watched playing baseball hang out. He is immediately drafted onto their Little League baseball team as they are in need of a replacement player.

In the first four days of the most incredible adventure of his lifetime, Jonathan not only lives out his dream of playing baseball, but he also experiences young love and the special bond of young friendships. He is also able to teach the team's over-zealous coach (baseball great GARY CARTER) and the other players an important lesson . . . that the real essence of being young and playing baseball is having fun.

It is now day 5, and Jonathan and his team are in the last inning of the championship playoffs where he is about to make the play of his lifetime . . . just as the hour is about to reach 6 o'clock.

Also stars baseball great DAVE WINFIELD.",1142812800,3,1949,4.618497109826589

I find it a bit ironic that the only positive review for this film just happened to originate from the town the star's (Tom Guiry) parents reside.  I believe mom... had something to do with it!!
This movie was so bad it was never even released at the theaters!  The only reason to see it would be to laugh at some of the worst acting I've ever seen.  This film was made in Florida and all I could think of while watching it was, ""They could have been at Disney World enjoying themselves rather than wasting their time on this""....",982281600,2,582,4.2727272727272725
