8103762,3,B000E1BNTW,"I was waxing nostalgic (pun intended) and made this purchase on Amazon about six weeks ago, because I remembered being a teen and seeing it replayed ad infinitum on ""U.S.A. Up All Night"" back in the day--censored, of course. There  was scene after scene of really hot babes in tiny little wet bikinis and I thought ""Wow...the uncensored version of this must be incredible!""

Except that it isn't. Such potential but so little payoff. This release is almost exactly the same as the one that I saw all of those years ago...there are just four nude scenes, perhaps five, only topless, and not including the women who you REALLY want to see.

They sold this movie based on the opening credits, where former Playboy models the Morrell sisters flit around wearing almost nothing, and wash cars. Wow. In 1992 those two girls might have been the finest things walking the planet.

In several of the other car wash scenes, there also are some other former Playboy gals, including Sandra wild, and they bounce and giggle and jiggle and bend over a lot. However, NONE of these women actually get naked, which to me is the equivalent of cinematic bait and switch.

It's pretty obvious that these music-video-style scenes were shot separately, probably in a couple of hours on an afternoon when nobody else was around. The rest of the cast and crew shot the movie itself at some other time. There isn't even any interaction between the hot women and the speaking cast members.

As for the plot (who cares?), it's typical B-movie nonsense, where the little people fight the big people usually over some revenue interest. In this case it's competing car washes. Three women who ran a cafe at the big car wash in town are unceremoniously fired and physically removed, so they go down the street a piece and hook up with the new owner of another car wash. Together they come up with the idea of a bikini car wash and there you have it.

What I find to be most interesting is that when this movie originally was marketed, it was called ""Bikini Carwash Company"" (which is what the car wash is called in the movie). Yet as you probably know, there is another movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bikini-Carwash-Company-1992/dp/B00551WZUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bikini Carwash Company (1992)</a>&nbsp;with that title that was released the same year--most soft-core aficionados consider it to be the better of the two films. Why? More and better nudity. I'm assuming that lawsuits were filed and the other production company had better lawyers.",1338595200,,2578,5.037558685446009
