8656868,3,B00K9EHDXE,I saw the Monkey King 2 and really like the DVD but was a little disappointed in Monkey King: The legend Begins. It moved a little slow for my taste.,1492560000,,149,4.0
8656869,4,B00K9EHDXE,"This is an interesting retelling of the prelude to Journey to the West - a classic of Chinese literature and storytelling. The production is very colourful, good special effects and the story clips along. The English subtitles are not quite perfect but the visuals make up for that. I am looking forward to watching the sequel.",1466294400,,327,4.857142857142857
