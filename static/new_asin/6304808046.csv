934805,4,6304808046,"On the surface, The Heartbreak Kid is a small movie with a simple plot. Lenny (Charles Grodin) dumps his wife (Lila played by Jeannie Berlin) of five days to pursue a beautiful coed (Kelly played by Cybill Shepherd). Standing between Lenny and Kelly is Kelly's possessive father (Mr. Corcoran). Character portrayal is almost perfect. Charles Grodin is convincing as the self-centered and reckless Lenny. Finding an actress more capable of playing the naive and boy-teasing Kelly (Cybill Shepherd) would have been very difficult. Eddie Albert (Mr. Corcoran) stands like a brick wall between Lenny and his conquest (Kelly).
More interesting than the character portrayal and story line are the underlying motives of the characters, and the consequences of their actions. Lenny abandons his wife (Lila), and leaves her brokenhearted. He is headstrong and determined, but also callous and foolish. Kelly's affection for Lenny is quite immature: she see's him as a strong father figure although he is actually egotistical and, quit frankly, short-sighted. The most mature and rational character in the film is Mr. Corcoran. The Heartbreak Kid works as a lighthearted love story; that is, cute boy wins cute girl despite their social, economic and religious differences. Thankfully, The Heartbreak Kid doesn't attempt to promote any moral themes. If it did, the film would fail. The viewer could not be satisfied with the nice cute boy wins nice cute girl conclusion because the boy (Lenny) cares for no one except himself. In summary, The Heartbreak Kid is a qualified winner with just one caveat: don't think too much.",975715200,17,1613,5.231660231660232

934808,4,6304808046,"43. THE HEARTBREAK KID (comedy, 1972) Lenny (Charles Grodin) a young Jewish man, marries seemingly perfect-match Linda. On their way to their honeymoon in Miami Lenny realizes that Linda's various idiosyncrancies are  driving him crazy. In Miami he meets Kelly (Cybill Sheperd) a young-WASP  beauty whose lustful innuendoes he falls under. After 2 days of courting  her he decides to leave Lina and go away with Kelly. He follows her to  Minnesota where he plans to marry her. However, Kelly's rich parents object  to her seeing the undaunted Lenny. But he shamelessly fights for Kelly's  hand in marriage.
Critique: Extremely funny, satirical film adapted by  Neil Simon and directed by Elaine May. It is Charles Grodin's best outing,  proving that once he could act and have a comic touch (his persona has  become strangely wooden, as if entranced or something). Lenny is the  ultimate, unthinkable 'schmuck' who cons his way into any situation. The  comedy of the film relies on his unnerving pursuit of Kelly, and how his  ridiculous lies and deceit work to his favor. Trying to pass himself as an  honest, likable fella, we are astonished that Kelly even notices him.  Thinking that 'honesty is the best policy', he repeatedly infuriates those  around him with his pathetic stories. Inspite of all this, we can relate to  this guy. Maybe because at one time or another we have sunk as low when  pursuing our lusts. At the end, you really have to admire the guy for  trying. After all, the never say attitude sometimes works.

934885,4,6304808046,"Not to be confused with the bad 2007 remake, this wonderful take of Neil Simon's play and screenplay still seems relevant, even with the lack of a newly generated video disc.  I actually caught the movie on Turner Classic Movies with no better options available.  Directed by Elaine May, the film deals with the very Jewish relationship between Lenny Cantrow (Charles Grodin) and Lila Kolodny (Jeannie Berlin and Elanie May's daughter).

The pair appear to be a typical New York raised couple.  The 21 year old Lila, however, is ""saving"" herself for marriage.  And as much as he tries, Lenny can't get past second base.  So what's a guy to do?  He marries her and off they go headed to Miami Beach for their honeymoon.  Driving his beautiful Triumph TR-6, they leave snowy New York behind.  But in Virginia - the states are how Lenny remembers things - Lennie begins to question his decisions.  Lila seems to like a play-by-play of how she's doing in the sack.  She's a bit of a klutz which Lenny never realized.  In a funny scene - in Georgia - Lila hems and haws over a lunch menu before ordering an egg salad sandwich which she manages to spread all over her face, seemingly unaware.

Once the couple arrive in Miami Beach, Lila eschews sun tan lotion against Lenny's advice.  The result?  A terrible sunburn, which keeps her in their room slathered with wet towels and cream.  Lenny, now on his own heads for the beach where he improbably meets a Nordic goddess from Minneapolis.  The stunning Kelly Corcoran (Cybill Shepherd) flirts and toys with the smitten Lenny.  But Lenny isn't just happy to spend fleeting time with Kelly, he's determined to be with her...forever.  Still, he just got married.

Some of the best moments are when Lenny has to explain absences over the next couple days, as Lila heals in her room.  There are also some great scenes involving Lenny, Kelly and her parents (Audra Lindley and Eddie Albert).  Watch in a dinner scene after they first meet, how motor-mouth Lenny explains how he has fallen for Kelly.  The facial expressions of Kelly, mom and especially dad convey a whole gambit of emotions.  Another key scene involves the ""break-up"" dinner when Lenny takes Lila out to a fancy restaurant.  Berlin and Albert earned their Oscar nominations in these dinner scenes.

After Lenny ends his relationship with Lila, he heads off to Minnesota where below zero temperatures are the high for the day.  He once again confronts coed Kelly, her bulky boy book carriers and of course Mr. Corcoran, who wants no part of Lenny in his or Kelly's life.  The ending seemed a little out of place, but that is a minor quibble.

The film caused some controversy as I recall.  Most thought of Lenny as quite the cad.  I had to keep quiet once I first saw the film many years ago.  But now I will say, I can't fault the guy.  He made a mistake.  He did his best to fix it.  And he fell in love with Cybill Shepherd (who didn't?) and did something about it.",1425081600,3,2973,4.5980952380952385

Charles Grodin was excellent, though, as the two faced husband.  And though this was good, I do recommend the more balanced approach of the Farrelly brothers, in their 2007 remake, which did much more to emphasize the reasoning of the husband, and was generally more humorous.

934943,5,6304808046,"Elaine May first gained faim as one half of the acerbic, droll, brilliant comedy team with partner Mike Nichols.

Her comic genius inevitably propelled her into film.  But between 1971 and 2010, she is only credited as writer and director on four films including the financially disastrous but underrated Ishtar - a very funny film that remains essentially unseen.  (Now nice it would be to have a hi-def version with commentary by stars Warren Beatty, Dustin Hoffman and director May).

The Heartbreak Kid is one of those gems that has lost none of it's sheen over time.  Written by Neil Simon at the top of his considerable comic powers, and starring a perfectly cast Charles Grodin and Cybill Shepherd, this film is considered to be May's best work behind the camera.  Sadly, it remains among the least recognized comedies of the 70s.

The premise is perfect and the execution is flawless.  Charles Grodin is Lenny.  On his honeymoon, he meets the girl (Shepherd) of his dreams.  Lenny pursues the dream to his inevitable doom - bit remains oblivious of the reality of his madness.

This film is a perfectly matched bookend to May's former partner's equally brilliant, now iconic movie The Graduate.  Shepherd's character is flattered and amused at her pursuer's single-minded madness and allows it to continue, hardly encouraging Grodin's character, because she is spoiled, privileged, bored and wonders how it will end.  He's a mere diversion.  That theme is the same thing that movies do best -- divert and amuse.  And that's all Grodin's character offers to Shepherd's aloof wasp goddess.  The movie is a brilliant metaphor of why we love movies.  And that's why I consider this one of those rare, almost perfect films.

Writer Simon's clear insight into human foibles and unchecked desires fuels the engine but it's May's intuitive sense of a schmuck's dream for a golden shiksa that drives it.

Highly recommended but very hard to find on DVD.

This needs to be re-issued in Blu-ray with commentaries by May, Grodin and Shepherd!",1267660800,6,2038,4.95575221238938
934981,5,6304808046,"This film is the 'one that got away.'It should have had an Oscar but was never going to get one. Even the professional critics had an hard time reviewing it. The best that most of them could do was to compare it badly with 'The Graduate' a film not even in the same class for subtelty as the 'Heartbreak Kid'  Shepherd,Grodin,Jeannie Berlin,Eddie Albert and Audrey Lindley, all great character players, live up to that reputation. Between them they serve up a tragi-comedy which epitomises in extreme form the only too believable story of human pity selfishness and mirth. In the setting described it is a modern morality play which comes near to perfection in the genres of both comedy and tragedy melded together. It is not cinema verity,it is not black comedy but a film that is unique and defies categorisation. I have both the 1969 and 1972 versions and find I am able to watch this film again and again. The ending alone is a masterpiece of subtelty so much so that one professional reviewer was left asking ""Where's the end""
Well its there and finessed with a masterly touch. After Lenny (Charles Grodin) has divorced his newly wed wife on their honeymoon, and has married Kelly Cocrcran (Cybill Shepherd),the scene moves to the Wedding Reception. Lenny does the rounds mouthing platitudes about ""putting things back into the country""rather than just taking things out. Finally he sits on a settee by himself and is joined by two children, after a little talk to and fro, he turns to the boy and asks him what he is going to do. The young man replies that he doesn't know yet adding""I'm only ten."" Staring into the middle distance Lenny utters the vacuous phrase:""I was ten"".The children leave quickly and the film fades with Lenny still contemplating his childhood. A must see for anyone who loves films.",1264896000,7,1812,4.752380952380952
934982,5,6304808046,"Respectfully disagree with the reviewer who called this film "" a pauper's 'Graduate' "" It couldn't be further from the mark, and this in no way is meant to diminish Mike Nichol's excellent 1967 film. On the surface ""Heartbreak Kid"" doesn't appear to take itself as seriously as The Graduate, but upon repeated viewing it proves itself the other film's equal in nearly every respect and actually surpasses it in others. It's a testament to the talents of Nichol's performing partner Elaine May, who directed daughter Jeannie Berlin and Charles Grodin in this 1972 gem. Many people are thrown by the film, likely because it's neither comedy nor drama. It's closer to black comedy, but even this doesn't cover it. Its ending frustrates many, but fits the film's theme beautifully.

The individual performances are sublime - Grodin hits the ball out of the park, and Jeannie Berlin delivers a performance that makes one wonder why she never went on to greater things. She absolutely steals the scene where Grodin breaks up with her a week in to their honeymoon at a Miami Beach lobster restaurant. In one nearly continuous take, she goes from obliviousness to the depths of grief, and then to quiet, dignified resolve. Cybil Shepard is perfectly cast as the shiksa goddess in her Last Picture Show prime, serving Grodin with the same pointed disregard as he does Berlin. The film is a testament to the subtleties of human cruelty, side-splittingly funny in parts and difficult to watch in others. It's the kind of film that reveals itself in repeated viewings over the years. Also one of the few films that works equally well in vignette, and can be broken down like ""Goodfellas"" for its individual scenes and performances. The clip with Eddie Albert and Grodin in the restaurant when Grodin reveals his plans for marrying Albert's daughter, and then adds the ""one small complication"" of his being a newlywed is brilliant, and can stand on its own.

It may not have the shine of The Graduate or the haunting refrains of Simon and Garfunkel singing ""Sounds of Silence"" as Benjamin explores the depths of his parents' swimming pool .. but it would be a large mistake to pass it off as a pauper's version of the more famous film. I've seen both many times, and I'll make an argument for The Heartbreak Kid every time.",1242345600,20,2310,4.801507537688442
934983,5,6304808046,"I think every man who finally takes the big step,has second thoughts about it at some point. Usually when a beautiful women gives him the eye.....but few men take it to the extreme that Lenny does. Who can blame him? Cybill Shepherd is absolutely stunning,and Lenny is absolutely smitten. The only question that bothered me is what in the world did she see in him? No matter,Charles Grodin got just enough attention from her that he decides he is going to make Kelly his,and nothing is going to stand in his way.....not her ultra conservative father, who can't stand Lenny.....not even the fact that he is on his honeymoon. It soon becomes very evident that Lenny is a cad,and a cold hearted liar when he finally dumps his new bride and sets out on his relentless pursuit of Kelly. I can't say enough about the acting in this movie. Eddie Albert was terrific as the protective,right wing father, from the Midwest. I think Charles Grodin did his best work ever in this movie,and really brings the character of Lenny to life. As for Cybill Shepherd as the beautiful Kelly,all you need to know about her is the title of my review.....poor Lenny and his new bride never stood a chance. She is absolutely captivating. Oh yea,and Jennie Berlin as the dumped newlywed.....she won a Oscar for best supporting actress. Terrific movie,right up there with the Graduate.

934984,3,6304808046,"From the opening scenes accompanied with the opening sound track the similarities with a much better comedy ""The Graduate"" becomes clear.  The Simon and Garfunkel-sounding clone track to the very ""odd"" ending borrow heavily from ""The Graduate"" formula.  Both films cover taboo topics and things that just weren't done in those days designed to shock and entertain the audience at the same time.  Both make heavy use of the popular music soundtrack with Burt Bacharach's doing here what Simon & Garfunkel's did to much better effect on ""The Graduate"".  I sympathise with another reviewer who's just as confused as I was a couple of years back with the choices for AFI best ever comedies and I think the selection criteria had nothing to do with films that necessarily make you laugh until you split your sides but more so films with ""substance"" as well although I am not suggesting that I believe this film should be among the list either.

The ""substance"" here is arguably the directing skills of Elaine May although I have to say that the best part of the movie which earns it at least 2 stars is the ""Confession"" scene and Jeannie Berlin thoroughly deserved her Oscar nomination for a fantastic job making you laugh and mostly feel her intense heartbreak when she realises that the man she loved has severely betrayed her.  First class acting!

The DVD is disappointing though in that although there are no white spots and other age-related imperfections which ironically means that the master was hardly ever used often enough which speaks volumes for the on-going popularity (or rather lack)of this film but the overall picture quality barely rises above the level of average VHS quality.  The sound quality is Dolby Digital Mono which is okay by Mono standards but nothing to shout about.  There are also no Special Features worth mentioning about.

Overall, this is an amusing but mostly chastising and thought-provoking film about people using people for their own selfish desires without considering the consequences to the ""innocents"" that they hurt along the way.  Grodin's character victimises the ""innocent"" Berlin's character just as Shepherd's character victimises Grodin's early on although the telling ending speaks volumes suggesting Grodin's character is still not satisfied and that even more heartbreak is on the cards as he seeks to fulfil his insatiable desires irrespective of the costs on others who have the misfortune to be in his path.

Interesting film but poor dvd version that makes you wonder why you should ""upgrade"" from the VHS.  If you really have to though, wait for a much better restored dvd version both picture and sound quality-wise.",1224374400,3,2674,5.036281179138322

And who but a salesman as the male protagonist--after marrying in haste a goofy, blowzy Jewish princess (well played by Jeannie Berlin, daughter of director Elaine May), our salesman (Charles Grodin (in ""no one else could do the role justice"" casting) falls for WASPy Cybill Shepherd whose father, Eddie Albert, is a hard-nosed cynical father WASP who knows a sleazy opportunist when he sees one, and instinctively hates our salesman right off the bat.

The casting is absolutely perfect; the dialogue crackles and snaps, and I would have to say that this is definitely one of the best American comedies not only of the 1970s, but even one of the best 25 American comedies in the last 40 years.

Comedy, I think, should not be sappy, saccharine, schmaltzy, or dumb. It should bite and crackle and generate guffaws while at the same time digging into what makes us human--i.e., imperfect and therefore dumb and/or wrong in what we do to ourselves and/or those around us.

Who is the master manipulator here?
(a.) Kelly Corcoran - gorgeous, boy-teasing rich girl about campus, as played by Cybill Shepard  after leaving the Last Picture Show in Texas and before ""Moonlighting"" in San Francisco?
(b.) Her rich Daddy as played by Eddie Albert after leaving Arnold and the Hooterville folk down on the ""Green Acres"" farm?
or (c.)  Lenny Cantrow, (Charles Grodin) who abandons his wife- played to perfection by the director's daughter deserving the Academy Award nomination she received - of less than a week on their Miami Honeymoon to go trotting off to Minnesota in the winter to ""win"" Kelly/Cybill?

Two things are as clear as the Sky Blue waters:
(1) neither director Elaine May nor screenwriter Neil Simon is very familiar with our Great State - as when Kelly and Lenny run off to the Corcoran  ""summer cabin in the mountains.""  Um, er, what Minnesota Mountain Range are we talking about here?  The taconite piles up on the Iron Range?
(2) Viewers will never again be able to eat an egg salad sandwich without recalling Lila Cantrow.

935040,5,6304808046,"Social critic Tom Wolfe once labeled the Seventies ""The Me Decade,"" when self-absorption was in high fashion, especially among white males in major metropolitan areas. Two films released at the start of that decade, both in a sense dark comedies, capture the essence of navel-gazing and the drive for upward mobility that epitomized the era.

In ""Diary of a Mad Housewife"", Richard Benjamin stars as a success-at-any-cost husband who rides his wife mercilessly for her unwillingness to play the role of dutiful corporate wife. Two years after ""Housewife"", Charles Grodin assumed the role of Lennie, a malevolently charming newlywed who dumps his bride during a severe attack of libido in Elaine May's ""Heartbreak Kid"".

With Benjamin's character, it's all about whipping the wife into line so he can ride the crest of success. Lennie, Grodin's character, only knows that there's some sort of mountain to be conquered - in this case, Cybil Shepherd - but initially fails to grasp the implications of what she can do for him socially and financially. In the end, each of these extended adolescents doesn't quite know what to make of their place in the world - it takes someone half Lennie's age to ask a basic question that he can't quite digest.

Both Benjamin and Grodin give stunning performances in their respective vehicles - each pouts pitifully and uses his voice in a wonderfully deprecating way at times - but because of the nature of their respective characters, Grodin is given much freer rein to let it all loose. And that he does, turning in the finest performance of his career through bouts of surface charm, sarcasm, unctuousness and inner loneliness. ""Heartbreak"" is a very funny satire about a man-boy who wants to have it all and does his damnedest to make it happen, half-faking it as he goes. With an inspired script and exceptional acting by all - but most especially by Grodin - it's one for the time capsule.",1149897600,8,1930,4.896024464831804

Plot Synopsis: Three days into his Miami honeymoon, New York Jewish Lenny meets tall, blonde Kelly. This confirms him in his opinion that he has made a serious mistake and he decides he wants Kelly instead. Her rich father is less than keen and lets everyone - including Lenny - know that he hates everything about him and the way he is going on.",1133568000,2,377,4.463768115942029
935043,3,6304808046,"This is an intriguing movie with a lot of things going for it, but it ends up falling disappointingly short of greatness. The movie was directed by Elaine May, and the screenplay was written by Neil Simon. Charles Grodin plays Lenny who meets his dream girl Kelly, played by Cybill Shepherd, but unfortunately, he meets her while on his honeymoon with his wife Lila, played by Jeannie Berlin. Certainly, Cybill is great in this movie--funny, charming, and seductive, it's no wonder that Lenny would fall head over heels for her. There are some highly amusing scenes here such as the scene where Grodin gives three of Kelly's classmates a ""drug test"", and the one-on-one scene with Grodin and Eddie Albert. Plus, the movie's oh-so-'70s theme song is amusingly fun.  The ending of the movie is also clever and intriguing.

However, the movie is frequently awkward, and although that's probably intentional, the script comes up short in many places, and at times the acting misses the mark as well. There are some really overblown moments between Grodin and Jeannie Berlin where Grodin painfully overacts. For example, there's the part when he unexpectedly screams at her in the scene where she's lying on the bed with an awful sunburn and he informs her he's going to get a beer. Another example is the part where he gets deliriously defensive when she questions if he's telling the truth over a story that he totally made up as an excuse to spend time with Kelly. Grodin is also cringe-worthy in the scene with him by the fire in the cabin with Shepherd, although it's the lame lines of which he's been given that are more at fault than his acting.

I also want to point out that I find it rather curious that this movie gets classified as a comedy, because it really leans more towards a drama. I mean, if the drawn out, melodramatic scene with Lenny and Lila at the seafood restaurant is supposed to be particularly funny, I find that disturbing.

Overall, still a pretty good movie despite all of its faults--Cybill Shepherd's performance is a must see, and Grodin and Albert have their moments as well, but the movie does leave one feeling frustratingly unsatisfied.",1130889600,4,2169,4.776
935044,5,6304808046,"A film directed by Elaine May, written by Neil Simon, based on a story by Bruce Jay Friedman. If that's not good pedigree, I don't know what is. Admittedly, plenty of fine filmmakers have made bilge, but this one lives up to expectaions - it's fantastic. One of the all-time funniest Jewish comedies, I watch it every year. It's the best thing Charles Grodin ever made, and Jeannie Berlin plays her part perfectly.

It sounds a lofty claim, but for me this film is close to perfection. It's a low-key film, so it tends to get overlooked - even by people who know it - but it's hard to think of anything in it that could have been done better. It's generally funny and sometimes hilarious. The breakup scene at the restaurant is one of the funniest things I've ever seen. And there's one other thing - there's something about films made in the early '70s. They have something. And this is one of the best of them.",1094083200,10,912,4.428571428571429

Classic lines include: ""Don't... don't do that, honey. Don't ever put a Milky Way in someone's mouth when they don't want it."" and ""There is no deceit in the cauliflower.""
One thing I found surprising about this movie is that Charles Grodin's character isn't really all that likable. For that matter, pretty much everyone in this film is somewhat morally bankrupt. Not that that's a bad thing... it just surprised me because the screenplay is by Neil Simon, whose stuff tends to be a bit lighter.
All in all, this is definitely worth seeking out... it'll take you back to the days when movie-makers actually knew how to make a comedy that was FUNNY...",1046304000,22,1052,4.748633879781421

Though the dvd has little in the way of extras, I was still pleased as it one of my favorite films. I rank it right up there with great American comedies like ANNIE HALL. It's certainly the darkest stuff that Neil Simon's ever had a hand in. Grodin, Berlin, Albert and Shepherd-they're all excellent here. A great film from a great female directorial voice(Elaine May-who also directed A NEW LEAF with Walter Matthau-why is there no dvd for that film yet!).

To use a cliche, watching this movie is like watching a car wreck. You cringe, you laugh, you shake your head in disbelief (yet you believe all the same!) as Lenny, played by Charles Grodin, manipulates his bovine wife and sets the stage to marry the Cybil Shepherd character. I've seen this movie a half a dozen times over the last twenty-five years and feel compelled to hail it a masterpiece, a variation of The Great Gatsby theme.",975801600,13,744,4.866141732283465
7878380,5,6304808046,"I saw this film when I was still quite young and not fully aware of real evil in the world as seen in ROOTS, the Holocaust minseries, and other such programming that came along a little later in the 70s.  Up until that time I had never seen anyone be so mean on screen as Lenny is to Lila!

As limited as our choices in life can sometimes be, most of us are lucky enough to choose our mates.  Lenny did not have to marry Lila--period.

Once someone who doesn't have to love you picks you for his wife, he needs to try and make that work.  We all deserve the dignity of a few illusions about ourselves within the intimacy of marriage.

That said, this is a truly brilliant 70s film with one of the best ensemble casts ever.  Eddie Albert, Audra Lindley, and Doris Roberts represent the Old Guard while Charles Grodin (as Lenny), Jeannie Berlin (as Lila), and Cybill Shepherd (as Kelly, Lila's WASP rival) rattle the screen with their unique love triangle.

Charles Grodin and Jeannie Berlin (director Elaine May's daughter) could not have been better as the hapless honeymoon couple.  Jeannie Berlin gives one of the performances of the century as she unbuttons her blouse on the car trip to Miami Beach; smears herself with egg salad and sunburn cream; and otherwise sets world records washing out as Mrs. Cantrow.

Berlin should have won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar and many, many more.  She really does break our hearts, and it is hard to laugh at her.

As with Michelle Pfeiffer in WHITE OLEANDER, Cybill Shepherd's sheer physicality would have made it impossible to cast anyone else in her HEARTBREAK KID role.  Has Shepherd EVER had a bad hair day?

Kelly may not be a better person than Lila, but she is certainly more beautiful, and she and Lenny deserve each other.  Clearly they won't be happy together, and no one will care!

This ""comedy"" might be a little too black for some tastes even today.  Nevertheless, the acting and scripting defy expectation at every turn.

Decades later, I still think about THE HEARTBREAK KID when tempted to be callous with anyone warranting compassion.  Who knows--my turn could come next!",1518739200,,2137,4.650666666666667

It was predictable, superficial, and I am so sorry I wasted my time watching this.

7878387,2,6304808046,"Perhaps the biggest, though certainly not the only, problem with this film is the staunchly unlikeable character of Lenny.  I have never seen such a utter jerk as the hero of a film before.  There is nothing at all likable about him.  He is swarmy, he is self-centered, he is dopey.  So Kelly has to be perceived as an idiot for looking at him twice.  Indeed, Cybil's role is horribly underwritten.  We are never given any reason for such a seemingly intelligent person to fall in love with such an egomaniacal idiot.
  Another problem is the direction.  The scene in which he dumps his wife is interminable - with Grodin overacting in the most egregious fashion imaginable.  Lila is well rid of him and I for one think she should have sung the Hallaluah chorus when he said she should start over.  Of course to add insult to injury, Lila is characterized as a man's worst nightmare (as Lenny is a woman's) - nagging, eating sloppily, constantly reminding her husband that they'll be together for fifty years.  The movie would gave made more sense if his first wife was intelligent and had a modicum of self respect.  But then, of course, we would have to care for her.
