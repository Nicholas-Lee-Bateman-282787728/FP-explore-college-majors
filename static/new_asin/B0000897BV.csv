8417432,2,B0000897BV,"I am studying singing, and so far I have had quite a success. My mentor is Jamie Vendera, and I study mostly by his books/CDs. However, I also wanted to see what else is out there as far as singing tutorials go. I picked up quite a few different books, CDs, DVDs. Some of them were quite interesting and challenging. However, this set is far from being really useful, in my opinion. It is so basic that it hurts that I paid for it. It is not taught by any professional singers, rather, by kids! And, those kids don't sound that well either (some of them were just okay, some were just so-so). So, if you'd like to get some useful material to study and learn how to sing properly I would suggest to look elsewhere. My personal recommendations: all books by Jamie Vendera, Hard Rock Academy Performance Vocals DVD, Singing for the Stars: A Complete Program for Training Your Voice (Book & 2 CD's) by Seth Riggs.",1167091200,11,909,4.416666666666667
