3902638,5,B002C1ZMQW,"A beautifully photographed rendition of Sir Walter Scott's classic story about a Scot trained as a knight at a time when gun powder and firearms was making knights
superfluous.  Acting by Robert Taylor and Kay Kendall is excellent.  There is much humor in this film, and both Taylor and Kendall make their relationship fun and romantic.  Strongly recommend this for anyone interested in a fast paced, action/romantic film.",1301702400,3,422,5.176470588235294
3902639,5,B002C1ZMQW,"The last of Robert Taylor's MGM medieval adventure trilogy, 1955's Quentin Durward was for years regarded as a bit of a disappointment, but seen today it's something of a splendidly affectionate comic elegy for outdated heroes and a genre that was just about to disappear into the mists of time itself. The eternally impoverished Scottish knight is described as a handsome, proud, gallant, honourable and slightly obsolete figure, by his own admission born perhaps a few minutes too late. He's not the brightest of men - when asked ""Have you wits, Durward, or are you merely brave?"" it's a valid question rather than an insult - but in a world where everyone is out for themselves and destroying themselves in the process, his outdated values, unquestioned courage and unshakeable belief in chivalry in a cynical age prove more than a match for smarter men. Taylor is perfect casting, past his time himself and in the last flowering bloom of his stardom, he'd never have fitted in with the thinking man's epics of the 60s and probably knew the writing was on the wall, but that works magnificently in his favor here.

The plot is broadly faithful to the outline of Sir Walter Scott's novel, with Durward sent off to look over Kay Kendall's French aristocrat to see if her portrait flatters her as much as his favorite uncle and the lady's decrepit betrothed Ernest Thesiger's does him, along the way falling in love with her and finding himself an unlikely pawn in King Louis' schemes and plotting. Yet thanks to a witty and intelligent screenplay by Robert Ardrey it's always smarter than you expect, as comfortable with having a maid waxing lyrical about the savagery of the much-missed good old days or George Cole's gypsy discussing the moral practicalities and pliable professional ethics of the spying business as it is with the politics, even avoiding the temptation to turn Robert Morley's duplicitous and quick-witted Louis into a pantomime villain: he may betray anyone and everyone, but he lies, cheats, steals and betrays to ensure the stability of his kingdom rather than for personal gain. It's wonderfully entertaining and often genuinely charming, even throwing in a lively and surprisingly athletic fight in a stable and a real humdinger of a final swordfight with Taylor and Duncan Lamont swinging from bell ropes in a burning bell tower as they hack away at each other. Chivalry and knights in shining armor may have left the movie screens long before the 50s drew to a close, but in Quentin Durward they had a marvellously enjoyable swansong.

Warner Home Video's DVD-R release boasts a decent 2.55:1 widescreen transfer of the film, with the original theatrical trailer the only extra.",1293580800,19,2706,4.958149779735683
3902640,5,B002C1ZMQW,"Robert Taylor was going on 20 years as a major male lead and {in the 1950s} on a box office roll and this 1955 movie showcases him perfectly. He portrays an poverty stricken aging ""Knight Errant"" who knows that his time has passed but nevertheless is going to stick to his principles of loyalty, honor, devotion to duty and bravery in the face of adversity.

Picked by his ancient uncle as his emissary to judge the suitability of a French countess {lovely Kay Kendall} that he has arranged/contracted to marry  - Durward thru a series of double dealing machinations by King Louis X11 {A smug and snarky Robert Morley} runs the gaunlet of all manner of skullduggary, deceit, treachery, technolgy {gunpowder/guns versus his knightly sword} brigands and gypsies in order to get the countess away for Louis from a rival Dukes political machinations. Of course, Louis has betrayed Durward and the countess to the brigands for political reasons.

R.Taylor is excellent as Durward gallant but shopworn and fully cognizant that he has become almost a parody where his loyalty, honor and devotion to duty is a signal for others to swindel and betray him - his portrayal as a insolvent ""put upon"" knight is a far cry from his noble portrayal of  a valiant knight in Mgm's big budget 1952 classic ""Ivanhoe"".

Taylor plays Durward absolutely straight and his gradual adaptation to his new age ""foul"" environment he's stuck in, help from Kendal and a two timing gypsie and with more than a little ""luck"" is able to defeat the villians, save Louie's butt and gain the rich, landed countess as his bride. Director Richard Thorpe keeps the film smartly moving, the production values are outstanding and two bravera action sequences - a battle in a stable with Durward avoiding ax, pichfork and guns from a host of baddies with the countess providing a welcome last minute diversionary manuever and a battle in a bell tower with the chief baddie - both of them madly swinging from church bell rope to bell rope, bells pealing with a fire burning around them - both sequences are well conceived, executed and very entertaining.

Kudos to Willfred Hyde -White as the kings barber who is the only man who the King trusts {because he shaves the king every morning with a straight edged razor} - he is properly unctuous and brazen in dealing with Louie. Robert Moreley is excellent as Louie a pilant schemer whose only ambition was to survive and eventually unite France. But this is Taylor's film and a great farewell to what he called his ""iron jockstrap roles""  This is an under-rated and really excellent movie that I give 4 1/2 stars and strongly recommend.",1271030400,13,2641,4.791208791208791
3902641,4,B002C1ZMQW,"Re the movie itself:  As an adaption of a Sir Walter Scott novel I most of the time knew what book I was in and found nothing to make me say that the film makers got it all wrong.  Robert Morley is wonderful as the king of France, and Kay Kendall is quite funny and very lovely as the lady in distress (she had the most marvelous nose in moviedom).  There's a great duel toward the end (not in the book) where a couple stuntmen doubling for the bad guy and Robert Taylor (why oh why did MGM insist on using him in movies like this one and Ivanhoe?  He was so old! And so un-blond!) fight with swords, axes, etc. while swinging from the pull-ropes in a bell-tower.  Pretty cool.  And the score is by Bronislau Kaper.  Pretty cool too.

Re DVD quality: it's okay.  Certainly not HD but much better than the public domain stuff that floats around for a lot of these old movies.  The color was good.  The sound was clear.  The only extra is the trailer.  ""Scene selection"" is based on ten minute intervals.

3902643,4,B002C1ZMQW,"if you watch this movie on its own merit, it's an enjoyable movie, and it doesn't take itself too seriously.  I saw Ivanhoe when I was younger and caught it on TCM earlier this year.  That caused me to look it up online, also look up Robert Taylor, and that is when I read about Quentin Durward being part of three movies produced by MGM, Ivanhoe, Knights of the Round Table and Quentin Durward.

I actually caught ""Quentin"" on TCM when I turned on the TV while getting ready for work, so recorded the last 45 minutes of it and viewing it when I returned from work was enough to peak my interest in the movie.  I then caught the beginning of the movie on You Tube (about 10 minutes worth), and decided to add to my collection.

As I said before, if you don't compare this to anything else, it's a fun movie with a coy sense of humor.  The action sequences are well done, and the bell tower sequence over a blazing fire grabs your imagination, especially when Quentin (Robert Taylor) jumps onto a rope one last time--you don't see the outcome until a later scene.

Kay Kendall lends coyness and a humorous side in her role as the marquess, and she plays well along side Robert Taylor not knowing why Quentin came over from Scotland.  Robert Morley as King Luis does an excellent job and plays his politics with cunning.

A great movie for the family to share, or when looking for something with a good balance of action and romance.",1372291200,3,1431,4.390151515151516
3902644,4,B002C1ZMQW,"This period piece, based upon Sir Walter Scott's novel of the same name, is an entertaining swashbuckling film. It has a noteworthy cast and each member of the cast turns in excellent performance. Moreover, the story itself is not half bad, with a happily ever after ending.

Our erstwhile hero, Quentin Durward (Robert Taylor), is an impoverished Scottish knight, who still believes in the code of chivalry. He is sent to France on a secret mission by his elderly, wealthy uncle to check out a woman on his behalf, a wealthy and supposedly beautiful heiress that his uncle hopes to marry.

When he arrives in France, he gets caught in the cross-hairs of political fractiousness, and along the way manages to fall in love with the reluctant would be bride (Kay Kendall). He also manages to capture the attention of the duplicitous and unscrupulous King Louis XI (Robert Morley).

Robert Taylor is well cast in the role of Quentin Durward, while Kay Kendall is impressive as the wealthy noblewoman and reluctant bride.  Robert Morley manages to be both wily and humorous in his portrayal of the King. The high point of the film is the fight to the finish, which takes place while Quentin Durward and his foe are swinging on ropes in a bell tower.  Those who enjoy swashbuckling films should enjoy this one.",1369094400,2,1305,4.782222222222222
3902645,4,B002C1ZMQW,"I have read Walter Scott's novel twice and this film renders the basic plot in uncomplicated form. Robert Taylor plays the part  in convincing style, but he is much too old to be the character in the book. The film has been written to fit in with the styles of it's era which do not express all the nuances of what Walter Scott writes in the novel. Kay Kendall is an elegantly aristocratic, spirited heroine but her part is written in a way that shows decorativeness rather than the feisty character that the book conveys. Robert Morley plays King Louis as being of strong character, a part that is in good contrast to the eccentrics that I remember from other of his films .",1361664000,,675,4.443548387096774

The uncle, old and near penniless is looking for a rich bride and wants his nephew to go and see if she is worthy. Quentin Durward cares about his uncle and feels obligated to his uncle's wishes. Upon arriving in France, he finds himself involved in political intrigue and adventures; thereby using his skills as a knight.

3902648,4,B002C1ZMQW,"""You are handsome, proud, gallant, honorable... and a slightly obsolete figure,"" remarks the blunt Scottish ambassador to France as he eyes Quentin Durward, a funny-haired, bankrupt yet noble fellow Scot. It's the 15th Century, a modern era in which the gunpowder has come to the fore and the age of chivalry, waned. Durward (Robert Taylor) has been dispatched to France, to Peronne, to deliver a portrait of his beloved aged uncle to his uncle's intended bride, the lovely and young Countess Isabelle of Marcray (Kay Kendall).

Except that Isabelle is aghast at the prospect of marrying someone so decrepit (she refers to Durward's uncle as a ""creaking antiquity""). The ward of Charles the Bold, the Duke of Burgundy (Alec Clunes), she elects to run away. She finds shelter at the Chateau of King Louis XI (Robert Morley) in Plessis les Tours. And since the Duke of Burgundy and the crafty monarch have long been at odds, Countess Isabelle becomes the latest pawn in their power struggle. The countess is lovely but is she worth igniting a civil war? The king doesn't think so, and, under the table, he wheels and deals.

Quentin Durward makes for an iffy wingman. Tasked with scouting his uncle's future bride, he's got no business falling for her. Thankfully, the film doesn't bog down in too many moments of pining and sighs. Durward gets wind of the Duke's implacable nature and the king's duplicity, and he promptly champions Isabelle. But chivalry having given way to back door politics, the Scot may be too honorable and naive to steer his way clear thru the king and the Duke's machinations. Robert Taylor may have been in his mid-forties at this stage, but he's still spry enough to convince as the dashing Scottish man of action. It's not his fault that the fight choreography is stale. I, of course, am staying mum with regards to his non-existent Scottish accent. Maybe it's a good thing he doesn't even try.

QUENTIN DURWARD (1955) is one of the three lavish historical dramas (that have been somewhat clumped together) that Robert Taylor starred in and Pandro S. Berman produced in the 1950s (along with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ivanhoe/dp/B001TKNWUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ivanhoe</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knights-of-the-Round-Table/dp/B007XTDXF0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knights of the Round Table</a>). And while QUENTIN DURWARD has its moments, it's not as entertaining as the other two. I mentioned that Taylor is still spry enough blah blah, but he's still older here than in those other flicks, and there's a demarcation. Kay Kendall doesn't set a guy's pulse racing as convulsively as do Liz Taylor and Ava Gardner and even Deborah Kerr (from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quo-Vadis-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00005JN8Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quo Vadis (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>). But a pair of performances lift the picture. Robert Morley enlivens the screen as the amoral, unpredicatable King Louis XI. George Cole stands out as the shady, cautious gypsy spy who befriends Durward when Durward saves his brother from a hanging. Cole walks away with the best lines. My favorite is when he looks at Durward prior to one of the Scot's periodic heroics, and he mutters: ""Oh, fate, fate, why must I be beholden to a man so brave when I am such a coward? It's embarrassing."" I like my pageantry spiced with snide humor. 3.5 out of 5 stars.",1350864000,3,3533,5.538888888888889

Since his uncle has been his financial support for many years, Quentin can't very well refuse, although he may have some doubts about a man of Crawford's years taking a wife as young as Isabelle's portrait shows her to be.  Isabelle, for her part, is a lady of spirit who has no liking for being a pawn in the intrigues of Burgundy and King Louis XI (Robert Morley); as she flatly declares, she has lands and loyal subjects of her own, and no motivation to tamely accept any husband foisted on her for political reasons.  Quentin, when he arrives, finds himself in the midst of a bewildering mosaic of rivalries and maneuverings: Burgundy and the King spy on each other unceasingly (Quentin acquires a kind of sidekick in Hayraddin (George Cole), a gypsy whose brother he tried to save from being hanged; both men spied for either party as it seemed advantageous to them at the time), and Louis, to whose court Isabelle has fled, would prefer that instead of a stubborn Scot, she should be married to the outcast and rebel Count William de la Marck (Duncan Lamont), in the hope that by brokering such a match he can defang some of Burgundy's ambitions and gain the Count's gratitude and support.  When Isabelle resolves to seek sanctuary with her uncle, the Bishop of Liege (Harcourt Williams), the King sees his chance: he assigns Quentin as her escort, then betrays them to de la Marck.  That Quentin and Isabelle have fallen in love--and neither realizes the extent of the other's emotions--only complicates the picture.  The climax--unique in my experience of movies--finds Quentin and the Count swinging from ropes in the belfry of a burning church while trying to put each other out of action with swords.  Yet despite his rueful admission that men like himself may well be out of date and out of step with the world as it has become, Quentin shows himself to be brave, honest, and a ""good knight and true,"" and--with a bit of help from the Louis/Burgundy rivalry, since neither one approves of the other's choice for Isabelle--everything comes out right in the end, except perhaps for Charles.  Oddly, although the movie was based on one of Sir Walter Scott's better-known historical novels, no mention is made of his name in the credits.",1457395200,,2984,4.825831702544031

As a Sir Walter Scot books to movies trilogy it would go with ""Ivanhoe"", King Richard & the Crusaders e.i. (The Talisman) & Quentin Durward.  As Robert Taylor's Epic Swashbuckler Trilogy you would be filling ""Knights of the Round Table, ""Ivanhoe"" & ""Quentin Durward!""  Some consider this one of Robert Taylor's lesser offerings from this trilogy, but I think its a bit more cerebral  offering more court intrigue & a little less swashbuckling...but just a little.  I think its definitely worth adding to your Sword & sandal/sorcery/history movies!  The cinematography, acting & storyline are all top notch with complex character's & conflicting interest that make this a bit different from your standard epic period piece of its time.  I am a huge fan of all movies with sword's I enjoy the fantasy aspect of the Sword & Sorcery genre & love the Historic period pieces especially the epic's from the 50's & 60's!!!  This period in history is perfect for the big color used in these epic films from the color's representing country's to the elaborate colorful emblem's designating family crest's this was a period of time when Knight's in shining armor were virtually human peacock's & the women were sporting some pretty fantastic wardrobes also!  The more opulent the set's the better!  Yes there was grit & grime & the not so romantic situation's of the common man that were glossed over back in the 50's & 60's but its easy to forgive the grubby aspect's of this time in history when your just looking for some escapist fantasy.  I would argue that what Quentin Durward lacks in physical action it more than makes up for it in political intrigue & the deeper conflict's of human morality!  Quentin fall's in love with the woman he is sent to vet for his Uncle to marry!  For a man who's whole life has been dedicated to the high moral standard's of the old school code of Chivalry this is a moral dilemma!  He is honor bound to protect men that wouldn't make a patch on his ass...again a moral dilemma!  Yes I do believe this is under rated & is every bit as good as ""Ivanhoe"" & ""Knights of the Round Table"" in its own way.  And just because it might not have as many action scenes has Robert Taylor's other two Epic's please don't think it lacks action, there's plenty of clashing sword's and one of the most unique blade battles in the belfry you may ever see!!!  I don't hesitate in rating this movie with 5 star's because I believe it deserves all 5 star's!!!  I know I am very happy to add it to my D.V.D. collection!  I don't rate movies by there budget's but on there ability to entertain & tell a good story & Quentin Durward succeeds on all level's!!",1432080000,2,2831,4.583333333333333
