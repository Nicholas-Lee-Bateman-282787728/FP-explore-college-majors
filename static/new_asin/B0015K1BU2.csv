3145428,5,B0015K1BU2,"I have a 14 month old and bought both this and on-the-move munchkins.  This one has more interactive exercises to do with your toddler, but I think both CDs are good (see review of on-the-move, I have many of the same compliments for this one).  My daughter thinks both are fun, and its easy to do 15 - 30 minutes of exercise with her at a time.",1359331200,7,345,4.134328358208955
3145429,3,B0015K1BU2,"I like the ideas in this video, but I couldn't take all the chatter in between exercises.  Each exercise has an explanation or warning, etc, that lasts as long as the actual demonstration.  Boring to me and my toddler.",1347753600,4,218,4.564102564102564
3145430,3,B0015K1BU2,"I purchased this tape because I wanted something that my son and I could do together. This is definitely a good starter tape. I was disappointed, I think it moves too quickly through the exercises, by the time you round up your child it seems like the exercise is over. However I do have to say that I was a slight bit winded on a few of the exercises that I thought would be ""easy"".
Overall its a great starter to get your child used to working out with you, or great for someone like me that hasn't worked out in awhile and needs to get back into it, slowly.",1313884800,13,560,4.1
3145431,5,B0015K1BU2,"Love this fitness DVD. The workouts seem very low impact but I was sore all over the next day!
Very fun and easy to follow!",1300838400,4,123,3.96

3145433,2,B0015K1BU2,"If you just want a video to guide you on how to play with your child then this is great. Honestly though, I watched the whole thing and you're not going to see any kind of physical results if this is the only ""work out"" plan you follow.",1226102400,3,236,3.9375

8258828,2,B0015K1BU2,Too slow...this is mostly a 'do some stretches and hopefully your kid won't get in your way' session.,1526342400,,101,4.666666666666667
8258829,2,B0015K1BU2,"This DVD had some great moves for exercising with babies and toddlers. I really was hoping for something ""modern"" and more ""workout"" like. I was disappointed in the production quality and how slow paced it was. I do some of the exercises from the dvd everyday, but have only ever watch half of the dvd once",1517443200,,306,4.482142857142857
8258830,5,B0015K1BU2,Great bonding time for me and my son plus I get some exercise in which helps with the postpartum. A great purchase!!,1492560000,,116,4.318181818181818
8258831,2,B0015K1BU2,I was very excited to get this workout DVD and really wanted to like!! I bought it to do with my girls but sadly it's more boring then I could have imaged and doesn't keep them engaged long at all... Really just isn't for us!,1455667200,,225,4.022222222222222
8258832,3,B0015K1BU2,A little slow not much action...my toddler was bored,1418256000,,52,4.888888888888889
8258833,5,B0015K1BU2,"This DvD works great. It was fun to do with my 20 month old. He can participate or he can toddle around and do his thing. I like the slow pace, gets some workout it but no pressure so I can keep it playful with my son.",1399161600,,218,3.6595744680851063
8258834,3,B0015K1BU2,"Nothing special of this DVD. Too much talking in the beginning for me, but gives you demonstrations of how to incorporate your toddler into some yoga type exercise. Using my 17 month old as a weight essentially gives my muscles a good workout, but not a cardio one if that's what you want",1391558400,2,288,4.452830188679245
8258835,4,B0015K1BU2,We have fun working out together and while I am not crazy about it! My little guy sure thinks its fun!,1390953600,,102,3.9047619047619047
8258836,1,B0015K1BU2,"My two year old is bored with it and so am I.
It isn't fast moving enough to keep either she or I entertained, and its not a great workout.",1379030400,2,139,3.6666666666666665
8258837,4,B0015K1BU2,"I have a 2.5 year old son, and this is the only work-out video I can do that will keep him busy and entertained.  It doesn't have the intense feel of a normal work-out video, but that's no surprise.  I think it fairly well accomplishes its intended purposes.",1362268800,,258,4.354166666666667
