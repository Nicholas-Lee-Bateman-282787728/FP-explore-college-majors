8135445,5,B000GYI3T0,"An intriguing, moving look at the life and career of one of the most glorious voices of all time.  A treasure for Wunderlich fans.",1388275200,,130,4.416666666666667
8135446,5,B000GYI3T0,"I rented this from Netflix and decided it was important to add to my opera collection so I bought.  Wunderlich is a singer I was not too familiar with.  My only cd of his is Die Schoen Mullerin.  But after watching this cd I got to learn to really love his voice and it was wonderful to see the man, not just the singer.  The home films with his family were delightful making him a real person and a charming one at that.

My only wish is that the dvd were longer and there was more singing.  I wanted more time listening to his wonderful voice.",1280966400,,545,4.09433962264151
8135447,5,B000GYI3T0,"I really enjoyed the DVD which shed light on  Fritz Wunderlich's background including his untimely death. I liked seeing the home movies that were interspersed with the archival footage of his development as an artist. For anyone interested in Classical music, particularly opera, this documentary is worth seeing. Although it is sad knowing that Fritz Wunderlich didn't have a normal life span in which to develop his artistry, he obviously enjoyed his life and had a ""full life"" as stated by his wife in interview segments.",1251936000,4,525,5.104651162790698
8135448,5,B000GYI3T0,Wunderlich was Wonderful and educational.  I thoroughly recommend it.  Fritz Wunderlich a brilliant tenor who's career was cut short by his tragic death.  More people should be aware of this world class voice.,1206403200,,209,5.2727272727272725
8135449,5,B000GYI3T0,"What can I say? Listening to Fritz Wunderlich is like listening to harps music at heavens, seated with Pavarotti, Lanza and Caruso saying: GOD this guy knows how to sing!!

8135450,5,B000GYI3T0,This is an impressive portrait of a fabulous tenor. It's fascinating from beginning to end. I especially liked the recollections of other artists with whom he once collaborated - stars like Anneliese Rothenberger and admirers like Thomas Hampson.,1191110400,2,246,5.5
8135451,4,B000GYI3T0,"If you are planning to buy this dvd, chances are you already love Wunderlich. If you watch it, you will love him even more, but you are also bound to be disappointed. Most of the film is made up by family footage, which is absolutely adorable (the documentary itself was conceived by Fritz's family--and Fritz himself is credited as ""cameraman""), and truly helps to understand the extraordinary humanity and tenderness of his voice. But unfortunately we get all too little of Wunderlich singing, just scattered clips from arias (Zauberflte, Onegin). True, this is not advertised as a lyrical collection, but as a documentary. Still, one really wishes there were more singing. The extras would be the obvious place for the inclusion of some lieder and more arias without interrupting the narrative flow, but, alas, there are only four clips (Pergolesi's Musikmeister; Zauberflte, again; Strauss' Barcarole op. 17 no. 6; Egk's Die Verlobung in San Domingo). Still, it is a beautiful film, and some of the testimonies are extremely revealing, especially those from Fischer-Dieskau, Christa Ludwig, and, above all, Hubert Giesen, with whom he recorded the most beautiful Dichterliebe ever.",1169596800,26,1185,5.275132275132275

8135453,4,B000GYI3T0,"Fritz Wunderlich was without doubt one of the best tenors of the 20th century.  Little known outside Germany, as he only really sang in German, he died prematurely in an accident, at the peak of his career, thus depriving us of untold future gems.  It was with great excitement that I awaited the arrival of this DVD, the first to review his life and career, but be warned: the English subtitles are not on the screen long, and when they are, they are invariably over the name and association of the person talking, making some impossible to read.  A very poor piece of QA from Deutsche Grammophon and Universal Classics.  That being said, it is fantastic to finally have a chronicle of his life and art, and I strongly recommend this DVD. Interviews with his contemporaries (Christa Ludwig, Hermann Prey), and current mega-star Rolando Villazon complement the commentary of his surviving wife, Eva Wunderlich.  In addition to the main programme of 58 minutes is a 49 minute bonus programme.",1167177600,30,991,4.840236686390533
