8538657,5,B009AT61DM,"A hilarious comedy from mid '70s with great songs by Spain leading tenor, Manolo Escobar and the feature film debut of Puerto Rican bombshell Iris Chacon, singing, dancing and acting more sexual than ever. A box office hit when it premiere. La Mujer es un Buen Negocio, was Chacon's second film and she is not only looking sexier than ever, but acting even better than ever. Another hit at the box office in USA and in Latin America. I loved both these films!",1517184000,,459,4.542168674698795
