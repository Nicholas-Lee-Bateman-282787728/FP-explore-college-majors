8683934,5,B00OJN1OE0,"...and the rest of it was great, too! This DVD provides exercises you can use to improve your visual reflexes. The best part is that you can do them in the comfort of your own home, no need to go to an expensive dojo. Sammy goes on to show how to decease and eventually eliminate your blink reflex in a fight. I'd never seen this taught anywhere else, and absolutely loved it. This is the first part of a four part series. As Sammy explains, you need all four parts to build a strong ""chain."" Make sure to get the other three, as well.",1415145600,2,535,4.153846153846154
