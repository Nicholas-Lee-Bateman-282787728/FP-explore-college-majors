2788163,5,B000NWBSEW,This is the show that got me started to watch korean movies my favorite korean actor is Choi Soo-Jong the first time I saw him in emperor of the sea I fell head over heals for this actor and emperor of the sea is my #1 korean movie.  It has a lot of action betrayal loyalty love but most of all you would enyoy watching this movie with your family.,1179360000,8,348,3.9714285714285715
2788164,3,B000NWBSEW,"Very interesting saga. Most of the story plots does not make sense but somehow as a viewer tends to overlook, i.e. imperial city that is 4 to 5 days at sea but is seen traveled on land by the main character, also the changing beliefs on some of the characters. The wrong doers or evil persons survived until the end (well not all but most except 2) and the heroes did not fare well at the end (all the significant charaters except 2). It would probably deserved a 4 stars if not for the poor ending... too bad. $200 something is probably not worth it at all.",1232928000,,558,4.224299065420561
2788165,3,B000NWBSEW,"I really liked this DVD collection--until I got to disc 17. It was totally BLANK. I knew how the story ended but about 3-4 episodes were lost, right about where the series starts to wrap up, when they start killing off some of the main characters. Unfortunately it was too late to send it back, as Amazon won't accept returns after s period of time.",1231459200,,349,4.384615384615385
2788166,3,B000NWBSEW,"I enjoyed this movie from what I could watch from it. I got a poor bootleg copy and it goes in and out of focus the entire movie on all the DVDs. I tried watching  this on a standard DVD, blu ray dvd, and my computer dvd with the same results. I gave the buyer a good rating before I watched the first DVD. BEWARE of bootleg/poor quality copies of this DVD and I DON'T recommend buying this from the buyer I bought it from",1229040000,,422,3.9647058823529413
2788167,5,B000NWBSEW,"I learned about this series after watching actor Song Il Gook in JuMong.  This series are almost as good as JuMong.

All I can say is it is amazingly good to me. I just fall in love with Jung Moon character.  If you enjoy this movie, you must own the soundtrack.  The music is just beautiful!",1211328000,2,292,4.160714285714286
2788168,1,B000NWBSEW,"This DVD box looks nice but the video quality is very poor.  A total of 4 DVD contains ALL 50 episodes. If you use a Region 1 DVD machine (U.S.)- there is no English subtitle, plus color/sharpness quality is VERY BAD.  If you use an ALL REGION DVD machine, English subtitle appears and color/sharpness ""somewhat"" improved.  BUT, if you are used to normal (not even HD) quality, you will have to like the story and actors enough to tolerate it.  Sound quality is hollow like radio.  Video quality is equivalent to VCD.  Manufacturer is irresponsible in producing such low quality for a high retail price.",1203465600,14,603,4.695238095238095
2788169,5,B000NWBSEW,"Halfway through the 50-episode Korean telenovela, I'm hopelessly hooked.  Each episode (a little more than one hour) has all the right ingredients: greed, ambition, betrayal, commerce, politics, sword-fights, personal challenges, loyalty, and love. The historical costumes and sets are interesting if you are unfamiliar with 9th centory Korea.  Plenty of twists and turns in the plots that leave you wanting more.  Great character development, especially in the stories of arch rivals Jang Bogo and Yom Moon.  I would have liked the ""making of"" featurettes to include English subtitles, but on the whole this is great, entertaining fare.  Three episodes per CD.",1203120000,8,661,5.5049504950495045
2788170,5,B000NWBSEW,"Top quality dramatized account of the life of ancient Korean hero and legend Jang Bo-go (?-846).  Honestly, I don't think I have ever seen an epic TV series that is this good.  It is certainly worth the money so please don't hesitate to purchase it.  I am on my third watching of this series and it seems I pick up something new every time.  The acting performances are really amazing especially the ones portraying the characters Jang Bo-go, Yum Moon, and Madam Jami.  I hope to find other series like Emperor of the Sea.  Also don't worry about not understanding the Korean language - the English subtitles work well.",1202688000,6,619,4.63302752293578
2788171,5,B000NWBSEW,"I have watched so many movies, but this one tops it all for many reasons.
The acting quality, storyline, music, you name it.
The first few episodes are hard to watch because the lead actor is starting out as a slave, but before you know it, he is a gladiator, security officer, merchant, captain of a ship fighting pirates!
The female actors are very powerful, beautiful, and captivating!
The romance quality is profound and the drama does not focus on showing intimate scenes at all so you can watch it with your children.
If you start watching it, be ready to shut the whole world out for 51 episodes.

Enjoy!",1202515200,7,611,4.554545454545455
2788172,4,B000NWBSEW,"I really enjoyed watching this film.  I couldn't get enough of it!  I had to discipline myself in order to keep viewing time down to no more than 3 episodes a day (roughly 3 hours).  When I wasn't watching it, I was thinking about it.  Emperor of the Sea is a wonderful epic series and I would recommend it to everyone.  My only critique is that the script gets really messy towards the end, as if the producers were running out of time and money.  The plot doesn't really make sense as the film comes to a close and the characters' behaviors stray from their true nature.  I won't say more though, because I don't want to give anything away.  I'd be happy to discuss with others who have seen the film.",1197072000,15,703,4.2727272727272725
2788173,5,B000NWBSEW,"I stumbled upon this one night on cable tv and was immediately hooked. This is such a great story, it has everything, love, hate, betrayl, action, etc. The costumes and scenery are fantastic. It tells the story of a boy born into slavery but is determined to get out it. He has two good friends, one is also a slave, the other is the son of a merchant. These three remain friends all throught their lives. This story kept me interested from the first episode all the way to the last. There are lots of twists and turns in the plot, when I was absolutely positively sure something was going to happen, it didn't. Plan to spend a lot of time in front of the tv once you start watching. This is a great film to watch either by yourself or with a bunch of friends. I wish hollyood would take some cues from these korean dramas. If you are hesitating about buying it, don't, you will not be sorry.",1192320000,20,892,4.252941176470588
8182183,5,B000NWBSEW,The best series ever!!!!!!,1482624000,,26,5.75
8182184,4,B000NWBSEW,"Episodes 45 & 46 are currently missing.  Check if they've been returned before you start this series.
This show is a great Korean historical drama with likable (and dislikable) characters.  The story has a nice pace.
Although there are a couple of royal characters, this story is about common people rather than court intrigue like many of the other shows in this genre.  Our main character is unhappy with his life as a slave. With both the turn of fortune and his hard work, he becomes an important man in business and in the government.  There are love interests, friends, enemies and pirates!",1465948800,,596,4.757281553398058

8182186,3,B000NWBSEW,I mostly enjoyed watching the show... Much of the series Was frustrating to watch. The evildoers often outwitted the heroes. The heroes were often clueless. After being outwitted time and time again you would think that the heroes would have some kind of plan. But they were often bumbling idiots. Another stupid aspect of the stories was that the evildoers would pop up in the scene 5 feet away and nobody saw them as if they were invisible. I do know a 30 year old unmarried Korean  woman still living with here parents. She told me she can leave until she is married. What's up with that.,1377907200,,591,4.5233644859813085
8182187,4,B000NWBSEW,"Only purchased 3 episodes of the series. However, I did enjoy the entire series resulting in my rating of very good!",1353715200,,116,4.571428571428571
8182188,5,B000NWBSEW,I watched this on satellite years ago and it was fantastic.  You will be inspired by Bojang and root for him every step of the way; in both Love and War!,1351814400,,153,3.935483870967742
8182189,5,B000NWBSEW,"I am a big fan of Korean historical drama and this is one of the best I have watched so far. Song Il Gook (Jumong/The Kingdom of The Wind) although not being the hero of this serie, gives a great performance as usual. The entire cast was awesome. Lee Won Jong (Warrior Baek Dong Soo) plays Choi Moo Chang, a very endearing character. It was hilarious to watch him considering I just finished viewing Warrior Baek Dong Soo in which he plays one of the most evil characters I have ever encountered ... A convincing actor indeed. Thumbs up to each and everyone in the cast and the director as well. This show is addicting. Good luck to stop watching once you start. Great story, battles, sword fights, martial arts, highly recommend!",1345075200,,730,4.537878787878788
8182190,5,B000NWBSEW,"I don't own the DVD but we watched every single episode on our local Korean TV station here.
But now that amazon has it, I WILL purchase a copy of it just to see it again. I liked it better than Jumong. The breathtaking scenery, actiing and costumes are undescribable.  In the year that this drama came out, it won several SBS awards and Song Il Kuk gained even more recognition as one of Korea's top actors.",1309564800,,408,4.298701298701299
8182191,1,B000NWBSEW,"I am not going to go much into the movie since everyone else has already.  My mother was hooked and beg me to buy this movie.  It is about A boy who was a slave who came to power after years of hard work and even gain the trust of the royal family.  It is a Korean drama series...very much to what we call it day time soaps.  Many of the special effects and camera shots are pretty much like day time soaps.  I was able to catch some of the end story when it came on tv to see what the hype was all about from my mother.  Overall, the movie was very decent as long as you don't expect too much.

As my title states: Do Not Buy the 4 DVD disc set.  There is 13 or so episode in one dvd disc...meaning too many hours of movie in one disc equals very, very, very bad quality as you know that no dvd disc can hold that many hours in one disc. The 4 DVD set usually sells in the $20-30 range.  You need to contact and verify if the movie is a 4 DVD disc set.  If so, stay away.

Now, the good news.  There is a good quality DVD of this movie but it cost a lot more, usually $50+ up to hundreds of dollars.  It is the 19 DVD disc set.  As you can see, 19 DVD disc set can hold 50 episodes of Emperor of the Sea much better than 4 DVD discs......but it does come with a PRICE.",1251331200,6,1269,3.739622641509434
8182192,5,B000NWBSEW,Good acting. Right mix of action and drama. Story never lets up. Excellent martial arts choreography. Most of it not fake looking.,1234656000,,130,4.954545454545454
