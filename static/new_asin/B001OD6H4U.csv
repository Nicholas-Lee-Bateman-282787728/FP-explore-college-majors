8330408,1,B001OD6H4U,"I PURCHASED THIS MOVIE BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE IDEA OF THE DA BOOYYSHOP WOULD BE INTERESTING.  AND IM ALSO A FAN OF BOOTLEG , GHETTO MOVIES.  BUT THIS MOVIE WAS NOT GOOD.  THE ACTORS CAN'T ACT.  AND THEY HAVE BAD BODY HOES WORKING IN DA BOOTY SHOP.  NOBODY WANTS TO SEE THAT.  THE ONLY PERSON THATS GOOD IS THE LEAD ACTRESS, BUT SHE DOSENT SAVE THE MOVIE.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMENED PEOPLE TO BUY THIS, I WISH I COULD GET MY MOVEY BACK.",1268956800,,431,4.120481927710843
