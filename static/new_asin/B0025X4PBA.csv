3849682,5,B0025X4PBA,"Now we finally have them!!!! All the Black and White episodes of Petticoat Junction in the release of Seasons One and Two. Most of these episodes haven't been seen in nearly 45 years due to the fact that they were not included in the Sindication Package which is not good because without the Black and White episodes Bea Benaderet's time on the show is nearly cut in half and that is not good because without Bea Benaderet there is really NO Petticoat Junction!!! When Bea passed away in 1968, June Lockhart did a good job, but Petticoat Junction was never the same without Bea Benaderet.  Bea/Kate was Petticoat Junction, but NOW WE HAVE THEM!!!! All the Black and White Episodes for Petticoat Junction fans to enjoy!!! This is a must get set for ALL Petticoat Junction Fans!!!! All of the eposodes are full just as they were shown on CBS 45 years ago, Music and All regardless of what another poster said. I talked to Linda Kaye Henning and she said they were full and uncut and she should know because she played Betty Joe on the show for its entire run. No fake Banjo Music!!! The Curt Massey Theme and background music is found on every episode and the negatives have been beautifully remastered for future generations to enjoy. One of My favorite eposodes is the one where Uncle Joe orders a new stove for the hotel agaisnt Kate's wishes.  The scene where they are putting the stove togather is a riot and a must see. Also on board is Charles Lane, the man wth the face everybody knows, but nobody knows his name as Homer Bedlow the Vice President of the C&FW Railroad.  Homer never could outsmart Kate and shut down the CannonBall no matter how Hard he tried. Charles Lane passed away only two years ago at the age of 102. He was the founder of the Screen Actors Guild and for many years, he was the oldest living actor in Hollywood!!!  Good News!!!! Good News!!!! Good News!!!! Listen Up Petticoat Junction and Lucy Show Fans!!! This morning, I had a chance to speak with Ken Ross at CBS and personally thank him for CBS releasing the First and Second Seasons of Petticoat Junction and the First Season of The Lucy Show and he told me that the Third Season of Petticoat Junction and the Second Season of The Lucy Show are in the making and are soon to be on the way!!!! Thank You!!!! Thank You!!!! Thank You!!!! CBS!!!! We have waited for these Shows for years to be out on DVD and now we will finally get to own them!!!! Season 2 of Petticoat Junction is great and you won't be disappointed if you get it!!!! Also, check out the First Season of The Lucy Show!!!! It is totally AWESOME!!!!-Michael",1248739200,55,2605,4.477894736842106
3849683,5,B0025X4PBA,"""Petticoat Junction"" season 2 is fantastic! Any fan of this series should get this 5 DVD set. The last of the black and white years, season 2 really shines. The overall quality of these rarely seen episodes is great. Several aspects of this season really stand out. For one, the writing is extremely good. Both funny and clever the viewer can immerse themselves in Hooterville. Never a favorite of the critics, but loved by fans, ""Petticoat Junction"" never got the respect it was due. And second, Jeannine Riley really stands out as ""Billie Jo"". The first of three in the role, Jeannine's version is the best. Not to take away anything from Gunilla Hutton or Merideth MacRae (both were great) but ""Billie Jo"" #1 takes the prize. It makes you wonder what the series would have been like had Jeannine not left in 1965. The extras also make this DVD set worth owning. Linda Henning and Pat Woodell were very gracious to introduce each episode and give an interview (as they did in Season One's DVD release). In general, ""Petticoat Junction"" exuded warmth and laughter. And so does this DVD set. In this day and age with everything so fast paced and uncertain we need more show's like this. And since Hollywood ain't making them...then we need to go back to shows like ""Petticoat Junction"". So a big thank you goes out to Paramount. I'm looking forward to Season Three hopefully sometime soon.",1248652800,2,1389,4.720164609053498

So yes, each and every episode will have Uncle Joe, movin' kinda slow at the Junction!

3849686,5,B0025X4PBA,"I've always enjoyed this show (though it isn't as funny as the spinoff GREEN ACRES) and Bea Benadaret is so charming in the lead that I recommend it to anyone.

Since the earlier black and white seasons of this series (it didn't switch to color until Season 3) have rarely been seen in 45 years, it's wonderful Paramount released these rare episodes. When I was a kid I watched PJ in syndication and they only ran the color seasons, so it's great to be able to finally see these earlier shows.  The video introductions by the cast members are a nice bonus.

Come on, Paramount, now bring on the color seasons as well!",1246579200,3,617,4.442477876106195

Is the theme song with vocals on each episode?

One of the best parts of this show is the theme. ...""There's Uncle Joe he's moving kinda slow at the Junction.""  Let me know before I invest in TV history! Thanks!",1243382400,2,339,4.2153846153846155
3849689,5,B0025X4PBA,"Thank you to Linda Kaye Henning and to the powers involved in releasing season 2 of this classic program.  Petticoat Junction is a gem and it deserves to be released to the many patient fans who have waited for years to take the ride to the Shady Rest once again.

Special recognition goes to Linda Kaye Henning who graces the screen in the Ultimate Collection with extraordinary intros filled with trivia and rich detail.  It was easy to see that Linda Kaye Henning is very proud of this remarkable series.  (My next 2 wishes are that 1) all the seasons of Petticoat Junction will be released and that 2) you write a book on your Petticoat Junction experience.  (I will be first in line to buy it.)

3849690,4,B0025X4PBA,"This was one of a group of CBS rural comedies popular in the 1960's that were actually grouped together as far as having interdependent casts - ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" and ""Green Acres"" being the other two series.

The show is about life at the rural Shady Rest Hotel, owned and operated by widow Kate Bradley (Bea Benaderet). Action centers around guests at the hotel as well as Kate's three attractive daughters, Betty Jo, Bobbie Jo, and Billie Jo. The actresses portraying Billie Jo and Bobbie Jo changed over the years. In fact, season two is the last of two seasons for the first actresses to portray these roles. Betty Jo, the youngest and the tomboy, was played by the Linda Henning, daughter of the series creator Paul Henning, for the entire run of the series. The hotel is literally in the middle of nowhere, halfway between two very small towns. The actual location (state for example) is never given, and the issue of how exactly it is that Kate manages to make what seems to be quite an adequate living running a hotel that theoretically should have few if any guests is never even addressed. This is a show very much rooted in the early 60's, and the idea is escapism and fun, not realism.

The first season of this show that was put out a few months ago is excellent. They were not the cut down versions that TVLand showed, so I expect these to be the same, although you never know with Paramount, The Odd Couple being exhibit A.

This season is from the 1964-1965 TV season, and thus there are lots of episodes (36 I believe), since production costs were lower and thus reruns were fewer. This is not something you'll want to sit down and watch back-to-back marathon style. Instead, I'd watch a couple of episodes a week. That way you maximize the fun of the show, and it still holds up pretty well today, and minimize the sameness you might feel if you just watch one episode after another.",1239667200,48,1909,4.5436046511627906

Bobbie Jo was played by Pat Woodell, who was replaced by Lori Saunders beginning with season three, and Billie Jo's character changed twice after Jeannine Riley began the role.

3849791,5,B0025X4PBA,"Petticoat Junction Official Second Season is yet another wonderful offering by Paramount and it's sister company CBS DVD. It has all thirty six episodes of this second season of this funny and terrific show that ran on the CBS network from 1963-1970. The only special features that if offers are interviews with Linda Kaye Henning and Pat Woodell and another photo gallery. We are again treated with video intros by both Linda Kaye Henning and Pat Woodell.

Likewise with the Official First Season, we are treated with the entire second season. The episodes are digitally remastered from original negatives for superb and superior quality. The original theme song is also included with the episodes of the series.

The entire cast from Season One are all here and there was a new cast addition for Season Two, they now have a dog named Higgins. The second season continues much like the first season as Kate Bradley, her beautiful daughters and their Uncle Joe Carson deal with life living at and running the Shady Rest Hotel.

Likewise, Paramount and it's sister company CBS DVD do another wonderful job on these episodes. The digital remastering makes the episodes fresh, clean and new as the day that they were originally shown on the CBS TV network.

Likewise, this is yet another best set of this classic TV show that makes mincemeat out of all those public domain DVD sets that were released as the DVD boom was taking off.

If anyone from Paramount and it's sister company CBS DVD are reading this, why not release the entire Petticoat Junction series on DVD? That way, we fans and admirers of this series can really be overjoyed. This is only a suggestion, but again, I still think that the entire series should be released officially on DVD. That would be ""IT!""

Overall, this is the finest collection of the second season of Petticoat Junction that nobody who loves this show should be without. This also should be in every fans DVD library.",1337385600,4,1951,4.791666666666667

Current TV shows don't even have openings, let alone theme songs.

3849819,5,B0025X4PBA,"Petticoat Junction was a great family comedy along the same lines as the Andy Griffith Show. It`s a fun, entertaining, and very
funny show. The show centers around a little hotel where Kate Bradley, her 3 daughters, and her ever lazy uncle Joe try to
scratch out aliving. The supporting characters also contribute much to the comedy including that immortal grouch Charlie Lane
as the semi-evil Homer Bedlow.
The show was created by Paul Henning who also created The Beverly Hillbillies. Henning didn`t try to be fancy in any of his
comedies. He just went for basic humour. He knew what was funny and went after it full steam ahead. The results were timeless
classic comedy.",1262390400,7,673,4.810344827586207
3849820,5,B0025X4PBA,"Wondwrful show from the ""Golden Days"" of television.  Good clean fun, wonderfully talented actors.  Bea Benaderet is a great actress, who died way too soon.  Funny show without using sex, violence, cruelty, political correctness, and anything else that passes for entertainment these days. If you enjoy a nice, clean, funny show from a by-gone era then this is for you.  Hopefully,  all 7 seasons will be available for purchase soon.

If good clean television isn't your forte, don't watch the show or waste time making a mean spirited, un-called for review.",1261008000,7,558,5.076923076923077
3849821,5,B0025X4PBA,I have been waiting for this show to come out on DVD for such a long time!  It was my favorite show as a kid.  I could hardly wait each week to see the girls and all the gang.  Thank you so much CBS for bringing us these wonderful shows to watch and enjoy!,1256515200,4,256,3.7037037037037037
3849822,5,B0025X4PBA,"Loved the shows and the music was the good ol' theme not a muzak cover lol.
I have seasons one and two so bring on the rest. I want the opportunity to have them all.

Love the old commercials in the first season and the intro commentary at the beginning of each episode (optional of course) on both seasons.
Too bad todays shows don't have the same values and morals.

Season three will be the first season of color episodes.

The dog (who never got a name )was actually ""Benji"" of the Benji movies.
There was a moving story on the season 2 dvd (By Linda Kaye Henning)  about how Edgar Buchanan (Uncle Joe)worked with the dog again and wondered if the dog would remember him. As it had been years. The dog did, ran and jumped into his arms. Edgar was very moved by that.",1256083200,6,770,4.2534246575342465

3849824,5,B0025X4PBA,"Petticoat Junction premiered when I was 3 yrs old and growing up this was one of my favorite shows. I remembered when it was cancelled I wrote to CBS and recieved a letter thanking me for writing and supporting the show. It was on some great stationary of the Cannonball and in the smoke was Petticoat Junction. I don't remember seeing the black and white versions so this is a real treat. The black and white versions have never been in syndication and I have to admit I really like Jeannine Riley as Billie Jo. I have no idea why Jeannine Riley and Pat Woodell. The real stars are Bea Benaderet and Edgar Buchannan. And the first appearance of thier dog, who later was the star of the Benji movies. Where the Beverly Hillbillies and later Green Acres has more wild unbelievable humor the laughter here comes mainly from the characters and the situation something that never gets old.
The stories are wonderful and the cast charming and very funny. You cant go wrong with this DVD. I also loved the commentaries from Linda Kaye Henning and Pat Woodell. The only problem I noticed in the commentaries was the editing. The beginnings were cut a little too short.
I highly recommend this DVD!! Thanks for releasing it",1251158400,3,1215,4.6036866359447
3849825,5,B0025X4PBA,"This is a must have series. Since Linda Kaye Henning is the daughter of the creator, Paul Henning she has seen that the show is presented as it originally aired. Seeing both Ms. Henning and Pat Wodell, the original Bobbie Jo was a lot of fun. Most people do not realize there were three Billie Jo's and two Bobbie Jo's. I do not remember why Pat Wodell left but most people remember Lori Saunders as Bobbie Jo. Also Meredith McRae is probably the best remembered Billie Jo since this was the ones shown in syndication and on TV Land. Most of the cast is gone now but their talent lives on. Once the show went to color, Charles Lane was not seen much as Homer Bedloe. Later the show revolved around mainly the love story of Betty Jo and Steve Eliott, Ms Henning's former husband as well as their baby Kathy Jo. Also Henning, McRae and Saunders tried to make an outside act called the Petticoat Junction Girls and went on various talk show like Merv Griffin. Another trivia fact only us older folks remember is there was a third Billie Jo played by Gunilla Hutton. I think she might have been between Jeanne Riley and Meredith McRae. Hutton later was on Hee Haw. I wonder what will be in the future extras since so many of the original cast members are no longer around. I would like to see some of the promos and old interviews.
