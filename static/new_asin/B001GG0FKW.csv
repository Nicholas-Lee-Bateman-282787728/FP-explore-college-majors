8305328,4,B001GG0FKW,"There are two episodes on this DVD as the advertising states, but they are only 48 minutes long each; I don't know where they are getting 140 minutes.  The episode Kung Fu Warrior begins with a segment profiling two Shaolin monks who teach at schools overseen by the temple, followed by a brief segment on the only overseas branch in New York.  Following that is a segment on modern wushu which shows the modern ""official"" stance on Chuan fa in China.  The next segment showcases martial arts actor/director Donny Yuen, and the episode concludes with a profile of MMA fighter Cuong Le.  It is very interesting but nothing outstanding.

The episode Way of the Warrior begins with a profile of Meibukan goju ryu and Uechi ryu karate, which shows numerous training scenes.  Although there are many very brief shots of Okinawan weapons, they are never explained.  The next segment involves another American Ki master and his students demonstrating their ability to take single and multiple blows that are so ineffectual that even a novice would have serious doubts about their credibility.  The next segment concerns Shoto Tanemura and his Genbukan Ninjutsu group, and the final segment profiles Japanese swordsmanship and aikido with the late Kensho Furuya.  I prefer this episode of the two but I am biased in this respect as I train in Okinawan martial arts.

The production values are good although I am unable to ascertain when these were actually made.  It is a good documentary for layman so long as you ignore the section by the Ki master and his dupes (sorry, students).  One thing I will say is that the goju ryu section seems to have been a bit staged, as the teacher seemed to be whaling overly hard on the students and was perhaps showing off for the camera a bit.  It is a nice documentary and I will keep it, and I would recommend it to those with an interest in the martial arts, so long as you don't take everything said on it as gospel.",1262217600,4,1950,4.666666666666667
