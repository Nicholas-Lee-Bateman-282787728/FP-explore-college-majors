4261246,5,B0044LYRL4,TOPPER IS ONE OF THE BEST TV SERIES OF ANY GENERATION. I CAN NEVER GET ENOUGH OF IT AND HAVE BOUGHT IT FOR OTHER'S TO ENJOY. AND IT IS AS CLEAN AS YOU CAN GET. A GREAT STEP BACK TO A BETTER TIME IN THE 50'S.,1333065600,5,207,3.5217391304347827
4261247,5,B0044LYRL4,"I thoroughly enjoy watching the old ""Topper"" shows again.  They are so entertaining, and so mild (ghost-wise) that even a child could watch them and not have nightmares.  These are really fun, and very nostalgic movies.",1329782400,,219,5.055555555555555
4261248,4,B0044LYRL4,"Entertaining. From the TV series. Funny. Amusing enough to watch more than once. If you enjoyed the movie version, you will definetly enjoy this also.",1322179200,3,150,5.04
4261252,3,B0044LYRL4,"Classic old Topper show, difficult to find even on Netflix. The only bad part is the picture quality on this set is about what you'd expect on YouTube or less. Compression artifacts abound, (worse than YouTube in some places) and the contrast is poor. Head switching error at the bottom of the screen. They didn't put much post production time into these DVDs. They needed to be adjusted for contrast and expanded slightly to get rid of the crap on the edges. Still, an historical look into TV around 1953, and that in itself is interesting. Packaging is better than the product inside.",1480204800,4,586,4.699029126213592

4261284,4,B0044LYRL4,"This is a must have for those that lived thought the era. However I was surprised to see so much smoking. Has society change that much that most of the scenes look like one big cigarette commercial? It is hard to see the ghosts through all the smoke.

Although there is a series of Topper movies, this TV series is the Topper I came to know and love. Once in a while I see the actors in other movies and it reminds me of the character he/she played on this movie. Anne Jeffreys as Marion Kerby, can be seen again in the movie ""Boys' Night Out"" (1962) Leo G. Carroll as Cosmo Topper, can be seen again as Rev. Dr. Mosby in ""The Parent Trap"" (1961).

Basic story is that a young fairly modern couple, George and Marion Kerby got caught in an avalanche along with their rescuer St Bernard, Neil. They refused to give up the ghost and went home to live. Turns out that Cosmo toper and his wife Henrietta (Lee Patrick) Bought the Kerby house. Yep now Cosmo can see the Kerby's when they wish and Neil turns out to be a lush. The situation now has its plusses and minuses as everyone becomes one happy family.",1404518400,3,1103,4.247619047619048

4261303,5,B0044LYRL4,"When I was young, I loved this show on Television. I truly thought that the stuff shirt ""man"" of the house"" was very funny and acted the part of Topper very well so when I saw they were available I purchased it. I stil love it. The acting is understated and his reactions to the ""spirits"" are really quite funny. The supporting cast is excellent, as is the script. This is better then the Cary Grant movie (which is enjoyable, just different). If you saw that you will enjoy this. This is not for everyone however as times have changed and I am not sure that all will see and understand the humour in it however it is well worth a try. The video is old however I found the series to be fine to watch.",1365897600,8,700,4.154411764705882
