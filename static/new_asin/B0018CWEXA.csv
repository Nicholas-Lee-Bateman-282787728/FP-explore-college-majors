3415043,5,B0018CWEXA,"Hard to believe what a 2nd season makes. We saw Betty at the end of this season with an ultimatum from Gio & Walter. But first,a quick recap; Wilhelmina felled in love with Bradford Meade-and then she cheated with her bodyguard, Dwayne (Vanessa Williams' Ex-Husband Rick Fox). During the wedding ceremony, Amanda breaks out with her own version of Kelis' ""MilkShake"". Wilhelmina's fiancee suffered a heart attack, collapsed, and then later died. Wilhelmina had another scheme rolled up in her sleeves; she had herself a baby. Then, Amanda performed ""Gene $immons is my Daddy"" for The KISS frontman; Also, Wilhelmina got into an altercation with Betty White: and finally, Wilhelmina had a confrontation with her sister, Renee. (Played by Michael Michele).

There's so much fun you can handle in one hour of Must-See TV. Maybe we should might call this show, ""Ugly Vanessa"".",1220140800,,872,5.0979020979020975

3415046,5,B0018CWEXA,"Warning!  Some spoilers contained in the following review!

All in all, Season Two of UGLY BETTY was, like Season One, an utter delight.  It certainly was not timid in its story telling, trying to keep true to its roots in telemundo by pushing storylines that beggared credibility, sometimes perhaps crossing the lines of believability, but all in all having a lot of fun.

 There were too many plotlines to attempt any summarization, but suffice it to say that if you didn't care for one - and there were some that I definitely didn't care for (primarily Wilhelmina's theft of Bradford Meade's sperm upon his death and then having Christina carry Bradford and Wilhelmina's baby, though secondarily the storyline of having Gene Simmons temporarily feature as Amanda's supposed biological father [like most people I've talked to, I just find anything having to do with Gene Simmons to be more than a little distasteful]) - just wait a week or two and you'd find others you might like instead.  That said, the one arc that extended the length of the season was the two men in Betty's life:  Henry, who she loves and with whom she continues a romance that is fated to end as soon as his ex-girlfriend Charlie gives birth to their child, and Gio, who is deeply attracted to Betty and tries to engage her interest even while she remains with Henry.  Both Christopher Gorham who plays Henry (who I previously loved in JAKE 2.0) and Freddy Rodriguez (who I loved in SIX FEET UNDER) do a great job of making both of their characters really interesting.  I found myself wanting Betty to be happy with both of them, though obviously she could only end up with one.

But to be honest, the real appeal of the show lies less in the story arcs, which while good are not particularly outstanding, than in the fine ensemble cast and the great collection of characters.  I perpetually found myself less than riveted by what was happening than in whom it was happening to.  Ultimately, I think that might be the show's weakness.  With its roots in telemundo, the show has an indelible and inescapable frivolity.  By its very nature, it lacks any potential to become much more than a nice way to pass time.  That being said, it is time that I do enjoy passing.

I am extremely anxious, however, about the show's future.  Season Three is going to feature some absolutely massive changes to the show.  Shortly after filming concluded on Season Two it was announced that the production was going to relocate to New York City.  At the same time it was leaked that Rebecca Romjin, who has been delightful as Daniel's sister/former brother Alexis/Alex, was going to have a greatly lessened involvement in the series in Season Three.  To make matters worse, there were rumors that some actors were unwilling to move to New York full time and might have their character's become less central to the story.  The most worrying of these is Eric Mabius, who has young children and a home in L.A.  After Betty his Daniel Meade is easily one of the most important characters on the show.  Having him on less than a full time basis could significantly change the entire texture of the show, and I suspect not for the better.  Also, while I believe having the show filmed in the actual city where the action is supposed to take place (though I suspect that the neighborhood in which Betty's house is supposed to be located will continue to be CGI) will be a great boon for the show, I fear that the changes could give it a very different feel from the first two seasons.  This could very easily cease to be the show that we've all known and loved.

Fearful or not, I will try to be optimistic.  Hopefully the cast will remain more or less intact with the move to New York.  I will also hope that the producers reconsider the lessened role for Rebecca Romjin and that Eric Mabius stays with the show fulltime.  And I hope that having the possibility of on location shots in New York outweighs any disruption leaving L.A. creates.  Season Two ended, as with Season One, with some major cliffhangers, but this year not all of the anticipation was created by the story.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the show remains as much fun as it has been in the past.",1211587200,21,4224,4.606951871657754
3415047,5,B0018CWEXA,"Ugly Betty was one of the many ABC hits of the 2006/2007 season and charmed audiences with its wit, its new take on the fashion industry, its great design and the simply enjoyable storylines that are admittedly over the top, but TV should entertain and that's exactly what this show does. It doesn't ask you to think a whole lot or focuses on heavy drama, so if you want a serious drama Ugly Betty might not be your cup of tea. Ugly Betty is fun and hilarious, but is not mentally challenging, but this is also part of its charm as it sucks you into its world and you can simply lean back and enjoy.
In the second season the cliffhangers from the phenomenal Season 1 finale were resolved and new storylines introduced that are all truly enjoyable and a pleasure to watch. Everybody goes through changes and especially Betty's love life becomes more and more interesting with a new potential love interest and the ""Henry is the father of Charlie's baby"" storyline.
New characters are introduced and Wilhelmina and Mark are temporarily not working at MODE, but they do eventually come back with a blast that shocks the Meade family.
Hilda also moves on as does Justin and even Amanda gets mores serious moments although she still is one of the biggest comedy factors.
Character development made this season worth watching.
The main reason however why this show got so good this season however is the stellar writing which is some of the best that is currently on network TV. The dialogues are witty, full of creative ideas and fast. Especially Mark is given some of the best one-liners and references as are Justin and Wilhelmina who is the villain you cannot help but love to hate.
It is a shame that the ratings dropped considerably although the show got  consistently better and that due to the writer's strike the season was shortened.
If you already liked the first season, you will definitely love the second and you will enjoy the episodes of one TV's most underrated shows again and again.",1211155200,14,1995,4.667613636363637

3415084,4,B0018CWEXA,"The writing remains lively in the second season of Ugly Betty (2007-08), but what is noticeably different is the growth and maturity of Betty Suarez, as delightfully portrayed by America Ferrera.  Having proven herself invaluable, and demonstrated fierce loyalty to her boss Daniel Meade (Eric Mabius), the editor-in-chief of Mode Magazine, Betty has successfully established herself.  With the loss of some of Betty's naivet, the series doesn't quite have the same innocence and charm, but there is still plenty of excitement and fun, in this stylish prime time soap opera, that blends drama, romance, intrigue, and comedy.  Some huge spoilers follow.

A major story arc, is the romance between Mode's creative editor Wilhelmina Slater (Vanessa Williams), and Daniel's father Bradford Meade (Alan Dale).  Supported by her assistant Marc (Michael Urie), Wilhelmina's scheme to marry Bradford, and gain control the Meade empire almost succeeds, but his unexpected demise, foils her plan.

Ever-resilient, Ms. Slater's next move is also outrageously devious, as she secures some of the deceased Bradford's seed, and convinces Christina (Ashley Jensen) to become the surrogate mother for her child.  When Christina becomes pregnant, Wilhelmina worms her way back into Mode.

Focused on work, and on outwitting Wilhelmina, Daniel spends less time womanizing, although his romance with Wilhelmina's sister Renee (Gabrielle Union), proves to be a life changing experience for both he and Betty.  Daniel's romantic past does catch up with him, and he eventually loses the support of his sister Alexis Meade (Rebecca Romijn).

The sneaky intrigue, is contrasted with Betty's quirky dual romance, with the stiff and practical Henry (Christopher Gorham) from accounting, and the down to earth sandwich maker Gio (Freddy Rodriguez).  It takes some time for things to warm up with Henry, and the appearance of his pregnant girlfriend Charlie (Jayma Mays) further complicates matters.  Gio, who seems to specialize in finding odd ways of squeezing into Betty's life, appears to have much in common with her.  While Betty was prepared to have her heart broken, she did not expect it to be twisted and torn between two very different kinds of men.

Searching for her father, Amanda (Becki Newton) finds Kiss's Gene Simmons, but separated from her partner in crime Marc, she seems a bit lost.  Claire Meade (Judith Light) starts her own magazine, but her role also seems reduced, as is that of her daughter Alexis.  After a tumultuous first season, things are relatively calm for Betty's sister Hilda (Ana Ortiz), nephew Justin (Mark Indelicato), and her father Ignacio (Tony Plana), who mostly concentrates on cooking.

Working a number of grand schemes, Wilhelmina Slater is the driving force in Season Two, as Vanessa Williams truly stands out among the talented ensemble cast.  While the first season dealt with the investigation of murder and featured contract killers, things are a bit less edgy this time.  The program might not be as exciting, or feature as many emotional highs, but Ugly Betty remains fun and enjoyable.  Nearly everyone in the cast is wonderful, and shines when given the opportunity, but for most, time in the spotlight is usually limited.

Notable guest stars include Victoria Beckham, and Betty White.  Topping the bonus material are the featurettes ""Wilhelmina Slater: Love to Hate Her"", and ""On the Set With the Besties"", featuring Becki Newton, and Michael Urie, who are absolutely wonderful together.",1370390400,,3518,5.312274368231047

3415088,3,B0018CWEXA,"I love Ugly Betty. It was one of my favorite shows and still is. However, I can't love this season as much as the others too many things happen that I just don't approve of.
The recycled plot line. Why is it once again that Betty is in a love a triangle? Really. I just don't aprove. And, Christina once again ends up working for Wilhemina even thought she doesn't want to.

Then, there's the distortion of characters. I loved Alexis, but this season she was just a first class b------ and just not funny. I don't know what was going on with Hilda's son, but he also wasn't up to par of last season. Then, Papi gets sent off to Mexico and someone tries to kill him, but everything is perfectly all right when he comes back. What happened? I want to know.

The first episode was also cruel. If you've been waiting for three months the way I had been just to find out that everything wasn't as all right as they made it out to be, then you would understand. Also the disapearance of Yoga made me sad. I knew it had to come, but I loved her. I wish she could come back. One of the highlights of the show.

As a much minor note the season finale was a disapointment (Not that much could top Season One), it was just the accumulation of what Wilhemina wanted and frankly not that surprising. I wasn't as stressed for Season Three. There were also only eighteen episodes instead of twenty four from the first season. Definitely a disapointment you always need more Betty.

On a positive note however, the plot line for Claire Meade, Wilhemina, Amanda, and Mark were all up to par and quite fascinating. By far my favorite parts of the show. I would watch it just for them. Who needs Betty? It's the Wilhemina show.",1362614400,,1708,4.328125

Think of this particular show as a fresh breeze blowing through the dry-as-dust clichd and sterile remains of Broadcast TV-land's vast and derivative wasteland, where every third TV series is a knock-off of two other shows on different channels. I have heard legends of an original idea, spotted years ago in TV-land; a shy and elusive creature - but enough of sarcasm. Back to my original point; which is that I am near to the point of crawling over broken glass just to watch a television show in which the protagonists are not doctors, lawyers or law enforcement personnel. Looking at the broadcast TV line up of late, one might be forgiven for thinking that no one does anything else for a living.

Which is why Ugly Betty is at least refreshing, and double-points to the creators of this show, for wit, and for creating and developing completely endearing and consistent characters, caught in the entirely over-the-top and soap-opera world of high-fashion. It starts with the main character of the heroine; Betty, with her tacky wardrobe, her braces, heavy-framed glasses - a basically decent and competent naf, finding her feet in the cut-throat world of  Mode, a high-end world of a NY fashion magazine. Mode is made-up... but doubtless some of the various details are not. Betty has the backing of her oddly-assorted family, and a handful of friends - and being that this is a translated soap opera - most of the resulting incidents and adventures are wildly over the top. Some of them, nonetheless, manage to be quite touching on their own - the episode of Betty's older sister Hilda in the aftermath of the season-ending death of her almost-sort-of-significant other in a corner-shop robbery was unexpectedly moving.

So - here we have Season Two - just as quirky, with the episodic plots just as unexpected and unpredictable as in Season One; as rich a treat as an assorted Godiva chocolates in one of those impossibly lavish boxes. One of the inserts in the ""second season"" box is an episode guide, disguised as a suitably worn and dog-eared subway map of New York City (and environs) placing the locations of many key episodes and the various residences of key characters.

Of the extra features included, the most entertaining are a guide to the various sets, conducted by two of the bitchiest characters (in an admittedly hard-fought contest) and a complete collection of the Spanish-language telenovelas which have been part of the background, all the way along. These are presented in all their over-the-top glory. Really, the amusement value of the episode in which a character exclaims ""Freeze or the snake gets it!"" is alone almost worth the price of the entire set.",1243900800,,2997,4.91699604743083

The packaging was great they fit a whole bunch of other movies on the cover pamphlets...Awesome marketing strategy.

3415118,5,B0018CWEXA,"A one of a kind series, Ugly Betty, brings to the screen the parallel stories of a group of people working at a New York City women's fashion magazine.
Season 2 adds a lot more depth and character development making it even better (if that could ever be possible) than the first season.
America Ferrera, Eric Mabius, Rebecca Romijn, Vanessa Williams, Michael Urie, Becki Newton, Tony Plana, Ana Ortiz, Mark Indelicato, Ashley Jensen, Christopher Gorham, Judith Light, and the rest of this EXTRAORDINARY cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least. All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the series is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, not to mention a few tears. The plot has elements of both comedy and drama making it rather difficult to label it as one or the other; it is actually a bit of both. Ugly Betty does a great job of describing people's different personalities, fears, and the problems they face. It is all about human relations, hope, and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.
The acting, the setting, the plot (and subplots), the dialogues, and the music, which are just wonderful! It is indeed a rarity when an amazing series such as this comes by.
In short, Ugly Betty is a series definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't done so already)!  KEEP'EM COMING!!!",1225756800,,1573,4.913533834586466

8269444,5,B0018CWEXA,"Ugly Betty is a rather light-hearted portrayal of struggling immigrant family in New York.  The serial was written on the basis of an Columbian tele-novella called Yo Soy Betty La Fea.  And Betty is the most average of American girls sporting big dreams of working her way into success.  That fortune tenders her a job opening within the Meade Publications empire, at their flagship magazine ""Mode.""  As Betty weaves her way through the cut-throat culture in the fashion promotion  industry she skillfully juggles her way through a complex fruit-basket of professional, inter-personal, and romantic entanglements.

Bravo for the believable family settings, cranky neighbors and Meade dynasty turmoil.  America Ferrera as Betty is simply inspiring.  Her romantic conflicts are every bit as engaging as Downton Abbey.  And that's saying a lot about a serial that's special enough to communicate with older and younger generations.",1474070400,,928,5.433566433566433

But, as I watched the show you just fall in love with Betty and Daniel.  They're real people struggling to make it, Daniel wealthy but with addiction issues and Betty's family poor, but with honor and dignity.
