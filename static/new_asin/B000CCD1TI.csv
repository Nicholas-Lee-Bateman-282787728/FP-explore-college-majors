8097029,5,B000CCD1TI,"My 6 month old daughter will watch this video in its entirety without a peep. We don't have her watch any television so I was skeptical on putting the video on for her to watch. It's positive message, colorful and slow moving puppets were just perfect to keep her interest.",1365724800,,273,4.48
8097030,5,B000CCD1TI,My three month old son goes nuts for this DVD but started to love it as early as 1 month.  He laughs and kicks his legs during the entire show.  He loves it much better then baby einstien DVD's.  I highly recommend this!,1212364800,,220,4.069767441860465
8097031,5,B000CCD1TI,Bought this for my daughters 1 year birthday. She loves this video. She sits through the whole thing from start to end. Her favorite is the puppets she laughs every time the bell rings and Moses hair messes up. We were to the point we had to get the other vidoes. What a great way to introduce your baby to bible stories. Can't say enough good about these vidoes. I even buy for my friends with babies. Great for baby showers.,1170201600,4,426,4.271604938271605
