It's well crafted with a sweet storyline that has a lot of dramatic elements unique to any anime other than shonen anime.

The animation quality and artwork is pretty simplistic, but it remains appealing and the frames don't lag a bit-regardless of  Studio APPP's small budget.

The music itself was done by Kenji Kawai, the same man who composed for the Ghost in the Shell soundtrack. However Kurogane Communication's music differs from that of Ghost in the Shell's. The music ranges from vast ranges whether it is relaxing, nostalgic, melodramatic, tensioning, etc; this shows that the composer is well rounded in his arrangement style.

The English voices could have been better, but I guess it was ok at the time it was dubbed. The Japanese voice actors really made their characters stand out-especially Yui Horie who is a J-pop artist.

The thing that amuses me is that the characters resemble other popular anime characters (i.e. Haruka resembling Asuka Langley Soryu from Neon Genesis Evangelion, Angela resembling Motoko Kusanagi from Ghost in the Shell, etc). There comes times when the humor is a little generic for anime (i.e. Spike and Trigger acting childish, Spike accidentally running into Haruka while in the shower or undressing), but it's very excusable since it is not overused; in fact it's used in the right amount. There is also minor fan service, but that too is excusable. All the elements I addressed was what lead the story smoothly to a solid finish. It's easy to say that I wish I've watched this when I was a kid, which is why I say Kurogane Communication is one of the best animes I've watched in a long time.",1362873600,,1810,4.807073954983923
7954383,5,B00005U11U,"The plot of this series is rather simple - a world that has been destroyed by a world war, leaving only a single human survivor.  She is a young teen that is protected and raised by a family of robots that try to take care of her physical and emotional needs.

My 11 yr. old daughter fell in love with this DVD and has told all of her friends about it.  When they come over our house to watch the DVD, they all go home asking their parents to go online and buy one at Amazon.com.

There are 8 episodes and even though the plots are simple, the combination of dialogue and character development is touching.  It is hard not to like what you are seeing and hearing since the graphics are well done and the writers actually put some thought into the conversations that are exchanged between the robots and Haruka - the last human on Earth.

If you have a girl in the 10-12ish range and she likes science fiction anime, this is a DVD series that you should not pass up!",1239321600,,965,4.217391304347826

7954385,4,B00005U11U,The story is a girl who is the last human on earth after WWIII.Robots help her live and other robots try to kill her. The story has obstacles that the girl needs to go through. Great movie.,1223510400,,189,4.135135135135135
7954386,4,B00005U11U,"This is a little known science fiction series that has ""cutsey"" robot designs-but don't let that fool you. The characters are pretty well developed, the story is well done-there are some maudlin moments and some holes in the plotline, but at the end (which comes rather quickley because although there are 24 episodes they are only 10 minutes long) it kinda throws you a curve ball. Definetly worth your time to watch.",1198627200,,418,4.819444444444445
7954387,5,B00005U11U,"I am really happy with this product. I liked it enough to buy the box set for myself. The plot line leads up to a great ending, and it is a great show for any anime fan. People who like a softer, happier anime like Fruits Basket will like Kurogane Communication.",1167868800,,262,4.1568627450980395
7954388,4,B00005U11U,"I can't say what it is about this show that made me enjoy watching it as much as I did, but I certainly did. First of all, Kanato is an amazing character. Not only is he cool-looking but he's got an intriguing personality and, unlike Haruka, an interesting flashback story to his youth. Beyond him alone however, the show really is just different. The episodes are short at fifteen minutes max each, but when I sat down to watch long marathons of episodes it felt good to power through the series at a good pace. The plot pacing itself is also worth investigating; Kanato doesn't even enter the show until the middle third or so after Haruka and her robot family escape the threat of a tsunami on their debris-filled city home setting. Leaving all that behind, the band sets off to hopefully find more humans for Haruka. They will find Kanato, for sure, but a lot more too along the way. The plot moves at it's own pace (somewhat inconsistent, but oddly beneficial in that what's important to the show gets extra focus time), the animation quality is satisfactory, the dubbing wasn't a problem (heads up to those who are hard-pressed sub fans though), and the overall feeling upon finishing the series is simply content and thoughtful. For fans of obscure anime, this is definitely worth looking into.",1137888000,6,1301,4.685589519650655
