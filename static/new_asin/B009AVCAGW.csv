5311038,5,B009AVCAGW,"Great heart warming movie with a positive life lesson, consider others in our life choices. The way we think, the things we say, the decisions we make, and what we do has both positive and negative outcomes. Putting others first will ultimately bring forth a better life for us and for others. The movie makes good use of the 'Golden Rule'. Though the movie is very clean, I would not recommend this for little kids because some of the situations have a more adult tone to them. Lastly, why they changed the name to '12 Christmas Wishes for My Dog' is odd. This had to be another one of those 'corporate decisions' to sell a few more DVDs and rentals. The movie revolves more around people then one dog. Still this is an excellent movie and worth your time and money.",1387929600,,767,4.446808510638298
5311039,4,B009AVCAGW,This was a great family movie but we didn't think the title matched. She really could have wished for her dog to be allowed to live with her.,1386374400,,141,4.071428571428571

5311041,4,B009AVCAGW,"A movie for the Gals (but, I watched it).  It was kinda' cute, though it had a simple plot that was pretty predictable.  But, you know what, it was refreshing when compared to some of the other trash that comes out of the various studios.  If you want to watch a  movie without violence, profanity, nudity, etc., you might enjoy this one.  It is not a kids movie.  The cover led me to believe it was another doggie movie for the kids--wrong.",1374105600,,441,4.317073170731708
5311042,5,B009AVCAGW,"Solid storyline with a good lesson of life.  How we all wish for something better, not knowing that what we already have is maybe all we really need.",1360713600,3,149,4.321428571428571

5311044,5,B009AVCAGW,"This is the same movie that is called ""12 Wishes of Christmas"".
Chondra Pierce is very funny as the life coach. It is a
wonderful Christmas movie with a message and was awarded 5 Dove awards.",1356048000,6,191,4.333333333333333
5311045,5,B009AVCAGW,"Lighthearted, delightful family movie with great message for everyone - be careful what you wish for! Yes, you will be guessing the plot as you go along, but we need that kind of fun nowadays!",1355961600,2,192,4.514285714285714

5311067,5,B009AVCAGW,"I was expecting a cheesy over-done Christmas story. Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised!! I LOVED how she fixed her wishes & the moral of the  story at the end. Awesome. I am going to watch it again with my kids...I rarely ever find a movie that I am excited to watch with them :-) The only little thing that could have been better is if the women's clothing were more modest. Don't let the name fool you...not a movie about dogs, really.",1451520000,,441,4.378048780487805
5311068,4,B009AVCAGW,"Also known as 12 Wishes of Christmas - a very cute, family-friendly Christmas movie that you can probably catch on the ION channel in December.

This is actually one of my favorite holiday romance movies (like the Hallmark movies), mainly because I really like the actors and because it has a great message. The plot is simple and predictable - after losing her job and realizing she's stuck in a dead-end relationship, Laura Lindsey (Elisa Donovan) visits a life coach for advice and is given 12 wishes to try and fix her life. Her wishes come true, but of course her wishes have unintended consequences (""didn't you read the fine print?""). After her last well-intentioned wish backfires, her life's still a wreck - she's alienated her best friend, gotten her neighbor evicted, and cost her boss a much-needed job. The charm in this movie is how it all plays out as Laura finds a way to undo the harm her wishes have caused - and of course bring everyone together for the holiday.

Not sure why they renamed this ""12 Christmas Wishes for My Dog"" for the U.S. dvd release, since the movie really has nothing to do with her dog. You'd think Laura's first wish would have been to get her dog back (which she was forced to give up or face eviction), but after she drops the dog off at the shelter it's pretty much forgotten. But that's a minor point - it all works out in the end, lol.

Overall this is one of the better holiday romance movies that get recycled every holiday season. It's very charming, and even though it's silly, for some reason it's one of my favorites. If you like movies like A Christmas Kiss and A Golden Christmas, then odds are you'll like this one as well.",1448841600,2,1679,4.498360655737705
5311069,5,B009AVCAGW,"This is one of MY ALL TIME FAVORITES!!!!!!!!!!  I love Elisa Donovan. She has ALWAYS been 1 of favorites. Also, the grandkids get a kick out of this movie too. Wishing they could get a 'magic' elf lady!!!  hahahaha  No such luck.
This movie has EVERYTHING in it. Tears, lots of laughter, & everything in between. Very well made. Hope she makes more Christmas movies. Like ""Eves Christmas"" which is also FANTASTIC.",1442620800,2,413,4.708333333333333
5311070,4,B009AVCAGW,I think the title to this movie needs to be changed to just 12 Christmas Wishes.  The wishes weren't for the dog.,1427328000,,113,4.136363636363637
5311071,5,B009AVCAGW,This is a movie to watch every Christmas - and tons of times in between.  I loved it.,1427068800,,85,3.7222222222222223

5311091,4,B009AVCAGW,"I almost loved this movie, but I was able to take a nap during the middle of the movie.

I watched the first half-hour and the last fifteen minutes, but listened to much of the middle while I napped in the same room as the loudly playing TV set. I did not feel that I needed to go back to watch the middle, even if I could have done so (it was on an HDTV channel, which I wasn't recording, so I had no choice). Next Christmas, however, if I see it listed on THIS TV or another HDTV channel, I'll watch it again, and maybe change my rating to five stars at that time.

CAVEAT EMPTOR: Do not buy this DVD unless you are sure that your DVD player or BluRay player will play ""Region 4"" DVDs. This DVD was produced for the Australian market, and can be played in the U.S.A. if you have the correct hardware, such as a player that plays all regions.

Without realizing it (at first), our leading character meets an angel who decides to grant her 12 wishes, which she is able to request by visiting a web page. By the time our female lead realizes that there is more to her ""angel"" than the woman she appears to be, the ""office"" is empty, and nobody knows where to find her.

Each of her wishes come true, but at first, she's just asking for things that most people might ask for, flowers, money, etc. Eventually, however, she realizes that her life would be much better if she used her wishes to improve her life.

I will watch this movie again when I can. It was fun.",1419292800,,1462,4.151943462897527

5311115,5,B009AVCAGW,"I love this movie because it involves the heart of Christmas, both ends of the spectrum;  It stars Elisa Donovan, who wants to get all of her own wishes, without thought of how that would impact not only her friends, but her own life. After realizing that getting all she wanted actually messed up her life, she understands that giving is the true gift of Christmas, of life really. It's a little sappy, as most Christmas movies are, but isn't that why we watch them? The true heart of Christmas is the real theme here, and I love that. Also, Ashley the dog is adorable.",1388016000,,570,4.428571428571429
