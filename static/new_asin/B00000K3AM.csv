1240442,5,B00000K3AM,Steven Spielbergs masterpiece stands the test of time as the greatest war movie ever made and its never looked better. Its shows war at its most brutal and heartbreaking worst as well as the hallmarks of the WW2 soldier. Honor Integrity Selfless Devotion to duty and most of all Humbleness. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED and FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY,1525737600,2,336,4.810344827586207
1240443,5,B00000K3AM,I use an OPPO 203 with a Sony A8F tv and the 4K release is extraordinarily better than the regular Blu-ray release.

1240467,4,B00000K3AM,"Saving Private Ryan is perhaps Steven Spielberg's most beloved war film ever. He painstakingly recreates D-Day on the beaches of Normany. It's beautiful and horrifying simultaneously. I think the direction is by far the best aspect of Saving Private Ryan. It's stream lined as you get to follow a company searching for the last son in a larger family that was all killed in World War II. It's a nice story that reels in audiences everywhere. It's about family and the cost of war. WWII truly feels senseless during the sequences of mortar fire, tank battles, and endless crossfire in a furious hail of bullets. Saving Private Ryan's greatest accomplishment is making you understand the value of life. It's worth watching as a testament to those who died during WWII. It touches you in ways you'll find hard to describe.

Having said all of that praise, Saving Private Ryan is also trying to pull at your heart strings. At times I found the emotional scenes to be a tad contrived. It feels genuine through the sincerity with which Tom Hanks plays the squad leader, but Saving Private Ryan gets bogged down with the melodramatic acting of Matt Damon. I just never buy Damon as the character because he's playing Ryan so selfishly and basically. The rest of the supporting cast is much stronger both in character development and performances.

Overall, Saving Private Ryan is still one of the must see war films in cinema history. You'll be stunned at the scope of the D-Day invasion and humbled at Hank's acting and empathy. Give it a watch.",1522454400,,1539,4.7819548872180455

1240477,5,B00000K3AM,"The movie Saving Private Ryan, starring Tom Hanks and Matt Damon, is unlike any other war movie of its time. The film won Best Motion Picture and Best Director at the 1999 Golden Globes. It also won five Oscars including Best Director and Best Cinematography. The director, Steven Spielberg, has won 183 awards and directed many popular movies such as Jaws, ET, Jurassic Park, and Schindlers List.
  I feel like the plot succeeds by having a captivating start, beginning with an intense and gruesome re-creation of one of the bloodiest battles of history (D-Day). After that, the plot begins with Captain Miller being tasked to save and bring home the last living child (Private James Ryan) out of four brothers, three of which died in the past week in the war. Private James Francis Ryan could be anywhere in France, due to a misjump of the paratrooper squad he is in. It is an impossible mission which I found to be very intriguing. A soldier even calls the mission finding a needle in a haystack of needles.  A way the plot fails is it established that it would be extremely difficult to find Private Ryan, and yet they manage to stumble upon him at random.
  The acting seemed very authentic. I cared and got attached to the characters and it affected me when they died. A death that affected me a lot was when the medic dies. He saves so many people, but when he gets shot, no one knows how to save him. I think the cinematography was stunning. Some of the camerawork was shaky on purpose to make it seem more chaotic and intense. It makes it seem like you are really in the war. A particular shot that caught my attention is shortly after the invasion of Normandy, and the camera shows Omaha beach with countless bodies strewn upon the sand and in the water. What particularly caught my attention is the waves are red with blood. This shot in particularly made me realize how many casualties there actually are.
  I would rate this film 9/10 stars. The film made me feel like I was really in France in World War II in a way Call of Duty does not. The acting was superb and authentic and I became very attached to the characters. The camerawork and special effects really added to the realism of the film without becoming too distracting. The plot had its strong and weak parts but the strong points outnumbered the weak. The movie was just shy of three hours, yet it kept my attention the entire film. I would highly recommend Saving Private Ryan to teenagers and adults as it is rated R and there is a ton of gruesome violence and excessive language. Saving Private Ryan is a powerful experience to watch and will leave you with something to think about.",1520812800,,2661,4.53125
1240478,5,B00000K3AM,"My father crossed over with the 4th Division to Utah Beach, and he said this film captures the best portrayal of D-Day than any other film.  Although he survived this horrific event, he later stepped on a landmine, losing his right leg below the knee, in the Huertgen Forest.  He spent two years in Walter Reed Hospital; yet, he considered the Army years to be among the best years of his life.  Can you imagine that?  He died in 2008 at age 92.  When he saw this film, it brought tears to his eyes, and when I saw the film, I wondered how anyone could have survived the onslaught.  Saving Private Ryan is truly one of the best World War II films!",1520812800,18,647,4.262295081967213

1240494,4,B00000K3AM,"This is as good of a movie as I have seen about WWII.  Opening in modern times.  And then going in flash back to the Normandy invasion.  You at least get a feeling of what it must have been to storm those beaches.  The story is about a group of men after they survive the initial invasion.  Are assigned to find  a man who has had three brothers killed in combat.  And  bring him home.  The movie was up for a bunch of awards.  And should have won best picture,  And would probably win best picture every year no matter what else it was up against.  It is realistic and powerful and will stay with you.  As I said it opens in modern times and it ends in modern times with an image that is not easily forgotten.  As is this entire movie.",1517788800,,736,4.055944055944056

1240573,5,B00000K3AM,"Last week I watched Saving Private Ryan for perhaps the twentieth time since I first saw it in a theater back in 1998. Saving Private Ryan has always ranked at the very top of my overall Top 10 list of favorite war movies.

Directed by Steven Spielberg, written by Robert Rodat,  and starring Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Jeremy Upton, Edward Burns, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, and others, Saving Private Ryan, is a tale about World War II. As the film opens, it is present-day, and an old man is seen walking through a military cemetery. He is searching for a specific grave. His family is with him. He finds the grave, and tearfully remembers a terrible, war-torn day from decades past:  D-Day, June 6, 1944

On that day, the Allies have begun landing on the beaches in Normandy, France. Among those landing on Omaha Beach is a U.S. Army Ranger Captain named John Miller and his platoon of soldiers. After withstanding  withering enemy fire at the beachhead, Miller and his men finally break through fierce and stubborn Nazi resistance. Soon afterward, they receive a new and dangerous special assignment. They must traverse enemy held territory, locate Private James Ryan somewhere behind enemy lines, notify him that all three of his brothers have been killed in action, and bring him off the battlefield, so he can return home to his grieving mother

Saving Private Ryan features a tense, exciting, and surprisingly moving story. It begins and ends with two of the most violent and bloody battle scenes I have ever seen in a movie, and probably the most realistic. Yet, Saving Private Ryan is not just an overly simplistic action story about good GI's fighting bad Nazis. Screenwriter Robert Rodats beautifully drawn characters are all very human, with strengths and human frailties in equal measure. They dare to ask the question: why are we doing this? Somehow, they may be able to make a modicum of sense of why they are in the war, but this specific mission that they're now on remains incomprehensible to them. Yet they continue on, and they fight, and some of them die, so that one man can return in safety to his family

I have watched many war films over the years, some good and some bad. Without question, Saving Private Ryan is the very best war film I have ever seen. It easily earns my highest recommendation.",1495238400,,2324,4.751861042183623

Even though this movie might be hated by some for being too gory, I think it did the movie well and this also helped people realize the pain and stress these soldiers had to go through. Aside form the action we also get to see that these men were not completely fearless showing them even crying at some points. This helps ease down the movie from being just action and no heart so I give this movie 5 stars!",1494288000,10,517,4.18

1240594,5,B00000K3AM,"""Saving Private Ryan"" is Spieberg and Hanks at their best. It is a story grounded in the Normandy Invasion, and loosely based on a factual multi-sibling situation. The opening scene places you in one of the landing craft with 2nd Battalion Army Rangers which hits Omaha Beach, and gives you a peek at the hell that war is. After the US soldiers take the beachhead, Capt. Miller (Hanks) is sent with a small contingent to find a member of the 101st Airborne, whereabouts unknown, because all his brothers have been killed. The realism is breathtaking, and is non-stop suspense as they seek to perform their mission. The ending is heartbreaking, and the camera work is superb. My Dad landed at Omaha on D+1, so it had a special significance for me; he said very little about Omaha, and now I know why. My son watched with me, and he said not a word. In fact, he shook his head slightly as the film ended.",1490140800,11,902,4.5060975609756095

Blu-Ray was not good. I must have gotten the recall vision. It looked just like the photo someone posted from 2010 on this same review, they posted that 7 years old and Amazon still continues to sell this version! Mostly the wars scenes had a terrible view.

1240657,5,B00000K3AM,"Saving Private Ryan was instantly an epic masterpiece when it came out. The Normandy scenes were disturbing, and they should have been. I think too often old-time Hollywood tried to paint a rosy picture of battle scenes where only the bad guys die and the good guys hardly get dirty or mess up their hair. War is gruesome and this movie captures the agony with as much detail as I could comfortably bear without triggering a need for critical stress debriefing. The story line is heartfelt. In an era where individualism is rampant, here is a story where a few men risk everything for the sake of a stranger...and pay the ultimate sacrifice in valor to send him home safely. Mission accomplished. I bought this film because it is one of the best in its class. I watch this along with Das Boot, Platoon, Blackhawk Down, Fury, We Were Soldiers, Enemy at the Gate, Tora Tora Tora, and I plan to add Hacksaw Ridge to that list when it comes out.",1482019200,,941,4.508771929824562

1240688,4,B00000K3AM,"This is a review of the Sapphire edition, not a critique of the movie.

The sapphire blu is the ONLY edition that contains DTS Master Audio HD 5.1. The others are either DD surround or DTS surround. If your system is capable of the DTS MA format then bite the bullet and fork up the few extra bucks. The difference in sound is well worth it. The video is high quality blu. I saw no difference in video quality between this blu edition and the others. Some of the reviews complained of low quality ""grainy"" picture in some of the scenes. Yeah ... the ""grain"" is intentional in the movie to add realism (opening beach landing scene).
I burn my movies to my PC hdd. I usually obtain movies via Netflix rental but this one was worth purchasing ""used"" from a non-Amazon source.
I docked one star because of the extra bucks I was forced to dole out just for the higher quality audio. In most movies the DTS MA or DD Tru audio is included at no extra cost.

I hope this review helps with the decision making:)",1477180800,,1002,4.296296296296297

This movie got a lot of flack upon its release for being too violent, and the violence is disturbingly realistic even to today's standards. However, the case needs to be made that realistic is what this subject matter requires. The deaths are hard to watch, and they happen all too often, but such is war.

Spielberg is a genius and this movie is another one of his great accomplishments.

1240739,4,B00000K3AM,"This is obviously an iconic movie.  The portrayal of the landing on D Day was one of the best sequences I have ever seen.  That sequence compares very favorably to the sequence in the movie ""The Longest Day"".

There is one scene of close quarter combat later in the movie, to the death, that haunted me personally.  I am quite aware that is a sign of great art.  It reminded me of the near murder scene in ""Dial M for Murder"", directed by Albert Hitchcock.  I suppose since Grace Kelly's character survives that onslaught it bothered me less.  I am guessing the reaction I felt is the way I would have felt if Grace Kelly's character would have been slowly stabbed to death while I watched.

I feel the movie is another tribute to the ""greatest generation"".  This tribute, they deserve.  There is a fine line between rendering this tribute and glorifying war.  I hope that line was not crossed.

This was certainly another time.  The movie is fiction.  The thought of school teachers commanding Ranger Teams seems unthinkable to me now.  That may not have literally happened.  I really do not know.  But there is no doubt regular, everyday people were torn from their lives and sent off to places they never heard of to fight and die.  There has to be a better way.

1240779,3,B00000K3AM,"No one's supposed to say anything bad about 1998's ""Saving Private Ryan"" (SPR). To do so is considered sacrilege, but I have to be honest about what I like and don't like about Spielberg's popular film on the Normandy invasion and its immediate aftermath.

The initial beach landing (shot at Curracloe Beach, Ballinesker, Ireland) is outstanding but, after that, I didn't find the movie all that engaging or convincing. The characters never struck me as real. I've seen the film twice and both times I was too often conscious of the fact that I was watching actors portraying WWII characters in a film. When you see a truly great picture, by contrast, you completely forget you're watching a movie (e.g. the original ""Apocalypse Now"").

Moreover, too many of the situations in SPR (including dialogue) simply struck me as annoyingly treacly. Exhibit A is the moronic dog-tag sequence, which was supposed to be emotionally stirring but just made you roll your eyes and groan.

But, like I said, no one can criticize SPR and get away with it, even if the criticism is legitimate. It's like you'll be accused of being unAmerican or something (which is far from the case with me since I love America; I just can't stand the corrupt government & politicians, particularly the loony Demoncraps).

In light of my criticisms, I simply don't get why so many praise SPR as ""the greatest war movie ever made."" Again, the opening half hour is great but the rest leaves a lot to be desired, which is the bulk of the picture. I've heard the movie hailed on the grounds that much of it was taken ""verbatim from first-hand, eye-witness accounts of the real Normandy invasion."" I'll take their word for it, but this isn't what I object to. I object to the contrived, treacly way Spielberg depicted the events and the fact that I was unable to buy the characters as real. The roll-your-eyes dog-tag sequence is just one obvious example.

The plot is a bit thin, and the story has less to do with saving private Ryan and more to do with a few occurrences of a small band of soldiers.

The movie manages to convey the nobility of the soldiers it follows, while keeping them all too human, while showing how terrible war itself is.  Aside from all of that, it has a terrific story, top notch acting, and probably the best production values and quality of any war movie ever made.  I have no idea how they filmed much of this, but it was amazing.",1465776000,,463,4.75

1240834,5,B00000K3AM,"This movie is one of our favorites!  I don't know how many times we have watched it, but I am sure that this latest time will not be the last.  I cry at least once during every viewing of this film.  The acting is phenomenal and the story is so heartbreaking.

Every time I watch this movie I feel the sadness when I lose a character that I have come to love.  All of the actors are so amazing in their roles.  They couldn't have done a better job with that in this movie.
If you haven't seen it, I can tell you... there are those you will come to love and those you will come to hate.  The story line and the acting pulls you in so completely.  This movie shows you a truth about that time period that most, in today's existence, couldn't even begin to understand.  There is a such a closeness and a bond created in these tense situations that we can only experience though a movie.  When that movie is created, put together, and acted in as well as this one is, the experience is so much more real and intense.

Whether or not you are a fan of war type movies, the acting and characters in this one will take you away to another life and leave you feeling emotionally full.",1465171200,9,1175,4.13215859030837

1240956,5,B00000K3AM,"Steven Spielbergs Saving Private Ryan is a film that is illustrated with such magnificent detail that it helps grasp your attention right from the beginning and doesnt let go until the credits start to roll. The hard work and dedication put in by the director, cinematographer, and actors in this film will make you leave the theater completely enthralled with tear-stained cheeks and puffy eyes.
This film is set during World War II, particularly the Invasion of Normandy. As four brothers of the Ryan family enter the war their mother receives the news that three of them have died right at the start. Devastated at her loss, she sends orders to have them find her fourth son. This leads into the whole mission of the movie which is to find Private First Class James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon) and bring him home.
Tom Hanks is known for his work in dramas so it was no surprise that he was the perfect fit to play the leading role as Captain John H. Miller. He takes it above and beyond when he allows his voice to tremble and even get this glassy look in his eye as if he was experiencing war first hand. He plays the leader that everyone looks to when they are in desperate need for direction but he also portrays the man whose hands tremble due to the effect of war which makes him that much more fascinating to watch.
Another character that catches your eye is that of Private Richard Reiben, played by Edward Burns. Burns portrays a new new demeanor never seen by him before as he is not known for his acting in epic war dramas but comedies. Throughout the film, he is seen yelling into mens faces and giving off facial expressions that makes him look arrogant but then becomes soft as he realizes he cant do anything else to save Captain Miller. Seeing Burns play such a new role gives him that much more credibility and respect for his acting career.
 The credit of this film should go not solely to the actors, but to director Steven Spielberg and cinematographer Janusz Kamiski who display so many different perspectives and angles that pull the film together. For example, when they show the death of Captain Miller they use an angle that shows who shoots him and him getting shot, pulling together the commotion of war and show his men avenging his death. They also took real footage from what actually happened during WWII and copied almost exactly how they saw it. By knowing that you just witnessed what actually happened in history makes the film that much more alluring than it already is.
Considering the film starts off with a very graphic 27-minute battle scene at Omaha Beach, it sets the expectation that the rest of the movie would not be a waste of ones time. The reality of the film is one that needs to be rewarded due to the accuracy of the little details. Some of these details are the boats that replicated the ones used during WWII, the blood they used to completely engulf the water, and the scene which shows soldiers trying to find their severed limbs. Spielberg did not sugarcoat the harsh realities of war but instead used it to capture the audiences attention.
Spielberg has definitely outdone himself in this film. It teaches one about American history but also one about honor and sacrifice. Through the agony and the loss, it is a film that will be shown to people for centuries to come.",1456185600,,3326,4.580536912751678

It really brings to life to atrocities of ww2 and if more films were shown like this I think this world would realize the sacrifice that continues to be made. People think we bought this land on blood in 1776. But the only way to purchase Freedom is through blood shed. Ever so many years people forget how much the cost of Freedom is. They forget that blood is more valuable than gold and to have peace you must have war. It isn't possible. As long as there is evil in the world this is a reality we face. I hope not in mine or my children's lifetime do we need to be reminded by more bloodshed that Freedom cost the blood of a million men but it won't be long till our bill is due.,1453507200,2,794,4.031645569620253

1241036,5,B00000K3AM,"This movie, set primarily in Europe, 1944, captivates its audience right from the start. In the opening minutes of the movie, I watched the D-Day of Normandy unfold in an intense, graphic manner. Having been called ""The rawest, most sustained screen portrayal of 20th century combat,"" (USA Today), I was excited to see what lay ahead. Throughout the film, I followed Captain John Miller, played by decorated actor Tom Hanks, in his mission to find Private James Ryan, played by Matt Damon. Despite the oddity in the United States Armed Forces ordering Captain Miller to rescue Private Ryan, at the time recently Missing In Action, from the front lines in France, it set a wonderful stage and story for the characters that joined Captain Miller.

As the story unfolds, I saw the bond between Captain Miller and his team of men strengthen tremendously as they roamed France in desperate search of Private Ryan. Not only do the men grow as soldiers, but also as brothers, as most men in the military are known to do. Award-winning director Steven Spielberg portrays this phenomenally.

When Miller and his squadron find Ryan, Ryan convinces them to help nobly defend the last standing bridge in a French town that would aid in the Allied advancement into Germany. The soldiers again bond and prepare for the fight of their lives, knowing the vast majority of them will not survive. Spielberg could not have done a more perfect job in showing the strength the men's bond and trust in each other, how much they were willing to give up for each other, how strongly they believed in one another, and how valiantly they fought alongside each other.

To simply put it, Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece, put together with an intense, captivating story, superb details, graphic action, and dedicated, talented actors. Without a doubt, this is his best movie made to date, and potentially on of the best films of all time.",1448150400,,1916,4.871165644171779

At times is makes you yell at the device; hoping they will hear you and do what you tell them, and there are times where you hang with your mouth open at how realistically graphic it is. There are times where it can force tears out of a fully grown man, or make you cower back in your chair. When it ended, I was amazed how much actually seeing the tragic incident with your own eyes can be SO much more moving than reading a article about it. On a article, you read a fact like 5,000 people died there. Then you see 20 deaths that are as bad as they are in real life and it really hits you how much suffering these people must have been through. You feel sad for people who die in the movie, but if you imagine being there family, or being their commander, and feeling the guilt of commanding someone to a death as tragic as that, or even being that person! All in all, this movie really makes you appreciate veterans. Perfect for veterans day!

As I watched the movie, the few stories both of my grandfathers told suddenly became real to me. At the end, when the flag silently flutters in the breeze I recall seeing many in the theater sitting silently, some crying. Several old men in the theater stood and saluted the flag with tears in their eyes. Despite the reviews of those who chose to nitpick the characters and cinematography, this movie touched those men who were standing there with tears streaming in a way that transcended opinions about character development. I have served for the past 12 years in the US Army and have fought in Iraq. I have seen the horror of war first hand. There is no possible way to convey the reality of the chaos and brutality with a camera to those who have not been there. This movie is as close as it gets. Our grandparents sacrificed their youth and innocence to defend the world from an unspeakable horror. The same can be said of the current generation. Setting aside talk of oil and politics, young men and women stand in the gap just as they did back then because of an idea that is freedom. My only hope is that those who have opted to stay in their warm safe places ""earn it"" by living the best that they can. This move brings home the fact that every life is worth fighting for. It also is a statement that our freedom comes at a price that has been willingly paid by countless men and women. Very few movies stand out as landmarks in my mind. This one exceeds that. It changed the way I viewed my grandfathers forever. Climb to Glory! 10th Mtn!",1441497600,,1699,4.345911949685535
1241111,5,B00000K3AM,"Saving Private Ryan is a 1998 American epic war drama film set during the Invasion of Normandy in World War II. Directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Robert Rodat, the film is notable for its graphic and realistic portrayal of war, and for the intensity of its opening 27 minutes, which depict the Omaha Beach assault of June 6, 1944. It follows United States Army Rangers Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) and a squad (Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg, and Jeremy Davies) as they search for a paratrooper, Private First Class James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), who is the last-surviving brother of four servicemen.

1241123,5,B00000K3AM,"The reason I bought the Blu-ray version of Saving Private Ryan is because the editors at C-Net raved about how much it improved over the DVD release. They weren't just kidding. Spielberg and DP Kaminski opted for hand-held camera motion and very faint film grain--no doubt to give the film a journalistic look--but sharpness and color look fantastic. Close-ups of actors' faces look especially good. You can see all the wrinkles and grime and sweat in their expressions--as well as the sadness beneath.

The improvement in sound quality surpasses the improvements in picture quality. Battles and gunfights sound like they're happening all around you, not just in front of you. Volume ranges are properly judged. Louds really grab you without melting your ears; soft sounds are clearly audible without any need to adjust the volume.

My only complaint about Saving Private Ryan is that its fluent, flawless execution and cutting-edge SFX distract viewers from the real suffering of the real soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice during that awful and heroic day on the beach all those years ago. Tom Hanks and the other actors are excellent all, and the script is adequate if not unexceptional. But I think most of us on repeated viewings continue to feel astonishment at how Spielberg managed to create the sense of mayhem and panic on-screen. I've seen on-screen violence before that didn't seem choreographed, but never on this astounding scale.

So I think that SPR attracts a little too much attention to its own excellence. Other war movies about WWII cover similar ground but remain, in my humble opinion, a little more focused on and respectful towards the guys who actually did the fighting, the suffering, and the dying. Sam Fuller's The Red One (Reconstructed), for example, also has a beach invasion scene. We see some actual combat, but Fuller chooses to focus on the arm of a dead soldier. His wristwatch is still ticking. Fuller's point (I think) is that not just Time, but the world goes on. The war ends, people go back to their lives, and over time we all forget about our soldiers' sacrifices.

Another example from the same movie is when Sergeant Lee Marvin fires on one of his young recruits because the recruit is spooked and won't advance on the enemy. Spielberg, in his movie, gives us a much more typical Hollywood scene with a big fight between the soldiers after the Doctor (Giovanni Ribisi) has died. The point in both movies is to show how war can divide men between themselves and force them to do otherwise unthinkable things. Fuller made this point with a simplicity that keeps you focused on the subject of war; Spielberg made this point with a scene that leaves you marveling at how wonderful his actors are but that distracts you from the subject of war.

But, but...SPR is made with such intelligence and compassion and with such high levels of excellence in front of and behind the camera that I can't give it anything less than 5 stars.",1440288000,,2976,4.850393700787402

1241135,5,B00000K3AM,I was 16 years old in 1998 when I saw Saving Private Ryan in the movie theaters. It was the catalyst into my never ending fascination of everything and anything WWII related. It is been a long time since I've last seen it but it wasn't the second or third or fourth time seeing this movie. From seeing it as a young adolescent and then through my 20s the movie changes for me with how I feel emotionally every time I've seen it. War movies when I was a young man was appealing with the action and gunplay. But when I got older the real life attempt at comprehending sacrifice of a soldier with his Brothers in arms and their families at home is incredibly emotional.,1439424000,,666,4.2936507936507935

1241167,5,B00000K3AM,"A gritty, realistic-as-they-come film by Steven Spielberg. This film needs no introduction. The cast is superb, and the action, drama, and intensity of the film, combined with the morality of each person stands out as one of the finest films about WWII.

Inspired by a similar story during the Civil War, when word reaches the Pentagon that 3 out of 4 brothers were killed in action they scramble to find the 4th brother and ship him home. We see, and feel, the pain of the mother when she receives word of her loss. Tom Hanks as the lead character is ordered to take a small team, locate Private Ryan, and ship him safely home. Along they way they battle Germans, sometimes each other, and right when their own morality seems to fall apart, they find it again. But when they find Private Ryan they are aghast that the young fighting soldier does not want to return home. Instead he wishes to remain with his unit as they are about to battle the Germans for a key bridge in a small French town.

I highly recommend this film. It is poignant, heroic, and sad. It's a definite tribute to the men and women who served and fought in WWII.

1241263,5,B00000K3AM,"When ""Saving Private Ryan"" first appeared on DVD a number of years ago, it became an instant demonstration disc for its audio, especially during the opening and closing sequences.  Now that the movie is on high-definition Blu-ray disc in lossless DTS-HD Master Audio, things are better than ever for the viewer with a compatible 5.1 (or, better, 7.1) sound system and a powerful subwoofer.  I'm betting many a videophile will be lugging out this disc to demo their home theater for friends and neighbors.

The summer of 1998 saw the release of two great war films, Terrence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"" and Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan.""  Malick's film was the more intense, overall, yet the more distanced, too.  His detached, ethereal voice-overs made the film largely a series of philosophical queries on the meaning of life.  Spielberg's film was more down-to-earth, more rooted in the here and now, its objectives more clear-cut; yet it also assumed similar fundamental themes and probably holds up better today as universal entertainment and enlightenment.

My primary thoughts as I watched ""Private Ryan"" were ones of pride, thankfulness, and sorrow:  Pride in the selfless heroism of so many young soldiers to keep our world free; thankfulness for their courage and dedication; sorrow for the loss of so many lives.  The story begins on June 6, 1944, D-Day, Omaha Beach, the allied invasion of Normandy.  The first thirty minutes or so provide a vivid, almost documentary recreation of that ferocious battle, and for most viewers this part may be the highlight of the film.

Once having shown us the establishment of the beachhead, the film formally introduces its main character, Captain John Miller, played by Tom Hanks.  The military assigns Miller the unenviable task of leading a small squadron of eight men behind enemy lines to find a Private James Francis Ryan, who parachuted into German-held territory the day before.  Private Ryan's three brothers having been recently killed in action, the War Department determines to save the life of at least one of the siblings.  The long, middle section of the film chronicles the squad's search for Ryan, who has become separated from his company.  Here the film establishes the kind of group camaraderie found in other war films, most notably in one of my favorites, Lewis Milestone's 1945 classic, ""A Walk in the Sun.""  Once they find Ryan, the story focuses on Miller and his squad keeping him safe while at the same time trying to destroy a vital bridge.

The movie ideally casts Hanks as the common man we all respect, admire, and relate to.  He plays a good and decent man, a man who simply wants to get back to his wife, a man who feels that whether or not saving the life of one man is worth the risk of losing many others, if it takes him one step closer to going home, he'll do it.  But as he says, ""This Ryan better be worth it.""

Accompanying Hanks are Tom Sizemore as Sgt. Horvath, Edward Burns as Pvt. Reiben, Barry Pepper as Pvt. Jackson, Adam Goldberg as Pvt. Mellish, Van Diesel as Pvt. Caparzo, Giovanni Ribisi as Medic Wade, and Jeremy Davies as Corporal Upham.  Matt Damon plays Pvt. Ryan.  Other familiar faces we encounter are Ted Danson as Capt. Hamill, Paul Giamotti as Sgt. Hill, and Dennis Farina as Lt. Col. Anderson.  It is a fine ensemble cast, and although the film is rather long at nearly three hours, it utilizes most of its time well in establishing personal relationships among the men.

What, asks the film, is the worth of a single human soul?  When we look at the billions of people encircling this globe, to say nothing of the endless worlds of our universe, is one life more or less so very important?  Director Steven Spielberg says he made the film to honor the men who fought at D-Day.  Certainly, that is the film's clearest intent, but one cannot escape the importance of the initial question.  It's why the film begins and ends with an older Ryan of today revisiting the graves of those who fought so bravely to bring him to safety.  He asks, ""Am I a good man?""  Have I led a life worthy of all those other lives?  His family stands behind him in silent answer to his uncertainty.  Perhaps he comes to represent all of us today who should ask ourselves how worthy we are to have had so many pay the price of their lives for our happiness.  Like Spielberg's other distinguished war drama, ""Schindler's List,"" ""Private Ryan"" forces us to understand that every life is meaningful, and that every person can make a difference.

I read that at the time of the film's premi&egrave;re Spielberg invited groups of D-Day veterans to attend showings and provide feedback.  Two apparent discrepancies the vets noticed were ones that I suppose a little poetic license dictated.  The first was that the captain would never have displayed his bars of rank so prominently on his helmet.  It would have made him too easy a target as the group's leader.  The second inconsistency was that the men of the squad walking behind enemy lines would never have talked to one another as much as they do in the film; it would have alerted the enemy too easily to their presence.  Yet Spielberg prefers to create a group dynamic within his squad, to show us the bonds that unite these men in a mutual cause, and dialogue is the most expedient method he finds of doing so.  I think we can forgive the director a minor oversight for the greater cause.

Video:
Needless to say, the viewer can lose much of the dramatic impact of an experience like ""Saving Private Ryan"" in its transition from the big movie-theater screen to a smaller, more intimate home theater.  But Blu-ray high definition furnishes what is probably about as close an approximation as we could hope for, especially if one's home system is up to the task.  The picture quality on this dual-layer BD50, MPEG-4 mastered transfer is excellent, and even though Spielberg purposely drained some of the color out of a few scenes, emphasized some of the background grain, and even softened the image in yet other shots, it all contributes to the general impression of actual combat footage.

Interestingly, too, the DreamWorks' video engineers maintain the film's original 1.85:1 aspect ratio, a genuine 1.85:1 and not one trimmed, as we find from most studios, to fit 1.78:1 ratio televisions.  Therefore, you will see thin black strips at the top and bottom of the screen; don't be alarmed.  More important, the picture conveys the action on a wide scale, in a picture as satisfying as anyone could want.

Audio:
There is no question about the sound being true demo material.  From a technical standpoint, it is the star of the show.  The audio here should serve as a primer for every sound engineer in Hollywood, and maybe has.

Frequency range, tonal balance, and dynamic response are all excellent, of course, but it is the directionality that is really superb.  As in only a few other films, the lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 sonics open up a true 360-degree surround-sound field.  Yet a word about loudspeakers:  If your rear speakers are of the kind that radiate sound in several different directions at once, that is, if they fire both to the front and rear or to the sides, they may create too diffuse a sound to take full advantage of the audio in a film like this.  Side or rear-firing speakers are excellent for reproducing the ambient wall reflections of live orchestral music, but conventional front-firing speakers do a better job of pinpointing directional effects.

In ""Private Ryan,"" you should be able to hear a clear stereo spread across the front channels, across the back channels, and along the walls between the front and back channels.  The sounds of things like gunfire, explosions, trucks, tanks, airplanes, even the sounds of pounding rain and breaking glass should arrive at the ear from specific locations around the room, realistically and authentically.  As an aside, it is why I personally use two separate sound systems for different types of listening, one in my living room in two-channel stereo for music and a 7.1 home theater in another, smaller room for movie enjoyment.

""Saving Private Ryan"" delivers state-of-the-art movie sound.  Turn it up and annoy the neighbors or listen at a comfortable level and enjoy the remarkable, often subtle, aural effects.  Either way, you can't lose.

Note:  In early production discs, Paramount/DreamWorks and Technicolor acknowledged a synchronization problem in the audio starting at about chapter fifteen, and if you have one, they will exchange the disc for a newer, corrected transfer:  ""Technicolor has set up the following toll-free numbers for consumers who have already purchased the Saving Private Ryan Sapphire Series Blu-ray, which provides details on how they can receive a replacement copy -- US and Canada: 888-370-8621, UK: 08000-852-613. Consumers can also return the Blu-ray to the stores where they purchased the product to receive a replacement.""  The newer discs have a blue label side, and the keep case has a yellow bar-code area.

But note also that on the early disc I could not detect the audio issue in either of my own playback systems:  my main, downstairs system (Panasonic BD player/Onkyo 7.1 receiver) or my upstairs bedroom system (Panasonic BD player/Sony 2.0 television).  I rather suspect this sync issue is either so minor a person cannot easily detect it, or it is an equipment-related problem, meaning it may only show up if you're using certain BD players or audio amplifiers.  In any case, it's comforting to know the studio addressed the problem so quickly.

Extras:
The BD set comes with two Blu-ray discs.  The first disc, as I've said, a BD50, contains the feature film; twenty scene selections; bookmarks; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese spoken languages; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Disc two, a single-layer BD25, contains the bulk of the bonus items, most of them made at the time of the film's production and presented in standard definition.  Part one of two segments consists of a series of featurettes on the movie itself.  First up is ""An Introduction by director Steven Spielberg,"" about two minutes; followed by ""Looking Into the Past,"" about five-minutes on the research done for the film and the development of the screenplay.  Next, we get ""Miller and his Platoon,"" about eight minutes, wherein Spielberg, Hanks, and others discuss their roles in the film; followed by ""Boot Camp,"" about seven minutes on the cast's preparation for their parts.  After those items, we find ""Making Saving Private Ryan,"" twenty-two minutes of behind-the-scenes shots and commentary; followed by ""Re-creating Omaha Beach,"" eighteen minutes on how Spielberg and his crew re-created the historical D-Day event.  Then we get ""Music and Sound,"" sixteen minutes with composer John Williams and the sound people; followed by a few ""Parting Thoughts"" from Spielberg, Hanks, and others on their experiences making the film.  Finally, we have the longest featurette of all, ""Into the Breach:  Saving Private Ryan,"" twenty-five minutes of interviews and commentary on the making of the film; followed by a theatrical and a re-release trailer, both in high definition.

Part two consists of a single, eighty-eight-minute documentary, ""Shooting War,"" hosted and narrated by Tom Hanks.  It describes the end of the War using real combat footage, recreations, vintage newsreels, and comments from WWII vets.

Parting Thoughts:
""Saving Private Ryan"" won five Academy Awards in 1998:  Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Sound, and Best Sound Effects Editing, plus a boatload of other honors from the Directors Guild, the American Legion, the USO, the Department of the Army, and so on.  It deserved all the honors it received, looks and sounds great on Blu-ray, and safely remains among the best war movies of all time.",1434758400,,12083,4.955334987593052
1241264,4,B00000K3AM,"Great movie. My daughter is into history and wanted to see it. The opening scene as they storm the beach is pretty graphic, but the story is very good. I would recommend",1434758400,,169,4.3125

1241277,5,B00000K3AM,"With The Longest day, this is a brutal depiction of the  Normandy invasion. Fictional but believable, these movies give the viewer a remarkably realistic picture of what actually happened in june 1944.

Tom Hanks is one of the most versatile, broadest range actors ever produced, capable of comedy with equal skill as drama and suspense. Spielberg, who produced this epic, means that whatever resources are needed to give the final product its ultimate ""you are there"" believability is not in question. The hand to hand town sweeping combat at the climax, along with a powerful but modest role for Matt Damon, makes this a must have in any war film collection.",1433289600,,718,4.573643410852713

The first half hour covers the landing on D-Day in such poignant realism that, as a child of the military, I found myself weeping uncontrollably for the sacrifice involved. Few other movies have left me feeling this way. (I also wept at the end of Schindler's List.) Today is a day to remember those brave men, and their sacrifice, and whether or not we agree with them, whether or not we hate the whole idea of war and can see only pacifism as a way out in a nuclear world, let us honor the memories of all those who have given their lives, no matter who they fought for.",1432512000,2,734,4.212765957446808

Acting is great.  I love Tom Hanks, he brings so much into the role at the head of the unit.  Matt Damon was great as Private Ryan. Barry Pepper as the sniper was terrific as was Tom Sizemore as the Technical Sargent.  The y all worked very well together on screen even as they opposed each other in moral situations.

Such a great movie.  Excellent story, acting, and beautifully shot. This is one that is a must for my collection.  It's got great war scenes, emotional moments, and moral decisions made by a war time unit to really sit and enjoy every second of the movie. .",1431561600,2,708,4.318181818181818

1241552,5,B00000K3AM,"Personally, I really like war movies, especially about WW2. I'm not sure of how factual this movie is but it has a great plot line, and the acting is great. Tom Hanks is great as usual. The opening scenes are gripping, and the scenes make you feel for the guys who really landed on D-Day. How does a man face certain death? That has always been a gripping question for me. I've often wondered if I would have been able to climb into that boat knowing that when the ramp was lowered machine gun bullets were going to spray in. What went on in the minds of those men in the final moments of their lives? I am so grateful for those men who put their lives on the line so that I, and you, could be free from dictators today. Well, kinda free. The movie was enjoyable for me because of the acting and the plot line that kept moving along making me want to know what was going to happen next. All of the acting was very good. Even the person playing the coward played his roll real good. So good that that he flipped me out; I was upset with him! It was sad that the hero along with his side kick sergeant got killed at the end. I really grew to like those two characters. And I felt real bad when the mother got the news about her sons being killed in action. Great movie!",1427587200,,1267,4.092369477911647

1241571,5,B00000K3AM,"Saving Private Ryan is, in my opinion, the best WWII movie ever made.  This movie, and especially the first 45 minutes during the beach landing, brings real combat right to your front door.  I spent my entire career in the military and never experienced what those brave soldiers, sailors, and marines did during WWII.  The only part of this movie that I had a hard time with is the part where Pvt. Upum encountered the German SS Soldier on the staircase.........and the German SS Soldier walked past him.  In real life the German SS Troop would have shot Upum without hesitation.  SS Soldiers were the 'cream of the crop' of Hitler's elite troops. They were notorious for killing everything in sight and not taking prisoners.  This is the only part of the movie I found unrealistic.  This movie inspired the HBO Series, ""Band of Brothers""; a story of the 102nd Airborne, 506th.  I highly recommend purchasing this series along with Saving Private Ryan.",1426636800,,953,4.803680981595092

1241623,5,B00000K3AM,"This is a classic war movie that demonstrates, to some very small extent, what it would be like to be in a war. The first scenes of the beach landing on D-Day is gut wrenching in it's explicitness. I was in the Air Force for 10 years, but I never served in a combat role. Saving Private Ryan makes you appreciate some of the terror that the young men experienced that day and in several smaller battles afterward. My son has always wanted to see this, so we watched it as a family and I commented during the movie several times to emphasize why Veteran's Day, Memorial Day, and Independence Day are such important holidays that show respect for the men and women who have died defending this country and our freedoms. So many boys think Call of Duty and Halo are what war is like because they play these games constantly, but when they see real people getting killed by real bullets (well, movie style anyway) it helps to bring them back to reality. It is a pretty brutal movie that all kids should definitely not watch, but I know my son and he was ready to see this movie.",1425427200,,1074,4.348258706467662

When it showed Ryan's mother watching the car drive up to their farm ... a minister and an officer of the military ... she fell to her knees and sat down on the porch.  I can relate.  When I was told my son was killed by a drunk driver, I fell to the floor and literally crawled down the hall to waken the others.  A mother isn't supposed to outlive her children.  The senior officer who said, ""You're going over there and get him the hell out of there!"" said after he had read from a copy of Abraham Lincoln's letter to a mother who had lost five sons ... very moving ... especially when you know such things happen in war.  Well done, very well done!",1422921600,,793,4.038461538461538
1241703,5,B00000K3AM,"I've seen my fair share of war films, but it's really surprising that I've waited this long to finally see (in full) what is probably the greatest WWII film ever made. There's probably no amount of words that I could write that would do justice to what I feel like having seen this for the first time. The only thing I regret is not having seen it on a bigger screen (although, to be fair, I was 9 years old when this first came out).

 The plot, as if anyone didn't know it by now, is that an Army captain (Tom Hanks) who just landed at Normandy Beach is charged with retrieving a Private Ryan, the last surviving of his mother's sons, and returning him safely home. Of course, as all of the characters point out several times throughout the film, they run into a lot of FUBAR (Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition) situations. And if there's one truth that this film gets at, it's that war is ugly (original, I know right?). Still, the call of duty is just as important to every single one of these men as is their devotion to each other. They face a lot of moral quandaries, and even make some questionable decisions, but when it all comes down they have each others' backs and the knowledge that completion of the mission will earn them the right to go home. I can't really think of a stronger motivation than that.

 Another thing which this film does right is with its selection of story, which also plays into the human element. The mission isn't to take a hill or some other landmark: it's to rescue someone. Using WWII as a setting for this story allows the average person to really connect with it on a deeper level than if it had just been a typical war film with a large ensemble cast. And by the way, the cast in this movie is pretty insane. Granted, there are many films before it (THE LONGEST DAY is one example that comes to mind) that did the same thing, but the attention to character in this one sets it apart from the rest. There are elements of cliche, but every main character is fully fleshed out.

 This film is also extraordinary for its cinematographic approach. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski utilized a handheld style which puts you into the thick of the action and aptly portrays the chaos and confusion inherent in those situations. This is also enhanced by a gritty look partially achieved by shooting on film. Last, but not least, there is an emotionally resonant score by John Williams which punctuates the story at all the right moments yet is never intrusive or overbearing. I also appreciated the diegetic use of the Edith Piaf song, ""Tu es partout"" before a climactic scene, and which conveys to the audience the feelings of the people these men left behind in service to their country (even though it's a song about love lost, and to be sure there were plenty of people who never came back).

Overall every single one of these elements, including some I haven't mentioned, combine to create a brutally realistic and emotionally powerful depiction of war, the heights of which has been reached by few. And not just that, it managed to do all of this without leaning too far in the direction of being pro- or anti-war. It presents it as is, the good with the bad, and doesn't demonize the enemy as so many films are apt to do. Hopefully this hasn't been too long-winded, but this is an incredible film that deserves to be seen by everyone.",1422921600,6,3372,4.491027732463295

1241738,5,B00000K3AM,"Steven Spielberg directed this powerful, realistic re-creation of WWII's D-day invasion and the immediate aftermath in this movie,Saving Private Ryan. The story,written by Robert Rodat,is loosely based on the real-life case of the Niland brothers.

Saving Private Ryan develops into a powerful and potent portrayal of men at war. It sets a new benchmark for realism in World War II films, and defined war movies for a generation. A film of scope and vision rarely experienced, its award-winning cinematography and sound editing helped convey the blood-chilling images that presents war as violent,harrowing, and horrific. Aside from that,it also presents a soul especially with the characters involved. The cast provided brilliant and excellent performances especially from its lead star,Tom Hanks. And definitely,Spielberg was masterful in his direction of the film as he sends an anti-war message but not to the point of condemning patriotism and love for one's country and countrymen.

Truly a masterpiece.",1420588800,,1009,5.588235294117647

1241774,5,B00000K3AM,"We are within a couple of weeks of completing the year 2014, which makes it about 17 years since the film was made. We have had at least two undeclared wars and some brief peripheral conflicts since then. This is the first time I have seen the picture. With some 2400 reviews to use as guidance, there is no need for me to do anything but cast my vote. I have just read a few of the one star reviews, excluding those which speak about the technical aspects of the disc about which I know nothing. On my limited television set, it looked fine.
True, it is not the same as being in war, there are artifices utilized to simulate the reality, so as to allow us to read into it a great deal more than can be spelled out on film. This is true because all theater is artifice whether  live on a stage, or on film, on television, whatever may be the medium and using whatever tools one may have at one's disposal. True there are stereotypes. All theater and all reality consists of many stereotypes because only by use of them can people think about complex matters with any hope of communication to others. (Read Walter Lippmann's two classic works of a century ago.)  The question here is, did the various stereotypes communicate what the creators wanted to say about war. Apparently most reviewers thought it did. I live among some of the survivors of the War about which the creators want us to think and feel. The ones I know were on merchant ships that were sunk on the cruel Murmansk run, others fought their way from the D-Day landings into Germany. What they experienced has to be translated into the typical, often the stereotypical, to communicate with those of us who were not there. (I was a few years younger so I got into the war that followed by only five years, the one Spielberg and Company portray.) How do you explain or show on screen the meaning to a young man of finding that he has lost a leg at 20 years of age. I think the picture does as good a job as a family picture can, perhaps as good as anyone can, to communicate with those who have not had the same experience. The battle scenes do have a vivid quality with suitable heroics, but some of what ordinary men do in combat does exceed credibility....but are true. Soldiers on both side are shown manifesting fear in the face of death. How much more need be shown? Is there some 'higher morality' shown that is unreal. I don't think so; at least no more than one would hope for, in a nation that will continue to send sons and, now, daughters, into combat so long as it remains an important factor in the world. One thing it does show in Private Ryan, a true thing about men in combat so long as the cohesion of the group is maintained: when things get dirty and deadly, it is one's sense of obligation to the guys around you that maintains group cohesion. For those who cannot feel that emotion, fleeing a battlefield, surrendering and seeking the mercy of the other side, are normal outcomes.
Is this the best of all POSSIBLE films about war, no, we have not, and, almost certainly will never see a film that can approximate the emotional state of men locked in combat. Is this one of the classic attempts to perform that impossible feat? I think so. It should be a worthwhile experience for most viewers to watch this fine Spielberg effort.",1419206400,,3315,4.406199021207178

The cast is stellar, the film moves from location to location with complete concentration on the randomness of dying in battle, and the horrendous human costs of war. You can almost smell the rubble and the sound of the approaching Panzers at the end, metal parts screeching for want of oil, still sends chills down my spine.

1241799,5,B00000K3AM,"I am eventually going to have to collect a copy of this motion picture on DVD, I still have it on VHS but no longer have a player - and I doubt that tape is still any good. It speaks highly though that of all the old tapes I once abandoned when I made the change over to DVD long ago that for some reason I could not let this one just go away.

Tom Hanks is about as unlikely an actor for a serious war movie as I can think of. I thought it at the time, and still think so. But what is interesting in this flick, and the film genre as a whole is that MOST of the men who went overseas during world war two were very young at the time, even the balance of the officers. Therefore Tom Hanks presenting somewhat of a ""Fresh Faced Kid"" appearance for a junior officer in the war is in fact true to the scenario being portrayed. And on another note, it does tend to make the pathos of the entire film stand out just that much more strongly.

It is an historic fact, that when the last surviving son of a family is in combat - the war department did in fact take action to send them home. The story here is of an extraordinary effort on the part of the War Department (later called the ""Defence Department"") to retrieve the sole heir of a family.

It is also interesting to note the attitude of the rescuee that he owed a debt to his departed comrades in arms - he wanted to stay and avenge his fallen buddies even at risk of his own life. This speaks to what is called ""Survivors Guilt"", a phenomenon much more common among (or at least more publicized among) Vietnam veterans who could not at times understand why they lived and their best friends fell...

I rate this movie among the ranks of those that are CLASSIC ""KEEPERS"" because of the several underlying stories that it tells, and the manner in which it tells those tales.

If you have never seen it - see it. Even if you have to rent it first. It is likely that once you have seen it you will want a copy of your own to keep in your personal library, as I do.

Bravo ZULU!

1241856,4,B00000K3AM,"First of all, Saving Private Ryan is one of the best movies of my time. The whole idea of the movie, the special FX, etc. makes you feel as if you're in the war. It doesn't just follow a plain old war movie, it gets personal with the story. The idea of having to go through Germany to find one soldier and possibly lose your whole team is noble. The only down factor to the movie is how long it takes for the plot to build up but I mean that is the whole point, I feel if it skipped some parts the movie wouldn't feel complete. That's where personal aspect of the movie comes in.

Character wise this is an all-star cast. Tom Hanks fits the role perfect of Captain Miller. Captain Miller was a school teacher back home but you can tell he's been through a lot especially when emphasized by the up and close shots. There is ultimately a story to uncover about the captain. Now there are many more all star actors in this film but one I would definitely like to mention is Tom Sizemore playing the role of Sgt. Horvath. Sizemore also stars in another great film, ""Black Hawk Down"". I personally feel if Sgt. Horvath was fulfilled by another person that it would take a lot away from the movie. War movies are Sizemore's strong suit.

As I mentioned the special FX are and were advanced for it's time. I personally love World War II based films , video games and books so before watching for the first time I was definitely anxious to see how well put together the film was. Being directed by Steven Spielberg I knew I wouldn't be disappointed. The most notable scene is the first twenty minutes, the invasion of Normandy. Now we all should know what happens through our history books but the amount of time and effort put into making this scene is astonishing. I'm not going to give any spoilers for someone who hasn't watched the film yet.

I would also like to mention the comedic scenes in the film. Every time Corporal Upham messed up something I found myself cracking up. However, in no way is it ""Inglorious Bastards"". To compare these two films would be outrageous. I've had a few friends that have never seen Saving Private Ryan and they always ask me if it is like ""Inglorious Bastards"". My simple answer is and always will be, ""Just watch it, you won't be disappointed"".

Overall I give this movie 4 stars considering the fact some people can't sit through the whole movie, well at least people I know. As mentioned, the movie fulfills all types of personal portrayals. If you watch this movie, you can have those characters remembered and in a way honored. It makes you realize what the soldiers in WWII went through. I would recommend this to anyone who loves WWII based stories.",1414627200,3,2689,4.448275862068965

An amazing tale, with amazing twists that ""enter the surreal"".  IMHO one of the MOST realistic WWII movies, that portrays so many dimensions and perspectives, it may take some time to ""process"" afterward.  Extremely graphic, emotional and heart-rending.  Not for children or the emotionally vulnerable.  A movie that leaves one speechless and filled with much emotion.  A ""Must See"".",1412380800,,508,5.51948051948052

1241895,5,B00000K3AM,"Gripping, horrific first-person experiences in the thick of World War II, as you're already, no doubt, keenly aware. It's held up exceptionally well over time, most likely due to the great lengths taken by Spielberg and company to stamp it down in a specific era and remain steadfastly historical. The Normandy beach landing that opens the action is still as powerful and haunting as ever, an effects showcase like none other that puts us right down in the middle of hell itself. I couldn't help but pontificate about the futility of ground warfare here, faced with row after row of doe-eyed teenagers, unceremoniously mowed down before taking so much as a single step on enemy territory. Which is part of its message, no doubt - though that's somewhat countered by the tales of bravado, camaraderie and character that sprawl out over the next two hours. A richly rounded war story, it enjoys a mess of acting performances even stronger than the work of the effects team. Tom Hanks is at the top of the mountain as Captain Miller, a demanding role that he owns from moment one. Supporting faces pop out of the woodwork at every corner; most of us remember Vin Diesel and Adam Goldberg in early roles, but quick shots from Paul Giamatti, Ted Danson, Bryan Cranston and more left my jaw agape. How did I miss spotting these guys the last time? A true epic, profound and moving, with plenty of action but just as much character-building and adventure also in the mix. One of Spielberg's - and Hanks's - best.",1410739200,,1505,4.704545454545454

1241956,5,B00000K3AM,"There are many excellent reviews for this film, so all I will say is this is a classic in every sense. My parents lived through WWII in Europe and came to the US afterwards. They were so happy that their children got to grow up free and we grew up free because of the brave men who fought during WWII. When I went to France, I went to the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial. The cemetery is located on a bluff overlooking Omaha Beach (one of the landing beaches of the Normandy Invasion) and I thanked all those who gave their lives to free so many. This film captures it all. Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks and cast made a great film for great hero's",1407110400,,653,4.274193548387097
1241957,5,B00000K3AM,"The very beginning of the film, and certain chilling scenes portrays the reminder to all of us that 'freedom is not free.' As we watch our soldiers in bloody battles, while on the edge of your seat, we are reminded not only about the nightmares of war, but how many of those loved ones who never returned home. I certainly had flashbacks of what my own father went through in one war, and thought about all the soldiers in my class of 1968 who lost their lives, and how much their families suffered. This is a deeply emotional movie, that is intense and thought-provoking from start to finish.

The chilling story highlights how a group of men set out on a desperate mission to save one soldier, who already lost 3 brothers in the war. Each scene shows the remarkable courage of our brave soldiers, despite the terrifying fear they endured. Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, and Tom Sizemore give an outstanding performance in their acting roles. The movie entertained throughout as it tugs at the heart, and special effects were incredible. Sound effects were excellent as well. This movie deserved the 5 Academy Awards that it received as it hit home for millions of Americans and their families. A fantastic Steven Spielberg film that we can't forget, along with Tom Hanks at his best as usual. Highly recommended!",1407110400,2,1306,4.728070175438597

1242017,5,B00000K3AM,"Another towering achievement for Steven Spielberg, this is a must-have for any cinema buff or history-minded person.
The story revolves around several brothers who are lost in WW2 (patterned after the real-life Sullivans, brothers all, who were lost on one USNavy ship); the War Department was determined that the one remaining brother should be spared by being pulled from the field.
The DDay invasion was presented flawlessly, with barrage balloons, landing craft, the iron crosses sunk by the Germans to deter landings, etc.  When the landing ramp goes down, you feel as if you were there at that moment on June 6, 1944.
Regardless, the action on the beach before the German defenses were overrun was intense and thrilling.  The film consisted of the riveting opening, the absolutely thrilling conclusion, with a lull in the middle.  The squad that will 'save Private Ryan' land on DDay and are later informed that they are being detached to march thru the French countryside (Normandy) to find Private Ryan.  There are some missteps(where they find the wrong Private Ryan), some encounters with the Germans, and finally the breathtaking battle at the end, where a bridge is being held by the US forces, including Private Ryan.

War has seldom been presented in such a nuanced and absorbing way.  My beloved father had served in the medical corps in London, tending to the DDay men after they were med-evac'd, and he was speechless after seeing the film.  It had brought back memories and shown him things he'd only heard from those under his care...I can think of no greater tribute...",1404432000,,1589,4.973584905660378

1242031,5,B00000K3AM,"There are countless of reasons that legendary director Steven Spielberg should be celebrated for.  In this film, the most applicable (for me at least) is his attention to detail.  Specifically, his attention to detail for the time period in question.  When three young men die during the 1944 Normandy Invasion, the military resolves to send the fourth surviving brother home to his mother.  However, this Private First Class James Francis Ryan is missing in action, so a squad is assembled to find him.  Led by Army Captain John H. Miller, played by Tom Hanks, they set out through war-torn France on this ""public relations"" mission.  This film is awesome as is and Steven Spielberg paid attention to every detail to make it right.  The fights, ranging from one-on-one brawls to full-blown battles, were all epic.  The characters were interesting and their dialogue was worth listening to from beginning to end.  I sometimes wonder how the military managed to keep a sense of organization over a war this massive, but they obviously managed and this film shows us only a piece of what they had to contend with.  It may have only been a piece, that it was one heck of a piece.  This film gets my full recommendation...no hesitation.  Enjoy.",1403308800,,1240,4.852380952380952

I'm talking top 5 of all time level of great. In fact, to this day, I still think the Oscars are a joke because they chose the dorky RomCom Shakespear in Love as the best picture over Saving Private Ryan. That still sticks in my crawl 16 years later.

It's a great story. It's extremely well made. The acting is superb. The music is wonderful. There is nothing bad about this film. Nothing.

It shows you the horrors of war as well as the greatness of humanity all in the same story.

I decided to rewatch this movie this year on June 6th (the 70th anniversay of D Day) after watching a lot of interviews of WWII veterans talk about their experiences on the beaches of France. When you listen to those first hand accounts of the invasion then watching the very graphic opening scene of Saving Private Ryan....well...if it doesn't make you appreciate what those men did to rid the world of tyranny then something is wrong with you.

The way the movie captures every level of bravery, from the guys who storm the beach with piss and vinegar to the guys who barely make it off the landing boats before breaking down in tears....it shows you every angle of humanity. And that occurs through teh whole movie. It doesn't paint all soldiers from WWII as super soldiers incapable of losing. It shows them for what they really were...a bunch of kids who wanted to do their duty and were scared of dying on the battlefield. It shows them making dumb mistakes because they weren't professional soldiers. It shows them as human beings, not unrealistic movie characters.

It's an emotional story that will captivate you from so many angles. And it just so well made that it completely immerses you into 1944 France.

Watch this movie. Then go find a veteran and give him a hug. He deserves it.",1402444800,,1844,4.536144578313253

1242058,5,B00000K3AM,"SOME SPOILERS POSSIBLE:

I went into this film TOTALLY COLD on opening weekend. All I knew was ""Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, war movie"", so I figured would be good. What I wasn't expecting was a 25 non-stop recreation of the invasion on D-Day.  An assault on the senses -- the war footage is so incredibly realistic that I was begging for relief.  With the possible exception of ""The Thin Red Line"" (which has an element of sadism that this film lacks, fortunately), as someone else said, this movie has the most realistic war scenes ever filmed. The viewer is not spared -- the second  most disturbing sequence in the film is an extended sequence of hand-to-hand combat from a unexpected character.

If that was it, the film would be dismissible, but the battle scenes frame what gives the watcher a true sense of what it means to be a soldier. The characters are are written and performed very realistically, as well. After seeing the film, I understood much, much better what the veterans went through, the traumas they endured and had to carry with them, their courage, and why so many of them were outraged at the Vietnam War protests (although they might have missed the apples-and-oranges nature of the two wars, but that's not a topic to explore here).

I don't now if saying I enjoyed the film would be a good way to explain my reaction, but it is excellent. A masterpiece that totally achieves what Spielberg intended it to. He and Tom Hanks, who plays the Captain of the squad that is assigned to retrieve Private Ryan, really should have won Oscars that year. The movie, I'm sure, loses a lot of impact on the small screen, but if my son ever says he's thinking about the Armed Forces, we'll be watching this together.

I was real surprised that I hadn't seen this movie, and then I did, and holy crap.
This is one of the most realistic and horrible movies I've ever seen (and i still haven't seen Schindler's List)

So from the get-go in this film, you know exactly what you're in for;
Realism to an absurd degree
The Death of American Soldiers in Detail
And Lots and lots of Heartbreak

Now, all of these aspects aren't necessarily a bad thing, besides, the attention to detail and the feeling of legitimate emotion are what set this movie apart from most of the other WWII films and publications.

Something important I need to address; The Opening Scene
The D-Day Invasion Sequence in the forefront of this movie is the thing that really sets the tone for the whole film,
and this opening is the single most disturbing thing I've ever seen.

So, historically accurate, emotionally in depth, and one of the greatest movies of all time, and it's gotta be a
100%- Steven Spielberg's brutal yet captivating WWII masterpiece is the combination of poignancy, an amazing story,
great performances, incredible detail, and beyond Grade-A execution, and as a result, it definitively earns its place as

Amazon and Spielberg should consider making these movies available as soon as possible before we lose a teachable moment.",1402012800,2,502,5.435897435897436
1242065,5,B00000K3AM,"Steven Spielberg's 1998 World War II epic pays due homage to the heroism and sacrifice of those who served in the European theatre of the war.
 It begins with the titular character (Harrison Young) visiting the American cemetery at Normandy with his family, five decades after the main events of this story.
 Upon finding the grave of a fallen comrade in arms, he falters and must be assisted  by his family, including his wife(Kathleen Byron) as the review of the events leading to his safe homecoming begins.
 On that fated Tuesday, June 6, 1944, we see Captain John H. Miller( played with all due charisma by Tom Hanks) leading forces ashore on D-Day, which is accurately depicted as a choppy ride, complete with motion-sick combatants and shaky  camera shots that give a realistic view of combat from the combatant's viewpoint. Soon, all the noise, confusion, and grimness of combat come into play.
  One striking aspect  of this color reenactment of the D-Day Invasion is that the reason why most photos of  the Normandy Invasion are in black and white:  Presumably so that the public wouldn't see how  bloody the water was during that event. It gives a whole new meaning to the phrase, ""Crimson tides"".
  Mills disembarks on a beach covered with the wounded, dying and dead. We view the hideous reality of one soldier picking up another's severed arm, and another soldier struggling to hold in his exposed intestines as he pleas for help.
 Meanwhile Washington D.C., General George Marshall (Harve Presnell) learns of the deaths of three Iowa brothers--the Ryans, and of the existence of a fourth brother( Matt Damon) who parachuted somewhere behind enemy lines.
 After receiving orders to locate and retrieve  Private Ryan from the front on D-Day plus 3, Miller designates six men from his company for the mission, including sharpshooter Private Daniel Jackson( Barry Pepper), Technician 4th Grade Irwin Wade( Giovanni Ribisi, who previously appeared with Hanks in ""That Thing You Do!""), Private 1st Class Adrian Caparzo (Vin Diesel), Private Stanley""Fish"" Mellish(Adam Goldberg), Private 1st Class Richard Reiben (Edward Burns), Technician 5th Grade Timothy E. Upham(Jeremy Davies), and Technical Sergeant Mike Howarth(Tom Sizemore).
 There is some reluctance to go on a mission to find one man who may or may not even be alive. But Miller  assures his men that if finding Ryan is the task that will send him home to his wife, he is willing to go through with it.
 There is the brief perspective of the homefront where Mrs. Ryan(Amanda Boxer) is shown on the day she receives  her son's death notices at the family's Iowa farm.
 The unit on the special mission to bring home her last remaining son will endure fierce combat, two casualties, and challenging encounter with a civilian family caught up in the fighting, a confrontation with a lone German soldier(Joerg Stadler) to whom they show mercy, a misleading encounter with the wrong Private Ryan(Nathan Fillion) before they learn Ryan's true whereabouts.
 When found, Ryan is initially reluctant to go, feeling that he should stay with the only brothers he had left and that his family's triple tragedy should not give him a free pass, earning the ire of one member of the unit, who informs him that two men died in the search for him.
 Ryan has a change of heart, goes with the search unit and the men endure many fateful encounters before the story comes to its conclusion.
 Ted Danson appears as Captain Fred Hamill, Leland Orser as 2nd Lieutenant De Windt, Max Martini as Corporal Fred Henderson, Dennis Farina as Lieutenant Colonel Anderson, Paul Giamatti as Staff Sergeant William Hill, Bryan Cranston plays Colonel I.W. Bryce, Dale Dye is a War Department Colonel, Ian Porter plays Private Trask, and Demitri Goritsas is Private Parker.

I shouldn't have been suprised when I read that Steven Spielberg was the one who directed the movie.  I will tell you though, that there are quite a few gory parts.  But it is extremely realistic, which is why I am warning you; not like modern movies (""Captain America: The Winter Soldier""), like when a grenade explodes underneith their feet, the soldiers in this movie don't go flying forward with zero obvious physical injuries.  No no no, they loose limbs in such a realistic way it is nearly petrifying.  After watching that movie on Memorial Day, I had a whole new level of respect of those who served and who are serving in the US military, especially the ones who didn't make it back.  In other words, I totally recommend it to anyone who won't panic (or anything worse) at the sight of a soldier slowlying dying as he looks at his intestines sprawled out on the beach next him...if you can take it, watch this movie!  The story line, characters, EVERYTHING in this movie is amazing.  Totally recommend it and that is why I give it five stars.",1401148800,,1157,4.524038461538462

1242092,5,B00000K3AM,"Possibly the best war movie of the 1990s, this film with it's gritty realism, the gruesome reality with which the soldiers are fatally wounded is indeed not for the faint hearted but is an advancement from movies where sliders and shot and fall down dead with a neat wound. War is a gruesome thing indeed, War is hell William Tecumseh Sherman but sometimes less of an evil than allowing tyranny and unopposed terror to flourish and take over the world -more of that later

Begins with the Battle of Omaha in all of its horror and raw courage of the American soldiers making the D Day landing.
Followed by some rivet ting triumphs as the evil Nazi war machine starts to crumble and the Nazis-so good at butchering - soon reveal themselves as the cowards they were.

In Washington, D.C, General George Marshall, (after having received news that the four brothers of the Ryan family have been killed in action and their mother will receive three telegrams to inform her of this) finds out that the last of the bothers Private James Ryans is missing in action and orders that a force is sent to find him and bring him home.

Captain John H Miller (Tom Hanks) receives an order to head the task force he assembles to rescue Ryan and they penetrate German lines , losing tow of the men in the process , and showing great valour. Their are many questions they as, many questions the movie poses-Throughout the men question why 8 men risk death to rescue one man.- and is somewhat u;ultimately answered at the end. Throughout the men question why 8 men risk death to rescue one man.

The movie ends with Private Ryan being found and though distressed by the news of his brothers deaths refuses to desert his companions, and so together Miller and his task force battle with Ryan;s battalion to secure a vital bridge against the Germans in epic battle scene.

Much action,. so action aficionados will not be disappointed but this movie also has humour, philosophy, drama,and pathos
the ending is a real tearjerker. The movie go's some way to explaining why free nations must fight to retain the good  in the world being overwhelmed by the  the forces of evil , tyranny and terror. 70 years ago it was Nazism that treated to plunge the world into darkness and destroy all goodness, today it is Islamism . Today against America and Britain , joined by the descendants of Hitler's foremost victims, must join together again and fight the new scourge against humanity-Islamist terror and tyranny.
May the free world show the same steadfastness they showed against Hitler and won",1399939200,2,2565,4.6866666666666665
1242093,4,B00000K3AM,"Has very authentic D-Day landing scenes; I've visited D-Day Museum, graves, Point du Hoc, some of the beaches.  Instead of troops aggressively seeking the enemy, this platoon is lead by a teacher (in his real life) who goes behind enemy lines to rescue a boy from a family that has already lost its other boys.  When they find Private Ryan, he wants to stay and fight, but they make progress towards getting him back in one piece.  Along the way they see civilians who've been bombed out, shelled out, starved, and lacking medical care.  Not a happy story, but a realistic depiction of wartime trauma.

A great piece of history. A great story told about the Sole Survivor Rule of the military, that allows the last of a generation to be protected.

This film is the winner of five Academy Awards and deservedly so. If you like war movies you will love this one. It is a graphic film though, especially the carnage at Omaha beach. A lot of gore. The story line concerns a squad of G.I.'s sent deep into France to extricate a lone soldier due to an executive decision based on a family tragedy. This film asks the question (and if this sounds like Spock on Star Trek it is where I heard it) ""Does the needs of the many outweigh those of the few?"" It is a well acted and action filled film about men sent to do a very dangerous job and questioning the rationale behind it. Hanks is his usual everyman best and the supporting cast is top notch. A great war movie but not for the people who cringe at the bloody effects. Highly recommended.",1397088000,,913,4.345029239766082

1242122,5,B00000K3AM,"A Classic, film worth the money to be able to enjoy it at any time and quality,  is excellent. I am adding a film or two from all the wars, that gives an excellent portrayal. Also considered are ones like this that the direction, story and acting all are right on.
Having visited all the D-Day landing sites the surrounding areas and the American Cemetery in Normandy, was one of the most amazing weeks of my life. Going over the annual celebrations adds more as every place a Canadian died is marked with a Statue or plaque and flowers, the larger the monument and amount of flowers indicates how many died there. I was there in Normandy over the D-Day period and through the Summer Solstice it is a wonderful time to visit Normandy. But it can get chilly and be prepared for  some rain, but a great place to visit and you will see how in some places the vistas look similar to what you see in this film.
I have to say in this area you will see a lot of things from vessels to vehicles and a lot of British and American Flags, the one thing I heard was for years many of the vet's  returned for the festival and every year fewer Vet's made it to the celebration. But photos and history is everywhere, while the this time of year its light till almost Midnight, Museums and  such close at normal hours. And I was comfortable in France and made to feel welcome, in Paris I think people are so involved with themselves they are rude as a way of survival. New Yorkers will feel at home with the Subway's, though clean Restroom's some even work's of art, are a bit of a mind blowing experience.",1396137600,,1590,4.29

So an update on this product, while the movie is still wonderful =) - the quality of this blue-ray is horrible.  I thought it might be my HDMI cables I have running from my blue ray player but it definitely isn't (other movies are extreme quality).  This DVD is horribly pixilated to the point it's not even worth watching.  Looking at the disc itself, you can clearly see lines that shouldn't be there under the surface (I just opened the sealed package, never touched anything but the very edges of the disc to insert it).  I might try cleaning it - but I'm sure this is not something on the disc, but ""in"" the disc itself.  Maybe a glitch in quality control, I'm not sure.",1395792000,,833,4.267515923566879

1242135,5,B00000K3AM,"I'm not sure there's anything I can add to what others have written about this movie. The first 15 minutes of it are incredible, and men I know who have been in war, are truly terrified by what they see. I swear I don't breathe every time I watch Captain Miller's company charge the beaches of Normandy on D-Day.

Little things about the movie have always impressed me. Many of the actors have that gaunt look of 1940's Americans, that is, very thin. Barry Pepper still stands out to me in his role as Private Jackson, with his sharpshooter skills derived from many of the legends of the US Military.

I have watched this movie literally 50 times over the past 15 years. I had it on DVD (yes, bought from Amazon in the late 90's), and I had to have it on BluRay. A lot of times, BluRay versions are basically the same as DVD with better sound, and of course, HDboth of which were worth it to me. Watching the movie on BluRay was such a wonderful improvement, but the goriness was certainly more ""in your face."" The BluRay version had a couple of things that I didn't have on my DVD, but then again my DVD of the movie is quite ancient.

There is no commentary by the Director Steven Spielberg. That's disappointing, but that's his policy. In addition, the extras (except for a couple of trailers) are all in standard DVD definition.

Also, there is no Digital Copy that you can save to iTunes or other movie management system. This is disappointing, as I watch movies on my computer and iPad, so I wish I had it. I'll have to buy the digital version eventually.

Anyways, this is a great movie, probably the best war movie of our generation (though there is a lot of competition). The BluRay version makes it better.",1394668800,,1716,4.417721518987341

1242149,5,B00000K3AM,"This was the first movie I ever bought on DVD, and finally just replaced it on Bluray.  This is, without a doubt, my favorite Spielberg film.  This film manages to paint a very vivid world out of the most tattered Europe brought to film.  On top of that, it manages to send so many powerful messages about mankind and war.  On top of that, it brings forth the best performances I've seen out of every single actor in it.  On top of THAT, it manages to entertain the hell out of you.

It's a hard watch...moments can be tough to stomach.  This isn't a horror movie where bright red caro syrup shoots out at the camera with giddy delight.  This is realistic battle, and you feel every single bullet wound, punch, defeat, and victory.  You WILL be emotionally exhausted after this film.  And yet, you will want to watch it again, and again.

Most say that Schindler's List was Spielberg's masterpiece.  I certainly agree that it was massively important, and a work of art.  However, in terms of pure cinema storytelling...this is where the man reached his pinnacle in my opinion.",1392940800,,1076,4.570680628272251

The unrealistic parts were that the leader, the Captain played by Tom Hanks, allowed his elite soldiers to walk through enemy territory bunched close together, talking, and not paying attention to their surroundings. Further, he even asked for volunteers for a dangerous mission rather than ordering certain soldiers to go.",1392854400,,576,5.0

This one however is, in my opinion, the greatest war movie ever made, period.  The squad that this movie follows is fictional (sorry based on true story fans) but the war is very very real.  The opening scene of omaha beach by all accounts is about as accurate of a potrayal of D-Day in Normandy as you'll ever see.  This movie is brutally realistic when it comes to the sights and sounds of war, and is not for kids. I'm not afraid to say I teared up a bit at the end.

It is superb, exquisite and extremely well acted.  The landing, done on an Irush beach, looked ery much like the znormandy of June 1944.  I think the camera work of janusz Kaminski is the finest action achievement of all time.  You are there, that's all there is to it.  You LAND WITH THESE MEN,M, YOU RQACE FOR YOUR LIFE FOR THE SHINGLE, THE LOW WALL OF SAND  PROTECTING THE TOP OF YOUR HELMUT, IF EEN THAT, AND YOU PRAY TO GOD, SHAKING UINCONTROLABLELY IN FEAR.  Yoy\u are sure that you will not survive and your family's faces suddenly appear to you, in your imagination.  There is no one there to call this madness off.  You begin to cry, uncontrolably, and sob.  You can't feel your legs and you, above all, refuse to move towards the enemy.  Adancing is beyond you ability.  As you watch the terror, you see men, big, strong young men, being b lown into the air, legs and arms severed, and blood spraying everywhere.  I remember the horror of a niece who was murdered back in 1987by a rapist murderer and career criminal in Indiana.  Her case can be found on the internet, but I WILL DECLINE IDENTIFYING HER OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE DEAD.  I CAN DISTINCTLY RECALL, AS IF IT WERE YESTERDAY, that I wished this wwas all just a terrible dream, and that after I slept tonight, tomorrow thius wouold all have been just a very nad dream.  I remember, the crushing sadness I felt when I realizxed that this was not going to be the case.  I'e heard people say just that, before and now it was I who was sayingit.  I WAZS true, this is all just a horrible dream.  No, it wasn't, it WAS real.  Terribly real. And, that's how I dfeel when I see this great and epic film, THE greatest War film of all time.  If Steven Spielberg never did another thing in his career, this woulod hae been enough to assure him a place in the movie hall-of-AFSWAME.
  I SAW THIS MOVIE WITH MY SON At home in the safety of our house and yet it scared the daylightsa out of me.  I actually had trouble falling to sleep that night, as I was afraid of the dark, and had to have a small nightlite on in my bedroom.

This movie brings home to viewers the horrors of war and the travails of being a soldier. It was a little more violent than I anticipated, but the realism made it all the more poignant.

I watched this film with my teenage children. I have mixed feelings about whether that was the right thing to do or not. While I want my children to know about the tremendous sacrifices that others have made on their behalf as Americans, I'm unsure that they were ready for this level of realism. We did discuss it afterwards and it prompted many good questions on their part, so I'm hopeful that the experience of seeing this movie was beneficial to them.",1390867200,,722,4.677165354330708

Wow....Then scenes like the General reading the Lincoln letter, emotional. What got me the most, and may not get others, is when the older Ryan is kneeling in front of the the grave stone and turns and asks his wife if he has been a good man? I lost my brother, and that feeling resides within me to go on....and seeing that on screen had deep meaning for me. Great movie, so many other good things to say, except I would never allow children to see it. Its too graphic and realistic in the war scenes.

1242197,5,B00000K3AM,"""Saving Private Ryan"" brings the war home to you like few films do.  It doesn't seem to be in Spielberg's DNA to produce a clunker (We don't discuss 1941 in polite company) and he has delivered another winner.  Tom Hanks is, as always, completely believable in whatever role he takes on and he is in this one too.  This little Band of Brothers become your band of brothers and you hope they succeed in their quest with all your heart.  After a little black comedy it looks like everything is going to work out until a monkey wrench is thrown into the works.  Some people criticized the film's beginning as overly sentimental and I see their point but the film as a whole is breathtaking.  One lesson in the movie, there is no place for mercy in a war.  Watch for the proof of this statement.",1387324800,,791,4.376712328767123
1242198,5,B00000K3AM,Best adaptation of the d-day landings by far love this movie. Also recommend band of brothers for the opposite view from behind enemy lines,1387324800,,139,4.833333333333333
1242199,5,B00000K3AM,"This film always reminds me how fortunate my family is that our father, a US Army combat engineer with the 1st Special Engineer Brigade landed on Utah Beach under fire on D-Day, 6 June 1944. If he had landed on Omaha Beach in the first wave as graphically depicted in this film, he would have likely been lying there dead when Tom hanks and his Ranger company arrived.  The combat engineers were largely slaughtered on Omaha. The first 30 minutes of this film are unusually sobering to watch, just like they were in the theater when I first saw this film when it was released. I wept just like most folks did in the theater but I did so since someone that I loved dearly had to, in reality, walk and run into the German machine gun and artillery buzz saw as Tom Hank's CPT John Miller did. I had asked my Dad, who passed away ten years before this film debuted, a million times ""what was D-Day like Dad?"" when I was a kid and I felt ashamed of myself for doing so since every time I did he had to let go of the memories he was trying so hard to suppress and not give into like all combat veterans do. After seeing those first thirty minutes of this film, I didn't really need an answer anymore.

if there is a flaw in this film it is the seen where Vin Diesel's character Caparzo is killed by the German sniper while they are having a screaming match over the little French girl.  I used to watch the TV show ""Combat"" as a kid with my dad and he would always tell me how they would do things in the show that would get you killed or at least wounded if you had done them in real life during the actual war, like walking down a road or across an open field - you would always hug the tree line and roads were likely mined, and on and on. I can only imagine the ferocity of his reaction to that particular scene in this film, since I thought of him  during it and his combat gained technical advise immediately. other than that gaff, and it is a gaff, this is an excellent film as has been stated thousands of time since 1994. I just wish my Dad could have stuck around a little longer so he could have seen it for himself.

By the way, GEN Omar Bradley did a great but unintentional disservice to all of those brave men who landed on Utah Beach by describing it as a :""cake walk"". It wasn't. Fortunately, the pre-invasion aerial bombardment of the beach and the German positions behind it was more successful than it was on Omaha but they still took a lot of casualties, both KIA and wounded. Utah Beach was also the one that ""Ike"" worried about the most due to its relative isolation from the others.  Fortunately the men of the 101st Airborne, in particular the 507th PIR  whose storied accomplishments were chronicled in the Ambrose book and the HBO Series with the same name ,""Band of Brothers"", saved my Dad and the lives of lots of other GI's by spiking the guns that were shelling them.  Those guys are big heroes of mine and I actually sent their Regimental Association a thank you email that basically read...""On behalf of my two sisters, my brother, and myself, I would like to thank you all for allowing us to be born"".  They reply I received from them, since they had apparently never received a message like mine before, made me weep.

This film set a whole lot of good things in motion, including Tom Hank's incredible ""The Band of Brothers"" series, that email from me that resulted from my seeing it, the response to it I received that apparently warmed the hearts of some elderly ""Screaming Eagles"", and even greater admiration for my own Dad and the thousands of other Dads that came to not to conquer, but to liberate Europe from Nazi tyranny 69 years ago.

Calling them the ""Greatest Generation"" is no exaggeration. They represented the kind of people our founding fathers envisioned when setting up this great nation.

1242227,5,B00000K3AM,"My grandfather was a private during World War II, and though he fought in the Pacific, he was driven to tears when he saw this film during the last years of his life.  This is a film that touches people on so many levels; and by people, I don't just mean WWII vets, though they surely will be the most effected, but I mean anybody who respects those who fought to preserve America and the rest of the world for generations to come.  As this films shows, it came at a catastrophic price for all those involved.

The premise for the film is that three out of four brothers fighting in the war are killed, and the forth, James Ryan, has a ticket home.  An effort is then arranged to rescue him out of Nazi occupied France.  To risk an entire company of soldiers for one man does not flow well with many including Captain Miller, played masterfully by Tom Hanks.  At times the uselessness of the mission seems to go hand in hand with pointlessness of the war.  Both sides relentlessly fight and kill each other as normally innocent recruits become unrecognizable as killing machines.  Indeed, the incredibly violent battle scenes illustrate this as men are blown to bits, faced with machine gun fire, and put through the absolute horrors of the campaign.

It's not all blood and guts though.  We get to learn about most of the characters throughout film.  A timid Corporal who has rarely fired a gun is driven to near madness.  Even he eventually finds himself killing in cold blood near the end as everything collapses around him.  Then there's the church scene, an oasis in a desert of destruction, where we are treated to some incredible dialog by the soldiers.  Hank's Captain Miller in particular is a very well rounded character who must not only face adversity from the enemy but also from his own men who constantly label the mission as FUBAR (****** up beyond all recognition).

Steven Spielberg's direction is nearly flawless.  The use of filters to make the battle scenes dim and dreary is especially effective as is the somber score when it pops up from time to time.  The sad, bleak tone is offset by a metaphorical light.  The soldiers hope everything will be better and they can get back to their lives at home---if only they can make it through the war alive.

War is not a beautiful thing.  So naturally this film is not beautiful in the sense that there are colorful flowers and blue skies everywhere.  War is not about that.  War is horrific.  The pointlessness of the violence, which is a product of war, is the madness.  There is nothing mad, however, about wanting to fight for your freedom and the freedom of others.  I think that's what this film was all about.",1379548800,,2681,4.570230607966457

1242258,5,B00000K3AM,"Saving Private Ryan is about a band of brothers who give up their own lives to save the life of a single soldier in the chaos of war. The Controlling Idea, that brotherhood is worth dying for, is well told and thematically supported. The contradictory notion of risking the lives of many to save the few resonates well with the idea of war in general: that the values of freedom, family and human rights are ideals worth dying for: even if these values are preserved only for a few survivors. The hope is the survivors (and the viewers) can go on to live a good life and treasure their freedoms that others died to protect. The question is that in a democracy where human rights and freedoms are valued, why would anyone in their right mind choose to sacrifice their life and limb? The answer: these soldiers choose to do it to protect a brother, and these armies choose to do it to protect the basic human rights of the citizens of fellow nations. This seems to suggest that the very fabric of democratic society rests on the fundamental respect for each other and the rights of others and that these rights and freedoms are ideals that much be protected to the death.

Great film told with what I count to be three major external plots: to save Ryan, to win the war and to save the lives of the men. The lives of the men are lost to achieve the first two. Thus proving the Controlling Idea that brotherhood is worth dying for.

My major complaint is the film is too long. Three hours is a long time and the episodes of peace are not so interesting since not much relationship or personal development takes place. The brothers are ""good"" from beginning to end and their relationships are ""good"" from beginning to end. Of course there are minor plotlines like Opum's compassion for POWs and Reiben's questioning of Miller's judgement. But they don't create serious turning points in an otherwise external-action focused story. I think the story would look substantially the same if you cut out the middle: the Carparso dying to save a French child, the radar assault that loses Wade and the church resting.

1242288,5,B00000K3AM,"My grandfather drove a Higgins Boat to Omaha Beach on D-day, I believe the sector of beach was ""easy green"" from his transport the  USS Thurston (AP-77). He was still alive when this movie came out and I saw it in the theater and told him about it. He had no desire to see it just as he had no desire to be around fireworks ""they sound too much like the real thing"" he would say. When I described the opening scene of the film he expanded on things he had told me when I was a child. 1000 yards off shore the waves churned red with blood,  as soon as his ramp lowered half the men on his craft were shot in the first wave, they started going over the side struggling with weighed down packs. He returned to the Thurston after the 1st Wave only to be told he had to go in the 2nd wave because they had lost 3 boats and their coxswains in the first. He honestly believed he would die , he was 19yrs old, he had volunteered at 17 and left for boot camp on his 18th birthday. I would say based upon the first hand account I heard of the landing by  him that that opening scene is very accurate.  The rest of the movie is a story and I have no way to gauge how accurate it is, but I feel at least the beach invasion gives me a glimpse of the horror my grandfather witnessed as a very  young man an event that helped shape the wonderful man he became and also drove every decision he made morally, politically and ethically the rest of his life. D-day was just one of four invasions he had a front row seat for.  He was 18 at the North African invasion and  20 in the last at Okinawa .

It's not perfect; an argument can be made for chopping out the last scene at the cemetery to improve the movie.  It also fluctuates between being anti-war and a straight war movie.  But the acting is superb, the battle scenes are fantastic and Tom Hanks deserved an Oscar.

I have seen cuts of the movie -- usually on HBO -- where the editing could have been better.  In the climactic battle at the end of the movie, there were some clear editing miscues:  When Sizemore's running back over the bridge, from two different angles the camerman is in the frame.  And when Ryan (Damon) shows Miller (Hanks) how to arm the mortar rounds and toss them, a grenade is clearly seen on Miller's belt as he's heaving the much heavier mortar round.  I would think the grenades would be easier to use.

Still, this is one of the best war movies ever filmed.  It's just not perfect.",1367712000,,938,4.529761904761905

The quality of this edition is average. It's a movie that wasn't filmed in high definition and thus does not come across as a super high quality production. I've seen other blu rays that have bumped up the production of older movies but this one barely has any noticeable quality increases. The subtitles are, however, of blu-ray quality which is nice (nicer font that has clean lines and a dark outline so it shows up better in any background).

A disappointing situation, someone just scored a free bluray (congratulations by the way, you probably don't even know what bluray is) and now I have to pay to get another. I thought. Well after reaching Amazon by telephone, the lady on the line apologized and assured me they would take care of me at no charge. She even over-nighted my new copy so I didn't have to wait. I couldn't be happier with the customer service for resolving this issue so gracefully.

The movie of course is great. If you haven't seen it yet, you've only had 15 years to watch it, and you ought to pick it up as soon as possible.

1242332,5,B00000K3AM,"I've heard it said Spielberg lacks subtlety but to me a Spielberg movie is an experience, as is Saving Private Ryan. It's never just about the drama and this one isn't just about war. I haven't seen half of the films Spielberg has directed, so I must have something to look forward to. I did watch his first film, Duel, on TV as a young adult, probably in it's debut. Perhaps that simple film, Duel, Was just about the action on screen. It was a good film. At least I, and a teenage buddy who was also watching the film, at his house, both liked the movie.

A friend claims if you ever want a book made into a movie, Steven Spielberg will tell the exact tale written on paper. Perhaps capturing the spirit as well. He did a wonderful tribute to Stanley Kubrick in Artificial Intelligence. I wonder if we see more of Spielberg here in Saving Private Ryan?

The most memorable scene to me is when an American GI is about to be stabbed to death by a German soldier. Alone in a hand to hand struggle with a German soldier, the American GI begins asking the German questions. It stood out to be because I recognized this, probably from my own childhood. The GI was asking questions, like children do, at least like I did, to try and delay the oncoming punishment, in this case, death. The German soldier himself seems to recognize this and talks to him in English like a child, however, when the German puts him to sleep he really puts him to sleep. To me, anyway, this drama was making a statement. When you punish a child, in a sense you are killing them. What better place to 'enlighten' us than a war movie? The lesson taught by war is that sacrifices must be made, even the ultimate sacrifice. War is hell. By comparison, the duty of work is expected to be relatively easy.

When the scene is over, the German soldier walks out, away, and he's faced with another chance to kill American soldiers. Whether having proven himself or sorry for the murder he had to commit, he simply walks away. The killing is done for the day, and perhaps, hopefully, done. This scene kind of reminded me of a science fiction story I had read many years ago. In the SciFi story, after battles take place in space, the surviving ships, scavenging the ships they had just destroyed, wouldn't fire on the enemy survivors, not wanting to 'jeopardize their survivor status'. The story was named 'Boomer Boys on New Alabama'. Whether the story influenced this scene in Saving Private Ryan is questionable, although I think it likely Steven Spielberg has read this story.

This is one of my all time favorite movies. I love war movies. This one is moving, riveting as the pro movie reviewing big wig dorks say, touching, of course exciting because its war. Tom Hanks does once again blow us away with an amazing protagonist performance. What is there to say? If you are into the genre and haven't seen it you must have been living on another planet for the past 14 years. Even after 14 years this film is amazing. For $5 I knew this was a steal.

1242363,5,B00000K3AM,"I've wanted this movie on blu ray since I got my player, which was recently, so I've just begun the experience with blu ray, and I just got this version last night, and watched last night, and was blown away at the quality of this release, I'm not going to speak about the movie itself, fans of this movie already know how great it is, my focus is on the product, and this is just a beautiful transfer, the DVD looked really good, but this is a huge step up in my eyes, and while I do agree with other reviewers stating that this is a movie that should look raw like the DVD, but man, this just looks so good, it still has that grainy touch to it as Spielberg intended, which I agree with, but even with that, the picture is just outstanding, right off on D-Day, Omaha Beach, just look at the boats coming onto the beach, and the bunkers and all, it just looks amazing, and the bullets flying through the air, the uniforms, the weapons, you can just see every little detail, and once Miller and his crew set out to get James Ryan, the grass, the weeds, the land just jumps right out at you, so bright and vivid that it feels like you're out there with them, which is what a film should do to you, bring you to the moment, and this one does.

And the audio, like, wow, it is just in your face, D-Day will sound like a bomb just went off near your house, I'm not kidding either, I mean the DVD had a great audio track, but this one here will just rock you, the machine guns, the bombs coming in and hitting, the water, the cantenes, the actors voices, the sounds in the backround, the score, I just can't say enough about how good it sounds, you will hear things that you didn't on the DVD, but it's not overdone, what I mean is, there is no point where the audio goes over the top, it's right where it needs to be.

Now the extra features, there is no new ones, what you get is basically all the extras that have been on the former DVD versions, I have the 60th Anniversary Commemorative edition, and it did NOT have 'Shooting War' which is a nice lengthy documentary hosted by Tom Hanks himself, it clocks in at 1 hour and 30 minutes, so that was a nice surprise for me, since I had not seen that, I think that was on a different DVD version, now the features are not in HD, except for the two trailers which is kind of disappointing, but I can deal with that, with how great they've done on this transfer, they made up for the lack of new extras and not transfering them to HD, so minor complaint for me.

Now I've read that early releases of this particular edition did have its problems with being out of sync about 2 hours into the movie, it has been fixed, according to former reviewers here, the way to tell is to look at the UPC code on the back, if it's yellow, then you should be good, mine is yellow, and I watched it all the way through last night, and I had no problems with it, so I'm glad, so if you buy this at a local store, look for the color of the UPC on the back, if it is yellow, than chances are you got the right one, I'm sure all the bad ones have been pulled by now, but to be safe, check, thats what I did before I bought it.

Paramount has done a hell of a job with the Sapphire Series, I have 'Gladiator' 'Braveheart' and 'Saving Private Ryan' both Gladiator and this look and sound fantastic with nice extras, I have yet to watch my Braveheart, but when I do, I will be back to review it, I can't wait!",1353974400,,3431,4.086053412462908

1242378,5,B00000K3AM,"This review is about Saving Private Ryan in the context of its inclusion on the revised AFI Top 100 Film listing. It was not eligible for the first listing, which finalized in 1996. But as soon as the AFI redid their 10th anniversary ranking, Saving Private Ryan faulted into the #71 spot, right in there with many beloved classics such as Casablanca and Citizen Kane. It was just that powerful.

On the first AFI listing, classics such as All Quiet on the Western Front and Patton gave us our view of war. Yes, War is Hell. Yes, there are good and not-so-good actions going on on both sides of the dividing line. But Saving Private Ryan brought this story to an entirely new level of cinematography. We weren't just watching a stage performance of how hard war can be. We were there, viscerally, in the deep of things, watching the world shake into pieces around us. We were shell-shocked from the sound, overwhelmed with the carnage, and watched as step by step our views on morality were eaten away.

It is stunning just how many amazing actors are in here. Even small parts are played by actors who in other movies would take the leading role. Ted Danson. Nathan Fillion. Vin Diesel. They are everywhere. Every character has grounding and reality and personality.

And these aren't all ""super-beings"" either. They have faults and weaknesses. They make mistakes. They trip up. Part of the joy of watching (and rewatching) the film is connecting with their humanity.

I do have to point out that it seems as if there are only two brief appearances by women in the entire, long movie. The mom who crumples wordlessly to the ground when she realizes how her world has just been changed. The transcriber who realizes that three men in the same family have just been slain. And that's it. I suppose Ryan's wife at the end makes a brief comment. Certainly I know this is a movie about war - but people complained about Patton having no speaking women at all. Here we are, decades later, and our progress is that a woman or two are allowed to say a few words each. I'm not quite sure if that's progress. Other war movies show how critical women were to the war effort and to how intertwined they were in what was going on. Here, we barely know they exist.

Still, if we're going to complain about that, we'll have to complain about so many movies that fall into this same trap. I think the only speaking woman in Platoon was a Vietnamese woman who said a few lines in Vietnamese. Clearly we have a long way to go.

So, that all being said, Saving Private Ryan is an incredible movie, and well worth watching.",1348185600,,2604,4.529787234042553

1242381,5,B00000K3AM,"A man and his family walk into a military cemetery in France along the beaches of Normandy.  He falls to his knees as he remembers his actions during the war and the deaths of his comrades.  The movie flashes to the past and he sees the landing of amphibious carriers heading to the Normandy shoreline.  The Germans have fortified the beach to be impregnable from invasion.  The slaughter is horrendous and the ocean beach is red with blood.

The government finds out that 3 of the 4 Ryan brothers are killed within a few days of each other.  They send in a special unit lead by Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) to find and bring back the fourth brother, Private James Francis Ryan to be sent home. The team goes into the war with a mission to find him but along the way they encounter the war in its worst and the story is about their experiences....

This is an excellent movie and it brings the horrors of war to the front of your mind.  You see what our troops had to sacrifice during the war.  It is a good story based in the most horrific background of a deadly war.  This movie is one of the most intense movies I have ever watched and its realism is what makes the story so powerful.

I recommend this movie to you as a first class movie and it should be in your collection.  I have to tell you that this movie is violent and shocking.  Just be prepared to see the horrors of war.  This movie should be a 10 star movie but the scale only goes to 5.",1346630400,,1455,4.18705035971223

1242393,5,B00000K3AM,"I picked up the Sapphire BR SPR a month ago and finally got around to watching & hearing it. First I still have the DVD DTS version so I was currious as to the upgrade in the video but also how the two audio tracks compared; DTS vs DTS-HD.

The video transfer is an excellent upgrade over the DVD though it still retains some of that so-called documentry grainess in some areas as it was intended. The colors are as they should be in the pallete of War....greens, browns, greys, blacks and yes red. It's going to make you say...Wow in the sense like seeing Monsters,Inc or Avatar. But the details throughout in uniforms, buildings, people, weapons brings the realism of war closer than ever. Probably too close especially in the famous ""Beach Scene"" where the reality of what rel war probably was with body parts flying and exposed.

The audio portion didn't disappoint and frankly will rock your house and senses. There are many forums and topics that are always asking,""What Blu-ray to show off your HT"" and about every poll and answer will have Saving Private Ryan on that list. Even when it came out on DVD with the DTS format it was considered one of if not the best sounding movie to make use of you HT sound. The new DTS-HD track does deliver a more fuller and open sound than the normal DTS track which is no slouch itself. To me it was like comparing D.D 5.1 to DTS 7.1. I felt I could detect just more sounds in the lower and higher fequencies with just better details. The first 20-25 minutes of the movie is a must for audio fans.

The movie itself is flat out good but it's no typical war movie like Patton, Battle of the Buldge, Tora-Tora-Tora or Midway. While those were of historical happenings they didn't deal with the real brutality and emotions of what War can bring. In Saving Private Ryan you see and feel it and it hits you squarely between the eyes. If no-one comes away with some gut check, heart wrentching, or a slight tear in the first 25 minutes of this movie they're either dead or comatose.

Tom Hanks as Capt. John Miller, is given orders to go deep and locate one Private Ryan and bring him back when it's learned three of his brothers were all killed in one week. During their mission they encounter others caught up with war itself, the uncertainity and just trying to survive. They lose a few of their own while seeing the effects on both soldiers and cilvans. While the Beach Scene is as emotional as you can see the one with Wade the medic getting shot is just gut wrentching. Laying bleeding from several bullets the entire groupsitting around Wade, is scrabbling to plug the holes and stop the blood flow while asking Wade for directions on what to do. You can sense their hope fading and helplessness as their friend crys out for his Moma and doesn't want to die for several minutes which seems longer.

They finally find someone who knows Ryan and about where he is. After locating Ryan and giving him the news they expect he'll follow but Ryan refuses saying he has orders to protect one of two bridges left and his current platton buddies are now ""his only brothers"". Facing lack of ammo, soldiers and against all odds, Miller (Hanks) takes control and decides on protecting the bridge. The ensuing Last Stand of the Alamo type battle in the town is close and brutal with several losing their lives in the process. Miller, always keeping Ryan out of harms way is shot while trying to retrive the detonator for the bridge. At the last minute everyone is saved by a pair of P-51's along with reinforcements. Hanks wound is fatal but not before telling Ryan,""earn this...Earn It"". As the film returns as it did in the beginning the older Ryan asks his wife has he led a good life and been a good man while standing in front of Capt. Millers tombstone.

It's hard to imagine those saying anything bad about this movie are calling it ""over-rated"". They probably have a negative outlook on anything military and war itself as it's a waste of money first and lives second. While it was a movie veterans praised the film as the most realastic depiction of war especially the Normandy landing.

1242395,1,B00000K3AM,"We cannot begin to understand why Dreamworks & Paramount would release this blu-ray!  The video quality is supposed to be better on blu-ray than DVD but in this case, IT IS NOT! Not only is it not better, it's downright horrible!  The picture is downright grainy and the lighting in many of the scenes is very streaky and... well, just horrible!  In the very beginning you can see how grainy it is when the guy is walking into the cemetery with his family.  We thought at first, maybe they meant to do that?  The next very noticeable mess-up is when they gain control of the beach.  The light coming off the fires streaks way up & down the screen.  Next is when they realized that Private Ryan was the last of the brothers in the office where they are typing the letters for the family.  When they meet inside the closed office, the light from the windows makes the whole screen faded, like a backlight issue.  After about an hour of messing with my Blu-ray players settings and the TV settings with no luck, we looked at the reviews & find that others have had the same problem.  I noticed someone saying something about the color of the barcode... We have one with a yellow barcode so that does NOT mean it's a corrected version.  Unfortunately we didn't watch it right away so we couldn't return it to Amazon. :o(  We are very disappointed in the studios for putting this movie out, when they know it's messed up.

1242400,5,B00000K3AM,"I already have this on DVD, but wanted to add to my small collection of films that I think are worthy of Blu-ray. I got this and am glad I did. The difference between the DVD and Blu-ray versions is remarkable. The transfer quality is excellent, with just enough grain to give it an 'historical' feel. Colors are much brighter and crisper on this Sapphire Series Blu-ray than on regular DVD, and the audio is outstanding. You're really missing a lot if you don't run the audio through a home theater system.

The movie itself is an incredibly compelling visual and storytelling masterpiece by Steven Spielberg, one of the great war movies of all time. I'm not a big war movie buff, but this one is special. The first half hour, which is an incredibly gut-wrenching portrayal of the invasion of Omaha Beach, is some of the most harrowing and realistic war re-creation footage ever filmed. The first time I saw this movie, the Omaha Beach sequence left me stunned and in tears.

There's hundreds of reviews here that describe the movie's plot at length so I won't add to what is already there. Suffice it to say that after the thunderous opening sequence, the movie continues to shine.

There are twelve special features included in this two-disc set, ranging from a ""making of"" feature to a couple of simple trailers. Total running time of the extras is about three and one-half hours, and it's all worth watching, especially the feature-length historical documentary on WWII war filming.

This Sapphire Series edition of Saving Private Ryan is the best edition of the movie that I know of, and it's currently at a great price. If you've been waiting to get this phenomenal movie on Blu-ray, now is the time to do it!",1327968000,3,1716,4.691029900332226

The cast is amazing, and even if your not a War movie fan, i think its a movie anyone who appreciates a greatly thought out and well casted movie can enjoy.

The Sound and Video quality is by far one of the best in my opinion you can get on blu ray. if anything else, buy this to really work your TV and home theater speakers so you can truely appreciate what you haev spent your hard earned money on.

1242403,5,B00000K3AM,"I own the original DVD of the movie and just watched the Sapphire Blu Ray edition.  While I thought the original was excellent and with DTS audio, it should be, the Blu Ray is a worthy addition to your collection.  Without the need to summarize the plot, after all, this is not a book report, the video was without grain or noise at any point.  Even the darkest blacks and shades of gray were noiseless.  While I did not put on my original DVD, I recall that that was also a beautifully produced disc whose audio was outstanding.  The Sapphire version is certainly its equal and may be superior.  While still retaining the DTS HD audio and pretty much the same collection of extras, the use of the front surrounds was fantastic and the rear surrounds nearly as good.
If you don't have a copy of this excellent movie, this would be the one to get.  It is rare , in my experience, that the original is as excellent as it is, but if you already have that, than I really wouldn't say that going to this blu ray is a must have.  Never the less, glad I got it.
All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.
Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.

I agree that right out of the gate this movie is strong but the Omaha landings have a rushed ""one man army"" feel that soon takes over and then we get into the rest of the film.  From here on the movie (in my opinion) starts to fall apart.  More and more the realism is eroded until by the ending battle the movie is everything you would expect from a Hollywood blockbuster and the awe from the opening sequence has faded into memory.

The one thing that truly disturbed me about Saving Private Ryan was the shaved heads of all the German soldiers.  First, it is historically completely wrong.  German soldiers typically had much longer hair than Allied soldiers, usually medium length on top but short on the sides.  Secondly, it really cheapens the film.  Since Spielberg obviously knew better, making the German soldiers into skin heads is just a cheap propaganda device.

I really find it inexplicable as Spielberg seems so obsessed with accuracy in most other technical aspects of the film.  All in all, a VERY bad decision.",1320710400,2,684,4.947368421052632

The switch between two styles of cinematography is jarring and distracting. While that may be the point, as far as I can determine, ""Band of Brothers"" is better and more consistent visually, as a reference.

The shocking, blood-and-guts opening D-Day sequence shows war at its most brutal and heroic, and is the best part of the movie. The remaining portion of the movie seems to contain plot points lifted from the old 1960s series ""Combat!,"" (the sniper, the machine gun nest, holding the bridge, etc.) which pulled them off far better and with more engaging acting than ""Ryan.""

1242424,5,B00000K3AM,"I rented ""Saving Private Ryan"" and I'm glad I did!  When the film first came out I didn't want to see it because of the rumors of blood and guts.  And to a greater or lesser degree that is true.

Saving Private Ryan is about finding Private Ryan and getting him home, because his other brothers have all been killed.  In an unusual humanitarian move, the Army brass decided to pluck Ryan from the European theater and bring him home.

When found, he does not want to go home.  At least not yet.

We get to know Tom Hanks' character -- a former schoolteacher, now in command of a team of soldiers charged with finding Ryan.  The homage to these men was obvious.  These guys all worked together, slept together and killed together.  Somehow they hang on to some sanity as their friends die one after the other.

Special Scenes:

The change from looking at war intellectually for the man in the Translations Unit to the actual horrors of war.  It was quite a testament to not just thinking about war as a nebulous thing and actually being there and even having a gun in your hand and being face to face with the enemy.  Amazing acting.

The opening scenes of D-Day and the storming of Omaha Beach.  Many of the men were mowed down by machine gun fire before the gate even went down while they were in their invasion boats.

The death, running blood in the water and the great odds against them was horrific to behold.

Bottom Line:

The pivotal point of the war was D-Day.  As Spielberg says in the features section, if we did not win then we would have lost the war and the Holocaust would have continued and so on.  The movie, the historical context that is pushed, and clearly an anti-war film, it yet makes the point to pay homage to these men who gave their lives.

Freedom doesn't come free.  Highly recommended.

1242425,4,B00000K3AM,"In the late-90s there were two particular films that redefined their particular genres. Saving Private Ryan was one of them (the other, unfortunately, was The Matrix). Almost every war movie that followed SPR, right down to 2008's Rambo, seemed to be no more than a pastiche of Spielberg's hectic style.

SPR proves what an inconsistent filmmaker Spielberg can be. The man has had his fair share of misfires (Hook, anyone?) but this was his last truly great effort. War of the Worlds and Munich were good, though hardly as revolutionary, but The Terminal, Catch Me If You Can, and the movie that called itself Indy IV were all just too gutless and inoffensive. You'd never believe they were from the same director if you didn't know better.

A lot of critics have repeatedly praised SPR over the years, but they all praise the same things (the documentary style, the realism, etc.) Simultaneously, a lot of people have dismissed it as shallow, badly-written, and void of any thrills beyond the 30-minute mark. But look beneath the surface and you'll find that SPR does actually have a tight screenplay, despite going through the motions on few occasions. The wide and diverse cast (including Paul Giamatti, Ted Danson, Dennis Farina, and Dale Dye) do good with the material. It's refreshing for a war movie to move beyond the 'point of view of one man' clich&eacute;.

Janusz Kaminski's desaturated, gritty, high-shutter-speed photography is full of deep blacks and high contrast. This look has been imitated to death over the years, but coupled with Spielberg's hurried, almost unscripted approach to the action it adds an element of authenticity to the film that the copycats have not been able to emulate.

You really have to feel for all those poor soldiers who were massacred on Omaha Beach (all men, I should point out). But what a badly planned mission. No flack jackets, no smoke screens to cover their landing...warfare has come so far in 65 years, it would be insane to send so many hundreds off to die like that now. Many of them were pure cannon fodder and the Military knew it. The film certainly does not hold back on the bloody carnage. Most WWII movies up until that point were sanitized and bloodless. Hardly realistic at all!

The 169 minute running time passes fairly quickly. The film certainly doesn't deserve the criticism that nothing interesting happens after the beach invasion. As it has been imitated many times since, some of then innovative moments (such as the silent 'war is hell' amid battle chaos - which this film does three times!) have become clich&eacute;s, but don't judge SPR for it.

The film won 5 Oscars, but lost the Best Picture award to Shakespeare in Love, which is absolutely insane. I mean...what were they thinking??? SPR is most certainly a classic, and one of the most innovative and important war films of the past two decades, while Shakespeare in Love is largely forgotten.

The Blu Ray looks superb in 1.85:1 1080p. Janusz Kaminsi's photography looks just brilliant, and the sound design has to be heard (preferably at a high volume) to be believed. Loads of extras are included too.",1307836800,,3138,4.876172607879925

1242427,2,B00000K3AM,"I caught a part of this movie and pretty much didn't like what I saw.

In screenwriting there's a flaw called ""On the nose"" dialog.  interesting dialogue is often oblique. Someone says, ""How are you?"" and the other guy answers, ""Say, you got a extra smoke?""  If the other guy says, ""Fine, how are you?"" that's on the nose dialog. The movie, of course, didn't have any of this, but it had dialog distantly related to ""On the nose"" dialog, often delivered by Tom Hanks. Mind you, in all other respects the dialog was brilliant ... but that's just it -- too damn brilliant ... on the nose brilliance. Hanks was too damn brilliant. He was superman, Oscar Wilde, James Bond and Tom Hanks rolled in room. Renaissance man. All-knowing ... Godly. It was like he knew throughout the movie he was going to win the Oscar already.

Mind you, lots of what he did was pure genius. Like all great actors, Hanks has a way of zeroing in on the absolutely correct tone and inflection. His voice dips and rises exactly where it should. Lines that are supposed to sound like off-handed after thoughts sound like off-handed after-thoughts, and that takes tremendous skill.

But still his character was a cardboard one -- a brilliantly drawn cardboard one, but a cardboard one nonetheless.

Also, in the brief part of the movie I saw, I witnessed an unevenness that made me shake my head in disappointment. It's the great scene of the Intelligence corporal told to get his gear because he was joining Hanks combat patrol. Well-done and comical. The kid is frightened to death. He tries to explain to Hanks that he's not trained for that kind of work, that he hasn't fired a rifle since basic training. Great! Engaging subplot and I looked forward for it being developed, but a few minutes later while on patrol he's relaxed and joking. What the faa? Why wasn't the fish out of water theme better developed?

Finally, the focus on Tom Hanks was a bad idea too. Combat movie is about teamwork. The movie is titled Private Ryan, but it really should have been called ""A movie made to get Tom Hanks his long-overdue Oscar.""

Also, as an ex-enlisted man, I didn't like the way an officer was portrayed as King and everyone else as his subjects. Captains generally didn't go out on patrol and when they did they weren't as combat savvy as the guys who did it every day. Yet Captain Tom Hanks was like a bigger version of Tom Cruise -- the best always in every situation all the time, a Dr. Phil in combat gear.

I like combat movies but have no desire to see this movie in its entirety.  Right off, I could tell it didn't have the inspired genius of Apocalypse Now! or some of the other greats.",1307750400,4,2666,4.512448132780083

Film:  4.5/5, Picture Quality:  5/5, Audio Quality:  5/5, Extras:  4/5, Overall:  5/5

Quality:

This Blu-Ray is great; the picture does show some extremely fine film grain, a few white specks here and there, and some very faint scratches. Most of it is barely noticeable unless you really look for it; the image overall is extremely sharp and detailed, and darn near perfect. Chances are that the grain/noise may be in the director's intent, as is the gray and dull colors. Sound quality is awesome.

There is a plentiful amount of extras, taking up a second disc in this set.

My copy came with a slipcover.

Film:

Truly a war film for the ages. The battles are long, bloody, and intense. In between, each scene is loaded with tension and suspense. In every scene, there's immaculate detail that showcases war (and the battle of Omaha beach specifically) in the most realistic light possible. It's close to three hours long, but at least half of it is devoted to the incredible battle sequences. A combination of stylistic cameramanship and sound effects help immerse the audience in the shoes of the soldiers, and it has to be seen to be experienced.

The story for this is fine and dandy, and is a serviceable platform for shuffling the characters along their journey. It's also integral for diving into some strong themes concerning the war, the human spirit, and philosophy. The film takes every intellectual advantage of the story's nuances, and with a cast of quality characters, the film does have plenty of strengths.

One problem I have is the plausibility of the story. No way in heck would the Army risk eight men to rescue one, regardless of the circumstance. Surely, if they did this for Ryan, why not everybody else suffering from losses? Then, who would be left to fight? Singling out one soldier just never made sense to me. Incidentally, it didn't make sense to the story's characters either, and as they discuss and find the value in the issue, the story works in its own bizarre way.

Additionally, the scene in the middle of the film (where the soldiers charge after a target of opportunity) struck me as dumb and unnecessary. The main character became uncharacteristically arrogant at this point, and the scene overall felt out-of-place. I almost suspect that it could have been removed from the film completely. I'm also not fond of the film's commemorative beginning and closing; it strikes me as manipulative and overly-sentimental.

Otherwise, the film is exceptionally strong. Despite some herky-jerky cameramanship, I do love the photography throughout; there are lots of intimate close-ups and interesting long-shots, they are all full of detail. Acting is really good; Tom Hanks is the man, Tom Sizemore is not bad, Edward Burns is cool, I loved Barry Pepper's role, Matt Damon is surprisingly strong, and it's interesting seeing Vin Diesel in the mix. Writing has a lot of interesting and bright moments. Production value is very strong, with highly-detailed and seemingly-realistic sets, props, costumes, locations, vehicles, weapons, and everything. Music is a little overly-sentimental at times, but good in other parts.

Recommended.

1242433,5,B00000K3AM,"What a great tribute to the Greatest Generation.  The young men (boys) that stormed the beaches of Normandy, in 1944, were committed to freedom, and willing to make a difference.  My father was a part of this Great Crusade.  He was involved in intelligence and communications.  He recounted to me that on the evening of June 4th, the men were excited to go.  They wanted to ""get the job done"" and take down Hitler's empire.  The men were EXCITED.  How many of our young people today, would be as excited to go and do a job--even with the knowledge that some would not come back?  Far fewer than in 1944.
I have been so proud of the part that my father played.  Small as it may have been, it was the small contributions, made by 100's of thousands of dedicated men and women, that made the difference.
Spielberg and Hanks hit a homerun with this film.  I really loved the ""action-camera,"" as if you were really there.  It brought a reality to that great day that none have been able to depict.  The story was great--men giving their all to save ONE man.  I have to say that my heart races everytime I watch the first part of the movie, and that tears fill my eyes at the end.  My favorite line, ""Ryan, . . . earn this!""  This is something that needs to be told to our young people today.
GREAT, GREAT MOVIE!!",1302566400,2,1307,4.299180327868853
1242434,5,B00000K3AM,"This is my favorite movie of all time.  It came out almost 11 years ago which is what makes this blu-ray transition so amazing.  It doesn't look Speed Racer or Dark Knight good, but what they did to clean up the visuals give it a stunning makeover.  The sound on a 5.1 Dolby system will make your ears tingle it's that good.  Now as far as the story and all goes for those who may not have seen it but have heard of it before - This is our generation's (18-35) war movie.  For some it was Rambo for some it was Full Metal Jacket, this takes the violence of Rambo and takes it to the 10th power.  There was originally talk of pulling it from theaters it was so violent.  It's not over the top Sin City or Kill Bill violent though, this movie aims to show you what it's really like when a bullet hits you or a shrapnel grenade explodes in your vicinity.  In short it makes you realize war is hell and leaves you wanting to never experience it.  Also to the youngsters who may read this review and look at it as a boring Tom Hanks movie, nothing like it at all.  If you have ever played a WWII FPS this is where they all got their inspiration from, seriously there are scenes from Call of Duty, Brothers In Arms, and Medal of Honor that are ripped straight from this movie.  Can't say enough good stuff about it stop reading this and go watch it already.",1301702400,,1351,4.137931034482759

1242442,5,B00000K3AM,"I'd love to address just one issue in the film (I have watched the DVD version of ""Saving Private Ryan when it first came out) - and that is the number of soldiers walking on the field before and after Private Caparzo (Vin Diesel) was killed in a French village by a German sniper.

With my keen eyes, I noticed the total number of soldiers (including Captain Miller) on their way to find Private Ryan (Matt Damon) was eight before they reached the French village where Private Caparzo was killed.  However, I was surprised that the number of solders (again including Captain Miller)was still the SAME - eight!

I think Spielberg or whoever was in charge must be ""careless"" in this regard.  It may be that Spielberg used the same footage before and after the death of Caparzo, to save money I guess.

Overall, I love this movie.

I'd love to know if Spielberg has fixed this error in the film before I consider upgrading my DVD version to Blur Ray.  I'm kind of a perfectionist, especially when it comes to collecting Spielberg's impeccable films.

1242446,5,B00000K3AM,"Let me start by saying; I BOUGHT a 300 dollar blu-ray player for this (not really, but by the end of the movie, it felt like it). This movie is as close as you can get to a perfect war movie. It follows Captain Miller with his stuggle to find Pte. James Ryan who's brothers have all been killed, and since all of the men in the family have died, the family name ""Ryan"" must not fade away, so him and his squad are sent to rescue him. The first scene, the D-Day scene was as real as the actual thing to me. And if I'm not proving my point enough, I watched this with my grandfather, who is a Juno Beach veteran (not to mention my brother who served 2 years in Iraq). He litterally had to LEAVE the room because it gave him ""vivid"" memories of landing on the beach under heavy German gunfire. In other words, this is REALLY accurate, so accurate, it made a veteran who lived through the real thing cry and leave the room. So, Miller and his squad drudge through Normandy hedgerow when they come across a platoon of paratroopers of the 101st Airborne, the division Ryan is in. They think they've found him, but no. The emotion in that one scene to me is phenominal. In the end, I don't care how hardened you are, how careless or thoughtless, least-centimental you may be, the last words Miller says as he's dying there in the ruined street, ""Earn this, earn it."" You are guarenteed to cry.",1294012800,2,1386,4.273764258555133
1242447,5,B00000K3AM,"This is a story based on the D Day Invasion by the allies on the Mainland of Europe in the Country of France using true events of that invasion to build a story that I suspect is similar to the ""Sullivan"" Brothers lost on a Navy tragedy during the same war and not based on historic fact as the Pvt. Ryan segment is told however times and many events are true surrounding that story.

It is a masterpiece of films, technical advisors were actual soldiers that took part in that event in the 1940's and survived it, that is why all was done realistically and it wasn't a ""Hollywood Special Effects"" contest from scene to scene or over any films to that date, it was as it was in the days of the war, nothing more and nothing less.

It was symbolic of the ""Greatest Generation"" That Ever Lived and hats off to Stephen Spielberg for his masterpiece without comparison.

1242451,5,B00000K3AM,"I lost an uncle and a cousin to that war, both dead before I was born.  My Mom taught me to pray for them as a boy, and I found myself connected to them as if I had known them despite them being KIA in 1944.  After talking to some of the vets who fought in their units and survived, and talking to my own father, a Marine, another cousin who flew in B-17s, and my Father in law, who also fought from North Africa to DDay to the end,in all the European campaigns, I found a deep respect for the things they went through.  And those I talked to, to a man, never bragged about any of their medals or valorous deeds.  ""I was just doing my job"" and ""The real heroes didn't come home"" are among what I was told.  Of course, some came home wounded for life, and some despite not being too badly injured, were mentally scarred(like my Father in law, who often during the 60 years afterward, woke up from sleep screaming and wet with sweat)Seeing in 2002 the actual D Day and other European battlefields, where one can still sometimes find over 60 year old bunkers, parts of the Siegfried line, grenades, bullets, parts of uniforms, and other military detritous, makes me wonder how any of them ever were able to come home.  We have a duty as those who came after them to both honor them, remember the hell they endured to give us what we have, and to never let the evils that led to that horrible war fester and grow back into a new conflict.

As to the movie, the hell the vets and the fallen endured is like no movie can ever convey to viewers.  But it's the closest, based upon what I've been told, and what I've seen, we'll ever get to being among those men who went into that war.  I can tell you, from hearing from a man who saw and witnessed my uncle die after being strafed by machine gun bullets, and seeing the movie, that the deaths depicted were very close to real.  While the constant re-playing of this masterpiece have made it, for me, somewhat more movie than real, as I felt seeing it in the theater, it still packs a punch, visceral, and for anyone who hasn't yet seen this, please watch it on DVD uninterrupted.  As one who has lost two close family in that war, it is so close to what I saw and have heard that I can't help but cry every time I see it...it brings home those sacrifices given by young men a long time ago and gives those like me a way to mourn them. And I find that helps me to do justice for them. Even if you're too young to have a direct connection to WW II, this will help you to step into their shoes for a couple of hours and then realize what they did for you.  It in no way ""glorifies war"" but does give us a sense of appreciation, which is much needed.  A wonderful work of art; I can't see why it didn't win the Best Picture award that year.",1292112000,3,2779,4.124074074074074

When I watched this movie I was at once shocked by the horror these troops met on that beach head. So many being slaughtered inside the landing crafts before they could even reach shore. The sounds of rounds striking all around them, The ocean literally turned into blood from all these fallen heros. Once you get past the initial shock of the horror these brave men faced on that beachhead, then comes the mission. Tom Hanks character Captain John MIller is assigned to find a Private Ryan, and get him back home. Ryan unaware that he has lost three brothers to the war is found by Tom Hanks Character and his patrol. The mission has cost them dearly and now their faced with an oncoming German attack before they can safely escort Private Ryan who is played by Matt Damien safely back from behind enemy lines. A very touching movie, you feel Tom Hanks characters pain as he watches his men give their lives to save Private Ryans,to get him back home to safty. Back home to a mother who has sacrificed so much for the war. Having only one son left out of four. Heartwarming, a very emotional movie. Great acting on Tom Hanks and Matt Damiens part indeed. You won't be disappointed, but you will be touched, and changed by this movie.

1242454,2,B00000K3AM,"When i first watched this move at the cinema, i could only retain two parts of it: the first 20 minutes, with the introductory 10 minutes being really intense, and the last 20 minutes, thanks to the sound of a detonation which plucked me from the lethargic state of half sleepiness, half tiredness i was in. But as everybody hailed the movie as being great, awesome, terrific, a masterpiece, etc. i realized it must have been a mistake, i mean, the effect of the movie on me, what a shame. I rented it two weeks later and gave myself a chance for redemption, and again it happened: this time i resisted, shook my head, washed my face, et caetera, but i then clearly realized that, apart from the first and last stages, the movie is utterly boring.

Or at least, that's my impression.

Technically, the movie is good in some parts. The action portrayed at the begining is quite decent, with some vivid details such as the ""deaf moments"" aiming to bring us closer to the sensations of a real war. The sound was great. That's why i give it two stars.

Apart from that, the movie is a waste. The plot is simplistic and unrealistic; to believe that some ""Department of War"" have taken the trouble of detecting, days after the ""D"" day, that some guy was the last living descendant of an honorable, patriotic and all-commited-to-the-country family that have sent all their five children to the miseries of war , and decided to set a mission to rescue this ""private"", it's rather absurd. The characters are hollow, you don't get a chance to get involved, psychologically, with any of them. There's not the slight intention to make an insight of ""why we are here, searching for what, for the sake of who"", it's all superficial. Merely simplistic, just an assembly of guys with a mission assigned: to rescue the innocent good while killing the ferocious bads. As simple as in a Batman comic. And the bads are the archetype of evil, the perfect bad guys, so they make the task of killing them really easy and remorseless.

Fortunately, great movies like Stalingrad and Apocalypse Now have shown us that war is more than a collection of guys with lethal weapons sweeping around other guys, labeled as ""bad"". There you get in touch with the concealed part of the war, emotions and feelings which also count. Saving Private Ryan smells like propaganda. Like brain washing. Like manipulation. It could have been a great movie, because technically speaking, it is quite well done (screenplay, etc.) but it ends in being rather pathetic.",1287705600,5,2520,4.6945701357466065

1242457,1,B00000K3AM,"Nice effects, shame about the storyline ... which could more or less be said for all Stephen Spielberg's movies. In this the boy who never grew up gives us another boy who never grew up, Tom Hanks, postulating he is a US Army Captain with a fondness for leading his men into suicidal missions, including direct attacks on bunkered machine-gun positions. Ordering them to attack tanks without dedicated anti-amour weapons is another murderous past time of his, and in the final scene he loses nearly all his men defending a bridge that should clearly have been just blown up. To make matters worse he has little control over his crew, who often openly disobey his orders and gladly murder German soldiers when they surrender with their hands in the air (if we are still hunting down old Nazis and taking them to court, perhaps someone ought to find the ex. US soldiers who seemingly committed these war crimes, as also shown in the ""Band Of Brothers"" TV series). Of course a film could be made about such a complete idiot, who probably existed in abundance, but the incredible thing here is that we as viewers are supposed to take a liking to this extremely incompetent and irresponsible officer. With Dale A. Dye as adviser we are ensured some rough battle scenes, but it all looks a lot more like Vietnam than WW2, and the fighting is often so fierce that in real life no one could have survived it (a problem Spielberg solves in the climax scene by letting the same soldiers die several times over). On top of that we get the usual symptoms of someone without a clue making a war movie, such as soldiers hiding from enemy bullets behind plank fences, not covering themselves properly behind walls, shouting at each other on patrols, preferring sentimental discussions over preparing their positions etc. etc., and of course the film gives the usual impression that WW2 was won mainly by foot soldiers, who threw themselves at enemy positions with no regard for their own lives, as if artillery, airforce, navy etc. had practically no influence on the outcome. Worst of all we are subjected to some old-fashioned John Wayne pseudo-philosophical dialogue with the music turned up in the background and the old red, white and blue waving behind the characters.

1. The Omaha beach scene, when they capture the beach, the fires that are burning seem to stretch or glow beyond where they actually are.
2. Near the end when Upham finally captures those Germans and shoots the one they let go. That scene to where he is just standing there, there is this white haze that glows and streches all over.

Anyone know what these could be from? Is this how it supposed to be?

1242469,5,B00000K3AM,"As far as I'm concerned, war films are divided into to periods: Pre-Ryan and Post-Ryan. That is pretty much it. This film is that important.

Before private Ryan war films (specifically WWII films)were very different. I'm not saying they weren't good. Some were awsome and a few downright classics but looking at it from Saving Private Ryan's perspective, it almost seems like they were movies about wars that never happened. In those movies, your survival depended on whether you were a good soldier. If you were good, no one could touch you. In those films the good guys were good and that was that. Nothing that could shine even the slightest sliver of moral ambiguity would show up. In those films, the bad guys were robots with no souls who were intent on destroying anything resembling goodness. For millions of people, this is the way WWII was fought.

 Then came Saving Private Ryan.

This film showed war as it had never been depicted: The reality of it all.(As many veterans have confirmed through their reaction to the film)The films first set piece, in which the 2nd Rangers storm Omaha Beach in Normandie is an unflinching and brutal wake up call. Good soldiers, extraordinary ones actually, die. Some didn't even had a chance to get off the boat. It wasn't about who was good or skilled. It was the luck of the draw. Maybe you die today, maybe you don't. That initial wave, in which the germans are practically using the American soldiers as target practice, shows not only the brutality of war but the frailty of man, as evidenced in the many individual reactions of soldiers Spielberg captures. We see them getting blown up,losing limbs and even guts. Suddenly, ""crying for your mama"" is not as childish or cowardly as we thought.

We also see the enemy in a whole new light. After the Rangers finally make it up the beach, some of them shoot a group of surrendering germans in a scene we would have never seen in a film before this one. At that moment the germans stop being robots and become human. ""Our guys wouldn't do that!"" would cry some but deep inside we know better. If you just saw most of your friends slaughtered, what would you do if you faced their executioners? This is the type of question this film makes you think again and again about war and what it means. But obviously gore and horror for gut and horror's sake is not what makes this film so important and relevant. In the end, it's the soldiers and the choices they make in all that chaos. Many filmakers in the past might have opted to downright ignore the chaos of war maybe out of respect. To avoid having thee soldiers looking a little less because of the things they did or witnessed but Spielberg chose to show it and the result is quite the contrary. By witnessing the true hell they went through we actually appreciate the choices they made even more. Under all of that, they chose to fight for their country and protect each other. Incredible.

I could go on but many, many people have made better reviews than this one. To think I wanted to focus more on the films transfer to BD. Now I'm running long.

To put it simply, the transfer is flawless. Spielberg has become notorious for the look of his later films which are defing by a rough, grainy, almost desaturated look. A.I. Minority Report, War of the Worlds, Munich and of course Private Ryan all have similar looks to them. (Not coincidentaly, all of them the handy work of Janus Kaminsky)I was worried that in this manic world of HD and ""grain-haters"", that the director's true intent might have been lost in a sea of noise reduction and edge enhancement. Not so. All those releases and this masterpiece in particular, retain their intended look. What HD has brought to the table is a sea of colors that I was not able to pick neither in theaters (where I saw it three times) or in all subsequent releases on home video. Now I'm, not talking about Pixar-Cars-The Incredibles kind of colors mind you. Its more subtle but very noticable. Now flesh tones look real and defined. The greens and olives (which dominate the film) look amazing and the bright colors that show up so sparingly now pop even more. Textures come alive. A scene where Mellish shares his gum with another soldier, check out the detail in their surrounding s and the barrel of the machine gun. Amazing. And all that, while retaining the original grain structure of the film. Now that is what HD is all about.

I cannot recomment this film enough and this Blu-Ray is one of the best transfers of a catalog title of 2010 if not the best so far. While I'm sure many would be dissapointed that the film doesn't look like, say, Avatar on Blu-Ray. I say they are missing the point. This is the way this film was meant to be seen.",1279152000,7,4748,4.558030480656506

The opening scenes of the landing at the beaches of Normandy are an awesome reminder of the hell that war is and the sacrifice that our soldiers paid to defend freedom.  I purchased the two disk sapphire series edition of Private Ryan because I wanted to experience the best presentation of what is probably the best movie ever produced.

I own the DVD version of this movie but I just had to get it in the Blu-Ray format.  In my opinion this is the first movie that brought real war action and images to the screen.  It set the bar to a whole new height and challenged many film makers with the task of conveying the reality of war to their audience in a more in-depth approach.

I would have to say that Blu-Ray does make a difference.  Both the sound and video quality was significantly improved.

The violence and destruction is realistic, the acting is perfect (and the actors are cast perfectly) and watching it on  blu-ray on a large screen hi-def with big audio will simply rivet you to the story.

there are two discs. one disc is the feature film and the other disc contains extras. the extras are unfortunately not in HD (except for the theatrical trailer and the re-release trailer) which seems to be a growing trend amongst movie studios. no commentary track is another sorely missed extra due to a well known fact that steven spielberg hates commentaries. what the director doesn't understand is that most people want a commentary track especially on blu-ray and it doesn't have to be the director commentating, it could be other crew members and cast members.

1242501,5,B00000K3AM,"""Saving Private Ryan"" is, by all accounts, an American masterpiece and one of the premier World War II films. Its release on Blu-Ray has been highly anticipated and, for the most part, it doesn't disappoint. First of all, the transfer is every bit as astonishingly sharp as expected. I am by no means a videophile, but there didn't appear to be a single moment of artificial enhancement of the film. The print is appropriately accompanied by a slight sheen of grain whilst still retaining a high level of detail. As far as I'm concerned this is an easy five star transfer. The film runs 2:49:28 and features audio and subtitles in English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. Prior to the menu loading are two easily skippped trailers for the ""Minority Report"" Blu-Ray and the long overdue home video release of ""The African Queen"".

There are no features on the first disc, not even a commentary track (Spielberg is well known for his dislike of commentary tracks). The special features are included on the second disc and all are presented in standard definition with the exception of the two film trailers. This is disappointing but not surprising, as it's something of an industry trend. There were no new features produced for this release, which is especially surprising considering the wealth of new high definition features that were produced for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Minority-Report/dp/B0035WTJFW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Minority Report""</a>&nbsp;Blu-Ray. The positive side is that it pulls the features from all previous DVD editions. So even if it is all in standard definition, at least the consumer is presented with the complete special features collection. Most of the titles are rather self-explanatory, but here's a complete rundown of the features:

1) ""Introduction"" (2:35) - Director Steven Spielberg discusses what attracted him to this project. This would've made more sense if it was included on the first disc with the film, as most will only put the second disc in after watching the film, thus making this more of an epilogue!

2) ""Looking Into the Past"" (4:40) - This functions as a sort of extension of the introduction, as Spielberg discusses the influences that ultimately led him to creating this film.

3) ""Miller and His Platoon"" (8:23) - This feature discusses the different personalities of the principle characters with particular focus on Tom Hank's character. Spielberg and Hanks also speak candidly about their interest in World War II in general. There's some interesting on-set footage included as well.

4) ""Boot Camp"" (7:37) - This features the great Captain Dale Dye discussing how he helped train the actors for their roles, as well as the unique boot camp the actors participated in during production.

5) ""Making Saving Private Ryan"" (22:05) - A strong making-of feature which highlights Spielberg's directing style relative to the film with some outstanding behind the scenes footage. This is far better than the typical promotional fluff studios place on video releases with a ""making of"" label attached.

6) ""Re-Creating Omaha Beach"" (17:58) - An interesting feature discussing how the crew mounted the most impressive battle scene of the film.

7) ""Music and Sound"" (15:59) - Composer John Williams discusses how he went about scoring the film.

8) ""Parting Thoughts"" (3:43) - A nice bookend feature that contains bits of interview footage with Hanks and Spielberg.

9) ""Into the Breach: Saving Private Ryan"" (25:01) - A standard behind-the-scenes feature covering production of the film. This feels like a promotional piece that was bumpered between films on television during its theatrical run. This feature was ported over from the original DVD release of the film and is in rather poor quality (even for standard definiton). I'm definitely glad they included this, but the ""Making Saving Private Ryan"" feature is far superior.

10) ""Shooting War"" (1:28:05) - Tom Hanks (in full beard, as this was filmed while ""Cast Away"" was under production) hosts this feature focusing on the men who filmed and photographed World War II. This is perhaps the strongest feature here, bolstered by plenty of amazing war footage and anecdotes from veterans.

11) Theatrical Trailer in High Definition (2:16)

12) Re-Release Trailer in High Definition (2:05)

To be fair, all the features truly do look quite excellent with the notable exception of the ""Into the Breach"" feature. I've been spoiled on the clarity of Blu-Ray, however, so it's still something of a disappointment. Aside from that, this is by far the best release of the film yet. The print is fantastic, it's a huge upgrade over the DVD, and the features are expansive and plentiful. Highly recommended!

UPDATE 05/11/10: Apparently this Blu-Ray has been recalled because of an audio sync problem that occurs after Chapter 15 (about two hours into the film). I was aware of the claims on its release date, but even after watching my copy twice I never encountered any issues. Still, for the company to take this sort of action proves the problem is indeed legitimate, so hopefully Paramount's response will be swift and painless for those who have already purchased this product.

FOLLOW-UP 05/26/10: The Blu-Ray issue has been resolved, Amazon only offers the corrected copies for sale and all other retailers should have them on the shelves now. If buying locally, the easiest way to tell the difference is to check the backside of the Blu-Ray for a yellow UPC sticker.

1242503,5,B00000K3AM,"Steven Spielberg is a master of filmmaking. If there was any doubt about that before, just watch the opening sequence of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, and there will be no doubt. The storming of Omaha Beach during Operation Overlord was, as one of the veterans who was interviewed in the previous DVD release of this film, the watershed of the 20th Century and more than likely the definitive battle of WWII. If things had turned out differently there, we may be living in a very different world right now. But the Allies were successful at taking Normandy, but at the cost of countless lives. The sequence which details the arrival on the beach to the battle up to Dog Route One is the most harrowing sequence of the horror of war that has ever been committed to film (especially taking into consideration that, according to information I've read, Spielberg actually edited that sequence in camera). In one moment, as Capt. Miller (Hanks) observes the madness and death all around him, he sees a dazed soldier wandering around looking for his own arm. I have no doubt that this is just one example of what those soldiers saw that terrifying day, and there are many more examples throughout the sequence that will be burned into your mind for many many years.

If for no other reason, this sequence is perhaps amongst the best filmmaking that Spielberg has ever done, and why this film is a classic. But the film does have its faults as well. Yes, the characters and dialogue are a little stale, and that does have an effect on the film at times. Edward Burns is the weak link of the ensemble that Spielberg put together for Miller's rescue squad. But when you have a film with great performances by Hanks, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg (whose final scene in the film is the most unsettling moment of the film), Giovanni Ribisi, Matt Damon and particularly Jeremy Davies, the faults of the film can be largely ignored.

What Spielberg did with this film is took a very run-of-the-mill brothers-in-arms war story and elevated it above the genre.

However, in 1998, there were two major WWII films released: this film and Terrence Malick's THE THIN RED LINE. While I do respect this film immensely, I found that THE THIN RED LINE was a much more effective, profound, and amazingly acted film that, in my opinion, is superior to SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, with the only exception being that Spielberg, merely from a technical standpoint, is a superior filmmaker. Again, my opinion.

One of the things about the description of the product that bothers me though is that the aspect ratio shown on the page is INCORRECT. This is an anamorphic widescreen 1:85:1 and not a scope 2:35:1.",1272844800,7,2661,4.728448275862069

1242505,4,B00000K3AM,"""Saving Private Ryan"" was one of those films that, when it first came out, every single person who saw it in theaters knew that we could no longer make war films in the same old way that we had been for the past seventy years. The battles were more bloody, the language more course, and the emotions much more vivid than anything which had been presented on screen before hand. Yet, the film itself could not avoid the inherent melodramatic ploy which Spielberg utilizes in most of his films. The good guys are still there, and the Nazis are a pretty decent focal point of evil. Unfortunately, this is the ultimate feeling of the film, which is not at all new or innovative. ""Ryan"" is thus an old fashion film with new story telling techniques attached to it in order to give the film a more visceral impact on the audience.

The film is not bad, not in the least. Yet, it seems to owe a little bit to Spielberg's past works of cinema, such as ""E.T."" and, what I think is his best film, ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"". When it all comes down to it, Mr. Spielberg is a very talented American director-- which means that his ability to tell a story is based on the entertainment value of the subject.

Rangers including Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) rush forward to take cover behind anti-tank barriers,as the MG barrage continue, now with mortar shells exploding all over the beachhead. Soldiers were torn apart by the shell fragments. US Rangers succeeded to hold the beach, after the heavy firefight with many casualties. The beach scene was really intense, showing you the cold hard reality of combat action during war time.

Captain Miller was told by his superior officer to go deep into Normandy to look for Private James Ryan (82nd Airborne Division)and bring him back as his three brothers were KIA. Captain Miller thus assemble a squad of his men plus a translator Corporal Upham(Jeremy Davies).

1242527,5,B00000K3AM,"Well, what can you say that 1700 other reviewers haven't said before?  I doubt I can add a new angle, but wished to express my thoughts regarding this exceptional Steven Spielberg film.  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN must be the most realistic war movie ever made (and no, I've never been in combat, yet I feel very comfortable that the sights, sounds, grit, grime, tension, brutality, and horror of actual battle are aptly conveyed in this epic); it's all the viewer can do to get through the first half hour, an unbelievably gruesome and violent depiction of D-Day.  Spielberg definitely hooks his audience, even though (and I've seen this film several times) I find myself grimacing and looking away from some of the most disturbing carnage.

We all know the story:  A platoon is dispatched deep into Nazi France to find, and then remove, a Private Ryan (Matt Damon).  This is a PR move by the War Department, as Ryan's other three brothers have all been killed in action.  The journey to find Private Ryan's outfit, and then one final confrontation with German forces before Ryan can be removed, is riveting, compelling, horrific--poignant.  The action is powerful but never pretentious, and once again, extraordinarily realistic (including a knife fight when a German soldier, his face dripping with sweat, attempts to calm his American victim as the knife enters his chest).  All of the cast is exceptional, headlined by Tom Hanks as platoon leader Captain Miller--an everyday man just trying to hold his group together and make it to the next sunrise.  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is an elite epic, and when combined with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Schindler-s-List/dp/B00012QM8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Schindler's List</a>&nbsp;Spielberg has paid everlasting homage to World War II.

1242554,5,B00000K3AM,"First off, everything you may have heard about the opening Normandy sequence is true: this is quite simply the most amazing battle re-creation footage you're ever likely to see. Definitely not for the squeamish, it paints its horrifying portrait without ever allowing the viewer to glory in any kind of ""excitement"" (which most battle simulations end up doing on some level, even the well-meaning ones). Spielberg uses every ounce of his talent and ingenuity to show combat the way it should be shown: as pure Hell, a nightmare that it is impossible to waken from.  As for the rest of the movie which follows this opening sequence. . . well, I'm not sure. The first time I saw it, I was caught up from the beginning and the rest of the film seemed to hold me equally well. But upon further viewings, the flimsiness and basic illogic of the central plot become far more noticeable. I don't know, it's a toss-up. There are still several compelling scenes here, and Tom Hanks gives the performance of his career (his ""dramatic"" career anyway - I'm one who still believes there's much to be said for Tom's earlier work in comedy) but there just seems to be an overall ""falseness"" in the structure that undercuts some of the film's power. I wish a better framing story could have been found.  But by all means see this movie. Warts and all, it's the kind that only a truly great director could make - and the opening alone is worth the cost.

1242555,5,B00000K3AM,"All war movies capture a piece of the brutality that is war but only a very few bring forth the full carnage that war is.  In SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, director Steven Spielberg drags the viewer out of his seat and throws him into the sound and fury of modern war.  Critics have noted that with the opening scene of GIs getting machine gunned by Wehrmacht troopers on Omaha Beach on D-Day, Spielberg begins a three hour howl of pain that affects the soul as much as it does the body.  It is impossible to feel nothing even for the Germans who die by the hundreds.

Tom Hanks is Captain Miller who has the thankless task of bringing home Private Ryan whose three other brothers have died in battle.  The question of the morality to do this while others are equally deserving a ticket home is announced by Ryan (Matt Damon) himself who refuses to leave while his comrades need him.  It is this subtext of ethics versus pragmatism that imbues the film with the multi-layers of interpretation that result in equally multi-viewings. There are numerous scenes in which a soldier will pause while directly involved in a life and death struggle to detach himself from the fray to consider some basic concepts that mark him as human.  Jeremy Davies plays a GI interpreter who must face the morality of what it means to use his linguistic skills as simply one more element for killing the enemy.  Nearly everyone in Capt. Miller's squad also wonders whether their lives are collectively worth the one whose three brothers were killed.  What makes this insane struggle to quantify the unquantifiable work is the realization that the ability to judge the worth of such a sacrifice cannot be realized until much later when the now elderly Private Ryan pauses in front of the grave of Capt. Miller to pass judgment on an event that for everyone save him is only of historical interest.  To know that he is one who has tried his best to live the Good Life somehow lets him sleep at night.  We in the audience can share this most intimate of moments.",1220745600,2,2029,4.592797783933518
1242556,4,B00000K3AM,"The first scenes of ""Saving Private Ryan"" are spectacular.  You are with the landing force as it hits the beach at Normandy.  Shells are exploding, landing craft are blowing up and machine gun bullets are pinging off of metal.  Craft bow hatches are let down only to let machine gun bullets enter and wipe out the would-be invaders.  Still other soldiers, loaded down with ammo and weapons, jump out into deep water to sink and drown on the spot.

Survivors scramble to the beach where they are shot down in the scores.  Eventually, they organize, push through with Bangalor mines and are able to destroy points of German resistance.  Germans who surrender are mown down without mercy.  [Hey, What about the Geneva Convention?].  After this exciting segment, the movie settles down to a pretty average World War II movie.  We win most of the fights.

1242563,5,B00000K3AM,"As a result of the largely inane dialogue that arises out of pop culture's rabid desire to impute a sense of hierarchy to aesthetic works, there has been a stupid tendency to exalt works that convey the abstruse, the obscure, the macabre, the anti-climactic, the anti-cliche if you will. But those who say that Spielberg is overrated or lacks the cerebral auteurism of a Kubrick, the uncanny ability to manipulate suspense and fear such as Hitchcock, the lugubrious quiddities of a Kurosawa, or the romantic wit of Woody Allen, are absolutely stupid, to say the least. Spielberg is arguably the greatest director ever, and indisputably the most influential (one need not look further than the preponderance of escapist films made after the 70's). It is no mere hyperbole to say that Saving Private Ryan is the bar none the greatest war movie ever made, and probably ranks among the top 10 or 20 greatest films ever made.

The movie commences with a trip down memory lane, as we see an old man and his family clearly in distress. Intuitively we must assume the man seeks isolation--affirmed by his retrospection after he sees the grave of a soldier; the connection is not yet drawn though between this old man the grave at his feet. From the opening scene, wherein the audience bares witness to the pure and undistilled brutality of military carnage, Spielberg's technical virtuosity--unmatched in the history of film making--is no more apparent than when he uses the hand-held oscillations of the camera to convey a sense of presence to the scene. That is to say, the audience feels as if it is indeed part of the calamity it is privy to. The jarring immediacy of death--a motif revisited throughout the movie--appears at the blink of an eye as soldiers drop dead without even leaving their boats, and even more glaringly as we see soldiers drown, caught in the straps of their uniform and gear. Spielberg, chided as a sentimentalist, an unfair claim espoused by many who frankly don't know what the hell their talking about (such absolute labels are silly), conjures a sense of realism one doesn't see even in Full Metal Jacket (another great war movie, that pales in comparison to this). When bullets  kill a soldier asking for advice in front of Tom Hanks, his death is not dramatized but a reminder that stagnancy in war is fatal. As for my last observation of the first scene--the piez de resistance--Spielberg curiously mutes all sound in the middle of the scene and the audience is temporarily transformed into first person viewer; cringing as men grab their intestines to keep them from falling out, recoiling as blood leaks from every orifice as soldiers run by, stunned when Spielberg, in a brief fusion of comedy and tragedy that Aristotle would be proud of, shows us a soldier with one arm turning in circles looking for his other arm. This, among many technical manipulations, represents a reprisal of conscience because in that brief 1st-person transference we are reminded of the omniscience of death and men, who must kill or be killed, die or effect death, lose pieces of their souls in war in a way that can only be shown in silence.

This movie is not for the light-hearted, but violence, as many of the more acute reviewers have stated, is not gratuitous. Yes some of his movies are flawed, or are simply bad, and yes at times he values style over substance, some of which even lack the former, and yes he has made tons of money; but above all Spielberg is a genius and this movie should  be added to the cannon of unequivocally great movies made in World & American cinema. I leave with a simple message: the greatness of a movie, a director, or indeed any art, lies in its ability to change a person--to laugh, to cry, to fear is not enough. If one leaves a movie with an altered perception of things, perhaps a heightened understanding, then that work of art is indeed great.",1207699200,4,3898,4.736377025036819

1242568,5,B00000K3AM,"""Saving Private Ryan"" is historical because it depicts the average WWII soldiers' sense of loss and regret.  There are really two themes to this film.  First, a small band of American soldiers led by Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) must find Private James Ryan (Matt Damon) from his combat position as part of a public relations and humanitarian cause of the high command due to the fact that Ryan has lost all three of his brothers to combat death within a week of one another.  Second, the real theme of this film is the depiction of WWII type combat action.  Both themes run together quite well and what we end up with is the best war movie ever made.

The combat in this film is grisly and terrible.  A few of the scenes are so anti-Nazi, though, that there is little consideration for the average German soldier, who may or may not have been die hard Nazis.  They are depicted as die hards so that Spielberg can set up his own storyline, which he pulls off very well.

This film also broke new ground in the depiction of combat and there are so many films that have copied it since that it is clear that ""Saving Private Ryan"" set a special effects standard for Hollywood on a level that ""Star Wars"" did back in the 70s and early 80s.

Even if you hate war films I recommend that you watch this movie at least once.  It is a kind of a historical document and it will allow you to better appreciate the burden of the WWII soldier who gave so much to win freedom for the world in a time of dark tyranny.

In my opinion, this movie is easily one of the top ten to fifteen movies ever made.",1200268800,2,1590,4.266666666666667

1242571,5,B00000K3AM,"'SAVING PRIVATE RYAN' STRUCK ME AS: HARD-HITTING - GRAPHIC & EMOTIONAL WITHOUT OVERT SENTIMENTALISM OR SIMPLY THE 'CITIZEN KANE' OF WAR FILMS,

VERY SIMPLY STATED:

This is the most visceral, in-your-face war epic I have ever experienced. But ""Saving Private Ryan"" is much more than that, as it gives us a well-developed story line and characters we come to care about during the natural unfolding of the story.

WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT?:

After landing on Normandy through the most visceral and graphically-realistic re-creation ever put to film, this ensemble of American soldiers and the film itself slow down to catch their breath and hand us a great story, having now prepared us for it. The heroic ""everyman"" types that comprise this small band are fleshed out as they go through their mission to find Private Ryan. It's a sort of follow-the-yellow-brick-road-to-Hell kind of mission that is just about impossible for them to reconcile. What is so important about Private Ryan? See the film and you will find out.

BOTTOM LINE:

Action, drama, and morality are all mixed together in the cauldron of wholesale killing that was the second World War. The ""right thing"" to do is very difficult to decipher, both by these soldiers and by us viewers, but in no film is the topic more in-your-face realistic and emotionally-supercharged.

After seeing the Normandy sequences in this film, such similar epic recreations as in ""The Longest Day"" seem not just tame, but also emotionally-removed and from a safe distance. ""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of the best and most captivating films of any genre that I have ever experienced.

Although I have seen it countless times and can speak every line from memory, this movie never ceases to amaze me. The only problem that I have is that the landing on Omaha beach, despite having some of the best special effects, still isn't accurate in terms of the gore (not that that matters anyway). You see, I watched this film with my mom's uncle who is a surviving veteran of the same opening scene on Omaha beach. He saw everything shown in the film 63 years ago and said that it does a great justice to the men who fought and died, but Spielberg got it all wrong. He was touched by the movie but told me that if I could only imagine it infinitely worse, the blood, gore, and death on a larger and more horrifying scale; I would barely be able to grasp what he had to go through.

1242578,5,B00000K3AM,"""Saving Private Ryan"" is a movie that is truly epic in scale and stars a huge array of big names, some of whom became even bigger after the film, (eg. Vin Diesel).

The film opens with the harrowing D-Day landings, following Captain Miller and his men. The unit is given the mission of finding and getting Private James Ryan out of the war. His 3 brothers have all been killed and it has been decided that 3 or 4 sons is enough sacrifice for one mother to make.

A lot of the depth of the movie comes with the relationships between Miller and those around him. There are some truly light hearted moments, such as the pool that is running to find out what Miller did before the war. However, a lot is very deep and touches on some issues that other movies seem to gloss over. One is a conversation in which Miller mentions that over 90 men have died under his command and the way in which he copes with that personally.

The movie does not glorify war, but shows it in its hideous randomness and brutality. Though there a more violent films out there, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/We-Were-Soldiers-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000068TPN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">We Were Soldiers (Widescreen Edition)</a>, ""Saving Private Ryan"" definitely does not gloss over anything.

1242582,5,B00000K3AM,"Saving Private Ryan is an inspirational film filled with dyanamic battle-scenes, drama and action. During the opening scene into the storyline there is a fantastic 20-minute depiction of one bloodiest battles of WWII fought at Omaha Beach. Not only is it gruesome in its depiction of the thoughts of these soldiers who fought during this war but it also has an subplot filled with the notion of brotherhood. Tom Hanks performance was phenomenal as well as the rest of the cast which includes such notable names as: Edward Burns, Tom Seizmore, etc. Their performances work simultenously to make you believe in this mission: saving one man.

The storyline is simple, Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) has been assigned a mission from the General George C. Marshall. The mission's objective: Finding Private James Francis Ryan from Iowa, whose 3 other brothers have been K.I.A. (Killed in Action). Conflict: Private Ryan is somewhere in Normandy. Where? No one exactly knows. Like Captain Miller says: ""It's like finding a needle in a stack of needles.""

Yet as they embark on this mission they are met with some obstacles along the way. Losing men as they go, many start to question the value of their mission and if saving one man is worth the lives of many others. It comes to a culminating end, one that might leave you with a tear or two.

1242584,4,B00000K3AM,"I wanted this movie in my personal collection - after seeing it twice in the theaters several years ago.  I'm not a great movie buff, but this was special.  I'm also a military history buff, and have studied Normandy and D-Day extensively.

My father is a WWII Vet/Infantry Officer.  He didn't land at Normandy, but was in two amphibious landings in Europe - Anzio Italy and Southern France.  He never talked about them much - even after he presented me with my commission many years ago.  After reading eyewitness accounts and seeing the opening scenes, I can understand why he didn't want to talk.

I think the other appeal of this movie is the way Speilberg crafts the interpersonal relationships among the men - especially the newby interpreter Allman who at heart is a coward and demonstrates it at the end of the movie by shooting the prisoner as compensation for his own inability to do his duty earlier, when it mattered.",1168300800,3,929,4.697530864197531

1242587,5,B00000K3AM,"I first saw this movie as a rental, in the comfort of my own living room, with a modest stereo system for the sound.  I could not have imagined, then or now, the effect of the big screen of a theatre.  The opening 20 minutes are as real and gutt-wrenching as any I've ever seen.  Steven Ambrose stated that WWII vets of D-DAY said they never thought they'd see their efforts portrayed on film with such stunning reality.  Some openly wept at a special screening.  Still others purposefully left their seats for the refuge of the lobby.  Old wounds re-opened.  While the individual personalities of the search squad present a mixture of pragmatism and stubborness, at various moments and, in the climactic battle, they individualy show us their deep dedication to their mission, their unit and, most of all, their brothers.  I am seldom at a loss for words but this is an exception.  My emotions rumble within me whenever I view this movie, and how I wish I could meet one of the men today, just to shake his hand, look him in the eye and say ""thank you, sir.""  If you have never seen this film, boy, how I envy you!  You are in for an experience that may be life-changing.  I will close with this thought.  Somewhere, there is a similar story, though not necessarily a like-minded plot, concerning the soldiers of WWI.  These were men too, Germans, French, Belgians and Americans.  They had homes in the country, grew up on farms, had moms who worked at local hospitals and taught literature to high school students.  Perhaps some day, Spielberg, or someone almost as good, will tell their story as well, because after all the parades, after all the saluting, after all the political maneuvering, war is still, and always has been, about the duty, honor and valor of the man at arms.  So, to any of you who actually may have been at Omaha Beach, Anzio or Iwo Jima, I say to you, sirs, God Bless You, and, to your fallen comrades, don eis requiem, sempiternam.",1163721600,14,1959,4.551428571428572
1242588,2,B00000K3AM,"War films can be broken into two basic categories; the propaganda film, which celebrates bravery and patriotism; and the anti-war film, which shows the suffering and futility of war. The most extreme propaganda films are usually produced when a war is threatened or actually in progress and either demonize or belittle the individual enemy soldier. This is useful for both inspiring the home front and for assuring it that there will be an ultimate victory. While these films play well with a wartime audience they appear somewhat silly when viewed in a post-war environment.

An exception to this war-in-progress concept was is ""Saving Private Ryan"". Cloaked in an anti-war facade, this film was more typical of what would have been produced in 1944 (its setting) than 1998 (its year of release).

Under its thin anti-war facade of realistic looking destruction, Private Ryan breaks with the characterization elements that are essential for classification as an anti-war work. Almost by definition anti-war films use a faceless enemy (""Paths of Glory"") or portray the enemy soldier as sharing in the suffering and futility of war (""The Enemy Below""). Often they are portrayed as victims of a fanatical leadership and the audience is invited to identify with or at least understand them (""The Longest Day"").

This is because after a war, both the victors and the vanquished have an incentive to portray their enemy as brave and determined, otherwise victory is hollow and defeat is humiliating. Not so in Private Ryan; if the German battle performance and basic infantry tactics shown in the film were representative of what was actually practiced, a single allied division could have occupied all of Germany by the end of June 1944. The final battle scene alone makes the viewer wonder how, facing such a totally inept enemy, the war could have gone on more than a few days after the D-Day Landings.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only an inner child.",1163548800,4,1955,5.003076923076923
1242589,5,B00000K3AM,"I remember seeing this film in the theater when it first came out in 1998. I was stunned by how realistic it was, and up to that point I had never seen anything like it. The cinematography makes you feel like you are there, in Normandy, with the troops. 'Saving Private Ryan' raised the stakes enormously in regards to war films. In my opinion, it immediately became the benchmark that future war films would be compared to. To this day, I tend to subconsciously compare any new war film I watch to this masterpiece. Much to the dismay of some of the reviewers here, SPR is actually....gasp....patriotic! It actually has the nerve to portray American soldiers as honorable and the war as a just cause. This is not to say that they are portrayed as saints or fearless heroes. This is no John Wayne movie. The characters are men with flaws and weaknesses just like everyone else, and this gives the film a very realistic feel. Sure, the plot is fictitious and it's a little over-sentimental, but as far as I'm concerned, 'Saving Private Ryan' remains THE classic war film that stands above the rest.

The negative reviewers just don't get it. 'Saving Private Ryan' is not a documentary nor does it claim to be. It is a tribute to the American soldiers who fought and died in WW2, period. If you want to see the British or the French, there are plenty of other films and documentaries out there to accomodate you. If you want to see an ""anti-war"" film, or some profound, intellectual insight into the human condition, look elsewhere. If you're a bitter, cynical, nit-picker, you probably won't like 'Saving Private Ryan.' But if you want to see a patriotic, yet realistic film about World War 2, look no further.",1161388800,7,1709,4.64026402640264
1242590,5,B00000K3AM,"I have always had a fascination with WW2, something about it just interests the hell out of me. There has been countless movies made about WW2, each with there pros and cons. In my opinion alot of war movies you see are watered down and made to have a sort of gung ho feel to it(""The Longest Day""), rather than trying to create a realistic portrayal of the events. The problem with doing that is that it takes most of the realism, emotion and grittiness out of the film(""The Great Raid""). You will find none of that here.

  Steven Speilberg has created probably the most realistic war movie to date, however gritty, however horrifying it may be it is for a purpose. He told the story the way it deserved to be told. I know my fair share about the Normandy invasions and I can honestly say this is EXTREMELY accurate. The movie showed war how it really is, confusing, ugly, scary, and shows us how much courage one could have when needed. Thank you Speilberg for making it accurate and not watered down.

  This is easily my favorite war movie, I must have watched it already about 30 times easy, and I never get tired of it. The cast does an excellent job of portraying there characters. Especially Tom Hanks and Sizemore, perfect for this movie. If you want to see a realistic POWERFUL war movie than buy this.",1156118400,4,1312,4.445833333333334
1242591,5,B00000K3AM,"Saving Private Ryan is an inspirational film filled with dyanamic battle-scenes, drama and action. During the opening scene into the storyline there is a fantastic 20-minute depiction of one bloodiest battles of WWII fought at Omaha Beach. Not only is it gruesome in its depiction of the thoughts of these soldiers who fought during this war but it also has an subplot filled with the notion of brotherhood. Tom Hanks performance was phenomenal as well as the rest of the cast which includes such notable names as: Edward Burns, Tom Seizmore, etc. Their performances work simultenously to make you believe in this mission: saving one man.

The storyline is simple, Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) has been assigned a mission from the General George C. Marshall. The mission's objective: Finding Private James Francis Ryan from Iowa, whose 3 other brothers have been K.I.A. (Killed in Action). Conflict: Private Ryan is somewhere in Normandy. Where? No one exactly knows. Like Captain Miller says: ""It's like finding a needle in a stack of needles.""

Yet as they embark on this mission they are met with some obstacles along the way. Losing men as they go, many start to question the value of their mission and if saving one man is worth the lives of many others. It comes to a culminating end, one that might leave you with a tear or two.

1242596,5,B00000K3AM,"Saving Private Ryan is without a doubt the greatest war movie ever made!  Steven Spielberg has given the veterans of WWII a fine tribute, in his best film.(Yes, Schindler's List was excellent as well, but that movie was very dreary.  SPR offers honor and invokes patroitism.) The movie opens with an amazing reenactment of the historic D-Day invasion.  This long 20-minute sequence is the most violent, graphic, gory, and gutwrenching scene in the history of film, but it is also one of the best filmed sequences ever made.(Janusz Kaminski deserved the Oscar for his breathtaking cinematography.) As the landing crafts reach the beach, we are introduced to Captain John Miller(played brillantly by Tom Hanks), a man who is determined to lead his soldiers into battle, but also goes into a brief state of shock every once in a while.  His hand cannot stop shaking from all this trauma.  After the D-day invasion, Cpt. Miller is given a new mission.  Three of the Ryan brothers were killed in combat, but there is still one brother, Private James Ryan, who is alive.  Miller and his platoon are sent to find him and bring him home.  As they begin their mission, there are soldiers who question the logic of this: Where's the sense in risking the lives of the eight of us to save one guy?, asks Private Richard Reiben(Edward Burns).  During the mission, tragedy strikes and soldiers do bump heads.  But in the end, they find the reason behind all of this.  Spielberg deserved his 2nd Best Director Oscar for this fine movie.  Tom Hanks gives the best performance of his career(besides Philadelphia), showing his humanity in the middle of the tragedy known as war.  Not to leave out the stellar ensemble that brings these soldiers to life(Sizemore, Burns, Pepper, Diesel).  This should have won Best Picture instead of Shakespeare in Love, but that doesn't matter.  What someone will take with them after this movie is a true understanding of the sacrifice that these men made to protect our freedom.  That is what matters the most.",1137628800,,2028,4.851744186046512

Cast:  Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Jeremy Davies, Matt Damon, Ted Danson.

Running Time:  170 minutes

Rated R for intense prolonged realistically graphic sequences of war violence, and for language.

""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of Steven Spielberg's most haunting and visually stunning films. As the film opens, tt is D-Day, June 6th,1944. You are soon caught up in the battle on Omaha Beach, where soldiers are shot, drowned, blown apart or on fire during the battle on the beach against the Germany army. One of the soldiers fighting is Captain Miller (Tom Hanks, in one of his best performances), who fights bravely, but you can see the terror that engulfs him. His hands say it all: an uncontrollable shaking.  Soon after the battle, Miller is given a mission: seems that 3 of the killed men were brothers. A fourth is behind enemies lines and needs to be rescued and sent home to America. With his team members accompanying him, Miller starts his search for Private Ryan (Matt Damon).

This is not an easy mission because very single man in Miller's crew knows that they may not survive the trek through the countryside of Normandy. Private Reiben (Edward Burns) believes that Private Ryan is not worth saving, at the cost of their lives. But with courage and determination by the team (although some members do lose their lives), they find Ryan. However, Ryan refuses to leave because a bridge in a bomb shattered town needs protection from the German army. With the assistance of the surviving team, they take a stand against the army. The ensemble cast is briliantly orchestrated by Spielberg; first and foremost is Jeremy Davies, who plays Corporal Upham, a very feeble but somewhat poetic soldier caught in the chaos. Davies' portrayal would be scene stealing if the rest of the cast wasn't so stellar, as the audience will certainly be able to identify most easily with this character. Hanks combines the perfect mix of wisdom and physical brutality in Captain Miller, a man who is equally haunted by the mission at hand and with what awaits him back at home. Matt Damon, who plays the title character, is very effective in a somewhat brief role which requires him to be both emotionally and physically strong whilst being sympathetic to the audience. Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Tom Sizemore, Giovanni Ribisi, Edward Burns, and Vin Diesel round off the top notch cast, and not a single player is anything less than perfect.

Much has obviously been said about the battle sequences, especially the brutal realism which they contain. Not only are they perfect in the technical department, but when viewed in the simple context of ""men trying to survive"" the scenes are absolutely heart-wrenching, and equally unforgettable.  ""Saving Private Ryan"" leaves an unmistakable imprint on the mind, where even those who dislike the movie will not be able to forget it. It is a wholly unique cinematic experience and one which should be endured by anyone mature enough to handle it. It transcends the medium to truly become a work of art, and it holds a rock-solid place in cinematic history.",1135814400,2,3194,4.951401869158879
1242598,5,B00000K3AM,"Every one has the potential of making a good movie many don't use that potential. Steven really used it to its fullest and went above the call of duty. The actors did the same to give you the pain of war.

This movie is another WWII film, but this one actually gives you the facts of war. You aren't invincible bullets can and will kill. Characters die in a muzzleflash of speed, main character or not.

This movie seems really inspired the opening seen probably won't leave your mind any time soon. It is gory but to the veterans who fought in this war that's just how things went. This movie seems less like a film and more like a war and that's what Steven set out to do and accomplished that.

The battles really get you going you will start to feel for the characters yelling out in agony. The story takes you into the eyes of the soldiers of D-day and then all over Germany. A small group of soldiers are told to search for a soldier named Ryan. As his mother is very upset knowing all her other kids died in war.

The chances of young Private Ryan still being alive are slim, but the group of soldiers still wonder off looking for him.

This group of soldiers experience the tragedy of loss in search of Ryan and they get at eachothers necks. The battles just keep coming from stealthy approaches to opening fire out in blind daylight. The scenery seems dusty and destroyed in debries. The amount of bloodloss is disturbing and the men who fought and died will never know if they truly won. The group has specialists such as the marksman and team leader. Guns jam on occasion and ammo runs out often. This is the most realistic war movie ever depicted.

I give would give this the highest honor is story telling to date. This isn't just a rental it's definitely a purchase title.",1132531200,4,1786,4.380664652567976
1242599,5,B00000K3AM,"I was never a big fan of war movies.  Then I saw Gladiator and decided that I liked swords and sandles type epics but war movies, still a no go.  I decided to try and watch Black Hawk Down and said ""this movie sucks"" about half way through and turned it off, but there was always this little part of me that, just for the heck of it, wanted to rent Saving Private Ryan.  And then I saw the preview for Jarhead and I said...""I NEED TO SEE THAT"" and so I decided that before I waste money on Jarhead, I'll waste money on Saving Private Ryan, and let me tell you this, it was the best $5 I ever spent.  This film is brilliantly done, from opening scene till close it grabs you and pulls you in so you're in the lives of these men, you feel for these men and you understand their pain and you may even cry for these men.  They are truly heros.  If you thought Tom Hanks knocked it out the park in Forrest Gump you NEED to see him here.  ANd Tom SIzemore gives the BEST performance of his carreer.  I promise you that from start to finish you will be obsorbed by the power this film has and be happy you watched.  This is a film that needed to be made to show us what our troops go through, and whether your a person who agrees with war, finding in nec. for our survival or a person who dissagress and deems it a lack of respect for human life you will still appreciate this film for what it is, because regardless of how you feel about the cause you will still be moved by these MEN and there COURAGE under fire...I know that I was.",1132185600,3,1528,4.016501650165017
1242600,5,B00000K3AM,"Saving Private Ryan is a great war film. The combat and violence is staggering and difficult to watch at times, but it does prove how horrific the battles were. As I said, I admire ""Ryan"" for its realism of war, but as for characters, I didn't find it that appealing. It seemed like the characters just weren't developed enough. It probably was not like this at all in real life, but it seems that in the movie the soldiers were automatically made out to be complete ignorant jerks to each other. For example, the medic shouts out in the middle of the Omaha invasion(I think it was Omaha) why the Germans aren't giving them a chance? Well, are you going to give them a chance?..........

Then one soldier tries to emphasize the importance of brotherhood in war and that the men should care about each other, and the soldiers just laugh at him and make fun of him for it, but when their two men get killed, all of a sudden they are so sensitive and compassionate and decide to use that to intimidate Private Ryan when he refused to leave the squad.

Saving Private Ryan is a great drama and war film, but if you are looking for better developed characters in a war film, try Platoon.

How could ""Ryan"" get Best Director Oscar but not Best Picture?",1130198400,3,1246,4.432314410480349
1242601,5,B00000K3AM,"Wow.  All 5 Oscars for this film were well-deserved, in my humble opinion.  The realism is astounding.

Personally, I was quite tempted to rate this film 4 stars because, as much as I hate to admit it, there were parts that bothered me, and I can't just let them fly without mentioning them:  The implausible ironies (I won't spoil them for you); the casting of the incredibly irresistable, cool, and likeable Matt Damon in the role of the soughtafter Private Ryan who instantly earns the respect of several men who had openly hated him for weeks (and that awful story he tells about the last day he spent with his brothers - I didn't exactly get a charge out of it), and even the casting of Tom Hanks in the lead role (but only because I love the guy so much for his rare gift of making people laugh just at the sight of his face and the sound of his voice; he is just too darned funny for me to take seriously on a mission like the D-Day invasion; this is particularly evident in the scene of the mistaken identity.  Who needs Bob Hope when you have Tom Hanks?)

HOWEVER, I give it 5 stars not only because of its groundbreaking depiction of the reality of the horrors of war (and I don't mind the blood and guts if it is what really happened and what haunts the survivors), but because of its emotional impact.  In the bonus material, there is a mention of Spielberg's desire to depict the emotions that must have been felt through the eyes of the actors, while briefly showing one look in each soldier's eyes.  At that moment, I thought ""Bingo.""  THAT is what gives this film its ""staying power"" - the mark of all good films.  This happens again at various points in the film.  In one scene, the map-drawing corporal who found himself in the middle of this mission says that he doesn't smoke but is there nervously smoking a cigarette.  I too have never smoked, and at 43, while watching this film, I honestly wished I had a cigarette at that moment, too.  Another scene that grabbed me was them fishing through airborne division dog tags while the living airborne division walks by.  The scene where the medic relates not knowing why he pretended to be asleep as a child when his mother came home early to talk to him, which he had always wanted.  Every scene with a not-so-black-and-white life and death risk-based decision to be made on the spot certainly qualifies.  Finally, I am a mother of two young children who still cry for me from time to time; hearing a young man cry for his mother just about sent me over the edge.  I could not sleep for hours.

For this, I realized that those ""flaws"" I mentioned above not only didn't matter much in how I'd rate the film, but the film probably actually needs them to get many viewers through it.

I understand the storyline is ficticious, very loosely based on a true story, and that the D-Day events are very accurately portrayed, although the initial capture of the German bunker seemed a bit quick.  I realize the film couldn't be that long, but a good filmaker ought to be able to make it appear as though more time has passed.

Bottom line is that I never had a deep interest in how this war was fought, but after watching this film, I found myself sobbing over the losses incurred by people who, not so fearlessly, fought for the freedoms I - and probably most of the free world - enjoy today.  I hope to see the films that other commentators have mentioned (including any depicting the Russian invasion), to read more about this battle and the war, and Godwilling, to pay my respects at the memorial at Normandy someday.  Any film that can inspire that kind of interest and have this ultimate impact earns 5 stars from me.",1129420800,5,3683,4.439821693907875

Would this happen, I doubt a group of men would be sent to find somebody before their units close to the person, but who knows.

 The group of men go through the hedgerows, and of course encounter Germans. The scence with the prisoner is amazing. When they find Private Ryan there is an awesome, but yet again terrifying fight.

1242605,5,B00000K3AM,"Some of the most moving scenes of this movie are of the aging Private Ryan at a cemetary in Normandy.  Contemplating what others gave to him so that he could live the life he lived, it is easy to put yourself into his shoes and ask ""Do I deserve this?""

In this movie, the invasion of Normandy at Omaha Beach is depicted with great amounts of gore, heroism and violence.  Even so, the battle for Omaha was more viscious than depicted in the movie with the German 352nd Division holding out for much of the day, covered by deadly accurate flak 88's (of which a brief mention is made in the movie).  In the movie, Captain Miller is sent with a small company of his surviving soldiers into enemy held territory to locate a paratrooper, Private Ryan, who had just lost all of his brothers in other areas of the conflict.

There is interesting drama as this small group manages to get through relatively weak defended areas to the areas occupied by the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions.  Managing to miraculously locate Private Ryan, Captain Miller's company joins up with some survivors from the 101st with the goal of not only keeping Private Ryan alive, but holding the town from a counterattack by the 2nd SS and hold the town until relieved.  The ensuing fight is a terrible one as the outmatched Americans are about to be anhilated entirely only to be saved by reinforcements, capturing the bridge and relieving the town.

Though there are some historical problems with the movie (that unoccupied territory between the Omaha beachhead and the airborne troops I found implausible), I found the drama compelling. This movie isn't about men bigger than life (ala John Wayne), but regular men giving their all for their country and fellow soldiers.  Even so, the most moving scenes to me are in the cemetary as Private Ryan contemplates the gift he received and the cost of that gift.  It certainly made me stop and think about the gifts of freedom I have and enjoy and how many lives and dreams have been lost in my behalf.

Despite the gore, violence and historical inaccuracies, I still strongly recommend this movie.",1121126400,,2118,4.697297297297298

1242607,5,B00000K3AM,"If it was possible to rate this movie a 10 it would still not do it justice. This Spielberg masterpiece takes the filmgoer on a journey that the ordinary man in the street, if he is fortunate, never gets to experience. It vividly shows both through the brilliant cinematograhy and the equally briliant acting the brutality of war and the great price paid by many both directly and indirectly involved. War ultimately has no winners only survivors and this movie demonstrates that in spades. It shows warfare in its most basic and brutal form something man was not created to witness but foisted on many for reasons beyond their control. Hanks is at his best in this movie and gives a tradesmanlike performance which we have become accustomed to seeing from this actor. Sizemore gives us another look at his considerable talent and is a good foil to Hanks throughout the film. I personally feel it is the directing that this film will chiefly be remembered for and the powerful message it conveys rather than the acting which is not to downplay the acting in any way. I doubt we will see better from Spielberg although this directors ability to surprise is well documented. Small wonder that many veterans of the Normandy landings broke down when viewing the opening scenes of this movie such was the realism portrayed. I myself had been in the cemetary overlooking Omaha beach 6 months after the filming of the opening scenes so the movie has a very special personal meaning for me. When one looks over the hundreds of white headstones the overwhelming feeling of debt engulfs one. Many of the soldiers who gave thier lives in the landings were mere teenagers. Its hard to accept but they and thousands of others saved what was then the free world. The movie captures this aspect brilliantly. There are not sufficient superlatives to accord this masterpiece.",1119657600,3,1858,4.809375

1242610,5,B00000K3AM,"If the all-star cast isn't enough to make you want to see this movie, then watching it simply because of it being a spielberg should do the trick. Hosting a round of names such as Tom Hanks,Giovanni Ribisi,Paul Giamatti,Ted Danson, Matt Damon, Barry Pepper and even Vin Diesel in one of his first real roles.

For Vin Diesel fans, his role was exclusively created by Spielberg for his moments of glory in the movie. Although his role isn't as long or prounouced as more future ones, he's not hard to pick out.

However I regress, for Saving Private Ryan is more than a bunch of big names in gritty war movie. Its about how the war affected the different men in different ways. The anger, frustration and fear that where such strong factors in how they communicated with each other and the enemy.

Not as hardened as Platoon, but just as gritty, Saving Private Ryan is for those who truly wish to watch real movies on real events. Gore is not used with a tightfist, from the beginning you'll find blood spraying, men without limbs and stomachs torn open for all to see.

Tom Hanks plays Cpt. Miller, who is sent to rescue Private Ryan (Matt Damon) the last of the Ryan family, his two older brothers both killed recently in the war. Leading his men on the long tramp through enemy territory, they encounter hardship and death on every turn. I don't say death lightly, for half the men don't even make it to Ryan. This causes the survivors to wonder why they are even risking themselfs for one man, a man they never met and wouldn't know if he was standing two feet in front of them.

To say the ending was the saddest part of the entire movie would be doing Spielberg a diservice, not one scene goes by without you fumbling for a tissou. A classic trademark of Spielberg.",1118966400,,1770,4.46749226006192

If you have a weak stomach or can't stand the really horrible war pictures you can skip this, there is no important storyline in it and therefore unimportant for the rest of the movie, it is however a brilliant piece of filming.

The movie itself is mostly set in shades of green and grey, making the imagery beautiful and therefore worth seeing. It's again a great Spielberg movie, especially in its realism and if you want to get a good view about how D-Day was see this, maybe together with the great mini-series Band of Brothers.",1115856000,3,751,4.364285714285714
1242612,5,B00000K3AM,"Being a Army National Guard captain when I viewed this movie, I was very interested in the character Captain Miller, who is played by Tom Hanks. I found the way in which Miller balances taking care of his soldiers and carrying out the mission was very tough and brutal to his own psyche. Miller has to deal with the conflict between carrying out the mission and taking care of the soldiers, and he reveals how he does this to his sergeant.

Captain Miller is obviously affected by the stress and horror of war, but he still is able to effectively lead. Knowing how soldiers act, I felt the movie was very realistic in the portrayal of the enlistedmen and the sergeant, played by Tom Sizemore. The enlistedmen are not yes-men, but are soldiers who carry out their duty with cynical views of their mission.

With all his faults and sarcastic view, Captain Miller exemplifies an officer that does all he can to make sure that he carries out the mission to get his soldiers on ""that big boat home,"" in other words on the ship that takes the soldiers home to the U.S.

A few years after this movie, I visited the American cemetary at Normandy. I felt a great gratitude to the soldiers that died on D-Day. This movie will give you a strong sense of admiration for those that served the United States in World War II, especially on the crucial D-Day. From hearing the historian Stephen Ambrose's remarks of how D-Day was like for the common soldier, this movie gives the most gritty look at what combat may have been like for the soldier on D-Day.

 Taking place at the Arlington National Cemetary, an aging veteran named Ryan is with his family, when the memories start come back to him. After not long we're taken to Normandy on D-Day, in a powerful, graphic 20 minute sequence showing the true horrors of war. This film, like Schindler's List before it, shows a realistic depiction of WW11 that leavs its mark on you even long before the closing credits have rolled down the screen to the tune of the National Anthem. Speilberg does an excellent job throughout the film reminding us that the people we are watching are not just actors, for they are portraying real, nameless people. People who really fought for us, amking this seem almost like a war documentary. We are reminded that all veterans are heroes no matter for what war they are fighting in. Hanks, in another unforgettable performance as Platoon captain, is leading his men to the center of the war to retrieve one man, Private Ryan, played by Matt Damon. The story itself may seem a bit strange, seeing that there were thousands of troops in Europe in 1944, so why all this just for one man? Well, watch and found out. Whether you enjoy this or not, take this as a reminder of what our soldiers go through, and that war really is hell.",1112745600,3,1525,4.541818181818182
1242616,5,B00000K3AM,"This is simply the greatest war film ever made. Ever. And I've seen a TON of war films. Im hoping Speilberg makes a similar movie about the Marines in the pacific (Thin Red Line just wasn't that good). Using a new style of filming, the crew ran alongside the actors in every scene, giving the viewer the sense of actually being there with the troops (if that feeling is EVER possible through film). This film is simply brilliant. And powerful. Also fantastic is the audio. The sounds of bullets whizzing by overhead and ""pinging"" off metal had me actually ducking in the movie theater. Apparently, it was too real for many veterans who subsequently had to leave the theater.

'Saving Private Ryan"" starts in the American cemetery in Normany where some thousands upon thousands upon thousands of American soldiers are buried in endless rows of beautiful white stone crosses. The scenery is simply beautiful, with the English Channel in the backround. Then the horror starts. It's June 6, 1944. Early morning. The soldiers of Tom Hank's Ranger batallion are headed for Omaha beach in a crammed Higgins boat. They're terrified, they're sick and they're cold. Many have never seen combat before. The Germans are dropping shells all around their boat. You feel like you're there with these boys. Your hands are sweaty, you're nervous. Your nauseous. You know what they're in for. So do they, and thats what makes this scene so utterly horriying. They know when that ramp drops to unload them on the beach they're probably gonna die. Are you insane by this point??? Are you resigned to the fact that you're gonna die?? Or are you so utterly terrified that you're numb???? Speilberg captures all this. He's a brilliant director.

Then the boys hit shore and the ramp drops. The first 5 soldiers are immediately shot in the head and drop. The rest clamor out of the boat, terrified. Literally running for their lives. They climb over the sides, they jump out the front and into the waist high water. Some are shot to peices. Some drown under the weight of their packs. You feel all of this. You're there!!!!! The German artillery and machine gun fire is unrelenting. It's like a wave of lead showering these poor souls from every and all angles. Again, Speilberg is a genius.

Some of the boys make it to the beach.....then the real horror begins. Much has been said about the first 20 minutes of this movie.....too gruesome, too violent. Sickeneing. How can a movie that depicts what living Americans (or any human for that matter) experienced be described as ""too"" anything???? That's where I part ways with the critics. This is what they lived through. This is part of many peoples experince. This was their life. To think that there are many older people walking around today who actually LIVED THROUGH experiences like this is almost too much to think about. Do they think about it all day everyday for the rest of their lives??? Do they dream about it every night?? Do they have flashbacks that result from certain sounds or smells??? Do they relive it?? Are you insane on the inside but appear ""ok"" to the everyday passerby?? Maybe even to your family??

This movie is simply wonderful. The whole movie. Tom Hanks gave this character his all. Mostly because he respected the character and knew that he was representing an entire generation of human beings for whom this experience of war was real. If you haven't seen this movie, buy it now. Watch it in surround sound.......go to war. You'll come away with a whole new respect for those old men you see who 60 years later are still wearing hats with the insignia of their company or batallion on it. And you'll understand why.",1111017600,13,3676,4.748043818466353

It's important for us to recall the tremendous bravery and loyalty soldiers have shown so we could live free and in comfort.  Those men of that generation were truly a great generation...selfless and willing to fight for what they felt was right.  Even if a war is started for duplicitous reasons (and I don't think WW2 falls in this category) one must remember that soldiers, for the most part, are acting from the heart..from virtue to fight for what they feel is right.
Some other reviewer said that there was no good reason for this film...but I heartily disagree.  It was real...it happened and we should know our history and the sacrifices others have made for us. Many people will never read any account of what happened.  They will only learn via movies...I'd rather have a movie about it than nothing at all.  We need more appreciation for the sacrifices previous generations have made.  The only reason we are allowed to say ""war has not solved anything"" is because others have courageously gone to war.  I don't like war...no one does...but we can't deny the fact that it has eradicated some evil in the world. It's just the truth and this film has shown it.

1242619,3,B00000K3AM,"I think what impresses most people about SPR is its spectacular budget. It is also technically and somewhat artistically well beyond what most War movies have done before. But it suffers from the ""Spielberg Factor"". That is, the story and characters are developed not from a Veteran's standpoint, but from a novice trying to imagine a Veteran's standpoint. Once the plot gets rolling, I got the uncomfortable feeling the soldiers were behaving like children playing war. They were certainly in adult situations, but their behavior was the way children would behave if they were pretending to be adults. I blame this on Spielberg's directing because probably his only experience with war is playing it as a child in his neighborhood. If I may go further in alienating other viewers, I find Tom Hanks of similar ilk, playing his character as the oldest kid in the war game. If they had been carrying plastic toy guns, I would have found the tone more honest. Don't get me wrong, I'm an active supporter of Veteran's Day, and if this movie increases respect for our Vets, then the good outweighs the bad. If there is anything I commend this movie for, it is that it seems to be a sincere, if awkward, reaching out to our Vets by mainstream Hollywood.

1242620,3,B00000K3AM,"I saw the film when it came out in 1998. I was deeply impressed and moved by it. The first 20 minutes of carnage have earned this film a place in the annals of film history. Since then I have seen the film several times at home. And every time I watched it again I realized more what a mixed bag the film actually is.

The film gives you a very authentic feel. But how authentic is it?

The Allies lost more than 4000 soldiers on Omaha beach landing sector. You get a feeling for that.

The Allies came in several attack waves in intervals of 20 minutes. The first two attack waves were basically wiped out to the last man. So you would either enter a virgin beach and play no role in the further movie - or you come in later and stumble across hundreds of bodies across the beach. In the film, however, its all one big attack wave.

The battle on the beach raged on for 9 hours, not 20 minutes. You don't quite get a feeling for that one.

The number of the German defenders at the crucial sector at Omaha beach was about 30. You guess you saw them all in the film. Or a few more actually...

The thing that turned the table was not a few brave men blasting a gap through the barbed wire and fire a lucky shot at an explosives box (or whatever that was...) in the German sandbag position but the fact that finally Allied tanks arrived on the beach which destroyed the German positions. And those actually only finished off what the combined firepower of the warships off the coast hadn't vaporized yet. Several Allied destroyers ran ashore off Omaha beach alone while shelling the positions of the 30 Germans. The job of the GIs on the beach was only to be mowed down by the defenders until allied artillery had killed them all (except the 5 who managed to retreat).

The battle towards the end of the film is pretty much a farce. Not only did such a battle as shown not take place at all, the behavior of the Waffen-SS soldiers is embarrasingly unrealistic. They run in single file through the city without trying to take any cover and without taking much effort even to spot the enemy.

In reality small combat groups would have worked their way through buildings and basements and would have secured the city before any heavy armor would have been moved into the dangerous streets.

The ahistorical skinhead-like haircuts of the Germans are probably an ideological point Spielberg wanted to drive home.

While watching the stupid Krauts being mowed down by the dozen you keep asking yourself how they managed to conquer virtually all of Europe in the first place. You would never guess that in reality by the end of July 1944  the casualty ratio between Allies and Germans in France was 120,000 against 117,000 - despite total Allied air control and a vast Allied superiority in terms of troops, firepower, ammo and fuel.

Summing up, the first 20 minutes wrote film history. The rest is often rather annoying.",1109894400,41,2914,4.477358490566037
1242621,5,B00000K3AM,"I guess with the age of video games and virtual reality upon us, it was only a matter of time for someone to capture the most realistic war scenes that have ever been depicted in film.  The landing and ground fighting shown in the Normandy invasion literally makes the viewer feel like they were transported in time and are actually experiencing the real thing!

Tom Hanks is brilliant as a shell-shocked veteran who is asked to perform a special service.  That is to go through enemy territory and bring back the last surviving son of the Ryan clan.  His other brothers having all recently perished in combat, leaving him the only remaining son.

The movie grips you from the start and there are some well scripted scenes with a lot of surprises in Hanks search for the last Ryan.  You go through the movie hoping that Hanks will find him soon and be able to leave the hell of war before his nerves are totally shot.

What made this movie even more dramatic is that it is based on a true story!  One of my favorite all-time war movies.",1107993600,,1036,4.444444444444445
1242622,4,B00000K3AM,"When I first saw this film, it was at an industry preview prior to the UK cinema release. The consensus of many after viewing it was that it was too bloody, and they were unsure as to who the audience for it were, and who would want to see it.
Yet such was the calibre of the film, a day or so later these opinions had mostly been revised, and it was felt that this was indeed a WW2 film which packed a powerful message.

From my perspective, Saving Private Ryan works brilliantly in its depiction of war. To capture the fluid and chaotic reality of battle, Spielberg used hand held cameras as opposed to fixed. The effect is dramatic, giving the viewer the sensation of actually being in the battles depicted.
Moreover, the viewer is plunged into the realities of command and control in such a situation, and the reality dawns that the notion of officers controlling a battle from its midst is an implausibilty. Instead battles are depicted from the viewpoint that once you are engaged, then it is the acts of individuals in the moment that make the difference. Spielberg tries to depict officers in control eg Tom Hank's character, the SS officer in the Tiger tank but the result is that they are part of the proceedings as opposed to being the controllers. While many old soldiers have faulted technical aspects of the film, they largely agree that it one of the few films to actually depict in a realistic fashion, the confusion and chaos of battle. This realisation also makes the viewer understand how in such chaos so called 'friendly fire' deaths can occur.

Nor the film does not hold back on its depiction of carnage. The landing at Omaha beach shows men being ripped apart, disembowelled and dying young soldiers are seen crying for their mothers, and men missing arms are seen staggering around in shock, looking for their missing limbs.
Allied troops are shown disregarding the Geneva Convention when it suits them. Immediately after the German positions at Omaha have been overrun, some US troops are depicted mocking, and then shooting dead German soldiers who have just surrendered to them.
Again full marks to Spielberg for having the courage to show an ugly and shockingly human response from men who have just fought a vicious battle and seen many of their comrades killed by the same soldiers who now want to surrender.
The last battle in the film depicts a battle between US troops and armoured German units comprising of Tiger tanks and Jagdpanzer Self Propelled Guns. The tanks are depicted as ugly, iron monsters whose approach makes the ground shake, inducing fear in the soldiers as they approach. The result is a mix of the real and surreal which works stunningly.
Like the landing at Omaha beach the ensuing battle is depicted as chaotic and random, and following no particular pattern. The acts of individuals at certain points determine the outcome as opposed to planning, direction, and strategy.

What denies the film five stars in my opinion is its characterisation. Tom Hank's school teacher turned army captain is not particularly believable. His platoon have so many fractious characters that in real life, they would struggle to achieve the required cohesion of a fighting unit.
Put that aside though and you are left with a fine war movie which packs the timeless message that war is an horrific experience for the particpants. It is as simple as that.",1106697600,6,3390,4.791452991452991
1242623,2,B00000K3AM,"This is a mediocre war movie at best. Yes, it has excellent special effects and I admit it set a new standard for Hollywood when it comes to ""combat cinematography"" - these same special effects techniques were used in Band of Brothers and Pearl Harbor and they are the best I've seen to date in a Hollywood movie.

However, that is all this film has going for it.  When it premiered people were in ""shock and awe"" of the graphic depiction of warfare.  Yes, warfare is ugly, brutal, and shocking.  But simply splattering soldiers' guts across the scene doesn't make a great movie.  Great movies require good plots, great writing, and believable characters and situation.  This movie has none of these.

I would first like to briefly state that this film actually does an injustice to the men who fought at Omaha by making their advance seem easier than it was.  Yes, the film depicts many men dying horrible deaths on the beach.  However, the real battle for Omaha was a day long ordeal.  This film makes it appear that the men landed, blew a hole in some wire, shot a few men manning machine guns, then moved off the beach and cleared the cliffs beyond.  Yes, it showed a lot of men dying in the process, but the process feels as though it took minutes, not all day.  The film The Longest Day did a much better job of creating the illusion of expansion of time despite being made nearly 60 years before this film. This film simply sought to shock its audience with a lot of gore like a horror movie, not portray the prolonged and brutal struggle endured by the men on that beach that day.

Furthermore, the plot is simply ludicrous.  The US Army would not blindly send six men plus a Captain traipsing though hundreds of miles of enemy held territory just in the off-chance that they might come across one man in particular.  In war, such ""luxuries"" don't exist.

As a Captain, Tom Hanks' character would be a company commander, responsible for at least two platoons and far too busy to be assigned to such a capricious task with only five other men.

Speaking of the men, how these motley soldiers ever make it through boot camp?  They're constantly bickering with their Captain - clearly a superior officer who would NOT be taking any guff from a private - especially in the field in a combat situation.  This begs the question how the ""school teacher"" ever reached the rank of Captain in the first place.  Never in this film does he show any effective leadership skills nor does he demonstrate conviction of his decisions.  In one scene he has to be rescued by his sergeant as his men are all at each others throats, yelling at each other, and causing much panic and chaos.  No officer, let alone a Captain, would ever let a situation deteriorate to the point that it does in this film.

Regarding the German prisoner they released that many claim to have returned at the end.  The solider released after the combat at the radar site was regular army - Deutsche Wehrmacht.  Those solders fighting in the town at the end are SS.  While lay people may not know the difference, there is a major difference.  Some say he was ""pressed into service"" by the SS.  Even if that were so, they certainly wouldn't have issued him a new uniform in the day or two that elapsed between his release and the town battle.  One does not have the luxury of getting a fresh change of clothes in the middle of an ongoing battle.  These were two different men.

Oh, and about the battle at the end, the fiction employed for the sake of Hollywood is laughable.  During this battle some men are bashing mortar shells on the ground and then throwing them like grenades. Mortar shells are not armed by simply jarring them.  If that were true it would be impossible to transport them safely.  They are armed by an arming pin at the base of the mortar tube into which they are dropped.  It's the same mechanism that causes the powder charge to explode that propels the shell out of the tube.  The pin fits up the center of the base of the mortar round  - a rock won't do it.  Even if we say it could, the act of hitting the round on the ground would then cause the propellant charge to ignite, forcing the round out of the hand of the person ""whacking"" it.  This entire concept of this as depicted in this film is preposterous.

There are so many other issues with this film that there isn't room to cover them all - from poorly written dialog, to technical inaccuracies, to forgettable characters and implausible situations.  Those already presented give a good idea of the flaws in this film.

If you just want to watch a movie to be ""shocked and awed"" by eye candy, I can see this film being entertaining.  But if you're looking for an enduring, believable war story with memorable characters you need to look elsewhere. Those who enjoy this film will probably enjoy U-571 as well.",1105401600,38,4858,4.497716894977169

The cast and crew do a good job, but for some reason, this film just doesn't stick with me.

You find yourself totally immersed in the characters and the dilemna that the film deals with.  After the movie was over I actually felt exhausted from the sense that I was right there experiencing the horrors of war.

Adding to the intensity of the experience is the beautiful score by John Williams and the power of the sounds of war.

Saving Private Ryan isn't mindlessly patriotic just because it has an American flag waving in the breeze - it's just a film that actually SHOWS what happened to these young men during World War 2. And what's this about how American soldiers were no better than the Nazis, and they were all they did were rape women and pillage European towns? Watch the documentary of the Easy Company veterans on the Band of Brothers DVD, see the veterans breaking down, recalling memories of their best friends getting blown to bits. Americans did not intentionally bomb Dresden; it was a mistake made by the crew of the plane marking targets for the incoming bombers. The many thousands of people killed by Nazi bombers destroying London, however, was intentional.

My own grandfather participated the the taking of Omaha Beach on D-Day, and I don't think I've ever been more angered by what Jargo has to say about an entire generation of fighting men that lost their best friends over in Europe. Just because segregation and racism existed during that time DOES NOT MEAN that the soldiers were any more despicable because of it. Besides, there aren't too many American veterans living in Finland, so what does he know about it?

To me, Saving Private Ryan is the best movie I've ever seen. Sure, there's a couple production errors here and there, but the excellent acting, gritty realism, spectacular musical score and intense action hold your interest throughout. It's all the more amazing that Spielberg did this entire film without any storyboards whatsoever.

We goofed off and did stupid things before the movie and honestly I was expecting some kind of an action movie or something.  I was sorely mistaken.  After about fifteen minutes into it I realized how hard this was going to be to watch, I think I even got a little sick from sitting so close and eating a bunch of candy and junk before the movie even started.  There were also two veterans in front of us who shortly after the movie started began to sob.  I could hear them crying in the darkness and it made the movie even that more emotional for me.

1242632,5,B00000K3AM,"I have watched 'Saving Private Ryan' about five times, and not once has it failed to bring tears to my eyes. Of course, that's me because I am intimately interested in World War 2 history, and any good story from those frontlines can make me emotional. The other reason is that Cornelius Ryan's epic novel on D-Day, 'The Longest Day' was the first artifact of war I had to contend with when I was in school. The story inspired me so much that time that I will never ever forget the 101st US Airborne Division. The interesting thing about Saving Private Ryan- one may ask, why so much ado about saving one man? Many people thought that the movie was unrealistic because the mission was unrealistic, not to mention logistically wasteful; six men putting their lives at stake for one man, just because he is the last of his brothers to be living. I superficially agree with these critics, and I am sure that there must have been hundreds, if not thousands of mothers, who lost all their sons in the war. So why all the jazz about the mission, the man, and the movie?

The answer comes during a poignant scene when Captain John H Miller (Tom Hanks) explains it all. Quite simply, he says that the mission might sound ludicrous, but the fact is that he won't feel like going home to his wife if he doesn't complete it. For me, that's the reason the movie was made, to show how every mission and the most mundane of objectives fits in with the big picture. It's important to realise that without these 'mundane' objectives getting fulfilled, the big picture holds no promise at all. If the men and women who are entrusted with them don't hold them up in front of their soul, the struggle is as good as lost, in peacetime and in wartime. In my opinion, it's much more than merely following orders. We see this quality in the bravest people in history, many of whose stories won't be ever heard because they sacrificed their lives for freedom. For me, the movie is most interesting because it brings up the eternal conundrum of war (and peace): how does one man's life compare with the 'greater good' of society? But for people like John Miller, it was not a conundrum, but a simple duty, the failure to fulfil which would have made them feel unsatisfied throughout life. That the secondary school grammar teacher from rural Pennsylvania, wrenched from his simple life and thrown into the enforced throes of war, comes to terms with this conundrum, is as sobering and inspiring as anything can be.

My favourite scene? Just before the last battle, Miller and Ryan (Matt Damon) are reliving some of their memories. Ryan recalls a boisterous and hilarious situation with his brothers. Miller says that his wife used to say something about the rose garden. But when Ryan asks him to tell him that story, Miller says, 'No...I think I will keep that one for myself'. It's as if he knows that he is going to die, and wants to preserve one last shrad of private memory of his wife with him.

At this point, I suddenly remember one of my favourite quotes by T. S. Eliot. The quote is applicable to many of the central themes in human life, and certainly to one as soul searching as war and peace:

""We shall not cease to explore,

and the end of all our exploring

will be to arrive where we started,

and know the place for the first time""

Apart from more blood and violance this films offers nothing more than scenes stolen from comic books which Steven had read when he was a kid and was playing war all the time. Here we have a basic plot in which diehard soldiers are searching for certain Ryan and then die protecting him from idiotic,brain-washed and head-shaved Jerries. Their leader (Tom Hanks) is also despertly trying to find Johny Walker (read :a good old whisky).How else explain his ""cunning"" decisions (sending his only medic to charge on Germans) and why his hands are often trembling.
But what made me laugh the most are those Irish soldiers badly disguised as Germans. They look like some strange mixture of sadistic neo-nazis and a mob of cowards. They charge disorganized and die like flies or flee like rabbits. You may start to wonder how on earth Germans managed to capture nearly all Europe.",1097712000,10,1258,4.938679245283019
1242635,1,B00000K3AM,"The more I think about it the more I realize how bad, if not insulting, this movie is. It seems to me like Steven is merely following an unoriginal formula to make big bucks and win academy awards. Look at the facts. He gets a mega-star, Tom Hanks, to play the lead role, then he gets teen-heart-throb Matt Damon to play private Ryan. Then he makes an ultra violent war movie were OF COURSE the audience will feel moved. Other than that this movie has very little else to offer. My dad is a veteran, and I find this movie insulting because it  is obviously  profiting from really horrible events. It made me sick to my stomach. Other than that I must admit this film does do a good job of showing the horror of war,  and by writing this review I abosoIutly mean no disrespect to the troops that served our country in WWII.",1097193600,19,822,4.290322580645161
1242636,5,B00000K3AM,"Since ""Schindler's List"", it has slowly dawned on me that Steven Spielberg may be our greatest director.  The commercial successes of his early career may have soured some to his artistry but let's face the facts.  Spielberg has tackled films from varied genres and has succeeded in most of the endeavors he has attempted.  In the pantheon of Spielberg's successes I place ""Saving Private Ryan"" a notch below ""Schindler's List"" not on the strength of Spielberg's direction but on some inherent weaknesses in the script by Robert Rodat.  The film opens with an elderly Private Ryan at the gravesite of his fallen comrades in Normandy flashing back to the D-Day invasion(how can Ryan flash back to this? He was a paratrooper?).  The re-enactment of the invasion of Normandy Beach may be the most powerful scene ever transferred to film.  After, opening your film with such an effective salvo how do you top it?  Well, there is a story to be told.  Captain Miller(Tom Hanks) is given an order to locate Private Ryan, who lost three brothers in combat, with the aid of his charges behind enemy lines and bring Ryan back home.  For the most part the scenes involving Miller and his men involve the debate as to why it's so important to find Ryan and more importantly why we're fighting this war.  Miller's squad consists of the usual multi-ethnic types including a pacifist (Jeremy Davies) who is supposed to provide counter-point to the pro-war sentiment.  Intermittently there are skirmishes to break up the monotony.  Once the men locate Ryan (Matt Damon), the results are somewhat interesting, to some disappointing.  Aside from Spielberg's solid direction, what bonds this film together is another sterling effort by Tom Hanks (yes, he is our greatest actor).  He perfectly captures the essence of a man who would rather be home teaching in Pennsylvania but inherently understands the reasons for his fighting and maintaining the morale of his men despite personal doubts of his own. While I stated up front that the film is slightly marred by inconsistencies in the script, there is no doubt as to where Spielberg stands on the righteousness of waging this war.  Ultimately, this film is a tribute to the servicemen who selflessly won this war.",1097193600,2,2245,4.933510638297872
1242637,5,B00000K3AM,"With its gritty realism, top-notch acting for, gripping battle scenes and thorough character development, Saving Private Ryan has earned its place as argubly the greatest war movie of all time.

It's easy to make a war movie with a heroic character or two, and these days its easy to make a war movie look good, and good acting isn't terribly hard to attain, but combining all of these characteristics and throwing in a real moral dilemma (not a tacked on sappy conclusion) and brilliant characterization and you've got a great movie.

I failed to mention Spielberg's direction, which is exemplary as usual (why no one likes this guy is beyond me, he's only made Jaws, Indiana Jones, this, Schindler's List and a sleu of wonderful movie), the special effects which are always convincing and often harrowing, the color-saturated film stock, and battle scenes bookending the film which are nothing short of awe-inspiring.

1242638,5,B00000K3AM,"I came to see Spielberg's film without expecting anything special or groundbraking but the movie is without a doubt the best war film ever made, even though some expert critics disagree in favor of older films. Spielberg did an excellent work giving the full sense of battle horror and, in my opinion, he achieved the top mark in war movies combining some really fantastic abilities: he filmed most of the battle scenes from behind the shooters, he never used an immobile or standing camera, he had terrific sound effects of the weapons and the sounds of battle, he took extra care to trivial details like uniforms, hair cutting, weapons, sweat, blood etc., he presented German (and Waffen SS soldiers in particular) in a marvelously authentic way, he built his story with an excellent pace and he communicated the real stress and nerve racking of close combat to the people who never had to live through this experience. Most critics praise the initial 20 minutes of the film, when the Normandy landings are realistically presented in the infamous ""Omaha"" beach, and although I agree that this is the best landing sequence ever put to film, I think that it is unfair to underestimate the last climactic battle of the movie in the half destroyed French village, where the agony of the uneven struggle against a numerically superior and fanatical enemy (and far better armed with the full panoply of war tools) makes a real war thriller. The fans of military history will find no better war movie and no other screen spectacle better manipulated than this one, created by the ""magician"" Spielberg at his prime.",1096848000,7,1609,4.875912408759124

That is why Capt. Miller(Tom Hanks)and a group of soldiers were sent on a mission to save private Ryan because he was the only son left of three to survive the war,whose mother has no one left in her family.",1095379200,2,537,4.264705882352941

1242641,2,B00000K3AM,"Spielberg's movie, ""Saving Private Ryan"" was considered by many as one of the greatest war movies. It has a very thin story line, but is a typical hollywood version of WWII. While it shows how bad war can be along with the comradeship, leadership and the bonding in war, it is a long line of war movies that glorifies the allied struggle and adds too much melodrama.

Let us start with the Omaha beach battle. The biggest flaw here is that they try to take the beach without any air or sea cover. Any one who is well versed in war would tell you that if you try to take a beach without cover, you will suffer heavy casualities. No army would commit such a tactical error. If you have good cover, then there is a good chance of taking such a beach. This was a mistake in the movie. Spielberg has not done enough research before putting together his movie. He should read authors like Ian McEwan who went to the British War Museum library and did their research before writing books like ""Atonement"". Basically the movie while well scripted uses patriotism and some good acting to capture the audience. It follows a long list of World War II movies that are not even handed in their portrayal. I guess that since most people do not read about the war itself, they see the movies and accept that as the reality. Rommel took Tobruk with 70 tanks, it was thanks to some clever maneuvering by the British that he did not take Alexandria. He was 40 miles from there, he lost because he did not get his supplies in time, not because he or his army was not brave or clever. Luck has a lot to do with winning, as was said by Napolean.

I am tired of this one sided movies that portray the glories. The Germans lost a lot due to their own follies and things like the offensive against Russia, Barbarossa, cost them heavily due to the bitter cold. No one mentions this in the movies. Even when the German High Command asked Hitler to retreat, he would refuse to do so. That was his mistake. He had an uncanny way of sizing up his enemies and only in the end he overreached himself. I am glad that he lost, but it is due to a combination of circumstances. There were more Indians in British army who lost lives than Canadians or Australians. This is never mentioned in any movie. India lost close to 100000 people in WWII, but thanks to their color, they are not considered important. They served in British armies all over North Africa and Europe. They fought some of the fiercest battlest against Rommel.

I am tired of this hollywood stuff that cranks out the same genre in different form over and over again. I wish that they realize that people would like to see more than the same old Tom Hanks stuff, it is getting overplayed. One reviewer said that this was probably the best movie except for Braveheart, that goes to show how little people care for veracity and more for fluff. I recently saw one documentary that showed two Jewish men from Czeck republic who had been through the holocaust who went back to the concentration camp they came from. One of them mentioned that one of the SS men hated his job so much that he rather be transfered to the army in the eastern Europe, which would mean certain death. Few holocaust movies ever mentions such an incident, as they always want black and white. Movies about war also should portray some even handedness. Otherwise, it is farcical and boring.",1094688000,7,3392,4.441412520064206

The real stars of this film are the sound, cinematography and editing. Out of all of the films that I have seen that were made in the 90's, this has to be best of those three. The camera work is awesome. They used a type of camera that made the images look more documentary-like which enhanced the feel of the movie. The sound is earth shattering.

2) This sequence has NOTHING to do with the rest of the movie! You could actually remove it, and the rest of the film would not be affected.

All in all the film is an amazing portal into the Normandy invasions and spares us the Hollywood glitz that too many war movies in the past have shown. Tom Hanks best role and Stephen Spielbers finest moment on the silver screen. The tandem is golden and certainly showed in the ""follow up"" Band of Brothers.

The production shots are memorable and even, at one point, include a beach scene viewed through blood on the camera lens.  The first 20 minutes are absolutely hypnotizing.  However, I take exception with the portrayal of Americans shooting those Germans who wished to surrender.  This undoubtedly occurred but it was a very rare circumstance.  Here it happened three times within a company of 200 men.
Guy Sager, in his ""Forgotten Soldier,"" documented that Wermacht soldiers like himself intentionally sought out Americans for the purposes of surrender.  To suggest otherwise is fallacious.  Also, Edward Burns character seems more suited to the post-sixties ""question authority"" environment than to WW II.  America was different at that time.  This was the Greatest Generation.  Not the ""me"" generation.  Burns is misplaced.  I also thought the cowardice of Ryan at the end was contrived.

I think every generation should pay tribute to the soldiers today and tommorrow who die willingly for our freedom. Spielberg has accomplished something with this film that touches upon both American pride and on the humanness of war. The scenes on the Normandy beach will reach in and grab ahold of your heart; torturing you beyond belief. But then pride will well up inside that same heart and your entire being will cheer as the first soldiers scale the hill. The movie just continues from there with scene after scene of triumph and terror with a storyline that will match the action in intensity, something rarely found these days.
I hope you will watch and say a prayer for all those souls who fought so bravely for American freedom. Remember those who fight today and hope that it isn't in vain.

1242658,5,B00000K3AM,"The opening sequence of this film alone is worth the purchase price. Without doubt it is the most wrenching, realistic combat sequence ever filmed. Many of the incidents associated with the landing are lifted from Steven Ambrose's excellent book, D Day, since he was a technical advisor to Speilberg. However, to a military man what gives the landing scene amazing verisimilitude is the professionalism of the company commander and his first sergeant, each in separate landing craft. Hanks, who plays the Ranger company commander, is shaking from accumulated combat stress to the point that he is barely able to drink from a canteen. Yet he maintains his composure, cares for his men, and most importantly focuses on accomplishment of his mission despite a landing degenerated into chaos.
Next to a parachute drop the most confusing entry into a battlefield is across a hostile beach. No where is this better portrayed than in Saving Private Ryan. Throughout the film the character, courage and depth of American fighting men is exemplified and respected.
The plot is taken from fact. A soldier in the 101st Airborne lost a brother in the China-Burma-India Theater, another on Utah Beach and a third with the 82nd. In reality a message was sent to the commander of the 101st, General Max Taylor, and the soldier was evacuated across the beach. In Saving Private Ryan, the story becomes a metaphor for the war itself. In what seems a confusing statement Hank's sergeant says 'This could be the best thing we've ever done.' The viewer is uncertain if he is referring to the last, frantic battle to defend a bridge - a critical invasion choke point - or saving Ryan. Or both. That is just one of several mysterious facets that keeps you coming back to the film. What does he really mean here? It is much more than simply an adventure story though as such it can hardly be equalled.
Speilberg has said that he intended this to be an anti-war film. That is also confusing in that his Jewish prisoners were rescued by an Allied advance in Shindler's List and would have died without victory in the war. Perhaps he is caught up in some PC. Nonetheless, these are nits and do not detract from the overall impact of the film.

Yes, it's carnage, it's horrible, it's relentless, it's bloody, it's random death, it's a portrayal of fear and courage and raw coincidence. But it's also one of the most powerful pieces of cinematography ever filmed.
There are many other scenes that have stayed with me during the years since I last saw this unforgettable film, perhaps Spielberg's best ever. Perhaps the most poignant one that comes immediately to mind is the woman whose sons are all away at war. She's on a remote farm, washing dishes, and thru her window she sees the dust of approaching cars. She goes outside to meet the visitors, tenses as she sees military brass and a chaplain step from the cars, then crumples wordlessly to the worn boards of her front porch as she tries to take in the news: all her boys have been killed, except for one: Private Ryan.
Another related scene, the one that came just before this one, is equally gut-wrenching (and in both scenes, there is no dialogue, just heart-stabbing visuals that are more powerful than any words could have been) as a woman charged with sending out letters of the We Regret to Inform You variety realizes that she's seen three letters with the same address within the past few days, and she takes this terrible proof to her supervisor - and thus is born the search for the surviving son, to bring him home to his momma.
Tom Hanks, with his own persona of morality and honesty, is perfectly cast as the good Captain Miller, a soldier's soldier charged with this onerous task, and of course there is terrible cost.

1242662,2,B00000K3AM,"Beautifully shot, especially the opening sequence on D-Day, but ultimately, there's one glaring flaw in this movie.  Steven Spielberg just doesn't understand the army.  If the Chief of Staff wanted to pull a private out of a line unit in another theater of operations, he wouldn't dispatch a squad of rangers to go traipsing around the French countryside to find him.  The C-of-S would contact the theater commander, who would then contact the corps commander, who would contact the division commander, the brigade commander, the battalion commander and finally, the company commander, who would send his first sergeant to find the soldier and get him out of the Area of Operations, or AO.  In fact, this is how it happened to the real private Ryan (it's documented in the book, ""Band of Brothers"").  Why does this matter?  Because the rangers spend most of the movie complaining about how the army clearly values this Private Ryan's life over theirs, and if a commander ordered them on a mission like this, they'd be right, but no commander with half a brain would do it.
It's important to remember that when he was first promoting it, Spielberg tried to sell Private Ryan as an antiwar movie, and in antiwar epics, American officers do blown-brain things like wasting lives for no reason.  The reality is that most commanders won't send their men out on pointless missions, but don't try to sell that in Hollywood.",1080259200,8,1416,4.875

And I have thought ever that D-DAY is USA military's overwhelming victory to Germany. But in the intro of this movie, the thinking that I have held was reversed, that is, the scene was USA's tragedy that USA was assulted from Germany in hills when USA landed in Ohama beach. Because I had the question that the story was truth? I examined about Ohama War in inter-net. And I understood that the tragedy was truth. I was very surprised.
And I was very surprised about that the movie's making skill was wonderful. For instance,to the bullet's sound effect in the landing scene of Ohama I very surprised. The sound was very real. As if I existed in Ohama. Concretly the bullet's repeling sound to miritary's protecter, and explosion sound of bombs.
Not only intro's Ohama scene but also in last scene I was moved very much, that is, an offensive and derfensive battle in the bridge. That scene was very real. Especally the scene that a tank come in the town where USA force hided. The skill of making film, that is, in farst I heared the caterpillar's sound of the tunk and in next heared the talking sound of Germany's militaly, and finally in far place the shadow of the tunk..
For the moment that the tunk was coming, since I was very nervous I sweated very.
The movie makers must have known about techniques how to take a film for exciting audiences. incredible.
From first to last, that was a movie that I was moved.

1242665,5,B00000K3AM,This is by far the best war movie I have ever seen. I have owned this movie since it came out and I still watch it all the time. No other movie I know of gets you this close to the action.,1078963200,,188,3.5
1242666,5,B00000K3AM,"This is without a doubt Steven Spielberg's best movie (or at least most realistic movie along with Shindler's List).  This is my favorite movie.
The story is simple, Eight Men are sent on a public relations mission to rescue a private (Matt Damon) who lost his 3 brothers.  Tom Hanks stars as John Miller, the leader of the squad sent to rescue him.  The film is extremely dramatic, sad, depressing, and graphic.  These are the elements that let you know it's GOOD.  If you're looking for an action movie, this isn't for you.  Although there are action scenes, this isn't an action movie.  It's a war movie, the Best one ever made.  It bugs me as people see this as an action movie and nothing more.
This is the only movie i almost cried at.  It was when Arwen Wade, the medic, is shot and bleeds to death.  The saddest part is his last words ""i wanna go home, i wanna go home! momma! momma...."" When you see this one scene, you will understand why Spielberg won Best Director.  Also, i can't understand how a horrible movie like Titanic can win 11 oscars, and this wins 5!!! what's wrong with the oscars???!!! This movie deserved a lot more oscars, including Best Picture, without a doubt.",1078876800,3,1190,4.488372093023256
1242667,3,B00000K3AM,"I found Saving Private Ryan to be a lot less enjoyable than I hoped it would be.  It was, of course, extremely impressive in its scope, remarkable in terms of its humanity and most stunning in visual and audio effects.
But the writing and much of the acting was rather poorly done.  I really enjoy dialogue and the interaction of characters and while some of the key roles in the movie had interesting things to say, they always managed to say it in a way that made me less interested than I should have been.  This prevented me from getting absorbed into the story.
It could have been a great movie, but it fell short.",1078358400,4,619,4.3652173913043475
1242668,5,B00000K3AM,"Mr. Spielberg won his second Oscar for Best Director for this incredibly detailed War epic.  I'll start off with a minor negative criticism.  The main story that ensues after the D-Day invasion is a little thin, and it carries on to the end without much in the way of sub-plot.  However, that is the only negative I can find in this otherwise remarkable film.  I still find it needling that this film lost the Oscar for Best Picture to ""Shakespear in Love.""  ""Saving Private Ryan"" did win 5 Oscars, 4 of which were for technical achievements: Cinematography, Film Editing, Sound, and Sound Effects Editing.  The 5th Oscar went to Spielberg for bringing all these great elements together.  For the most part the acting is solid, with only a couple standout performances.  Tom Hanks is good here, without ever becoming overbearing in the midst of the chaos.  In fact, his character is more self-reflective and philosophical than is usual for a lead character in a War film, which makes his performance all the more interesting.  His performance was the only one here that was nominated for the Oscar.  But there is one performance here that should have been recognized as well.  Tom Sizemore, always the professional supporting actor, is the tough-minded soldier holding everyone together with his immense presence.  He has yet to disappoint me in any of his films, but if I had to choose my favorite from all his roles, his work here proudly stands out.  The realistic battle sequences are intense and terrifying.  There is one scene in particular that invokes dread every time I watch it.  It's a hand-to-hand knife fight in a small room that is so unnerving that I'm getting chills just relating the scene.  No one is coming to either combatant's aid, only one will come out of the bloody situation alive.  At one point the American soldier tries to stop the fight through reason, where they could both stop and just end the fight.  I was hoping for that positive outcome, but it never arrives.  That is just one of many gut-wrenching scenes.  This is a far cry from the John Wayne era of films like ""The Sands of Iwo Jima"" where the men get shot, no blood is to be seen anywhere, and they fall over dead.  For what it's worth, ""The Sands of Iwo Jima"" did use some authentic stock-footage edited into the film for more realism.  But it never reaches the graphic reality of ""Saving Private Ryan.""  This is a technical masterpiece from one of the greatest film directors of all-time, and quite possibly the greatest War film yet made.",1078358400,2,2533,4.704545454545454
1242669,5,B00000K3AM,"Steven Spielberg is a favorite director of mine. His outstanding contribution to cinema include the films SCHINDLER'S LIST, E.T, JAWS, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND. Then came his brainchild, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. It's a unforgettable film achievement that won five Academy Awards, including best director, but was robbed of the Best Picture award to SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE. Nevertheless, this film has had a philosophical and lasting influence to the way war films should match.
The World-War II era based film is loaded with powerful and graphic war scenes and the film's message is profound. Honor, dignity, and courage is spread throughout the film.
Outstanding actor Tom Hanks portrays Captain John Miller who leads his troops through the historic D-day invasion during WWII. He and his deticated men then embark on a dangerous mission to track down Private James Ryan, whose three brothers died on enemy line, and bring him home.
The production values are amazing. The cinematography is well-done, it sort of has a documentary feel to it. The sound is the best I've heard in a film ever! It sounds great on the DVD! The D-Day intro is absolutely breathtaking.
Spielberg made his usual masteriso work into making this the most realistic vision of any war film. It could have been the best, if the film would have a better story. But I mean that in the nicest way!
Recommended all the way!",1077148800,,1422,4.904564315352697

Well through this journey the men in Tom Hanks squad find out who they truly are. The acting in this movie is topped only by the incredible action scenes. And trust me people, its a little gory, not the goriest movie ever made by far, but it has its really nasty moments so this isn't for little children.

1242672,4,B00000K3AM,"Saving Private Ryan is the best, if not one of the best war films ever made.  It certainly is realistic and intense enough to be.  Tom Hanks delivers a fine performance as the captain of an army unit.  Director Steven Spielberg creates the film which some say he was born to make.
  Ryan, starts out with the D-Day Invasion, which is filmed so realistically and is truly one of the best battle sequences ever filmed.  That scenes alone earns the film the ""R"" rating.  Tom Hanks plays Captain Miller, a captain in search of a private who he must find and bring back home after his 3 brothers are killed in action.  The film features an ensemble cast of great actors, from Tom Sizemore to Edwards Burns, to Matt Damon, to Vin Diesel, to Barry Pepper to Giovanni Ribisi and Adam Goldberg.  For being a 1998 release and then being re-released in February of 1999, this film does feature excellent battle sequences which are very realistic and well done for being a 1998 release.
  It's easy to see why this film won 5 Academy Awards at the Academy Awards in March of 1999.  It won the award for Best Director, which it truly deserved.  There have been other great war movies including Black Hawk Down, Platoon and We Were Soldiers but none as good as Saving Private Ryan.
  Saving Private Ryan is rated R for Intense Prolonged Realistically Graphic Sequences of War Violence, and for Language.  The violence as I've stated earlier is extremely graphic, specifically the opening battle sequence of D-Day.  The violence includes guns, others explosives and explosions and knives.  The language is reasonable and not too strong or pervasive.  Spielberg's direction is assured and powerful in crafting this masterful war epic.  The acting is superb and the script is sharp.  Definetly worth owning on Video or DVD.  I hope they re-released in theatres again, because it's that good.",1075161600,,1874,4.7725856697819315

Is Matt Damon a chunky dude in this movie or what! It is definently worthy of a rental but, I wouldn't purchase.",1073692800,3,468,4.269662921348314
1242674,4,B00000K3AM,"Two things prevent me from giving this otherwise great movie five stars. First is Tom Hanks' unbelievably underplayed, at times bland, performance. Whether this was what Spielberg wanted or how Hanks interpreted the role, his Captain Miller sometimes seemed to just disappear off the screen even while he was giving orders. Second, the framing device of the old man in the cemetery was maudlin and treacly. It was just an obvious attempt at tugging at the old heartstrings. The only thing missing was having Captain Miller's ghost appear and give Senior Citizen Ryan a salute back.
And that's that. Otherwise, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN stands out as one of the best movies of its genre. People DO have to be reminded that war is hell, that war is bad, that war is the most awful waste of lives. (The film's extraordinary battle sequences will be talked about for years, and have already influenced several directors.) People DO have to remember that the Nazis--and I don't mean all the Germans, just the Nazis, specifically--were brutal. And we DO have to remember the bravery and heroism of the American soldiers who fought in that most violent of conflicts. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN helps us to recall or, for those too young to remember, to learn about these things.",1073606400,2,1258,4.883177570093458
1242675,5,B00000K3AM,"I saw this movie when it first came out to the theaters.  I had been fore-warned about some ""unsettling"" scenes at the beginning of the movie.  Indeed, there is a graphic depiction of the horrors of war that should leave all viewers ill at ease (to say the least).  Many people may object to these scenes.  I came to the conclusion that Spielberg intended to give his audience a glimpse of the horror and chaos of war.  I believe that he did so, not so much to shock us, but to give us a greater appreciation of what our veterans endured in times of war (and that, in turn, IS shocking).  If this movie had accomnplished nothing else, it deserves our appreciation for that one aspect.  I think that we at home appreciate the risk and the sacrifices that our men and women in the military services accept.  We just never got such a lesson in what they went through before.  Imagine having to keep your wits about you when all that carnage is happening all around you to people you know and care about.  I think that this movie will be shown regularly on Memorial Day and Veterans Day as well it should.
That issue aside, there is a lot more to this movie and, again, it all points towards honoring the commitment of our men in uniform.  The very beginning of the movie sets us up for the idea that we are seeing this movie from the perspective of a veteran.  The story evolves that a group of soldiers are asigned a special task during the D-Day invasion aftermath.  The assignment itself seems impossible and there are times that a number of the men want to quit.  This serves as a reminder that soldiers aren't consulted on their missions, they simply go out and do what they are required to do, regardless of how much sense it makes.  Ultimately, the men, and the movie, reach a climatic point and we are reminded again about the horrors of war.  The movie concludes back in the present with a moving scene that shows the depth of the camaraderie of men that served in combat together.
This movie boasts many things including outstanding acting and direction.  The special effects, as mentioned, are outstanding.  There is a message about combat that is disturbing but very honest.  We see men doing things that appear very wrong to us sitting in our comfortable seats.  We see men who rise to the task as well as men who fail to meet the task.  This reminds us all that these soldiers are men who were called to battle.  They are like us but we are not like them.  They are in the arena and we are not.  What would we have done, how would we have coped, how would our comrades remember us?  All these questions are thrust at us and it underscores the message of the film; we have always lived amongst heroes who went off to war and quietly came back home.  Watch this movie and you will be better able to appreciate the veterans in your community.",1072569600,2,2850,4.391221374045801

1242678,3,B00000K3AM,"This is a pretty good movie from the production standpoint. The scenes are vivid, bloody, gory, disgusting, and in some parts surreal -- which many veterans say appropriately depicts how war feels. While I thankfully will probably never know what D-Day was like, this film gets us closer to knowing how it was than without it.
It needs to be gory. As one veteran put it in the 25 minute documentary (paraphrasing from memory), ""It's good to know the horrors of war. That way, we think twice about engaging in it."" Politics aside, that certainly has special meaning today. There are lots of additional points about the reality of day-to-day war, in all its unpleasantness.
However, I did not enjoy this movie. I'm a WW2 enthusiast. In fact, I recently came back from a trip to Normandy. I'm not going to go on about pointy factual historical inaccuracies, that exists in any film.
However, I found it truly offensive that the story involves only American soldiers, enemy German soldiers, and feeble French civilians. I've no problem with the point of view from an American unit, but in the story all the units get mixed up, intermingle with others, etc. But they don't seem to mix with British and Canadian troops for some reason. They never meet any members of the French Resistance, which numbered in the hundreds of thousands and were crucial to the Battle's success. Ditto for the Free French Forces, Polish forces, all of whom were also involved. In fact, the only mention of other Allied troops is through the nickname ""Monty"" referring to the British forces led by general Montgomery, that they called ""overrated"". They were not overrated. It's okay if one character says that, but it's insulting if it's the only mention of other countries' troops.
This is not only insulting to other veterans who also died in the war, but is a continuation of the propaganda that only America liberated France. Of the five Normandy beaches, only two were American, two more were British, and one was Canadian. We were all in this.
Responsible for this is the historical consultant, ""historian"" Ambrose. In the documentary recalling the context of D-Day, he doesn't even mention that its purpose was creating a 2nd front, to the Russian front, in fact he nor anyone else doesn't mention the Russians participation, and went so far as to say that without D-Day that Nazis would still be there today. Such blatant nationalist arrogance from a historian is simply not acceptable.
For decent retelling of D-Day, watch ""The Longest Day"", filmed on location, telling multiple sides of the story; it's not as well-made as Saving Private Ryan from a production standpoint, and the characters feel thin, but it's accurate. Also check out ""A Bridge Too Far"". Sadly, no recent film manages to adequately capture WW2; they're either biased, glorifying of war, touchy-feely, or generally demonising of German soldiers. If you're really serious about D-Day, go to Normandy, at Caen, Bayeux, Pointe-du-Hoc, Colleville-sur-mer, and the tons of museums there, especially the Caen Memorial.",1070668800,9,3063,4.996086105675147

the Omaha landings. No one leaving the theater after seeing this film will be any the smarter about the event. Although the scenes of Miller and his small Ranger company (68 men), as a
portrayal of companies A & B at Dog Green may pass a lax muster
as accurate, the general image of their experiences as typical
for those at Omaha during the first 90 minutes (0630-0800) are
completely false. The casualty rate for the period (by far the
worst that day at Omaha) were approx 11 1/2 percent, far fewer
than one one asume from watching Pvt Ryan. In fact, the entire 5th Ranger Battalion (under Col Schneider) landed but a 100-150
yards east of Miller's group and took but 1 percent wounded
moving to the shingle and to the top of the cliffs. The troops at Omaha , except for Miller's group (who moved west) WALKED
up the slopes to the bluffs - cliffs were only present at the extremeties of the 4.5 mile long landing area, and were not scheduled for assault.  The remainder of the movie has a totally
illogical plot, whereby troops (Miller) from Omaha beach are sent to move thru German lines to contact a kid inthe 101st.
Aside from the unliklihood of such a strategy actually working,
the fact was that the 4th Division at Utah Beach was in contact with the 101st from day 1. Historically, this film is a total
distortion of the Omaha Beach landings and introduces an unintentionally hilarius crackpot scheme to get Miller into more heroic action. Totally transparent. Totally nonsensical.",1069718400,15,1607,4.678445229681979

World War II was hell, but it was a necessary hell in which decent people were forced to give up some part of their humanity in order to stop an enemy that was really determined to wipe out the free world.  This film is about showing respect to those who risk their lives in order to make this a better and more peaceful world.
The middle part of the movie is a little bit weak and overlong;  I do believe the director and screenwriters could have done a better job with that part of the movie.
The movie does show how unpredictable, chaotic, and dangerous warfare is, and how the GREATEST reward for any soldier is trying to survive all of that.  For those people who criticize that this movie is not always 100% accurate, please keep in mind this is a fictional WWII movie; it is NOT suppose to be a documentary about WWII, D-DAY  or  how soldiers fight in a war.
The DVD version of the movie is pretty fine.  The picture quality is sharp and clear as expected, but I did notice during the famous first 30 minutes of the bloody Omaha landing scene that the top and bottom half of the picture seems to be cut off or missing.  There are also some good extras such as production notes, 2 theatrical trailers, and cast and filmmaker's biography info.
P.S.
For those who still doubt the plausibility of some of the movie's events, you may want to look at Stephen Ambrose's books BAND OF BROTHERS (US 101st Airborne Unit), D-DAY JUNE 6, 1944 (interviews with American, British, Canadian, French, and German veterans of D-DAY) and his other books.  Some of the movie's events were taken from these books.
And for those who believe the movie's ending is implausible, you can read the book STEEL INFERNO (written by Michael Reynolds, a retired British officer who is an expert on German panzer tactics) on pages 130-131, Chapter 11, it tells about an incident that took place at Villers-Bocage, France (6/13/1944) that is ALMOST similar to what see in the movie ending.",1064620800,4,2092,4.527851458885942
1242688,5,B00000K3AM,"According to veterans of D-Day, this is one of very few films which come about as close as possible to portraying what it is like to be there. Director Spielberg and his crew recreate the arrival of Allied forces at Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944, by using water-level and then ground-level handheld cameras during a 24-minute sequence of especially graphic carnage. Later, Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) and his men are given an assignment to locate Private James Ryan (Matt Damon) and remove him from harm's way because he is the only remaining of several Ryan brothers. (The others have died in battle serving elsewhere.) Stephen Ambrose discusses this situation in his book D-Day: June 6, 1944. Spielberg's primary purpose is to examine how those entrusted with this assignment react to the dangers which it involves. Their questions are understandable: Why is Ryan so important? How are we going to find him? Is it worth risking all of our lives by trying to save his? As the search proceeds,  Miller does his best to maintain the group's morale. He has his orders and is determined to follow them. It is important to keep in mind that Miller and his men have a special mission which is, in certain respects, is even more perilous because they face the same stiff resistance other Allied forces do but cannot be distracted from reaching their ultimate objective which is to find a human ""needle"" within the invasion ""haystack."" They cannot fall back, re-group, await reinforcements, call in air cover or artillery support, etc.
Nominated for eleven Academy Awards, this film received five (for direction, cinematography, editing, sound, and special effects editing) and each was deserved. Much as I admire Shakespeare in Love, I remain convinced that Saving Private Ryan should have received another Oscar as best film. For those of us who were not involved with D-Day and the period which immediately followed it, this film enables us to get a sense of what it was like. Obviously, heroic efforts to ""save"" Ryan provide the primary plot. However, I was (and am) most impressed by how Spielberg enables us to empathize with the legitimate concerns about what that ""salvation"" requires of those ordered to achieve it.",1063584000,2,2219,4.949061662198392

1242690,1,B00000K3AM,"I'm sure i'll get voted down on this one, but i don't understand why todays' directors have to be so graffic and get into such realizm. When your reading a book you need graffic explanaztions so you can picture in your mind what is going on but in a movie where the majority of people are looking for entertainment is another thing. We are living in real war times NOW and have been for sometime.  Maybe alot of Americans are looking for more blood shed, body parts being blown up and scattered all over the place, the cries of people in pain and suffering but  i don't.  What i see in daily normal life is enough.  War films are fine without getting the audience worked up and basically sick from some of the sights in this film.  To me that is not entertainment. If you want war realizm watch the news on TV, read the newspapers, or look outside your  own door or the place you work.  Better yet,,,,just watch all the coverage of 9/11.  I go to movies for one reason, to escape the daily life of realizm, the struggles, the hardships, this screwed up country and i go to be entertained.  The key word here is entertain.

1242693,5,B00000K3AM,"This movie is a very touching, very real story of war. Spielberg made no qualms about the raw violence shown in the movie. It's sickening, it's gruesome and it's real.
The cinematography in the film is very well done. The use of hend-held cameras and a special wash used during the processing of the film to flatten out the colors add a special touch, much like Spielberg's use of black and white in Schindler's List. Williams' score is muted and many times non-existent, which underscores the intensity of the action.
Hanks gives a great performance, although his character isn't as well developed as I would have liked. Several good performances were given by Jeremy Davies as the interpreter and Giovanni Ribisi as Wade. I especially likd Davies' character: at first he is timid, naive and passive, and by the end of the movie he is corageous, aggressive and violent. Spielberg wanted to show the effects of the war on the men, and it comes out in Davies' character, and to a lesser extent Hanks' character.
I saw this movie on opening day, and from start to finish I found it very compelling. But the moment that solidified this film in my mind as a great achievement came when the movie ended. The very large audience was extraordinarily silent, even as the credits rolled by. Nearly the entire audience sat still, until they shuffled out into the corridor. It's a very powerful, emotional, movie that does what every great movie should do: makes you feel.",1060128000,3,1461,4.755905511811024
1242694,5,B00000K3AM,"What follows is the review originally written for the local newspaper in 1998. On DVD the film still holds a great and lasting power.
War is a wasteful, hungry, evil, immoral and  all consuming machine driven by young men who simply want to finish their job and get home. It is not something to be glamorized (The GI JOE dolls), trivialized (the plastic M16's and Tommy Guns at Wal-Mart) celebrated (any number of combat potboilers) or forgotten (a few ignorant highschoolers  refusing  to stand during the  national anthem).
Although I never served in the armed forces or experienced combat, I hold the utmost respect and honor for the men and women who fought and paid the price for my freedom. I write that because it would sound most arrogant and self centered for me to say that because I have watched this film and read several World War II history books that I have experienced and therefore understand combat. I don't and pray I never will (or anyone else).
In a film filled with haunting and searing images, one particular stands out. In the present day, an aged veteran, staring at the white gravestones, crumples in tears at Normandy Memorial Cemetery. Spielberg allows us to rediscover that these pillars of marble were once breathing young men filled with hopes, aspirations, talents, flaws and fears. All lost in an instant.
Behind the veteran stand his children and grandchildren. The sacrifice he and his fellow soldiers made allowed his family to gain. His life is their (and our) legacy. Spielberg's purpose then as a film maker becomes clear. He will attempt to show the lives of the men now laying beneath the ground. It is an image I will not soon forget.
Like all good art, and this film is a very fine example, Saving Private Ryan evolves into something other than mere entertainment. It grabs the viewer by the heart and refuses to let go. It forces one to feel, contemplate, experience and remember. As it unfolds on the screen, the story becomes not only a cultural event but also a lesson in the grand extremes of human character.  Spielberg shows us the best and the worst man has to offer.
The story focuses on a small outfit led by Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) that is sent into the ravaged countryside to find the only surviving Ryan boy (three others have been killed). If they find the young man alive, he will get to return to his Iowa farm.
War corespondent Morley Safer has said that he defines courage as ""not what we do for ourselves but rather what we do for others."" That description well serves the actions of Captain Miller and his men as well as those of PVT. James Ryan. They place their job and their ultimate task (winning the war) as their goal. Many times in the film they are faced with choices that could easily allow them escape, and almost always they defer to the ""bigger picture"". These men depend on each other for survival. If they  focus  only  on self, they  will  all lose. Yes, they do a number of unsavory  things  (the  incident with the  German  POW just one example), but they are all too real as I've  heard  many such instances  from my grandfathers.
Spielberg and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski compose the film like a Robert Capa photograph: violent, immediate and personal. With it's washed out colors and hand held shots, the film  has the feel of a combat news reel.
Spielberg shows maturity as a filmmaker by muting John Williams' score. The characteristic fanfares and swelling marches are noticeably absent. The explosions, screams and ever-present rain serve as fitting soundtrack enough.
Unlike the cartoonish Lethal Weapon series, the slick James Bond films, the muscle-headed Rambo-fests, the Bruckheimer noise-assaults, Saving Private Ryan's violence is hap-hazard, clumsy, and ugly. There is nothing clean about combat. Bodies are ripped open, faces shot off and appendages torn. Frequently one looks his enemy in the eye as he kills him. Quite often, violence in films is used as a vehicle to stimulate the adrenaline glands enough to make an audience cheer and applaud. This film's battle scenes inspired me to hide and avert my eyes.  The auditorium watched in a tense and tearful silence.
Because of the battle scenes, Spielberg himself has forbidden his children from watching it. I agree.  In a great paradox, everyone should see this film, but it isn't for everyone.  Recent articles have hinted that the film almost received an NC-17 rating. I can't imagine a decent war film without such a rating.
The American every man cast is centered around the near perfect performance of Tom Hanks. Like the men in my family who fought, he (and his fellow actors) are not movie star perfect with Adonis-like bodies performing superhuman tasks. Hanks is slightly paunchy, handsomely homely,  haggard, shaking with a  fearful  palsy and often near tears. And yet despite all these all too human traits, he bravely leads his men.

This is simply not a film to be missed. It certainly is the best film of the year as well as one of the finest films ever made. It is a film to be remembered and celebrated.
In a way I suppose it is sad that it takes a piece of popular entertainment to force us into remembering history.  As if the stories of the relatives, the pledge of allegiance and the national cemeteries weren't enough. This film proves it isn't the format that counts, it's the remembrance and respect.
Shame on us if we forget the terrible sacrifice made on those few days of June 1944, shame on us if we forget why that sacrifice was made, and shame on us if we allow it all to happen again.",1058313600,3,5578,4.729618163054695
1242695,2,B00000K3AM,"Honestly, the only reason to see this film is the cinematography; it is one gigantic plot hole as it's told through the ""memories"" of ""Private Ryan"" who wasn't present through most of the action of the film. The characters are thinly developed stock war characters that we never really get to know (with the exception of Tom Hanks' character since he is an uberstar). I can't express my disappointment with this film after the critical praise heaped upon it. I'd recommend ""Thin Red Line"" over this any day! Just my opinion...",1058054400,6,526,4.791208791208791
1242696,5,B00000K3AM,"Saving Private Ryan, Steven Spielberg's acclaimed 1998 film about small-unit action during the early days of the Normandy battle, is perhaps one of Hollywood's best attempts to depict the horror and yet-mesmerizing spectacle of battle.  It reawakened an interest in World War II and spurred directors to make their war movies more graphically realistic.  Even more important, it made many of us sit up and realize just how much we owe to the rapidly dwindling number of World War II veterans...the men and women Tom Brokaw rightly calls ""the greatest generation.""
Based loosely on a real life incident of the war, Saving Private Ryan is the story of an 8-man squad of U.S. Army Rangers detailed to find Private James Ryan, a paratrooper whose three brothers - all soldiers serving in combat units - have lost their lives.  When Army Chief of Staff Gen. George C. Marshall (Harve Presnell) is told that Mrs. Ryan is going to get all three death-notification telegrams in one day, he orders that someone has to find the sole surviving Ryan boy in Normandy and ""get him the hell out of there.""
The officer assigned to lead this almost impossible task is Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks), who on D-Day saw action on Omaha Beach.  A veteran of many battles in the Mediterranean, Miller is chosen for his skill at undertaking tough assignments.  Relieved temporarily of his company command, Miller leads six Rangers and a company clerk/translator to find - and save Private Ryan.
While far from perfect, Saving Private Ryan was a daring gamble on Spielberg's part.  He had already delved into the horrors of the Holocaust in his 1993 Oscar-winning Schindler's List, but he had never devoted an entire film to combat before.  In most of his other World War II-era films, he had shown glimpses of the war.  In Saving Private Ryan he carries audiences into the middle of battle, never flinching or looking away from the worst spectacles of war.

Some reviewers, particularly from other nations which were combatants in mankind's greatest and bloodiest war, criticize Saving Private Ryan for not showing ""the full picture"" of the battle for Normandy. Had Spielberg done a remake of Zanuck's The Longest Day - to which this movie has been compared - the criticism would be valid.  The Longest Day - like the book of the same title - is a panoramic view of D-Day that encompasses all the nationalities involved, whether attackers or defenders.  Saving Private Ryan, however, is not a documentary about the entire Normandy invasion.  It is a look at the bond between soldiers in a small unit, and it shows the camaraderie and genuine affection soldiers feel for one another.  Furthermore, Steven Spielberg is an American director, so it is natural that he would tell his D-Day story from an American point of view.  Criticizing Saving Private Ryan for being focused on American soldiers is as absurd as criticizing Wolfgang Peterson for filming Das Boot from just the German point of view.  I'm sure the Soviet/Russian movies about what they call the Great Patriotic War don't show their Western Allies' point of view either.  This will be true of all the warring countries.  Each has stories to tell, and I am sure each has its own equivalent of Saving Private Ryan.
The DVD from Dreamworks Home Entertainment also includes a making-of featurette, two trailers, a cast-and-crew list, and a special message from the director.  Like all DVDs of Spielberg movies, there is no director's commentary.",1057708800,9,3480,4.91965811965812
1242697,2,B00000K3AM,"Mr. Spielberg clearly does not know what he is talking about. He acts as if he does, and the result is disastrous. The Normandy beach landings in the movie were historically inaccurate. The American shooting of prisoners are lauded as heroic and justified, and the German atrocities are given an evil tone. The script is hilariously bad, the actors can't act, and the result is a movie that is visually appealing to the uninformed- the people Spielberg likes to manipulate. It's is full of American flag-waving patriotic garbage, and it's not a coincidence that Spielberg (a Jew) is very anti-German. I'm not saying what the Nazis did was wrong, but Spielberg should not let personal feelings get in the way of making a historical movie.
The most obvious mistake is that during the last battle scene, the Germans rarely, if ever, shoot back. According to Captain Miller, these were men of the 2nd SS Panzer Division ""Das Reich"", which were some of the most skilled soldiers of WWII. They would definitely shoot back. The Americans also killed at least 200 of the Germans, not the 50 reported by the sniper.
Other than that, the movie is one of the goriest I have ever seen. Most of it is gratuitous and unneccessary, but, as Americans, we tend to like that kind of stuff.",1057536000,5,1271,4.72972972972973

The opening D-Day scene on Omahu Beach is terrific, it leaves you shacking almost! After that the movie becomes an almost routine tour-de-force of all the old GI squad flicks going back over the years. Its alomst like Speilberg watched every old GI WW2 movie ever made and took a piece out of each to mesh into this film. In a way its a tribute to the genre I suppose. The opening and closing scenes with Ryan and his family years later is a tear-jerker for sure. It would have been nice as well had Tom Hanks and co while searching for the elsusive Ryan might have come across some British and Canadians. This would have added greater depth and color to the movie and provided a little dfifferent perspective. Most Americans don't really know much about the British and Commonwealth contribution to the war, and this would have been a chance to show a little of it. Too bad. The equipment and gear is very accurate, the two German Tiger tanks and open topped assault guns get A+ from me! The battle in the town with the US paratroops is also good showing how confusing the opening Normandy battles were. The final battle at the bridge, while exciting, is fantastic. These are German Panzer Grenadiers, the best the Wehrmacht had, yet they seem to be portrayed a bit like key-stone cops! If anything it was often small German platoons holding off large numbers of green US troops in the Normandy bocage. Speilberg got it a bit wrong there, but something like that would not be so romatic for film goers. Final point, the P-51 should be a P-47 that knocks out the Tiger tank on the bridge at the end.

Theses two movies, Saving Private and The Thin Red Line are very similar movies about the point of view of war. In the movie Saving Private Ryan, the soldiers go through very painful experiences to save Private Ryan. During the process, the movie shows humanism and reality of the war. In the same way, The Thin Red Line tries to show humanism through the soldiers who are suffering from the cruelty of the war and the poor people with no guilt who become the victims. Also, the movie represents the time of war with reality very well. In those two movies, there are some horrible and cruel scenes, and they both deal with the
deaths of people. The focus of these movies is to make people think about war. People will say, How cruel the war is! That is so terrible. Thinks like wars must not happen again. In addition, both are quite serious but touching movies because even during the war, in those movies, people still know the dignity of human beings and people try to help others.

 However the problem with this film is Spielberg's storytelling, the cliches in the scenes, the forced romantic pseudo-patriotic air that you breath in each spoken scene. It is not told in a realistic way -a problem that Spielberg has in many of his films, he tends to sentimentalize and simplify- and the film becomes very uneven: perfect on the technical side, hollow, shallow on the dramatic side.
 Band of Brothers, however, did nail the misfortunes of soldiers in battle; and it felt real.
 One last thing: Saving Private Ryan did capture battles in a way no other film had, it took war scenes to another level in cinema, and that is a lot more than most war films -not all of them- had achieved in the past.
 And another one last thing, to people who like really good war films, I recommend: Paths of Glory, Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, Patton, Tora Tora Tora, Black Hawk Down, and, please, watch Band of Brothers, it is an INCREDIBLE miniseries.

1242707,5,B00000K3AM,"The combat footage in this movie is what truly makes it stand out. War is bloody, chaotic business, and Speilberg got that point across in the merciless opening scene, and the following combat scenes. It's not the retelling of the D-day landings, just a movie about a group of men who happened to be there. It's a shocking beginning to the movie, and really the part that sticks with you once it is over.
I was disappointed with the way the Germans were portrayed, simply a bunch of faceless automatons dressed in grey who either killed and died quietly or cried for mercy when surrounded. They might have been Nazis, and not very nice people, but they were also human; the fighting Germans were given all the depth of the stormtroopers in Star Wars. I would have expected more. The attempt to make an emotional, philosophical movie really dies here, when you realize that in this film, the Americans were the only people who suffered, and that the Germans were simply killing machines.
There are certainly some mistakes made in the filmmaking--no soldier in his right mind would walk along the top of a hill, backlit by the sun--but the depiction of what was going on in Normandy in the days after the landings is pretty true to the accounts of what actually went on, especially the confusion and disorganization of the airborne troops.
While most of the characters are pretty generic (there's even a guy from Brooklyn, for crying out loud), Tom Hanks's character really stands out. Hanks has a knack for playing everyman, and does so once again here with terrific skill.
While the plot wasn't the greatest and the characters are not really too deep (Uppum, along with Hanks's and Giovanni Ribisi's characters excepted), the combat footage in this movie is without peer, and that reason alone makes it one of the great war movies ever made.",1050537600,2,1841,4.75625

He does such a good job here. Speilberg gives what, by all accounts I've heard, is a very accurate depiction of the war. He doesn't spare us gore, he doesn't spare us emotion, and he doesn't spare us time (runs almost 3 hours). He gives us a good show. Tom Hanks gives a spectacular performance. As does Matt Damon, Vin Diesel (in a role that requires actual acting), and Barry Peppar--all early in their careers. There are also great performances by Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, Jeremy Davies, Ted Danson, Giovanni Ribisi, Joerg Stadler, and especially Adam Goldberg. Because of color desaturation and the cinematography, this feels more like a documentary or period piece. Great job.

1242710,3,B00000K3AM,"When I first went to see Saving Private Ryan at the cinema I was impressed. Extremely impressed. It hits you with a massive initial impact which takes a long time to wear off. After repeated viewings the cracks begin to show. If you took away the film making methods and the raw grittiness of the battle scenes (ie. the first 20 minutes and the denoument) you would be left with a fairly mediocre war film.
The characters are fairly weak. Make that very weak. In fairness, Hanks' character is solid (and the bit with the pool on what he does in civilian life works well). The others are largely cardboard stereotypes which touch all the bases in standard Hollywood fashion. None of this is really a reflection on the actors involved, so much as the result of a fairly weak and ultimately unadventurous script.
The storyline plods along. It really does. Apart from the occassional sudden eruption of extreme violence (though arguably this is in fact a realistic reflection of most wartime experiences - 90% boredom, 10% sheer terror). In doing so it manages to work in every cliche in the book. In terms of drama and quality of story there is NOTHING that hasn't been done before.
That is where the irony lies really. Saving Private Ryan features battle scenes which take the shooting of war films to a new level. In other ways it's a clear step backwards. The blood and guts and actual slugging it out may be a lot more realistic than all the various creaky 1960s and 1970s three-hour war epics, but once you get beyond that Saving Private Ryan ultimately rings far more hollow than many of its predecessors.",1049587200,9,1608,4.6456140350877195

1242712,1,B00000K3AM,"Speilberg deserves kudos for the stunning and moving Schindler's List, that films is his greatest masterpiece and by far out shines SPR in every criterior.
What I won't to know is am I the only one who doesn't think Ryan is the greatest movie ever made? I mean seriously compared to THE DEFINETIVE D-day movie the Longest Day, SPR is stale one-sided soap opera which would rather tell a sappy sentimental fairy tale than explore a real important historic event. Every one raves about the impact of the first 20 minutes of Ryan (which are the only part worth watching) but seriously every time the camera pulled back to a wideshot there was only a handfull of GI's which totally lacks the real sense of scale of the mass invasion, captured in Longest Day's amazing invasion scenes and while SPR is more gritty than Longest Day (only because of cencorship at 1962 the time of LD's production), hey Steven I like my movies gorey and have seen alot more extreme gore in movies.
Also the shear one-sided nature of this movie is hard to accept, I mean we see brave American's dying on the beach..........and that's it. Hey that did happen and I resept those people but this is no excuse for Speilberg to portray the landings like this when Allies of other countries died just as brutally on the same day a few miles away. Also the Germans are protrayed as these unseen cold blooded killers when in reality they were ordinary men desperately fighting what they knew would be a losing battle. I'm no Nazi but really in this day and age there is no need to protray Germans in this propaganda film way. In reality (convienently not told in SPR) the Germans got up in the morning to see literally thousands!!! of Allied ships which proceeded to bombard them, once again I hate Nazi's but the fact that they tried to hold their positions and not just turn around and run has got to be acknowledged. By diminishing the courage of the Germans this way Speilberg clearly paints them as 'bad guys' like in some campy Western.
What proceeds after these landing scences is a sentimental and simple story. There is no depth to the plot or originality to the characters of Ryan and anyone who says there is must have had their eyes closed in the last 50 years to the 100's of other war flicks which have the 'Brave Comander from ordinary background' 'Ox the strong simpleton' 'Brooklyne the wise cracking NewYorker' and the 'weasle like coward'. Really the whole ""this time the mission is a man....."" or ""why risk our lives...."" are but simple cliched points that have being explored much better in other films and are handled with complete imcompetance by Speilberg who obviously think's this he's directing ET.
For a real idea of the D-day landings watch the Longest Day, it is far superior and shows all sides in accurate detail. The only thing Ryan has going for it is the gore, if this was a horror movie critics would say it's disgusting and call for the film to be banned but when attached to a sappy flagwaving war film it becomes the 'Greatest war film ever made'. Hate to tell you but Apocalypse Now, while not realistic, is by far the greatest war film ever made and there are plenty of other films better than Ryan, Fullmetal Jacket, Tora tora tora, Platoon , and even his own Schindler's List.
I mean without the gore and Speilberg's name attached to it, SPR has about as much value as Rambo or Missing in Action. Yet maybe thats what people want, a sentimental fairytale with good guys and bad guys, not a true factual examination of war. I mean Black Hawk Down is 100% genuine and has F/X technically superior to Ryan'S but that was no where near as successfull at the box office.",1049155200,27,3675,4.569696969696969

1242714,5,B00000K3AM,"The sheer emotional power of this film makes it one of the greatest tributes ever to the soldiers who fought and often died to make our world what it is today.  Saving Private Ryan is on many levels an outstanding film--from the excellent performances of a star-level cast to the brilliant special effects to the cinematic capture of the essence of the horrors of war.
The story itself may be rather secondary to the imagistic power of the film.  The first forty-five minutes or so focus on the Allied landing and invasion of Normandy, where one cannot help but imagine and feel the forces of chaos roiling around each and every soldier.  Even the hardest viewer likely will shed a tear at the horror of combat or the bravery and valor of the soldiers called to fight.  The long combat sequence may even overwhelm some viewers but is perhaps one of the truest pictures of war that any non-veteran is likely to experience.
Saving Private Ryan should be required viewing for anyone advocating the use of military force to solve our problems, a primer in the dirtier aspects of combat most of us would rather ignore.  So should it be required of anyone who has disparaged the honor of our armed forces, for even those reluctant to fight deserve our utmost respect when called to do so, and this film offers renewed appreciation of those soldiers who have defended our freedom through time.
Overall, it is difficult to see how Saving Private Ryan did not win Best Picture--it is simply that good.",1047513600,3,1492,4.679389312977099
1242715,5,B00000K3AM,"Where can I begin? This film is terrific. The greatest war film ever created. For those who have seen it you'll know what I mean - it's ace, isn't it!
For those who haven't i'll give you some plot details:
The film is set during world war 2. It begins with the D-Day battle of Omarha beach. This is a brilliant opening scene which lasts for around half an hour. The Americans are all in boats and have to make their way up a beach which is protected by a German machine gun. The allies just get slautered. I don't want to give too much away coz it's a great scene.
Anyway a special mission ensues to save Private Ryan - I can't give anything else away coz it will spoil the film.
Just trust me, I have it on video and it is amazing - it's more than amazing. Words simply cannot describe the sheer brilliance of this masterpiece...",1047513600,4,830,4.19375
1242716,5,B00000K3AM,"What else can be said of this movie that the previous 1,000 reviews have already said?
I won't go into plot and all, I'm sure everyone knows the storyline. I'm here as a lifelong student of World War II to say that yes, there are flaws in this movie, both historical and technical, but over all, this movie is probably the greatest film of World War II combat ever made.
Some people complain about the ""Tigers"" being converted Russian T-34s (very much true) but when was the last time that SOMEONE tried to make a tank LOOK like a German tank? In ""Patton"" (a great movie too) you had American M-48s slapped with gray paint and German crosses to represent German Armor. In SPR, there are two Marders, some Schutzenpanzerwagen halftracks, accurate gear and uniforms. Name me any movies prior to SPR where there was as much authentic gear. I doubt you'll find any...
Some quibble that no Tigers met GIs this early in the Normandy campaign. This is true too. There WERE Tigers in Normandy on June 13 (the date of the SPR's fictional Battle of Ramelle) and they were tearing up a brigade of the famed British 7th Armored Division (the Desert Rats) at Villers Bocage, but again, I think some people are missing SPR's point.
Where SPR succeeds brilliantly is that it went for what I call a ""higher truth."" In this case, the truth is the hell of a modern war zone. War, no matter where or when it is fought, is a hellish place utterly foreign to the human imagination where time has its own distinctive meaning and your world goes no farther than the men in your squad or platoon.
Spielberg has managed the impossible. He actually caught the seething hell of combat. I think people will watch this film for decades and many will walk away feeling that they have seen war for the first time and will feel respect for those who have endured its fires.
SPR was gypped of the best picture Oscar. It should have won instead of ""Shakespeare in Love"" (which it was far superior to) but since actors love movies about actors, it lost. A shame. Next to ""Schindler's List,"" ""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of Spielberg's greatest achievments. Let's hope he does a film about Iwo Jima.",1047427200,2,2163,4.5487179487179485
1242717,3,B00000K3AM,"The whole premise of Saving Private Ryan is about a mother losing four sons in battle and a fifth engaged in fighting an ugly war. Not only with the enemy but with his compatriots who badger him at times. A teacher at home, but only a menial soldier on the battlefield where all are equals with the exception of officers, of course.
The mother's lonely farmplace looked desolate in beautiful countryside, perhaps Indiana. She collapses at the mere sight of the official car with the star on its door.
The worst thing for me was the soldier who died calling for his mother. We may bring them into this world to be sent off God-knows-where to defend this country. As a mother of three sons, it hurts me to see our young American males transported to foreign lands to die in such an inglorious manner. If we are to defend America, why can't we do it at home and stop this indiscriminate slaughter so far from home and mother. By watching this movie, we learn how to die with grace.

However, I witnessed in the summer of 1998 something I had never witnessed in ANY movie I have ever seen.
I had already seen Saving Private Ryan in my hometown.
My father which was on the first wave of Omaha Beach had also seen the movie and he was deeply moved.  He is still alive at 86 years old.  He was captain of the medical corps and actually picked the location where the American troops would be buried in France just off the beach as depicted in the movie.  He had nothing to do with the memorial but he did pick the location.
After seeing the movie in my hometown I went on vacation in the summer of 1998 to Colorado.  While staying with some friends in Fort Collins we went one night to see Saving Private Ryan at the local theater.  This is what happened that I have NEVER seen before after watching a movie.
When the film ended.......not.....one......single.....person....got up to leave while the credits were rolling!  NOT ONE!
The theater was packed!  It was a LARGE theater. Only when the house lights came on did people begin to quietly get up to leave.
I have never seen this in any movie I have ever seen in my life.  I have seen many people stay for credits while some leave.  But never the entire packed audience stay put in their seats.  Every SINGLE PERSON stayed in their seats.
I don't think I will ever see this occur again in ANY  movie.

This film is so effective, because it forces the audience to abdon their innocence just like those young men who fought in the Second World War did repectively. Tom Hanks gives a great acting performance, but he feels out of place in a war movie. The best performance of the movie is that of Matt Damon as Private Ryan. In this role, he plays a wide-eyed young man who is thrust into a fight for his life and for freedom. In this he symbolizes so many like him in the era. Anyway, this movie along with The Thin Red Line are the best contemporary films on the Second World War, and I would recommend either to anyone wanting to be sobered by the true, unromanticized nature of war.",1045872000,,817,4.417218543046357

Anyways, the camera work during the Omaha Beach segment gave the impression of actually being there.  Especially with the jittery motion and the bits of breathing that you hear in the background.

1242722,5,B00000K3AM,"If this doesn't convince them DVD is the state of the art, nothing will.  Get it in DTS and rent the Dolby version for the one extra supplement material that is missing on the DTS version.
The movie itself isn't bad, it was the frontrunner in the Oscars until ""Shakespeare in Love"" came late riding on a wave of favorable reviews.  Strangely, ""Ryan"" still won every other Best Picture trophy to be given that year. (Kind of reminds me how Michelle Pffeiffer won almost every Best Actress award for ""Fabulous Baker Boys"" except the Oscar.)  It is one of the most realistic depictions of combat in movie history.  Perhaps only the Band of Brothers series, which came much later (HDTV and now DVD) can rival this movie when it comes to realism.
The movie, IMO is about irony.  Forget the special effects for a while and concentrate on Edward Burns' line as he ponders the math: ""What's the use of risking the lives of eight of us for just one guy?""  The mission was FUBAR to begin with, a public relations job, as Dennis Farina says.  One bad decision, but so well executed by skilled professionals, no major foul-ups, so far, so good.  Then Tom Hanks decides to commit his entire squad against a machinegun nest he could have easily bypassed, or taken out with his sniper (who was extremely talented).  He loses his medic, of all people, a non-combatant.  He frees a surrenderee (the decent thing) and pays dearly for the kind deed.  He then impossibly allows himself to be talked by mission objective himself, Private Ryan, into making a desperate, predictably disastrous defense of a bridge against German armor.  You know the rest: when a handful of men without big guns take on a few tanks plus 50 enemy infantry, the results could only be disastrous, even if the said men were elite Rangers and 101st Airborne.
I was so emotionally spent after watching this movie, I was inspired (if it can be called that) to imagine, many days later, a different ending for this movie.  At the risk of being called a spoiler (IMO, a lot of people have seen this anyway), here it is:  They extract Ryan indeed, and most of them make it back to the American lines.  OK?  Then, as they arrive at dusk, a nervous sentry mistakenly shoots Ryan dead.  Mission failed.  See if that doesn't break your heart.  Don't laugh, something like this happened in Band of Brothers, which is based on true stories of 101st Airborne men.  (OK the man shot didn't die.)

I know too little about the politics of Hollywood to guess why this happens "" studio pressure? US vs. European film culture? Still, its miles better than the former D-Day benchmark movie, The Longest Day, and shows the sheer scope and depth of Spielbergs vision.

1242728,3,B00000K3AM,"I go back and forth on my feelings about Steven Spielberg as a director.  I gushed pretty blatantly about Artificial Intelligence, but on reflection (and several more viewings) I think I was just relieved that he didn't screw it up too badly.  Now, I find my review faintly embarrassing.  Oh well.
Saving Private Ryan has taken longer to percolate.  It's great achievement (one worthy of study by film students) is the Omaha Beach invasion on D-Day.  My God, what a terrifying sequence.  It is, perhaps, the single best sustained action scene in recent memory.  Only Kurosawa's devastating castle attack from the middle of Ran eclipses it for sheer apocalyptic horror.  It is war as abstraction; the newsreel style a metaphorical fan brush loaded with pigments of green, khaki, and red as it feverishly, even angrily paints its canvas.
Other scenes work well, also.  In spite of other reviews denouncing the ""false moral dilemma"" of the captured German soldier and Jeremy Davies' too-soft translator, I believed that most of the guys under Miller's command would, indeed, want to kill the German prisoner.  I do.  I also believed that someone would probably point out that killing him would do nothing bring back their campadre, and would, in fact, be illegal under the Geneva Convention. Scenes like this, the showdown with the sniper in the bell tower, Caparzo's death, and the long night in the church mostly work - even when the spell is broken by the occasional Oscar Speech (patent pending) from Tom Hanks.  By and large, the scenes were well handled, with thoughtful dialog and subtle acting.
But, alas, Spielberg could not overcome his ultimate weakness - sentiment verging on unadulterated corn.  The book-ending scenes are insulting in the way they ask us to believe not that General Marshall would send soldiers in harm's way to rescue Private Ryan, but that he would do it for sentimental reasons.  My complaint is not with actor Harve Presnell, who delivers his lines with great conviction, but with the very idea that a man in his position would actually value the life of a single man over the lives of many.  That equation does not wash.  Such a mission is realistic (the film is based, we are told, on fact), but the reason behind it would almost certainly be one of propaganda value.
Imagine if Spielberg's late friend Stanley Kubrick had made the film: Mrs. Ryan gets telegrams telling her that all but one of her sons are dead and the last is missing.  She explodes in anger and grief, forgetting that her sons died to save the free world and focusing instead on her own loss.  She calls the papers, she raises a stink, the AP gets hold of the story.  Now Washington takes notice and leans on General Marshall - can't we do something to shut this woman up?  And thus starts the mission.
But no, that would be entirely too realistic.  It's not that Americans NEVER send rescue teams to pull lost soldiers out of harm's way (remember Captain Scott O'Grady?); it's that the calculus for launching such an operation hinges on a great deal more than how much the powers-that-be get all dewy-eyed over the thought of sending another telegram to the parents of a soldier.
On balance, though, Saving Private Ryan is still a film worth owning.  The technical achievement is undeniable; isolated scenes are brilliant.  It's just exasperating to see Steven Spielberg sometimes lose his nerve, stop trusting the strength of the material, and go for the sharp stick to the tear-duct.",1041638400,4,3490,4.838383838383838

While this exceptional film is not based solely on the actual actions of one unit like their later masterpiece, Band of Brothers', it is clearly the most realistic World War II silver screen blockbuster to date!  This film, from the very beginning draws you into the world of these valiant soldiers as they are in the landing craft preparing for the gate to drop and hit the beach.  No film prior to this has ever more realistically and poignantly showed the true costs of war, without glorifying those costs.
The premise:
Tom Hanks plays Captain Miller, a Ranger Company Commander whose company is part of the D-Day invasion!  A major portion of his company is wiped out during the invasion on Omaha beach and a follow on action in which they had to take out a pair of German 88's.  He is then given the mission to find Private Ryan, who's three brothers who were all recently KIA (killed in action).  His company is effectively taken away from him, to be used to shore up losses in another company.  He takes seven of his best Rangers and sets off on the quest to find Private Ryan who jumped in with 101st Parachute Infantry Regiment the night before D-Day and bring him home safely.

1242733,1,B00000K3AM,"Any critical interpretation of Spielberg's heavily problematic ""Saving Private Ryan"" is bound to provoke passionate, even angry, responses; some people defend this movie as religiously as they defend other American myths. To attack the film is to commit blasphemy, supposedly tantamount to attacking America's role in World War II.  But a critical account of this overblown epic war film has nothing to do with the history of World War II.  They are separate issues, and it is possible to critique this film while still holding that America had a special role in the defining historical moment of the 20th century.
Now that this necessary caveat has been made, let the critique begin. ""Saving Private Ryan"" has all of Spielberg's trademarks, which means it has all of his drawbacks: it's emotionally simplistic and shamelessly sentimental to the point of being offensive (the prologue and the coda at the veteran cemetery are the best examples, as are the musical cues noting when you should feel sentimental); it's deeply manipulative, as are all of Spielberg's films, save a small few (like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""); it offers only a watered-down, massively unsophisticated interpretation of reality, in this case of World War II, portraying the Nazis as cartoonish villians (they were villians, to be sure, but there was nothing cartoonish about them in reality); and it is technically astute but dramatically under-whelming.  The last point here is important because much has been made of Spielberg's recreation of the Normandy invasion, seen as impressive in its realism and its scale. But despite the technical bravado and the sheer amount of work that went in to pulling the scene off, Spielberg approaches the invasion with all the subtlety and seriousness of a child.  There's little here that is dramatically compelling, and most of the opening half hour actually has no weight -- it's showy and comical and contrived just enough to be trite. As a result, it has an effect opposite to what Spielberg surely intended.
The rest of the film suffers from similar problems.  On the surface, the idea of focusing on a small band of soldiers and their efforts to rescue the last survivor of four brothers in order to understand the war as a whole (sort of a microcosm as a lesson) seems intriguing and notable, but Spielberg, in typical fashion, can't pull it off.  This novel idea, in his hands, gives us no real sense of what the war was about, what was at stake, what sacrifice really meant; under Spielberg's direction, World War II becomes indistinguishable from any other war, nothing more than a bunch of soldiers who want to finish their mission so they can go home, nothing more than a reductive tale that includes some vague notions of good, evil, heroism, and fear.  The story meanders without force, to the point where it's difficult to care what happens, which might not seem like much of a criticism until we realize that caring is the one thing Spielberg wants us to do.  And if that weren't enough, the film's final sequences entail a climatic battle against Germans that has all the originality, thoughtfulness, and profundity of a typical Hollywood action climax.  Sure, the bullets whiz, blood spurts, soldiers fight for their lives, and then the audience cheers loudly when something ""good"" seems to happen, as if cheering at war is the thing we should really be doing.
""Saving Private Ryan"" is, at best, a severely flawed and problematic film.  Even the cinematography, which has been praised too often, is wrong; the flat hues and dark colors don't fit, and Spielberg, as well versed as he is in the art of movie-making, could still learn a great deal about handheld camera work from a number of directors and cinematographers, including Truffaut and Kalatozishvili.  He's a technician, to be sure, but that does not mean that he makes the right decisions.
Finally, the DVD as far as quality goes is impressive, but in some sense this film would be better served if it were played endlessly in a hall at Disneyland instead of home theaters; because ""Saving Private Ryan"" approaches its subject as a child would, and therefore would be perfect in a place devoted to children.",1040860800,28,4201,4.936260623229462
1242734,3,B00000K3AM,"Technically, this is a very good film. Everyone knows about the stunning spectacle that is the initial half an hour. For this piece of action i would be tempted to award full marks. However, the rest of the film soon kicks in. There are so many worthy subjects upon which to base a film about war-the effects on an individual, a better handled pearl harbor-esqe love affair etc ect- so why come up with the ridiculous premise of sending a company of troops in search of one individual just so nice, ol' mama Ryan feels okay. A noble gesture, but they're fighting a war for Petes sake.
My second concern, as a foreigner is twofold. Firstly i am slightly concerned about the nature of the US public and the Hollywood propaganda machine. Spielberg and his ill trained cronies are modern day Goebbels. Does every historical film require a resplendencent picture of the stars and stripes accompanied by some form of emotive music, in order to win the popularity of the audience. Call me a cynic, but these films do nothing more than instruct the viewer that because there is a glorious flag waving in the breeze, not liking this film is an unpatriotic act. Maybe this is all very comforting for the American pshyce, but this very worrying and concerning for the rest of us.
This brings me onto my second grievance of films such as SPR. Does the Hollywood machine go out of its way to offend foreigners. Here for example no acknowledgement of any other allied country except a derivative remark about Montgomery. Ditto Pearl Harbor. Even worse with U571. Blatant racist and unjustified depiction of Brits in Braveheart, The Patriot and here of the Germans. Take the evel skin head who is released and comes back to haunt Hanks. All this at a time when surely America needs all the allies it can get. I tell you I am a very worried bunny at the moment.

1242735,5,B00000K3AM,"I had seen all kinds of war films before sitting down in the theatre to view this film.  But I have to say that I  could barely sit through the first 30 minutes, it was so intense. Knowing that it happened like that, and even worse, was almost too much. I nearly walked out.  Nearly.  A rare experience for me a the movies.  My problem wasn't that I thought the gore was overwhelming, churning my stomach.  It was that I was nearly weeping, sitting there knowing that people actually went through that.  I can think of no other film that has had that effect one me.  It made me appreciate the effort of our fathers and grandfathers much more.  Isn't that the intent of the film?
In short, it's the story of a captian, played by Tom Hanks, who leads his squad in the D-Day assault at Omaha Beach.  They then get an assignment to find a Private Ryan (Matt Damon), a paratrooper dropped somewhere inland during the invasion.  They have to bring him back and send him home alive, because he's the last of the Ryan brothers alive out of the four sent out to war.
The acting is good.  There's enough dialog to get through the story, but it's the story and journey that count here.  Would they have sent six or seven men out, wandering around the French countryside until they found one man?  That's debatable, but don't let the question spoil the story.  This is about following orders, compassion, duty to country, family, and comrade.
The technical details are top-notch.  Bullets and explosions act like the real things.  The settings are incredibly realistic with bombed-out buildings and the rubble of war.  And the sounds couldn't be better.  High quality filmmaking throughout.
This gets five stars and a buy recommendation because it's one of the best war movies ever, and one of the best-made movies ever.  I own the DTS version, without all of the extras, so I can't comment on them.",1040169600,3,1887,4.576119402985075
1242736,5,B00000K3AM,"When Saving Private Ryan first hit the theaters, a big splash was made over the amount of graphic violence the film contained.  As a matter of fact, such hype over the movie's gruesome nature overshadowed most other aspects of the film, and since then, there's been a small critical backlash of sorts against the movie, many claiming it's just another example of Hollywood junk.
But after so many years, my appreciation for Saving Private Ryan has only further solidified, and in spite of three terrific war films released the past year (Black Hawk Down, We Were Soldiers, and Band of Brothers), none of them have been able to surpass SPR on the pure basis of emotional resonance.  For that, if nothing else (and you'd best not forget how shatteringly realistic the battle scenes are), this is the greatest war film ever made.
The film's opening D-day sequence is easily the most highly praised segment of SPR (or any film released that same year, for that matter), and it's no wonder.  The invasion is a twenty-minute display of confusion, bloody death, and the overall terrifying realism of combat.  Prior to this, I'd never seen combat presented in such a graphic, ""you are there"" nature that dwarfs even the stellar work Oliver Stone accomplished twelve years earlier in Platoon.
After this gutsy opening sequence, we settle down to the main story.  After it's discovered three brothers have been killed, a mission is quickly formed to find and retrieve the last brother, James F. Ryan, so that he can be sent home in one piece.  Eight men, led by Captain John Miller (played by Tom Hanks), are sent for this task, with some of them questioning the logic and ambiguity behind such a mission.  The majority of the film is spent developing each of these characters, both in their interaction to each other and how war has changed the men they once were.
Director Steven Spielberg did a fantastic job crafting the film as both an anti-war piece and as one that honors the men who fought and died in battle, and it seems this portrayal of heroism has often been reviewers' most listed complaint, as they seem to believe doing so makes the film into an attempt to glorify warfare.  But the fact is, these ordinary men were heroes, and prior to SPR, I'd never seen a movie that truly acknowledged their courage in the midst of unbearable chaos.  This same theme is also the driving force behind the almost as effective Band of Brothers, so it's no surprise Steven Spielberg was heavily involved in that miniseries.
Camraderie on the front lines has been done to death, but its presentation in Saving Private Ryan is worth noting, and these are really the scenes that entice me to another viewing (since watching the battle scenes again would be too disturbing).  Every actor here delivers exemplary performances; this is the most terrific ensemble I've ever seen compiled in one film.  As the lead, Tom Hanks turns in one of his best performances, a dramatic tour-de-force that works simply because he so convincing plays a normal man driven to the extremes by war.  This is probably Hanks most subtle and moving role to date.  It certainly helps he has a well-written script (courtesy of Robert Rodat) to back him up.
Everyone else also make good impressions, with Tom Sizemore as Hanks' loyal sergeant, Barry Pepper as the religious sharpshooter, Adam Goldberg and Ed Burns as somewhat sarcastic naysayers, Jeremy Davies as the frightened corporal, and Giovanni Ribisi as the thoughtful, introspective medic.  It's because of the characterization that I find the film's climactic battle sequence to be even more intense and moving than the opening segment.  Just watch and see if just the mere sound of thundering, approaching tanks doesn't get your heart racing in fear.
On a technical level, only the pickiest of nitpickers would find flaws.  The production is amazing, consisting of war-torn towns and muddy forests.  The cinematography and editing is among the best I've ever seen, and John Williams' score is a powerful, sorrowful elegy of quiet, rumbling emotions.  Arguably, this is Steven Spielberg's best film, and whether or not he goes on to surpass it remains to be seen.  But hey, five years prior to viewing Saving Private Ryan, I remember telling myself, ""there's no way he'll ever make another film as powerful as Schindler's List.""",1038009600,2,4348,4.883152173913044
1242737,4,B00000K3AM,"This is a very good movie.  It is essentially the story of one group of soldiers, American Rangers, from the assault on Normandie beach through the early fighting thereafter in France.
It opens with the best combat scene ever filmed for a movie.  This is no exaggeration.  The initial combat scene is incredibly realistic, moving, and bloody.  It unbelievably authentic.
The acting is very good.  How can you not like Tom Hanks as the Ranger Captain?  He's great.  The supporting cast turns in fine performances as well.  Some stereotypes, but hey, they are well-acted stereotypes.
The movie does have a plot, which is more than can be said for many war movies--this one is to locate and return to the States a young man whose two brothers were recently killed in combat.
The story line could be more brisk.  It drags in places.  The movie is probably about 20 minutes too long in my estimation.  Hollywood has been going through a ""phase"" where it makes movies too long.  I think Dances With Wolves started this trend.  This movie continues it, although not as severely as ""Dances.""
Technical: the video is great (DVD) and the sound is simply the best of any DVD I own (hundreds).  Very high quality.
This is a fine movie, worth owning and watching.  While it is not the best war movie ever made, it is a very good one.",1036627200,,1320,4.605150214592275
1242738,5,B00000K3AM,"Being young and full of ambition, I thought Steven Spielberg at the time was the world's best director and was flawless with his directing skills (Of course, I hadn't seen his dumb parody, ""1941"").  But when I saw ""Saving Private Ryan"", I was spellbound.  It was probably the most realistic and emotional war film I've ever seen since his work with ""Schiendler's List"".  I knew, from that point, that this was gonna be the best war film to date.
In the opening shot, a man is visiting a gravesite in Normandy, France, Present Day, with his family behind him.  Suddenly, while walking in the middle of the row of tombs, he stumbles onto his knees and starts crying.  This causes somewhat confusion to the audience; however, people relize the pain the man is feeling when they see the many graves of young souls, lost in a war that they didn't start.  The film then jumps to June 6, 1944 (D-Day) at Omaha Beach, Normandy, France.  A small group of American soldiers, very young and scared, ride in the ajacent Higgins Boat across the French channel. 2 of the soldiers even vommits in fear.  Then the boat reaches land, by this time you can already hear gunfire and explosions.  As soon as the Higgins Boat ramp drops in front, all hell breaks loose.  Immediately, 3 or 4 soldiers are massively hit with German bullets, leaving the rest in total chaos.  The storming scene, which lasts about 30 minutes or so, is probably the mosy gruesome portray of the horror of war.  After the invasion is over, the remainding soldiers rendezvous.  One of the invasion's heroes was Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks, in one of his most acheiving roles since ""Forrest Gump""), a jaded and calm tempered school teacher, merely witness his soldiers dying.  Meanwhile, after the storming of the beach, government officials get word that 3-out-of-4 brothers from Iowa have been killed in 3 separate battles.  The remainding brother, Private James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), is a paratrooper missing somewhere in Normandy.  The plan is to get James out of there and get him back home to his grief-stricken mother.  Thus, Miller and Sgt. Horvath (Tom Sizemore)are recruited to go into the French country-side and locate Ryan before he gets killed.  Miller leads a rag-tag platoon along with, which include the hotheaded Private Richard Reiben (Edward Burns), the deadly yet religious sharpshooter Private Daniel Jackson (Barry Pepper), the stereotypical Jewish Private Stan Mellish (Adam Goldberg), the jaded medic Private Irwin Wade (Giovanni Ribisi), the oversized Italian-American Private Adrian Caparzo (Vin Diesel) and probably the most memorable character, the under trained, yet sweet Cororal Timothy Upham (Jeremy Davis) as the company's translator.  However, what started as a harmless search-and-rescue mission, turns into a tedious odyssey which anywhere from German snipers to German 88 cannon squads, starts picking off the men, one-by-one, to a point where the soldiers are ready to throw down their guns and ask ""why???"".  That of course is answered in Hanks' brilliant speech halfway in the film.
SPR is definately historical in it's own way.  I was astounded and shocked at the D-Day beach storming sequence of the film.  I tired to picture myself in that kind of situation; forced to fight, scared to death, not a chance of survival insight.  Probably the most heart-wrenching sequence in when a soldier is lying on the beach with his intestants spilling out, screaming ""Mommy! MOMMY!""  Spielberg showed us the true horror of war and why we should avoid it at all costs (Except, I don't really aprove of his ""Pro-War"" statements he's been saying in the press about our situation with Iraq).  This film should be shown in classrooms for historical studies.  It's sheer brilliance",1035849600,,3769,5.0

1242740,4,B00000K3AM,"This is a fine WWII movie that shows the bravery of American soldiers in the face of so much horror, chaos, and hardship of war. World War II was hell, but it was a necessary hell in which decent people were forced to give up some part of their humanity in order to stop an enemy that was really determined to wipe out the free world. This film is about showing respect to those who risk their lives in order to make this a better and more peaceful world.
The middle part of the movie is a little bit weak and overlong; I do believe the director and screenwriters could have done a better job with that part of the movie.
The movie does show how unpredictable, chaotic, and dangerous warfare is, and how the GREATEST award for any soldier is trying to survive all of that. For those people who criticize that this movie is not always 100% accurate, please keep in mind this is a fictional WWII movie; it is NOT suppose to be a documentary about D-DAY or how soldiers fight in a war.
P.S.
For those who still doubt the plausibility of some of the movie's events, you may want to look at Stephen Ambrose's books BAND OF BROTHERS (US 101st Airborne Unit), D-DAY JUNE 6, 1944 (interviews with American, British, Canadian, French, and German veterans of D-DAY) and his other books. Some of the movie's events were taken from these books.
And for those who believe the movie's ending is implausible, you can read the book  STEEL INFERNO (written by Michael Reynolds, a retired British officer who is an expert on German panzer tactics) on pages 130-131, Chapter 11, it tells about an incident that took place at Villers-Bocage, France (6/13/1944) that is ALMOST similar to what see in the movie ending.",1033171200,2,1696,4.52442996742671

1242743,5,B00000K3AM,"This is a superb movie, one with a horrifying depiction of the terrifying action on the beaches and in the fields of Normandy during those first few fateful days in June of 1944.  It was then that by force of arms the Allies attempted to wrest back nothing less than the whole of the European continent. Stephen Spielberg hooks you into the story by using a contemporary scene of the massive burial grounds where thousands of Allied casualties are buried to introduce a main character, who then remembers, in a flashback so vividly monumental in its scope that it will certainly leave you breathless and gasping for air.
Everything about this movie has classic written all over it, from Tom Hanks moving portrayal of a man who must lead his platoon deep into the battlefield in search of a single soldier in order to rescue him and bring him back to the shore for evacuation; all of his three brothers have been killed in action on D-Day, and General George Marshall has ordered that he be saved in order to prevent the family from losing all of its sons to the war. The cinematography is exceptional, and the scenes depicting the landing on Omaha Beach on D-Day are so graphic and done so masterfully that one reels in attempting to describe them. They must be experienced to be fully appreciated, and then hopefully on large screen TV system with an excellent sound system.
The supporting cast is terrific, from Tom Sizemore to Edward burns to Jeremy Davies to Vin Diesel to Harrison Young, who plays the fifty-something Ryan breaking down at the grave site in the opening scene of the movie. Of course, Matt Damon turns in a wonderful performance as the young Ranger who finds himself conflicted by the set of existential circumstances him finds himself in, all of his brothers killed, and ordered to now desert is own squad under fire to save himself. But excellent performances are nothing unusual for this very gifted young actor. The entire cast supports the emotional telling of this tale.
This is the second of Spielberg's movies about World War Two, the first being ""Schindler's List"".  This shows a growing sense of seriousness and a new gravity to his work, which is both popular and now more substantive. I was most impressed with the incredible care taken by the production company to faithfully recreate all of the elements of the story authentically and in context, from the green and brown packs of ""Luckies"" to the pandemic cussing and cursing that real-life soldiers used to communicate. While his does soft-soap the meaning of SNAFU, he otherwise gives the closets thing to the actual experience one might hope to vicariously witness to approximate the situation on the ground on D-Day.

Tom Hanks and Tom Sizemore put in their usual top level performance and the remainder of the cast is rock solid as well.  The mission given to Tom Hanks and his men is a bit unusual but adds to the sense of tragedy of the crusade in Europe.  The true gem of this movie; however, is the special effects.  The opening sequence on Omaha Beach sets the pace.  I saw this originally in the theater and when the landing craft ramp drops and the German machine guns open up, I actually ducked.  This level of realism continues throughout the movie culminating with a close combat battle between GI's and authentic German Armor.

The almost 'real-life' scenes of suffering and terror coupled with hope are heart-rending.
Many of the actual combatants of the D-day landings which this film is based around, verify the 'close to reality' nature of some of the scenes.

Afterwards, the movie devolves into nothing more than another episode of Combat (the TV series). The plot is supposedly based on an actual incident, but it is hardly believable as shown in this movie. Despite all their attention to detail, I found this part of the movie to be just too hokey and unbelievable.  For example, these supposedly elite Rangers stroll through  open unsecured areas, bunched up and loudly carrying on pointless conversation. Such tactics work only in Hollywood and are not what combat veteran Rangers would have done.  Such antics continue through the rest of the movie as the Rangers and others soldiers perform one suicidal or stupid act after another. It's no wonder all but one of the stars don't make it.

The Winner of five Acamedy Awards incuding Best Director, the film also captured the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Film Editing, Sound, and Sound Effects Editing. It was robbed of the Best Picture Oscar in the single biggest act of ignorance from the Acamedy in history. More than 70 critics (including those at Time Magazine, USA Today, The New York Times, and Etertainment Weekly) and critics' groups in New York, Chicago, Dallas-Ft. Worth, and Great Britain named the film Best Picture of the Year, while Los Angeles, Toronto, and Boradcast Film Critics honored it with both Best Picture and Best Director Awards. In addition, Speilberg recieved his third Directors Guild of America Award, the American Legion ""The Spirit of Normandy"" Award, which is a USO Merit Award. It is the highest award a civilian can recieve from the Dept. of the Army. Selected for more than 160 top ten lists, Saving Private Ryan's other awards include Best Picture from the Golden Globes, and the top-grossing movie of 1998.
If you have not seen this movie yet, expect to see through the eys of a squad of American soldiers, the story begins with World War II's most infamous battle, the historic D-Day invasion, then moves beyond the beach as the men embark on a dangerous special mission. Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) must take his men behind enemy lines to find Private James Ryan, whose three brothers have been killed in combat. Faced with impossible odds, the men question their orders all throughout the film. Why are eight men risking their lives to save just one man? Surrounded by the brutal reality of war, each man seaches for his own answer-and the strength to triumph over an uncertain future with honor and courage.
My answer is that Saving Private Ryan is the best war film ever. It is very moving, to the point that WWII veterns broke out into tears in the theaters. If you are an American, and can sit through this film without feeling a sense of pride for what those boys did sixty years ago, there's something wrong. Any time you can walk away from a movie with feelings of pride, depression, hapiness, and fear all at the same time you have an outstanding movie.

1242758,5,B00000K3AM,"This is the best war film (or ties with Black Hawk Down) that I've seen. We start with Tom Hanks as Captain John Miller, Tom Sizemore as Sgt. Horvath. Throw in Barry Pepper as my favorite character, the hothead, religious sniper, Vin Disel as Private Caparzo, and Jermy Davis as the corpral, as they storm Dog Green sector of Omaha beach. The ramp of the PA boat drops and soldiers run out, only to be stopped by MG42 bullets, mortars blow men to bits, 20mm flaks cut the troops to peices, but, Captain Miller and his men actually survive perhaps the most realistic battle scene. . .EVER.
But it's not over yet, Miller and seven other men get assigned a mission to find Private James Ryan, a paratrooper with the 101st
who lost three brothers on D-day, he has a ticket home.
This is a great, probably the best war movie ever, the Omaha beach we saw wasn't real, but it looked that way. As Miller and the others find Ryan, losing two men, Caparzo and the medic, Wade. Ryan and his brothers in arms are defending a bridge, and the Nazis storm on them with infantry and tanks, and only two or three people from Miller's squad (along with Ryan) survive.
I have to say, I'm not a fan of Speilberg, (I liked Minority Report), but this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Rent or buy. . . NOW!",1026518400,3,1292,4.320987654320987
1242759,4,B00000K3AM,"Saving Private Ryan is a very well made movie, but is somewhat 'hollywoodized'. Spielburg is not one to make beauiful movies, but he puts quite a bit of depth into Saving Private Ryan. I would not call it the best war movie of all time, if you think it is please see The Thin Red Line, but it is definatly one of the the best. I won't forget to mention it is one of the more graphic war movies. I've been known to have a 'different' taste in movies but I think everyone can agree that this is a very well made movie that deserves credit.

Stephen speilberg showed what war really lookes like in Saving Private Ryan. The movie itself had an excellent plot, which was finding private Ryan, (Matt Damon) telling him he was the only brother alive out of the other three. Tom Hanks also did a magnificent job in playng the captain. All these actors played very great roles. the acting was also very well done. I don't think any war movie comes close or compares to this. Stephen Speilberg showed all the peopele what WWII really looked like.",1026172800,2,633,4.87037037037037
1242761,4,B00000K3AM,"To start off my review, I would like to answer those who complain about this film ignoring the British and not having African Americans or other minorities in the army units.
Yes, the British did have a major part in World War II and there were many British and Canadians, as well as Americans, present at the Normandy landings. But a few reviewers have already mentioned that Omaha was invaded by the Americans. And, as someone mentioned before, Brits weren't exactly commonplace in an American Rangers Unit. As for the minorities, American units were still very much segregated in World War II.
But, I do agree with other reviewers who mention the slanted portrayal of Germans in this movie. Some have blamed this on Director Spielberg's Judaism. While I can't agree with that, I will say this: The German troops in here reminded me of drones. They were cold hearted and brutal. None of them thought of killing without hesitation and, above all, they weren't human. They were also easier to eliminate then the Americans (With the exception of the opening scenes), despite the fact that they were probably elite German troops (They seemed older, bigger and tougher then many of the Americans). However, hasn't this been seen in war movies for decades, dating back to John Wayne WWII movies or films like ""The Guns of Navarone"" and ""The Dirty Dozen""? It's pretty ridiculous to downgrade an AMERICAN war movie because the soldiers on the other side are easier to kill then AMERICANS. Basically, historical movies, especially those made by the United States, aren't the best history teacher.
The greatest question posed at the end of ""Saving Private Ryan"" is was it worth it. Was it worth risking the lives of eight men just to save one, basically unimportant man just because his brothers were all dead? Contrary to some reviewers, I think the movie was showing that it wasn't worth it. Most of the men in the squad sent to save Ryan were killed and the survivors would have been slaughtered had it not been for allied reinforcements. Even Tom Hank's John Miller seems skeptical as to whether it was justified: His last words to Ryan are ""Earn this. Earn it"".
My only other compliant with the movie was in who survived on the American side. I'm not complaining about Ryan, but about the other men in the squad sent to rescue him, of whom just two survive. One is a cocky private (Edward Burns) who can't keep his mouth shut. There is a tense scene where he tries to leave the squad and gets into a shouting match with another sergeant, played by Tom Sizemore. Sizemore pulls his gun out and threatens to shoot him. I was hoping that he would put the bullet in his big mouth. The other survivor is a very well educated corporal who's bilingual in German and French, which is why he was brought along. Yet he isn't a good solider because he's easily shaken by battle. Granted, not everyone can be a tough guy underfire (He isn't really a soldier either. He was a mapmaker and translator beforehand). Still, had he showed more bravery and courage in the battle in the French town (He had a thirty caliber with a full belt, for pete's sake), at least two others in his squad would have either been saved or would have had an advantage against the Germans. He was also very much within firing range of the Germans through most of the last battle. Not until the battle's end does he finally have the guts to shoot someone. His character's action seemed based on those of Lt. Joyce from ""Bridge on the River Kwai"".
I also somewhat agree with those who question the military tactics. A squad of American soldiers is in dangerous, heavily occupied nazi country, yet is bunched up closely together talking loudly. Ridiculous, no doubt. But again, this is Hollywood. It's better film wise to have the actors placed this way. And during these walks, we learn more about the men and about their opinions on the mission and the war.
That said, this is an excellent, powerful war movie. The battle scenes are stunning and, while ultra violent and perhaps made for action movie buffs, they make one hope that we or the ones we love are never have to be in those situations. However, while this movie depicts the D-Day assault more brutally than any other, the early war epic ""The Longest Day"" shows a wider overall coverage, though with less bloodshed (Since censors wouldn't have allowed it at the time). Rent both tonight.",1026086400,3,4407,4.680412371134021
1242762,5,B00000K3AM,"Tom Hanks turns in perhaps his best performance as the simple yet brave and caring Captain Miller in this World War II epic.  Hanks should have won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal as Miller.  The film begins with Miller and his squad as they are approaching Omaha Beach on D-Day.  The first 20 or so minutes of this film should go down in movie history as perhaps the most realistic re-creation of an actual event.  Although extremely graphic, Spielberg, who did win an Oscar for Best Director, does an unbelieveable job of re-creating the events of the landing, right down to Hanks' uncontrollable shaking hands.  The main plot of the movie is for Hanks and his squad to find Private James Ryan, whose 3 brothers were killed in combat.  The squad sets off on its strange mission and encounters some major obstacles along the way.  A pillbox manages to keep the squad pinned down, but it is finally silenced.  However, one of the German soldiers survives.  The squad members want to shoot him, but instead Miller blindfolds him and tells him to count to 1000 and walk away.  The other squad members are infuriated that Miller would let the man go, but he quiets the uprising by telling his life story before the war, explaining that he was a teacher back home and that he had no real desire to fight and he just longs to be back home with his wife lying in his hammock.  Finally, the group finds Ryan and delivers the terrible news, but Ryan has no intention of leaving his fellow soldiers.  In the ensuing battle that follows, Miller is mortally wounded, but before he dies, he utters the most moving line of the movie to Ryan: ""Earn This"".  The movie then switches back to the present day and shows an elder Ryan kneeling over Miller's grave at Normandy paying his respects to the man that saved his life.  All history or World War II enthusiasts should view this excellent movie, as it rates with such classics as ""Patton"" and ""The Longest Day"".",1025654400,,1967,4.566951566951567
1242763,5,B00000K3AM,"Words of praise for ""Private Ryan"" have been written. I agree with (just about) all of them. Just one note of caution: There are two very powerful, graphic acts in this film: the D-Day landing that occurs about ten minutes into the opening and the defense of the bridge that basically concludes the film. Some of this is very graphic in its realism. And this is not a documentary nor even a portrayal of a historic rescue. But let me add how parts of this excellent work can be used in a (college, business school) classroom.
Leadership: Miller's (Hanks) initiative and direction at the D-Day landing shows the the use and importance of flexible, determined action to reach the goal.
Much later, a second example, when Miller describes his approach to rationalizing or explaining how he can tolerate the death of the men serving under him. He can because he must and he sees each death as the price of winning the war war. A good class discussion could ensue.
Creativity: When Miller illustrates the use of the ""sticky bomb"" and deploys his small force, we get a lesson in creative use of available resources in a tough situation.
Mission: As the small team walks through the fields of Normandy, Miller leads his men through an impromptu session on grousing and mission. What IS their mission? Who decides?
Inspiration: When General Marshall gets the news of the Ryan brother deaths, he reads Abraham Lincoln's letter to the mother who suffered from a similar fate. Marshall reads it to his staff as a method to motivate and inspire them to ""save Private Ryan"" and he is so moved by the letter, he sets it aside and recites the closing paragraph from memory.
I am always moved by Miller's dying words: ""Earn this!"" When years later Ryan, at Miller's grave in Normandy, asks his wife if he has lived a good life, she understandably can't understand. Watch this film and perhaps you can  learn a few lessons and, hopefully, understand.",1025395200,,1933,4.718934911242603
1242764,5,B00000K3AM,"From Director Steven Spielberg (Schindlers List; Band of Brothers) comes the most talked about film of 1998 Saving Private Ryan! With A Star Studded Cast, This Film Delievers, In More Ways Than One! In the last great invasion of the last great war, the greatest danger for eight men...was saving one. Internationally acclaimed by critics and audiences alike; Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan is an unforgettable film achievement that has profound and lasting impact around the world. Winner of 5 Academy Awards including Best Director (Steven Spielberg), Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Sound and Best Sound Effects Editing. More than 70 critics (including The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, Time, Roger Ebert and Entertainment Weekly) and critics' groups in New York, Chicago, FT Worth-Texas and Great Britain named it Best Film of the Year, with the Los Angeles, Toronto and Broadcasting Film Critics honored it with Best Picture and Best Director. In Addition, Steven Spielberg recieved the third Directors Guild of America Award, the American Legion ""The Spirit of Normandy"" Award, a USO Merit Award from the USO of Metropolitan Washington, as well as the highest civilian public service award from the Department of the Army.  Selected for more than 160 Top Ten List's, Saving Private Ryan's other honors include Golden Globes for Best Picture (Drama) and Best Director, the Producers Guild of America Award and ten nominations from the British Academy Film Awards. Saving Private Ryan was also the highest grossing picture of 1998. Seen through the eyes of a squad of American soldiers, this story begins with WWII's historic D-Day invasion, then moves beyond the beaches as the men embark on a dangerous mission. Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) must take his squad made up of a battle hardened Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore),  relegious sniper (Barry Pepper), a Jewish soldier (Adam Goldber), a cocky Yankee (Edward Burns), a big hearted medic (Giovanni Ribisi) and a ""rookie"" to battle (Jeremy Davies), to find a Private James Ryan who lost his other three brothers in combat. Faced with the impossible each man starts to question orders. Whats the sense in risking eight men just to save one? Surrounded by the brutalities of war, each man must search for his own answer and the strength to triumph over an uncertain future with honor, deceny and courage. One thing that did bug me when I was watching the Academy Awards of 1998 was the fact that this was beat out by American Beauty (also won Best Actor Kevin Spacey, which was a fluke). American Beauty was an absolute delight of a film, but it didn't measure up to the emotional power of Saving Private Ryan.

I minored in history in college, so I'd heard and read about what a hellish experience World War II was.  Saving Private Ryan was the first film to capture this war in all its ferocity.
It also brings to light an obscure fact about war: that extraction missions do take place when there is only one son left alive.  This is in fact a historically documented fact that I'd never known about.

Another great thing is that this story is seen throug the eyes of its leader(Tom Hanks, who plays Captain John Miller) and sometimes the men he leads.
Overall acting: 5 stars: Tom Hanks does an excellent, but quiet job in portraying his role as Captain John Miller. Matt Damon, as Private James Ryan is just as convincing. Also, Jeremy Daives does an great job on expessing his characters emotions and thoughts.

To regard this film as entertainment seems immoral, yes its action packed, yes the special effects are fantastic, the story fluid and the acting absolutely 1st class, but the most simple scene had me in tears of the old Private Ryan standing monolithic at the war cemetery of fallen heroes who sacrificed their lives for him, the only nice aspect of human nature in the film, otherwise depicting war as the devil it is, blood drenched, claustrophobic, and decadent.
Its so nice to see other reviewers write such poetic editorials of this film, Spielberg certainly deserves the praise.

The only reason Monty took his time moving on Caen was because the British and Canadians had to take on the Elite of the German army, including SS Panzer divisions.

1242776,5,B00000K3AM,"Shortly after the D-Day invasion of Normandy, a group of soldiers are sent on a propaganda mission to retrieve a man whose bothers have all been killed in the war.  They struggle with the morality of risking the lives of their whole unit to save just one man, but they carry out their duty.  There are some amazing action sequences in this film, most notably its famous Omaha Beach battle scene.  However, it is also a deceptively complex film.  The carnage of the battlefield is juxtaposed with the quiet offices of Washington DC, where decisions are made that lead to still more carnage.  In one scene, the men, only a few days removed from the horror of Omaha, catch themselves behaving in an extremely insensitive manner while digging through the dogtags of dead soldiers while the survivors look on, making the point that personal experience of battle does not necessarily result in a heightened sense of empathy for one's fellow soldiers.  This, in turn, adds another dimension to the scenes of the decision-makers, battle veterans themselves, who are willing to risk lives on the basis of sentiment.  Yet, at the same time, who could fail to appreciate their heart-felt desire to rescue Mrs. Ryan's last son and return him to his mother?
The character of Upham (Jeremy Davies) is particularly fascinating.  Many viewers will probably dismiss him as a coward and that is unfortunate.  I'm sure that there have been innumerable times that men have frozen during battle when decisive action was required of them, costing lives as a result.  These men were not necessarily cowards, but merely unprepared for and overwhelmed by the magnitude of what they faced.  Director Steven Spielberg and writer Robert Rodat have presented a character that can be identified with rather than the cartoonish craven chicken-heart that many lesser films have settled for.

As for the plot, it goes through all the ups and downs of a war, people getting torn apart between values and priorities, finally succumbing to the impossibility of it all and doing things that border on the fantastic. It's very riveting, you will be too busy being angry and sad with the people in the movie to nitpick about some inconsistencies.

1242778,5,B00000K3AM,"Saving Private Ryan has been hailed as the greatest war movie ever made. I personally still favor several others, including The Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia, Spartacus, and, perhaps a bit perversely, Dr. Strangelove. Still, Saving Private Ryan is a riveting, monumental movie, and it is the greatest film about the American experience in World War II. I don't think any other picture has ever so graphically and so unflinchingly shown what a terrible toll war - any war - exacts on armed forces. This is not a movie for children.
Director Steven Spielburg seems to be our reigning movie making expert on W.W.II. In the early 1980s, he made the dreadful 1941, which was about German submarines prowling the West Coast. A few years later, he redeemed himself with the remarkable Empire of the Sun, which dealt with the Japanese occupation of China. In 1993, he gave us Schindler's List. This story of the plight of Jews in a concentration camp in Nazi Germany may be the most honored film ever made.
It is no wonder, then, that Saving Private Ryan was made with every attempt at authenticity. I must warn you that this attention to detail includes some of the most violent and gruesome scenes ever put on film. Usually, I make a small attempt to protest excessive violence in movies, and I could argue here that Spielburg could have made his point with less of it here. Or that he has made the ultimate arguement for gun control. I think in this case, however, that, if we are to continue to have wars, then at least the atrocities that are a natural part of them have, for once, been portrayed with complete honesty.
The movie begins on June 6, 1941 with the Normandy Invasion. This very long scene is one of the largest and most ambitious ever filmed. We watch as Captain John Miller [Tom Hanks] and his platoon, along with thousands of other soldiers, leave their landing boats and attempt to storm the beach. On the cliffs above are the well fortified German bunkers. Machine gun bullets come whizzing down like a rain from Hell. I won't go into gruesome detail, but one tends to watch this sequence in a sort of frozen horror. It is so lifelike that I have seen audience members flinch and act as though they needed to duck for cover.
Back in Washington, a military office discovers that three brothers from Iowa have been killed on the same day in three different fronts. A fourth brother, Private James Francis Ryan [Matt Damon], a member of the 101st Airborne, is missing in action somewhere in France. It is decided that he must be found and brought home to his mother. The movie thankfully implies that this decision is a heartfelt one on the part of the military. Captain Miller's platoon is given the difficult task of finding Private Ryan.
I will give you just a bit of history. The Normandy Invasion, while well thought out and most likely necessary, came at a very high price. And it was just the beginning, for the rest of France had to be reclaimed mile after dangerous mile. So, when Miller's platoon sets off to locate Private Ryan, they know they are going into a hornet's nest of German troops. To say this would have been a dangerous assignment is an understatement.
The small group of soldiers is none too pleased at the thought of going into such territory to look for one man who may well be dead. Captain Miller, in the tradition of the best leaders, keeps his own opinion of the assignment to himself. He manages to keep his men on track, no matter what their personal feelings are. The search is filled with dreadful encounters, anger, frustration, and all the madness which is part of war's nature.
Tom Hanks is such a fine actor with such an enormous range that it's rather difficult to say which one of his many performances is the finest. His Captain John Miller is decidedly near the top of the list. One of the finest elements of this movie is how it reminds us that real heroes are never super human. They are ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. Hank's Miller is close to being an Every Man. Before the war, he was a school teacher in Pennsylvania, which is so typical of the men and women who made up the troops in W.W.II. In fact, there is nothing special about any of his man. Private Ryan, in fact, is just a kid from rural Iowa. By emphasizing their ordinariness, Spielburg reminds us that we are all special.
Saving Private Ryan's point of view is more or less objective. By not playing too much on easy emotions, it manages to be patriotic, especially in homage to all veterans of W.W.II, without ever glorifying warfare.",1016841600,,4589,4.604395604395604

The rest of the movie is mostly a mishmash of contrived dialogue, forced acting, and cornball speeches.  I find its depiction of war quite inaccurate, with its apparent message that war ennobles its participants and brings out the best in soldiers (and includes lots of moving oratory by guys like Tom Hanks).  Quite simply, that isn't true.  I found ""Platoon"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"" to be much more accurate portrayals of the psychological impact of war.

Not only did Memorial Day have a new outlook on my life, but the entire military gained a lot more respect from me.  People just do not realize what life was like back in WW2.  Steven Spielberg brought this to our attention.  The first half hour of this movie is the most intense filming you will ever see on the big screen.  It was just amazing.  I remember sitting in the theatre watching it and seeing grown men shedding tears from their eyes.  And when the movie was over there was just a feeling in the theatre like I have never experienced before.  To this day, I hold a grudge against the academy for not making this the best picture 1999.

If you want to see a more humanistic film that portrays war as a terrible thing, regardless of losing or winning, go see the beautiful ""The Thin Red Line,"" in which 'the bad guys' are also human, not deceitful monsters, and the 'good guys' are not simply personifications of bravery, nationalism, and intolerance.",1012348800,5,613,4.719626168224299

However. . .  Just as he did in Schindler's List, Spielberg insists on bracketing the film with a kitschy feel-good mise-en-scene.  In Schindler, it's the former Listees paying tribute to Schindler by placing stones on his memorial.  Pure schmaltz, but marginally acceptable.  The whole adult-Private-Ryan ""*Am* I a good man, I ask you, my dear wife?"" bracketing (visiting the graves in Normandy)--was a total waste.

1242789,2,B00000K3AM,"If Spielberg would work in Stalin's vicinity he would surely have been life-appointed as Chief State Director. His movies are superb totalitarian craftsmanship that goes far beyond its Soviet founders. I think propagandistic themes have never been so smoothly explored before Spielberg. For example, let's watch some footage with German troopers: they are... and what's most important not personalized at all. Personalization is one sure way toward deviationism, because it would give the no matter how unlikely possibility of watchers to sympathize. The German in Spielberg movies he's unlike any German you now, as Jews in Nazi portrayals. They are objective enemies, whose crime is possibility of offence not offence itself. These people are faceless, simple masses to be disposed of because they don't fit in with present ideology. Depersonalization (the Fritz in this case, Capitalist or Bourgeois to Communists, Jew to Nazis) is of course one of most immediate demands in completing this task. On the other hand, the ""good"" Allies are faceless, soulless and linear as well. They have no particular feelings, except some violent outbursts and commercial memory of their idyllic lives at home (probably one of his compromises to make money from). In fact, both enemy and ally could easily be interchanged with no loss at all. As Stalin said: ""You might never know where the next deviationist will appear from!""... The keenness of avoiding ideological deviations is something quite rare if not masterful compared to the large segment of propaganda movie productions today on the market. Another unusual quality struck me: the art of making people feel they actually reasoned during watching just through the simple technique of putting the questions whose (mostly incorrect) answers are already known by heart through state sponsored indoctrination.",1010880000,7,1852,5.411764705882353

The graphic, and extremely necessary, depictions of World War 2, the amazing cinemetography by the amazing Janusz Kaminski, the extraordinary direction by the always dependable Steven Spielberg, and the unbeatable performances by the stellar, first-rate cast, led by, in my eyes, the best actor of his or possibly any generation, Tom Hanks. This film is astoundind from every aspect. Of course, when it came out on DVD, I was the first to buy it, and tokk it home and sat in awe as I watched the film almost repeatedly all day, analyzing it's endless, and I do mean infinite, complexities. From the extremely pulse-pounding and gut-wrenching opening on the beaches of Normandy during the infamous D-Day invasion on June 6th, 1944, to the climactic end battle scene, this film stays thrilling every moment. I could easily say that this is the best war film ever made, which it is with no doubt, but for some reason, that just isn't enough. Being an absolute movie maniac, I have seen any move you can ever name.

But let's cut to the chase, firstly, Tom Hanks as usual is great, the rest of the cast, probably the best movie for everyone, the are all well known but in other movies their acting abilities are either not shown or are not able to be shown, but in this movie all proof to be great, smart, serious actors, the all make you fell like you are there fighting and finding Private James Ryan. The story is pretty good, plus, the movie is pretty moving. And the best of it is it's Cinematography, never a director had put into screen a more accurate, realistic, intelligent and crude way haw the war really was, this is THE movie for looking at the war in this time, D-day. The scene of D-day, is an incredible achievement, I watched it with some friends the other day and we were all amazed like if it was the first time, plus the AMAZING sound of the DVD makes it more realistic. The special features are fairly good considering it is not a Collectors Edition, if you buy a war movie, buy this if you don't already have it. You will not be disappointed, this movie deserves more stars and more Oscars, it should have got Best Movie, what was the Academy thinking, oh well if they loved Titanic so much, it is perfectly understandable that they prefer silly and romantic films like Shakespeare in Love, which was not that good. Saving Private Ryan was 100 times better, perhaps not in customs and soundtrack since it has virtually none, or maybe it gets lost with all the bullets that are fired, but it deserved much more, well the movie does not need to be reassured of it's greatness, just watch if you are in a hurry the first 40 minutes and the last 30 minutes and you will see my point. Pearl Harbor tried to imitate the filming style for the attack, and sure it was good, but we all know the original. This is the one.",1008720000,4,2197,4.360975609756098
1242793,5,B00000K3AM,"I think you have to rate this movie on two different criteria.  First, how realistically does it portray D-Day and the fighting in Normandy?  Here, it is unparalleled and a remarkable feat of film making.  The D-Day invasion sequence is the most powerful 20 minutes of film, ever.  All of Speilberg's choices - the handheld cameras, the chaotic action, the sound effects and the painfully graphic gore - couldn't be better.  Short of going back in time and filming the first wave landing on Omaha Beach, I don't know how it could be any more realistic.  The squad's subsequent journey through Normandy to find Private Ryan is also very good.  There is a real sense of how scattered the American troopers (esp. the airborne) were, and how isolated they were because of the lack of reliable communications between the pockets of soldiers.
Setting aside the issue of how accurately the film portrays the fighting, is it a good movie?  Here, my answer is a slightly less enthusiastic ""yes"".  Tom Hanks couldn't be better.  Low-key but has clearly earned the respect of his men.  The burdens of command are a little over done - the speech in the church about justifying sending men to their death was like being hit over the head with a hammer.  Hanks' acting alone conveyed this point; the speech wasn't necessary.  The supporting cast was also great.  I particularly liked the sniper.  By and large the plot is a good one, but I have to agree with those who felt like the ending was a little too predictable and ""Hollywood"".  Nevertheless, this is a powerful movie, and one everyone should see at least once.
The DVD special features were very slick.  I particularly enjoyed ""Into the Breach"" - a sort of ""Making of SPR.""  The production notes were also very interesting, and the cast bios are some of the most complete I've seen on DVDs.  It's clear that there was an extra effort made to make the special features worthy of the film.",1008633600,,1932,4.679525222551929

Like Apocalypse Now its all about the horrors and rigors of armed men locked into a very hot and dangerous environment. each about a questionable soul searching mission that explores the true realm of the darkness of war itself. The only other movies that fullfills this mission besides Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, and even some parts of Enemy at the Gates.",1008115200,,737,4.507462686567164

Then it was on television last week, and I thought I would see it on the small screen, not as much to deal with emotionally during ""that scene.""  Oh, boy! I was THERE, on the beach, with the men, I got so involved it was unbelievable.
There isn't a loose moment, a bad second of film or one wrong word of dialogue. I cared deeply about every single guy, I felt everything they did, albeit from the comfort of my home, and I was totally transfixed all the way through and riveted at the end...I was worn out, exhausted from my emotions, and imbued with a new respect and awe at what these young guys went through. I admire Mr. Spielberg, and fail to understand (nor do I want to)the enmity which is flung his way from lesser beings, whose vision is limited by their own hubris and lack of ability or generosity of spirit to acknowledge his greatness in his field.
This man knows how to tell a story. He has skills beyond those of other directors and he is unparalleled at directing movies of this scope. He is creating templates of enormous quality for those who come after him, to follow and utilize and thereby learn and create their own visions, with a nod in his direction, and for his direction.
I have not been this moved from a movie in many years, and I thank Mr. Spielberg for his window into a world that was previously unavilable to me. Afterwards, I was speechless, literally, and called my friend the next day and tried, with little success to convey how deeply affected I was from this incredible film.
A cinematic masterpiece and one that will affect many more generations yet to come. My brother saw this at a matinee in his relatively small town in Colorado, and a group of teenage girls was playing hooky from school to see Matt Damon: After the opening scene, one of them approached my brother and weakly inquired: ""Mister, is this real? Is this a true story?""

Why does Schlockberg have to have at least one ""Oscar""scene in every damn movie he directs?At some point in a Schlockberg production the main character has to weep(Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan)or Liam Neeson at the end of Schindler's List;or the cute child has to be part of a ""magical"" moment(Drew Barrymore touching fingers with E.T. and E.T'S finger lights up);or in Close Encounters of the Third Kind (the cute little boy whispers bye bye to the aliens as they board their spaceship);or the little girl from Poltergeist who does and says one cutesy thing after another. Even in Schlockberg's finest hour,Schindler's List,there is the scene where the child walks around with the red flower-the only color in a black and white feature. And of course it just would not be a Schlockberg movie without the ubiquitous,god awful theme music that always accompanies a touching or exciting scene ,as if the audience is too dumb to notice the images on the screen. His movies are popular,but they are far from great cinema. His condescending movies can't speak for themselves-they simply aren't good enough.

There is a very good moral lesson taught in this movie. Somewhere along the course of our lives, someone made a sacrifice so that you could be where you are now. Earn it.

1242798,2,B00000K3AM,"I must admit, Steven Spielberg is not my cup of tea. I find his films to be shallow, mainstream, and too much about America. I have a problem with the way he tells his films. Spielberg always has to exploit the emotional moments of a film and push it so far that it ends up being embarrassing and laughable (Like the end of SCHINDLER'S LIST or when Private Ryan salutes the tombstone at the end of this film). I also dislike the ""Spielbergian close-ups"". Why does he always have to shove the camera up the actor's face? For the most part, SCHINDLER'S LIST is the one exception. Its documentary approach to telling its story helped Spielberg to stay clear of his usual blunders (At least until the end of the film, when Spielberg could no longer control himself). SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is just one long testament to America as a nation. The film opens with the American flag. It depicts the story of a small group of American soldiers defeating the more numerous Germans. The latter is depicted as a faceless crowd, except for the one German soldier who is completely humiliated in a scene with the American soldiers, and ends up begging for his life. Spielberg is passing judgement on history, and that is a very dangerous thing to do. Has he ever asked himself what he would have done if he were an eighteen year-old German lad when the war broke out? Would he have belonged to the minority who opposed the Nazi rule? Most likely not. Most people wouldn't. We also have the scene with the French family begging the Americans for help. Europeans are also humiliated in this film. The invasion-scene is impressive. I'll admit that. But this is only 30 minutes out of a film that runs for almost three hours. And people who hail the film can't seem to find anything to talk about except for those thirty minutes. After the invasion-scene the film falls flat on its belly, because there is nothing of interest in it. There is nothing in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN we didn't already know. People have hailed the realism of the film, and sure, the violence of the film seems to be very realistic. But I for one didn't need to see a film like this to understand that war is bloody. Perhaps that's necessary for people who watch too much CNN? America has a tendency to forget that the bombs they drop actually kill people. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN provokes me. It provokes me because it has turned World War 2 into a clash between America and Germany. It's reductionism at its worst. It's what renowned peace researcher Johan Galtung would call war journalism; the tendency of western media to reduce any conflict into an image of only two parties opposing each other. I don't mean to undermine the role that America played in achieving allied victory. But Spielberg certainly intends to undermine the role Europe played in achieving allied victory.
I think it's important for a war film to show us the individuals it depicts. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN never managed to do that. It's not enough having Tom Hanks shake is hand a little to show us that he's falling a part. APOCALYPSE NOW was a momentous war film. It depicted the breaking down of the individual and the madness of the mind (Something THE THIN RED LINE also attempted at, but never fully managed). BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI is another example of a great war film. It focuses on the paradox of man during war. PLATOON and BORN ON THE 4th OF JULY are two of Oliver Stone's (Or should it be Oliver Stoned?) best films. DAS BOOT is perhaps the greatest war film ever made. Wolfgang Petersen threw the ideologies that roamed the surface overboard (Without, as a German, denying history), and focused on the crew and what they were fighting for; Survival. Thus DAS BOOT became a film about individuals rather than nations. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN ends up being too much about America (The only nation to ever be charged and convicted with terrorism by an international court of Law), to be a film about individuals.",1006560000,10,3942,4.624821683309558

The script, the acting and the cinematography are all extremely good and make for a very entertaining and enjoyable movie.  It also is a good thinking movie with lots of situations that can be catalysts for discussion and reflection.
Is one man ever worth risking the lives of many?
Should a captured enemy simply be killed when the chance exists he may be a future threat?
To what extant does a man follow orders?  Are there gray areas?
Do men fight in war for a cause, a country or simply for their compatriot?

1242803,2,B00000K3AM,"This movie, like many American productions (with the notable exception of ""Full Metal Jacket"" and some parts of ""Platoon""), is a farce.
First of all, many scenes of combat are totally unrealistic. I could produce a long list of inconsistencies, but I shall content myself with mentioning the obvious ones. The first 20 minutes are very well shot with hand-held cameras and represent the best part of the movie, but even then the shifting fortunes of the fight are conveyed showing only American losses at the beginning, then -- after the destruction of the main bunker -- only German ones. There usually was no hand-to-hand combat in the trenches. In one of the most ludicrous scenes, a wall crumbles and two groups of soldiers - one American and one German - caught in the act of planning strategy in adjacent rooms, look at each other and challenge the enemy to surrender for long seconds before somebody starts firing. This is science fiction, point.
The final battle in the town brings in the worst of the movie. No competent German commander would move two Tiger tanks straight in the town (where every window could hide a sniper armed with AT weapons), in violation of basic WWII tactics. After entering the town, the German squads usually advance in a single row, at minimal distance from each other and without providing suppression fire, allowing the Americans to mow them down. Spielberg even provides the viewer with a furious hand-to-hand fight with drawn blades between an American and a German soldier, rolling on the floor in a death embrace - he could supply them with swords, shields and maybe a few spells to cast at each other, and his effort of imagination would be complete. The ways the Tiger tanks are destroyed are also unrealistic.
If that were all, the movie would only be childish and unrealistic. But, typically, Spielberg has the vulgarity to convey a moral message (rather than encouraging the viewer to formulate his own answers). He purports to convey two kinds of
myths: a pacifist and an anti-nationalsocialist one. That he does in a most insipid way, reviving the standardized stereotype of the ""plebeian hero"", or, to express the same concept in different words, the ""citizen soldier"" celebrated by another popular historian and upholder of the religion of human rights & mass democracy, Stephen E. Ambrose.
The standard American tactic in France consisted in withdrawing their troops at the slightest sign of serious resistance, levelling the area with fighter-bombers and artillery, and then advancing on the rubbles. That would be a realistic portrayal of war on the Western Front, but, of course, it would hardly be a celebration of the virtues of the American crusaders, come ""over there"" to liberate their brethen from the chains of racism and
oppression. That's why the citizen soldiers - all ordinary people with no military traditions or special penchant for patriotism - suddenly discover extraordinary qualities of courage and willpower within their hearts, choosing to sacrifice their young lives in behalf of the Cause, and offering a (once more, totally unrealistic - in the real world fifty elite SS troopers armed with heavy equipment and supported by Tiger tanks would effortlessy wipe away Ryan's small detachment) long and hardened resistance, till the forces of Good - in the Happy End of standard Hollywood tradition - come and rescue the lone survivor.
I would like to compare this movie with Nazi or Communist (or -- Taleban!) propaganda - it's stupid, it's popular, it works in impressing moral feelings on the herd's minds. And has lots of expensive special effects and is commercially successful -- a typically American movie in true Spielberg fashion.",1005177600,8,3714,5.0308441558441555
1242804,5,B00000K3AM,"This is my favorite movie ever, for a good reason.  It is like real war.  I can't say this from experience, because I haven't been in a war, but my grandfather has and some other grownups I know have, and they say this is EXACTLY what it is like.
Other war movies are all glamorous, and usually predictable.  Two sides fight each other, some people on the main character's side die.  The main character says ""Ok, NOW I'm mad..."" (or something like it) and is suddenly amazingly skilled and kills everyone.  That's not what this movie is like at all, and it's obvious from the beginning.  When they are storming the beach, the front of a boat opens up, and immediately every single person (like 12 people) get shot.  No one has time to hide, they just die.  This is constantly repeated throughout the movie, about how everyone is equally touchable.  There is no glamour.  They have to crawl through the mud, taking loaded weapons off of dead colleagues to save ammo.
Even if you took out all the war, this would be a good movie (although not amazing).  The story is set in World War II.  One mother has four sons, three of which are killed in a battle.  Tom Hanks' character, in command of other soldiers, are sent to find the mother's fourth son so the army won't have to tell the mother that all four of her children were killed at once.  The simple moral questions of this movie are intriguing enough; is it right to send 8 men to save one, no matter how sad his mother will be?
This story is carried out amazingly, making you feel sad, angry, and even making you laugh (you'll know it when you see it.)  Combine this amazing story with the fantastic war scenes, and you have the best war movie ever (according to the majority of critics... Stanley Kubrick may disagree, but I dont).
One other thing.  I hate war movies.  I have seen a few (Full Metal Jacket comes to mind, as well as some others), and they bored me.  So when a war movie can be my favorite, considering I hate most of the other ones, it says something.",1004400000,,2022,4.375335120643432

  MISSION: SAVING PRIVATE RYAN
  World War II was a pivotal event of the 20th century and a defining moment for America and the world. It shifted the borders of the globe. It forever changed those who lived through it, and shaped generations to come. It has been called ""the last great war"", hopefully it will be.
  The jaw-dropping velocity of this shattering piece of filmmaking lodges hard in the mind. One leaves the cinema with a drained, feeble gait as the mind attemps, if not to free the mind of the terror it has just encountered, but just to accept it. As a generation, we have become sadly distanced from these realities which ravaged another generation so brutally. This film is most certainly a wake-up call for all those who mock the old, believing all that their war stories amounted to was a tedious ""during the war"" monologue on obsolete battle techniques. The first forty minutes of horror, when the camera weaves in and out of the most brutal and gritty a massacre i have ever seen, one does not spectate but partake. Even the camera seems to be flinching as it takes us on a jittery paranoid sweep of the heartbreaking carnage that unfurls before us, as if itself fears the bullet. This documentary style spares the film from Hollywood glamorization and the distinct lack of infuriating wisecracks was fantastically refreshing. This certain breed of heroism is therefore lent an unprecedented credibility-putting pay to the ridiculous Hollywood notion, that while being surrounded by carnage and dodging bullets, you actually care to make inane banter - men are reduced to screaming fetal messes crying for their mothers, that is real terror, the type that makes you want to return to the womb, the stuff of nightmares. It is in this uncompromising harshness that the core of humanity is found. Spielberg grabs history and rips it open to leave the exposed bleeding heart of man. It is on this note that one leaves the stalls, with a grating sense of mortality. Spielberg wished this film to resensitize us to violence, and that it most definitely does, it makes violence actually violent. In comprehending this, we begin again to appreciate our own mortality, to take a look around and re-evaluate our life. Being assaulted by death, life seems all the more alive. It is on Capt. Miller's dying words that we feel weak walking into the air, for after all they sacrificed, look at all the world must earn.
  As the saying goes, ""history repeats itself"", we just all hope and pray, a war as gruesome as this will never happen amidst our time, especially now that the problem on terrorism has been worsening and worsening day by day. We all wish to spend a truly peaceful, Merry Christmas and a new year.",1003363200,,2980,4.728323699421965

  this film tells the story of a squad of closely-knit soldiers sent on a mission to rescue Private James Ryan.  Ryan's three brothers are killed on D-Day and the Army wants the sole-remaining Ryan to be returned home.
  but of course the squad runs into problems.  two men are shot, and the captain, John Miller (Tom Hanks) has nervous breakdowns.

More importantly, they captured the feel of the approaching tanks.  You feel tanks before you hear them, and the sound guys got that.  Amazing.

Anyone who wishes to detract from this movie's value has to have some seriously flawed logic in doing so.  Not one thing about this movie is stupid, trivial, or uninteresting.  The battle scenes have few worthy comparisons, the dialogue is substantial and meaningful, the settings are perfect, and the impact should not be lost on anyone.

1242812,1,B00000K3AM,"I found this film ugly, stupid and offensive. There is a terrible suspicion that the much vaunted opening Normandy landing sequence is, ultimately, entertainment - the noise and the gore is horrific, but the audience has not been introduced to a single one of the casualties, and so the 'spectacle' is at some level dehumanised - this applies to the Americans, but doubly so to the Germans, who are the archetypal faceless evil.
*
Spielberg truly disgusted with his eye for the grotesque, even (I'm dismayed to say) the comical in the midst of this horror: think of the soldier whose helmet is shot, who then inspects it only to be shot again, this time fatally, in the head - this belongs in a cheesy Western, not in a film of serious intent; or the soldier who picks up his severed arm. Why are we being asked to witness this?  We do not know who these soldiers are - they are as expendable as extras in a genre horror film - and this is degrading when one considers the reality that is being depicted.
*
At the end of this opening sequence are we solely appalled, or have we, through the technical bravura, also been excited, in some shameful sense of the term?  Do we want to see the whole thing over again?  If yes, then what does that say about the film's allegedly 'anti-war' intent?
*
We are introduced to the central characters after all of this. They are not casualties of an anonymous 'war machine', but instead, more or less, follow a stereotypically heroic trajectory.  As archetypal heroes, they are portrayed as successful killers. The worst in this regard is the sniper, Jackson - in this character there is a repulsive conjuction of religious fervour, with its attendant self-righteousness, and fetishism regarding skill in marksmanship. This soldier's talent for killing is portrayed as unreflectively admirable - there is a despicable relish in his achievements, most notably in the moments prior to his death where he shoots (again faceless) German infantry. If we enjoy, even empathise, with his precision as a marksman, how is this 'anti-war'?  It seems no more 'anti-war' than a typical battle-based video game.
*
There is, of course, the sentimental core of the film, the actual saving of Private Ryan. Literally, this is undoubtedly unrealistic, so I assume we are expected to take it symbolically, perhaps as saying that the preservation of one individual life or, more likely, a way of life, can justify a larger sacrifice, the sacrifice of many lives.  Perhaps this explains the presence of Ryan's family in the opening and closing graveyard scenes - more than a single life has been saved. If this is the point, thenthere must be a better way to make it.  Making war into a fairy tale is inappropriate. To do so is stupid and manipulative.
*
In the end we have war as seen through the eyes of the man who brought us E.T. and Jurassic Park. If he were humble, he would recognise the limitations of his gifts, and make movies for children. Instead, he debases serious topics by rendering them childishly. No doubt this is satisfactory for viewers who delight in details concerning the authenticity of the tanks used, and in the quality of the sound effects, but that is to say for viewers who are children playing with toy soldiers.",1001030400,18,3259,4.727112676056338

The storyline is absolutely ludicrous.  I can't believe the military would take one of its best commanders and eight other soldiers and send them behind enemy lines on what amounts to a suicide mission because they feel sorry for a little old lady who lost three of her sons.  Especially at such a critical point in the war.  This is pure Hollywood fantasy.  The films depicton of military life and soldiers about to enter battle is similarly unbelievable.  No one ever utters a profanity, and people say heroic things before going into battle.  Spielberg's direction is at times as heavyhanded and maudlin as Frank Capra at his worst.
That said, it's certainly not a bad film.  It does portray the brutality of battle as no other film ever has before.  Not quite a classic though.",1000944000,,1023,4.551912568306011

This film represents the pinnacle not only of war movies, but of film making in my opinion.  The characters are memorable, the cinematography is amazing, the direction is right on, and the actor's all deliver with performances that are nothing short of perfect.
First let's talk about the cinematography.  It's wonderful.  The shots are all reminiscent of Life Magazine and the original images of the invasion.  This, however, is just where it begins.  Spielberg, ever the perfectionist, and his cinematographer (Janusz Kaminski) use a first person perspective of shaky camera's to put the viewer right in the middle of the battle.  Whether it's on the beach, or pinned down in the middle of a french village, the viewer certainly feels as if he is there with those soldiers.
The script itself was a wonderful story.  The idea that you would risk a few to bring out one man because he is the last of four children is powerful.  ....  The sacrifice these men made for one was selfless and honorable.  The writers certainly captured the spirit of what is being called ""The Greatest Generation.""
As for the actors, well, they were amazing.  Tom Hanks is certainly the best actor of this time period and he proves it with this performance.  Tom Sizemore is excellent as the competent and battle hardened sergeant.  Barry Pepper delievers the performance of a lifetime as the religious sniper and Giovanni Ribisi's performance as a soulfull medic makes me wonder why he accepts such [bad] parts in movies like Mod Squad (to name just one of his many horrible movie choices).
In short, this movie was robbed when it lost out to Shakespeare in Love and is one of the greatest movies ever made.  If you don't own in on DVD then you need to buy it NOW!!",1000857600,,1854,4.768025078369906

The first 20 minutes or so of the film is some of the rawest, most gripping, most brutal piece of film ever filmed. It's tough to watch, and definitley not for everyone. The rest of the film is the same way. The war scenes are as real as real could get. You'll feel like you were right there. The sound is the greatest sound I've experienced in watching a film.

There are moments of this film that will haunt you for a very long time. There is only one moment in the film that sorta ruins it. It's a scene where a German passes an American on the steps after killing one of his fellow soldiers. The German, with gun in hand, just looks at the American and keeps walking. That part is Hollywood. Thankfully, it was the only part. The cast is incredibly good. Tom Hanks is phenomenal. Matt Damon is good, but he could've been given a better part. There's a rather odd cameo by Ted Danson halfway through the film. What's Sam Malone doing there?. This is a very special, important film. You need to watch this.

It's really 2 stories - one fictional and one true. The first half-hour or so is an authentic masterpiece of recreating the D-day invasion at Omaha beach. Speilberg's use of hand-held cameras to give you a ""your are one of the grunts"" perspective and spectacular special effects is simply amazing. Interesting to note that there is no music soundtrack during this period of the movie.
The other story is a fictional account of a hardened group of soldiers being sent to retrieve one private (Ryan), who has lost 3 brothers in recent fighting. Many have criticized this movie, maintaining the military would never have attempted this. But these people miss the point. Assuming this did happen, I believe this movie shows correctly how the real soldiers would have handled the situation. In fact, in telling this story, Speilberg allows us to understand how and why the characters deal with the terrible scenarios they face, as well as how the soldiers bond with one another. Ironically, at the end, you understand exactly why the military would never attempt such a rescue!
The acting is outstanding and very believable. There may be some sterotypes, but people with these character backgrounds did exist and fight in the war at all levels and positions.
Others have criticized the opening and ending scenes at the cemetary. Remember, it was watching a WWII vet collapse in front of a fallen comrade's grave that inspired Speilberg to do this movie in the first place - so it does deserve to be depicted, even if it is over-emphasized to some degree.
Overall, this is a true masterpiece, because it's a movie that leaves a permanent impression on those who have the guts to watch it. It should have won the Best Picture award.

1242817,5,B00000K3AM,"As Stanley Kubrick, Sam Peckinpah, and Oliver Stone have showed before, war IS hell--not a glamorized John-Wayne-beats-the-bad-guys cornball cliche. And in 1998, after all the glamorizing of war by actors like Arnold Schwarzenneger and the like, Steven Spielberg joined the fray with his incredible epic SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.
Though bookended with the aging Private James Ryan and his family visiting a war memorial in France, the film opens with a stunning recreation of the D-Day invasion of June 6, 1944, where thousands of troops storm Omaha Beach, led by such fine actors as Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, and Edward Burns. Before they even set foot on the beach, however, the German guns on the top of the bluff overlooking it open fire, and instantly it becomes a firestorm of ferocious proportions, with much in the way of blood, gore, and painful death.  This stunning sequence, lasting some twenty-four minutes, ranks right up there with such films as THE WILD BUNCH and FULL METAL JACKET for depicting the sheer horrors of war.
The bulk of Spielberg's film focuses on Hanks leading his platoon into deepest Nazi-occupied France on a mission to save a young paratrooper (Matt Damon) who has lost three brothers to combat in other theatres of World War II and has now been given his ticket home. One may not think this makes for a very good or even exciting movie in conventional action terms. As for drama and characterization, however, it is splendid. The siege of the bombed-out French town that concludes this film is nearly as good as the opening D-Day storming.
Spielberg humanizes his characters as he has done in virtually every film he has made; we are made to care about these men and what they stand for. In the end, this makes the violence and death of war much more painful to contemplate than the glamor of a Schwarzenneger or a John Wayne right-wing tract.

It will probably be remembered for these brutal minutes, yet the movie is much more than that. It is a look at war itself and the people who fight in it. From Omaha Beach, Capt. Jack Miller and his squad are sent to find a soldier who has been given a ticket home because three of his brothers have died. This plot has become legendary and has been parodied and spoofed to no end. But this movie is exceptionally complex, you bond with the men of the squad, and although a bit more development would have been nice, its still a compelling movie. The problem I have is that it has been called the best WWII film. Discounting period films that didn't directly deal with war like Schindler's List, I can think of a couple of equal or better ones right off the bat. The Dirty Dozen, A Midnight Clear, Das Boot, and The Bridge on the River Kwai. This is a great movie, but the others were superior in their own ways. Dozen provided comic insight, Midnight is my favorite WWII film and shows the evolution of boys to men, it is a touching coming of age story. Das Boot is a submarine story told from the side of the Germans, they are developed as real, substantial young men who just wanted honor and glory, and you end up hoping they accomplish their mission even knowing it could be your relatives on those boats. Kwai is the Pacific Theater, but it is so good and holds up so well, I just had to include it. Alec Guinness is a stubborn proud British officer who wants to build a bridge for the Japanese as a testimony to the superiority of Britain, but doesn't see the consequences. This movie definitely ranks among the best WWII movies, but calling one the best is like saying that orange is better than black, all of these movies are trying to say different things, and all do it well. -m-",998956800,,1982,4.4032697547683926

I think this is the most moving picture I have ever seen.  It brings home the true horror of war, and especially of the War in Europe.  The men who fought this war didn't brag when they came back, they kept their mouths shut and sealed it in.

The writer, later making a big mistake with ""The Patiot"" creates some very good character development in the platoon, lead by Tom Hanks. But certain trite mishaps in dialogue create questions of authenticity.
Overall, by the end, we have the effect Spielberg was searching in his masterful directing. We have to look on the soldiers during WWII as being courageous, heroic and very human. They saved the west, the east and created a new world for us. Sacrifices had to be made, unfortunately.

1242825,5,B00000K3AM,"The film starts with the most difficult part of the most important plan of the Allies, the Normandy Landing. The success of the amphibious landing depens on the air support as well. The sound of the terrible waves and the cannon-fires in the background, the conflict of fear and courage experienced by the soldiers in the boat are the signs of the hell waiting for them.
 With the first orders given by the commander and the lowering of the hatch of the boat, the merciless fight starts. Unbelievable effects and death scenes in slow motion create a perfect picture of a war. At first sight Germans who fire their guns from an upper level seem to have the advantage but we observe the strength of the Allied forces and their strong belief in glory. The Allied forces manage to pass through the German front. The next thing is to get in contact with the troops landed by air. At this very moment it'S understood that Private Ryan is the last son of a family whose three sons have been killed in other fronts. Private Ryan has to be saved. Captain John Miller must take his men behind the enemy lines to find Private Ryan. They're risking their own lives for him. In that emotional state other soldiers react strongly but the order was definite and signed by the President of the United States. Despite the several questions in thier minds they have to go and find him. They don't realize that they could have in this position. Here at this point we understand the importance of the continuation of a family for the American society.
 After several attempts Private Ryan is found in a squad defending a bridge of strategic importance. He refuses to go back even after he learns the sad news. His aim is to fulfill his duty in the U.S. Army which he thinks is an horror. This is a very good example of mutual respect between the country and citizen. This is one of the very important reasons which makes the United States so powerful.
 Even though there were several losses in his squad he was safe at the end. He thinks anybody in his situation would have to go back, too.

1242826,4,B00000K3AM,"So much praise has been heaped upon ""Saving Private Ryan,"" I feel compelled to meekly point out that Steven Spielberg's World War II epic, stirring as it is, really isn't quite the unqualified masterpiece its made out to be.
Lets start with the celebrated opening battle scene, which just about everyone immediately points to as the films highlight. On that Im in complete agreement--this 25-minute sequence of carnage, an exhaustive recreation of the Normandy invasion, is so enormously convincing that it all but sucks the juice out of the rest of the movie. And yes, though some Ryan enthusiasts might prefer to think otherwise, there is still a two-hour movie to follow, and rarely is it as gripping or effective as its prologue.
Not that Ryan is a bad film--its a rather good one, actually, shot with handheld cameras that bring a chilling immediacy and palpable texture to the story. Aside from Spielbergs excellent direction, all credit is due to the fine cast. Just when you think you're going to be sick at the sight of Tom Hanks in yet another Oscar-worthy role, the man surprises you--hes never shown deeper range, subtlety, or quiet intensity than he does as Captain John Miller. Equally impressive is Jeremy Davies as Timothy Upham, a stammering, vulnerable young corporal whose fear we can completely identify with.
There are individual moments in Ryan that are almost staggering in their intensity--and Im not just talking about the battle scenes. Im talking about an early moment in the film, when the gentle pitter-patter of raindrops on leaves consciously echoes the sound of bullets, and the sound of soldiers footsteps. Im talking about the slow-motion closeup of Hanks face as he arrives on the beach, unable to comprehend the fiery chaos around him--the most penetrating and lyrical image in the entire movie. Its moments like these that make you wish the entire film held together more convincingly; its cumulative power, though very real, feels more fragmented than organic, more sporadic than enveloping.
Where Ryan stumbles is where so many grand epic-minded films stumble--the script. This is, of course, a war film, so its not fair to expect a lot of witty repartee. Nevertheless, I wouldnt have minded had the dialogue been a bit more memorable, or if it had shown a bit more freedom from the conventions on which it falls so often.  Other flaws kept nagging at me throughout--why did Spielberg feel the need to include those unnecessary present-day bookends?  His film is pointed and emotional enough without having to resort to a device like that.  Why introduce a young private that Miller and his men accidentally mistake for Ryan, when we in the audience know very well that theres more than an hour and a half to go before the big climax?  Why the constant refrain of John Williams score during moments when silence would be more effective?  For every masterstroke there seems to be a minor but damaging misstep, and its unnecessary punches like these that remind us that Saving Private Ryan is still just a movie, and that Spielberg, as fine a storyteller as he is, has not risen entirely above the occasional cheap manipulation.
Much has been made about Saving Private Ryan being robbed at the Oscars, which is really a load of tomfoolery if youve actually seen the film that beat it for best picture. The Academy was right to name Spielberg the best director, but they were even more right to name Shakespeare in Love the better movie.  As a tribute to the men who gave up their lives on the battlefield, Saving Private Ryan is an admirable and important film.  As a cinematic achievement, it must be held to a higher standard.",996537600,3,3665,4.882636655948553

The germans were made to look like morons who don't follow any basic military protocol, thus getting slaughtered. Uhhhhh, weren't these guys known throughout the war to triumph in hopeless situations where they were outmanned and outgunned? The ""tiger tank"" mockups were just that, hastily dressed up t-34 russian tanks that looked something like a tiger if you looked at it from the right angle. And i found the way german soldiers were portrayed, as a bunch of mindless skinheads, to be unnecessary and irresponsible.

Over-all the plot is pretty simple and some liberties have been taken with history (as with  virtually all movies ""based on..."") but this film makes you appreciate what it must have felt like to be involved in the Normandy invasion.  The graphics were wonderful with no aliasing artifacts and the colors authentic.  The sound track and DTS implementation were also well-done, further enhancing the realism.  A very minor technical gripe on the sound was that in some scene transitions the sound disappeared when  the soundtrack faded.  This occurred twice but probably most people won't notice this.  Technically flawless otherwise.
Spielberg won accolades for filtering scenes to give a documentary look...while this was interesting on the beach scenes, it seems he had two cameras and the effect was different...it was very distracting because he obviously cut back and forth between cameras (one with the effect and one without - at first I thought it was a problem with my DVD player since this was the first DVD I bought!).  In the end I think the effect was good, but should have been applied uniformily in the beach scenes.  If you look for it you will see what I mean - the effect is like haze on the lens and when sunlight hits the lens there is a sort of diffraction bands on bright parts of the image...again, it added realism but the inconsistancy of the effect from cut to cut was disturbing.  One last technical gripe is that the TIGER tanks shown seemed not to be full scale and looked a bit cheesy.  All these are minor gripes of a perfectionist though.
All in all, I strongly recommend this DVD - if you are a war movie buff it is a modern slice of a WWII experience...perhaps what Oliver Stone's ""Platoon"" was to Vietnam movies - unlike many WWII movies that glorify the allies and war, this paints a somewhat more balanced picture - albeit with some liscence on aspects of history - but the movie as a portrayal of the type of combat seen in western Europe is a good one - with the starting and ending battle sequences really hitting home.",996105600,2,2093,4.642276422764228

The details of WWII aren't sugar-coated and Speilberg doesn't spend precious time trying to beat around the bush... THIS IS WAR! It smells like war, tastes like war, feels like war, and anyone who has particapated in a war can blatantly testify to this. War is hell, and this is probably the closest many viewers will get to either. Though this film went out of its way to present its chracters as real, normal folks like you and me (not the gold plated figures of John Wayne films), in the end the people of this film did come out of it as heroes. This is what they were, and a one man raid wasn't neeeded to tell us that. This film is as good as or equal to ""Schindler's List,"" WATCH IT!",996019200,,831,4.2
1242830,4,B00000K3AM,"This is one of those movies that recieved a lot of praise from the vets who were there. Also more than 70 critics e.g. time magazine; USA Today etc. who named this movie in the best picture catigory. it also won 2 golden globes and 5 oscars in 1998. But there are those few who also condemn the film for either its [...] story line or historical inaccuracies and so on. But now let look at the film fair and square.
Plot: By now everyone knows this, a captain and 7 other men is assigned to rescue a paratrooper name Pvt. James Ryan (after a bloody landing at Omaha Beach on D-Day) who lost three of his brothers. Hence a Public relation mission.
Now for the good parts that were offer in this movie is its technical achievment in sound effects as well as visual effects which played a major part in the first 25 minutes in the movie at Omaha Beach. Then again the sound effects and visual played a major plot to keep this movie up. What will happen if we removes those two things? in my opinion this movie would just be another ""typical war movie"". Spielberg was wise in using a special camera in this movie which gave the picture quality a rather a ""documentary look"" to make the movie more spectacular which is a great artistic touch.
 Not every one likes the plot of the movie. But this is loosly based on an actual event (not involving any one name Ryan).
One serious drawback is the despiction of the German soldiers. THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME (bald heads). that is why I took a star off. Look in the history books they do not look like that. In fact they had hair (Most of them). They were also younger at the time. Also a little bit of patriatism was shown  Without those flaws, this movie is almost perfect Should you see this movie? Well I should say yes, despite the problems this film has, it is worth to watch but be warned, it is graphically violent. Enjoy.",995587200,,1868,4.3039772727272725

One group of soldiers is given orders to look for one man who was misdropped and now they are  questioning whats the point of wasting their own lives for one man. While they go hunting for this soldier they come across the grusomeness of the war, knowing  that any minute they might be next to die. The beginning battle and the skirmish at the end of the movie are the two best filmed combat sequences ever in a war movie.

This movie uses a small, albeit cute, story as a vehicle to portray the absolute violence and cruelty of war. The reason Spielberg is a master is because he doen't have to 'Spike Lee' his movies to nail a hidden message or theme through the viewers. SPR is an in your face absolutely astounding visual and audio presentation of war at it's bloodiest and ugliest!
I would venture to guess that most people, including myself, buy this DVD after having seen the movie so the Mid-Western plotline should be no surprise.

We're already seeing the homage to SPR........Enemy at the Gates, Pearl Harbour, The Thin Red Line and I'm sure more to come!  SPR was unbelievably real!  The sound effects of richocheting bullets off metal, bricks and rock doesn't get to be anymore realistic!  I was sitting next to a war veteran at the movies and the sound just took him right back to his war!  He relived his experience again!  That takes skill and vision!!  The action scenes were authentic and graphic like never before!!  I'll always remember how the German soldiers fell after being shot, they fell as they would if they were really shot!  The horrifying scenes on the Normandy beaches of soldiers praying and the fear they exhibited.  All in all, it gave us an extremely realistic look at WW2.  It doesn't get any better than that, except on a documentary with live footage!  If the plot isn't up to some standards, well its Hollywood!!  Everything's been covered at least once by now.

1242837,5,B00000K3AM,"I am going to be wholly honest in my review. Saving Private Ryan is not a perfect film, nor is the story anything more than a vehicle to take a band of soldiers from one necessary encounter to another.  The story is mediocre, and I have no problem crediting other reviewers who pointed this out.
What the film does with extraodinary precision and accuracy, is re-create situations that no one reading this review will ever want to be in.  The sheer madness, brutality and terrifying experience of landing at Normandy is brought to life in thirty minutes of film that I consider to be unparalleled.  Throughout the entire landing scene, all I could think was that people my age actually did this - the scene is not fiction.  The effective use of hand-held cameras and the stripping of the color lenses only enhance the landing sequence, and make you feel like you're there.
The middle of the film can be slow at times, but the script drops in a sniper, gun post, and other brief sequences to keep the movie moving as the plot and characters are fleshed out. The film moves towards a dramatic showdown over a bridge.  The final sequences are as exciting, yet frightening as anything you'll ever see.
The film does a remarkable job of illustrating that many of the soldiers who fought this war were just kids, from different backgrounds and all fighting a war while recognizing the utter madness that surrounded them.  Spielberg deserves mountains of credit for portraying the violence in a non-Hollywood manner.  The violence is excessive and at times hard to stomach, but the honesty and realness of the war scenes greatly enhance the impact of the film.  Spileberg shows us what war is really like, and not a glamorized version that is so often presented to us. And the violence is not used to entertain (unlike in Gladiator, which deplores the violence of the Collaseum within the film but then glorifies it to entertain the moviegoer).
The cast is well-rounded, with Tom Hanks giving a highly-effective performance as a Captain who is tired of wathcing the kids he's trained die in front of him.  Tom Sizemore, Ed Burns, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribesi, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, and Jeremy Davies round out a diverse and talented cast.
Even if parts of the film bore you, Saving Private Ryan is a film that everyone should see, all the time telling themselves that young men actually lived this.  For lack of a better phrase, they saved the world, as did soldiers from the myriad of other countires that fought against the Axis Powers.  While some people criticize the film for making it appear that Americans were the only people fighting in WWII, I believe that the concept of the film was to show the effects of war on a small band of soldiers.  There were too many indivuduals who fought bravely in WWII to recognize in one film.
Finally, people can use this film to appreciate the tremendous sacrifice that those before us made. Although I knew some basics about WWII, I never fully realized the odds and implications of the landing at Normandy.  My grandfather landed at Normandy and stormed the beach. He survived that day, and the entire war.  But he did not survive long enough to meet me, as he passed on four months before my birth in 1977.  I will never get to meet my grandfather, but will always know that he was a brave man.",993772800,2,3341,4.6678023850085175
1242838,5,B00000K3AM,"This movie gets high marks for the battle scenes alone which are brutally terrifying. The opening scene gives the audience a taste of what is must be like for troops relying on superior numbers to overtake fortified positions. The final battle scene shows the reverse, with the heroes defending a bridge knowing they cannot succeed against the overwhelming force approaching. Speilberg makes sure neither scenerio seems very appealing. War is not fun, win or lose.
The acting is top notch. Hanks in particular delivers another oscar-worthy performance. I think Matt Damon was a little weak as Ryan. Although his part is small he's a bit too pretty and cardboard for it. Otherwise the cast is excellent.
The script is subtle yet powerful. The question is not 'why did they save Ryan?' but 'why did they save us?' The American soldier in World War Two was not a professional. He was the common man who patriotically went off to war for his country. The movie examines why these men gave up so much for us, for fellow citizens they didn't know. Speilberg's answer is they did so because it was their duty. He obviously feels as if this reasoning is enough, as he lays the patriotic melodrama on very thick at the end of the movie. But I don't think there's anything wrong with a little dose of patriotism every now and then.
Whether you agree with Speilberg's message or not is up to you, but there's no question he made one heck of a movie.",993600000,3,1438,4.643137254901961
1242839,5,B00000K3AM,"Saving Pvt. Ryan was the best picture of the year hands down. Anytime someone takes a much traveled genre like the war movie, and reinvents and reinvigorates it while raising the bar for future films it is exceptional. Spielberg did that here. No one has ever depicted combat quite so effectively, and Pvt. Ryan is now the standard. Even the negative reviewers concede the Omaha Beach opening is stunning and excellent. But, I think the assault on the machine gun and the closing! battle just as intense and vivid.

Pro War? Please. I don't think Spielberg's purpose was to be pro OR anti-war. I think his purpose was to honor the sacrifice of the men who fought the war. Period. But within that context, I think the death of Wayne (the Medic) is as horrifying in its unexceptionalness as anything I've seen on screen. This is war, overdosing with morphine a friend who is bleeding to death with a shredded liver. Just like that. And Mellish's hand to hand fight and vain attempt at stopping his own killing after being overpowered...this is pro-War stuff? Not to mention, that at the end of the movie nearly everyone in the squad has been killed.

The idea that Spielberg was glorifying Americans at the expense of everyone else is nonsense. This movie wasn't about Stalingrad & the Eastern Front. It wasn't about the entire operation of Overlord. It wasn't about the entire scope of the Allied effort. It was about one squad of Rangers landing on Omaha and !then getting a strange assignment. Period.

That such a mission never happened? So what? That there was no plot? That IS the plot. The mission. Works for me.

One quick comment about the idea of cliched characters etc. Who do these people think fought the war? It was wise guys from NY, hillbillies from W. Virginia, hispanics from S.California, southerners, hobos, college men etc. How in hell else are you supposed to show them? AND, the military of WWII was not integrated, in case you didn't know.

As to the reality of the ending battle. First, when the Sgt. says ""something good coming from this mess"" I don't think he meant all of WWII. I think he meant the mess of this mission and the men they had lost now & everywhere. Second, the Germans are attacking the town, Miller & the Airborne defending. Door-to-door street fighting is the most casualty-intensive fighting possible, and the advantage is usually always with the defenders. That's why soldiers hate it. S!o they had a chance and they had a plan....ultimately to retreat & blow the bridge. If you think this is too far fetched, you should read Ambrose's Citizen Soldiers etc. and find out just how incredible small unit actions have been. Many are unbelievable.

And what were Miller & his squad to do when Ryan refused to leave? Say ""tough luck 101st, we're outta here"". Maybe. But I think they would have stayed & fought. Just read about the Rangers who scaled the cliffs on D-Day. Courage was a common currency in those days.

As to the acting, characters etc. I thought they were fine. There were no false heroics to my mind. I believe they wanted to honor these men and they played it straight. Hanks was believable to me portraying a school teacher who is now a leader of men and his scene where he does the awful math of the men he's lost and the rationale he uses to live with the fact says it all. He seemed to me an average man having to do impossible, horrible things and wo! ndering what it is doing to him.

The movie is about suiting-up, showing-up and getting-on-with-it. It is about the everyday heroism of doing the dirty job and trying to survive.

Was the movie flawless? No. I would have had Ryan tell a better story to Miller than the somewhat stupid and cruel one he told. And, for that fact I didn't get the point of Wayne's story about his mother. The German shooting Miller and Upham shooting the German was somewhat problematic (emotionally satisfying, but empty. If the lesson is mercy will get you killed, by that logic, he should have shot them all)....but these are minor quibbles in a great effort.

What about Spielberg? Spielberg is a brilliant and clever director. Too clever? Sometimes. But I liked most of his touches and flourishes. I liked the sniper seeing the other sniper shooting at him. I like the wall coming down & the standoff. I liked the tank rolling up on Miller blowing up by a seeming gunshot. I didn't mind !the bit of deception at the opening & closing of the film because by the time it ended I was moved by the sentiment. I thought the opening & closing battles were magnificent. I like his compositions. I thought all the combat throughout had a genuine feel never depicted as accurately before. His camerawork & direction was continuously inventive. I thought death was shown without glamor. The courage as that mustered up and brought to bear by ordinary men. Enough.

I could go on, but what's the point? If you are nitpicking this movie you have missed the experience. And it WAS an experience (especially on the big screen) that was exceptional for eye, ear and emotions. If you were not moved, so be it. I found it a beautiful tribute to the fathers and grandfathers who did what they had to do. And it came as close as anyone has been able to convey to an audience the horrors they had to endure.

It isn't a documentary, and it isn't a history. It's a movie. But a first rate! movie in all departments.",993427200,4,5393,4.594594594594595

The storyline is too linear. Good effects and realistic portrayal of war details should not compromise on a good storyline.

1242841,5,B00000K3AM,"""Saving Private Ryan"" tells the story of a United States Army captain (played by Tom Hanks) who, during World War II, is sent on a special mission in Europe: he and his team are to find and bring home a young soldier named Private Ryan. Ryan's brothers have been killed fighting the war, making him the last surviving son in the family; the U.S. government thus wants him pulled out of the combat zone.
Unlike some other war films, SPR includes no love story subplots; this is all about men at war. The combat scenes are brutally intense and graphic. But the violence is never gratuitous or glamorized. Rather, the violent scenes play like a documentary whose maker is intent on showing the terror and pain of war.
Steven Spielberg directs an excellent ensemble cast. Hanks brings a quiet, anguished dignity to his role as Captain Miller. The rest of the cast does equally admirable work.
The quest of Captain Miller and his squad involves both an internal and external struggle; they must fight enemy troops while struggling to stay in touch with their own humanity. The film raises such issues as loyalty, duty, the treatment of enemy prisoners, and the value of a single life in the midst of overwhelming death.
While the film clearly empathizes with Hanks' American soldiers, it does not demonize the Germans, and does not indulge in jingoistic imagery or rhetoric. In the end, ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a well-made film that is often disturbing, often moving, but always attentive to high human cost of war.",991612800,37,1511,4.793103448275862

But I can tell you if I like a film or not and why.  A lot of folks feel that this may be the one of the best WWII films ever.  I agree that it may be the one of the best to date in the technical sense, using up-to-date, groundbreaking film and audio techniques to really entrench you in the battle scenes.  And I agree that the first war scene on Omaha Beach on D-Day was extremely effective and emotional, capturing the utter frustration, fear and horror of the men involved.  And I think the casting was great and the acting was well done.  But for some reason it did not give me the payoff that I was expecting.  I had a difficult time becoming emotionally attached to the characters.  When Tom Hanks (Miller) died at the end I didn't even feel bad - I knew it was just a movie.  It did keep my attention the entire time and I did ""enjoy"" it if it is okay to say that.  But the best ever?  I'm not so sure.

1242843,5,B00000K3AM,"In a few words, this picture was robbed of its 1998 Oscar for best picture. It is, undoubtedly, a masterpiece of modern film, and deserves all the praise it has received. What I like most about this film is not the gut-wrenching realism, or the way the film transports you back in time, but the way it leaves you feeling at the end. My mind was numb as the fluttering American flag faded out at the end and the credits rolled. Never before had such a harrowing portrayal of war been shown to me. I didn't feel like I had just seen a movie, I felt like I had lived through an experience.
Part of what makes the such a great war film is its brutality. The gripping battle scene in the beginning is so real that to this day my adrenaline rushes when I see it. The movie does an excellent job of making you feel a part of the conflict. You are alongside Capt. Miller (Tom Hanks) and his men, and you never know who is going to be the next to die. The feeling of anxiety never leaves you as this film goes on. Spielberg never lets your mind wander. Your eyes are glued to the screen, expecting a German to pop out of the bushes or rubble at any moment.
What makes this quite possibly the greatest war film of all time is how Spielberg brings you into the mind of the characters in this movie. You see them struggle emotionally, weep, and fight for their lives, and you believe in them, because you know that there were soldiers just like this and in situations just like this in the real war.
I recommend everyone see it, because it is a harsh reminder of what price was paid for our freedom, and it shows how the war was really fought. I developed a newfound respect for our veterans as a result.

From the explicit bloodshed and graphic violence of Normandy, to the casual grousing of the enlisted men, to Ambrose's band of brothers mentality that clearly emerges, one can't help but admire this generation and the deft handling of the topic by Speilberg. Small, overwhelming scenes include Ryan's mother collapsing on the porch upon the appearence of her minister bearing obviously terrible news and George Marshall's somber reading of Abraham Lincoln's letter to another war mother, eighty years earlier. As Captain John Miller, Tom Hanks' mission is the basis for the film, to save the one survising brother of the decimated Ryan family, a mission both simple yet daunting. And as great as Tom Hanks filled this role, my helmet goes out to Ted Sizemore for his ""we're in business!"" gung ho attitude and skills.
Miller may have died due to his own humanity in sparing a German prisoner. Private Ryan had to be haunted by Captain Miller's dying whisper, ""Earn this!"" When Ryan, fifty years later, turns to his wife and pleads: ""Tell me I've lived a good life,"" my eyes well with tears of respect and admiration for all concerned with the real and imagined Private Ryans.

1242845,5,B00000K3AM,"As I sat through the first 30 minutes of both movies I decided to write, not about the actual movie, however but the sound quality and differences.  You will be able to read about the movie from other reviewers, but for the record, it was an exsquisite and moving film.  I just recently got the DTS version of the movie and I have to say the sound quality is more superior in comparison from DTS and Dolby Digital.  Needless to say, both are incredible sounding, however the DTS, I feel gives more depth to the sound environment around you.  Not only that, but the LFE of the movie is more resonant in the DTS version.  The Dolby Digital version gives more of a precise, pinpoint sound in each of the speakers, however the DTS version gives more of a 360 degree feel to the sound, blending the sounds from one speaker to the other.  In the DTS you are able to hear more of the gun shots especially from distant shots.  Best example of this is comparing the portion of the movie right after the first big fight.  When Captain Miller opens his canteen to take a drink of water, and a little bit before that exact scene,  you'll be able to hear gunshots clearer in the DTS version against the DD version.  Ambiant sounds are more clear in general and enveloping in the DTS.
Now, however with the improvement in sound comes the drawback of the lack of the featurette ""Into the Beach.""  It is a big loss to the DVD, however when you sit to debate whether you want better sound or one more feature on the DVD is up to you.  Eitherway, with both the DTS and Dolby Digital version of the movie, you can't go wrong.  You just have to decide which you would prefer.  For those audiophiles, I strongly suggest DTS and whoever else has a DTS capable sound system, I strongly suggest that copy of the movie.

1242847,5,B00000K3AM,"I'm not a firm advocate of war and neither is this film--as it should be.
However, America's involvement in this war is one of the reasons that I am alive.  My mother is American and my father is Belgian and they would never have met if Germany still occupied Belgium today.  There are still some regions in Belgium today (especially the Ardennes) where people are so grateful for being freed from Germany's occupation that they can't help themselves in expressing it.  In fact, once, I recall that my family and I were overheard speaking English and it was quickly found out by the owner that we were American.  Our meal was free as a result despite our protestation.
My point?  It is often amazing that some people treat World War II as an event in history as opposed to great sacrifices made to prevent evil.  Willing or not, for those who fought, I send my deepest respect to the utter, living hell they must have gone through.  There is only one place that film could not have possibly have entered...and that is the minds of those individuals...and it's the only fault that a film could not possibly overcome as it has exceeded in all other areas.  And by no means am I belittling any war that has occurred in the past, but despite the selfishness of it, this one means more to me because I am alive to write about it.
When I was very young, I participated in a memorial service on the beaches of Normandy.  I was chosen because it seemed fitting to those holding the memorial that someone of Belgian and American blood deliver the wreath to the front.  I barely remember it, but my parents remember it quite vividly.
Do yourself a favor and visit Normandy one day...the graves are sobering, and the concrete bunkers are chilling.  Some of us build buildings for offices; those bunkers were built to bring death down below.
Let's remember the distinction that we should build life now and cherish it.  Let's remember the horrors that may occur if we do not do so.
My only regret is that my words are only a pitiful shadow of what I wish to express.  Please watch the movie and understand that we can't look at someone and call them brave or cowardly.  We should look at them and say, ""These are human beings.""  And no human being deserves that treatment...ever.",989884800,2,2267,4.535626535626536
1242848,2,B00000K3AM,"I must say that both times I have seen ""Saving Private Ryan,"" I was overwhelmed by the images flung at the viewers during the opening minutes of the film.  Janusz Kaminski has set the standard in action sequence photography here (imitated in, recently, in ""Hannibal"" and ""Pearl Harbor,"" to name a few), and the gut-wrenching, blood curdling  screams that waft out of the speakers are harrowing to say the least.  However, with that final shot of the beach, and then a fade out, the movie devolves into a sputtering, clich&eacute; ridden trip through the histrionics of war movies that have basically undercut everything the GIs in ""Ryan"" fought to preserve, a better world for their children.  Full of the same war movie clich&eacute;s that have hindered films about World War II's portrayal on film since before the war was over (watch ""They Were Expendable"" to see what I mean), ""Saving Private Ryan"" presents the viewer with an amalgam of cardboard characters and chest-thumping patriotism that is frankly sickening.  It's really too bad that Spielberg had to get it so right on Normandy's beaches because, for the rest of the movie, he got it so wrong.  I think the most appalling thing about the existence of this film is the assertion, by so many people, that it is ""the best war movie ever made.""  Obviously these people have never seen ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" or ""12 O'clock High"" or ""Midnight Clear.""  If you love ""Ryan,"" watch those films, then watch ""Ryan"" again.

1242850,5,B00000K3AM,"Greatest war movie of all time, I'd say. Having scanned dozens of amazon customer reviews, reviews much better than mine would be, it seems interesting instead to focus tightly on a few criticisms of others' by way of review. So here is a ""review of the reviews"".

1. The beach. Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) reaches the beach sopping wet but his clothes are dry when the bangalores clear a path through the minefield. There was a several hours delay from hitting to taking Omaha Beach. Spielberg compresses hours into minutes.

2. Air cover. Significant air cover usually stops at a beach. It's too close to risk kills from friendly fire.

3. The machine gun nest. Why did Miller bother, why was the nest frontally assaulted rather than flanked, and how could a mere half-squad of Rangers even survive such an assault?

In a word, surprise. It takes a few crucial seconds to collect your wits, grab your helmet, chamber your rounds, and start delivering return fire in any ambush. Meantime grenades are heaving in at you - if you're still alive. As the Rangers assault the nest, the Brooklyner Reiben has a thirty-caliber Browning assault rifle and been ordered to set up a ""base of fire"". If you've never been fired at by a thirty-caliber machine gun set on automatic at close range, you may just not realize how really distracting something like that can be. Even *behind* sand bags. Even a city block away.

Next, mines and patrols. Machine gun nests are melancholy unhappy places. Good ones typically are surrounded by unpleasant anti-personnel mines, making flanking a machine gun nest unhealthy. And enemy patrols periodically stroll around taking the air, so waiting around to ambush the bad guys, or waiting for night to fall, is a questionable judgment call.

The math goes thus: Seven guys, one (basically) a noncombatant and another a medic, leaves five guys. The platoon sergeant sits out the ambush (so whatever happens there will be one good fighter left to keep looking for Private Ryan) leaving four guys. Now we have one guy set up a base of fire, and that leaves three guys to ambush the machine gun nest - Miller, Mellish, and Jackson their sniper. Not enough. So the medic gets called in for moving target duty and dies horribly.

Miller's reasons for assaulting the nest made sense. He got lucky to be unspotted. The next US patrol very likely would not be so lucky. Bad guys with nasty weapons were all over northern France in those days, and the essence of being a squad leader in that scenario is hit and run before you're pinned down and pounded. What did not make sense to me in Miller's assault was neglecting to use his sniper Jackson to pick off the German machine gun crew once they started opening fire. Nor did not opening up with long-range grenade throws make sense to me.

4. Final small unit action at Ramelle. You're the commander of a heavily armored recon element sent to take a vital bridge. You've got no air cover and no time. Your predecessors have had their pants thrashed by a small arms unit that was there, a unit that to your knowledge has not been reinforced - just some shell-shocked guys low on ammo who basically are cut off.

My first guarantee is you are unlikely to play it safe and send in your infantry to get chewed up piecemeal. Remember, this is your unit. These are your men. You're very likely understrength without reinforcements as every other unit commander is screaming for them. Street fighting is as bad as it gets, as the German Sixth Army discovered in Stalingrad when they were losing 20,000 men a week (yes, that's right, an entire division) in this same kind of fighting.

My second guarantee is you're confident of crushing a cut-off small arms unit. So what's your best approach with four tanks, a 20 mm cannon, several halftracks, and your infantry company that's likely been forced-marching? You know the enemy can't take out your two Tiger tanks with direct fire so you give orders to your infantry to stay close to the tanks to protect them. Then you simply take your chances. One street or the other is what it boils down to. The sooner you get the bridge the better. Go go go. If you're the commander on the spot, what other options do you have? Give your orders. Pray. Watch your set-piece battle vanish.

My one critique of Spielberg's handling of this small unit action at Ramelle is this: the German panzers would have been sure to blast holes through the buildings along each side of the street before entering the street. They don't in this film even though that would be, and was, standard procedure in such a situation - just like the German tiger commander did before attempting to cross the bridge - ""Das haus auf zwei hundert meter, elf uhr!""

If anyone knows what the SS soldier says to Mellish as he knifes him through the heart, please comment, and thank you.",987638400,7,4852,4.668618266978923
1242851,4,B00000K3AM,"The US government orders a group of soldiers to venture into enemy territory to find a lost comrade.  No, APOCALYPSE NOW it isn't.  The movie is less an anti-war statement than a rather banal testimonial of US war efforts, complete with sentimental speeches and a hackneyed, feel-good ending.  The movie does show the usual Spielberg technical prowess that is evident in the superb battle scenes, especially a stunning re-creation of the landing at Omaha beach.
The movie is sold in 2 DVD editions: Dolby Digital, and DTS.  The Dolby Digital edition contains a making-of featurette that mentions a real-life WWII story in which 4 brothers fought and died in the war; the story obviously inspired the movie.  The featurette also shows wonderful, rarely-seen clips of films Spielberg made as a child.  The DTS edition does not include this featurette.",987465600,2,849,5.071942446043166
1242852,5,B00000K3AM,"Spielberg just cannot be outdone in making incredible blockbuster movies and he definitely succeeded with Saving Private Ryan.  The emotional horror that is produced by this film is awesome.  He shows the violent reality of war through a captivating story, awesome cinematography and special effects, and great acting from Tom Hanks and Tom Sizemore.  It is violent and has drawn criticism for such, but as a teacher I know that the younger generation (or my generation for that matter) sometimes glamorize war.  We don't realize the brutality that it was  and Speilberg gave us a mind-blowing reminder!
How in the world such a movie lost to the extremely overrated and cheesy ""Shakespeare in Love"" is absolutely beyond reason.  Apparently, the academy award people were sleeping at the voting tables like they did when they voted ""Unforgiven"" and ""English Patient"" and later ""American Beauty"" as best pictures.

1242853,5,B00000K3AM,"""Saving Private Ryan"", along with ""Schindler's List"", is my personal favorite movie from director Steven Spielberg. The opening 25-minute D-Day sequence is one of moviedom's most memorable and realistic scenes ever. You feel very unsettled once it begins, and there's no letup to it. Tom Hanks gave, in my opinion, the best performance of his career as Captain John H. Miller. The screenplay is what I like best about this movie. There are only two war movies, so far, that have scared me and affected me the most: this film and ""All Quiet On The Western Front"". The images in both films linger on in my memory. When Steven Spielberg makes this kind of film, he does it with respect for the men who died in WW2, just like he did for the survivors of the Holocaust in ""Schindler's List"".",987033600,,786,4.621428571428571

Speilberg really takes the kid gloves off and with a frightening realistic look at the Omaha beach landing.  To give you an idea how realistic it is, I read that many veterans who saw this movie began having flashbacks.  This movie gives some good insight into the ordinary soldier and what they faced.  I'm not a real Hanks fan, but he was excellent in this movie.  The casting was great and believable.  One thing I did appreciate about this movie is that it kept in line with history.  It portrayed the battles and soldiers pretty accurately.  At least from what I have read.  Now, if you want the opposite of all this, see The Thin Red Line.  That movie will give you no historical value whatsoever.  For example:  The Japanese soldiers in WWII were fanatical, fearless, and brutal fighters.  Yet in this movie they are shown as cowering sheep that surrender immediately to the charging Americans.

Okay, it was good. I liked the first 25 minutes, 48 seconds of the film. But like most american made ww2 films, it spiraled down into being just another self righteous piece of hollywood fantasy. NOT counting all of the military errors, which were many, the movie was another good chance at a convincing ww2 movie gone down the toilet. The script was garbage, Tom Hanks couldn't even save the haze of terrible acting, and the fighting sequences were something i could have played out in a sandbox with a couple of toy tanks and some army men. How could anyone take this movie seriously? There is no way in hell that a german armored column would have disobeyed every know military tactic and gone into a village without first sending a reconnaisance patrol. Even if they were that dumb (these are eastern front veterans) the soldiers in the film suicidally run in front of waves of american bullets never taking defensive positions. Can anyone tell me what the devil that was about? That scene where four g.i.'s take out a tiger tank was ludicrous nonsense etc., etc.. Regular german soldiers were also made to look evil, all of them having shaved heads and being better off dead for no reason at the hands of the moral g.i.. I have an answer why the film was so unrealistic. IT MAKES US LOOK BETTER!!!! Frankly, I am tired of this. Too many american made ww2 films sacrifice reality to bring about the effect of the righteous, invincible, freedom loving g.i..

For the record, I've seen over 50 WWII movies.
Don't expect a jingoistic or patriotic story.  There's a lot of grayness in the characters and some of the Germans aren't necessarily evil people or noble.
Interesting, gritty and bloody war scenes.  Lots of the characters die so it isn't the typical movie where the heroes all come out alive and smiling.
Themes of duty, the needs of one person over many and even patriotism apply to this story.
TOP FIVE SCENES:
(1) Omaha Beach assault; a good 15 minutes and not at all like anything you have seen in the old WWII shows;
(2) the ending when a small group tries to distract a larger German unit in a French town;
(3) whether to spare the life of a begging German soldier;
(4) Tom Hanks telling them about his true occupation which was a big mystery; and

1242860,5,B00000K3AM,"I've read hundreds of movie reviews over the years, but I just read the best of the best: Doug Thomas' short, direct essay on Saving Private Ryan.  Here's why: First, he helped me finally understand why Spielberg started the movie with the graveyard-at-Normandy scene.  Knowing about the director's first home movie reveals to me something of the director as a human being.
Second, the word kinetic says so much about why the characters acted as they did, some would say stereotypically -- because there are rare times when events hurl YOU in directions you never wanted, or even dreamed you'd go, in your fiercest nightmare. There, trying to be yourself is a dangerous and very painful exercise.  Witness the future of the interpreter after his performance in the field.
Third, this film so eloquently demonstrated what a thousand Memorial Day speeches could never say: that as a nation of individuals, we, individually, owe so very much to both those who fought and those who died, to help slay the most hideous monster that threatened our collective existence in a hundred generations.  And Doug said it so simply -- how we SHOULD feel about the past and this event.
When one reads the complete history of that war, one wishes that a film like Saving Private Ryan could be made about a people who overwhelmingly suffered the most casualties, killed the most Germans, and pushed the monster back 2,200 miles into its hell hole and killed it -- the Russians.  When that film is made I think we will truly understand how we should feel about that unfortunate, misunderstood nation.  If the Russians seem they feel unappreciated by Americans, it is because they are.  When I left the theater after viewing this film, it took me several days to work through all the emotions of fear, pain, loss, disgust, and especially helplessness in the face of overwhelming disaster and imminent death, that no other film before or since has stirred inside me.  Because of this, I feel Saving Private Ryan, as a cinematic work of art, is in a class by itself.

1242862,3,B00000K3AM,"First, I thought this movie had some of the most impressive scenes ever in a war movie. However, after reading several WW2 history books, I found this movie to be extraordinarily inaccurate. D-Day was a symbolic turning point, but the outcome against Germany had already been determined. I agree 100% with the reader from Vancouver on March 15. ""Ost"" troopers, children, and crippled vets were manning the coast defenses and the German Army was already decimated from its Eastern Front Campaign. I guess this realism would have confused the audience. The most horrific battle of WW2 was Stalingrad, but that has still not been addressed properly by mainstream Hollywood.

1242863,5,B00000K3AM,"SAVING PRIVATE RYAN stars Hollywood actors: Tom Hanks (Cast Away), Matt Damon (Dogma), Tom Sizemore (Red Planet, Pearl Harbor), Edward Burns (15 Minutes) and Giovoni Ribisi (Gone in 60 Seconds).  This film is also directed by the one and only Steven Spielberg (Schindler's List, Jurassic Park, Jaws).  What makes this film so amazing is how memorable and realistic it really was.  It should have no doubt, hands down, no questions asked; won BEST PICTURE in 1998!!  At least Spielberg shined with the BEST DIRECTOR award!  The opening scene on Omaha Beach really pulls you into the battles or World War II.  There are even times when you almost want to look away!  This film's high flying bullets, explosions, desposed bodies and realism of what WWII was like really sets a standard for other war films to look up to.  THE THIN RED LINE was a poor excuse for a war film.  They took big actors like: Nick Nolte, George Clooney (who was only in the film for maybe a minute), Sean Penn, and Woody Harrelson and rolled into something trying to copy SAVING PRIVATE RYAN- but it couldn't... No way!  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is more realistic and more emotional.  All the performances and filming are fantastic- it's just phenomenal filmaking that all homes should have.  Whether you buy it on DVD or VHS, it still gives you that feeling, where you really start looking back at all the men who risked their lives and died on the battlefields, for us, for freedom.  Imagine all your family being siblings dying in the war, your mother getting all the telegrams saying ""your child is dead, we're sorry"" in one day!  You were the only one left and eight daring, tired men go across all the battles and all the dangerous situations to rescue- you.  Only you.  What a debt you'd owe them.  This is a true epic that sticks its story, doesn't have holds, and keeps that drama-war action/adventure flowing.  You can never look back at World War II the same way again.  Thank you Steven Spielberg for showing us how much we take for granted, and who we owe so much to.

1242864,3,B00000K3AM,"Th battlescenes are breathtaking.  But that's it.  the movie lacksrealism.  Germany had mostly second rate and foreign conscripts guarding the walls of Normandy.  By 1944, the Wehrmacht had been bled white.  The US and British troops had an incredible numerical superiority.  the movie shows the german troops as these wel equiped soldier where in fact most units were a ragtag of blended units with a few veterans left in hem
Also the last battle turns the movie into Rambo.  If indeed they had been faced with tanks.  The germans would have never let the tanks advance into ruins and be easy prey to close up ambushes.  the tiger's 88mm main gun would have obliterated the defenders fron long range.
Finally, that charge on the machine gun nest where Giovanni Ribisi dies is a bit laughable.  The whole platoon would have probably died during a head on charge in a real settings.  The germans had in a place a fearsome MG-42 with an over 2000 rounds/minute rate of fire.  they would have been cut to pieces in no time.

1242865,4,B00000K3AM,"Like everyone else who saw the film I was very impressed with the first 20 or so minute's of 'Saving Private Ryan', apart from the silly opening with the old guy in the cemetery. It certainly did offer a view of combat that no other movie, of any period, has. It is probably the most re-watched and talked-about section of the entire film, and for good reason too. Bullets and shrapnel have never flown so realistically on a screen. Bodies have never been pulverised and destroyed so convincingly in any other film, about any other war, as far as I can remember. If one thing is to be learned by future filmmakers, it should be to emulate or attain the same realism of combat that 'Saving Private Ryan' put on the screen. There are very few heroes in war and this is reflected well in the 20 min Omaha beach section of the movie. A large number of the soldiers are cowering or dead. The few who are trying to rally their men do so mostly in vain and the slow movement across the beach to the ""Dog Green"" sector is the result.

After this explosive section, everything settles down and we get to the meat of the film.

Following the death of Ryan's brothers, an order goes out from U.S. headquarters to rescue and return safely, the last remaining brother, James. Unfortunately, this is put across in one of the most cliche ridden scenes that I've seen in ages. It's really typical of Spielberg's attempts to pull the audience heart strings, but they never really work and usually let his films down. Also, this basic premise of the movie is a nonsense in itself. There is no way in the world that an army would send a squad of men into enemy held territory to rescue one man, especially given the circumstances of the first few days after D-Day and doubly so because he is a private. However, once you are over that you can allow the film to take it's course.

The squad of men start out into their mission and squabble and argue over the order to do so and quite rightly too, which goes some way to ease the unrealistic nature of the film's premise. The banter is very good and entertaining as the men wander, somewhat without fear of German activity through the occupied French county side! As they continue their journey they come across different situations that threaten them and their mission to save Ryan.

One of the first obstacles to their mission takes place in a superb set piece, in a shattered French town, where a German sniper has Captain Miller's (Tom Hanks) squad pinned down. He dispatches the squad's first casualty and it's handled marvelously... right up until Spielberg has the US sniper shoot him through the eye piece of his Gewher 43 rifle, that is. Unfortunately, It's this type of nonsense that knocks a few notches off of the overall score for 'Saving Private Ryan'. A simple shot through the head or chest would have sufficed and the squad could have moved on about their business, without the inducement of groans.

Likewise, the botched attack on the MG42 outpost a little later, suffers from some incredulous activity. No officer worth his salt or with the experience that Hanks' Captain Miller is supposed to have (he's been involved in the war since Kasserine) would have ordered a frontal attack of such an obstacle, without properly thinking out or analysing the situation first. How long would it have taken to scout around behind the outpost to make sure that there wasn't a German regiment somewhere beyond it? Or picking off the German's in the MG42 nest with the sniper? Both situations would have lessened the chances of casualties and would have been more beneficial to the squads central mission, into the bargain. In the ensuing assault, however, another squad member is killed, in a scene, which is probably the most shocking of them all, including the spectacular Omaha Beach scene, as we witness a graphic and harrowing death, presented in a gritty realism that echoes in your head for days afterwards, like so much of the film, it has to be said.

There are more parts that grate however and unnecessarily so too. The German soldiers never seem quite human. They are roughly the same, typical, dummkopf Nazis that Spielberg has been putting on the screen since 'Raiders of the lost Ark', which is a bit of a shame really, as the film is quite polished in many other areas. Also, Speilberg's pushing of Holocaust related messages are irritating in the extreme. I can't help thinking that the death of Private Mellish (Adam Goldberg) served a thinly veiled metaphor for the Nazi extermination of Jews.

Small inconsistencies in realism and how the German enemy acts, also deflates the whole project and knocks off that last star. For instance, every German soldier has a shaved head, which is more reminiscent of Russian conscripts than the Wehrmacht. One senses that this is another Spielbergian attempt to equate the German's of the 1940's with the neo-nazi skinheads of today. It's just too heavy handed to let go.

The final set piece of the movie, sees the newly found Private Ryan, his comrades and Hanks' squad, team up to hold a bridge against the oncoming Germans. This noisy battle scene, which filmed with great skill, also exhibits some serious flaws. It's first and foremost, a situation that would have been far more historically correct, if the tactics were switched, with a small band of German soldiers holding the bridge against supeior U.S. forces. Such was the balance of the day. But as it stands, it's a realistic enough sequence, if you allow for the stupid German tactic of driving their armor down a narrow street right into an obvious ambush. Remember, the 101st soldiers guarding the bridge had just had their ass's kicked previous to Ryan being found by Miller's squad, so the Waffen SS soldiers tasked with securing Ramelle would have known of their presence. A few moments of shelling from the Tiger's 88's would have not gone amiss, and the tower from which the U.S. sniper was stationed (and from where he would eliminate a large portion of those silly Germans) would have been the first building shelled. Of course, we won't mention the fact that the Tiger tanks or the 2nd Waffen-SS Division troops in question, were no where the area at the time. Historically, the 2nd Waffen SS Division ""Das Reich"", were still on their way to Normandy. These flaws in the final battle sequence, while annoying, are still possible to forgive, as there is a fair share of excitement to be had. Speilberg's skill as a director of action sequences is on fine display.

Lastly, the end of the movie offers the final let down. We go back to the old guy in the cemetery who we saw at the very beginning of the film, for a soppy sequence about ""being a good man"", etc. The film really could have done without this framing device as it subtracts from the movie, instead of adding to it. The movie really should start with the landing craft approaching the beach and end with captain Miller saying ""earn this"".

All in all though, 'Saving Private Ryan' does have an awful lot to recommend it. Which is why I am giving it four stars. The acting for the most part is well done, with Hanks being surprisingly good as Captain Miller. I personally think he's one of the most overrated actors in Hollywood, but he does have his moments. The lights are stolen by Tom Sizemore, however, who is watchable in every scene and superb as the ever faithful Sargent Horvath.

I'm probably being a little too hard on 'Saving Private Ryan', if the truth be known, which perhaps stems from my interest in the period the film would have earned five stars (not a score I give that often), if the above things (and some others) were corrected...which really isn't that much to ask from a movie that purports to be historically correct.",984614400,12,7772,4.673976608187134
1242866,4,B00000K3AM,"Saving Private Ryan is a very good film - its just not a great one. As it has one fatal flaw - the middle of the film.
The opening 40 minutes is perhaps the greatest war sequence put on film showing the full horror of the D-Day landings. Similarly the end sequence where they defend the bridge is horrifically realistic. There can be no doubt about their power. Many people will no doubt give the films 5* on this basis. If the film had consisted purely of these two parts I would have no doubt given it 5* as well.
However, the film has a very weak middle containing very little of note except some deeply stereotyped characters wandering about looking for Ryan. Consider Tom Sizemores loyal Sergeant, Adam Goldberg's token Jew, Barry Pepper's bible thumping sniper, Giovanni Ribisi's gushing one dimensional medic not to mention the rest.
I'm also annoyed that Spielberg also returns to his vision of pantomimesque Nazis - one dimensional, inscrutably evil with no vestiges of humanity and completely lacking in even basic human qualities. What made Schindlers List such a deeply moving film for me was that for once Speilberg portrayed the Nazi's for what they were - men - men with weaknesses just like you or I who did unspeakable things - it is this which truly relays the real horrors of what they did - that they were men, just like us, not pantomimesque villains. And that made it powerful. Witness Ralph Fiennes ' Camp Commandant taking the young boy in and letting him tend his house only to later callously shoot him for sport.
I prefer The Thin Red Line which was released around the same time as SPR - anyone buying this DVD should definitely buy it as they will find much in common but a far greater emotional experience. It is a superior film albeit lacking in the shock value of the D-Day landing sequence in SPR.
The good news is that the overall package of extras on this DVD is excellent and should keep enthusiasts of commentaries etc happy.
Overall a good film, just not a great one.",983923200,4,2005,4.587743732590529

""Saving Private Ryan"" embodies the esssence of patriotism.  It's message is so clear that any junior/senior high school youngster will understand: we owe so much to those who've gone before, whether they fought ashore at Omaha Beach, or on the fields at Gettysburg, or...
While the film is a sweeping historical (patriotic) epic, it includes many subplots dealing with the meaning of war, sacrifice, honor, courage, fear, death, family, etc.  The film's producers and writers effectively develop the personalities of the small band of GI's sent to find Ryan, so that by the film's climax we're on the edge of our chairs, concerned about who among the group will survive and just what their fate means to us viewing Steven Speilberg's film some fifty-five years later.
While both ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""The Thin Red Line"" are truly great (war) films, ""Ryan"" seems more coherent, with characters fully developed, their personalities sharply delinated.  The two films compliment each other and belong in every collection of World War II movies.

1242872,5,B00000K3AM,"If you start off with the clear understanding that this movie was meant to be a patriotic tribute to the men, in this specific case, the US soldiers that landed at Omaha Beach, and that Spielberg is going to use his prodiguous talents to make us feel for them - then you won't be disappointed. If you think that you are going to see a documentary and wish to remain emotionally unattached and unaffected by what you're watching - then skip this. The only thing documentary-like about 'Saving Private Ryan' is the realism of the landing scenes. Emotional? If you've ever wondered what battle is like, here's your answer. The violent, graphic scenes showing gore, blood, confusion, immobilizing fear, waste, chaos, heroics and the tremendous sense of relief and uncontrollable shaking from release are there, not because it's a 'War' and  an 'Action' movie, but because it's REAL. Get the picture - this is how war looks and feels. Brrr, chills.
Although paying tribute to those men who went ashore in '44, it's also a strong anti-war movie, and it's not surprising that so many vets. have spoken out in praise of the movie, nobody is more anti-war than ex-warriors. The movie does justice to the randomness and suddeness of the violence. Bad luck, Karma, and certainly stupidity are factors. Private Caparzzo, well meaning, trying to help that little French girl, was nevertheless stupid. Most soldiers would sympathize, certainly as he bled to death in the rain, but there would not be much empathy. You do not step out in the open in a fire fight, or even if there is only a hint of the enemy.
Enjoy may be too strong a word, but watch this movie just the same and if by chance you know somebody who was there, then simply, thank them.",982022400,4,1736,4.691803278688525
1242873,4,B00000K3AM,"The opening scene of Stephen Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan which depicts the Allied Forces D-Day invasion of Normandy Beach is more graphic, harrowing, stunning, intense, spectacular, realistic and amazing war scene ever film.  We feel as if we are plopped right in the middle of the action.  We hear the ping of bullets on metal, the deafening noises, the blood, the gore, and the stink of death and destruction.  Through the eyes and ears of Tom Hanks' Capt. John Miller, we get a sense of the struggle and will to survive under such unthinkable conditions.  The movie's ending, while not as good as the opening scene is still stunning and brilliant.  Those two scenes are among the finest Mr. Spielberg has ever filmed.  The problem with the film is that between those two bookends, the middle part of the movie drags on.  After D-Day, Capt. Miller's troop is sent on a mission to find a Private Ryan who three brothers have been killed in battle.  He is the last male member of his family and if he is killed, his family name will die with him.  Capt. Miller and his men are of course ticked off that they have to risk their lives for this faceless grunt.  We follow the troop through the French countryside and the obvious confrontations come up.  Mr. Hanks always adds class to anything he does and his subtle and heroic portrayal of Miller saves the middle section from sinking completely into cliche territory. Edward Burns appears in his first movie that he didn't direct and is serviceable as an angry solider, Tom Sizemore is good as Sgt. Horvath and Adam Goldberg deserves mention for his part.  Despite the boring middle section, the DVD brings all the majesty and glory of the opening war scenes top an almost theater like quality and it is still a very good film.",980985600,3,1780,4.651757188498403
1242874,5,B00000K3AM,"First, I must admit to a bias: my father was a combat veteran of WW2 and I grew up in non-com military housing. I am also a former high school English teacher like John Miller, the captain of the unit who seeks out Private Ryan. So it shouldn't surprise if I say that this is the finest film of war ever made, bar none. Spielberg and company have created a new, elusive standard for all combat films to follow. I hope it indeed sets a precedent. What makes this film so good? The Amazon.com reviewer has already said much but let me add an anecdote and some parting comments. I saw this in a theatre in Honolulu at a matinee showing. I counted only three others in the theater, one of whom was wearing a VFW beret and sitting in a wheelchair in the aisle near me. Although old he did not look beaten and kept something of his once craggy features. But he wept like a lost babe through scene after scene of this film and, afterward, when I talked to him, he told me that coming to see this film was one of the most difficult things he'd ever done. This, from a man who'd seen frontline action against the Nazis near Bastogne in the winter of 1944. Still, he was immensely glad and relieved to have seen it and said he would bring all his teenage grandchildren when they came to visit him the following week. The last scene of this film will leave you speechless and if you weren't already a patriot, it will have you humming the stars and stripes as you leave the theatre. But this is not a film that glorifies war and therein lies its supremely honest strength. It shows what happens to a small band of men united by a caring captain, superbly played by Hanks, who become heroes even though they remain reluctant warriors. It is fitting and altogether uplifting that their leader is a former schoolteacher. No seeking of paths to glory here; just getting home in one piece. My father once reminded me that a true hero seldom if ever finds the need to talk about his exploits. That is certainly true of Captain John Miller and Private Ryan in this film. This is one to buy, watch with your children or grandchildren, and cherish for years to come. Yes, the first half hour is visceral and shocking, leaving nothing to fancy, but it is ungratuitous violence coupled with soul-searching and even a bit of the sublime.

Sadly the special features are few and far between, but with a nearly 3-hour movie it would be difficult to fit it all on one DVD.

1242880,4,B00000K3AM,"I disliked many things about this movie, from parts of the plot to the sappy ending that simply sucked. An American flag at the beginning and an American flag at the end is not exactly the most original form of patriotism I have ever seen, while I am not born in the US and am grateful for USA's importance in the release of Europe (and the world), I doubt even Americans will find it the best of Spieberg's ideas. A smoother, more stylish approach would have been more interesting, after all, soldiers of many other nations (hey, even young enemy soldiers) fought in the same war and suffered and died the same way. Why end with a propaganda-looking-clich and a pretty weak last half-hour?
But that might be a matter of personal taste which is of no importance if I focus on the best aspect of this title: SPR has the merit of being the first WWII film to show the true reality of war. Almost any movie about WWII is far milder than ""Saving Private Ryan."" I remember feeling the discomfort of people when watching this movie, the audience didn't ""like it"", and people next to me were complaining how unpleasant it was, some kind of ""I can take it, but I wish I didn't have to see more of it"". It is visually disturbing. The sheer brutality of relentlessly violent and horrifying scenes goes on and on. Men froze in fear, cry like children, die, while commanders scream orders in the midst of thunderous explosions and torrential bullet fire.  Technically, the visuals are very good and the sound work is simply breathtaking, definitely essential to listen in DTS or Dolby Digital 5.1. You will miss a lot of the impact on VHS stereo. Chapter two is still a reference when it comes to digital sound.
""Saving Private Ryan"" is probably the best and most powerful war film, not because of its plot or actors, but simply because it's honest most of the time, showing us the true  face of death, blood, and suffering. Other ""war"" movies and even TV coverage of computer technology making destruction ""surgical"" and ""clean."" have led to the notion that war may not be hell after all.  Ryan eliminates any such distance between the audience and the reality of war, which is never surgical or clean, even today. To me at least, this movie's worth is based on its raw violence, the bloody, horrific nature of the conflict exposed with such realism.  This time we don't see war as glamorised as in other movies, there are no heroic or stylish deaths, no John Waynes.
SPR is far from perfect, but even if you don't like the plot, or even if you feel discomfort while watching it and know you won't feel so good when it's over, you should still watch it simply because it sometimes pretty close to showing the true side of war; War, which is still part of our civilization, and as such, cannot be ignored even if it doesn't mix so well with our everyday life...",978825600,4,2849,4.52621359223301
1242881,5,B00000K3AM,"I should start this review by saying that Saving Private Ryan is one of my favorite movies so I have a biased opinion.
I won't get into the specifics of the movie because many people before me have done a fantastic job of that.
What I loved about this movie is that it didn't make war look glamorous or desirable.  It showed how terrible war could be and the reality of what really happens.  After a huge battle or conflict you could actually see on the actors faces that they were scared and shaken.  Of course the down side for some people is there is very violent scenes that could offend some viewers.  The first 20 minutes of the invasion scene is brutal and very realistic.  The first time that I watched the first scenes it hit me kind of hard and I never realized what those brave men must have felt or went through.
The main story line involves the saving of one soldier who actually doesn't enter the movie until mid-stream.  What I love about Steven Speilbergs movies is that he lets you get to know the characters.  All of the actors do a great job and are very credible and act like soldiers.

1242883,2,B00000K3AM,"I love a good action flick, but what I hate is pretense.
If someone or something oozes too much sincerity, we suspect something else is going on. Often, but not always, those suspicions are correct.
Just who is glorifying war here? Spielberg is. His message is this: ""You want a war movie? I'LL SHOW YOU A WAR MOVIE!"".
Look at all the violence. Isn't is awful? Look at it again.  Hey, one more time. Wow. Nasty. Excellent. I can hardly take my eyes away!
And, so we don't feel guilty about our bloodlust, he does it all under the guise of it being a ""tribute"". In fact, Spielberg revels in the violence, and he takes us along for the ride.
If you doubt that, then ask yourself if you watch the movie for the aggressive stimulation it provides, or to really contemplate some of the horrors of WWII and the sacrifices ""our boys"" made. Most guys will watch repeated viewings for the action.
We're being seduced. The viewer from Ridgeway, Ohio, talked about Montgomery and Eisenhower ""and their blind, military cronies ... glorifying butchery and population control in the name of 'patriotism'.""
That's exactly what's happening here, only on film. How long before a different director wants to top it?
Oh, and why are Matt Damon's teeth so white?
Sarcasm aside, I agree with Dennis Littrell's review. Spielberg is at his best when he entertains us with luxurious action sequences, and stays away from questions of morality,  (regardless of Schindler's List, which is also deeply problematic).

1242884,5,B00000K3AM,"Being my favorite movie, I decided to read what others thought of this film.  Not surprisingly, I found a few negative comments.  These were the writings that I focused on.  After reading only about 100 of the 747 reviews of this film I felt it was time to respond.
This film is not for everyone.  It is violent, graphic, horrific, gut-wrenching, and, yes, patriotic.  Some find this type of patriotism distasteful, and I respect that as a decision that they have made.  However, I find that this film generates a feeling of respect for what ordinary men did in times of great tragedy.  Storming a beach, facing machine guns and mines was not an easy thing to do.  Yes, the 20 minute beach scene was short compared to the actual event, and, yes, it was not that easy in reality, but for movie-making (keeping the film under 24 hours long) it got its point across.  In the movie's shortened sequence the confusion, panic, courage, and pain shined through in breif, but, meaningful segments.
I also do not believe that the Germans were portrayed as evil.  After killing Melish, one Wermarcht soldier spares Upham's life.  Would someone purely evil do such a thing?  Of course the released German soldier is going back to fight with his countrymen.  It was a time of war.  Tragic and surprising things happened. I do not simply believe that the whole of the German Army is cast in a negative light by the actions of a few (for a truly riviting portrayl of German soldiers in WWII see Stalingrad).  American soldiers were capable of horrors, too, as seen after the American's took the beach-head and executed unarmed German soldiers.  These characters could have been German, Russian, Italian, Japanese, Canadian, Australian or British.  I venture to believe that the reactions would be the same, but Speilberg did not make a movie about them.  This movie is about American soldiers.
I did not see the American soldiers in the same light as others.  There were no John Wayne's here.  Capt. Miller is clearly shaken by his experiences in the war and, as detailed in his monologue following the storming of the machine gun-nest, he hopes that his wife will recognize him when he returns home.  I saw everyday men in unusual circumstances.  I saw men attempting to make rational decisions in irrational times.
I do not question the history of this movie.  Like all war movies, including The Thin Red Line and Platoon, there are liberties taken and truths changed.  It's not a history lesson that I take away from this movie.  It is a profound respect for men who made decisions and faced situations that I hope to never see in my lifetime.

1242886,5,B00000K3AM,"""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of those films that even if you haven't seen it, you've undoubtedly heard about it.  You have probably heard about the first 10 minutes being some of the most brutally realistic of all the movie footage attempting to show war.  Both this reputation and the rave reviews that the movie has received are completely justified in this reviewer's opinion.  The movie in general emphasizes the brutality of war, how people ""just like us"" had to go through hell, and how a lot of it was completely random and nonsensical.  For those of us lucky enough to not have to face warfare, this movie opens your eyes to the incredible fear and uncertainty that these men faced and how lucky we are that we did not happen to be born in the mid 1920's or earlier, or that we currently do not reside in countries that are undergoing such warfare.  It also makes you understand how lucky you are that these men were willing to give the ultimate sacrifice so that we can enjoy the life we do today.
The movie, as you probably know, starts out with the D-day invasion of Normandy, where thousands of American soldiers were pushed shipped to the shore of ""Omaha beach"" to face a seeming wall of bullets that cut through most of them killing them on the spot.  Spielberg's footage of this scene approximates to whatever degree possible, what a an American soldier would have seen as he tried desperately to wade through the dead bodies in the water to seek some limited shelter on the dunes.  There is no sense to the action that we see, only little clips of men being torn apart by metal in a very unglamorous way.  One soldier speaking to another one second would face a dead, mangled corpse the next.  There was no time for crying or thinking, one had to simply keep going despite whatever agony these men must have been feeling - the fear must have overridden this completely.
We follow Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks), as he makes his way to the dunes and somehow miraculously is able to breach the German machine guns mowing down Americans at a ridiculous rate.  Afterwards we see how the devastation that these men had to go through finally comes out in the uncontrollable crying after the fear has finally subsided.
Miller soon gets a special assignment that he questions and makes the viewer question, despite our initial acceptance.  A mother has lost three of her four sons in the war within the last week.  She will soon get three telegrams. ....  Despite the protestations from some of those around him, he decides to send a small squadron of men to go find the fourth son, and ferret him to safety so that his mother would not lose her last son to the war.  Her son being Private Ryan, and the Squadron chosen being Miller's.  Though initially we feel for the mother, through Miller's protestations and later those of his men, and eventually even Ryan himself, we come to the realization that this mission is more political or a personal issue for the general rather than something that coincides with the rest of the war effort. ....
The squadron is made up of a number of men who do not really stand out very much.  They come from different backgrounds, one Italian, one Jewish.  They have their own issues to deal with, such as the medic (Giovanni Ribisi)...  But for the most part they are fairly normal men with normal backgrounds.  The one character that stands out is that of Corporal Timothy E. Upham (Jeremy Davies), a translator plucked from the beach after all the reinforcements arrived.  Upham seems like he could have been a modern-day college student thrown back in time.  He has only touched a gun in a brief basic training and is so fearful about the possibility of actually seeing combat that he is almost useless.  Because of this, we can identify with him more than with any of the other soldiers who have been through the hell of Omaha Beach.
The DVD has an excellent 5.1 DD soundtrack that really puts you on the battlefield with lots of subwoofer and rear-channel usage.  The picture is similarly good, though you can tell that there's an intentional graininess to provoke a sort of newsreel quality to the film.  There are some special features, including cast and crew bios, trailers, production notes, a short speech by Steven Spielberg, and a making-of featurette.  The featurette is very good, including clips from the film, interviews with cast and crew, as well as historians like Stephan Ambrose.  Through these interviews, and especially through Ambrose, who's eloquent and moving oratory matches his literary talent, it really sinks in how amazing it was that men like those around us today, who had never held a gun before, suddenly were thrust into such inconceivable violence and chaos and did this willingly for the good of the country and the cause.

The fear on the faces of the men instantly transported me back to a cramped Blackhawk flying into an LZ in Panama. Once again, I felt the same terror of facing the ""elephant"" the men in the movie portrayed.  To those who know what I am talking about, I experienced the ""pucker factor"".  I made the mistake of taking a girlfriend with me and almost broke her hand because I was so caught up in the realism of the movie. The sounds of rounds hitting their target was all too real. The only thing that was missing was the acrid/sweet smell of death.
This is not just a great war movie, but it is an outstanding anti-war movie.  Seeing a young US soldier die, whether on Omaha Beach, Pork Chop Hill, Hue, Panama City, Kuwait or many of the other countless battlefields, is a site I pray no one's son will ever again have to experience war in their lives.

All of the actors fit their roles perfectly, and Tom Hanks is simplu put, amazing. The script keeps you listening to every single word uttered.

There is a white hazy glare which distorts the picture (flames have lines in them) in this section at the bunker atop Normandy beach. There is also the same white glare distortion at the end of the film where Oppen (Jeremy Davies) arrests the Germans.

1242892,5,B00000K3AM,"I think this was an overall great war movie. It is up there with ""The Longest day"" and ""Patton."" The way the beginning is shown (sort of jumpy, from the eyes of a soldier) is great. It really makes you feel like you were there. The sound effects, sets, etc. were all really really good as well.
The story/plot was good, and interesting. There wasn't a part of the movie where I was bored; even the parts of the movie where nothing was really happening had me sitting on the edge of my seat.
The characters are all believable, and the acting is very good. The cast was well chosen.
But I don't know whether or not it is completely accurate. Obviously there are no major flaws, but if it was COMPLETELY accurate is hard to say (I'm not an expert).

Spielbergs greatest acheivment so far, he is a truly talented man with limitless ideas and vision. I remember watching this movie in the teather and hearing sobs and tears as people walked out.

1242894,4,B00000K3AM,"The Vietnam experience changed war films forever. Not so much the war or its outcome but the fact that we had all seen war live on TV news broadcasts. No more would film makers depict war as an opportunity for John Wayne types to be heroes in an environment where blood was never seen and death was quick, non graphic and usually off camera.
With Saving Private Ryan, director Spielberg sets out to take the depiction of the horrors of war to new heights. The opening section showing the first bloody minutes of the Normandy landings in 1945 must be the most blood drippingly violent sequence in mainstream cinema. It is also, by repute, the most accurate depiction of the landings ever on the screen.
The explicit violence and special effects are wrapped around a plot that would have done John Wayne proud in the pre Vietnam era. Three brothers, serving in different parts of the world are coincidentally killed at the same time. The fourth brother, Private James Ryan (Matt Damon) is lost somewhere behind enemy lines in France in the immediate aftermath of the Normandy landings. Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks)  is sent, with a small group of men to find Ryan and bring him out of France so that he may be sent home.
Don't expect the plot to bring you any surprises or any real suspense. Don't expect to be moved by memorable acting. It's not that kind of film. The cast are competent and the script is slick but the film really stands on its special effects, action and pace. These are all spot on, it was these aspects of the film that won Oscars and they combine to produce a film that is well worth watching.
It's not for the squeamish and its concentration on effects and action mean that the character building necessary to carry any real message just does not happen. However, those factors do not detract from the film's ability to keep an audience's attention for three hours and you will carry the images of the film with you for a long time afterwards.",974764800,5,1971,4.567796610169491
1242895,4,B00000K3AM,"Tom Hanks is excellent and his character is nicely developed, while the action sequences are second to none.  But ultimately ""Saving Private Ryan"" is like so many war movies I saw as a kid, regardless of how well rendered.  The opening scene (after the shlocky frame) as they storm the beach at Normandy is pretty awful.  You get the sense that a nation shows its resolve by how many of its young men it is willing to sacrifice.  Just throw the bodies out there.  In Kosovo we held that number to zero.  Such a lovely way to fight a war.  In WW II the number was, however many it took.  Says something.  Spielberg makes this point with the wide-angled shot of the channel filled with Allied landing craft and support vessels for as far as the eye can see-a scene incidentally right out of Frank Capra's seminal series ""Why We Fight"" to which this film is indebted whether Spielberg acknowledges it or not.
World War II was a war so horrible and so all encompassing that to this day we really don't understand it or comprehend it.  Spielberg thought he was being ""objective"" in showing war ""as it really was,"" with Americans murdering prisoners and vomiting from fear and dying like cattle without a chance (something Capra of course was not able to do).  Yes, but to show the ""saving grace"" of individual valor is to perpetuate the war system, because that valor is a fraud.  It was not the bravery of our soldiers that won the war.  Just as it didn't matter how brave or how cowardly the soldiers were in the landing craft, it was the sheer volume of them that prevailed.
I think as long as one believes that individual heroics amount to something we will have war.  Spielberg no doubt thinks he has shown us the horror and waste of war, but while plying the trade he knows so well (seducing the audience) he has trumpeted the glory of war, that old fraud, and so he is just like the rest of the proselytizers, only more skillful.
Still it is impossible to say what is right.  If we had not won WW II the world today would be vastly different.  Totalitarian, imperial, repressive, racist regimes in which the state tortures and enslaves the people would have prevailed.  They may have nuked one another by now and we could be living in the rubble of a bestial existence.  Who knows?  Thank God for the United States and its incredible industrial capacity, because that is what won the war, not individual heroics, much as our tribal minds, along with Spielberg's, would like to believe such fairy tales.",974505600,6,2504,4.536748329621381
1242896,5,B00000K3AM,"Coming from someone with a profound liberal political bias, one would never expect to see such a laudatory tribute to the men who defeated Nazi Germany during WW II.  But here it is nonetheless, probably the best war movie (and most visually stunning anti-war movie) ever made.
  This is Spielberg's tribute to the GIs who took on the mighty Wehrmacht and defeated it.  These were the schoolteachers, the inner city kids, the farm boys and the timid souls who met the ""supermen"" of Hitler's Aryan Army and defeated them.
  Why is this the finest war and anti-war ever made?  Well, look at it.  It is probably the closest one will ever see to the real thing.  Arms and legs fly, men die horribly, painfully and screaming.  There is no nobility in war and no glory, either.  Spielberg, with the assistance of an outstanding cast, shows us  that all too vividly.
  The reason for the mission of these eight US Army Rangers, is the rescue of one lone paratrooper, assigned to the 101st ABN Division, which had been dropped behind German lines on the night of 5 & 6 June as the remainder of the Allied Armada prepared to board landing craft to storm the beach of Hitler's ""Festung Europa.""  PVT James F. Ryan is the sole surviving son of a family of 4 from the heartland of America.  Raised on a farm with his brothers, all joined at the beginning of the war or as they came of age.  When his three older brothers are killed in action within a week of each other,  a wary Army staff is prompted to attempt a rescue of the last son from this Iowa family.
  In a memorable scene which is supposed to include General George C. Marshall, Chief of Staff of the Army in Washington, several officers argue for and against the attempted rescue of a single private behind enemy lines in Normandy.  No one knows if he is alive and some argue that the rescue mission will most certainly kill most, if not all of the rescuers.  The argument is a sound one, but it also shows the compassionate side of the huge and mostly unwieldy war machine of the United States of the time.  The message is clear; despite the fact that the United States had more than 10 million men and women in uniform in 1944, the force was not that large that it could not look for, find and save one anonymous private, and all because he was the last living male member of his family.
  The rescuers are a polyglot crew.  In size, their little team is nothing more than a short squad of riflemen.  But they represent the best of the assault troops the Army has available, the Rangers who seized Pointe du Hoc and held it for the rest of the Americans storming ashore.  They are led by Captain John Miller, someone we get to know as the movie progresses.  He is older than the rest and later, we find that he was much older than the average company commander of the day. He is accompanied by the sturdy, career Sergeant, who has see service with him in every major battle in the European Theater of Operations.  There is the smart-assed PVT Reiben, a stereotypical New Yorker who always has a smart remark and a complaint for whoever will listen.  The lone Jew is also present.  He is portrayed as alternately frightened and heroic.  I was saddened when I saw what happened to him in the most personal battle scene in the movie.
  There is a scripture quoting sniper. Obviously, this was Spielberg's swipe at Southerners and their rifles.  A fundamentalist sniper?  How original and how cliched.  Barry Pepper still did an outstanding job in the role and had I been in that situation on D-Day +1, I would have wanted someone like him along.
  Captain John Miller also takes along a young linguist, T-5 (Corporal) Upham.  A rear echelon soldier, untrained for infantry combat, he is fluent in French and German.  Later in the movie, he quotes Emerson to Captain Miller and during this interchange, we come to realize that there is much, much more to the heroic officer than meets the eye.  As the movie progresses, we watch in horror as Cpl Upham comes unglued by the rigors and horrors of war up close and personal.  In the scenes where Upham fails as a soldier and fails his fellow GIs, Spielberg allows the young actor, Jeremy Davies to realize an outstanding performance.  It is just one of many in this incredible movie, but it is the most memorable.
  Tom Hanks was nominated for another Academy Award for his role as Captain Miller.  It was an understated role, delivered with mastery and precision.  I actually believed I was listening to this man and thought he would have made a fine infantry officer; as good as any I served with.  Unfortunately, Hanks, a two-time Oscar winner was not the recipient of a third award.  Like Spencer Tracy, who was also nominated more than twice (and won twice), the Oscar went elsewhere.
  Everything is accurate about this movie.  The uniforms, the coloring, the insignia, the weaponry, the locales.  As I watched the movie and all the carnage it portrayed, I developed a new respect for my father's generation.  After all, these were the men who were there and brought home the victory.  These were the men of ""The Greatest Generation.""  If Steven Spielberg never makes another movie, then this one will be his tribute to his father and my father and all of the other men who fought, died and won WW II.  These are the men who made the world relatively safe for the rest of us.
  Yes, this is a bloody and thought provoking movie.  It is also a masterful tribute to a generation of men the likes of which America doesn't seem to be capable of producing any more. Now, we have greedy yuppies and Generation Xers who know everything about everything there is to know.  From 1941-1945, we had everyday Americans who went out from their homes and defeated the best of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.  They didn't ask for the war, but when the time came, they stood up and met the challenge before them.  This is their movie and Steven Spielberg has done an eloquent job of telling their story.
  After seeing this movie, I have developed a much deeper respect for my father and men like him.  I have personally thanked every WW II veteran I have met since seeing this movie (as I have with every Viet Nam vet I have met).
  To those who would take what freedoms we still possess for granted, I can only say one thing:  Go watch SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.",974332800,3,6345,4.514059753954306
1242897,5,B00000K3AM,"I am no great Spielberg fan.  I never liked E.T.  I thought Jurassic Park was really dumb (although the sequel was OK).  But he has made two movies that would both probably make my top five list: Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan.
Saving Private Ryan is different from other war movies I've seen.  Other such films are not typically very personal.  This detracts from the power they are able to convey.  Spielberg, for better or for worse, always manages to portray the human element in a situation, probably better than anyone else.  The near-flawless realism of the battle sequences is not for gross-out factor but to tell the story like it is.  A lot of people died in World War Two.  Not many movies really portray that.  This movie does.
But what makes Saving Private Ryan a cut above all the other war movies is its story.  It's not about how many people died in some great battle against the Nazis, it's about those who survived.  This makes it all the more powerful.
Combine all this with superb acting all around and a stirring yet unobtrusive score from the undisputed master John Williams, and you have a movie worth owning.  I personally have the DVD and I can certainly reccomend it.  Be warned: this is an intensely realistic movie; not for the faint of heart or weak of stomach.",973900800,2,1300,4.595652173913043
1242898,5,B00000K3AM,"**This review covers the 5.1 surround version, NOT the DTS version**
I was anxious to receive this DVD, since I heard amazing things about its sound quality.  The DVD comes in an attractive case, with well-made graphic design on both the package and the disc itself.  A small pamphlet comes inside the package, with an interesting read about Spielberg and the film.  Not too impressive, but a good read overall.  I popped the DVD into my player and was very impressed with the simple, yet beautiful menu design.  Navigation is easy and the menu design couldn't be more simple, without lacking attractive graphical design.  In the menu, you have the choice of picking certain scenes with a very impressive moving scene index, and you can choose to have English subtitles.  The special features are put together very well.  You have a special message from Steven Spielberg, a behind the scenes featurette titled ""Into The Beach"", the theatrical and re-release trailers, cast & crew info and production notes. (Into The Beach is NOT on the DTS version because of space limitations.  DTS audio takes up much more disc space then other audio formats.  If you prefer DTS audio and don't mind the lack of the ""Into The Beach"" featurette, then make sure you order the DTS version.)  The audio choices you have are 5.1 digital surround and 2.0 Dolby surround.  Whatever type of system you have, be prepared for an audio experience that will overwhelm the senses.  Saving Private Ryan is an incredible film, a real tribute to those that put their lives on the line over 50 years ago.  Spielberg has created a film with top notch production values.  The cinematography and sound design, as well as the production design are incredible.  The picture quality of this DVD is superb.  It is very clean with beautiful detail and a look and style that is amazing, especially during the battle scenes.  The cinematographer Janusz Kamisnki, who I had the pleasure of working with once, did an exceptional job of bringing the viewer right into the extreme chaos of war, and creating a visual experience unlike any previous war movie ever seen.  The sound of this DVD is another story in itself.  The sound design of this film is just about flawless.  Incredibly realistic, unbelievably clean with beautifully recorded music and crisp, clear dialogue.  If you have a surround system, the war sequences will be nothing less then spectacular.  Even those with 2 speaker set-ups, the sound is amazing.  On 5.1 systems, gunshots and bullets will surround your head with such clarity, you may find yourself ducking for cover.  Sound design is ground-breaking, and the people responsible for it on this film should be applauded.  Deep bass is well used throughout the battle scenes, so your subwoofer will have an extreme workout.  The ambiance and atmospheric qualities of the entire film, along with the surround and effects elements, will give the viewer an unbelievable listening experience.  Add this to an incredibly visual film, and you have the stage set for about 3 hours of DVD pleasure.  I highly recommend this DVD to any fan of Spielberg, or to anyone who really wants to hear audio that is simply groundbreaking.  In conclusion, Saving Private Ryan is an excellent, well produced film.  A real tribute to those who risked their lives in World War II.  This DVD is excellent....buy it and enjoy it...an amazing treat for the eyes and ears.",973382400,10,3425,4.892361111111111
1242899,5,B00000K3AM,"I've tried for quite a while to find a tagline for this movie. The one I've found seems appropriate ,I believe it sums up the essence and the messages of this extraordinary movie.
  Yes, it's one of my favorite movies , I don't know anybody that hasn't seen  and admired it . Well, it's for a reason. No movie (that I know) from the last decade conveys the horrors of war in that explicit, down to earth, realistic way. While seeing it for the first time my heart ached, I felt so much grief over all the men that'd died in World War II, and in all the wars, for that matter.
  In this particular case, this war was unavoidable, and these men were fighting for the most noble reasons . I felt throughout the film in great debt to all those soldiers that had fought the nazis, and helped shaping the world as we know it today .When Captain Miller'd said in the end ""Earn this ,earn it "" I felt like it was addressed directly to me, and that as a person that has earned the right to live thanks to the western victory ,should I transcend myself from all those pitiful everyday problems of mine to accomplish something good, real good in my life.  I've thought a great deal about it in the couple of years since I've seen the movie . I have this notion in my mind, and I'll keep on trying.
  One cannot refer to ""Saving Private Ryan"" without praising the sublime soundtrack composed and conducted by John Williams. It's my all time favorite soundtrack, I've listened to it more than any other disc, never getting enough of it. Williams succeeded in seizing the entire diversity of emotions ,feeling and sentiments the movie had delivered in the best possible expression. I admire his creation as much as I admire the movie ; It's so touchy and delicate ,that in the first times I've listened to it ,I couldn't stop the tears out of dropping down my eyes .
  "" Hymn to the Fallen "" cannot be left unmentioned . It's the most intensive track ,the main theme ,if you may .I haven't heard anything that meaningful ,similar to this masterpiece (""Symphony of sorrowful songs"" by Gorecki is an exception and has transcendency of another scale). I could actually hear the mothers cry with anguish and pain in the peak of this creation. If you haven't heard it yet, it's an imperative you won't stay indifferent to it's majestically crafted tune.
  Another genius part of the movie music ,unfortunately ,left out of the soundtrack ,is the song ""Tu Es Partout"" by Edith Piaf. The song integrates so harmonically with the progress of events in the movie ,that you can't help yourself from falling in love with it instantly, unquestionably. A true brilliant choice.
  Then ,coming downright to the essence of the movie ,you're left with the distinct feeling of sorrow and pain over all the dead, wherever they died .The scense of death is strong in this film ,the realism is the highest I've ever encountered. This is a great achievement of Spielberg, the director, and I think that he's accomplished his initial goals with this astounding film .
  In the end, owning this DVD is an obvious act ,and the first one to buy if starting a personal library. Every penni justies it's expense .",972691200,,3172,4.528896672504378

1242901,4,B00000K3AM,"This may well be one of the best--and most gruesome--war movies ever made. It remains a cut below Platoon, however, because--yet again--Spielberg just COULDN'T avoid weepy sentimentality.  The framing device he uses--the old man whining at the head stone, adds nothing to the movie, and takes away much.  As a final image, it needs to resonate with the rest of the movie, to emphasize what has come before it.  Watching the old guy wimper to his wife about his having lived a good life is an utterly unearned emotion. The quality of his life, his character, after the period of the movie's narrative is never shown, so ALL we know about it is what he and his wife tell us.  We are shown nothing, in other words, and so what is meant to be a moving moment remains flat...unearned emotion.  We are being told how we ought to feel about this, without being given any detail to make that feeling genuine.
It's a very brief moment in an otherwise excellent movie, but that it is the final image taints the experience of the whole movie--it is, after all, the final impression we are left with.
This movie contains some of the most graphic, brutally honest battle scenes ever filmed, I think.  Young men (and women) should watch this before enlisting!  It might give them pause.

These scene are there to make you understand what the American WW2 soldiers went through to defend and protect nations outside the US. The horrors are indeed hard to take in, but as soon as these are over, new horrors lurk in the next scenes. Emotional horrors. The tension of getting yourself killed at any time.
It's not about horror, it's far from it... it's about a family with no father that 3 out of 4 sons were killed in the war, and the youngest is to be saved by a group of unique and wonderful soldiers.

1242904,5,B00000K3AM,"In the last film of the 20th century directed by Steven Spielberg he's lifted his craft to a new level, transending all that parody that he relied so heavily on earlier in his career.  And there's no doubt that Saving Private Ryan is the most realistic war film of all time but is it the best?  Well, let's just say it's right up there.  The fine ensamble cast is headed by Tom Hanks as a Captain sent behind enemy lines in search of a private whose lost his brothers to combat.  His mission's to lead a group of eight, himself included, and find the private so he can be sent home to console his grieving mother, for whom our emotional attachment is dependant on one minute of the films near three hour running time.  Despite her lack of development in that one moment we come to understand her devistation and don't need any further explanation.  The private's played by Matt Damon who doesn't show up until the movie's two-thirds of the way finished but his lack of screen time doesn't diminish another fine performace on his part.  The plot is interesting but can't help but be overshadowed by the fantastic battle scenes which serve as the film's bookends.  The opening act takes place on D-Day and, though I hate you use this phrase when describing the horrors of war, it's breath-taking.  The picture and sound quality are such an intical part of this phenomenal film that it should almost be a crime to watch it on anything else but DVD.

1242912,1,B00000K3AM,"Saving Private Ryan is a movie that we have all seen too many times.  It is a war movie with a lot of action and a lot of patriotic babble.  Tom  Hanks plays the humble man who is a teacher turned soldier and who  apparently believes it is honorable to fight and kill in a war for the sole  purpose of going back home again.  The enemy are portrayed as heartless and  evil, with one german prisoner behaving like a circus freak.  The  Americans are stereotypes: tough guy, bookworm coward, humble leader,  religious guy, city guy, etc.
Although the opening scene is brilliantly  filmed by Spielberg, 15  minutes does not make a great movie.  And as for  its supposedly realistic portrayal of violence?  Obviously the violence is  meant  to appeal to action/horror movie fans.  I know college age guys who  watch the movie just to see the blood and gore.  So when you come right  down to it, all this movie has going for it is depiction of death in war.  Each soldier's death is meant to be even ""cooler"" than the last  one.  This is a brilliantly filmed melodrama that has a pitifully weak  story and a muddled message.  The most offensive thing, I believe, was  ending the movie with  an American flag waving proudly, as if to suggest  that the death of millions of innocent young men can be justified by a  symbol.  If Americans want to continue to think of war as honorable, then  maybe we should start another Civil War...it would surely inspire  countless films and endless entertainment for fans of graphic violence.",969321600,32,1522,4.580524344569288

1242914,4,B00000K3AM,"This film has been mentioned as the greatest WWII film of all time.  It  was very good, but nowhere near that good.  It probably qualifies as the  one of best WWII films made after 1970.  There were dozens of great films  with better stories made in the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's when the war was  still fresh in everyone's minds.
The story was about a rescue mission to  find a paratrooper behind enemy lines and bring him back alive, because all  his brothers had been killed in the war.  The platoon was commanded by  Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) who had to take his men through enemy  controlled territory to rescue Private Ryan (Matt Damon).  It is a  combination character study and action film, more about the platoon than  about Private Ryan himself.  Other than Captain Miller, there wasn't very  much character development, but there was a good deal of time devoted to  the human dynamics within the platoon, which was excellent.
What really  stands out about this film is the direction.  Steven Spielberg has created  probably the most gut wrenchingly realistic war movie ever made.  The  scenes on the beach at Normandy were terrifying.  This should be required  viewing for all politicians and generals before we commit men to battle.  Spielberg's attention to detail and willingness to show the grisly and  horrifying results of men being thrown into a fusillade of projectiles is  unparalleled.
The entire ensemble cast did a terrific job.  Tom Hanks,  as always, was masterful as Captain Miller.  He struck just the right  balance between the sympathetic commander who understood what his men were  going through, and the hard-nosed military man who had to force them to do  a job they didn't want to do.
I rated this film an 8/10.  It wasn't the  greatest WWII story ever told, but it may have been the greatest telling of  such a story.  This film shows explicit battle scenes that are brutally  gory.  It is definitely not for the squeamish.",968544000,,1963,4.795180722891566

When I left the theatre to return home, I felt so  sad, that I cried all the way. Over the summer I saw the movie again on  numerous occasions to try and figure out why it affected me so much. Why?  Because of its brilliance! This movie managed to totaly turn my emotions  inside out. Every Character that was portrayed, particularly Miller,  Mellish, Reiben, Coparzo and Wade, touched a piece of my soul. The tragedy  in this film, was so intense that i still, now two years later, cannot  watch it without tears streaming down my face.

The last  two hours, including the final fight scene, were truly some of Spielberg's  best moments ever captured on film. Violent it is, and the language is  awful. But, beyond that, is a moving story with characters who were  fighting to save ONE man. This will remain one of my ten favorite films of  all time.

Dont forget that its not a documentary,its a  hollywood movie. In my opinion, this movie was made beautifully. The action  scenes were amazing.

1242918,4,B00000K3AM,"Firstly, i'm not in the military. Secondly, I read military books now and  then; mostly non-fiction.  And now, the movie...
Some people wonder why  the opening battle is only 20 minutes, considering the actual thing took  hours. Hey, this is a movie; if the opening battle was given full time  there wouldn't be enough time for the other situations.
For those who  wonder if the German ( with the knife ) who kills Mellish in the tower is  the one who was allowed to live at the radar site, the answer is NO.  His  face is different; some people say the uniform is different, too.  If that  doesn't satisfy the argument, consider this: if it was the same man, why  isn't there any reaction when he and Upham pass each other on the stairway?  Why wouldn't have Upham shot him then, instead of later on?
Speilberg  made the movie to honor Americans who served during the war. People think  he was making the case that America was the country that did the most to  help win it; I don't see that message.  If you want to see how Russian  soldiers are honored...well, there are movies that do that.....don't know  if Amazon.com has any.
Is the movie anti-war?  Well.....Speilberg makes  movies about WWII, so he really doesn't cover war as a general concept,  which is what I suppose an anti-war movie would be about. So maybe I don't  have an answer for that one.
One reviewer thought the message of the  movie is that America is unprepared for the next war.  That's an odd angle  to look at the movie; I don't see it; if someone asked Spielberg about the  Pentagon's current global strategy or force structure, he might just shake  his head.
Capt. Miller's decision making at the radar site has been  questioned many times.  All i'll add is that his mistake may be less as  technical faults of the movie and more like an example of human  decision-making under stress.
The battle at the bridge has been  criticized as being unrealistic; I have some agreement.  The German force  had heavy weapons and superior numbers in riflemen, yet couldn't overcome  the defenders without being badly mauled.
The cemetary scene with Ryan  asking his wife ""did I earn it?"" WAS kinda shlocky.
So, how do  I give it 4 stars despite the faults? The invasion battle doesn't hold back  on how badly a human body can be mauled; compare this to early 50's war  movies, where soldiers drop when they are hit and have a trickle of blood  from their mouth.  The battle also shows that death doesn't always come by  direct enemy fire ( things that get mentioned in death notices), it can  come from an indirect way ( drowning, an exploding flamethrower strapped to  a friendly soldier ); he didn't go the next step by showing death from  non-combat accidents, but it wasn't really needed here.
When the squad  first links up with troops of the 101st, there's an exchange of rifle fire;  a squad member ( Caparzo? ) searches through a group of apples, finally  finding one that's apparently tasty enough to eat; he does this  nonchalantly as if the shooting isn't occuring; in real life, things like  this do go on.
After Miller speaks with the hearing-wounded soldier about  Ryan's location, he gets the squad together to check a map. The background  music arrives at just the right time....he checks the map for Romelle,  going from the mood of ""we'll never find him, i'm frustrated"" to  ""we're in business, i'm an officer so i'm going to act like  it""....meanwhile, the 101st continues to move on past.  Symbolically,  this could be ""the war marching on"", continuing whether Ryan was  found or not, whether he lived or not, whether the squad lived or died.",968457600,3,3630,4.625196850393701
1242919,5,B00000K3AM,"It's hard to put into words how I feel about this film. It's so moving and  so filled with action that you find both exciting and horrifying at the  same time that it's hard to describe.
You come away from Saving Private  Ryan speechless. Grateful for a generation of men who were willing to lay  down their lives to do what's right by serving their country in the war  against Hitler. The story is fictional, but the sentiments and personae of  the soldiers are, from all accounts I've read, fairly accurate. The scene  in which the troops assault Omaha Beach, one of the bloodiest meat grinders  of D-Day, is perhaps the most gripping thing I've ever seen in a major  motion picture.
Spielberg uses a mock war-journalist perspective for  many of the combat scenes which gives the movie a sort of modern newsreel  feeling. I'm not quite sure it's necessary given all the realistic and very  destructive special effects, but it has the desired effect.
I own the DTS  DVD version of the film and I can say that they did a very fine job on it.  Running the film in stereo gives you much the same sensations that you get  out of seeing it at the movies.
I can't recommend this movie highly  enough. It's on my personal top five list of all time.",968371200,2,1242,4.453333333333333
1242920,4,B00000K3AM,"I will follow up with a real review in the future.  For now, I wanted to  answer a question posed by an earlier ""review.""  Someone asked  whether the German soldier captured and freed (by Miller and his men during  the assault on the machine gun nest) is the same soldier who kills Private  Mellish with the knife in the final battle - the answer to that question is  NO.  I also wondered the same question and recently came across a book on  war movies that addresses that very topic.  If I remember correctly,  Spielberg clarified that point and also acknowledges the possible  confusion.  After all, both soldiers are similar in appearance with the  same haircut.  In retrospect, though, the soldier who killed Mellish has a  more hardened, chiseled look whereas the soldier from the machine gun nest  has more of a ""weasel"" look.  The demeanor of the two also  differ.
Now I would like to pose a question to those who own the DVD  version of this movie.  I've tried out 8 different copies of the DVD and  each one freezes for a full second near the end of scene or chapter 12.  It  occurs right after the machine gun assault scene where Corporal Upham  questions Miller about killing the German prisoner.  After Miller tells him  that he can help bury the bodies, the screen freezes for a full second  during the close-up of Upham's face.  Does anyone own a copy where this  doesn't occur?

The Longest  Day used, as advisors, actual participants during D-Day to accurately  portray the landing and subsequent activity.

1242923,4,B00000K3AM,"Saving Private Ryan contains what is unquestionably the finest 30 minutes  of a war film ever made. From the landing up through taking most of the  beach, Spielberg does a staggering job of presenting the American end of  operation Overloard. This is not for the faint of heart, but nontheless  this is somthing I reccomend to everyone (and watching it on home video is  going to be a lot less daunting than on the big screen).
Sadly, though,  the movie falls apart in the second half. The stunning authenticity of the  landing degenerates into war movie cliches and Norman Rockwell-style  imagry. We've got the offhand dismissal of the British and Commonwealth  contribution, even though they did most of the bleeding in the first weeks  to take the heat of the Americans. We've got the by-now absolutely standard  American ethically-diverse squad, each with his own identifiable  personality trait. The final battle at the bridge has all the failings he  so meticulously eliminated in the beach landing scene: the shockingly  incompetant Germans (particularly the tank drivers), the heroic GIs  (except, of course, for the one guy who has already been stereotyped as  paniky), a perfectly-timed appearance by the cavalry, and a heroic and  prolonged death scene for our hero. Ugh. You know, though, perhaps it  wouldn't be so bad if the contrast *within the same film* wasn't so  sharp.
It seems that Spielberg is just intellectually incapable of  avoiding melodrama. This would have been a much more compelling story if  Spielberg had simply tried to tell a real story (as he did for the first 30  minutes) rather than making one up, but there you go I guess.
Still, does  the first 30 minutes make up for the last 90? Absolutely. The first 30  minutes is in my opinion absolute cinematic genius, a staggering  accomplishment. But the split personality of this film is somewhat bizzare,  and I wouldn't feel bad for skipping out as soon as Tom Hanks meets that  paniky interpreter-guy. As good as Saving Private Ryan is (and it's pretty  good), I can only hope this paves the way for a truly great World War II  movie.",968198400,13,2121,4.862745098039215
1242924,2,B00000K3AM,"There's been so much hype and commentary generated about this film, most  pro and con commentary has been mentioned, so just some brief comments  here:
The Omaha Beach scene, filled with mind-numbing violence, and  realistic disorientation, earns the film the credit I have given it.  One  may quibble about whether Capt. Miller would really have deliberately  exposed himself to a German MG just to draw fire... and there's no doubt  that the real WW2 trivia buffs would pick the entire film apart.
But  really, my objection is that the rest of the story is too much of a  lengthy, schmaltzy cliche about ""the few sacrificing for the  one.""  It tries way too hard to be (ultimately one-dimensionally)  inspirational, based solely on that single theme.  ""The Thin Red Line,  "" a somewhat flawed but better film, gives one much more philosophical  meat to chew on.
Perhaps as a compensatory conceit, SPR does tend to  tone down the sophomoric morality a bit by slathering over the scenes with  slick and flashy violence.  And in the lately fashionable trend of sniping  at the Brits, they just couldn't resist the temptation to perpetuate the  anti-Monty myths with a toss-away derisive comment.
Unlike many true  classics, this film gets more boring as you view it numerous times.  Nothing new is appreciated, but the triteness and pretension of the story  line become more pronounced.  In short, it looks a lot more impressive when  first viewed than when repeatedly examined.",968198400,8,1477,4.979423868312757
1242925,4,B00000K3AM,"This movie brings the reality of war right into one's living room. My  initial reaction was how can we as humans resort to such savagery. The  reality is that war seems to be a necessary evil where freedom is  threatened. One asks if there couldn't be a better way - I don't know if  there is an answer to this question.
The last few lines of the film were  deep - it calls us to ask of ourselves the same question - are/have our  lives been worthy of the sacrifice made on our behalf - by men and woman  who have gone before and fought for freedom and then by the sacrifice of  Jesus trading His sinless life for our sinful one.
We will need to give  an account for our lives one day. Please spend your life building something  that will last, that you may have an offering that has lasting (eternal)  value.
All in all a good movie - the violence is quite graphic but I  guess this is how it was and therefore is not gratuitous.",968112000,2,930,4.134078212290503
1242926,5,B00000K3AM,"The opening 20 minutes or so of ""Saving Private Ryan"" are among the greatest ever put on film Ask anyone who's seen the movie about the  assault on Omaha Beach and you usually get a response in a hushed voice  filled with awe. I think that people always thought that the fighting in  World War II was less violent than it was in, say, Vietnam, because of the  way combat in those two wars were portrayed in the movies. Compare the  ""bang, you're dead"" fighting in classic WWII movies with the  special effects in movies like ""Platoon"".
This movie utterly  destroys that perception in the first few seconds of the assault on Omaha.  That sequence, as the landing crafts holding Capt. Miller's (Tom Hanks)  company unloads, is in my opinion the most horrifying scene in movie  history. Horrifying for its graphic violence, for its claustrophobic  terror, and for the fact that men actually died this way. It is almost  unbearable.
That some of the men get off the boats and on the beach is a  miracle, and that any survived long enough to engage the enemy is another.  The combat scenes are frantic, exhilarating, of course terrifying. When  Miller and his men finally pull out their weapons you can see the insane  pleasure of combat that soldiers often experience, a chance to hit back and  kill those who are trying to kill them. The combat scenes are  unforgettable, men running through rubble for better firing position,  blasting away with their rifles as fast as they can pull the triggers,  sandbags exploding under the impact of the bullets. No quarter is asked or  given, Americans slaughtering Germans as ruthlessly as the Germans did  before the tide of battle turned.
The movie settles down somewhat after  that into a more recognizable war-movie plot. Miller's squad is sent to  find a soldier trapped behind enemy lines who has a ticket home because his  three brothers have all been killed in combat. The movie presents the  question, is the life of one man worth risking the lives of 8 other men?.  The decision to rescue Pvt. Ryan is, however, not a moral one, but a  political one, made by General George Marshall back in Washington, who  doesn't want the papers to print the morale-sapping story of a woman who  lost all 4 of her sons to the war. He makes this choice perhaps in part to  mitigate the suffering of a grieving mother, but more so for the war effort  as a whole. The fact that other mothers may lose sons because of his  decision is, sadly, irrelevant compared to the war effort as a whole.
As  Hanks' squad marches through Normandy looking for Ryan you get some feel  for the enormous scope of the invasion, and the confusion of it all.  Thousands of men, all heavily armed, a terrible sight.  Every encounter  with the Germans turns to chaos. A sniper forces the squad to watch  impotently as one of their friends dies just beyond their reach. A falling  pole collapses a wall, revealing a room full of armed and very surprised  Germans, and the resulting standoff, with Americans and Germans pointing  guns at each other and screaming for the other to surrender, is almost  absurdly funny, until the standoff ends with an inevitable massacre.
The  battle at the end of the movie is as terrible as the assault on Omaha. The  fighting is savage and cruel, and the violence is so graphic that it is  difficult to watch. You almost get the feeling during the fighting that the  world is coming to an end, that the gods are coming down to destroy the  world. When the battle finally ends, with the squad's sole survivor walking  around in circles, seemingly looking for his lost comrades, there is an  overwhelming sense of loss. Not triumph, or relief, or anger, just  loss.
Spielberg and Kaminski do brilliant work here. The world of the  battlefield is shown  with terrible verisimilitude. Hopefully future war  movies will not feel the need to be as graphic in depicting combat as this  film is, but in this movie its absolutely necessary. The colors in the  movie have a faded, washed out appearance, and the camera runs along right  next to the soldiers, adding to the powerfully realistic feel.
The only  problems I had with the movie is the way it's framed. You see an older man  in the present day visiting a military cemetery in France. The man kneels  before a grave, and as he begins to remember the events that make up the  film, the scene switches from the old man to Miller in the landing craft.  You get the impression that Miller is the old man, which he's not. I  thought that was confusing and not well-done.
And at the end, when you  know who the old man is, and his family is standing behind him, a family  that wouldn't exist if not for Miller and his men. The man breaks down and  asks his wife, ""Tell me I'm a good man."" This is pure Hollywood,  all wrong. After all that's come before there is no need to resort to such  blatant tear-jerking appeals to the audience. It would have been far better  for the old man to quietly ask that question of himself, or, better yet, to  say nothing at all, and let the scene stand by itself. What words can  convey the thanks and gratitude for the sacrifices made?",967852800,7,5157,4.577850877192983

1242930,2,B00000K3AM,"Steven Spielberg is a proven master of movie making - providing he does not stray from the path of producing movies with a capital E for  entertainment. When he wanders into the field of history he does not seem  to be able to resist taking Indiana Jones with him.
In Schindlers' List -  where I feel he came closest to making an historical classic - he  absolutely destroyed the finish by trotting out the survivors in full sun  drenched colour having shot the balance of the movie in a cleverly washed  out hue.
In Saving Private Ryan he starts off promisingly. The landing is  handled with a gritty intensity and it was refreshing to see ( if you can  call murder refreshing ) that GI's too are not above shooting surrendering  troops. All very credible in the heat of battle.
Given that the director  was always going to introduce the 'human element' to pander to the soapie  fans I also felt that the uncovering of the Ryan casualties was also  tastefully done. As was the scene depicting the breaking of the news to  their mother.
My major beef was with the last half hour where Spielberg  reverts right back to the B grade matinee. Tom Hanks - AKA John Wayne -  fights off the evil empire. I kept on waiting for Donald Sutherland and  Telly Savalas to appear! Or at the very least a peppering of Sieg Heils! or  Banzais!
Reality check - The D-Day landings were notable for the sluggish  initial response the Allies encountered from the Germans. So the landing,  per se, was not as difficult as it might have been. It was the thereafter,  despite complete air superiority and limitless resources, that heavy  weather was made.
Hanks and his cronies - if we are to accept the  Spielberg version - lured in all likelihood one of two SS divisions to  their party. Either Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler or Hitlerjugend.
Assuming  it was the Leibstandarte - which had been resting and refitting in France  following their exertions on the Eastern front - then I have a huge problem  with their performance in this movie. These were canny operators of the  highest order and, with the greatest respect to Hanks and his band, would  have 'eaten them for breakfast' given their combat experience.
Strangely  - despite other reviewers' comments to the contrary - the sudden ( and  timely ) intervention of air cover at the end of the action - was the most  factually plausible aspect of the sequence.
If the director wishes to  continue presenting cartoon style history to modern viewers who -  particularly since 1989 and the demise of Soviet Russia are gaining access  to more and more archival material - then I must suggest he changes his  name to Schmaltzberg.",966902400,12,2658,4.667386609071274
1242931,4,B00000K3AM,"No one doubts Spielberg is a master filmmaker, and few directors are so adept at manipulating the audience's emotions as he.  He's also a master image-builder and storyteller.  These skills he pushes to the limits in SPR  and the result is gripping and entertaining for those who can deal with the  film's often stomach-churning violence.  There is everything here - intense  drama and suspense, heroes overcoming incredible odds, humor, pathos,  internal conflict within the good guy camp, plenty of shooting and  explosions, a main character we identify with and care about.  Viewed as  pure action film this movie has few equals and I would gladly award it five  stars if it billed itself as such.
However, Spielberg instead marketed  this film as an almost documentary-style account of Overlord.  He justified  the film's unprecedented level of gore by pointing out that he was making  the first truly ""realistic"" war movie in history and we needed to  see it like it truly was.  By taking this tack, he surrenders the right to  have his film judged by its story and style alone.
Unfortunately, SPR  gets a lot of stuff wrong in the realism department despite having Stephen  Ambrose vouching for it (or perhaps because of it - Ambrose is a  controversial historian to some).  What's worse, many who see the film and  are impressed with its claims of ""this is how it really was"" will  walk away misinformed but convinced they know the truth.  None of the  historical flaws of the film are fatal in and of themselves.  After all,  most American war films take gross liberties with the facts for the sake of  story.  When war films do strive to get the facts exactly right, the result  is often wooden (Midway), so directors are to be excused for taking some  license.  But as I stated before, if Spielberg is going to set the bar  higher for his movie's sake, he has to be prepared to be judged by a higher  standard.
Take the famous opening battle scene.  Viewers are left with  the impression that the first wave of infantry (under Hanks's leadership)  secured Dog Green in about 20 minutes of fighting.  Blow up some concertina  wire, pick off a single machinegun nest using a sniper, and suddenly the  whole beach's defenses crumble to the point where Tom Sizemore's Sgt  Horvath has the time and security to gather French dust into a can as a  souvenier.  In truth, the first waves (and second, third, etc) did little  on D Day morning except cower below the seawalls for several hours.  There  were certainly officers like Hanks's Cpt. Miller present that day, and  through simple dogged courage they did force open the draws under heavy  fire.  However, Spielberg wants it both ways here.  He wants to show Cpt.  Miller's company hitting the beach first, but he also wants it to be the  company (now a short platoon due to attrition) that singlehandedly secures  the heights.  In reality these two things didn't coincide on Omaha.  The  result is the viewer is left with the impression that sure, there were some  horrific casualties, but ""our boys"" gathered themselves quickly  and knocked out those German positions in time for an early lunch. This is  jingoism more fit for a John Wayne epic than one supervised by a respected  historian (though jingoism is a rap on Ambrose from some circles).
Another moment, even more hard to swallow, comes halfway through the  picture when Miller orders his squad of six to help him reduce a German  machinegun nest that guards a radar site.  Now the wisdom of this, given  the squad's mission, can be debated. But the main flaw of this scene is the  complete lack of small-unit tactics.  Miller fails to scout the area to the  flanks to see if other guns or troops are supporting the nest.  He simply  assumes the machinegun is alone. He fails to deploy his supersniper Jackson  into one of the numerous trees in the area to pick off the three gunners  from a distance even though this is the tactic he used in the beach scene  where it made much less sense.  He fails to even consider moving around the  flanks to a better assault position.  Instead, he immediately decides on a  blind three-man charge into the teeth of the position - probably the single  stupidist tactic one could come up with given the situation.  Luckily the  German gunners, despite being behind sandbags and armed with the  superlative MG-42 machinegun, seem to have been trained at the Stars Wars  Stormtrooper School of Marksmanship and they only manage to kill one of the  squad's members before they are despatched themselves.  Incredibly, after  the action is over, despite the fact the squad is ten miles behind enemy  lines and near an installation the Germans are obviously guarding, the men  make no effort to adopt a defensive posture nor scout the surrounding area  for other troops who may have heard the firefight and start coming to  investigate.  Instead, Miller heads off to a hillside alone to dramatically  cry while his men mill about and smoke cigarettes.  No wonder we liberated  France so quickly, the film seems to say - there were only three Germans  every five square miles defending it.  It's hard to imagine anyone who has  experienced actual small-arms combat viewing this scene and concluding that  Cpt Miller knows a thing about leading infantry.  Yet, we were told that  this is ""how it was"", so I guess it must have been just that  easy. ...............",966729600,23,5412,4.768729641693811

SPR is a depiction of what happens when a civilian nation mobilizes for war unready and meets a professional Army. Its not ""Anti-War"" as some reviewers propose,  for its fading flag scene in the beginning is the reminder that for a  nation to be free and not under the Nazi flag, HUMAN BEINGS have to become  Citizen-Soldiers and stop the cunning and the arrogant from over-running  the earth. That this flag is fading is an expression of the humanity of  those who created this freedom aging and dying (the elderly combat veteran  at the graveside) as the new generation is clueless and failing to pick-up  the torch and keep the freedom vibrant and flying. SPR is a subtle  warning---are we up to this? Are we today up to the task of defeating evil  on a world-wide scale like the greatest generation was? THAT'S THE  QUESTION, not ""war is hell"" and other cliches'. You and I both  know the answer to that question is negative. Just look at some of the  reviews here.
To the Anti-American reviewers: the German people of the  1933-1945 time frame put the Nazis in power. I'm sorry, but this was there  time to fight the evil of their day, and they failed. They embraced the  evil, they helped it kill millions. That's what happened and no amount of  anti-American sarcasm and americentricity will change this fact. See to it  that if such a challenge comes before you in the future that you are a good  human being before you are a good facilitator of totalitareanism.  Deal?
The point of SPR is that our military has to be ready to fight and  win with superior ground dominance----dropping bombs at 15,000 feet will  not save the day as bombs from 1500 feet didn't save CPT Miller. This  entails a lot of technotactical details which after 3 years of war, vets  like CPT Miller had learned were needed but were stuck fighting the war  with what they had--never an ideal choice . If we don't want to be forced  to having to make ""sticky bombs"" we had best re-orient this  nation's citizenry to the NEED FOR A COMPETENT, PROFESSIONAL MILITARY THAT  IS BACKED BY THE PEOPLE ORIENTED TO ACTUAL GROUND WARFIGHTING AN NOT  MAKE-BELIEVE POSTURING FROM THE AIR/SEA. If on the other  hand, all you want to do is weep over the loss of Miller and his men, you  are NOT HELPING the real men in uniform today. Like young Private Ryan,  please go make yourself useful in this fight, and ""EARN THIS""  freedom we enjoy.

1242933,5,B00000K3AM,"This is not 'just anoter war movie' as some previous reviewers have called it nor is it 'just another Spielberg movie'
The film opens with a WWII  vet along with his family visiting one of the U.S. D-Day cemetaries in  France.  It then moves to the invasion day itself in one of the many  landing crafts transporting a few of the many GI's that served on that day  and follows one Capt. Miller and his squad from their day on the beach  through their 'politically correct' orders of locating and extracting Pvt.  Ryan, who's mother will be notified of the deaths of three out of four sons  all on the same day.  Ryan's three older brothers, all serving in the U.S.  Army were killed in action the previous week and the Army is trying to  avoid the publicity of getting a whole family killed.
The film is a  stark, graphic and brutal portrayal of landing on the beach and surviving  the next hours only to be givin the Herculean task of locating a single GI  who's unit is out of contact 'somewhere out there' in an area dominated by  the Wehrmacht and returning him safely to an Allied-controlled zone.  The  portrayal of the characters in the squad are complex and diverse.
I am no  fan of Mr. Spielberg's work however this movie stands alone for several  reasons:
First, being an amature WWII historian of the European theater,  I found this film to be so remarkably consistent with accounts I have read  from numerous airborne and amphibious assault GI's as well as pilots who  were involved in the June 6, 1944 D-Day invasion which is the largest  amphibious assault in military history.  The fact that many, many WWII vets  who served on D-Day who saw the movie and were moved to deep emotion is  anoter testimony to it's authenticity.
Second, It is presented in such a  way that the average moviegoer can grasp some of the unbelievable,  superhuman tasks and actions that the rank and file GI's were called upon  to do and did without regard for their own lives.  I have always been eager  to talk to surviving WWII vets but now I make it a special task to shake  their hand and tell them 'thank you' for the job done so selflessly by so  many.
Third it is an important work because it highlights only one of the  many, many stories of a handful of average guys thrown together doing the  impossible on D-Day and the weeks afterwards.
Several other reviewers  have taken great pains to point out the film's shortcommings but I believe  that these points, most of them correct, are not the truth and only point  to the validity of the movie as a seperate entity from the screenwriters,  director, and actors. By itself, examining it as a whole, it is a character  study and human conflict all rolled into one and portrayed in vivid,  engrossing detail.
Incidentily, Hanks and several others spent several  weeks in a condensed bootcamp lead by real U.S. military Drill Instructors,  living in the field, eating K-rations, and being exposed to the realities  of a GI's life.  All this brings about excellent performances from the  actors who's names are both large and small.",966211200,2,3079,4.608133086876156

While the opening sequence pulls no punches and is truly a  technical achievement, it should be obvious [director] Steven Spielberg  uses the heartbeat of this story to do his 'Jewish duty' and portray those  nasty Germans as totally vile, even making it clear the German POW's should  be shot. It is testament to Spielberg's manipulative skills that this film  is as popular as it is. It is, after all, supreme propaganda.

This movie has many very good, rich scenes... Probably the most  highly vaunted is the initial scene of the beach landing... yet there were  several scenes that I found more powerful and more substantive.
However,  ultimately this movie is reduced to the normal action flick formula wherein  the enemy is personified in an individual and revenge is the ultimate  vindicator.  Too bad.",965692800,,687,4.495934959349594

1242938,5,B00000K3AM,"Saving Private Ryan clearly ranks as one of the best motion pictures of all time. Unfortunately, the small screen version of the picture does not  do the battle scenes justice. Anyone interested in buying this movie should  consider the wide screen VHS version.
Aside from that lone defect, I  would recommend this video to everyone. I have seen this film in the  theater four times and although being 6' 5"" tall and weighing 225 lbs,  I still have tears in my eyes every time I watch it.
For me, watching the  movie brings me a sense of profound humility. The first time I saw the film  was a couple of days after being laid off from my job. I realized then that  my troubles paled in comparison to those brave men who gave their lives on  Omaha Beach. Since that time, I have become ever more interested in the  happenings before and during World War II and hopefully have more humility  and concern for others.
If our young people who were not born during this  time of world conflict watched this film, they might derive the same sense  of humility and appreciation as I have of the men and women of our armed  forces who basically saved the world from tyranny.
Now about the movie:  Tom Hanks was perfect in his role as were all of the supporting actors. In  particular, Sizemore was the perfect sergeant. I knew many of his type when  I served in the military. Goldberg, the lone Jew, was terrific in his part  as was Diesel as Caparzo. My favorite in the film was Burns who portrayed  Private Reiben from Brooklyn. This young man played his role flawlessly.
The opening battle scene was horrifying. I kept telling myself there was  no way anyone would come out alive. The tank scene at the end was more  terrifying than any horror movie. I can still hear the creaking and  clanking of the tank wheels even without watching the film. What at first  seemed an implausable story was made entirely plausable by the way it was  carried out.
It is very unfortunate Saving Private Ryan did not win an  Academy Award for best picture, which it richly deserved and ended up  behind Shakespeare in Love, which I walked out on when it was halfway  through.",965520000,3,2152,4.507772020725389

Watching this movie  makes you appreciate ""really appreciate"" what these guys had to  go thru to survive. The last battle seen in the movie actually gives you  butterflies in your stomach!

1242941,4,B00000K3AM,"It is unfair to say that 'saving private ryan' is the greatest D-DAY film  of all time. Its quite simply not. The first 20 mins or so of the movie  (set on Omaha Beach) is the only scene actually dedicated to the greatest  day in modern history. No movie could ever exactly portrait the happenings  of June 6 1944. A few arms and legs being blown off does not qualify this  film for being the 'most accurate'. The events leading up too and during  this great day are a story within themselves and for those with a limited  knowledge of world war 2, i expect that the script must have been very  confusing. Im sure that many who have seen the film had not the faintest  idea of what was going on.
I would have to agree that the opening battle  scene is quite possibly the greatest ever made however that does not give  it the right to be compared to other movies such as the 'The Longest Day'.  Its main plot is vastly different. Im sure that Stephen E. Ambrose would  have been a little disappointed (as many veterans were) with the story line  of Saving Private Ryan for the simple fact that there were countless  factual happenings on D-DAY with enough content to film a hundred movies.  Tom hanks was brillaint (again) as Captain John Millar though i thought  some of the other acting led a lot to be desired. I am thankful that  Davies, Speilberg and Ambrose have helped to keep the brave and unselfish  feats of our countrymen alive for some time yet.

1242945,5,B00000K3AM,"SPR may be the best war movie ever made, in terms of realism(if reports of WW II vets having flashbacks are to be believed).  Itis also, intentionally, a testament to the now-passing GI generation. As such, it is of a piece with Tom Brokaw's ""The Greatest Generation,"" and the shelf of Stephen Ambrose-authored books. SPR is a big-screen movie; it dosen't come across as impressively on a TV screen.  That said, it is still better than any other war movie that I've ever seen.  The beginning, when an old and ailing vet seeks out a cross marking the grave of his benefactor in a Norman cemetary for American war dead, limmed in clear sunlight, is moving.  The rest of the movie, ending excepted, is a flashback, as the camera focuses on his eye, entering it to reveal his memories.  This is not a complete flashback, as the portion of the movie leading up to the meeting of Cpt. Miller (Hanks) and Pvt. Ryan (Damon) would not have been a memory, although perhaps related to him by the surviving member of Miller's patrol afterward.  While there has been some criticism that this writer has read, from a German veteran, alleging flaws in the appearance and equippage of the German soldiers, virtually no average moviegoer will see anything that dosen't seem authentic, down to the tiniest detail.  (""Patton"" and ""Midway,"" by way of contrast, used modern tanks and ships in scenes that were not actual war footage - these were easily identifiable as anacronisms.) Aside from technical excellence and utterly realistic combat footage (not for the squeamish, but not unnecessarily gory), the movie's most memorable trait is the aura of goodness that it cloaks America in. The idealism behind an American 5 star General personally intervening to save a mother's last living son, when they were common folk, is plausible in an American, but unthinkable in any other country.  Can you imagine a British, German or Japanese general acting in the same way?  Yet, it is believable to the audience that an American would. (In their defense, foreginers could point out that the mission was described by Miller's patrol as ""FUBAR."" They had their own lives to lose, and mothers, too.)  The nostalgia for a 'good war,' as Studs Terkel called it, with America on the moral high ground, permeates the story.  Gen.  Marshall's reading from Lincoln's actual letter to a Civil War mother who lost all her sons in battle, itself highly idealistic in tone, embodies the theme of the movie, which has to do with the goodness of the American ideal.  That said, the movie does not stoop to flag-waving; the grimmness of Omaha Beach is unmixed with syrupieness and jingoism.  This is a sobering film; like any realisytic war movie must be, it is also anti-war.  I wish that every high schooler, and every Member of Congress would watch it. -Lloyd A.

1242946,2,B00000K3AM,"Why is it that we give this man Academy Awards? When I was young I loved Spielberg but now I can't stand him. He is insincere. He is a tear-jerking manipulator only, without subtlety or understanding. I left this movie  thinking, finally, people will realize that this man is all gee whiz and no  substance. All Spielberg knows, besides technical wizardry (which is  ultimately boring because not character driven) is melodrama and bathos. He  knows nothing of honest drama and pathos. He actually WAVES THE FLAG at the  ending of this movie! It's like a cartoon or professional wrestling, I  swear. Have I been taken to another planet or something, or are we in a new  Dark Ages? Has Spielberg ever actually read a book? Grow up, for the love  of Man! This man-child studio mogul is not an artist and should go back to  making adventure movies like ""Jaws"" or ""Duel"" and leave  history to people without box office and Oscar-collecting agendas. Shame,  Mr. Spielberg. Shame. Come on people, if it's an easy, agreeable answer  then someone is trying to sell you something. Buy something else, if you  want my opinion. Stephen Spielberg is primarily a salesman, only  insterested in a buck or power or status, and not in communication. This is  a very bad movie.",964396800,14,1260,4.741935483870968
1242947,1,B00000K3AM,"Spielberg's overarching message in Saving Private Ryan is that after 54 years, the Allied myths about World War Two continue to hold true--Studs Terkel's pivotal reference point--""The Good War""--is confirmed.  There are good wars, by golly, and WWII was it. Hip, hip,  hooray!
Spielberg chose to advance his agenda by transparent means. One  of these is the suggestion that the Wehrmacht--mostly conscripts, if we  recall our history--are practically war criminals just for fighting the  Americans.
Moreover, Spielberg the ""humanitarian"" telegraphs an  unambiguous message about the necessity of shooting unarmed German POWs and  how foolish it is not to shoot them.
One of the most compelling  principals in the film is the Sgt. York character-- a Protestant  fundamentalist from the South who's a diehard German-hater. When a POW  speaks to him in German, he erupts in a rage, saying, ""Shut that  filthy pig Latin!""
""Pig Latin""? German being the language  of philosophy and rocketry, among other stellar Teutonic achievements,  Spielberg would seem to be both applauding and mocking the anti-German  bigotry of this ""hick,"" who mutters a psalm every time he blasts  any German who gets in his sniper rifle's sights.
How the Germans ever  conquered Europe and North Africa and fought the Red Army to the gates of  Moscow is certainly a mystery if one credits their portrayal in  ""Saving Private Ryan."" They fight with basic soldierly resolve  only as long as they have the advantage--a fortified pill box, a machine  gun nest or a Tiger tank. But as soon as the tide turns, the German  soldiers toss their arms into the air and jabber in hysterical fear and  pleading.
They fight with the same wooden stupidity as did the extras on  the set of the old 60s TV series ""Combat""--as soon as they are in  American sights they get hit and drop, whereas American troops can run in  front of a legion of Wehrmacht rifles and machine guns while dodging  bullets with miraculous invulnerability.
The Germans are mere ciphers.  Never does Spielberg take us to their campfire to hear their songs and  stories. We almost never glimpse their humanity. No German words are ever  translated into sub-titles. German becomes an unintelligible clamor--a  ""pig Latin."" We are glad whenever the German boys die and  Roosevelt's troops prevail.
To sum it up, pure propaganda and a complete  falsification of History would better describe this germanophobic  movie.

I consider this movie to be one of  the all time greatest movies made.  It shows the realities of this  horrifying war and the spirit amongst the soldiers who fought for our  freedom.  The fact that 8 men went in to save just 1 makes you realise just  how great these human beings really were and that people lost weren't just  another dead body.  The opening scene on the beach is enough to make anyone  feel quite weird. It's a strange feeling but one that definately bought a  tear to my eye.

1242950,5,B00000K3AM,"If there had been any doubts about Steven Speilberg's status as one of the finest motion picture creators ever ('The Lost World' had given his reputation as a popular entertainer a knock, and many people were  forgetting 'Schindler's List'), 'Saving Private Ryan' squashed them. 'Ryan'  took a simple story and turned it into something extraordinary, both an  unflinching look at the random slaughter of warfare, and a portrait of  ordinary people voluntarily stuck in an unimaginably inhuman situation,  with solid acting from an odd cast. Tiny segments remain in the memory long  after the film is over, and the final half-hour strikes an extremely  precise balance between being exciting and utterly terrifying. At the  cinema in which I saw it, the audience were silent as the credits rolled,  and filed out as if stunned.
Trying to separate its status as a  historical document from its status as entertainment is tricky. A film  about a significant subject is not, in itself, unassailable, but as with  'Schindler's List' this it not just a film about momentous events, it's a  great film about momentous events. In retrospect, the middle segment seems  to drag on too long, but without it the film would be unbearably intense,  and that's all I can think to say against it.
It seems obscene that  'Saving Private Ryan' lost out to the trifling 'Shakespeare in Love' for  the Best Picture Academy Award.

This is surprising,  because usually the Army will not go out of the way to retrieve one single  man. One soldier is chosen to lead six men into battle to retrieve Private  Ryan.  At the beginning of the film, director Steven Speilberg takes us  to the front line.  The first twenty minutes of the film consists of the  Americans invading Omaha Beach at Normandy. As we watch this part of the  movie, we are almost thrown into the battle with the help of up close and  personal camera shots and movement. This part of the movie, as well as the  rest of the movie, is notorious for its ultra realism. In World War II,  that means some serious violence. We are forced to watch people die. There  are some quick shots of death, but we are also forced to watch some very  painful shots. Most movies would show a quick painful death. Speilberg does  something more, he makes us watch characters we love and grow to know, die  slowly, painfully, and with emphasis on realism. Showing this gives movie  patrons a shell shock of realism and emotion, and it's hard to find a movie  that can do that to us.  If one can make it through the first twenty  minutes of the film, he or she is on an emotional journey that will never  be forgotten. After the last of Private Ryan's three brothers dies at Omaha  Beach, the search for Private Ryan begins. We are now given the opportunity  to meat the team that is sent off to save Private Ryan. Led by actor Tom  Hanks, the team sets out with a controversial mission to save someone they  don't even know. The reason this is controversial is because in war,  soldiers are resources, and risking the life of seven men to save one, is  illogical. The movie puts that aside and brings a glimmer of morals into  the war. Although some of the team disagrees on the purpose of this  mission, they know that they have a mission to do and must follow it. When  asked ""How do you choose between the mission and the man"", Tom Hanks  replies, ""This time the mission is a man.""  This movie has excellent  character development. The team of six people is introduced to us well, and  the characters are written wonderfully. Everyone on the team has an  original personality. As the movie progresses, we grow to like a single  character one at a time. Just when we start to like the character and want  to know more about him, he is killed in action. Since we are forced to  watch a slow, painful, and gruesome death, this is a great loss to us, and  an emotional shock. Since this is war, we can't expect everyone to live.  But still, we are hurt when they die. Then about two thirds through the  movie, we meet Private Ryan.  At first, Private Ryan is reluctant to go  with the team.  Later, he realizes what the team has gone through to bring  him back and decides to go with them.  This movie is a serious roller  coaster ride for mature audiences.  For three hours, we watch war, people  die, and the bond between soldiers. By the end of the movie, the people in  the audience who aren't crying, are speechless. No other war movie has been  so realistic. People who say the movie is too realistic are scared of the  truth, or an oxymoron. Something is either realistic or not, without  realism people are disillusioned. Censorship is a bad thing. War is war, if  your scared of the truth, don't see it. This movie just dodged an NC-17  rating for just violence and realism. Speilberg is a wonderful director for  taking us on such a journey without compromise.",962496000,2,3906,4.436440677966102

1242959,5,B00000K3AM,"I am a child of the 70's, grew up in the 80's, and matured in the 90's (supposedly).  I'll admit that there are surely some war flick gems I have never laid eyes on.  To be honest, almost all of the war movies I have seen  were made after the time of my birth ('72).  I have seen Apocolypse Now,  Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Born on the 4th of July, Hamburger Hill, The  Thin Red Line, etc, etc.  Each of those I found to be good, if not great  movies.  But for my dollar, Saving Private Ryan captures the most of what I  think a war flick should.  The story itself is not overly complex:  the  mission to save one man.  Of course, there is much more to it than that,  but that is the basics.  I have to admit that the two battle scenes at the  beginning and at the end are what set this movie apart from the others.  Normally I am into the more poignant and artistic war films (Born on the  4th, The Thin Red Line), but my values have changed.  Simply put, no other  war movie has left me with a feeling of loss and pain.  The time Spielberg  and crew spent on making the battle scenes look and feel as realistic as  possible is not to be overlooked.  The camerawork was perfect.  The way the  marines worked the way up too the beach on the shaky camerawork was  brilliant.  The muted coloration helped inspire the gloom and terror of  these battle scenes.  Yes, I'll admit the characters weren't developed as  much as they could have been, and yes, this was a United States flagwaving,  patriotic movie to the core.  But I don't see how people from all over the  world can't find this movie absolutely moving.  And I would love to see a  movie made about WWII as told by another contributing army.  But until that  day comes, people should stop complaining about how flipping typically  American this is and enjoy it for what it is.  If you don't leave this  movie without feeling a profound statement was made for not just the U.S.  but the world then maybe you might need to be a bit more open-minded.",962236800,2,2005,4.248663101604278
1242960,5,B00000K3AM,"There's no doubt in my mind, that anyone who has seen such films as ""The Dirty Dozen"", ""Where Eagles Dare"" and ""Kelly's Heroes"", have been lead to think, that World War II was  an exciting and funny adventure. For example: When Lee Marvin leads his  'dirty dozen' into enemy land, it makes you think of Robin Hood and his  merry men. And it's a well-known fact, that when you're watching earlier  war films, you're often supposed to clap your hands or even laugh, when a  hand grenade or machine gun kills a bad German soldier or officer. But is  war really just a lot of fun and excitement? I don't think so!
The first  20 minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"" gives you an idea about, what  war is really about. It's hard to describe, what makes the opening battle  scene in ""Saving Private Ryan"" totally different from the battle  scenes in all other war films. Perhaps it's the hand-held cameraes, which  gives everything a documentary look, or the close-ups of kaptajn John  Miller, played by Tom Hanks. He's filmed in slow motion, and looks around  like he's thinking ""What are we all doing here? Why are we doing this  do each other?""  Or perhaps this battle scene is different, because  nothing here is funny or exciting! And how COULD it be funny? Slaughtering,  mutilation, blood, dead, or in short: The loss of human life. Or perhaps  it's all these things put together.
Young Private Ryan has lost all of  his brothers in the war. Kaptajn John Miller and his men are sent out to  get him home, because some officers in the American army think, it would be  too big a tragedy, if Mrs. Ryan lost her last son, too. That's the plot of  ""Saving Private Ryan"". But underneath this simple story, you'll  find another story, a story about what a war does to people.
""Saving Private Ryan"" is not a pleasant experience, but a  necessary one. I've never really liked war films, because most of them have  romanticized and glorified war. This one shows us the horror of war and  bloodshed, and does it without any raised fingers. It's that really  possible? Yes, it is, if your name is Steven Spielberg. I don't want to see  more war films after ""Saving Private Ryan"", because now I've  seen the ultimate anti-war film.",962064000,,2215,4.579081632653061

Ryan captures  the realism, the blood, the anguish, the stress of combat, the decay, the  horror of it all.  I, of course, like so many others got teary-eyed in  several scenes. I am glad that Spielberg made this picture. The young  people of today won't watch films such as The Longest Day or A Bridge Too  Far because they were made before their time. It is high time a filmmaker  brought the horrors of World War II to the modern cinema so the young can  get somewhat on an idea of the sacrifice the men and women of that  generation made so that this generation could enjoy their basic  freedoms.

Spielberg follows a troop of soldiers, each with  distinctive personalities or skills, whom you learn to like...until they're  killed. You'll root for your personal fav, hoping he'll dodge those bullets  or shoot that German. Sometimes they don't do what you want them to do, but  that just shows their character...war makes people act on instinct, a  primary one of which is fear. Spielberg truly plunges you into battle,  taking you right there beside them, with awesome sound and expert  cinematography. The colors are bleak and desolate, adding to the gritty  feel of the movie. I especially enjoyed the calm whitenesses that Captain  Miller experiences twice, as time slows down as he watches the chaos around  him. I haven't seen enough WWII movies to make much comparison, but this  one is filled with enough characterization, a cohesive plot to keep  interest, and gripping action to keep one entertained.

1242966,5,B00000K3AM,"Spielberg has been workng up to this movie for his whole life.  As a fan of his, I couldn't wait for this movie to hit theaters.  It is without a doubt one of his finest and certainly stands amoung the top war films of  all time.
First off, there is the poignant view from the late 20th  Century, the aging and fragile war veteran revisitng the battles of his  youth.  This film is a poem to the World War II veterans, and in that  respect, it has a humming patriotism that recalls the films made during the  war.  Yet it delves deeper than that and manages to surpass its  rather  standard story structure and comment on the greater truth of war, heroism,  life, death, and country.
Clearly the most noticeable aspect of SPR is  its stunning, breathtaking brutality.  The Omaha beach scene and the  climatic final battle are both suckerpunches of directing and  cinematography, a visceral perescope view of the true violence of war.  Never before has combat been captured so realistically, so graphically, its  power enough to bring understanding to those who never have seen war, of  what it is all about.  For those who ahve witnessed bloody combat, it is  almost painful to watch.  This film is important and it is above all,  excellently made.
Standout performances by Jeremy Davies, Barry Pepper  and Tom Seizmore add great flavor to the story, along with a strong Hanks,  Burns, and Damon.",961632000,6,1396,4.6929460580912865
1242967,5,B00000K3AM,"There have been many, many movies made over the years depicting the events of WWII, but I have to say that none have captured the true feeling of war like ""Saving Private Ryan"".  This film brings the war to the screen through  the eyes of a handful of soldiers picked to carry out a most unique  mission: Bring back the lone remaining member of the Ryan family. The often  told story of the four brothers drafted at sent off to war is widely known,  but this is a very touching and artful depiction of the men who reluctantly  set off to recover Private Ryan and return him to his grieving mother. Tom  Hanks plays Captain Miller, the squad leader taking his men through the  European countryside in search of the missing private. Hanks will never be  able to play a character the lager than life, macho way that John Wayne  did, but he brings a certain every-man believability to his character. He  is not a hero, he's just a man trying to do his job so that he can get home  to see his wife. The men in the squad are an eclectic group of soldiers,  played by an exquisite cast, that often times hate each other but are  willing to die for one another just the same. The militray type preparation  that all of the actors went through to make this film really pays off  because as you're watching you believe that these men are actual soldiers  fighting for survival. The much publicized, and often talked about opening  scene depicting the storming of the beach is intense and sometimes  difficult to watch. The violence and blood are plentiful, but it is  essential to the telling of the story and setting the tone for the film. If  you have not seen this film it is definitely worth the time to sit down and  watch. If you don't own it, then you should think about adding this  wonderfully told story to your collection.",961545600,2,1823,4.424698795180723

The depiction of the landing on Normandy Beach is one the most  intense battle scenes I have ever seen.

Spielberg has not only paid a  deserving tribute to the veterans of World War II, he has also produced an  excellent anti-war film that shows the true horror of  warfare.

1242969,5,B00000K3AM,"During times of peace the children bury their parents, but during times of war the parents bury their children. The most powerful film of the decade. I just hope it managed to convey a real sense of horror, and not just a  sense of patriotism among certain people.
It's not the story of heroes  dying for democracy and freedom. It's the story of thousands of young men,  lives that wouldn't have changed a thing, fighting and dying in the most  terrible conflict of all history. Although, perhaps dedicating the film to  all people, no matter what nationality, who died either far from their  homes or in the ruins of towns and cities they once lived in, would have  been a fitting ending.

The one quip I have about this film is that it  couldn't be any more unoriginal if it TRIED to be. Yes, the D-Day scene is  graphic and accurate...but that's one of the few remotely unique parts of  the film. Personally, I believe that this movie is mainly just that, a  movie. It's never going to be a masterpiece because it just doesn't lend  itself to it. Platoon and Full Metal Jacket took place in the same war, but  at least they had a different story and meaning to them.

First, I want to congratulate Spielberg and his crew for giving the most realistic war sequences cinema has ever seen. It was about time.
Second, the acting,  dialogue, and story was perfect.
A lot of people bash this movie because  the plot was 'too simple"", or it was ""regular war movie  garbage."" Well, I got news for all of you: War is anything but  spectactular or outstanding.
Whether you're taking a machine gun nest, or  planning a multi-national assault on a beachhead, you want and need to keep  things as simple as possible; hence, the ""simple plot.""
As far  as the ""regular war movie garbage"" goes, the makers of this movie  were simply taking events that actually happened and told a story loosely  based around them. So, next time you see a WWII vet, why don't you go up to  him/her and tell them their war wasn't realistic and all they did amounted  to ""garbage"".
That is, if you got the guts to...
People  learned from this movie that warfare is basically the simplest, most brutal  act that humanity can wage against itself: Kill or be killed.
Since the  beginning of the film era, the world's been waiting for a realistic war  film. Well, it's here, and it's ""SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.""",961113600,,1246,4.574660633484163

1242974,4,B00000K3AM,"I have no pretension of thinking I can say anything new about this film. It is powerful, emotional, raw, and yes even flawed. But Saving Private Ryan is a movie. Many consider filmaking to be an art ( though very  commercial ) and like all art it isn't intended to be an absolute slice of  life - it is intended to be one person's viewpoint. It's a stylisation -  not a document. There are technical flaws, anyone who has served in the  infantry or with an infantry unit for any time at all will catch them  immediately. Yet a painting isn't expected to be a photograph - why expect  such a thing from a movie? To attack the choice of portraying Omaha Beach  and the American experience in Normandy strikes me as rather petulant as  well. This is an American film, written by Americans, made by Americans. A  British filmaker might choose day one of the 1916 Somme offensive as his  horrific beginning, a German -  Stalingrad, a Frenchman - Verdun, and a  Canadian perhaps Cambrai or Paschendale. Granted the movie  does play with  historical facts , but it dosen't affect the movie's power any less. Some  reviewers feel that the violence in the film was excessive, but I must  disagree here as well. In the medium of film exaggeration is often  necessary to carry across the full impact of the human experience. With  only one notable exception ( footage of the Marines on Tarawa Island 1943 )  all the combat footage I've ever seen is actually rather dull and  anti-climactic. The violence and death that the soldiers in the newsreel  footage feel smothered by  just dosen't carry across to the viewer who is  removed, safe. In Saving Private Ryan Spielberg gives to the audience  member the sense of how random death is on the battlefield. Unpredictable  and arbitrary. Art and exaggeration are cousins, be it poetry, filmaking,  sculpture. Saving Private Ryan conveys the physical discomfort of the  soldier in the field and the boredom. Often a soldier's day to day  exsistence ,even in combat, seems to consist of endless patrolling, long  hours of inactivity, and endless gripe sessions. No Saving Private Ryan is  not a documentary about the American soldier in WW2. It isn't about the  differences between the ""average"" infantryman who was drafted and  the hard charging Airborne/elite soldier. It's about conveying to those who  have never experience combat - and god willing never will - the sense of  what it is like. And even if the movie only brings across a third of that  reality then it's a great movie. In passing I feel like it should be  pointed out that many WW2 combat veterans who saw that movie found it  horrifying. I personally talked to one old Marine who survived three island  campaigns with the 1st Marine Division and he felt llke that movie  portrayed the life of a combat soldier more effectively then anything else  he had ever seen. I don't see how anyone can refute that gentlemen's  opinion.",960768000,6,2929,4.732142857142857
1242975,5,B00000K3AM,"My advice is, see it in the theatre.  Watching at home, where the cat wanders in and jumps on your lap, a bus drives by in a crucial scene, or the phone rings - these things really do upset the atmosphere.  To  appreciate the movie, you must be immersed in it.  If not, you'll notice  that there really isn't much of a plot.
But, the plot is not the point.  The immersion into the horrors of war, if only vicariously, is the point.  And it truly is horrifying.  The scenes on Omaha Beach were especially  effective.  The climactic battle goes a little more slowly, as Spielburg  wisely knows that we are saturated by violence at this time, and sets it  more as a battle study rather than a collection of greusome images.  In  between those two battles are a number of interesting little interludes,  some being battles, others being character builders, but all of them keep  you in northern France in 1944.
As for the DVD edition, I will not  comment on the technical details, as I haven't the equipment to do it  justice.  I will comment on the included documentary, however.  I did not  find it particulary useful or interesting.  Perhaps someone with little  knowledge of the specifics of WWII operations would enjoy it, but it came  across as a sales pitch (or a rebuttal to the Academy for selecting  Shakespeare in Love) rather than a D-Day retrospective.  The making of  documentary makes the mistake of showing too many relections and not enough  technical detail - to me, these features should have shown how they made a  Tiger panzer, how they did the makeup and explosions, etc.  At least they  showed footage on the ""basic training"" the actors went through.

1242977,4,B00000K3AM,"_Saving Private Ryan_ earned much critical acclaim and reviewers are still emoting over it.  Some of this is deserved, but much of it reflects the ongoing guilt-complex and moral confusion that post-Vietnam America has  with respect to war as an instrument of foreign policy.  Regardless of the  ""cause"" most people do not like being drafted and sent to far  away places to kill or be killed.  But this goes to the central flaw in the  film: the main players are NOT just draftees.  They are volunteers in two  elite units: the Rangers, and the 101st Airborne.  In this sense, the  somber, fatalistic tone of the film really jars.
The first 20 minutes or  so of _Saving Private Ryan_ are five-star and beyond.  I generally stop the  tape after that point.  The fact that the soldiers of the United States  Army won the battle at Omaha Beach tends to obscure just how amazing this  feat was.  Spielberg's treatment of one of the Rangers' attacks near  Vierville (the visually more spectacular escalade of Pointe Du Hoc is  treated in _The Longest Day_) is literally stunning.  It is also socially  significant in that it [finally] gave some of the members of the post-WWII  generations a small sense of what our fathers and grandfathers endured in  the world war against ethnic imperialism and race hatred.
But then the  tone of the film changes.  It acquires the fatalism found in the memoirs  and interviews of draftees.  This is in sharp contrast to the elan of elite  units like the Rangers and the 101st Airborne.  This ""gloom and  doom"" atmosphere renders the rest of the film one long funeral  procession which ends, appropriately enough, at the American war cemetery  above Omaha Beach.  It is more Paul Fussell (""Wartime"") in tone  than Steven Ambrose, the noted historian of D-Day and the War in Europe  (""Band of Brothers"").
Perhaps the truest moments of the whole  overblown ""rescue"" mission are these: Ryan's dismissive reaction  to the mission-- he unequivocally refuses to ""bug out"" on his  buddies, who truly are his brothers; and Upham's freezing on the steps when  decisive action could have saved Mellish's life.  The latter strikes me as  an example of an incident that only a combat veteran could fully understand  and that haunts a man down through the years.
I have heard _Saving  Private Ryan_ described as full of stereotypes and  ""meretricious.""  That seems a bit harsh.  The film is worth  seeing, and worth owning.  But it should not be the only account of D-Day  or of the war in Europe that ""under 20s"" ever see or read.  This  is only part of a much larger story.  _Saving Private Ryan_ is simply not  the end-all-to-be-all that many gush over.  It is a very good movie, but it  is not the best, nor is it the first, to convey a sense of the horror of  combat or the loss of loved ones.",960508800,12,2816,4.690721649484536

1242979,5,B00000K3AM,"There are no doubts in my mind that ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a genuine masterpiece, redefining and refreshing the war movie genre with a harrowing realism that is unmatched by any previous war movie. This is a  movie that will suffer on a small screen. When I saw it on a large screen,  the power of the battle scenes were overwhelming, brutal, bloody,  confusing, loud, up close and in your face. When the tanks rumbled in the  film's bookend final battle the entire theater was rocking and shaking like  never before and I was looking for a place to hide. The characters  stereotypes? Hardly. Tom Hanks has been so good for so long,we take his  great acting skills for granted. His Captain Miller is wise, tough,  compassionate, complex, with his uncontrollable shaking hand, and at times  his actions and facial expressions heartbreaking. Tom Sizemore is a  powerhouse as the sergeant, saying ""we're in business,"" when  there is a chance to make a move through the carnage. But notice the more  subtle things, like when he takes small steel cans and puts the soil in  them from each country he has fought and survived in. The rest of the squad  are excellent and I want to single out Jeremy Davies as the  ""coward"" and French/German translator. Spielberg has said that  this character is the one most identify with, and if we are in danger  really, most of us don't want to fight,kill or be killed. To label him a  ""coward"" would render useless your understanding of the film's  themes. The techinical merits of this film are high,making you feel very  uncomfortable. Shooting with  mostly hand-held cameras just adds to the  realism and terror. The sound in miraculous; I'll never forget those  thousands of pinging sounds on the beach steel obstacles. The color is even  toned down, as when we see the American flag devoid of red, that some our  finest people's blood had drained the ragged flag. By all means purchase  this movie, for Spieberg has created yet another masterpiece of action. Put  it on you screen, relax for a moment, when John William's sad trumpet wails  for the lost, who gave their lives for the living. And when the landing  craft ramps go down in the bloody surf, duck and cover. The movie  transcends its genre with its gut-wrentching action and close ups of  suffering beyond anything anyone would want to imagine. Saving Private Ryan  is one of the top films of all time regardless of genre.",960422400,4,2422,4.733812949640288

Most widescreen DVDs display more information on screen than pan & scan DVDs as the widescreen aspect ratio is like the  theater.  On this DVD, the widescreen version actually CUTS information  from the top and bottom of the pan & scan picture.  I learned this  watching the movie on cable, noting that while talking about his shaking  hands in the church, CPT Miller's hands are on screen (and shaking) for  more of the discussion--on the DVD, not so!  Perhaps the  ""five-star"" video production team should obtain James Cameron's  essay on widescreen v. pan & scan and learn that the selection of  aspect ratio and production should not detract from the finished product.

1242982,3,B00000K3AM,"Yet again Steven Spielberg takes a potentially fantastic movie and delivers a supreme disappointment.  Sure, Saving Private Ryan has many unforgettable scenes and images, but so what?  Great bits make not a great  movie.  The gruesome beach invasion that opens the movie is shocking and  spectacular up to a point, but quickly becomes boring.  Come on, any film  that extends a scene comprised entirely of soldiers in combat to 25 minutes  is seriously pushing its luck, no matter how 'worthy' the subject matter.  What follows is one and a half not terribly interesting hours of not  terribly interesting characters debating the merits of their mission and  getting into the occasional scrape.  The final battle is perhaps the most  engrossing part of an otherwise limp movie.  I do wish directors like  Steven Spielberg would resist the temptation to make their 'important'  movies last three hours; there is simply no reason other than ego stroking.  Saving Private Ryan is essentially a terrific two hour movie fighting to  get out of a tiresome three hour running time.  Also, when will Spielberg  return to making his films in the 2.35:1 widescreen process?  His last five  films were shot in the smaller 1.85:1 aspect ratio and as a result they  look like nothing more than glorified television programmes.  Unfortunate.",959990400,5,1327,5.093457943925234
1242983,5,B00000K3AM,"""Saving Private Ryan"" is certainly the most real WWII movie ever written and directed. Although I've never seen real war it had a very deep impact on me. Almost from the first scenes of the movie one starts to realise what  war really means. There's nothing beautiful about it and even the most  heroic deeds are just another massacre.
I don't take it as a novel but  rather as a collection of short stories connected with the search for Ryan  who's three brothers have died in different battles at the same time. We  follow a squad of stonehard soldiers who are sent to find him and send back  home where his mother waits. They are showed as a group of coldblooded men  who can't be stopped in their search. They play games with the metal  ID-plates taken from dead US soldiers in front of a group of greenhorns who  haven't seen actual battle yet, they kill their enemies mercilessly and  with great skill, etc. But at the same time they have their own sad stories  to be told around the lantern late at night, they try to rescue civilians  and sometimes they even don't shoot the imprisone nazis who have just  killed their comrades.
Hanks is brilliant as the leader and no bad words  can be said about the rest of the cast either. Of course the backbone of  the movie are the horrifying battle-scenes were nothing is shown in softer  light than it actually is. And without the brilliant camerawork the movie  wouldn't be what it is. Those viewers who aren't who hate patriotism should  not let themselves be disturbed by the opening and ending, cause this is an  obligatory part in an American warmovie. Finally, SPR really deserved the  oscars given to it; it WAS the best movie of 1998.",959817600,2,1692,4.539735099337748
1242984,4,B00000K3AM,"I read into this movie much like I did Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List""; framing a World War II story from a Jewish perspective. ""List"" was more obvious than ""Saving Private  Ryan,"" but some of the major themes carried over, and two of them  were:
1. The Holocaust ... Adam Goldberg's character was the Jewish  member of the Ranger unit assigned to find Private Ryan. In a montage of  scenes toward the end of the film, when a million things seem to be  happening at once, Goldberg's character and a Nazi soldier physically fight  each other, by themselves, apart from their comrades, and it seems, from  the world around them, that they are alone. The Jew dies, but not with a  gunshot would (like how many of the war's soldiers fell to), but a knife to  the heart. I found this symbolism extraodinarily disturbing, yet effective  in the way that within a matter of seconds, the destruction of European  Jewry was played out on film.
2. Disbelieving the truth ... Jeremy  Davies' character was not an original member of the unit sent on the  movie's unique mission. Instead, like the United States, he joins after the  fighting and killing of WW II have already begun. That was part one of  Davies' symbolism, but part two symbolized the majority of people in Europe  (and, indeed, around the world) during World War II who did nothing to help  their Jewish neighbors and countrymen. In a scene that takes place at the  same time as Goldberg's character is being killed, the Davies' character is  curled-up -- almost in the fetal position -- unable to face the realities  of war around him, and unable to move one way or another; a neutral between  two sides, the Nazi who killed the Jew walks right by the newcomer barely  pausing in notice of him.
Indeed, there are many ways of pointing out the  greatness of this film. It will be appreciated and understood by anyone who  chooses to do so.",959731200,7,1899,4.633633633633633

1242986,5,B00000K3AM,"Opening on a shot of the American flag fluttering in the breeze, lit from behind by the sun, and a soundtrack playing a sombre tune. An old man with his back to camera makes his way down a path lined on one side by a low  wall and to his right a line of trees. He turns to face a field of white  crosses, each about two feet high, some have the star of David as a  headpiece. With the man is his family, a respectful distance behind him;  his wife, his son, daughter-in-law and their three children. The old man  walks into the military cemetary and after a few steps falls to his knees.  The older members of the family group rush to his side, the younger ones  huddle together. The camera makes a tight close-up of the old man's face.
On June 6th 1944 a group of landing craft make their way toward the  coast of Normandy, France. The barrage which preceded their arrival and the  bombers of the Air Force have failed to destroy the German fortifications.  The German army force waits for the landing craft to drop the front  draw-bridge-like door of the craft before opening fire with a lethal attack  by machine gun and shelling.
Captain J. Miller, played admirably by Tom  Hanks, leads the way off his section of beachhead. In a battle which  depicts war in an uncompromising and visceral manner, the opening scene of  Saving Private Ryan sets the tone for a gritty war movie.  The introductory  section of the film over, and if it does not have your attention by this  point end your viewing. The story is simply, Captain Miller is selected for  a mission, to find Private James Francis Ryan (a fictitious character as  are all the main roles of the film except General Marshall) in order that  he may be returned to home. Why ? Because his brothers are dead, all within  days of each other while serving in the army, and young James, Matt Damon,  is his mothers lone surviving son. The army feels it owes it to his mother  to return him alive. There is a true parrallel story for this one. The  Niland brothers all died but one around the time of the Normandy invasions  and the remaining one, also in the 101st airborne division, was ordered  stateside.
This film tells the story of the strains of war on the eight  man team sent to find Private Ryan. The toll of combat stress, the impulse  to keep from any emotional connection particularly with new members of a  unit. The comradeship that develops despite this. The grim conditions, the  enemy and his evil, the sacrifice and generousity of spirit against the  odds. This film creates a remarkable cauldron of emotions. The theatre of  this film is remarkable for its understatement. For example in the scene  between Tom Hanks' character and Matt Damon's before the last sequence of  the story, Ryan is unusually forthcoming and it's my opinion this is an  exception to the interplay of the characters. The brutal conditions and  circumstances make for a poignancy in the interplay of characters which is  a reflection of the strength of character. It is a feat of this films  straight talking and fairness that the magnitude of the achievements in  Normandy 1944 by US forces is shown. In a campaign lasting one month as  many died as did in the Vietnam conflict of a decade in length. Then the  Marshall plan put Europe back on its feet economically. We, in Europe, have  a lot to be thankful for and this movie is a timeful reminder. (For any one  interested in the period the work of historian Stephen Ambrose, noteably  Band of Brothers and Citizen Soldiers, cover the US Army campaign in Europe  for 1944-45 from differing perspectives)",959558400,2,3605,4.571205007824726
1242987,5,B00000K3AM,"Many of my fellow reviewers here have commented about the violence of ""Saving Private Ryan"" being gratuitous or unrealistic. Tragically, it is not. Having read of the Omaha landing and interviewed  people people who were there this film cannot begin to describe the horror  that our soliders faced. We see a mere 15 minutes of what lasted an entire  day to say nothing of the weeks and months and years of horrors experienced  on both ends of the earth by billions of men and women.
Yet all this  harsh and brutal violence is vindicated by the ideals which shamelessly but  solemnly justify the enactment of unspeakable violence. Private Ryan is  Spielberg saying that the cost of any precious freedom does merit war and  its attendant death and maiming. However, not only do we need to be mindful  that freedom is a price above anything material but that it is paid for in  the agonizing death of the young, noble words, and stately tributes such as  monuments like this film.
As an American living 50+years after D-day I  can see Spielberg's point. We are innundated by gratuitous violence that  only serves to make us believe all violence is unnecessary and terrible. We  see films and news reports everday to the point that we become inured. To  make his point, Spielberg had to up the ante and show us what a real hell  on earth war is otherwise we might dismiss Private Ryan and, perhaps more  importantly, the conecpt that war-for-freedoms can be conducted for ideals  that (should) mean more to us as a society then the comforts of home or  even our own lives. If you don't get this, Spielberg is hitting you over  the head with it in General Marshall's reading of Abraham Lincoln's letter  to Mrs. Bixby.
This is not the sanitized technowar of CNN or pentagon  spokespeople. This is war forced upon us as payment for something ineffable  and precious that a handful of men dreamed of back in 1776. Perhaps America  is too jaded to wave a flag or visit the graves on Memorial Day (a US  national holiday of remembrance). ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a call  to Americans and those of other freedom-loving nations to remember and  honor, in unmistakably stark and prideful righteousness, just what ghastly  price liberty demands.",959558400,3,2232,4.7421875
1242988,5,B00000K3AM,"After watching the film Saving Private Ryan under unusual circumstances (unusual for a filmgoer, but ideal for the makers of the film), I have read several reviews, critiques, and otherwise anecdotal notices of the film  which have forced me to reconsider my own opinions and to question the  humanity of the opinions of others.  Granted, we are talking about a movie  - albeit a particularly clever one - and not about history as we choose to  remember it.  But, in purely personal terms, as an active duty soldier in  the United States Army, who watched Saving Private Ryan in a theater full  of other soldiers in Korea, whose father fought in the European theater  (not at Normandy, but at Bizerte, Anzio, etc.) during the last World War, I  must admit to a degree of deracination when I read the comments of many  others.  For instance, many have voiced their displeasure at Spielberg's  use of the contemporary framing device (the old man visiting the cemetery  at Normandy).  I have even read of a few viewers identifying with Upham -  the cowardly translator, who chooses to fire on the enemy only once they're  disarmed and asking for mercy (after he witnesses - and doesn't lift a  finger to prevent - the slaughter of his comrades).  My failure to quite  grasp the lack of comprehension of this film - which is, first to last, an  elegy for saviors of the world ""as we know it"" - stems from much  more than my ""biased"" perspective as a serviceman.  Bill Maher,  in one of his fits of lucidity, commented bitterly on the WWII generation:  ""They saved the world.  And today nobody gives a damn.""  History  is unbearable only because we choose never to learn anything from it.  And  when some viewers fail to see the difference between this particular battle  and virtually any other (such as one from the Boer war), it is obvious  history has taught them nothing.  Spielberg wasn't attempting to teach us  anything we didn't already know.  He was simply attempting to italicize one  moment in history, in the middle of a gigantic slaughterhouse, so that the  generation of men and women who probably came closer to saving the world  than any generation before or since, could be recognized for their supreme  sacrifice, as well as their supreme achievement.  Watching the final scene,  with the now aged Ryan asking his wife if he's a good man, if he's led a  good life, I saw my father standing there, clearly and resolutely, saluting  those that had fallen so that he would live to memorialize them.  Spielberg's elegy is perfect in tone.  And it moves me to see it again and  again.",959472000,6,2593,4.6875

1242992,1,B00000K3AM,"I watched this movie all the way through, but wondered afterwards that I had been able to do so. What is it with the Americans that they so love scenes of violence? The opening fifteen minutes, over which as much ink has  probably been spilt as blood, were not in the least realistic, to my way of  thinking. Apart from stating the obvious, that you couldn't ever capture  that much detail with a beach-based camera crew during a real battle (and  therefore the attempt to replicate the scenes 1940s style was completely  flawed), it was historically inaccurate. To say that this is what the  landings on D-Day looked like is false. Certainly, on some of the beaches  that fatal morning, U. S. troops (among others) did face extremely accurate  and deadly fire from well placed defensive positions, but that was not the  case at every point in the attack, nor even the rule. Some beachheads were  established with remarkably little loss of life. This was due to either  lack of preparedness on the part of the defenders or by the degree of  surprise the attackers attained, or by the mere fact that, in some cases  and in spite of Rommel's preparations, the landings were made on poorly  held ground. Choosing to focus on a beach landing where the fighting was so  desperate was therefore totally gratuitous and in my opinion, it  demonstrates a degree of sadism on the part of the director to have done  so. He could make a movie about a regiment of Scotch Guards attacking a  Boer position in 1899, and with the firepower of the Mausers then  available, it would have been just as violent and certainly as deadly.  There was nothing so special about D-Day in that sense.
In addition, what  the opening scene had to do with the rest of the story is beyond me. As for  the rest, in spite of having thought about the details a good deal, I  cannot see that the story was anything but a vehicle or even an excuse for  a movie about D-Day (which means that what we have is a fifteen-minute,  totally falsified newsreel). Of course there were families who lost four or  more sons in the fighting. The war was made up of a myriad of curious  statistics of that kind.
Perhaps the most devastating fault I found with  the film, once it had settled down to a random patrol meandering through  the countryside of Normandy, was that it had absolutely nothing to say. At  the halts along the way, the conversations between the members of the  patrol, although they appear to be trying to say something, are devoid of  content. And as for the series of events which occur, I had a hard time  maintaining any sense of continuity, and therefore felt there was hardly a  story at all (hence the feeling of the newsreel again). This was especially  true of the freeing of the German soldier who would later turn into an  authentic Aryan killer, as implacable as he had formerly been pathetic. Why  focus on this one sideshow of the war? Is it to show the awful Nazi for the  treacherous scoundrel that people may imagine him to be? Is it to show how  humane the Americans are by comparison? As for this character's subsequent  ""execution"" by the one member of the patrol who had to overcome his own  apparent cowardice to carry it out (and who did so by shooting an unarmed  man - bravo), well, by that time, I was feeling I must really have missed  something important. When poor old Tom Hanks was slowly expiring in the  middle of the bridge, I must admit I was almost relieved. I thought, ""Thank  goodness that's over."" So many meaningless details left me utterly bemused  as to why the film had been made in the first place. I confess I'm still  wondering.",959299200,21,3644,4.535384615384616

So much has been said about  this great movie that I won't go into much more detail, except to point out  that the previous reviewer makes a couple of mistakes.  First, the movie  makes it clear that most of Captian Miller's men DON'T make it off the  beach...the ones who go on the patrol with him are simply some of the  survivors. Miller even says 'is this all that have made it?' at one point  during the landing sequence.  Second, regarding Ryan's children as looking  too young, the 'modern' private Ryan is obviously about 75 years old (i.e.,  he would have been about 21 in 1944) and his children look to be in their  forties...the youngsters referred to in the review are certainly Ryan's  grandchildren.  The 'typical' WWII vet made the most of his opportunities,  went to college on the GI bill, and probably wouldn't have started a family  until his 30s.

I couldn't even imagine having to go  through with that in person. Everytime I see the movie, I wonder, how would  I react in a situation like that. Thankfully, because of those men and  women who sacrificed themselves, I can live in a place were i don't have to  worry about such things. The movie is very moving, and should be seen by  everyone. It will make you cherish the things that we sometimes take  forgranted.",958953600,,749,4.496296296296296
1242995,5,B00000K3AM,"With that incredible opening scene on the Omaha landings, Spielberg brings war to the cinema as it has rarely been done before.  I know some D-Day veterans have said Spielberg got it right, yet others were less sure  suggesting nothing could portray the horror and tragedy of those events in  June 1944.  Whatever the case, those of us who never went will never  understand the experiences of those that did.  But Spielberg shows that  this does not matter so much.
In the post-Vietnam world, Spielberg's  first task was to shock us, to rub our jagged nerves, to expose the lie  that there can ever be glory in war.  After seeing Saving Private Ryan no  viewer could be left in any doubt that war really is hell.  There are no  heroes or innocents in this film, only ordinary people confronted with the  dilemmas war throws forward.  Some have suggested the main characters in  the film are too stereotypical.  But it is not really the characters that  are stereotypical but the motives and emotions they represent.  Each of the  central players are voices that need to convey the contradictions, the  riddles, the questions, the problems of armed conflict - all as old as  humanity itself.  These stresses work their way through all scenes: Captain  Miller's shaky right hand; the little French girl offered up by her father;  paralysis on the steps as a comrade struggles for life above; to kill, free  or take captive the enemy prisoner.  Above all else there is the underlying  theme of which there can be no right answer: to sacrifice many to save one,  to return one child to its mother.
Spielberg's second task was to  present these themes in a way that we human beings could understand.  Similar to his Schindler's List, Spielberg uses some of the attributes of  documentary to tell his story and for this, the film's five Academy awards  are well won.  The jerky camera shot, the immensely telling sound and  special visual effects, the snappy editing place us in the action.  We  become just another member of Captain Miller's squad looking for somewhere  to fire, to shelter, to prey, and to breath.
With Spielberg shocking and  provoking us, his third task was to haunt us.  The movie's memorable  opening and closing scenes will always linger in our thoughts.  Those  images are so raw they leave our emotions punch drunk, singeing that area  of the brain where reason and moderation reside.  The blisters will take  some time to heal which is how Spielberg might have wanted it to be.  With  a new century upon us, some of us might be tempted to think that war is  straightforward, always winnable, good for the character and national  spirit, much as some of our ancestors thought of war at the beginning of  the 20th century.  Spielberg's genius is that he has left us with a  joltingly fresh reminder of war and it terrors.  Especially for our  leaders, war will always provide more questions than answers, and questions  of the most terrible kind at that.",958867200,8,2973,4.744094488188976
1242996,5,B00000K3AM,"The first time I watched this film, it blew me away. It is an awesomely powerfull and moving film which keeps up the intensity for the whole 3 hours. I can't fault the acting in any way. It was absolutly flawless. Tom  Hanks, as usual was supurb, he did a remarkable job of fitting the  character of a hardened war captain.
The effects also were stunning. Its  this which sets the film in a different league to all the other war films.  Especially the beach landing scene, how they managed that still amazes  me.
Thoughout the film there is good character development as the team  start to bond in the face of grave danger. The theme about where the  captain came from is a nice touch. Also, I liked the individual quirks of  each character, you could use these to identify with them. For example, at  the beginning, on the boat. Capt. Miller's hand was shaking and the sniper  kissed his cross. These, idiosincrasises are used later on.
All the way  through the film you are made aware that this isn't just a film about war.  It is about deeper things. For example at the bridge, the translater is  literally the weak link in the chain which makes them fall apart.
It is  an epic film which fully deserves all the oscars that it got. My ONLY  slight critism is that it is possible a little too Americain.",958867200,3,1305,4.42436974789916

I love this movie and when tell people that they  seem to think that all I like it for is the blood and gore.  But this movie  is about all the pain and suffering that people and families had to endure  for our freedom.  Another reason that I love this movie is because it  really shows how hard war is on people and soldiers especially.  Also I'm a  kid and so I've spent a fair amount of time playing guns and war but this  film really made me think.  Bottom line this movie is great.",958780800,3,657,4.023255813953488
1242998,3,B00000K3AM,"While parts of this film are brilliant, it also contains flaws that are hard to ignore. The first fifteen minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"" were simply astonishing in their realism and in their historical flavor. I was not only riveted to my seat when I saw the beach-landing scene, but I was riveted for the rest of the night and the next morning. It was all I could think about.
The opening beach landing scene only contained two errors that I could think of. First, none of the officers would have worn metal rank insignia on their helmets or uniforms. That would make them easy targets for snipers. Second, it was a little too optimistic (albeit necessary for the plot) to have all of Tom Hanks' principle troops survive the landing and to have them do so in complete possession of their weapons. After reading Stephen Ambrose's D-Day book, I think a more likely scenario would have been to have at least three of the characters we know and love die immediately, and to have the rest arrive on the beach, wet, shocked, dumb founded and without weapons. Most likely they would have taken shelter by the sea wall and waited all day long until a break through company relieved them. But I understand that this is, after all, a movie and Spielberg could only take realism so far. One thing he did that I absolutely loved was to imitate the film quality of Frank Capra's original D-Day photos.
The rest of the film, unfortunately, was your standard, action-packed war story. In fact, much of it was ripped off from other war films. For example:
1. The sniper scene: ""Full Metal Jacket"".
2. The defense of the bridge: ""A Bridge Too Far"".
3. The death of Captain Miller: ""The Sands of Iwo Jima"".
I also thought the generation distribution in the beginning and end of the movie was a bit unrealistic. James Ryan is a WWII vet, which would put him in his seventies or eighties, yet his children all appeared to be the children of baby boomers. Maybe he remarried or got a little wild in the sixties. But wouldn't that contradict the dying Captain Miller's syrupy exhortation to be a good man and earn his survival?
I still enjoyed the film and commend Spielburg for its ground breaking opening salvo.",958608000,2,2194,4.599489795918367

There some sort of story about finding Matt Damon on a bridge or something, but for the most part Speilberg just made a bunch of war scenes  and decided to use them to tell an only semi anti-war movie but mostly just  a sympathy movie for vets of WWII.  The acting is great, but as a movie  this doesn't come close to Platoon, Apocalypse Now, or Full Metal Jacket.

I have to admit, I am a little tired of Spielberg's  love of sappy music and scenes where the sole purpose is to make people  cry. The graveyard scenes that frame the movie, for example, don't really  ring true when you realize how undeveloped the relationship between Captain  Miller and Private Ryan is in the film, but the scene is somehow moving, in  an artificial way.  Also, the characters don't seem to bond during the film  as is often noted in reviews, their devotion to one another being  manifested mainly in covering each others backs in the battle scenes.  Also, there a few gratuitous political points, noted in a previous review,  that detract from the overall objectivity of this film.  If I want to be  taught a lesson by Steven Spielberg, I'll write him a letter and ask him.  Watch the movie for its fighting scenes though.  They are terrific.",958348800,3,1031,4.521739130434782

When I saw this film the first  time,I thought of only two things. Did gud gave us this earth to destroy it  or to live on it, and the Saving of Private Ryan was one decent example for  the mankind that taought us that we should love each other and even to  sucrify our lives for the love ones. The story of the film did brought back  to me the hope which I have lost. The hope of having decent freinds and  colleagues which they are there when you need them and they are ready to  give you anything for nothing. To appreciate the value of the brotherhood,  freindship and partnership. I feel that this film did convyed the massage  that life is still full of ""good guys"", it is only a matter of  how good those guys are! and I feel that was the crack of the matter in  this film. I've seen the film  ""Saving Private Ryan"" for more  than 31 times! and I don't mine to watch it for another 31 times more...and  this is a fact which some of my colleagues can not beleive it!
One last  thing if I may add. As I am one of loyal admirer and fan of Tom Hanks and  Steven Spielberg, I think that this film would never succeeded without  them.

1243006,5,B00000K3AM,"I was expecting a lot from Saving Private Ryan. It was released in Australia months after the US launch and so, I had plenty of time to read the reviews, watch the trailers and hear folks talking about it on-line.  The frightening thing was, that almost everyone was raving about it; not  just high praise, but rabid enthusiasm. So I was hoping it would be  wonderful and at the same time trying not to mortgage my future enjoyment.  It's happened before; an otherwise good film is still disappointing because  the hype had led me to expect a great film.

Well, I needn't have  worried. ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a great film but that is not  why it can't be hurt by expectations. It makes a beautiful flanking  maneuver around any prediction or, for that matter, any description. I knew  the plot, the actors, most of the events and still I was not prepared for  the film's effect.

After watching ""Saving Private Ryan"",  a friend described it as ""Horrific"". He was right. But it wasn't  horrific in the way, for example, the bombing of Dresden was. It was  horrific in a very personal way. Spielberg manages to breath the same air  as the men fighting in Europe. Oh bugger... I don't even know why I'm  trying to describe it. The task is beyond me. Perhaps writing a synopsis  will help to free my tongue.

""Saving Private Ryan"" has an  interesting story. I think I would have wanted to see it even without the  hoopla. Imagine a family of four brothers, all serving during the war but  in separate divisions and different parts of the world. Four service stars  hang in their mother's window and everything is ripe for a future of heroic  deeds and tearful homecomings. But somewhere in the thick of the D-Day  invasion, three of the four Ryans are killed. The remaining brother's  situation is not known with surety but it is certain that he has been  dropped behind enemy lines.

Don't you want to know what will happen  to the last Ryan brother? Do some of you want to comfort his mother or  perhaps help the last Ryan in some way? In this case, help is sent from  above. Initiated by a nostalgic general who seems to believe that saving  Private Ryan is akin to saving his whole family; and protecting American  families is every soldier's purpose. Whether this view is shared by the men  he commands, is not considered, and by the end of the film, not at all  clear.

Eight men are chosen to perform this duty. Eight very real  people. During the course of the film we get to know each of them  intimately and when death comes to some of them, it is a very personal,  shocking thing. Death and general mayhem is graphically portrayed  throughout the film. It is done so well that you are forced to believe all  other visions of war you have been shown, are vague shadows of the true  horror. But for the eight men we travel with, death is not something that  can be excused. I wanted to save each of them. I wanted to rename the film,  ""Saving Miller's Company"".

But in the end, as with  life, we don't get to rewrite the script. Captain Miller and his men don't  have many choices. They follow orders, not because they understand or agree  with them, but because it is necessary. They are not supermen with bulging  biceps, Sten guns in their hands and knives held in their teeth. They are  hero's and demons and everything in between.

I am only just  managing to stop myself from writing an article about war, its stupidity  and inevitability. Save me the effort. Go and see ""Saving Private  Ryan"". If you held off because of the violence, see it any way. It's  the closest thing I've seen to a fitting warrior's epitaph since ""All  Quiet on the Western Front"".

Steven Speilberg has effectively created an image that should haunt anyone who sees it.  As I watched this movie for the first time, I realized that most of the soldiers that gave their life for freedom were younger than I.  I could not imagine the fear that must have occupied these brave souls' hearts moments before the invasion.  I'm grateful for the sacrifice that they made, and I wonder if I could possibly make the same sacrifice.  I like to think that I could, but there's no way to know for sure until you're presented with the opportunity.  Thanks to these brave men, I'll probably never be presented with that opportunity. The other day, I saw a display that asked for money to fund a memorial to honor these brave soldiers.  I gave every penny that I had in my pocket, a sum that amounted to about six dollars.

(no harm here, just a fact) It's incredible how  such gifted actors as Hanks and Sizemore accept to play dumb characters  with no depth at all, only for the pleasure of the ""experience""  to work along Spielberg, who is the ultimate Master of Marketing, nothing  more than that (exception - ""SCHINDLER'S LIST"" - even in this one  at certain mments he tried to be the false sentimentalist again).",957312000,8,863,4.6490066225165565

There is  nothing glamorous or glorious about war, and ""Saving Private  Ryan"" drives this point home quite effectively.  I'm a woman.  I don't  know what it would be like to march straight into the jaws of death with a  piece of cold steel in my hands.  I'm a young woman.  I've never had to  kiss my father, brother, son, or fiance for perhaps the last time and sent  him off to face the horrors of ever-present fear, killing, and the constant  loss of friends and comrades.
Could anyone return from battle  unchanged?  Could any individual remain intact body, mind and soul?  It's a  testament to the bravery, skill and intelligence (and sometimes cowardice)  of soldiers that anyone can survive war. My great-uncles and my Dad served  in the armed services before I was born.  I didn't know my second-cousins  before they returned from Viet Nam.  My brother-in-law commanded tanks  during Desert Storm.  I've been lucky; I haven't been called upon to make  the incredible sacrifice of the life of someone I dearly love in order to  ensure the freedoms I enjoy as an American.  Other individuals, other  families, have paid that price for me.  To them I am tremendously  grateful.
""Saving Private Ryan"" offers as close a look at real  combat as one could get without picking up a gun oneself.  The movie has  some terrific special effects and is well-paced and tells a gripping story  of courage, sacrifice and devotion to duty.  The film merits its  ""R"" rating.  It is not a movie that should be seen by children at  all.  The battle scenes are simply too graphic and too bloody.  No words  can explain to a child why a man would pick up a weapon and kill another  man whom he's never met.  Children cannot understand war--and neither can  many adults.
The characters in ""Saving Private Ryan"" are  true-to-life, completely believable, and the dialogue in keeping with the  WWII era.  This is a very well-made movie and every actor in it turns in a  superior performance.  There is not a half-hearted effort on the part of a  single actor (or actress) in the cast.
Watching this film, I had to  think:  as our technology has improved, have the results of warfare changed  or improved?  Gaping holes are still blown through the bodies of strong,  brave young men, whether the weapons employed are muskets, cannons, rifles,  or machine guns.  I pray that our servicemen continue to demonstrate the  bravery and loyalty that led previous generations to fight our battles with  honor--and that our leaders, political and spiritual, have the wisdom and  integrity to carefully choose those battles which are truly worth the  sacrifice of the precious lives of those who fall on the battlefield.",957139200,11,2977,4.730844793713163

But really and truly I ask you, is it really a surprise to anyone that war is dark and  ugly and violent and horrible? Did we really need Spielburg to show us that  on screen? No.
Now the rest. Why is this being hailed as a masterpiece?  What was masterful? The blood and the guts? The graphic violence?
The  entire plot - the philosophical question of several men dying to save one  man is hardly original. And that question could have been asked and  answered without the graphic depctions of violence.
The on screen  violence made my physically ill, to the point where I had to leave the  theatre for a few moments to regain my composure.

1243019,5,B00000K3AM,"To be granted such an intimate and horrific look at one of the most pivotal moments in the history of this world, the D-Day invasion of the beaches at Normandy, provides us with a stark and brutal look at one of the  last campaigns of World War II. It deconstructs the myths associated with  how we look at WWII, that there is no glory in killing or being killed, but  instead a horrible failure of ourselves as human beings. At the same time,  however, there was a need, a dire need to remove Hitler and fascist tyranny  that he and the Nazis threatened to spread across Europe and possibly the  world. It was a battle of ideologies and it was a conflict of good vs.  evil.
 Saving Private Ryan is fictional, up to an after the events of  June 6th, 1944, but at the same time, the fact it isn't an adaptation or  the retelling of an actual event is irrelevant. From the beginning of an  elderly James Ryan on his knees before the crosses and Stars and David at  Normandy, we see the war as if it were real and in color. Speilberg's use  of lens used by photographers at the time gives the film a decidedly  gritty, almost primitive look that only enhances the assault to the senses.  The violence, however accurate, takes on surreal form all its own. The  explosions that removes limbs or destroys the body completely only  accentuates the fact that the human body was not meant for conflict of this  scale. This isn't some 1950's or 60's John Wayne war movie where the hero  takes a bullet and can keep going, more likely the hero gets shot goes into  shock and probably dies. The horror of war is as real as the film makers  could have made it. You feel for the characters and when they die, you  share the loss.
 The story is simple and unbelievable, but like so  many things in World War II, stranger things have happened. Captain John  Miller (Tom Hanks) of the 2nd Rangers is asked to go deep into France in  order to recover Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), the last of four brothers  in the war and the last one still alive. Ryan, a part of the 101st Airborne  Regiment and just one of thousands of misdrops and got lost all over  France. Miller leads a small party of eight men-who would really rather not  be doing this. It causes them to question their orders and Captain Miller  who must maintain the order amidst the chaos of the war around. And this is  what is depicted all through out the film- confusion and the fog of war;  where no matter how good your plans are or how well trained your people  are, once the fighting start, those plans go straight to hell.
 I  think Saving Private Ryan might be the most important film of the 20th  Century-it has no equals, even in Darryl Zanuck's 1962 D-Day epic The  Longest Day. It strips away the Hollywood glory of war and the perceived  notions many of us have. It is a companion piece to Spielberg's Holocaust  epic, Shindler's List. A teacher friend of mine-at the high school level  actually has students who haven't even heard of World War II. School  teachers in the US, Canada and Britain need to show this to their students  on a yearly basis so that they can at least have some idea of what  happened. We need to remember this, the Holocaust, and everything  associated with World War II for a very long time.",956448000,5,3280,4.3933333333333335

The first 30 minutes are gun-wrenching and powerful, and if you have a weak  stomach, skip the first few scenes. The plot, however unrealistic it may  be, suits the 8 characters well. Saving Private Ryan, in short,  is the  most realistic war film ever made. For the ""Thin Red Line""  addicts out there, ""Thin Red Line"" was great, but it was just an  ANTI-war film with poetic overtones. ""Line"" was well made, but  fell short. If you are looking for a definitive documentary of WWII, buy  this movie. THere are a few unrealistic or wooden points in this movie, but  besides those few parts, it is a perfect, well-acted, realistic, war film.",956448000,3,782,4.568345323741007

It's also a wonderful character study, especially Tom Hanks' Capt. Miller, who so epitomizes the kind of ""civilian soldier"" who was so important  to the winning of that war, the kind of officer who doesn't care about  promotions or covering his butt or getting his ticket punched, whose only  concern is getting the job done the best way it can be done and getting the  hell out of there in one piece, back to his wife and his career and the  ""real"" world - exactly the sort of officer who was so  conspicously missing 20 years later in Vietnam. (Hanks almost certainly  would have won an Oscar for this, except there was no way the Academy was  going to give him 3 Oscars in the same decade, no matter how deserving.)  Anyone who has had a relative in combat, especially W.W.II, should force  themselves to watch this movie, at least once, just to see, just to get a  small glimpse, of what it was really like.",956361600,2,1053,4.460732984293194

This movie really touches me after each viewing.  There is not to  many movies that can do that.  The DVD is the greatest. Top notch quality.  And a very fitting interactive menus.

1243028,5,B00000K3AM,"Director Steven Spielberg continues to make movie magic with the breathtaking war drama ""Saving Private Ryan"". After the historic D-Day invasion, Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) and his men embark across enemy lines to find Private James Ryan who's awarded a return trip home after news that his three brothers have been killed in combat. ""Saving Private Ryan"" is an astonishing, edge-of-your-seat war spectacle of courage and triumph over incredible odds. Director Steven Spielberg combines amazing visual images and powerful human emotions to create such a moving masterpiece. ""Saving Private Ryan"" includes fine performance by Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Tom Sizemore and Tom Hanks in another award-winning role. Its visual effects, thrilling action sequences and realistic backgrounds elevate the film's excitement and sheer intensity. The 1998 war drama opens with a breathtaking recreation of D-Day that could best be described as the most realistic and stunning war sequence in film history. ""Saving Private Ryan"" won five Academy Awards and inspired the award-winning television miniseries ""Band of Brothers"".

Spielberg's spectacular war drama gets a decent DVD presentation. The award-winning masterpiece is presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD contains an excellent picture quality with superb color detail and great resolution. The Dolby Digital 5.1 sound delivers a powerful home theater experience. Unfortunately, the DVD lacks any worthy extras. It only special features the 25-minute ""Into the Breach"" behind-the-scenes featurette, a short 2-1/2 minute introduction to the film by director Steven Spielberg, two theatrical trailers, production notes and cast and filmmakers' biographies.

1243030,5,B00000K3AM,"First, I want to say that for some reason some people are confused as to what films Steven Spielberg has made. People in this column seem to believe that Spielberg has made Star Wars, Forrest Gump, and the Goonies. Well they  need to get their information right.  Saving Private Ryan has a realistic  story due to the fact that it was based on real life incidents. Some people  believe that it was over patriotic and made the Germans look ignorant. I  disagree, the Germans were more than conpetent, you can tell from the  opening scenes were the Germans slaughtered 2,500 Americans at Omaha. The  sound and the visual effects are extremely impressive and at times I felt  like I was in the middle of it all. The acting was not academy award  winning performance but it was convincing enough. This movie was cheated  out of the best picture of the year award, needless to say I feel that it  was one of the best pictures of all time, and should become a classic.",955411200,3,962,4.502890173410405

Although Spielberg does an excellent job of replicating a wartime scenario, he does not utilize it as  a vehicle to promote understanding an any way. By endeavoring to create a  ""War"" move, whatever that means, it is the director's  responsibility to treat it with care and maturity. With the inconsistent  directing style and wooden performances of the actors, the only thing that  seems to be spent on this movie is a lot of money (as upposed to time and  thought.) If you wish for a better understanding of human nature and  intellectualism in the Wartime setting, try Apocalypse Now, The Thin Red  Line, or perhaps the first half of Full Metal Jacket, made by directors  that know what they are doing.",955411200,12,826,4.76056338028169
1243032,4,B00000K3AM,"After repeated viewings of this film, I've come to the conclusion that this film is really two films in one. The first film is a thoughtful, powerful and grim view of US Infantrymen in WWII. Here soldiers fight and  die with a speed and, even more powerfully, a casualness that I don't think  has ever duplicated in film history since the original, 1931 version of  AQOTWF.  These scenes of men at war have all the more impact, since there  is none of the stupid gratuitousness of the ""60's"" and  ""70's"" in the graphicness at work here,i.e. slow motion blood  spurts, etc. Though the overall premiss of this film is a streching of  history, the strength of the men who make up the Infantry Squad make it  seem believable, most of time.  The second film is as phoney and artifical  a depiction of war that hasn't been seen by a US audience since John  Wayne's THE GREEN BERETS. Here men talk aloud while scouting behind enemy  lines, stack arms and cache their weapons although they are cut-off for  days by enemy troops, and officers condemn the decisions of their superiors  while standing in front of enlistedmen. What a shame a man with all the  billions at his disposal as Spielberg felt it was nescessary to include so  many ""WWII"" movie contrivancies while paying tribute to the  ""WWII"" generation. The one only gives insult to the many  sacfifices made by the other.  It would seem a line from Shakespeare would  do well here:""...THOU HAS CUT MY HEART IN TWAIN...THROW AWAY THE WOSER  HALF AND LIVE ALL THE BETTER WITH THE OTHER"". Even with these and  other flaws, seeing this film in a theatre, during its intial release, was  probably the most power film experience I've had since my teen years. The  tragedy of this film is that,with Spielberg's finances,it could have been  the greatest film about war ever made instead of merely a great war film.",955411200,2,1858,4.657407407407407

1243034,5,B00000K3AM,"Spielberg did a fantastic job of portraying WWII. He and his team did an outstanding job of getting the feel with out actually being there. Every soldier, Marine, etc. and especially the veterans of D-Day agree.  Despite  little inaccuracies, such a the characters talking while moving through  enemy territory,  which were purposely put in for character developement, I  fould the film gripping. It made me shake in the theater.  Mr.  Spielberg's crew got the slang down pat. For example in the film the Army  Air Corps is referred to as the Air Force.  Ask any veteran of that time  period and he'll confirm it, they called the Army Air Corps the Air Force.  The planes had very authentic paint jobs, even the Germans spoke German.  I especially liked the way Capt. Miller was portrayed by Tom Hanks, just a  citizen soldier doing his job so that he could just go home, while making  sure that others could too.  I wish all commanders were like him.  Honest,  faithful and just doing his job, by obtaining the objective at hand and not  looking to be promoted. The other actors were great as well.  I also  noticed that the ""extras"" did a wonderfull job too!.  When I  first saw this film there was not a dry eye in the theater, especially the  veterans were moved to tears.

In this movie, the battle sequences are the best  ever made. It showed naive people (because I think few people needed to see  this movie to know that war is hell) how it was, using sheds of blood.

The Germans always being outsmarted by Captain Miller. I must  say the Germans didn't shoot back very often in the movie. In reality the  Germans had machine guns in World War 2 and used them. This movie doesnt  give the Germans the respect they deserve. They kept the Allies box in at  Normandy for weeks after D-Day and this movie portrays them as unorganised  rabble which was not the case, the total opposite.

The movie is filled to the brim  with so much Hallmark Hall of Fame-ish sentimentality it's hard to watch.  Spielberg's new style is a bunch of cut and paste work.  Ripping off much  greater directors, particularly Kubrick and Lean (both have made much  better anti-war movies), and processing it into a package that the  mainstream will lap up.  I will say that the blood, guts, and shells did  make me seem like I was there (for better or worse).  That's about all  there is that's good about this movie.  The screenwriter deserves a slap in  the head.  I really don't want him to work in that town again.

The film itself sends a message that sometimes war is necessary, no matter how horrible.  The film shows the sacrifice made by  Young Americans who fought for the freedom of ""strangers"" half a  world away.  The acting is top notch, with ""Oscar Worthy""  performance by almost the entire cast and with particularity another Great  performance by Tom Hanks.  The DVD itself is the best you will own for  both sound and picture.  I own both the Dolby Digital and DTS editions, you  can't go wrong with either but there is a difference.  If you own a  surround set up with DTS Decoding, then buy the DTS version.  While the  Dolby Digital is better than any other DVD I own, the DTS still blows it  away.  The Dolby Digital has a muted sound to it and the sounds sometimes  tend to bounce around between the surrounds and right/left fronts.  The DTS  version, however, creates a total 360 surround expierience.  The bass is  where the DTS version really pays off, at the end of Chapter 9, when bombs  are exploding as the soldiers leave the church, you can feel the boms  explode it in your seat; while the Dolby Digital version sounds muted.  Once again, the DTS version shines, as the Panzer tanks enter the town at  the end of Chapter 15 and the beginning of Chapter 16.  In the Dolby  Digital version, the tanks sound almost far off in the distance, while in  the DTS version the tanks seem closer and you can almost FEEL the soldier's  fear as they approach.  In conclusion if you have the right set up, get  the DTS version the audio gets 5 out of 5 stars. The audio of the Dolby  Digital gets 4.8 out of 5 stars.

I had serious trepidation about that. Even an ardent  war film lover such a I wasn't sure I could endure the big screen version  of what I had only read about briefly in the reviews. But I said  ""sure.""
The theater was packed and we had taken out seats in  the middle row. With popcorn and soda firmly in hand, I was set to enjoy a  nice evening at the movies. I hadn't been to the theater in many years and  it felt good just being there with its ambiance.
But into the first 25  minutes of SPR, everything changed. My everyday world shattered. My  visceral senses had been pulverized. My popcorn and soda became  non-entities. And by the time the film concluded I had been changed  forever. No need to tell you why. Chances are, if you're reading this you  already know why.
As long as I live, I shall not forget that evening in  any way. Since then I own a big screen TV and stereo system as well as the  DVD version of SPR. I have seen the film many times, but I tell you, there  is nothing to compare with experiencing SPR in the thearer. The sheer power  of the audio, combined with the stunning visual elements in the theater  environment is incomparable.

Real people did not spend their free moments between death and mayhem philosophising about the existential meaning of existence, that would have made death pleasurable by comparison. Also, the contrived plot devices (the shaky hands of Tom Hanks, among other things) nearly drive this movie into the ground. It's as if Spielberg said ""Hey, let's do something to make the audience relate to the character again, I think we're losing them. I know! Let's do the shaky hands thing again!"" Granted, visually, it's disturbing, the first 20 minutes are enough to make you ill (if you can get past the cheap bait-the-viewer trick Spielberg does, also totally unnecessary), but the acting and dialogue are worthy of the 40's serial war films (You know: ""I'll do it for Ace, and Little joe and stinky!"") Spielberg historically oversentimentalizes and cheapens incredible films in order to try and force meaning on them and 'gasp', yes, even make them more marketable to the masses who don't quite get Kubrick films. If only he'd do art for art's sake, he could be Fellini or Bergman. You want to see a movie that truly captures the cold, surreal, impersonal aspects of war without forcing a mantra a reason for it, see 'Full Metal Jacket' and think about how that film, with it's sparsness of violence in comparison, pulls of a much better effect. The real horror of war is not that you kill hundreds of faceless Germans, but that you kill one person, and their face never leaves your mind.

The first twenty minutes shock the audiance and show in depth the horrors of the American landing on Omaha beach on june the 6th 1944.  Speilberg is the first director to give audiances a glimpse of the brutal  realitys of war without making the film a gratuatist shoot em up action.  The film set around the d-day landings is about a squad of men sent behind  enemy lines to find a private James Ryan (Matt Damon)who has lost all 3 of  his brothers who have been killed in combat. But during the search the  squad struggle to find decency during the confusion of war, they come  accross such hard decisions to make as whether to kill a POW,whether to  take out a german emplacement,and whether to take Ryan home or whther to  help him defend a bridge. A tremendous performance from Tom Hanks who stars  as Captain John Miller the leader of the squad and his men ,Sergeant  Horvath (Tom Sizemore),Private Reiben (Edward Burns)Private Jackson (Barry  Pepper) and a few more. Spedded up footage, juddering images,faded colour  so the film looks old and hand held camera use all contribute to making the  film nervous to look at.

1243051,5,B00000K3AM,"A few have criticized the movie for showing only the Americans fighting the Germans, but lets keep in mind that this film follows an American fighting unit. The scope of the story being told is too limited to show  everyone nationality that fought the Germans. Remember that this is just  one story of WW2, not an epic depiction of the war. Also, I enjoyed this  movie much more than the Thin Red Line, which felt like a Vietnam movie set  in the WW2 era. I mean, was EVERY soldier in the Pacific theater as sullen  and cynical as the characters in TRL? Most wars this century have been  pointless and stupid, but this was was different. As a nation we fought not  to gain territory and expand our empire, but to save the world from the  darkness of dictatorship. We may have had our faults (Japanese internment  camps for one), but Hitler's regime was evil of a scale that I doubt we  will ever see again. I know it sounds jingoistic, but there is no other way  to describe the German government of the time. I see Vietnam and Korea as  stupid, bloody wastes of American lives, and the moral issues of the Gulf  war trouble me, but I am proud of what our nation did in World War II and  proud of the verterans who fought in it and gave their lives for a better  (though still imperfect) world.",953856000,5,1294,4.333333333333333

I really hate the whole idea of war! And I guess I saw this movie as a  great tribute to those who fought and died in the WW2! I think the choice  of this particular perspective of a small group of solders asked to save  one man was perfect in showing viewers the questions solders actually  constantly obsessed about during the war! it really gives us an inkling of  how difficult it is to understand meaning of war, what you had to  sacrifice! I mean the awful choices that had to be made! trying desperatly  to believe what they're doing is right?

1243058,5,B00000K3AM,"In ""Saving Private Ryan"", Spielberg paints a hauntingly painful picture of how precious every life is, and how important it is that we never forget the men and women who died for the ""last just war.""  As the World War II generation begins to pass away we are reminded at how  great a sacrifice these men and women made in order for us to enjoy the  freedoms we have today.  Tom Hanks plays a convincing ""everyman""  as Captain Miller in that it could have been any of us, just an ordinary  person (an English teacher in this case), trying to do his job to the best  of his ability.  The movie is cut in the mold of ""It's A Wonderful  Life"".  And the message is the same from both, life is a precious  gift.  We must never forget the impact that one person, whether a Captain  Miller or a George Bailey, has on the rest of mankind.  Sadly, both  ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""It's A Wonderful Life""  missed out on the Oscar for best picture of their respective years.

It is the kind of  film that I could not stop thinking about hours, even days after I first  witnessed this true masterpiece.  A true reflection of the films depth is  the beach massacre at the begining of the film, and how they managed to  sustain the high level of realism and entertainment throughout was  incredible.

1243061,5,B00000K3AM,"First, I agree with all that see this film as a technical masterpiece.  The battle scenes, sound, hand-held camera work, and other special effects are incomparable.
Many of the historical facts are astoundingly  accurate as well.  If you review the battle plan for Omaha you will see  that the 2nd Ranger Battalion hit the beach at Dog Green Sector in the  first wave and that they were ""right where they were supposed to be but  no-one else was"" (all the other first wave groups landed at the wrong  place).  You will also see that the DD tanks at Omaha were supposed to land  first but they all ""foundered in the channel"".  It was also necessary for  the engineers to blow the obstacles fast because the tide rises at one inch  per minute in Normandy.  Bangalore torpedoes WERE used to blow the wire  behind the seawall.  Dog-1 Exit IS right near Vierville. The details are  almost all perfect.
The character development I would call sparse.  I  have the film on DVD and having seen certain scenes many times so now I  feel the character development is superb - but of course if you have to see  it over and over then that is a problem!
I do think that the impact of  the film goes far beyond just the ""tactical"" elements of the plot and  characters.  As I watch it, I do feel a sense of awe and wonder that these  men would do what they did on D-day (and all the battles of the war).  While our British friends will no doubt be offended by this, there is  something unique about the young Americans we see in the opening scene in  the Higgins boats - men who have come from 5,000+ miles away to save people  they do not even know from an evil that is far from their homes. The film  presents this uniquely American mystery to us - not only in the opening  scene, but in my opinion, throughout the entire 2.5 hours.
I must comment  on the ""absurdity"" of the plot.  There were four brothers in WW2  that closely approximate the Ryan brothers' fictional scenario.  The real  life Niland brothers were all in the army - 2 died at Normandy, one died in  Asia and one was in the airborne and was dropped behind lines on D-Day.  The War Department pulled the fourth brother out when they learned this  (this is an historical fact).
I must also make a positive comment about  John Williams' score, especially the final ""Hymn for the Fallen"".  When I  hear the voices of the Tanglewood Chorus rising over the final credits I  think back to the doomed men of the Higgins boats about to be splattered by  bullets and I get the feeling that this overwhelming choral sound is the  sound of their souls rising up off of that beach like a shock wave to drive  back the evil that had taken root in Europe.  This is a fine piece of music  that does honor to these men.  Yet even these ""perfect"" men were shown to  not be so perfect in the scenes of surrendering Germans being gunned down  by angry American troops.
I also can't omit the great and oft-overlooked  performance of Tom Sizemore as Sargeant Mike Horvath.  He merges into the  background as a 'leader of grunts'.  ""We're in business! ""
I  can't close without making one major criticism of this film.  I feel the  film is badly marred by the maudlin final scene.
Its still an outstanding  film and one that haunts me to this day.  I have the soundtrack CD and its  great.  I also highly recommend Steven Ambrose's ""D-day"" book and  General Omar Bradley's book ""A Soldier's Story"" if you really  want to understand the details behind D-Day.",952128000,23,3485,4.424722662440571

I cried so much at the end that I used up all the tissue. I think about the solders every day  now that I have seen this movie. My friends know me as the war freak. No  offense to modern teenagers, but most of them couldn't give a great big  sh#* about the sacrificing of the veterns in this war. This movie is a  great movie to show teenagers what war is like. The first thirty minutes is  hell. The plot-line fits right into it. The character development is great.  The F/X are the best I have seen in all my life.

The movie is graphic by necessity.  Anything less would insult  those who fought, as if by diminishing the horror we would diminish their  sacrifice.
The film provides a glimpse into the hell that is war.  But,  it not so much condemns war as exalts the men who fought, died, or survived  only to be haunted by their experiences.
As filmmaking, the movie is  unsurpassed.  You feel the adrenaline, the terror, the fear, the confusion.  It is fast paced, remarkable storytelling.  First rate all the way.",951955200,,660,4.803571428571429
1243064,5,B00000K3AM,"Two generations have grown up since the D Day landings. Steven Spielberg has done society a tremendous service in vividly bringing to life the horrors we have been spared. Those moments which would have died from  memory with the men who endured them in 1944 are made real again - within  the confines of the silver screen.
This film deserves much of the  criticism it has received  regarding the story and script. For instance,  the clumsy device of bracketing the narrative's start and finish as an old  man's flashback at the cemetery is saccharine, and especially annoying to  British viewers (although perhaps necessary context for young Americans).  But to dwell on these quibbles is to miss the point. Spielberg has created  a masterpiece of cinematography, not of literature, and more than any other  contemporary film I've seen he uses the medium to the full. Attention to  detail is astounding - listen out for the eerily convincing sound effects  of bullets on steel girders in the opening landing scene.
Above all, you  finish this movie convinced that what you've seen reflects meticulous  research in reconstructing participants' accounts of real events - and  technical brilliance in making it real. One to keep forever.",951868800,3,1235,5.074626865671642
1243065,5,B00000K3AM,"This movie floored me.  I've seen a fair amount of WW2 movies in my time, some cheesy, some well-executed.  Never have I seen a movie that fully brought home how horrific the experience must have been.  ""Saving  Private Ryan"" brought home at the very least a fraction of what the  war must have been like for those who fought it.
There was indeed a lot  of gore... I wouldn't say it was inappropriate, given the subject matter.  Sanitized war movies leave us with the mistaken impression that war is a  clean, cut-and-dried experience.
The film was brilliantly acted as well  as beautifully shot.  Hanks turns in yet another Oscar-level performance,  and his supporting cast did at least as well as he did.  I spent the entire  movie with my jaw on the floor, alternately marveling over the horrors of  war, the realism, and the quality of the film itself.
It's not for  everyone... my Dad's a WW2 buff, but I wouldn't reccommend this to him.  I  suggest those of you who cringe easily at TV violence steer clear.  But the  beauty of ""...Ryan"" is undeniable.  It outlines the twisted paths  we follow in war, the way young men grow old overnight in the trenches and  the way nothing is as it seems when you scrutinize it up close.
I give  ""...Ryan"" five stars, and I also reccommend ""Courage Under  Fire"" for what feels like an honest depiction of the Gulf war.",951868800,4,1361,4.551867219917012

The scene where the captain  is spouting abraham lincoln comes across as crass and artificial, thousands  of soldiers have just died and the entire chief of staff takes a break to  discuss the death of one soldier. Then we get a dewy eyed glimpse of  farmland america complete with white picket fences and billowing corn  fields.

Fear of dying, fear for having so many lives depend on you. Did  you make the right choices? I have seen many great war movies, but this one  is special. I have always honored our men who have fought in war for our  freedom and safety. But this show takes you on a journey into what their  lives were really like while they fought for us. Decisions had to be made  under pressure, they weren't always right. Things happen so quickly you do  the best you can. The beginning was shocking to me too and my heart went  out to them. I normally don't even watch R movies. But this one was history  coming to life. This movie wasn't just about Private Ryan, it was about all  the brave men who have ever been in a war. It was history told in a  touching way. I can't say one bad thing about the making of this one. Sure  no one wants to see blood and gore anymore than those who saw it first hand  did.

  However, saying 'theres not much else'  means that one wasn't watching the film.  The (admittedly) simplistic  script is balanced by the examination of cowardice and heroism.  We see  soldiers who really aren't supposed to be in a battle field.  The  performances are all uniformly incredible.

Read ""D-Day, Day of Destiny"" by Stephen Ambrose and  you'll learn that Spielberg was not being gratuitous with the violence; he  barely scratched the surface. War is a complicated subject, and Saving  Private Ryan no doubt does not address the deeper issues surrounding World  War II. Add to this that the ending is just a bit romanticized and, in my  view, weak, and SPR cannot be considered as the last word in World War II  pictures.

Seeing them was a profoundly horrifying experience which I will never  forget.  I will never think of war the same way again after seeing those  images. Those scenes alone make the movie worth seeing.  The movie does  certainly make you truly grateful for the sacrifices made by the veterans.  However, on many other levels, the movie fails. A lot of it seems forced.  Consider the scene where Tom Hanks orders his guys to attack the German  machine gun nest.  Why would he want to do that? It makes no sense.  Why  would he decide to carry out such a risky mission considering that it would  jeopardize his main objective: finding Ryan. What if all his men were  killed? Hanks' character justifies his decision by saying that getting rid  of the nest would put other american troops passing through the area out of  harm's way. Yes, but other American troops passing through the area might  have tanks; thus, making it very easy for them to destroy the nest. Why  doesn't let Hanks' character let them take care of it instead? What if he  lost all his men?  After all doing all that and loosing one of his men,  Captain points out that his mission is about finding Ryan. If that is so,  why does he jeopardize his mission like this?  Also, the scene where Ryan  says he does not want to return and wants to stay and fight is not  convinving at all. it is too Hollywoodish for my taste.  Plus, after going  through so much to find him, the other soldiers in real life would be  furious at him for refusing to go home, yet they forgive him really fast.  Hanks decides that risking the lives of his men again to  make sure Ryan  goes back home unharmed is worth it because it is the ""only decent  thing to do in this war.""  Why? Isn't fighting for your country in  itself a pretty decent thing to do? Isn't making sure that his own men go  home unharmed also a decent thing to do? At one point Speilberg decides  give us some comic relief with a scene that involves mistaken identity.  It  totally falls flat. It is just dumb, especially considering all the killing  and gore shown prior to that scene. The epiloque is totally unneccessary  and is just Spielberg pulling the emotional  strings. It does not work  because of bad acting. Plus, the last battle scene is so powerful that all  this corny nonsense is totally useless.  To sum up, the movie is worth  seeing because it does contain many very good scenes. Again, the battles do  have a devastating impact on the viewer. But the story leaves a lot to be  desired.  The movie would have been a masterpiece if it were just about  real life expriences of a group of soldiers. I am sure there are many  fascinating autobiographies about the period.

Our WWII veterans are long overdue in terms of the  appreciation or lack thereof given by the public at large.  Unfortunately,  this film only touches on the most elemental truths about war and the many  diverse warriors who participate.

I agree with Mr.  Ambrose (the historian quoted in Into the Breach) that this film stands  alone in capturing what it was like visually in combat in World War II.  Far more than that, though, is the stunning emotional impact this film has  on those who really understand what the story is all about.  This isn't  just another war film, it will go down as the final definitive statement on  the US role in World War II and the impact it had on an entire generation -  on the battlefield and in the homes of those serving.

The battle scenes were extremely realistic and quite  elaborate in detail. While there are many warnings about how graphic this  picture is, it almost seems that there should be no age restriction on the  movie, so that everyone (of all ages) can see the horrid side of war. The  story line is a good one, though not true, it does remind you of the true  story of the Sullivan brothers (five brothers who were killed while serving  on the same navy ship in WWII). I feel the movie could have been a bit more  emotional, or played to the audience's emotions better, instead it was  oriented more toward the details of war, and less to the personalities of  the persons portrayed serving in that war.

1243085,5,B00000K3AM,"The movie Saving Private Ryan tells the story of an American army unit in the climactic part of WWII that is sent on a mission to find a soldier who has lost al of his brothers, and is to be sent home.  The problem though,  is that the soldier has been miss-dropped behind the German front-line in  the middle of the German counterattack.  Tom Hanks (Captain John H.  Miller), who takes lead role, leads his squad of soldiers who go from the  hellish landing on D-Day into the heart of the war to find Matt Damon  (Private Ryan).  Along the way, the squad experiences the many emotions  that come with war.  Fear, ""excitement,"" self-doubt, sadness, and  a period of mutiny when the soldiers begin to question the mission's  objective, and the treatment of a prisoner that killed one of the squad  members.  Eventually, the squad finds Private Ryan, but they learn very  quickly that finding Ryan, and getting him home are two, very different  things.  Making an accurate movie that reflects the true nature of war, the  oldest of human customs, is no easy task.  The opening scene, landing at  Omaha Beach, shows what horrific conditions men, some under 18, had to face  to preserve freedom.  Historically, Omaha Beach had the highest casualty  rate of the entire Normandy invasion.  Steven Spielberg portrayed this very  realistically.  Some complained about the level of gore in the movie, but  would it make any sense for the Germans and Allies to fight with cap guns?  (I may not support the argument against the level of gore in the movie, but  I do advise that young children NOT see this movie).  In any case, Saving  Private Ryan has become a classic war movie, among the ranks of Platoon,  Apocalypse Now, and Full Metal Jacket.  A tribute to those (Axis and  Allied) who died on the field of battle in the Second World War, Saving  Private Ryan is a movie that should be recognized as one of the greatest,  most compelling films of our time.",950054400,7,1951,4.651917404129794
1243086,5,B00000K3AM,"The title says it all (at least for me anyways). The best thing about this movie is that it was educational. I actually came away having greater appreciation for WW2 vets and what they had to go through. I also came to  know the importance of the battle at Normandy and what exactly was going on  during the most famous war in our history.
Turns out Private Ryan's squad  had missed their drop off point by 20 miles. 20 miles?  That sounds like a  lot doesn't it?  That gave me an idea of how poor technology was as well  as how chaotic things must have been. How many other squads missed their  marks by double digit miles?
The extra material on the DVD is great.  The footage of Spielberg's first war movies was definitely an eye opener.  He was able to create a pretty good movie with little more than his own  ingenuity and his Dad's old camera.
Spielberg's Dad served in the war and  had brought back many pictures as well as fond memories. I did not know  that Spielberg was so knowledgeable about WW2. One can really feel the  passion Spielberg puts forth from his own knowledge and memories of the  war.",949968000,,1111,4.377450980392157
1243087,3,B00000K3AM,The opening 30 mins of this film is the most horrific war footage film todate and almost worth while buying just for that. However after that the story goes nowhere. Come on sending in guys over land to rescue 1 man (and  a yank at that). Just for historys sake lads the USA only came in at the  back end of the war. Yes they help a lot in defeating the germans and the  brits could not have done it alone but not even to get a mention in the  film I personal felt was a bit of a insult.,949795200,10,487,3.84
1243088,4,B00000K3AM,"As a reviewer, I like to consider myself cynical, but tough and fair.  That is exactly why there are some moments in this movie where I rolled my eyes.  In fact, there were a lot of moments where I rolled my eyes.  Although I give credit where credit is due, and the action scenes in this film go above and beyond to draw the viewer into the heat of battle.
The intent of this film wasn't so much to entertain as it was to educate.  Everyone had a pretty good idea of how bad the war was, but they never got to see what the combat was like and this film gives them that opportunity.  In that element, it succeeds.  The acting in this is also very good.  You really can't go wrong with Tom Hanks.  If Tom Hanks were in My Bosses' Daughter, he'd make it good.  So it's really no surprise.
I try to find something wrong with every movie just to balance off all of the good and I had a field day with this one.  Whoever told Robert Rodat that he's a good writer should be flipping burgers right now.  The fact that this film got a Screenplay Oscar nomination just goes to show how bad the competition was that year.  The dialogue in this film is so weak, cheesy, patriotic, and unrealistic that it makes me wish that it was just a 30-minute short film with the opening battle scene.
I got the point of this film after I saw the man with his intestines hanging out and him screaming to the sky for his mother.  It is a brutal opening scene that is very unsettling, incredibly realistic, and masterfully done by Stevey Spielberg.  Saving Private Ryan wanted to show how bad war really is, so there really was no need to drag it out for another two hours after that.  I give the four stars to the first thirty minutes and am pretending the rest of the film doesn't exist.
Rated R.  In case you've been living under a rock for the past five years, you know how violent this movie is even if you've never seen it.  I have no idea why you'd be looking to buy the VHS anyway.  I'm really just updating an old review.  You know that there's more blood and guts than in most normal movies.  It's an effective film that's brutally real.  There's also swearing in it, but I doubt that'll be a big worry for you.",949708800,2,2196,4.193317422434368
1243089,4,B00000K3AM,"Spielberg is a director that has always used big openings to kick off his films and get the audiences attention. Witness the nightclub fight in Temple of Doom or the initial shark attack from Jaws to get a good idea of  what I'm talking about. But this is easily his best shock tactic opener  since a boulder starting chasing Indy in Raiders of the Lost Ark.
The  first twenty minutes of this film will have you ripping your teeth out as  you bite harder on your knuckles in the sheer frenzy at Omaha Beach. It's a  terrifying vision of battle that thrusts the viewer right into the heart of  combat and shows you what bullets do to a person. They do not punch nice,  neat, Hollywood holes. They maul, shred and crush their targets and the  results aren't pretty. After the opening the film settles down while  Spielberg tries to get you to care for the characters for 90 minutes before  throwing them into battle again. He succeeds but we never learn as much  about them as we really should. Hanks' Miller is a fully developed  character that will appeal to all but the others seem like shadows. He  never get to know them as much as we should and our opinions of them are  usually bulked out by what we know of similar characters from other films.  By the final hour however such details become unnecessary as Millers troops  are eventually whittled down and then topped up again by a second platoon  who we never get to meet at all. I spent a lot of the final sequence trying  to work out how many of them there were as they numbers seemed to keep  fluctuating all the time.
A lot of critics have pointed at the rather  polarised view of the war that SPR takes and they do have a point. The  Americans are shown as scared young men that are bravely putting themselves  in the way of a bullet for the cause of freedom. The Germans get treated  much less kindly and while they never stoop to the ""Evil Master  Race"" cliche often employed they're usually shown as cowardly,  snivelling, backstabbing turds. The Thin Red Line achieved better  characterisations of soldiers at war by showing the bad side of 'Good' and  the noble side of 'Evil.' For such a self claimed 'Honest' portrayal it's  very choosy about which truths it tells you. But if the characters are  stereotypes they're well written, well acted stereotypes and when Spielberg  does get around to showing the frailties of his troops he does so with  tremendous pathos. It's just a shame that he shoots himself in the foot  with his ending. After showing war as a pointless mindgrinder at the start  he then implies that a few good men can make the difference. It confuses  the theme but of course a low key ending would mess up the conventions of  war films.
SPR is better as a reminder of who we owe our freedom to  rather than a gripping cinematic vision. Don't delude yourself that your're  crying (and you will cry) for the characters on screen. You're crying for  God-knows how many thousands that died running up Omaha 60 years ago. It's  great but it's not the best. Das Boot, a GERMAN war film, holds that crown  and will continue to do so for a very long.",949622400,4,3128,4.467256637168141
1243090,3,B00000K3AM,"The beach front scene is riveting and very realistic.  It speaks well of the horror these brave men faced so many years ago.
This concept of saving Private Ryan, a paratrooper who has lost his three brothers almost  in an instant is a great motive for telling this type of story.
Remember  however, Private Ryan is a paratrooper who lands sveral miles behind enemy  lines; no day in the park.  However, he never was at nor experienced the  landing on Normandy Beach.  Therefore I ask, how can Private Ryan as a  veteran visiting the Normandy grave sites have a flash back so compelling  and realistic of that battle?  He was never there.  This is a major story  line flaw I am sorry to say.",949449600,7,690,4.475806451612903
1243091,5,B00000K3AM,"There are great movies and then there are *GREAT* movies, movies that touch you in a deeply personal way. ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a GREAT movie, a movie that left me in tears afterwards.
Why is this such a  brilliant movie? Where to begin? The direction by Steven Spielberg is  magnificent. The opening 40 minutes of the movie, the bloody U.S. landing  on Omaha Beach, is a stunning experience. Bullets whiz by, soldiers die and  it feels like you are right there!
The acting is right on as well- Tom  Hanks as Capt. Miller, the squad leader, is nothing short of brilliant. He  effortlessly captures the spirit of the men who went abroad to fight- the  guy who had a regular job back in the States and just wanted to do his duty  and get back to it. I find it hard to believe Hanks didn't win an Oscar for  this.
The music by John Williams is perfect- subtle and emotionally  heartfelt. But the story is what really works- this isn't a war movie about  blowing up a bridge, or stealing information. This is a war movie about how  awful war is. The men aren't on a mission to kill. They are on the mission  to save a life.
One of the finest movies I have ever seen in my life.  Those who loved this movie as deeply as I would be interested in reading  Tom Brokaw's ""Greatest Generation"" or Stephen Ambrose  ""Citizen Soldiers"". I recommend both.",949449600,2,1344,4.380566801619433

While it is great (especially on DVD with  surround), the movie as a whole was fantastic with some good insight into  each of the characters.  Tom Hanks was, as usual, believable and inspiring  in his role.  This movie, while full of generous doses of action, really  shows the horrors of war.  I'm not ashamed to admit I cried at the  end.

1243094,5,B00000K3AM,"There have been quite a few complaints about this film, and I find all of these comments to be quite petty and not without proper understanding before typing. This film is a magnificent testement to the sacrifices all  our figthing men in WWII made in order to ensure the freedom we have taken  for granted today. Is the film sentimental? Sure, patriotism can be quite  sentimental at times, but in the case of this film it only adds to the  emotion of this piece. Is the film excessive? No, not by all the reviews  and comments made by historians and real-life WWII soldiers saying to the  contrary. In fact, Spielberg has created one of the very few war pictures  that does not glorify the violence. The unflinching matter-of-factness of  Saving Private Ryan is a very drastic contrast from say Sands of Iwo Jima  or the Green Berets. Instead it reveals war's dirtier subtlities.  Underneath all those shrapnel explosions, Spielberg and Hanks compose real  human beings under extroadinary challenges.  The film's been criticized  for being boring within the first and last half-hours. This interlude  people we call storytelling and plot-building. The tension stays reliably  intense as our small group of troubled soldiers embark hesitantly towards  their possible destinies. Sure, Matt Damon's behavior later in the film may  be predictable. Yet, human behavior is in itself predictable. The notorious  german character with no helmet has been described as mistake; many  detractors feel letting this character be individual and easily recognized  to be too convenient. The german soldier just like Orson Welles's Rosebud  or John Ford's Monument Valley are archetpal symbols of the directors  visions. They are symbolic of the film's purpose, and are not meant to be  artistic re-treat. Each character within the film has his or her own  symbolic meaning. In Saving Private Ryan we see plenty fanatastic  characterizations from every in ths cast. The film like many other  Spielberg movies captures many aspects of old films in the same genre.  Despite the lack of violence romanticism, Spielberg has fairly familar  emsamble journey story with lots of fairly obvious personal growth  relevations sprinkled throughout. Unlike most flmmakers, it is the ciematic  storytelling of Spielberg that makes all the differece. In his best  material, he always brings startling and suprising elequence to the most  typical seeming story. One look at  the unbelievable dramaitic impact of  the film's opening Omaha Beach sequence just goes to show that when it  comes to WWII material movies  Spielberg still has it.",949276800,5,2610,5.204819277108434

Everything, from the actin to the score to the direction to the cinematography to the speical evvects to the character development to the script ect. far surpass  anything else produced in 1998.  Spielberg uses such realism that we  acutally forget that we are watching Tom Hanks, one of the most  recognizeable faces in the world today.  Hanks too deserves credit for  fitting his persona so well.  He is less the ""Gung Ho!"" John  Wayne and more the nervous Lew Ayres from ""All Quiet on the Western  Front.""  However, Jermey Davies successfully steals the show from  Hanks and other great preformances by Ed Burns, Tom Siezmore and Giovani  Ribisi (Medic Wade).  Davies shows us a sort of everyman quality; a vision  of what all of us would do had we been put under those circumstances. This  film has such a realism (despite one ""Hollywood"" plot twist) that  almost makes us tink everything is real.  Upon reminising about the film, I  can't help but ask myself ""was that really a movie?""  There is  almos a documentary flavor to this film.  The jargon the men use, the way  scenes are shot (many with hand held cameras)and the washed out color all  add to the documentary look. Speilberg's dirrection leaves the film  looking, sounding, and feelig complete.  With this film, his career will be  colmplete, it will be tough for anyone (even Speilberg) to top it.

In truth, however, over 8,000 Allied troops lost their lives that  day, compared with only 5,000 Germans. 2,000 men alone died on Omaha Beach.  While the D-Day objective for the troops landing on Omaha was to drive five  miles inland, they were stopped after about about a half a mile. The  Germans were not the incompetent poor soldiers as portrayed in some WW2  movies, they were a savagely effective fighting force. The film, does an  excellent job of removing these misconceptions. I remember walking out of  the theater after the film's conclusion and seeing several veterans  weeping, being comforted by their families. Sights such as these  immediately helped my understanding of how powerful this movie truly is. A  sight like that is powerful for anyone to see, much less an 18 year old  like me. I believe that this movie is a story that needs to be told. It is  to World War II what All Quiet on the Western Front is to World War I, and  Platoon to Vietnam. This is not a movie you should see, it is a movie you  MUST see.",947635200,42,1414,4.614457831325301

1243116,5,B00000K3AM,"Interestingly enough, the reviews that dock this movie stars are written by men and women who have never served in battle complaining about bad plot development, or one-sided story telling, or just another fuzzy Speilberg  film.  Funny however, is the fact that I have heard no World War II  veterans or even war veterans in general complain about this film's  realism, that is because this film does an excellent job of depicting what  war was like for the average soldier. Saving Private Ryan put to motion  many of the bloody accounts I have been reading since I was a 7th grader  about World War II. Reading or hearing about a shell landing several feet  away and blasting a soldier with his buddy's brains is one thing, but  actually seeing it makes one realize just exactly how bad war is. The story  was good too and touched me so much that I thanked a Korean vet for his  service to our country. After a minute or two of silence to choke back  tears, he thanked me and told me Saving Private Ryan was so real that when  the first shots were fired in the movie, he wanted to duck for fear that  the North Koreans were once again firing on him. He then told me about his  experiences during the Korean War which was enlightening and something I  will remember for a long time. This is an excellent movie and instead  complaining about its inadequaces people should go to their local veterans  center and thank those men who reside there for their willingness to die so  that we may be free. Or, are we too busy  complaining about so-called bad  movies?",947462400,4,1558,4.492857142857143

  As for the movie well Steven  has done his powerful and engrossing masterpeice. This is all you can call  this movie or film because it is a masterpeice the only downfall is that  the acadamy should have given this best picture. Well let's see them take  there mistake to the grave in this version.
  This is a film that I,  quite frankly never get tired of seeing this is the film you wan't to be  stranded with on an island. Because no matter how you see Pvt. Ryan it will  always grip you the last memerable film of the last decade and the  century. No war film will ever capture the brutal and gut wrenching horrors  of war. Steven Speilberg gives you and in your face 28 minute version of  Omaha Beach and the Invasion of Normandy. He makes you see hardships you  think your job is hard look at this movie and see a hard job.
  The  incredable jaw dropping start of the movie where the boats arrive to the  beach only to have an insumountable attack that kills every single soldier  in some of the boats.
  We see Cpt .Miller played by a stoic Tom Hanks  leading his confused company to the beach wall. As they get there they find  out that most of there company is either dead or unaccounted  for.
Unaccouted for and ill equipped they open the beach and the first  attack on the beach is succesful.
  When Cpt. Miller goes back to his  commanding officer he is given an assignment,go behind enimy lines with 8  men to safely return 1 man Pvt. James Ryan who's 3 brothers were lost in  combat.
  If you do not feel proud to be an american or at least  thankful of the men of World War 2 for risking there lives on the feild of  battle. This movie will give you that feeling. An incredible and truly epic  film and the best War movie ever made. This movie will be rememberd  forever.

1243122,3,B00000K3AM,"Saving Private Ryan from acclaimed director Steven Spielberg manages to portray the horror of war without ever making you want to turn the film off.  It's excellence must surely lie in the battle scenes with the initial  D-Day landings recreated with stunning accuracy.  the film however can't  keep up this pace and atmosphereand slips into war film cliches soon after.  The hero who has seen it all, the outcast, sharpshooter, wise-cracker  e.t.c are all present and correct.  Still with these problems you keep  watching as Captain Miller (Hanks) struggles with the war and mission they  were assigned... to Save Private Ryan.  As your interest is almost gone it  explodes in stunning style.  An attack on a machine post leaves another  member of the squad dead sparks a mutiny which is handled superbly by all  of the actors.  The following battle will leave you shell-shocked with the  ominous approach of Nazi tanks and troops starting an all most hour long  battle.
With some technical errors, uncharacteristic for Spielberg, means  Saving Private Ryan isn't the classic film that was promised.  However it  is still a must due to the unrivalled battle scenes.",947203200,3,1167,5.042105263157895

I mean, come on, did Spielberg even  crack a history book for that final scene?  Let's take a little  look:
i.)  The 2nd SS ""Das Reich"" Division did not enter  Normandy until June 10th (the movie's climax takes place on the 7th).
ii.)  ""Das Reich"" had no Tiger tanks, only Panthers and Panzer  IV's.  To the best of my knowledge, they didn't use Marder SPG's  either.
iii.)  The SS don't use any light machine guns.  In reality, each  infantry squad had 2-3 MG-34's or MG-42's.  The whole German infantry  stratagy was based around the machine gun.
iv.)  Do you actually think  the SS would just walk blindly into a town without checking for booby  traps, enemy numbers etc, etc.  Infantry goes in first (very cautiously),  then armor.  Did they learn nothing from 5 years of constant fighting?",947030400,3,983,4.502857142857143

First, 'Saving Private Ryan' is the most touching and heart-wrenching war movie I've seen  in a long time, mirroring the emotional content of 'Apocalypse Now'  (although the latter created more of psychologically disturbing,  depression-ridden emptiness of the heart).
What most impressed me about  the DVD, however, is that is bar-none the BEST quality of any DVD I have  seen, EVER. Absolutely brilliant picture quality, ear-piercing sound, this  is THE movie to get if you want to fully experience the power of this media  format.",946857600,,664,4.9818181818181815

Its battle scenes are realistically frightening, and will make a pacifist out of anyone for at least a few hours afterward.  My only complaint is that the first 15  minutes make you believe that the entire movie will continue to be a war  movie.  Technically, it is because we're at war throughout the entire film,  but the movie wanders a bit, sometimes becoming too slow to keep your mind  from wandering as well.  It's as if Spielberg couldn't decide exactly what  type of movie he wanted to make.  As far as the rest of the film goes, the  character's stories are believable and compelling, except for (ironically)  Ryan himself but I wish the film was able to retain the same intensity as  when it began.  However, in the long run, it's a well put-together piece of  filmmaking that will certainly change your views about WW2 & war in  general.",946857600,,903,4.481481481481482

How could anyone obey an order to  be chopped into meat? The effects were both sickening and wonderful.
I  found the story heartwarming and depressing. The bits that stuck in my mind  was the struggling drowning soldier at the start, the way that the Tom  Hanks character revealed his pre-war job, the way that Jewish soldier died  and the question the old man asked his wife at the end of the film.

Spielberg's hand-held in your face film technique immerses the viewer into  the action. Without a doubt, Speilberg's depiction of the landing on  Normandy Beach is one the most intense battle scenes ever filmed.
It is  no less than a sheer masterpiece of filmaking. It is a well-researched,  authentic anti-war statement that stands as a tribute to those individuals  who endured horrific circumstances and literally saved the free world from  tyranny.
Saving Private Ryan accomplishes what Schindler's list did in  regard to the holocaust and what Oliver Stone's Platoon accomplished in its  statement on Vietnam.
In addition, Spielberg has not only paid a  deserving tribute to the veterans of World War II, he has also produced an  excellent anti-war film that deglorifies warfare. There was nothing  romantic about being butchered on the battlefield. If there is a hell, the  D-Day veterans have already been there.
Saving Private Ryan is without a  doubt one of the most honest, realistic combat movies ever made. Although  Spielberg may not have gotten it all down in regard to the war with  Germany; his depiction in regard to Normandy Beach and D-Day are right on  target!",946512000,58,1321,5.219047619047619

Matt Damon is Private Ryan, but displays none of the screen  charm and eye catching talent of his Good Will Hunting role.  The messages  are clear that war is brutal and senseless and inhuman and horrid, but  after seeing the film three times I'm thinking that Saving Private Ryan is  more about showcasing spectacular special effects (Normandy Beach scenes)  than about anything else.

While I'm a John Wayne fan  of high extreams, I'd classify Tom Hank's portraile of a WWII Captain far  surpasing of even the Duke!  Hurrah and Kudos!

1243167,5,B00000K3AM,"I was very impressed by ths film.  I thought it would probably turn out to be rather cliched but it did seem to have a newer perspective on WW2.  Some people say the characters are stereotypical - well, I served in the  British Army Reserves for four years and my platoon had a fierce Scot,  joking Londoner, smiling Irishman and philosphical Welshman in it, plus me  as the token University Boy so I think you'll find that real-life Army  units can be like that.  No African Americans?  Since the US Army was  segregated until the sixties that is hardly surprising.  Caricatured  Germans?  Germans running away?  Well, some of them DID run away you know -  they weren't all ruthlessly obedient supermen, and some were no doubt far  more fed up with the war that the allies were.  It would have been nice to  see some British soldiers about but they were some way East taking out Caen  at the time, so again, not a surprise.  I wasn't sure about the film's  comment on Montgomery (""overrated"") and the British divisions  though;  Monty was a very good general indeed, at least as good as Patton  or Eisenhower, and if he was so overcautious then why did the British lose  so many men and tanks taking Caen?  I think you'll find that about 80% plus  of all the German armour in Normandy was at Caen, directed against the  British - not the sort of battle that can be won in an afternoon I'm sure  you'll agree.
Excellent film though - the most realistic combat scenes  you will ever see on celluloid by far, and the plot is at least  believable.
By the way, thanks very much to the US armed forces for doing  a fantastic job as our allies in WW2, and other times.  Long may Britain  and the US continue to stand up for freedom.",945820800,200,1726,4.412140575079873

Unfortunatley I grew up in England and my history lessons brainwashed us into believing that the English were involved and  the Americans joined as an after thought.  This film has put me straight,  thank you Mr Speilberg, you are a true prophet of your age",945820800,11,357,4.53125
1243169,4,B00000K3AM,"This DVD is an example of a perfect transfer of both video and sound. I use it as a benchmark to other movies in terms of technical stuff. It also shows what other war movies did not : the whole cruelty of the war, some  scenes are so realistic in depicting battles - that I don't recomment  weak-tempered ones to watch this movie - too much blood and dead bodies all  around. One thing that annoyed me is that this movie shows only americans  and few germans soldiers - it makes you think that war was between germany  and USA only. But that's not true, the film should have shown other parties  like soviets who had lost more than 40 mil people on that war but there is  nothing about them in that movie (although it's an american movie and me as  a former soviet can understand this). Germans were poor shown : they were  most of the time like background noise that is to be terminated - I think  the film shouldn't be so flat in that aspect. Once again this is an  american movie, so if you want to see the war from different eyes I  recommend DAS BOOT, STALINGRAD or any soviet war movie (don't think you can  find them here in USA)",945734400,2,1137,4.208333333333333

1243181,5,B00000K3AM,"The first twenty-five minutes of this film are the hardest to watch of any film I've seen.  It is stark, horrible, bloody and frightening.  The realism is amazing.  I can't imagine anyone ever approaching realism this  closly again without being compared to Spielberg.
The rest of the movie  has its horrors, but it's also a story of faith, redemption, sacrifice, and  the American attitude toward war.  This is probably the most interesting  thing about it.  Americans by and large dislike war.  When we are forced  into it the attitude is ""let's win this as quickly as  possible.""
No other film I have seen is this powerful and  frightening.  No other single movie event I can think of could cause so  many vets to start talking about their experiences.  Many thanks to Mr.  Spielberg for giving my father and his contemporaries a reason to talk  about this war. They were silent too long.
Since there is no way a film  can honestly reflect history this is quite an accomplishment. This is  ""history"" as we need to know it.",945734400,7,1025,4.68361581920904
1243182,5,B00000K3AM,"A few observations I've made after reading the reviews posted here...
1. The sheer volume of reviews posted here undoubtedly indicates it is among the most talked about films ever made...which makes it an influential and  therefore important film...whether you liked it or not.
2. I do not  recall seeing any WW II vets writing reviews here...which is consistent  with their silence about the war in everyday life.  My father was a prime  example.  He never  discussed any details of his combat experience in  Europe even with his wife or children.  Not in 50+ years...
3. Nitpicking  aside, almost all reviewers agree the portrayal of war in the film is as  close to realistic as it has ever gotten.
With regards to the third  observation, I believe Steven Spielberg has succeeded in accomplishing what  he set out to do...mainly, show the horrors of war as they really are and  remind people of the sacrifices made to secure our freedoms.
To any and  all Veterans...you have my thanks and gratitude.
I for one am grateful to  receive the reminder and thank god for people like my father who helped  save the world I have the good fortune to live in today.",945648000,6,1157,4.705
1243183,5,B00000K3AM,"This is not an easy film to watch. Clearly, that was not its intent.
The story begins in current time at the Normandy American Cemetary in France. An elderly man, followed by his family, walks as if compelled  toward a single grave. When he arrives there, his memory takes a different  journey back to the beaches below on the date, 6 June 1944.
From this  moment on, especially for the ensuing 25 minutes, we are thrust into a  story that, if it is hard to view, must certainly have been harder to live.  As the troop transports approach Omaha Beach, the eerie sense of calm gives  way to a landscape that when all is said and done is one of the most  powerful statements ever put on film.
When all is said and done, two  brothers surnamed Ryan have died on the beaches of Normandy. Another has  died within a week in the Pacific. It is discovered that a sole surviving  brother has parachuted somewhere in France. It is the assignment of a  survivor of Normandy and his platoon to find this brother and return him  home.
Director Steven Spielberg is a master at bringing emotion to the  surface and he does it once again with a film which is gut-wrenching.  However, the movie isn't all blood and gore; it's the story of young men  and boys who fought and died to preserve a way of life and to eliminate the  evil that they saw.
Tom Hanks heads the cast as Capt. John Miller, the  man who is given the mission to find Pvt. Ryan and bring him home. In one  sense, it works against the film to know that Matt Damon plays Pvt. James  Ryan, but not so much that you can't appreciate the nuances which Miller  and his platoon come up against time and time again during their  mission.
I agree with those who say that Spielberg puts us, his audience,  into the film and sweeps us up and carries us along from the opening  moments until the film's end. It is a masterful piece of filmmaking that  makes us feel that we have survived, although we were never in  danger.
Saving Private Ryan is a masterpiece.",945561600,6,2001,4.357723577235772
1243184,3,B00000K3AM,"This movie had all the makings of a horror film.  The evil villain, the torturous arduous ways young people die, and the absolute stupidity of the leading characters.  The opening war scene of the film (the best scene of  the film I might add) had Tom Hanks running into the field of battle with  officer stripes on his helmet.  Didn't anyone tell the director that only  soon to be dead officers wore their officer helmets with big white stripes  into battle.  Why don't you paint a bull's eye on your chest.  This movie  was filled with the most contrived scenes I've ever seen on film.  Only if  they had done one smart thing, they would have lived to tell the tale.  I  would have to rate this as one on the most obviously manipulated  disappointing films of all time.  Case in point, at the beginning of the  film you see a picture of all four Ryan boys in uniform.  Later Private  Ryan tells the story of the last time the four of them were together.  He  wasn't even in the Army at that point.  How did he take a picture with his  brother while all were in uniform. Also, in one torturous death scene.  Probably the most imbecilic of many (but you can take your pick there are  so many)  a man died in a way that is almost physically impossible to be  stabbed.  Yet we had to watch this horror scene in practically slow  motion.  I love war films, especially good ones, but this was neither.  It  was a horror film in sheep's clothing.  If Spielberg wanted to make a film  on the horrors of war, he could have done it very easily without the  contrived, implausible death scenes.  Yes people die horribly in war, but  this movie was a dishonest depiction of that horror.  I give this film  three stars.  Five for the first twenty minutes, probably the closest as a  moviegoer I've ever felt towards having been in battle.  And one star for  the last two hours.  All in all, it averages a three.",945475200,7,1901,4.354466858789626

1243187,5,B00000K3AM,"I must say that when Saving Private Ryan came to the cinemas, I wasn't compelled to go see it. I usually avoid films that have hoards of lemmings camping out to see it (read SW Episode One). Pvt. Ryan had been on the  video shelves for a few weeks before I picked it up. I wasn't really  looking forward to YAAWF (Yet Another American War Film).
This film is  absolutely brilliant filmmaking. If Speilberg had not made ET and Indiana  Jones, he would not have had the creative control to make a masterpiece  like this. He reminds me of Hitchcock at the height of his powers in the  late 50's early 60's.
This film is riveting from beginning to end. Every  scene, every shot, every sound has meaning and is seamlessly integrated  with the overall artistic vision of the film. I have a degree in Film  Criticism and have seen a lot of film. You quickly become jaded by formula  after formula.
Speilberg has created a fresh approach to what could be  considered a tired genre. The hand-held, chaotic filming of the Omaha Beach  landing along with the sizzling soundscape make this sequence one of the  best in cinema history. The point, however, is not to bombard the viewer  with gory war scenes for shock purposes. It is a setup for the rest of the  film. You are never at ease at any time for the rest of the movie. The  payoff for this setup is the sequence towards the end of the film in the  battle to hold the bridge.
One beautifully crafted sequence (of many) is  setup in the opening sequence crossfade from the old man's blue eyes to Tom  Hank's shaking hand at the Omaha landing. That crossfade is a film  convention that Speilberg subverts for dramatic effect. When you see the  final crossfade from Pvt. Ryan's face to the old man's face (beautifully  done) it comes full circle. This subversion of a typical film convention is  what makes Tom Hank's final scene so incredibly moving. You'll know what I  mean when you've seen it.
Speilberg has gone beyond technical mastery of  film, he has become a consumate artist, using his film making skills with  intelligence, sensitivity and confidence.",945388800,,2105,4.591397849462366

Why didn't they prepare better, why did they go to that part of the  beach where it was all open with no protection. Like I said it is a movie  that makes you think and wonder about those men that died for our country.  The scenery was excellent and the writing and acting was very exceptional.  I almost felt like I was there. It is a bit long but you really get  involved with the movie you don't realize it. Tom Hanks was not a choice I  would have made for the lead but he did a outstanding job in the role he  played.

1243204,4,B00000K3AM,"A great war film - for about 20 minutes, and maybe the last 20, where the filming is done as if the camera were your eyes and you were one of the soldiers. When the soldiers are taking cover the action is filmed from a  low position, when the soldiers are running, you run after them, looking  around the battlefield as you try to get to cover before the flashes from  the German pillboxes put a bullet in you! Somehow though the film sags a  little in between... Once the landing scene is over, its kind of like the  film is over. I wasn't expecting a bullet a minute all the way through,  even though I think the reality of D-Day would have been a better  ready-made story, as the story of the Titanic was. I couldn't help feeling  that the idea of saving a soldier from a war seemed improbable, and didn't  really keep the film going very well - not for me anyway. The film has  obviously  been made with care and attention to detail, but I think most  people who watch it will only remember it for the first part. Definately  one for those interested in or studying the events of WWII however, simply  for its highly-realistic ""first-person""  tell-it-like-it-really-was perspective of history, although it should be  remembered that not only the US took part in D-Day! :-)",945129600,2,1276,4.482608695652174
1243205,4,B00000K3AM,"I find it somewhat amusing to read all the previous reviews of this movie.  ""Where are the British?"" ""Where are the African-Americans?"" ""Why are the Germans portrayed so  steroetypically?"" ""What about the landings at all the other  beaches?""  My personal favorites are the couple of comments that point  towards ""Apocolypse Now"" as a REALISTIC war movie.  Heheheh.
  Folks, this ISN'T a movie about WWII.  This ISN'T even a movie about the  D-Day landings.  This is a film about a group of soldiers from a US Army  Ranger batallion who are sent on a PR mission shortly after landing at  Omaha beach.  There's your reason for no British soldiers.  Not many of  them serving in US Ranger batallions now is there?  Also the US forces were  still very segregated at that time.  The film's just telling it like it  was.  Steroetypical German soldiers?  In what way?  They spoke German?
  One clue to the power of this film is the fact that different groups see  it in different lights.  The pro-military faction sees the patriotism,  honor, duty, etc. in Capt. Miller and sees Jim Ryan as Why We Fight.  The  anti-war people see the film as a depiction of the senselessness of it all,  the terrible terrible violence, and both the mental and physical horrors  that war inflicts upon men.
  I feel that this film depicts the realities  of combat and what it does to men better than just about anything made  previously.  The tension, the bonding, the bravery, the cowardice are all  there.  The only flaw I find are the tacked on opening and ending pieces.  They seem like afterthoughts, there to appease someone (who though?  Studio  heads?  Moviegoers?  Veterans?) and were unnecessary to the story and in my  opinion took away from the weight of the ending.  I cannot give the film 5  stars because of these small scenes.

1243208,5,B00000K3AM,"I admired this movie immensely.  I think that Steven Spielberg knows how to get to our heart better than anyone.  (I think he took lessons from Disney.)
He makes us feel for the characters right from the start and  then we get carried along his roller-coaster ride to reveal who survives at  the end.
The realism and humanity he reveals to us in this truly  exceptional movie encompasses all that is TRUE about war.  Nobody was ready  for the landing at Omaha Beach, except maybe the Germans.  It reveals how  these brave men, knowing that most of them will be injured or killed,  stormed the beaches anyway, and they did it for ALL OF US.
Then the story  takes a turn when the eight men, led by Capt. John Miller, are sent to  rescue a James Francis Ryan, whose three brothers have already been killed,  and return him home to his mother.  The eight soldiers aren't too unhappy  about the mission until one of them dies.  Now the question is asked,  ""Is this man's life worth dying for?""
Tom Hanks is as usual  brilliant as Capt. Miller, as is Tom Sizemore, who I thought should have  been nominated for Best Supporting Actor, instead of Matt Damon.
Jeremy  Davies is very convincing as Upham - the translator, who tries at the very  beginning to tell Capt. Miller that he has never experienced combat before.  This fact becomes very clear to us in a tense moment in the  movie.
Spielberg also shows us the wonderful role the Medics had in  War-time.  In the movie the soft-hearted and caring medic Wade not only has  to experience all the action of a soldier but also has to try and help save  or ease the pain of the injured and dying.
This is a wonderful,  heart-warming movie.  I recommend it to anyone.  We should never forget the  sacrifices these men gave to make us what we are today.  It doesn't matter  what country you are from, the men who took part in World War II did so for  HUMANITY.  LEST WE FORGET.
PS  Did anyone see the mistake in the movie.  Just after Caparzo dies, when the seven men have left the airmen at the  crashed plane site, you see eight men walking through the green grass to  again look for Pvt. Ryan.  What can I say, I'm a counter.",944870400,2,2168,4.389873417721519

The visuals are among the most haunting ever filmed, including a now justly famous opening  battle scene which has set a new standard for battle scenes in war movies.  There has not been a more accurate depiction of a battle, than  ""Ryan's"" take on Omaha Beach.
But the movie's brilliance does  not stop at the technical wizardry.  The performances are heartfelt and  memorable, and the largely unknown cast (for now), is absolutely  superb.
Leading the way is of course Tom Hanks in, not his best  performance, but a great one nonetheless in its understatement and quiet  dignity, very well worthy of his Oscar nomination.  Also noteworthy are Tom  Sizemore as a dependable, eternally loyal lieutenant, Jeremy Davies as a  not-battle-ready translator, who is integral to the most haunting scene of  the year.

Indeed, many of my parents' high school friends  went to war and never returned.  This movie doesn't pull any punches and it  is better for it.

Okay, maybe films like From Here to Eternity might have been a tad bit better, but there is no doubt: in the long run, SPR will be 20 times more respected than it is now, and it  already has war vets crying. The battles are amazing, like none ever put on  film, and the drama reaches beyond the other war films and tips your eye,  causing them to leak with one half happiness and one half sadness. Hanks'  death helps separate this from most war films, and all performances are  good, especially the newcomers. Much better than the emulating Thin Red  Line.

1243232,5,B00000K3AM,"Until I saw ""Private Ryan"" I thought the best film about World War II was John Ford and Robert Montgomery's ""They were Expendable"".  Now I can say that what ""Expendable"" is to the  Pacific War, ""Private Ryan"" is to the European War.
I think  both these films try to convey the same thought:  sometimes wars must be  fought, and we must never forget those who never come back.  To paraphrase  Tom Hanks' last lines, ""We must make ourselves worthy of their  sacrifice.""
Despite the advances in filmmaking technology that  make ""Saving Private Ryan"" a more intense experience than  ""They were Expendable,"" both are magnificent films that  compliment each other.  Both have been given splendid DVD transfers, and  it is fascinating to watch them back-to-back to compare how similar events  are portrayed in the idioms of two different eras.  Spielberg has the  advantage of being in an era without the constraints suffered by Ford.  Unlike Ford, Spielberg can add, ""And lest we forget, to bring home the  meaning of sacrifice, here's a look at what really happened to those who  didn't come back.""",944265600,,1093,4.906593406593407

1243236,4,B00000K3AM,"(warning: may contain spoiler) The most noteworthy contribution of this film to the genre of the war film is it's realism in depicting scenery and battle scenes.  It sure as heck isn't the story, which examines the  question of wheter one life is worth risking several.
The film doesn't  really answer this question, nor, I think, is it supposed to.  My problem  with the story is that it just seems a bit contrived.
And I'm not sure  about the framing device.  The older  Ryan character bookends the film, but  this is comes off as somewhat awkward because if the sequences related in  the film are meant as flashback, Ryan is not the best character to use for  this technique, since he wasn't there for half the film.  Initially, it  keeps people guessing as to the identity of the old man in the film's  beginning but that only works once.
The movie succeeds at conveying the  horror of war, but I could've done without the constant platitudes and  swelling violins (not one of John Williams' better scores).  On the big  screen, paralyzed by the gruesome spectacle of massive carnage and anxious  about when the next bout would explode on the screen, I paid little  attention to these matters.  But when I saw it again on cable, the impact  was mostly lost and the films's sentimental elements came rushing to the  fore and proved to be a major distraction.  I was actually considering  buying the film until seeing it on TV changed my mind.  I still think the  film highly noteworthy but I can no longer see it as truly great.",944092800,3,1531,4.594795539033457

(Don't  think that Hanks wasn't good though.  He was as always.)  The only problem  with this movie is its surprisingly thin plot.  About halfway through the  film, it slows to the point of allowing the viewer to finally realize that  this movie is quite long.

Needless to say, the final  result fails to really coalesce into a coherent whole.  As in most  Spielberg films, the material points one way, and Spielberg goes in  another.

And while the character types are stereotypical, the viewer gets involved in them nonetheless - perhaps BECAUSE of the familiarity with the character types.  The first 30 minutes grabs you by the ruck straps and, from that point on,  you're along for the ride.  If anything, the interludes between action  sequences allows you to catch your breath, beyond going a long way towards  letting the viewer really get to know the characters.  Thank goodness for  DVD chapter stops, though, that let me skip over the sappy, manipulative  opening and closing present day scenes.  I get more of a sense of duty and  sacrifice by watching the opening and closing battle sequences than I do  from seeing a weepy old man salute the flag.
As a DVD, this is reference  quality.  Picture clarity is superb, with the opening landing craft scene  always giving me a sense that I'm there with the crew.  Surround mix is  active, and your subwoofer will be gasping by the time this movie is  over.
I wouldn't nominate this film as evidence of absolutely perfect  movie-making (I'd actually put Speilberg's Schindler's List way above this  film), but there's no doubt it's an engrossing 2.5 hours, and you could do  a lot worse when picking a DVD to show off your system.

1243246,4,B00000K3AM,"Saving Private Ryan is, undoubtedly, a well done motion picture that depicts faithfully the sad reality of a war: it is full of blood, explosions, fire and mutilated human bodies. Although its screenplay lacks originality, since this kind of treatment given to the story is common among movies concerning war, Saving Private Ryan has many qualities: excellent direction by Steven Spielberg and great performances, specially by Tom Hanks; breathtaking cinematography and sound effects that bring the war out of the screen while the camera moves in a dynamic way and blood and water splash over it; realistic makeup and art direction that make us feel the pain and chaos of those who share the horrors of a war; and an original dramatic score composed and conducted by John Williams.
But if there is one feature that calls attention is the patriotic appeal of Americans present in this motion picture: the eminent presence of the waving American flag and the idea of risking lives in behalf of the nation, which makes the reaction of Private Ryan kind of surreal, as Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) says in the movie.",943833600,,1110,4.9411764705882355

He was in the D-day invasion and the Battle of the Bulge,  plus many-many other battles. My father-in-law went to see this movie and  cried through-out most of it (especially the first 30 minutes). We later  talked about it and fifty years of thoughts came forth. The initial battle  sequence in the film is exactly what it was like, the sounds, the smells,  your hearing, etc. He said it was like being back on the beach all over  again. He told me, unless you've been in battle, it's very hard to describe  what it feels like. This movie hits the mark. See this movie and then thank  a WWII vet for the contributions they made to the USA.
I've read alot of  the other reviews, and many people should do some reading about the  invasion before they criticize it. Many keep asking where are the British,  well, they were over on the Gold and Sword beaches, while the Candaians  were on Juno beach. The US 4th Infantry div. attacked at Utah beach and the  US 29th Infantry div and US 1st Infantry division attacked Omaha beach.  This movie was about the landing at Omaha beach.

While the opening set piece was certainly busy, I still couldn't help thinking, ""Gee, so this is  what a John Wayne movie would've looked like with whiz-bang special  effects!"" Unfortunately, this film suffers from the same defects as  those old war movies. Way-too-old soldiers, ""evil"" German  adversaries, overly romanticized death scenes, and that done to death  ""ragtag band of misfits behind enemy lines"" plot. This is the  type of story a ten-year old would come up with if you gave him a  two-dollar bag of plastic army men.
An entertaining, if somewhat  sluggish, war fantasy? You bet. History? Hardly. Where are the generals,  with their noncomm servants and comfy digs, calling the shots from the  safety of HQ? Where are the clueless eighteen year-olds who don't know that  they've volunteered to be used as cannon fodder? Where are the British, who  were literally fighting for their homes and families?
In the final  analysis, this movie has the same fatal flaw most war movies have. No  matter how horrific the battle scenes are, you still come away with a good  feeling about the sacrifices that were made. And as long as that is the  case, there will be no hesitation to make those sacrifices again. Enjoy it  as a patriotic fantasy, but don't call it a history lesson.

Others have  said that other than the battle scenes the movie is lacking in plot.  Well,  I don't agree, but I can understand why someone would think that.  But this  movie tells a truth rarely seen in War films. It's brutally honest, in  fact.  Although the Privates and Copl. Upham are rather cliche, that  meaning that you can see types like them in almost every war movie made,  the Cpt. Miller and Sgt. Horovath represent the more human and less  ""John Wayneish"" war hero of the past.  They are common men sent  to fight in a war.  It may seem questionable to some why Spielberg chose  WWII as the war for this picture.  It was a just war that needed to be  fought, yet this movie almost seems to show us that war is bad because of  how devestating it is.  If anything, Tom Hanks' Cpt. Miller's final line in  this movie sums up the whole point of the moive: ""Earn This.""  He  isn't simply telling Pvt. Ryan to earn his trip home and his men's  sacrifice to save him.

He mentions the screen pauses briefly before the movie continues. This is not so much a flaw but an  annoying trait of dual layer DVD's (meaning the whole movie is crammed on  one side rather than distributed across both sides) This layer transition  also causes problems with certain brands of DVD players.
In fact, the  first copy of SPR I bought had tons of digital noise and interference at  the layer change. I returned it and received a copy that works correctly,  meaning it pauses briefly during the layer transition. The main problem I  have with dual layer disks is the quality seems to suffer. SPR is NOT  brilliantly rendered in DVD. It sounds great, but the look is not as crisp  as other non-dual layer movies I have, which you have to flip, like  Goodfellas and Stargate.

The film blew me away when I saw it on a Saturday afternoon with my  wife. We didn't talk for awhile afterwards, just held hands very tightly. I  will show the first part of the film to my class on war, after they have  read Fussell's excerpts from his WARTIME in the Atlantic Monthly. Then they  will reflect on military ethics under such circumstances--Can we expect  people act ""morally"" in such conditions and hold them accountable  if they don't?
My dad and uncle fought in the Pacific in WWII.  Their  stories and my own brief encounters with combat conditions confirm the  basic realism of the scenes Spielberg shot.
Are there inaccuracies in  this film?  Yes.  Is it  PC (no blacks, German stereotyping, where were the  Brits, etc., etc.) No.  But the majority of people I have read here making  such comments are twits.  The horror of war eats up all its participants.  The individual stories of most participants caught up in real wars are  tragically mundane and pathetically ""undeveloped."" (Trying to  make an ""interesting"" story out all the ordinary persons caught  up in this sort of thing is a travesty).So Spielberg tells a simple story  about ordinary lives smashed at random (or saved at random).  What he  ultimately accomplishes is to force us into alot of soul searching (at  least those of us morally awake) about when and why we should continue to  make war, about who we are and what we owe to our parents and grandparents,  about whether we are willing to put ourselves or others through this, and  if we have anything worth calling up such sacrifice to save.
I guarantee  that neither Saddam Hussein nor the Iranian ayotollahs want their people  watching this and asking these sorts of questions. . .
As to why this did  not win BEST PICTURE? Because the Hollywood liberals did not want to raise  questions about those who ran from sacrifice in recent history or to  encourage pandering to patriotism? Who knows. Why not skip serious  questions and award the title to a ""really interesting story""  about Shakespeare in adulterous love.",943315200,46,2213,4.74934036939314

The plot was nothing all that new, but like the acclaimed '99 war novel ""The  Triumph & Glory"", ""Saving Private Ryan"" possesses a  power far greater than the sum of its parts.  The horrific realism of the  film renders any other minor criticism of Speilberg's epic an exercise in  irrelevancy.

Often a tool of that realism is a license for psychological theatrics: because war is chaos, the characters carry the chaos and destroy themselves.  Vietnam movies are the natural examples.  We have the sweltering, sinister jungle and a phantom enemy: we get the ruminating dialogue of the insane.  Sometimes this is realism.  Other times, though, I feel a director is using war as a forum for existential exercise.
Spielberg, I think, rightly goes the other way.  The first violent scene is more ""visual"" than psychological.  And the men storming the beach are not immediately converted into a preaching symbol.  We do not bring up the words ""madness"" or ""hell"" or explain.  The brave implication is this: there is a kind of better comprehension in looking.",941846400,,824,5.044444444444444

Almost everyone is completely missing the point of this movie.  Yes, the  first 30 minutes are just terrific/horrendous, but it IS the characters and  the storyline that make this movie so good.  The violence and death is the  easy part of it.  It's the friends, the bonds, the experiences, the  dilemmas, the camraderie, the Mission, that make war so memorable.  Any war  movie can show violence--so what.  This movie made me cry not because of  the people being shot and maimed, but because of the real soldier story  behind.

I haven't seen too many movies that have left me divided  between admiration and dislike as SPR,  so the best advice I can give is  that it's definitely worth owning and probably no one short of Spielberg's  genius could have assembled it, but program a ""good parts""  version into your DVD player.

However, the ending battle sequence is harder to  watch because of what happens to some of the characters that we followed  through the film. The story of Private Ryan was done just as well as the  battle sequences in the film, questioning what the value of human life is.

Then, later on, as he is running toward the seawall, he  has it again.  When, where did he drop/pick-up his or another Thompson?  More examples of lack of contunity is when the squad arrives in the town  were Jackson takes out the sniper (great scene) Ophiem has no rifle and is  so scared that he is to be a part of Sgt. Mike's underwear. The next scene  has Ophiem with a rifle asking where the Captain is from, and showing very  little fear for a non-combatant soldier.  This scene seemed to be out of  sequence from the scenes before and after it.  There's more, but I will  jump ahead to the bridge battle. What struck me strange the most about this  battle was when Sgt. Mike grabbed Ophiem from the stair and said ""Time  to go to the Alamo"".  The next scens shows Sgt. Mike telling Tom Hanks  to give him the Bazooka and get going to the Alamo.  Next, you see Ophiem  in a artillery crater.  What happen here?  Did Ophiem jump, fall, trip or  what to end up in this crater?  Where was Sgt. Mike when this happen?  How,  what, why did they get seperated?

As  the movie begins to unfold the viewer begins to understand why each  character reacts to what is happening and his motivation to make it home.  The realism reaches out and bites you, and for once the violence is not  needless, it is important to each and every American.

One reviewer noted that there is little  character depth and development.  In situations like those encountered in  war lasting friendships are made without knowing a great deal about those  with whom you share common hardships.

However, something has  stopped me watching this since I first saw it in the summer.  I had heard  all about it, watched the ""making of"" programme, and even knew  the ending, but nothing prepared me for what I saw.  Many people have  criticised the film for its shallow characters etc, but that is not what  the film is about.  If you want complex characters, find a movie.  This is  not a movie, but I don't know what it is.  Spielberg made this so that  people of today can understand what was done for us, and be grateful.  The  opening scene is particularly horrific because of the parody of ""The  Longest Day"" - it is not funny, but there are scenes which share the  exact screenplay with TLD, but in a completely new light (eg. the pipe  bombs).
The characters in this film are all there for a purpose, and  the final touch of inspiration is the fact that you don't know who the  veteran is at the beginning - it could be Ryan or Miller.

Having gotten  that out of the way, I must say that this is the most realisitic portrayal  of WWII combat outside of documentary footage. You can't help not feeling  absolutely grief-stricken after watching this film.
This film is not  about a plot, but about war itself. (Full Metal Jacket was similar in this  way.) It's about how war is de-humanizing and downright horrific. For a  more character-driven play, see The Thin Red Line (it's a very different  beast from SPR, but also highly recommended).
As for being the best WWII  film ever, it is not. That title belongs to Schindler's List. While not  being directly about the war, it shows us the Holocaust with more honesty  than we have ever seen or ever will see.

In the beggining  scene when the invaders are mowing threw the barbed wire as easy as can be,  that is completely unrealistic.

1243332,5,B00000K3AM,"One of the worst choices for best-picture Oscar:  ""Shakespeare in Love"" over ""Saving Private Ryan."" Spielberg was visibly stunned when his picture didn't win, and so was I.  This was one of the  best movies I ever saw, and I've been seeing them since 1949.  It easily  makes my top 20, maybe even top 10.  War has never been portrayed the way  it was in this movie, and Spielberg's camera and editing techniques put the  viewer right into the middle of some of the worst fighting of the war.  His  choice of a look-alike location for Omaha Beach, the construction and set  decoration of the French town (actually done on an air base in England),  and the use of very authentic-looking uniforms, weapons, and vehicles made  this movie stand out as the best war movie ever made, and I've seen all the  good ones.  Hanks' acting and the performances of the other men in his  squad were outstanding.  One reviewer called the movie a  ""visceral"" experience, and that's what it was for me.  Fear,  excitement, triumph, tragedy, and at last some kind of satisfaction, even  if not complete, marked this as a very emotional experience.  This film and  ""Schindler's List,"" Spielberg's two best, are more like  experiences than movies.  You really feel as if you're living these events  along with the characters instead of just sitting in a theatre watching a  movie. It's interesting that Spielberg's two best films, as well as his  third best (""Empire of the Sun"") are the ones that are the most  realistic and rely the least on special effects.

True, there are elements that Spielburg didn't replicate  exactly, but the film still one of the greatest ever made.  What was  replicated perfectly were the important elements of heroism, sacrifice,  compassion, and the enduring human spirit.  You can't view this movie from  the approach that everything has to be identical to history.  This movie  was an attempt to put into perspective the sacrifices others have made for  the United States so future generations could have the right to make movies  on whatever they choose to, and so others could criticize it without fear  of reprisal from their government.

1243334,4,B00000K3AM,"The first fifteen minutes of this film are some of the best cinema ever made.  It was downright frightening, as was the intent.  The sound effects were an improvement over previous movies I'd seen, and this does a lot to  put you right there amid the action.  When you see it, note the sound of  the German MG42 machine guns and the crack of the bullets.  Nice job.  Of  course, the carnage was trimmed for the sake of brevity.  In the movie,  Omaha beach is taken in 15 minutes of Hell.  Historically, it took most of  the day, and casualties ran into the thousands.
It then transitions to an  interesting, but not quite outstanding, fictional story about saving the  last son of the Ryan family.  A Civil War letter from Abraham Lincoln is  read during the movie, a letter which was so moving that I played it over  and over.  The reading isn't bad either.
The characters are good, but a  bit shallow and predictable.  The Germans are just a little too evil,  definitely the ""bad guys"".  Does Spielberg understand the  difference between National Socialists, who condoned and orchestrated mass  murder, and German Nationals, who defended their nation as almost anyone  would?  If not for these weaknesses, I'd give it 5 stars.
Despite these  minor weaknesses, the story is very interesting and, as a big bonus,  educational.  I was very moved by what a generation of Americans (and those  of other nations also) went through to liberate Europe.

Not only is it realistic but it is pretty darn accurate.  It not only shows  what the soldiers go through but their family and loved ones too. He  created some of the best battle seens I have ever seen. Like in the  beginnig when this soldier loses his arm and go's around looking for it.  When he finds it he just picks it up like it was nothing.  He did such an  exellent job with the movie that I actually felt frustrated too when the  medical personal were stopping a soldier from bleeding. They spend such a  long time on him until they finally stop the bleeding,then all of a sudden  BAAM! He gets shot in the head.  The longer you watch the movie the more  drawn in you become.  My favorite part is the ""Final Battle"" when  Tom Hanks and company make a last stand. His Squad make a small fortress to  fight the incoming Germans. Private Ryan would have never  gone home if it were not for Tom Hanks. He did not have to accept the  mission,but he did. Why you ask? Could it be he is just a good natured man?  Could be he was crazy? Or could it be he just wants to finish this mission  and go home to his wife?  In all I think this is the best World War 2 movie  of all time.

And while the landing scenes were memorable to  most viewers, the other battle scenes were very powerful and accurate. This  movie is not only good, it is valuable to our veterans.

The movie would have been so much better if they had just  eliminated the subplot where they let the German soldier go only to have  him turn up again at the end, etc, etc.  If the soldier had not returned  & the rest of the action went on with diferent Nazis fulfilling his  plot point honors, or even if the one American soldier who talked the rest  of the heroes into letting him go, killed the returning Nazi in a fashion  more savage than anyone expected, only to be killed himself by friendly  fire, anything to maintain the chaos of war image that shatters the  audience at the beginning of the movie.  Unfortuneately, chaos does not  reign in this movie, but B-movie sentiment does, leaving Schindler's List  as Spielberg's only truly successful ""serious"" movie.

1243344,2,B00000K3AM,"Mr. Spielberg is very good at light entertainment, but always seems to go over the top with serious topics.  Here again he rubs our faces in the points he is trying to make -- flag-waving from start to finish,  heavy-handed dialogue, ""good guys/bad guys"" plot, and a  re-writing of history to make WWII a battle of freedom-loving Americans  against nasty Germans.
If only war was so simple.  Of course many of the  individual soldiers for both sides were motivated by principle.  But  overall the role of the U. S. in the war was no less self-serving than that  of the other combattants.  The U. S. only entered the war when Japan forced  it to -- before December 1941, U. S. companies made fortunes selling  armaments to both sides, and before that, the U. S. turned away Jewish  refugees from Germany by the boatload.  The Allies made no real effort to  stop the Holocaust, though they were well aware of it.
Given that, a  little less Yankee-doodle-dandy would have been in order in this  film.
There were some items in the script that I found quite badly  written -- Hanks exhorting Damon to ""Earn this"" and  Ryan-the-elder saying something like ""Tell me I was a good man"".  These lines made me groan.  They also suggest the filmmaker thinks we can't  figure out the significance of sacrifice without it being s-p-e-l-l-e-d  o-u-t for us loud and clear.  And the forced irony of having the released  German POW come back to kill the man who let him go -- totally unlikely  given the number of  troops in the area -- was really contrived.
I  thought the opening battle scene was powerful but I also found it  voyeuristic, as did the kids who crammed the front rows and clearly got off  on the gore.  Just like a murderous video game.  No uneasiness, no moral  unpleasantness, just ""Wow, did you see that?"" special effects  worship, and that's disturbing.  Malick and Toll in ""The Thin Red  Line"" did a better job with the battle scenes -- chaos, carnage, the  cameras (hand-held and on cranes) putting us right in the midst of it all,  and quite uncomfortably so.
All in all, I thought this film was more of a  propaganda production than a work of art.  It pretended to be historical  and then distorted the history.  Malick's film IS a work of art.  It also  made me question my beliefs, moved me out of my comfortable preconceptions,  and in telling the story implied important questions without providing pat  answers.
I cared about the characters in ""The Thin Red Line""  precisely because they were so believable -- fallible, hesitant, capable of  inexplicable courage and love on the one hand and cynicism and cruelty on  the other.  Real people.  The film  (TTRL) is very faithful to the novels  by James Jones, who fought in Guadalcanal.  His (Jones's) daughter said  ""Saving Private Ryan"" is exactly the sort of film Jones would  have hated -- it prettifies war and makes it simplistic (good guys, bad  guys).  Instead of characters, it gave us caricatures.
""Hamburger  Hill"", ""Full Metal Jacket"" and, of course, ""The Thin  Red Line"" are far superior.

1243356,5,B00000K3AM,"Haunting...memorable...gut wrenching...sobering...that's Saving Private Ryan. It gets right to the heart of the horror of war and never lets up. It is a moving tribute to my parent's generation, many of whom paid a terrible  sacrifice for our freedom. It made its point directly and  succinctly.
Saving Private Ryan is not an entertaining film. It wasn't  meant to be. It is a wake up call. It is a reminder. It is also about  rising above adversity triumphantly, adversity in many forms.  It is  compelling viewing. With its touch of Hollywood heroics, it is also classic  Americana.
I have seen it in the theater and numerous times on my new 50  inch tv and each time I feel humbled and battered and yet I come back for  more. The first time I saw it, I was haunted for a week. Then I found I  wanted to know everything I could about the film.
I notice some Amazon  reviewers denigrate the film with their griping and nitpicking. I find this  to be petty and inconsequential to what SPR has accomplished. Most of us  already know the accomplishments. Yeah, I'm also aware of some of the  imperfections, the most notable detraction to me is the near vilification  of German soldiers. OK, so name me a perfect film. For those who think The  Think Red Line is better or perfect, try again. I understand and appreciate  TRL's attempt to touch on the horror of war, but it was too convoluted to  be effective.
I hope the producers elect to release a ""directors  version"" of SPR soon. If you've observed the film's overall editing  (I's just the slightest bit abrupt in a few places) as well as the ending  creditrs, red the novel, or seen photos of the movie, you will have noticed  the likelihood of footage which was not included in the curent 2hr and  50min version of the film. Maybe the producers wanted to keep the running  time down for the first go round.
Steven Spielberg has created a  masterpiece wich will stand the test of time. It is simply one of th finest  films ever made. By the way, have any armor enthusiasts out there noticed  the small, sprocketless front drive wheels on the Tiger tanks in the film?  Very curious.tAD",937958400,,2137,4.567282321899736
1243357,5,B00000K3AM,"Well i have seen many great war films in my short life, ""The Longest Day"", ""A Bridge too Far"", to name but a few, but this film has to top the lot. In the opening Omagh beach sequence, I was shocked, and  moved at the scenes shown. Never has a film touched me like that before, and  in so many different ways. Also in the final battle when they are waiting  to attack the Germans,I felt tense and nervous when I heard the roar of the  tanks coming closer. The acting was brilliant and so to was the camera  work. The only quibble I have with this film is the way they make Field  Marshall Montgomery and the British sound inept. Apart from that this film  is another jewel in Spielberg's already glittering crown. Awesome!",937958400,,722,4.303703703703704

1243359,5,B00000K3AM,"This is one of those movies that, when it's over, makes you feel physically exhusted. One of, if not the best war film ever made. It's easy for some to say that it's a typical Spielberg film, made to manipulate your  emotions, but those people don't see any deeper into it. ""Full Matal  Jacket"" was all bravado, no emotion. ""A Thin Red Line"" was  empty, with no direction. Maybe ""Das Boot"" and ""Bridge On  The River Kwai"" can stand next to this one, but few others can even  approach it's greatness. Every teen who thinks the army would be a fun life  should be forced to watch this. The realism goes beyond what any normal  director would consider. The only downbeat is the heroic death of Hanks,  romanticised for the Hollywood crowd. Goes to prove why Spielberg is the  premiere director of our, and maybe of all, time. Definitely the best film  of 1998, despite what those morons in the Academy say.",937785600,,903,4.518518518518518
1243360,5,B00000K3AM,"The movie ""Saving Private Ryan"" was on of the best war movies that I have ever seen.  This movie takes you to the heart of the moment where soilders came face-to-face with what they had been traing for.  Steven Speilberg instead of making a movie where it gave you the idea the  soilders never suffered, it showed you the pain that they went through.  It  showed that they wanted anything from their mothers to a cigarette.  The  actors in this movie did a wonderful job making it as realistic as  possible.  The deaths of Caparzo(Vin Diesel), Medic Wade(Giovanni Ribisi),  Jackson(Barry Pepper), Mellish(Adam Goldberg), Horvath(Tom Sizemore) and  Miller(Tom Hanks) was terribly tear jerking.  These men gave their lives  for some stranger.  I might only be 18 but after seeing that movie I don't  take life for granted anymore.  I say the movie ""Saving Private  Ryan"" is the best and anyone who disagrees please don't try and ruin  it for the rest of us.",937267200,,955,4.790123456790123
1243361,5,B00000K3AM,"I am sorry, but anyone who gives saving private ryan anything but five stars due to the fact that they are comparing it to Full Medal Jacket is just plain stupid. It's like comparing a fruit to a vegtable.  Saving  Private Ryan is one of the best war movies ever made, if not the best.  For  those who say look at Full Medal Jacket, I also feel sorry for you.  Kubrick, perhaps the best director of all time, did make a great film, I  love Full Medal Jacket, but that movie does not catch the horrors of war,  but instead the individual experience of training and the effects of war on  man.  They are both good films, but Saving Private Ryan is a better war  film.  I also would like to say that The Thin Red Line is also a fine  picture.  That movie is more difficult to comprehend, but after multiple  viewings, it does show its true self.  It is a great movie, about the  effects of war on men, and how they see it, while they are in the heat of  it.  And how they long for something great, something we all take for  granted these days.

1243362,5,B00000K3AM,"I first saw ""Saving Private Ryan"" its opening day in the theater that gloomy July day in 1998.  I walked out of the movie forever changed and emotionally drained.  Never before has a movie evoked such emotions.  A  powerful masterpiece, Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan""  deserved the Best Picture Oscar that went to ""Shakespeare in  Love.""  Everyone should see this film if not for its sheer power, for  its message which permeates throughout the entire film effortlessly and  subtly.  I am of the opinion that those who do not like the film have  missed that point and have no compassion for a war that left the world  defeated and dehumanized.  I really don't think the global community has  recovered from the peril caused by the Nazis, Americans, British and  Japanese.  And hopefully, ""Saving Private Ryan's"" message will be  picked out, passed around and taught so that we, as the human race, can  avoid another military conflict as large a scale of that which created  large generational gaps in families of all different religions, race and  ancestry.",936403200,,1067,4.954545454545454

It shows the complete sacrifice and dedication of the soldiers during the D-Day invasion  and also deals with other, deeper social issues. Being someone in his  twenties, I had not realized the true nature of this war until it was  presented to me in this stunning visual format.  These men died so that we  would know freedom.

At first I thought I had a defective disc and so I returned it and got a new one, and the same error occurs ""This Disc can't be played on this device, please try another""

So I don't know if it is something Xbox can patch, but currently it doesn't work.  If anyone finds out anything different or your Xbox DOES work, please let me know, because then maybe there is something else wrong.  but my other 4k movies still work fine.

Good luck...but if you have a stand alone player, this move is amazing, I hope I can play it soon because I have Atmos sound and I bet that will sound great too.

Be warned, you can NOT watch the 4K version of this film if your TV doesn't have HDR! Paramount should display a prominent warning on the display for this disc. If they won't do it then Amazon should! I'm not going to keep this just to watch the blu ray version. I understand that Spielberg wants his film shown in the best possible way but I certainly don't, currently, have it in my budget to buy a new 4K HDR TV. That means I have to settle for watching the blu ray version which is much worse than my Sony 4K without HDR..or not at ALL! That is the option I choose, I am going to return it! So I guess Spielberg will be happy knowing that his beautiful movie won't be so disrespected as to be watched on a beautiful Sony 4K screen WITHOUT HDR!

7914126,5,B00000K3AM,"I have mixed feelings about this purchase. I recently bought the sapphire edition bluray of this film and loved it, it has great picture quality (despite the intended grittiness) and a brilliant 5.1 surround mix. But having hopped on the Dolby Atmos/DTS:X/4K/HDR train fairly early, i saw this pre-order and instantly bought it.

After watching this on my 50"" Samsung KU6500, with 5.2.4 surround (Denon AVR-X4300H) i was definitely impressed. The grittiness is still present and i understand its artistic intention, but when the grittiness is gone.......WOW. Fine detail is phenomenal on close ups of faces, uniforms, and helmets. You cant LITERALLY see every pore on their faces (on closeups), textures of fabric, and the small imperfections on the helmets. While my TV doesn't have all the hardware to take advantage of the HDR10/Dolby Vision encode (only 8-bit panel without WCG) it does afford a small improvement over SDR, and i definitely noticed. The palette is very neutral, but the greens of fields and hills really popped as well as blue sky. I would say the video is a fine improvement over the bluray.

The Dolby Atmos was also amazing, but was it leaps and bounds better than the 5.1? I don't think so. I have my bedroom home theater setup as close to dolby specifications as i can, and while my speakers aren't KEF or Klipshe (base speakers and subs are onkyo from a mid-range HTiB and heights are Micca COVO-S) ive been very happy with their performance. The original 5.1 mix was mindblowing (expecially the D-day scene) with Dolby Surround upmixing. The bass was so realistic and chest shaking and the sound stage was so expansive. The Atmos mix is a good improvement. The D-day scene was indeed impressive, but i wasn't hearing super precise object placement of bullets and such. The height channels indeed add a level of atmosphere throughout the entire film, but I wasn't blown away by discrete effects. (surprisingly planes flying over sounded more convincing with the upmixed 5.1 than the atmos).

Overall, the 4K transfer is dazzling when the camera stops to focus on the characters, and the Atmos mix is the best SPR has ever sounded. But if you're not outfitted with 4K yet (and won't be for a while) and are only looking forward to the Atmos track, Id stick with the bluray copy.",1525996800,,2304,4.857506361323155
