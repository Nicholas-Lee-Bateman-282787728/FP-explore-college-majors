7900774,1,7885885917,"This set is produced in and ships from China. I suspect that it may be an illegal bootleg edition.  I did not realize this until after the order was shipped, when I saw that the tracking information listed the origin as somewhere in China. I then looked more closely at the product image on Amazon and saw that there are Chinese characters visible on the box.  The shipping time from China to upstate New York was 16 days.

The set consists of 20 single-sided discs, five per season for seasons 1-4.  The package format is one I have never seen before.  The outer case is 7 by 9 inches.  Inside the outer printed slipcase with the Hitchcock image is an unmarked sturdy tagboard box with a magnetic closure which opens like a hollow book to reveal a disk-sized cutout cavity.  Inside that cavity are all 20 discs together, in a kind of soft fabric folding wallet with 20 disc-sized slots, like the slots for credit cards and photos in a Western-style wallet.

The labeling is English-Chinese bilingual throughout, on the package, the disc labels, and the disc menus.  The disc menus also offer optional Chinese-language subtitles, in both traditional and simplified Chinese.  Presumably this set is intended for domestic distribution in China, as well as the export market. Each disc label lists the episodes on that disc by title and by number within that season; the four seasons are distinguished by different background colors on the disc labels.

The episode titles agree with the Wikipedia listing for these four seasons, except that episode 21 of Season 1, 'Safe Conduct', is omitted entirely, presumably for political reasons (since it is set in Communist Eastern Europe).  The remaining episodes of Season 1 are renumbered to conceal this omission.  More importantly, Hitchcock's sardonic introductory and concluding comments are entirely omitted for all of Seasons 1, 2 and 3: what is given here is just the teleplay, with original title and credits.  Presumably this too reflects political censorship for a domestic Chinese audience.

Season 4 contains the full original episodes with commentary.  I don't know what to make of this disparity.  I think that the season 4 discs may come from a different production run subject to less stringent censorship, since the disc formatting for season 4 is also a bit different.

The production quality seems to be quite good, but I will be returning this set because of the missing material.  In my view Hitchcock's commentaries are an integral part of the series.

Addendum Feb 17, 2014: I did receive a refund through Amazon of my original purchase price, but had to pay my own return shipping of $7.60 to a U.S address, so I am out that amount.",1388102400,4,2698,4.875
