2479906,4,B000E1JOWU,"It is a testimony to the longevity of the Lassie legacy that there are different camps of fans whose memories of Lassie are tied to the original movies or whatever version of the television series was being broadcast when they were avid viewers.  Some adore the original Jeff and Timmy versions, while others prefer the later 'Ranger' or 'Lassie on the Road' versions.  And many of us just enjoy watching Lassie regardless.

This particular film is a compilation of several episodes that originally aired as a multipart story on the 'Ranger' TV series. In this incarnation of the series Lassie is a partner to Forest Ranger Corey and accompanies him on various assignments.  The story hearkens back to a simpler time when one could sit back and enjoy a television show without being exposed to bloodshed, foul language, or carnal interests.  There are several subplots involved so don't worry, the film is not solely just about the cougar of the title.  The human characters are portrayed as real people who make mistakes yet are altruistic and interested in making the world a better place through their own particular vocations -  quite different than the greedy, possessive, manipulative excuses for humanity the television audience is so often exposed to today.

And of course there is Lassie, whose love of all creatures two-legged and four-legged ultimately makes everything work out in the end.  Knowing that the dog working here is actually a descendant of the original Lassie of the movies ('Pal' in real life) makes it all the more endearing (in this episode I believe it is 'Mire', considered to be one of the best since Pal).

The world would surely once again seem to be a better place with a new episode of Lassie to watch each weekend.",1420588800,5,1750,4.861952861952862

2479910,5,B000E1JOWU,"I'm a Lassie fan through and through, just wish it all were available on dvd. I try to buy them as I find them. This one is no different. I enjoy the ranger movies and shows over earlier shows with Timmy, but in the end, it's all about the dog.",1384905600,,244,3.9
2479911,5,B000E1JOWU,"My dd loves ""Flight of the Cougar"" so much that she even spent her own money to get it, and she *rarely* spends her own money.  We'd seen several of the Lassie ""ranger years"" when we had DirectTV, and they've been the hardest to find on dvd.  In this show she loves the humor and the suspense, the woman pilot, and of course, the cougar cubs and the satisfactory ending.  For only $8, this dvd is a very good value.  We'd buy more of Lassie and the ranger years if they were available.",1229385600,10,485,4.182795698924731
2479912,4,B000E1JOWU,Lassie DVD Flight of the cougar was great for the children and family. The story centered around Lassie helping a cougar and her cubs....,1207526400,3,137,4.75
2479913,3,B000E1JOWU,"From the forest ranger years, from three episodes that take place while Corey Stuart is investigating the use of sailplanes as survey craft. I wish Classic Media/Sony would quit messing around with these ""movies"" and release LASSIE as season by season sets with the episodes as shown instead of crammed into a movie format. We could also use prints struck from the original masters, as these movies are badly faded and color-shifted, especially on the wildlife shots. LASSIE deserves better.",1160956800,3,491,5.15

8103867,5,B000E1JOWU,"I grew up with Corey Stuart (Robert Bray) as the owner of Lassie. Most of the DVDs I find feature Jeff or Timmy, so I was glad to find this reminder of my childhood. Since I always think of Lassie as the best behaved dog ever, my favorite scene in this movie is when she tries to steal a steak for the cougar family.",1485388800,2,316,3.953125
