8631940,5,B00HEM9QA2,"Love this one hour standing workout. Very challenging, even the instructors behind Billy Blanks are having trouble keeping up with him. Yes he lose count and sometimes gets on course, but i have gotten used to that and it does not bother me. It  has the traditional moves, and some new moves that will take a little practice to get used to, but no too hard. I never feel like giving up with his workouts, (like I do with Denise Austin and The Firm). I sweat a lot and feel good in the morning-not sore. I recommend this workout but be for warned- It is not easy but well worth it.",1531699200,,580,4.225225225225225
8631941,5,B00HEM9QA2,"Really, really awesome work out!
The first 9 minutes consists of tutorial/warm up. Skip that and dive into the real deal beginning at the 9:44 mark.
The music is fast paced and fun beats, the group is a bunch of familiar Elite instructors and even they are feeling the burn! There isn't too much walk-it-out in between moves which is awesome!. Has the feeling of original Tae Bo (Ripped & Extreme series ).
It's a total body work out...lower body, upper body, arm work, abs...This DVD is freaking good!
Evenly done in both sides of the body, unlike most Billy dvds...
The main work out is 50 minutes long, 9 minutes in the beginning  (skip it ), then about 5 minutes cool down
Am really excited about this dvd, my new favorite.  I do this plus 30 mins of Ab Bootcamp.  But just the 50 minutes from this alone is great workout for a day.
Nothing but cardio fun!
Absolutely not for beginners. Am in the intermediate to advanced level  but still sweat buckets in just 15 mins.",1459382400,,973,4.449438202247191
8631942,5,B00HEM9QA2,Great workout .Love it!!!!!Glad I bought it.,1435276800,,44,5.428571428571429
8631943,4,B00HEM9QA2,"Great workout, that is, once you get past the initial tutorial and blabbing in the beginning.  If you're new to Taebo, (and I don't suggest you start with this one, if you are!), then the tutorial is fine.  However, if you've done Taebo ever, you know what the moves are.  I find myself not doing this one as often just because of having to skip forward, but it gets your heart rate up, gets you sweating and Billy adds some new moves that keep it interesting.",1431993600,,460,4.325581395348837
8631944,3,B00HEM9QA2,Too much stopping for instruction.,1416960000,,34,6.0
8631945,4,B00HEM9QA2,"Overall good workout that will for sure make you sweat!  Some old school taebo moves mixed in with new moves that keep you moving.  The only thing I didn't care for was when the camera panned in on the audience and then back to the stage.  I'm use to watching the instructor and mirroring their move, however, flipping back and forth to the stage and then the live audience made it confusing and I lost count/beat a few times.  It seems that this happens more toward the beginning of the workout than the end.  I skipped through about the first 8 or so minutes where Billy does a short tutorial before getting into the heavy stuff.  Not for beginners in my book.",1414454400,4,662,4.385245901639344
8631946,5,B00HEM9QA2,This will make you sweat! Tough workout! Not for beginners. Billy focuses on coaching you through the moves and really keeps the tempo going.,1401580800,,141,4.916666666666667
