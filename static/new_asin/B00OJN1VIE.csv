8683907,5,B00OJN1VIE,"This third of four DVDs does a superb job of teaching how to improve you auditory reaction time. Because most cases of self-defense happen in the dark, improving your auditory reflexes is key. Sammy does a great job explaining how to do each drill, and keeps them simple, yet effective. This DVD is also great for improving your reflexes in shooting competitions such as IDPA and USPSA/IPSC, where you have to react to the sound of a timer. I highly recommend it.",1415232000,,463,4.658536585365853
