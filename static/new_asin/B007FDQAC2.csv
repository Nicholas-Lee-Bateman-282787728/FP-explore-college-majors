8515636,5,B007FDQAC2,"There are several reason why one would enjoy this film. 1) if you have children, you want them to watch to see what happens if you don't talk to someone about bullying or depression. 2) You love watching independent films which may lack a little in production quality but have solid story telling scripts. 3) You are supporting filmmaking at its core not the big budget production houses.

I had the privilege of seeing Hidden Rage in the theater and meeting the actors. You will enjoy the trip it takes you on through a high school loaded with much of what kids deal with nowadays. You will follow the lead character as he makes choices that are riddled with consequences. I thoroughly enjoyed the film. It's a great buy.",1342483200,2,722,4.596899224806202
8515637,5,B007FDQAC2,"I was privileged to attend a private screening of Hidden Rage before its DVD release, and I loved it.  The acting, production and writing aren't flawless, yet it still soars ahead of most of its Christian independent competition.  The main character is portrayed by a fantastic up-and-coming actor, and while school shootings have been done plenty of times already, the final third of the film avoids cliches and will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Buy this now!",1338768000,2,467,4.8125
8515638,5,B007FDQAC2,"I saw this film in the theater.  It's a powerful, well made movie with an important message about bullying and how it can lead to drastic violence in schools.  It should serve as a wake-up call to those who see the early warning signs and choose to do nothing, then wring their hands after it's too late to help.  The direction and cinematography is great and the performances compelling.  Students, parents and teachers should all take a look at Hidden Rage.",1338249600,3,459,4.62962962962963
