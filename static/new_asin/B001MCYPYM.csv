8326577,4,B001MCYPYM,"Interesting story about one of the first women equestrian vets in US. I enjoyed the read, only a few parts became a little technical.  I would recommend it.",1500422400,,156,4.571428571428571
8326578,4,B001MCYPYM,"OK, this film could be better made. But for those of us who've read ""Blessed are the Broodmares"" and ""Blessed are the foals"" and sat up all night during a precious mare's foaling with those two books as Bibles - it's a thrill to see Dr. Phyllis Lose and her little dog. Dr. Lose was a true pioneer, the first woman vet in Pennsylvania. She was an incredible horsewoman before that. The story of her life "" No Job for a Lady"" is fascinating. I've probably 500 books on training, dressage, and horseman in my library. But Dr. Lose's books deeply and profoundly touched my heart.  She is a unique woman, with grace, integrity, deep devotion to her work and to animals. I also loved hearing about her parents and sisters who lovingly supported her work. What a remarkable family. First read her autobiography and then watch this film. It will be much more meaningful.

  Yes, the first part of the film is more about Dr. Lose, and only the later part about the dog - however it's a wonderful heartwarming story throughout about a truly wonderful woman.  I loved this film and am very grateful it got made as a record of Dr. Lose.",1379721600,,1125,4.46829268292683
8326579,1,B001MCYPYM,"Even for $1.99 I was disappointed.  Not that the woman's story wasn't worth telling and the dog's abilities weren't worth show-casing, but the first 2/3 of the movie (about the dog's owner) was talking heads (good people all, just not dynamic or interesting in their story-telling) and the rest (the dog part) was collected TV news stories about the dog because he was going to star in a movie (which never got made so far as I can tell) -- and then we'd see him doing the same couple of tricks or being pulled around in a toy car.  No detailed stuff about the dog (not even a ""day in the life."")  Content-wise, it was just very much like watching a stranger's home movies -- you could tell it meant something to them, but it didn't translate into anything you'd want to watch for very long.

Even more irritating was the filmmaker's addition of scratches and stuff (and odd sepia tones) to the movie to make it look old-fashioned. What was that about?

I don't like to say that I ""hated"" it, but I couldn't bring myself to give it two stars.",1349654400,,1042,4.40625
