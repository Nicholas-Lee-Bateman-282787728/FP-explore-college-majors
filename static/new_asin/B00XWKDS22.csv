Kim Sae-ron and Bae Doo-na are both fantastic throughout this one.
Looking forward to many more great performances by Kim Sae-ron for many years to come!",1468368000,,170,4.896551724137931

(UPDATE November 2017 - very good company distributing the Korean ""all region"" - my disc had a skip and they were very quick to replace it; but 6 month down the way the replacement also acted up on several DVD/BluRay machines - so it runs okay about 25% of the time, so not reliable to really use).

Exactly as stated .. in runs perfect in my North American location.  Excellent quality .. picture is clear and the sound is far better than YouTube samples.  The menus are in Korean, but I found them extremely straight forward to figure out.

BONUS MATERIAL
Also a big surprise, in the Bonus Material, besides the usual Trailer are a bunch of very good out takes -- most out takes you can see why they were removed, but 75% of these are just excellent and I have to think the length of the movie was the only reason some were removed.  It would have been a real shame to loose these clips to the cutting room floor.

BRIEF SUMMARY
The movie is a profound one that takes some patience to understand .. it is all about labeling and how evil has the instinctive ability to use labels and perception to manipulate a system .. but kindness and compassion has to learn the same thing ""in kind"" in order to counter balance this effect.

STORY
A successful police offer, is sent to head a small outpost location due to some apparent misconduct.  She is told that if she can lead a quiet life (keep a low profile), then she should be able to return to the capital in a year.  However she keeps bumping into an abused young girl who sees her as a protector she has not had since loosing her mother - in a similar fashion to a duckling, bonding to her as if she was her mother.  The police officer (""chief"" of the station), as time passes the officer increasingly begins to not support the ""status quo"" of the community and ponders taking the enormous risk by basically stepping forward to act as a barrier to the abuse, while exposing herself to the scrutiny she was told to avoid.",1434758400,6,1988,4.360433604336043
