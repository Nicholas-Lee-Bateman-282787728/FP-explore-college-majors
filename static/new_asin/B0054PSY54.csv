4570097,4,B0054PSY54,"First a brief summary of the plot, the beginning of the film we see Arajan (aka Ray Winstone), an Afrikaner and veteran of the Boer War (two wars fought between the British Empire and the two independent Boer republics in Southern Africa) who has just arrived in New Zealand. From the ships roster his name is recognised by British veteran of the Boer war Major Carlyle who wants to meet him. Arajan was a guerrilla fighter and master tracker. Next we meet Kereamea (Morrison) a M'ori seafarer, who through no fault of his own is forced into an altercation with some soldiers, during the fight one of soldier's accidently kills a colleague but blames it on Kereama.

Major Carlyle enlists and promises Arajan a bounty to capture Kereama who is accused of killing the soldier.
Arajan catches up with Kereamea, who protests his innocence, but repeatedly escapes and is recaptured. Arajan and Kereamea get to know each other and a bonding of sorts occurs they then respect each other, and there is a showdown with British troops led by Major Carlyle. The outline of the plot kept brief so as not spoil. The landscapes and wilderness are breath taking, and fare amount of effort is made to make it look like the early 1900s. You need to pay attention to Ray Winston's characters back story as it is important, and leads to a much better understanding who he is and why he does what he does.

There are a small number of rather negative reviews about the film and while some aspects of the criticism levelled and have some slight merit, this film is rather good. This is not Sexy Beast or harsh east end London film and yes Ray Winston's accent is slightly poor, although it's not that bad. This film is certainly worth seeing, and if you're worried that you will dislike like it then rent it at least.",1320796800,8,1797,4.595015576323988
4570098,5,B0054PSY54,"I highly recommend this movie. Great acting, great views of New Zealand, just a great period piece overall. This could have worked in American theaters if people here were more accustomed to stories of foreign cultures and actual plot lines. You won't be disappointed with this film.",1319328000,2,283,5.042553191489362
4570099,4,B0054PSY54,"Needless to say,I was very surprised by this movie...It looked like a western, which my Husband loves, so I picked it up...although it was set in the Australian Outback, it could very well be set in the old American west. The title of the movie says it all. An aborigine is falsely accused of murder and he runs knowing he will not be believed. He and the Tracker have more in common that the Tracker has with the men that hired him.. There are light moments as well as the more serious aspect to it. It also had a surprise ending which made the entire movie worth watching. The actors were great although I only recognized one and he will be remembered from the last Indiana Jones movie...It is a great family movie and should be watched just for the history lesson. Well worth the time to see and watch.",1316908800,,805,4.373333333333333
4570100,4,B0054PSY54,"I ride horses, track wildlife, and enjoy a good western, so this movie caught my eye.  It's not a blockbuster, but it's a good watch.  The limited tracking in it is at least somewhat realistic, unlike so many movies, and the country is beautiful.  But it's the relationship between the two men that is so well done.  This is worth watching.",1315008000,5,340,4.524590163934426
4570101,4,B0054PSY54,"As some other reviewers mentioned, this is not a fast-paced action adventure!  However, it is a western with beautiful scenery, good acting, and a story line about an experienced tracker that ends up being tracked while he is in the process of tracking a man who is charged with murder and then deciding the man is not guilty and proceeds on a path of trying to save the man's life and still collect the reward money for finding him dead or alive!",1314316800,2,447,4.451219512195122
4570102,3,B0054PSY54,"""They're gonna hang me for something I didn't do."" Arjan (Winstone) is hired to track down and kill Kereama (Morrison) who is accused of murdering a soldier. When Arjan finally finds him Kereama swears he is innocent, when Arjan begins to believe him he is stuck in a bad spot. Kill him or be killed himself. This is a good movie, but very slow moving. The best thing I can say about this is that if you liked ""Serephim Falls"" you will love this one as well. It centers around the two main characters and what the deal with in one trying to do his job and the other convincing him he is wrong. The acting is very good and the scenery is outstanding. If you are looking for a movie to just put in and watch, this is not it. This is definitely one to pay attention to. Overall, a good movie, but very slow moving and not much action. I guess this is a western, but again it's a western the same way ""Serephim Falls"" is. Both good, but must be in the mood for them. I give this a B-.

Would I watch again? - Probably not.",1312416000,3,1018,4.09
4570103,4,B0054PSY54,"This film is set in 1903, Ray Winstone plays a Boer War veteran Arjan Van Diemen. The Boer War was the first time Colonial troops from New Zealand fought with the British. Part of that campaign included the burning of farms, a scorched earth policy and the herding of Boer families into the first `concentration camps'. Arjan has lost everything and like some of his former comrades, when the New Zealanders return home he went with them.

On arrival he is picked up by the authorities, as he was a notorious Boer guerrilla fighter. He is quickly released, and then a turn of events causes the British to commission him for help. That comes in the form of a Maori whaler, who after jumping ship gets caught in a compromising position with a lady of the night, and the drunken soldiers decide to teach `the savage' a lesson. In the ensuing fight one of them is killed, Kereama (Temuera Morrison) does a runner - as he knows he will be blamed.

Mr Winstone is then engaged to track him down. The film then takes us on a tour of the beautiful landscape of New Zealand, it is wonderful cinematography and the direction is superb from Ian Sharp. The plot is one of cat and mouse and the more that the two men discover about each other; the more they find they have in common. They trade passages from the scriptures in a psychological game to out do each other. This is not an action movie, but a drama/thriller according to the box, it is also a story of the human spirit. Ray Winstone does a really good job and this is despite being well outside his normal `comfort zone' of the cockney gangster type. His accent sounds pretty good too. There is some obvious sign posting to plot development, but that does not spoil things.

A quick word on the 'editorial review' above, it is factually wrong and should be taken with a pinch of salt - industrial grade.

What I really like is the balanced approach that is taken to the historical setting, and not all the Brits are cardboard cut out caricatures - which is refreshing. Part funded by the UK Film Council, this is another example why it should maintain its' funding, a great little gem of a film, that I can only recommend.",1309651200,29,2171,4.46095717884131

4570118,5,B0054PSY54,"A film about the torment of the soul and the track to get back to that which made you a man when you have been so very far away.  The Englishman dealing with the guilt of what he saw and what he participated in the Boer Wars.  The Boer affected by what he did and what he lost in that same war.  The man of the Maori was trying to get back to that which made him a man while running from a murder he did not commit.  The Maori was never lost, the Boer found his soul, and the Englishman is still searching for peace.  An excellent film, not for children and the scenery is an absolute plus.

The interplay of tortured souls, who is finding salvation, amazing scenery and the bigotry of conquerors is ongoing throughout the film and changes characters as you view.

Some of the lines and acting are so deliberate that you feel like they are reading them or being told what to do.

4570142,5,B0054PSY54,"***** 5 Stars ***** A very fine movie made in the mold of great earlier films, ""Tracker"" explores the complex relationship that can evolve between the captor and the captured ... even as the roles reverse at times.  ""The Bridge on the River Kwai""(1957) certainly comes to mind, as does the underrated (and quite rare) 1968 film, ""Hell In The Pacific"" with Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune - Kurosawa's favorite actor, and one of the greats of cinema history.  The acting in ""Tracker"" is outstanding - most of the movie consists of the interplay between Ray Winstone (""The Sweeney"" and many others), and Temuera Morrison (various 'Star Wars' flicks, but most importantly, ""Once Were Warriors"" - a truly great film worth seeking out).  And then there is the stunning beauty of New Zealand itself - coastland, forest and mountains, all are here, and all to die for - this is a memorably gorgeous film in almost every shot.  So just push 'play,' and get swept away in an exotic but-not-too-distant time in history (1908), and some all-too-human themes.  Thanks for reading!  (OK, for gun nuts and the simply curious:  the strange, boxy pistol carried by van Diemen (Ray Winstone's character) is a Mauser C96 from (duh) 1896; firing a 7.6325mm Mauser cartridge, it was the most powerful semi-automatic pistol around until the .357 Magnum was introduced in 1935.  No, you don't want to get even winged by this monster, as weird as it looks.  The C96 was famously carried by Lawrence of Arabia in WW1, and more horrifically, used to murder the last Russian Tsar, Nicholas, and his entire family in 1918 (and sadly, Anastasia was one of them, we now know).",1501977600,,1645,4.804964539007092

A Maori whaler beds a local woman in a barn, and three drunk British soldiers encounter and beat him.  During the fracas, the British sergeant accidentally skewers his own man through the neck with a pitch fork. He blames it on the Maori, and the others back his story up, including the woman. Von Diemen, an expert tracker, is hired to track the Maori.

Finding him is the easy part for the expert tracker. The Maori keeps getting away, and he and van Diemen keeps fighting. Finally the rest of the British party catch up with them. The Maori escapes in the night. Finally believing the Maori is innocent, Van Diemen provides a false trail to lead off the British, then catches up with the Maori at a sacred cave of his ancestors. The British eventually catch up with them once again, and something unexpected happens. To see what that is, please invest your time in this interesting film with beautiful scenery throughout!

Instead the writer wanted to tell us what what they we thinking without the truth of their development. Ray Winstone was good as he could be but the rest of the cast could not get past the writing.

Although as usual presenting the narrative that there are some ""good whites"" out there who believe in due process like the Army Lt. and Boer in this film, fighting against the ""bad whites"" who are racist because they are just evil.

Justice? Should we avenge the sins of others? Or seek atonement? Though not a great movie, it is a good one, worth more than the pittance of critical reviews on IMDB that weighed down the rating. TIP: turn on subtitles to better understand moments when Ray Winstone (the tracker) talks in hushed tones and a strong accent, as he often does in the first third of the flick. Winstone's acting here is worth watching. His portrayal never loses the weight of the burden pressing upon his soul. Sure, there are some trite moments, but also gripping ones. And while there is action, it's not an action movie. It is a movie about honor, one that is honorable enough to watch.",1499731200,,838,4.707482993197279

4570211,5,B0054PSY54,"Like many films that make it to the U.S. market, foreign made and born of conflict in places most Americans either have no knowledge of, nor of conflicts not heard of (such as the Boer War), this is a most excellent film standing in its own right.  I highly recommend it, for any Westerner can empathize with the humanity of Christian-schooled natives who do not lose their identities entirely, as well as the need for the vanquished to find self-respect and dignity living amongst their conquerors.  That said, this film explores these timeless themes against the magnificent backdrop of
1903 New Zealand, and it is a beautifully conceived film, in which the ""niceties"" of western justice and women's linen are placed in contradiction at just the right times.

I wondered at the end whether the victorious Major merely lied to soothe the conscience of van DImond (the Boer tracker) regarding the death of his family in South Africa.  This was another seemingly pointless war that brought out the theme's of man's inhumanity to man, easily justified in our
Bible.  Yet this is portrayed as bringing closure to van Dimond--however, it did not bring closure to me.

Also the PC license notwithstanding, there is no way an Afrikaner would socialize with non-Whites let alone a Maori, remember the Afrikaners instituted Apartheid around 45 years after the Boer war ended.

From Roman occupation of Northern Africa and the Middle East, other Europeans in Africa and Southeast Asia, the British in India, New Zealand and Australia, to the Americans all over the world, there's something about the European and his values that has allowed him to subjugate and wipe out whole races of people.

It's such a big concept to wrap one's mind around. But one way to get closer to this phenomenon is to examine it at a granular level and by way of the stories that contribute to the bigger whole.

TRACKER does that by telling an uncomplicated story of a group of British and a singular white South African hunting down a Maori man wrongfully accused of murder. The film scratches at the racism and systemic cultural bias Europeans have been guilty of in New Zealand and other parts of the world. The producers of the film give us great scenery, fabulous actors and some smart pacing and cinematography as well, making this a totally enjoyable film. It doesn't quite achieve being a perfect film for a few reasons. Primarily, I'm thinking, it doesn't fully accept whose story TRACKER actually is. If the titular character, I feel short changed. The film makers do a good job of examining a number of interesting characters but it fails to get particularly close to any. Still, a good film. Recommended.",1497052800,,1392,4.74793388429752

Also this movie does a superb job of highlighting native New Zealand's wilderness. In all but a few of the shots, the wilderness is shown without any manmade content (ie roads). There are some stunning shots, and the videographer did an excellent job.

I dare say that heavyset Ray Winstone probably got the most exercise he has had in 50 years, running around in the wilderness. Overall a very good movie with a nice moral touch.",1496275200,,706,4.64

4570283,5,B0054PSY54,"Written by Nicolas Van Pallandt and Directed by Ian Sharp, the UK (United Kingdom) Film Council and New Zealand Commission present: TRACKER, starring Temuera Morrison and Ray Winstone. This 102-minute, motion picture presentation comes to it's viewing audience in color, on a single-disc, DVD in 16 X 9 widescreen format in 5.1 English Dolby Digital Audio with optional English and Spanish, subtitles. And, this engrossing movie has the distinct honor of being, the: 'Official Selection of the Toronto International Film Festival', as well as, the 'Official Selection of the Valencia International Film Festival.' It's rare that a new film feature is the recipient of both prestigious 'Official Selection' Awards. And, as a bonus, the Special Features include interviews with the Cast & Crew, in addition to a Trailer Gallery. The story theme and content open with a brooding and mysterious yet intriguing Bounty Hunter (TRACKER), having undergone the horrific loss of his beloved wife and children, is trying to put his past behind him by relocating to the country in which he once served within it's military. Remembered and encountered by one of the remaining Military Officers, he is petitioned to join a hunting party in search of a supposed murderer. A Native, who was innocent of the crime. The TRACKER reluctantly agree's and soon finds himself at odd's with the hunting party, as too which direction the suspect went and how to go about tracking him. But, the innocent Native Countryman although wounded in a fight that branded him a killer, had a few surprises of his own..., for his TRACKER's. Knowing the lay out of the land, he successfully eluded them while heading towards his destination. The sacred site of his forefathers. Meanwhile, frustrated in their search for him, the tracking party decides to split up and the TRACKER, sets out on his own. And so..., the chase begins. And what it boils down too, is the real life game of 'hide and seek' between two men: The accused killer and the TRACKER. And once the two of them have their violent encounter..., the one-time game of 'cat and mouse' begins to fade, as they begin to disclose things about themselves that left them vulnerable. Particularly, to each other. The once hunted was deemed innocent and the TRACKER, was inadvertently forced to confront his past and do some deep, soul searching. As the rest of the hunting party caught up with the two of them, the TRACKER realizing that the Native was innocent had to make a life altering decision. That being: To sell out an innocent Native Man on two fronts. One, for the collection of the bounty money and secondly, give in to the prevalent racial and social prejudice. As opposed too, letting him go free. And, in so doing, hurt himself for life while simultaneously becoming aware of a life-altering secret. From of all people, the Military Officer under which he once served. This compelling motion picture deals with not only the will and measures that one will take to survive, but psychological warfare in the forms of fact verses fiction, guilt verses innocence, life verses death and the extent to which human beings are willing to confront their past, so that they can move on and into their future. Not only for the sake of justice for themselves and others, but more so for healing and closure. So, what happened to the Native? And, what did the TRACKER end up doing to himself..., that changed his entire life? Watch and see, as this intense, action and adventure drama, unfolds. Captivating entertainment and a brilliant movie that is not to be missed! A definite keeper for your DVD collection. Nina Kish",1490572800,,3642,4.913961038961039

You might want to do the same.  Ray Winstone's portrayal of a Boer finding himself was excellent.  There is an underlying spiritual message in this movie (redemption maybe?).

4570324,4,B0054PSY54,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film, the trailer looked like it would be fun and it was, but it also turned out to be a pretty decent film. Ray Winstone plays a Boer who travels to New Zealand after the Boer war. After he arrives he's tasked with hunting down a Maori who has been falsely accused of murdering a British soldier.

The film get's going quickly and it's as the hunt begins that the film starts to shine. Ray Winstone plays the tracker well in what is a relatively sedate role for him. His South African accent isn't great, but apart from that he does a good job with the role.

Temuera Morrison (who was excellent in Once Were Warriors) also plays his part well and the interaction between the two leads is the film's greatest strength. The story itself is a little predictable, but unfolds in a pleasing manner. Mention should also be made of the scenery, quite simply there are some stunning views throughout the film.

Overall its an excellent watch, reasonably slow paced, but that's fine, it gives the two leads time to breath and you can enjoy the scenery while they do so.",1382745600,,1097,4.50251256281407

The story, the acting, and the scenery all worked in perfect harmony to tell the story of two strong and determined men with completely different backgrounds who are thrown together by circumstances and are enabled by these same circumstances to make discoveries about who they were and where they were going in life.

This is certainly not a mindless action movie as the dialog between the two men has an important part in advancing the story but it also has plenty of action and keeps the viewer involved in what will happen next. A bonus is the beautiful scenery of New Zealand, think Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit.

4570346,5,B0054PSY54,"Superb movie. I will leave it at that. The acting could not have been better nor the storyline better told. A tremendous story shot amongst some of the most spectactular scenery one could ever imagine. IF New Zealand weren't such a liberal hell hole I would love to live there just to sit on the porch and look. It is probably against the law to sit outside in New Zealand however as the government there probably takes the view that the public display of the evil old human being is bad for the environment. Good thing this movie was set before the New Zealander Government went completely mad though.
Unusual to see the New Zealander home guard still using the Martini Henri rifle during the period so displayed. I would have thought that the Enfield would have been in use by then...probably my mistake and I am aware that the Martini rifle did remain in partial use until well into the early part of the 20th Century...don't know why I even thought about that much less mentioned it.
Back to the point. This is a must see movie for the entire family. Informative for both those ignorant of the Boer War and for those unfamiliar with the Maori People of New Zealand. Good movie for the entire family and truly a ""must see"".",1340668800,3,1226,4.502242152466367

If it's one thing I hate it's not being able to understand the dialog. While on that subject, the sound management of this movie is just horrible. I found myself chasing the volume up & down either trying to hear what was being said or trying not to be deafened. The filmography was obviously shot in several different formats. Some scenes were exceptionally bright & clear, while others may have well been shot with a camera phone. I couldn't finish the movie. When the Boer sat down with the Maori feeding him & talking with him, their whispering, dialect & the crappy sound together were more than I could bear anymore.

4570351,5,B0054PSY54,"Having just watched this movie and reading all the reviews, I felt the need to add my own.
Most people seem to cover the plot adequately but completely miss the point of what is truly
going on here.  Ray Winstone plays a displaced South African who lost everything in the Boer War.
Temuera Morrison plays a native New Zealand Maori who has witnessed the demise of his family and
culture to the British Empire as well.  While the plot is about the one man tracking the other in
the beautiful New Zealand countryside, the movie is really about these two men finding themselves
again.  Morrison left New Zealand at a young age and has returned for a reason.  Winstone has lost
home and family and is looking for his own salvation.  While on the surface, the movie is the plodding
tracking of an accused criminal, it is really the story of these two men finding redemption
in their own lives ... and just a little bit of payback to the Empire thrown in for fun.  This is not
a movie to sleep your way through, you need to pay attention to the back stories of these two characters
to truly understand their actions.  The movie is rated R for some blood and guts, but this is a story
written by someone who knows something about life and the human condition.  From the terms I've used,
I'd say I consider this a very spiritual movie, but I suspect the traditional church crowd might have
some issues with that.  A wonderful story, with beautiful scenery and a little surprise at the end that
should speak very loudly to the viewer.",1331424000,22,1525,4.456834532374101
4570352,4,B0054PSY54,"Surprisingly Interesting movie even though it was shot with a low budget.

It deals with racism, persecution, and justice. The background scenes are breathtaking with green forests, blue mountains covered with snow and beaches with clear water.

The acting of the two main characters is gripping.  The dialogues are touching and sharp-witted.

The ending is a big surprise. It`s illogical but it`s still interesting. In short, this film deservers 4 stars.
It`s One of the BEST LOW-BUDGET MOVIES I`ve ever seen.",1329868800,,510,5.2592592592592595

8456878,1,B0054PSY54,"I thought the movie was acceptable until Van Dieman became judge, jury and executioner. I love these liberal, progressive movies which condemn life as they would like others to see it, and then draw others into the fantasy they create, so they can appear to be righting the wrongs of yesterday by leaving nothing to build on for tomorrow? No civilization is perfect and whereas the Maori was quick to point out how his ancestors died he was not so quick to tell Van Dieman how the British soldiers died at the hands of Maori? It was comical how Van Dieman chafed at the thought of a New Zealand soldier arresting him for war crimes, saying the war was over. It was never over for Van Dieman and now he goes to Australia to settle scores over there, since the Aussies were also in the Boer War? The Boers were no less violent than the British and their allies in the war. This movie did not interest me one bit after the Maori escaped with the help of Van Dieman?.",1503446400,2,963,4.355555555555555
