Wolf</a>&nbsp;focuses on evidence of mountain lion--wolf conflicts.  On April 4, 2003, in Yellowstone National Park, a female mountain lion known as F-106 is found dead with wolf hair in her claws and teeth; other dead mountain lions show the dominance of the wolf packs, of which there are more than ten for a total of nearly five hundred animals since reintroduction in Yellowstone; a film of a mountain lion outrunning wolves and a coyote in Yellowstone is the only film evidence of the two predators actually interacting.  The documentary then shifts to the Bitterroot Mountains of Montana, where researchers have found five dead wolves killed by mountain lions.  Boone Smith and his tracking-dog team advance through deep snow in rugged, steep elevations up to 10,000 feet in searching for mountain lions, who are difficult to track as they move in loops through the forest -- I remember reading that mountain lions also move in circles when stalking prey; Boone comes within 7-8 feet of a hissing mountain lion on a ledge in order to show how the cornered cat would respond to a wolf pack.  Using an air-rifle, Ben Jimenez of Montana Fish, Wildlife And Parks shoots a biopsy dart at a mountain lion in a tree outside of Sula, Montana for a DNA population study.  In a remote canyon near Lolo Peak, Bryan McCravy describes finding a dead wolf with puncture wounds in the back of the skull and states that the Bitterroots have small wolf packs, which makes them more vulnerable to mountain lion predation.  In January of 2011, Dr. Kerry Foresman of the University of Montana places a camera near a bull carcass in the South Hills area of Missoula, Montana and films a fearful wolf leaving after less than twenty minutes and never returning, and a large mountain lion who regularly returned and fed at the carcass for two months.  Wolves' superior smelling and hearing that give them the ability to track animals one mile away also help them stay away from humans -- I remember reading that a man drove a wolf pack out of an area in Alberta, Canada by simply tracking them; close-up scenes of wolves and a mountain lion interacting are created with trained captive animals.  With a running speed of more than 35 miles per hour and a horizontal jump of more than 25 feet, mountain lions use their great physical ability in fleeing from wolves.  Boone places motion-activated cameras at two kill sites in an attempt to film a conflict and films a mountain lion growling and hissing in the darkness at two wolves, who are standing beyond the range of the camera.  There are many excellent long-distance scenes of snow-covered mountains and close-up scenes of dense forest.
