4496639,4,B004XQO8P0,"If you read my review of ""Hold On!"" featuring Herman's Hermits, you'll know why I'm happy about the band's film appearance.

This film is a benign 'sploitation of the popularity of Herman's Hermits.  The film features ""Herman"" and ""The Hermits"" in that now familiar cinematic version of a daily lifestyle routine shared with Cliff Richard (minus The Shadows), The Beatles, The Dave Clark Five, and the Monkees.

Pure fluff -- but spun gold if you were a pre-pubescent kid back in the sixties.

Look for the Willys Jeep and the other ""Herman'sHermitsmobiles""...",1400803200,,560,5.054347826086956
4496640,5,B004XQO8P0,Mrs. Brown pertains to a Woman & a Dog (Racer) which has such a CUTE theme. I watch this movie often.,1376956800,,101,3.857142857142857
4496641,2,B004XQO8P0,This film is just plain simple minded.  It was made to showcase the band against the background of an inane plot.,1372896000,2,113,4.380952380952381
4496642,5,B004XQO8P0,"If you love Herman's Hermits, you'll love this film. It's adorable, funny and I was pleasantly surprised by the boy's acting skills. I knew Peter Noone (Herman himself) had been to acting school, but the other boys were fine. Often when you see musicians acting in the film for the sake of being in a film, they can be a little awkward and wooden. Herman and the boys did a fabulous job.

Having said that, the film itself is a little odd. It's continuity between shots was not always good, it's storyline was odd and it's ending didn't make it sense. It used a few Herman's Hermits songs, but then had about three show tune style numbers, which was also odd.

I loved seeing a little bit of how England was (particularly Manchester) in the 1960s, I'm fascinated with England and also 20th century history, especially when it comes to everyday life and how people lived.

But again, most importantly, Herman's Hermits fans like myself will enjoy it. I suppose you don't have to be a Herman's Hermits fan, but because the film is a little odd the fact that it's Herman's Hermits won't make up for that.

As for the DVD quality itself, it was fine. As if I'd bought it in a shop!",1371168000,,1177,4.46046511627907
4496643,4,B004XQO8P0,Mrs. Brown You've Got A Lovely Daughter is a fun and light flick.  Loved the Herman's Hermits!  I'm a greyhound mom and enjoyed the greyhound!  She was the star!  This would be a nice film to have in a greyhound owner's collection.,1343779200,2,231,4.428571428571429
4496644,5,B004XQO8P0,"After the debacle of their debut film, ""Hold On!"", this movie is a welcome surprise.  Set exclusively in England the home cooking seems to serve Herman and the lads well.  They seem to be invigorated and to be having a lot of fun.  It also helps that the film features the cream of Britain's acting world (Stanley Holloway, Lance Percival, Marjorie Rhodes, and Mona Washbourne) who can't not be a positive influence.  The songs are also better.  Instead of bubble gum they seem to be influenced by the Kinks.  Only gripe is they play a truncated version of ""There's a Kind of Hush"".  Director Saul Swimmer expertly juxtaposes the grit of working class Manchester with the glam of swinging London.  The clothing is something Austin Powers would salivate over.  In some circles the Hermits are denigrated as being a teeny bopper act but this film serves notice that they want to and should be taken seriously.  Noteworthy is the film was produced by Allen Klein, notorious manager of the Beatles in their waning days.  Also, the music arranger is John Paul Jones who later was the bassist for Led Zeppelin.",1333238400,8,1104,4.757894736842105
4496645,4,B004XQO8P0,"I got this for my daughter who is 28.  She said she liked it a lot.  Herman's hermits were big when i was a teeny/bopper, and then when my daughter was young, we introduced her to some of their hits.
Thanks for the memories!!",1317945600,5,225,4.090909090909091
4496646,5,B004XQO8P0,"This movie starring Herman's Hermits was really a cute musical!! Even though being an american I didn't understand all the british terminology,I actually enjoyed it better because it was very british,there wasn't one american accent there,it was enlightning for me plus I thought their supporting actor Stanley Holloway was a charming addition. Fun for the whole family regardless where you're from!!",1309996800,5,400,5.573770491803279

4496651,5,B004XQO8P0,Mrs. Brown You've Got A lovely Daughter was released in 1968. Herman's Hermits starred. Plot about entering their dog in a race. Lots of songs. A film you can watch and enjoy with anyone.,1436486400,2,187,4.529411764705882
4496652,1,B004XQO8P0,"This could have been a really cute movie ,if the writers would have stuck to a boy meets girl plus music and dancing plot ... like the other Herman's  Hermits movie. "" Hold On"". The front of the box makes you think it is a fun 1960's ""groovy"" movie. But its boring from the get go !!",1433808000,,283,3.9649122807017543
4496653,5,B004XQO8P0,"When this & Hold on came out their impact were minimal. After the Beatles movies , DC5 movie & Ferry Cross The Mersey interest in films about British bands seemed to be on the wain. Couple that with the Hermits perceifed uncool image the movies didn't even play in my city till a year later they were a dive in double bill. Not long ago a friend got a copy of both films. I was surprised to find myself enjoying them enough to buy copies myself. Then I found a complete collection of sealed vinyl copies of all their albums. In retrospect the records &  movies were far better than their reputation. The movies themselves are a slice of a certain time that is still very watchable. I played Mrs Brown, Ferry Cross & Wild Weekend for a group of 17 to 20 year olds (they had already seen Help & HDN).. They loved them enough to lean 7 songs from the 3 movies to play in their band as the only cover songs they do next to their originals & the songs always go over well. Herman's Hermits didn't deserve the reputation they had. If you haven't been introduced this & a Best of is a great place to start, then delve deeper. You'll find many 60s British pop rock as good as or better than many of their higher reputationed contemporaries. Then go see Peter Noon's current Hermits live. You won't be sorry",1430697600,,1298,4.297959183673469

It's a good story, a bit corny but the story line is good, the plot is good, and it gives you the feeling of living in a simpler time. It's got a super cute greyhound dog throughout the movie.
