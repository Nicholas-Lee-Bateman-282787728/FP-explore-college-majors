8547583,5,B00A7048YW,I love this movie! As the viewer above me stated its so bad it's good! Just found out there are 2 sequels to this movie as well. I'm more than happy to watch them and looking forward to Doug so. If you love this one you'll be curious about the other two. Look out for ' OH MY GHOST 2 and 3,1462233600,,289,3.6774193548387095
8547584,4,B00A7048YW,"This movie is pure camp.  It's ridiculous and it's meant to be.  So, buyer beware.  I thought it was hysterical, once I got past the bad makeup, horrible acting and bizarre storyline, the ending is....there are no words. I mean it's a haunted boarding house run by retired Drag Queens with a little kick boxing thrown in, what's not to love?

Definitely R-rated though.",1374710400,,369,4.71875
