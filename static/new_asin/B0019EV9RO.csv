8273663,3,B0019EV9RO,"'Swinging Wives'(1973) is a typical docu-drama ""based on actual case histories"" chronicling the unlikely notion that most marriages are ""till death do you part"".
It's a much better example of a true grindhouse flick than 's of what's promoted on Amazon as 'Grindhouse', and for lovers of those glorious bygone days, a good relic to indulge in. Hot pants, micro-miniskirts, skin tight tops and no artificial additives to the tasty retro Euro babes - all the gals are lookers and the flesh flows frequently, so the semi-moronic mindlessness of the movie is modestly mitigated, thankfully.

'Between The Covers'(1972) is the weaker of the two, a Berlin produced farce revolving around magazine subscription salesmen and their sexually salacious sales calls. It's 'Love, American Style' set in the Eastern Block, with loads of T&A. The problem is, it appears to have been edited with a chainsaw. This one falls into the abyss of ""so bad it's good"", culminating in a sance for degenerates that centers around a nude female harpist, old-school backscratchers (?) used to titillate a nude woman on the sance table, and candles shaped like large phalluses - don't ask...

Both of these flicks are German made, so I'm not sure why it's titled 'Burbank Drive-In', but if you happen to be a lover of Eurobabes with natural bodies, natural tans going around 'au natural', kick back with a brew or three and enjoy the flesh prance for your pleasure.",1280707200,2,1436,4.979166666666667
