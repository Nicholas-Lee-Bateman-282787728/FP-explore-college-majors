4982436,4,B006BZ8O3I,"If you like zombie movies, then THE DEAD is probably one of the best of the bunch.

It was shot in Africa and stars Rob Freeman as an Air Force Officer, the sole survivor of a plane crash in an area of that continent where the dead seem to be coming back to life and attacking the living.

After several close escapes from the zombies, Freeman meets up with an African Army sergeant, Prince David Osei, whose village has been overrun by the dead creatures, and the two join forces.

Written and directed by Howard J. Ford and Jon Ford, The Dead has some very exciting, suspenseful action sequences and also features some nice scenery.

As indicated in the opening paragraph, if you are an aficionado of zombie movies, this one should be your cup of tea.

The DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes audio commentary from thr Ford Brothers, deleted scenes and a ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette.

4982437,5,B006BZ8O3I,"I was too impatient to wait for the USA release so, I've had this a while under PAL version from AmazonUK.  Trust me, if you will, you will enjoy this film if you harken to the Romero Zombies that move slow, are in various stages of creeping necrosis, and quietly get close to you before, you are aware they are getting in arms reach.  I really have enjoyed this film and after just a few months, have watched it about 9 times so far, and it has not gotten old yet - so wait and rent first if you wish, but my advice is to NOT be afraid of purchase.  AND if you want extra horror --- check out the ""making of video diary"" (if they add it to the USA release)and see how much garbage they had to put up with just in trying to get this made, from illness to Port Authority issues and local Police issues.",1327363200,34,801,4.0251572327044025

4982439,4,B006BZ8O3I,"Shot in Africa by the talented writer-director brothers Jonathan and Howard Ford, this low-budget zombie movie is raw, grainy and thought provoking.  The film, set on the scorching, pitiless landscape on which survivors fight a virus that animates the living dead, has all the required visceral jolts, but also tells a straightforward story that twists expectations and ends with a shock.  Make no mistake, there's still life left in this venerable genre that shows no signs of dying.",1327276800,4,484,5.1923076923076925
4982440,4,B006BZ8O3I,"This is not the high flying, immature zombie action movie that seem to be over saturating the genre... This is a true piece of film making at its finest. It may appear slow to some, but again it's not an action film. It's a journey film that takes you along the rough African desert, infested with The Dead. This film answers all the survival questions you may have while trying to live through extreme situations. For example, how long can you outrun THEM without a vehicle, how far can you go before your body is exhausted, is it possible to sleep? And so on... The acting is great, especially without A list Hollywood actors to distract you from the story. There are human emotions pushed to extremes as far as surviving and/or trying to reunite with loved ones hundreds of miles away. As well as elements of friendship. The cinematography is beautiful and at times even creepy. And last but not least the effects are excellent! Very minor CGI, it's mostly all REAL make up effects. I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed this film. Don't MISS OUT!",1326412800,4,1056,4.563157894736842
4982441,4,B006BZ8O3I,"An evacuation flight crash lands off the coast of Africa and now an American must try and survive against a zombie outbreak in rugged foreign terrain. I've been wanting to see this for awhile so I'm glad it was finally released. The movie just looks beautiful and of course that can be attributed to the wonderful locales. And then to add some rather amazing looking zombies to the mix, it adds a wonderful dichotomy. To be honest, the story is pretty standard stuff. People trying to survive in a land overrun by the undead. But it's the way that the material is handled that makes this movie so good. Also, it's really well acted. And actually, I'm not a hundred percent sure I like the lead. At times he was great and other he kind of hammed it up. But everyone else was pretty stellar. And then there's the FX work. Right from the get-go I was blown away. The first zombie shown had some incredibly make-up and a certain injury that kind of made me wince. Plenty of blood, plenty of zombie action and plenty of humanity. A great movie.",1325980800,44,1039,4.445026178010472
4982442,4,B006BZ8O3I,"Very good zombie movie.  Very realistic, mostly action, little dialogue.  Thankfully there are no dumb jokes or stupid one-liners that a lot of movies seem obligated to provide which tends to ruin them.  The movie is shot in Africa.  Similar to a J.L. Bourne type story with a military survivor doing mostly smart things to keep alive.  But a pretty tragic ending.  There is a sequel but the story is not really related, and doesn't look as good.  Admit I have not seen part 2 but the trailer tells a lot.  This one is very decent though.  Very little CGI, just about all the effects are done on camera and are done well.  There is a fair amount of zombie blood/gore, so be warned.  Not for kids.
Overall very good, would recommend if you're looking for a decent zombie flick.",1473984000,2,776,4.4714285714285715

4982450,5,B006BZ8O3I,"I enjoy zombie movies but, let's be honest, most of them are kind of stupid.  There's basically two formula's for a zombie movie.  The first one was set by George Romero's classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-of-the-Living-Dead/dp/B009YXKXEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night of the Living Dead</a>.  A group of people hole up somewhere (a farm house, a shopping mall) and try to outlast the zombie apocalypse.  A more recent plotline has been the road trip, as seen in George Romero's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diary-of-the-Dead/dp/B003EY62GK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diary of the Dead</a>.  People on the road, trying get to someplace to hole up and outlast the zombie apocalypse. And this was the plotline for just about every zombie movie made, many of whom just became a version of slasher film, where the biggest attraction was an ever increasing special effect budget invested in more creative (and gorier) ways to dispatch zombies and victims.  Even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zombieland/dp/B0030B624E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zombieland</a>&nbsp;followed the road-trip formula.  Then came&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Walking-Dead/dp/B0152ZY7KQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Walking Dead</a>&nbsp;and everything changed.

Now it was possible to use the genre as what George Romero originally intended -  an examination of human character under extreme (and admittedly bizarre) conditions.  This movie is a great addition to the genre.

It can also be described as a road trip. Rob Freeman plays an American mechanic stranded somewhere in Africa at the outbreak of the zombie plague.  After surviving a plane crash, he manages to scrounge together a working truck.  While looking for some means of escape he runs into a soldier who's left his unit to hunt for his son, portrayed in an excellent performance by Prince David Oseia.

Unlike the waves of zombies we're used to seeing, such as in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/World-War-Z/dp/B00EL8JCGU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">World War Z</a>, the expanse of the African countryside allows our unlikely heroes a luxury of time, comparatively speaking, to assess their situation, respond to new challenges as they arise, and in the process we're treated to an unusually compelling story, slow in parts, but not an in your face, non-stop blood bath.

However, be advised that while few in number, the gory scenes are extremely realistic, some of the most realistic I've seen in a long, long time.  Look for the first zombie seen in the movie, struggling along on one good leg, the other so fractured that bones stick out and the leg bends in bizarre ways I haven't seen in the movies before.  I still don't know how they did it.

So, I really enjoyed this movie.  It moves at a slower pace than most of the genre, but I found that allowed me time to get to know the characters and actually care about them, unlike the swarms of skimpily-clad teens thrown into your average slasher film just to up the body count.  Well done, and definitely five star material.",1456531200,2,3261,6.078602620087336

After sitting through this slow, lumbering storyline, not to mention the slowest, unscary portrayal of the Undead I've ever seen, but nothing interesting happen. This soldier's journey was rough and sad, no doubt. But it could have been really action packed with vicious ravenous zombies attacking our hero's like wild animals.
  Instead we get turtle-like speed zombies that are absolutely worthless, and in threatening. The movie was more of a drama about a stranded American soldier trying to find a way back home. There were a couple horror elements thrown in when a jump scare happens... Twice! I was very disappointed because this movie had potential. Good thing I only spent $3.99 for it!

4982469,5,B006BZ8O3I,"Some films have a beautiful simplicity to the way the story unfolds and ""The Dead"" is a great example of this.

The outbreak AND spread have already been in high gear and that is where we find one of our two main characters -- an American Lt. Murphy, an engineer and mechanic -- in the air somewhere above Africa in a plane mechanically doomed to crash. Crash it does and Murphy is the sole survivor. Sgt. Daniel Dembele is a deserter who heads back to his home village to see it is not only ravaged by the dead, but his son is conspicuously missing.

Murphy and Dembele cross paths in the grasslands after Murphy has rigged a broken down truck to run (but oh-so-tenuously). Murphy is looking to find the nearest airport and possibly find a flight back to the US. Dembele is looking for his son in the chaos.

Just the plot line of two men hoping to slug their way through a zombie-infested African outback is horribly frightening and Howard J. Ford and Jonathan Ford (both co-writers and co-directors) carried this out masterfully. Not only are the dead frightening in waves, but in the pitch black night where your hearing can play tricks on you and in the middle of the day while you are attempting to drive in an outback devoid of roads having had no sleep in the past 2 days.

I had heard good things about this film, but I had no idea it was going to be this good. Some films of this genre work on the audience's fears with actions sequences, chases, assaults, etc. ""The Dead"" works constantly on its audience with suspense and utter despair. How can Murphy find a flight back to the US in this catastrophe? How can Dembele possibly find his son when so many have already died?

It is a subtle, low-key, but high-tension film that is certainly worth your time. I also give all the credit to the makers in that there are no unintentionally campy errors in the action, make-up, special effects, or acting for that matter. This was a first-rate effort and worth a 5-star rating.",1428019200,,1981,4.476454293628809

 This interesting film had an entire family involved in the making of the movie.  The Ford brothers, Jon and Howard, co-directed the film.  Howard also produced it.  Jon and Howard co-wrote it.  Amanda Ford played as an extra.  Jon Ford played as an extra.  Howard Ford played as an extra.  Jon
Ford is credited with the cinematography.  Howard Ford did the editing.  And a Ford child played 
Baby on the plane.  They threw themselves into the film
 This is the first film that I can remember that the makers shot in Burkino Fasso, the African nation that many stamp collectors know under its old name of Upper Volta.  They also shot some scenes in Ghana.
 But how is the movie?  Well, pretty good.  The director brothers had a good time making this one.  It seems like an art house take on what a Zombie flick should be.  They spend a great deal of effort on setting up interesting and artistic shots, showing bare foot Zombies slowly shuffling along by only filming their feet, as an example.  There are lots of shots of colorful sun downs too.  It is slow paced and there is not very much dialog.  The Oasis of the Zombies has a similar pace or more so but it is a terrible movie.  This one is slow but interesting rather than slow and stupid.
 The Ford's use real actors for the two leading roles.  Rob Freeman plays Brian, an American solider/engineer marooned in Liberia after a plane crash.  Freeman has played in a couple of other films. The downed plane crashed in an escape attempt from a Zombie outbreak.  Prince David Oseia has several Ghanian film credits.  He plays a local soldier who befriends the American while seeking his family.  The two guys are very stoic, saying very little as they drive around in the bush trying to stay alive and find the Liberian soldier's missing son.
 The Zombies are extra slow which I liked.  They are so slow that we think that our heroes can actually stay away from them and keep their lives.  There are a lot of them however.  We see singles roaming the bush every few minutes, even in remote areas.  Since this is the beginning of the outbreak, the Zombies are not rotting, just staring with ping pong eyes.  The chomping is within accepted limits of good taste, no gross out close ups just for the sake of stimulating out gag reflex.
 We do end the film with a tiny ray of hope, which I like.  I thing nihilism is boring.
 This film was clearly shot on a tiny budget but it still was able to cast hundreds of extras as Zombies.  I applaud the Ford brothers for this strong two and a half brain effort.  I would like to see their sequel The Dead 2: India  if only to see what the Fords can do with a little more money.
 The Dead is R rated for gore.  It runs one hour and 45 minutes and could be improved by some strong editing.

4982507,5,B006BZ8O3I,"An extremely intelligent film. A year or so ago, Brad Pitt et al tried to sell the world on what still remains a rather peculiar sub-genre or horror, albeit one that is bursting at the seams into every other realm of popular culture: the zombie flick. Never forget its roots in the simple cinematic handcrafts of George Romero. Pitt et al tried to give it the Christopher Nolan (i.e. post 9/11) treatment, and brought to fore a bunch of interesting truths about the world and especially the way the world is likely to be if we enter that state of permanent triage we're all so afraid of...not at all what the public was interested in seeing, but I thought it was a noble effort.
Far more noble, however, this stunning film which reminds us how nightmarish reality already is in many parts of Africa. Yes, this movie is far more about Africa than it is about zombies. Tribal life, Bedouin life, internecine military struggles, famine, isolation, and a thriving, resilient and defiant culture, these are all woven brilliantly into the tapestry of this zombie tragedy. A real eye-opener.",1412640000,,1084,4.7712765957446805
4982518,4,B006BZ8O3I,"Set in Africa, a zombie outbreak has taken form and the population is being wiped out. An American soldier by the name of Lt. Brian Murphy (Rob Freeman) finds himself stranded in the country after a failed escape attempt. He joins up with an African soldier by the name of Daniel(Prince David Osier), and together they try to survive the zombie horror. -summary

 Amongst horror fans, I think it can still be agreed that the foreign regions such as Britain, Canada, and even France has been kicking the U.S.'s a** when it comes down to quality horror films over the last 5 years at least. Had it not been for films such as Eden Lake, Let the Right One In, Inside, and The Horde. There's a good chance I would have abandoned the genre completely by this time. The zombie genre more than anything else has been nothing but frustrating to weave through. Thankfully, The Walking Dead has breathed quite a bit of life into the genre, along with The Dead, directed and produced by Howard J. Ford. This movie proved to be an entertaining watch that relied more on its themes and atmosphere than an actual plot. The film was released in 2010, but it made it to American shores in 2012. As I always mention, if you're searching for a straight up zombie terror romp minus the comedic bull**** then here's the movie for you.

 The plot follows Brian as he hopes to find a plane he can hopefully repair and leave the island. Daniel is clinging on to hope that his young son is out there still alive while trying to find him. After finishing this movie and giving it quite a bit of thought, the lack of a real plot quickly became a non issue. It seems to me Ford's true aim was to stimulate the audience's imagination, by creating a fully believable and even stressful environment with the small cast to go along with it. He forsakes the used to death theme, ""Is man the real monster?"", and instead simply focuses on the setting which proves to be every bit as a lethal obstacle as the walking dead. The unforgiving sun, the lack of food, and very little water appeared to carry far more dramatic appeal than a group of survivors attempting to get along. The atmosphere is very well used all around; the small amount or complete lack of music during certain scenes enhances the creep factor quite a bit. The somewhat obvious moments where zombies are going to appear possessed more of an impact than usual for me, this was likely due to the stylistic choices in the build up.

 The characters may feel like stereotypes yet I still cared about their plight. I'll say this had something to do with their development, but more to do with the heavy use of its themes. It seemed indeed tough at times for them to cling to hope, when it became apparent that there was just nowhere to really escape to. I felt for Brian the most though, because he was completely out of his element. He was in a foreign land with no friends or relatives he can even dare to count on, and adding to his stress was the constant lingering thought of the plague reaching the US and taking his family there from him. His descent towards despair was indeed believable. Ford accomplished his task in making Brian into a sympathetic character for me.

 Along with the set up and well use of atmosphere; the realistic-like zombie make up, prosthetics, and CGI free special effects stood out a great deal to me. This is definitely a world I wouldn't want to be a part of. The shambling zombies have a great deal of detail to them, when wearing the wounds gruesomely at times of being past meals, with torn up mangled faces and broken bones piercing through their skin. If I had to make a comparison between these and the Walking Dead, I'll probably call it even at least. The gore is in pretty large doses, with bullets going straight through eyes and heads, plus the zombie chow sessions are as disturbing as they should be. My only gripe would likely be is that there were many segments where it was quite dark, and I couldn't really enjoy the zombie mayhem the way I really would have liked to. While the acting was decent enough for the film, it was nothing I would dare claim to be special.

 The Dead is a simple, yet very effective horror film, that relies heavily on its slow methodical atmosphere build up. Despite the bit of carnage to be found, I can imagine the pace being an issue for the more fast-paced zombie fan. If zombie films the likes of Zombieland is more your thing, then you probably won't enjoy this. The film maintains a very serious and consistent tone, and I can imagine the ending not being to everyone's liking. Personally, The Dead is probably the best zombie movie I seen in the last decade or so. I know that's not saying anything at all, but I tell you, if our foreign horror buddies continue to drop gems like these, then there's plenty of hope.

Pros: Heavy use of setting, quite a bit of action and gore

Cons: Slower moments, will not appeal to the ""zomedy"" crowd",1412640000,,4954,4.480044345898005

4982536,4,B006BZ8O3I,"The Dead, directed by the Ford Brothers, follows American engineer Brian Murphy after the last evacuation plane from Africa he was on crash-lands off the coast. Cut off from the rest of the world, he begins to trek across the inhospitable landscape as the dead begin to rise. But when his path crosses that of Sgt. Daniel Dembele of the African military, they band together to survive and look for Daniel's son, who is traveling with other soldiers to a safe zone.

The Dead is a truly unique and incredible journey unlike any other, actually shot on the plains of Africa, and acts more as a road film than the standard zombie movie. The direction is really smooth, and captures the tense & depressing situation with finesse. The script is surprisingly good, and surprisingly devoid of constant dialogue, which actually helps to show the loneliness the characters' experience, and a realistic view on how quiet the world would become and how the lack of human contact and communication affects us. The acting is good, but nothing award-worthy. The effects are top-notch for a limited theater, low-budget film, and the musical score is very effective, helping to build the atmosphere and tension.

The Dead is a must-own for fans of zombie movies, and a must-see for those who really like slow-moving thrillers or ""road"" movies.

4982541,4,B006BZ8O3I,"First off I'll admit this movie failed on a few levels, mostly in what feels like a lack of story. This isn't a typical zombie movie.

Pluses of this movie are how it takes place in Africa. Kudos for the mostly black cast. The initial scene of the white guy coming over the sand dune is worked well. For a minute I felt like I was watching some high definition video. But getting into the story we have a plane crash. Our white hero makes it to shore.

The white hero goes into the jungle. He eventually finds a broken down but fixable truck. Here the white guy meets up with the black guy. Together the two travel the country in an old truck. Zombies were everywhere. I thought the story being set in Africa was quite a good take on the undead genre.

The acting is quite good even if the plot leaves one wondering. This movie has the feel of a 70's zombie movie.

The ending is ok but most fans probably wanted to see more.

When Murphy's path clashes with that of Sergeant Daniel Dembele, they join forces...all the while battling against the ever-present threat of zombies!

I'll admit, the first time that I watched The Dead- It took a little while to sink in just how good the film was. I guess I'd watched so many slick zombie films lately that I forgot about the old school zombie films that I'd watched in the past that creeped me out good fashion. Don't get me wrong, I know The Dead isn't an old school zombie film but it was filmed that way. Watching The Dead; you can see The Ford Bros. drew inspiration from Zombie(Lucio Fulci's zombie film), the Living Dead series and other classics from years ago when zombies were really scary. It takes itself seriously and it shows. You'd be surprised at what the cast and crew went through just to get this film made(Rob Freeman contracted Malaria during shooting for the film among other things).

There is 'nothing' popcornish about this movie.  It takes itself 'very' seriously...perhaps a little closer to what might really happen.

I have to admit I've got a stack--maybe two- of 'end of mankind' type movies.  Regardless of the nay-sayers this one is, so far, better than the rest.  No, there is no dark humor here...no sluts taking their cloths off so the producers make more money and in the other movies the writer probably used to be the producers first cousin...if there is cussing and swearing--I missed it.

It's one main attribute is...it's deadly serious.  Takes place in Africa...not here.

I do my best not to have spoilers so here goes.  If you are looking for the fast-moving, frenetic zombies, this is not the movie for you.  If you want loud, obnoxious characters making dumb decisions, not the movie for you.  There is a weird sense of calm about the movie and even the zombies themselves, perhaps the beautiful wide open space contributes to this -- and it is beautiful land.  Two main characters try their best to survive, with Daniel quietly desperate to find his (adorable) son and Rob just desperate to find a way out to reach his family.  It is an interesting twist in that in zombie movies people typically search for a place to hole up and seek a reprieve from the undead -- here that is virtually impossible as there are so few places to hole up in.  There is some good gore (you must have gore) but you could outrun the zombies if you had to; the problem is, where would you run?  They need not move fast, it's as if they know eventually their sheer numbers will usurp their lack of speed -- sadly, everyone else seems to know that too.

It was a well made believable movie featuring Romeros classic slow zombies which are the type I prefer.  The story was somewhat unique in that it takes place in Africa but I found it interesting all the same.  It's slow paced so if you ONLY prefer fast paced action than this definitely isn't for you.

Yes, this is a zombie movie in the truest sense in that they refuse to tell you how or why it has happened but instead sticks to the characters and their personal stories. All of the zombies look great, the main characters are believable, and the plot is very easy to follow and keep with. The best part to me is the Ford Brother's use of the African locals who themselves have been injured by war, disease, and other facts of life in Africa as extras. The broken legged man in the early scenes of the movie is not SFX, it's his real leg. See that guy missing an eye and an arm? Chances are he does not have them without the cameras rolling as well.

The only detraction is that it tends to drag on a bit in the middle, but overall it is a great return to storytelling, good zombies, and a plot that I can get behind.

The zombies are creepy.  They are utterly passionless...they show no malice, no hostility, nothing...they feed because that's what they do.  Creepy.

The movie has a claustrophobic feel.  This is partly because the camera angles are usually low.  Little sky is visible, so you get a closed-in feeling.  Another major reason is the ubiquity of the zombies.  No matter how far you drive, the place you stop is just like the place you left...no matter how hard you try, you can't get out.

That is, with the exception of two soldiers, one African and one American, who struggle to survive only in the hopes that their families might still be alive in some far-off place beyond the desert sands. The Ford Brothers have the potential to become this generation's Fulci and Lenzi, stepping out into the genre with what is sure to become a cult zombie sensation! THE DEAD not only offers extreme gore, but extremely realistic gore, and in all of the most unexpected ways. Unlike the new DAWN OF THE DEAD or 28 DAYS LATER, these are your granddaddy's zombies. Stiff. Slow-moving. And most of all, DEAD, not infected. The film has a crisp documentary look and feel, and the safety of daylight no longer applies when the majority of the events occur under the blistering African sun. For everything it lacks in story, it more than makes up for with its somber mood and chilling atmosphere. Although they exchange relatively little dialog, Murphy and Dembele share a genuine rapport, and are very likable heroes. Prince David Oseia gives a particularly devastating performance as he looks out at the lifeless bodies of his people, strewn across the African plains like so much garbage. THE DEAD can be read as a tragic allegory of the current AIDS epidemic in Africa, with the United States being both the first to arrive with aid and the first to bail out when the situation became uncontrollable, leaving the rest to die. A notable entry in the ongoing chronicles of the undead.

4982559,5,B006BZ8O3I,"The Dead is a 2010 zombie survival horror set in Africa and announces the arrival of the Ford Brothers to the world's horror scene and does so in spectacular fashion, while the Fords give themselves some cheeky cameos as zombie fodder along the way! Setting the film in Africa provided for me, as a viewer from a western country, a unique take on a well-tread film path; the searing African heat and the daily battle for survival in the sun added another dimension to this particular zombie flick.

The film itself opens with pace and there is little in the way of filler throughout. The Dead focuses on two main characters, with limited dialogue but I would suggest to you that the film does not suffer for this but conversely, it benefits from it since the feeling of isolation in the massive parched landscape of the Dark Continent is further amplified by the plight of the duo and the souls they encounter along the way. As I said, the filming location is unique but there was little in the way of overall character development even though there are really only two central characters. However, with a film such as this, character development is not entirely essential when it is the character's goals that are driving them onwards here.

For me, there was perhaps a little too much in the way of spiritualism but i am willing to concede that this is probably in keeping with the melting pot of religions in Africa. The special effects were spot on and very impressive considering the film was shot on such a low budget that the cast regularly went for 24 hours without eating...

The film itself was not without its own problems. Director Howard Ford was mugged at knifepoint in the first week of filming, sickness spread throughout the crew, one young actor suffered from typhoid and Rob Freeman was struck down with malaria, had to be on a drip for two weeks and was allegedly three days from death... seems like zombies were the least of their troubles!

The Dead was beautifully shot on location in Burkina Faso and Ghana (and the UK) and the music, although not typical of a survival horror zombie flick, adds to the tension and is simply mute at certain points, allowing the viewer to tune in to the characters panicked breathing as they wait for what's round the corner...and there are quite a few ""jumpy bits"" and plenty of gore too.

In a field of increasingly similar zombie flick offerings, The Dead stands out from the crowd. My advice is simple: get it.",1352764800,3,2471,4.632420091324201
4982560,1,B006BZ8O3I,"I think the intention of this film was to show the emotional impact on the survivors rather than just the constant barrage of flesh eaters.  If so, it failed miserably.  The actors were wooden and one note and there just wasn't much action of any kind except in small spurts when the truck broke down or got stuck.  It was slow, almost crawling and so you think eventually there will be a payoff - some big meaningful ending, right?  Not really. The main actor had fewer expressions than Kristen Stewart and none of them seemed to fit the situations he found himself in.  He just looked perpetually confused. Zombie movies are not usually stellar cinema, let's face it, but at least they should be entertaining.  The name honestly describes the film better than I will be able to  - it's dead and not in a good way. Just skip this one altogether.  You'll thank me.",1351900800,3,864,4.529032258064516
4982561,5,B006BZ8O3I,"THE DEAD

Zombie movies seem to be coming out like crazy over the last couple of years. And with the success of ""The Walking Dead"" on AMC I am sure they will continue to come out. For me personally I love it and if this film is a sign of things to come then thank you ""Walking Dead"". I say that because it seems like more serious zombie films are being made. Don't get me wrong I like most of the horrible ones but I love the really good ones.

The film follows a U.S. Army engineer named Brain who survives a plane crash in Africa; he was trying to escape the zombie out break there. As he makes his way across the rough terrain of Africa he comes across a man named Daniel who is an African solider. They don't trust each other at first but they need each other to reach the goals of each. Brain needs to reach a plane as to fly home, Daniel knows where one is. On the flip side Daniel who lost his wife the night earlier to a zombie attack is looking for his son who has gone missing. He believes his son left with some soldiers and needs Brain to help keep their vehicle running since he is an engineer. So they make their way across the country in hopes of both men getting what they want.

This is not really a horror movie per say as it is much more a survival film and a really good one at that. I have to give credit to writer/director Ford Brothers for going with the less is more type of thinking here. Of course budget may have dictated that but still. Like a lot of other reviews have stated this is wonderfully shot and the location helps with that a lot. But I have to say that the biggest strength is the lead performances from Rob Freeman as Brain and Prince David Oseia as Daniel. Not only do they both do a really good job here but their characters are also allowed to develop.

Also the DVD comes with some great behind the scenes making of stuff but my favorite is the commentary from the brothers. All that adds to the overall value of this film in my opinion since I am a sucker for good special features. This is one of the better zombie films to come out amongst all the others, I liked it at least. I do recommend the film to any zombie fan out there and well to any film fan, like I said this is more of a dramatic survival film more so than a horror film.",1351209600,3,2283,4.066666666666666

Incoming environment spoilers (won't give away the plot or character development lines-just the ""world"" the story takes place in).
Firstly this is a slow zombie movie. VERY slow zombie movie. The don't even walk as much shuffle. Even when they're right up on somebody (some of the zombie movies the zombies will lunge or quick step when dinner is close, not these guys!) I just find it hard to believe these can catch anyone with legs. Or even crutches, in this case. Also makes them very easy to kill. Walk up with a stick, pinata it's head.
They are, however, quiet. No moaning or bumping into stuff to give away their positions which can be bad with the crawlers. Very slow, ninja zombies.

2ndly, this movie takes place in the back bush of some African country...in a war zone...where nobody but the military has weapons, apparently. Also, the war must not have depopulated the bush much because zombies were EVERYWHERE. I mean the heroes would be out in BFE and 1 minute later 8 .01 mph moving zombies would shuffle into within 25 feet of the heroes. It was just silly.

As for pluses...
The interaction between the 2 main characters went over well. It WAS in the bush of Africa, which was different. Nothing special about the acting. Some of the gore effects were very well done, actually. Much better than I was expecting (hey, you have to comment on that aspect of a zombie movie!).

That about sums it up for me.",1349481600,,1664,4.592592592592593
4982565,4,B006BZ8O3I,"The Dead is the Ford Brothers foray into zombie films. Filmed in Africa in many respects it truly feels like the Romero film that should have been made right after Day of the Dead. It has the look and feel of a classic Romero zombie film without the `subtle' commentary on humanity that he likes to throw in. Sure the Ford Brothers do in a bit of social commentary into the film but not the singular in your face overall thought that follows through Romero's movies.

We follow the film through the eyes of Lt. Brian Murphy who is one of the only survivors of a plane crash of military or mercenaries that were abandoning Africa after the zombie outbreak occurred. We follow him as he tries to find another way off of the continent and quickly he stumbles across a military deserter, Daniel Dembele, who is trying to reach his son and wife. Daniel helps Brian's car out of a ditch that it's stuck in and in return is offered a ride for his help.

Daniel, having deserted his post is now on the run from both the local military and the hordes of the flesh eating undead that are scouring the planet. Also when hordes are mentioned in this film it's not an understatement. There are a ton of zombies in every single scene of the film aside from the introduction (which happens because of a zombie.) The zombies themselves are of the slow variety and clearly look to be from the area.

As we follow Brian and Daniel to look for a way out of the country and Daniel's family we are shown time and time again how Africa has been devastated by the undead. While groups of soldiers are still somewhat safe in a variety of locations throughout the movie nearly every village that these two enter are either empty or filled with the dead (walking or those who have taken a headshot.)

There are two huge points that I have to bring up. Quite a few of early reviews have seen these two points as either flaws or what make the film and it's really going to be a personal preference. The film can be very slow at parts and the film can be near silent on dialogue for a large portion of it.  Honestly if you are easily distracted you are most likely going to have issues with parts of the movie. In some parts it works as tension building in some it works as what people actually would have to do when surrounded by hordes of zombies - be quiet or be eaten.

If you can't stay hidden from hordes of the undead and there are too many to try to run from you need to avoid them and hide from them. This means you can't stick on your headlights in the middle of the country when you were just making a lot of noise turning yourself into a homing beacon to the flesh eaters who are chasing you. You can't have an introspective conversation about how lie is now compared to `normality' just a few days prior. You can't fall apart you just need to keep moving and this film embodies that perfectly.",1349049600,,2877,4.308687615526802

In Africa, there is literally no where to go, they are everywhere. If you're expecting blood and guts, this being a zombie movie, you will get it but it is not overly done.

Obviously the question only applies to people who have played Resident Evil 5...but seriously the African background, zombies attacking people in broad daylight I couldn't help but actually want to play a game I've been sick of for years after watching this movie.
As for the movie itself it was a throw back to the slow shuffling zombies, and well executed overall.
However it was not an action/horror/gory/sexual type movie and it was barely a character driven type of movie.
For the most part all I knew is this guy survives a plane crash and at some point hooks with an African dude (soldier) and they try to go somewhere presumably to escape the dark continent...Oh yeah and to find the soldier's son who ran off with a bunch of survivors.
It was not the most engaging movie I've ever seen but the change of scenery which I found effective coupled with the fact that the acting wasn't quite as terrible as I've seen in any number of zombie movies makes it a three star affair.

As a die hard zombie fan you could probably live without this as it is unfortunatley not all that distinctive(just the setting really) from other low budget zombie movies and you wouldn't be missing out on any gory kills as there were none.",1346284800,,1328,4.533333333333333

Sure it's low budget.  Sure the makeup is bad (I've only seen a handful of movies with good Zombie effects - I'm used to it).  Sure the acting isn't Grade A.  Someone said the plot is too simple... really?  It's survival... you can have far less of a plot and still be good, trust me.  What are you looking for?

Like I said, they don't make a lot of the common mistakes as found in many Zombie films.  Usually I find myself yelling at the survivor, ""Do this"" or ""Don't do that!"" and in this movie, 9 times out of 10, they do exactly what I was hoping :)

I will agree that the zombies are super slow, but that's part of what's great about it.  It illustrates that a movement so slow, can still have such a large impact.  The horde never sleeps.  That's the point.  I love the presentation of the survival choices the main characters have to make and to me, that's part of what makes a movie lovable.  Hence the 5 stars.

This film has been made down to a budget and that doesn't necessarily make it a bad film, however the attention to details does spoil what could have been a decent flick.  First off, the main hero, Brian Murphy, is supposed to be an engineering lieutenant, but with one of the flash back scenes, he is wearing a Captains uniform.  He starts off with a pistol that is not service issue, more suitable for Get Smart, however we see him with a different type of pistol throughout the film.  The dark/night scenes are extremely grainy making it difficult to make out detail.  And finally the acting is very ordinary, no emotion, no warmth, no anger only a flat wooden performance.

Undead tales litter the landscape. Few escape the trapping of clich and retracing over footprints long since cemented into the entertainment firmament. So finding one that offers a fresh glimpse and solid filmmaking is quite unusual.

'Dead' offers up a standard boilerplate plot, but made exceptional by use of a gritty documentary-like narrative. A sparse and strangely elegant movie with very little dialogue - and all the better for it. To be fair, co-lead Rob Freeman benefits from this as he doesn't quite have the thespian skill to completely envelop his role, but it's a minor knock. And thankfully, is balanced out by a more competent and complete performance by newcomer Prince David Oseia who plays Daniel.

Intense quiet-filled scenes magnify the loneliness and isolation - the utter despair and desperation as two soldiers from different sides of an unnamed conflict find themselves cutoff and on similar journeys, both searching for hope. One as he traverses the African veldt for the perceived safety of civilzation, the other as he searches for his only son.

A starkly intense tale of survival and begrudging friendship as the pair make their way through a hellish nightmare, where briefly stopping for anything but the absolute essentials is an invitation to being eaten alive, or worse.

Not a movie if you're looking for a popcorn night of constant chills and thrills as 'Dead' enters into the character study of films.

The African atmosphere makes for a desolate alien landscape for those of us that have never lived in Africa.  There are long moments of anxiety mixed with sudden and intense action.  The feeling of dread that develops is a realistic mixture of long, waterless miles intermixed with too short instances of rest; not enough rest, not enough water, not enough food.

I have to say that over the past few years, with the glut of zombie films, I have grown tired of them.  Most of them seemed all too similar and provided nothing new.  I was a bit skeptical with ""The Dead"" but, when I read that it was set in West Africa, I have to say I was intrigued.  ""The Dead"" opens with Africa in the midst of a zombie apocalypse and the continent is being evacuated.  The last plane heading out crashes just off the coast and leaves one American flight engineer as the lone survivor.  He swims back to shore but must find a way off the continent and back to America to reunite with his wife and child.  Meanwhile, an African army deserter returns home to find that his village has been destroyed by zombies with his wife dead and new that his only son had been rescued at the last moment and been taken north to a military compound.  He decides to go to that compound to find his son.  The two men eventually unite and decide to help one another out and fight their way north to safety.  The zombies are everywhere and ever present.  I found it fresh that the film is set in Africa because as the men travel through the bush they find a lot of nice zombie surprises waiting for them hidden in the foliage.  Gorehounds will love this film.  The film is very, very graphic and gory and there are some really cool zombie kills for people who love to see zombies smashed in interesting ways.  Its almost become a game to see how inventive and graphic films can be in the destruction of zombies.  Its also fresh that the main characters get along and cooperate with one another to achieve the same goal.  Most zombie movies have the main character fighting each other through out the entire movie.

4982586,5,B006BZ8O3I,"Who should like it: If Zombieland & Romero's last two zombie films left you feeling empty & disappointed, you should try this. People who like the traditional more logical slow braindead zombies. People getting tired of the old formula of a large group of character tropes getting picked off one by one.

Who should avoid it: People who hate art films, like fast smart zombies, or liked the above mentioned movies. People who enjoy melodrama & hate word-lite scripts. People who only like happy endings.

This movie takes a markedly different approach to the zombie apocalypse that some may find pretentious; firtly the movie switches the usual of having half a movie full of character development before finally giving you some action by throwing you straight into the chaos well before introducing the main characters, who never meet eachother.

The movie has a very strong sense of ""show & don't tell"" as there is very very little dialogue in this movie & it's excellent for suspense. The zombies are very quiet & there's lots of 8-9ft tall grasses & mud brick huts for them to hide in & jump out of whenever the heroes think they have a moment to rest. For a solid half hour, the first guy has no living person to communicate with, so why should he talk? The narrating in Diary of the Dead was beyond irritating & made me glad he wasn't talking to himself.

The acting is solid, the actors are refreshingly average looking, the characters have no forced token love interest. The zombies move the way you'd expect a decaying lethargic sack of meat to shamble, they persistantly follow their target without getting distracted, they actually occasionally finish their meals if no one's there to shoot them, rather than getting bored the minute the body stops moving & going on to the next victim...Well they do get distracted; they'll look up at any fresh meat that walks bye, but you never see them abandon their current plates.

The movie has you constantly looking & listening, as this movie uses jump scares quite effectively. Really, when the enemy is slow & quiet, it's the best way to make them show up when they aren't in large numbers, & the heroes can't rely on guns because of ammo shortage.

There are a few moments that take away from the realism; the fevered dream about a local witch doctor & the dream sequences with the family, but those are balanced by the very realistic moments when they bring up shortness of supplies; water, bullets, food, how long will their beat-up truck last, will they ever get any sleep? Yes, there's no unlimited ammo for a change.

The ending is a little vague; does the hero gave up his fight to survive, knowing that no matter where he ran to, there was no safe haven on earth? Or was it left that way intentionally for a sequel, meaning he shot his way out & escaped with the boy?",1340409600,2,2830,4.636726546906187

It isn't a thrill a minute nor terribly action packed but the story was interesting and the plight of the characters too.

The acting was good or better than most B movies. I see some other reviewers dinged the film on that issue. I don't have a high bar for acceptable acting I think. If the lines are not plastic and the cringe factor is low to non-existent then I can live with it.

Seriously, I've been watching them since 2001 and I've found maybe 5 good ones that were made from that date forward, and this one was not one of those 5.

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

Okay, I like my zombies, slow, shambling and dumb as a box of rocks, driven by an unquenchable hunger for human flesh.  But these zombies were slow, and I mean SLOW!  Remember when you were in high school and you and your buddies went to the go-kart track and everyone else was zipping around the track having a blast?  And you got stuck with the one cart that moved slower than a snail?  Well these zombies were even SLOWER than that!  Seriously!!!  You could just walk right past them at a normal pace and you'd be in no danger.  Okay, want real idea of how slow these guys were?  Stand up, move your left foot 6 inches forward, then 10 seconds later move your right foot 6 inches forward.  That's how slow they are!  The reason I think people like zombies so much is that they are the one movie monster that people think they stand a chance against if they really showed up.  But when you make them SOOOO slow and SOOOO non-threatening that it's laughable, they lose what makes them a threat to your safety.

On top of that, the main character doesn't even talk for like the first 10 minutes of the movie other than, ""Hey!"" and ""Wait!""  Then he meets up with another main character named Daniel, have a truck and drive around in it.  And that's like 75% of this movie, just these two driving around Africa in this truck during a zombie outbreak.  Look some movies can pull off just having two people just talking in a car for an extended period of time and have it be entertaining.  A good example of this is Pulp Fiction, or Clerks 2.

What's worse is that neither of the main characters is very interesting or has much of a back story other than, ""I want to find my family.""  They are just so bland they should just be listed in the credits as, ""The black guy,"" and ""The white guy.""  So it's kinda hard to get to like these guys cuz you're not really pulling for either of them to make it out alive.

At the end there's no real resolution.  The white guy finds Daniel's son and gives him his father's necklace and the movie ends as their fort is being over-run by zombies.  Okay so what caused the zombies?  Did the zombies get to other parts of the world?  Why were they so slow?

1. You like zombie movies and want to see one that does recapture some of the fear of the early voodoo style, slow but relentless zombies.

2. Want to see a truly low budget film that despite its many problems still barely holds together as a narrative film (albeit it with a weak ending)

While the fast zombies of movies like 28 days later and the 2004 Dawn of the Dead remake get the adrenaline pumping, it's the representation of an unending haunting swarm of irreconcilable flesh eaters that the Ford Bros. evoke here which taps into the pure zombie mythos of the Romero classics.

""The Dead"" is set in Africa, and was actually filmed in Burkina Faso and Ghana. Most of the film follows the relationship that forms between the protagonist, an American army mechanic, and an African soldier. Like other zombie films we accompany these characters in their scavenging for gas, ammo, food and hope - amid the chaos and growing tsunami of the undead horde. Unlike other zombie movies the landscape of west Africa plays a central part in the zombie apocalypse formula.

Not Ok movies, not tolerable movies but ones that are simply painful to sit through.  So when a movie like this comes along, it feels like such a relief.  I don't want to give anything away about the plot and, to be honest, beyond it being a road-trip movie there isn't much of one anyway.  Which is fine, it's about the characters and here the two primary ones as well as many of the supporting ones are quite good.  Perhaps more importantly, after so many Romero clones where every human being becomes a sociopathic and untrustworthy idiot within 5 minutes of the first zombie sighting it was actually surprising when people behaved differently here.  I will also say that there was a real sense of dread from quiet zombies I'd not thought about before.  Here, they were scary and unnerving.

My only complaint is the ending.  I won't give it away but I don't like unresolved endings and I don't like arbitrarily downbeat ones.  Without the last 5 minutes this was a 5 star zombie film.  Which is admittedly a sliding scale but there you go!

The zombies consist of over 250 villagers probably getting paid $1 per day to walk very slowly, about 6 inches per step, while having white contact lenses in their eyes. What's strange is that with so few people occupying the plains of Africa that the African zombies seemed to always be present despite our two travelers driving hundreds of miles; meanwhile not a single animal is to be seen. Camera crew must have scared them all away.  Even the insects were scared away.

The killing consists of unlimited ammo, as usual, and sticking a little red decal on a zombie to represent a gun shot.

After buying the Blu Ray last week I watched it last night along with a few friends. The general consensus was that this was one of the most boring Zombie flicks we have ever seen. The plot was pretty much non existent and it moved as slow as the zombies themselves. Which were slowest I think I have seen in any movies newer than the 70s.

4982600,1,B006BZ8O3I,"I remember when the Romero style zombie revival began in the late 1990s. People were looking at the brainless flesh starved walking corpses with new eyes and a bunch of original stories were being told. Now, a deade and a half later, every last drop of blood has been squeezed from this stone. Yet someone, the drek keeps coming. The Dead is just one of those films. Feeling far more inspired by Resident Evil 5 than any movie should, this African Zombie flick features some horribly wooden acting, and that comes from the people portaying live human beings and not the shambling corpses trying to eat them. That's never a good sign.

As well for a horror movie full of zombies, this is one of the slowest and dullest films in the genre I have ever seen. There is little in the way of actions or plot development, the ending is unsatisfactory at best, the cinematography makes the movie look like it was shot with a home camcorder and it was the first movie in a long time I had to force myself to finish. Look, I LOVE horror films. I even love bad horror films. I happily helped put money towards producing Thankskilling 2. But there's a difference between so bad it's good and just plain bad.

4982602,4,B006BZ8O3I,"<strong>The Dead</strong> (The Ford Brothers, 2010)

Full disclosure: this DVD was provided to me free of charge by Amazon Vine.

<em>The Dead</em> is a zombie movie, but it's not a zombie movie like much of anything you've seen before. Which is not to say that, like most zombie movies of the past few decades, it doesn't pay homage to at least half a dozen genre classics (the most obvious being <em>Zombi 2</em> and <em>I Walked with a Zombie</em>, but the Ford Brothers, who both wrote and directed, had some very interesting ideas about what to do with the material, and they did well with them.

Plot: the zombie plague has struck Africa, and needless to say, white flight is in full effect. (Yes, that's a conscious choice of words.) Brian Murphy (<em>Saving Private Ryan</em>'s Rob Freeman), a military engineer, is on the last flight out of the country--we're not told which one, though the movie was filmed on location in Burkina Faso--when an injured person dies. You know what's going to happen next, of course, and Murphy ends up back on shore looking for a way off the continent while avoiding zombies. He manages to get a car in good working order, at which point he attracts the attention of Daniel Dembele (Nollywood up-and-comer Prince David Oseia), also a military man, though on the run from his former compadres. Daniel is looking for his son, who escaped when their home village was overrun and may be at a military base in the north. There's an abandoned airbase on the way that may have an airplane Murphy can fix to fly out of there...

None of this is at all out of the ordinary, is it? Of course not. What makes <em>The Dead</em> different, among other things, is that the zombies feel more like background material, part of the landscape, here than in any other movie I can remember; rather than this being nonstop action, Murphy's usual tactic for getting away from a zombie is simply to step around it and continue on his way. When was the last time you saw <em>that</em> in a zombie movie? (Hint: if you ever have, it predates the Romero Revolution that happened in 1968.) And yet despite this, there are still some solid action scenes and a few places where the directors popped in the usual jump factor (there's a fantastic one when Murphy is trying to sleep in a tree and fumbles his rifle...).

Given only a few scenes that really make this a ""horror"" film in the traditional sense and zombies indistinguishable from the greenery, what you're left with is a road movie, pretty much, and when you're dealing with a road movie, the movie lives or dies based on the characters who are travelling across the country. Freeman has a wealth of experience, having been in the biz for twenty years. Oseia is a relative newcomer, having made his first film in 2009 and, if you discount sequels (it has been my experience that Nollywood films duos, trilogies, and quartets in one shot and releases them as ""Go See My Movie!"" and ""Go See My Movie 2!"" and... six months or so apart in order to maximize profits), <em>The Dead</em> is his fifth feature. Oseia, however, holds his own with Freeman, bringing an ease to the role that seems so natural that for a while after we first met his character, I thought Ford and Ford were going for some sort of weird <em>cinema verit&eacute;</em> zombie-road-movie gig. It is only later, when we start meeting other bands of survivors, that Oseia's strengths become more evident, and they are good indeed.

Not to say the movie is perfect. And I swear to you that when I started writing this review, I had three criticisms I was going to point out, but as I've typed the last few paragraphs, they have fled from my mind. The cinematography is fantastic, the soundtrack made me immediately go out and look for more music from the guy who did it (I have as yet been unsuccessful in tracking any down), and the script is so smart overall that I am willing to forgive the movie its occasional descents into utter cheesiness. (I apologize in advance for the final scene if my review tips you over the edge into buying the film, but the rest is more than worth it.) The Ford Brothers' direction, as well, deserves special mention; I was mildly surprised at how well-composed the opening shot seemed, if it was perhaps a little slow and a lot manipulative (it's one of those ""we pulled this from the end of the film in order to create a totally unnecessary sense of mystery"" shots). And then came the second shot, which is one of the movie's most telling homages to <em>Zombi 2</em>, and again, I was surprised by it; there was a great eye for detail overseeing that shot, and again, it's fantastically composed, especially considering the chaos to be found there. And then there's the fourth or fifth shot, after the plane has crashed and Murphy is on the beach with a dying compatriot trying to figure out how to get into a crate of supplies that will help him fend off the out-of-focus zombies who are shuffling onto the beach. And by that time I was no longer surprised at how bloody good everything looked. Thankfully, while that sense of composition does slip now and again (has anyone made a road movie with that much thought involved since <em>Two-Lane Blacktop</em>?), it never happens for long.

In other words: this is really, really good stuff. It is neither hardcore zombie action nor weepy drama, but inhabits a solid middleground that should appeal to more moderate fans of both; definitely worth your time. *** ",1335484800,4,5482,4.6559917355371905

4982604,3,B006BZ8O3I,"THE DEAD is an earnest but drab zombie movie with a LOT of wasted potential in its characters and the dirt-poor African wasteland they're placed in. The tale throws together a white American air force engineer and an African military sergeant to muddle through the aftermath of a largely-unexplained zombie apocalype (do filmmakers even bother explaining them anyore?). THE DEFIANT ONES this ain't, but imagine if writers-directors Howard and Jon Ford had turned to it for even base inspiration. As THE DEAD stands (or shuffles), there's virtually no tension, as every new plot wrinkle (""Water for the radiator, or water for us?"", ""Why are you in our territory?"", ""I can't take your baby, ma'am!"") is resolved within seconds (""Hey look, a well!"", ""We're all friends now!"", ""Thank goodness, a passing truck filled with survivors to take this baby!"").

In their commentary, the filmmakers state their intention wasn't to parachute into Africa like western journalists pointing out all the poor starving people, but the harrowing production stories they tell, most of them involving the poor people recruited as extras and production personnel, are precisely what would've made their film more realistic and compelling: small donations of cash inciting mobs; locals sabotaging vehicles to squeeze the crew for the cost of repairs; money for extras--often more than they earned at their hardscrabble day jobs--going missing with local ""facilitators""; the orphanage used for the closing sequence (in which it doesn't actually play an orphanage) being kept perpetually dishevelled in so prospective adoptive parents would continue to make big donations. Even trace amounts of that material worked into the screenplay would've separated this from the countless zombie movies that have gone direct to video in the past decade, but the filmmakers let their misguided morality stand in their way.

The disc also includes a modestly interesting, five minute making-of piece, which confirms the likelihood of some of the tales told in the commentary while providing the usual exploration of low-budget shooting techniques, and a single deleted scene that offers hints as to the origin of the outbreak, but at a length that would've slowed the film's already slow pace had it been included.",1334793600,,2277,5.33983286908078

4982606,1,B006BZ8O3I,"We all know that zombie flixs can be good but often are not. The Dead brings the zombie film to a new low. I know it was made on a low budget but that is no excuse. The acting is as dry as the desert that much of the movie takes place in, and the story is so flat and uninteresting that it could have been written by one of undead characters in the movie. The only thing slower and less scary than the plot are the zombies themselves. They are so slow that the only time they seem to be able to catch someone is when a main character is sleeping out in the open savanna with a roaring fire going to let them know where he is. Wich brings me to my biggest issue with this film, the fact that the zombies are so slow the director has to come up with lame ways for them to kill anyone. There is never a sense of urgency so the actors are stuck saying things like ""We have to get out of here now!"" when there isn't a zombie within 50 yards. Its like you can hear the director shout ""Hey not so fast guys......Wait for the zombies"". Seriously Steven Hawking could get away from these zombies and still have time to change his depend under garment. On top of all that the story drags on with tons of useless dialog, and goes in no real direction taking characters you don't care about into forced situations. This movie is dull dull dull.

But I slowly realized that I didn't care at all about the stock characters, and that, although there was some good old-school gore, the majority of the effects budget was spent on colored contact lenses.  The movie gets very, very repetitive: guys drive through the desert, slow down for some reason, zombies wander in and are killed with boring shots to the head, guys drive away through the desert, repeat, repeat, repeat.

This could have been a decent movie, but it is hamstrung by a low budget, phoned-in performances, and zombies which differ only in how much fake blood was applied by the person doing makeup.",1334361600,2,753,4.639097744360902
4982620,2,B006BZ8O3I,"I like zombie movies, anime, shows, and games but I have to give this a maximum of 2 stars for a number of reasons.

1.)  The main character is a very poor actor and I can see why he remains in low budget films.  He must be a friend of the director or producer to land any acting role.

2.)  The main character is an engineer who happens to be a plane mechanic, electrical engineer, and car mechanic, even though anyone that knows about cars would not open up the radiator when the car overheats.

3.)  It pertains to things that would not happen.  The car overheats and they take the radiator cap off and it cools down in no time.  No spraying, which would always happen. Falling down from heat exhaustion, about to die, but has the strength to walk another mile and kill a load of zombies.  It's like WWE, where the wrestler comes back after being beaten to a pulp.  There are many other unbelievable things that happen too but I'm trying to keep the review shorter.

4.)  There is almost no story line and absolutely no character development.

5.)  Really, there is only one zombie, you have a parang, and you have to shoot them, each and every time?  That's zombie 101!  You only use a gun whenever absolutely necessary because it draws other zombies.

The only shining moment in the film is the character Daniel.  He is a very good actor and made a poor written character into one that you actually pull for.  I wish the main character would have just been eaten and Daniel was the main character.",1334361600,,1502,4.392727272727273

I watch quite a few zombie movies and most of them (as of late, with the exception of some wonderful foreign movies) have been poorly done. I'm all for zombie mythos but I also respect a movie or book when it steps outside the boundaries.

But have no fear. We have a movie set in Africa with traditional zombies, that is, the zombies do the slow walk, not the fast sprint. There is plenty of running and gunning and the characters don't have 500 bullets. The acting was decent, and the script was pretty good. Some of the dialog was laughable but I take that in stride. We are talking an indie zombie movie here, it's not like Soderburg wrote it. But don't take that as a negative. I think the writers did a good job, certainly better than I could ever do with a script.

All in all this is a solid zombie movie with the unique setting of Africa. I liked that they brought in actors with real disabilities to portray the actors. The first zombie in the movie has a genuine hip problem and that scene will freaking haunt you!

So go forth and get your zombie movie fix from what was a pretty dry Z-movie year in 2011.

Its pretty easy to shoot them, chop their head off, or just smash their brains out.  So you have a fighting chance.

4982639,5,B006BZ8O3I,"I watched this ""cold"", and had no idea if it was any good.  It was WAY better than I expected or could have hoped.  What some others saw as defects, I saw as strengths.  For a low-budget, independent film it just has no right to be this good.  I had never heard of the Ford brothers but they did a masterful job.  One did the script and directing, the other handled the photography, and it was all well-done.
I saw some complaints that the zombies should have had more lavish special effects.  The zombies were just fine by me.  The strength of this movie is not in the latest-greatest special effects; it's in simply telling a gripping story, which it did.
The movie begins with a long-distance shot of a man dressed in black robes, carrying an automatic rifle, walking in the desert.  Slowly it pans in closer and we see that although the attire looks native, the man is white.  After this brief opening sequence, the film then shifts back to ""the beginning""--which in this script is the last air evacuation of foreigners out of an airfield somewhere near what is thought to be the epicenter of this mysterious ""zombie"" outbreak.  Almost all the filming was done in Burkina Faso and Ghana, so the first difference from other ""zombie"" films is simply the locale.  What African country it is supposed to represent is never specified and does not matter.  [Because the first character that you see is Rob Freeman playing ""Lieutenant Brian Murphy"", there is just a little bit of film done in the U.K. representing his memories of home].  So one might say, just as mankind originated somewhere in Africa, in this story it looks like things come full-circle and the possible extinction of mankind starts there, too.  Anyhow this desperate last flight out (which vaguely reminds me of the frantic scenes of the last American troops pulling out of Saigon, at the end of the Vietnam War) does not go well; it crashes.  Murphy (a mechanic), surviving the crash, continues on foot headed north, toward a military base on the southern border of the Sahara, which also has an airstrip and where he hopes to find another flight out of the country back home.  Along the way he runs into Sergeant Daniel Dembele (played by Prince David Osei) of the local troops, who is supposed to be keeping the roads open and assisting evacuation of the living along with the other soldiers, but is desperately seeking his young son.  Dembele figures if his boy is alive he must also be headed north, so the two join together in an effort to travel some 200 miles through zombie-infested land to reach the military base.  As the story unfolds, it comes up to the scene of the opening sequence, and continues moving forward to the ending, with no further cutting backwards or forwards in time to confuse things.
The pacing is basically steady throughout, neither bogging down in excessively long ""relationship"" material nor hyperkinetic action sequences.  These are your classic, slow-moving zombies, so tension arises just by the sheer numbers of them, and whether they will catch our protagonists unaware, like in the dark at night, inside buildings when they have to search for food, when they have to sleep, and so on.  The tension and the scares thus are classic, but still effective.
Exactly what started this zombie-pocalypse is never really explained (just as the locale is never really identified) though in some scenes the characters speculate as to cause and meaning.  The impact of this movie is greatly enhanced not only by the beautiful African scenery but also a haunting, original soundtrack by Imran Ahmed.
By the way the ending clearly leaves room for a sequel and I would really love to see one, if it can match the quality of this original film.  The DVD or blu-ray is enhanced by a fairly short but fascinating ""making of"", only one or 2 deleted scenes (if that's all there was, it was very parsimoniously filmed!) and then you can listen to a commentary if you're a real film junkie.  I loved the short ""making of' bonus feature.  This movie just about transcends its genre in several ways; I highly recommend it.

If only the filmmakers had put as much care into the story as they did the camerawork, editing, and sound effects/score.  The opening shot is definitely postcard worthy.
I have to say there is a lot to admire about this film: the economy of dialog is its greatest asset, if only they had stuck with it.  Unfortunately, they had several characters lapse into political and sociological outbursts that made little sense (considering the more pressing concern of not being eaten).  It also didn't help that the two leading actors gave leaden performances the minute they were required to speak.  It's difficult to feel anything for a couple of automatons (especially when their plight was treated as nothing short of futile.  An overwhelming sense of doom is not something you want to drag around for 105 minutes; it leaves you with a plot that has nowhere to go).
But, I did love the visual style, the use of confinement even in a place as spacious as Africa.  The way they managed to keep a zombie or two in frame, even if only seen within the negative space of carefully cropped scenes, was brilliant.  Their use of shadows was also inspired.
As I watched this movie, I kept thinking how great this could have been if only they had left well enough alone.  That, and hired more commanding actors.  A little charisma goes a long way.

4982648,3,B006BZ8O3I,"Zombie invasion.  Grim future.  Fight for survival. Etc.

Ok, now that you're caught up on the plot, let's cover what makes 'The Dead' different than all the other zombie films out there.  It's set in the wilds of Africa.  So we're talking a lot of long stretches of dirt and plains, with small villages spotting the landscape.  That said, there are zombies EVERYWHERE.  Rarely is a scene not filled with at least a few zombies lumbering around in the background.  Luckily, the zombies also walk pretty slow.  They are still a constant threat, just due to their sheer numbers.  The film has us rooting for a pair of soldiers, one white, one black, both from different armies and backgrounds on their journey to find their loved ones and survive another day.

'The Dead' strives to be a different kind of zombie film, and in that it succeeds.  There is little dialog, little violence (but when they do take down a zombie, the gore is top notch), no profanity, and survival against the elements is as much a part of the looming threat as the zombies are.  Fuel is sparse, as are working vehicles and weapons.  The acting from the leads is a little hamfisted, but gets their plight across to the viewer.  If you've ever seen a low budget, Christian film, then you know what to expect.  I've seen a lot of small, Christian films, and 'The Dead' fits right in.  No budget, rookie actors, a reverence for spirituality, etc.

'The Dead' is a unique experience for fans of the horror genre just in it's setting, and the well-crafted gore is a draw, but I found it hard to watch without constantly rolling my eyes over the obvious, predictable scenarios.",1332288000,2,1645,4.613793103448276
4982659,4,B006BZ8O3I,"We must love zombies - the only thing harder to kill than a zombie horde is the neverending wave of zombie movies (""Dawn of the Dead,"" ""28 Days Later,"" etc.), TV shows (""The Walking Dead"") and books (""World War Z"").

Howard and Jonathan Ford (co-writers and co-directors) return to the basics of the zombie story but tweak it by setting ""The Dead"" in sub-Saharan Africa.  Next to no time is spent on exposition - all we know is that the dead have risen and are hungry.  Unlike so many recent movies that have given zombies speed and even a hint of a soul, the zombies of ""The Dead"" are a shambling, implacable lot.  You can outrun a zombie simply by walking quickly, but eventually you're going to need to sleep . . . and they never will.

The cast is as lean and mean as can be.  Lt. Brian Murphy (Rob Freeman) is an engineer with the American military.  He survives a nightmarish plane ride that fails to make it to safety and is left to fend for himself.  His family may be alive somewhere, but he's miles from anywhere and on foot.  Sgt. Daniel Dembele (Prince David Oseia) is with the local military and must get north to find his son after zombies wipe out his village.  Eventually these two team up, but if you're looking for a Mel Gibson/Danny Glover buddy pic, ""The Dead"" is far to grim (and realistic, if that can be said for a zombie movie) for such nonsense.

Indeed, ""The Dead"" may be fairly described as a thinking man's zombie movie.  Murphy and Dembele are smart, courageous men, always trying to stay one step ahead of their hungry foes.  Unfortunately, they are confronted with a maddening reality - sub-Saharan Africa isn't exactly rife with the supplies needed to survive a zombie infestation, and those zombies prove to be maddeningly focused on eating them.

""The Dead"" has plenty of legitimate scares and creepy scenes (suffice it to say that we get plenty of opportunities to see the zombies feasting).  The zombies' slowness actually makes them more creepy - it's downright scary to see our heroes stop in the middle of the screen with a couple of zombies in the fuzzy background, eternally marching after them.  After all, there is only one thing on the zombie's mind - eating you.

4982664,4,B006BZ8O3I,"As a long-time fan of the zombie genre, I realize that this little valley in the landscape of horror presents an interesting assortment of gems and land mines. Among some examples of schlock (some of which are still worth viewing), we occasionally find those with a new vision, or at least a new perspective on the tried-and-true themes of undead days gone by. ""The Dead"" is a good example of the latter. There's really nothing new here, other than the transition from the often claustrophobic urban settings to open African vistas. But what the film does is to effectively capture the essence of the ""traditional"" zombie apocalypse and distill it into a good story with the kind of pacing and the overall sense of dread and inevitability we know and love.

This is not a world populated by zombie action figures that can scale walls, punch through windshields, and shoot forked tongues out to deal with their victims. Don't get me wrong...I'm also a fan of those. I really enjoy monsters in the vein of Zack Synder's Dawn of the Dead, 28 Days Later, and the Resident Evil variety. It seems to me that the world would fall apart a lot faster when faced with the frenetic and relentless attacks of zombies (or the infected) capable of running down and flipping over cars to get at the smorgasbords inside.

But with that said...there's something truly creepy about the silent dead sneaking up on you while you're trying to repair a car or reload your weapon. You may not even realize they're in the vicinity until they've delivered a nasty bite to your throat. Don't even think of sleeping out in the open without someone on guard duty...or at least a foolproof early warning system in place (as Brian and Daniel do in a pivotal scene), or you may wake up dead. This is what makes the languorous zombies so dangerous in the long run...they don't require speed and strength to get you. They need only a brief lapse in your vigilance and it's all over.

That brings me to an observation about this film: the zombies are almost everywhere! The guys stop their car in the middle of nowhere for a few minutes and the dead are on them almost immediately. They roll up to a well to get a drink and a breather...nope, sorry...shamblers are there to disturb the peace. Brian falls asleep and runs the car into a tree and boom...a horde is already there waiting for them. I guess it just seemed to me that with all the square miles of savanna they were traveling through, there would be some place along the way relatively untouched by man and zombie. But while it struck me as odd, it did help to keep the tension going. Through it all, there is this pervasive sense that there really is no escape. Everywhere you go...there they are.

This works into the culmination of the movie (spoiler follows). As the journey ends and Brian arrives at the rumored secure base, he finds it surrounded by the dead. So with the notion of safe haven trashed, he reaches out across the radio waves seeking help...only to learn from a military friend that the apocalypse has ignored international boundaries and it's pretty much the end of the world as we knew it. That underlying sense of being hemmed in on all sides by the dead settles in and when the walls of the base are breached by the horde, the expression on Brian's face is a curious mix of ""damn..."" and ""it figures..."" You can give it your all. You can run, hide, and fight your way across Hell...but sometimes the monsters win.",1331769600,4,3463,4.580645161290323
4982665,4,B006BZ8O3I,"Somewhere, a scholar has been doing a study of zombie speeds, a study I was peripherally aware of.

On this scale, 1 represents the slowest zombies, like those in Romero's 1968 masterpiece. I mention this because ""The Dead"" owes a lot to Romero's early films, including zombies that move at a speed of 1 Romero.

Set and shot in Africa, ""The Dead"" begins when an evacuation flight crashes. One survivor must make his way across a zombie-laden landscape to safety (if there is any). Like Romero's films, ""The Dead"" has an abundance of social commentary, but I'm not clear that this commentary is intentional or simply a byproduct of a well-made film that takes its subject seriously.

I suppose if ""The Dead"" must be classified, it falls into the horror genre, but this is not an especially gory film (though there is a fair amount of that) or a particularly frightening film.

4982667,4,B006BZ8O3I,"I watched ""The Dead"" a couple weeks ago and have been thinking about it ever since.

A few points: This is a low-budget zombie movie; There are no stars in it--you won't be seeing Brad Pitt (like he'd ever do a zombie movie); It takes place in Africa; You don't get an explanation for the zombie outbreak.

I really enjoyed the way this film told its story. It's not a fast-paced beast. Rather there are scenes of solitude, of the main character, an American military engineer named Brian, trying to reach someplace safe after he survived a plane crash. He doesn't talk to himself; he lets his expressions and actions tell his story. I think some people will be put off by this. If you didn't like that part in ""Cast Away"" when Tom Hanks was on the island, you probably won't like this movie either.

Eventually he crosses paths with an African solider named Daniel (I think this story is supposed to take place in Sierra Leone). The two form an uneasy partnership and decide to travel to a refuge together. Daniel's not much of a talker either, so there are no one-liners you can quote with your buddies.

I know, it sounds boring, right? But that's because I haven't told you about all the zombies yet. Dude, they're everywhere! I had a sense of unease throughout the whole movie. Encroaching zombies stumbled into almost every scene. Brian couldn't catch his breath before a zombie shuffled into frame with him. Sometimes they appeared from mist or were camouflaged by foliage until it was almost too late. They sometimes crept in from the edges of the camera's eye and remained there, an excellent touch.

I said earlier this is a low-budget movie, but it really doesn't look like it. The camera work is professional; there are interesting visuals and beautiful scenery. The (living) actors all do a good job, especially the two lead actors playing Brian and Daniel. These guys emote; you experience the tension, confusion and fear they feel. And there are plenty of awesome headshots and decent f/x to go along with them.

Bonus DVD features include a directors' commentary, a 5-minute making of featurette and a single 2-minute deleted scene.

I really enjoyed this movie as something a bit different, more thoughtful than a lot of other zombie movies. It works on other levels, too. What drives someone to survive in the face of overwhelming obstacles? Brian finds his answer, finally, at the end of the film.

I highly recommend ""The Dead"" for zombie fans. I also think it would be a good primer for indoctrinating those new to zombie movies because it encapsulates pretty much everything a zombie movie should have, from underlying social commentary to flesh eating.

My jaw hit the floor over a dozen times watching The Dead. It isn't a zombie movie that gets all up in your face and demands you know everything right from the beginning and then just watch them kill zombies in an attempt to survive, but rather it falls into the same kind of movie as Seraphim Falls (for example). It drops you right into the situation present, and it slowly progresses the character development and situations without pushing anything prematurely. It isn't over the top with musical scores and sound effects of zombies, rather it lets the silence speak for itself.

Now with THE WALKING DEAD a fan and critical success on television it has reached maybe its highest state of quality and popularity.  THE DEAD is a low budget film and one would expect it to probably be just another gory film getting by on the success of the genre.  Well this could not be farther from the truth.  Not only is it a huge success far surpassing the quality of most low budget horror films but it is also a superb and worthy addition to the genre.  Yes, this movie has gore and can get pretty difficult to watch at times but the violence has a purpose here.  As with THE WALKING DEAD there is a story here and the film also has some strong messages.  As with all good films the messages are many such as survival of man, what is life etc.

The film begins with a plane crash and there is one survivor, a military engineer.  We follow him as he must proceed on foot while fighting off the dead that are always present, walking and roaming wanting to eat human flesh and blood.  The story takes place in Africa and eventually he meets up with an African soldier who has gone awol from the army to try and find his son.  This film does something very difficult.  We are never really told how the people started turning into zombies but are shown that the issue is running rampant.  The film has much heart and soul.  Our two main characters are struggling to survive and we  see them slowly learn to trust and care for each other.  Other than the zombies these two main characters carry the movie and their story is spellbinding and heartwrenching.  To give details of the plot further would ruin it for the viewer.

4982700,4,B006BZ8O3I,"Zombies abound these days but rarely are writers able to tap into their poignant potential the way we see them portrayed in ""The Dead""---a powerfully moving film.  It's all too easy to view the undead as cannon fodder, jokes, or pathetic.  The effort to speed up the zombies in recent years has been to put teeth back into them, but in amping up the threat the emotional impact was noticeably diminished.

The thing about zombies is they are us.  They are not willing mass murderers; they are people just like us who have often been murdered in horrible ways by the creatures they now become.  That gives them a resonance other movie monsters lack.

""The Dead"" manages to fully convey this epic sadness while taking the genre to new and alien places.  It is set in Africa, where a Navy pilot who took part in a regional war is being evacuated just after the zombie apocalypse breaks out.  Trapped in a hostile land where he doesn't even speak the language, he is forced to survive, hoping against hope he can somehow return to his base and his family.

It is a bleak and haunting picture with as realistic a take on the zombie genre as we're likely to see.  It was shot on location in Africa and the illness the actors suffered filming greatly enhances their performances.

Easily the best zombie movie in recent years and well worth your time.  The only reason it's not topping out my grade is that the low budget limits the story and the impact of it.  That said, the money's all on the screen and the effects are top-notch.",1331596800,,1526,4.505454545454546

Don't get me wrong, I loved it, I just had a hard time watching all the films and getting through it. I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone who likes zombie movies, it is a break from the regular movies and it is the first where I've actually seen the zombies chew the flesh they bite off their victims.",1331596800,,478,4.150537634408602

Boy oh boy will you find little wrong with The Dead!  And quite honestly, there really isn't anything wrong with the film, it just does everything we've come to expect from the genre-- except with Africa as the backdrop.  Quick summary; American military engineer is stationed in Africa when the zombie outbreak occurs, teams with local man in hopes of returning to their respective loved ones.  The acting is solid(something about the lead annoys but...), the gore is good though not omnipresent, but the real winner is the aforementioned African backdrop.  Beautiful shots of endless rolling grasslands and other geographical wonders too rarely seen(especially in a zombie flick) speckled with numerous wandering dead-- very cool!  So there you have it, if you've got room for more zombie shenanigans in your life than I absolutely would recommend giving The Dead(way to get creative with that title fella's) a try(most others could stand to shamble away slowly).",1331510400,4,1159,5.204301075268817

This small indie film shot in Africa, on a very small budget has rolled on into a hit. That's good because while the film makers were in production, they were robbed several times , at gun point and at knife point. The lead actor Rob got Malaria... it was definitely a labor of love. What makes the film an instant classic is not the classic zombies of inventive kills, it's the deeper question raised, does it have to take an alien invasion to bring the different tribes here on earth together>.

The zombie story is there, the survival tale is there, but the sheer beauty of the land and the story of an unlikely friendship caught my imagination.  This is not a slash and gash zombie movie, it is a moving tale of survival and hope.",1331424000,3,493,4.268817204301075
4982705,3,B006BZ8O3I,"There is MUCH to admire about THE DEAD. Howard & Jonathan Ford, the brothers who wrote and directed the movie, took what is obviously a limited budget and still managed to give the film an expansive feel.  The scenery is lovely and appropriately bleak.  There are plenty of decent zombie kills and a couple of gory zombie attacks.

But it's a film with 75 minutes of story stretched too tight over a 105 minutes.  It's frequently repetitive.  And the acting is, at best, adequate.

THE DEAD tells the story of the zombie apocalypse as it has occured in very poor, rural African nation near the coast.  American mercenary/engineer Brian Murphy (Rob Freeman) is trying to escape on an overpacked airplane, but it crashes near the coast line, and a couple of zombie attacks later, he is the only survivor.  He begins to work his way north, where there is rumored to be a military station which offers some security.  He is soon joined on his journey by African soldier Daniel Dembele (Prince David Oseia), who has deserted his troupe in order to find his son after the boy's mother has been killed.  The two are an uneasy, wary pair.  They have motivations that force them to work together, but they never grow comfortable with each other.  They approach things differently.  This is not a ""buddy movie""...thank goodness.  The two men, in a VERY rickety pickup, with almost no food or water or ammo, must pick their way across a minefield.  Only this minefield is populated with flesh-eating zombies not metallic landmines.  The African landscape looks lovely and adds a lot to the movie...if nothing else, the location of this zombie movie is unique.  But the scenes of travel, sprinkled with brief zombie encounters, grow tiresome.

And of course, the important question is:  how are the zombies?  They are pretty good.  These are of the slow moving variety, but they are also VERY quiet.  No groaning.  They emerge slowly but suddenly from the tall bushes.  And when they corner someone, they literally fall upon them with mouths wide open.  Ready to bite immediately.  The movie has an appropriate level of gore, but never to the point of being laughable.  The movie also lacks, unfortunately, any truly memorable zombie kill scenes.  Most great zombie movies have at least one or two gruesome moments, either of a zombie killing someone or being killed.  And many also have that great scene where large groups of humans are overrun by an even larger group of zombies (such as the zombies finally breaking into the mall in DAWN OF THE DEAD).  I think the budget of THE DEAD prevented this.

This could be forgive, but the scenes with NO zombies, featuring just humans, are generally fairly flatly performed.  We get lots of scenes of Freeman standing and staring at his surroundings.  Many scenes are shot in slow motion.  Effective when sparingly used, in THE DEAD, they are pace-killing.  Freeman and Oseia are the clearest sign that THE DEAD is very low budget.  It is just too hard not to be aware of how average they are.  If, by some wild chance, THE DEAD had two more dynamic stars...I think the length would have been more tolerable and the emotional impact greater.

But, it's still a decent zombie movie...and if you like zombie movies, that's often good enough.  3 stars.",1331424000,3,3283,4.763765541740675
4982706,4,B006BZ8O3I,"Don't get me wrong, I think the 'Walking Dead' serial and the 'The Living Dead' series are just as adult as this, in their own way, but there have been a lot of childish, teen gore-fests of late in this genre.  If you like your undead mixed with teen screamers and jocular gore every five minutes, give this a miss.

Trawling this site for zombie movies, I came across 'Zombie', by some Italian film-maker (Lucio something?)that everyone seems to revere, set in Africa and loaded with gory set-pieces and hysteria, along with an almost carnival-like over-the-top atmosphere. I moved swiftly along. 'The Dead' could almost exist as a counter-point to it.

If you would like a measured story of two real adult men facing the odds in a country over-run by the undead, then you will love this.  The acting is impeccable and the storyline sensible and exciting.  The sparse African setting means we don't have to be concerned with extraneous characters struggling to add to the story.

It's not perhaps loaded with huge scares, to be honest, but has enough of them to recommend it.  By now, you should know whether this is something for you, so I'll leave it there.  Except to say that this is a very bleak tale.",1331424000,,1207,4.660377358490566

4982708,4,B006BZ8O3I,"This is a very minimalist, visceral film.  During the movie, long stretches go by with very little, if any, dialogue.  It put me in mind of the movie The Black Stallion (odd reference, I know, but work with me), when Alec and the horse are stranded on the island.  All you hear, as Alec begins to interact with the Arabian, are the sounds of nature--the crashing waves, the rain, the susurration of the leaves--and the non-vocal utterances of both boy and animal.  The same is true of The Dead in many instances.  During those non-dialogue periods, all we hear are the reactions of the actors--heaving breathing, gasps of fear--and the surroundings through which they're traveling.  That sort of ambient silence gives the movie an added dimension of fear and suspense to the zombie action.

Speaking of the action, the SFX team on this film are top notch.  The effects are quite gruesome and amazingly well-done, engendering reactions of ""Oh my god, how gross!"" and ""Wow, how did they do that?""  The very first shots of the movie present us with a zombie with a broken leg and, believe me, it looks so real (and the sound effects do a great job with enhancing the realism), you wonder if maybe they used an actor with a real broken leg--except if that had been a real injury, the man would've been screaming in agony.

For all the action that does occur and for all that the movie starts off with a zombie-killing sequence, this is actually a slow-burner of a film.  It's more concerned with the motivations of its two protagonists than it is with shoot-'em-up action.  The story develops at its own pace, allowing the characters to deepen their back-story and to interact with their surroundings and the people they meet on what is essentially a road trip, a quest, through the African landscape.  It takes a while to gather all the details of the movie--for instance, how far has the zombie outbreak spread?--and some details are never shared, as in what caused the outbreak.  Information is dribbled throughout like breadcrumbs, allowing us to avoid info dumps but also keeping us continually on our toes as we watch and wait for the next crumb of knowledge.

While there are a few (very few) ""D'oh!"" moments in the script (see * below for examples), this is an intelligently written film.  In it, we are taken back to the cradle of zombies and as such there's a sense of familiarity to the movie; we can see reflections of those zombie movies of old, featuring blank-eyed victims of voodoo and sympathetic magic, in the zombies of The Dead, a sort of homage to those films that went before.  Yet The Dead is at the same time something completely new, a fresh look at the zombie phenomenon, and the directors use the landscapes of Burkina Faso and Ghana as well as the Sahara to emphasize the scope of the film and its sense of isolation.  While I don't see it becoming a classic, it is definitely a unique and smart addition to the zombie movie canon.

*For instance, the military engineer, Lt. Brian Murphy, comes across another military man, someone who was with Brian in an evacuation flight which crashed off the coast and who left Brian for dead when zombies came after the few survivors washed up on the shore.  This man has been zombified, so like a good zombie, he tries to attack Brian.  The lieutenant simply runs him down with his car.  However, when Brian gets out to look at his former companion, instead of taking the man's military belt pack, which has at least another weapon that we can see and most likely extra ammo as well as other supplies, Brian only takes the man's water bottle.  Dumb, dumb, dumb.  In another example, Brian and the other protagonist, Sgt. Daniel Dembele, decide to go to sleep beside the fire in their rough camp, having driven until exhaustion the day and night before.  That's fine.  However, neither one of them sit up to guard the other while he sleeps!  Brian had set up a rudimentary alarm around the perimeter, involving twine and empty cans, and apparently figured that would be enough to protect them.  Really?  Zombies are all around you, they never stop, and more of them appear every day, and both of you go to sleep, innocent and relaxed as babies?  Come on!  The only explanation I can think of for such stupidity is that is sets the scene for the following dramatic moment.",1331337600,,4334,4.64089121887287
4982718,4,B006BZ8O3I,"Movie: 3 stars\Extras: 4 stars

I'm a big fan of the zombie genre, regardless of whether the undead are the traditional shambling variety or the more recent sprinting ghoul.  So far, most zombie flicks have been set in the urbanized West, with plenty of food, water, shelter, and guns (or at least rugby bats) available for the survivors' health and comfort.  Now comes ""The Dead"", set in the beautiful wilds of Africa that are as great a threat to the remaining humans as the living dead.

THE MOVIE (possible minor spoilers):
American military officer Brian Murphy (Rob Freeman) is on the last evacuation flight out of zombie-overrun West Africa.  However, his transport plane crashes off the coast and leaves him stranded, alone and without supplies in the midst of a disintegrating continent.  He soon runs into the dignified and competent African Sergeant Daniel Dembele (Prince David Osei), and they join forces to survive and find their respective families.

We follow the two men as they learn to trust each other while attempting to cross a drought-stricken region in order to reach a distant military base where Sgt. Dembele's young son might be waiting.  As for Lt. Murphy, he's hoping to reunite with his wife and daughter back in the States - if the zombie outbreak hasn't already claimed them.  Both must work together in order to fend off relentless zombie assaults and gain enough precious resources to survive the harsh African environment.

I enjoyed the bare-bones 1970's-style story and the amazing scenery (the film was shot on location).  The actors give serviceable performances (especially Mr. Osei), made more impressive and realistic due to constant real-life illness and the oppressive climate.  However, certain scenes don't quite ring true, such as the too-neat resolution of the baby plotline and the final radio communication with civilization.  But the Ford Brothers acknowledge these issues and provide a reasonable explanation for them in their excellent commentary.

THE FEATURES:
The DVD comes with a small amount of extras: one deleted scene, a very short behind-the-scenes featurette, and commentary by the Ford Brothers, who wrote and directed ""The Dead.""  I don't often listen to commentaries, but in this case I'm glad I did because the Fords are quite engaging and informative.  They explain the extreme difficulties of film-making in Africa, detailing the rampant illnesses among cast and crew (Rob Freeman came close to death from malaria) and the ever-present local corruption that forced them to continually improvise, adapt, and overcome just to get the movie made.

SUMMARY:
""The Dead"" proves that there are still good zombie tales to be told, and it's a worthy addition to the Romero-style undead canon.  Recommended for the horror/zombie aficionado who's looking for a different take on the genre and is also interested in the film-making process.",1331337600,,2897,5.193548387096774
4982719,2,B006BZ8O3I,"When it comes to zombie films, there has been no real innovation in the genre since George A. Romero pretty much invented it and the rules they all seem to follow with his ""Dead"" films. In order to stand out, you really have to do something special and spectacular. The newest film to enter this genre titled The Dead, doesn't do much other than place the action in the beautiful African landscape, which certainly creates a new landscape for the characters to interact within but does little else to help the plot.

Directed by The Ford Brothers and shot on previously unseen locations across Burkina Faso and Ghana, West Africa, the story focuses on American Air Force engineer Lieutenant Brian Murphy (Rob Freeman), the sole survivor of a plane crash, who must make his way across Africa to get back to his family, fighting off the living dead along the way. He joins forces with local military Sergeant Daniel Dembele (Prince David Osei) who is searching for his missing son. Together they must overcome their differences in order to survive the flesh-eating menace that attack them at every turn.

The film follows all the rules of the zombie genre with no surprises. It has slow-moving zombies, that eat flesh and pass on their infliction through biting you, they can only be killed by a shot to the head, and yet, somehow, despite their lumbering movements, people still manage to get caught by them.

The bottom line is, if you're looking for something unexpected and exciting in The Dead, you're looking in the wrong place. Why do zombies seem to attract our attention so often? Some could say its just the current trend but others would argue (and this reviewer would agree) that zombies are something we can relate to. Unlike most movie monsters that we've seen zombies are tangible, we could visualize an actual plague of such creatures. The idea of defending ourselves against an impending onslaught seems to trigger a long buried survival instinct or perhaps we just love the idea of letting out some aggression without any consequences.

Now on DVD, The Dead looks good on screen; unfortunately this was a standard version not Blu-ray but quite frankly there wasn't within this film that would have benefited from Blu-ray. As for special features, there are 3: first a commentary from the director, second a behind the scenes look at the film and last some deleted scenes.

So for die hard zombie film fans out there, you may want to grab yourself a copy of this film otherwise this time around you're better off popping in Zombieland for a good laugh. No thanks are needed.",1331251200,,2589,4.7959641255605385

The thing is that all of the zombie movies I've seen (except maybe the Fulchi one) have the same USA urban or mall backdrop, which I why I really enjoyed this one set in Africa.

It gives the movie a little something special and a different perspective than the norm.  It's hard as a 3rd generation CA girl to comprehend a place that doesn't have a store/station within hundreds of miles to get gas, food or water.  The idea of dealing with a zombie apocolypse in such an arena made this zombie movie more unsettling than the usual zombie fare, an extra layer of creepiness!

I thought ""The Dead"" was really good, right up until the ending where you find out about the fate of Lt. Murphy's family.  It was not the most original ending I've ever seen, but it's pretty difficult to have an upbeat ending to a zombie film (Zombieland is probably the closest ""happy ending"" to a zombie movie I've seen).

That being said, great movie and I would recommend it to any ""zombie fan"".",1331164800,,1105,4.387254901960785
4982721,4,B006BZ8O3I,"Zombie movies have always fascinated me because of the strong apocalyptic theme which intermixes with their storyline.  Recently, I had the chance to watch The Dead on DVD by Howard and John Ford and wanted to share a few of my thoughts with you in this review.

As a quick conclusion, here is a summary of my thoughts about this humanity run amok film

Pros:
- Plenty of classic zombie gore
- Good survivalist themes and cues
- Non-stop gun, hacking and chewing action

Cons:
- Plot holes fail to engage your interest

The Dead is certainly a good old-fashioned zombie movie which starts out in desert setting with a man wearing black cloth fighting off zombies.  The story here is that the last plane from a relief mission in Africa has crashed into the ocean.  The survivors find themselves on a beach and must find safety as they battle hordes of zombies.  The gore, even in the early minutes, seen in this movie is surprisingly authentic with various body parts shown chewed on or bitten off.

For those who enjoy picking up on key survivalist themes in zombie movies, The Dead will definitely deliver.  At several points in this movie there are mistakes made that will have you cringing at the lack of preparation the characters make during their treacherous journey through the hot African countryside.  Without revealing to much detail about the movie itself, poor decisions like not carrying water bottles or having a night watch lead to disastrous results for our unlucky band of survivors.  However, the movie is filled some innovative solutions for zombie survival.  In one case string is wrapped around the campsite perimeter with a low tech alarm to help alert our heroes of impending doom.  Yes, I highly recommend this film to any survivalist that is always eager to learn new strategies or tactics!

The DVD version of this film comes in a cool reflective outer box.  On the DVD itself they also included a nice movie commentary which I found helpful towards understanding the plot line.  The behind the scenes outtakes and deleted scene were also a joy to watch.

Revealing all of the plot holes that I discovered in this film will ruin the campy feeling that this film gives off.  Yet, at the same time, I resist calling it a true B movie because of the solid performances by the main character Brian Murphy.  As a result, I gave this film a 4 star rating and encourage any true zombie fan to pick it up.  If its non-stop gore and head shots that you seek this film truly delivers.",1331164800,2,2500,4.649202733485193

4982723,2,B006BZ8O3I,"Ugh. Where to start.

I rented this due to the higher ratings, and that I love zombies. I was VERY disappointed. The cinematography is good but every other aspect of the movie is pretty terrible.

I'm not a huge movie nerd or anything but the acting was TERRIBLE. There was a couple of instances where an actor would be cutting another off in the dialogue and would pause, so the other actor could interrupt--as if the timing wasn't right. There were also some cliche one-liners that were pretty pathetic. The actors seemed to be over-acting a bit while doing emotional things such as reflecting about life, etc. I felt like if even I could pick up on that, they were probably in some pretty poor shape.

If you walk faster than a slow shuffle, it's an impossibility to get bitten. This makes the zombies not very scary and every moment anyone is in danger, creates a feeling of 'COME ON! How did you NOT see that coming? They've been walking up to you for 20 minutes!""

The plot is, for the most part, pretty predictable. There were several loose ends, gaps or purposeless segments that were never tied to anything, such as a village shaman, how the infection started, etc.

The character development was weak and left me not really caring if the main characters survived, which is not how you should feel during a movie.

Teach and I love our Zombie movies. We are big thriller fans and since The Walking Dead is our favorite show of the moment we were excited to see this.

While they don't have a big zombie makeup budget, what they lack in zombielicious, they make up in cinematography and storyline.

Rated R due to the flesh eating zombie scenes which are very reminiscent from the zombie movies of my youth, I found this apocalyptic movie moving in a very quiet way. Two men, one white, one black, both trying to get to their family work together to survive the zombie Apocalypse.  On the surface they appear very different but underneath they are the same, two dads who hold on dearly to a photo of their family and do what they can to take care of each other while surviving.

While the movie is different than most, these zombies are quiet. They can sneak up on ya in a second. They walk so slow that it is amazing they get anywhere at all. You can literally finish filling your car full of gas even if they are within eye sight because they walk slower than my 96 year old grandmother. All the zombies have beautiful blue, white eyes and they all look like they are starving. Nothing like trying to eat the living when the living are already dying from hunger.

The two main actors do a great job of holding the movie together and Prince David Osei is such a good looking guy that I was bummed when it looked like he wouldn't be getting back to his son.

We loved the movie despite the lack of action or drama but were extremely disappointed with the ending. The movie may have taken itself too seriously and ran out of gas in the last 5 minutes. Due to the lack of a proper ending we give this movie 3 out of 5. Nicely done.",1330819200,2,1732,4.262195121951219

I have not eaten a human since watching this film, although it has not been a real test of my willpower. This was a Vine product that I accepted for review without spending time to find out more about it, but I was in a hurry.  I am sure I will get a comment telling me that I should not have viewed a film if I knew it was one in which I would not like.  Why not?

""The Dead"" offers an interesting variation on the typical zombie flick by setting its action in an unnamed African nation rife with tribal conflict.  When the dead begin to rise, the tribes join forces in an unprecedented way to battle the new, horrific threat.  American military engineer Brian Murphy (Rob Freeman) is on the last flight out of the area, but the plane crashes, leaving him the sole survivor.  Gathering weapons and gear, he makes his way into the African jungle in an attempt to find a way out of the area to safety.

Naturally, during his trek, he does battle with assorted zombies and eventually comes upon a soldier (Prince David Osei) on a mission to locate his missing son.

The film will remind you of ""The Walking Dead"" and pictures in the George Romero zombie franchise, but ""The Dead"" has its moments and is good at building and sustaining suspense.  The acting is acceptable, if not Academy Award caliber, and the scenery breathtaking, something we haven't really seen a lot in zombie movies.

Make-up is exceptional, and there's plenty of blood and gore to satisfy serious zombie film fans.  The directors (Howard J.

Nothing was spared in making this film... the story was an interesting and well written one, the actors... from lead actors to the extras used as zombies and survivors were great!!!, makeup and effects were realistic ... and the filming / cinematography put the view right in the mist of the action!!!
These zombies were great... they were slow and just shuffled along, following the living, but when they were close enough to attack, they were predator fast and deadly!
There were no zombie nazi solders, no Brad Pitt, nobody trying to have zombie mc-loving, no 3-d filming, no zombified animals, no survivor with a hand held camera filming, and no zomidy humor... thank GOD!!!
I just can't say enough about this movie...it has been a long time since i have seen a zombie movie where the zombies have looked and acted so zombie-listic that they have ""freaked"" me out... they do it in spades in The Dead!!! It's non stop, rest for a few minutes, look out here come zombies, scarey zombie action... Zack Snider can't hold a candle to the Ford Brothers!!!

This movie is well worth it's low price... you are getting way more than what you are paying for!!!

4982740,3,B006BZ8O3I,"I like horror movies and I like zombie flicks, but I'm hestitant to respond to everything that gets put out there in the gluttony of the over-produced genre.  Today, I find myself more and more cynical toward the idea - especially since Romero's latest films seem to contain less 'umph than his original trilogy.  To me the biggest mistake I saw in the genre is the move to CGI blood, which seemed an injustice to the likes of Tom Savini and those that pioneered the effects that made the genre what it was during the height of Dawn and Day of the Dead.

This movie seems to suffer the same fate.  I wanted to enjoy a non-typical zombie flick, which this promised to be by moving the location out to the African desert and away from the urban environment.  My first thought was something like the game Resident Evil 5, which would remove the safety net Hollywood had been working with for years.  And why not, zombie movies needed a new subtext similar to Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, etc.  This could be it... Africa.

For me the possible motivation of this movie got over shadowed.  Not by the hoards of ravenous flesh eaters, but with the CGI blood and repetitive storyline.  I had originally read a critic call this, ""The Best Zombie Movie of the Year"" - and that's probably true.  Only problem is that the competition seemed to be lacking, making that statement less of a compliment than it sounds.

Overall this movie is fairly well made for its budget and has some genuine moments that shine, but sometimes cutting a single corner makes a big difference.  Until CGI is unnoticeably disimilar from practical effects, give us cinema fans what we deserve.  Most casual fans will say that I take this small defect to heart when I should be focusing on the film - to this I agree on some levels.  I just hold the progression of zombie cinema to a higher standard than other genres.  My comments are not because I hate this film; it's because I had hoped to love it.",1330560000,,1982,4.479108635097493

This flick was actually a bit slow in spots, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. But it had a good realistic plot and believable characters. The African setting was a different twist and the make-up was amazing, it made me believe in zombies. I highly recommend it.",1330473600,,398,4.541666666666667

The plot is good and the special effects are top notch! There are a few really great gore scenes! This is not a big budget film but I think the Ford brothers got big bang for the buck! The two main characters are on a mission to be reunited with family but the ""undead"" are all over the place to ruin their day. I also enjoyed using Africa for the location for this film it was really a good idea.  I believe this is the first zombie flick filmed in Africa!

As it says, it's set in the African wilderness so it's not like there's hordes of zombies chasing the characters and this is what makes the movie so unique. I bought this movie at Walmart and watched it over lunch that afternoon. I found a movie that I do not regret buying unlike Autumn and some of the other recent direct garbage fests. The effects were good without being over the top as well which only added to the realistic feel of the movie. I highly recommend this movie unless you're the kind of person who thinks The Walking Dead is junk because there's not enough focus on zombies.",1330214400,2,753,4.385714285714286

This one had hero's, and zombies are the villians (of course).  It has a hopeful ending.  It had suspense.  It was well directed, good gore factor, and make-up effects.  Some people might not like the numbers of zombies out in the wilds of Africa, but I know it has populated regions. I think that the budget on this movie was smaller than many worse zombie movies. The Ford brothers are worth investing in. This movie didn't change anything about the zombie lore, except thank God the zombies didn't run.

In conclusion, it's a decent film but nothing new that we haven't seen time and time again.  Though it should be noted that it is a zombie film so there isn't much to diverge from, besides the typical running for your life and avoiding zombie hot spots.",1330041600,,516,4.764044943820225
4982747,4,B006BZ8O3I,"I am a fan of the zombie horror genre, including novels, comics (The Walking Dead), video games (Left 4 Dead) & films.  I read great reviews of this on BluRay.com & Amazon & bought the disk unseen (rare for me).  I was not disappointed.

PROs:
Intense linear zombie survival stories of two main characters [Almost like a movie version of Left 4 Dead]
Zombies from the George Romero school of horror [Slow moving corpses that never stop]
Awesome gore & special effects--the zombies themselves & the kills look real
Realistic survival in a nightmare world [characters didn't waste time with idle chitchat]
Great direction by the Ford Brothers and cinematography
African setting is original & beautiful
No social messages, just zombie flesh eating
A THOUSAND times better than Romeros ""Survial of the Dead"" & ""Diary of the Dead""
Outstanding Ending

CONs:
I would have liked to see some zombie lions or elephants since they were in Africa [like the undead birds in Resident Evil Extinction]
Needs a bit more character & background development [more about the outbreak or virus--one star taken away]

[NOTE]:  Overall, this film is mandatory for zombie fans.

4982759,3,B006BZ8O3I,"Simply put, ""The Dead"" is ""zombies in Africa."" A 2010 UK horror is a throwback to George A. Romero-style zombie horror films, in which the undead walk, not run. Directed by Howard J. Ford and Jonathan Ford, a low-budget horror ""The Dead"" suffers from its slow-moving pace and weak acting, but the film still remains mildly entertaining thanks to the wide and open African landscapes.

Rob Freeman plays Lt. Brian Murphy, an American flight mechanic and survivor of the airplane that, while trying to evacuate the land, crashed off the coast somewhere in the West Africa. Later Brian is saved by Sgt. Daniel Dembele (Prince David Oseia), a local military man who is looking for his missing son. The simply story is drawn out, but not bad.

Like Romero's classic zombie films, why or how people turned into zombies is not explained. It is an old-school zombie film where the undead slowly but steadily close in on you. The film is more creepy than scary with decent special make-ups and the savannah that is effectively used as the backdrop of the story.

The Ford Brothers' ""The Dead"" is a surprisingly effective combination of zombie horror and road movie that is almost politics-free. A pity that with a tighter narrative and more fleshed-out characters, the film's ending could have been more impactful and emotional.",1329782400,,1319,4.9058295964125564

This was the true survival horror feeling of the Romero classics and it's captured so well, and there is even some of the social commentary in ""the Dead"" that Romero always managed to sneak into his earlier films (perhaps subconsciously)
this is so lacking in the recent efforts, including the Walking Dead (which is still great)

4982763,5,B006BZ8O3I,"I've been a zombie movie fan ever since i was like 8 years old when Romero and Fulci were leading the way. Nowadays it's hard to find a worthy zombie movie cause there have been numerous crappy attempts aside from a select few titles. The Dead brings on the old school zombie movie tradition where the zombies are slow but it's the mass numbers that makes them so overwhelming. The Dead gets started right from the start and wastes no time on plot explanation. Set in Africa where the entire continent seems to gone to hell with a virus outbreak causing dead to rise and try to kill anything living, an engineer and an african soldier try to escape the hell across hot/desert landscape with zombies lurking everywhere...let me re-emphasize EVERYWHERE! This movie gives you an uneasy feeling throughout the whole movie because you feel the urgency the characters feel when they have so many encounters with death. Definitely alot of scenes that get branded in your mind from this movie. Movie goes slow at times but overall a must watch if you're a zombie movie fan. It's not better than Romero's early movies but it's definitely better than most other zombie movies so i'd put it in above the mid tier section but not with the best of Romero's. I'm not disappointed in the movie at all",1329609600,,1285,4.640350877192983
4982764,5,B006BZ8O3I,"The movie was well shot and relatively well acted.  Quite a few very nicely composed shots - thumbs up for the cinematographer.  Editing had a few choices I wouldn't have made but otherwise quite good with portions of outstanding.  The effects seemed to be mostly practical and if any were digital they didn't scream ""DIGITAL!!"" (like even portions of the big budget ""The Expendables"" did)  to me.  The take was interesting  -- the premise of a soldier/mechanical engineer/missionary in Africa when the SHTF is a good one.  Like real life would be it is tedium interspersed with sheer terror.  All in all I would say that for a no budget movie this is a 5 star effort.  Props to the cast, crew, writer and director.  Good on ya.  For the viewer, if you like ""The Walking Dead"" with it's mix of drama and occasional terror then I think you would probably enjoy this.  If you want a roller coaster action movie of a zombie movie then this might not be your cup of tea.  When I compare this movie with no stars and no budget to would be blockbusters like the incredibly poor adaptation of ""I Am Legend"" the accomplishment of these film makers takes this 4 star movie into 5 star territory.

If you have ever watched a Romero movie and found yourself saying ""Get on with the zombie killin and the scares already! "" then this movie is for you. I gave it 4 stars because the acting wasn't the best(although there wasn't much need) and the special effects weren't up to par with say Land of the Dead. I don't know for sure but I don't figure this movie had a huge budget so I can easily overlook those flaws. I hope this movie does well and another gets made.

After reading a few reviews I decd. it might be worth my time since I am a die hard movie and tv fan of this genre.  The zombies are not particularity scary but there is enough gore and guts to feed anyone's need for blood and brains:) Sometimes, even for me, it was a bit hard to watch but I always looked back at the screen in fear that I would miss some of the good dramatic scenes found in this movie. The script was smart and interesting.  Smart because it did not give much away...we never find out how or why this infestation happens, we do not know much more about the zombies with the exception of they are EVERYWHERE...and all of this really keeps the story line going.  I could not GUESS about the ending...the solutions of anything like I normally could in a regular movie of this type.  This is what makes this movie unique and interesting. Prince did his thing in this movie! No, not Prince the artist..but the actor called Prince in this movie:)  Great job..the other main guy did ok..he seemed natural but the Prince really did show him up.  Anyway, for anyone debating if this will be worth the $4 bucks..i say yes, go for it!  It will be different than what you expect but it has a nice driven story line and there really is never a dull moment.  Nothing scary/shocking to me but lots of blood and bones to go around.

I can't remember one in which there weren't plenty of characters getting off on the violence, laughing at blowing the zombies away. I enjoy plenty of those stories as well, and they have their place. But THE DEAD portrays one survivor's odyssey in the brutal African continent with a refreshing sense of humanity. I haven't flinched at so many zombie attacks in one of these movies before, simply because of the raw realism the movie captures. You find yourself caring about each living person, and you don't want them to suffer.

The story finds US technical engineer Brian Murphy (Rob Freeman) stranded in an overrun Africa, struggling for survival as he wends his way toward whatever air base he can find, in the brutal desert heat. Zombies are everywhere, the slow-moving type, silently meandering through the bush, ghostlike in the night ... as if the place needed just one more thing that could kill you! (Surprisingly, there's a lack of zoology: big cats, snakes, crocs, hippos and elephants are nowhere to be seen. Oh, well.)

After meeting and teaming up with a local military man (Prince David Oseia), the two make their trek across the increasingly dangerous terrain, with things getting very, very bleak.  While The Dead has its share of flaws, from the occasional pedestrian acting from Freeman to the inconsistent pacing, this film manages to pack a punch regardless.

4982795,4,B006BZ8O3I,"Nuff said.  However to come up with my other 18 words, here goes.  In a bleak landscape there is nothing but sagebrush and zombies.  Lots and lots of zombies.  Very proper zombies.  They are slow, they don't run off at the mouth, they don't drive cars and you know the only thing to do is shoot them in the head before they munch on you and turn YOU into a zombie.  And this is how it should be.  Over in Burkina Faso where this movie was made you can probably hire a first class zombie actor superstar for 35 cents and a couple of bottles of the local beer a day.  We got zombies galore.  I didn't lose count, I just didn't even try: So many zombies, so little running time.

Do we know what started the whole zombie phenomenom?  No, and we really don't need to.  So much for cluttering the plot up with a lot of trivia about how it all came about, any decent zombie movie aficianado doesn't need an explanatory foundation for his zombie movie.  Here are the zombies: They are here and they are coming after you and it is time for you to deal with them.  This is all we need to know.  In any decent zombie movie it is a given that there are zombies in the world and it is time to be alert; or get bit and become one yourself.  Trust me on this.

8496210,4,B006BZ8O3I,"The Dead has become a worldwide cult hit among zombie movie fans but at the same time exposes one of the major fault lines within the zombie fan base. This is between those who mainly see zombie films as part of the horror, action, thriller genres and those who also can accept them as human interest dramas. It's not that a person can't like both sub-genres, I certainly do, but it seems that some of the action-oriented fans don't like non-action zombie films because The Dead gets as much real hate as praise online. It's a slow and quiet film.

It's is a small budget film, which after a harrowing and crowded opening shifts all the acting to basically two characters. They are Lieutenant Brian Murphy (Rob Freeman) and a man he meets on the road, Sgt. Daniel Dembele (Prince David Oseia). Brian is the sole survivor of a plane crash of people trying to escape the zombies. David is a soldier who has left his unit amid the chaos to find his son. The film takes place in the West African country of Burkina Fasso (formerly Upper Volta), where it was actually shot. Burkina Fasso is mostly located in the Sahel, the band of hot and dry but still habitable country that borders the Sahara Desert. The scenery is a big plus for this movie and a total departure from the usual zombie locales. Toward the end it even includes a passage through the great rock escarpment known as the Peaks of Sindou in the west of Burkina Fasso near Mali. It's pretty amazing scenery.

The scenery is not all that's different about this film. The zombies are their own type as well. They're slow, but not the lurching Walking Dead type. They slowly advance with a swaying gait, almost like they're sleepwalking, just fast enough to be menacing. They are totally silent and can creep up on you. There was no budget for Walking Dead type grotesque faces and basically they're just pale. Many are missing limbs and none of that is CGI, but due to wars in the region. It's their numbers that get you. No matter where you go, and this is the wide open spaces of West Africa, they're there. Usually one here and two there and a little group over there, but as the two drive through this arid and desolate region there are always some in the background. You simply cannot get away from them.

The tone of the film is wonderfully serious and very bleak. This is a welcome relief from a kind of campy silliness that has crept into zombie films lately, even films that aren't supposed to be zombie comedies. The action is slow and mostly concerns the two men getting to know and trust each other but there are some memorably gory scenes as well. This was directed by brothers Howard and Jonathan Ford and was shot on 35mm film rather than digitally, giving it a classic film look. It has been so successful that they have made a sequel set in India, Dead 2. If you can take something besides constant attacks and shooting in a zombie film this is one to see.

EXTRA NOTE: Many people online ask why they didn't include a lot of the big animals of Africa in the film. Elephants, giraffes, lions, rhinos, hippos, etc. Those animals are mostly in East and South Africa. This was shot in a part of West Africa where those animals don't exist (Except for a few giraffes near the border of Benin). Here there are crocodiles, some monkeys, antelopes and anteaters but not much else. So don't expect that big scene with the zombies taking down a rhino.",1475625600,5,3416,4.49597423510467
