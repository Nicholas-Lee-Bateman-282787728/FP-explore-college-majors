7974288,3,B000077W1A,"This ain't Khalis from the Universal movies folks and this movie is not for the kiddies.  In fact, the Mummy in question is only a prop for the greatest special effect of all...the divine Misty Mundae.  Misty's great, and I thoroughly enjoyed seeing her in this ""movie,"" but good lord this is a cheapy.  The starting scene of Misty luxurating around on a bed is distracting because of the dingy-looking bed she's rolling around on.  Thank goodness someone had the good sense to cover up the bed with a red velvet sheet or we may have glimpsed a few Butterfinger or Heath bar pieces left over from director William Hellfire's nightly trips to DQ.

The next scene of Misty in the shower is great, but again I was distracted by the condition of the shower itself.  FILTHY!  I mean, good god, why not clean the freaking thing up before you put your beautiful starlet in it! I love the pan down Misty's body where you can clearly see the tiles missing from the bottom of the shower, and the weird fungus growing on the grout.  I don't consider myself a clean freak, but I can only hope poor Misty didn't get a nasty case of athlete's foot by stepping in there. Yuk!

Alright, the rest of the movie isn't that bad, in fact Misty in the library looking at the books/ videos is my favorite scene.  However, I had a hard time (no pun intended) believing that Misty is looking through her dad's collection of pornos when you can clearly see a collection of Harry Potter books on the bookcase in front of her.  But hey, one man's porn is another man's Potter or something like that.

Anyway, Misty fools around with the Mummy and the Mummy's undead girlfriend and then heads upstairs to change her clothes.  All a day at the office.

The extra short film ""The Vibrating Maid"" is really bad and makes little use of Ms. Mundae's extraordinary talents.  You can probably guess from the title what it's about.

The extra bonuses are clips from three early films with Misty in cameos and are interesting if only to see a really young Misty with short hair (!) and a makeout scene with Misty and a guy in which Misty is sporting a really painful-looking case of sunburn.  Owch!  Porcelain skin does have its drawbacks...

I'd recommend this to Misty fans and completists, but at over $20 you may want to wait a while.  Everyone else who might be wondering what all this ""Misty Mundae"" stuff is about would be better suited renting or buying ""Witchbabe 3.""  Now that's a good movie...",1120521600,6,2466,4.509009009009009
7974289,1,B000077W1A,"I don't know how people liked this movie... compared to other movies of the same type.  Most of softcore movies don't have good stories, but this one has none.  The sex scenes are boring.  Most of the actress, except Misty, are bad looking.

I think I waisted my money on this one.",1112054400,2,281,4.346153846153846
7974290,2,B000077W1A,"Every other review here rants about how this is the ultimate Misty Mundae film. If that's my understanding, I don't need to see any more of them. Don't get me wrong. I'm a Misty fan. But I really have some issues with Seduction Cinema.

First off, the ""feature"" is only about a half hour long. And the tacked on ""Vibrating Maid"" short is only about 20 minutes. And being Seduction Cinema, the other women in these features are both absolutely hideous. TThe fat maid has sagging breasts and nipples that are as big as dinner plates. The woman in the Mummy short just stands there in a bad harem outfit and rubs her breasts. Ooooh, I'm (yawn) getting...so...horny....

And you know, Seduction might be part of their name, but it isn't part of the execution. You see beautiful Misty climbing out of bed with a thong on. Now, I don't know about you, but I'd like to see a little thong shot. Nope, off they go. This happens all the time in SC films. Beautiful lingerie? Quick, get it off before someone enjoys it!

And whoever operates the camera must've been given the instructions ""Don't bother shooting the good stuff from an angle you can see"". Misty is in a short skirt writhing on the Mummy's face. Where's the camera? In front of her, not behind where you could enjoy it. And the mummy is just a joke. His ""unit"" is all wrapped up. And Misty goes down on it! What a waste. And anything kinky you might get out of this shot is pointless since the camera is on the other side of the room.

I must admit though, this is the first SC feature I've seen that shows women getting off on things other than their nipples being played with (a problem in all other SC films I've seen).

Whatever crappy bits of plot they come up with always end up eating up major screen time! It's obvious they know the stories are crap. They don't even try to compensate for it with good nookie! I'd be willing to pay more for this films if they promised to show some actual smut. I like soft-core stuff, but most of their films don't even qualify. The movies are so bad they would make Joe Bob Briggs puke. There's never more than a minutes worth of spankable material in ANY SC film. If you don't agree, go jack off to Animal Planet or something, because you obviously have no idea what ""erotic"" means.

Misty needs to leave these talentless bastards behind.",1092960000,14,2336,4.408352668213457
7974291,5,B000077W1A,"This dvd feature Misty at her lustiest showing full on budity 90% of the film and even a nude upskirt(NO PANTIES), the ABSOLUTE most Misty has ever shown up previously.  She tramples around in mini skirts and skimpy outfits, speaking in a society girl voice.  One of the great lines in the film is when Misty says in her society rich teen girl voice ""Oh, Daddy, you know I'm always a good girl""
Great stuff with a full 20 minute featurette and half a dozen featurettes(almost as much as teh entire dvd ""Girl Seduction"", featuring a great clip of Misty making out with some guy in a abandon house, she's a SO young here, and very PERKY!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1087862400,4,647,4.521367521367521

7974293,5,B000077W1A,"This is teh ultimate B-film.  I mean it's just an excuse for the nubile actress to prance around in skimpy schoolgirl outfits and short skirts.  she takes a shower fully nude and then runs around the house half naked and then full again.  She fools around with a Mummy, and speaks in a phoney Katherine Hepburn rich society girls accent.  A cute film, and an excuse to see Miss Mundae's crudentials and best assets.",1081987200,3,415,4.5675675675675675
7974294,5,B000077W1A,"I have seen a lot of Misty Mundae films, and this is by far my favorite.  The 18 year old actress prances around in short and tight mini skirts, bends over, and gives us upskirt shots(& she ain't wearin no underwaer, so we get to see all the goods!!!).  In 90 percent of the film she's topless.  I must admid the costars which are all females are ugly, but that only makes Misty more enticing...takes a long shower(without wetting her hair!).  The bonus is at the end, when she eroticly dresses, into retro lingerie, reminding us of another striptease from another era, Miss Betty Paige.  Mundae will appeal to fans of girls who look younger, and who have an innocent looking face.  It's great when she says stuff liek I'm always a good girl Daddy!  The other feature is just so-so, she interacts with an UGLY as heck maid, but the main reason for thsi is the Mummy flick and a scene of Poetic Seduction, where Misty makes out with a guy on a bed, and we get some more upskirt shots, in white panties OOOHHH!!!  An 18 year old Misty!!!  Also there are some great outtakes from teh Mummy film, where Misty goofs up and even blows us some rasberry's.  So put this dvd on next time you are alone and dateless, get a box of tissues and some vasoline...",1073606400,3,1248,4.363636363636363
7974295,2,B000077W1A,"Lust in the Mummy's Tomb is a weird little film.  There's a mummy, there seems to be a good helping of lust, but there is no tomb to be found anywhere.  Misty Mundae adopts an English accent to play the young and ""innocent"" daughter of some kind of scientist.  When her father leaves her a note telling her to stay away from his study, she naturally heads right in there.  What she finds is a mummy lying on the floor.  There are two distinctive things about this particular mummy.  First, the mummy cloth is incredibly clean and bright to be a couple of thousand years old; second, he is obviously pretty darn well-endowed for a mummy.  Misty starts ""playing"" with him at which point an Egyptian woman who turns out to be an unattractive Cleopatra steps out of the corner and watches the scene.  The mummy is her eternal lover, and he will be reawakened if Misty manages to satisfy herself (if you know what I mean).  The mummy indeed comes to life, chases Misty around the house a while, and then sort of unravels himself into oblivion.  Without her eternal lover, Cleopatra makes her own special request of Misty, and that request is granted.

I can't even call this a movie really, as it is only 40 minutes long and has no real end-instead, it seems as if the cameraman just quit shooting at some point.  We start out watching Misty loll around on the bed awhile, then we watch her take a shower.  Then the lust and mummy business gets taken care of.  Here's what gets me: the end of the movie features Misty putting on her clothes; you don't see an ending like that every day in the erotic B-movie genre.  This movie would almost make more sense if you watched it backwards.

Both the DVD and video also include a 26-minute featurette called The Vibrating Maid.  There's not much to tell here.  Misty, once again playing the role of a young British girl, hears something akin to a weed eater in an adjacent room, gets up to see what it is, and finds the maid entertaining herself in the closet.  She promises not to tell her daddy what she has seen if the maid will show her exactly what she was doing.  That's pretty much it.  This is an item only Misty Mundae fans should have any interest in because it is quite inconsequential; without her, it would have zero value whatsoever.  My advice to any potential viewers is to concentrate on Misty because her co-stars in each feature have almost nothing to offer.",1044662400,11,2416,4.468036529680365
