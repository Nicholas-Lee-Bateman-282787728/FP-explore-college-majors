8073352,4,B000A2XC62,I have a few other workout DVDs by Guillermo. His routine is similar in all of them but with varying intensity. This one is pretty easy and as presented a low intermediate. I add weighted gloves and/or ankle weights and also jumping jacks to make it more challenging. It's a nice routine when I don't want to work too hard. His form is great and he cues well. He likes to count in Spanish which I don't mind.,1332633600,,408,4.243589743589744
8073353,2,B000A2XC62,"Pretty average workout and definitely below the ""intermediate"" workout advertised.  I had to put on a 10lb vest and weighted gloves to get a decent sweat.  Cueing was off and the production itself appeared badly edited.  Gomez has excellent form, nonetheless.",1289088000,,259,5.2682926829268295
8073354,5,B000A2XC62,"So I bought this home work video with rather low expectations, but after a only a few workouts I noticed amazing results! I was tighter, firmer, and stronger, and I could go for longer! Guillermo changed my life. He is a kickbox inspiration (as well as one hot hunk of espanol) and I would recommend this video for every woman who ever dreamed of having a well-toned bod and a greater Spanish vocabulary!

The Techno music really gets me going! It's so motivating, I feel like I jabbing, kicking, and thrusting like I'm at a club!",1267833600,5,530,4.520833333333333
8073355,4,B000A2XC62,"I work out to DVD's allthe time mand have been through what seems like a ton. Guillermo is a great instructor.  I took off one star ust because the production value is not that great BUT this is a great workout.  I'm in good shape and I can work up a sweat and high heart rate to this video. If you like kicking, you'll like this video!",1218153600,,336,4.0
8073356,4,B000A2XC62,"This intermediate-level workout  is slower than some other kickboxing workouts I've done, but it's still very intense. This workout offers drill-type kickboxing, not much choreography. I feel you could make this more advanced by adding some power into the slower moves and putting your all into the punches. I use light weighted gloves while I do it,(1-1/2 lbs.) and when I complete it I feel exhaused! I consider myself intermediate-low advanced level cardio.  My thighs need more work and I felt that doing the moves a bit slower lets you hold the muscle contractions longer...and I feel it more in my legs. The only reason I would rate this at a lower intensity than a Cathe or Billy kickboxing workout would be the length. Had this been a 45-60 minute workout, it would have killed me!

I love the techno music... very different and upbeat. I like doing crescent kicks and this workout has a lot of it. Lots of kicks on this workout. The time goes by very quickly for me. The workout grows on me. The more I have done it using light weighted gloves, the more I sweat each time.",1185235200,6,1081,4.590673575129534
8073357,4,B000A2XC62,"I used to take kickboxing classes at my local gym, but was sidelined for a while by cancer treatments.  Now I'm trying to get back in shape, so I consider myself to be back at the beginner level. I got a great workout from this DVD, and I actually had to ""step-touch"" for about 10 minutes in the middle to catch my breath!  As the other reviewer said, Guillermo does a good job building the combinations. I found his personality and music to be enjoyable. I'm looking forward to doing this workout many, many more times in the future!",1184198400,3,534,4.383838383838384
8073358,2,B000A2XC62,"I was disappointed with this workout.  I have been working out for a long time and would consider myself at the intermediate/advanced level.  I bought this DVD after purchasing Hardcore Kickbox Circuit with Janis Saffel.  The parts that Guillermo Gomez did on that DVD were great- a much better workout that Janis Saffel's sections and fun and intense. So I thought I would buy this Guillermo Gomez Kickbox Underground.

Fist off, the production on this is not very good.  But I could have lived with that if the workout was decent.  I barely broke a sweat and my heart rate was not much above resting.  It's very slow and great for a beginner, but if you want a real and intense workout, look for something else.

One thing that Guillermo Gomez is very good at, however, is going through the steps and building each combo.  He also works both sides evenly.",1150934400,12,857,4.622516556291391
