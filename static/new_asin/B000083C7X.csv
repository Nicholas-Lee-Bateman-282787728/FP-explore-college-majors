Some of the dvd footage is available on the VH1.com, but trust me, there is a lot more to see! I'm really looking foward to it and I can almost dare to say this: ""Any Given Thursday"" is going to be one of the best DVD's of 2003!",1041897600,13,314,3.772727272727273

1823751,1,B000083C7X,"Nice album. The man is a very good musician and a great songwriter. Very sadly, the sound on this album has some sort of weird sequence of control manipulations that have to accomplished before you can actually hear the music. John, get another production company before you lose your whole DVD audience.",1434240000,,304,4.865384615384615
1823752,1,B000083C7X,"I have watched Mayer's ""Where the Light Is"" at least 20 times.  Yet, I have not been able to make it through ""Any Given Thursday"" even once.  The sound from the stage is mixed poorly with Mayer's vocals and guitar being overwhelmed by the sounds of the band.  The sound of the DVD is mixed poorly with audience screams drowning out the band.  By the way, I suspect that the audience howls are looped, added to the sound edit to create a certain excitement.  It never matches the audience shots and it's highly repetitive.  So not only does it distract from the performance, it appears canned and inauthentic.

In the service of brevity, I'll summurize other problems with the concert film.  The camera work is sloppy with distracting shots.  4:3 film ratio so you must remember to adjust your HDTV's - mine didn't scale automatically from 16:9 so for several minutes I wondered why everything was stretched wide.  Mayer, in his early stages of his career, ""eats the mike"" as another reviewer has mentioned.  That's horrible to watch and horrible to hear.

Just don't get this DVD.  Buy ""Where the Light Is"" instead.  That concert film is everything this video is not - a beautifully shot, expertly mixed display of a tight band.",1431216000,3,1228,4.704225352112676

1823757,2,B000083C7X,"I LOVE John Mayer's music. However, this concert was so badly sound edited, that I couldn't stand watching/listening to it a second time. All you hear throughout the entire concert are girls screaming over the music; drove me crazy!!!! I donated it. Do yourself a favor if you like JM, or if you are just starting to listen to his music and buy his ""where the light is"" DVD or Blue-ray; that will knock you on your ass it's so good and the sound is fantastic.

1823791,5,B000083C7X,"It may be the marketing of John Mayer as a product that puts some people off, but taking this out on the music as he performs it on this DVD just isn't fair. Ehen I fist saw it, I stil was in the process of familiarising myself with John Mayer's music -He Isn't that big here in Europe- being very impressed with 'Room for Squares'
Seeing him perprorm most of these tracks and some others that were on the way on 'New Deep', I was in awe.
Still it is strange to see John Mayer performs his songs for thirteen years olds, all wishing to be older. At the same time the singer- songwriter-guitarplayer looking like a teenager, giving a most credible and passionate rendering of 'Man in the side' playing some fantastic guitar in the process. I cannot say I look at this DVD on a regular basis, but after having heard one of his ealier songs on my Ipod, -we're well in the post-'ontinuum' era by now,I put it on again lately and was impressed again with the joy of hearing and watching of John Mayer as a performer. This man can really play, sing and perform, and all the songs still stand. Very glad I had the impulse of buying it, some years ago.",1205366400,,1144,4.276497695852535
1823792,3,B000083C7X,"We like John.  This 2002 concert was for us disappointing; 90% acoustic guitar.  A nephew, 18 years old and a John fan, loved the DVD!  His comments however focused mostly on John's technique not necessarily the music.  Some have said the sound and video are not all that great.  To be sure this is not a ""Clapton, Crossroads"" quality video but for us we would say the DVD is still very watchable.  If you like John Mayer and enjoy acoustic guitar you will probably be pleased with this DVD.",1203897600,,491,4.46067415730337
1823793,5,B000083C7X,"This was a very good concert. John was in great form.  Voice sounded perfect.  If your looking for a Mayer concert this is the one.  Excellent shipping and DVD arrived in great condition. This is a winner and you will be happy with it, promise.",1203292800,,244,4.377777777777778
1823794,5,B000083C7X,and almost everything I have heard from JM after it was even more amazing. He's truly becoming a guitar legend.,1201046400,,111,4.6
1823795,5,B000083C7X,Enormous talent.  Here you can see guitar genius at work.  I enjoy watching this again and again for its entertainment quality.  John Mayer sings with sincerity and conviction.  Superb guitar mastery.  Quite hilarious commentary included by John himself.,1200268800,,254,5.578947368421052
1823796,4,B000083C7X,"The music sounds good, and production on the DVD was done well. The only complaint I have is that John makes lots of goofy faces and doesn't seem to have the professional stage presence of someone like Harry Connick Jr or Diana Krall.",1191974400,,234,4.465116279069767
1823797,4,B000083C7X,"This guy is just such a great performer. I have just recently become a John Mayer fan and I was really impressed by this disk. Lots of songs (all great) and fantastic sound quality.
You really get to see Johns awesome personality come through in this performance.",1187827200,,263,4.617021276595745
1823810,5,B000083C7X,"I saw John live about two weeks ago, and I can honestly say that I was blown away by his performance - his humor, energy, showmanship, and of course the fabulous singing and guitar work fall astounded me.  It was captivating - the man flat out knows how to capture an audience's emotions and adjust to the flow of the show - I found myself right there screaming with all the teenage girls when he plays ""Your Body Is A Wonderland.""  Funny when I look back on it, but it's just how he connects with you in the flow of the show.

And that's what this DVD does - it draws in the viewer to everything that makes a John Mayer concert so great.  Every couple songs, he just puts his guitar down and chats with the audience, just laid back and relaxed, showing that he is a real person with a personality - no just some guy that makes music.  But when his songs start, he enters another world - whether jumping up and down on ""No Such Thing"" or getting serious and moody on ""Something's Missing"" or ""Man On the Side.""

To address the ""sound issues"" that many reviewers have faulted this DVD for, I can't relate to their problems - the show sounds great, from John's singing and the band's playing, to the fans cheering in the background.  And no, the fans don't detract from the experience - they only get loud in between songs and at the beginning of his more famous songs.  I really can't see the sound issue - maybe it's the fault of a bad television or sound system, but it sounded great when I played it on my 8 year old Sony Trinitron television, so you're probably in good shape.  You won't complain about the sound.

Many people say they can't make out John's lyrics in this DVD - understand that this DVD was from a September, 2002 performance.  This was five years ago - his singing style has changed since then, but I still can't see what they complain about.  If you've heard his songs before, which I assume you have if you're about to buy this DVD, then you will understand every lyric he sings.

The show starts off well, but really hits its stride in the middle of the set, when he just zones in and plays.  He does a great, slow-tempo acoustic take on The Police's ""Message In A Bottle,"" and Stevie Ray Vaughan's ""Lenny"" sounds just as bluesy as the original.  The real highlight of this show, though, is ""Covered In Rain"" - a song you won't have heard unless you own the CD version of Any Given Thursday, or you've seen him in concert otherwise.  It is an emotion-filled, slow blues masterpiece - YouTube that song if you don't believe me.  His emotion and energy in this song really sum up the entire performance.

In conclusion, Any Given Thursday is the only concert DVD I own, and for good reason.  John's live performances are a treasure - for someone still so young, his music is so good, and seeing him perform live will totally draw you in as a fan - this is a good thing!  I just can't wait until a more recent live show gets released on DVD - it's been 3 albums, John...hook us up.  In the meantime, Any Given Thursday will suffice.",1185408000,,3053,4.321052631578947
1823811,5,B000083C7X,I received my purchase in good condition and sooner than anticipated.  Thanks!,1168819200,,78,5.5
1823812,3,B000083C7X,"I'd listened to a couple of CD's by John Mayer but wasn't too thrilled until I heard ""Continuum"". It grabbed my ears immediately and I thought every song was very good if not great. That's what motivated me to buy the DVD ""Any Given Thursday"". The songs sounded good but after a while they started to sound very similar...so much so that we decided to watch the rest some other time and opted for ""The Dance"" with Fleetwood Mac which we've seen countless times. Some concerts are just more watchable time after time. I'm sure you have your favorites. There were a few things that made John's concert less than thrilling for me. Granted... the guy is mega-talented, both as a singer - (I'm assuming songwriter) and guitar player. And from the noises of approval coming from the crowd I suppose you'd have to crown him stud-muffin. There were just enough young ladies in the audience that couldn't stop squealing long enough to take a breath that might make you want to scream ""please stop"" at your TV. I think I used different words. Anyway, if you can get past that its still a good concert. Where he started to really lose me is when it became clear to me that I couldn't understand what he was singing about unless he stopped to explain it. Great voice, but please, give me a coherent word or two so I can get into the song. He sounded clear as a bell on ""Continuum"" CD. Just something he could work on. Last point to throw at you is that I felt I wasn't so much seeing a band but a solo performance with backup. Maybe that wouldn't matter to anyone else but I think if you're on the same stage you don't need quite so much separation. I know, picky, picky. If you're a John Mayer fan you're probably looking for that review that will validate your purchasing impulse. I'm not sure if this review would have helped me either. For the rest of you I'd suggest borrowing someone else's DVD before taking the plunge. In the meantime, buy the CD ""Continuum"". You won't be disappointed.",1168128000,4,1982,4.462809917355372
1823813,3,B000083C7X,"I'm barely giving this 3 stars because I REALLY like John Mayer. This DVD grew on me at the same time I realized that he is eating the microphone. I know that other reviewers have mentioned this but it's worth pointing out again. Why dwell on the negative? Well, I bought this DVD because I knew it would sound better than the CD. I was wrong. It's almost worse. The constant slobbering and ""cha's, che's, cho's"" make it sound like he's under water some of the time.

Mr. Mayer has admitted that one of the things he'd like to change, is the way he presents himself on stage as far as mannerisms and so forth. He should have started before this show was recorded.

Reccomended for die-hard John Mayer fans only.",1158019200,7,711,4.419847328244275
1823814,5,B000083C7X,"I eagerly awaited the release of Any Given Thursday, because I am a big fan of John Mayer's and had seen him live in April 2002 (at a House of Blues) and again in August 2002, just 4 weeks before the concert recorded. My big decision was whether to buy the CD or the DVD.

The week they were released, I purchased the CD (and meanwhile my son purchased the DVD). In spite of John's great performance, I was disappointed in the CD. The crowd's noise is very distracting and it is painful to hear teenyboppers shreiking at inappropriate moments. They either picked the wrong venue to record or should have filtered out the crowd better. It convinced me not to see him live again. (I would NOT give the CD 5 stars!)

But eventually I had a chance to watch my son's DVD, and it was great. With the camera focused on John, you can focus on his songs and his performance -- which are perfect. The crowd is NOT a distraction on the DVD. So I bought the DVD too, and I've been very pleased with it. When I watch it, is almost like reliving the excitement of his live performance. Anyone who sees it becomes a fan.

I believe the DVD costs less than the CD too. It's a great value.",1111622400,,1172,4.223214285714286
1823815,5,B000083C7X,"John Mayer is an unassuming performer and awesome entertainer.  I have viewed this DVD several times and realize he is totally engrossed in what he does best and that is making music.  His guitar solos are reminiscent of great guitarists of the past and he shamelessly honors his favorites with notable riffs or complete cover songs.  He is a likeable fellow in his commentaries and his sense of humor on this collection lets the listener know he hasn't let any of his popularity go to his head.  He has the ability to poke fun at himself and in my opinion, he is living life right, by not taking things too seriously.  He makes a point to shed light on his band mate's abilities, when it would be really easy to keep the focus on himself.  He is not that way at all.  I'd be surprised if you do not emerge a huge John Mayer fan by giving your eyes and ears this musical treat any given Thursday or for that matter any day that ends in ""Y"".",1105315200,8,940,4.27683615819209
1823816,5,B000083C7X,"This DVD is a wonderful display of John Mayer's incredible talent and capacity. Not only does it display his great ability to entertain a live audience, the special features offer a glimpse of what he is like off stage. He is an incredible talent, this DVD is an essential for any John Mayer Fan!!!",1100044800,4,298,4.537037037037037
1823817,5,B000083C7X,"I'm an avid DVD concert collector. From certain forms of Jazz (Norah Jones to Harry Connick Jr) to Pop (you name it!) to Rap (Linkin' Park). I like music and enjoy watching and listening in general. But I have not experienced anything like this DVD. Take it for what it's worth... because tastes are very personal. Here goes...

I wasn't really a John Mayer fan. I've heard a few of his songs which piqued my interest. At the first viewing, I was half turned off and half amused by his unusual gyrations and facial expressions (like the others who have commented on the same thing). Just looking at his face, it seemed initially that he might have some sort of mental retardation. But since the music was great, I ended up listening to the DVD again... and again... and again! With each re-listening, I always noticed something new. And it is only with re-listening to the DVD that one will get the true essence of John Mayer. After a while, you see past those facial expressions and gyrations. To me now, its just like a pianist swaying back and forth with a slow tune or bobbing his/her head up and down with a fast one. You will notice those expressions/gyrations only occur when he is plucking or strumming out melodies and chords. His voice has great depth. I didn't and couldn't for the life of me make out the lyrics initially. But again they eventually ALL come out! And the lyrics themselves convey many things. So... from getting to know the singer through his monologues, voice and songs, to the wonderful and oftentimes soulful guitar playing (mostly very clean plucking and excellent strumming), to the wonderful overall performance and sound quality, I can't give this DVD anything but 5 stars!",1096588800,19,1708,4.693333333333333
1823818,5,B000083C7X,"If you're thinking about buying this DVD, I assume you've already heard John Mayer's music...therefore I'm not going to spend any time reviewing the music itself.

The quality of the Audio and Video is outstanding.  The audio is crisp; the video is top-notch and clear.  Other people have complained about audience noises, but I think they're forgetting that this is a DVD of LIVE music.  The audience sound levels, in my opinion, were not too high.  If you don't harp on it, you won't even notice the audience.

The special features were a nice suprise, especially for a low cost DVD.",1094256000,5,585,4.742574257425742
1823819,5,B000083C7X,"Since John has never and probably will never make it to a concert in my hometown of Honolulu, this DVD is the closest I'll get to hearing and seeing him live. His songs sound even more beautiful live and on stage. Because of all the screaming fans (though annoying), I felt like I was actually there. John's music is top notch and this DVD brings it to life.",1093392000,4,358,4.279411764705882
1823830,5,B000083C7X,"John's personality and love for music just shines in this dvd. Yea, he's performance isn't just like what you hear on teh cd, actually it's kind of breathy live. But it's just so much fun to watch him play and hear him play his music raw. Definately worth you money if you can't see him in concert.",1087257600,2,298,4.245614035087719

1823832,5,B000083C7X,"If you listen to the commentary--John talks about a woman calling him a one hit wonder, which he isn't.  His whole cd is a hit and he should of had more than 3 singles.  I would recommend this DVD to any true John Mayer fan.  I got it for my birthday and that was 3 months ago and I still watch it!  He is great in concert, but even better when you can watch him any time you want.",1067126400,,381,3.7848101265822787
1823833,1,B000083C7X,"After reading a few reviews I bought this DVD. Never again.
The picture is OK but the audio mix is NOT. The music was a very poor mix and the vocals were terrible. I could not understand what he was singing about.
As far as having to watch John eating his microphone, it made me feel sick. Why take so many close-ups of his mouth?
He is obviously very talented but has been sold short by the technical bods.
No more antiquated 4.3. Widescreen for all releases please.",1066953600,8,467,4.318181818181818
1823834,3,B000083C7X,"My dad bought this DVD for me, knowing that I'm a John Mayer fan, and he's kind of one too. Don't get me wrong, I love John Mayer and his music but... watching the DVD was too funny. His expressions when he sang, lol he looked like he was in pain! He sure can make weird shapes with his mouth. =P And as my dad puts it, ""he eats the microphone"" while he sings. My mom said you should just watch it from the neck down. (to watch his guitar playing) The music though, is awesome! I loved how he added parts to songs that we all know by heart. Keeps things more interesting, you know?
So all in all, I would recommend this to any John Mayer fan, or even if you're not one!",1065312000,3,669,3.962962962962963
1823835,5,B000083C7X,"I bought this DVD because I was unable to see in live in concert.  And believe me, this DVD allows the viewer to get an idea of what it's like to be at the concert.  It show's this young talent doing what he does best...working his guitar to get the most out of his music.  This DVD includes songs from his hit album ""Room For Squares"" but also includes songs that are from his independent album.
Another plus on this DVD is the special features which allows the viewer to go ""behind the scenes"" with John and see how he is when he's not on stage.  Overall a great item for any John Mayer fan!!!!",1065225600,,596,4.156521739130435
1823836,1,B000083C7X,"On the video side, there is absolutely NO reason release a 4x3 concert DVD.  That alone frustrated me, could not find a single description of the video formatting on the case, either.
As far as the audio, the kids in the thrash band a few houses down that shake the garage every weekend have better engineering skills than the rookies that mastered this train wreck.  I'm guessing their setup instructions were something like ""plug all the mikes on at the same level and step away for the rest of the concert"".  John has a wonderful voice when properly mixed, but here it turns to a garbled mess.  Absolutely no blending across the soundfield, every instrument and screaming fan seems like they were recorded in isolation with no thought as to how it would all come together.
I am a HUGE fan of Room for Squares, play it over and over.  Watching and listening to this trainwreck of a production makes me wonder if the real magic of his CDs is in the engineering rather than in the performance.",1064102400,3,993,4.556179775280899
1823837,5,B000083C7X,DVD blew me away with the bonus commentary track/interview material! You really get an even deeper appreciation for his work! And the music/singing is spectacular!!!!,1062806400,2,166,5.68
1823838,1,B000083C7X,"John Mayer is clearly a talented and passionate writer and singer, but he needs a new sound engineer. The crowd noise on this DVD is flawlessly reproduced, but the band and the vocals are terrible. I have a growing collection of music DVD's ... would much rather watch a concert for the tenth time than a movie. This one will sit on the shelf.",1059955200,2,343,4.375
1823839,5,B000083C7X,"If you're a John Mayer fan, than this DVD is an amazing investment. It contains so much live concert and displays so much of his talent- its amazing. It also contains Bonus Features, like the 'Morning After' segment. Its an interview with him inside of his hotel room, and it really gives you a better view of him as not only a musician- but as a down to earth person. You get to know him as a person (what sections of the newspaper he reads... what he likes about performing etc.)John is performing in CT on August 20, and I couldn't get tickets. This DVD allowed me to see what a great artist John is, and just how talented he is as a musician. It truly gives you the concert experience. If you're considering buying it- I say go for it! You won't be let down.",1058313600,2,762,4.226027397260274
1823840,4,B000083C7X,"Wow, this is a cool concert.  This guy is so relaxed and confident.  Quite a natural talent.  Lots of fun to watch.  The drummer is excellent but too skinny and geeky to carry the shaved-head look he's sportin'.
The DD5.1 sound mix is excellent.  Video quality is very good although I wish this and every other concert DVD was done in Widescreen 16:9 format.
Definitely a disc to keep.  Many repeat trips to my dvd player in the last 4 weeks.",1055980800,,442,4.395061728395062
1823841,5,B000083C7X,"In fact, john is a HUGE musician, he is a REAL great guitar player and cool with his fans too. Seeing that guy getting strange on a guitar solo is totally impressive (i.e Man on the side, or Covered in the rain) You have to see that DVD.
If you love clean guitars, lovely lyrics... go for it!",1054857600,2,292,4.051724137931035
1823842,5,B000083C7X,"I'm in awe of John Mayer... I especially like his performance of ""Covered in Rain"" in this DVD...it's 10 minutes long and it's worth listening to every second of it. He's so amazing and he plays the most beautiful songs I've heard in my life.",1052006400,,242,4.4
1823843,5,B000083C7X,"I would highly recommend ""Any Given Thursday"" to any John fan, or music fan for that matter.  In a world full of Britneys, with their elaborate sets and costume changes, it's very refreshing to watch and listen to John.  Clad in a t-shirt, guitar in hand, John delivers the best tracks off of his debut ""Room For Squares"", as well as a handful of extra (amazing) songs such as ""Man on the Side"" and ""Covered in Rain"".  In my opinion, John really shines live on stage.  I think nearly every song he plays far surpasses the studio version on his album, and it's fun to watch his boundless energy and crazy facial expressions.  What makes concert DVD's so nice is that you can watch the show all the way through, or jump right to the songs you want to listen to.  So whether you have 2 hours or 2 minutes, you'll have plenty to keep you entertained.  John's ""morning after"" interview is nothing too spectacular, but it's interesting to hear his reaction to the night before (and see how he reads USA Today- the boy's funny!).  This DVD is simply amazing; a great addition to anyone's collection.",1051833600,8,1092,4.50761421319797
1823844,5,B000083C7X,"I have become a big fan of buying concert DVDs as opposed to movie DVDs. Yes everyone should buy the 4 or 5 DVD version of Fellowship of the Ring because it is to date the masterpiece and standard for what DVD movie releases can be. But really how many times can you watch a movie? How many movies are even worth watching more then once? Isn't a good movie best seen in a theatre anyway?
Concert DVDs are a different story all together. They can be viewed multiple times, shared at friends' houses, used as background or foreground. They are by far the best value for your DVD money. And this DVD is one of the better concert DVDs I have seen. The track Covered in Rain is almost worth the price by itself, where John's musicianship really shines through. As a whole, this DVD displays his voice, guitar playing, his band, and his personality. There is enough just plain good music on display that you will hear something new every time you listen. If you have a halfway decent sound system, for sure by this DVD if you even like Mayer's music a little. If you like his music more then a little, no matter what sound system you have, this will be a fun acquisition. The extras are quite nice. I have yet to listen to the commentary but the interview was interesting and the photos are surprisingly well done. The photos are shown in slideshow presentation and are a combination of color and black and white. They are a lot of fun. For the price this is a great value that you will enjoy again and again. It is what DVD players where meant to play.",1050796800,19,1547,4.337931034482758

I had heard a lot of fans talk about how he's even better live, and I just couldn't believe them. It couldn't be possible. Ah, but it was. I recently bought this DVD and was absolutely blown away. My respect and admiration for his talent is through the roof. His performances are passionate and moving, and his amazing guitar playing and off the wall humour will make you a fan for life. The commentary and morning after interview are really great in letting you see John's captivating personality. Now, I'm a poor unemployed high school student, and yet after watching this DVD about 20 times and hating that I couldn't just pop it into my discman, I went ahead and bought the CDs as well. I can't get enough of this guy. He's just so amazing. Do yourself a favour and buy this DVD or pick up the CD. ...",1048377600,4,920,4.323699421965318
1823849,4,B000083C7X,"To watch the passion of a young artist like John Mayer in "" Any Given Thursday"" is truely an appreciation of music/ great song writing/ delivery/and pure enjoyment. Is there really a bad song on here....NO... but with all the great songs I still go back to listening to 83 and John talking about his previous life and his brother. This is not one for glitter and glitz on the stage although John does get animated at times which is a plus. And of course ""Your body is a Wonderland"" will go down as a all time favorite. I did not like his version of this on the Grammys but who am I to judge. I always have a few songs in the am as I go to work if I am not listening to talk radio that get me going and ""No Such Thing"" will always get you going.. There is no disappointment in this DVD and I highly recommend it for the pure pleasure.. I can't give a 5 because for me ""Hell Freezes Over"" to this day has set the current benchmark for me. If his career goes continues to go the way of a Don Henley in terms of a songwriter and delivery to ""passion"" for the delivery... look out.........",1047686400,2,1084,4.070093457943925
1823860,5,B000083C7X,"Absolutely amazing.  I've been a fan of John's since Inside Wants Out was released the FIRST time.  Unfortunately, every time he's playing a concert in Michigan, I'm out of the state.  Watching this DVD put me in the same state of awe that I felt the first time I heard Neon.  Awesome jam sessions and blistering, tasteful blues solos compliment his amazing songwriting skills.  If you've never had the opportunity to see John in concert, buy this DVD.  If you have, buy it anyways, it's the closest thing to being there (plus great extras like photogallery, soundcheck and morning after interview.)  Looks great, sounds better thanks to John Alagia.

I can't wait to share this with my friends who think this generation is void of music genious.

1823865,5,B000083C7X,"Boyish good looks go a long way, but its the ""from the heart"" performance and the buzz of the concert experience that carries John Mayer in his newly released concert DVD.  Filmed in Birmingham Alabama on his latest tour, the DVD captures all cool things that make for a great concert...  The cheering crowds, the kibbitzing between songs and of course JM's passionate, expressive and sometimes funky performance.  Mayer who is known for his introspective lyrics and whispery voice comes through loud and clear in a style that's uniquely his own, but has been often compared to Dave Matthews and Jack Johnson.  The DVD comes with bonus materials include a behind the scenes look at the concert, an interview with John and a collage of pictures put to his music.  This is a MUST OWN for JM fans who I'm sure are all too familiar with his studio recordings.  The renditions here carry far more punch and some fun and unexpected alternative lyrics.  For hardcore JM fans the audio commentary that runs through the concert gives an added insight to his quasi philosphical, regular guy life. JM fans will absolutely NOT BE DISAPPOINTED and the uninitiated may discover a new passion.",1045008000,10,1178,4.830845771144278

You have to have this if you are a Mayer fan!

It was one of the best shows that i have ever seen and I have been to a bunch.  Just imagine how excited i was when Guster blew the suprize and told us that it was being recorded for DVD.  I knew then that it was going to be a great show and that John would give it his all for us.  My ticket stubs will go along with the DVD just great, i can't wait to relive this magical night.  The concert was great the seats were great and the date was gorgeous,  how much more of a perfect night could i have had?
  John is great to listen to but there is nothing that can compare with being there as he puts on a wonderful show.  Pelham Alabama, the Oak Mountin AMP. is a wonderful outdoor venue and the temp was just right that day. Even though it did sprinkel a little there was no rain that could have ruined that show.  i can't wait to see the DVD and i cant wait to go to another one of his shows.

All the material is great, but it also contains what has become recognized as the best recorded version of the song Covered in Rain, which John points out in the bonus material, is an extension of City Love. The guitar work in Covered in Rain, which probably not as technically proficient as some of his later work, is still some of the most impassioned I've heard from him to date, and the fact that he has never released a studio version of the song is an added bonus.

This DVD is a great time capsule, showing John's early work as a bright and upcoming star, but before the fame had really had the chance to set in. I would submit that many people have a lot of life memories associated with the Room for Squares album, and this certainly hit all the high points, as well as some material from Inside Wants Out. If you are a John Mayer fan, there has been a lot of fantastic material in the years after this DVD, but this one is certainly a MUST HAVE to set the stage for what was to come.",1467504000,3,1041,4.205
