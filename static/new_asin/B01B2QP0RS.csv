8749152,1,B01B2QP0RS,This DVD says on the box it is for all regions but all my DVD players say Disc 1 is PAL and won't play on any of my DVD players...  Very annoyed!!  I can't believe they don't check these things before they sell them to specific regions.,1483833600,4,236,4.0
8749153,5,B01B2QP0RS,"This Karate DVD series is truly an amazing thing to watch.  Where else do you get a chance to watch Michael Milon a three time World Champion in  Kata, perform the various Kata of the Shotokan Karate style.  No body performed Kata better than he did, and what a treat it is to be able to watch this great performer move his body in such a beautiful and graceful manner while performing the katas.  Watching Michael perform the kata will greatly help anyone to learn to perform them to a much higher world class degree.  This DVD series does assume that the viewer is an experienced Karateka and is already very familiar with the kata of Shotokan Karate.  This DVD series is designed to take the experienced in kata and help him/her to elevate their performance to a much higher standard.",1473638400,3,787,4.546099290780142
