7828624,5,6302648696,"This is a fine piece of work with Hayley Mills in the starring role. The story is seen through the eyes of the child in the film.  Set in Africa, before it was settled by the English in the pre 1914 era, this is a fascinating story.  I will confess I did get a little bored during the first episode. It didn't take long before I was so hooked on it, I couldn't stop watching the 4 tape set.  This is the type of film that remains with you long after you have finished watching it.",1001808000,14,480,3.9791666666666665
7828625,5,6302648696,"I believe the first time I viewed this series, it was on the Disney channel.  Now one may watch the saga on tape.  It is set in Africa.  The Europeans struggle with clashes in culture with the Africans.  In the  strange new land Elspeth deals with living in a straw house and the local  tribes.",960768000,,294,4.254545454545455

It is enough to make one mad and hatefull, but Elspeth manages  with a positive outlook and a sense of humour.",960768000,2,406,4.25
7828628,5,6302648696,"When this mini-series aired on Masterpiece Theatre back in 1983, it captured my interest from the very start.  As a single parent, I could barely wait for Sunday evenings to roll around for the next episode, not  just to relax, but revel in the beauty of this story.  The candor with  which the historical events (both positive and negative) surrounding  Elspeth Huxley's early life in Africa is displayed is both refreshing and  heartwarming.  I wish every child could experience growing up in a world  such as little Elspeth did.  As a previous reviewer remarked, this story  was indelibly inscribed upon my mind and heart---I have never forgotten it  throughout the years, although I strain to remember other stories and  movies I have seen.  Even the haunting movie score comes to mind more often  than not.  Since that first viewing, I have borrowed it from my local  public library and I now plan to purchase the set for my personal video  library.  I highly recommend this movie--it is one you'll not soon forget!",946857600,76,1020,4.8313953488372094
7828629,5,6302648696,"I love this series, mainly for the memories it brings back. About 15 years ago, when I was around 10, our family would go to my grandmother's on Sunday evening, gathering around the TV to watch Masterpiece Theater at  8pm. This was the only series that we watched regurlarly until it was over.  It imprinted itself on my mind, and sent it soaring. I enjoy it now because  of this. I don't know that I would recommend it 100% to an adult - there  are a few weaknesses. But I would reccomend it for children. The story is  uplifting, adventurous, moral, exotic, everything that sends a child's mind  into its own fantastic dreamland.",939427200,12,631,4.539823008849558
