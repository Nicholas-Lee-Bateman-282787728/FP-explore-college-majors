Amon finally accepts Robin as his new partner, and we discover more about Michael, Sakaki, Karasuma, and Doujima.
In Belief, Robin begins to doubt her duty as a witch hunter. Especially after a witch's noble sacrifice in Faith, Robin begins to speculate where her future is headed. Her love for Amon becomes stronger, and she forms tighter bonds with the rest of the members of STN-J. Meanwhile, we are presented with the mysteries of Factory and Solomon.
This is really an intermission between the introductory Arrival and the stunning third DVD. Once episode 11 comes along, the series truly kicks off. Episode 12 reveals the true meaning of witches and witch hunters for Robin, while the episodes following lead up to the unexpected twist in Episode 15.
Either way, do not skip out on this. It includes some great music, characters, and action. And without it, you won't be able to fully appreciate the following episodes, which truly break away from this episodic structure.

8000117,4,B0000D9BEB,"I reviewed the first volume, and said that I was disappointed with this series. It's slow moving story and bland characters made it hard for me to get interested...and stay awake. I am a fan of good stories. Even though this anime has a slow paced vibe, it has a very serious story. The story is starting to get a bit better. I actually enjoyed volume 2 quite a bit more than volume 1. The characters have begun to develop a bit more, which is the key to an interesting series. So far, this anime isn't great, but there is potential. I am, however, still a bit disappointed. I'll keep watching and let you know how this show improves, or doesn't. At this point, I kind of think that it's a waste of money.",1360886400,,705,4.268656716417911
8000118,4,B0000D9BEB,"In this DVD there are five more episodes of the Witch Hunter Robin series and the first two are not really as strong as the other three.  I think that a lot more could of been done with the plot in 'Raindrops', because that is the kind of story that SHOULD of scared the living daylights out of me.  I hate dummies and puppets and toys that move on their own, yet this episode didn't even make me twitch.  And 'Simple Minds' was kind of lame.  Yet the last three episodes PLUS the overall artwork, great music and perfect voice work saved it all.  We get hints, in the last few episodes on the DVD, of something greater happening in the background.
Oh, and in episode eight the Witch-Healer's English voice is that of Steven Jay Blum (Spike from Cowboy Bebop and Roger Smith from The Big II)which increased my enjoyment of watching that episode.  Of course, Wendee Lee and Crispin Freeman do a smashing job with their character's voices.
Few extras, just some files and notes, but the second Witch Hunter Robin DVD had five episodes (like the first one) and that more than makes up for the lack.  I would suggest getting it used.",1080864000,3,1129,4.451456310679611
8000119,4,B0000D9BEB,"This is the second volume of the Japanese Cult Hit Witch Hunter Robin based on the story of a 15 year old girl named Robin who originally was born Japan and then raised in Italy.
Because of her special powers she is sent back to Japan to become a Witch Hunter.
This DVD contains episodes 5 thru 10, and also has both the opening and closing sequences from the show, which is currently being aired on the Cartoon Networks Adult Swim in March of 2004.
The added treat of this DVD is that you get the full and clean open and closing from the series of which only part of the original closing actually airs on AdultSwim. The opening does not even air at all.
Scene selection is easy for this DVD and as is selecting the language version you want to hear. The opening and closing songs are transscribed and this series may be unsettling for young viewers, recommend age for viewing is 15 +.",1078272000,5,885,4.337349397590361
8000120,3,B0000D9BEB,"The art and animation are top notch. There are a few annoying re-uses of animation (a la He-Man rolling around on the ground 500 times an episode) but they are done at the conference table, are attractive, and are forgiveable. Besides that everything is beautiful, smooth, and of the callibur you'd expect in a movie, not syndicated television show.
I am a little preplexed by the earlier volume's score. The music is very well done and atmospheric and looking at the OST's, it appears there were a lot of tracks written. However...and this is a big however...the first two volumes of Robin only seem to be using a few of these tracks...over...and over...and over again. It's a shame. The lack of variety is killing the mood because it's almost comical how many times you'll here the same musical piece in just one episode alone. Sometimes to the point that they are literally back-to-back.
All this, again, is forgivable. So why the lower rating? The story and characters seem so flat and watered down that this show almost becomes unwatchable at times. The plot meanders on with little insight as to why people are doing what...and the characters seem carbon molds of dull lifeless puppets. There is no wit, no suspense, no tension, just....blah. This is part in due to the *horrible* dialogue. It's not a translation problem. The translation is pretty good. It's just *really* bad dialogue. You've seen it before: ""Robin? Huh? Ohhhhhhh. Huh? Ohhhhhh? Ok."" with nice loooooooong pauses in between people speaking.
Having said all this...it is quite possible that the series will pick up from its snail pace...and that the characters actually develop into non-puppet form...but at full DVD price a pop...and a couple more volumes to go...I would recommend waiting until the series ends to invest in buying it.",1075075200,7,1810,4.957236842105263
8000121,5,B0000D9BEB,"This is the second DVD in a series that is proving to be much better than my initial expectations.  'Hunter' drama story lines tend to be violent and hyper heroic, and thus far, Witch Hunter Robin is proving to be the antithesis of that style.  Set in modern Japan, it is the story of the STNJ, a small group of young people who hunt those with paranormal powers.  Since they have powers of their own this puts them in an equivocal position.
Rather than focus on violent resolutions, the story focuses on the personal interplay of young Robin Sena and the rest of the team.  She is a young practitioner of the Craft who has recently returned from Italy to serve as a hunter, and has yet to become completely comfortable in a team of strangers whose leaders seem to have a hidden agenda.
How this will play out is still unclear, but a gradual change in the depiction of the offending witches has become apparent.  This series begins to play up the humanity of all the characters, not just the team.  I think it is fairly clear that something in the STNJ organization is not quite right.  Captured witches are shipped off to some kind of vague processing center whose purposes are unclear.
The episodes in this series range from the poignant story of a witch who uses dolls for her primary to the tragedy of a doctor who finds he can save lives by killing.  In a haunting episode that touches on the impact of these powers on family relationships, we learn much about Yuji Kobari, the bar owner, who has been a bit of a mystery so far.
All the tales are told with a very light touch, and deliberately intended to leave mixed feelings in the viewer.  Thus the story has complex overtones that play well against the sparse stylishness of the settings and animation.  On many occasions, very dramatic effects are achieved by a curious minimalism that demonstrates that good taste can be a strong a creative device.",1071878400,9,1909,4.539358600583091
