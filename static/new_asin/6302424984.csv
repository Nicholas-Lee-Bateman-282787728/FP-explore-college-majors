Only let down is there's no catillac cats storyline involved in this film.",1503187200,,148,4.137931034482759
7826395,1,6302424984,"Don't get me wrong, I love Heathcliff. I spent many an afternoon watching ""Heathcliff & the Catillac Cats"" on either one of my local channels or Nickelodeon during the 1980's. I happened to catch this ""movie"" during a Disney Channel preview, and, not having seen the beginning and winding up walking in during the middle of it, though ""wait a minute, since when does Disney air Heathcliff?"" Then I found out this was a movie. You call this a movie?! It's nothing but a glorified clip show! Come on, a movie is NOT random episodes of a TV show mixed together! What, were they too cheap to make a REAL Heathcliff movie? I think the only saving grace of this movie is the fact that it's Mel Blanc (a voice-over legend, imnsho) voicing Heathcliff.",1424044800,,743,4.552238805970149
7826396,4,6302424984,"Heathcliff used to air every morning at 7:30 on the local FOX station back in the mid '80s...afterward it was moved to Nickelodeon and shortly afterward it was off the air. The cartoon has always been compared to Garfield. The animation style is nearly the same...it looks nothing like a typical cartoon. The Rugrats and Inspector Gadget were also done in this animation style. anyway, this 1986 movie combines several short stories recalled by Heathcliff as he's trying to keep his 3 nephews occupied and out of trouble. The segment of the movie i liked is the ""Catfather"". Unlike the TV series {the movie uses the same theme song and opening sequence by the way} this movie doesn't feature Riff-Raff, Clio, or the dog LeRoy...but the three Alley Cats are here: Hector, Wordsworth, and Mungo. there's another story i liked that deals with Heathcliff and his criminal father. i bought this because of Mel Blanc...if you've read any of my other reviews then you know how much a fan i am of Mel Blanc {in addition to Daws Butler, Don Messick, and Stan Freberg}. anyway, i didn't have anything on Mel that dealt with Heathcliff and so i bought this video. i love it of course. i give it 4 stars because it's a compilation. i would've loved a full-length original movie instead of 6 or 7 short-stories from the original TV series wrapped around the new footage of Heathcliff talking to his nephews about his past which is what we have here.",1086998400,,1436,4.679841897233201
7826397,2,6302424984,"I am a big time movie buff; a good animated movie is hard to come by these days, but I look forward to them.  However, this is not what I call, ""good entertainment.""  The Heathcliff cartoon was the best with Iggy and Grandpa Nutmeg, and Mongo, and who could forget that opening song....""Heathcliff, Heathcliff, no one should...tearing by the neighborhood...""  Anyway, all this movie is - is three of THE ABSOLUTE WORST Heathcliff cartoons combined, with Heathcliff sitting around torturing his nephews one rainy afternoon.  I mean, c'mon, man, at least they could've found three better episodes to pack into this 70 minute piece of garbage...",1006300800,2,642,5.028301886792453
