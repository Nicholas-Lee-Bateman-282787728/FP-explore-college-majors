7957105,2,B00005YUN1,"I like the Cheaters TV show and knew I would like it without all the editing, so, I quickly purchased this product.  I assume I should have looked closer,but,I thought I was getting a mulitiple disk set and I got only one disk with two episodes on it...that was it.  Two episodes.  I was disappointed especially since I paid in excess of $27.00 including the shipping.  I won't buy anymore unless I am sure I am getting my moneys worth.",1212019200,4,436,4.4125
7957106,5,B00005YUN1,"Tommy Grand host the show ""Cheaters"" that always be's in Dallas, Texas. It comes on every Saturday night on the WB. They have private I's spy on their cheating move then the person that calls Cheaters get shown the tape after that they be ready to confront their cheating spouse I do hate it when the women always hitting the men and the guys don't want to fight back at the woman that hit him. Cheathers security needs to protect the guys too. I also hate it when sometimes they cover the suspect idenity whats the point in that.",1124236800,,530,4.363636363636363

The immortal words of Thomas Jefferson hold new meaning when applied to the concept of Reality Television.
If you think your significant other is experimenting with infidelity, get ""Cheaters"" on the case. They'll track the allegedly guilty party, collecting videotaped and voice-recorded evidence to support your theory. They'll present the cold, hard truth to you on camera, catching the crestfallen expression on your face...so your betrayer can see the pain they've caused (provided they watch the show).
Your vigilant effort will be rewarded when Tommy Grand or Joey Greco help you confront the man/woman who broke your heart, often in the company of their illicit paramour!
This DVD presents the best cases from ""Cheaters,"" but with never-before-seen material (mostly involving naked people). If you get this hoping for a voyeuristic thrill of sex caught on tape, you'll probably be disappointed. The real value of this DVD is the preservation of a television show upholding the ideals of our great United States: freedom, honor, and the pimp-slap.
Vigilance, indeed.",1056412800,3,1117,5.388571428571429
7957109,4,B00005YUN1,"Like a mixture of Jerry Springer and Candid Camera - Cheaters made me happy to own a television when it premiered in 2000. A classic show that chronicles what must be the wort moment of someone's life. If you like watching people put in uncomfortable situations like being busted cheating on a spouse - and you think that watching someone having to watch a tape of their boyfriend having sex with another girl - then this is the tape for you. However, many people I know just find the show and the whole idea behind it distasteful. While I'm a fan of the show, I think that this DVD may go a bit too far, it becomes pornographic at some points and even slightly disturbing. But if you really enjoy reveling in the pain of others, then this DVD is guaranteed to please.",1028678400,,768,4.3776223776223775
7957110,5,B00005YUN1,"As the title says I was just thinking about asking them to release an uncensored version of Cheaters. I get a real kick out of the show every week and think its one of the funniest shows on tv. I know, the people that are being cheated on won't feel the same way. But there's just something that gives me a little chuckle when I see the look on someone's face that has been busted. Now I get to see the parts that are normally blured out so I can get the complete picture. I hope they keep coming. I know there are some episodes that I really want to see uncensored.",1017619200,,566,4.0625
7957111,5,B00005YUN1,"I cried for exactly nine days after viewing this emotional roller-coaster.  Tommy Grand is nothing short of genius for the manner in which he tackles this modern day plague. That plague, ""cheating"".",1016582400,,198,5.1875
7957112,4,B00005YUN1,"I like the TV show so when I found out it was on DVD, I was quite surprised.  I picked up a copy (who could refuse when it's such a good price) and laughed my [head] off!  I have to use the pause button quite a bit `cause it has some foxy ladies running around quite nekkid, huge boobage- me likes!  The extras are ok, you can hear the entire song that is played at the beginning of the show.  There's also some pointers you can use to catch someone who might be cheating on you - nothing fancy.  I have been burned by more expensive DVDs that don't deliver, this one packs a punch and a peep!  Go for it!",1014768000,4,605,3.958677685950413
