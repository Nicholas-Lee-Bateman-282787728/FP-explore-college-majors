7988357,5,B00008ZZ7F,"is the story of how mankind went from scavenging to becoming true hunters.  We start off with Homo ergaster/Homo erectus who developed stone weapons and tamed fire.  We than move on to Neanderthals who use spears with stone tips and can take down such large animals as Giant Steppe Bison.  The final development is Cro-Magnons with bone tipped throwing spears and water-proof clothing.  The whole story is about 49 minutes and the narrator for much of the story is Linda Hunt.  Get it?
Between some of the scenes are 'How We Know What We Know', narratored by John Slattery, a mixture of a visible timeline, some data on early hunters and information on how scientists figured out how early man lived.  While this segmentis sometimes last less than a minute long they help greatly in putting everything together.
While the Discovery Channel did a great job with this episode of 'Before We Ruled The Earth' the DVD is somewhat bland.  No extras at all.",1073606400,12,950,4.7560975609756095
