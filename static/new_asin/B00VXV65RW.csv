7113746,4,B00VXV65RW,"The Knick--short for the Knickerbocker Hospital--is a soap opera capitalizing on the practice of medicine, particularly surgery, in 1900.  Clive Owen steals every scene as Dr. Thackery, the Physician Chief of Staff.  Dr. Thackery is a flawed genius, who creates significant advances in surgical procedures but out of a need to feed his ego rather than from more altruistic motives.  The supporting cast is excellent, and the story moves along briskly, with themes of racial tension, class division, wealth and poverty, and addiction.  I found the medical discussions and work on procedures fascinating.  People such as Dr. Halstead, for example, famous in medical circles for the Halstead procedure, are scattered through the various chapters.
Here comes the ""but"".  Those who don't have some medical background may find the graphic, bloody procedures a bit much.  I had to close my own eyes at times, and I'm a physician.  The addiction theme tends to take over the final 3 or 4 episodes, and  it's telegraphed long before that.
So, in summary:  great acting, fine supporting cast, characters are fleshed out well.  Not for the squeamish and definitely not for people under age.",1439424000,6,1179,5.152631578947369
7113747,5,B00VXV65RW,Very interesting show.  It gives you a unique perspective about the early practice of medicine.  The cast is great also.. It is a must watch,1439251200,,140,4.56
7113748,5,B00VXV65RW,What the WHAT!!! Best show ever!!,1439164800,,33,4.666666666666667

7113750,5,B00VXV65RW,"I loved the 1st. season of The Knick and am looking forward to the 2nd. If anyone loved House you will surely enjoy this. I felt the dialoge and the acting was far superior to House. Clive Owen is always incredible, but this maybe him at his best and the rest of the cast (actors that I am not familiar with) captured my interest. All unlikeable at times empathetic and appreciated at others. As I am a RN, I am so familiar with the earlier history of my profession but was oblivious about the 1900's. AMAZING!!!!!",1438905600,8,514,4.364583333333333
7113751,5,B00VXV65RW,"Excellent series! I love Clive Owen anyway, but he is brilliant in The Knick! I would recommend this to anyone that wants to watch TV at it's finest.",1438128000,,149,4.357142857142857
7113752,5,B00VXV65RW,"One of the best series I've ever watched on cable , Intense  lifelike drama  that will turn you in circles. The directing , cinematography, acting , writing,music & plot are all top notch .I didn't get anywhere near a Hollywood  cliched moment until about the 7th or 8th episode. Totally unpredictable and extremely raw. They captured the  era at the turn of the century remarkably. Just fascinating but not for the meek . If you don't like blood you will have a tough time, but I highly recommend you try and get thru it.  Just turn your head ,first episode particularly because the rest of the movie will suck you in a  wild circle of phenomenal writing and acting , I watched the first four four episodes in one sitting. Like a book you can't put down and don't want it to end. My only complaint is my utter disappointment when it came to the season finale & I found out I had to wait until Early 2016 for the next Season ! Torture ! Clive Owens is simply remarkable as Chief Surgeon and worthy of a Golden Globe as is Dr Edwards his black assistant  and Nurse Lucy Elkins (Eve Hewson) who gives nothing short of an extraordinary performance & amazing ingenuity. Must see TV",1437955200,20,1177,4.421296296296297
7113753,5,B00VXV65RW,What an amazing show. This drama is amazing! I hope and pray they add more seasons. I am hooked. Great period series. If you like the truth about addiction and medical dramas this show is for you!! It's simply brilliant!!,1521849600,,221,4.55

7113755,5,B00VXV65RW,"There's a lot of good shows to watch now days. To many. This show is definetley In the top 2 percent. I was up until 5am watching this show. I could not turn away. Clive Owen has done some very good work in the past, but this is by far the best thing I've seen him star in. The surgeries are very graphic and real looking. It also gives you a perspective on what has led up to modern medicine.  Not to mention the very intriguing plot twists and the sheer entertainment of it all. I know this sounds bad, but the more Dr. Thackery gets strung out on coke the better the show gets. I'm very disappointed Cinemax canceled this show, and to make room for what? Soft porn and unrealistic, violent action shows? What a waste. Cinemax could have raised the bar for themselves with this show. Instead and as usual they choose to lower it.",1519948800,,831,4.2594936708860756
7113756,2,B00VXV65RW,I'm a fan of all these actors all tho I couldn't get in to it,1519862400,,61,3.1333333333333333
7113757,2,B00VXV65RW,"Why do left wingers have to ruin everything? When the character in episode 4 talks about ""San Francisco being more Progressive than NYC"" I threw up in the back of my mouth. First off, the era's most noted Progressive - Woodrow Wilson - was a virulent anti-black racist. As were many Progressives. The entire idea of eugenics was running rife through the Progressive movement, including Margaret Sanger wanting to stop blacks from reproducing. To posit that the Progressive movement was not racist is to announce you know nothing of its history.

As far as San Francisco being some redoubt of equality, it was also the hub for the importation of hundreds of thousands of Chinese ""coolies"", indentured and treated worse than African slaves. Some Progressives, lol. The virulent nature of the anti-Chinese laws and racism of myriad sorts in San Francisco is available to anyone with a simple Google search. Apparently the writers on this show don't have access to Google...

I can't stand the constant propaganda being shoved at me in every show now. It's not that racism is portrayed in this show - it's that every white male character is loathesome or pathetic. The only honorable character so far is Algernon. The acting is phenomenal, it's really too bad. Why do leftists have to infect everything with their politics?",1516233600,,1319,4.963800904977376
7113758,5,B00VXV65RW,"I was working as a tech in Brooklyn, NY when Cinemax released this series. On the subway ride to and from work, I'd see the posters on the wall. The same one that is the thumbnail here on Amazon. I had no interest in seeing the series even though Clive Owen was dead center. Whereas this show is extremely well written, and tells a story of New York City, that goes far beyond 'Gangs of New York' and other films. You'll see it yourself when one character worries about being late for her shift, and when Neely gets a visitor in her room, that this show is amazingly well-written. The nun and the ambulance driver are huge comedic relief in what is a truly dark tale of how the world used to work. Although not as dated and formal as 'Deadwood' the dialogue is superb, especially when spoken by the Irish characters. This is eye-opening and immersive television. It's also good therapy for the times in which we now live.",1515456000,,921,4.423529411764706
7113759,4,B00VXV65RW,"This is a good show with a fascinating setting.  A few aspects of it annoy me, though.  First, the anachronisms.  For instance,  to ""have sex"" wasn't used to mean to ""make love,"" etc. until 1929, so it's jarring that the characters keep using it in that sense. Second--and related--why do shows have to have *all* the main characters pair up as romantic partners?",1514592000,,363,4.714285714285714
7113760,5,B00VXV65RW,This is a great show lets you see how things in hospitals where in the past  . Great acting fun to watch,1514592000,,104,3.727272727272727

It is definitely a historical (medical) drama that is trying to say as much about America c. 1900 as it is about medicine at that time. The actors, sets, costumes, etc. are beautiful and exciting to watch in a oh-no-s/he-didn't sort of way.

The only aspect of the series that helped it hobble along the edges of obscurity instead of falling mercifully into an abyss was the super-smart and skillful black doctor who set up his own mini-surgery center in the basement of the hospital to help poor blacks who could get care no where else.

It is obviously very carefully researched and as far as I know incredibly accurate in all the details.  It also will make you very glad you did not live in that era, especially if you have ever had any kind of serious medical condition, and reminds you how far we've come. Beyond the histoircal detail, there are also great storylines and wonderful actors. Both male and female characters are dimensional, meaning human and flawed as well as often incredibly courageous and strong.

7113830,4,B00VXV65RW,"Enjoyed watching the Knick I think you could develop the characters a bit more. Exhibiting the good and evil in all. This will keep the audience involved as the outcomes will not be as predictable. Example the ambulance driver and the nun. He clearly cares for her, expand on that relationship. Get inside the characters heads and tell the story we don't see. What their thought processes are. How they view themselves and where they see themselves fitting in. I would love to see the nurse that's been beat by her father, hit him back perhaps with a fire poker and he dies, then Thackery unknowing performs a science experiment on him. The nurse finds out falls off the deep end and the doctor that original liked her comes and saves her or the other tall doctor could save her.. That may seem unthinkable in those times. However, it would be unexpected.",1454976000,,855,4.631578947368421

Daniel Day Lewis is great as the doctor and the show is so nuanced and fleshed out that the hospital itself feels like a character in the show. There are so many subplots that you would think they would eventually get in the way of each other, but they don't.

7113859,4,B00VXV65RW,"The Knick, as in the mythical Knickerbocker Hospital in a poor district in New York City is a series originally produced by Cinemax with Steven Soderbergh and Clive Owen directing.  This is not for the faint hearted because there are very few good outcomes and happy endings in these stories.  This is medicine and surgery practiced in the early 1900s.  Many of the characters are based on real life doctors and surgeons like William Halsted who was a pioneer in many surgical procedures as well as asepsis.  Halsted had one big flaw----he was a drug addict.  The main character John Thackery appears to be patterned after this individual.

Dr. Thackery is brilliant and continues to strive as the chief of surgery at this hospital that competes with more well known and affluent beacons of care in New York, like Cornell and others that  are located ""uptown.""  His accession to the job was by default as the previous chief of surgery has died under tragic circumstances.  The doctors are under stress as they try to save countless patients that have already suffered complications beyond repair.  They are rarely successful and it takes its toll on the medical staff as they try to figure out what goes wrong and why so many don't survive the procedures.

On the administrative side of running the hospital and relying not just on wealthy donors but also currying favors is Mr. Barrow, the Superintendent.  This is also around the whole corruption environment of New York City with officials and cops on the take.  There are also shady characters who are Mafiosi types running brothels, opium dens, and also are sought out as resources.  There is a lot of money changing hands and it all isn't going for the benefit of poor patients.  Palms are greased, and the benefits are often reaped by those that intend to profit----Barrow is no exception.

Then there are the Robertsons, big donors to the Knick.  The family consists of a wealthy businessman and his daughter Cornelia.  Cornelia is involved in the day to day activities of the hospital and  in representing the family interest also has a lot of say in how the place should be managed and who the prime players should be.  She insists that  the assistant to Dr. Thackery will be Dr. Algernon Edwards-----a very talented surgeon who has studied at Harvard and gotten medical qualifications abroad.  He also happens to be black and initially is spurned by Dr. Thackery.

There is a lot going on in the ten episodes in this series.  There is competition among doctors not just at the Knick but throughout the city as they try to best each other on techniques, new inventions, and who is the most brilliant.  There are many social issues as well-----especially concerning Dr. Edwards, the lone black guy who has to prove himself over and over.  In his case, he also has a connection to the Robertsons and eventually it becomes too close and brings much heartache.

The scenes in surgery and throughout the hospital are very realistic and graphic.  It's definitely not for the quesy sort---there's a lot of blood shed here!  Some of the scenes such as in the mental hospital seemed unbelievable but when one goes on-line and looks them up it's found to be true.  There's a lot of tragic happenings in this show and a lot of deaths.  Not too many happy endings or good results.  It's life in the medical world of the early twentieth century----but it was part of a revolution and a good start!",1452211200,2,3444,4.745791245791246

Steven Soderbergh pretty much shoots it entirely by hand, and himself. So the look of it is unlike anything you might have seen.  The depiction of turn of the century NY is gritty and believable.  You get a real feeling for what it must have been like.  The issues they deal with as a hospital, such as installing electricity for the first time, are fascinating. I have read that the medical procedures, especially the surgeries, are historically accurate and it is illuminating to realize how strong minded and brave these surgical pioneers must have been to keep at it despite grim mortality rates.

I must say, the surgeries are gruesome, and to think, many a times, they were experimenting on the patient in the very theatre!
The theatre was the operating room while people sat in a theatre-type setting observing the operations as they were being performed.

But the period is more than a gimmick.  The state of surgical medicine practiced at the dawn of the20th century is almost a character in itself.  Its demands and failures and the lowly status of surgery are a running theme.  Hopefully, the details have been thoroughly researched.  It certainly feels like it.  One historical historical practice I know to be true, although I don't know if it was still practiced in 1900, was the operating ""theater"", well named since it required from the surgeons some performance skills along with medical expertise.

Supporting actors are superb, the story lines support the actors, and throughout you are alternately shocked or intrigued by life in the 18th century New York.

7113946,5,B00VXV65RW,"What a rich series. It puts you front and center in the early 20th century of medicine, at a time in which what is view as ""ultra-modern"" appears barbaric to us. Clive Owen gives a wonderfully nuanced performance, arrogant  and oblivious and fallible and human at the same time. The racism is depicted very realistically (at least, it seems to me). You get wrapped up in the characters and the story. I binge watched most of Season One.",1446508800,,436,4.589743589743589

The lighting and costumes, as well as the sets look completely authentic and not at all campy as is the case with most historical dramas. As a health care provider, I find the whole accuracy of the medical procedures and treatments fascinating. For those of you who think that it's too graphic....... they have actually toned it down from reality. Also the portrayal of racism and xenophobia is dead on accurate.

7113961,3,B00VXV65RW,"I like this a lot--the actors and art are fine.  But like all medical dramas the set designers were paying more attention then the guys tasked with proofing the medical details.
I watched one episode of ""House.""  It involved a woman who was mysteriously bleeding to death. On day three of her admission, her PT/PTT came back showing her dramatic bleeding defect blah, blah, blah.  Unfortunately, her PT/PTT would have been back 15 minutes after her admission and I had to turn the TV off.  These are not trifling details.
""The Knick"" suffers from similar incredible medical gaffes which could have been made good without the plot suffering a bit.  I don't know whether it's the medical advisers who are goofing off or whether the director says, ""Hey, you know what would be better...?""  But it's a pity.  I think even lay people realize you can't bleed to death from an inguinal hernia reopening (unless Dr Edwards pioneering new procedure involved grafting in the femoral artery in which case no wonder he had to leave Europe).  And they were packing hemorrhaging wounds and holding pressure even in Paris where he trained.  And why they needed to bring in a laundress to sew with him is just absurd.  Have you seen the light? Have you seen the size of the wound?  ""Just sew everything you see bleeding."" Ahhhhhhh!  Have you seen any of the nurses upstairs doing procedures?  Nurses at the time were not even trained routinely to give IV injections (another gaffe) let alone assist at surgery.",1446163200,,1494,4.766536964980545

7113963,5,B00VXV65RW,"Superbly written, brilliant performances, and well worth the excursion into a technologically more primitive time. The series shows that people were the same then as now, and that class, race, corruption, irony, and cynicism are the same factors then as now. Nothing pedestrian about this series, and its richness deserves the multiple viewings you will undertake. Some of the surgery scenes are bluntly raw, but ther are done in a context where humanness is accentuated.",1446076800,,471,5.293333333333333

It's interesting to see a time where absolutely nobody lived who went to the hospital and there wasn't a rosy ending to every episode, rather the contrary. Having a daniel day lewis like rough main character who really struggles in his role as a person shows the challenges of the times. I think we like to almost sexualize our nostalgia for the good old days, and a window into a hospital before vaccines, cpr, transfusions, ekg's, x rays and IV's is a massive reality check to that. I'll take a modern hospital any day over this racist charnal house. In general, showing the true texture of history and why we are where we are today comes through clearly as a bell.

7114042,5,B00VXV65RW,"Can not wait for season 2.  Historically correct in most aspects of the medical system.  There were different hospitals for Irish, Germans, English and Americans.  Clive Owen gives a great performance.  Nurse Lucy is amazing.  As a nurse I can not image wearing that uniform.  Wearing scrubs is bad enough but to wear a long dress with an apron.  The cocaine addiction is historically accurate.  It was not until the Harrison Act that you could no longer buy cocaine and heroin over the counter without a prescription.  The operating room scenes are also accurate historically.  Gloves were not used until Goodyear came up with them.  Lister was sprayed over the surgical theater.  Bayer was manufacturing Heroin as a cure all including for teething for children.  They did pull psychiatric patients teeth as they felt that the teeth were the reason for ""madness"" and they also removed the tonsils.  Some of the audience may not believe all of this but it is true",1442361600,8,963,4.864197530864198

The British series ""London Hospital"" [in Britain called ""Casualty 1906,"" Casualty 1907,"" and ""Casualty 1909...ten episodes in all, and stream-able on Amazon] is far superior in every way:  Better and subtler writing and far better acting,  It is much more of an ensemble piece and the women characters/actors are far more compelling and skillfully drawn.  The blood and guts aspects are much less gratuitous.

7114055,4,B00VXV65RW,"I found the series  highly entertaining. However, it's certainly not for everyone. It's quite raw and graphic.  Set around the turn of the 20th century in a struggling  NYC hospital, The Knickbacher, ""Knick.""  The cinematography is amazing, esp. the architecture and costumes. The writing and direction are also excellent.  Admittedly, it's not ""easy"" to watch at times. As a RN, I found myself glancing away on more than one occasion during some rather gruesome, barbaric surgical scenes.

Clive Owens is mesmerizing as the brilliant, cocaine addicted Dr. Thacher.  His character has strong similarities to ""House M.D."" He's egotistical, condescending, well known in the medical community for his cutting edge brilliance, yet, excluded from more reputable teaching hospitals as Cornell & Bellevue.  He becomes ""chief of surgery"" during the first episode after his mentor, Dr. Christiansen commits suicide after 12 failed experimental ""C-sections."" In fact, the opening scene featuring Dr. ""Thach"" in the surgical auditorium sets the general rapid pace, dark undertones of the series.

Given the era, I understand the stereotypical racial issues, crass language & elitist, privileged upper class petty problems compared to the vast poverty featuring various immigrant backgrounds. I was somewhat surprised most featured characters were portrayed  for their controversial  ""unlikable"" qualities. Perhaps, this was the producers' intent, creating a more ""soap opera"" type series. IMO, it didn't seem fitting for the era or what I imagined the era ""as"" historically.

Overall, I found the series quite compelling for two major reasons. 1. comparing the medical era during 1900 to the present not only captured my amazement how far medicine advanced over one century, but, speculated in another 100 yrs. how the present medical advances would be perceived, ""then."" 2. Clive Owen's performance literally carries the show.  This series is definitely not for children nor is it suitable for every adult.",1441497600,12,1996,5.526315789473684

I think the grittiness of it is realistic to the period as are the societal norms that the stories highlight. I enjoy it, but I could not binge watch it--it is a little too dark for that. The darkness and the lack of dimension of the female characters would be my only complaint, although even those would not keep me from continuing to watch. It is kind of Greek tragedy set in turn of the century New York and you cannot help but want to know more.",1440374400,4,520,4.262626262626263

7114074,3,B00VXV65RW,"Season 1 of The Knick is all about the fantastic-looking art direction, the gory surgery scenes, and the fabulous Clive Owen. Especially the last. But even with him in the lead, it's pretty much just another classy-looking TV period costumer, like any number of recent ones. The rest of the cast are mostly TV-level actors, some okay, some not so good, most forgettable and interchangeable. The story lines are slow and draggy, the dialogue sometimes stiff and trying too hard to sound authentic to the early 1900s in the mouths of 21st-century actors. Except, again, for Owen, who so completely inhabits his character and the time period he makes it look easy. It's fine as TV costumers go, but nothing really new or exciting.",1439769600,7,727,4.870967741935484
7114075,4,B00VXV65RW,"Not a huge fan of the era and limitations placed on those of color, however, the premise of the show was reminiscent of so many OTHER dysfunctional doctor shows (I would name them, but we've all seen them). This one just takes the dysfunctional doctoring of House and Mandy Patimkin into another era. Clive Owen cast as the lead role, is a coup and I enjoy watching him on the screen. Casting in general was very well done, even the 'newbies' on the show. The cast seems to work seamlessly onscreen. The writing is okay, maybe not original because as I said there have been ALOT of portrayals of dysfunctional doctors (Robson Greene-Wire in the Blood), but I give it 4 stars for portraying the era in all of its barbaric glory (not sure that it was so barbaric - mining through the intestines of a pregnant lady to save her unborn child and then leaving her open and revealed for all to see??). Costuming very well done, direction gets a nod too as I'm sure it is hard to recreate successfully another era within this modern age. Will see more of this show.",1439769600,3,1057,4.453608247422681
7114076,4,B00VXV65RW,"I can't give this a bad review but I also have to admit that I eventually gave up on it. You may do the same if you have some of the same issues I have. If not, this may be five stars for you.

First problem: Clive Owen's doctor character has a drug addiction. This problem begins to take over the episodes. This happened for one season of ""House"" and I almost gave up on that show because of it. I know drug addiction is bad but as a 66 year old person I don't need that hammered home to me constantly.

Second problem: The surgeries in here are absolutely grisly. Medical practices compared to the ones we have today are downright barbaric. I am not usually squeamish but people are lost under hideous surgeries. I am so glad I did not live then. No wonder life spans were so short. ""House"" was antiseptically modern, clean and ""state of the art"" in comparison. If you actually like grisly surgeries though, this show will appeal to you.

These are my two objections. As to what is right: Clive Owen is always a wonderful actor. I have never seen him in anything where he wasn't great. He is the Number One asset of the show. If you need a Clive Owen ""fix"", you will probably love the show. The writing and direction are also quite good. If you can get past my two objections, then you probably have a good viewing experience ahead of you.",1439769600,22,1341,4.292490118577075

7114079,3,B00VXV65RW,"But as much as I adore Clive Owen and well-done period pieces, I'm not going beyond two episodes. It's the hackneyed drug addiction that bothers me.  No moral objection, it's just too much of the plot. There is too much stereotyping in several aspects including the Irish workers. This show is well done historically and is visually appealing. It is in many respects right up there with some of the BBC classics, but the plotting and acting (other than Owen) are mediocre. It's a nice history of medicine primer if you aren't aware of the last 100 or so years, but that's not the case for me.",1439596800,6,592,4.5327102803738315
