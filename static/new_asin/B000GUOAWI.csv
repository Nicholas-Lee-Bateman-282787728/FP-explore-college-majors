2619935,2,B000GUOAWI,"As someone who doesn't have a CLUE about the Bible, I thought such a title would be a good start and I love Joyce Meyer. I figure just buying a Bible, a lot would go over my head. I know JM has a Theological degree and clearly knows a lot. I was hoping for a basic over-view for some context. Does that make sense?

I expected it to be for new people with ""John talks about this"" and ""the Old Testament is this compared to the New Testament being that"". ""Dealing with death you should study this"". I mean, what's ""Numbers"" and what's ""Acts""? why do they have such titles and who wrote them compared to James and John etc getting direct credit? Hey I told you I didn't have a clue so back off! ;-)

anyway....this was more like her regular show and not for a newbie trying to figure out what's what. It was fine but not at ALL what the title implies.",1207353600,27,849,4.13939393939394

8134802,5,B000GUOAWI,"I'm always looking for inspirational ways to study the Bible, perhaps picking up more than I do. This Joyce Meyer DVD is exceptional! Joyce and 2 reputable guests walk you through different approaches to the Bible, and lots of techniques are offered. At the end of the DVD, Joyce even suggests some books to keep handy while studying/reading the Bible. (Just about anything by Joyce is great...she is a great motivator!)",1466380800,,420,4.929577464788732

8134805,5,B000GUOAWI,"I have read the Bible all the way through and have decided that now I want to take it apart little by little and truly begin to understand what it all means. I received this DVD as a free gift with a donation to Joyce Meyer Ministries, and am kicking myself because it probably took me over 6 months to watch it. It's fantastic! It's incredibly simple to follow and offers some amazing tips to deepen your Bible study. Maybe this would have been a little overwhelming for me had I not already read the Bible, but I still think it's worth watching, and keeping for future reference. I also advise everyone to read the Bible in it's entirety before trying to study it. It will be far less overwhelming that way.",1378166400,8,709,4.378787878787879
