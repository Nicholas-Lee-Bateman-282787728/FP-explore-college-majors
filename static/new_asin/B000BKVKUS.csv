8088539,5,B000BKVKUS,"This is a story that needs to be told - over & over until child abuse is taken more seriously.  The fact that there are so many non-fiction movies about this topic indicates how prevalent child abuse is.  Today, we have organizations such as ""Child Protective Services,"" but they are understaffed & underfunded & they don't do nearly enough to protect innocent children from abusive parents.  Many children fall through the cracks & end up murdered.  It is an absolute disgrace.  The dirtbag father, stepmother & priest involved in this story are hopefully in hell, where they belong.",1518825600,,584,4.918367346938775
8088540,5,B000BKVKUS,"Extremely heartbreaking about a precious child. I felt as much disgust for her worthless father as her evil,vile stepmother.",1501286400,,124,5.578947368421052
8088541,5,B000BKVKUS,"Thank you Seller!  Dvd in great condition. Brand new. True Story of Aurore is heartbreaking, and touching story. Touches the lives and makes awareness of how far child abuse has reached and was over looked in the past. And is a very good film, for educational purposes.",1454371200,,269,4.723404255319149

8088543,5,B000BKVKUS,"I am still crying over this movie.  The movie is not graphic, however, seeing the chosen tools, hearing the painfully horrid screams and seeing the faces of the siblings who witnessed the abuse give you the general idea of what is going on.

I am a foster mom and I have worked with children of all types of abuse. But...not to the severity of what Aurore experienced.

I am not trying to spoil the movie for anyone, but the Priest in the movie, well...I very much dislike his character and his guilt led him in the right direction.

Rest In Peace Aurore'.  I definitely will not forget you.",1310083200,5,591,4.435185185185185
8088544,5,B000BKVKUS,"Aurure is based on a true story. It is a shocking film to watch and I must admit, the acting is excellent too, which is rather refreshing by today's standards. A very good movie, but unfortunately the second disc is all in French, and I do not speak or understand that language! It would go better, if there were subtitles to read. Rather than that, I would recommend this excellent movie to all true story crime funs. However, it is not for the faint-hearted as there are very graphic images.",1302739200,4,493,4.488888888888889
8088545,5,B000BKVKUS,"I came upon this story by accident one day and was able to watch some of the movie with Swedish subtitles, which I couldn't understand, and it touched me then. I was surprised when I found this version with the English subtitles and bought it immediately.
  It's one of the most moving and heartwrenching movies I've ever seen and makes my heart ache when I think about what that poor child went through at the hands of those monsters(her stepmother and father). I can't imagine someone treating another human being in this fashion. I went on-line and read more about this and read some of the court transcripts and found out that the movie is factual. They left some things out in the movie but it wasn't needed to get the point across.
  It's a very emotional movie and will bring out many different emotions as you watch it...anger, sadness, compassion, hate and love. I can't imagine anyone not crying while watching this movie.
  It's very well made and the actors do a superb job. I wish I understood French and I've very glad they didn't dub the movie but used subtitles so you can get the full effect of the acting.
  I highly recommend this movie!",1238889600,8,1156,4.550724637681159
8088546,4,B000BKVKUS,"I have more than 3,800 live-action movies dealing with children and teens. Fortunately, only a handful deal with such serious child abuse. The only one that equals 'An American Crime' is the French Canadian movie entitled 'Aurore.'  In both cases, the child subject is killed by an evil 'caregiver' woman.

One aspect of the movie I find troubling is that it is extremely weak in relation to any aspect other than just what happened.  This is sharply in contrast with 'Aurore.' The Canadian movie tells the story of a girl who was abused and killed by a stepmother; but it doesn't stop there. It was because of Aurore Gagnon's death in 1920 that the whole network of Child Protective Services was set up in Canada.  In 'An American Crime' we are never told if Sylvia's abuse resulted in anything good.  In fact, Sylvia's narration tells the viewers that she still hasn't found the meaning in what happened to her.

Also, both movies deal with the community involvement, or maybe I should say lack of involvement in stopping the abuse.  Indeed, Sylvia's case could be considered to be even more evil than Aurore's case because some of the neighborhood kids actually took part in Sylvia's abuse.  In both movies, the church pastor was an integral part of the story.  We never are told why Sylvia's Baptist pastor did so little.  In Aurore's case, her Catholic priest was an intellectual, a book scholar and professor, who was sent to pastor a rural parish for which he was sorely ill suited.  Still, neighbors and others in the community were aware that (at least) something horrible was happening and they did nothing; it was 'mind your own business' gone amuck.

I believe that everyone born is given an assignment by God to accomplish with their life, and when that assignment has been accomplished, He takes them 'home' to Heaven.  Sylvia might not see the meaning in her abuse and death, but I have a feeling that everyone who sees this movie (or 'Aurore') and who has a heart for children will not stand idly by if they ever even suspect that a child is being abused. If that is the case, then Sylvia's life and suffering was not in vain. Six-year-old Adam Walsh was murdered, and that propelled his father, John, to host 'America's Most Wanted,' a show that has saved many kidnapped children and also put hundreds of criminals behind bars. I would guess that little Adam is in Heaven looking down in amazement at how much his death has done to make life better for many others. I think Aurore and Sylvia would probably have the same 'Heavenly experience' as Adam.",1153267200,10,2568,4.692650334075724
