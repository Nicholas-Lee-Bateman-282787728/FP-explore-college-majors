8597124,5,B00DSAILH8,"This was viewed in a persuasive speech class in college.  This is one of the best films of maroys films  and is really a true documentary. Most are articles and news flashes of different outlooks mainly by women and ladies that at 1 moment they were in the lifestyle. Answered a lot of unanswered questions that most people would want to ask the Female.. Well here it is. IF you were in a persuasive speech class and on 1 end of the class, you might be on the other end of the class when the film is over, This film answers many stereotypes",1448323200,,540,4.233009708737864

8597127,1,B00DSAILH8,"I have most of Michael Maroy's movies, and this one is BY FAR the worst of them all! This ""documentary"" is about 80 percent REHASH from his old DVDs. HARDLY ANY NEW MATERIAL!!!!!! This particular dvd seems like a very very cheap way to make some money, without doing much work for it. No new research, no new people other than one or two. Nothing but ""new"" segments of ""old"" interviews that took place on his earlier dvds, and various News anchors conversating about prostitution....NOTHING NEW!!!!! I was excited to receive this dvd, then once I watched it I wanted my money back and felt VERY cheated in a very cheap way. This dvd should be given away for free, and that's for real. And the ending was so amateur and abrupt, that I couldn't believe it actually ended like that. Maroy, next time give us **QUALITY** okay? (And check your grammar and spelling on the dvd covers too...your movies will never be taken seriously by the mainstream when you have not edited the covers professionally. You have misspellings, missing apostrophes, missing commas, capitalization where it shouldn't be, etc. etc. Even in the title, ""Americas"" should be ""America's"")",1382140800,3,1156,4.843434343434343
