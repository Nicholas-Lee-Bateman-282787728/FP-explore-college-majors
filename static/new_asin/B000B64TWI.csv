8082076,5,B000B64TWI,"This DVD Contains Two Episodes:
1. Passover
2. Kids Sing Israel

This is my kid's favorite DVD of the Shalom Sesame Series.  The Passover episode does a wonderful job of teaching basic concepts of Passover for ages 3 to 5 with Sarah Jessica Parker among others.  The second episode  is a sing-along.  They present traditional Hebrew songs suitable for children, but also dub traditional muppet songs into both English and Hebrew.  Both episodes feature muppets familiar to American audiences, but also have some interesting new ones, like Oscar's cousin, Moishe Oofnick.  A very funny cultural twist!  The episodes are not new and were produced circa 1987, but have held up well.",1186876800,7,679,5.054054054054054
