This documentary is documented by late baron hugo van lawick, who have lived his 35 years of life in the serengetti, Its all about wildebeest migration.

Although there are many hunting scenes in this documntary like

hyenas attach wildebeest calves, A failed attempt of wilddogs to bring down there prey, cheetah attck on the wildebeest

But some scenes are truly remarkable, like Lioness ambush the drinking herds of wildebeest, and more over, a gigantic crocodile first surprises the wildebeest at grumeti and later make a catch that i have never witnessed in other documentaries.
