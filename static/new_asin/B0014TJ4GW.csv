8256333,1,B0014TJ4GW,"I am an addiction counselor at a Detox Center. Each year, I spend thousnds of dollars on books, CD's and DVD's with Amazon. I would be happy to do a review. But I don't want to put out more than $200 for something I may not find helpful. Would you be willing to donate the material to Lazarus House, and I will be happy to do a review. If it's good, Amazon will be making a significant contribution to helping alcoholics and addicts recover from their addictions.

Sincerely,
