 A flashback shows how a woman is killed when she is caught in the crossfire between local goons lead by Judd Nelson. Turns out this woman was married to a cop, who, of course, blames himself for her murder.
 Fast forward to the present day and the cop's now teenaged son Jason becomes entangled with Judd and his goons-on-loan, after he takes a fancy to Judd's girlfriend Alyssa Milano. So its up to daddy-the-guilt-racked-cop to load his gun and save the day.
 Actually the film sounds quite good wrote down, but don't be fooled. The biggest surprise is that Alyssa keeps her clothes on. Then again, she's only on screen for 5 mins.
