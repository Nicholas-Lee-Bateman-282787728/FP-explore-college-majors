8106294,5,B000E6508W,It's a difficult subject to watch passively. Demanding. This film has stayed in my mind and caused many lively conversations. LeConte is a master filmmaker and it shows with every frame of this movie.,1402012800,,200,4.911764705882353
8106295,2,B000E6508W,"This was a mistake for me.
To me the music never really correctly overlapped the mood for every different scene in the video.
Soo...the scenes were vibrant but the music killed it for me!",1388448000,,187,4.529411764705882
8106296,1,B000E6508W,"This movie should be shown in film school - as an example of the importance of a film's score in relating the material and creating a mood. The visuals in this film are good, but setting scenes of Cambodian life against the backdrop of European orchestral and choral music... well, that doesn't even sound good on paper and comes off even worse in execution. Every country has its own rhythm and pace, feel and vibe. The reason I, personally, fell in love with Southeast Asia are the sights, the sounds, the chaos of the place - all of which are completely absent here.",1369094400,3,569,4.533980582524272
8106297,4,B000E6508W,"I already liked the music and wanted to see the movie (which by the way is now really hard to find). I liked it too because it shows a different side of Cambodia and especially the children who live there. This has nothing to do with a touristic presentation of the country, but it shows some moments of life. After that it feels like you shared these moments with these people.",1358294400,2,378,4.338028169014085
8106298,1,B000E6508W,"This film is personal obsession with image and sound. It does not seem to have any intention of bringing the viewer into the content of the film. It does not give meaning to the place or to the people. So it maybe another country, another time, another space... Political statement? I didn't bother to find.
So, it maybe treated as some pretty background light-and-sound to whatever you're doing.",1350000000,,396,4.838235294117647
8106299,1,B000E6508W,Did not realize this film came from the US with RegionI coding. Not possible to play on any exquipment in Europe. To me a total waste. Have not found an european version yet.,1329609600,,174,4.303030303030303
8106300,1,B000E6508W,"The pairing of European orchestral music, especially the climactic superimposition of the choral singers on the tourist images of Cambodia, creates a stunning impression that the director is making a heavy-handed political statement or is out-of-touch and does not look at the world other than via cliches.",1310342400,,306,5.531914893617022
8106301,4,B000E6508W,"If you're a fan of Leconte or ""Qatsi"" films I can't recommend this enough. Academy award nominated filmmaker Patrice Leconte, mostly known for his wonderful RIDICULE & HAIRDRESSER'S HUSBAND, now travels to Cambodia to create a wonderful, spiritual symphony of sound, image and movement of a hidden land and its people. From the crowded city streets to rural villages (including the stunning extended panning shot through river-side town), Leconte paints an expert portrait of the beauty in hidden archaic life. Please release the amazing soundtrack by tienne Perruchon!",1274918400,4,569,5.4772727272727275
8106302,1,B000E6508W,"The headline catching phrase on this package says ""In the tradition of Koyaanisqatsi and Baraka""  Sure, if that ""Tradition"" means turning on a camera and filming something....that's to me where  ""Tradition"" ends with this film.
The entire soundtrack is a full European orchestra that is in constant conflict with the native scenery of Cambodia - let alone the fact that the editorial pace is often so quick you never have time to really absorb any shots. (the shots are no where near the 70mm footage like Baraka)  If you've ever been to these Asian lands you'll want to hear the sounds and the people - not a ridiculous symphony designed to evoke such an overblown emotional response.  Sure, this might appeal to some people - but if you, like myself, had such an awestruck  inspirational moment when seeing Baraka and fell in love with the beautiful images and music that you wondered why cinema couldn't do that kind of work more often - then spare yourself the torture and avoid this film!",1274572800,5,993,4.75
8106303,3,B000E6508W,"Robert Altman famously once convinced John Williams to score his home movies: with Dogora it looks like Leconte managed to score the full Bulgarian State Orchestra for his home video of a trip to Cambodia, not to mention a professional cameraman and editor in Jean Marie Dreujou and Joelle Hache. At first sight this appears to be one of those image-driven new age documentaries along the lines of Baraka, but it quickly becomes apparent that this is a film without agenda or even much in the way of basic construction beyond work, travel, sleep and sporadic moments of play: instead, it's an indulgence from a director who finally gets the chance to fulfil his desire to make a film without actors or plot, but purely an impressionistic series of images. Since Leconte has always had a great eye, this is by no means an unpleasant way to spend 80 minutes, although it does show up the limitations of the HD video system it was shot on. While it definitely looks better on the small screen than the big despite its 2.35:1 ratio and has surprisingly rich color, there's still a lack of depth to extreme long shots and the system doesn't cope well with fast foreground motion at all. But perhaps the most bizarre thing is Etienne Perruchon's score, which never gets further East than the Caucasus, displaying a surprisingly heavy Russian influence. Even the lyrics, supposedly written in the non-existent language of Dogorien (shouldn't that be Doggerel?) sound at times like a hymn of praise to tractors and the collective farm system. And it seems a horrible misstep to score a sweatshop sequence with upbeat music. Parts of it are very good, but you can't help feeling at times that you're listening to a rejected score from East-West.

The French DVD has no subtitles, which is no problem since there is no dialogue at all, and offers a 2.35:1 transfer, trailer, brief featurette on the recording of the score (unsubtitled) and, in most editions, a nicely produced book containing Leconte's diary notes of the shot.",1149292800,4,2017,4.829479768786127
