8426538,5,B004E79PHY,Very insightful documentary on UVa's football roots. Not only does it help you remember the good times but gives great perspective into little known facts and the origins of just how much the Cavaliers positively affected not only the college game but how the modern version of the game is played from Pop Warner through the NFL.,1438387200,,329,4.7894736842105265

8426541,5,B004E79PHY,"I bought this for my father, who has been huge UVa fan since I was a little girl. I figured the footage from the Welsh era would remind him of his favorite games and I wasn't really expecting that much in terms of the program's history. I thought UVa had never been a particularly big football school and that we didn't have much football history.

This documentary proved me wrong, and was entertaining while still being informative. My father loved it, especially the interviews with old players and their remarks on having played at UVa.

I think even casual football fans can watch this and appreciate the effort, care, and research that went into the production of this documentary.",1325462400,3,687,4.764705882352941
8426542,5,B004E79PHY,"Wahoowa! The History of Virginia Cavalier football is one of the best sports documentaries I've ever seen. As an alumni of the University of Virginia, I bought this DVD to gain a better understanding about the history of Virginia football. I'm not sure what I was expecting; an unabashed look at Virginia football from a retinue of homers. Certainly, the DVD is UVA-focused (obviously), but it gives a fascinating introspection into the evolution of the game from ""association-style kicking football"" to the ""rugby-style"" preferred and loved by Walter Camp, in what would eventually become football as we know it today.

I had no idea about the contributions UVA had made to the game of football, either, that are far deeper than I had ever known! The University of Virginia fielded the first collegiate football team in the South- to much derision, as northern teams (UPenn, Yale, Princeton, Harvard in particular) dominated the football landscape at the time. William Lambeth, a professor at the University of Virginia, worked with Walter Camp to modify the rules of football after Teddy Roosevelt put forward a mandate to change the games' rules and make it safer. It was his idea to change the game into four quarters, instead of two long halves. Not only that, but one of the major rules committee of that time convened *at* the University of Virginia... and they used the Virginia football team as a testbed to see how their new rules worked on the field!

But there are many things  how the first time Virginia Tech beat Virginia, it was with a ""ringer""- a ""professional"" football player who would go from school to school and sell their services to the highest bidder. This particular ringer was not allowed on the UVA Football team, as President Aldermann, the president of the UVA at the time, refused to allow anyone to play unless they could prove themselves as a student first. Anyway, he then enrolled at Virginia Tech to play football against UVA- lost several times. Then he ""transferred"" to UNC- where he lost again, twice. Finally, eight years into his ""college"" career, he transferred back to Virginia Tech... and finally scored the winning touchdown in the first victory over UVA.

Or how in 1952, the football program (ranked in the top 5 in the country and with a Cotton Bowl invitation) was almost disbanded over concerns about academics- and was not allowed by school administration to participate in post-season play for 30 years, almost crippling the football program. Which is all the more amazing consider in 1990, Virginia was ranked 1st in the country for four weeks.

All in all, a great buy for alumni and just lovers of the sport in general.",1314921600,4,2674,4.881057268722467
8426543,5,B004E79PHY,"Where do I start? I was totally blown away by this documentary. I knew I'd get an education on some things that I didn't know about Virginia Football, but I came away understanding so much more. Before watching the video I thought I realized what it meant to be a UVa fan and knew a good amount of the history of the program. I was wrong, dead wrong. My appreciation for UVa's football history is far greater as a result of watching this film.

This documentary not only provides a well presented history of the program, along with game highlights and interviews from the various eras of Virginia Football, it uncovered evidence that UVa was a major player in the foundation of college football and the game of American Football as we know it today.

I found it remarkable how brutal the sport was in the early 1900's (26 deaths in 1909 alone) and how two on the field deaths which happened during UVa football games against Georgia and Georgetown provided a crossroads for the sport. Had UVa's administration not encouraged rules changes and set forth new standards of conduct and integrity, the sport was destined to be abolished and criminalized.

It would make any Virginia fan proud to know that much of the foundation of how the game is played and how the rules were established came from standards envisioned and implemented on Virginia's ""grounds"". Anyone who considers it an option to lessen the standards at UVa to field more competitive football teams needs to see this video and reevaluate their position.

Wahoowa: The History of Virginia Cavalier Football is a must have for any Wahoo fan, and should be required viewing for anyone who follows the game of football.",1293580800,13,1679,4.759450171821306
