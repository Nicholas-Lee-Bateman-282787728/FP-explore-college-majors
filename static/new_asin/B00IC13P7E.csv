No surprise they are still going.",1403654400,4,103,4.2
8640815,5,B00IC13P7E,"First of all , this is not a DVD of a specific concert. It is a documentary that includes portions of songs  performed at  concerts that occurred  in the '70's. While it is somewhat frustrating to hear only parts of songs, It would appear that the purpose of this disc is the information that is shared in between the song clips. I found that information to be interesting and informative and much of it new to me. So, if I want to listen to music, I reach for one of the many concert DVD's that there are by the Stones. and if I want to learn something about the Stones, I  reach for one of the many documentary-style DVD's that are available.",1402099200,16,644,4.254098360655738
