1847399,5,B00008HC99,"The Pilot's Wife is my all time favorite book.  When I found the made for TV movie on DVD, I was both intrigued and skeptical.  The book is both emotionally wrenching and touching at once.  I had no idea if it could be pulled off in a movie, particularly a made for TV movie.
That said, I was almost entirely pleasantly surprised.  The movie, for the most part, stays close to the story line in the book, although it doesn't follow the book precisely.  Kathryn (Christine Lahti) learns at the beginning, that a plane piloted by her husband has gone down off the coast of Ireland.  Campbell Scott is amazing as Robert Hart who, as a union representitive, is the bearer of the bad news.
In the days following the plane crash, Kathryn must not only deal with the grief and take care of her daughter (Alison Pill), but must come to terms with the fact that maybe she didn't know her husband as well as she thought.  As lies and secrets are uncovered around her, Kathryn must figure out who Jack (her husband, played in flashbacks by John Heard) really was.
All in all, this is an excellent movie and I really enjoyed it.  My only complaint though (and it's a big one, to me anyway) is that the end takes a huge detour from the book.  Due to [Amazon.com's] spoiler rules and the fact that I don't want to ruin the ending for those who haven't seen it, I won't elaborate more than that.  Suffice to say the ending for the movie was a huge disappointment.  My only solace in the ending is that the movie covers a much shorter time period than the book, and thus I consoled myself by thinking that maybe the movie just hadn't gotten as far as the book.  This movie still ranks 5 stars because it is so well done and does pack an emotional impact that is at least comparable to the book.  My only real complaint is the ending.
All in all though, this is an excellent movie and I recommend it without reservations.",1061942400,7,1904,4.344632768361582
1847400,4,B00008HC99,"A commercial jetliner explodes off the English coast, killing all on board.  The recovered voice recorder indicates a struggle in the cockpit just before the crash.  It appears that the pilot may have smuggled a bomb onto the plane and detonated it, causing the tragedy.
Christine Lahti stars as the wife that learns life-shattering truths about her late husband (John Heard seen in flashbacks).  Campbell Scott is featured as union representative that comes to Lahti to provide support. All three are believable in their respective roles.
A taut script, good performances, interesting cinematography, and a evocative score make this 2001 production an above average TV movie.
It's no wonder that its initial 2001 airing was cancelled due to the events of September 11th.
There's ""food for thought"" here.",1058486400,3,804,5.265625
1847401,1,B00008HC99,"Jack Lyons is a successful pilot who dies when his plane explodes in midair.  His widow, Kathryn, is left with bittersweet memories and endless questions.  In addition, she finds that government officials suspect him of causing the disaster.  Kathryn begins unveiling Jack's secret life.
The acting is very well done, especially by Christine Lahti as the despondent Kathryn Lyons.  The plot has such potential.
Yet, ""The Pilot's Wife"" failed to hold my interest.  I didn't doze off, but I also didn't root for any of the characters or feel satisfied when the credits began rolling.
The scenery doesn't help much.  This is a very dark movie - literally.  How can I be concerned with what's going on when every scene is so darn bleak?  Granted, the story isn't particularly lighthearted, but can't we get some color into this movie??
This movie is just not enjoyable, and that's all there is to it.",1057881600,4,896,4.848684210526316

1847436,3,B00008HC99,"If I hadn't read the book first I might have rated this movie higher but important parts of the book are changed or omitted. We don't get the clear explanation for the out of character things the pilot does, like being devout in one place and not the other, like we do in the book. The daughter is given hints about what happened in the movie, meant to be kept from her in the book. Most of all I disliked the changed ending. It felt changed to end the movie on an uplifting note but the book's end was uplifting enoigh for me. My opinion?

Christine Lahti and Campbell Scott give above average performances. John Heard as the husband is lovely to watch too.

1847497,3,B00008HC99,"I wasn't impressed by any of the acting in this movie, and I thought the daughter's role could have been left out entirely. The plot was interesting but kind of faded away to blah at the end. I liked the plot of the husband having two lives in another country, but the IRA thing was kind of weird. It did make things suspenseful for a little minute, though, and I guess without it there wouldn't be a movie. I didn't get why Kathryn had to travel to the last place that was in the poem John loved so much. The poem could have been left out, too, in my opinion. Nothing really happened there in Ant--- whatever it was called. The ending was unsatisfactory and didn't really fit in with the rest of the movie.

The best thing about this movie was Campbell Scott just because I think he's hot. Too bad he didn't hook up with Kathryn. That would have been weird, but I would have given another star if that had happened. ;)",1236124800,,919,4.251428571428572

1847500,3,B00008HC99,"Christine Lahti plays Kristine Lyons, the wife of pilot Jack Lyons (John Heard) who loses his life in a plane crash.  Flying a route from Boston to London, the crash occurs off the coast of Ireland and under mysterious circumstances.
Attempting to gain insight into the crash, the pilot's union sends a representative to interview Kristine Lyons who ends up having many questions of her own.  Upon learning that information on the Cockpit Voice Recorder (Black Box) may possibly implicate her husband in the cause of the downed aircraft, Kristine Lyons resorts to finding the truth on her own which eventually leads her to England.
Upon reaching London and uncovering a trail of lies, deceit, a double life, and illegal activities spanning two continents, Kristine Lyons soon finds out much more than she ever expected to and realizes she never really knew her husband at all.
The Pilot's Wife is a movie that wants to be great but seems to settle in at above average.  The plot itself contains enough intrigue and mystery to carry two-thirds of it's length but the finale borders on being anti-climactic.  As far as the acting is concerned, Christine Lahti and John Heard are the only prominent names in the cast.  John Heard doesn't appear in enough scenes to carry any weight which leaves Christine Lahti to make up the difference.  She does very well in her role, in my opinion, and her performances are one of the finer points of the movie.  My final grade for The Pilot's Wife rates a B-.",1082073600,16,1494,4.767441860465116
1847501,4,B00008HC99,"This CBS TV movie was filmed in Ireland.  It is the second Anita Shreve book to come to the screen.  Her ""The Weight of Water"" which starred Sean Penn was well acted, but was laboriously edited.  (My review for that one was called ""The Weight of Editing."" :)  ""The Pilot's Wife"" fares a bit better overall, although Sean Penn is certainly one of our finest actors.
Christine Lahti who had her Oscar nomination for ""Swing Shift"" with Goldie Hawn does an incredibly excellent performance here.  The variety of levels she hits as grieving wife, compassionate mother, angry widow and driven super-sleuth give us a sterling performance.  Campbell Scott, real-life son of George C. Scott & Colleen Dewhurst, gives an excellent subtle performance as the pilot association representative who becomes emotionally involved.  John Heard played a character named Jack who was about as devious as Jack Lyons in ""Pilot's Wife"" in his co-starring role with Goldie Hawn in ""Deceived.""  While his performance here is in flashback and not as chilling, it equals the devious nature of his previous Jack from 1991.  Particularly excellent is newcomer Kirsty Mitchell as Murie Boland, the Irish counterpart of Lyons' hidden life.  Mitchell gives a brief but excellent portrayal of a woman whose life has been impacted by the violent struggles in Ireland.  I haven't seen her previous film credit of ""Capone's Boys,"" but certainly intend to seek it out on the basis of the strength of this performance.  Alison Pill from ""Pieces of April"" with Katie Holmes who plays daughter Mattie turns in a good performance as a teen dealing as much with the struggles of her own adolescent social issues as with her father's untimely death.
The depth for this picture comes amid the backdrop of the Irish troubles.  How the lives of the characters weave with the political turmoil of Ireland along with Lahti's performance elevates the picture from the mundane to the magical.  The DVD doesn't offer a great deal of extras; but it is nice to appreciate the film as an uninterrupted whole.  Enjoy!",1076630400,16,2062,4.970845481049563
1847502,3,B00008HC99,"THE PILOT'S WIFE was produced for television and scheduled to air soon after 9/11. Because the film begins with the crash of an airliner, the network decided to delay the telecast until April 2002. (Sensitivity, or just fear of losing advertising revenue?) In any case, the general mediocrity of television fare is well represented here.
As the movie opens, Kathryn Lyons (Christene Lahti) is awakened in the wee small hours by a pounding on the front door. Robert Hart (Campbell Scott), a representative of the airline pilots' union, is there to tell her that husband Jack (John Heard) was killed when the commercial 747 he captained blew up with 100+ passengers off the Irish coast on a flight from London to Boston. Within a couple days, a contingent of interrogators from the National Transportation Safety Board shows up with the FBI and lawyers in tow to ask pointed questions. This is just about the time that the news media begins reporting that the flight's pilot may have been responsible. It's only when Kathryn learns that her husband's mother, whom Jack said had died when he was nine, is now residing in a rest home in Minnesota, and that Jack didn't live in the crews' quarters whenever on a London layover, that she suspects he was hiding a few teensy details of his life. A scrap of paper in his trousers and an email address on his computer lead her to London, where she discovers that Hubby, presumably in response to a mid-life crisis, left behind a Big Irish Surprise. Several, actually.
It's not that THE PILOT'S WIFE is a bad film, it's just not a particularly good one. Lahti is a fine actress, who delivers a respectable performance, especially when she admits to herself and Hart that her marriage was, in fact, wretched. But what could have been an above-average suspense thriller falls victim to uninspired screenwriting that yields a storyline that proceeds at a sedate pace without any real surprises or substantive drama. There are the nondescript performances by Scott and Alison Pill, who plays Mattie, the Lyons teenage daughter. Alison, ostensibly the apple of her Dad's eye, seems less disturbed about his death than Mom's less than undivided attention when she (Alison) reveals that she ""did it"" for the first time three years before when she was fourteen. The scripting renders the Alison persona unnecessary to the plot, and the final heart-to-heart between Kathryn and her daughter seemed particularly lame, i.e. perfectly suited to the small screen on a Sunday evening in American suburbia.

You would have to watch the movie to see how this unfolds.  I looked at other reviews to see if anyone complained of the resolution of the DVD which was very washed out and dark--I checked my VHS copy which was exactly the same.  The box says, ""The Pilot's Wife,"" but the DVD itself says ""Pilots Wife,"" no apostrophe and no ""The.""  I had hoped the DVD particularly in widescreen would have been better than the VHS.  Anyway, it doesn't change the fact that it is a movie worth seeing, although I do see one reviewer complained it was not like the book altogether, and I have not read the book.",1520553600,,723,4.286764705882353
