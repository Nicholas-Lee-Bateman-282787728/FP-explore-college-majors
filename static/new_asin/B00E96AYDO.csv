5897794,2,B00E96AYDO,"I try not to be super critical of other people's films,  but this one really didn't deliver at all.  I guess it just wasn't what I expected and honestly was by far not even scary until a couple of scenes toward the end.  Not that I don't like some Horror works that are not completely scary,  but if that is what you say you are delivering at least make a better effort than this one did.",1408233600,4,388,4.065789473684211
5897795,5,B00E96AYDO,"this cult classic exploitational film shocked and entertain
audiences before it was banned in 32 countries due to
it's portrayal of an brutal murder that censors and governments
sat through a viewing of this film they thought was seeing a live
killing and condemned the film as an video nasty that it was never
censored just got withdrawn from sales by creating a list of 72
titles of banned and censored films split in to two lists 1st was
the prosecuted 39 where snuff was featured in and dropped
38 where films could be reinstated and uncut but sadly this

online shopping sites where it can be imported from even though
the killings are staged  9 out of 10

5897796,3,B00E96AYDO,"This film was a groundbreaking piece of advertising ballyhoo, but anyone who believe the girl tacked on at the end of the film is actually being killed should have their heads examined. The rest of the film is a 1971 film called THE SLAUGHTER, directed by Michael and Roberta Findlay, the king and Queen of sexploitation in the 60's & first half of the 70's. Michael was killed by the spinning blades of the back of a helicopter in the mid-70's. Roberta started making adult films and finished her career with a few unmemorable horror flicks. She is still alive.",1397952000,6,562,4.63
5897797,4,B00E96AYDO,"Warning if you value your movie collection as I do and you do not want your disc cracking in the middle, change the cover immediately. I got this movie as a gift otherwise I would not even have bought it. What is the use of buying a dvd that has been sitting in a case slowly cracking? To clear things up, this has absolutely nothing to do with how you put in and take the disc out. I have movies I never even watched that were busted already upon opening them, and one's that I only watched once and found them broken the second time trying to watch them. Pretty much I have found if the case makes any sound when removing the disc it means the center is breaking your disc slowly chipping away at the center every time you remove it or put it back. The main problem though is the centers hubs of these cases are so big that they force your disc up until it sits right the pegs supposed to be keeping it from falling out. Another test I do with my cases to make sure they do not crack, due to cheap companies and brain dead designers, is to make sure when the dvd is in place that you can still move the movie around a little bit. Meaning the hub is small enough that it does not put any pressure on the center of the disc and you can easily tell, if your movie can't wiggle around a bit, the case is garbage throw it out or your just flushing 10-50 dollars down the toilet. I just hope I can save your collection before it ends up in pieces like mine. More than just home experience I work in a dvd store and have noticed almost all the movies we had with this type of lame red or white case, almost every dvd was cracked, I'm talking 80% or more. Wow and these people have a job? I'm tired of being ripped off by dumb people! Also there are clear cases like this as well. Mad Dog Killer has the clear case and that is why I do not own it and never will.",1390608000,,1856,4.005390835579515
5897798,5,B00E96AYDO,"...but i reckon im about the only person in the World that does!  Even the bloke that they interview on this blu-ray appears to have only seen the film once! WTF?  And he admits that he will probably never, ever watch it again!  I like that its inept, it makes some scenes really weird as a consequence.  I love it's hokeyness and i think the 2 main female leads are beautiful in this movie.  5 STARS & and i don't give a **** what anyone else thinks!",1388707200,6,451,4.137931034482759
5897799,4,B00E96AYDO,"Everything about this DVD is awesome.  It features a reversible cover...one side features the image of the cut photograph, the other features some old school VHS artwork featuring some scary  looking chap about to lay into a lady with an axe. The DVD comes in a red plastic case which is a great contrast against the white cover art looks even better against the cover art on the reverse side. The film itself it sourced from an amazing print and looks fantastic...better than I thought this film could look actually. I don't notice any sort of improvement in the audio track at all, but the picture looks great! The special features are awesome as well... tons of still images including promotional stills, newspaper clippings, original VHS artwork, poster art, etc. Several interviews round out the special features really nicely and give you some intriguing insight into the making of this film. Those of you who own the original Blue Underground DVD release will want to go ahead and pick this one up anyway. It truly is an upgrade and you will not be disappointed!",1382659200,9,1069,4.804347826086956
5897800,3,B00E96AYDO,"The film is poor, there is no doubt about this, but it has its moments of unintentional comedy (poor dialogues, terrible dubbing, fake phones..) that make it tolerable. But still worth a vision for the fact of having created the legend of snuff movies. Not only for collectors and lovers of bad cinema.",1381968000,5,302,4.716981132075472
5897801,1,B00E96AYDO,"SNUFF in blu ray? I remembering renting this turd on VHS in the 80s. Totally unwatchable South American ""action"" film with a couple of minutes if FAKE ""snuff"" mutilation footage tacked onto the end. Don't be taken by the blu ray bait- a turd is a turd,no matter the format.",1381881600,12,273,4.48

This movie is not worth the price a one square of toilet paper.",1521590400,,326,4.52542372881356
8602833,4,B00E96AYDO,"SNUFF (aka: AMERICAN CANNIBALE- 1975) chronicles the exploits of a group of crazed, drug-fueled cultists, and their sadistic reign of maniacal terror. The leader, known as Satan (Enrique Larratelli), conducts his orchestra of homicidal madness, using female followers to annihilate the unwary in bloody, messy ways. Meanwhile, an actress named Terry London (Mirtha Massa) moves into her new digs. We are treated to Terry's outings w/ her friend Horst Frank (Clao Villanueva). Unbeknownst to the couple, Satan has eeevil plans for them. However, Satan decides to frolic naked w/ his demonic, female horde before taking on such a serious mission. Then, Terry's boss, Director Max Marsh (Aldo Mayo), decides to take Terry to Carnivale. Wow! Argentina is awesome! Terry REALLY enjoys Carnivale! She celebrates it by... well, you'll see, and hear her moaning! Anyway, at some point, the actual story resumes. Max is murdered, and the cops, one of whom has mysteriously acquired Max's voice (hmmm, this voice shows up in lots of characters), are on the case. Next, Horst's father comes home, and Terry engages him in geopolitical banter, which offends him deeply. Luckily, Satan pops in for a second, to deliver a mini-sermon! Whoa! Back at his torture chamber, screams fill the air. Along w/ more moaning, and other weirdness. Oh no! It's time for the infamous ""general store massacre"" sequence! These girls have absolutely no respect for the elderly! Finally, Satan decides to send his gore-bots out to do his grisly bidding. Mindless slaughter happens, resulting in the big, repugnant, double ""twist"" finale.  Preposterous on any scale, SNUFF does, ultimately, deliver the gorehundt's delight. For lovers of ultra-sludge cinema only...",1507161600,,1732,5.344322344322344
