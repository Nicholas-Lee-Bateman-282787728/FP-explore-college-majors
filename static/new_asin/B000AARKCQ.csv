8077266,4,B000AARKCQ,"In 2075, man dwells in space as well as on the Earth. Space debris has become a dangerous reality. Ai Tanabe is a young lady who has come to space to collect and dispose of this dangerous debris. She meets veteran debris collector, Hoshino. Together with their friends, they keep space travelers and residents safe. As time goes by, the 2 fall in love with each other. It's harder to do a dangerous job with the one you love waiting and praying for your safety.

This anime is really good. It has action, drama, comedy, Sci-fi/adventure, and a bit of romance. It's pretty stacked. The animation and voice actors are good as well. I'm really surprised that this anime isn't more well known. The 1 thing that keeps me from giving it a 5 star rating is the depth of the story. The story backgrounds the characters well, but there is a little too much wasted time on goofiness I think. If that time were used to develop the romance between Ai and Hoshino more, This series could have been incredible. This series does have a very satisfying ending though. Overall, this anime is a joy to watch. I highly recommend it to anime fans of any genre.",1354406400,,1140,4.480769230769231
8077267,4,B000AARKCQ,"This is the first Japanese comic series i read, and subsequently watched, and i would recommend it to almost anyone.  while the premise, garbage collecting between the earth and the moon in 2075 might seem a stretch, the themes and characters are universal.  there are some episodes that are a bit wacky, but overall the books and the series (especially the title song) are some of my favorites.",1154217600,,395,4.794117647058823
8077268,5,B000AARKCQ,"PLANETES is one of the best anime series to be released in the last decade, building a captivating story to a very satisfying climax, presenting a great ensemble of characters that you might find yourself truly attached to.  Volume 3 begins the journey in earnest.

The series tries to blend near-future sci-fi realism with trademark anime humor, often with mixed success.  Case in point: the Lunar Ninja episode on Volume 2 is one I will always be ashamed to show friends, no matter how into PLANETES they are.  Embarassingly goofy!  Sometimes, the stories remain a bit shallow, and while the English translation is top notch, some of the dialogue doesn't seem to translate well.  Hachi also tends to be a little loud in the English version... the Japanese voice actor pulls off his frustration and angst with a little more subtlety.

That might sound like a thumbs down, but it's not.  PLANETES still ranks as my favorite anime series, beating out many quality shows that I have seen over the last 20 or so years.

This DVD opens with an episode that begins to touch on the geopolitical issues that will culminate into a climax later in the series.  It's really the first ""serious"" episode, and that might be not doing the final episode of Volume 2 much justice, but it does feel like the series finally feels comfortable with itself.  We begin to see more complexity in the characters, and start to see how debris is not the only problem people will have to deal with 70 years from now.  Is it too depressing that terrorism is still an issue in 2070?

The DVD wraps with one of the best ""first kiss"" scenes in anime history, and you don't even see it onscreen.  It's a testament to the fine directing and writing behind the show.  If you find yourself interested in PLANETES, but you're not sure where it's going, stick with it.  Every DVD gets better from here on out; by the time you own the entire collection, you'll be glad you went for the ride.",1131580800,,1953,4.585014409221902
