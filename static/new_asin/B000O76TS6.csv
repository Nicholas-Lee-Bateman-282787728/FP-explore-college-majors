8183291,2,B000O76TS6,"The premise of this film is good, but the actual movie isn't. It's more of a character study of a couple whose live spins out of control when they lose their daughter to some dangerous monster in the woods. I thought that the monster would be explained more, but I all I got was short glimpses of it. And the final scene of the movie IS the monster, where it is tracking down the ""big foot"" hunter guy who is deserting town. It's ok to watch, but the over hype by the ""official selections of this and that movie festivals"" caused the movie to actually be somewhat of a disappointment. I guess the film makers knew this wasn't a winner because the do an extra making of featurette on the DVD that is OVER an hour long! And most of the footage isn't actually dealing with the movie, but the crew and cast acting stupid and random. I would so rather watch ""The Final Patient"". I agree with the ""official selection"" tag on that one.",1204156800,2,928,4.308571428571429
