8186306,3,B000OQF6MW,"As mentioned in other reviews, this is the 2004 remake of the beginning episodes of the 1963 series known in the US as Gigantor. Also, as mentioned elsewhere, the early episodes of the 1963 series was never shown in the US.
Obviously, the animation is of a much higher quality than the original. The stories are darker and more serious than the original.
However, I became aware of a disturbing undertone as I watched the episodes.
The series is set 10 years after WWII. There is a lot made of the suffering and hardships of the Japanese people during the war and the following occupation. Unfortunately, there is absolutely no recognition of the great suffering caused by Japan, the atrocities perpetrated by the Japanese soldiers, or the fact the Japan was waging a war of aggression and conquest.",1446595200,,799,4.797101449275362

Although not as upbeat and fun as Johnny Sokko, this story stayed focused and kept my attention for the entire 26 episodes. Not as flashy as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Giant-Robo-Economy-Pack/dp/B000FFL2ZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Giant Robo - Economy Pack</a>, but the characters and motivations made sense the entire time in this one.

The only reasons I didn't give a full five stars are because I didn't really care for the score (although it was used well) and the series maintained a pretty bleak atmosphere throughout.

In summary, an excellent tale and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for Johnny Sokko and/or mecha fans; I just wanted to have some fun while watching it.",1358726400,,1082,6.7214285714285715
8186309,5,B000OQF6MW,"There are two legends behind this series, one is the original author, Mitsuteru Yokoyama, a genius that can only be compared to Osamu Tezuka and Shotaro Ishinomori. The other is Yasuhiro Imagawa, a brilliant director, responsible for masterpieces such as Giant Robo The Animation and Shin Mazinger. This is one of his most dedicated and mature works and probably will not satisfy the public that often consumes the garbage that has become japanese animation. This is one of my favorite series, and for me, it's already a classic. And it is much more faithful to the original comic than his counterpart of the 60s(Gigantor).",1308614400,,623,5.0
8186310,4,B000OQF6MW,"Chances are you are a Gigantor fan, deciding whether to get this set or not. This is the complete reworking of the first 26 episodes of Tetsujin 28 before Japan's 27th episode became America's 1st Gigantor episode. In fact they have been reworked so much, that I'm highly dubious they bear any resemblance to the original cartoons that were made. Animation AND story. The studios of Japan were allegedly reluctant to release the first 26 episodes because of very poor quality animation. What they really didn't want us to know, is that the giant robot was originally built to destroy the American forces during World War II, and were fearful of how Americans would react to that premise. In this dvd series that notion is so vaguely mentioned, it's almost not mentioned at all. Well alright it's mentioned but there are no scenes of the tetsujin engaged in combat against U.S. forces. Looking very similar to, but not exactly like Gigantor, the biggest difference between Tetsujin 28 and Gigantor is, where Gigantor is an upbeat adventure where the forces of good and evil are clearly defined (my kind of show) and Gigantor is called upon to save the day, Tetsujin 28 is downbeat drama where good and evil seem to intermix too often, making Tetsujin 28 seem to be the cause of their troubles. I only wish the episodes were upbeat like the catchy military chorus theme song. Great animation and good drama make this set definitely worth a look.  The set contains 6 discs not 4 as listed in the product description.",1252800000,15,1513,4.752851711026616
