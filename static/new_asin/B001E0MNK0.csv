So I finally decided it was now time to get back down to the weight I used to be, before the breakup. My doctor suggested purchasing a fitness or weight loss DVD as a good starting place. So, eager to finally be able to get back into my XL pants, I bought this weight loss DVD. The back of the case said spending 45 mintues with this DVD per day would shred off up to 10 pounds per week. I calculated that at this rate I should be back in shape within 4 months.

I started the program on a Monday, the day I got the DVD in the mail. I assumed that starting right away would help. What a joke. I sat through the entire 45 minute program and did not weigh any less when it was over. I figured, okay maybe it takes time, you know. So I watched the DVD every day that week, and on Saturday again weighed myself. I had actually gained 2 pounds. I don't know how they can get away with selling this as a weight loss DVD. Maybe if I would have switched to eating low-fat popcorn while I watched it I could have lost some weight. But I don't think it would have been worth it. This is one of the most boring DVDs I've ever watched.",1268870400,,1255,3.9215686274509802
