8279558,4,B001ASQ9F6,"Daisuke Niwa is 14 years old. He is the next Phantom Dark. Each generation of Niwa males shares their body with the legendary thief, Phantom Dark. Phantom Dark is frowned upon by society as a common criminal. The public doesn't know that he actually steals cursed artwork and artifacts. The young Daisuke has a crush on Risa Harada. Risa only has eyes for the Phantom thief. The one who actually loves Daisuke is the older Harada twin, Riku. Now this dilemma seems simple to me. Tell them both that you are Niwa as well as Phantom Dark. Or just choose the sister you like and be with her. Personally, I think that Risa is a bit shallow and clueless. I would definitely go for the more sincere Riku. I'll let you watch and find out who the winner is. Anyway, for the bond between Dark and Daisuke to be broken, and their duty fulfilled 2 things must happen: 1. Daisuke must steal his sacred maiden, and 2. Dark must defeat his rival, Krad. The drama and action is very good. This series is very solid.

D.N. Angel is a really good show. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are very good. You'll recognize the main characters. Vic Mignogna, Luci Christian, and Hilary Haag all play the major characters. There is a good mix of action, drama, romance, and comedy in this series. There are times when it seems to drag, and get into some unimportant story arcs. I think that the potential for this anime was higher than it actually achieved. If the useless arcs were used for relationship and character development, it could have reached its true potential and became a 5 star series. Because of those things, it was a solid 4 star series. I don't want to make it sound like this series was disappointing. It didn't disappoint. It was very good, and I'm glad I bought it. It's definitely a show that I'll revisit in the future. By no means is it one of the best anime series out there though.

It does have another strong point that separates it from many other shows. While many anime series out there today are quite perverted and geared toward males. This is a very clean and wholesome show. The characters have very sweet and pure personalities. There isn't really any fan service; unless you count the beach trip episode. The language is very mild. These things are kind of nice to see in an anime. Boobs, perverts, and Yuri are very overdone themes in anime nowadays. Although I get a kick outta that stuff once in a while, it's not essential to a strong series. I like that D.N. Angel kept it clean. It's one that you can share with the whole family. It will even teach younger kids a few important lessons about love, friendship, and family.

I apologize for rambling a bit. I had a lot to say about this show. In conclusion I recommend this series to all anime fans over the age of 8 or so. It's not the best series out there, but it's very solid and has some cute and innocent love and drama. I really enjoyed D.N. Angel and I hope you do too.",1356220800,2,2956,4.440147329650092
8279559,5,B001ASQ9F6,"D.N.Angel is a random any I found on a store shelf one day and decided to try it. I enjoyed this anime so much, I knew I needed the box set.

D.N.Angel is a great anime, a bit different than most, but very well played. Vic Mignogna voices Dark Mousy. Which made my day because Dark is my favorite. On the DVDs there on voice actor commentary's. But on this box set their are no commentary's. Their are really no extras. But either way, I really enjoyed this box set. And the money I spent on it was deffinitly worth it.",1292198400,2,519,4.138613861386139
8279560,3,B001ASQ9F6,"I was going to price this online, after looking at it in Best Buy tonight, only to find that Amazon is asking $80 for it. It was $30 at Best Buy, which is a good price for a compact series set, as I would expect to spend between $30-$50. The $80 price tag on this is laughable.",1272672000,3,277,3.8771929824561404
8279561,4,B001ASQ9F6,"Just a note for future buyers, this contains the very same 26 episodes as the DNAngel box set.  It's not a Vol. 2, just a new design, so more like a VERSION 2.

The only reason I didn't give it five stars, is because of it's confusing label as a different volume.  This is a wonderful anime and I very much recommend it.",1233532800,11,320,4.0476190476190474
