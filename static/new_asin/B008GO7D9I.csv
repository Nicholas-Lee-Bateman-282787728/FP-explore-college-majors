8527666,5,B008GO7D9I,"When I think of FOR YOUR EYES ONLY I think of stunt, after stunt, after stunt that seems to obliterate this film's attempt to return the James Bond series to its original origins. Roger Moore gives a good performance as 007 and a much tougher one. It is interesting how the level of physical stunts that James Bond is required to perform increases exponentially with each of Roger Moore's Bond films.

FOR YOUR EYES ONLY is a good Bond film and the first two thirds of the film are excellent. However, the film cannot keep up with its action and thrills as in the third act. When you've seen one impregnable mountaintop fortress, you've seen 'em all. Bill Conti's disco score actually helped this film along the way giving it some energy and drive. It is in the final third of the film that Conti returns to a more traditional orchestral scoring which only contributed to the anti climatic finale. The sinking of the St. Georges, the attack on Kristatos' warehouse and Bond kicking Locque's car, with Locque still inside, off the cliff were high points that were excellently filmed.",1417910400,,1082,4.6947368421052635

Director Glen's second unit work on ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE is well documented. His excellence shows her in OCTOPUSSY. John Glen's enormous contributions to the Bond series seem to have gone unsung and somehow forgotten. Let us not forget.

OCTOPUSSY is probably Roger Moore's best Bond movie. It is a richly textured film beautifully photographed and full of rich and detailed production designs. It seems like a throwback to the 60s style of filmmaking. The pace is slower and deliberate and the dialogue seems to have subtler wit interspersed. It has an overall nostalgic feel about it. The opening is excellent as we see Bond the spy infiltrate a banana republic air base. Bond escapes via a Bede Acrostar mini jet aircraft with a guided missile in hot pursuit.

The score by John Barry is a little sparse and sporadic but still rich in structure and flavor. Barry utilized ""The James Bond Theme"" more for this Roger Moore outing than he did for his other scores for the Moore Bonds. He did do an outstanding job scoring the scenes involving the Soviets, which had that eastern block flavor similar to his score for THE QUILLER MEMORANDUM.

To its credit, the film uses elements from the short stories ""Octopussy"" and ""The Property of a Lady"" by Ian Fleming in a sentimental throwback to earlier Bonds. FOR YOUR EYES ONLY filmed just before this one, also used some of Fleming's original writings for inspiration. In that one Bond as the shark bate in-tow was taken directly from Fleming's novel ""Live and Let Die.""

Louis Jourdan as Kamal, in a very underrated performance, is excellent and is one of the best villains of the series. He is Bond's counterpart nemesis. It was also good to see many of the regular cast members return for this one. Desmond Llewelyn as ""Q"" seemed to return to his old self as he had established prior to DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. Walter Gotell as Gogol, Geoffrey Keen as the Minister of Defense, Eva Reuber-Staier as Rublevitch, Jeremy Bullock as Smithers and Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny all reprised their roles much more effectively and reminiscent to the style of the earlier Bonds. Robert Brown replaced Bernard Lee as the beloved ""M."" We all missed Bernard.

The film goes a little over-the-top near the end having Octopussy's troupe of beautiful amazons attack Kamal's Monsoon Palace. Then the film really goes over-the-top and under-the-top as Bond crawls all over Kamal's Beechcraft Model 18 Super H18 as it dives, loops and tailspins. I don't see anything wrong with that. This is one of the better James Bond films of the series. Great John Barry score.",1413763200,,2723,4.84731182795699
