8620633,5,B00G4MZCNI,"Never thought I'd write a review for a Japanese TV sitcom.  But got to say I enjoyed this one season long, comedy drama, only done Japanese style.  If you want a cute story mixed with angst over being overweight and the trials of trying to lose it and keep it off, mixed with food and comedy this is for you..  Hard to categorize but for this reviewer I like it.",1523664000,,362,4.142857142857143
