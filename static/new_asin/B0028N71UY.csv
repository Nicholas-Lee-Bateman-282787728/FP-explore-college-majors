8356424,1,B0028N71UY,I was unable to view movie.  It would download and play 30 seconds then go back to downloading.  I was able to see 25 minutes over 75 minutes of view.,1412812800,,150,3.966666666666667
8356425,3,B0028N71UY,"This is the story of a widower who sees and talks to his dead wife for twenty year during the upbringing of his daughter, and ends with the marriage of his daughter. The film unfolds through an endless series of flashbacks. It is a perfect chick flick because it seems as if everything the father does on his own is wrong. Left to his own means, he might have unwittingly raised his child poorly, but his wife is always there to steer him in the right direction.  Making matters worse, the dialog is syrupy and the plot development is thin. If this is your type of flick, you will enjoy it immensely.",1305849600,,600,4.357142857142857
8356426,3,B0028N71UY,"While I don't want to minimize the subject matter, this movie is definitely engineered to be a heartwarming, feel good movie. Of course, I knew that before I watched it but I don't mind these types of movies if they do a good job. This one was slow in many places with a predictable ending and some predictable plot elements. the acting was done pretty well, but not great. I wouldn't recommend this to a guy, but this works for your average chick.",1264982400,2,448,4.409638554216867
8356427,5,B0028N71UY,"Hi,

I don't know how IMDB reviews its movie, but for me....Its a CLASS.

Some says its SLOW - Well who don't want to be slow - to be loved - to be blessed - to blush.

Some says its not upto Hollywood standards - Well who wants to follow the standard when you want to be simple, be loved, cared and with some tears......because you are happy.

A GREAT MOVIE......MUST WATCH.",1257811200,,375,4.166666666666667

8356432,5,B0028N71UY,"I enjoyed Melora Hardin's Directorial Debut with YOU the film. It was a family affair where she starred in the film along with her husband, Gildart Jackson and their daughter. It was both a heartwarming and heartbreaking story and it appeared they put their hearts and souls into this story. Sometimes along with great love, comes sadness and pain. All of these emotions are touched on in this story and I recommend this beautiful film to everyone who has a heart.
