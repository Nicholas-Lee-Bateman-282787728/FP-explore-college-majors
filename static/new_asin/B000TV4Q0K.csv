The Japanese always always interesting and this movie showed me some new aspects that I never knew.  Fun movie, some soft core simulated sex, no real sex but not for kiddies.",1385337600,,314,4.362068965517241
8211030,4,B000TV4Q0K,"""Honeymoon: Japan's Biggest Sex TV Station"" is a documentary by Slovenian director Drazen Stader.  Purported to be the first part of a trilogy exploring the sometimes bizarre world of the Japanese sex trade, it follows the production of a show on the 24-hour adult channel Paradise TV.

The story begins with Ono, a young ""juice man"" in the trade who has dreams of becoming a director.  His mentor, experienced director Kobayashi, has given Ono his shot by directing a episode of ""Honeymoon"",  a live show which specializes in a ""call in"" format where viewers can request things from the actress and cameraman in real time.  Ono sets about recruiting his crew, including veteran cameraman Narayama and first-time actress Makoto.  Makoto is a cute, bubbly and somewhat nave girl who currently works as a hostess at a cabaret club, drinking and flirting with customers, but she wants to break into the lucrative adult video industry.

""Honeymoon"" is actually quite a good film, effortless moving back and forth between erotic and funny, between ""behind the scenes"" and the customer's point of view.  I was quite impressed by it, and enjoyed it much more than I expected to.  Director Stader doesn't dwell too much on the psychology of what is going on, and just shows the day-to-day life of a worker in the adult industry.  There are some great moments, such as Makoto forgetting her lines and flubbing the scenario, and the sexual frustration of Narayama who has to film sexy women and simulate sex all day but never actually gets any for himself.

As can be expected in a film on this topic, there is quite a good dose of nudity and I think Makoto spends maybe 10 minutes of the film with clothes on and the rest of it in topless glory or in a variety of costumes requested by viewers.  The strange nature of the show has the camera man wearing a strap-on so that Makoto can perform with it while viewers imagine it is their own.  Like all Japanese films of this nature, nothing gets too extreme and is strictly soft core.

I honestly don't know if this is a real documentary or not, because I have never seen anything like this in Japan, but the director claims it is and I see no reason to dispute him.  Even though the director is not Japanese, ""Honeymoon"" is entirely in Japanese with English subtitles.  The DVD has some funny extra features, including some cut scenes that add nothing to the story but are just a bizarre slice of the industry.  If Stader ever does get the intended films in his trilogy done, I would be standing in line to see them!  Lots of fun!",1222646400,3,2569,4.621145374449339
