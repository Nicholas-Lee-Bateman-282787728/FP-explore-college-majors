8397643,5,B003IPD95M,"This book excites me for more than one reason:  First, it is sharply focused and easy to grasp but not superficial.  That's saying a lot, for leading-edge science, isn't it?  Second, Dr. Eagleman is working to make practical use of the techniques he's pioneering -- for prisoners and other ""throw-away"" populations practically nobody sees as worth their while, and third, it inspires hope that the many isolated specialist slots that now compete for funding and for media attention are unlay by a public-spiritedness that once was widely shared in Western culture, but that lately seems to have declined to mere dollar-chasing pharmaceuticals and high-tech gadgets to keep people like Dick Chaney and that fellow Addleston alive and kicking (for what good purpose, I can't say.)  Read this book first, if you are only going to squeeze in one on neuroscience.",1454803200,,858,5.107142857142857
