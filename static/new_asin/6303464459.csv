7848772,5,6303464459,"Having enjoyed the original Fresh Start video for years, I was looking for a little more of a challenge and discovered Fresh Start 2.  It is similar but with more variety and you are on your feet rather than a chair for most of the video.  It also includes some floor exercise which I am able to do even with arthritis in both knees.  Diane says to stop if you have pain and there are participants demonstrating modifications so there is no pressure. I always feel that I am succeeding in this routine which is great!",1383177600,,517,4.364583333333333
