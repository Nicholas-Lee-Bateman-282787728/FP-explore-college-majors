4251464,5,B0042KPS88,"This excellent crime series really hit its stride with series 4. The stories are well-plotted, the characters are sharply defined and the acting is wonderful. For the first time a storyline is carried over from episode to episode, which heightens the emotional impact. The episode in which it is finally resolved ('Seen A Ghost') is the best episode of the entire Wycliffe canon.

If you haven't caught up with this series but you like British mystery, give it a try. You won't be disappointed.",1292889600,10,494,4.880952380952381
4251465,4,B0042KPS88,"Although a fine series otherwise, due to episode 9 ""Dance Of The Scorpions"" being omitted it lacks continuity going into series 5.",1291334400,7,130,4.954545454545454

8413790,3,B0042KPS88,"I had to check because the thing seems like it was shot in the 70's and I was surprised to find that it is a 1990's series. I think for one thing the hour format cramps these shows. There is much less texture in this series. The plot and human complications that usually make British series so rich get unfolded too quickly at the end of each show in Wycliffe. The dialogue is...less. I would place these DVD's at the back of the line, while you are waiting for another season of Vera or Case Histories to come to the fore.",1424736000,2,523,4.188118811881188

8413794,5,B0042KPS88,"We are real fans and have not been disappointed with Series 4.  Found a lot more character conflict, especially with DI Kersey and DI Lane - wonder if this will lead to one of them leaving the team?  Really great background scenery and locations.  Can't wait for Series 5 and hope the series continues.",1407715200,,302,4.555555555555555
8413795,4,B0042KPS88,"I enjoyed Series 1, 2, and 3 and grew to enjoy the characters.  They had several running themes in this series.  I prefer shows that stand alone.  Again they included Wycliffe's family in the stories.  I don't think that really worked with the mysteries.",1357689600,,254,4.704545454545454
8413796,5,B0042KPS88,"This is the show that started with a decent first series. (which truthfully is far weaker than this  4 series) And it continued to get better; so by the third series it was really humming and all the parts fell into place. This series really moved forward in storylines and utilizing the two other leads of the show. In this one we have one of them make terrible decisions and it leads to the death of child even. And in another Wycliffe must maintain his stoic leadership deal with the slimey superintendent who wants to sacrifice his detective out of hand so that the sup can gain points and  look better. All those people who dismissed the first series and never gave this one a chance sure lost out. It's also fun to see the late 90's again the tech has changed alot since then and I am not sure we are better off in some ways for it. (too many people today don't communicate , all they do is sit and look at little screens). Still in other ways it's better. Sadly they unwisely only made five series of this show and that's a loss for all realistic detective show lovers. The dvd quality of all these series is excellent. The master prints have been well maintained thankfully. You do see film grain that is common from the british tele scene of the 90's but it's not a defect at all.",1309737600,5,1289,4.322314049586777
