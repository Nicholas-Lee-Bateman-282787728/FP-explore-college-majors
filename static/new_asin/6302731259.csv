502041,3,6302731259,"(2.5/5 stars)  No, it is not a good film, but I have seen much, much worse. Drew Barrymore looks gorgeous, the ending is truly surprising (for better or for worse) and there is a decent supernatural element to it. I won't rehash the plot because others have already done so; rather, I will simply attempt to justify the rating I gave it. The entire film is amateurishly done, though I would give it an A for effort if that really mattered. The filmmakers were trying to make a thriller about an extremely mysterious young woman and the movie accomplishes that. Also, the energy almost makes up for the lack of talent and quality. However, the subtext concerning ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is an interesting idea better left on the drawing board, and the script could have used some tightening. Fans of horror films have grown accustomed to low budgets because films in the genre are rarely taken seriously. After watching films such as this, one can understand why. Nonetheless, a low budget is not an excuse to produce a low quality film. Filmmakers must work within their budgets and not provide signs that indicate any limitations. Lack of a budget doesn't bother me, but the filmmakers must have realized how ridiculous the effects at the end of the movie looked. To be taken more seriously, they could have revised the ending to avoid these effects. The fact these effects were left in the movie indicate to me this movie is meant to be fun, not earnest. Taken for what it is, it really isn't awful.",1154995200,,1502,4.6893939393939394
502042,1,6302731259,"i cannot, with good conscience recommend this movie.

please, look at it! it's awful!

drew barrymore, in her sad ""poison ivy"" stage, is a wretched performer.  there are pothole plothole's all over the place.  and it's itchy to watch the scene with her real mother, jaid barrymore.  were they attempting reconcilliation through a b-movie?

oh! and the guy from adventures in babysitting, father of the bride & a few episodes of friends is in it, fumbling around too. where is that guy?

there's a tough broad friend, a spooky house & at one point SPOILER: drew splits in half all oogy and walks around like some really skinny anatomy horror movie thingy.

hey! now it sounds kind of good again.",1134259200,4,694,4.725
502043,1,6302731259,"This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever wasted my time watching! Don't dispose a precious cent on this movie unless you are a gigantic Drew Barrymore fan and you are merely viewing the movie for the raw sex scenes and constant,random nudity. The storyline could have worked, yet the movie is pathetically low budget, the acting is horrid and the movie falls desperately flat. It is impossible to like this movie unless you are obsessively in love with Drew Barrymore and you want to watch her at her lowest point. It's so bad that I had to come here to  vent about it online. The director was obviously a film school drop-out who offered the actors free cocaine and produces low budget porn.",1102118400,5,700,4.511811023622047
502044,4,6302731259,If you take it in stride you may find this movie very entertaining.  This movie does have gooding acting in it by all of the cast members and has star power.,1101686400,4,157,4.064516129032258
502045,4,6302731259,"Drew delivers a very good, believable performance. Throughout the movie, she keeps us in suspense, wondering whether the doppelganger truly exists or she is suffering from MPD (multiple personality disorder). Her supporting cast members also perform well but she definitely stands above them. The movie is not an award-winner by any means but the acting is good and the story, which is very well written, covers a subject that is refreshingly different...there are not many movies out there on the supernatural element of doppelgangers.
Unfortunately, this movie has been overlooked by many. If you like suspense/horror movies, give this a try...you'll be pleasantly surprised.",1087948800,2,677,5.519230769230769
502046,5,6302731259,"Drew barrymore plays holly gooding, she kills her mum at the very begginning [Her also real mum]. Holly has a double. A man dresses up exactly like her to get people to realise who she is killing when actually he is doing it. He tells her to murderer her mother. She is an evil within. Toward the end, her brother is killed and him dressed up is like her and people think she as done it. She as been made like she is because of him who is telling what to do. She knows that the murderer is back. At the end it shows her turning into blood, skeleton abit discusting. 2 skeletons of her 2 sides of her. One kills the murderer and never kills the man who is good. ACE,GORE AND TERRIFYING. My mum liked this film too i never thought so a bit rude in parts 18 rated.",1082073600,4,761,4.046357615894039

I've watched this movie once every 3/4 years since I was a teen; a guilty pleasure without logical explaination; just aweful and fun at the same time.",1448064000,4,296,4.481481481481482

502138,3,6302731259,"A jumbled mess of a film that manages to be so bad it's good in a very bizarre way.  Drew Barrymore is captured in her ""I'm a slut"" phase with perfect accuracy in Doppleganger.  The concept is jumbled as all heck.  Makes no sense as far as plot and explanations go.  It's a train wreck situation with a few funny quotes.  Very '90's bad cinema.  Worth checking out if you're a hardcore b-movie fan who must see everything.  Late night Showtime meets nacho cheese b-movie.",1421193600,,471,4.470588235294118

502142,3,6302731259,"Okay, not a great movie, but worth watching, and primarily because it is a remake of the plot points of Breakfast at Tiffany's, but as a monster movie.  In fact, the writer (in the story, not of the script) is trying to do the very same thing so it's one of those story of a story type things.",1366416000,,293,4.051724137931035

502194,3,6302731259,"As we all know -- this movie did not win an Oscar.  However, if you are a person who loves Drew and/or need to kill time I'll say it would not hurt to watch this one. Basically the reviews are spot on with how negative they are about the picture, I'm being nice giving it three stars but since it's mainly a B-movie quality and Drew Barrymore does everything in her power to make this film work, I gave it an average rating.  Thankfully this movie did not hurt Drew's career as she was finally getting her life back in order after years of drug abuse.",1321228800,,551,4.188679245283019

502197,4,6302731259,"Yes, it has a low budget.  Yes, there are some loose spots in the plot.  So do ""Evil Dead"" and ""Suspiria"" and any number of classic horror movies.  Since when does having a low budget and cheesy effects mean that a movie is bad.  In defense of the effects at the end, this was made back in 1993 and was made on a relatively low budget.  All things considered, it's not that bad.  As for the story, the whole ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" with monsters and crazy people was one of the things I liked best about the movie.  The overall effect is a little uneven, but I like a little lopsidedness in a horror film.  It's those raw, uneven edges that attracted me to the genre in the first place.  So, is this a perfect movie?  No.  But that's part of the appeal.",1205798400,2,754,4.2027972027972025
