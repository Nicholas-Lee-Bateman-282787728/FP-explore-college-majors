186567,5,156501345X,"This is the best and most accurate documentary on the legendary ocean liner! I originally saw this program broadcast on A&E, back in 1997(just before James Cameron's Oscar winning masterpiece ""TITANIC"" was released in December). The overall production of this documentary is absolutely phenomenal! The artist's featured renderings are larger-than-life interpretations of R.M.S. TITANIC's glorious, but, brief maiden voyage and, subsequently, her dark watery grave appearance.
 The pictures are shown, with detailed narration, in the order of TITANIC's timeline of events....from her departure from Southampton, England to the eyewitness accounts from survivors of her sinking April 15, 1912(most of whom have passed away since this 1994 production, sadly). This DVD has all the questions of TITANIC and her tragedy answered. I highly recommend that you purchase this outstanding DVD here at the, always dependable, Amazon.com! This DVD is, now, rare to find....get it, now, while you still can!",1005696000,,994,5.716216216216216
186568,5,156501345X,"A sobering and detailed look at the Titanic tragedy, from the big picture of it's historical/social context, to the haunting description of the cacophany of screams carrying across the glassy ocean waters ('not unlike the home-run roar of a ballpark stadium crowd'), echoing in the tormented memories of those survivors who watched their loved ones go down, as they sat huddled and shivering and paralyzed with fear and cold in the frigid safety of their lifeboats. The people who built it, the people who owned it, the people who survived it, the people who found it - it's all here, and more. An almost painfully thorough look at a serious tragedy that brought out incredible acts of bravery, courage, and heroism, as well as blatant acts of foolishness and cowardice, for those sincerely interested in the harsh reality of the historical truth, and not the glamorized hype of the Hollywood myth. Truly an epic documentary of an epic disaster, the trauma of which continues to reverberate through our modern consciousness.",998956800,9,1024,5.029411764705882

This documentary has everything you always wanted to know about TITANIC, but didn't know where to begin to find it. I find that each time I watch this I find myself feeling melancholy afterwards [much like Cameron's film]. Personal accounts are woven throughout the documentary to give it the proper perspective, and it brings this tragedy back to life. I can't find anything negative to say about it.

186578,5,156501345X,"Titanic: The Complete Story has seen very many different treatments and product packaging from VHS to a more current DVD treatment for the centenary.  This version, however, released in 2002, is the one I own.  It is magnificent.  The first two documentaries: Titanic Death of a Dream, and Titanic The Legend Lives On were part of an original 1994 A & E special broadcast.  The third documentary, released during the Cameron Titanic mania age in 1998, takes a look at Titanic throughout the generations in various forms of either print media or movies.  That's all well and good, and has been described countless times by other reviews before me, and much more eloquently.  I would like to bring your attention to the first two documentaries in this series which truly make this box set.  They were created during a time when documentaries actually meant something, and were not full of errors and personal agendas, as they are now.  They tell the complete story of the Titanic, from inception to death, to aftermath.  The look and feel of the work is truly impressive and transports the viewer right back to the Edwardian age of the super liner.  Utilizing period photos, brilliantly edited together with moving water imagery, these first two documentaries capture the true feel and essence of Titanica!  The music is also fantastic and fits well with the period.  The accuracy of information is striking especially compared to more recent documentaries.  This is one documentary you will cherish forever and will want to watch over and over again.  If you want to be transported back to Titanic, the true Titanic without all the fluff of modern media hype, before the age of Cameron's glossy take on the tragedy....get this documentary!  You will NOT regret it!

The third documentary was interesting enough, but not one that particularly stand out as anything special.  I could have done without it, simply because I'd taped it off of the TV when it originally aired in 1998.  It may be interesting to some, but for me was rather lack luster and I'm not really one who cares too much about a documentary detailing how Titanic has appeared in media throughout the ages.  Its the first two documentaries in this set that made me purchase it, oh and the fact that my VHS of those two were completely burnt out!",1366588800,,2310,4.817258883248731

What a disappointment. Having just completed reading an excellent book on the three sister ships, I found this doco quite dull, to the point of sending me off to sleep. David McCallum and other narrators speaking the parts of survivors were so monotone in their presentation as to make a fascinating historical tragedy quite bland.
The overlapping of historical photographs with film I found annoying, and even though the interviews with people who remembered seeing the ships being built in Belfast was interesting, a lot more detail could have been given and more historical photographs shown as to their stages of construction.
This documentary was historically correct, but presentation and narration left a lot to be desired.",1335312000,,977,4.752941176470588
186584,5,156501345X,"I originally bought this in the late 90's when Cameron's Titanic was released on VHS and for some reason I couldn't get my fill of Titanic...I literally bought every documentary on the market and this was the ONLY documentary that was not only worth repeated viewings, but stands out as one of my favorite docs. on any subject. From the state-of-the-art production values to the straight ahead storytelling of the background, voyage, sinking, aftermath, and re-discovery, this tells it all and much more. The most fascinating part to me, that had been largely under-reported, was the investigation on both sides of the pond after the sinking and the survivors testimony. It was reported back then that the ship had indeed broken in half during the sinking, yet it still went unnoticed by Hollywood until Cameron's film. I'm assuming that the special fx were impossible to create that on film prior to 90's technology...I think Cameron had mentioned that he waited until he could ""do it right"" before he did his version of the sinking. The in depth coverage of the recovering of the passengers was also fascinating, some turning up thousands of miles away months after the sinking. If you are interested in the complete story this is all you'll need, other than the book that documents the written inquest in the US & UK just days after the sinking (I can't think of the title, but it' stunning testimony).

186595,5,156501345X,"Back in the mid-1990's, this documentary came out as a box set in VHS format and I just HAD TO HAVE IT, so I got it for Christmas from the woman I was married to at the time and I made it a point to watch it at least twice a year or whenever the urge hit me.  Then when I got a DVD player in 2002 for Christmas, I found This DVD in the store, it was just sitting there and thought it was another knockoff documentary and wasn't about to spend any more money on Titanic Stuff that didn't shed any new light on the tragedy so I picked it up and to my delight, discovered it was the DVD version of the VHS box set I had at home so I scoffed it up and home I went with it and never looked at the VHS version again, as a matter of fact, I sold it for pittance to a friend of mine just to get it out of my VHS collection, which I had begun to shrink now that I could convert everything to DVD...ANYWAY, first thing I noticed about this presentation is that they edited it from 4 parts to 2 parts and the effort was quite seamless, you really can't tell where they did this and I was happy about that. aside from a tiny beef I have which I will get to in a minute, this, like the Titanic, was ""A truly fine Job"".  The stories that the survivors tell, as well as the commentators, leave you with a lump in your throat if you have any emotions at all.  To feel what those people felt that night must've been horrific being stuck out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean with no ship underneath you and no help from anywhere in freezing water.

My one and only beef about this documentary and it's not about the documentary itself but the special feature: BEYOND TITANIC on the other disc, now if all of you are Titanic Fanaticsa like I am, you have just about every Documentary and movie made on this great ship so if you have TITANIC (1953) with Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck, you have yet still another copy of BEYOND TITANIC, it's a small Beef but thought I would pass it on anyway.

I give this Documentary Five Stars and would highly reccomend it as the definitive documentary about The Titanic.  It is sad to say that most of the survivors shown in this presentation have since passed away, the only last living survivor of The Titanic as of this writing is Millvina Dean, who has had to sell most of her Titanic Memorabilia to pay for medical expenses, poor lady.",1240531200,3,2364,4.117136659436008

186597,2,156501345X,"I was severely disappointed in the documentary of the Titanic.  How could you possibly talk about the Titanic without even mentioning the Carpathia.  That ship was probably the most important facet of the story.  Without her there would have been more lives lost.  For such a dramatic story this documentary had such an anticlimatic ending.  Then I can't stand those interviews from the alleged survivors.  First of all they were babies at the time so they would have no memory of this event.  They probably were told stories from their mothers on what happened which would be second hand information.  The writers of this documentary should have spent more time talking about the important role the Carpathia played in this event than wasting their footage on the interviews.  The captain of the Carpathia was extraordinary.  Some of the things he did to prepare for the survivors as well as making the ship move as fast as possible went down in history.  Also another facet of the story was left out was the Californian that had made so many mistakes which cost the lives of 1500 people.  Which brings up another point.  The documentary never even mentioned about the lives lost, how many saved, what laws were change to prevent future maritime disasters.  Instead they spent too much time on the interviews.  If you want to view an accurate account of this disaster buy ""A Night To Remember"" because on the DVD is an illustrated version and they explain everything that happened without stupid interviews.",1213056000,6,1508,4.881889763779528

I love the 1997 film, but I knew very little about the real story of the Titanic.

This set is a fantastic introduction to anyone who wants to know more about the Titanic and needs a starting point.

Each of the 3 DVDs is informative and interesting.

It was chilling to see and hear the survivors of the disaster and to hear interviews of leaders of the search for the wreckage and the authors of books.

I also love the paintings of the disaster.  They are beautiful and seem to bring that fateful night to life!

I strongly recommend this series for any interested adult like me or for educational purposes.

186603,5,156501345X,"The Titanic is a compelling film about the real life story of H.M.S. Titanic. The story is detailed and moving and provides Titanic lovers with a perspective of the agony and suffering that passengers of this great ship endured during its last moments. For those interested in maritime safety or just interested in knowing the story behind the Titanic tragedy, this is a highly recommended movie.

For those not familiar with the history of this great liner, a brief narration may help. The Titanic was launched in Belfast in May 1911. A magazine at the time described it as ""practically unsinkable"".

The liner was impressive in its size and features. She was 269 metres long, 28 metres wide and as tall as an eleven storey building. The luxury of the ship was unique and unparalleled at the time. Among the luxury features was a swimming pool for first class passengers, the first to be built on a liner.

The Titanic set sail from Southampton on 10 April 1912. On 14 April 1912, a look out man sounded the alarm bells and announced an iceberg just ahead of them. Unfortunately, it was too late and the ship collided with the iceberg and within some few seconds, the starboard side of the liner was torn open and seawater poured in.

Sadly, there were not enough lifeboats on board and only a small fraction of the passengers (largely those travelling first class) were rescued and almost all those in third class were not rescued. The ship's band continued to play during the commotion that followed and as the stern of the ship rose high and the ship began to sink. Over 1500 people perished in this accident.

Among the critical lessons that we learn from this tragedy is the need to have an effective safety management system. Thankfully, many of the lessons learnt in the tragedy helped the regulatory authorities, manufacturers and ship owners to come up with design and operational features that have made liners much safer.",1140480000,6,1933,4.75820895522388

I watched it with my son and have already repeated watching the second disc the very next day myself! It is awesome and really detailed. It is hard to believe some of the facts that had to do with the ""times"" such as class distinctions, also equally disturbing that even that as gallant as it was and appropriate in those times for ""women and children first"" to be saved, the tragedy left the rescued women instant widows in a time that was very difficult as it was pre-sufferget, also not to mention fatherless children and the horrible fact that most 3rd class passengers (if not all of them) perished, women, children and men.  They left no stone unturned in this presentation. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone really seeking facts about that night and the history and politics involved afterward, with the trials of Ismay and also Captian Lord (Captain from the ship accused of not responding to the Titanic's distress flares). It takes you from the beginning of the Titanic in Belfast Ireland to the sinking and rescue of the survivors in the life boats and bringing them to New York. There are personal quotes from passengers as written to loved ones and still photographs taken on the ship prior to the night of April 14th.  The show also includes footage of commentary from living survivors today, that add another dimension to the presentation, which makes it so much more real, as well as commentary from Titanic historians and book authors (one inparticular Walter Lord ""A Night To Remember"" who had interviewed survivors years ago before some of them passed away).  Then leads you up to the finding of the sunken ship in the 1980's. I think they covered it all. It is the most complete account in every way of anything I have seen or read on the Titanic so far.

186606,3,156501345X,"As a die-hard Titanicophile, I ordered this DVD based on the Amazon reviews. But I have to say I was dissapointed. The first two parts are 1994 documentaries, are quite dated in feel (music, use of models to illustrate sinking...) and suffer from a constant fade-in/out of images that gets quite annoying. Most of all, they don't linger long enough on some of the most interesting film footage - even though all of the moving footage of the Titanic was really the Olympic, it still makes for fascinating viewing as it shows pretty much exactly what the Titanic would have looked like in port - sadly, they fade in and out of these scenes very quickly in preference for photos that can be found in any decent Titanic biog. The third disc, a 1998 documentary by a different company, was much more interesting - covering some of the same ground but moving into a very interesting analysis of why the Titanic story seems to grip each new generation.

Basically, if you haven't read much on the Titanic or are new to the facts this is a good buy, but for those with a fairly thorough knowledge of the evens, this DVD seems a little like reading a book on a TV screen.",1109462400,11,1162,4.481132075471698

186609,5,156501345X,"I watch this DVD at least 3 times a week. It's really three two-hour documentaries, but the first two comprise one series and the third is it's own short film.
The first disc shows you everything about the voyage of the fateful liner, from it's infancy to it's fateful sinking and the legacy left afterward.
The second disc shows a great documentary about Titanic's affect on pop culture. I bet you never knew that the Titanic was featured in a Nazi propoganda film! I consider myself to be quite the Titanic fanatic, and the second disc taught me things I honestly never knew!
I HIGHLY recommend this DVD set to anyone interested in learning about the world's most famous ocean liner, and the legacy it's left. After watching this, you won't even be able to remember who James Cameron is!",1062633600,21,789,4.642857142857143
186610,5,156501345X,"As the cable network has shown in its highly successful ""Biography"" series, it knows how to chronicle the famous and the infamous.  This superb expose of the ill-fated 1912 voyage of the R.M.S. Titanic is as engrossing as anything ever done for the small or large screen.  As opulent in production as the seafaring vessel itself, the documentary leaves no stone untouched, from detail descriptions of the notable (and not so familiar) passengers and the stalwart crew to the legal and maritime ramifications following the tragedy. The makers of the film definitely spent many hours dissecting every inch of the story and present a thrilling and most informative treatise.

After viewing this mammoth presentation, it will be quite easy to forget the romanticized epic featuring the fictional ""Rose"" and ""Jack"".",1050624000,11,810,5.2153846153846155

This two disc set contains three 95 minute documentaries made in the 1990's containing archeive film footage, photographs, interviews with survivors, and excerpts from passengers notes and diaries read by a voice actor of the same age, gender, and class/area accent as the original writer.  Also included are: ""Timeline of Critical Events""; ""Biographies of Notable Passengers""; and an ""Essay on the History of the Tragedy as seen in Popular Culture"".
""Death of a Dream"".  1994  mono  95'42""  Introduces the plans for, and actual contruction and crewing policies for the Titanic and it's sister ships.
""The Legend Lives On"".  1994  mono  95'52""  Starts from the collision and continues with the aftermath in the press through to the investigative trials.
( Both of the above are narrated by David McCullum who acted in ""A night to Remember"" as the main radio operator ).
""Beyond Titanic"".  1998  stereo  94'06""  Looks at the continuing legacy and fascination with the Tianic's legend in books, television and film - from the 1917 silent movie through a Nazi semi-propaganda film from 1942, through Irwin Allen's ""Time Tunnel's"" premier episode to James Cameroon's film.  Also included are scenes from: the search, discovery, and reclaimation of items from the seabed of the actual site where Titanic currently rests.
Overall this collection is a quite satisfying overview of the Titanic, with pleasing original film and photographic inclusion, plus some montages of modern and original material.",1023062400,56,1651,5.3

7796451,5,156501345X,"There are so many commentators on Titanic history that sifting through the crowd of them can be vexing and exhausting. If you are looking for a basic studied history of Titanic without having to read too many books, this is THE BEST resource. This is, in fact, an expansion of the original A&E showing that saved me from misguided nonsense when James Cameron's film came out in skewed view. The documentary guides you from the conception of the vessel all the way to the reanimation of the history in modern times. Moreover, the choice of David McCallum as the narrator is no accident, as he portrayed ""Harold Bride"" in the film A NIGHT TO REMEMBER (the ONLY ""Titanic"" film to get direct input from a surviving officer). I can't say there is NO presumption in it, for it is nearly impossible to be entirely free from subjective interpretations. But the attempt is made to offer facts without too much speculation. For some time, it was difficult to get your hands on this video, but the 100th anniversary changed that, thankfully. My VHS recording of the A&E special couldn't last much longer.",1428364800,2,1093,4.727748691099476

I paid too much for it but being a Titanic enthusiast (my father's side of the family helped build her in Belfast, Ireland), I had to have another copy.  David McCallum is a great narrator, I think, and added to the enjoyment.",1428105600,,403,4.493150684931507

7796454,5,156501345X,"This is hands down one of THE best documentaries ever made about this doomed ship and the legend surrounding her passengers and crew.  It's hard to know where to start with the sheer quality of this production by A&E (although the DVD case says The History Channel, I distinctly recall the original VHS release of this doc was an A&E production).
The original 1994 documentary is in two parts with appropriately melodramatic titles.  ""Death of a Dream"" takes us through the ship's conception, construction, maiden voyage, life on-board ship, ice warnings, striking the iceberg, loading the lifeboats and ending just as the last lifeboat leaves the ship's decks.  ""The Legend Lives On"" picks up where we left off with wireless communique between land and sea as news of the ship's demise spreads, the efforts of the Carpathia to get to Titanic before she sank, the ship's awful last moments, the long cold night endured by survivors, the rescue by Carpathia, the arrival in New York, the American and British investigations into the disaster, the culpability of Captain Stanley Lord, whose ship was undeniably within sight of the Titanic as she sank, Dr. Ballard's search for the wreck and it's discovery in the late 1980s, surveying the wreck as it was at the time of discovery and efforts to preserve the wreck and the memory of this terrible disaster.
All I can say is that every other documentary on any other subject I watch can't even touch the production values of this documentary. Scenes are recreated with period pictures over filmed footage of actual places, memories of passengers are read by great voice actors.  Many survivors alive at the time of filming were interviewed, to say nothing of the historians, biographers, and oceanographers amassed to give mountains of information about the Titanic, her world, her passengers, and her wreck.  The music by Christopher Stone swings from evocative, light, and nostalgic to eerie, chilling, and heartbreaking.  The narration by actor David McCallum (who played wireless officer Harold Bride in the 1958 Titanic movie ""A Night to Remember"") is phenomenal.  An additional shorter documentary made in 2002 called ""Beyond Titanic"" does an fine job charting all the pop culture depictions of the disaster in song, film and TV from the lost silent film made about the disaster mere months after it happened right up to the legendary James Cameron epic.  The narration of this one is done by actor Victor Garber who portrays Thomas Andrews in the James Cameron film, with some historians and the last living survivor at the time of the documentary.
If I have any gripes it is that this documentary is now over twenty years old.  Not that the story of the Titanic has changed that much... all the survivors are gone, the wreck has deteriorated further, and science has gone a little farther in explaining the disaster.
If you want an encyclopedic account of this most famous maritime disaster, this is it and will be so for all of time!",1422230400,,2988,4.936254980079681
