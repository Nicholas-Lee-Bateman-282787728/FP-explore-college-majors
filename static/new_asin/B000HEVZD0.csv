8139096,2,B000HEVZD0,"Not the best vintage ""B"" mystery movie...too much of the brash personalities of amateur detectives of the era...Protagonists run a bail bond agency. Not really a good buy.",1462060800,,171,5.142857142857143
8139097,5,B000HEVZD0,"This is a fun movie made in 1944 involving 2 bail bonds individuals, a presumed embezzler and murder.  The variety of characters in this movie is great as well as trying to figure out who the killer is.  I tend to like movies like this that provide me what I call true entertainment without profanity, sex or over the top violence (blood & guts) being displayed.  If a good script, good acting and a movie that doesn't need shocking sensationalism are for you, then I think you will enjoy this movie.",1353369600,12,500,4.472527472527473
