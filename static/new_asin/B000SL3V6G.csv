8205751,3,B000SL3V6G,"This is a pretty fair overview of the Sherman and those interviewed have a pretty fair knowledge of the tank. The program starts with WWI (briefly) and the US lack of interest in tanks in the post-WWI era. It then proceeds with the US rush to catch up with modern armored trends. There is discussion of the M-3 Lee/Grant series and how this led to the M4 Sherman. The chapters on the Sherman cover North Africa, Italy and Normandy. Unfortunately, there is no discussion on the war past Normandy. Nor do they dwell much on the later production models. They also do not mention much about the efforts to improve the Sherman's antitank capability other than a brief section on the British Firefly. It was nice to hear the oft-repeated myth about the gasoline causing the Sherman to burn not being promoted. They correctly point out the problem was with the ammunition. There was a very nice discussion about the DD Shermans and why these swimming tanks did not perform well at Normandy. They also briefly discuss Sherman variants.

While there is good information, it does have some problems. (1) There is too much generalization about the tank. All models are lumped together when they discuss speed, range, etc. For example, they assert that the Sherman had up to 100mm of armor. This is only true of the M4A3 and later models, which had 108mm of armor on the lower front hull. Earlier models had less. (2) There is the usual misplaced footage that seems to plague documentaries, i.e. showing a late model Sherman while discussing Tunisia. (3) They actually managed to invert the image of an M-3 Grant giving the false impression that the turret was on the right and the gun was on the left. (4) Someone who is not knowledgable about the Sherman might be confused by the freely interspersed images of the M-3 Lee's and M-10 tank destroyers. (5) The tank experts were confused about wet stowage. They seemed to think this was a field modification and that the ammunition continued to be stowed up high in the sponsons. Actually, this was factory installed and the ammunition was relocated to the lower hull in the later M4A3 and all 76mm armed Shermans. When the expert also stated that the purpose of wet stowage was to douse ammunition fires, I had to cringe. The purpose was to prevent hot spalling from igniting the ammunition...once a cordite fire starts you cannot douse it. (6) They also confused the T14 heavy tank with the uparmored Sherman Jumbo. The T14 was a joint Anglo-American project that was cancelled in 1944. The Jumbo (M4A3E2) was a modified Sherman intended to attack fortifications. The Jumbo had between 6 and 7 inches of armor. (7) They overrate the German Pz IV, which was not a better vehicle than the Pz III. It was larger hence it could be upgunned to a high velocity 75mm gun. This meant the Pz IV could continue in service whereas the smaller Pz III could not. (8) They assert that the main US tank at Kasserine Pass was the M-3 Lee. While some Lee's were present, the Sherman had replaced them for the most part.

Overall, this is a nice generalization of the Sherman which has piqued my interest in the rest of the series.",1237161600,,3152,4.657091561938959
