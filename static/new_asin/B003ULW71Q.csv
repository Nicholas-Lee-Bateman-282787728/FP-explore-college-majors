4204556,5,B003ULW71Q,"How in the world did I miss this guy? Well, I think it's because I stayed away from the dvds with Biggest Loser marketing.  My loss.  Bob kicks a**!! I love Pure Burn Super Strength! Definately not for the faint of heart. This has to be one of the best strength workout dvds ever - IMO.  There are two workouts:

Workout 1 - One hour full-out (a little over an hour including warm up & cool down)

Workout 2 - 20 min. beginner workout

You need weights. I used 3lbs & 5lbs, however, will use 8 lbs next workout. Obviously, men will use heavier weights to start out with. Bob says up to 12 lbs...but for guys, I would think higher. If you have hard floors, you'll also need a mat.

BREAKDOWN - WORKOUT 1

Warmup

Squats with weights
Pushups
Bicep curl to shoulder press

Squats w/ weights - increase speed, then hold...BURNS!
Down & Outs - add push up
Pushups then go halfway down - hold

Bicep curl w/ shoulder press
Down & Outs - pushups
Fast Shoulder presses then hold....

Back Rows - then pulses
Deadlifts

Right leg in front - bent over rows
Arm Raise Combo - Front, Side, and Posterier pinky up side
Hold arms out to side - 3x

Left leg in front - bent over rows
Arm Raise Combo
WATER BREAK!! MUCH NEEDED =)

Holding one weight only - lunge forward
Pass weight under leg, back & forth
Bent over (squat) single arm fly - working deltoid
Repeat on opposite leg, and opposite single arm fly
Alternating lunges, then lunge jumps!

HALFWAY THRU

Bicep Curls - Bob points out not to worry about bringing weight all the way up. Helpful tip, felt a difference.
Squat position w/ elbows right above knees - little bicep curls
Tricep Extensions

DOWN TO FLOOR
Skull Crushers
Chest press (keep elbows close to focus on triceps)
Crunches - regular crunches, crunches with arms reaching out to sides of legs - then pulse, arms back behind head & raise one leg (knees at same heigth), switch legs while continuing to crunch, then both legs up
Back to standing

Single leg (balance) while doing hammer curls, switch legs continue with curls
Supination Extensions - forward extensions & side extensions, then squat down & do side supination extensions. OUCH.
Continue in squat position, put arms down...hold, then weighted jump squats, finish the burn with more weighted chair squat!

Tricep Extensions
Floor - Skull Crushers, Chest Press, Crunches w/ legs extended
Roll over to Plank position for Weighted Plank Rows
Weighted T-Stands - pushup w/ T-stand, T-stand each side, then pushups w/ T-stand again - Seriously Hurting
Hold Plank Position

Stand up begin Matrix Lunges
Matrix Lunges (holding one weight) - lunge forward, lunge side, lunge back (pay attention to the back lunge, form is unique)
Standing Weighted Pullovers
Matrix Lunges on other leg
Iso Arms - hold arm straight out, then arm out to side palm down, front, side...repeat iso arm other side
WATER BREAK

On floor in plank position on forearms.  Raise/lower hips, then twist hips side to side for twisting plank
Press up to straight plank, back down on elbows, up, down, up, down, up..really it is torture
Side Knee Plank - bring knee to elbow, other side, then go really fast!
COOL DOWN

WORKOUT 2 - 20 min

turn on back for crunches
Hold crunch & lift leg up..switch legs

COOLDOWN

Fransisco, Helen, and Stephanie are the lucky exercise talent.  Stephanie modifies for those who need to lighten up a bit because it gets TOUGH!  Bob does an excellent job explaining form, cueing, and pushing you to the next level. I highly recommend this DVD!! It would be tough for beginners.  I think intermediate to advanced fitness levels will appreciate this workout.  You absolutely must get this workout!!

Please leave a comment if you have any questions =)",1280448000,426,4344,4.701058201058201
4204557,5,B003ULW71Q,"This series, and this DVD in particular, are simply awesome.  Bob pushes you further than you think you can possibly go, and then he pushes you some more.  This series is intense.  The strength DVD includes a 20 minute ""beginner strength"" workout that prepares you for what's next -- an hour long strength session that makes you sweat, burn mad calories and works your muscles like never before.  It includes some jump training to ensure your heart rate is up for maximum results.  The hour long strength is definitely not for a beginner, so don't be discouraged if you can't do it the first time.  Simply put, if this series doesn't get you fit, nothing will!

I also recommend the other DVDs -- Cardio Conditioning and Yoga for the Warrior.",1278979200,11,742,4.661538461538462

4204559,5,B003ULW71Q,"Best workout in my vast collection!  Bob Harper workouts are the best and hardest.  Wont waste your time.  This workout is grueling and is why I have real tone in my arms!  I also love Body Rev, Extreme Cardio, and Total Body in his collection.",1460505600,,244,4.355555555555555
4204560,5,B003ULW71Q,"I've been doing this workout (the hour-long one) for the last month, and I love it.  In the past I've been a fan of Jillian Michaels, but she just makes her workouts too complicated in an effort to be creative.  I don't want to have to figure out a complicated move just to be moving on to the next one in 10 seconds.  In this DVD, Bob is direct and tough, but you don't feel like you're being screamed at.  The moves are effective and fairly simple.  It's probably the only workout DVD I have that I can honestly say I get as good a workout (or better) than I would at the gym.  The video editing is pretty awful, but if you can get past that, it's a great exercise routine.",1458172800,,675,4.075757575757576

4204562,4,B003ULW71Q,"This is my second Bob video......wow..... it's tough.  I modify it a bit to suit my needs and take some extra drink breaks, but it is still extremely challenging.  Good one for hard core weight training.",1455753600,,203,4.611111111111111
4204563,3,B003ULW71Q,"It is a pretty decent workout.  However, I don't like Bob's style.  I never had a problem working hard.  But I don't want to be reminded every second that I have to suffer and feel pain.  Also, for older folks, it can be hard on the wrists.",1454112000,2,240,4.042553191489362
4204564,5,B003ULW71Q,"I give a lot of five star reviews for DVDs because I have yet to find a DVD that is not effective in some way.  This DVD is very effective.  I saw a ton of definition in my arms and in my shoulders after this DVD.  Bob also likes to work quads.  He incorporates some cardio exercises to bring the heart rate up.  As usual with Bob, for some reason, he's really obsessed with shoulders?  By the end, my shoulders are screaming--but I saw some beautiful definition.  My issue with this DVD is the same issue that a lot of people have--the ridiculous, goofy, over-the-top screaming from the people in the videos.  Bob is sadistic and not very likable in this video.  I get tough love, but he's tough love to the point of abuse here.  I also don't enjoy how he does certain moves to the point of absolute total and complete misery and exhaustion to the point where I can't maintain form and feel beaten down.  I like Jillian's method of 30 seconds to a minute--where there's an end in sight.  With Bob, there doesn't seem like there's an end at times.  Also, the end of this DVD is one of the dumbest things I've ever seen.  Bob has one of his assistants do a side knee plank at an absolutely INSANE pace that I feel like no one in their right minds could actually achieve.  Uh, Bob, if I could do that, I'd be off being an Olympic athlete, not doing a work out DVD.  So when I get to the end of the DVD I slowly did the side knee plank, rolling my eyes at Bob's screaming and his wailing assistant.

But I do believe this DVD is worthwhile.  You will see results, you just might want to mute it.

So basically, five stars for results--three stars for Bob.  Hopefully he knows that we never want to see anything like this again!",1452556800,2,1724,4.230061349693251
4204565,2,B003ULW71Q,"Ugh. I hate giving this video two stars because it had so much potential to be a great workout! But the trainers he has in the video seem just utterly miserable and dejected?? I feel like he does little to encourage good form and spends a lot of the video screaming at his trainers that they're not allowed to stop, which like. If people need to stop and take care of themselves, they should! It was very distracting.

I dunno. I enjoy working out and would rather watch people who feel the same way. I hate watching videos where the pressure seems to be all about getting the perfect body or whatever. I feel like your number 1 focus in any workout should be taking care of yourself, followed by getting an excellent workout.

The other thing that bugged me is that he seems to touch the women more often than necessary and it doesn't really seem to serve that much of a purpose? Idk but if some dude (or anyone really) was getting that close to holding my a** I would be so uncomfortable, whether I was being paid to be in a video or not.

Anyway, this video does deliver. My arms are literally shaking right now, in a good way, which I think is contributing to my frustration. I'd like to incorporate this type of workout into my weekly routine but I'm p*ssed off enough I'm probably going to have to look elsewhere.",1450915200,3,1319,4.353658536585366
4204566,1,B003ULW71Q,"Have enjoyed Jillian Michaels workouts and wanted something different so  was excited to give this a try.  I can't get past the pathetic helpers he is using that can't seem to make it through the workout without slacking off.  Only one out of three consistently demonstrates proper form and left me feeling embarrassed by their poor stamina.  Sexual sounding grunting and moaning over reps?  Come on, I want a workout with real people who actually know how to workout.  Very disappointing.",1450051200,4,489,4.9753086419753085
4204567,3,B003ULW71Q,"It's a decent workout but he doesn't incorporate any cardio so if you are looking for a mix of cardio/strength this is not the video for you. He focuses a lot on arms in the Super Strength portion. Also there is a problem with the sound, I have to turn my volume up all the way just to barely hear it. I tried to notify the seller but it's past the ""return date"" so I guess i'll just have to live with it.",1449878400,,405,3.891566265060241

4204577,2,B003ULW71Q,Too hard & complicated.  Why do so many celebrity trainers overthink exercise?,1435363200,,78,5.5
4204578,5,B003ULW71Q,"I haven't done many of Bob Harper's videos (only Ultimate Cardio Body, Totally Ripped Core, and this) but this is definitely my favorite. Unlike a number of other DVDs that focus on strength, this one really works your muscles AND gets your heart rate up. I've done nearly all of Jillian Michaels' workout DVD's but the burn from this surpasses all of hers. (In a way, it's similar to the burn you feel doing Insanity but it's burn from working your upper body muscles.)  Part of this is because it is an hour long workout (and Jillian's are geared more towards 30-45 minutes) but another part is that seemingly easy exercises (like mini bicep curls) start to burn because Bob combines them with other movements AND keeps you working them for several minutes at a time.

This is a great workout for all levels of exercise. It is most definitely challenging even for those who are extremely fit: the people in the background working with Bob are drenched in sweat and their faces are in pretty obvious pain. For people who aren't in as of great shape, go lighter on the weights and you'll still have a killer workout.

This workout left me plenty sore the next day and it really pushed me to my limit. I totally recommend it!",1435017600,,1224,4.554545454545455

4204580,5,B003ULW71Q,"One of my favorites! I've had this DVD for a long time now and I keep going back for more. I still find it challenging and I have to modify some of the exercises to accommodate new aches and pains, but it's helped get me and keep me in shape for years now. I just use some common sense and caution-I'm not as young as the people in this! Don't skimp on the warm up or cool down!!",1431475200,,379,3.871794871794872
4204581,5,B003ULW71Q,"Haven't done the short workout, but the Hr long one is good. You will sweat and your shoulders will be sore and get muscular. If you are a woman and don't want a muscular look, you can use light weights and just tone.",1429833600,,217,4.069767441860465
4204582,4,B003ULW71Q,"While he's supposed to be the ""nice"" one, he's just an evil evil man.  The workout is intense and making it through the entire hour is both an endurance nightmare and muscular torture.
It's a great workout but you do need to have some level of physical fitness to make it through the entire thing.  Often I find myself hitting the 40 minute mark and saying, 'That's enough for tonight'.  Right around the 19 minute remaining mark get ready for a flurry of activity that should leave you winded and probably needing to modify in order to get through.

If you are going to buy one of his DVD's i would recommend buying a variety.  It does get old hearing the same jokes over and over again.",1429660800,,688,4.3858267716535435
4204583,3,B003ULW71Q,"This DVD is pure strength. That is very true. However, I find there is WAY too much arm strength training going on and not so much legs and abs. Yes, I feel my legs and abs some, but the arm work over powers it, which I'm not too fond of. Maybe it's just me, but that's what it seemed like. He does work the abs and legs though, it just doesn't seem like as much as arms. I mean, there are a lot of arm workout variations, and just when I think we are done working arms...there we go again! Frankly, my arms are completely toned, I don't need to focus too much on them. I rather feel more burn in my legs and my abs. Abs especially because that has always been my problem area. All in all, it's ok, but it's definitely not one of my favorites. I do prefer Jillian. I have to say though, you will get a good work out and you will be sweating, but the too much arm strength training kind of turns me off.",1428796800,,902,3.9615384615384617

4204585,4,B003ULW71Q,"I was skeptical upon reading the many critical reviews of this workout DVD but decided to purchase based on reading one of the positive reviews from someone that has been doing the P90X workouts and maintained that this workout was on that level. I was pleasantly surprised when I jumped into the workout that it was definitely a high intensity workout as long as you pushed yourself to keep up with the program's pace. In my opinion this is for seasoned home workout fans that both already stress proper form on their own (not relying on the DVD trainer) and know how to push themselves and keep pace with the program. Bob stresses form at the beginning of each set and then pushes the person to squeeze out additional reps to failure where appropriate. As a veteran of both P90X classic and P90X3 many times over, I liked this workout overall and will use it on days where I want something different. I gave it 4 starts instead of 5 because it didn't stress chest or leg strength as much as I'd like for a full-body workout AND I think they could have squeezed this program into a 60 minute session - this felt about 10 to 15 minutes too long.",1428451200,,1145,4.431279620853081

I need to be able to see what the participants are doing, their form, etc., and follow along.  The camera work makes it difficult to do that.

4204600,5,B003ULW71Q,"I work out hard every day in my home gym.  I love doing workout dvds.  I do all the beach body videos and many others.  I love to mix things up to add variety and to use different muscle groups and workouts for better results.  I decided to give this dvd a try and I was very happy that I did.  I got a good hard workout.  I love using weights too.  Bob Harper gets on you to keep going and not to give up.  That's why I love dvds rather than just go workout on my own.  I need the push and motivation to make it through all those push ups and weight lifting excersises.  You know when it burns and you want to quit but won't because you see the team on the dvd dying with you and they are still sweating through it and moaning. Bob Harper gets on his crew and pushes them to keep going, not taking no for an answer.  I think this dvd is great for advanced people.  You can increase your weights.  Of course, if your just starting out, they show you how you can still get a good workout without weights and modify the excersises for your fitness level.  I have spent a lot of money on exercise dvds.  I do use each and every one of them but it was nice to find this one on Amazon at a great price  and great quality.  The quality was equal to many of the beach body dvds like p90X.  Bob spoke like a true trainer, which he is.",1418688000,3,1326,3.9210526315789473

4204605,5,B003ULW71Q,"First, a little background about me since I find it helpful when I read reviews for exercise DVDs: 40-year-old man who's in good shape and would be considered intermediate to advanced. I workout and run (a little) six to seven times a week. I can keep up with the performers in these videos.

I enjoyed the yoga DVD from Bob Harper's Inside Out Method series so I picked up both the cardio and strength workouts as well.  This workout leans towards being more of a cardio with weights workout than pure strength training.  In my opinion, it is comparable to P90X3's CVX, Supreme 90's Total Body, and Rushfit's Strength and Endurance workouts if you are familiar with those (although harder than all of them due to the duration).  There are some isolation moves such as bicep curls, but you don't have time to swap out weights so don't expect to do reps at your max like you would in a P90X workout.  The pace is fast and there are a lot of reps so you'll get a great workout with a smaller weight.  I use 15lbs and it is plenty.  At sixty-six minutes, the workout is hard and I feel pretty spent at the end, which is a good thing.  It's definitely not a workout I'd repeat every day, but I usually get this workout into my rotation once of twice a month and that keeps it fresh.  All-in-all it's great and has become one of my favorites for days in which I really want to challenge myself.

Things I like:
Fast paced - no standing around talking.
Lot of reps with a smaller weight - this adds variety when compared to my other workouts.
Bob does a good job of moving things along.  He's not always the most positive instructor, but I don't mind that.  He's tough and throws a lot of challenging work at you.
It's difficult - nothing watered down here.
Price - for less than $10 it is a bargain.  In addition to the Inside Out Method DVDs, I've also purchased Bob's Skinny Rules set and have been pleasantly surprised at the asking price - well worth it.

Things I don't like:
Bob's tough guy speech in the beginning.  I just cut it out, as I convert my workout videos to play off a USB stick on Roku, but it's somewhat irritating.
The artsy video editing that occurs a few times.  I'm not looking at my TV constantly so it's not a big deal, but I don't see the need for it.
One of the background performers, Francisco, takes a break a few times when Bob turns his back - kind of like a little game.  I didn't find it motivating to see one of the performers not working.

Also of note is that there is very little talk about form.  I really don't mind this since I am experienced in almost all of these moves and it would slow things down, but this is something to be aware of.  This really isn't for beginners, it pretty such assumes that you know what you are doing.

There is a slower paced 20-minute workout on the DVD as well.  It's actually not bad and I combine it with the 20-minute workout on the cardio DVD on days I'm looking for something a little easier.

The negatives here are very minimal and this has become one of my favorite difficult workouts that I use fairly regularly.",1413331200,2,3090,4.307958477508651

Almost too long. a 40 minute version would've been perfect. In summary, the DVD is well worth the money and is challenging.

Bob doesn't let you quit and stays on your butt. I thought it was funny that the guy in the video couldn't keep up with Helen. That girl kicks ass!

I initially did the beginner 25 min workout (which I recommend for strength training beginners, or if you're new to his videos and you want to test the waters before the hour-long workout). After that, I was sweating and slightly sore the next day. A few days later, I pushed myself to do the hour-long and could only make it half way - and I was definitely feeling it for the next couple days.
I will be doing just half the video at a time (first half today, second half in two days) until I can make it through the whole thing. I think this is a great dvd for muscle building, but not for the faint of heart! Bob relentlessly keeps you moving. His instruction style is fine by me, he doesn't scream at you like a drill sergeant but he definitely pushes you to keep going.

AFter about 4 or 5 months of working out to this DVD,  I have actually gotten compliments from friends while attending a pool party a few months ago about how much muscle definition was in my shoulders and arms that did not exist before.  My advice is to be patient, don't get frustrated if you can't finish it the first few weeks.  You want to try to do as much as you can without stopping or resting.

I'm fairly fit (workout every day for an hour or so) and love all kinds of exercise from running to spinning to the old Jane Fonda VHS tapes (I still have one).  BUT my favorites are the Gilad series and now, Bob Harper.  Like Jillian, too.  All the last three really help to achieve functional fitness that is important for real life.  Yesterday, I was encouraging a sick dog to eat and stayed in a squat position for two minutes holding her food bowl to make it easier for her to eat.  Could NOT have done this prior to Gilad and Jillian.  This particular DVD of Bob's is a great, tiring workout.  He pushes and pushes and I was determined to do the whole hour and did (but modified some of the moves at the end).  He uses pretty much all muscle groups AND gets your heart pumping, too, if the workout is hard for you.  Just bought three more of his DVDs- liked the exercise variety, style, prompting that much.  ???real people do the workout on the DVD (Bob doesn't) and they do struggle- could that be a comfort of sorts???  Will keep doing these more challenging workouts on alternate days and mix them up with other fitness activities (a good idea to do that no matter what you do).",1381017600,2,1229,4.2956521739130435

I'm an average 40ish year old husband and father of 2, who with his beautful wife has decided to make a change for the better.  That being said, I think this DVD is an excellent, extremely difficult, workout that I think is going to help me make the changes that I'm looking for.

Bob is a very engaging instructor, not overbearing, but motivating in the right way.  His workout partners all seem to be real people, not perfect in every move, not breezing through the workout, and not just ""putting on"" for the camera.  This workout is so tough that I believe their responses are accurate and realistic.  Granted I couldn't keep up with the pace that most of them were doing, but the beauty of it is that I didn't have too.  Each exercise set is long enough that if I was behind a bit it didn't matter.  I'm hoping to work up to being able to maintain the pace but I do realize that it will take time.  I was able to make it through the 60+ minute workout even though I almost gave up at the halfway point.

Each of the exercises are well explained and demonstrated by either Bob or one of his assistants, one of which does each one in the ""desired"" way, or by the other ""modifier"" who demonstrates how you can ease it up a bit.  It was good for the soul to see the assistants struggling like I was.

All in all I found this to be an excellent DVD and I'm looking forward to doing the other 2 Bob Harper's that I got, Totally Ripped Core, and Cardio Conditioning.",1377216000,,1654,4.150470219435737

I love that even the training assistants (whatever they are called) struggle with you. I  can't wait to workout tonight with the full version. I have to also say this worked my lower back like nothing I've ever done. I currently used the firm and beachbody workouts and Bob takes it to a whole new level.

At the end he works abs real good but I personally prefer to do abs earlier so I can do quality work, before I'm tired. That would be my only comment to this DVD.

on a side note....who is the chick who is supposed to be the modifier?  i really do not want to see her face contorting again.  goodness.!!! and the guy?  buddy.....you shouldnt even be in this video.  even i did better than you!!!

Each of the Insanity sets came with a strength workout, but in my opinion, this workout is more strenuous on the arms than any of those.  Part of the reason could be that I used 12 pound weights for most of the workout, but there were exercises where I had to drop to 10 and even 5 (like the straight arm holds).  I can honestly say that I didn't want to lift my arms at all by the end of the workout.

This workout is so sick the people working out with him in the video are dying! If you are looking for cardio & strength in a challenging workout. This is it! My only peeve about it is Bob is shouting out commands like he is a commander in Navy seal bootcamp training (he even criticizes the only guy saying ""keep up with these girls!"" but I notice he is hardly doing any of the exercises himself and when he does finally do some of them, his counting is much more accurate. I notice when he is not doing them he holds on to the count down much longer. Also, this is about 65mins long.

Some of the moves in this dvd are really tough, the push-up t-stand, those are hard!  Maybe for the very athletic it's not so hard.
The one thing I have to say, and each time I do the dvd, it's bugging me a little more...the faces the one girl makes.  I do appreciate that they are working HARD, and sweating like crazy, and I don't expect them to be all perky and laughing.

Just when you think you're done, you're doing something more difficult. The shorter workout is also great when you are short on time. Bob will make you sweat in that little bit of time! I would not recommend this for beginners. If this was one of the first workout DVDs I had ever tried, I probably would have quit.

4204693,5,B003ULW71Q,"I've been doing some intensive exercise nearly every day now for quite some time, I've done the P90X series many, many times over and over as well as the Insanity DVD's.  I exercise twice a day 99% of the time.

And yet this ""Bob Harper's Inside Out Method Pure Burn Super Strength"" was and is still damn hard!

It's part of a series of four DVD's called ""Inside out Method"" by Bob Harper.  There's Bob Harper's Inside Out Method Pure Burn Super Strength, Bob Harper's Inside Out Method Yoga for the Warrior, Bob Harper's Inside Out Method Cardio Conditioning, and Bob Harper's Inside Out Method Bob's Workout.

In case you're not familiar with Bob he's a personal trainer (one year older than I) who's probably best known from the The Biggest Loser TV series.  He has a massive amount of DVD's and books out including his own stuff as well as The Biggest Loser series.

I like the dude - he can be a hard-ass but he's fair, enthusiastic, and seems intensely interested in helping you get through the workouts.  The guy's in great shape, tats and all.

Previously we had done a few of his The Biggest Loser DVD's, though that was earlier in our exercise progression and those tend to be a big easy for us now.

When I got the chance to try Bob Harper's Inside Out Method Pure Burn Super Strength I jumped right into it.

This seems to be geared toward weight training, but as I mentioned below - there's a lot more to it than that.

Bob Harper really shows his personality in this one, maybe a bit more than I've seen him do in other DVD's.  He's sometimes a bit amusing and amused, sometimes a little playful.  But he's also a bit more of a hard-ass in this too.  And before the workout begins he tells you right off the bat; hey, you always say you want Bob Harper as a trainer, well, you're getting him!

And he proceeds to prove it!

In the main workout, over an hour-long, he keeps right on the tail of the very fit woman, Helen, who is the one he calls his athlete, the one who does everything without breaks and without modifications.  All three of the people with him in this video are in great shape of course, but Helen; whom he mentions has had four kids (!) and looks incredible, is the one he makes do EVERYTHING without mods.

And when she tries to take a break or not do something as intensely he is ON her!  She glares, gives him a dirty look, she gasps, she moans, sometimes she even screams and there may even be a half-sob at a few points.  But she does what he asks of her.

Francisco, the only guy in the hour-long video; is muscular and in-great-shape but he gets away with taking breaks, and skipping a few things here and there.  I imagine he's there to show that that is an option if it's too much for you initially.

Stephanie is a tall, thin but in-shape `modifier' - in other words she does all of the exercises (unlike Francisco sometimes) but does modifications of them to make them slightly easier.  If there's a push-up, she may do it on her knees instead of fully up on her toes.  If a jump is combined with an exercise she stays on the floor.  And despite that she too grunts and groans and makes some pretty intense (sometimes terrible) faces.  There's a point where I think she's about to cry...

Bob does a lot of the exercises with them and is soaked in sweat along with everyone else, but he also walks around and motivates his people and makes sure they do things properly and with the intensity that he wants.  He's not annoying about it, but he keeps them on their toes, especially Helen.

Let me just stop here in the middle and say something...  I absolutely hate the gun-ho, screaming and yelling attitude that you might find in some of the lower quality exercise videos, or at your local high school gym, or where ever.  Maybe it helps to motivate some people, but I tend to think that a firm but not crazy over-the-top attitude is much better.

Bob does do a little yelling in this one.  Not much, and I've never seen him quite as intense as in this one.  But he's not over-the-top; he gets the motivation out of Helen that he needs.

You get two breaks in this workout, one near the beginning and one near the end.  And, well, there's a fake-out in the middle.

Recommended weights for this aren't high.  And it doesn't take long to realize that small amount of weights is all that you're going to be able to handle.

In addition to weight training you will get a little bit of everything else; some stretching, cardio, ab and core work.

Don't get me wrong - I like taking a day to concentrate on one aspect of exercise.  But a lot of times I like a nice varied multi-dimensional workout that covers a bit of everything.  And this is it.

There's stuff that I can barely hold together on even with moderate weights.  And the later core stuff is intensive!  There's even a few things here that I hadn't seen before, like the standing weighted pullovers (admittedly I'm no expert!).

Good stuff.  Again, you don't need much weight on this one and it's a good demonstration of what can be done with a small amount of weight instead of a lot, using repeition.

It is hard, but unlike something like Insanity where you really need to be in some damn good shape to carry it out - you should be able to do this workout by watching Stephanie with the modifications and/or not using weights at first, or a very low amount of weight.

Also on the disc is a twenty-minute workout.  It's much less intense but will still get you going.  Good for when you don't have much time or need an additional workout.",1358726400,3,5543,4.367546432062561
4204694,4,B003ULW71Q,"This is a tough workout. I consider myself fit and the first time I tried the full hour, I could not finish with the weights I normally use.

This is mainly a strength training workout but believe me, your heart rate will be up there and you will sweat.  Even his background trainers were struggling and I'm certain they weren't acting.

This one is awesome and a total butt-kicker.  I am an avid marathoner and exerciser and this DVD kicked my butt!

Jillian's DVDs tend to be more focused on a higher heart rate, where as this was focused more on strength with a moderately high heart rate.  If you are looking for killer cardio, this is not your DVD.  If you are looking for your legs and arms to scream in pain, THIS IS YOUR DVD.

4204699,4,B003ULW71Q,This is a good solid workout. It is long - 1hour 7 minutes. I usually can't fit it in before work. It is a hard workout for intermediate/advanced people.

I have exercised to many of Bob's, Jillian Michael's, and Billy Blanks Tae Bo dvd's, and Jillian Michaels is by far my favorite trainer.

4204707,5,B003ULW71Q,"I tried the one hour workout for the first time last weekend.  I used 5 pound hand weights and for the first 10 minutes or so I was cruising. I was doing multiple squats thinking ""this isn't very bad at all!"" And then, wham!  Suddenly, you're asked to hold weights while your muscles ache and quiver and sweat starts to trickle and then gush.  The format is really interesting and fun because one minute you're doing a lot of repetitions of a move, the next you're holding (and burning!) and then almost immediately on to something else entirely.  As it was my first time through I couldn't do absolutely everything in the DVD, but I ended feeling proud of myself for what I did accomplish, and looking forward to another torture session this weekend.  What I love most about this workout is it gives you plenty of room for growth- once you master all of the moves then all you need to do to make it uber challenging again is to use heavier weights.  I don't think I'll be ready for heavier weights anytime soon, though!  I even found muscles I didn't know I have (rear shoulders), and I can't think of this ever happening to me in any other DVD workout I've done.  I feel sure that I am going to be one lean machine once I get this workout under my belt!!",1352764800,,1256,4.337606837606837

4204710,5,B003ULW71Q,"This DVD is no joke. I've been doing it for a few months now -- it's my kick-butt Sunday workout in a 5- to 6-day-per-week regiment -- and I don't think it's ever going to get easier. Or, hell, manageable. It's hard. Really, really hard. And if it isn't hard for you, you're either doing it wrong or you're being a wuss about how much weight you're using.

My husband and I work out together and we react very differently to this workout, even though we both love it in the end because it's effective. The husband hears the ""Come on!! Do it!! Now do it again!!!"" and gets energized. I hear it and want to punch Harper in the face. But it's the kind of hate/anger that just fuels me to finish.

I have a bad back, so some modifications are required. For starters, I don't beat myself up for dropping to my knees for push-ups and plank variations because there are SO MANY of them that I must modify in order to keep proper form through the end. And I still feel it big time. In fact, once I let myself drop to my knees in the final killer plank series (hold plank, then lower/lift your abs, followed by swiveling your hips), I finally felt what Harper was going for. Before, I wasn't hitting the right spots. Proper form means you're doing it right. Eventually maybe I'll be able to stay up, but my back is bad for reasons other than a weak core, so we'll see. I'll still kill myself with the modifications -- in a good way.

After this workout, my shoulders kill, the back of my thighs, my butt, my triceps, my core and my delts. Today's particularly rough as yesterday I went up 2 lbs. for most of the routine. But then, every day after this routine is rough. It's a killer workout with good production value and a refreshing display of I'm-dyin'-here backup exercisers drenched in sweat. If any one of those jerks had been smiling ever in this workout, I might have tossed my TV out the window. At least I can see they're suffering, too.

I hate it. But it's been since mixing in this workout that I've broken through a plateau on the scale. I don't think that's a coincidence.",1351468800,6,2079,4.323076923076923

This workout kicked my ass-I don't even want to know what I am going to feel like tomorrow. The best way to describe it is high rep/low weight cardio. There are also a handful of isometric holds thrown in there that make you want to punch Bob in the face just for fun.  Unlike alternating weight training days with cardio days, this is kind of a one-trip-dip.  Very challenging and Bob is very motivating, intense and good with timing.

I can do P90X easily, and I also do a lot of Jillian so I thought this would be a challenge, but not as much of a challenge as it was. I had to quit during certain moves just to catch my breath and give my muscles a break and hop right back into it as fast as I could, it really gives your body a full work out and for the price, it's more than worth it.

It will really make you sweat -- you won't get through it the first time; don't worry -- you'll get better as you build muscle memory.  This workout is definitely more geared to upper body and abs -- there wasn't much lower body work here.  For lower body it's a few lunges with weights -- you can add the plyo move to make it more challenging.  There are also some matrix lunges and there are squats of course but really that's about it for legs.  That being said you are moving and burning calories the whole time though so don't let that put you off.  Any workout from Bob or Jillian done consistently is going to get you in sick shape.  I will definitely do this workout again; I loved it and Bob is very encouraging and challenging at the same time.  If you love a challenge, you'll love this.",1345075200,2,906,4.288235294117647

One is an hour long and the other 20 minutes. Currently, I do the hour workout M W F, and the lighter one on T and Th. This guy emphasizes good form throughout, always giving tips on how to do the exercise, and where your focus needs to be. Those verbal cues also mean you can follow along while not looking at the TV. I also like that you can scale this workout up or down based on the amount of weight you use. I use either no weights, a pair of 5 pounds, and/or a pair of 8 pounds. One of the class members does a slightly easier version of some of the exercises, which is good option when you're starting out. It's a serious workout but the vibe is light and Bob has good rapport with the 3-member class. I've used this workout consistently for 3 weeks now and my level of conditioning is really improving.

It's like Bob Harper is in your living room and your own personal trainer. He's motivating you to push harder and gives some great tips to improve your performance throughout the DVD.

I remember from the P90X DVDs that Tony would always say, ""Don't be a hero right away,"" or if you picked a weight that was too heavy, go get a lighter one. I have incorporated that into this workout. I started off with 5 lb weights and quickly went to 3 lbs so I could continue doing the exercises. If my legs felt like jelly, I'd get out of the squat, shake them out, and quickly go back into position.

You can definitely see that the other people in the DVD are working hard and struggling with the moves sometimes. It's refreshing to see these fitness models work as hard as I am.

If you want a change of pace from the Jillian Michael's DVDs or want to incorporate something else into your workout, I would definitely pick this one up!",1326412800,2,1029,4.293814432989691

Getting tired of P90x and looking for a change of pace.  I am fan of ""The Biggest Loser"", so I researched the Bob Harper dvds to see if they would be good change-up in routine.  Many of the reviews here said the Harper dvds are more difficult than P90x so I thought I should give 'em a try.  The reviews are dead on!  I purchased ""Inside Method Pure Burn Super Burn"", ""Inside Out Method Body Rev Cardio Conditioning"" and ""TOTALLY RIPPED CORE"" and I have tried each.  They are HARD!  ""Pure Burn Super Strength"" is different than any P90X workout in that is a total body workout.  You work on all the muscles while in P90x the strength workouts focus on specific muscles of the body.  My take is this workout puts more emphasis on cardio, endurance and burning calories than the P90x strength routines.  P90x puts more emphasis on strength building as it allows for less repetitions at greater weight.  ""Pure Burn Super Burn"" requires a lot of repetitions and therefore lesser weight.

I am looking to lose about 10 more pounds to get the lean muscular look I have never had.  I think the Bob Harper dvds will get me there quicker than P90x.",1326067200,3,1413,4.315589353612167

Bob (as gorgeous as ever) brings fantastic energy and he remains highly motivating throughout the entire routine. I do not agree with reviews that one of the girls has distracting facial expressions or that the intermittent freeze frames are annoying...frankly if you're noticing that for more than a second, you're not focusing on this excellent workout.

Who knows how many you are supposed to do, I can usually do either one rep of 20 or two reps of 20 in the time periods before he goes to the next exercise.

I have never watched this DVD with the sound on, so I can't comment about all the stupid things I can tell that he is saying, but a lot of time is wasted watching him talk.

Which what?! I mean, you listen to him talk the first time you do the DVD -- does anyone want to listen to him talk the second time?! Haven't you already heard it at that point?

Less talking more counting the reps, which he doesn't do as far as I can tell -- and that is one of the top things I am looking for in my weightlifting workout DVD.

The workout starts out with multiple cuts of Bob Harper in different positions and close-ups  -- hmmm... yeah that is helpful for me and well worth my time.

The video editing is terrible, rough, unbalanced cuts to this close up and that close up -- now in black and white -- yeah helpful, and motivating.
Sorry, about the sarcasm, no it is not.

The other reviewers are completely right, the grimaced faces of the ladies working out is too much to put up with -- and you know they are on their third cut of that workout to get that face. Those ladies are ripped, if it was the first round of those exercises they wouldn't be so pained. I find it patronizing, that in addition to other things such as: They show the participants drinking water during the ""water break""...... it's a DVD! -- I can just pause it when I need a water break! Seriously!
Ooooo close up of a lady drinking out of a green water bottle. Another patronizing waste of my time.

I bought this DVD because I am living in a remote area and don't have realistic access to a gym on a regular basis. I used to go to the gym all the time when I lived in civilization, the only thing I would use at the gym is the workout classes. Thus, I am familiar with structure of a work out instructor and what I want out of led workout.
I have been missing the gym and have a hard time remembering all the weight lifting moves/routines and what not I should be doing on my own, so I thought a DVD would help me out with what moves to do and keep me motivated to finish them all.

This DVD is something I could put up with if a friend gave it to me for free -- not worth paying for it.",1317945600,11,2497,4.04868154158215

4204750,4,B003ULW71Q,"Results for me after one week:  burned over 1000 calories over the 66 minutes, which is on the high end for me, jury still out on major muscle soreness/development. Lots of very true things being said in other reviews. Some observations I'll add/highlight:

 - Difficulty: The full routine is grueling (I have tried a couple times but can't do the whole thing). But the short routine is way too short (20 minutes including warm up and cool down! I ended up doing another video afterward). I wish there was a middle option to act as a standalone workout to start with. As it stands, there are areas where the bar is so high I don't even bother, and hope that over time I can work up to that challenge.

 - Cast: the exercisers are very ""real"" here, in the sense that you can tell Bob is destroying them through their facial expressions, sounds, and inability to perfectly keep up. Though it can be distracting at times to see someone give up when I'm thinking of doing the same, it's nice to not have smiling robots as I struggle through such a tough routine. Bob is generally likable but surprisingly mean at times. I think he could have been as effective without going that far but I'm getting over it. He is excellent at coaching on the right form which is to me the most important part of his job.

 - Workout structure: I would have preferred a bit more of a pattern, like a circuit 1-2-3 type of thing to help me feel some structure. It seems like I am just working on the next random thing Bob throws at me. I'm starting to feel that there are sort of natural segments every 20 minutes, but it would be nice if it was a little more explicit. That said you definitely get full coverage of strength, abs, and cardio (as long as you keep up the pace). As another point regarding structure, I did not like it that Bob never really gave a water break when he said he would the second time, he just said you can grab water while he keeps working the exercisers.

Overall I'm glad I got this DVD and I recommend it at such a great price. I'm happy to have something more strength oriented to add to my rotation, though I look to other videos for some of the things I've noted as missing above.",1314576000,11,2192,4.316301703163017

I've never been a video girl, but I have seen HUGE changes in my physique via Jillian's No More Trouble Zones and Yoga Meltdown (love both).  As a runner, I'm not highly interested in additional cardio work-outs, so I gravitated to this ""Pure Strength"" work-out.  I just finished for the first time. I made it all the way through the 65min workout with 8lb weights. Though I did fall out a few times, especially during the push-up/t-stand circuit.....which is good; gives me something to work toward.  I've never watched Biggest Loser, so I don't know Bob's persona there, but I like him on this video.  I do wish Bob had traded an arm circuit or two for more pure core work.  Thanks to Jillian and NMTZ's at 10-15lbs, my arms are already a bit body builder-esque (per my husband) and I fear too much time with this video may take them too far.

It is so well guided that you are corrected on form and pace. There is a countdown clock so you know exactly how much is left (when you feel like quitting). :) My husband uses 10 pound or 8 pound weights and I use 8, 5 and 3. I can see my body changing and I feel so empowered by this series and Bob Harper's guidance.

Another great thing about this series is that he has a long workout 60 minutes+ and/or a short 23 minute spot workout. On days where I run 4 miles I might add in the 20 minute shorty workout.

4204756,4,B003ULW71Q,"I wish I could give this 4.5 stars. It's one of the best weight training strength and endurance dvds I've tried but a couple of things hold me back from giving it the full 5 stars.

This dvd includes a 20 min. beginner workout and a 67 min. advanced workout. I started with the beginner and it is definitely for beginners. Very basic and not at all scary, but nice when you don't want something as intense or long. As for the longer workout, it is difficult. I typically like to challenge myself with heavier weights, always thinking back to the fact that most people don't lift enough to get any benefit. However, there's no way I'd be able to get through the entire hour with anything more than 3 lb. weights. (I have fairly weak arms, but still typically use 5 or 8 lb. weights with workout dvds.) This is as much an endurance workout as it is for strength. Bob keeps you moving the entire time... multiple reps, multiple sets and lots on one leg/arm before switching sides. The multiple sets of the exact same move got somewhat boring and repetitive at times. It would have been nice to work the same muscles but with a slight variation in movement to keep it interesting. He gives some modifications to make moves easier or harder throughout though not for every move. There are 3 people demonstrating with him and 1 typically does the advanced, 1 the normal and 1 the basic variation. I have to cut down on the number of reps for certain moves, as they are too strenuous for me... even with my light weights. I like that it gives me something to work toward though.

The entire hour is definitely weight training based. There isn't as much fusion with cardio moves as some other trainers provide, so whether or not this is for you depends on what you're looking for. If you want pure weight training, this is it. It still definitely brings your heart rate up and gets you sweating. The focus is on arms/shoulders, legs and abs. I like that the bottom of the screen shows a countdown timer along with a little bar of sorts that keeps inching toward the finish line so you see a visual for how much you've accomplished and how much you have left.

I like Bob's personality but don't think he's for everyone; he definitely gives me the push I need. I don't watch Biggest Loser but I've heard from others he's much ""meaner"" in this dvd than he is on the show. He frequently claps out a beat, yelling for you to pick up the pace and never stop, to do all of the reps. He's intense but I also find him encouraging.

Besides the repetitive sets my only other complaint is with the background demonstrators and some of the videography. Throughout the dvd the 3 demonstrators, and one woman especially, have these horrible, exaggerated pained expressions on their faces as if this is the hardest thing they've ever done and it's often accompanied with grunting and awful noises to let us know how much pain they're in. It's really exaggerated and annoying. I almost feel like a director assigned them certain workout personalities to try and act out... one woman is ""the athlete"" who pushes to the extreme with little complaint and can execute things fairly easily and with lots of focus. The other woman is ""the determined beginner""; she never stops but lets us know how hard it is for her by grunting and making faces. And the guy is the ""I need to rest"" type who wants to keep taking breaks but Bob always catches him and tells him not to stop. If it weren't for this, this workout would be nearly perfect for strength training and endurance purposes. Also, the videography can get slightly annoying at times... zooming in and pausing for a second, almost creating a snapshot of the exercise, with a different color screen.

However, if you're looking for a workout dvd that's strength training focused and will push and challenge you, this is it. I reach for it more often than any of my other workout dvds when I want to focus purely on weight training.",1311120000,7,3955,4.518156424581005

There isn't much to say that hasn't already been said.  No matter what we tell you here, it will not prepare you for what you will experience.  Shaking, arms and legs just begin to describe what your body will feel like.  How about getting yourself in plank for about 20 minutes...yah, that might begin to describe what you are going through.

About halfway through...or maybe sooner, Bob's friends start to cry, whimper and scream.  That tells me this a workout that even the rock body help find tough.

My fitness has fallen dramatically after a couple of years of dealing with life's crisis, I had unconsciously packed on more calories and now I am doing it something about it.  I have started with Jillian Michael and I wanted more variety with calories burn without all the jumping around as I live in an apt. So this DVD was absolutely perfect: challenging moves that gets you sweating within 5minutes.  Yeah you will feel your muscles burn, but since I am slightly unfit, I felt okay to catch my breathe in some of the moves.. As long as I keep moving, keep going.  my goal is to be able to keep up and in the meantime, i do my best,  it was great that there were modifications and that two of three people demonstrating were not that fit, so it was reassuring to go down this journey together.  I did not feel inadequate!  I actually ended up doing 45 minutes of the exercises on first try and that surprised me given the macho comments on the various reviews!  So ladies if you have been working up to L2 with jillian Michaels' various shred it DVDs, then you certainly give this DVD a good stab.

4204763,4,B003ULW71Q,"I borrowed this from a friend who raved about it, and thought it would be cheesy (due to the Biggest Loser logo) and easy. I row, run, and hike/climb, and find most videos fun cross training that I don't have to push through. This is much better than anticipated. It is a solid workout and using weights and proper form, I had to push at a few points.

The pace is good, the workout is challenging. It requires few materials - weights and a towel are all you need. Bob's direction is good, the models are motivating. There is a countdown timer along the bottom of the screen that helps motivate you to keep pushing to get through the entire sequence. The workout is a full hour.

Advanced athletes:
If you have two sets of weights, I recommend using heavier weights (15-20#) for the bentover row and weighted squats and 5-7# for the rest of the video.
I supplement this video with 10 extra minutes of plyometrics and 10 extra minutes of abs and call it a day. Adding cardio is nice if you have the time.

Beginners: I loaned this to a friend who's starting a workout program, and by using lighter / no weights, pausing when needed, and going at her own pace she found it fun and challenging to complete the whole workout. There is an introductory 20min workout that is great to learn the moves properly and to get the rhythm of Bob's cues.",1308009600,3,1339,4.391129032258065

His dispostion seems softer than Jillian's, he has the the better methods of motivation as well as more reasonable exercises for one to do (even though I like Jillian just as much, apples and oranges).  There are two workouts on this DVD, the beginning and the advanced.  The only bit of criticism is that there doesn't seem to be an intermediate step.  The beginning has its challenges, but only lasts 20 minutes.  The advanced is 60 minutes and brutal, which will leave you weak and begging for mercy at the end of it.  Perhaps there should be an intermediate workout between them to blend both.  However, Bob will make you strong.  DON'T GIVE UP, you CAN get through his routine and then you WILL loose weight IF YOU PUT THAT NEVER ENDING EFFORT INTO IT.

I tried this Bob Harper workout (1 hour one) last weekend for the first time while working out with some family. WOW! I was going into the workout expecting it to be fairly easy in comparison to the P90x workouts, but I was quite surprised.

The biggest difference was the sheer lack of breaks during the Harper workout. Tony (P90x) gives you 10s breaks in between many of the exercises while he talks and switches weights. Not this workout. There is one small break about halfway through, but otherwise you are going nonstop. Or, at least, trying to. I was pouring sweat and had to take a few breaks. I think my mistake was using weights that were too heavy for the number of reps. In P90x I usually do 8-10, but in this workout it's not unusual to do 30 reps for some of them. Keep that in mind when you are first trying it out...I was using 5-25lb weights for most of the exercise.

I love to see that the others working out in the video are tired and having a hard time continuing.  It actually motivates me when I am able to hold a position longer than them or not feel like I am dying as much.

(Thankfully, I checked it out from my local library instead of purchasing it based on the DVD jacket.) It was alright, but rather dull. It is very traditional in that he works out with model-perfect people who are way too serious and expressionless. Beyond those superficial complaints, the workout is just dull. He works one muscle group at a time,and it just seems to move rather slowly. The thing I like about the BL DVD's is that he combines upper and lower body together, which makes it much more challenging; plus Bob seems more approachable and motivating than he is in this one. That's not to say that I felt no burn, because I did. But only a fraction of the burn I get from the 2 BL workouts mentioned. After working out for the same amount of time with each DVD, the BL workouts left me feeling exhausted and proud of my hard work. This one made me feel like I had to do another workout get the same benefits.",1299369600,2,1022,4.412698412698413

The workout you do the first time you watch this dvd will be the same one you'll do the second, third, fourth, fifth (and so on) times you do it.  No variation.  I suppose you get what you pay for (and compared to P90x or Insanity this is a nice, cheap dvd), but what you get is an exercise program that you'll probably get sick of after a while.

He stresses good form throughout, and it is great because I ended up doing the exercises properly and not pulling or injuring anything, something easy to do when in the middle of a set and you're pushing yourself.

Sometimes in other long workouts my mind starts playing tricks on me and it feels longer perhaps endless, but this has that reminder that we're still going and we're getting closer to the goal. It's hard, there's no doubt about that, but not too hard and you'll be so proud of yourself when you're done.

Bob Harper pushes the 'students' in the DVD to go farther and harder and faster, and pushes the viewer (""me"") to do the same.

There he is posing pleasantly with what he calls 'real people' on a DVD that promises real workouts for them.

And that demanding quality is suggested by Bob's solo picture on the box; he is glaring out at you behind new facial hair.  He does't have to say it, 'He dares you'.
If there is any humor in evidence during the sixty minute workout here, it's pretty lame.  Bob is the drill sargent here and his troops all fall short.  None of the three look like they are doing this for anything but the money or would repeat the experience for any reason.

4204803,5,B003ULW71Q,"Wow, this workout is so different from Bob's other ones, yet it retains all the things I loved about his other DVDs

First, I must say that I collect fitness DVDs like some women buy shoes...I like to rotate them to keep me inspired and try new ones to retain motivation. While I may not always have time to make it to the gym, I typically can drag myself to do a routine at home even in a time crunch. So, I do have all his previous DVDs.

CALORIE BURN:
I wear a bodybugg with a digital display to show me how many calories I'm burning during a workout but also continue reading the burn after the workout is over. That way I can not only compare a workout DVD to others during the workout, but also see how many calories it burned AFTER the workout is over in ramping up the metabolism. This is especially important with a strength training DVD because, while a cardio DVD will burn more calories DURING the workout, a good strength training DVD will burn less during the workout but will continue burning long after the workout is over, and build muscle so that you burn more calories even at rest. I mention all this only so you know my calorie burn measurement is based on scientific measurement rather than perceived exertion...and Bob knew how to ""work it"" in this routine. In fact, it's the one Bob Harper or Biggst Loser DVD I'd say doesn't adjust as well as others for beginners. Even in the short routine I think you need to have some strength training experience before you jump into it. It not only works every muscle but burns far more calories than most pure strength DVDs due to him getting the heart rate up and working major muscle groups often even when working smaller muscles for the most benefit in less time...plus you don't stop during this workout to learn something...he teaches as you go so you don't miss a beat and neither do your muscles! BUT because of all this, you will get a 5 star calorie burn not usually seen with only strength training.

DVD: This one is exceptionally well made. Gone are the Biggest Loser contestants behind him doing the moves wrong as though they just picked up the routine somewhat on the fly...the camera offers close up shots of how to do something in detail as Bob explains it and his back up team is serious about knowing how to do it RIGHT. The music is not the boring electronica found on many workout DVDs but an upbeat instrumental that is far more inspiring on a professional looking gym set.

CUEING:
Bob is always excellent, in my opinion, in not tripping you up. I say on all my DVD reviews of any fitness product that I am not exactly gifted in coordination and I never miss a beat or do a wrong move with his cueing. No different here but boy he really goes into great detail in the instruction. I don't know if he's taking off on his own doing more ""Bob Harper"" produced DVDs as compared to the old Biggest Loser ones but he really seemed ""into"" this routine and it seemed better produced to me. It may very well be the same production company but if so, they've moved up the quality.

MOTIVATION:
This is a trainer who is exceptionally comfortable on camera but retains a positive ""push"" as he drives you through the workout. I typically feel as though I have a great trainer right there in my living room rather than someone wanting their camera time. I am pushed, but it's also done with much positive motivation and thinking.

INSTRUCTION:
While I think this may be tough for someone who has NEVER done strength training to jump right into, the instruction is clear enough that you could, perhaps, with lighter weights or less reps. In other words, he simply won't allow you to do a move WRONG. You not only get clear instruction on what to do but reminders of what not to do so that you get the most gain from your workout.

OVERVIEW:
While you will get your heartrate up this isn't like most of the Biggest Loser DVDs that combine lots of cardio and strength. This one is truly focused on building muscle and building EVERY muscle...you will do enough reps at enough speed and form to utilize every muscle in your body from core to head to toe and do it WELL.

Workouts: Start with the 20 minute workout...it's still a great workout and once you feel comfortable and able to take on the hour workout, he'll kick your arse. It's really a ""last chance workout"" routine as far as strength training goes.

CONCLUSION: This will be on heavy rotation in my workout routine. while I try to get in lots of cardio, this is a full and complete strength training routine that, in my opinion, lacks nothing...it's so professionally done from camera to instruction to set to music to results that I don't have a negative opinion on it whatsoever...",1294790400,87,4715,4.460556844547564

She is tough and has a great body, that is what I want to be too!  The guy on the dvd is also in good shape.  The moderator, Stephanie, isn't too bad but she does screw up her face a lot. I know it's extemely tough on many of the exercises but sometimes just accepting that you have to do them instead of making faces will make them just a little easier.

Bob's instruction is relentless, and he quickly changes from one move to the next with little or no rest between moves. You need only a pair of light dumbbells and very little space to move. The most space-consuming move that is on the DVD is a series of stationary forward, side and back lunges.

I would not use this DVD if your goal is obtaining mass -- it is much too aerobic. However, you could probably modify the workout and use heavier weights with rests while Bob jabbers away, or use the remote to advance more quickly through the program.

My main criticism of this DVD is that Bob instructs a lot and hardly works out with you. In contrast, Tony Horton does virtually every move in the P90X program with you.",1294358400,,808,4.38

Their Routines are very different as well.  I've tried Pure Burn Super Strength and Body Rev Cardio Conditioning!  I have to warn you, just like Jillian's dvds, these workouts are not for beginners.

4204811,5,B003ULW71Q,"I have a lot of fitness dvds in my rotation for days when I don't feel like making it to the gym.  With Bob's new dvds, I never feel like going to the gym anymore! These dvds are excellent, particularly Pure Burn: Super Strength.  Bob moves through multiple exercises for each muscle group and using a variety of upper-lower body combinations.  I find that when I can't do any more work for one muscle group to save my life, Bob moves on to a different body part, giving those muscles a little recovery before he goes back to the first group.  It is very well-paced in this regard, allowing you to make it through the full hour.

Though I consider myself an inetermediate-advanced exerciser (5-6 days a week), I have to admit that I don't do the workout as fully as Bob's assistants do.  The one time I went ""all out"" at full intensity (dropping an extra two inches in a squat when Bob said to, etc), I made it for 40 minutes but was in absolute agony the next two days!  I have noticed an improvement in my muscle tone and a few weeks in, I am able to complete many more reps with weights than I was when I started.

I have been rotating this dvd with Bob's Cardio Conditioning (also highly recommended) and the Biggest Loser Last Chance Workout on days when I don't have much time, with some of Jillian Michaels' workouts thrown in.  For anyone who is above a beginner-level exerciser, this dvd is a great addition to your library and requires very little space.

If you're a fan of P90X this will be a nice supplement to your routine.  It will be evident to anyone who has done P90X that this is a P90X inspired routine - so you might celebrate the similarity or condemn the emulation.  I ultimately prefer Tony's personality and originality but I'm happy to have another challeging DVD in my collection.  5 stars for kicking my ...!,1293494400,,520,4.722222222222222

And yes, it is appropriately titled. This workout is pure burn. I workout out every day of the week, and equally love working out at the gym and at home. This is by far one of the best home workouts out there. P90X- yes it's a great workout. Tough, even. But there is a lot of pausing and Tony just running his mouth. Get to the workout. That's why I love Bob. This workout is all workout. You will want a break. You will scream for a break. and when it finally comes, it might bring you to your knees. My favorite move- Matrix lunges (which come right after the ""Push up to T-stand"" series). Never was I so happy to be back on my two feet.  My only complaint (though a bit whiny, but completely valid) is the fitness models. Didn't Bob try them out before casting them in this video? Stephanie- the ""modifier"" deserves the award for the worst drama queen in a fitness video -ever. What was up with those obviously fake facial expressions? She was modifying the moves (and she's obviously in great shape) so why was her face twisted throughout the workout, esp when the camera was aimed specifically on her? Fernando was supposed to be doing advanced moves, and he took more breaks than a beginner. I don't get this. Why were these two goons in this video? The only inspiration was Helen- who gave Bob many much deserved dirty looks whenever he asked for something more crazy than whatever crazy move you were already doing. All in all, a great workout. The workout- five plus stars. The fitness models (2 of 3 of them) zero stars, because they distract you from a near perfect workout.

My brother-in-law brought it up when the family came for Thanksgiving break. We supplemented it twice with my Tony DVD's and I managed to loose an additional 4 lbs.  Even after Thanksgiving dinner!! I wouldn't recommend it for a beginner as it pushes your aerobic state to the MAX!!

I have used DVD, video's most of my life, so I have an extensive library.  This DVD is different because of the strenght and cardio, Bob believes in keeping weights in everything you do (including his Cardio DVD) I really hated that since I have always felt my upper body was my weakess spot.  I am hanging in and ""just doing it"" and I have seen a change in my muscle tone and shape.  My scale is not moving so quickly, but I am attributing that to muscle gain (I hope) my waist is getting smaller.  I am trying to do pull ups but have not succeed yet.  I think this DVD is for intermediates or modivated beginners that won't be to discouraged when they can't get thru the first time or two.  You will sweat and you will curse, but at the end you will feel great just keep that in mind as your arms shake and legs wobble.  I am a mom of 5, 40 yrs old that has lost 65#'s.  I started Bob's DVD after losing 50#'s, I am finding that the combination of exercises I am doing now is really helping me tone area's I was really, really afraid would not, I am seeing muscles I never knew were there.  It is hard, but it's do-able all you have to do is put the DVD in and press play (and of course get off the couch:))  I am looking forward to more Bob DVD's.",1291161600,3,1364,3.974264705882353

I currently use No More Trouble Zones (Jillian Michaels) and a Jackie Warner DVD  somewhat regularly for strength training.  I thought that this DVD really helped give me the boost I needed.  I  used light weights and definitely felt challenged.  I anticipate that this DVD will be a part of my routine for a long time.  You definitely won't get bored quickly!  I also thought the calorie burn (380 according to my heart rate monitor) was quite nice for a strength training workout.

When I tried it at home, I loved the fact that Bob gets right to work, unlike Jillian, who takes FOREVER to get started. He is NO JOKE. If you want a challenge, pick up this DVD and try it.

4204821,5,B003ULW71Q,"This 66 minute-exercise video is tough. If you are a beginner, do not think about it! :) I call it ""extremely challenging"" based on: 1. if you can do each level of the ""30 day shred"" levels with good form and at least moderate weight, and 2. if ""No more trouble zones"" is just challenging or a little challenging, then try this. As Bob says, he wants to see what's left (of us / of our energy) at the end of the workout. With good form and adequate weights, the beginning is hard,and the middle keeps on giving in terms of challenge, but what truly makes the cut is how one does the last 20 minutes---if / when one gets there (still with good form and adequately challenging weights). Well, I for one can get to the end of the workout, but barely. Therefore, I will switch from 8 pounds to 5, and my goal is to make it like the exercisers on the video. The facial expressions of whoever and Bob's not being what he is on the BL (this is NOT the BL !) do not matter to me. I have too much to worry about my own sweat and facial expressions to care about others, who, mind you, are able to do the entire program from beginning to end. Maybe this video could be labeled a video for trainers, not so much trainees if the latter are just enthusiasts, but not strongly committed to push themselves as far as they can go. The day I can do this entire exercise routine in good form and with somewhat heavy weights, I'll call myself an athlete. I'm not there yet. This video beats the Jillian Michaels ""toughest trainer"" hands down, for sure. I like the cues given by Bob, I like seeing the exercisers have a hard time but still push through it and I love the feeling of accomplishment gotten at the end of the hour-long challenge.",1290384000,6,1722,4.237082066869301
4204822,4,B003ULW71Q,Great dvd.  It is tough but as Bob says you gotta push yourself and you would be surprised that yes you can get it done.  There is one difficult exercise move but you can do the easier version.  It get your heart rate up and when you finish the dvd you will definitely feel worked.  I did not feel sore the next day as I exercise six times per week and am in fairly good condition.  But for beginners stick with it.  Great purchase.,1289952000,2,432,4.083333333333333

4204824,5,B003ULW71Q,So this is my first work out with Bob.  I did the 20 minute beginner work out because I am just starting out.  I absolutely love it. He explains all of the moves so your form is correct.  I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to begin working out with weights.  I am gonna do this for a few weeks and then try to 1 hour work out.  I can't wait!,1289692800,3,354,3.861111111111111
4204825,4,B003ULW71Q,"and I am quite fit! I can finish JM's no more trouble zones with 8 lb weights without having to grunt. Well, I had to grunt several times during the hour-long workout! I felt that Bob went beyond what is reasonable for an averagely fit person to do, even his extremely fit crew can hardly finish some of the moves. But that's exactly what I was looking for after having mastered JM's DVDs, something that would challenge me and bring me to the next level. It is possible to reduce the burn by using lighter weights and in fact I switched from 8 lbs to 6 lbs halfway through the workout so I could finish it. I also did the push up - T-stand exercise without weights the second time around.
I give the DVD 4 stars instead of 5 because the workout is too long at 66 min. I work 8-5 and I come home, start dinner and then put in some exercise before dinner. Sometimes I have the energy to do a longer 45 min workout, sometimes I do a 20 min 30 day shred, but I NEVER have the energy to go on for 66 min. So I can only do this workout once a week during the weekend. The 20 min alternative is not a good one; it is way too easy for a fit person and it doesn't elevate my heart rate, so I am much better off doing JM instead. I wish Bob had included a modular version so that one could do 45 min and still get the majority of the benefits.",1289692800,3,1334,3.962825278810409
4204826,4,B003ULW71Q,"Like another reviewer said I missed out on Bob and Jillian because I just wasn't into the Biggest Loser, but in the past week I've tried Jillian and Bob's workouts for the first time and was very pleased. In fact I have reviewed all the ones I've tried.

I won't repeat myself here but I do consider myself intermediate to advanced and have plenty of experience with home workout programs and the gym.

This strength dvd was a bit different than most that I've done (it does put me in mind of Jari Love who uses light weights but high reps). But it was a nice change of pace. Since I'm not familiar with Bob's training style I can't comment on that but I enjoyed the combination use of body weight style training and light weights.

My interest in fitness sort of ebbs and flows and I needed a change from heavy weight training. This does the trick.

I was sort of annoyed with one move though, the push ups into the side T with weights (can't remember what he called them sorry). But I don't like doing push ups off of weights because after awhile my hands start to hurt so I had to move quickly through so that I could drop my pushing hand down to the floor to avoid that pain. Other than that I loved this workout. It IS long though, but P90X is an hour plus for 6 days per week.

I rank this right up there with some of the more recent extreme at home programs. I hope he keeps these coming.",1289174400,3,1395,4.190298507462686
4204827,4,B003ULW71Q,"First of all apologies for my review title, only I just wanted to make a brief statement about this dvd (which essentially counts for the cardio DVD as well).

Basically as described by others who have bought and completed these brutal workouts, it is just that.. BRUTAL! Yet miraculously I managed to get through the whole workout with fairly good ability to keep up with the peeps being instructed by Bob.

I love the intensity of this DVD and welcomed the change after having used many of Jillian Michael's workout dvds in the past (which are truly awesome too by the way!). Yet I have found that I am actually losing much of the ""preferred"" definition in my body I had built up by using previous workout dvds by JM's. My arms and legs seem to be chunking out yet have lost abdominal definiton despite constantly engaging my core in Bob's workouts. My legs appear to be more muscular on the quads as opposed to be lean yet toned as they were when using JM'S dvds. I do feel fitter though which is perhaps more important! But would have liked a bit more variety with the moves in this workout series. Especially more ab work other than basic crunch moves.

I have given it 4 stars simply as it is a very good workout dvd, but questioning whether it is the right one for me. Others may benefit more! :)",1288656000,2,1303,4.420833333333333

First off, this guy is INSANE!!  This is someone that you want as a personal trainer.  He's even meaner than Jillian!  His reps are crazy long and had me yelling at the TV.  I attempted to do this workout with 8lb weights, which was a bad idea, as it was impossible for me to do all of the reps when it came to moves other than curls.  I definitely recommend having 5-6lb and 8lb weights for ladies.  You will definitely need the range!

This workout is everything I wanted that I didn't get from Jillian's 30 Day Shred, particularly more time and more arm workouts.

I had to pause the DVD like 5 times to wipe away the sweat that was pouring into my eyes.

The people working out in the video were also great.  They are in awesome shape, and they were struggling and screaming throughout the workout.  I don't know if it was acting, but it definitely made me feel better about my own struggles.

I wouldn't recommend the hour long workout to people who aren't in fairly decent shape.  It may be too discouraging, although there is a 25min beginner workout that I have yet to try.",1288396800,3,1320,4.37037037037037

I took off a star because I can hardly tolerate watching the video due to the facial expressions and noises Stephanie makes.  I found her to be distracting she looks like she is going to cry most of the time.  His crew is very seldom in sync either and they freeze frame once in awhile which is annoying.

4204833,5,B003ULW71Q,"I just completed this DVD and let me tell you, my muscles are on fire!  This is a very intense workout and it is not for the faint of heart.  I've done The Biggest Loser DVD's, Jackie Warner, and Tamilee Webb which are all very good--but this one is probably the most challenging. I kid you not, even the women in the video, who appear to be muscular athletes, were crying towards the last 15 minutes or so.  (In their defense it did look like they were using the same weights the men were).

Bob takes the standard exercise, such as push ups or plank position, and bumps it up notch by adding various movements within the movement.  For example, he has you do a push up to a side plank position with a weight in the hand...and then rotating this movement from one side to the other.

I do agree that Bob is not the ""nice guy"" that we are all used to, however towards the end of the video he reminds us that he has our best interest at heart.  He says jokingly ""remember I'm the nice one"".  I can deal with his intensity as long as I keep this in mind. I just keep reminding myself ""bikini"" ""bikini""...""skinny jeans"" ""skinny jeans""...

I did not notice the small print on the back which recommended using 1-2lb weights, so I started out with my 5lb weights only to find that I had to bump it down at some points to 3lbs due to the intensity and repetition.  (I think in the video he recommends using 8-10lbs).  I would highly suggest having some lighter weights available, especially the first time around.  I did also find myself at a few points modifying when needed and doing what I could.

While I do not think I can do this type of intensity every day, at least right now, I will find a space for it in my routine when I feel I need to ""amp it up"".  Bravo Bob!",1285372800,5,1765,4.198813056379822

Bob was tough like Jillian, and every muscle group was targeted.  Even the demonstrators/talent were squealing during the work out and stopping for a break (especially Francisco, who made ME want to yell at him! But Bob must've known that Francisco would slack a bit because Bob was yelling at him).  I work out hard core 6 to 8 hours week (primarily high-intensity interval training and weights), but I had to stop for breaks just like his talent! Tomorrow I'll be sore, but I can't wait to do it again because I know that it will work my muscles in new ways.

I found myself really annoyed that the three supporting exercisers were gasping for air and resting every time Bob turned around!  How is that motivating for those of us doing the workout at home??  As far as the host, I like Bob's attitude and found him easy to watch on tv.  He doesn't do a lot of the workout, but that's fine because he's showing you the moves on the supporting cast.

The workout itself took the low weight/high rep approach.  In my opinion, there was too much shoulder work. By the end of the 60 minute workout I could barely hold myself up in plank, which made it hard to do push-ups.  Don't get me wrong, the fatigue is good, but my chest workout suffered.  Perhaps chest presses or flys in between the tricep and ab workout would have been more helpful.",1285113600,7,976,4.407821229050279

Just because you can't get it on Amazon right now doesn't mean it isn't available elsewhere.  Anyway, I was expecting to love this workout based on the other reviews, but I just couldn't get into it.  This is a good, solid strength/circuit training workout, but I found it to be very boring and I couldn't wait for it to end.  It does get your heart rate up and pushes you to the next level.  I am in int/advanced exerciser who enjoys circuit training, but this just wasn't for me.  I like Bob as a trainer and agree with the other reviewer that he is not as inspiring or motivating in this workout.  I thought there was way too much shoulder work.  I like the fact that the people doing the workout actually stop when it is too difficult, but I can't get over Stephanie's grunting and facial expressions.",1283558400,10,961,4.335195530726257

4204838,4,B003ULW71Q,"This workout is tough, no doubt. It will push you to your limits. Bob acts as your personal trainer and is very pushy (I wish he would work out himself). There are 3 exercisers in great shape at different levels. This workout works them and you so hard that the movements become sloppy (the 3 exercisers have this problem too) because you're so exhausted. However, when I lift weights, I find it important to keep form at all times. In my opinion this is important for results as well as to prevent injury. It's a strenuous workout without rest, so it gets you winded and you will sweat buckets but you must be experienced enough to know when you lose form and how to modify. In this DVD, Bob is exceptionally hard on the exercisers and the message is that it has to be hard work and no fun or it won't be effective. I'm an exercise addict (25+ years) and I completely disagree with that. I love strenuous exercise but I'm not motivated by a bad-ass attitude, so I took a star away, however this is till a very good workout. There is also a second workout, about 20 minutes in length with its own warm-up that focuses on legs, abs and balance. I really liked that one. Overall, I like the Body Rev Cardio Conditioning better which is a high intensity interval workout with weights and I find Bob's style (not as aggressive) better there as well.",1283126400,2,1345,4.405622489959839
4204839,5,B003ULW71Q,"A few thoughts on this:

* To the folks who reviewed this by saying it was not ""fun"": It's not supposed to be fun, it's supposed to be a work out and, frankly, it is!

* Frame of reference, I'm a male in my late 40's, in better than average shape (can run a 5K but a 10K is way rough for me).

Now, this video really kicks your butt. The 60 minute workout is very difficult for me to do. But what I do like about it is that it can apply for many fitness levels. Doing the modifications and/or using lower weights will make this good for those in relitively mediocre shape and increasing weights or speed will tax even those who are in the best of shape. It taxes your thighs, chest, shoulders, upper back, bi's/tri's and abs nicely. The lats are not hit much but it's damned near impossible to hit lats without a pulldown.

To be clear, it is not the ""be-all-end-all"" of fitness videos, but it warrants a place in your DVD collection because after an hour, you are done.",1283040000,20,970,4.198924731182796
4204840,4,B003ULW71Q,"As I've mentioned in other reviews, I have wrist problems and there were a lot of exercises in this video that I was either unable to do or had to be modified.  That being said, it was not easy (even with my modifications).

My biggest problem is that I would consider myself an intermediate when it comes to a fitness/workout level and I found the shorter workout to be too easy, and the longer workout to be almost too difficult.  I really wish this DVD would have had 3 workouts (the 25 min, one about 40 mins, and then the 60+ min one).  I think that would be much easier for people who aren't quite at the level of the 60 min workout but are beyond the 25 minute one.  It seems like quite a jump for someone just starting out to go from the 25 min directly to the 60, but maybe that is just my thought process.

I love the countdown clock and found that to be one of the best parts of this DVD.  You always know where you are, but don't get too excited when you hit the 15 minute mark because that's about where you will really have to work.  I found the last section before the cool down/stretch to be the hardest part of the entire thing, and it has nothing to do with my wrist issues.  It's just tough.

As others have said, there isn't really a focus on ab work, but there is a focus on keeping your abs tight throughout and there are a couple balance exercises that require you to keep them tight as well.

There are a lot of hold moves too.  You go through the exercises and then at the end Bob has you hold the position.  That gets a little tiring but it is, for the most part, manageable.

One of the things I really like is that no one is really in sync.  They are all working out at various fitness levels and at various speeds which makes you feel good about where you are and what you're doing.  There is the occasional push to do something faster, but, again, it really is a work at your own pace DVD and as long as you're pushing yourself then you're doing it right.  There are no happy, peppy people in this thing and at times all three of the people working out look like they're going to die.

I'm giving it 4 because I had to make too many modifications for my wrists, but it did kick my butt and if it wasn't for my own personal inability to do some of the exercises, I would have given it a 5.",1283040000,6,2318,4.068281938325991
4204841,5,B003ULW71Q,"This is a very very tough workout.  Everyone muscle group is worked to exhaustion.  The long workout is about 67 minutes long and there is a countdown on the screen (which I personally like) which also indicates what exercises are being done.  This is a nice feature but some people may have trouble reading this because the font is somewhat small and crowded.

The workout only requires light to heavy hand weights (depending on your fitness level).  There is an approximately 7 minute warm up and then the exercises start.  There are three other exercisers, an advanced woman who is in phenomenal shape (and who has 4 kids!), a male intermediate, and woman doing the beginner exercises (she always looked like she was in pain or going to cry which I found distracting).  Many of the exercises incorporated core work although I don't think that there is a huge focus on abdominal muscles (unlike Jackie Warner's videos which makes my abs ache for days).  There are ALOT of pushups in this video and they pop up unexpectedly in many places.  There are also a lot of squats and some plyometrics.  The workout targets all the muscle groups and each muscle group is worked to the point of fatigue.  The workout ends with a good stretch.

This workout is best for someone who is at least an intermediate exerciser and will definitely be a challenge to those in the advanced category.  In part, this is because the workout is really tough and because there is not a clear demonstration of proper form.  It is expected that you know how to do the exercises properly.  The workout could use some more creativity in the exercises chosen which are relatively standard (although hugely effective).  Because this workout is so intense and thorough, this is definitely one that will be in continuous rotation.

This workout will appeal to anyone who enjoys Jari Love, Jillian Michaels, or Jackie Warner.  It easily is up there with the toughest of the workout videos.",1282780800,15,1955,4.767857142857143

I am in good shape and found this a very challenging workout. If you like p90x you'll love this because it is as hard as those workouts but works your entire body out instead.  Plus Bob has a great and motivating personality.  If you're looking for an excellent toning and strength training workout this is your dvd. I want to try his cardio next.,1281916800,16,476,4.564705882352941
4204845,5,B003ULW71Q,"I have been doing work out videos for many years.  It wasn't until discovering the Jillian Micheals DVDs (30 day Shred, Banish Fat Boost Metabolisim, No More Trouble Zones) that I actually found a workout challenging.  No more spending 45 minutes doing silly dance steps that, when you are finally done, you realize your heart rate is barely elevated and you aren't the least bit winded.  What a waste of time that used to be!!!!  The Jillian DVD's were a breath of fresh air as they actually use your own body weight to create more resitence and give you a better workout in less time.  Because the Jillian ones were so great, I was skeptical of this DVD.  Especially since Bob is ""the nice one"" on the Biggest Loser.  HA!  The hour long workout on this DVD is absolutey intense.  You can make it more or less challenging for yourself by adjusting the amount of weight you use or how low you go into some of the moves.  I have not finished the entire hour long workout yet in one session.  Partly because its so long, and partly because my arms are shaking by halfway through and I have nothing left!  Every time I find that I can complete more of the excercises and get farther, so I am working my way up to it.  If you are of average to slightly above average fitness level looking for a challenge you will not be disappointed!",1281312000,124,1330,4.3795918367346935
4204846,5,B003ULW71Q,"I just started this series this week.  I loved the Cardio (burned as many calories as I do in a typical spin class).  The yoga was awesome and I couldn't believe how quickly the hour flew by.  Today I did the hour long Super Strength.  WOW.  It is a seriously hard weight training dvd.  Obviously you can make it easier or harder depending on what weight you choose to use, but this DVD worked EVERYTHING in my body.  I like p90x, but I really like having a DVD that focuses on training your entire body in a short period of time.  Bob gave excellent cues and really pushed me to my max.  I highly recommend this series of DVDs for fitness enthusiasts.  It might be a bit tough for the beginner, but I'm sure you'd get amazing results if you just stick with it!",1280880000,8,761,4.222222222222222
4204847,5,B003ULW71Q,After losing 120 lbs. never stepping foot in a Gym always walking& running doing Bob & Jillians workouts on Dvd this workout is what we need take it to the next level and build more muscle. I tryed the p90X and I always felt I had to do more cardio after I worked out. With Pure Burn my heart was at 139 most of the workout and I burned 651 cals. in the hour And I already feel it great workout you can do it.,1280880000,88,409,3.823529411764706
8406012,5,B003ULW71Q,"I just had a baby 4 months ago.  When I fdid try fot this DVD I was in prime shape, it was hard, but I could get through it without stopping.  Today was the first time I did the workout post baby and man, am I a wreck!  This workout is amazing!  I have no core stability right now and I could finally feel my abs again doing this workout.  My arms are dead, my quads were shaking, if you want a hard workout, this is for you.  There is also a beginner workout for those who are new to this type of workout.  Its intense, but doable for those who aren't in prime shape.  But the 60 minutes workout is not for the faint of heart!  Bring water and a towel!  Youll need it!",1514764800,,669,3.888888888888889

8406014,5,B003ULW71Q,"If you want to get stronger and more fit, this is the video to do that! But, it is definitely an intermediate to advanced video.  Just to give some perspective, I""m 46 years old, my BMI is about 21, and I work out 4-6x a week exclusively using work out videos.  I tend to use Jillian Michael, Jeanette Jenkins, and a few kettle bell videos, but decided to try this Bob Harper video.  There are two levels- a 20 minute and an hour.  The 20 minute is totally doable, mainly because it is so short. The hour one is INTENSE.  I just used it for the fourth time, and I still can only get to about 45 minutes through it.  I am only using 3 and 5 lb weights (I switch as needed).  I decided to start with light weights because I wasn't sure how hard it would be.  It's hard. I feel like a bit of a wimp using such light weights AND not being able to finish, but you are doing high reps of pretty much every move.  And Bob likes to keep you in squat position (regular and chair) for extended periods of time while doing arm exercises.  My goal is to 1) Finish the video 2) Move up to 5lbs the whole time and 3) Eventually move up to heavier weights.  I have no doubt that if someone sticks with this and eats healthy, they will see results.  No muscles are left untouched, and you will be pouring sweat within about 10 minutes.  It's a great video!",1498348800,3,1340,4.088122605363985
8406015,5,B003ULW71Q,"I absolutely love this DVD! I lost 15 lbs in 5 weeks when i added this routine 3-4 times per week using 5 lb dumbells and completing the 1 hr workout (140 down to 125 lbs. 5 2""). combined this with jogging which made the perfect combination of cardio and strength training. I did not change my eating habits!!!! And believe me that's where I struggle the most. After completing this video I actually feel like my appetite decreases plus my energy increases. I even want to get up off the couch later and dance or jog around my living room! This video is like a miracle. I have tried many different kinds of workouts and never have I had results like I got with this video. With so many other workout DVDs I get bored and can't  make it through the whole thing, but with this video I can mute it and listen to whatever music I want to that pumps me up which helps a lot. I don't pay too much attention to counting how many reps im doing I just try my best each time and I can feel my strength improving so much. I do a few modifications throughout the video mostly at the end. Don't be afraid to do that especially if something doesn't feel quite right to you because you never want to hurt yourself. I will say that it helps to have some weight training knowledge in order to practice good form, but if you don't you can listen to the video and Bob does a great job of coaching. If you already know the correct form feel free to mute the video and listen to or watch whatever keeps you going. Once you've gotten used to the routine you only have to glance at the screen to keep up. I like that you don't repeat the same thing over and other like completing 3 sets of the same exercises. That gets old and loses my focus quickly. I actually enjoy the perceived lack of organization. Don't be fooled though, Bob has thought out every move in this video to target every muscle group and give you the body you've always wanted! I didn't get this product for free for my review in fact I've even bought this video for friends because of how much I've gotten out of it. If you stick with this video you're body will transform!",1493078400,3,2120,4.208845208845209
