8277277,4,B000A7UEH2,I saw this movie many years ago. I wasn't sure I liked it at first until they started playing Portishead in it. Its a black and white vampire movie. It has a very classic style to it. Very interesting check it out. If the movie doesnt get your attention the music will.,1169078400,,269,4.1923076923076925
