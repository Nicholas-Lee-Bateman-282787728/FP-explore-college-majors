The tale is simple, I won't give away the plot. But this is an excellent copy of that tale.

Highly recommend!",1297209600,5,319,4.213114754098361

I am NOT reviewing the DVD. Just the movie unless otherwise stated.

Please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.

Silent Movies are not the ones that you can review, it's a one to take the experience and only if your patient. I mean, Silent Movies were not made for 2010, they were made for the early 1900's. They can be enjoyed but only on a first person level from a very intelligent being.

There are some key things, but there are key things in every movie, and I am sick so I don't feel like reviewing.

UPDATE: I would like to point out some key areas.

The movie is silent yes, but not all B&W. From what I've seen and understand, several different areas are dipped in color. The inside during the day is yellow, underwater is light blue, night is red, the jungle is yellowish-green, but it's not real techincolor. But if you don't like B&W but do like classics, check this out.

Of course, there is the people who do like B&W and love classics will want to see this movie to.

However this movie has some more various main characters as well. It was 1916 so don't expect pure love for them but still. I haven't read the book but I know something in here that wasn't in the book: the back story of Captain Nemo.

This was the very first Special Effects Spectacular, and there is more to talk about, but I'm not gonna today. Maybe tomorrow, or the next day, or the next day, or the next day, or the next day.

The Rating? 3.7/5",1277078400,3,1833,4.842948717948718
8319865,1,B001LV2P8M,"I'm commenting on the ""A2ZCDs"" 2008 DVD release (UPC 882012439951) of this 1916 classic film. It is advertised on Amazon as a ""Remastered Edition,"" and it is - to the detriment of the viewer. It's been subject to so much DNR that it cannot be watched. Apparently this is another early film now in the public domain that anybody can ""remaster"", repackage, and sell on Amazon. (There's at least one other such edition also being advertised.)

Since it is such an important early film you should purchase the 1999 Image Entertainment edition (UPC 014381466621), which appears to still available via Amazon; it looks the way you'd expect early 20th century films to look (i.e. hasn't been digitally modified to any appreciable extent) and it's watchable.

Perhaps some day some studio really will remaster this film - but the A2ZCD edition isn't the One.",1266883200,12,850,4.937062937062937
