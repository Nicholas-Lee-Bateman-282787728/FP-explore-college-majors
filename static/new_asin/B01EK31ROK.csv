The workouts consists of balance, stretch and energizing movement. The three sessions vary in intensity. I found Nadia's instructions to be very soothing and motivating. I highly recommend for strength, balance and stretch.",1504569600,,357,5.280701754385965

The video itself is soft/fuzzy, as if it was a copy of a copy of a copy. Not sure what happened to quality control, but this first batch doesn't have it. I am comparing it to the other Nadia Narain DVDs I currently own which are crystal clear.",1473292800,,377,4.04
