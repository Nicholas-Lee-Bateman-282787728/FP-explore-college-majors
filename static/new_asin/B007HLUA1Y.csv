5086936,3,B007HLUA1Y,"A recent partnership between the Met, the Universal labels, and the retail chain Target has produced some curious releases of performances in the Met's HD cinema broadcast series. From the 2009-10 season, we got an AIDA and TURANDOT on the Decca label, both revivals of 1980s Met productions that already had long been available on DVD with superior casts. From 2010-11, DG has now licensed a vocally middling TROVATORE (the only one of the four Target-specific releases to feature a new production) and this FANCIULLA, another decades-old production better served by an existing DVD (the '92 Daniels/Domingo/Milnes, also DG). I could at least account for the AIDA and TURANDOT revisits on the grounds of title fame, and TROVATORE too is a big public favorite, but what of FANCIULLA, always a connoisseur's piece under the popular radar? Perhaps it was chosen based on the composer's name alone, with no other Puccini opera having been performed in 2010-11?

Whatever the case, I have long since thrown in the towel in trying to understand the reasoning behind what is licensed for DVD and what is not, specifically where the Met is concerned. Where, for example, are the Jack O'Brien TRITTICO, the ROMO ET JULIETTE with Alagna and Netrebko, the BORIS GODUNOV showcasing Ren Pape in the title role but staggeringly well sung from top to bottom, the superb IPHIGNIE EN TAURIDE with Domingo and Graham...or even the Bartlett Sher CONTES D'HOFFMANN, an uneven realization salvaged by the performances of, among others, Calleja and Netrebko? For all of these operas except TRITTICO (for which we do have Renata Scotto's 1981 tour de force), *no* previous Met video of any era is in the catalog. I could go back to the pre-HD days and wonder at the unavailability of various Met telecasts, but the point has already been belabored.

As you see, I approach the review of this FANCIULLA with a chip on my shoulder -- I believe it is a head-scratchingly superfluous release, and with so many better Met performances going unlicensed, superfluous equals unworthy. This is not to say it is entirely without merit, but it fills no gap in the opera's videography, and in most respects, even in its strongest points, one can do as well or better elsewhere. The principal asset is the conducting of the Tuscan maestro Nicola Luisotti, who has a Rolls-Royce opera orchestra at his disposal and, unlike some of the Met's active routiniers, does not squander the opportunity. His work in this colorful and deceptively intricate score is shapely, vivid, rich in sonority, attentive to inner detail -- a performance both exciting and beautiful, far in advance of his counterpart Leonard Slatkin's on the earlier Met DVD. The chorus holds up its end well, the comprimarios are well cast, and HD mainstays Keith Miller (Ashby) and Dwayne Croft (Sonora) are welcome presences. FANCIULLA had its world premiere at the Met in 1910, and there was some carping when Giancarlo del Monaco's nearly 20-year-old production was hauled out for this centenary run, but it was one of the director's best efforts. It still impresses as ornate, painstaking, and attractive, and is sure to please fans of by-the-book realism.

With all of that plus up-to-date picture and sound going for it, all that would be needed for this release to justify itself would be a strong lead trio at the center. This is where the disc falls, and in one case falls hard. Deborah Voigt has had a career with many successes, but such qualities as she retains now, at 50, are not apposite. I would prefer not to go down the rabbit hole of deciding whether to blame age, technique, general wear and tear, or bariatric surgery, but her middle register, where so much of this particular role and its Italianate cousins live or die, has gone wizened, hollow, and insubstantial. The top is better, but hit-or-miss; some notes there land squarely, while others are tight and truncated or slightly under pitch. It cannot be said that there is anything in the way of dramatic compensation for the vocal deficiencies in a very unattractive piece of singing. Voigt was never a specific or even convincingly temperamental performer, and in this very conversational role, she makes little of the words; she's no mistress of the telling inflection or nuance. There is decent rapport early on with the rank-and-file miners, but little else.

Marcello Giordani (Johnson/Ramerrez) is an inconsistent tenor who, in these impoverished times for his repertoire, often receives plum assignments at the Met, and has built an impressive video catalog on that theater's HD releases alone. Here, he is neither at his best nor his worst. He is a dutiful performer and a likable personality, and it is not enough to lift the performance. This is Lucio Gallo's third DVD go-round as Rance ('05 Arthaus at Torre del Lago; '09 Opus Arte from the Netherlands), and it is the sort of showing that elicits summations like ""Gallo is by now an old hand at the role"" -- which is a polite way of saying that someone has been doing something for a while and knows exactly how it's supposed to go, but doesn't sound very good in doing it.

Though not one of the composer's most frequently programmed operas, FANCIULLA is generously represented on video. It is not only easy to do better in shopping for a DVD, it is hard to do worse. The best stage production is the influential Covent Garden one by Piero Faggioni, caught in a 1982 revival on a Kultur DVD. That performance also has the earliest and best of Domingo's three outings as Johnson/Ramerrez; indeed, this is one of Domingo's best video performances of anything, and his co-stars have a lot to offer. All that keeps it from being my first choice is its age. Picture and sound are lackluster, subtitles spotty. Too, conductor Nello Santi conducts a vigorous, hard-charging performance but one that skimps on some subtleties. The aforementioned DG '92 with Giancarlo del Monaco's Met production also has Domingo, still in solid shape and again well partnered, but Slatkin in the pit is a nullity. Being a nullity puts him well ahead of the liability that is Lorin Maazel (who in the 1970s conducted Puccini very well) on the Opus Arte '91 from La Scala.  This is the middle Domingo performance, and the one to avoid -- everything in it can be bettered, including Jonathan Miller's grim and gray production.

The best-equipped soprano in vocal weight and Italianate style is Antonietta Stella, but the VAI DVD enshrining her interpretation has not much else going for it; it is provincial in bad ways rather than charming ones. Within hailing distance of Stella is another Italian, Daniela Dess, in the 2005 open-air performance co-starring her husband, tenor Fabio Armiliato, and baritone Gallo (in fresher voice). For all-around excellence with correspondingly fine technical credits, that '05 Arthaus Musik may be the top pick...although Domingo's '82 Johnson/Ramerrez and the Faggioni production containing it are a crucial supplement. The only video production yet to try a Regietheater reimagining of the Old West setting is that of Nikolaus Lehnhoff for the Netherlands Opera ('09 Opus Arte). This does boast the formidable Dutch dramatic soprano Eva-Maria Westbroek. A less innately stylish heroine than Dess or Stella, she has more firepower for this killer role than the pushed lyrics Carol Neblett ('82 Kultur) and Barbara Daniels ('92 DG), both of whom are nevertheless sincere and winning and get through it. Voigt on the new release, alas, I would rank down at the bottom of the Minnie list with Mara Zampieri ('91 Opus Arte)...and Zampieri probably wins that match-up, her strikingly unattractive timbre at least partially balanced by fluency in the language and the idiom.

Returning to the disc under review, my three stars are for Luisotti, the orchestra and chorus, a still-enjoyable stage production, and the technical credits. I may add half a star for host/interviewer Sondra Radvanovsky in the extra features. This was her first try at the gig, and she proves more polished and at ease on microphone duties than any of her fellow Met stars to date -- she might well have succeeded as a media personality. She even makes a charming segment of a visit with the horses.",1339200000,35,8251,4.956647398843931

5086938,5,B007HLUA1Y,"I remember seeing on PBS a previous Met production with Placido Domingo, June Anderson, and Sherill Milnes, and this is the identical, realistic production, so much so that it nearly looks like a movie.  As theater, it is a well-acted, detail-rich entertainment.  I'm not qualified to discuss the quality of the singing, but I enjoyed it thoroughly.  There are no famous arias, yet the emotions come through Puccini's score.  The New York Times review stated it isn't time for a re-invention of this opera, and agreed the lavish, realistic setting was the right choice.  I also agree it would've been a nice touch had the stars departed by horse (several are used in the production).  The extras are much welcomed, hosted by Sondra Radvanovsky.  Deborah Voigt owns the role with much charisma and charm, and superb acting.  Lucio Gallo, the Sheriff Jack Rance, is thoroughly menacing (not a Scarpia) yet conflicted.  And Marcello Giordani is very believable at Dick Johnson.  And all the cowboys are outstanding. Too bad I couldn't see this live or at the movie theater, but it's great to watch at home, and a worthy addition to a DVD opera collection.",1370217600,3,1152,4.891752577319588
5086939,5,B007HLUA1Y,"I just ordered this video again because I gave my copy to a friend. Although I have watched it many times, I do not want to be without it, because it rewards repeated viewings.

When the 100th anniversary of this, Puccini's favorite opera, approached, many opera companies asked Deborah Voigt to star in their Fanciulla productions. She appeared in 3, with the San Francisco, Chicago Lyric, and NY Metropolitan Operas. I'm glad this is the one available on video because I like the realistic approach to sets and costumes, with horses. Also, I enjoy Ms. Voigt's chemistry with her Italian tenor, baritone and conductor. I very much enjoy her singing. It is strong, has beauty and character, and her diction is excellent. I saw her sing live at the Met 3 weeks ago and she was a fine Brunnhilde in Gotterdammerung, Here, she is a very engaging, lovely and moving Minnie. I can't get enough of the last ten minutes of Act I, where she goes from heroic to wistful to sad to lovestruck and nails each emotion in her scene with Marcello Giordani's Dick Johnson. Act II is even better, where Minnie has her hands full with Johnson and Sheriff Rance (Lucio Gallo), who both want her, and who can blame them?

The extras - interviews with cast, conductor and crew are informative and fun. I've shown this to even non-opera-going friends, and they enjoy the Old West setting, the exciting story and the beautiful music. Subtitles in several languages make it easy to follow. We also enjoy picking up on which pieces of music sound suspiciously like ""Phantom"" songs, (i.e.""Music of the NIght'), which of course came along much later.",1368921600,8,1623,4.75177304964539

5086941,5,B007HLUA1Y,"5 stars because of an excellent, fast-paced production.  However, the first two acts, while presenting a good story, lack the musicality and excellent interplay of voices I expect in a puccini opus.  The third act, which finally presents us with the kind of aria I look forward to from Puccini, almost makes up for the lack of such vocal interplay I enjoy, but the opera as a whole seems unbalanced in that respect.  Still, a great story, with a more cohesive and believable plat than many operas.",1361577600,3,497,4.689655172413793

All of the roles, even the minor ones, are perfectly realized and limned with the greatest artistic skill and sensitivity that I've encountered in an opera performance in a very long time.  My eyes literally became moist many times during the course of this extremely creative production.  The vocalism, conducting, and musicianship of all involved are intensely beautiful.  The production values, sets and costumes are of the highest achievement and Puccini's music has to be some of the most sublime he has written.  Vocalists Voigt, Gallo and Giordani and Maestro Luisotti are triumphant.",1346803200,10,667,5.254716981132075
5086945,4,B007HLUA1Y,"La Fanciulla del West has become my favorite opera in recent years. I owe this to the DVD from the early 1990s with Barbara Daniels & Placido Domingo at the Met, and which has the same wonderful set. Also, I love the older recording from 1958 with Renata Tebaldi, which is absolutely terrific on CD. (I hate the other productions of La Fanciulla on DVD, but will say no more about them.) I saw this production w/ Deborah Voigt in person and at the movie theatres and I can honestly say I loved it because I love La Fanciulla so much. But Mr. Giordani is a mediocre singer, as is Mr. Gallo. (At the performance I attended in Dec. 2010, someone shouted ""Disastro!"" right after Gallo's big song.) But they are not awful. And Ms. Voigt is great. Her acting is very affecting and her voice is in more than decent shape. Much like Barbara Daniels and Renata Tebaldi, she made this role her own and can be very proud of it. The set/production are absolutely wonderful. Thank God the Met didn't trash it, as they have some other great older sets and productions. This is a Puccini masterpiece, with ravishing music. Strangely, though it's quite a melancholy opera, it has a happy if bittersweet ending. And no one dies in the whole thing!",1344988800,3,1230,4.495535714285714
5086946,5,B007HLUA1Y,"Having staged the world premiere in 1910 with Puccini in the audience it is right and fitting that the Met should make a special effort for this centenary production and with only a few minor quibbles they have come up trumps. This disc is already on release in Europe and America should not wait when it is released in the US. The cast is excellent throughout. Deborah Voigt handles the dramatically difficult role of the Wild West bar owner who has given most of her early life to ""her miners"" and suddenly finds love in the arms of the not very evil bandit, Johnson, quite brilliantly. Giordano as Johnson is also excellent. The staging is, thank God, much as it must have been in 1910 with no pandering to egotistical directors out to be different just for the sake of it! Lucio Gallo as Jack Rance was superb. led on by what must have a been a lonely life set against his powerful position as sheriff, the temptation to see Minnie as his by right is easy to understand and despite usually being portrayed as the embodiment of evil, his gesture at the end of acceptance of the inevitable is that of a gentleman at heart.
As usual the Met interlaces the opera with behind the scenes interviews and added information. These are all very well done and nicely presented by the charismatic Sondra Radvanovsky, but I do wish they would allow the opera to flow straight through. This is so easy with today's menu technology and good as they are I do NOT want to see them every time I enjoy this excellent disc. One must click the scene change button to move on but one should not need such an intrusion.
The opening menu, sound and camera work are all excellent but the lighting is low and the color balance is heavily dominated by browns. This means the cameras struggle to optimise focus with the wide lens settings such a situation demands. As a consequence the resolution and color is less than I would have liked.
Overall this is an outstanding production and puts all other video productions of La Fanciulla to the sword. The recent Dutch production has better color and the picture is much sharper but in all other respects cannot compare to this wonderful traditional performance. Quite the best Met Blu-ray disc I have seen and a standard to aim for in the future. The booklet is also exceptionally well written. The price is also very low at the moment. The bargain of the year!",1341100800,11,2385,4.5488372093023255

8516681,5,B007HLUA1Y,"I could say that this is one of my  favourite operas. Maybe at the top 5. It has a beautiful score, exotic location (specially if you are from Spain) and a happy ending. I have watched many times this one and still I adore the Zampieri/Domingo/Maazel (don't judge me! :))
This production is sumptuous, maybe too classic, but I  like it. You have your saloon, you have the horses, the cowboys, it is comofrting. And we have Deborah. She is great in this production. Her Minnie is innocent, hopeful, romantic, tough . She is splendid in this production and in the second, act just perfect.
Lucio Gallo is the real love of my life in this production. A great baritone who has a wide repertoire with Mozart, Verdi and Rossini is  the winner in this production. Rance is a difficult character to play because, let's face it the guy is a stalker and yes, he tries to rape Minnie. But when  Rance is played by the right singer , the second act is his. And Gallo wins. he is naughty, funny, evil, rude and with Gallo full of humour. You will adore him!
Because this is a commemorative production of the MET you have the regulars here, like Dwayne Croft who sings a very good Sonora and the orchestra conducted by Luisotti is compact and classic in  the performance, devoted to make the singers shine.. All the singers? well, no. Then comes  Giordani.......Well, what can I say about him? He is a good singer. Great voice, full of power, very Italian in his way of singing but he never acts. If you  were just listening to him, that would be great. Just like with Pavarotti. His voice is wonderful and it is a very classic one, in the good sense but on stage  he is like a tree in the middle of the stage.  But he sings a nice Ramirez and there is chemistry with Ms Voigt so this is a very recommendable version and surely you will enjoy it.",1509494400,,1832,4.364705882352941

What a mistake (although it is nice to discover a great work later in life, too). Wonderfully original, with a powerful central character, Minnie, a truly a liberated woman who dictates her own terms in a man's world.  The cast is excellent - although Carol Nesbitt's Minnie with Placido Domingo as Dick Johnson on an earlier Met CD has better singing.  Lots of fun, and quite beautiful in its own way, I read that it was Puccini's favorite child - and I'm almost of the same mind. Also, if you're a Puccini fan like me, another lovely Puccini ""sleeper"" I recently discovered, La Rondine, is also very much worth your time - most gorgeously sung by Te Kanawa, Domingo and David Rendall - absolutely superb!",1466035200,,878,4.645161290322581
8516684,5,B007HLUA1Y,"This excellent Deutsche Grammophon Blu-ray DVD was made during a Metropolitan Opera company performance of La Fanciulla del West in December 2010.  The performance marked the centenary of the world premiere of the opera at the old Metropolitan Opera in 1910 with Caruso as Ramirrez or Dick Johnson, Emmy Destinn as Minnie, Pasquale Amato as Jack Rance and Arturo Toscanini as the conductor.  Puccini helped in the production of the opera and was present in the audience on the night of the premiere.

Apart from the fact that it is set in America La Fanciulla del West differs significantly from other Puccini operas in the unusual character of its heroine Minnie.  Most Puccini heroines are vulnerable women who are often victims of one sort or another.  Some are victims of illness (e.g. Mimi in La Boheme); others are victims of villainous men (e.g. Cio- Cio-San in Madama Butterfly, Manon in Manon Lescaut, Giorgetta in Il Tabarro and the diva Tosca in Tosca) or villainous family members (e.g. Angelica in Suor Angelica).  All of these heroines suffer tragic fates or die at the ends of the operas.

Minnie differs from all of them.  She is not a victim of anything but shows remarkable strength as the owner of the Polka saloon in dealing with the masculine society that surrounds her at a California mining camp during the gold rush.  She mothers the lonely and homesick miners in a good-humored and affectionate way.  She is full of pluck as when at the end of Act III she rescues her lover from the scaffold.  She is able to manipulate and control the villainous Sheriff Rance.  At the same time she can be coquettish and tender and even girlish as in her budding romance with Ramirrez the bandit.  Her main feature though is her strength.  Unusually for a Puccini opera, the heroine prevails.  Indeed, at the end of the opera she and Ramirrez traditionally ride off into the California sunset and Minnie has got it all!

Minnie, in my opinion, has many more facets to her character than any other Puccini heroine.  She therefore needs to be portrayed by a singer who not only can deal with the high notes and the huge demands the role makes in terms of tessitura but who can project the character of the heroine without being too melodramatic.  The Met in selecting Deborah Voigt for the centenary production showed remarkable foresight.  It would be hard to think of any other current soprano who could pull of this difficult task with the excellence that she brings to it.  She is totally convincing in the role both dramatically and vocally.  I doubt whether we will ever see a better Minnie!  Her Laggiu nel Soledad in Act I is magnificent.

Marcello Giordano sings beautifully and is convincing as the bandit with the tender heart.  Not since Domingo have I heard the Act III aria Chella mi creda libero e lontano sung so beautifully and poignantly.  Lucio Gallo is suitably villainous as Sheriff Rance.  However, he does not overdo the role and shows some nuances that make him less evil than, for example,  Baron Scarpia in Tosca.  He has a large baritone voice and his Act I aria Minnie della mia casa son partito is beautifully sung and quite moving.  Nicola Luisotti does a wonderful conducting job.  The Met chorus is magnificent as the homesick miners.  Among the lesser roles Keith Miller stands out as Ashby of Wells Fargo and Dwayne Croft is a sympathetic Sonora.  Tony Stevenson is excellent and amusing as the bartender Nick.

The most striking emotions in the opera are those of nostalgia and homesickness.  Everyone longs for something lost.  Minnie remembers her childhood days with great affection and the miners miss their families back at home.  The entry of the roving minstrel Jake Wallace in Act I singing his sad song - Che faranno i vecchi miei  about the old folks back at home is sure to break the hearts of even the most hardened cynics.  The production is by Giancarlo del Monaco and uses old-fashioned and realistic sets that capture the spirit of the Wild West as we all know it from movies.  There is no need here for experimentation or a gratuitous change in the time period of the opera.  The setting is exactly how Puccini would have desired it to be and as was captured in David Belascos play on which the opera is based.

I think that ""Fanciulla"" is the most underrated of Puccini operas.  This may be because of the spaghetti western story.  Certainly, the Americanisms mixed into the Italian libretto can be somewhat discordant if one cannot appreciate the camp element underlying them.  However, the story is plausible and the opera is full of beautiful music and melody.  Indeed, it could be argued that Fanciulla may contain Puccinis most boldly modern music.  This DVD by Deutsche Grammophon brings out all the facets of the opera that Puccini intended.  The production values are excellent.  I highly recommend it both to opera lovers who know the opera well and to those who have not seen it before.",1432252800,6,4957,4.749414519906323

None of them have much interest in opera, although probably like most Americans, they've been invited (or coerced) into attending two or three times in their lives.  Mom was delighted to hear she was born in Puccini's lifetime (8 days before he died, to be exact).

Well, it was more a ladies' gabfest than a serious opera screening, but I do recommend as a family get-together, far better than something depressing like Butterfly or Tosca, those Puccini staples often foisted on beginners.

A few choice tidbits of conversation:

Q. ""So are those real cowboys?""
A. ""No dear, they are actually opera singers.""

Q. ""You say they're just opera singers dressed up like cowboys?""
A. ""Yes dear, just like in a movie, they are not really cowboys, just actors dressed up like cowboys.""

Q. ""Oh look, he has a nice butt.""
A. ""How disgusting!""

Q. ""My God, is that the Girl of the Golden West?  I thought she was supposed to be about 20.  She looks more like 50.""
A. ""She's probably about 40."" (Filthy lie on my part :)

Q. ""40 my eye, why don't they get someone younger to play the part?""
A. ""Because they need someone who can sing out and fill the hall.  It takes years to develop that technique.""

Q. ""Then why don't they just use body-mikes??""
A. ""Well, opera fans would rather hear the natural voices.""

Q. ""But how can they stand watching OLD people play these young parts?""
A. ""You have to get used to it.""

Q.  ""Oh, that Sheriff is cute.""
