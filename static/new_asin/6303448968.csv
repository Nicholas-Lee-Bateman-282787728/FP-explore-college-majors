644503,4,6303448968,"This is an interesting film about England, though it is a thriller and its main objective is to describe a crime and to follow the investigation. But the main part of the film is a chase of the police after two escapees, one of them being the suspected  killer . This chase makes us discover England, a rather old period of it, under a very interesting light. We have a close vision of  Liverpool harbour, of the railway station, of the Lake District, etc. It also shows how a man from the secret services has connections in all quarters of the city and is able to get about everything he wants. It also indicates how the police is unable to cope with an ex-secret-serviceman whereas a man from the secret service can get him rather fast. This escapee knows it and he plans it so that he is just one leap ahead, just enough to escape and bring the real criminal to the trap he lays out for him. It is amazing to discover how many people in England help this man because of his reputation we imagine is positive and because he escapes the police, and thus must be right and has to be helped and protected. This kind of reaction is rather rare in England where the police is very well respected. It is thus necessary to mention it because this  solidarity  is quite uncommon. Apart from that the thriller itself is very well made and the acting is quite good, for a little film of that type. This is also very English, at least in a time when they had a good independent cinema industry : even a little film had good actors, which was and still is far from being the case in the USA.

7846774,4,6303448968,"After being forced out of the British Secret Service, an ex-agent (Trevor Howard) accepts a position cataloging butterflies at a country estate. There, he falls in love with a strange girl (Jean Simmons). When the girl is accused of murdering a gamekeeper (Maxwell Reed), the ex-agent and the girl go on the run with the police and secret service in full pursuit. The term Hitchcockian is overused and often applied to almost any routine thriller. In this particular case however, the appellation is justified. Directed by Ralph Thomas from an original screenplay by Janet Green (Ford's 7 WOMEN), this is a well crafted thriller in the style of THE 39 STEPS with a marvelous red herring in the plot to point you in the wrong direction. The score is by Benjamin Frankel (NIGHT OF THE IGUANA). With Kenneth More, Barry Jones, Sonia Dresdel, Geoffrey Keen, Marianne Stone and Eric Pohlmann.

The Eureka DVD via Great Britain is, for the most part, a decent transfer. It's a little rough around the edges but not enough to distract from your enjoyment.",1342310400,,1048,4.854748603351955
7846775,5,6303448968,"This video is exactly like the original film viewed in the 1950's.  Full of mystery and intrigue and suspense.  I loved it, thanks so much for helping me locate a beloved movie!!!",1335484800,,179,4.5625
7846776,3,6303448968,"First it is a pleasant surprise to discover that a film renamed ""Tragica Obsesion"" and coming via Spain turns out to be the original ""Clouded Yellow"" with English soundtrack. The original film title refers to a species of butterfly and I think the Spanish should have stuck with that. It isn't a tragedy and ""Obsession"" doesn't capture the spirit of the story. It's a lightweight Hitchcock-ish story a bit like the original ""The Man who Knew Too Much"": people on the run from the police and heading for the high country. It would have been more enjoyable if the hero (Trevor Howard) had been a someone warmer, (Who would want to spend their love life with such a grim, cryptic stiff-upper lip character?) And Jean Simmons has to play a girl who thinks she's mucked  up mentally when she isn't. Kenneth Moore is there but his tilt towards a sympathetic change of heart is starved to death, if you'll excuse the mixed metaphor.  Overall it's worth watching if you like these English thrillers, but the story writers should really have worked much harder to produce an interesting unravelling instead of treating us to one more race around the industrial rooftops before the villain falls under a conveniently passing train. My impression is that the film unit rushed into the script-writer's study and snatched the script away several weeks before they should have so that all the setting up at the start is quite wasted. It's the equivalent of a British post-war dinner party at the height of rationing..",1290988800,,1503,4.821705426356589
7846777,3,6303448968,"This is Hitchcock material, a seemingly low-keyed domestic situation in a country house where an out-of-work spy (Howard) takes a temp job cataloguing a butterfly collection. Under the somewhat strained surface we discover all manner of tensions involving an emotionally disturbed niece (Simmons) and a local cad who appears carrying dead rabbits and is a heartthrob of the lady of the house. A murder sets the plot in motion, and when suspicion turns toward the presumably unstable Simmons, Howard whisks her away to London and points north - or more accurately north by northwest. Eventually the couple is crossing the Lake Country with Scotland Yard in hot pursuit. There's a breathtaking sequence in the shipyards of Liverpool as the actual murderer joins the chase.

Hitchcock would have squeezed more eerie suspense out of the domestic scene and more shades of psychological complexity from the leads. Howard hardly breaks a sweat, and there's never any ambiguity about his interest in the girl or the ""mistake"" he made previous to the first reel that got him thrown out of intelligence work. Meanwhile, there's hardly any doubt that the girl could be potentially murderous. The moody night scenes while the two are on the run make the most of black and white photography, and for Anglophiles, the glimpses of post-war Britain are interesting, but at best the film is a minor classic. For another portrayal by Simmons as a piano-playing psycho who gets involved with a guy who tries to rescue her, see ""Angel Face.""",1256428800,,1521,5.035714285714286
7846778,3,6303448968,"The after war life in England and the special views of Liverpool then are very interesting. The Overhead Liverpool Railway, which was demolished in 1957 is shown in this DVD.",1240358400,,174,4.833333333333333
7846779,3,6303448968,"I guess in the fifties this must have been exciting but in that respect it doesn't stand the test of time.  I found it mildly interesting as I might find a museum piece or a bit of social history: Britain in the age when rationing was still in force.  And of course, it's always of interest to see stalwarts of the British post war movie industry doing their thing but there are so much better films to watch than this.  It represents something of a decline for Howard when set against masterpieces like Carol Reed's The Third man or David Lean's Brief Encounter and neither does it stand comparison with Hitchcock's early British thrillers with which it's been bracketed.

As a nostalgia piece it's okay but great cinema it aint!",1235088000,,730,4.592307692307692
7846780,5,6303448968,"This was the first ""grown-up"" film I saw, when it was first released, back in 1951.  It was on TV the other night and I found it as exciting as ever, full of psychological mystery and exhilarating chases against some beautiful scenery.  Trevor Howard would be a match for Daniel Craig anytime and Jean Simmons is lovely as the vulnerable trapped ""butterfly"" of the title.  I highly recommend it to anyone who liked ""The 39 Steps"" or ""North by Northwest""",1182470400,,453,4.6375
