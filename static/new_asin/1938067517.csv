204622,5,1938067517,I so enjoyed this I have already watched it 3 time and looking forward to share it with my friends .,1415750400,10,100,3.8095238095238093
204623,5,1938067517,"If you are one of the fortunate people to be reading my review right now, I say ""God Bless You!

What I mean by that statement is that it is wonderful that God has lead you here to know more about what He is doing and planning.

What these brothers in Christ have put together is nothing short of life changing.  This video will answer many of the questions that you may have, and bring up ones you've never thought of.

There is one topics that I question:  That being their thinking that the AntiChrist will allow/force the Temple to be rebuilt next to the Dome on the Rock.  I seriously doubt that the Muslim world will go into Israel and ""build"" anything....  Their's is blood lust.  and it is coming soon.

My personal opinion (based on what I have studied) is that the Lord is coming back in 2018.  Watch Turkey and their President (Erdogan).  He may very well be the ""little horn"" and sweap down to Israel in the next couple years.  FYI:  Research him - He is building a Mosque in Istanbul called ""Camlica Hill Mosque"" - it seats 30,000 + people.  This will be ""his"" version of Hitler's Nuremberg.  Completion date - summer 2016 (it's already halfway done).

Also, I recommend you read the ""Mideast Beast"" by Joel.  This video plus that book are Very informing.",1415318400,31,1268,4.443478260869565
204624,5,1938067517,"While this movie wasn't without a dramatic soundtrack and such, it was actually a very balanced, clear, and biblical assessment of how current events (especially in the middle east) relate to Bible prophecy. I am not going to name names here, but most people cause me to roll my eyes and sigh when they talk about the end times in sensational, exaggerated, and extra biblical reasoning. This movie focuses only on clear sign events and sign trends in the Bible (and the current events that make it seem quite probable that more signs will occur soon, although who knows how long soon is).

Many of these realities I have though about previously (such as the need for the jewish temple to be rebuilt on the Jewish temple mount, which made me assume the dome of the rock would have to be destroyed), and this documentary helped me see that that the temple may be rebuilt beside the dome of the rock WITH THE HELP OF MUSLIMS! I had no idea that any muslim leader would even consider supporting the re-building of a Jewish temple, but apparently it is in the Quran.

Joel puts a lot of focus on the significance of Israel's rebirth as a nation and on Egypt in biblical prophecy. He also examines Islamic eschatology and the similarities/differences between Biblical eschatology... very interesting. I should also mention the introduction to the movie was a very clear and concise call to why it is important to live in light of the urgency of the hour, as Paul and the apostles did. A focus on eschatology is Biblical, not for fringe cults or the academic elite. I hope this will create more healthy discussion in mainstream Christianity.

Also, this documentary does not talk about or focus the rapture and its timing at all, but I'm pretty sure the perspective falls broadly within the scope of premillennial theology.

This is the only documentary of its kind I would recommend to any believer.",1414972800,38,1893,4.709969788519637
204625,5,1938067517,"Like Richardson's other books and DVDs, his latest release is full of biblical insights into the rapidly evolving scenario of MIddle Eastern geopolitics. This is not an armchair account of End Time theory given by some comfortable theologian; nor is it a frantic warning about an imminent falling of the sky. Rather, this is a well-researched documentary that includes actual footage shot on location as the Arab Spring arrived in Istanbul Turkey. Richardson takes the viewer through an easy-to-follow (and yet sobering) panorama of unfolding events that were foretold by the ancient Hebrew prophets. Some are ripped from today's headlines, others offer fascinating insight through interviews that you will never see in any mainstream media outlet regardless of political stripe. These are perilous and yet exciting times. Do yourself and your family, your friends, and your church a huge service- get this documentary and watch it with them.",1414713600,21,942,5.371621621621622
204626,5,1938067517,"This DVD is for those who are trying to make sense of rapidly changing Middle East developments and how they fit in God's prophetic plan as foretold in the Bible.  Joel Richardson interviews a wide variety of relevant parties as he narrates the biblical signs to reveal how these events are playing out on a global basis that Christians need to know as they ready themselves for the return of Jesus from the Bible.  Joel is a responsible documentarian and does not sensationalize the information, but calmly lays out for the viewers occurrences they may not have realized are connected with biblical prophecy.  For those unfamiliar with the prophetic Word of God, this will be fantastic to see and a true encouragement to know exactly how close we are in ending this fallen, evil age and have the true righteous King ruling on earth as he ushers in the Kingdom of God on earth as it is now in heaven.

204641,5,1938067517,There has never been a greater work than this of joel Richardson's regarding end time prophecies and where we are on God's calendar! As a high school Bible teacher I felt it was something all of my students should know and showed the DVD in its entirety to all of them. As Christians we should  be the best informed on that is going on and where we are on God's time table and Richardson's DVD does just that.  The way it is divided into sections each about ten minutes make it most suitable for use in class room settings.  This is one of my most prized DVD's and I know I will revist it many times in the future as we continue to look at fulfillment of Bible prophecies.,1432857600,2,672,4.1937984496124034

204668,5,1938067517,"I watched this documentary 4 times last night---IMPRESSIVE!!! (I have previously read Richardson's books ""The Islamic Antichrist"" and his more recent ""Mideast Beast."" I highly recommend them both). One important element of this documentary is that Richardson points out the error of Replacement Theology / Supersessionism held by so many in the Western church today. Toward the end, he shows how theological beliefs such as Amillennialism can, and sometimes do, lead to the church being antagonistic toward modern Israel. I appreciate that the DVD sets forth 8 well-supported signs that we are nearing the end.

The 8 signs:

1) The rebirth of the State of Israel (1948)
2) Trends toward rebuilding the Jewish Temple
3) The rise of false prophets and Islam's Messiah (Islam's expected ""Mahdi"")
4) Daniel 11 and the Arab Spring
5) Isaiah 19 and Egypt (Aswan Dam & its effect on Nile, etc.)
6) The rise of Turkey (President Erdogan's desire to see Turkey as head of revived Caliphate and Ottoman Empire)
7) The rise of ISIS in Iraq and Syria
8) The rise of global anti-Semitism

If I could afford to, I would buy this DVD for every Christian I know. Its message is **crucial** for our time.

Finally, my favorite quote from the film: ""So despite the claims of many, even within the church, who say that the Lord is done with the land and the people of Israel, the fact of the matter is it's easy to see that if that's true, Satan clearly has not received the memo. What's clear is that, right now, the rage of Satan continues to be vented directly against that people and that specific piece of land.""  - Joel Richardson",1422057600,22,1618,4.723404255319149

204670,5,1938067517,"For those of you who follow Joel Richardson, you know that his interpretation of biblical eschatology differs from the mainstream approach and conclusions. This BY NO MEANS makes it unbiblical. Rather, I believe that his research has helped to hone and correct many interpretations of end times theology which are in error.

I believe that I am doing him justice by saying that his approach to biblical eschatology centers on the view that ALL end-times prophecy is centered on - and ONLY on - the Middle East. So, for example, there will be no rise of an Italian army. Nor will Russia lead an invasion into Israel. For those of you who have been steeped in this doctrine, I encourage you to look at what Joel has written in his books and has produced in this fantastic video.

In this video, Mr. Richardson has visually represented the core aspects of his book, ""The Mideast Beast"" in an extraordinary way. If, like me, you are impressed with his previous work, you will very much enjoy this video. If you are not familiar with his views on biblical end-times, you will find this video to be an extremely well done production explaining his view of how end times events will unfold in the Middle East.

Read his books. Watch this video. You will have your eyes opened to biblical truths that you may never have been exposed to in the past.",1421452800,6,1340,4.598326359832636

But who really cares because ""religion is not healthy for children and other sentient beings"" and besides who is he to tell other what to believe and not to believe for the sake of an invisible god. ""Jesus Christ said his father is an invisible spirit that cannot be seen by human eyes"", so what was Moses looking at on that mountain called Sinai when he hair turned white? I still have a hard time believing in this stuff because there are missing books to the bible that still have not been found and/or translated. Jesus Christ was not god but the son of God sent by someone (?) But who was or is that someone that we do not know and cannot see. I heard something interesting today that stated the group called Boko Haram in Islamic language means ""Western Education is sinful"".

204686,5,1938067517,"After writing the books of the Islamic Antichrist and the Mideast Beast, Joel Richardson now visualizes his well organized, Scripturally based, diligently studied and scholarly formed thesis on the times we are living in, Israel's unchanging significance in God's plans, the coming of the Messiah and on the Islamic Antichrist in his new documentary.

If you have already read the first two books I mentioned above, then you will find this documentary pretty useful because there are still new aspects that Joel Richardson reflects in the movie. It is also a good and concise visual of the main elements of the thesis, and also of the recent movements such as things that are happening in Turkey.

If you haven't read the books yet, then End Times Eyewitness documentary will be so helpful for you to make a good start to the subject we are talking about here. The movie mentions the main truths/arguments of the thesis in a very concise yet informing way. I would recommend to read the Islamic Antichrist and the Mideast Beast to have a better Biblical understanding and foundation on the topic.

There's a lot of crazy videos, articles and pockets of ideas out there regarding the same or similar topic that Joel Richardson teaches in the documentary, and in his books. But his work is so but so distinctive than most of the others. He makes his points completely in base of the Biblical text. He does not draw his conclusion from what may seem to be happening in the earth today but rather he brought fort his interpretations of the Biblical text with the Biblical text, and then use it as the starting point in his parallel of it to the current events that are currently happening in the earth. His works are surely worth of respect and give an ear.

From the technical media perspective, you may find the documentary not so a Hollywood like product. Yet it is certainly not a junk or completely amateur work. In fact, the movie gives you a feeling of chill while watching; the feeling you get when watching an epic war movie. :)

As we are living in such times, we need Biblically sourced prophetic voices in our generation. Ones who diligently study the word of God and who are students of prophecy that keep a solid personal relationship with the Lord on a cultivating spirit to have revelation from the Father to speak to the Church today. Joel Richardson, in my understanding, is one of those voices. In fact, I can even say that he is one of the very first ones to bring this kind of ministry to the church today with such anointing. His study and understanding of the Scriptures are precious to the Church today as the very works of the Holy Spirit, I believe.

As I suggest you to watch this movie, and read his books, I would also like to invite you to pray for Joel Richardson and what the Lord is doing in and through him.

I've thoroughly enjoyed the End Times Witness documentary movie. It helped connect my heart to the reality we are having in the earth today but merely to the grand plan of God concerning Israel, the last generation before the return of our Lord Jesus Christ and to the heart of the Father for all humanity. I pray that you would have the same kind of touch by the Lord in a greater measure as you watch the documentary movie and read his books.

Blessings.",1416441600,12,3295,4.563451776649746
