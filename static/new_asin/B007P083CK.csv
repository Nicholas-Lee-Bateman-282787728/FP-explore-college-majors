8520061,4,B007P083CK,i have looked forward to seeing this film for a long time....magnani is magnificent as always but why french subtitles?...i need subtitles because i am  hard of hearing...brazzi in a villainous role is unusual and his death at the hands of magnani incredible...the quick denoument was excellent,1490054400,,294,5.25531914893617
