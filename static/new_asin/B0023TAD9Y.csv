8350038,5,B0023TAD9Y,"I love this DVD. I am a Puerto Rican Italian, and this is the kind of food I want to learn to make. Brings back memories. Daisy is so pretty and I love the way she seems to enjoy the food! She dances and talks spanish when she is happy. I love to watch her. ""Buen Provecho!"" I hope I spelled that right!",1306195200,2,303,3.8253968253968256
8350039,5,B0023TAD9Y,"This is a nice book with some really great recipes . I made the marinaded pork chops and the Puerto Rican marinaded pork shoulder , both turned out great. both were work but the outcome was well worth it. Dasiey has some down to earth easy to follow recipes. The Spanish rice was a big hit too. Highly recommend this and her other cook books. Try it , You'll like it.",1276300800,4,367,4.183098591549296
