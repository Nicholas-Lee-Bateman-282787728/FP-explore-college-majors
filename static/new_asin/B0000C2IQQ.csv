1909872,5,B0000C2IQQ,"I Loved this movie, it showed what things were like that we did not see on Rose Red.",1067817600,4,84,3.7222222222222223
1909873,1,B0000C2IQQ,"The novel upon which this movie is based was written as an accompaniment to the Stephen King miniseries ""Rose Red,"" and was a decent enough attempt to broaden the characters and situations King created for that film.  This movie, which reunites King (as an executive producer, which I suspect means he merely cashed the check he was given), author Ridley Pearson (who wrote the tie-in novel), and Craig Baxley (who directed both films), is one of the worst in the King filmography.  It is appallingly boring, from beginning to end.  I kid you not: nothing of interest happens the entire time.  My memory of the novel is a bit sketchy, but I don't remember being so bored by it that I considered not even finishing, as was the case with this movie.  The characters are cardboard-thin, with no insights of ANY sort into their motivations.  Why is Rose Red so drawn to Ellen?  Why is John such a terrible person?  Why does Sukeena agree to move continents away from her home for this family?  Don't expect any such answers from this movie, for you will not get them.  Nor will you get one single scene that has anything resembling a scare.  ""Rose Red,"" though highly derivative, is a fairly entertaining and well-made movie, but this one is DOA.
The only people I would reccommend this movie for are people who, like myself, feel compelled to own everything that has Stephen King's name on it.  Everyone else, consider yourself warned.",1067385600,12,1432,4.706827309236948

1909875,2,B0000C2IQQ,"If I need a Rose Red fix, Ill stick with Rose Red.  Although it seemed to follow the set up story line, it could have been done so much better.  Not really sure what else to say.  It wasn't the worst movie Id ever seen.  Ill leave that honor to Sausage Party.",1511913600,4,259,3.923076923076923

1909892,3,B0000C2IQQ,"A prequel to Rose Red, The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer is focused more on the Rimbauer family than on the house. There are some haunted moments and the house does let it's presence be known, but not in any way that is scary. That said, it is still an interesting movie. I would have given it 4 stars but the sound is messed up at the 1 hour 11-minute mark and the repeated bursts of loud static about killed my ears.",1483833600,2,412,4.098765432098766
1909893,2,B0000C2IQQ,"Definitely not what I thought it would be.  I thought this was based on a Stephen King book or short story.  It's not.  Stephen only had his hand in the movie that was based on a novel by another author.  That is why I really didn't like this flick.  There's nothing scary about it.  It moves along very sluggishly and the moments that should have been frightening were more like a TV series back in the 80s.  I don't want to be too harsh since I've read some of the other reviews.  It isn't bad.  It just isn't Stephen King, whom I enjoy because he scares the heck out of me.  LOL!",1480636800,2,582,4.116071428571429

1909944,4,B0000C2IQQ,"This is the prequel to Stephen King's ""Rode Red"" except it is not written by Stephen King.  The setting is early century in Seattle. Ellen (Lisa Brenner)  has married John Rimbauer, (Steven Brand)  a man who can't control his passions. The house, named ""Rose Red"" becomes a controlling entity of its own. It is expand to such great lengths as to dwarf the Biltmore.

The production is similar to a Victorian ghost story. The scare factor didn't transmit well to the audience, you saw things coming. Rated ""R"" for sexuality, but all nudity is from the back. No swearing. Some sex scenes. Similar to a Masterpiece Theater production. Good acting.",1437955200,5,644,4.827272727272727

In general, however, I found the acting flat/one dimensional and the pace slow.  With a house as complex and full of intrigue as I saw in Rose Red, I expected far more complexity and richness in the backstory.  Have to agree with other reviewers who said this film left me wanting a whole lot more.  So-So for Rose Red fans only.

The movie seemed rushed to me.  Especially the scenes where they were traveling around the world.  I had a hard time seeing the characters connect and the storyline could have been much better.  The sex scenes to me seemed to make no sense at all or add to the movie for it's time back then and seemed unbelievable.

1910064,5,B0000C2IQQ,"I've loved ""Rose Red"" since I first saw it, so when I saw ""The Diary"" on TV one night, I just had to watch it. I knew what to expect in the plot (obviously), but they DID make some changes. The biggest changes, in my opinion, were to the psychic and the way they handled Posey's suicide. In this version, Madame Lu (not Stravinsky/Cora Fry) was an actual Chinese mystic with actual paranormal senses. I liked that much better than the ""mystic"" in the other film, who was a fake. Madame Lu and Sukeena became good friends, which is another thing I really enjoyed. As for Douglas Posey...in ""Rose Red"" he had Adam and April watch while he hung himself in front of them, after giving them his hat and a rose. The kids watched impassively, not caring that the man they considered to be an ""uncle"" had just killed himself in front of their eyes. I always hated that part. But in ""The Diary"", Posey hugs them and tells them that they are going to play hide and seek--just to get them away from the room so they won't watch him suicide. I MUCH prefer that version. It really showed how much he loved them, and I got really attached to his character. It also made the kids seem more real too.

The special effects were pretty much non-existent in this film. At times the dialogue was a little stilted, but I am of the opinion that this is due more to their attempts to stay with the perceived time period. I like this version of Ellen much better too. Thankfully they didn't change Sukeena much at all, and what they added to her story only made me love her more. The plot was handled superbly and everything pretty much matched up to the sequel. We also heard portions of Ellen's diary read aloud through parts of the movie. On a whole, it came across as a drama, not a horror, but a GOOD drama.

I enjoyed this, and I hope you will too.",1240876800,6,1830,4.301449275362319

1910066,4,B0000C2IQQ,"THE DIARY OF ELLEN RIMBAUER was a mini-excursion from my journey through Byzantium.

At first I didn't realize that the film was based on Stephen King's ROSE RED. There were a lot of things about ROSE RED that I didn't like--but I will admit to watching it twice. It had the irritating, stereotypical quality associated with most--not all--film versions of the great horror writer. My rule of thumb: The more involved SK is in the film production, the more irritating it would be. As soon as I realized that DIARY was based on ROSE RED, I couldn't help but think ""Oh, sh-t."" However, at that point I was already drawn in to the point of no return.

I loved it.

Where ROSE RED is overtly obvious, THE DIARY OF ELLEN RIMBAUER is lyrical in its story & visuals. It brought depth & humanity where none existed before. I credit the acting & direction for that. Tsidii Leloka, whose striking physical appearance in ROSE RED as the African Nurse/Companion in little more than a sort of walk-on special effect, is allowed to develope her characterization in DIARY, and that character is allowed to really project the ""feel"" of the production. In fact, all the actors were very good.

The cinematography was excellent & the overal art design impressive.

1910068,4,B0000C2IQQ,"A very strange story in  this film. A story that does not look like Stephen King's traditional stories. Many things are different from what he has ever produced. Strangely enough it comes after the film ""Rose Red"" that is posterior in story time. This story is thus a prequel to the previously shot one. The element that is typically Kingian is the haunted house with some connection to Indians behind. But that is all. The story itself is some kind of distorted and warped ""Gone with the Wind"" in a setting that looks like and sounds like a Victorian house from England's 19th century, the Bronte Sisters maybe. The main character, Ellen Rimbauer herself is more like one of these feminine characters from this English literary period. Little to do with Stephen King's social approach and even historical time. There is even a vodun dimension that is more typical of Anne Rice's witches, especially the last volumes of the vampire series when the witches join the vampires in some kind of old central American chase. Yet the film is outstanding and mesmerizing in its slow rhythm and its slow building of the terror that is attached to the man of the house, to the man that has to be eliminated. But we know better, since we know the sequel that came before the prequel. It is the house that is twisted and warped and not the man who just used the house to get rid of his mistresses and then later of his own children. The question that is not answered though is why the house accepted to be the servant of that man, and what's more why the house accepted to be the justice-bringer, the executioner of the demand for vengeance and retribution from the wife. Can we interpret that as the taking over of the house by the wife and her African servant and confident? I am not sure. It is not all that  clear. What's more there are so many corners in the house that are not on the blue print that we would like to know how all that is possible. Did the house build itself, or grow inside the structure that was given to it, as it is suggested at the end? Maybe. But that is original for Stephen King. In ""The Shining"" the evil Indian spirit is living in the hotel but the hotel is not growing. In ""Salem's Lot"" the vampire takes over the house that welcomes him because of the crime it hosted some time before, but once again the house itself does not grow. There are several other haunted houses in King but never a house that has the power of growing, even if the Dark Tower could be seen as such, though it is not and it is only the  character that is growing through mythical and maybe mystical time as he is going up the tower. The magic comes from somewhere else, not the building itself. And in this case the evil that haunts the house is not very clear, clearly identified. Indian, Irish hence Celtic, or whatever, it is not clear at all. Some elements are not used enough or made explicit enough, like the malformation of the daughter's right arm, and her pushing the little pram around with her doll in it, a Vodun doll? Yet the film is effective in its suspense and dense atmosphere.

When The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer came out, I was interested in seeing it so I bought the movie. Although not as good as Rose Red, this movie is just ok. Set in the early 20th century, this movie shows us why Rose Red became a haunted mansion. It tells the story of Ellen Rimbauer who marries a wealthy man and inherits the mansion named Rose Red. When strange things begin to happen in the mansion beginning with her husband's strange behavior, Ellen begins to question both her husband and what could have happened in this mansion to make it haunted. Crawling with ghosts and spirits, Ellen begins to research Rose Red and doesn't like what she finds. Good special effects but can be boring at times.

The movie would definitely have been better if they were able to tell more (or all) of it according to SK's book: Rose Red -The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer.  Let alone, all SK Constant readers will easily see that it's directly linked to: The Dark Tower saga, The Shining, Salem's Lot, Carrie, The Dead Zone & The Talisman.  I personally love it when SK combines a specific book & characters in other of his works.

1910082,3,B0000C2IQQ,"I've got to give this movie adaptation of Ridley Pearson's book a nod. They tried. They gave this B-movie all the opportunity to succeed.

It just falls short.

Keeping some theme music from its TV-movie ancestor (Rose Red) and getting the same chick to play Sukeena are both HUGE plusses. However, Ellen and especially John are miscast (though both actors soldier through.)

The problem with the movie is that it lacks the feeling of claustrophobia that dominates the book.

What Rose Red owes to The Haunting of Hill House, The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer owes to Rebecca. And maybe super-smooth production values just don't cut it with a child of Rebecca.

All the same, it was fun to watch this book saunter around in movie clothes. But dressing up a book--even a strong one--in movie clothes does not necessarily make it a good movie.

Watch this movie if you liked the book. Just don't expect too much.",1119225600,16,904,4.726114649681529
1910083,4,B0000C2IQQ,"I saw this prior to Rose Red and reading the book and for some strange reason was unaware it was produced by SK. I loved the movie and then of course had to see Rose Red. Personally I felt that RR was a bit hokey. The character of Joyce Reardon in RR was a comic. The characters in Diary were very interesting and kept my attention. However I would have like to seen more of all of them. For those whose copy had ""scene selection"" flaws, may want to return or something. My copy works ok.",1096588800,2,488,4.09375

If you've read the book, well then, you would not be lost but you'd be disapointed at how many elements were left out. Especially the relationship between Ellen and Sukeena.  Many even question why Sukeena ended up in Rose Red in the first place or what was the connection between the two ladies and the fact that their relationship was a lot more intimate . . . those things are revealed in the book.
The fact that Mr. Rimbauer's passions were feeding the house was only touched upon in passing in the movie, but the book lets you know that it was far more complicated then that.
I would suggest that one read the book before seeing the movie(or after, if you've already seen it and then re-watch it- it'll make sense then)",1086307200,31,802,4.448979591836735
1910085,3,B0000C2IQQ,"I agree with some of the other critiques - I'm not sure how well this movie is made in terms of explaining the background of the story.  Rose Red was scary.  Diary is more like a documentary almost.  More drama than horror.  It mainly has to do with a husband and wife ... the wife is permissive and the husband is a jerk who sleeps with other women.  Not sure what that has to do with the house exactly.  I thought they should have focused more on how the house first became haunted.  I feel there should be a prequel to the prequel now.  To explain in more detail what occurred BEFORE all of this.  Like before the house was built.  What was there beforehand (like a cemetery, ancient burial grounds, etc.) and why is it haunted in the first place.  It was not scary.  It wasn't really even suspenseful.  It did keep me interested through the whole movie though and the actress that played Ellen Rimbauer I thought was quite good.  I would suggest seeing this movie if you are a big fan of Rose Red though because it does explain SOME things ... I wish they would make a sequel too though.  ""Rose Red: Part Two - Revenege of the House"", maybe?
As far as the DVD itself goes, what someone else mentioned is true.  If you click on Scene Selections, instead of the scenes for the Diary of Ellen Rimbauer, there are scenes from another movie.  Which is a pretty major mistake, I say!  No one in production caught that???  Come on, that's a pretty big thing to mess up.  Unless... they did it on purpose.... I mean, this is Stephen King we're talking about.  ;)  I plan on writing to the production company to try and figure out the mystery identity of the Scene Selection mess-up.  I'll update when I find out which move it is!",1085356800,56,1725,4.321875
1910086,2,B0000C2IQQ,"The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer is a sequel, or rather a prequel to the very successful Stephen King mini-series ""Rose Red"" a couple of years ago.  The creepy and well-done ghost story about a vast mansion in seattle that continued to build itself even after it was empty.
The prequel tells the story of how the mansion was built by oil magnate John Rimbauer and his marriage to Ellen.  Mr. Rimbauer is, well, he's a sex maniac.  And when he could not get some lovin' from his wife, he more he gladly made use of many of the servant staff in the huge mansion.
All the while Ellen is learning that Rose Red is really alive with a presence that loves her but then becomes jealous and possesive of Ellen, even taking her daughter.  She disappears without a trace and it forces Ellen to remain in the house rather than flee as she is advised to do by a Chinese psychic.
Diary unfortunately doesn't have nearly the scare factor of Rose Red.  You're a good 3/4 of the way into the movie before you detect any remote chill.  Mostly we just get the lurid and sex-crazed life of Mr. Rimbauer.
Not a good sequel and really not needed.",1084924800,10,1120,4.360576923076923

This is a great movie to watched except that, He shouldn't have cut short the accounts of their year of honeymoon and there's also a slight steepness in the story.

1910088,5,B0000C2IQQ,"I actually watched this movie before Rose Red. I think the movie was a great but I think in order to understand ""Rose Red"" you must watch this film. Out of all the fiction writers I ever read or seen, Steven King is by far the greatest author and most creative writer than all others. His imagination is superb. He is truley a mastermind and a masterpiece for todays readers.
 He is indeed the Shakspear of today's world. Ever fiction author looks up to and tries to make their next novel a ""steven king"" hit. Just think what hollywood would be like if there was no Steven King or Steven king want to be.
 Before you make a opinion about this or any other Steven King mastepiece, think what would the world be like if his great mind had never been born. Writers all over the world would lack imagination and would still write after shakspear era.",1078963200,3,846,4.382165605095541

The Rimbauer's entire year of travel was cut into a couple of quick scenes (and they are completely inconsistent with the book).  You are let in on secrets too early and without any background.  Suspense is built on not knowing everything right away.
You never get a sense of Rose Red as a character, when she is supposed to be the driving force of the story.  The movie cut and pasted events and character roles into places where they do not make sense or are ineffective.  I had to force myself to watch the rest of the movie...and it didn't get any better.

Although it explains some of the holes in Rose Red and fills out the characters quite nicely it just didn't hold out. The story is longer than it needs to be and there is little driving force behind the plot. In all honesty I tried to watch this movie 3 times and fell asleep every time.

1910092,2,B0000C2IQQ,"Since the rest of the reviewers on this page have said it best, Ill simply give my two cents and point out a huge screw up on the DVD side of things.
The movie is decent. They use the original sets from Rose Red( which is a big plus because the house is what made the movie in my opinion) the acting is fairly well done and the story sets the stage for Rose Red itself.
BUT there is one huge flaw in the production of this DVD. When you click on the ""scene selection"" option on the menu, another movies clips show up. Yes thats right, Lions Gate put ANOTHER films pictures in the selection menu with titles from The Diary of Ellen Rembauer. Its an asian film from the looks of it, and is also probably much creepier in that just the pictures from this film gave me the jitters.
Well thats it, go check out the movie for its prequal info, and then look at its interesting mess up. And if anyone could tell me what movie they mixed the scene selection up with, Id like to know, it looks rather good!",1069459200,10,997,4.1179487179487175
