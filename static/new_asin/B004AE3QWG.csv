8420096,5,B004AE3QWG,"Like Showtime's ""Resurrection Blvd"" of some years back, this isn't so much a series about boxing as it is a series of what and how boxing affects the lives of the people in it.

I agree with the other 2 reviewers in their comments and will only add that perhaps either HBO or Showtime who have long been supporters of the ""sweet science"", pick up this series since neither of them have a boxing series at present.

Btw, hey Showtime........when will you release season 2 & 3 of Resurrection Blvd??????",1308873600,,501,4.555555555555555
8420097,5,B004AE3QWG,"This is probably the best show FX has put out. The writing is excellent and the characters are wonderfully real and beautifully flawed. Even if you are not a boxing fan give it a try because it is is very well done.
