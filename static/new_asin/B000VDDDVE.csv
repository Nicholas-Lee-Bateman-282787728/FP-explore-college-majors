2936490,4,B000VDDDVE,"This was a great series, and I've long hoped for its dvd release. Though overpriced at the moment, at least it's available, so I'll keep an eye out for the eventual (inevitable) complete series box set. In the meantime, there's always the local rental place.

Young Indie was my favorite show when it originally aired, and I've retained very fond memories of it ever since. It's nice to see that, though the amount of documentaries included here borders on the absurd, it is getting a full treatment and is not just some rush-job release-it-and-forget-it package that often happens with long-discontinued series.

Young Indiana Jones episodes are filled with all the action, humor, and intelligence you could hope for, and, best of all, (cheezy and clich&eacute;d as this is to say) it really is fun for all ages.",1188345600,25,813,4.927007299270073
2936491,4,B000VDDDVE,"The Young Indiana Jones adventures come to DVD. Agreed I wish it was cheaper but then consider you are dealing with Paramount that charges over $100 per season for any of the Star Trek series. Considering that each episode is an hour and a half movie in itself and this does not seem quite so unreasonable. Furthermore it includes alot of extras whether you want them or not. I grant you I would like to see a 7 disk edition of just the episodes for a substancial savings.  Personally I'm just thrilled to finally see them come to DVD. I am sure if you're patient you can probably get a package deal once all the volumes are released. The first 12-disc set includes seven feature-length episodes as well as 38 in-depth companion documentaries, an historical overview, an interactive game and an interactive timeline. The series was shot in 35 countries and showed key figures in the coming of age of the modern world. The interviews include celebrities like Gen. Colin Powell, Henry Kissinger, Gloria Steinem, Martin Scorsese, Barbara Boxer, James Earl Jones, Hal David, and Deepak Chopra.

This volume includes the episodes (I have described the first story on each disc, they each include a second story):

My First Adventure - Indy and T.E. Lawrence solve a murder mystery in Egypt.

Passion For Life - Indy goes on safari in Kenya with Teddy Roosevelt.

The Perils of Cupid - Indy falls in love with the daughter of Duke Franz Ferdinand in Vienna, Austria.

Travels with Father - Indy joins up with Leo Tolstoy after an argument with his father while visiting Russia.

Journey of Radiance - Indy visits the Holy City Benares in the Far East and meets Jiddu Krishnamurti.

Spring Break Adventure - Indy meets Thomas Edison and tries to avoid German spies.

Love's Sweet Song - Indy ends up in Ireland right before the Easter Rebellion mixed up with the resistance and he meets Winston Churchill.

The second volume is to be released December 2007 and the third volume in the Spring of 2008. If you shop around I think you will find Amazon has the best Pre-order price so far. The suggested retail being advertised several places is over $100. So I'm ordering mine here and now. This set is great family entertainment. It may not always have as much excitement and comedy as the Jone's movies, but it makes up for it in other ways including good drama, history, and locations. I highly recomend this set.

Addendum:

Pro: This set is like seven feature length movies revolving around two stories on each disc. The documentaries created by George Lucas are quite good so please don't rate it based on the price. The whole family will enjoy this set and the movies alone are easily worth $11.50 each. I received my set and viewed the first disc. The first disc was sharp and clear and the first episode and the four documentaries on it were all quite entertaining. I'm looking forward to watching the other 11 discs.

Con: Does not include the scenes of old Indiana Jones. In fact the overall editing is poor. You will notice episodes ending abruptly or jumping to an older Jones, then a younger Jones. The other con is the box is the standard Paramount cheap folding carboard with plastic disc inserts stuck in a flimsy cover like all the Star Trek sets. I would have preferred seven slim plastic DVD cases for the discs put in a firm cardboard cover. Sometimes the greed of Paramount really shows. I don't mind paying the high price for quality. The series is worth the price, I just don't think Paramount should have packaged such a great series in such a cheap box.

If you don't already have this series on some format you may want this set as it may be years before they become available with the cut scenes put back it. If on the other hand you have the original televised series, forget this set and figure a way to get yours transferred to DVD.",1188345600,211,3853,4.622254758418741
2936492,1,B000VDDDVE,"I remember this show very fondly, and would give the show 5 stars based on the content. But OUCH on the price, even at the discounted Amazon price! $75 for 12 episodes -- $6 per episode! SUPER OUCH! I wish the producers would not be so greedy.... I'll have to wait till its about $30, like other shows, or wait till the downloads are available. To the producers: you sell more, and make more, when the price is more reasonable.......",1188345600,21,433,4.425
2936493,5,B000VDDDVE,I remember watching this when I was young. It is inspiring as a kid growing up with all the adventures and it is a good transition to the movie. I will have to rate it when it comes out. But thank you for releasing it on dvd :),1188259200,10,227,3.75

2936507,5,B000VDDDVE,"We, ages 73 and 80, are watching Volume 1 right now.  As noted other reviewers, the movies are gorgeous--locations, authentic looking period clothing, featuring historical figures speaking words they may actually have spoken and dealing with issues they actually  dealt with.  The stories are interesting.  The documentaries are fabulous!  In my opinion, this is the best of the best of family entertainment.  Adults can learn from the documentaries as well.  I am acquainted with educated people, some in the military, who have no idea that slavery was well-established centuries before the plantations of the American South, who Lawrence of Arabia really was, events leading up to WWI and/or what triggered it, the artistic movements that almost predicted cultural, political, and economic changes--Oh, the list could go on and on.

2936509,1,B000VDDDVE,"MASSIVE letdown followed the early life and adventures of Indiana Jones. Sean Patrick Flannery  is terribly miscast, and the little boy who plays Kid Indy was the Jake Lloyd of his time. The whole thing is a horrible demonstration as to what the Star Wars Prequels would eventually offer. Only plus is that this DVD has cut out all the ""Old Indy"" scenes. Nevertheless, this series is a lethargic, lame mess. And the continuity doesn't help. No scar on 20-something Indy's chin (that he got as a boy scout in Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade, Kid Indy being afraid of snakes (something that didn't happen until he was a boy scout and fell into a vat of snakes), and no Marcus or Sallah.",1501977600,,687,4.540322580645161

2936546,4,B000VDDDVE,"I like it but there is a discrepancy in the first episode when they are discussing comparing religions at about 16:16.  Christianity is not about being good and hoping you go to heaven when you die.  It is about much more and it is not works based(doing good things to earn eternal rest). It is a monotheistic religion originating with the Jews of the Bible.  Behavior as a Christian is a response to the love that was shown as God gave Jesus Christ as the perfect sacrifice (compared to the sacrificial system before) to atone for or cover the sins of man. One must submit to God by faith, through the grace and love of Jesus to make God ( Father (Ywh), Son (Jesus the Christ), and Holy Spirit - the triune God) lord or master of their life.  A Christian doesn't do the work, it has already been done.
Considering the first and the third movie center around finding Christian artifacts, and then explore the theme of whether or not finding it brings you closer to God, it should be clear. The script writers seem to brush over this and give greater attention to explaining other religions.
Enjoyed the adventure as always!",1461628800,,1123,4.517241379310345

2936559,4,B000VDDDVE,"Rated 4 stars for amazing location footage and stories.  Debut of Daniel Craig (James Bond) and Catherine Zeta Jones.  George Lucas has so much wealth he can do what he pleases.  Red Tails is a perfect example (the film bombed at the box office).  When little Indiana Jones meets famous Russian writer Leo Tolstoy, we go to Russia with the film crew.  Same in Paris, Italy, Africa, India, etc. -- all filmed on location.  The stories are fantastic as Indy meets people who will go on to be famous (such as a teenage Norman Rockwell).  This is character building for your kids.

One problem is the acting.  It's pretty much awful.  Another is the scripts -- mediocre even with a great story.  My kids didn't know the context (like ""who is Norman Rockwell?"", or this famous Russian writer Tolstoy) and couldn't take the mediocrity and dropped out.",1438214400,,845,4.680272108843537

We didn't watch much of the special features, although we agreed if they have a social studies project on any of the characters or time periods covered that these would be a great resource to use.  For this reason amongst many others I am glad to have it on the shelf instead of downloading or renting.

There is one episode where the topic of marital fidelity comes upit's Hollywood so the right ending happens (wish I could say the same for real life) but it also prompted good discussion.

Volume One is the young childhood adventures. It's not my favorite of the set, because I always wanted to be teen Indy. However, it gives some of the best insights into Indiana Jones. For me, my favorite of these episodes would have to be the one in Italy. It's a moral play on feeling needed and the possibility of adultury. I had a wonderful talk with my kids about honor, love, and marriage because of that episode. Great filmwork, Great picture, Great acting. In short, I laughed and I cried.

2936601,4,B000VDDDVE,"I only saw a few episodes (loaded with commercials)of the young Indy series when it was originally broadcast on TV and I have to confess that I was not a fan of Sean Patrick Flannery.  While he bears a striking resemblance to a younger Harrison Ford, he seemed to lack Ford's adventure dynamic....However, Flannery DOES look more academic and is more plausible as a wannabe archaelogist.  Ford, on the other hand, had more of the bounty hunter of Star Wars in his veins than the knowledge of the Fall of the Roman Empire.  However, I really warmed up to Flannery in Vol. 1.

I recently purchased all 3 sets from Amazon and have worked my way through Vols. 1 and 2 including all of the excellent documentaries and I have to give George Lucas, Flannery, and young Corey Carrier full marks for this series of movies. Both Carrier and Flannery were rookie actors and you can see as the episodes move on that they get better at their roles.  What I really like about Flannery is that he portrays an avid listener and an acceptance of the world as it presents itself; and underneath, you sense he is genuinely a nice guy.  He doesn't try to add Bogart angst and looks in place in the early 20th century settings.  Carrier is amazing.  Again, a kid you know is a genuine nice kid and shows all the wonder of learning you would expect from a young person with budding academic interest.  The main support actors are excellent too.  Margaret Tyzack as Miss Seymour develops real affection for young Indy and is a pleasure to watch and Lloyd Owen, too, has remarkable resemblance to Indy's father....his role as an Edwardian father is played to perfection.  Ruth de Sosa was, however, the biggest surprise.  Although she is not as prominent as the other two in many of the episodes, she exudes warmth and elegance and gives a fine performance as a woman swept off her feet by the notorious phlianderer, Giacomo Puccini.  We are also introduced to Remy Couterre, who figures heavily in Vol. 2....he is a perfect counterpoint to young Indy.

As far as the extremely unlikely possibility that Indy would meet (to name a few): Lawrence of Arabia, Degas, Picasso, Tolstoy, Sean O'Casey, Teddy Roosevelt, George Patton and Pancho Villa, ...well it is the vehicle created as the ""rason d'etre"" of each new story and we have to be content with that.  But, each new adventure begins ingeniously....There is a lot of humour, adventure, love, spills, and what sets and locations George Lucas takes us to.....It is a visual delight and I have to say I found each episode very compelling to watch.

Which leads me to my final, and most important, point.  Along with the movie episodes are about 30 or so 25min. documentaries.  These were a pleasant surprise for two reasons:  first, they were excellent and secondly, many were on people or topics in history that we never see in documentaries.  For example, the 2 documentaries on the Suffragette movements in Britain and the US were excellent.  I had no idea the suffragette movement in the US was based on a constitutional issue and closely related to emancipation.  There was one very illuminating documentary on Edward Statlemeyer, the author who created The Hardy Boys, Tom Swift, and Nancy Drew.  And a great little documentary on the ""Theophists"" and Krishnamurti.  These are not household names.  Each of these complements the characters or a movement in a particular movie.

The 3 best movies concern Indy (Flannery) falling into Pancho Villa's hands and his junket with a cantankerous junket with Tolstoy (played by the great British actor, Michael Gough).  For young Corey Carrier, my favourite episode is with T.E.Lawrence and a dig in Egypt.  I have to add the 2 episodes where Ruth de Sosa shines (Puccini and China)as well.  Obviously some historical background was thoroughly studied in these episodes and some perceptive historical wit given to us:  The best lines come from a Mexican peasant when Indy asks why he is unhappy about Pancho Villa's efforts at ""liberating him"".  The peasant proceeds to say that the common denominator among Emperor Maxmilian, Benito Jaurez, Villa, and few others is......""They were all going to free me but .....they all stole my chickens.""

2936603,1,B000VDDDVE,"I never saw the original series.  But i purchased all three volumes hoping I would have the pleasure of savoring them over the course of time.  Yet the very first episode seemed to end abruptly and unsatisfactorily, with T.E. Lawrence at the bottom of a slope of sand with the villain in his grasp and lamely declares that the jackal headpiece, the heart of the mystery was not in the villain 's possession.  The next thing you know is that an older Indiana is boarding a passenger ship headed for Morocco.  No conclusion, no justice, no story, and 45 minutes of my life is gone with no reward for spending it--the vanity of trying to find a mere break from the stresses in my life is fully brought home to me.
  How could they do this? And i don't even have the option of returning it for my money back!  Now i come to find the have been abridged and butchered, these episodes, and all the really entertaining parts have been striped away.  Yes, I know they were meant to have an educational aspect, but this, I think, was hardly Lucas' intent.  And, i might never purchase another Paramount product again.
  I hated this one butchered episode so much I couldn't waste my time watching more than a few dozen minutes of the next spliced onto it that dealt with the painful subject of child slavery.  This is hardly likely to have a satisfactory, or even poignant ending either, since they butchered the first, why not the second?  I turned it off.

2936608,5,B000VDDDVE,"What a fun series!  This show gives ""Indy"" fans a glimpse into the childhood that created the adventure hero we love in the movies.  The first season follows young Henry Jones Jr. as he, his parents, and his tutor, Miss Seymour, travel across the world.  Each episode takes place in a different country and usually features a historical figure such as Pablo Picasso, Emmeline Pankhurst, or Theodore Roosevelt.

Wonderful cinematography makes this show eye-candy, and the audience can enjoy some cultural exposure in each location.  I would especially recommend it for history buffs, like me.
For the most part, it is an excellent show, but there are times when the screenplay or actors leave something to be desired.  Occasionally, words like ""corny"" or ""melodramatic"" come to mind, but, hey, didn't the movies have their corny moments too?

I would recommend ""The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones"" for teenagers/adults.  While most of it is fine for younger viewers, there are several episodes with more mature themes, especially once Indy reaches his young adult years.",1359504000,2,1072,5.15606936416185

2936613,1,B000VDDDVE,"Seriously, what is wrong with the man? Can't he leave well enough alone?
These episodes simply do not work as TV movies and it was ridiculous to try and edit them that way. Perhaps if the episodes had all been aired as a part one and part two, and he simply merged the two parts together to join the two halfs of the same story, that would be fine, but the episodes he joined had nothing in common with each other.
And where is Old Indy? To me, that was a vital part of the story telling process - the lead in to why Indy felt this particular story he was about to tell was an important part of his life.

Of course, my fond memories of this series could be less than reliable as well, for I found those episodes I did watch to be much more boring than I remembered them - and I cannot be entirely certain that the removal of Old Indy and the awful transition from episodes to movies is to blame (but they certainly did not help).

Of course, there will not be a way for me to tell because:
1. GL probably burned the old footage as he seems to hate everything he has done that is still in its original form (I wonder when we will be getting ""Indiana Jones and the Big Gold Box Of Undetermined Origin"" that will be billed as how ""Raiders"" was always meant to be) and

2936617,4,B000VDDDVE,"let me start off by saying I never saw the show during the original run but I really enjoy the show. Not only are the two actors who play young Indy good but the writing, production value, and storytelling are better than most shows. Cory Carrier holds his own during the first five episodes but by the fifth episode i started to tire of him, luckily by the next episode Indy has grown into the sixteen year old version played incredibly well by Sean Patrick Flanery. this episode is called Spring break Adventure and is the best episode in the first set. by the end of the first volume Indiana makes a decision that will affect how he will become the action hero he is today unfortunately the consequent effects of that decision are not shown until the next volume. the good news is that this set is extremely entertaining as well as educational. the historical figures Young indy meets are handled well and the educational documentaries are very informative and are well worth the price of the set.  As a huge indiana jones fan I recommend this set but the truth is the show only really hits it's stride in volume two. Indiana jones is the only character I have seen in the visual medium where you get to follow his adventures from his birth to his old age.",1311724800,4,1259,4.473913043478261

I never saw the originals.  In fact I was unaware that they even existed until after the show was canceled.  So I suppose my perspective is different.

I'm a dad and my son is almost 8.  We've been slowly working our way through these for months now.  The stories are charming, fun, and sometimes genuinely touching.  Our routine is that we watch an ""episode"" which is actually two episodes back to back in a movie-ish format.  Sometimes we do it in two sittings.  Then we work our way through all the documentaries before we move on to the next.  The documentaries are first rate and terribly interesting.  Using this as a springboard we have had great discussions about art, history, science, philosophy, religion, literature, war, politics, and love.  This is some of the finest educational TV I have ever come across.  It uses the Indian Jones mystique and excitement as a springboard for a great general course in the humanities with an emphasis on the early 20th century.  I'm well educated and I can't believe how much I have learned!  I enthusiastically recommend these DVDs for families everywhere.  (Though I would skip the episode about Mata Hari if you have young kids, and the WWI episodes and documentaries can be pretty rough but those are in the second set)",1310688000,5,1429,4.7673469387755105
2936619,4,B000VDDDVE,"This series is nowhere near as exciting as the movies, however, they do add some interesting chapters into the life of the character. There is definitely a Forrest Gump kind of feel to the way Indy experiences (and influences) moments in history and meets historical figures. It helps explain why Indy is such a worldly person, with a respect for all cultures, languages, and ethnic groups. One of the great things about Indiana Jones is that he is not only an action hero, but he is also very intelligent. This series attempts to explain how Indy became the kind of dramatic hero he is in the movies. You can't argue about the locales George Lucas chooses for the settings in this series, which were primarily shot on-location. It can be a bit dull at times, with more history lessons than Indy being Indy, but if you are a fan of Indiana Jones, this is the first of a series that you will enjoy...",1308700800,,899,4.521472392638037

The writing was decent, but the most jarring thing was the lack of focus.  Backgrounds and many of the shots were out of focus, especially noticeable when they shifted from one camera to another.

It's the defective logic of the show's creator! George has once again, as with his re-imagining of the original Star Wars trilogy in the late 1990s, insulted his fans by cutting, splicing and throwing continuity out the window. HE HAD TO KNOW that the fans wanted these shows uncut, as originally broadcast. But because of his own vain obsessive compulsions and his never-ending lust for his fans' hard earned bucks, he's decided to release this monstrosity. Of course, when he sees the sales peak and then decline for these, he'll put out an expensive dvd set of the original episodes. I REALLY hate to say it but I've come to believe that George Lucas is a money-grubbing, anal retentive hack. Is this what the accumulation of great wealth does to the creative genius? Michael Jackson. Tom Cruise. Marlon Brando. George Lucas.

2936629,3,B000VDDDVE,"Whether you will think this set an astoundingly good value for money and time spent depends on no small degree to how much of a fan you are of the whole Indiana Jones concept, how much you liked the original broadcast incarnation, and how much you are into The History Channel documentary features. There are a number of aspects to consider, in purchasing this set and the subsequent two volumes - first, that no expense was spared in production, and it all shows. The series was shot on location, around the world, and if nothing else redeems ones faith in the ability of an American television series to ""do"" another era than the present with absolute fidelity to detail. This set presents the series events in chronological order - unlike the original series as broadcast, which hopped from adventure to adventure, from one year to a decade later with no particular logic. I rather prefer the straight chronological sequence but your mileage may vary. What will probably dismay fans of the series is that the framing device and poignant character of ""Old Indy"" is entirely absent, and that each episode in this set is actually a pair of episodes roughly cobbled together. Sometimes there is a bit of a theme or location in common, and sometimes not; which  results in jarring shifts of place and story at about the mid-point of each, as the schoolboy-aged Indiana Jones travels with his renowned professor father around the world at the very dawn of the 20th century. Of course, he meets up with fascinating and important people, every step of the way with a frequency which defies logic - but this is a television show! It is supposed to be entertaining, imagining the circumstances under in which a bright eight-year old boy can manage to meet everyone from Sigmund Freud to Norman Rockwell and take away some interesting lesson or insight.

The extras, which take up nearly half the 12 disc set are more extensive than practically any other TV series set which I have reviewed and consist mostly short documentaries about the events and people encountered in the various episodes. If one is a History Channel addict, this is almost like getting two sets in one. A straight-up fan of the series may consider the documentaries, the interactive time line and game a little more gilding of the lily than is strictly necessary. But this series will be a godsend to parents attempting to painlessly interest children in historical events and interesting people - and anyway, Indiana Jones is a little more appealing  to kids and a lot little easier going than ""Lanny Budd""",1237593600,3,2572,4.8144796380090495

2936636,2,B000VDDDVE,"I think what we have here is VHS versions.  Not the TV episodes.

Heres a copy from wikipedia of what I found.

[edit] Home video re-edits
The revised and updated edition of the book George Lucas The Creative Impulse, by Charles Champlin, explains how The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles series would be re-edited into the new structure of twenty-two Chapter TV films, for the 1999 VHS release. New footage was shot in 1996 to be incorporated with the newly re-edited and re-titled ""chapters"" to better help it chronologically and provide smooth transitions. The newly shot Tangiers, 1908 was joined with Egypt, 1908 from the Curse of the Jackal to form My First Adventure, and Morocco, 1917 was joined with Northern Italy, 1918 (now re-dated as 1917) to form Tales of Innocence. Also included in the home video release were four unaired episodes made for the ABC network, Florence, May 1908, Prague, 1917, Transylvania, 1918, and Palestine, 1917.

The 93-year-old Indy bookends for the original series were removed, as well as Sean Patrick Flanery's bookend for Travels With Father. However, the Harrison Ford bookend, set in '50s, from The Mystery of The Blues was not cut.[5]

However George Lucas needs to start putting version numbers on his films so we can tell them apart.

I feel that this is a inferior version of this series. I will not buy any more of the volumes until they release the TV versions.

On top of that I hate Paramount DVD cases.  I have to remove a disk to get to another. That really bites, and causes accidental scratches.  Some of the Star Trek movies have theses cases.
Paramount when will you ever learn.

I would not mind paying the high prices if this set contained the TV versions.",1210291200,14,1720,4.780405405405405

I have thoroughly enjoyed both the shows and the accompanying historical documentaries, and all parts, including the extras, have been subtitled. Thanks Mr. Lucas!!",1210204800,5,420,4.6891891891891895
2936638,4,B000VDDDVE,"Brother can you spare a week or two? That's about how long it's going to take you to get through this massive 12 disc boxed set, the first of three volumes showcasing the adventures of Young Indiana Jones. This show, originally broadcast on ABC from 1992 - 1993, and then later on the USA network, was one of the most ambitious television shows in history. Indiana Jones creator, George Lucas served as the series' Executive Producer and also wrote the bulk of the episodes. This was also one of the most expensive shows to produce as it was shot on location all around the world. The series is also one of the more complicated in terms of its chronology and production.

First, episodes featured two different Young Indy's...there was Corey Carrier who played the character at approximately nine or ten years old, and then Sean Patrick Flanery who played Indy in his older teens and early 20's. Complicating matters was that the show was not presented chronologically. One week may be the younger Indy and the next, the older Indy. Now here's where it really gets interesting...a number of hour long episodes were pieced together to make a feature length film such as Young Indiana Jones and the Curse of the Jackal in which the first half of the film feature Corey Carrier and the second half continues the story (Chronologically 8 years later) with the older Indy. HOWEVER, the DVD set is not piecing them together in the same way. The DVD set is presenting seven feature-length episode (two TV episodes) but doing it in more of a timeline/geographic order. (I told you it was complicated). They also renamed these episodes. Thus, the first Episode titled ""My First Adventure"" finds 9 year old Indy on the trail of a stolen Egyptian artifact but in the second half, he is now in Morocco being kidnapped by slavers and noticeably a bit older by a year or so.

Indy's father is played by George Hall who sounds remarkably like Sean Connery. Henry Sr. has been asked to speak all over the world and takes his wife and young son with him on his journeys. Thus begins a life of adventure and archaeology! Throughout the series, Young Indy would frequently meet famous historical figures. In the opening episode, he meets British officer T.E. Lawrence (Of Lawrence of Arabia fame) as well as archaeologist Howard Carter, still several years away from finding King Tut's tomb. The Second episode, ""Passion for Life"" pairs original episodes ""British East Africa"" and ""Paris"" into the full length feature as Indy first meets President Teddy Roosevelt for a safari in Africa, and then a youthful Norman Rockwell in Paris.

Once the emphasis shifts to the older, Sean Patrick Flanery Indy, the adventures and danger truly begin to ramp up as we can see the young man that will become the character of the feature Hollywood films and I was very impressed with Flanery's performance throughout the series. ""Spring Break Adventure"" features the teenaged Indy contending with German spies out to steal an invention of Thomas Edison, while the second half concludes the Curse of the Jackal storyline from the very first Young Indy episode in Egypt.

The DVD set features a whopping 38 historical documentaries that are pertinent to the episodes they are paired with. For example, the My First Adventure episode features a 30 minute documentary on Howard Carter and the discovery of King Tut's tomb. The ""Spring Break adventure presents documentaries on Thomas Edison, Pancho Villa, General John Pershing, and more. What's truly wonderful about this set is that these documentaries would be a great addition to a middle school or even high school history class making this boxed set entertaining and educational. The subjects on the documentaries run the gamut from history to culture to social issues and philosophy. In fact, The History Channel acquired television rights to all 94 (from all three volumes of the DVD historical documentaries. The airing of the documentaries is meant to bring in ratings for the history channel and serve as marketing for the DVD release and the theatrical release of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. The History Channel and History International began airing the series every Saturday morning at 7AM/8C on The History Channel, and every Sunday morning at 8AM ET/PT on History International.

2936646,5,B000VDDDVE,"I remember watching Young Indiana Jones on T.V. in the 1990s.  It was ground-breaking television; a gusty move by ABC.  But the network let it's affiliates preempt the show (my local ABC station did so often).  When the show moved into reruns on USA Network, the show suffered even more.

Lucas' idea for the show, to promote an interest in history, was a great idea.  And his vision for the show--to present the episodes and include short videos that would provide information and context to the historical events in the show--was radical.  Way before the History Channel and the Biography Channel, George Lucas wanted to enlighten and interest his viewers in the pageantry and sublime awe of the early 20th Century.

This first DVD set, along with the second and third volumes, is a tour-de-force of beautiful filmmaking, subtle special effects, and wonderful storytelling; it beautifully showcases George Lucas' vision.  FIlmed on location in a dozen countries, the episodes have a local ""flavor"" that gives a delightful flair.  It is fun to see who young Indy meets as he travels around the world. I only wish that the ""bookends"" from the original series could have been kept.  It would have been nice to see them weaved into the DVD editions.  The bookends gave a modern gateway into the stories, and in one episode, ""The Mystery of the Blues"" in the upcoming Third Volume, Harrison Ford is featured as the only time the classic Indiana Jones is shown outside the original trilogy.

The extra videos give context to the episodes.  They are rich and well done, giving the historical view of the characters Indy meets and the events he witnesses.  The early 20th Century was a watershed of events and transitions that reverberated through the rest of the century.  The ideas, politics and personalities from that time are tremendously influential even today, and the movements in the arts and politics changed our world.

There is more than a hint of Joseph Campbell through the life of Indiana Jones.  George Lucas cites Campbell's work as a big influence on his thinking, and there is a rich smattering of myth in the episodes of The Early Years.  Well worth the price, this volume, along with the subsequent volumes, are a great addition to your video library.  It is truly television worth your time.",1200182400,4,2307,4.869230769230769

2936659,4,B000VDDDVE,"I can see that a lot of folks are upset over the pricing and spacing out of the young Indy saga and it is undeniable that obtaining the complete young Indy saga on DVD is going to be a not inexpensive proposition.  That said, if you can afford it or are inclined to save your money to get it, I think this is an impressive endeavor.  I do wish they had given us the introductions with old Indy and the great main title music on the movies, and the really young Indy episodes, which occupy a good portion of Volume 1, are, for me the weakest episodes (he's a little too precocious--one wonders how he keeps getting away with his escapades, his parents aren't paying much attention, but I guess if he didn't there wouldn't be any stories to tell) but it's a good start to the tale and the interaction with the various historical figures is a lot of fun (including seeing some character actors whose faces stir your memory from other things you've seen--Major League and I, Claudius to mention a couple). The movies are certainly worth the time spent.

The really impressive parts for me are the extra features on the historical background.  Entertaining and a painless way to flesh out the stories and learn a bit at the same time, sometimes about things that are fairly obscure, sometimes about things that you are superficially aware of but have never known much detail about.

What the series did have though, was a sense of fun and adventure, and this won me over as the first season progressed.
Yes, it can be a bit earnest from time-to-time or annoyingly cute, but there were still the plenty of stunts and laughs to keep things going.
This first volume though is not the first season of the Chronicles, rather is the rebranded ""Adventures of Young Indiana Jones"", where disparate episodes (made a couple of years apart), though chronologically adjacent, have been pieced together to make a series of TV movies.
So, in the first story, we are greeted with the sight on 9 year-old Indy magically growing 12 inches, apparently within a week!

Basicly Lucasfilm has released the TV Movie edits in a roughly chronological order to show how Indiana Jones grew up , which on this volume creates major continuity blunders as the Age of Lead actor Corey Carrier will jump by two or three years in the space of one movie. then he magicly de-ages for the start of the next Movie in the set.
What is particularly insulting is the way in which the original pilot episode YOUNG INDIANA JONES AND THE CURSE OF THE JACKAL has lost its original second half  which creates a discordant jump in the edited version on this set which is now called MY FIRST ADVENTURE

in the original version the story revolves around the theft of an Jackal headpiece from an egyptian tomb which is first investigated by young Indiana as played by Corey Carrier and then resolved by Sean Patrick Flannerys 16 year old version of Indy. the original version was well balanced , gripping and was resolved in the space of one episode. in the botched up version on this set all the Sean Patrick Flannerry material is gone, replaced with a story about Child slavery (episode 41)which renders MY FIRST ADVENTURE as a hatchet job.

The set features 7 episodes (7 discs) and four episodes have a have their own disc of special features (4 discs), and there is an Interactive Bonus Disc to round out the set.  For three of the discs, the episode and special features are included together on the same disc.

The video looks as though it was remastered for DVD, so it is way better than any videotape.  The audio is Dolby Digital and sounds fine on my 5.1 surround system.

The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles exemplify the great potential of television to educate and entertain an audience.

I hope to have my kids watch these episodes when they begin studying history of the 20th century in school.  Kudos to George Lucas for producing this wonderful entertaining and educational series.

There are only two nits I can mention about this set.  I miss the ""Old Indy"" narration that was used when these were first televised.  I still have a handful of episodes I taped when they were first broadcast, and they had the nice narration by an elderly Indiana Jones as he reminisces about his early adventures.

2936673,4,B000VDDDVE,"Alas, like so many, I yearned for this release from the days of chasing it all over ABC's peek-a-boo scheduling, and too sighed in frustration at the massively bloated sets we have been presented with.  However, one has to have some perspective with Lucas' original goal for this series - to present something which can be used as a teaching aide.
  From the beginning, back in the early 90's being interviewed on Entertainment Tonight, et al, the educational aspect was important.  He hoped young people would look at these famous people, usually shown in this series before they're actually famous, and not only learn about their worldviews, but to also realise these people weren't far different from themselves.  Lucas remained true to his vision.
  In fact, I know a teacher whom has used this series, on VHS, in just this way with his classes.  Now, however, Lucas goes one further and gives documentaries on the discs to accompany the stories - now, if a kid's interest is piqued by an episode, he can immediately find out more, wonderfully fulfilling Lucas' goal for the series even better.
  Yes, it is a bit annoying to have to subsidize, essentially, Lucas creating a new documentary unit at Lucasfilm, using this series as a springboard.  Yet, the goals are noble.
  Meanwhile, one cannot complain too much of this set, regardless - seven films, essentially, for these were indeed filmed, on location, around the world.  A little over $11 a film, yet these have been remastered - they never looked this good on VHS, and certainly not on broadcast television.  The price is more in-line with what one would pay for a BBC series (Doctor Who sets are five or six discs and cost $60-70.)
  The only disappointment, to me, are the shoe-horned way they tried to connect the episodes without Old Indy.  Unfortunately, they got the idea at the time the originals aired that Old Indy wasn't favored by the audience. Hopefully they'll include his segments on the third set somewhere as extras, but I doubt it. The problem is, the newer scenes attempt to force a now taller, older Corey Carrier to play his former self - it doesn't work.  At all.  Particularly watch for how he has to awkwardly place his legs, knees wildly askew, to sit lower with respect to Mr. and Mrs. Jones - quite comically bad, actually, and makes one feel the loss of Old Indy even more.
  One reviewer complained of linking Ireland and London, ruining Indy's ""first romance"" - however, London was NEVER Indy's ""first romance"" - first adult love, but hardly his first romance.  The show ALWAYS had that timeline. Besides, he was happy dating Nancy Stratemeyer in Princton, 1916; And never forget Sophie, his first boyhood crush.  His scene with Freud, Jung and Adler is one of the classic moments of the Corey Carrier episodes.
  The documentaries are top-notch - I've watched them all already, and they're exceptional, kept simple enough for kids but never watered down to the point of being patronizing, and retaining interest for adults as well.  They're filled with interesting tidbits beyond what one would find in a normal documentary on a person, and include input from some very interesting people (Dean Kamen was particularly enjoyable.)  They're kept short enough for classroom presentation (usually 20-30 minutes, perfect for a 45 minute class with time for discussion), and make it easier to digest the sheer volume of these things included on the set.  Anyone who loves Young Indy, and loves history, should have absolutely NO complaints about this set.  For the rest, your mileage may vary.
  In the end, the episodes are the best part of this - the remastering they've done is stellar, helped, no doubt, by the fact this series was filmed, rather than shot on video (making it easier to remaster to a higher resolution format.)  The images are particularly pristine, and the color saturation excellent.
  Yes, an investment.  I believe it is worth it.  If you don't, as someone said, buy a used copy.  People are already selling them used for under $60.",1194220800,7,4044,4.84963503649635
2936674,4,B000VDDDVE,"For the most part I'm very happy with this DVD collection after waiting years for it. If you read the recent interviews with George Lucas, he's emphasized the educational aspect of the show as well as the extras on the DVDs...and that's what had originally hooked me on the show when it  aired in the '90s. The show was a springboard for me to learn more about early 20th century history on my own, and the documentaries included on the DVDs would have been much appreciated by me 15 years ago! (And they're appreciated by me now anyway.) As a supplemental learning tool for a jr. high or high school classroom, they work.

For those of us who remember the show in its original incarnation, the subtraction of the Old Indy ""bookends"" from each episode leave something to be desired on these DVD versions. The beginning of the Princeton 1916 episode, for example, has a good solid minute of random scenes from around town with the background score playing, which doesn't make much sense without Old Indy's narration. I'm glad I still have some of the televised episodes on tape.

My only other comment is that I'm sure even the discounted price of $80 is a stretch for a lot of people, especially considering there are still two more volumes to be released!

I'll most likely buy Vol. 2 and 3, but I will definitely look for the lowest price available.",1193961600,9,1351,4.593360995850622
2936675,3,B000VDDDVE,"This is sad, no George Hall, no intro and outros for the episodes' music. All this editing has diluted the integrity of the original broadcasts. If they changed the ending of the feature length version of Travels With Father (aired on FAM in 1998) that means the whole blow-up between Indy and his dad that closes the episode is gone. Indy returns from his travels and his dad totally gives him the cold shoulder.
I hate to say this but I think the bootleg DVDs circulating on the net are a better choice for collectors. They are the original airings. That's sad that the official release is not the original single 45 min episodes.

I'm glad I already have the official VHS tapes sold back in the late 90s.
I guess I'll put my money toward Heroes and Jericho instead.

2936676,4,B000VDDDVE,"I'm glad this series has finally come out in DVD, but there are issues with this set.  As other reviewers have mentioned the ""old Indy"" who bookended the series and provided perspective is not included.  Another issue of mine are the special features which remind me of educational films of my grade school days (boring!), these could have been done much better.  However, all in all I do enjoy the adventure set against historical background.",1193702400,8,443,4.88
2936677,4,B000VDDDVE,"Finally!!!  After years of anxious anticipation I am now enjoying every element of Young Indy's adventures including the convenient and well-done historical background included as extra features.  I anxiously go strait to the history at the conclusion of each film to round-out the adventure.  Lucas really did a service by combining the history with the adventure making this an effective learning tool...if you want it to be.  This compilation would be a 5-star rating if not for two goofs; namely there are no chapter separations; and, the ""old Indy"" is missing.  Without chapters, these behave too much like low-tech VHS tapes where you need to fast-forward to get to a particular scene.  It can take a while too since each film is two episodes combined (perhaps another poor  choice).  I also miss the very old Indy that appeared in the initial airing (even though he was overly wrinkled).  Here Lucas edited out the grandfatherly life lesson imparted to the viewer.  Overall, very entertaining and a great way to get some good history.  Well worth the money if you can get it on sale.",1193443200,6,1090,4.901639344262295
2936678,3,B000VDDDVE,"David Brin here, offering a little perspective on the Young Indie Series, which I loved and have long wanted to see released on DVD.

 First a bias alert.  I am co-author of a book about the Lucas universe -- STAR WARS ON TRIAL, which is a fun, rollicking give and take among two dozen authors and critics, either ""prosecuting"" or ""defending"" the SW eipc from a variety of charges.  It got a lot of folks steamed! (And interested in fresh ways of looking at things.)

 In STAR WARS ON TRIAL I pointed out what seems to have been a profound REVERSAL in attitudes, in the part of George Lucas, between the era when he produced the first SW series -- along with the Young Indie shows --  and his later attitudes, manifest so blatantly (and awfully) in the sequels/prequels (Phantom Menace etc.)  Earlier, he seemed interested in civilization as a process that invloves BOTH exceptional people AND a gradually improving, elevating populace.  Especially in the YIJC, he took pleasure in introducing the viewer to ""heroes"" of a much wider variety than simply cliched ""action-chosen-ones.""  Heroes who might be helping to make things better in diverse ways, like promoting democracy, uncovering truth, teaching or healing the poor... and so on.  Indeed, the subtext of YIJC struck me (at least) as being kind of a love song to civilization (one that has been VERY good to George Lucas!) and a tribute to the can-do spirit, as well as prevailing over dark froces that seemed eager to bring that civilization down.

What a far cry -- indeed, direct opposite! -- from lessons preached in Lucas's second Star Wars Trilogy.  In which a deeply stupid civilization does nothing right, CANNOT even be asked to do anything right, must rely upon one group of supersecret patronizing chosen-one ""super"" beings to protect it against another bunch of supersecret patronizing villains, with everything hanging on one genetic/mutant chosen-one.  In an infamous NY Times interview, Lucas even spoke aloud of his contempt for democracy and belief that the best form of government is a ""benign dictatorship.""

GET the Young Indiana Jones Series... in BOTH old copies of the original episodes AND this highly-edited ""movie'd"" version.  Pay the money - if you can afford it - out of interest in this macro level, as well as the stories themselves. (And if you paid that much for the new DVD, you can certainly buy the old tapes with a clear conscience!)  DO your own detective work.  See if you agree that something happened, at some point, to transform a guy who once loved civilization (and us), turning him instead into just another grouchy bzillionaire.  I guess it happens.  But we ought to notice.  And be sad.  And mourn the (long ago) passing of someone who seemed on his way to becoming a great American storytelling mind.

2936679,3,B000VDDDVE,"I was ecstatic to hear that Young Indiana Jones was coming out on DVD and I love the stories. Having received the first volume and watched the first couple of discs I'm still happy it's here but there are a few basic problems that I hope get corrected in future releases.

No chapter selection option - how basic can you get? Just about every professionally cut DVD I know includes a chapter selection.

Why 12 discs? Another reviewer mentioned they'd like to see a collection of just the episodes on 7 discs. All the episodes and all the extra documentaries could fit on 7 discs with room to spare.

Why 'feature film' format? The way the plot, characters, theme, and locations change in the middle of the 'films' make it obvious these were TV episodes, not films. Sticking episodes together and calling them 'films' do not improve things (and the lack of a chapter selection option makes it awkward to watch half of a film at a time, if that's what you want to do).

On the plus side I do like having documentaries about the time era accompanying the shows and the shows are great. It just seems the DVD release needed a bit more thought put into it (which is strange considering how long they had to think about it).",1193443200,17,1219,4.4774774774774775
2936680,1,B000VDDDVE,"I have been looking forward to this release since it was announced, and have all the episodes on vhs.  I purchased the set, got home and realized that Mr. Lucas has done it again.  These are not the episodes as originally broadcast, but rather edited together into ""movies"" with the Old Indy bookends completely excised.  They are not even present as extras.  The episode ""London 1916"" suffers tremendously from its treatment on this dvd; Old Indy meeting his lost first love years later (played by Jane Wyatt - gone from this release) always brought a tear to my eye.  It's also edited behind another episode of Indy having a romance in Ireland, thereby completely diminishing the impact of Indy's first romance.  ""Travels with Father"" has also had its bookend removed, replaced with a deleted scene which provides us a perfect example of why some scenes are better left deleted.
Instead of purchasing the next two sets, I think I'll save my money and purchase a vhs/dvd recorder.  That way, at least I can have the original episodes on dvd.  If you don't care about this aspect of the release, knock yourself out.  As for me, I feel completely ripped off.",1193356800,140,1157,4.745
2936681,1,B000VDDDVE,You can see how the Lucas Empire Strikes Back at the fans that made it.  Release a DVD set at a pace to publicise the new Indy Jones film AND maximize the sales profit of this old TV series by splitting it up and selling pieces of the set each a few months apart. I guess I'll wait for the price to come down and all parts are released. Then they'll bundle it with more extras(like Spielberg did with the Jurassic Park trilogy). Can these sales marketers at Lucasfilm and Paramount get any more greedy?,1193356800,15,502,4.28421052631579
2936682,4,B000VDDDVE,"George Lucus offers a great product, but it is too much for some of us.  I do not want all of the extras.  Maybe some of them would have been a compromise.  They are way too much.

If Lucas did more research then he would have released the series in an edition that is the episodes and a few extras.  Later he would have planned an expanded version with all of the extras.

Hopefully, in the future Lucus makes available the shorter version, then  I would definately buy it.  For now I may rent some of the episodes.",1193270400,2,516,4.1938775510204085
2936683,3,B000VDDDVE,"I haven't watched these in over 15 years but I have every episode recorded on VHS.  Lucas has tinkered with these almost as badly as he did with the Star Wars Special Editions.  They are not at all as I had remembered.  Old Indy George Hall no longer bookends the series regaling us with tales of his cosmopolitan youth from the museum.  Now they are narrated by the kid Indy (who doesn't even sound like Corey Carrier) and the episode titles which I always thought were really exciting with Laurence Rosenthal's adventurous theme music have been sadly removed and the episodes re-edited into feature length installments like the tele-films that were aired on The Family Channel after ABC cancelled the series and the remaining unaired episodes were cobbled together and shown on cable.

Watching these again I am amazed I even used to watch this show.  Indy meets every famous and important person in twentieth century history.  Give me a break.  The odds of Indy meeting all of these significant historical figures throughout his life is so improbable that odds are he has a better chance of finding the Holy Grail, hmmm...  The stories come off mostly contrived and corny.  It just makes me realize that some things are better left to the imagination.  Watching Indy grow up into the Man With The Hat from Raiders feels like I'm watching little Annie and the Pod Race on Tatooine.  Oy veh.

I'll give Lucas credit for utilizing exotic locations around the world to deliver breathtaking cinematography courtesy of Director of Photography David Tattersall and attempting to deliver some kind of thinly disguised history lesson to young people.  The DVD has an exhausting supplement of documentaries and interactive learning modules which probably explains the ridiculous cost for these overpriced DVD sets (all 3 volumes will set you back somewhere in the ballpark of about $300). I should have skipped the first volume and waited for Vol. 2 to get to the World War I episodes with Sean Patrick Flanery and Ronny Coutteure as Remy which were the best and most dramatically memorable of the entire series.  I also remember Harrison Ford guest starring in the ""Mystery of the Blues"" which was pretty much a let down seeing a then 50-something bearded Harrison Ford being chased in a beat-up old '57 Ford pickup truck like he was reprising his role as Bob Falfa from American Graffiti and playing the blues on his saxophone.  It kind of spoils the mystery of the Man With The Hat when he makes his entrance in Raiders knowing too much about his past much like knowing every little detail about Boba Fett or Darth Vader's childhoods.  Lesson learned: Leave the past to the imagination.",1193270400,12,2682,4.8464912280701755
2936684,1,B000VDDDVE,"I have no complaints about this terrific series and the excellent job Lucasfilm has done with all the extra DVD content. I was counting the days until it arrived and I can't wait to watch them.

My complaint (and one star rating) is because of the cheapness of the outer packaging. It does NOT look like the image here on Amazon, which leads you to believe the inner sleeve is housed in a heavy duty box like the Indiana Jones movie box set, making it displayable. It is not. The inner sleeve is house in a VERY thin cardboard box that bows and looks nasty and cheap on the shelf. It's so thin and cheap, mine didn't survive shipping without bumps in all the corners.

Why should this matter if the content is great? Because it cost $130 with two more sets to go! That ain't cheap. You'd think we'd get a display quality item for that price and that's why I paid it. I will now need to seriously reconsider buying the future sets. Oh, I'm still looking forward to watching them, but that's why God invented Netflix.",1193184000,53,1015,4.365079365079365
2936685,5,B000VDDDVE,"A long-awaited first of three volumes of The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones finally arrives on DVD in a spectacular 12-disc set with more special features then you can crack a whip at. With the first seven feature-length episodes of the critically acclaimed show, this box set also contains a whopping 38 companion documentaries, historical overviews, and an interactive game and timeline.

Lucasfilm's documentary unit, headed by CBS news veteran David Schneider, created the 38 all-new companion featurettes specifically for this DVD release. With insights from scholars and historians, the documentaries perfectly complement all of the adventures of young Indy. Martin Scorsese, James Earl Jones, Colin Powell, Henry Kissinger, Gloria Steinem and many more offer their opinions and commentary to this definitive collection.

Shot in 35 countries and employing the talents of the industry's most distinguished filmmakers, the series won 11 Emmy Awards and 26 nominations during its two-year run. Sean Patrick Flanery stars as a teenage Indy, and Corey Carrier stars as the nine-year-old Jones. Guest stars include Christopher Lee, Vanessa Redgrave, Anne Heche, Elizabeth Hurley, Catherine Zeta Jones, Daniel Craig and more. Directors such as Joe Johnston (The Rocketeer), Nicholas Roeg (The Man Who Fell to Earth) and Mike Newell (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire) worked on the series, as well as writers Frank Darabont (The Shawshank Redemption) and Jon Hensleigh (Die Hard With a Vengeance).

Volume 2 was announced for a December 18th release and Volume 3 in Spring 2008. Paramount also mentioned that the complete series will be released shortly thereafter, which will be unfortunate for those who can't wait.

During Indy's extensive travels and high-stakes adventures, he meets many great historical figures and the screenwriters found a way to include much of the same adventure from the movies into the show, as well as to educate about such notable historical events.

""My First Adventure"" takes Indy into Egypt and around North Africa, aided by the legendary T.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia). ""Passion for Life"" sees Indy hanging out with Teddy Roosevelt and then Norman Rockwell, Pablo Picasso and Edgar Degas. In ""Perils of Cupid"" Indy falls for the daughter of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and must consult Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung.

""Travels With Father"" sees our favorite adventurer running away from home and traveling with the novelist Leo Tolstoy while ""Journey of Radiance"" finds Indy learning about faith with Jiddu Krishnamurti. In ""Spring Break Adventure"" young Jones and his girlfriend visit the Thomas Edison laboratory, and later he is swept up in the Mexican Revolution after being kidnapped by Pancho Villa. ""Loves Sweet Song"" finds Indy mixed up in several love affairs, ending in an explosive Zeppelin raid and dinner with Winston Churchill.

While most of these episodes contain quite a bit of educational elements, they make certain to entertain above all else. Nostalgic, historical and always exciting, The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones have long been demanded on DVD and now that wish has been granted.
