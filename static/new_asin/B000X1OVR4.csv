8226524,5,B000X1OVR4,Great intimate film of baboon life in the wild.  What is important to baboons is very interesting.,1409184000,,98,4.764705882352941
8226525,4,B000X1OVR4,"Upon getting to my African wildlife documentaries in the ongoing and almost completed process of upgrading my home video collection to modern medium, I found that, sadly, neither Stolen River nor Last Feast of the Crocodiles - two National Geographic classics -  are available on Region 1 DVD.  I did, however, still want a DVD representing Crocodile/Hippo territory, and found rave reviews of Valley of the Golden Baboon while websurfing.  Aware of the wildlife viewing reputation of the Luwanga Valley, and intrigued when I saw that it is the subject of this documentary, I ordered it.

It covers an astonishing number of species including Crocodiles, Hippos, Lions, Leopards, Impala, Elephants, Buffalo, Wildebeest - as well as two lesser-known species which I don't think I've ever seen on film before, Puku and Yellow-billed Storks - in it's 50 minutes.  In fact, I think only Etosha: Place of Dry Water (a/k/a African Wildlife) covers as many species in the same amount of time.

The stars, however, are a troop of Yellow Baboons.  Since we're fellow primates, it's perhaps they with whom we most identify, as they exhibit intelligent and alternately tender and brutal behavior.

As for the packaging, the description of ""Book & DVD Set"" is rather deceptive, as the ""book"" is more a booklet embedded in the back flap of the DVD packaging.  In other words, it will not affect your DVD storage.  The set also comes with a set of ""Endangered Species"" cards, presumably for younger viewers.

I would definitely recommend this as a representative documentary of Africa's river fauna.",1382832000,,1584,5.053846153846154
