7912606,1,B00000JMP5,"I find it misleading and unethical that nowhere on the box (which is in English only) does it indicate that this is a German film in German. Several other reviewers have maintained that this disc does offer English subtitles (again not mentioned on the box), but darned if I can access them. I have tried going to the menu, but when I do, all that happens is the film starts playing again without subtitles. Perhaps those whose remotes have a ""subtitle"" button can get them to play, but they are beyond the reach of my Panasonic DVD player (which was, when I bought it a couple of years ago, top-of-the-line). In addition, as others have noted, the print quality is poor, like a sloppy transfer of a VHS tape. The film itself might be interesting--Alma Mahler as a blonde sexkitten in lace teddy??? Paging Ken Russell!--but apparently one needs special equipment to find the hidden subtitles, without which the film is meaningless.",1205193600,,931,4.753086419753086
7912607,4,B00000JMP5,"If you are relatively new to Mahler and his music, this might be the best choice for you. It tells the story of Mahler's life and struggles, and includes many excellent pieces of his music. So, if you've just discovered, or want to discover Mahler, this is the place to start.

If you prefer to learn about Mahler the man, start with Ken Russell's ""Mahler."" It's a bit bizarre at times, but it will certainly teach you about the little Jewish boy who grew up to revolutionize the meaning and uses of music. You really get to know the man, and his beautiful, beloved wife, Alma.

There is another option too. You can opt for the metaphysical, and see ""What the Universe Tells Me."" This film includes the entire Third Symphony. Then, with beautiful photography of Nature's beauty, which inspired so much of Mahler's music. it goes a step further: it includes interviews and commentaries by philosophers, music historians, and even theologians, who remark on the almost supernatural intelligence which so many of us find in Mahler's music.

Choose your own starting point, but I hope you'll come to appreciate the man who provides an entirely different appreciation of music and life. I should also advise you that the film is in German, but you can choose English subtitles.  (Wanted to warn you about that in case you just can't stand subtitles.)",1139702400,5,1345,4.7844827586206895

7912609,3,B00000JMP5,"This Austrian documentary about Gustav Mahler tries a few new tricks. To  judge from some of the comments from other reviewers, they may be a bit  unsettling. I suspect, however, that some of the confusion may result from  poor disc interface design. English subtitles are available, but the  default is to play the disc in German without them. You have to request the  menu screen; otherwise it will play without subtitles.
In fact, much of  the film uses tried and true documentary techniques: an impersonal voice  relating events in Mahler's life over period photographs; shots of  locations, such as the Vienna Opera, where he worked; letters from the  composer read out loud, and so on. Even some of the deviations from  standard technique, such as costumed actors speaking as people from the  composer's life, are not that unusual. Peter Watkins's EDVARD MUNCH, for  example, shoots the painter's life as if Watkins were a documentary  filmmaker in 1880s Oslo. Even some PBS documentaries, such as their recent  series on the American Revolution, borrow this convention. (And when you  think about it, this is no more bizarre than interviews with historical  experts who speak as if, say, they were actually at the Battle of  Gettysburg, or who blithely impute motivations to people as if they somehow  had access to their historical subject's dead head. It's bad enough when  novelists pull this trick; historians should be a bit more  circumspect.)
The only aspects of the film that may seem a little unusual  are things like repeated images of train engines to signify changes in  Mahler's life, or the length of time given over to performing his music.  (Then again, this is a film about a composer, is it not?) Even here,  though, the film is far less radical than the work of, say, Hans-Jrgen  Syberberg, or Jean-Luc Godard.
So, does it provide us with a sense of the  composer's life and significance? Yes, at least as well as the average  documentary, and considerably better than the PBS series about Great  Composers. It is not as conventionally entertaining as a fictional biopic,  but it isn't trying to be. On the other hand, because it is a documentary,  and because its form is relatively open, it is able to provide a broader  context than a standard fiction feature. A good deal is devoted to how  Mahler's career was effected by Austrian anti-Semitism, for example. If the  film can be said to have a major fault, it lies in daring to mix forms  (documentary and drama), something that always makes people nervous. As far  as I am aware, however, no law has yet been passed against this, and I  don't see why filmmakers shouldn't explore this option if they  desire.",969148800,20,2690,4.845814977973569
7912610,2,B00000JMP5,"Sorry, I don't speak German very well, and there is no English subtitle available. I only comment on what I visually percepted.
All I saw was spots of Vienna you should go if you are on a Vienna music tour. Some  movements of Mahler's symphonies were even entirely played with the pace of  the film completely stopped.
Mahler himself is vaguely visible. The film  put too much focus on Natalie Bauer-Lechner and Anna von Mildenberg; and  unforgiveably ignored another two women whom Gustav also considered  important: Justi Mahler and Anna Mahler, not to say other musicians like  Richard Strauss, Hans von Burlow, Jean Silbelius or Bruno Walter. Mahler's  vision of music was also ignored.",952732800,6,690,5.0
7912611,2,B00000JMP5,"If you speak German, you may enjoy this. I don't so ... I don't know what else to say... nice pictures? Looks *very* stylized altho not quite as bizzarre as Ken Russell's piece of trash. Not sure if it's a documentary or cinema.",949881600,,228,4.325581395348837
