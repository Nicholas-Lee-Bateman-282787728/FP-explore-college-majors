5177472,5,B008OW3SU0,"This is the best season to date of the series, as the plot twists many times (with a lot more background on some of the characters). Spoilers ahead!
Here are the episodes:

27. The Night the Clown Cried - Released On Demand months before it was aired, this returns to Crystal Cove after the gang broke up. Fred is now a hobo, knocking on doors to find his parents, Shaggy is in military school, Scooby's at the farm, Velma's a spy (sorry for the spoiler) and Daphne's dating a parody on Taylor Lautner. A demented ""man-baby clown"" called Crybaby Clown drives around Crystal Cove in his buggy, chucking something like gas bombs all over. After a failed attempt on capture, the clown still roams Crystal Cove while Daphne won't join the gang. The mayor is replaced by a woman named Janet Nettles.

28. The House of the Nightmare Witch - In Russia, Baba Yaga (a Russian fairy tale witch)'s house attacks people, while Velma and Hot Dog Water are working together with Mr. E. The gang ruins their relationships, after which Hot Dog Water joins as a replacement for Daphne. They find another piece of the Planispheric disk.

29. The Night the Clown Cried II: Tears of Doom! - The gang finally catches Crybaby Clown (after The Night the Clown Cried), after which Daphne joins the team again.

30. Web of the Dreamweaver! - A multi-franchise monster haunts people's dreams, created by Sheriff Stone. This episode has some pretty cool concepts for this show, bending reality.

31. The Hodag of Horror - A hoax of a cryptid called the Hodag is being toured around Crystal Cove in a curiosity van, though the stuffed animal comes alive and haunts Crystal Cove. The fourth piece of the Planispheric disk is found, and Brad Chiles and Judy Reeves (Fred's biological parents) come to Crystal Cove with their dog, Nova.

32. Art of Darkness! - The gang visits a spoof on Andy Warhol, whose art freezes people, ultimately turning them into a piece of art. After, Angel Dynamite blows the whistle by beginning to tell Crystal Cove about the evil that haunts it.

33. The Gathering Gloom - A zombie interrupts Mayor Nettles' movie night, and after the gang uncovers it, Professor Pericles joins up with Mr. E.

34. Night on Haunted Mountain - A devilish creature haunts a desert mountain, which turns out to be more of a friend. When the gang drives away at the end, a conquistador appears (yes, a real ghost) and says, ""Nibiru"". The fifth piece of the disk is also found. More on that in the later episodes.

35. Grim Judgment - A pilgrim appears and stalks girls, turning his interest to Daphne. Fred's parents team up with Fred to catch the pilgrim, gaining Fred's trust. Daphne and Fred realize the sparks in their relationship, while Mayor Nettles and Sheriff Stone start dating.

36. Night Terrors - A mysterious library is being haunted by ghosts, with one resembling Anubis. The gang learns about other mystery solving groups, which are explored later.

37. The Midnight Zone - Angel Dynamite (now going by Cassidy Williams) is assaulted by a World War II robot for starting to reveal information about Crystal Cove, tracing back to a submarine.  Some of Warner Bros. characters have their first appearance in decades. Near the end, the gang discovers a ghost who warns them about Nibiru. Professor Pericles finds the last piece of the disk.

38. Scarebear - Probably my favorite episode from the set, a mutant bear attacks Crystal Cove citizens. Destroido is the main culprit, owned by Mr. E. Professor Pericles and Mr. E. join up with Brad and Judy to betray the original gang.

39. Wrath of the Krampus - A monster attacks kids, scaring them so much that their hair turns white. Almost all of the Mystery Incorporated villians make a cameo here. Velma discovers that Nibiru is a planet prophesied to collide with Earth in the near future, whose inhabitants are somewhat of Egyptian gods to humans. After this episode, the rest of the season develops more and more.",1348185600,13,3958,4.734011627906977
5177473,5,B008OW3SU0,"This DVD set is a must have for those of you like me who collect any incarnation of Scooby-Doo on DVD. The second season of Mystery Incorporated holds a much darker even more terrifying episodes then their previous season, weighing heavily on parodying various horror films, including The Shining and the Friday the 13th franchise. But all and all this DVD set is a vast improvement over the previous season release, with four DVD releases, three of them being single disc sets containing 4 episodes each and the fourth, being the best of the first season releases, containing the remaining fourteen episodes on a 2-disc set. This DVD release will contain the first half of the Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated season 2 episodes on a 2-disc DVD set. The list of episodes is below. This is a must have for ultimate Scooby-Doo fans.

5177489,4,B008OW3SU0,"If you judge this as a completely separate show from the old Scooby Doo, you might enjoy this. The animation has moments of greatness. Some episodes are quite creepy, with great horror movie references. The episodes are funny and sarcastic, with dark humor that is quite enjoyable and a running plot that keeps you interested. The villains occasionally have real, dangerous weapons. And, however dubious the plots are, they blend ""real"" monsters with fake monsters quite well.

If you approach this season hoping for the original Scooby Doo, you'll be disappointed. The side plots cut out some parts of the original cartoon that were so fun, like the chase scenes. The mysteries get solved, but unlike the original, you can't really follow along - in some episodes, especially in the first season, the clues point straight to the bad guy, in most of this season, there are no clues whatsoever. In the end, they sort of tell you what happened, but you'll rarely be able to guess.

However, if you take the show for what it is, and not what the original was, you'll probably like it!",1358553600,2,1081,4.775401069518717
5177490,5,B008OW3SU0,this movie has been great for keeping my kids attention in the true scooby doo style.  it is a great addition to any doo collections.,1357689600,,133,4.32
5177491,3,B008OW3SU0,What happened to the last 2 episodes? #14 The Heart of Evil and #15 Theater of the Doomed? Those 2 episodes complete the season. They are missing from the DVD. I am disappointed they were not included.,1356825600,,201,4.45945945945946
5177492,5,B008OW3SU0,My son really liked this one . Would tell my family and friends to get it. Had fun watching it together.,1356393600,,104,4.0
5177493,5,B008OW3SU0,I love this series intensely!  It's amazing.  I love the series long story arcs with the love triangles and mystery of the old Mystery Incorporated team.  I would love for this series to continue for a season three and beyond.,1356048000,,226,4.6
5177494,5,B008OW3SU0,"Well, my title pretty much sums this one up.  I loved Scooby as a kid, but it always seemed a little... dumb.

This series is everything I wanted that one to be, with an offbeat touch of soap opera and an ongoing mystery.  Bring on the new episodes, already (and hopefully the return of Cassidy Williams)!",1355961600,,305,4.410714285714286
5177495,5,B008OW3SU0,We bought this for our son who LOVES scooby doo (mystery inc. to be exact). I don't know how a 3 yr old knows the difference in one scooby doo and another but he does. He will love this Dvd set!,1355875200,,194,3.7560975609756095

5177498,5,B008OW3SU0,My grandsons are Scooby Doo fans from there earliest age. They have alot of these movies and this just added to their collection.,1354147200,,129,4.6521739130434785
5177499,4,B008OW3SU0,"I'm delighted that Warner Bros. Home Entertainment began releasing ""Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated"" in sets of two with 13 episodes versus four per volume. Many other fans of the Scooby Gang voiced their opinions on the matter and we got our wish. If Warner stuck to their original plans, we would already have another six volumes that take up way too much space in a home movie library. Consumers don't feel like they're getting their money's worth that way either.

Warner Bros. continues the trend by giving us the next thirteen episodes in the series with ""Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated Season Two, Part 1: Danger in the Deep."" I'm not sure why they didn't wait and add the last two episodes of the show to this collection, as it seems the fate of the series has yet to be decided. If they don't continue, are we going to be left with two unreleased episodes floating around? That wouldn't be cool at all.

All we can do for now is celebrate in the fact that we have theses chapters in the exciting and highly entertaining television show to watch anytime and anywhere we want. Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy, and Scooby-Doo continue to seek clues to the secret of the Planaspheric Discs. They get help from the clever-yet-quirky Hot Dog Water and the fearless Angel Dynamite. In their search for answers, they encounter separate mysteries that distract them from their real mission.

""Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated"" continues to be humorous and captivating in its second season. There's plenty to keep children happy on the surface while giving their parents something to snicker at with its ""over-their-head"" adult humor. It's a good balance for the most part. However, there are points where it starts to cross the line.

Devotees will be disappointed with the lack of special features included in this 2-Disc collection. There's no ""Making Of"" or ""Behind-the-Scenes"" featurette to be found. You'd think after two seasons Warner would drum up a simple 20 or 30-minute spot for the show. All that's here are some trailers and a couple of commercials.

Besides a lack of bonus material, ""Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated Season Two, Part 1: Danger in the Deep"" will thrill enthusiasts of the canine crime fighter and his crew. You can't beat 293 minutes of treacherous adventures and family friendly laughs. Hopefully, we'll get the second half of this season and the last two episodes of part one at some point in the future.",1353628800,,2436,4.946210268948655
5177500,5,B008OW3SU0,Scooby Doo is AWESOME!! I would recommend this product to Scooby Doo lovers across the globe!! What's not to like?!?!?,1353283200,,118,4.95
5177501,5,B008OW3SU0,"Scooby doo season one part two. Great value and a pretty neat update on the show.
However if you want the complete first seasons part 1 is split over three seperate discs at $10 a pop.
Not the way it should have been done.
However if I base my review on the second part only its value for money and a lot of fun.",1351814400,,312,3.890625
5177502,4,B008OW3SU0,"Well, season one of ""Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated"" may have ended on a low note with Scooby being sent to a farm, his best bud Shaggy in military school, and Fred desperately searching for his real family, but hopefully season two will get better, I hope.

The first 13 episodes of season two were recently aired on Cartoon Network, but if you missed any of them, fear not, for they're all on this brand-new 2-disc DVD set featuring new monsters and creatures terrorizing Crystal Cove including:

""The Night the Clown Cried"" - A new threat named Crybaby Clown is terrorizing the town, but the gang is not back together completely.  It seems Daphne has new boyfriend, which devastates Fred.

""The Night the Clown Cried II: Tears of Doom"" - In this follow-up, the gang finally catches Crybaby Clown the moment Daphne finally decides to rejoin the old team.

""Hodag of Horror"" - A creature called the Hodag haunts Crystal Cove, but what's this ?  Could Fred have finally found his true parents ?

""Grim Judgment"" - A perilous pilgrim starts abducting women, including fair Daphne.  It's up to Fred and his parents to rescue her.

""Scarebear"" - While a mutant bear is unleashed and rampaging the city, the members of the original Mystery Inc. team (that includes Fred's true parents) plot something suspicious.

""Wrath of the Krampus"" - Not only a lot of previously seen villains appear in this episode, but another new threat known as the Krampus scares the children of Crystal Cove.  But that's only the beginning.

Looks to me there's more and more drama developing in this Scooby-Doo series, so if you don't want to spoil it for others, just wait until the second half of the second season is out on TV and DVD hopefully soon.",1349481600,2,1729,4.745819397993311
