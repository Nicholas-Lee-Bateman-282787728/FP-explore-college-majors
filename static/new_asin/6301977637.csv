402438,5,6301977637,"This work, narrated by Gene Kelley, is devoted to the cinema musicals, starting with seldom seen footage of the silent era, and continuing with the fantastic dancing scenes of Busby Berkley.  Next we move on to the Fred Astaire period, which centers attention on the individual dancer.  We see beautiful performances from the likes of Ginger Rogers, Ruby Keeler as well as the incomparable Nicholas Brothers.  With the advent of color, comes a never previously seen number on the 'yellow brick road' with Judy Garland and Ray Bolger.  Not to forget a marvellous routine by Shirley Temple and Bojangles Robinson!  Alltogether, this is the most memorable series of dance sequences that I have ever seen in half a century.",1015113600,158,719,5.008403361344538
402439,4,6301977637,"This video has gotten some play recently on TMC, but in the wrong format.  It is so compressed on the screen that it is hard to appreaciate the great dancing.  I would recommend buying your own copy as these are all the  classic dances from the movies..from Cagney to Michael Jackson, you see  some really great performances!  I just watched it on TV and went right to  the net and ordered it. The precision of some of these dances and the  abilities of not just the stars, but the chorus dancers as well, left me in  awe.  You could run 27 takes with me dancing and still not come close to  what the worst of these dancers can do! I understand they are adding some  new footage of  the St. Cyril Theatre Guild's Grease dances to the original  video.

I love musicals and musical theater and the numbers selected for this film are some of the best of many forms of dance seen in the glorious old movies of the MGM.

There were too few of the great comic tap dances, and other important things got short shrift, but all in all it is nice to have a record of this not to be forgotten era.  My dance loving grandson, who jumps up and dances with 'singing in the rain' and 'make em laugh' sequences, was pretty bored by most of it.  Not for little kids & a bit too much of a historical treatise and not enough of a Dance Extravaganza that I was expecting.

402601,5,6301977637,"Dance is a major component of every culture on Earth.
From Texans line dancing in a honky-tonk club with sawdust on the floor to Balinese women gracefully telling stories with their bodies; dance connects us all whether we like it or not.
Hollywood knows that and - because the moguls who ran the studios back when cars were a block long and all stars were glamorous knew not only how to make a movie but also how to make a buck - it cranked out hundreds of films that existed almost solely to show the audience how well some people could dance.
Shirley Temple and Bo Jangles did famous dance numbers together, for example.
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers lit up the screen with their flawless - almost magical - routines and Gene Kelly was the embodiment of America: A force of nature who danced with power and precision and yet still managed to inject some whimsy into every number he performed.
'That's Dancing' captures many of the great cinematic dance performances of the past and adds a dash of what were then modern trends in dancing when it was produced nearly 30 years ago. The film is dated but I believe it is still a treat for those who enjoy dancing in its many forms: From tap to swing, from the combination of strength and grace that is ballet to the gritty, street-level style of break dancers this movie is a visual feast.
What makes this film even better is that it is narrated by some of the best dancers in the world.
Mikhail Baryshnikov, Ray Bolger and Kelly, for example, all have segments in the film.
When added to some special features that are available on this DVD their commentary makes this a must-have for those who love dancing.",1417219200,3,1659,4.514950166112957

Covering nearly a hundred years of American filmed dance history ending in 1985 (original release date), it often features lesser known routines and/or dancers who's names have been lost sight of over time. It is also interspersed with interviews and narration by Liza Minnelli and Mikhail Baryshnikov, the late great Ray Bolger, Sammy Davis Jr. and Gene Kelly, and an introduction by the latter and Jack Haley Jr.

Its sole flaw: a slight over-exposure of (executive producer) Kelly.

It is a useful starting point to explore free internet archives for dance and dancers - a tool which did not exist when this movie was made.

* remastered soundtrack
* Jack Haley Jr. and Gene Kelly Introduction
* 4 featurettes including Kim Carnes' Invitation to Dance video clip

There is also have a treasure chest of rare finds including a short clip of Isadora Duncan, a fantastic clip of Bojangles from his vaudeville days, Sammy Davis as a child, James Cagneys famous dance from Yankee Doodle Dandy and a wonderful tribute to Busby Berkley and the artistry he brought to the movies dance productions.

I agree that there are more dance routines that I would have loved to see.  I would have loved to see longer versions of many numbers, too.  It really deepened my desire to see so many more historic dance choreographies.  I am a dancer and a dance lover and learned so much. I feel the precision, dedication, artistry of so many dancers is so under appreciated and there is so much more to learn about dance.

Some reviews have not appreciated the break dancing or Travolta's disco in the movie.  They are a part of history and evolution of dance.  They are part of my definition of dance movement and expression especially to music.  The artistry of the golden era of movies, formal ballet and modern dance is more intricate, dramatic and stylized than many of the recent popular dances which are more homestyle not without as much formal training and little production and planning.  Today, the public does not avidly support dance, because of this, and there are few great productions, choreographers and large budgets are not available.  I believe that the young dancers of today need inspiration such as this DVD to inspire them to take what they know, work harder.  They need public support of the arts so that today's young dancers can become great and someday become inspirations for lovers of dance.

I am so happy that I purchased this.  I hope that I can find more dvds that are at or at least close to this standard",1341446400,3,2089,4.7292817679558015
402753,5,6301977637,"I don't know what took me so long in buying this film.  If you really like dancing your going to love this movie.  I love ""That's Entertainment"" series but this film is just about the dancing.  It doesn't get better than this and it's to bad we don't have the talent in Hollywood anymore.  Unfortunately the Broadway dancing is going by the way-side too and i worked on Broadway all my life.  It's sad that we don't have really talented dancers anymore.  I use to work at RCMH for years and even the Rockettes are not that great anymore.  Actually there are no real Rockettes left.  The standards have dropped terrible.  So enjoy this wonderful film of DANCE.  It's the end of an era.",1302739200,,684,4.443548387096774
402754,2,6301977637,"This is an all too typical production promising much more than it delivers.  Listing Sammy Davis, Jr, Gene Kelly and Lisa Minelli on the title description is technically correct BUT they are there to praise this disappointing DVD not to perform except very briefly.  What is really annoying is a several minute shot of Ray Bolger sitting in an empry theater telling us just how wonderful it was to watch Astair and Kelly perform their wonderous dual routine AND then NOT show it to us but instead cut to something completely irrelevant.  Lisa Minelle is only there to tell us how great Broadway Musicals were not to actually do anything!

It gets two stars insead of one only because there are some scenes that are entertaining but it is mostly a self congratulatory collection of the same superlatives repeated over and over for every scene.",1295568000,4,842,4.786206896551724

402757,4,6301977637,"The great Gene Kelly gets stuck with an embarrassing opening and closing script - the tape opens with a cloying reflection on human movement straight out of National Geographic; then he closes the tape with a tribute to street dancing. Wonder what this Hollywood-heydey icon really thought of break-dancing?

Thankfully, the script is pretty strong overall, and the segments are well-chosen and long - not just the hors-d'ouvres we always get. It's topheavy with movie classics of the 1930s and 1940s, but the dancing is phenomenal. Soundstage dancing became an artform unto itself.

I think a couple of segments from the Rock and Roll/Beach movie era would have been fine. Would have loved some Elvis Presley, Ann-Margret, Chuck Berry, James Brown, et. al. That's *my* dancin'!",1279238400,,778,5.166666666666667

402761,4,6301977637,"This pseudo documentary on dance was fun and gave me a lot of ideas for movies to put on my wishlist.  It even went clear back to silent films.  I did feel that many genres were missing or glanced over in favor of tap, such as jitterbug, Latin dancing, Russian dancing, Spanish dancing, disco, etc.  There were also a disproportionate number of dances by Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly.
While most of the costumes are in good taste, there is some immodesty, including a brief view of a woman's essentially bare backside.",1253404800,3,517,4.5978260869565215

402804,5,6301977637,"My interesting in dancing has always been as a spectator, not a dancer; we did however give our daughter dancing lessons from early childhood and she loved it. She loved it so much that she married a professional ballet dancer and now they own a successful dance school where they both teach.

As a fan of classical music since childhood I can recall the rapture I felt when I saw my first ballet; the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo was presenting the second act of Swan Lake. I was transported to a world of ethereal beauty that made a lasting impression on me. Since then I have been mostly a fan of classical ballet whereas my wife appreciates not only ballet, but also other more contemporary forms of dance.

I mention the above to help explain our enthusiasm for this DVD. It covers the world of dancing from ballet to break dancing and features a multitude of really remarkable dancing sequences from the stage and screen.

As a home theater enthusiast it pleases me that the sound has been remastered to Dolby Digital 5.1 surround and really immerses the listener in great sound.

The overall effect is an uplifting joyous experience in dance; it leaves you feeling better about things than when you started.

We also bought a copy for our daughter and her husband and as dance professionals, they have found it to be a delight as well.

If you enjoy watching dancing or have a family member who does, this DVD is a treasure and sure to please anyone who appreciates dancing.

I'm very glad we added it to our collection.",1216857600,7,1526,4.5677655677655675
402805,5,6301977637,"How enjoyable 1985 That's Dancing is!  And the special treat is that you get to see the complete dance performances.  You will see the beginning era of dance and several entertainers who comment, Gene Kelly, Baryshnikov, Ray Bolger, Liza Minelli and Sammy Davis Jr.

Genres of Dance
You will see some entertaining black and white performances from the earliest choreographer, Busby Berkeley,  and those beautiful, jovial dance numbers in Technicolor.  Included are some wonderful tap dancing performances from the legends of the dance, especially a Nicholas Brothers tapdance; it is exuberant.  Considered one of the best, a tap dance with Donald O'Connor and Gene Kelly.  Plenty of time is given to Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers from ""Gay Divorcee"" and ""Swingtime"", plus Astaire's various partners.  What is new to audiences is a scene that was cut from ""The Wizard of Oz"", a charming dance number with Ray Bolger.  Too bad that was cut because it was so refreshing.

Baryshnikov comments on early ballet clips, and archive footage of Nureyev.  From the colorful ""Red Shoes"" is Isadora Duncan.  And not to forget the dance from Broadway which includes James Cagney in ""Yankee Doodle Dandee""  and more.

The latter part of dancing features that amazing dance from Flashdance, where the actual dancer, Marine Jahan, danced for Jennifer Beals.  Michael Jackson's ""Beat It"" and John Travolta's ""Saturday Night Fever"" clips.

Special features - Yes...John Travolta was included as ONE of the GREATEST!????  Huh??

This extra includes info on selection process to include such astonishing performances, and how this search was conducted.  There was a grand photo of the remaining dance greats that took place, and yes, don't ask me how, but John Travolta was included among the greatest dancers in entertainment.  He was so honored, I think he was just wondering how he was ever to be included anyhow!

Enjoyable!!....Rizzo",1214784000,15,1919,5.185667752442996

402808,4,6301977637,"I am certainly glad I purchased this DVD. There is footage that is historic as well as artistic, such as Bojangles' routine and some of the ballet dancers. I would have liked it even more if they'd done longer segments of some of the dances, rather than snippets, and if they'd chosen a better segment for Michael Jackson, such as his show-stopping live performance with his moon walk; also, I wish they'd shown Sammy Davis Jr's amazing live performance of ""Mr Bojangles""--another show-stopper and awesome.

That being said, it is a superb compendium; I'm glad that it was created. It was quite an undertaking to sift through the vast array of recorded performances. The scope of the subject is so huge that there was no way they could cover everything, or please everyone. That they did such a great job is testimony to their dedication, skill, etc. I'm pleased that they included bits showing actors who weren't known for dancing; some were surprisingly good. I am especially thankful that it includes a segment showing Rudolph Nureyev leaping around the stage, leap after leap. My most treasured dance moment is/was watching him do so in a live performance, when he did seven fantastic leaps around the stage. It was the most beautiful and wonderful ballet moment I'd ever seen: power, grace, astounding height and width...

One final ""I wish they'd..."":  Many consider the folk dance in The Sound of Music, when the Captain cuts in while his son is dancing with Maria, one of the most romantic moments ever in any movie. Too bad it wasn't shown here.

I do recommend this DVD, and have no regrets about buying it.",1189728000,17,1617,4.78494623655914

Unfortunately, THAT'S DANCING mixes classic scenes with some embarrasing moments--Gene Kelly praising breakdancing in a lengthy sequence, for example.  On the plus side, it's wonderful to see not only Astaire and Kelly, but also Vera Zorina, Bill Robinson soloing, Eleanor Parker, etc.  But where oh where are longer sequences with Bobby Van, Ray McDonald, or even co-host Liza Minelli (of course, these are primarily MGM musicals, which disqualifies a number of entries)?

There are pleasurable momements from Vera Zorina, Michael Jackson, Cyd Charisse,  Ginger & Fred, Dick Powell and Busby Berkeley... Liza Minnelli MUST BE ON SOMETHING???????
