8521214,4,B007R5A1XC,"I found this for the really reasonable price of $30 at the Baseball Hall of Fame bookshop in Cooperstown, NY this past weekend (definitely MUCH less than some resellers on here sell it for), and I only got it because a) I'm a huge Cubs fan, and b) I wanted the Sandberg Game. That being said, the packaging said it ""included the radio calls""... I will go through this set game by game and tell you if it includes the radio calls.

--July 12, 1969: The Hall of Fame Showcase vs. the Philadelphia Phillies with Ernie Banks, Ron Santo, Billy Williams, and Ferguson Jenkins--
This one sounds fascinating for a Cubs fan who wants a peek into history (AND to see them play the Phillies, which is a really cool thing for me). That being said, it appears it has the original television call ONLY, but I will have to have my father (whom I inherited my love of the Cubbies from) verify if this is actually the TV call from WGN-TV in Chicago or not. But it does NOT have an alternate audio of the radio call.

--June 23, 1984: The Sandberg Game vs. the St. Louis Cardinals--
I bought this set for this game alone, and I had visions of being able to listen to the whole game with Harry Caray on radio (because WGN was preempted on this day because it was the Fox Saturday afternoon game that week)... but here too, it is ONLY the television audio, NO alternate audio of the radio call.

--September 28, 1998:The NL Wild Card Tiebreaker vs the San Francisco Giants--
This game, out of all four of these games, sounds wildly interesting, but here too, this does not have the alternate audio of the radio call.

--September 20, 2008: The NL Central Clincher vs. the St. Louis Cardinals--
This is the ONLY game out of the four of these that has any sort of alternate audio of the radio call.

I have no idea why that is, but I sincerely hope that Shout! Factory and MLB decide to take pity on us fans and rerelease all of these 'essential games' sets for each team and include the dang radio calls as alternate audio tracks! For any game from the 80s on in, there is literally NO excuse for advertising that this set includes radio calls plural when that CLEARLY isn't the case.",1500249600,2,2163,4.370646766169155

8521217,4,B007R5A1XC,"If you don't have the CUBS LEGENDS COLLECTION which is the best set of games ever,this ESSENTIAL GAMES OF THE CUBS is a good alternative. I would have put another game of the 68-72 era instead of the division clincher. The 1969 black and white broadcast deserves to be there and the RYNE SANDBERG game also. The other two are signifiant but not memorable games. A real CUBS fan  really needs the previous collection to see SUTCLIFFE,DAWSON and WOOD to name a few at their best.",1453680000,6,477,4.546511627906977
8521218,5,B007R5A1XC,Love this.  It was an anniversary gift from my husband and I couldn't have been happier.  It's a definite must have for Cub fans!!,1361145600,4,130,4.375
