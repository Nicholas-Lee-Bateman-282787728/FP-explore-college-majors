There was no ""Guest host"" on any episode until S2E14.

I'm somewhat disappointed that musical performances have been cut and even though I watched more for the sketches and probably will not miss those missing performances I'd rather have unedited episodes for historical accuracy.

Three of these episodes had cuts done for re-runs/syndication (1 skit for gory content, 1 skit for unlicensed use of material, 1 instance of a ""bare behind"").  There's no word yet on whether or not those cuts have been restored.

I'd still prefer full seasons but hopefully this will sell well enough to warrant further releases.",1368748800,90,3442,5.183783783783784
5733311,4,B00CPTUNY2,"Was hoping like many fans of the show to see it come to light in it's entirety but I suppose this will have to suffice. I do understand it's difficult when it comes to music clearance, just happy to see SHOUT! step up and get it out finally!

Many were speculating if the music performances would be cleared ever since the announcement that SHOUT! had aquired the rights to the show. Now we know.

SHOUT! did a great job on many sets including SCTV and I like the fact there's a studio out there that will put out what most won't even touch.

Here's hoping that they pick a great selection of skits but I'm sure there will be some good ones and fan favorites that will not make it.

Still glad to see at least some of the show out on a legit set. I guess this is good as it gets!

When Fridays first debuted it knocked out SNL as my favorite show on TV, but I still watched SNL regardless. Having no car back then staying home on the weekends was more fun with those two shows to entertain me.
Tried very hard never to miss Fridays no matter what was going on that evening. The summers were great too seeing the re-braodcasts of the show and watching them all over again. I could never get enough.

So this is definitely a release day purchase for me.
Would have given it 5 stars if it was released in it's entirety.",1368403200,19,1316,4.181818181818182

5733346,4,B00CPTUNY2,"This is a short and abbreviated collection of the best late night show from the '80's. Some of the episodes in this collection were shorter than others and only showed one or two songs from the musical guests. From what I remember, a lot of the musical guests did at least 3 or more songs per episode (KISS did 4 songs from ""The Elder"" album on one show and The Cars did 3 songs on their episode, instead of one) Also,some of the skits were left out of some of the episodes. I would like to see Shout! Factory release complete,uncut episodes, but between gathering music copyrights and Michael Richards' clause in the Fridays contract concerning rereleasing his performances, I'm crossing my fingers and hoping things will get worked out.

Michael Richards, Larry David, Maryedith Burrell, Bruce Mahler, Mark Blankfield, and Melanie Chartoff, to mention a few. This was a similar but sometimes raunchier show than Saturday Night Live. It is a 5 disc set from the original series from 1980 to 1982. If you have seen it, then you will want to relive those days. If you have not then you are in for a treat.

5733386,3,B00CPTUNY2,"THE BEST OF FRIDAYS:  This sex, drugs and rock & roll showcase managed to steal a bit of Saturday Night Live's thunder shortly after that show's first classic cast moved on to other things. Hosted by co-producer JACK BURNS (of BURNS & SHREIBER fame), FRIDAYS' off the wall guest stars included BILLY CRYSTAL, WILLIAM SHATNER and the always unpredictable ANDY KAUFMAN, not to mention a gamut of cutting edge rockers from GRAHAM PARKER and THE CLASH to DEVO and THE PLASMATICS. Among the series' breakout characters were DARROW IGUS' Rasta Gourmet NAT E. DREAD, MICHAEL (the future COSMO KRAMER) RICHARDS' hyperkinetic Battle Boy, MARK BLANKFIELD's DRUGS R US pharmacist, and impressionist JOHN ROARKE's quirky RONALD REAGON (star of FRIDAYS' incredible sixteen minute tour de farce THE RONNIE HORROR SHOW). As with the original NOT READY FOR PRIME TIE PLAYERS, the entire troupe deserves kudos for often managing to rise above the hit or miss material. Three decades after its 1980-82 run, sixteen pared down episodes are at last available to preserve FRIDAYS' ""TV That Time Forgot"" legacy.

The show was incredibly funny with some of the funniest young comedy actors in the business, most of whom went on to become comedy legends.  This show was the launching pad for Larry David and some folks from Seinfeld.  Fridays had top rock bands as musical guests.  Sadly, the show only had a four year run on ABC, but should have been on forever.  The only draw back to the DVD is that it isn't available on Blu-Ray, but since the show was taped in the early eighties, Blu-Ray probably wouldn't have improved the video quality.",1425513600,,670,4.558333333333334

Nice to see young Michal Richards & Larry David pre-Seinfeld.  The cast is very good & the sketches have more money behind them than SNL's often thrown together sets.  The musical guests are a who's who of early 80s rock/pop.  The political sketches really go for the throat.  Carter and esp. Reagan take a beating.  Way more daring than SNL was.  But the other sketches often fall flat.  Drug & sex jokes that get the studio audience whooping is the norm.  Or stuff that's just weird.  Good bits I liked were Richards' Battle Boy, the high Pharmacist, Woody Allen in Star Wars, David as a temp lawyer, 2 wrestlers in a bar, the Moral Majority Variety Hour, Valerie Harper battles a teddy bear, Richards playing Frank Zappa and of course the Andy Kaufman incident.

That being said there is a reason why Saturday Night has lasted many more years that Fridays - some of the skits on this program were simply not that funny and many times they dragged on way too long. There was way too much political humor constantly poking fun of probably one of our greatest presidents - President Regan. This DVD would have been better if they would have shown all of the music acts that  were featured on the program - this is one of the reasons I originally stayed up late to watch this show. Instead of focusing on a few episodes it would have been better to show the ""best"" of all of the skits during its three year run.

I really enjoyed listening to the cast and writers reminisce about the show and talk about the Andy Kaufman appearances.

This set includes great performances from the Cars, the Stray Cats, KISS, Devo, the Clash, Tom Petty, and others.  Bruce Mahler's ""Latin DJ"" sketches and Mark Blankfield's ""Ken The Monster"" sketches are so funny.  It was also fun to see Michael Richards and Melanie Chartoff, years before their other shows ""Seinfield"" and ""Parker Lewis Can't Lose.""  You will also get to see Rich Hall in several sketches, several years before he was a regular on ""Saturday Night Live,"" and Larry David before he started ""Seinfeld"" and ""Curb Your Enthusiasm.""

5733566,2,B00CPTUNY2,"And I mean all of it, not just ""Fridays"". It's easy to say that this is a poor man's ""Saturday Night Live"", and yes, at its best, ""Fridays"" wasn't much better than even the dreaded Jean Doumanian season of ""SNL"", but even if it was, sketch comedy is something that constantly evolves as the envelope is pushed, to the point where whatever passed as shocking and offensive 33 years ago is just tame now.  And if you didn't have any solid jokes underlying the shock value, your material simply isn't going to be regarded as funny decades later. This is why ""Fridays"" hasn't held up terribly well over the years. It's interesting as an artifact of its time, but anyone looking for classicly funny sketch comedy from the era would be best served by checking out ""SCTV"" (which is still funny in part because they DIDN'T rely on gross-out humor) or some of the better stuff from the original era of ""SNL"".  Even then, don't count on ""SNL"" being nearly as funny as you remember it.

Some of the highlights (both good and bad) here:

""Diner Of The Living Dead"", a sketch which got the show removed from six ABC affiliates in the Bible Belt because of its macabre premise - a restaurant with zombies feeding on human flesh.  Drinks available include blood, spinal fluid, and contaminated water (which is...somehow associated with dead people?). The big ""oh no they DIDN'T!"" moment in the sketch comes when one of the non-zombie customers (John Roarke) takes a big bite out of a human foot. Not really gross anymore, and not funny in the least.

""Battle Boy"", where the world got its first glimpse of Michael Richards, prompting people watching ""Seinfeld"" a decade later to go, ""Oh, that's the guy that used to set fire to the army men on `Fridays'!"" (typical response: ""What's `Fridays'?"").  This was a wickedly funny bit in its day, and it's still worth a laugh or two (the nursery music soundtrack is amusing), but again...it just feels like the whole ""child psychopath in the making"" thing has been done to death since then.  Still, this is probably the bit people remember the most from ""Fridays"".

""Dick"", Michael Richards' other recurring character, a wannabe swinging single who loosely holds his cigarette while bobbing his head and smiling vacantly with an air of cool as he approaches women, who are of course instantly creeped out.  Again, funny in its day, a good vehicle for Richards' physical comedy, and quite obviously the prototype for Kramer of ""Seinfeld"", but the sketches tend to run longer than they need to.

""Nat E. Dred, The Rasta Gourmet"", woefully underused cast member Darrow Igus plays a Rastafarian Chef whose recipes always include cannibas (or ""ganja"" as it's called here). His crowd-baiting chants (""Do we fry it? No, no, nooo, no. Do we bake it? No, no, nooo, no. We SMOKE IT! Yes, yes, yeess, yes!"") were the sole draw to this recurring bit, which only underscores the fact that ""Fridays"" culled most of its humor from constant drug references and a whooping audience ready to pounce on every oversold line.

""Enter the Matzoi"". I only list this as a highlight because it inexplicably gets three entries in this ""best-of"" DVD. A young Larry David (easily the worst actor of the ""Fridays"" cast, but obviously smart enough to realize this shortcoming by staying behind the camera on ""Seinfeld"", where he reaped millions) and Bruce Mahler play mellow monotone rabbis with deadly martial arts skills.  Didn't laugh once in any of the sketches.

""Friday Edition"", the show's take on ""Weekend Update"", with infinitely less funny jokes. I did actually laugh out loud though at a bit from the last episode on this collection, in which Rich Hall (quite funny in his few appearances towards the end of the series) shows courtroom sketches from a murder case in which the courtroom sketch artist is pegged as the real killer, and continues to draw sketches of himself expressing shock at being ratted out and led away by police.

""The Ronny Horror Picture Show"". The booklet and cast/writer interviews desperately want you to believe that this was the pinnacle of their acheivements in ""biting political satire"".  Because it combined ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" with commentary on our newly-elected president. Didn't laugh once. Not even during the hamfisted ""You shouldn't have smoked that joint earlier"" line that of course got a huge reaction from the audience. Gotta give them an ""A"" for effort though, as this was quite the elaborate production.

""The Hollywood Cubes"". An actual funny premise for a sketch in which instead of the ""Hollywood Squares"" sitting in a giant tic-tac-toe grid, the celebrities are in a giant Rubik's Cube that gets rotated with every correct answer. Predictable, but humorous.

The Music Performances. ""Fridays"" didn't skew nearly as ecclectic in their musical guests as ""SNL"", but that doesn't mean they went for the middle-of-the-road crowd either. The Clash made their first-ever stateside television appearance on the show, playing a mutli-song set of ""London Calling"" selections that will remind you why this band is so well-regarded by critics and fans. The Stray Cats (possibly my most-loathed band ever) made an appearance before they ever had a U.S. recording contract, and the announcer makes a point to tell that to any record company executives watching. Elsewhere, performances from Pat Benatar, the Cars, Devo, Kiss, Dire Straits, Kim Carnes, Graham Parker, Kenny Loggins, Randy Meisner, and Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers show these classic rock artists in their prime (well, except for Kiss, appearing at their career nadir doing their only live performances of material from their much-slagged ""Music From `The Elder'"" album).

And of course...the Andy Kaufman on-air meltdown. Even at age 13, I knew this whole thing was staged. It was pretty easy to tell who was in on the joke and who wasn't. Jack Burns isn't exactly known for his thespian abilities (this is the guy who only lasted nine episodes on ""The Andy Griffith Show""), and it shows the way he goes up swinging to Andy, as if the producer is going to do that with the cameras rolling. A lot of hype about not much.

The main contention of this DVD of course is the fact that it's not complete, that many sketches and musical performances are missing from these 16 shows, not to mention the many other episodes missing, surely due to clearance issues.  I would certainly give it a higher rating as well if it were a complete collection, but I can't imagine I would find it any more satisfying beyond having full closure on the series.

A must-have for collectors of pre-""Comedy Central"" sketch comedy shows, but for those looking for tons of laughs...look elsewhere.",1383091200,9,6692,4.8931095406360425

5733611,2,B00CPTUNY2,"I remember Fridays when it was on TV. I was probably a little young and definitely more easily amused as I tried to enjoy this collection but I just did not laugh. The sketches revolved around just mentioning drugs, which I never thought was funny.  I have to admit that I liked this show when it was originally broadcast but I now wonder what the heck I was thinking back then. I thought seeing Michael Richards and Larry David from Seinfeld would be pretty cool but Larry David was pretty peripheral on this show and Richards, although prominently featured, is not all that funny. You can see how Kramer evolved from this, but there is no substance here.

The best thing I can say about Fridays is that they featured awesome musical guests, with the best bands of the day like The Clash and Stray Cats.  Then, this collection chose to sometimes edit both songs of many of these groups and sometimes edit one of them out of the collection.

Definitely not worth buying!  Catch it on Netflix if they have it and see if I am wrong.",1380153600,4,1030,4.457446808510638

5733616,5,B00CPTUNY2,"This is the Late night Comedy and Music show that aired on the ABC network. This is NOT the Movie ""Friday's"" For some reason people hear the title and think of that movie. This is where Melanie Chartoff did the Weekend News Updates. Michael Richards (Before he was Kramer on Seinfeld) played Battle Boy a kid that loved to set his army men on fire and clip off their heads. Darrell Igus played the Rasta Chef where every dish had the special ingredient of Jimmyganza. The whole staff did the spoof of Rocky Horror called ""The Ronnie (Regan) Horror Picture Show"" The running Gag of Howdy Doody talking dirty and Andy Kauffman was on the show and was in several scuffles and the FIGHT on stage everyone seamed to remember for years.

I was particularly wowed by the recently recorded interviews with cast and writers. In addition to 'getting to know' the real performers beneath their personas, I had not fully appreciated how groundbreaking this program has been in the history of TV comedy. The element of this being live, of the risks the cast and crew had to continually face, engendered great appreciation for their ballsy courage and raw talent.

The shows have a feel of a late night 80's party. Drug humor is cheered for and the bands are mostly all rock n roll. It's great to see a silly side of a younger Larry David as well. With all the music licencing rights I'm not surprised it took this long to come out on DVD. I hope SHOUT can release a second best of Fridays soon.",1377820800,4,634,3.9224806201550386
5733629,4,B00CPTUNY2,"By a miracle of timing, ABC's made-to-order ""Saturday Night Live"" clone ""Fridays"" took to the air (in 1980) just as the remaining members of SNL's classic original cast (with Bill Murray having long replaced Chevy Chase; Aykroyd & Belushi left after Season 4) and producer called it quits after five years.  SNL's new cast and producer were its worst ever, opening the door for the new Fridays group of upstarts to take the lead in presenting edgy social and political satire in an election year.  Despite its lack of breakout stars of SNL's Eddie Murphy-Mike Myers-Adam Sandler-Tina Fey ilk (which was over a 25-year period!), I would contend that, between the two shows, this Fridays cast over its three-season run was the best top-to-bottom of any besides those 1975-1980 SNL ensembles.  Ditto for the production and the writing.  I also think that by not promoting certain cast members over others as SNL would blatantly do, the Fridays ensemble was all the more cohesive for it - just about from the start.  Also, not using guest stars during the early part of its run gave the sketches greater rein and provided for more of an edge.  When they brought in the Hollywood types to host, the show became more about them, and its satirical force flattened out considerably.  Fortunately, very few of those shows made into this so-called ""best-of"" collection.

Five favorite Fridays funny offerings (from this collection):

-""A Night in Tehran"" -- A mash-up of the Marx Brothers' ""Duck Soup"" and the contemporary politics of Iran.  John Roarke's Groucho impression is flawless.  The writing is brilliant; the timing, energy, choreography and music - in short, everything about this sketch simply amazes.

-""The Ronny Horror Show"" -- Like ""A Night in Tehran,"" another spectacular opening sketch - and this one at an unheard-of length (for commercial TV) of 17 minutes.  It's a dazzling and devastating satire of the new administration, and Roarke's Reagan impersonation is scary good (literally, in this case).  Another tremendous production.  The audience, whose breath has been taken away (figuratively) goes wild at the end.  Probably big ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" fans who could barely believe the stunning display of talent they just witnessed.

-""Diner of the Living Dead"" -- This nightmare-inducing but genuinely clever and comical human-flesh-eating zombie sketch caused a half-dozen ABC affiliates to drop the show - and this was only the third episode!  Possibly the single most memorable line of dialogue from the series:  ""I think I'll have the feet.  Hold the toenails.  [And] oh yeah, a side order of bunion rings.""

-""The Hollywood Cubes"" -- It's Larry David as Dr. Erno Rubik hosting a ""Hollywood Squares"" rip-off game show.  Hilarious lampoon of the worship of showbiz celebrities of dubious talent.

-""Matzoi!"" -- Larry David and Bruce Mahler as orthodox rabbis who moonlight as martial artists and secret agents.  Mahler reprised his rabbi character 15 years later on ""Seinfeld,"" co-created by David.

More of a curiosity piece than it is actually funny: Andy Kaufman dropping out of the lame ""Marijuana"" skit in progress and getting into a brawl with the show's co-producer Jack Burns, an ex-Marine.  This event is explained in the bonus disc, but then we are left to ponder if they are telling the whole truth three decades later.

Michael Richards specialized in weirdo sketch characters, presaging his Kramer role on ""Seinfeld.""  A number of these become tedious as does the glut of early one-joke sketches featuring spitting and dribbling and grossly freakish behavior that somehow made it to air.  Worse, there is far too much pandering to their drug-obsessed young LA live audiences that whoop like crazy at every drug reference no matter how gratuitous.  The ""Friday Edition"" segments (their unabashed rip-off of SNL's ""Weekend Update"") have not aged well and completely tanked when Rich Hall joined Melanie Chartoff as co-anchor and proceeded to maul all his punch lines with his halting, marble-mouthed delivery.

As for the musical guests (yet another lift from SNL), real value is added to this set by the memorable performances of The Clash (four songs in their U.S. TV dbut), Devo (""Whip It"" - classic!) and Stray Cats (outstanding on ""Stray Cat Strut"" and ""Rock This Town"" - their two big hits).  I could do without KISS, and Kenny Loggins' ""Keep the Fire"" (the first guest musical performance in this set) is unimaginably lame and awful.  The other performances fall somewhere between just okay and good.

This is less a ""best-of"" than a ""here-are-among-the best-episodes-(or-partial-episodes)-we-could-get-legal-clearance-for-at-this-time.""  In any event, there is more than enough good-to-great stuff here to make this a worthwhile acquisition.

The bonus disc includes hour-long reunions of the cast (sans Larry David, unfortunately) and the main writers.  The chemistry that made this show work is still there.",1377734400,19,4950,5.1954602774274905

The reason I loved the show so much, and the reason it died an early death, was its spot-on political satire, which took no prisoners during the Reagan era.

5733634,5,B00CPTUNY2,"THIS one I'm excited about!  After having purchased bootlegs of ""Fridays"" of dubious quality from maybe NOT not the most...""reputable"" vendors, I'm anxious to see how the ""restored,"" blah-blah-blah ""Best Of"" will be.  I outgrew SNL about the time ""Fridays"" was, more or less, peaking, because ""Fridays"" presented material infinitely funnier than SNL; and even though I, an ardent Republican, didn't always appreciate the disrespect either SNL or ""Fridays"" afforded President Reagan, ""Fridays"" could be excused because, otherwise, the material was...well, better, for lack of another adjective.  The musical guests were of about commensurate quality/desirability than were SNL's (Kenny Loggins?  Kim Carnes? ""Frankie and the Knockouts?""  Oh PLEASE), but still: ""Fridays"" afforded me my absolute, very FAVORITE ""television-moment"" of the year 1980, when, that wonderful Friday evening, Ian Hunter and Mick Ronson performed ""We Gotta Get Out Of Here"" (WITH Ellen Foley doing the same thing to him that she had done Meatloaf several years earlier on ""Paradise By The Dashboard Light"") AND ""Once Bitten Twice Shy.""  Thank you, ""SHOUT!,"" whoever you are, for making the ""Holy Grail"" of ""late-nite TV"" finally available.  But still: I dimly remember a ""late nite comedy show"" in either 1980 or '81, doing a brilliant faux/""Marx Brothers"" skit about the then current situation in Iran, and I've yet to find it, perusing my current DVD collection; do any of my ""fellow reviewers"" remember such a skit? 8/21/13 happy update: The ""A Nite In Tehran"" sketch IS on DVD #2 here.

Some may wonder why we only see 16 of the 58 shows - when Shout currently plans release the full several year series of the old Dobie Gillis show... Shout has had to invest more for the music rights behind the Fridays shows - and has had a lot more red tape to deal with in general with this series.

5733637,4,B00CPTUNY2,"Back in 1980, Fridays was ABC's attempt to emulate the late night success that Saturday Night Live had achieved, with their sketch comedy program.  Similar to SNL, the cast consisted of a group of relative unknown talents, who performed live before a national audience.  Fridays ran for three seasons (1980-82), and produced 58 episodes.

Like SNL, the format of Fridays would also come to include guest stars, and live musical performances.  The Best of Fridays features 16 episodes.  Guest stars include Valerie Harper, Billy Crystal, William Shatner, and a controversial appearance by Andy Kaufman.  Musical performers include The Cars, Devo, Kiss, The Clash, and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.

Fridays did feature a cast with some talent, notably Michael Richards and Larry David, who both went on to work on Seinfeld. Rich Hall and Stuart Pankin, both later appeared on HBO's Not Necessarily the News. Also featured were Mark Blankfield, Melanie Chartoff (Parker Lewis Can't Lose), Maryedith Burrell (Throb), and Bruce Mahler (Police Academy films).

My memories of Fridays are pretty misty, although Michael Richards' over the top antics, playing war with his army soldiers in a sandbox, is an exception.  Richards, Blankfield, Chartoff, and Burrell, do standout as being the most memorable to me, in this program that aired back when Reagan was serving his first term as President.",1369612800,10,1391,5.286363636363636
8584722,1,B00CPTUNY2,The funniest thing about the first episode is Kenny Loggins. And I'm afraid that's a mean kind of funny because he can't help being himself. I can't watch another episode.,1523232000,,171,4.733333333333333
8584723,5,B00CPTUNY2,"I loved this comedy show when it was on TV many years ago; it was my family's regular Friday night entertainment.  Being to see it again is a real treat, and the DVD is great quality.",1516838400,,183,4.083333333333333
8584724,4,B00CPTUNY2,"This is a forgotten piece of television history. Sort of a knock off of Saturday Night Live, but better in many ways certainly better than post-1985 SNL.  Production values are sometimes a bit rough, but it gives one a better sense of being live television/improvisation.  Many of the sketches are quite raw, in terms of their subject matter and propriety but are somewhat naive in their presentation. Social commentary is a bit more in your face than SNL and, 35 years later, has lost some of its immediacy.  Some sketches are better than others. Those involving political satire seem to drag on forever; others you cant get enough of. A young Michael Richards (aka Seinfelds Kramer) alone is worth the purchase price. His characters, especially George Bargate and Battle Boy, are incredibly conceived/executed  They are funny, to be sure, but possess/convey a dark, uncanny pathos that is extremely rare in a comedic actor. This collection is also worth having just for the musical acts: The Clash, Devo, Tom Petty, Jim Carroll, et al., back in the day. And no stupid house band.",1516579200,,1081,4.923076923076923
8584725,4,B00CPTUNY2,Loved the show when it aired in the 80s. To bad all the shows didn't get released. The show was my introduction to King Crimson with Adrien Belew.,1504915200,,146,4.25
8584726,5,B00CPTUNY2,"The show was ground breaking back in the 80s and gave Saturday Night Live a run for it's money, at the time, because the quality of that better known show had reduced it to a shadow of it's former self.

The comedy on Fridays was weird and at times cringe-worthy, but the cast introduced people to some unknowns who went on to greater success (Michael Richards until he went all Racist ; Larry David, Melanie Chartoff, among other).

But the REAL reason I bought this collection: The musical guests! This set of shows contains a who's who of iconic 80s performers, particularly The Clash, the Cars, Dire Straits and Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers. The comedy may seem dated and awkward by today's standards but the MUSIC was breath taking and made this collection well worth the price for some rarely seen performances by awesome bands.",1498176000,,835,4.712328767123288
8584727,5,B00CPTUNY2,"I really liked this show when it first aired.  I'm so glad this DVD came out.  Great skits.  Very funny show.  To me, it ranked right up there with SNL back in the day.",1497225600,,168,3.8529411764705883
8584728,3,B00CPTUNY2,"Such a rare find but, I wish the complete run of shows was available. Very early work by Larry David and Michael Richard.",1496448000,,121,4.304347826086956

8584730,2,B00CPTUNY2,"Although some good sketches are included, the best ones were left out. Not as good as I expected.",1493337600,,97,4.444444444444445
