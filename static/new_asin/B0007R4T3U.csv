2238121,5,B0007R4T3U,"This was one of the best-made movies I have ever seen.  From the script to the performances to the direction, everything was fantastically done.  All those things helped drive home the impact of the events.

It may be difficult to fathom a million people you don't know, dead in a country you couldn't find on a map.  This movie takes you there, and makes it real.  See it.",1105660800,4,373,4.426470588235294
2238122,5,B0007R4T3U,"This is a movie that is unforgettable in it's accurate portrayal of human brutality. It is an ugly indictment of the West's refusal to intervene in a crisis that allowed unspeakable slaughter to occur. The film is incredibly well written, well acted and the scenes are frighteningly realistic. Don Cheadle is superb as the heroic hotel manager who more than rises to the occassion using his wits to keep his family and hundreds of others safe in the midst of chaos. He surely deserves great recognition for this role.

Rwanda is a lesson in how Governments and the media can selectively focus on problem areas in the world and also can selectively ignore others. For example most Americans now know differences between shiites and sunnis and kurds but how many know the differences between tsuties and hutus ? That fact that the hatred portrayed in this film is so irrational combined with the look the other way attitude of much of the west contibutes to an astoundingly shameful episode of recent history. The film does much to illuminate and educate.",1105401600,176,1053,4.85
2238123,5,B0007R4T3U,"Just several hours ago I watched this movie in the only theater within my my area that is actually showing it, and I now feel compelled to write my first review for Amazon.com.  This is one of the most powerful movies I have ever watched, and it has evoked a wide range of emotions within me: shame for the West's apathy towards the Rwandan Genocide, disgust for the heartless murders that took place, and admiration for those who had the courage to actually try and make a differance rather than just wash their hands of the affair through hollow words and shallow sentiments.

Hotel Rwanda has been called ""The African Schindler's List"", due to the seeming ability of one man--a Hutu hotel manager--to save the lives of over 1200 Tutsi refugees.  The parallels are of course salient, but in a sense the fact this occurred only ten years ago injects the element of shame and pertinency into the movie for *our* generation.

  Don Cheadle does an excellent job playing Paul Rusesabagina, the hotel manager.  His authentic delivery and emotion throughout the film are incredible, and frankly I believe he deserves the oscar, even though Jamie Foxx himself was outstanding in Ray.  The supporting cast all do an admirable job as well, and one of the delights of this film was that the second half is an almost a completely African one, save for Nick Nolte and the faceless UN soldiers.  I would highly encourage anyone curious about this film to see it.  We all have been exorted to never forget the Holocaust, and to pay our homage through the various films, books, and museums that have made their way into the collective consciousness thanks to the media.  Like the Holocaust, we should never forget this; indeed we have a duty not to forget and to make sure it remains in our memory because we, as ""The West"", had the power to make sure the words ""Never Again"" rang true, and unfortunately we failed.

One wonders at times whether or not the destiny of Africa is to suffer.  It's sad to note the plight of this region and of Africa as whole since the Rwandan genocide.  The neighboring country of the Congo has suffered 3-4 million dead in a horrific yet almost wholly ignored civil war (with Rwandan participation) while Sudan's Darfur crisis has once again tested Western and UN resolve.  When will ""Never Again"" mean Never Again?",1105228800,14,2334,4.7002457002457
2238124,5,B0007R4T3U,"If this film had been released at any other time in our history, it would still be a powerful, inspiring film. That it was released while we are spending billions upon billions of dollars killing people to instill democracy in Iraq makes it all the more significant. Yes, I realize that the Rwanda situation occurred during the Clinton administration, so I'm not blaming Bush for this catastrophe. That would be ridiculous. But I *am* blaming the West for turning their back on a country in desperate need. The horrible truth is that the West - in general - simply doesn't care about Africa, which is a point bluntly made in the film by Nick Nolte's character. He said something along the lines of: ""You just don't matter. You're black.""

This movie isn't the story of the Rwanda genocide. At times, I found myself wishing, perhaps out of morbid curiosity that it was. I'm glad, however, that we saw very limited instances of the massacres because, frankly, in today's age of television being everywhere, I've seen enough real life bombings to last a lifetime.

This movie instead is the story of a man who is a manager of a four star Belgian hotel, who was at first hesitant to become involved in the political upheaval surrounding him. Instead, he turned the four star hotel that he ran into a refugee camp of those fleeing the Hutus, though he himself was a Hutu and could have avoided the trouble simply by claiming his Hutu heritage and leaving the confines of the hotel. But his wife was Tutsi, so of course he could not leave her.

Don Cheadle, who plays Paul Rusesabagina, does a miraculous job. He is perfectly contrite as a good hotel manager should be, his emotions well contained, and his accents perfect. The genocide comes as a surprise to him, for he seems to believe (in the film at least) in the general goodness of man; that the warnings heard on the radio that the Hutus will be killing Tutsi's like flies are not to be taken seriously.

One of the most interesting moments in the film came when a reporter, played by Joaquin Phoenix asked two women: how can you tell the difference between a Hutu and a Tutsi? They explained that Hutus generally had wider noses, and mentioned some other ""structural"" differences. He asked the two girls what they were. One was Hutu, the other Tutsi. He expressed surprise, as did I, for I thought the two could have been sisters. It's a very pointed commentary on the ridiculousness of the bloodbath that occurred. People were divided by how they looked - and in some cases, you couldn't tell the difference at all.

Bring that back home to America...we're still having some of those same problems in our country. Thankfully, those problems aren't likely to break out into genocide, although they do cause some rather ugly turf wars. But there is a mirror here that reflects those exact problems that led to genocide - we are not immune.

This movie was uplifting, wonderfully acted, and deeply touching. It also enraged me, and as I left the theater I commented to my friend that I was embarrassed to be from the West.

I disagree with one reviewer that it would be an embarassment to give Oscar nods to Million Dollar Baby, Ray, or others over this film. There are many worthy contenders this year. Don Cheadle certainly deserves consideration for Best Actor, but can we honestly say that his performance was more moving and emotive than Jamie Foxx's? Anyway - my only point is that this movie is just as worthy of Oscar consideration as many other films released this year. It will be an Oscar's ceremony that I will be interested to watch.",1105228800,34,3597,4.655118110236221
2238125,5,B0007R4T3U,"I rarely review on Amazon, but I have to for this movie. It is ... amazing. Stunning. I can't really come up with adequate adjectives. Trite as the phrase ""must see"" has become, every consonant rings true with regard to Hotel Rwanda.

From the initial depiction of civilized, stable Rwanda to the ending credits, this movie is gripping and eerily reminiscent of past tragedies (like the Holocaust). The numbers vary but the sheer horror of the insurgents' actions is similar, and when one reminds oneself that this happened only 10 years ago, 1994, it evokes a shudder of revulsion. It is too easy to dismiss such horrors as the Nazi concentration camps as 'in the past'. But this is now, or very close to it.

Contrary to previous reviews, I don't think this movie encourages negative stereotypes of African culture. Yes, many of the peacekeepers were white and yes, many of the rebel leaders were black. But this is inconsequential! The issue at the heart of this movie has nothing to do with race and everything to do with sheer humanity. Too many people are able to avoid facing the genocide in Africa by believing that the country is backwards somehow, that it is third-world and therefore undeserving of attention or aid. This movie shows just how wrong, and how harmful, such an impression can be.

I have never been so touched by a movie before. I started shaking about halfway through and didn't stop until the credits were long gone. Hollywood's cookie-cutter box-office busters don't hold a candle to this film. They may entertain you for two hours. Hotel Rwanda will take you beyond that. This movie makes you feel. It is an intense experience.",1105142400,3,1656,4.783216783216783
2238126,5,B0007R4T3U,"As much as I like Martin Scorcese, The Aviator simply pales in comparison to this harrowing and more important film.  And with all due respect to Clint Eastwood and Ray Charles, it would be an embarrassment to America to give the Best Picture award to either of those films, however entertaining they might be.

Don Cheadle is Oscar-worthy and 100% convincing in his role as the Hutu Paul Rusesabagina, and Nick Nolte and le grand Jean Reno give outstanding performances in their limited screen time.  British-born newcomer Sophie Okonedo also gives a fine performance as Cheadle's Tutsi wife.  Filmed in South Africa as an international (mostly Canadian) production, the faces of the many other important supporting characters looked more than sufficiently authentic, providing a profound human backdrop to the events unfolding on the screen.

Regarding the film, there are a couple of points where the forced dramatic moments border on excess, but in all cases the faces on the screen included white ones, lending a certain amount of slack.  When African faces were alone on the screen, the terror was sufficiently evident to never have to feel forced.  The plot devices certainly owe a debt to earlier films like The Battle of Algiers, Salvador, The Killing Fields, and Schindler's List, but we should remember that this is essentially a true story.  Furthermore, Hotel Rwanda's focus on one family and the strength of its bond provides an element of hope and positive feeling that brings something new and invigorating to this genre.  That is something that African Americans, in particular, would be well-served by seeing (rather than worrying themselves about Kobe, or listening to the perverse messages prevalent amongst their current ""leaders"").",1105142400,2,1753,5.209964412811388
2238127,5,B0007R4T3U,"What does a hero look like?

If you formed your impressions of heroes only from watching American movies of the past couple of decades, you probably wouldn't even glance twice at Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle, in a great, quiet performance), the real-life hero of ""Hotel Rwanda.""

When we first meet him, Paul is the very model of the modern toady. As the unctuous manager of the four-star Hotel des Milles Collines in Kigali, he has perfected the arts of bootlicking, apple-polishing, bowing and scraping.

He flatters and bribes the corrupt generals and politicians who run the country, slipping bottles of single-malt Scotch and Cuban cigars into their hands. He courts foreigners, pays off black-market suppliers, tells pretty lies and generally does whatever is necessary to keep things running smoothly inside his hotel, owned by a Belgian company that's a holdover from Belgian colonial rule of Rwanda.

But outside the hotel, a long-running civil war that is also a holdover from colonial rule is heating up. The Hutu majority, angered by the assassination of the Hutu president, is on a bloody rampage, murdering Tutsi civilians in the streets, in churches, even in orphanages. By the time the genocide is stopped, 100 days later, they will have murdered nearly a million Tutsi, Hutu moderates and relief workers.

Western nations -- including the United States -- inexplicably turn away from Rwanda, offering no help. The U.N. peacekeeping forces (led, in the movie, by a miscast Nick Nolte) are tiny and are further hampered by orders to not engage in fighting.

What can an ordinary Rwandan hotel manager possibly do?

Plenty, as it turns out. Paul is a Hutu, but his wife, Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo), is a Tutsi, and so, by default, are their children. He is driven by a primal need to save his own family, but as the slaughter continues, more and more friends and neighbors beg him for help.

By the end, Paul shelters 1,200 people in his hotel, saving them from certain death by doing what he always has done: bribing and cajoling the Hutu powers, calling in favors, lying and outsmarting his foes.

He is the Oskar Schindler of Rwanda, a man who becomes a hero by chance and circumstance, using qualities not generally considered heroic. He's no Rambo: He's scared, and conflicted, and full of doubts. Throughout the film, you can see he'd rather just save his family and not have to shoulder this burden of heroism.

Director Terry George (""Some Mother's Son"") knows not to get in the way of this harrowing story, which Rusesabagina himself insisted on telling straight, without movie-ish embellishment. It's all true and, given the context, remarkably subtle. (George earned the PG-13 rating by only suggesting the terrible violence, not showing it.)

Still, as the tension builds you can't help but feel you're watching the heir to a classic Western -- perhaps the ""High Noon"" of modern times, or ""Shane"" -- as this one man steps up to save the town from the marauding bad guys. Of course, he doesn't save the entire town. As with ""Schindler's List,"" you're left with the grim knowledge that the people Rusesabagina saved were but a tiny percentage of those who were killed. The triumph comes tempered by the greater tragedy.

You might call ""Hotel Rwanda"" the feel-guilt movie of the year, because it makes no bones about rebuking us, its audience, for the inaction of the West. At the Toronto International Film Festival, it screened immediately after the gripping Canadian documentary ""Shake Hands With the Devil,"" which returned to Rwanda 10 years later with Romeo Dallaire, the Canadian military officer in charge of the U.N. forces (the character loosely played by Nolte, under a different name).

In the documentary, one observer asks another: Why weren't American citizens demanding that our government take some action? How could we let this happen?

The answer: ""They were all watching the O.J. Simpson trial.""",1105056000,5,3938,5.0015290519877675
2238128,5,B0007R4T3U,"This movie is based on the true story of Paul Rusesabagina (played by Don Cheadle), a hotel manager of a luxury hotel who was directly responsible for saving over 1,200 lives during the genocide in Rwanda in 1994.

Rusesabagina uses his connections to keep these people alive, and tries to get help for them. The movie is very touching, and it saddens me that the real Rusesabagina is not better recognized for his courage.

I highly recommend this movie to all. I expect that it will be receiving a number of awards because the acting is phenomenal. The events that took place in Rwanda were gripping and tragic, but Rusesabagina's story is simply awesome.",1104278400,14,657,4.754385964912281
2238129,5,B0007R4T3U,"Like ""Monster"" this movie angered me so much that I ended up loving it.  Take ""Life is Beautiful,"" make it Black rather than white, make it a tragedy rather than a comedy and you have this film.  Okay, I admit it: I teared up a few times, ""Color Purple"" and ""Joy Luck Club""-style!

I never knew why critics, across racial identities, have always praised Cheadle until now.  I didn't like his faux-British character in ""Ocean's Eleven.""  However, he does a great job with an African accent here.  I am sure that many viewers will think he's directly from the Continent when they see this.  Though the real life story probably happened in French, these English-speaking actors did a great job.  African children's singing and rain give rich detail to the story being told here.

Given all the controversy surrounding the Simpson trial, ""Waiting to Exhale,"" and baby daddy jokes, it's finally good to see a unified Black family.  Cheadle plays a strong, Black father reminiscent of Cosby during the 1980s.  Devoted fathers of all races and nationalities will be touched by the dynamics of the nuclear unit featured here.

This film was suspenseful; I'm sure that every audience member sat on the edge of their seat.  However, like ""E.R.,"" the results of violence is shown, rather than the violence itself.  I'm worried that the lack of violence will allow viewers to minimize what happened in the 1990s.  It's hard to emphasize the tragedy of genocide when no killing is shown directly.

I am worried about how some will respond to this film.  It makes the U.N. and peace advocates look naive and racist.  This film could play easily into the hands of those who want to justify war, especially current wars, HINT-HINT!  Further, this film shows many benevolent white characters (the Red Cross worker, the French priest, volunteers for Doctors Without Borders) while, with the exception of the main character, the viewer sees only belligerent and corrupt African men.  Racism and the oppression of those in the developing world is mentioned.  Still, this movie makes Blacks, especially those on the Continent, look very bad.  Moreover, the fetishization and hording of beer among the Blacks in this film particularly worried me.  Belgium, the former colonizers, take no blame in what happens here which is very problematic.

In addition, this may make some viewers condemn free speech.  Throughout this film, a radio station advocates Hutu power.  It almost felt like hearing a faceless Orwellian Big Brother.  Still, we have radio personalities in the US that appall me.  I hope this movie doesn't want to suggest the same shouldn't happen in the Motherland.

Question:  why did the oppressive majority tribe have pictures of white hands shaking on their clothing?

Above all, I loved this film.  It is worthy of all Oscars.  The work will make viewers think seriously about asylum, genocide, and postcolonialism.",1103673600,8,2910,4.995833333333334

Based on a true story  about the massacre of hundreds of thousands of people. as the world did nothing.  UN troops where not allowed to help even when they saw horrible kills right in front of them.  The main actor plays the role of Manager of Hotel Rwanda and is one of the best actors/roles I have ever seen.  After watching the movie I checked out the history of the events on Y-tude  and the movie was all true, even more horrible in the documentary.  I noticed only a hundred thousands views, it appears no one rally cares. Remember that all  it takes for evil to triumph is for enough good men to do nothing.",1469404800,3,694,4.359375

1. I think that Don Cheadle did a great job. So I liked that part of the movie just because fun to see good acting.
2. The specific ""why"" of this genocide not really explored. And not really important to the theme of the movie which is more universal. But I would recommend reading a little of the background and some of the theories as to why this horror struck this particular nation.

Inspiring that some individuals retain decency and dignity in impossible situations. The majority of such individuals do not survive these circumstances. The protagonist was lucky in that regard.",1469318400,3,725,4.708661417322834

Tutsis were more European in appearance, with lighter skin, taller, and viewed as more elegant in nature. The Tutsi rebels were hated because they were collaborators for the Belgian colonists. Hutus claimed the Tutsis stole their land and beat them. Hutus were now in the majority and had ruled since their independence from Belgian in the early 1960s. Paul Rusesabagina, hotel coterie, sheltered 1268 Tutsi and Hutu refugees during that time. It was announced on an extremist hate radio station, to incite a violent retaliation, that Paul was a traitor for providing a safe haven for the Tutsis. A bounty of 10,000 francs was put on the heads of the Rusesabagina family. By some sort of a miracle, they escaped being harmed. Those who could have came to the rescue of Rwanda, the French, the British, the Americans were afraid to intervene. The Clinton Administration didn't want to confront another Somalia, which occurred three months earlier, where Black Hawk helicopters were shot down. The genocide ended in July 1994, when Tutsi rebels drove the Hutu army and the Interhamve militia across the border into the Congo. They left behind 800,000 men, women, and children corpses. ""A Problem from Hell"" by Samantha Powers cites interviews with top Washington officials, exposes once classified documents, and gives accounts from witnesses who were there during those 100 days of terror.",1462492800,6,1547,5.138888888888889

2238638,3,B0007R4T3U,"Hotel Rwanda, 2004 film

This is a story about the racial genocide that occurred in 1994 Rwanda (former Belgian Congo). The Tutsi people are regarded as collaborators with the Belgians, the former colonial rulers. [There was a scandal in the early 20th century about colonial exploitation.] The Hutus are told to slaughter the Tutsi people. [Is there any area where there is no prejudice?] The UN General asks if there will be peace. Mr. Paul is an important man, he manages the Mille Collines Hotel, the best in the country. Soldiers in the street arrest a man. There is nothing we can do. The Belgians created the differences between the Tutsis and the Hutus. There are reports of a rebel militia force that is training to attack. The peace treaty has been signed, there are UN forces present.

There are reports that the President has been killed by the Tutsis. Cut the tall trees now says a voice on the radio. Mr. Pauls identity card is checked (he is a Hutu). The soldiers order the hotel to be evacuated. Paul knows how to buy influence to save lives! 100,00 francs is the price. The Europeans are leaving but rooms are scarce. Children from St. Francis Orphanage arrive. The UN will not intervene. The Mille Collines Hotel is a oasis of peace. A camera man brings videos of atrocities. Will the world intervene? No, the UN soldiers cant shoot. Only foreign nationals will be allowed out. Then soldiers arrive to order everyone out of the hotel. They want a list of all the names to identify the traitors. There will be no rescue and no intervention forces. A general says they will be protected. Paul needs supplies. He is warned all the Tutsis will be killed.

On the return trip he sees the bodies along the road! The UN Colonel has exit visas for some people, there is a convoy. Reports say over 500,000 were killed so far. A family is separated. A radio calls people to attack the convoy. Mobs attack the convoy. Back at the hotel Paul is told no money, no protection. Paul offers a deal to the General. They go back to the hotel, Paul finds his family. Soldiers shoot at the men following the convoy. They reach the refugee camp. They look for missing children and take them away. Theres always room.

It seems the Belgians used the divide and conquer policy to divide the people of the Congo. Its legacy was tribal hatred. [Was there no conflict before?] Paul and his family now live in Belgium. There was no mention of the assets of this country. Mining for valuable ore? Agricultural exports? I don't remember much, perhaps there were other events in the news to distract peoples attention from this horror? There was no mention of economic conditions. I suspect there was a local economic depression, good times create happy people who are not out to hate somebody as scapegoats for their problems. But economic prosperity is usually followed by bad times, like winter follows summer. The payoff to the general recalls The Sign of Four.",1413417600,,2953,4.662188099808062

It is also a story of how one person can make a difference in so many lives and how hard it is to be a hero. Each step of the way was difficult and terrifying. It challenged this man's character, yet he continually made the choice to risk his life to help others, despite the fact that he could have walked away and saved himself easily. Bravo!

French is the primary language, therefore we listen to it in English with French Subtitles making a vocabulary list of new words and phrases.  We then discuss the historical aspects since most of my students are taking or will take World History II and in that class the civil war between the Hutus and Tutsis are taught.  Then in addition to that we use this movie's events as prompts for writing exercises.

The world, knowing what was going on did nothing to save these people and is again, a prime example of how useless the United Nations and the previous League of Nations, does nothing but discuss problems in the world, but does really nothing to help or stop it.

If the world had acted as it should have none of this would have taken place.  This should be required viewing in schools and universities to keep reminding our latest generations of the possibilities of these exact circumstances happening again, and again, and most of the time under the guise of ""Civil War"" like the Syrian conflict, which again, no does anything to stop.

I hope people understand that our deeds on this planet are watched closely by our creator and though it may seem to many that he no longer cares, he does, it is man that no longer cares and free will is the cost we pay against the Creator, that enables events like this to transpire.

All the more so because the movie was based on a true story.

The acting of all main actors: Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, and Nick Nolte was so skillful that at times throughout the movie, it felt like I was watching a documentary up close and personal.  The directing, script, and cinematography were excellent.

I will lend my agreement that the acting was great all around, and the story was one that most in the United States would probably never hear otherwise.  It was based on a true story.  How much of the story that was told on screen was true, I do not know.  I presume that parts of it were fictionalized.  It did give glimpse of just how corrupt the government was, and how the people who did not have connections and money to stay alive were killed off in droves.

The film is actually not all that gory.  Most of the story takes place inside the hotel where people were kept relatively safe.  However when they did venture outside the hotel (like when the UN were trying to get some of the families out) you did see what kind of violence and indiscriminate killing was going on.

2238935,5,B0007R4T3U,"Nowadays, gory scenes that depicted a battle or a human tragedy in Hollywood have become as trendy as the obnoxious white wires sticking out of ipod user's ears on a San Francisco bus. Started with Saving Private Ryan, directors competing to win the most realistic and most horrifying visual affect of physical human beings being destroyed.

We were literally in disbelief when we saw a movie that didn't show any blood gushing scenes that froze audiences cold in their seats, teeth chattering. Especially in a movie that seemed to have all the permission to use it, Hotel Rwanda.

Judging by New York Times review, there are certainly audiences who demanded to see such scenes. I, am not one of them. Neither, it seemed, are my friends who saw it with me. We were all grateful of their absence.

Sometimes, trusting an audiences imagination is respect.

The absence of cruelty in visual elements didn't diminish the movie's powerful emotional message in any way. We were still left frozen cold in our seats, teeth chattering, tears pouring, ashamed of what had happened in Rwanda, ashamed of the rest of the world's inaction, indifference, and cowardice.

It reminded me of The Pianist, because it presented the same drastic contrast of the most beautiful of human being side by side with the most cruel and senseless of the same species. The blinding contrast blew me away. Left me stunned with incomprehension and sadness. Instead of Chopin's immensely pretty piano concerto resounding above the ruins of Jewish Ghetto in Warsaw, we saw the beautiful Tutsi girls dancing their traditional dance in the middle of the massacre. Their heads roll in that lovely curves, the radiant smiles on their face as if shone from the sky like sunlight, so lyrical and so full of joy amidst of all the chaos happening around them. The only thing separate that joy and the savage death occurring a few yards outside the hotel wall was one man's courage and wit. At that moment, I felt the same way as when I was watching the Pianist. I wanted to will that beauty away, diminish it, hoping it is not so stunningly pure and happy. Because in the back of my mind, I wondered that if human beings is not capable of producing such beauty, maybe they wouldn't be able to produce such cruelty either.

We often used the word ""savage"" or ""animal-like"" to describe human cruelty. But I haven't heard one kind of animal out there would not stop once their enemy admitted defeat and left their sight. What animals out there would go for genocide, over and over again? What animals have such crazed appetite for blood and destruction, except us humans?

I also liked the fact that the script showed how Paul didn't start out as a saint and savior. At the beginning, all he wanted was to save his own family. No more, no less. But the environment, and all the events led up to the final rescue forced him into his position. Somehow that reminded me of Johe Irving's Owen Meany, where the talk of ""being God's instrument"" played an dominate role. I was also grateful the director left God out of these. Hotel Rwanda remained a movie about humans. Human behavior, human characters, and human psychology. In the middle of the ever more darkened landscape, the characters remained ordinarily human. That alone seemed extraordinary.

I remember when I first saw Schindler's List some twelve years ago, I said everyone should see that movie once in his/her lifetime. I would say the same for Hotel Rwanda.",1359504000,,3473,4.776666666666666

2238968,5,B0007R4T3U,"Thoughtout the history of the 20th Century there have been many episodes of genocide that took place all over the world. Among the more note worthy are Hitler's concentration camp's of the 1940's and Pol Pot's killing fields in Cambodia in the 1970's. Then there is Rwanda in the 1994. The killing of innocent men, women and children was brutal after Rwanda gained its independence from the French. While under control of France the members of the Tutsi tribe were given special treatment by the French much to the hatred of the Hutu, the other major tribe in Rwanda. The best jobs and favors were given to the Tutsi from the French. When Rwanda finally gained its' independence and the French left it made the Tutsi vulnerable to the backlash they were about to recieve at the hands of the Hutu after the years of repression they recieved at the hands of both the French and the Tutsi.

""Hotel Rwanda"" tells the story of the genocide that took place in that country in 1994 and in particular tells the story of one mans' courage,Paul Rusesabagina, to save the lives of as many of his fellow country men. What makes that all the more remarkable is when you realize that Rusesabagina is a Hutu and the majority of the lives he was saving from the genocide that was going on were members of the Tutsi tribe. To Rusesabagina what tribe you belong to wasn't important as trying to save as many lives as possible from the senseless slaughter that was taking place literally outside his front door. Paul Rusesabagina is played in the movie by Don Cheadle. Cheadle has had an outstanding career in acting but his work in ""Hotel Rwanda"" might very well represent his best work as an actor. This is certainly my favorite movie that Don Cheadle has made. He plays the part of Paul Rusesabagina with such ease and conviction. I don't believe I have ever seen such a well acted roll since Gregory Peck was Atticus Finch in ""To Kill A Mockingbird"".

But while Atticus Finch only had to try to save one life Paul Rusesabagina had many times more lives to try to save as he franically and skillfully tried to keep one step ahead of the Hutu soldiers. To appease them and bribe them if need be to protect the lives of his refugees who had come to his hotel looking for sanctuary from the madness that was taking place outside. The movie shows intimately the horrors of what genocide is like. That is because it was not made like some kind of documentary laying out step by step the chain of events that occurred. Instead you see it through the eyes of Paul Rusesabagina so that the killing that was taking place is more up close and personal.

Many people will and have compare ""Hotel Rwanda"" with ""Schindler's List"". It is easy to see why. The time and location could not be more different but the men (Schindler and Rusesabagina) who committed themselves to saving lives could not be more the same. Both films are truely inspirational. Both films show men who rose above the evil ferity that had taken hold of their fellow citizens and defend the defenseless at possible great risk to their own lives.

This is a movie all should see. I would include showing this to school children as well. It is important that none of us forget what took place during that summer of 1994 (or in Europe in the 1940's) because to forget is to condone the killing that took place in that country and that those who did the killing are excusable. Fortunately for all the horror of the genocide that ""Hotel Rwanda"" is about this is a movie with vertually no blood or excessive gore to speak of. For young children or those who are squimish while you will see some scenes of violence they are not made with the idea of wanting to shock or appall the viewer. The violence is toned down without lessening the savage acts that were taking place. It is well worth the time to watch ""Hotel Rwanda"" at least once.",1331856000,,3873,4.520684736091298
2238969,5,B0007R4T3U,"Any review online will tell you how good a story this is and how good the movie of it is so I really don't need to get into the obvious about all that. The movie's great--watch it period.

Few quick thoughts: Who else but Don Cheadle could have done this lead role and pulled it off with such subtlety and nuance?
Also, the movie really doesn't pull punches yet it also doesn't dissolve into showing blood and gore to make its point. For example (and without giving too much away), seeing dead bodies on front lawns carries far more weight than shooting some action scene of attacks on Tutsis. It also is ultimately a movie of hope and shows how even in the worst circumstances, diplomacy in a small way can work. Sadly, not enough people succeeded to prevent the Rwandan genocide.

As far as the DVD goes you get two excellent extra shorts--the making of the movie and the return of the actual person Don Cheadle played (Paul Rusesabinga) to the actual hotel in the Rwandan capital of Kigali, its environs and some genocide memorials in other parts of that nation. Both extras work well as good adjuncts to the package and lead to plenty of head shaking as to why the West ignored the genocide of 1994. They also show you how cool a cucumber Rusesabinga is under the most trying of situations. People talk about heroes and this guy is the genuine article.

There is also two commentary tracks. One for the entire movie featuring the director and Rusesabinga and the other of selected scenes where Cheadle gives his commentary.",1321920000,,1527,4.586080586080586
2238970,4,B0007R4T3U,"""Hotel Rwanda"" is a great movie AND based on a true story. Even if you don't know about the internal conflict in Rwanda, you will still get emotionally invested in the characters, and ultimately, you will most likely enjoy this movie. For those who are more sensitive, don't be afraid to shed a few tears as you watch the atrocities.

Even though the Rwandan genocide was quite different from the Jewish Holocaust, you can kind of think of the movie as a ""Schindler's List"" for the Rwandan genocide. Paul (played by Don Cheadle) is no politician, but he finds himself having the potential to keep over 1,000 people alive by providing them a refuge in his hotel. While he has to figure out how to hide so many people  from corrupt soldiers, he also has to keep his mixed-ethnicity family safe, even when the stakes get high. It's not like Paul was able to stop the war, but he did make an effective leader, and...you can find out the rest when you watch this movie.

2238974,5,B0007R4T3U,"What the ""Hotel Rwanda"" is can be argued, but what cannot be dismissed is the power of this two hour movie about how one man can make a difference.

Is ""Hotel Rwanda"" a story about internal, contrived politics destroying a country? Or it is dealing with how those in wealthier, more established countries prefer to pretend such trouble does not exist, that they need not become involved?

Is it about two very similar people groups killing each other? Could the movie be a reminder of how the systemic killing of a people group can happen today, that the evil of the Jewish Holocaust is not unique to the 1940s?

At first glance, ""Hotel Rwanda"" might look like a condemnation against the West's unwillingness to respond to an absolute carnage of genocidal hate. For some, they might see Bill Clinton, or the United Nations as impotent figures in this tragedy of humanity. They are easy figures to pick on, depending on the audience's personal politics, and the fact of who was in office at the time.

For me, the tremendous strength of the movie was one man's valor, of hotel manager's Paul Rusesabagina humble commitment to do the right thing, even though the world around him was chaotically destroying itself.

The plot is simple: two of Rwanda's people groups, the Hutus and Tutsis, are killing each other. Mostly, it was Hutu extremists trying to exterminate the Tutsis. A hotel becomes an ad hoc refugee camp, deftly managed by a man who preferred to be anywhere else. Can the hotel remain safe? Will the people hiding there survive?

Don Cheadle, perhaps best known for his brilliant portrayal as Sammy Davis Jr. in 1998's ""The Rat Pack,"" is hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina.

Rusesabagina was just a businessman, the manager of the Belgian-owned Mille Collines, a top hotel in Kigali, Rwanda's capital. He worked hard to raise his family, and tried to keep politically neutral. When he saw neighbors killed, he kept his head low. When he brings in neighbors to be sheltered in the hotel, he still fights to retain his neutrality. However, when refugees start coming to the hotel by the dozens, he begins a new mission as the shepherd of a displaced people.

The bulk of the movie is shot within the hotel. Rusesabagina struggles to manage the appearance of a top quality hotel, since this image helps gird them against attacks. Bribes of money and liquor provide him with more protection, as do desperate calls from some 'guests' to their powerful connections outside of Rwanda.

When the camera takes us outside, we see awful scenes of gang-style killings. Although the Hutus and Tutsis aren't Bloods, Crips, Vice Lords or Latin Kings, but instead, are arbitrarily designated cultural groups, the murders are the same. Just as in any Chicago, New York or Los Angeles gangland war, the precise reasons for the constant violence are loosely based on dictatorial leadership, bigotry and bloodlust.

Listing the scenes which sank my heart is impossible. Singularly difficult to watch was the body-strewn road where Rusesabagina was driving.

""Hotel Rwanda"" is not a movie to bring a young family. Like ""The Passion of the Christ"" and ""Schindler's List,"" it has the kind of violence which is shown to remind us of the reality of the events being presented. Like in those movies, the audience I sat with sat stunned while the final credits rolled.

Like ""Schindler's List,"" the antihero's commitment is the redemption of the story. Although 1 million ""corpses were left behind,"" we see that although many men succumb to evil, not all do. Just as Oskar Schindler could not save every Jew, nor could Paul Rusesabagina save every Rwandan. But, just as Schindler helped a few, Rusesabagina also protected those he could.

Director Terry George might have chosen to dwell on what wasn't happening, and make this a political movie ala Michael Moore. He took the higher road, and tells a story of hope in the middle of a holocaust. I fully recommend ""Hotel Rwanda."" If the movie impacts you, please consider supporting relief efforts that continue in Kigali today.

2238976,5,B0007R4T3U,"The year is 1994. The country of Rwanda is experiencing the beginning of a brutal civil war between the Hutu and the Tutsi. When the notorious Rwandan Genocide has commenced, a hotel manager named Paul Rusesabagina (played brilliantly by Don Cheadle) provides shelter for his own family and friends, as well as a thousand refugees who are trying to protecting themselves from harm. At this time, Paul does all he can to protect everyone from fear, famine, and the militia.

Since this is based on a true story, you already know that it's going to be brutally disturbing. Hotel Rwanda is a very powerful film that touches on hate, violence, and political corruption. It also focuses on family matters and, to some extent, the American media. Those who have weak stomachs will have to be warned: this is a completely solemn piece of work that's grounded in hard-hitting realism. It's not as violent as Schindler's List or Full Metal Jacket, but it's the drama and realism that makes it so gut-wrenching. And it's not only the drama that makes this film so endearing: Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, Nick Nolte, and Joaquin Phoenix give very convincing performances.

Hotel Rwanda is an excellent and unforgettable film that is quite effective due to the story being true. It's strong, it's unsettling, it's humorless, but most of all, it's important. This is easily one of the best films of 2004, and one of the best of the 2000's.

Films like this remind me why life is just one big ball of tragedy. It is very difficult to live life happily unless all these horrible facts of reality are summarily swept under the proverbial rug in our minds. Don Cheadle does a reasonably OK job in his role as the messianic hero, although his face is usually stamped with helpless despair most of the time, a lot of time the fact that he is acting oozes through the lens a little too intensely. The film tap-dances around the horrific violence going on in the periphery, there is minimal on-screen violence shown. I was always waiting for the other shoe to drop and there be an actual depiction of the massacre going on. But, in the end, it was an attempt to shed some light on the Western world's indifference to the suffering of a split-off continent that is kept in captivity by the superpowers, kind of reminds me of the film ""Martyrs"", except in geographic terms, and applied to about 1 billion people in 54 countries. Now, the ridiculous thing about this movie, in my opinion, is how the main actor does this ""heroic"" thing for all the refugees, and yet ends up leaving his country and moving to Belgium, where it's all white and safe; again, the racial and economic split is created, but people swallow it easier since the actor is black, but the egregious disregard for human life is eternally stamped on the final message of this film... after all, who cares if 700,000 people lost their lives in this atrocious genocide, as long as the charismatic wealthy hero who knew all the right white guys comes out unscathed?",1280188800,2,1599,4.590909090909091

Paul quickly drifts into survival mode bribing officials, lying, and doing whatever it takes to keep his ""guests"" alive. Don Cheadle delivers an inspired performance as the hotel owner with a heart. Even Nick Nolite as General Romeo Delaire presents Delaire as a tragically sympathetic figure--- a man who tries to do right on one hand, but is hamstrung by the very international organization that sent him to Rwanda on a peacekeeping mission.

My one concern with this movie is that it will be the only exposure to genocide that young people of my age range will endeavor to have. My generation needs to learn more about uncomfortable topics like genocide, terrorism, human trafficking, and the decrepit conditions people live in throughout various parts of the world. I very much fear that my generation with their Facebook and You Tube's will just allow the world that stands before us to slip further into blackness allowing the genociders and terrorizes of the world to claim victory over an apathetic mass of good men that did nothing.

2238979,3,B0007R4T3U,"Hotel Rwanda was a touching film that is worth viewing. This movie was set in Kigali (Rwandas capital) during the Rwandan genocide of 1994, killing approximately one million Tutsis. Hotel Rwanda is based on a factual event where a hotel manager, Paul Rusesabagina, aids hundreds of refugees by giving them shelter in the Milles Collines Hotel. This film should be praised for the characters, but the film could have had more suspense and action.
 The main character,  Paul Rusesabagina, was a calm and determined man that did what was required of him to save many Tutsis. Paul not only spared his family from danger, he gave many orphans shelter at the hotel and food. Although, while Paul was always calm in chaotic situations it occasionally appeared unrealistic how he rarely broke down and was constantly collected.
 The lack of suspense and action through out the film often left me bored. There was one major rebel attack during the movie, but it was just violent men riding by in a truck. Also, the scene that should the people scattered on the streets didn't have anything to build up to that or the killings in action. Lastly, the whole film was boring, but there could have been more suspense and action during  certain parts of the film.

(I'm guilty as charged, and pride myself on allegedly being ""well informed."")  Which is what makes the award-winning film HOTEL RWANDA all the more compelling, as it tells a heart-wrenching story about one man's humble heroics to save over 1,200 souls in the face of utter brutality.  Based on a true story, Don Cheadle gives an unforgettable performance as Paul Rusesabagina, an assistant manager at the five-star Hotel Milles Colliness in Kigali, Rwanda; when the dominant Hutu tribe (of which Paul is a member) begins a bloodthirsty genocide of the minority Tutsi tribe (of which Paul's wife, and accordingly his children, are members), Paul gives refuge to his extended family and acquaintances at the hotel, using nothing but his wits to stave off brutal armed militias bent on total slaughter.

Through Cheadle's performance we come to know Paul as a man with feet of clay who makes more than his fair share of mistakes, yet his intentions are always nothing but honorable and humane.  By his leadership and example he keeps the hotel staff working, his Tutsi guests insulated from the carnage outside, and his other guests safe.  Eventually Paul reaches his breaking point, but it's not until he has overseen the safe transport of his charges via UN trucks out of the country; when he fails to truly acknowledge or understand what he's accomplished is exactly when the viewer will stand up and cheer.

Other noteworthy performances include Sophie Okonedo as Tatiana, Paul's wife; Nick Nolte as an embittered, frustrated colonel serving in the UN Peace Keeping Force; and Joaquin Phoenix in a small, yet powerful role as a photojournalist on a mission to tell the world about Rwanda's savage civil war.  Speaking of savagery, the violence is more implied than it is portrayed, which in my book makes it all the more terrifying--and Paul's heroics all the more compelling.  HOTEL RWANDA is a lasting tribute to the indomitable human spirit.  Enthusiastically recommended.

It evokes a response from anyone with an ounce of compassion for other people, especially people who are suffering and experiencing human injustice.

The chilling account of man's inhumanity to his own countrymen and neighbors is a challenge to our sense of right and wrong, particularly when overlaid with the developed world's withdrawal and apathy of self-serving comfort and affluence succinctly summarized by the news photographer in an early scene of the movie. The story is, however, more than that of brutality and civil war.  It is the story of the love of a man for his family, and the response of one courageous individual who stands against the tide of atrocity.  The DVD contains a documentary on the making of the movie- interviewing the writer and director- that is worthwhile, as well as a filming of the hero of the movie when he returned to Rwanda after several years in Belgium.  Those help to concretize the reality of this movie and the need for people to appreciate the sadness that we inherit in the developed world as we must admit that we withdrew our own people and the UN forces at a time of desperate need.

2238997,4,B0007R4T3U,"Throughout the film, ""Hotel Rwanda"", the protagonist, Paul Rusesabagina (played by Don Cheadle) deceives, flatters, lies, and uses the property that belongs to others for bribery. In other words, he behaves in a way that I am sure Jesus would commend. Really.
The film (a true story) opens in April of 1994 in Rwanda as two rival parties, the Hutus and the Tutsis, seem on the verge of peace. But it was not to be. The assassination of the President of Rwanda led to a grave escalation in the civil war.
During the colonization of Rwanda by the Belgians, the occupiers almost arbitrarily divided the Rwandans into two groups. The Tutsi were deemed more European, and were given positions of power and privilege during the colonial period. But when the Belgians left, Hutus took charge, and they harbored a pent up hatred of the Tutsi.
Rusesabagina was the manager of a posh French hotel in Rwanda, catering primarily to Europeans and Americans. He was also a Hutu married to a Tutsi.
As hostility and chaos in the country escalated, the Hutus (soldiers and civilians) began to attack all of the Tutsi people. Rusesabagina was initially reluctant to come to the aid of his Tutsi neighbors in need. But eventually he took in many endangered family members, neighbors and orphans into his hotel.
He hoped the United Nations or other Western powers would intervene when it became obvious that genocide of the Tutsi people was taking place. But the outside world did not intervene in the slaughter of the Tutsi.
So Rusesabagina took it upon himself to save as many lives as he could. He flattered the Hutu leaders and lied to them about sheltering Tutsi and the dangers of attacking them. He used the hotel's food, drink and finances to bribe Hutu soldiers.
After six months, nearly one million Tutsi were killed. But Rusesabagina had saved approximately 1200 lives.
His story reminded me of Jesus' parable about another manager. In Luke 16, Jesus told about a manager whose boss discovered he was cheating. The manager was still in charge of his master's goods, but he knew his time as manager was coming to an end. So he brought in all those who owed money to his master and slashed their debts. This won him the favor of the debtors. The manager knew he could turn to the debtors for help when he was fired.
In this strange parable, Jesus commends the manager for being shrewd, for using the resources of his boss (which he held temporarily) to win himself long-term gain. Rusesabagina used the resources entrusted to him by the hotel company to save lives.
Jesus admired that kind of thinking. To be able to trade beer and cigars to save human lives is quite a shrewd deal. Jesus was not endorsing dishonesty with this parable. But He was teaching us that all our resources are temporary possessions. And if we are wise we will use those resources for eternity.
Just as Rusesabagina used the resources entrusted to him to save lives, we can use our resources to save lives and souls. We can use what we have to feed the hungry and preach the gospel to the poor. Jesus commends this as a shrewd business move.
(The issue of deceiving is a tricky one. In Scripture dishonesty is roundly condemned. But Rahab the prostitute is commended in Scripture for hiding Israelite spies and lying when asked if she knew where they were. Rusesabagina seems to be an honest man, but he did lie in the tradition of Rahab. On the other hand, during the Nazi Holocaust, the Ten Boom family hid Jews during the occupation of Holland. The Ten Boom girls knew it was wrong to lie. When asked whether Jews were in the house, Corrie's sister said the Jews were under the table. The soldiers assumed she was joking and ignored the hiding place beneath the floor under the table.)
 News reports say it has been screened twice at the White House, and that the real Paul Rusesabagina has met with President Bush about the current situation in the Sudan and the Congo.
Tragedies like the genocide in Rwanda are sadly not unique in history. But when such things happen, (to paraphrase the film's tag line), Christians must not close our eyes to the oppressed, but rather open our arms.",1227916800,,4155,4.676229508196721

2238999,4,B0007R4T3U,"Don Cheadle, as Paul Ruseasabagina, the Rwandan Manager of a 4-star hotel which serves as a haven for Europeans and African Elites, gives a performance that is at once measured, controlled and deeply anguished.  As a fact-based but fictionalized account, ""Hotel Rwanda"" captures the horror and absolute madness of racially-based war that had its origins in European colonialization when the Germans (and later the Belgians, to much more devastating effect) exalted the Tutsis (for the their more ""European"" physical characteristics) as the prominent ruling class over the Hutus.  The ebb and flow of decades-long resentments finally came to a head in 1994, when close to a million Tutsis were felled in a horrific blood-bath--and all in the face of European and American indifference.

Cheadle's Ruseasabagina (a Hutu who is married to a Tutsi, played by Sophie Okonedo )first shows an unremarkable decency that ascends to heroic proportions as he risks the lives of himself and family, attempting to shield and help well over 1200 people--first by crowding them into his Hotel, a temporary ""safe house"" and then by bartering transportation away from the encroaching Hutu militia.  The film's intensity is heightened by the fact that many surviving Rwandan refugees from that era were recruited as extras--essentially reliving, in a sense, a most horrendous nightmare. The movie also benefits enormously from provocative performances given by Sophie Okonedo (as Tatiana, his long-suffering wife); Nick Nolte who, as the near-ineffectual commander of UN peacekeepers, gets across the utter shame and disgust felt by many who were essentially powerless to stop the massacre; and Joaquin Phoenix in a bit part as a randy reporter who has an affair with a local Tutsi and then abandons her as casually as one would an anonymous call girl.",1212019200,,1834,5.292096219931271

2239001,2,B0007R4T3U,"There was essentially one scene in this movie that summed up the entire ordeal better than the two hours of Cheadle's camera mugging.  The bodies laying strewn about the road side when the fog lifted.  That's it.  The rest of the screenplay was fairly safe and dumbed down for the masses to enjoy.  I see many 5-star reviewers tossing out comparisons to ""Schindler's List"".  Good heavens, both films deal with mass murder.  That is where the similarities end.  For starters, Nick Nolte is horribly mis-cast as the U.N. commander.  He stumbles through his lines like a drunkard and his attempts at anger become cartoonish.  There is a constant anti-white theme throughout the film as well that I found irritating.  I understand this is Cheadles thing now...cough Crash cough...The only white cast member not displayed as a rich, callous, and soul-less blob is the woman working for the Red Cross.  Nolte's little speech about Africans made to Cheadle is laughable and seems like it was tossed in just in case the average viewer had missed the obvious agenda.

In closing, the Rwandan genocide was obviously a terrible period in world history.

All hell breaks loose in 1994 just before the president is assassinated. Following this begins the unbelievable genocide raged against the Tootsis people. Paul has to think fast on his feet to keep his wife and children alive (they are Tootsis, he is Hutu). His actions surprise even himself. Without expecting it, Paul becomes a humanitarian, saving over 1000 refugees by hiding them in the hotel while over 800,000 Tootsis were being slaughtered.

The act of killing so many people seems incomprehensible. Hotel Rwanda's disturbing content deals with the dark side of humanity. It did not try to over shadow the horror with flying limbs and splashing blood like they could of. It focuses instead on the emotional and psychological turmoil of the main characters and those within the hotel. This is one of the best films I've ever seen.

2239010,4,B0007R4T3U,"Or, ""Sir, would you like some DEATH with during your stay?""

Yes, Don Cheadle owns, quietly, every scene in this flick.

Yes, director Terry George & vet cinematographer Bob Fraisse (who served up the kinetic street warfare in ""Ronin"") cook up a little deadly cinematic ghoulash. They evoke, vividly, the feral sink of depravity that was Rwanda in 1994, when more than a million Hutus & Tutsis were slaughtered in an orgy of ferocious destruction, turning the land into a reeking abattoir.

But in the end, so what? What is the point here?

If the point is that something Horrible happened in Africa---well, folks, get over it. Something horrible is always happening in Africa: ask the Sudanese in Darfur, where a brutal genocide against the south is carried out by the Muslim Janjaweed militia, who have slaughtered nearly a million in the last two years, who take delight in refining their tactics of rape and carnage.

Or ask the Cambodians, whose skulls their former God-Emperor Pol Pot used to stack by the millions, as if building little bony towers to heaven, even as liberal lion Noam Chomsky apologized for him.

Or dial up the thousands of Iranian students huddled in broomclosets in Iran, who are regularly beaten, abducted, tortured, and killed for daring to voice dissent to the Mullahocracy's iron rule there.

I'm sure you would have heard outrage had you parachuted into Iraq before April 2003---muted, because an Iraqi expressing his revulsion for Saddam's death camps, torture factories, & rape rooms would have been in danger of apprehension by the hated secret police---and maybe had his tongue pulled off for his troubles.

What happened? The UN dithered & stalled (just as it did with Rwanda, as it does with the Sudan), despite Saddam's violation of more than 13 separate sanctions over the past decade. Eager to remove Saddam---for his atrocities, for the threat his intransigent regime posed the US, and for his probable secret WMD program (moved to Syria while the US waltzed with the UN for fruitless months)---the US took action, and deposed the tyrant in weeks.

Did the US mishandle post-war Iraq? Absolutely. But for its troubles, the US, and particularly President Bush, received nothing but international vilification: for saving millions of Iraqis from torture & tyranny, Bush was branded ""a new Hitler"". Liberal 'experts' now assure us we have no place remaining in the middle of a ""civil war"".

You know, a 'Civil War'. Just like in Rwanda. Or in the Sudan.

Which is why this type of movie, however beautifully acted, however balefully true, however illlustrative of the savagery of Man at his worst---its appeal eludes me. Does it make you feel righteous, weeping over the long-buried dead, while ignoring those about to be shoveled into the charnel pit? Does it make you feel oh-so-sweet-sanctimony?

Remember this, then: the next time you weep into your popcorn over cinematic bloodshed: when another tribe, another people, face the cameras with tears in their eyes and bayonets in their backs & beg rescue from a weary West, the answer will likely be: ""Sorry, it's none of our business. Try the UN.""

Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, Joaquin Phoenix, Nick Nolte, Jean Reno and the rest of this AMAZING cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are extraordinary to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is something else)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide important insight not to mention more than a few tears.
More relevant than ever, the movie does a great job as an eye-opener to one of the darkest events of the twentieth century.  The film provides the necessary background as well as an accurate description of conditions on the ground during the few months that the conflict lasted.  The world's reaction, or lack of it, (especially the American and British hypocrisy and inaction, and the French support of the Hutu perpetrators) is briefly touched upon.
Moreover, it could have been and it should have been much more graphic in showing what really took place in Rwanda's ""killing fields.""
Hopefully more will be done to stop the ongoing genocide in the Darfur region of Western Sudan and we will not have to wait for another movie to come out after it's all over before people become aware and do that which is humane.

To me, there were three groups that made me ashamed to be human as I watched this. The Belgians, who at one point occupied Rwanda, separated the people not based on culture or religion, but on physical appearance. The attractive people were given power when the Belgians withdrew, causing disorder, hatred, and prejudice that was not previously there. The group of rebels, angry about being under the power of their more attractive countrymen, went on a rampage and slaughtered nearly a million innocent people, showing complete disregard for human rights. And lastly, the UN did not help the locals, but instead freed foreign dignitaries, leaving the Rwandans to fix their own problems.

I was appalled once again at how inhumane we are as a race. Humanity, when left to govern itself, often winds up collapsing, as it did in this situation.

This is the story of how a hotel manager, initially concerned about his friends and family, ended up saving over 1,000 Tutsis from certain death.  He used his skills and connections to bribe and intimidate those in power to keep from attacking his hotel.

This movie is gripping through and through.  It is a just a glimpse of the violence that has occurred throughout Africa.  It also is a good indicator of the ineffectiveness of the U.N. and the apathy of the Western World.  The movie starts out with a radio announcement of the Bosnia conflicts and how NATO stepped in.  This shows where the West's concern lies, if it is in their backyard an atrocity must be dealt with.  If it is in Africa it can be ignored.

Other things mentioned in this film shed light on the events of the 90's.  When Clinton evacuated the U.S. forces out of Somalia he sent the African warlords a message; that if you bloody our noses we will cut and run.  Since then, whenever a U.N. or western force has tried to intercede in the region they try to bloody their noses so they will leave.

People talk about all the bad things that occur in their countries and how it will reflect in the future.  Africa, and the West's apathy towards it, will haunt our souls for generations to come.  What occurs there on a daily basis with no end in sight is a tragedy.  French, Dutch, and Belgian colonialism have left a system of corruption and hatred.

2239025,5,B0007R4T3U,"As a political/histories student that has studied the Rwandan genocide in some detail, let me start by just saying that I was impressed by the relatively historically accurate depictions of the various parties to the genocide(French, Belgian, U.S., U.N., Interahamwe, Tutsi positions) and the chronoglical events that take place during the movie itself. Nick Nolte's portrayal of the U.N. Colonel shackled by bureaucracy and politics (instigated by the Belgians who were among the few willing to join a U.N. mission but had 10 peacekeepers murderered in the initial days of the genocide and others and withdrew support due to domestic public opinion) is strikingly realistic and appears to draw obvious connections to the actions of Romeo Dallaire who held a similar post during the U.N.'s limited mandate in Rwanda as the events began to unfold.

Unlike many contemporary movies which draw upon the label ""based on a true story"" and feature many embellishments, the movie remains remarkably free from dramatic flourishes or moral sermonising.

As a person , I found it difficult not to be moved by the vivid portrayal of the horrors that became known as among the worst atrocities in human history; 1 million killed in less than 3 months - a faster rate of killing and death than the Holocaust. An indictment of human indifference to the plight of others, the movie stands as a testament to not just the human suffering that continues to draw its historical roots from European colonialism (German and Belgian in this instance) but also to the remarkable stories of survival which emerged subsequent to the killings.

Don Cheadle is unforgettable as the hotel manager who has the genocide brought into his home, work and family and chooses to respond to the plight of others around him (Hutu and Tutsi alike); risking everything to protect the powerless and voiceless. The soundtrack is equally brilliant; incorporating African influences and intermeshing perfectly into the various scenes (Million Voices).

Truly memorable and touching, Hotel Rwanda provides an insight into the traditional and contemporary attitude of the West towards Africans. This is perfectly captured in two particular statements: one by Jack (Joaquin Phoenix) and the other by Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte). It also triumphs the role of the individual; the actions of even one man can help to change the world around him.

I shouldn't be so quick to judge though.  His role in Boogie Nights, also featured some wonderful comedic actors by Mr. Meadows, and he was the comic relief of that movie, featuring Marky Mark.

Hutu and Tutsis - two main nationalities of Rwanda. A long time ago Tutsis presumably came from Northern Africa, from Egypt or Ethiopia, they are tall, their skin is brown, they have chiselled features and they were cooperating with Belgian colonists all the time Europeans were occupying Rwanda. Hutu are presumably natives, they are stumpy, black like night and have rugged features. Belgians did not want them to cooperate considering useless and lazy. But once Belgians left the country it was only a matter of time when Hutu would want to take revenge upon Tutsis. And in blood-soaked Africa revenge always looms.

I'd like to mention that if you're interested in this topic, there's a novel by Canadian writer Gil Courtemanche called ""Un dimanche  la piscine  Kigali"" translated as ""A Sunday at the Pool in Kigali"". Action takes place in the same hotel ""Mille Collines"" as in ""Hotel Rwanda"" and describes the beginning of Rwandan massacre that left behind nearly a million dead. The main character is a Canadian journalist who's in love with a Tutsi girl. And I'd say this book is not for the faint-hearted. In April, 2006 Canadian director Robert Favreau released a screen adaptation of the novel - ""Un dimanche  Kigali"". Although I haven't seen it yet, I hope it will be good.

2239032,5,B0007R4T3U,"Hotel Rwanda shatters complacency, so long as - in the words of Nick Nolte's UN coronel - we don't 'gasp and then turn back to eating dinner'.

Don Cheadle turns in a memorable if unpolished star turn that anchors this survival tale.

That's precisely what Hotel Rwanda is: a survival tale. A true one, to be sure, and not unlike many that remain unrecorded and unthanked because their own heros perished among the million corpses left behind by this most inexplicable genocide.

I use the term inexplicable advisedly. Hotel Rwanda movingly registers the uncommon heroism and presence of mind by which 1200 of them survived. What it does not attempt to do is to explain the causes of the tribalism that turns neighbor against neighbor in places like Rwanda, Bosnia, and  - dare I say it - Indianapolis?

That's a far different story, and one that is receiving careful attention from friends like Dr. Abel N'jerareou, living practically next door to Rwanda in Francophone Africa.

We are all tribalists at the core, an almost hard-wired instinct that becomes lethal over and over again when the family tribe upon which we settle our hunger proves too small for the design. Hotel Rwanda alludes to the same when 'family' becomes the explanation for doing nothing as the first neighbors are hauled off screaming and bloodied into the night.

Might tribalism also go some way toward explaining why nations that have the power to intervene in episodes of genocide so seldom do so? Even that amalgam of nations so easily charged with the role of international sheriff that we call the United (sic) Nations?

When the mostly white Europeans are escorted out of the Htel des Mille Collines by rescuing forces and Nick Nolte's idiosyncratically but powerfuly performed UN coronel asks for something strong at the bar and levels with Don Cheadle's hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina 'these people are not here for you', one realizes anew that tribalism is not an African phemonenon.

Critics of armed intervention except in the most extreme cases (a definition convenient enough to fairly never occur) do well to consider whether chaos is a force that - once loosed and allowed to run wild - can ever be contained to those populations where it first gains its grip.

Hotel Rwanda reminds its living-room viewer that there is evil and that it kills men, women, and children fairly indiscriminately. To say nothing of red and yellow, black and white.

The nation of Rwanda is well on its way to achieving its goal of a 'new Rwanda' where the 'unfortunate facts of history' are relegated to the past via footnoting them in the brochures for its fabulous gorilla safaris. Tensions remain. Rwanda will soon be something other than synonymous with machete-driven massacre.

The next news will come from somewhere else, where this morning neighbors of diffferent tribes chat over coffee and biscuits.",1154649600,3,2880,4.952282157676349
2239033,3,B0007R4T3U,"I must admit I saw this only after the HBO production of ""Sometimes in April"" and I found ""Hotel Rwanda"" to be lacking since it was aimed at making Americans too comfortable IMO.

The trend in the film making communities of making hard issues palatable to general audiences is disturbing to me. The atrocities in Rwanda should not be trivialized and they should not make films like this to make people feel comfortable. In ""Hotel Rwanda"" we are give the story of a man who made a difference and that is wonderful. However, the way the UN and America turned it's back on the genocide that happened is played down greatly. I feel this is due to the need to make Americans comfortable, to make us not look at what we did to help the murders that happened.

I am glad to see that this film has made more people aware of what happened in Rwanda. Maybe this will help us to not let it happen again.",1153526400,3,892,4.335329341317365

Paying the preying murderers to keep his people alive, he uses clever negotiating tactics and political pressure in what would seem a 'lost cause'. Cheadle's performance is truely remarkable. A story that everyone should know but very difficult to watch, even for the most hardened of hearts.

2239038,5,B0007R4T3U,"This film tells of a disturbing, shameful, and tragic episode in Rwandan history, a story that was shaped by the colonial racial politics of its former Belgian masters. In 1994, the African republic of Rwanda descended into civil war. The Hutu majority, inflamed by the political rhetoric of guerilla radio, rose up against the Tutsi minority. This tribal warfare led to mass murder, with neighbor against neighbor, and would eventually see nearly a million Rwandans killed.

During this time of great turmoil, fear, and slaughter, an oasis existed in the capital city of Kigali. That oasis was the Belgian owned luxury hotel, Milles Collines. There, its native manager, Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), a member of the Hutu majority, would find himself in the role of shepherd with a flock of refugees on his hands, which would include his own wife, Tatiana (Sophie Okenedo), a member of the Tutsi minority, and their children.

After the non-native guests and non-native refugees were evacuated to safety, Rusesabagina was left with the daunting task of taking care of nearly twelve hundred native guests and refugees, many of which were the hunted Tutsis, which just outside the gates of the hotel were being indiscriminately massacred, butchered with machetes or shot execution style at point blank range. Extermination of the Tutsi minority was the agenda of the day, and none, including children, were to be spared.

While a handful of United Nations peacekeepers were at the gates of the hotel, their presence was only for show, as their orders were not to shoot. One of them (Nick Nolte) finally told Rusesabagina, who was hoping for help from the outside world, that not a single country was going to lift a finger to help them, and he brutally told him exactly why. So, Rusesabagina was left with having to maneuver around the corrupt Hutu militia, getting supplies and whatever protection that he could, to ensure survival. Situational ethics was the order of the day, as Rusesabagina bribed, wheedled, and did everything he could to ensure that those in his care would survive and outlast the madness and carnage that was going on all around them.

This is a brilliant film, deftly directed by Terry George, who keeps the carnage and gore to a minimum. Yet, he manages with just a few well-placed scenes to convey a sense of the overwhelming magnitude of the genocide that took place, while the entire world watched and did nothing. Don Cheadle gives an amazing performance, low-keyed, controlled; yet, nonetheless, deeply moving. Were it not for the extraordinary performance of Jamie Foxx in ""Ray"", there is little doubt that Don Cheadle, who, along with Foxx, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor, would have won. The rest of the supporting cast also give stellar performances.

2239040,5,B0007R4T3U,"Hotel Rwanda is a remarkable film that borders between social commentary, documentary, and character study in the Main Character - Paul Rusesabagina, portrayed brilliantly by Don Cheadle.

Filmed in South Africa, it includes documentary film of actual events woven subtly into the film.

The film resists a tremendous amount of temptation to lapse into social preaching, shaming and condemnation of those nations that stood by or left in the advent of what can only be described as genocide; despite the unwillingness of those countries that fled, to use the word.  The subtle nature of what does exist in that realm, is in fact more effective simply presented in the overwhelming imagery of the unimaginable, horrifying scope of events as they played out.

It boggles the mind that the Western World could have been so complacent and indifferent.  In the US at the time, we had more important things to focus upon in the media.  The O.J. Simpson Trial took center stage and this did not raise to the level of importance to even be a lead story.  Bill Clinton identifies this as his single greatest regret of his presidency that he did not use his power, influence and resources to act.  There is no excuse that can be offered to justify that lapse.  Bill Clinton in this instance, more than any other, had greatness within his grasp to act with the greatest impact upon Human History and demonstrate the values he claimed to possess.  Yet he failed to do so.  We in the US failed along with him.

Paul Rusesabagina presents a rich study in Character and Leadership.  Others examining this film have identified his leadership in the film as situational and there is no question that a strong progression takes place from the beginning of the film where he cannot go beyond his gate in watching a neighbor brutalized to the end of the film where he has taken personal ownership of the fate of over 1,200 refugees to the extent that he is willing to remain behind and send his family to ""safety"" without him.

On may argue that circumstances dictated responses, and there is no doubt that incredible pressures skewed the responses portrayed.  However, there were choices to be made and alternatives available that seemingly offered more direct or immediate results.  What we witness is a man faced with impossible demands and challenges who must reach deep within to draw forth a higher level of leadership, a servant-leader who elevates the needs of others above his own.

Overall, this is a remarkable film.  One can only hope that the multitude of lessons available to the astute listener will be learned.  There are few films that have the potential to impact one's life.  This film can, if you will let it.",1150243200,,2709,4.809935205183585

This movie is about two tribes fighting each other- Hutus(hoo-tooz) and Tsutsis(toot-seez). The Hutus are trying to exterminate the entire Tsutsi race because of past descrimination and oppression. The main character, Paul, is a Hutu who is married to a Tatiana, a Tsutsi and they have 3 children together. He owns a hotel in which he lets anyone stay at, reguardless of tribe. During the genocide, he fights to keep his hotel a haven for Tsutsis and Hutus ho want no part in the civil war.

By now you probably know it's about a hotelier that saved 1,000 people or so from extermination during the 1994 Tutsi-Hutu uprising.

What you may not know is there is another contemporary film on the subject, ""Sometimes In April"", a made for cable flick from HBO, that in my opinion captures the action, politics and humanity of these events better than this one (see my Amazon review for more on that one).

That's not to say this is an average film, for it is clearly better than average. But it is more of a Hollywood that real life production. While the crowd scenes and, especially, the scenes of refugees leaving the city were realistic, most of the violence on screen paled by the standard set in the other film, which concentrated more fully on the human outcomes than this one, which largely were constructed around the activities of one man, his work place, his relationships and family.

One thing that irked me to no end watching this was seeling all the Rwandans speak English with an African accent. I checked out Wikipedia and learned that all Rwandans speak Kinyarwanda and share the same culture and religions.

So why make a film that's supposed to be semi-documentary on a topic of international interest where, in effect, the Nazis speak English with a German accent? Because it's a Hollywood production, that's why. Sad but true, you know money makes the Hollywood world go round.

It is simply impossible not to be touched by the movie and be on edge all through it, when you realize how much cruelty there can be in this world, potentially leading to the killing of as many as 1 million people because they are different in some way, or happen to have a certain label stamped on their passport...

I just didn't feel like I was watching genocide take place and it felt like I was just watching a bunch of no-name actors.

For this movie to be better it would have to be rated R, as it did not have enough violence to portray the killing of a million plus people. I keep on thinking back to scenes from Schindlers list (The killing of the one armed Jew, the clearing of the ghetto) and The Piano, scenes that showed the true horror of what was happening; scenes that left you felling numb and cold, scenes that filled you with emotion, scenes that when you left the movie theatre you thought ""What the heck""(<--- Had to be edited) Sadly I did not get that from this movie, however since it held my attention for 2 hours, I'll give it 3 1/2 stars.",1147564800,3,1340,4.381526104417671

Throughout the movie I dreaded seeing such stuff but even without them what a powerful and gripping movie Hotel Rwanda turned out to be. The powerful acting, screenplay and storyline compensates for all that.

Don Cheale exudes sincerity in his role of the Hutu Hotel Manager saving the lives of hundreds of Tutsis in wartorn Rwanda. His wife played by Sophie Okonedo also excels in a role that one cannot afford to ignore. Nick Nolte, Joaquin Phoenix (in a small role), and the rest of the cast and crew also deliver with unforgettable and moving performances.

Amidst all this it is sad to know that this genocide took place. So many people were killed without any reason. What did the so called Hutu gain in the process is the question. And why did the west and other nations that could offer help turn a blind eye to the deaths of hundreds and thousands of Tutsis? What will they gain by offering help is enough to answer that question. Even the United Nations refused to authorize its peacekeeping operation in Rwanda. In one small scene in the movie Don Cheale enters a Hutu stronghold from where he buys provisions for the

Hotel and notices several young Tutsi women being held captive. What irony! The Hutus kill the Tutsi's but want their women?

Many people don't know about politics and Africa and other troubled nations throughout the globe.  It would have been easy for the crew to give a one-sided tale about the horror of war and fill a 90 minute picture with nothing but blood and guts. It would have been easy to ""shame the world"" by painting a picture of a negligent international community who has larger concerns than the Rwandan people.

But the crew of this film put together a film that will resonate for many years. It involved politics, culture, family, religion, race, and many other questions of ethics. It told the WHOLE story from all perspectives and made you see the HUMANITY.

This film is a must see for anyone who claims oppression or has an interest in international affairs. It was almost like watching a documentary. This was a real event, with real people, and real consequences. If more people knew about these atrocities maybe something could be done.

While comparisons can be made to Schindler's List, I think that this film goes further to show that events like the Holocaust can happen any time -- even now -- so long as people look away, just as the UN did in Rwanda.

And almost stealing the attention from him, is the talented Sophie Okonedo, as Tatiana his wife. Both earned well deserved Academy Award nominations.

2239052,5,B0007R4T3U,"Paul Rusesabagina is Hutu.  We see the word on his passport.  His wife is Tutsi.  She is in mortal danger.  But Paul doesn't realize it yet.  He believes that the violence threatened by the ruling Hutu against the once ruling Tutsi in Rwanda will not happen because the UN peacekeepers will not allow it, nor will the world stand by and watch the slaughter.

Paul manages a luxury hotel.  He is a worldly-wise, efficient, suavely diplomatic man who dresses impeccably and who knows how to influence people with well-chosen gifts and flattery.  His demeanor is calm and measured.  He tells his driver that to give a government official or some other important person ten thousand francs is not as effective as giving him a rare Cuban cigar worth the same amount.

He visits a supplier to gain supplies for the hotel.  While he is there a crate containing hundreds of machetes overturns.  He is told they come from China at a cost of ten cents each and can be sold for many times that amount.

This is the first hint of the horror to come, and the way it is revealed is characteristic of director

Terry George's calculated method.  He has a story of genocide to tell, a story of criminal neglect by the West, especially by the United States under President Clinton who stood aside and allowed the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people to take place, as did the rest of the world through the UN.  The next hint comes from government radio in which the Tutsi people are referred to as ""cockroaches.""  This is most chilling because when one tribe or nation sets out to kill the people of another tribe or nation the essential element is to turn those people into something less than humans.  The psychological trick is to make the killers believe they are killing vermin.  One cannot help but recall the Nazi propaganda machine and its methods prior to and during the Holocaust.

Next we see in a scene at the hotel bar that it is really impossible to tell by appearance the difference between two young women, one Tutsi and the other Hutu.  The Tutsi are said to be tall and to look down their noses at the Hutu who are said to be shorter and perhaps darker, but this is clearly a fiction.  Even so, racial differences are invented and racism is inculcated into the mass mind.  All of this is necessary because the slaughter is to take place using not bullets or gas chambers, but instead the cheap machetes from China.  To get armies of young men to kill their neighbors and fellow countrymen, women and children with machetes requires the stirring up of a mass hatred of epic proportion and demonic intensity.

The personal story itself within this greater scenario is that of Paul and his family and how he was persuaded by a moral imperative that he himself felt to save hundreds of Tutsi by housing them in the luxury hotel he managed after the Europeans left.  We see how he risked his life and family and how his courage and resourcefulness proved heroic.  Terry George tells the story in a straightforward manner with vivid and deliberate detail.  In particular there are scenes of carnage on a vast scale, including the chilling horror of the nighttime bumpy ride along the ""river road"" which was said by George Rutaganda, a sadistic man, to be ""open"" and the preferred route to take back to the hotel.  The bumps in the road were the bodies of recently slaughtered Tutsi that the hotel van could not help but drive over.

The acting by Don Cheadle as Paul and by Sophie Okonedo who played his wife is outstanding.  Nick Notle is effective in the role of a compromised and nearly helpless UN commander.

This is a message film.  The message goes out to the whole world, and Terry George makes us understand that those people who were slaughtered could be people anywhere, in particular they could be middle class Americans or Europeans.  He indicates that Western prejudice against black Africans in part allowed the slaughter to take place.  By showing us the ordinary domestic life of Paul and his family at home, their love and affection for one another--their familiar humanity--we are made to share this horrific human tragedy and to realize that we could have prevented it had we only known or cared enough.

Will we care enough next time?--and there will be a next time, and a time after that and then another until such a day comes when the rule of law prevails internationally and people everywhere understand that we are all essentially the same and that the baser nature of our leaders must be controlled by law and justice.",1146528000,2,4548,4.634207240948814

People he had known, went to school with, worked with, and played were now dead and there was nothing he could do about it.

HOTEL RWANDA is a movie that tells the story of Paul Rusesabagina, a sort of modern day Oskar Schindler, who used his influence, contacts, and limited funds to save the lives of thousands of Tutsis refugees by housing them in the Milles Collines Hotel that he managed in Rwanda.

For historical reasons that really were insignificant, the Hutus in Rwanda came to power and using the military available to them began an extermination of Tutsis.  In a period of just three months over one-million Tutsis were executed by the Hutus.  Many of Tutsis women were raped before being killed and family homes that had stood for generations were completely destroyed.  The Tutsis appealed to the world at large, specifically the United Nations.  However, for the most part, the world sat silent as a massive genocide not seen since the days of Hitler took place.  The Tutsis people were left to defend for themselves and the HOTEL RWANDA became their only refuge.

HOTEL RWANDA captures a glimpse of the despair, frustration, and isolation that many people in Rwanda felt in those bleak days of 1994.  Don Cheadle gives an Oscar-worthy performance portraying Paul Rusesabagina.  It is rumored that the film's producers tried to get everyone from Denzel Washington to Wesley Snipes to portray Rusesabagina, but director Terry George insisted from the beginning that Cheadle was the man for the part and in the end his choice was correct.

HOTEL RWANDA is a moving film portraying how the courage, compassion, and conviction of one person can make a difference in the world.  At the same time, the movie is somewhat somber because it reminds us that though the events that happened in Rwanda in 1994 were unusual because of the massive scale of murder that happened in such a short time, the events themselves really aren't that unusual and are a reality that many people in Africa have to face everyday.  Events similar to what happened in Rwanda are happening right now in Uganda, Nigeria, and other African nations.  Except for in Nigeria, because of their relatively large oil reserves, the rest of the world ignores the horrors that happen in these nations.  HOTEL RWANDA is a film that works incredibly well because it forces viewers to taste their guilt for idly sitting by and doing nothing as a continent rips itself apart.

2239055,4,B0007R4T3U,"The 1994 Rwanda civil war - one of the worst civil conflicts in the 20th Century, kept in low profile as the region did not hold much sway over strategic interests of the American and European powers. Clinton's administration pulled out at a critical time and the U.N. were ineffective as around a million Tutsis were massacred by the Hutu ruling party.

So highly relevant territory for a major film telling the true story of Raul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), owner of the 4 star Hotel des Mille Collins in Kigali, who uses his patronage to provide refuge for Hutus and Tutsis in the midst of the fighting.

The horrific violence - medieval in its close up brutality with machetis, is not overblown at the centre of the action but lurks very close to the edges - the sinister indictments of hate broadcast on the radio, massacres viewed at long shot, eyewitness reports, overheard conversations. A range of techniques bring the conflict to life, in an almost documentary style.

It is this aspect of the movie which makes it worth watching over the story, which is a fairly standard one of everyman rises to hero in time of conflict to protect those around him.",1144627200,,1161,4.70935960591133

2239058,5,B0007R4T3U,"`Hotel Rwanda' is not without flaws, most noticeably the film's slightly mawkish ending, but it is still a strong statement about the humanity and injustice. More remarkable thing about this film is that it works brilliantly as first-rate thriller set against the background of the actual massacre in Rwanda without losing the touch of reality.

Don Cheadle has been known primarily as supporting actor, but in `Hotel Rwanda' he literally became Paul Rusesabagina, true-life hotel manager who saved the life of more than 1,000 Tutsi refugees, housing them in the hotel, using clever and sometimes daring tactics, and doing tough negotiations with the army and the militia demanding the life of the Tutsis inside.

And Paul is not the only one who dedicated himself to the impossible task. The film is fair in not forgetting the (if not perfect, still precious) jobs done by other people - Nick Nolte is very good as UN commander, and so is Joaquin Phoenix as journalist. It is slightly regrettable that the role of Tatiana, Paul's wife, played by Sophie Okonedo, is relegated to that of a damsel in distress, but her strong acting saves it from a typical stereotype. Jean Reno also appears (uncredited) briefly.

The script by Terry George (who also directed the film) makes use of some of the Hollywood conventions (like one `saved-by-the-bell' episode), and some scenes of the film are, to be frank, implausible. The film is most convincing (and hauntingly so) at the earlier chapters, where the impending catastrophe is palpably sensed in what you can hear in the radio news or in the rumors people talk.

As many reviewers said rightly, the film is tour-de-force of Don Cheadle. The real Paul Rusesabagina is a more robust person, but Cheadle embodies the spirit of everyman who just wanted to save his family and do the right thing. Helped greatly by his riveting acting, the film will grab your heart, being constantly unsettling, gripping, and inspirational.",1143504000,2,1965,5.0

The genocide occured in 1994 and it is now finally being revealed to the majority of the American public.  Nothing really stood out in the film that made me remember it too much.  Watch a PBS documentary about the event if it comes on television one of these days.  It will most likely be more informative and enlightening than this movie.

So naturally one feels a little bit of guilt watching accounts of what went on in Rwanda during this time.  However, the U.S. government was not the only one that decided not to intervene.

Don Cheadle gives an amazing performance as Paul Ruesabagina, a well connected hotel manager who becomes a hero when he decides to stand on his principals and assist Tutsi refugees, orphans marked for death and others who had been put on the Hutu death lists.  I was a little disappointed with Joaquin Pheonix and Nick Nolte (hard to say because I really like both of them normally); in an effort to convey the terror and panic of the  situation their performances come off as rushed, constantly reminding me that they are acting.

I would also HIGHLY reccommend that everyone watch  ""Sometimes in April"".  Sometimes in April is a grittier, bloodier account of the genocide.

2239062,3,B0007R4T3U,"Hotel Rwanda tells the compelling and true story of how hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina miraculously managed to save the lives of more than 1,200 refugees during the Tutsi genocide in Rwanda in 1992. It is a story well suited to the film medium and the script would seem well thought out.

As much as I praise the idea behind this movie it has a few problems. Firstly, the acting performances are not convincing, and this is surprising considering the talented cast. Nick Nolte is just not credible in his role as the well-meaning but hapless UN Colonel and he often sounds as if he does not believe in his own lines. The backdrop to the film is also much too clean. Anyone who has ever been to Africa would simply not recognize this Hollywood-sanitized set as anything close to real-life Rwanda.

Finally - and perhaps this is not a very nice thing to say - this movie needs much more blood. Everyone knows or has seen footage of the horrors of the Rwandan genocide but  the director simply does not convey this adequately. The unspeakable terror of these atrocities is watered down to a family-acceptable level and this is just not potent enough if you want to get the point across with any emotional force.

What we are left with is some hackneyed moralizing about the failure international community to react in time. This point is fair but many people know about that already - or at least they should know as the genocide was a textbook example of how litte the rest of the world cares about anything African.

That leaves the worthy story of Paul Rusesabagina himself and this fairly saves the movie. He is a real life hero and should be honoured as such.

But frankly he deserves a better movie!",1141516800,7,1703,4.5855263157894735

Anyone who has the slightest interest in world events knows of the killing of a million or more Tutsis by the Hutus in the mid-90's. HOTEL RWANDA is the true story of Paul Rusesabagina who almost single-handedly saved 1,200 people in 1994. His character is played by Don Cheadle, nominated for an Oscar for best actor for his role as the hotel manager. He gives a magnificent performance and in any other year should have won. Although he is in practically every frame and could have carried the movie alone, he doesn't have to as everyone else to a person weighs in with fantastic acting-- Sophie Okonedo as his wife Tatiana and Nick Nolte as Colonel Oliver, to name two; but the list doesn't stop there.

Some of the scenes are almost too painful to watch. The most poignant line in the movie for me is when a commentator asks the question and does not get an answer: ""how many acts of genicide make genicide?"" It is well-known that officials in the U. S. Government played semantics with the word ""genicide."" Cheadle mentions in his commentary included on the DVD something to the effect that the only thing that prepared him for the making of this film was run-ins with the LAPD, a sad indictment of that police force.

2239081,5,B0007R4T3U,"The film, Hotel Rwanda, is similar to Schindler's List and The Diary of Ann Frank, in that it is more than entertainment; it documents a national act of genocide of one people against another. Therfore the film has to be reviewed both as an artistic statement and as a political statement. I will cover both in this review.

First, this is suberb film making with an incredible cast of actors. However Don Cheadle demonstrated that his acting skills are of the highest order. The film did an excellent job of balancing the tensions and drama within the hotel with the terror in the streets. Major societal tensions are mirrored in the hotel staff, some of which are Tutsis and some of which are Hutus. The film did an excellent job of demonstrating the terror as parents tired to keep thier children from being murdered against a mob of Hutus, intent on killing all Tutsis in the country. Thus the film demonstrated at the individual, the family, the neighborhood, the ethnic, and the national levels the terror of this genocide.

Second,the film is a political statement against genocide and the politics around genocide. Long brewing social injustice,a breakdown of the social contract, opportunistic political leaders, prejudice and stereotypes, and a highly visible or high profile catalyst to mob violence are the formula for genocide which this film displayed very well. The film is subtle in demonstrating that many of the Tutsis were of a higher economic class than the Hutus and this was due to the Belgium preference for the lighter skinned, thinner, taller Tutsis as compared to the shorter, darker, thicker Hutus. This long brewing social injustice set the stage for opportunistic politicians to gain control of the country with ethinic warfare as their vehicle. The assassination of the President by his own military, blamed on the Tutsis rebels, and fanned into flame by violence monger radio personalities served as the catalyst that sparked the terror.

There has been much discussion around the lack of a response from Europe and the United States during this catastrope. The explanations include the recent US military crisis in Mogadishu (see Black Hawk Down for a great film on this incident), the lack of understanding of the politics and tensions in the region, the involvement of the UN in Bosnia and Serbia, and racism against darker races.  All of these forces, no doubt, played a role. However we have to ask both our politicians and the media to do a much better job of educating the public around these issues. The media was slow to report this genocide and thus delayed international action. We should never let this happen again.

Buy this film, it is outstanding. Keep it in your collection since it is part of human history.",1139097600,2,2756,4.931034482758621
2239082,5,B0007R4T3U,"I was ten when the genocide in Rwanda happened, and to this day I still can't remember ever hearing about it until some years later (I think it was two or three years later when I was taught by a history teacher that the genocide of the Tutsis in Rwanda was one of the worst genocides since the Holocaust). That should tell you how bad it was, that schools would only talk about it as a secondary item to something history deems more important. In fact, Waco was given more attention than the murder of more than 1,000,000 million people. It's sad, to think about this now and realize how misinformed as a country we had been.

Thankfully, there are people out there who feel a certain obligation to make us know what had happened to the poor people of Rwanda. Hotel Rwanda, and plenty of other movies and books dealing with the Rwanda Genocide, came out recently and started to finally shed some light on this event. Though it took ten years, we are now finally getting to chance to understand.

Hotel Rwanda is very much like the movie Schindler's List. It's about a real man who is forced to act, put into a situation where he became the protector of the people of his country. Paul Rusesabagina is the manager of a four star hotel who, when his world breaks apart because of hatred and civil war, takes on some pretty severe responsibilities simply because he was the only one who could, as the entire world has backed itself out of the conflict in Rwanda. Though a realistic thinker, he's also a man of high morals, and gives everything up--money, possibly his job, even his self-respect--to save those who come asking for his help. Using his influence and his intelligence, he finds ways to continually keep the Hutu militia from his hotel. But soon, it becomes an impossible task, and he must think about leaving the hotel. With little outside help (only a small force of UN officers and the Red Cross) he attempts to take that next step.

The character of Paul Rusesabagina is played by Don Cheadle, one of the finer actors of today, and his presence in this movie is felt in absolutely every scene. He plays Paul as a silent and  cunning man who looks at his Hutu heritage as if it were a hated middle name, something easily passed over. He knows how to work those around him, and understands more than most that the world revolves around money and bribery, and is more than willing to use this to save those around him. He chooses to be a caring human before saving his own self-respect, and this is what makes the character of Paul so special, both real and in the movie.

Though I usually cringe when recommending movies of this nature (something about historical movies always tend to twist the events to serve the needs of entertainment) I don't do so with Hotel Rwanda. I'd recommend this movie to anyone, and in fact I wish everyone could see this movie. It's equally as important as Schindler's List. It's a story of human strength and human weakness all in one, and makes a strong distinction between the two.

Cast:  Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, Nick Nolte, Joaquin Phoenix, Desmond Dube, Hakeem Kae-Kazim, Fana Mokonedo, Cara Seymour.

Running Time:  121 minutes

Rated PG-13 on appeal for violence, disturbing images and brief strong language.

In 1994, tensions between the two primary tribes in Rwanda, the Hutus and the Tutsis, exploded into full out war. ""Hotel Rwanda"" tells the true story of Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle, ""Traffic""), a resourceful Hutu manager of a posh, dignified hotel located on Belgian ground within the country, who helped over a thousand Tutsi refugees by keeping them safe inside his hotel while hell on Earth broke out all over the area.  The easy comparison to make for ""Hotel Rwanda"" is to set it alongside ""Schindler's List."" Both films feature a kindly soul reaching beyond himself for the greater good, set against the backdrop of horrific genocide (one million Africans were slaughtered during this war). While ""Rwanda"" doesn't live to up the standards set by Spielberg's masterpiece, it does feature its terror in living color, and draws attention to a moment in African history that hasn't been dramatized with much effect before.

Writer/director Terry George has covered the Irish experience thoroughly in his films ""Some Mother's Sons,"" and ""In the Name of the Father,"" and he brings to ""Rwanda"" the same strength of focus to share untold stories to the world. ""Rwanda"" is an important film, sure to open the eyes of many with its taste of the Rwandan holocaust, but it also retains a powerful dramatic arc that might upset some looking for a more documentary feel to the film. This is Paul's story first and foremost, and the violent overthrow is seen through his eyes, or overheard on heated Hutu radio broadcasts. George sustains the breathless dramatic tension as we watch Paul sprint around his hotel trying to keep the Hutu army at bay, the ineffective U.N. officials (lead by a gruffer than normal Nick Nolte) on the grounds, and his own Tutsi family alive while his supplies dwindle, members of his staff turn on him, and hope slowly drips away. Brutal violence is seen outside of the hotel, but George keeps the view of atrocities spare, utilizing them only when he needs to make a persuasive point.  As Paul, Don Cheadle crafts a sublime performance that requires far more than what the actor has been giving the cinema for the last few years. This is a touching performance of frantic internal struggling and the craft of smooth talking, and it reveals that Cheadle has something more to offer the art form. He's wonderful, and the film would be lost without his presence.  Unfortunately for ""Rwanda"", the script, which was carefully constructed by George over years of research and investigation, takes the audience through repeated ebbs and flows of drama and intrigue as the brutal Hutu army frequently visits the hotel with guns, machettes, and other forms of grisly killing machinery; however, the film never seems to peak.  Sophie Okonedo gives a fine, emotional performance as Paul's estranged Tutsi wife, earning an Oscar nomination for her efforts.  Nolte gives a fairly distilled performance as the lead United Nations saftey supervisor, while Joaquin Phoenix, who plays an assertive, yet sensitive televison new cameraman, is mistakenly taken away from the film halfway through and his talents are enormously wasted.  Just so certain audience members don't go home and stick their heads into ovens, ""Hotel Rwanda"" does end on a slightly hopeful note, which the right choice for this bleak film. While it isn't the definitive word on the Rwandan holocaust, George has constructed a fine dramatic feature, and a good first step to educating the masses on this disturbing event.  A harrowing story told with adequate execution, ""Hotel Rwanda"" is a definitive look at the perils of genocide; however, a comparison to ""Schindler's List"" is unwarranted.  Cheadle gives the performance of a lifetime; perhaps one of the most underappreciated roles of the decade thus far.  Powerful, yet not supremely spectacular.",1136073600,,4089,5.115615615615615
2239105,4,B0007R4T3U,"This isn't a perfect film.  You could argue that the ending is a bit too sunny and takes away from the power of the movie.  You could also argue that some of the violence is glossed over in favor of portraying the struggle of the main character.  But in the end, this is still a very effective movie with an outstanding performance from the always under-rated Don Cheadle in an Oscar nominated performance.

Before the movie was released, very few people in the western world knew about the genocide that had taken place in Rwanda.  In 1994, around 800,000 people, including women and children, were slaughtered by members of an extremist militia.  This movie is the story of Paul Rusesabagina, a man who was safe from the violence, but chose to help his family and over 1,200 other people by providing shelter in the hotel he managed.  While all of this was going on, the United Nations provided very little support, and most Western countries ignored what was going on, despite the fact that the tragedy was being covered by the world press.

Paul Rusesabagina is played by Don Cheadle, and he does a tremendous job.  The movie has other ""big name"" actors like Nick Nolte and Joaquin Phoenix, but they don't really bring much to the table.  The other important acting performances come from virtual unknowns like Sophie Okonedo and Fana Mokoena.  The acting is impressive all the way around, as is the cinematography and the direction.

In the end, you have to consider this an important film because it shines a light on a tragedy that might have been avoided if more people were paying attention.",1135728000,2,1600,4.715827338129497

Hearing good reviews, I watched this movie and was definitely changed because of it.  The atrocities committed, the bravery shown by Paul Rusesabagina, were all very poignant, very sad and uplifting at the same time, and all underscored by the fact that this all actually occurred.  I feel very strongly that this movie is one of the few that should be shown in public schools, because it can take someone as naive about the whole situation as me and make them understand the atrocities that happened, make them realize that something like this cannot ever happen again because real people in a real conflict were killed because of the world's apathy.  This movie needs no extras, it speaks for itself, but it does come with extras.  These include interviews with Mr. Rusesabagina himself and lead to a stronger understanding of the situation itself.  Great acting by the entire cast, especially Don Cheadle, who continues to show off unbelievable range as an actor.",1135728000,,1161,4.78

another real history u should also c is red cherry another great history about youngest war victims

i give five stars to this one too

SPANISH review

UNA DE LAS MEJORES PELICULAS QHE HE VISTO

Como dije esta es una pelicula de las que en realidad pienso que vino para hacer historia .vasada en una historia real acerca de dos tribus africanas (los huttus y los tutsis). incluso cuando ellos para el mundo no africano se ven todos iguales hay un gran odio entre ellos listo para explotar. es entonces cuando un simple gerente the hotel aparece en la brutalidad de una guerra sin misericordia y muestra come cualquiera de nosotros deveria reacionar con compasion y misericordia ante aquellos que talves no sean de nuestro grupo o raza . hay algunas esenas de violencia pero el film nunca se enfoca en la violencia si no en aquellos que hacen nuestro mundo mejor y aquellos que hacen todo lo contrario y nos recuerda si nos gustaria ser recordados como una  generacion inteligente y compasiba o  como todo lo contrario.

si te gusta esta pelicula red cherry tegustara tambien aserca de las mas jovenes victimas de guerra.",1134000000,5,1822,4.425149700598802
2239121,5,B0007R4T3U,"The trailer of this film already got me into an emotional state. You could feel the drama and the emotion there already.
Then, when I first saw the film, I was blown away.
Knowing that what I was seeing on the screen happend for real, really made me feel emotinally touched.

The story is hard to believe: because you just don't want to believe it. But sadly, it did happen for real. One million people slaughterd within 3 months in Rwanda, 1994. It really breaks the heart knowing that.
All hope is gone, the madness and the anger are there. Everything seems lost.
But then, Paul Rusesabagina, the manager of the most luxureous hotel in Rwanda is there. As the posters and advertising for the movie said: ""When the world closed it's eyes, he opend his arms""
He takes the people into the hotel and saves them from the terrible slaughter.
This gives very emotinonal and dramatic scenes. But also very tence onces that keep you on the edge of your seat.
The casting of this movie is superb. Don Cheadle is the perfect choice for  Paul Rusesabagina. He acts with feeling and portrais the hero of the story, an ordinairy man with his heart on the right place, in a way only he could.
Also Nick Nolte, who plays a colonel from the UN, does a wonderfull job. They were the perfect choices for these rolls.

Hotel Rwanda is shocking, realistic, heartbreaking, powerfull, emotional, but a yet beautiful film that shows a terrible historic event of a country.
For example: a scene that really made an impression on me was when Paul and his wife are sitting on the roof of the hotel, laughing and trying to see a light at the end of the tunnel. To forget for a moment what is happening. In the distance you hear soft ""bangs"" When you see the people on the screen trying to make to best of it, having a couple of laughs, you expect that the sound you hear are fireworks. Something happy.
But no, you know it's gunfire. People are getting killed. That really struck me.

A movie that leaves a mark on your heart and makes you think about the question: Why do these things happen?

A beautifully done movie experience.",1133481600,2,2105,4.485639686684073
2239122,5,B0007R4T3U,"When my French husband told me he wanted to watch a movie about the civil war in Rwanda, I was SO uninterested. I knew the movie had gotten alot of hype, alot of press, and had been nominated for an Oscar (or many Oscars), but I was so uninterested in watching a movie about a war in Rwanda.

And that was my typically American response to such a great and humbling movie. Luckily, my husband kept bothering me about this film, and, I finally saw it.

This is the true story of Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager in Rwanda that housed over 1,000 Tutsis refugees during the Rwandan civil war. After the UN turns its back on his hotel, he and the refugees are left unprotected against the rebel forces. Paul is given an exit visa to Belgium for him and his family, however, he would rather give up his life than have the rebels slaughter the ""cockaroaches"" as the Tutsis were called.

I was shocked that the Americans did not intervene in this situation...until I realized that they, like myself, probably had little interest in the situation until somebody shoved it down their throats. This is a deeply political movie with so many violent scenes (1000 Tutsis laying dead on a road), (prostitutes being cut in two)that children absolutely should not see it.

I cried more than once in this movie. It humbled me.",1133395200,2,1311,4.56595744680851

I was not for younger children, but it could be appreciated by older

ones. It was hard seeing what happened to these poor people, and

how other countries had hurt a ruined them by coming in and taking

then nobody did anything about it. A very well made movie !",1133136000,,399,4.197368421052632
2239124,5,B0007R4T3U,"This movie is INSPIRATIONAL and is definately a movie I'd buy for anyone on my Christmas wishlist. This movie tugs at your emotional heart strings and makes you leave the theater wanting to be a better human being. Based on a true story during the Rwandain genocide that sadly went on unnoticed to the rest of the world.

Paul a man living in Rwanda desperately wants to help his Tutsi wife and three children survive the genocide- hides not only his family but hundreds of Tutsis in the hotel he works at... making sure that they are fed, have a place to sleep and are safe. He does everything in his power to help these people from bribing soliders and virtually begging the United Nations for aide. He ends up becoming a true hero.

Paul a common man with common thoughts is portrayed in the movie to be just someone who wanted to help- his act a selfish one in the fact that he could not stand the idea of people being killed and sitting back and watching. The scenes are graphic and disturbing as you hear screams in the street as children and women ared dragged away to die at the hands of a machetti. You see Paul go from being a reasonabley wealthy Rwandian to one that must hide in his hotel and cross corpses on his way to work.

The movie dosn't distract unlike Schindler's List- the story focuses solely on Paul and the dilemeas he faces in keeping those in his hotel alive- while you hear/see the events unfolding around him. It is a crime that the movie did not win best picture of the year or that Don Cheadle didn't recieve an Oscar for his OUTSTANDING performance. This movie shows that he is one of the greatest actors in Hollywood.

This is a movie that I wish Hollywood made more of- for it's one of those movies that makes you more aware and realize that this CAN never happen again- I felt guilty after watching the movie that the US did not do anything to stop the masacree. It's our responsibility and duty as Americans to prevent these genocides from occuring- right now there is a similiar genocide going on in Sudan. After seeing this movie and the horror- imagine if it was you and your family- what would you do? This movie will make you want to change the world. I hope that people after seeing this movie will decide- we MUST do something. A great movie- well worth it's pricetag and definately a movie to own!",1133049600,,2341,4.399538106235566
2239125,5,B0007R4T3U,"Don Cheadle was inspired in his riveting performance in director Terry George's superb documentary style dramatic re-enactment of the 1994 Rwandan conflict ""Hotel Rwanda"".

Cheadle played Paul Rusesabagina hotel manager of a luxurious Belgian funded hotel in Kigali, Rwanda.  He gets caught up in the escalation of ethnic tensions between the Hutus and Tutsis that eventually led to the slaughter of some 800,000 Tutsuis and moderate Hutus.  The Tutsis were given favored status by the colonizing Belgians but the hatred intensified once independence was granted in 1962.

Cheadle, a moderate Hutu, had curried favor with many influential people in his position in the hotel.  When violence broke out he was able to shelter more than 1200 refugees in his hotel protecting them from the wanton extermination of the Tutsis by the radical Hutus.  Cheadle and wife Tatiana played by Sophie Okonedo and family were afforded some protection within the confines of the hotel by U.N. forces Colonel Oliver played by Nick Nolte.  He also bought protection with bribes to Rwandan General Bizimungu played by Fana Mokoena.

Cheadle had to use all of his influence and wits to protect those he harbored in his hotel when Western powers and the U.N. invoked a policy of non-intervention.  This decision potentiated the slaughter of the innocents and will always remain as a scar on the disposition of mankind.

George's realistic portrayal of this horrendous chapter in human history was an eye opening experience of an incident that didn't get the worldwide media coverage it deserved.  This movie represented an important addition to our social consciousness and was wonderfully executed.",1132358400,,1677,5.2669172932330826
2239146,5,B0007R4T3U,"This Hollywood movie is an outstanding telling of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. Both actors, Don Cheadle, playing Paul Rusesabagina, and Sophie Okonedo, as Paul's wife, were nominated for an Oscar for their incredible performance. Paul is the main character and a hotel manager, saving more than a thousand lives from the brutal killings.

This movie fits multiple genres: drama, history and thriller. It's a drama because of its sad and tear provoking story, history, because it was based on non-fictional events, and a thriller, for its intensely suspenseful scenes that don't let you guess what the end will bring. Hotel Rwanda is about a group of people during the genocide and how they dealt with the atrocities of the situation. Paul Rusesabagina and his family spent months in the hotel along with many others without food and in extreme and constant fear for their lives.

One of the wonderful things about the movie is, that it isn't just another Hollywood bloodshed, but without concentrating on the dead and how they died, portraits a very realistic image of the struggle between the Hutus and the Tutsis. The movie will open your heart and mind for the Rwandan victims.

Hotel Rwanda starts by weaving in a little bit of political history so that you can understand and appreciate what's going on, even without knowing much about politics in Africa. Then it lets the pot of hatred heat and boil over and no one is able to turn it off. Unimaginable brutality begins and the world refuses to help.

Portraying the real events of the 1994 genocide this movie grabs your attention and pulls you in like an action thriller. Having met Paul Rusesabagina personally and heard first hand that everything in the movie reflects realty, I can only recommend this amazing movie.",1132272000,6,1777,4.893687707641196
2239147,5,B0007R4T3U,"Based upon a true tragedy, this movie speaks volumes about the depravity and is a stark portrayal of exactly why optimistic humanism has never lived upon to its promises.

This film is downright sad. Sad in the absolute hatred that is exhibited and also the uncertainty and fear that goes along with this particular war.

I was emotionally moved by this film and the portrayal of the abandon of hope from the West was really eye-opening.

This film brings out some stark realities in international relations and intervention. One of them is that world powers are reluctant to intervene out of pure principle, they normally only do so when it is to their advantage. When it comes down to it, practically speaking, many people see people across the ocean as being less ""human"" and therefore would be reluctant to intervene on pure principle.

Don Cheadle does a fantastic job in portraying the main character.

The film screams: How much would you be willing to risk to save people from genocide?",1132012800,,994,4.823529411764706
2239148,5,B0007R4T3U,"Saw this film last night, and I was blown away. This is one of the most realistic and engaging docudramas that I've ever seen. For once a Hollywood production doesn't butcher a true story but rather portrays a horrific event in history with relevance and compassion.

Don Cheadle does a remarkable job as the assistant hotel manager of a Belgian luxury hotel in the capital of Rwanda. He plays the real life Hutu man who saves nearly 1300 people from certain death.

From the start of the film the audience is plunged deep into the heart of Africa, into a country which is torn apart by a civil war between the two main tribes, the Hutus and the Tutsis. Ironically, the two tribes came about as a result of the Belgian colonists who arbitrarily separated the indigenous population according to their physical features: tall, narrow nosed and attractive natives were titled Tutsis while the short, broad nosed and less attractive people became the Hutus. The Tutsis were put in charge of the Hutus by the Belgians, which naturally created an animosity and a clear separation between the two groups. Several centuries later, the Hutus are in charge, while the Tutsis rebel, but not before the Hutus commit a mass genocide of Tutsi people. This all occured back in 1994, and even though the western world was in the middle of it with UN troops, they did virtually nothing to stop it. The insanity of it all is that they're all the same people who just happen to look slightly different, but due to the evil influence of the Belgians, the nation was split in two along a line of hatred that eventually erupted after generations of abuse.

What's fascinating is how Don Cheadle's character manages to constantly out-smart the enemy on all sides, against all odds no less. He was without a doubt a master of politics and if it wasn't for his quick thinking, compromising, general knowledge and people skills, 1268 people would have been added to the body count.

I truly felt for the plight of oppressed people in this film, both Hutus and Tutsis, since the evil knew no bias. The performances all around were as authentic as one could possibly expect, and as heart felt as human emotions go. It really tugs at ones heart strings and makes the audience question how such horrors can occur in the first place, and why the western powers do virtually nothing even though they have the power to stop the bloodshed.

There are so many tragic ironies in this story which makes life seem like such a sick joke at times, especially considering that such events are still occuring at this very moment in places around the world, in any number of African countries no less. The insanity boggles the mind. How can genocides still happen despite the horrible lessons humanity learned from the past world wars? How can the west merrily ignore their desperate pleas for help?

This kind of film is important to see not only for its artistic spirit and truthfulness, but also to open people's eyes and question the world around us, and it makes people appreciate what they have even more as opposed to taking our peaceful existence for granted.

Perhaps the most poignant moments of the film is when human lives are reduced to the value of trinkets, money and booze. It's an interesting study into the heart of madness and the ultimate depravity of mankind, how seemingly ordinary people can succumb to the utmost reaches of deplorability.

Definitely some food for thought and I'm glad to say it's original unlike the CGI fodder that's fed to the masses.

P.S. There's a mini-documentary as an added bonus on the DVD which drives the points home even further, notably the memorial at one of the greatest massacres. It will chill one to the bone.",1131840000,2,3726,4.72
2239149,5,B0007R4T3U,"Hotel Rwanda would have been a fantastic film without Don Cheadle; but his performance gives it so much. It's hard not to be reminded of Liam Neeson's portrayal of Oscar Schindler, but Hotel Rwanda has just the kind of human believability that Schindler's List lost quite quickly. Cheadle is touching, believable and inspiring in this role, and I for one am looking forward to seeing more of his work in the future. It's nice to see some famous faces popping in on Hotel Rwanda - Nick Nolte, Jean Reno, Joaquin Phoenix - but these are all cameo appearances, and it's the less familiar actors, Cheadle first and foremost, that give their whole and make it the fantastic experience that it is.

And yet, the actors aren't the focus of this film, or at least not all of it; Hotel Rwanda is practically a documentary, and excluding a few sentimental moments, it makes no dramatizations and no beautifications in presenting the horrors of the massacre in Rwanda. If at times the film seems to drive the message home a bit too forcefully - and it often does; Hotel Rwanda leaves very little to our interpretation, and that sometimes interferes with the drama: I had a bit of a problem with characters uttering lines that explain what we should have figured out for ourselves, like Joaquin Phoenix saying 'I'm so ashamed' to nobody in particular just after spending several minutes showing just how ashamed he is - it's all part of the director's intention. Hotel Rwanda doesn't make excuses for itself: it refuses to leave any viewer indifferent, and it refuses to let you twist its meaning. The message is so plain and strong that it cannot be ignored and overlooked. The film is just enough shockingly brutal to make sure that we get it. And we do; it's a depressing, powerful experience, which makes you as truly ashamed as Phoenix's character was of the kind of horrors human beings are capable of, and of your own inability to interfere.

Hotel Rwanda never had a shot at the Oscars - it's just too frank and too straightforward for the Academy to stomach. But it might just be the best movie made this year. At any rate it's an important film, a film that needs to be watched and demands every bit of your attention.

2239153,5,B0007R4T3U,"While it was easily one of the best movies in a slow year last year, Hotel Rwanda was just as easily among the most frightening.  The prevailing storyline may be a moving and inspiring, but it takes place against the backdrop of some of the most horrific events in recent memory.  In a manner reminiscent of Schindler's List and The Pianist, Hotel Rwanda uses its story to shed a stark light on one of those instances where the unthinkable happens, namely the Rwandan genocide of 1994.  Fuelled by decades-old tribal hatred stemming from the days of Belgian colonization, and enabled by the fear and indifference of a Western world still reeling from the then-recent disaster in Somalia, that year the majority Hutus unleashed a paroxysm of violence against the country's Tutsi minority, killing nearly a million men, women, and children in a period of barely three months.  While ethnic and tribal clashes are nothing new-witness Israel, Ireland, and the former Yugoslavia-the convergence of factors in this case seemed especially combustible, a fact to which the staggering body count certainly attested.

Exploring the genocide mostly through the eyes of one man, the movie seeks to find redemption among horror by illustrating a single instance of the best of human nature in the midst of an explosion of the worst.  Don Cheadle has a tall order in filling the role of real-life protagonist Paul Rusesabagina, but he manages to bring equal amounts of passion and nuance to a role that demands both.  For those who don't know by now, Rusesabagina was the Hutu manager of the prestigious Hotel Milles Collines in the Rwandan capital of Kigali, a hotel that literally became a refugee camp when over a thousand people sought shelter there from the guns and machetes of the rampaging Hutu milita.  The movie wisely portrays Paul as less a born hero than one who had heroism thrust upon him, as the narrative sees him emerge from a consumnate businessman concerned with himself and his family (his wife was a Tutsi) to the savior of hundreds, both Hutu and Tutsi alike.  While it should go without saying that Hotel Rwanda is a dramatization and therefore not entirely factual per se, the portrayal of its hero is never less than believable.

The violence is largely implied, rather than explicit-there's nothing to match the most cringe-inducing scenes in Schindler's List or The Pianist-but the film more than succeeds in capturing the sheer terror of what was occurring.  This is never more true than in perhaps the film's most harrowing scene, when a minor fender bender lands Paul and a villainous employee in a clearing-turned-slaughterhouse, and Paul gets out of his van to the sight of corpses strewn out literally as far as the eye can see.  There's no action or dialogue, but the harsh reality of senseless massacre is still put on the sharpest possible display.  Even more than the violence itself, though, the dehumanization necessary to murder on such a massive scale manages to terrify: much like the Holocaust and the Rape of Nanking, the Rwandan genocide was spurred by a belief that the enemy was completely outside the bounds of normal human decency.  Alternately referring to the Tutsis as traitors and ""cockroaches,"" the Hutus were able to justify their indiscriminate butchering of civilians with the time-honored devices of scapegoating and projection, which are ultimately the backing for pretty much all such atrocities.

The movie also conveys yet another sad reality of human nature with its implications of the widespread apathy that greeted news of the atrocities in the Western world.  Granted, many countries were in no mood for foreign entanglements in the wake of the bungling of the humanitarian crisis in Somalia (including the deaths of 18 American soldiers vividly depicted in Black Hawk Down), but in light of the occcurrences in Rwanda the refusal to intervene shown by the so-called international community was still shocking.  Unfortunately, Western governments were concerned primarily with protecting their own, as the movie bitterly demonstrates when the United Nations peackeeping forces aren't allowed to evacuate anyone from Kigali but foreign nationals.  Of course, people everywhere tend to be concerned primarily with their own-their families, their friends, their countrymen-so the tragedies of Rwanda ultimately aren't all that surprising.  The impotence of the UN is brought into especially sharp relief through the well-meaning Canadian colonel played in career-reviving fashion by Nick Nolte, whose good intentions are outweighed by his inability to do much of anything to stop the rampant bloodshed.  It's not at all surprising to see Paul quickly reduced to bribery and bargaining with the Rwandan army and Hutu militia to keep his charges alive.  While there are some moments of odd poignancy and even dark humor to be found here, for the most part Hotel Rwanda is a depressing (if still necessary) watch largely because it illuminates the aspects of our nature that we don't often acknowledge.  Ignorance and insularity are realities of life in the U.S. these days (we're at war with Iraq right now, but how many Americans have been there or even know what countries border it?), and Hotel Rwanda is clearly intended to reflect those realities back at its viewers.

Now, before I take my leave of this overly long review, it should be noted that Hotel Rwanda tells only a small part of the story of Rwanda, and it's a fictionalized part at that.  Watching it doesn't substitute for reading about the events themselves and what they can tell us, so you shouldn't expect it to (which is also why so many of the criticisms I've seen of this movie on this site are off base; people seem to be knocking it for not being something it's not supposed to be).  However, if this movie manages to stimulate some thought and discussion, all the better.  Whatever the case, though, it's certainly a brilliant movie in its own right, filled with powerful imagery, moral indignation, and Cheadle's captivating acting.  And if you do feel like reading up about the Rwandan genocide, may I suggest Scott Peterson(no, not the murderer)'s gripping book Me Against My Brother.",1128902400,7,6213,5.047898338220919

No, but there was no monetary gain in Rwanda.",1128038400,2,353,4.130434782608695
2239155,2,B0007R4T3U,"Reducing the massacre of 800,000 people to the acts of bravery of a single man is a disturbing approach to dealing with the 1994 Rwanda genocide. This movie is well directed and well acted but it is plagued by the obsession of Hollywood's producers to glamorize terrible historical events by making the suffering of hundreds of thousands a simple background to the actions -- albeit courageous -- of an individual. We have seen that before in movies such as ""Schlinder's List"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"". ""Hotel Rwanda"" goes as far as delivering a feel-good ending, just the type of movie we might have been watching on a Sunday night of Spring 1994 while overlooking the terribly efficient implementation of a genocide in a vague and far away place.

It is very unfortunate that the marketing noise that surrounded the release of ""Hotel Rwanda"" drowned the launch of a much better movie on the subject: ""Sometimes in April"", produced by a director with an African viewpoint and shot on location in Rwanda, not in South Africa like the comfortable ""Hotel Rwanda"".

""Sometimes in April"" is an excellent movie that focuses on the events as experienced by the Rwandan people and not just one man in a relatively cosy position responding to them.

""Hotel Rwanda"" is good film making, but it is not good education. And in the scope of this tragedy, learning is essential.",1127606400,25,1364,4.84549356223176

Never Again !?!?

My fellow Christians, American citizens, or citizens of a globally economic and political world.  This genocide that took place in a poor central African area, called Rwanda, is a shame to us all, especially the United Nations.  To the fact that we, as ""post-modern,"" ""englightened,"" ""affluent"" people allowed or stood-by watching while 800,000 Rwandans were killed in the space of 100 days between April and June of 1994 (according to BBC news).

This movie will not shock you right away ... as I have tried to do!

It slowly creeps in, few details here and there, subtly introduced by a clever director.  This story of suffering and mass-genocide starts innocently in a country where at first it seems that two tribes can get along with each other.  But ... just like in Nazi Germany ... the propaganda of hate and politics, of race/tribal-membership spread by means of mass-media, wreaked havoc in a country where the two tribes (which spoke the same language, occupied the same areas, shared the same traditions) were already segregated one above the other by their previous European colonists.

The genocide of Rwanda is told from the eyes and real-life experience of a manager (Paul Rusesabagina played by Don Cheadle) of a Belgian resort hotel in Rwanda's capital city.  The movie details the experiences that Paul goes through trying to save his family and friends (who happen to carry ID cards of the hated tribe Tutsi).  He uses his diplomatic and social skills to garner support from Hutus close business associates, local Belgian/UN troops, other African nations and their governments, and even the management of the hotel chain that was headquartered Brussels.

The true life-changing and life-shattering story of Paul is one of survival, of anguish and pain, or horror at seeing what was happening to his fellow countrymen, and of deep soul-searching while waiting for a response from the outside.  This is not a movie that I want to see again any time soon.  The memories of horrors and anguish presented are still vivid.

The cinematography is impeccable, and this real drama-style movie ends like a documentary one, with details on the historical realities of Rwanda 1994 and Paul Rusesabagina's family situation.

This movie has won the 2004 Audience, and Best Feature award at the 2004 American Film Institute.  In 2005 it had three nominations at the Acadamy Awards and three nominations at the Golden Globe Awards.  Another cool factoid: this movie is a Canada/United Kingdom/Italy/South Africa co-production, and the first-ever co-production between the rival independent film studios Lions Gate Films and United Artists (according to Wikipedia)

May we never again live or experience such horrors, genocides, and mass-murders as have recently happened in Rwanda, Bosnia-Herzegovina ethnic cleansing, Sudan-Darfur debacle.  Never again!

A great companion book on this subject is Philip Gourevitch, ""We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families; Stories From Rwanda"" (New York: Picador, 1998).",1127433600,3,3168,5.223320158102767
2239157,4,B0007R4T3U,"When I first heard about this movie, I remember wondering how the absolutely horrific events that occurred in Rwanda could be captured in a PG-13 movie, and still stir the outrage they should.  After seeing HOTEL RWANDA, I know they can't.

I remember years ago getting my Newsweek delivered and finding inside some of the most disturbing photographic images I've ever seen.  Reading the statistics in the accompanying story simply added to the horror.  How could our modern society, with its instant communications, color TV, and so forth have let this bloodbath go on?  Hundreds of thousands of people murdered in the most horrific ways.  And yet, it seldom even made front-page news.

HOTEL RWANDA is a handsomely made film, and it is VERY well acted.  Don Cheadle is particularly fine in the role that finally got him some  attention at awards time.  He is so underrated, because he's so effortless.  We're rarely aware of him acting.  Sophie Okonedo, as his wife, is radiant. I sure hope to see her in more movies in the near future.  The story of this man and wife (he is in a management position at a luxury hotel in Rwanda and finds himself not only taking in refugees who are doomed to be killed otherwise, but risking his own life to save them) is riveting as far as it goes.  We absolutely admire the risks they all took...Cheadle in particular shows great amounts of courage shining through knee-quaking fear.  He's the most reluctant of heroes...he's almost saving the lives of his refugees because that's what you do for your guests.  I don't mean to downplay his achievements...I'm simply saying that his courage is almost casual...as though no sane person would make another choice but to be brave.  But you can tell underneath that he's terrified.

But the outrages that took place in Rwanda still demand more attention.  The film tries to show how the outside world abandoned Rwanda in its time of extreme crisis and chaos.  But so much brutality is missing.  Am I looking for gratuitous violence...no.  But I would like to see the public shocked out of its complacency.  Remember how SCHINDLER'S LIST got people talking about the holocaust as no other movie ever had.  Or how SAVING PRIVATE RYAN made clear the path for THE GREATEST GENERATION and fundraising for the long-overdue WWII Memorial?  This was in great part because Spielberg set out to slap us in the face with a visceral reminder of that the people who lived those events went through (and the people who didn't survive).  Both of those films left me silent, amazed and beyond tears.  HOTEL RWANDA should have done the same.  Certainly the atrocities committed were of a caliber to rival events that occurred in Europe in WWII or in the USSR during Stalin's reign.

So, I guess I watched the movie with the wrong expectations.  I found the story fascinating and engaging.  The scene where the couple agree that they will commit suicide with their children if the rebels come (and later, when Cheadle thinks they may have mistakenly carried out their pact) will put a lump in your throat, and move you to the edge of your seat.  Another scene where Cheadle and a companion are forced to drive their truck of supplies over piles of bodies begins to suggest what this movie could have been on a visceral level.  My intellect was stimulated, my heart was moved, but my gut stayed uninvolved.

By all means, see this fine movie.  But don't let it fool you into thinking what happened in Rwanda is being captured in the film.

I seldom comment on the bonus materials, but in the case, I would say that the DVD offered a perfect opportunity for a ""history lesson"" documentary about Rwanda's recent political history...just who are the Hutu and the Tutsi's?  But it's not there.",1127347200,2,3753,4.744976816074189

He went above and beyond the duty he had and tryed to help in all ways, even going so far to argue with his superiors over UN involvement. He played the only fictional character in the film, but was closely modeled after Romeo Dallaire, the actual UN peacekeeping commanding officer, who involved himself much more in the intervention of the genocide than he was technically allowed to. Atrocities like this are not behind us though, as right now, in Darfur, over a million people have been driven from their homes and slaughtered by Janjaweed militia.

Also make sure to watch the DVD extras.  Paul Rusesabagina really to this day does not think he did anything out of the ordinary.  He just did what was right.
Another great lesson:  Subservience can be power.  A good loyal servant is owed some level of support.  Rusesabagina's loyal service to Sabena demands a level of support.  Support which is critical to the survival of those in the hotel.  Rusesabagina has more power than Nick Nolte's character as the leader of the U.N. military representatives.

2239161,5,B0007R4T3U,"Movie: *****  DVD Transfer: *****  Extras: *****

So very few films can be truthfully and accurately described with such lofty phrases as `heart-wrenching' or `transcendent'.  ""Hotel Rwanda"" is one of them.  It tells the true story of Paul Rusesabagina, the manager of a five-star hotel in Rwanda during the genocidal massacre of the minority Tutsis by the Hutus in the 1980's. Rusesabagina put his own life in jeopardy to play a complicated game of strategy in order to save his family and neighbors - and 1,200 strangers he sheltered in his hotel - from being brutally slaughtered, simply because he felt in his heart that it was the morally right thing to do.

The film's power comes primarily from two sources.  The first is the screenplay, which unfolds its story without unnecessary theatrics; the story it tells is dramatic and harrowing enough that artificial embellishment is not needed.  The second pillar of the film is Don Cheadle's amazing performance as the hotel manager.  Here is an example of screen acting at its most sublime.  Cheadle literally disappears into his character and plays it straighforward, from the heart; he is rarely off the screen, and never strikes a false note during the two hour running time.  He has one particular scene, played alone, in which his character reacts after-the-fact to an earlier crisis; without doubt, it is among the finest pieces of acting ever captured on film.  It is a testament to their abilities as performers (and Cheadle's generosity as an actor) that Sophie Okonedo, Nick Nolte, and Joaquin Phoenix are able to shine so brilliantly in their supporting roles; this is Cheadle's movie all the way, and he is magnificent.

The DVD transfer of this incredible film cannot be faulted.  The visuals are perfectly rendered and the soundtrack, which is so important to the film's emotional impact, is flawless.  The extras include two incredible documentaries, one about the making of the film, and the second about the return of the real Paul Rusesabagina to Rwanda for the first time since he and his family settled in Belgium.  There is also a very perceptive audio commentary track; as well as a limited, scene-specific commentary by Don Cheadle which is fascinating indeed.  In addition, the disk features the Original Theatrical Trailer for this film and half a dozen other M-G-M releases.  Captivating, astonishing, and both inspirational and horrifying, ""Hotel Rwanda"" is a movie that should - and richly deserves - to be seen.",1126915200,3,2494,5.02676399026764

2239164,5,B0007R4T3U,"""Hotel Rwanda"" isn't about entertainment, but rather about past mistakes and lessons that the International Community must learn from them. Unfortunately, the price of some mistakes is too high...

In the case of the Rwandan genocide, the price of non-intervention was a million Tutsi victims, murdered by Hutus in 1994, while the International Community did nothing even though the UN had troops there. As one Colonel of the UN's forces (Nick Nolte) in the film said, ""We are here as peacekeepers, not as peacemakers"". Foreigners who happened to be in Rwanda could leave the country, whereas the Tutsis were left to die. That was quite ironic, actually, if we take into account that the division of the people in Rwanda between Hutus and Tutsi wasn't natural, but rather imposed by their European colonisers.

Rwanda was, at the time these events happened, a place where unlikely heroes were all that was left. One of them was Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), assistant hotel manager of a four-stars hotel and Hutu. His wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo)was Tutsi, though, and his children were considered Tutsis too. ... When mayhem began and Paul was left in charge of the hotel, he stepped up and started to hide there other Tutsis that had nowhere to go. ""Hotel Rwanda"" allows viewers to understand how difficult it was for Paul Rusesabagina to stay alive, and protect the people he took under his wing in a time when many armed Hutus wanted to kill the ""cockroaches"" (as they called the Tutsis).

Watching this movie is quite striking, as it is based on a true story. Paul Rusesabagina exists, and he ultimately managed to save more than 1200 people from certain death, taking them to a safe haven. His arms were bribes, contacts, and calls he and the other ""guests"" of the hotel made to acquaintances living abroad, telling them what was happening (""We must shame them into sending help"").

You can learn about all that in this outstanding movie, directed by Terry George. Moreover, you can watch the real protagonists of this story in two of the DVD's bonus features, ""A Message for Peace: Making Hotel Rwanda"" and ""Return to Rwanda"", and know what really happened, in their own words.

All in all, I highly recommend this film. Too often, when we read about massacres like this in books, they seem abstract, something that doesn't necessarily affect us. That isn't true, but what is going to make us realize that?. ""Hotel Rwanda"" can do it, and I think that is a reason more than good enough  to watch this film.

2239170,4,B0007R4T3U,"Here is a moving tale of a single star in a very dark night.

The casting is excellent.  Don Cheadle speaks in a generic _patois afrique_, and convincingly develops from a rather  supercilious functionary and palm-greaser to a resourceful humanitarian. The biracial Briton Sophie Okonedo doesn't look especially African, but she is such an excellent actress that she soon overcomes any skepticism about her part as Paul's wife. Nick Nolte does a fine job as the UN commander who can offer nothing more than empty promises.  He fairly radiates a contemptible ineffectuality.  I was reminded of a passage about the atrocity from Kenneth Cain's _Emergency Sex_,

""The UN was here when the massacres started, twenty-five hundred troops. UN Headquarters in New York knew it was being planned, they had files and faxes and informants and they sat in their offices, consulted each other, and ate long lunches. Most UN forces ran to the airport, they couldn't get out fast enough. This is not a case in which the UN failed to send troops to stop genocide. An armed, predeployed UN force evacuated as soon as it started. All those signatures on the genocide Convention, dozens of rapturously celebrated human rights treaties, a mountain of documents at UNHQ on the subject of genocide, law professors all over the world making a living talking about this, and we _evacuated_. Tanks and supply planes and helicopters and soldiers sat useless and stationary for six months in Somalia, two hours away by C-130, and then drunk peasants armed with machetes and lists of names killed 800,000 civilians in Rwanda. And we evacuated.""

A very smart--not to mention respectful--move is to leave most of the carnage off-screen.  What glimpses we do get are all the more appalling.  Among the most memorable images of the film is the scene where the Europeans are being rescued from the hotel, while the trapped Tutsis are forced to remain.  The camera slowly pans down the length of the bus, through a rainshower.  The Europeans all stare at the Africans with a ""thank-god-it's-them-and-not-me"" look, except for one jerk snapping a photo.  The Africans, massed in the roundabout in front of the hotel, stare back, and then quietly file back inside.  There are many small but arresting quick visual hits, too; such as when rampaging Hutus whet their machetes on the pavement as they surge through the streets.  But possibly the creepiest scene is one where Paul, desperately playing his final card to save everyone, bribes a rogue general with a hidden stash of high-quality Scotch.  The general is very pleased, and reminisces between swigs about a trip he once took to a single-malt distillery in Scotland.  ""Wonderful country.  Wonderful golf. I wonder...will I ever go back?""

The film has been compared to Schindler's List, but cinematically it has more in common with The Killing Fields.  The lush tropical setting is in jarring counterpoint to the horrors being perpetrated.  Murderers swarm in when Westerners pull out. Radio forms a backing track for much of both films--in one scene Paul snaps it off in disgust, at hearing the White House press secretary grope for euphemisms about the genocide then underway.  And the final scene in the refugee camp plays almost exactly the same.  History repeats itself, indeed...

Of the special DVD features, the most interesting is the featurette of the real Paul Rusesabagina returning to Rwanda, visiting his hotel and, with survivors of the 1994 massacre, visiting the genocide memorial.  The sound in this section is badly muffled on my copy of the DVD; your mileage may vary.  There is a little speech by actor Don Cheadle in another bit on the need to do something about the situation in Darfur.  But I was sadly reminded of critic Mark Steyn's review of this movie, in which he suggested that we might be watching ""Hotel Darfur"" in ten years.

Terry George finally gets the fame he should have gotten with Some Mother's Son with this fact-based account of Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle, recently of Ocean's Eleven, Things Behind the Sun, and many other films), a Hutu hotel manager in Rwanda who sheltered over a thousand Tutsi refugees during the Hutu militia's crackdown, which claimed in the vicinity of a million lives in 1994. The movie is marked by a number of fine, understated minor performances, including small turns from Joaquin Phoenix and Jean Reno, as well as excellent work from Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo (as Rusesabagina's wife), and, somewhat surprisingly, Nick Nolte, whose career has really taken an upswing since Affliction.

Not that the movie doesn't have its flaws; I'd have liked to see a lot more development in Gregoire's character, given how important he becomes towards the end of the film, for example; but what's here is sterling. Cheadle plays Rusesabagina as a consummate businessman, the kind of guy who's going to try not to rock the boat for as long as humanly possible, the most reluctant of heroes. His character stays believable even when everything else about him has entered the realm of the ludicrous.

I've read books and articles on Liberia and Sudan, but those couldn't help but be distanced and removed from the horror.  This film forces the viewer to confront the horrific reality and visceral experience of the Hutus' brutal butchery of the Tutsis in recent Rwandan history.  Entire Tutsi families, women and small children, labeled ""cockroaches"" and brutally bayoneted and shot, left to rot in piles.  Horrific.

In the midst of this madness, Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), a mild-mannered hotel manager and Hutu, manages to save the lives of thousands of Tutsis, including his Tutsi wife and children, by hiding them in his five-star hotel.  He begins as the Everyman, primarily concerned with his own family and his job, but as the horror increases so do his sacrifices.  His bravery and ingenuity, facing down the gangsters and thugs constantly brandishing machine guns and threatening his life, make the viewer consider how far he would go if the known world collapsed into horror.

Frequently, people see altruism as a luxury of civilized societies, quickly evaporating into self-interest in the exigencies of anarchy.

2239179,5,B0007R4T3U,"I don't write many reviews, but I felt compelled to do so after seeing this film.

What a masterful job Terry George has done in portraying the horror of life in Rwanda in 1994. Several previous reviews complained that he did not do enough to show what was really going on, as if the dearth of blood and gore somehow made the moview less realistic.  I heartily disagree!

The brief glimpses into the genocide occuring make it unneccessary to bludgeon the viewer over the head with constant scenes of blood, because we already KNOW that it's happening. The intense dread is developed because Paul and people inside the hotel know that the noose is slowly drawing tighter, and that certainly sooner or later they will all have run out of options.

The most ordinary of scenes were hardest to watch-Paul having to tell his wife that she and the children must jump to their deaths rather than die at the hands of Hutu rebels and their machetes; watching a former business partner detachedly talk about how easy it will be to exterminate the rest of the Tutsi ""cockroaches"", unquestioning of why it should be done;and saddest of all, when Paul finally begins to lose his ability to try and stay detached after literally getting an in your face look at what is going on beyond the walls of the hotel.

Terry George is also very honest about the failures of the West to stop what was happening, and what the result is when you're not committed to stopping the atrocity unfolding before you. An earlier reviewer scoffed at the idea that forces were put on the ground in Rwanda but were unallowed to use their weapons-sadly this was in fact reality.

 The horrifying notion that it simply wasn't worth it for anyone to get involved is a shame that the rest of the world must bear, and seems to be a lesson we have to learn over and over again. As I watched this film I was struck not only by the obvious parallels between it and World War II, but also between this story and what had been taking place in Yugoslavia just a year or two earlier with similar results.

Don Cheadle easily should have won the Oscar for this portrayal--it was powerful because it was so understated. It would have very easy to overplay it and wring every last bit of pathos out of it but he didn't do it. It's stark and a little chilling until you realize that Paul was using every last bit of strength and wit he possesed to simply hold onto his composure and sanity for the sake of his family and the other 1200 refugees under his protection especially when the reality that they had been more or less abandoned by the rest of the world hit home.

A fantastic, though horribly sad film. People should also check out ""We Wish To Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families"" by Phillip Gouretevich for more first hand accounts of what went on in Rwanda and what was going on outside of it.

A side note to an earlier reviewer who used the space as a forum to spew his disgust over the UN and the ""liberals"" who love it so much--sorry fella, there's PLENTY of blame to go around, and it actually DOESN'T make what's going on in Iraq and Guantamano Bay okay.",1122854400,2,3142,4.448695652173913

2239181,5,B0007R4T3U,"In most of the reviews of the movie Hotel Rwanda the topics concern the quality of the movie and acting, how it is based on what really happened and how this shows what a tragedy this was. In general from those I have read so far the impression the movie has made on the reviewer is that western democracies should be ashamed of looking the other way during this crisis. I agree. But I also want to reflect on the cause of this tragedy. From my reading of ""Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed"" by Jared Diamond this kind of collapse results from factors that can be measured and predicted. If we can do that we ought to avoid letting such situations develop. Diamond's book discusses many factors that go into this and I suggest his book a very important read. (see for example on Page 163 ""... 750, possibly even 1,500, people per square mile. (For comparison, even today the two most densely populated countries in Africa, Rwanda and Burundi, have population densities of only about 750 and 540 people per square mile, respectively.) Hence the ancient ..."") What should we do to avoid future tragedies of this sort?

Interesting note: when the star of this movie made a first visit to the hotel and community depicted with his family he wondered why the people he spoke with kept staring at his children. When finally he asked a translator to find out why the answer was that they were so clean. They had never seen clean children before.

After the Katrina disaster along the Gulf Coast: it will certainly be worth considering what movies will be made of this and I hardly doubt that a major focus will be on the contrasts between the same character types as in this movie. The heroes will be held up in contrast to those who took advantage of others under the worst of circumstances.",1122681600,,1801,4.555555555555555
2239182,5,B0007R4T3U,"This is a powerful and moving film that tells the story of the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people through the attempts of one man to save a few from death by machete.  It is not an effort to tell the whole story of the Rwandan tragedy, nor is it an attempt to shove our faces into the horror of what happened in those months of 1994.  The protagonist is a simple hotel manager, a real person whose name is Paul Rusesabagina.  He is an intelligent and resourceful man working at a four star hotel in Kigali.  He knows how to use petty bribes to grease the wheels in order to get things done in this small and corrupt country.  He is a Hutu and a member of the majority, but his wife and therefore his children are Tutsis and are part of the resented minority.

The movie doesn't spend much time explaining the dynamics of this situation except to point out that these distinctions are purely arbitrary and were created by the Belgians.  There are rumblings on the radio and in the streets that a slaughter of the Tutsis is going to happen, but Paul does not believe them.  The events erupt when the President of Rwanda dies in a plane crash and the agitators blame it on Tutsi rebels.

Paul has no intention of saving anyone beyond his family when this all begins.  However, as it hits closer to home he makes noble choices and uses his skills in bluffing and bribery to keep his family and the ever growing band of refugees at the hotel alive.  It is poignant how these people are abandoned to the mobs by the West, but also significant how their private campaigns to their well connected friends in other countries buys them time.

And the difficulty of working with those in the killing machine outside is not all there is, there are also those Hutus on staff that resent the Tutsis and buy into the lies urging them to exterminate the cockroaches.  It is an awfully precarious situation that Paul is trying to keep from tipping into extinction.

The movie does show a few stark images without getting horribly graphic.  Don Cheadle gives a wonderful performance and deserves his Oscar nomination and probably should have one the award for this performance.

I think this is a movie that everyone should see and think about, especially with mature young people who need to know what happened not so long ago.  Then we need to think about what is going on right now in the Sudan and write our representatives about what we think should be done to help end that horror.  After all, that is really the point of this movie.  We can stay uninvolved because it happens so far away, but it sparks our conscience to ask us if we should.",1122595200,,2640,4.4625
2239183,5,B0007R4T3U,"There are many papers and commissions that examined what happened in the spring of 1994, when almost a million Rwandans were slaughtered by their own countrymen. Analysing these events makes us feel better, removes us from the emotions of such a tragedy. But it doesn't really matter what social-colonial or historical factors led up to it; it only matters that the genocide happened. Hotel Rwanda is an edge-of-your seat true account of the courage of one man in the midst of cowardice of many.

Accomplished actor Don Cheadle plays Paul Rusesabagina, assistant manager of a four-star Belgian hotel Des Mille Collines in the capital city of Kigali. Paul is Hutu. Hutus speak ominously on the radio of exterminating ""Tutsi cockroaches."" UN Peacekeepers in the country are helpless to intervene. All hell breaks loose and Paul's hotel becomes a makeshift refugee camp holding eight hundred terrified Tutsi. Only his quick-thinking is buying his family and the Tutsi moments to live - but for how long? Crazed Hutu hooligans as well as the Hutu army are shooting Tutsi and hacking them to death with crude machetes.

The movie is stellar on all counts. It strikes at your heart, gently takes your face, and makes you look in the mirror. As Wyclef Jean wrote in his closing song for the film, ""Million Voices,"" ""There's no money, no diamonds that can replace Rwanda.""",1122163200,2,1364,4.951965065502184

Fear of course. Never any panick. But then the survival instinct takes over, though it takes also some time to do so. Some will never be able to look for a solution and they will very passively remain in the hands of those they consider as possible saviours. Others will try all they can to find a way out, to stay alive, to survive but with their companions in this drastic situations. Family first, neighbours second, and then friends of friends. This is the spirit of the main character. Others still will be egotistic to the final end of the event and they will run into the fire and literally commit suicide. Finally others will try to resist and look for guns or a way to refuse to die in silence or shouting. If dying I must let me take a few enemies along with me. This last type is not really shown in any way. The rebels are not victims but fighters coming from outside and closing in on the militia. This film also shows drastically how little the international community cared for this particular genocide in Rwanda. The people on the ground (United Nations and Red Cross personnel) were helpless and absolutely abandoned in this mess. The international community seems to have waited for the massacre to be over. As the UN general says : they are blacks, not even (...), plain Africans. So no one cared and no one tried in any way to stop the massacre. As for an explanation the film provides none. We are absolutely alone in front of these images, situations, barbaric acts and we have to use our own heads to build some kind of hypothesis : heritage from Belgian colonialism, hatred between two communities, greed and jealousy of one to get what the other has, refusal to share, a sense of superiority, a desire to kill and enjoy real violence. Some might even say it is nothing but genetic. In such situations it is so easy to get racist or racial. The film remains rather reserved on the depth of such a catastrophe.

The focus point of the film revolves around real life hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina played by the wonderful Don Cheadle. Paul is put under a huge amount of stress when hundreds of Rwandans, namely those of the Tutsi tribe flock to his hotel for refuge. Instead of just putting together film from one point of view, writers Keir Pearson and Terry George wrote the film from all angles. Through out the film it is explained why the Hotu tribe has revolted against the Tutsis through radio broadcasts. It does not justify their actions but it certainly explained why their hatred for the Tutsi people. Don Cheadle as Paul Rusesabagina was absolutely amazing with his subtle performance as the protanganist of the film. Sophie Okonedo as Paul's wife Tatiana was equally wonderful. There were time during the film when I felt that I was watching a documentary than a film based on a true life event. My heart was breaking through out the film as the body count rose from the massacres and Paul's reaction to the deaths of the locals. I loved this film because it did not preach or blame anyone for the atrocities, not to mention being biased. It simply told what happened without sounding preachy. What Paul Rusesabagina did took a lot of courage for saving over a thousand people and despite the countless deaths, he managed to remain calm and collected although he was pushed near the edge at the time.

2239190,5,B0007R4T3U,"Hotel Rwanda is that rarest of movies - a film that proclaims without preaching.  Perhaps Don Cheadle is responsible for the measured pace of the film, but somehow Hotel Rwanda is able to illuminate without melodrama - which is an outstanding accomplishment given the subject.

I strongly disagree with other reviewers on the impact of the film.  I was fully prepared to see a hand-wringing ""oh why didn't the West do something"" portrayal of Euroamerican racism, superimposed upon an African tribal bloodletting.  And while the film most properly illustrated the inaction of the West (while noticably leaving out the names ""Clinton"" and ""Albright""), the movie came across more as an accurate portrayal than a partisan fluff piece.  Contrast this movie against the maudlin ""Salvador"" and you'll understand the difference.

Throughout, the acting was supurb, and the nuance was excellent.  For example, the film doesn't come out and hit you on the head, but the ""emulation of the West"" among the affluant Rwandans was quite clearly presented (hula-hoops, no less!).  This is a fantastic example of ""getting your point across"" that the nimrods in Hollywood would do well to emulate.

But all of this aside, the measure of the movie is in its impact, and Hotel Rwanda should stand among the greats in this regard.  It would be difficult to see this movie without understanding, at a primal level, the fear and horror of seeing your neighbors lying butchered in their yards, with all the normalcy of suburban life lying in tatters around them.  The numbing reality and scope of attempted genocide come through in Hotel Rwanda in a manner that is lacking in such trumpeted peaens as ""Schindler's List"".  The actors, directors, and producers of Hotel Rwanda should be praised for their brutal honesty, restraint, and courage in bringing such a film to life.

But ultimately, the most important thing about this film is that it is based on a true story.  Particulary for Westerners, and perhaps particularly for Americans, it is critical to understand the reality that much of the world lives with.  The divide betwen the majority of human history and the modern American middle/upper class world is immense.  The collapse of Rwandan civilization - the telephone call made from a Hotel-Under-Siege in Africa to a gleaming office in Belgium - these speak to the very thin line between peace and chaos.  A line that we would do well to demarcate and do well to defend.",1121385600,,2458,4.985294117647059
2239191,5,B0007R4T3U,"At the beginning of this film, we can see that hotelier Paul Rusesabagina has a respectable career, a loving family, and is not in any danger of being misclassified and persecuted as being the wrong race, i.e. a lighter skinned Tutsi.

But as the hatred increases and the Hutu majority takes over after the president has been assassinated, anyone harboring a Tutsi is ripe for extermination. The Hutu radio announcer even refers to the Tutsis as ""cockroaches"" which psychologically makes it easier to kill them. In fact, radios were the only form of mass communication and the Hutu majority gave people them in order to keep up with the latest news.

While Hotel Rwanda reveals the events of the genocide that occurred in the spring of 1994, it's really a moving testament to the compassion of one person, Mr. Rusesabagina. Just after he's ousted from his home along with his family and a few neighbors, he is given the opportunity to make good with the Hutu killers and free himself but have his loved ones shot. He then becomes consumed by good as he opts to buy their way to freedom, thanks to the money from the hotel safe, and also encourage those with money/jewelry to participate in freeing themselves from impending death. The intelligence, courage, and most of all, compassion that he exhibits only increases as his country and, unfortunately, many of his countrymen, disintegrate into violence around him.

Mr. Rusesabagina saves still more lives when refugees and orphans are allowed to remain in the Hotel Mille Collines during the days and nights of terror that erupted that April. Through persistence his carefully cultivated connections do come through for him and he ends up saving 1200+ lives as the U.N. drives them through the front line to the refugee camp.

This film is made even more meaningful by the fact that Don Cheadle, the accomplished actor who portrayed the spiritually evolved hotelier, personally delivered the DVD to me as part of Amazon's 10th Anniversary Special Delivery program.",1121299200,,2016,4.955621301775148

This is a movie that will make you question humanity, and how some people step up to the plate, answer the call and become reluctant heroes while others take lives, just for their own pure enjoyment.  That is what got to me more than anyting in this movie, the extinction of a culture was planned so much like what Hitler planned for the Jews.

This is that story, and I assure you is quite good.

The triumph of the film is that the actors - most notably leads Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo - humanize the recounting to the extent where it resonates with its audience on a personal level.  In contrast, stories where the audience is told ""and X thousand people were slaughtered"" tend to get marginalized.  It's maddening, but it's the reality.  Credit director George for recognizing this truth and latching on to a great way to relate the true extent of this tragedy.

My suggestion is to pair ""Hotel Rwanda"" with a viewing of HBO's harsher, more in-your-face ""Sometimes in April.""  Think of it as an inside-outside combination: in ""Rwanda,"" you're inside the Hotel Mille Coline (in capital city Kigali) looking out; in ""April,"" you're outside the hotel trying to get in.

I would hate to compare this film with ""Schindler's List"", but it's hard not to do so when the contextual basis for both stories are so similar, especially when the real hero in the story has been often referred to as the Oscar Schindler for Rwanda.  I feel though both the real historical events and resulting film on Oscar Schindler is far more interesting than that of Paul Ruisabagina in ""Hotel Rwanda"".  For one, Schindler preservere over 4 years in the face of the German nazis, and saved thousands of Jews, whereas Ruisabagina had only had to endure over a week, and was able save far less people.  That is of course not to say what the latter's done is anything short of heroic.

As a film, ""Hotel Rwanda"" also delivers short on the psychological complexities of its various characters, complexities that were painted so vividly in Spielberg's film.  I found many of the performances and character portrayals in ""Hotel"" to be based on not much more than stereotypes.  I'm speaking of very shallow stereotypical portrayals of what we'd think of when we think of Africa, like warlords, crazed and hateful tribal people, the tearful refugees, etc.  In short I thought the only person who had any real substance in the film was Don Cheadle.

When he speaks to the staff at the hotel about calling loved ones, you feel like he means what he says. When he cries from the dead bodies along the road, you feel his despair.  Although Jamie Foxx won an oscar for Ray, I think that Cheadle did a better job of making me connect with someone I had never heard of before.

Aside from Cheadle's acting, not much in the film stands out in my opinion. When people are getting slaughtered everywhere, I am confused as to what Nick Nolte is actually doing. He doesn't shoot anyone during the entire film, even when people are being killed around him. I'm not saying he should of killed someone, but it's hard to connect with someone who doesn't seem enthusiastic about helping. Don Cheadle's Wife in my opinion is flat out terrible. She isn't likeable at all. Moreso, she is always crying about something. She cries at the drop of a hat(cliche), and it just makes her appear weak and cowardly. Yes, tons of people are dying around her, but she doesn't have to bawl at every chance she gets. The other part of the movie I hated was the ending. The ending just feels rushed.

The movie shows all that this man who owned a large hotel went through to save his people. The town is divided between the Hutu and Tootsies. Cheadle's character is a Hutu but his family and most of his friends are Tootsies. When certain Tootsies kill a Hutu general, the Hutu go after the Tootsies trying to kill all of them. They succeed in many ways in this horryifying story. But, Cheadle's character takes all the Tootsies he can find and hides them in his hotel. This movie shows the atrocities that really occured and also shows how barely any other countries did anything to intervene. It shows even worse the racism in which the governments that help save the whites but just leave the black(tootsies) for dead. This is nevertheless a masterpiece that depicts an atrocity.

Same goes for the two British jounralists, who are so wooden as to be comical.  Check out the scene where the cameraman is suppose to be drunk while talking to Paul.  That's the way a kid in a high school drama would play a drunk.

2239199,5,B0007R4T3U,"I'd like to add my five-star vote for this intense and positive story -- it was simply too good not to acknowledge (although one has a right and a duty to be skeptical about journalism and about Hollywood these days). The movie relates the story of one man who elected to shelter over 1000 refugees during a time of great terror and abandonment.

I thought the film had three highlights:

--First, it showed the amazing contrast between the goodness of Paul Rusesabagina and the forces he opposed (both the rebels and the Europeans and U.N. who abandoned him to his fate). One memorable scene shows a photographer (who originally filmed the genocide) leaving town in the rain -- he seems more concerned about getting his hair or his camera wet than about what may soon happen to the Rwandans now sheltered in his hotel. The French, who helped arm the rebels and then apparently did not even lift a finger to stop their allies, come across as especially cowardly and despicable. The UN, whose local representative is played by Nick Nolte, seemed almost comically inept. As an aside, the events in an originally well-intentioned intervention (modern Iraq) shows the limits of any armed intervention in a similar situation, so it may actually be questionable just how much the UN, the US, or Europe could have accomplished by armed intervention.

--Second, the directors gave a good picture of how hatred can be easily inflamed and then get out of control, which benefits no one (even the rebel leaders, who first seemed pretty happy to be in control, eventually began to worry about war crimes prosecution and reprisals). The film mentioned that the Hutus and Tutsis had little apparent difference between them except their positions in the Belgian colonial system and the stamp in their passports).

--Finally, the film did a commendable job of showing that basic decency, moral courage, and honor can be present even in a time of great depravity, and this compassion and kindness can be so wonderful.  Even the hero first wanted just to protect his own family but came to realize that he could do more.

Hotel Rwanda is the story of an extraordinary man who  saved over one thousand Tutsi refugees in the 5-star Belgian hotel he managed. But more than that, it is a tale about how the racism and political agendas of the international community allowed for the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of innocent people. It is a story about how groups of people can be manipulated by the selfish interests of outsiders to hate and kill their neighbors.

Not only were the individual cast members fantastic in their roles, the collective energy and cohesion of the entire cast is really what made this movie so powerful. The reality of what happened to these people (most of the victims were killed by machete) is brutal and you will be horrified by some of what you see in this film. But instead of relying on lots of blood and gore to disturb the audience, the movie focuses on the characters' fear, desperation, and the feeling that there is no escape.

I saw this movie in the theatre, and I did not buy it so much because I want to watch it over and over again.

After I watched this movie, I felt sick, insensitive, and numb.

The cast and directors of Hotel Rwanda have done a marvelous work in drawing you into this conflict and portraying a scenario that begs you to care about a people and crisis working outside of your paradigm. Few of us, if any [reading this] have ever experienced anything like the sadly real genocide described in this film.

Hotel Rwanda demands your attention because:

- It is historic. What you see is a fairly accurate portrayal of what happened in Rwanda. Being the case, it hurts the heart to see the uncaring slaughter of hundreds of thousands and pricks the ear to the reality of death.

- It challenges your point of view. You are forced to come in contact with human nature in one of its darkest forms. The foundation of a philosophy that dictates the inherent goodness of man is rocked by the inhumane treatment of neighbors and coworkers.

- It slaps you in the face. The west too often views the outside world as something that is only marginally existent. We watch the news, we feel bad about what we see, and then we ""go back to eating dinner.""

Watch this movie. I can't describe how it made me feel - the lack of hope and truth of loss that is vicariously experienced. Use it as a catalyst to cause you to care for the world outside your backyard and to feel the burden of the worlds poorest spirits.",1118188800,6,1450,4.490494296577947
2239203,4,B0007R4T3U,"This film really reinforced my eternal optimistic observation that there are more good people in the world than bad.  Here was a man who used all his personal attributes, resources, and contacts to save a few hundred people from imminent death during a very volatile time in history in the country of Rwanda.  Paul Rusesabagina was (and is) a true hero in the most purest form.  A person of everyday life, not ALWAYS playing the hero, but becomes one when circumstances are brought cruelly and harshly into his immediate reality. This is a man I would love to add to my wishlist of people I would like to meet, if the circumstances were made available.

I like films that deal with human interest storylines.  The film works not because the screen is filled with special effects and visions of horror, but focuses on the relationship between two men under horrendous circumstances.  Don Cheadle's portrayal of Rusesabagina was seamless and subtle and I really could empathize with his character. The story was an amazing one, but the only negative that I would give on this film is that I thought the screenplay could have been more developed.  This tragedy affected 1 million people and I would have liked to see some more emphasis on that single point.

The one thing I took from the movie was how disconnected the world community was from the genocide that was occurring in this country.  This film also reinforced my disappointment with the media.  Ten years ago, atrocities were occurring in this country, but the events went virtually unnoticed by the rest of the world even in this age of 24 hour a day news reporting.  That said, I can't blame the ""media""  exclusively.  I am part of the ""world"" community and barely remembered or acknowledged the incident when it was happening.  If anything, it's made me pay more attention to world events and even if I can help in the littlest or easiest way (monetary donations) possible, then I will.

2239208,5,B0007R4T3U,"""Why are people so cruel""?

All one has to do is sit through Hotel Rwanda to arrive at the same question. As the rest of the world turned their back, Rwanda experienced a bloody civil war that over the course of three months left more than one million people dead and butchered.

Set in 1994, Hotel Rwanda is a rare exception to the rule: a message movie that doesn't feel like a message movie. Director and co-writer (with Keir Pearson) Terry George puts a human face on the tragedy through the presence of Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), Rwandan manager of the four-star Htel des Mille Collines, in Kigali.

As a Hutu, Rusesabagina moves about freely, using his status to corral favors. Even as a peace treaty between the Hutus and the Tutsi populations is forged, Rusesabagina is aware that a civil war can break out at any moment. To insure the safety of non-Nationals, the UN sends peacekeepers, led by Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte), to guard the hotel.

When the Hutu leader is killed in a suspected terrorist attack, rebels move through the streets, slaughtering Tutsi families. Incapable of doing anything, even when their men are killed, the peacekeepers do their best to protect the hotel, whose guest list has now swelled to include over one thousand Tutsi refugees.

Cheadle is excellent as Rusesabagina, a family man who turns to routine in order to survive chaos. As the civil war rages outside the hotel walls, Rusesabagina and his staff do their best to maintain the illusion of sanity. Simple routines become vines of hope, something to cling to when their world starts to crumble. Cheadle approaches Rusesabagina as a simple man of honor, unassuming and willing to sacrifice himself if it means saving his family and friends.

Avoiding propaganda, Hotel Rwanda explores the genocide with unflinching honesty. George never feels compelled to exploit the tragedy. Rusesabagina is presented as heroic but never saintly. He suffers through great moments of reflection, making honest but difficult decisions. Hotel Rwanda effectively allows the audience to undertake Rusesabagina's journey of self-awareness. The more he learns the more we learn. When Rusesabagina's eyes are finally wide open, we are appalled at what he sees.

As all hell breaks loose, Hotel Rwanda finds time to explore the human side of the conflict. The relationship and conversations Rusesabagina shares with his wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo) feel genuine. Okonedo is the films emotional rock, a woman who not only understands the severity of her situation, but is willing to make the ultimate sacrifice if it means her family's survival. Paul and Tatiana are soul mates, two people cut from the same cloth. When they share a Goodbye Girl moment on the rooftop of the hotel, we care about these two people so much we almost feel like intruders.

George creates images that are disturbing but unavoidable. It would have been easy to grab our hearts and minds with graphic images of slaughter, but George wants to educate rather than eviscerate. His efforts to avoid violence becomes a stronger statement than filling the screen with blood and guts. We see what we need to see, mostly in long shots, and in one absolutely chilling moment, becoming unwitting passengers down a body-lined road.

Nolte is powerful in one of the film's pivotal declarations, a truth met with stupefying disbelief. In just a few short words, Colonel Oliver lays it all on the line, and what he has to say will leave the audience equally stunned.",1117584000,3,3507,4.981196581196581

2239210,4,B0007R4T3U,"""Hotel Rwanda"" is a fairly absorbing movie about the massacre in Rwanda/Burundi in 1994.  Most of us have come to understand that the world stood by while genocide was taking place in this country.  However, at the same time, a massive military intervention ocurred in the Balkans over ""ethnic cleansing"".  There was a definite issue over whether or not American and European countries were willing to aid Europeans in trouble but not Africans in greater trouble.  It is an issue many people still struggle with.  Upon viewing ""Hotel Rwanda"" many will be inclined to agree that the world did not care enough about the fate of Black Africans to intervene in their behalf.  I'm not completely certain whether the movie suggests this because it is the truth or whether it is the true because the movie suggests it.  However, I have no problem with the movie's efforts to make a statement on the issue.

This is a very good movie about one man's heroic efforts to protect roughly 1200 people who otherwise would probably have been killed.  I understand that this is based on actual events and I am glad that this individual's bravery has been presented for the world to acknowledge.  I found the suspense, frustration and fear to be very well developed in ""Hotel Rwanda"".

My main issue with ""Hotel Rwanda"" is that I had to play back a number of scenes in the movie because I had no idea what had just been said.  I had to replay some scenes three or more times.  There is an accent of the actors that was difficult for me to easliy understand.  This may have been a issue unique to me and my mild hearing problem.  However, if I saw this movie in a theater without the ability to replay the various scenes, I may have had an even harder time understanding who represented what.  As it was there was a lot that was explained too briefly for me to always be sure what was going on, why, and how some people were related to others.  That may seem to some like I'm quibling over minor points and missing the big picture.  However, I felt that it inhibited me from being able to fully appreciate the big picture.

I thought Don Cheadle made a case for himself as a serious actor.  However, after the complaints I heard about his not receiving the recent Best Actor Oscar, I'm afraid I expected more that I got.

This is a very good movie and one I would readily encourage others to watch.  I did not think, however, that is is a ""great"" movie.",1117238400,2,2435,4.486363636363636

Millions of Rwanda natives were killed in this mass genocide.

2239212,5,B0007R4T3U,"One of the most intensive killing campaigns in human history was conducted in the tiny Central African country of Rwanda in 1994. The brutal ethnic conflict between the Tutsis and the Hutus, which exploded into mass murder that year, have origins which go back to Belgium's colonial rule, where the minority Tutsis were favored, thus exacerbating differences between the two tribes.

In April 1994, the plane carrying Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana was shot down. This event was the last straw which, after years of strife, triggered the tragic and brutal genocide. Extremist Hutu militia, aided by the Rwandan army, launched systematic massacres against Tutsis almost immediately after the plane crash. Despite reports of mass killings, most of the world turned a blind eye to the people of Rwanda. The UN failed to take immediate action to stop the bloody genocide, due to opposition from France and the US. Militiamen broke into supposedly sacrosanct Red Cross ambulances and hospitals searching for victims. Around 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed within 100 days, and over three million people fled to neighboring countries.

Terry George's ""Hotel Rwanda"" is a gritty, realistic depiction of this terrible tragedy. The storyline is based on the true life activities of a single, man whose goal was to save as many people as humanly possible. Don Cheadle plays Paul Rusesabagina, a Rwandan who formerly managed the Milles Collines, a Belgian-owned luxury hotel in the capital city of Kigali. When Hutu extremists begin to slaughter members of the minority Tutsi tribe, Rusesabagina returns to the hotel and does everything in his power to save his family, friends, then orphans, and ultimately strangers. He uses the 4 Star facility as a refuge for as many as the walls will hold, and then some. The film follows Rusesabagina, through his real life drama, as he wheels, deals, finagles and barters for seemingly every single human life he touches. A Huti married to a Tutsi, Paul qualifies as a target for both factions. His story is that of an ordinary man who rises-up, courageously, to defy death in the name of his fellow man. ""Paul Rusesabagina saved the lives of 1,268 Africans by standing with them at Hotel Rwanda.""

The almost nonstop fear, suspense and sense of anxiety which permeate this film are due, in part, to Mr. Cheadle's extraordinarily believable performance, and in part, because Director George so clearly conveys here the chilling reality of recent history. George, who co-wrote the script with Keir Pearson, was assisted in his work by the actual Paul Rusesabagina and by eye witnesses to the events.

The supporting cast is excellent and features: Sophie Okonedo, who gives an outstanding performance as Tatiana, Rusesabagina's wife; Joaquin Phoenix as Jack, an American news reporter; and Nick Nolte as the indefatigable UN Colonel Oliver, who tries against all odds to keep the peace.

Man's won't to commit genocide, in the 20th century alone, makes a somber, shameful statement about the human race. Watching ""Hotel Rwanda"" does take an emotional toll. It is a powerful, disturbing, educationally eye-opening experience. There are some extremely unsettling images, as when Rusesabagina and a co-worker get out of their vehicle on a foggy morning, just after dawn, to inspect the road for obstructions. They find it littered with corpses, as far as the eye can see. I found myself sobbing more than once. Do not let this deter you, however. This is a brilliant movie with some incredibly uplifting and inspiring moments. ""Hotel Rwanda"" is a must see film about a period in recent history when most of us were too busy going about our lives to pay much attention to what was going on a small world away.

2239213,5,B0007R4T3U,"""The Kite Runner"" may be the best book I have read in recent history, and without a doubt, ""Hotel Rwanda"" wins the corresponding prize for movies.  Unable to believe the senseless violence and slaughter of innocents, my eyes opened wider and wider as the movie progressed, until at some point, the tears could not be held back any longer.

Don Cheadle aces a career making role as Paul Rusesabagina, the quiet, understated hotel manager of a five star hotel in Kigali, Rwanda, who breaks every rule in the management book to protect not only the hotel guests, but refugees from both sides of the genocide that rocked Rwanda in 1994, while the rest of the world looked the other way.

A Hutu by birth and passport stamp, Paul is married to a Tutsi woman (Sophie Okonedo, whose voice changes drastically in octave as the role demands), and by this distinction, his children are also Tutsi, and therefore branded as cockroaches to be exterminated.

Because of his position and well-placed contacts, Rusesabagina is able to cling tenuously to his little safe house, putting up a brave front for the 1200 people he is sheltering from the Hutu tribal forces.  When he finds out that the UN peacekeepers cannot help them, and that the rest of the world doesn't want to know about African problems, he resorts to the local language, securing protection by whatever means necessary from the authorities, led by General Bizimungu, who has a weakness for Scottish water of life, foreign currency and self preservation.  Being only human, and in a crisis situation, he makes crucial errors in judgment, but by his conviction he manages to hold it all together for as long as necessary.

There are too many powerful scenes to describe, and you have to watch the movie to fully appreciate the horror.  There are no gory images as in ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Blade"", but the Director manages to effectively portray the despair and mass killings without being offensively graphic or crude.  One of the most heart rending scenes takes place on a road in the early morning fog, and this is the final straw that rips through Rusesabagina's brittle faade of being in control.

Joaquin Phoenix (you know I have to mention him), in a small role as a cameraman sums it up best when he said ""I've never been so ashamed.""

This one is a must see.

2239214,5,B0007R4T3U,"What can an ordinary Rwandan hotel manager possibly do?
Plenty, as it turns out. Paul is a Hutu, but his wife, Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo), is a Tutsi, and so, by default, are their children. He is driven by a primal need to save his own family, but as the slaughter continues, more and more friends and neighbors beg him for help.
By the end, Paul shelters 1,200 people in his hotel, saving them from certain death by doing what he always has done: bribing and cajoling the Hutu powers, calling in favors, lying and outsmarting his foes.
He is the Oskar Schindler of Rwanda, a man who becomes a hero by chance and circumstance, using qualities not generally considered heroic. He's no Rambo: He's scared, and conflicted, and full of doubts. Throughout the film, you can see he'd rather just save his family and not have to shoulder this burden of heroism.
Director Terry George (SOME MOTHER'S SON) knows not to get in the way of this harrowing story, which Rusesabagina himself insisted on telling straight, without movie-ish embellishment. It's all true and, given the context, remarkably subtle. (George earned the PG-13 rating by only suggesting the terrible violence, not showing it.)
Still, as the tension builds you can't help but feel you're watching the heir to a classic Western -- perhaps the ""High Noon"" of modern times, or SHANE -- as this one man steps up to save the town from the marauding bad guys. Of course, he doesn't save the entire town. As with SCHINDLER'S LIST, you're left with the grim knowledge that the people Rusesabagina saved were but a tiny percentage of those who were killed.

2239216,4,B0007R4T3U,"After seeing HOTEL RWANDA in a local theater a few months ago, I knew I had seen something powerful and memorable. But there is one little germ of doubt that persists in my mind about director and co-writer Terry George's approach to dealing with the tragic events that occurred in Rwanda in 1994. In telling the heroic story of hotel owner Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle)---an ordinary Hutu man who eventually ended up saving the lives of many Tutsis---I wonder if George perhaps took the easy way out. Let me explain.

George clearly has something to say with this film. Not only is he, like Rusesabagina, horrified by the genocide that was allowed to Tutsis in Rwanda; he is also disturbed by what he sees as American reluctance to seriously intervene in a situation that simply screams of human rights violations. It is an anger that infuses much of HOTEL RWANDA; it is what gives the movie much of its emotional punch. I wonder, though, if George fundamentally miscalculated by telling Rusesabagina's story and trying to make an uplifting movie, rather than telling another, more tragic story. It seems a bit too easy to tell yet another crowd-pleasing ""triumph of the human spirit"" story when such a massive tragedy perhaps cries out for a rawer approach. Perhaps the anguish at the heart of George's film might have been much more powerful, both emotionally and intellectually, if he had told a sadder, more humbling story that---for lack of more eloquent terms---really rubbed your face in the madness that overtook Rwanda in 1994, and the agonizing indifference of foreign troops to this massive human tragedy (an indifference that, some might argue, we are witnessing once again with many foreign nations' reluctance to directly intervene in the Darfur situation today). In short, I think HOTEL RWANDA suffers just a little bit from what I can only attribute to Terry George's divided intentions: he wants to tell an uplifting, ""triumph of the human spirit"" story---one that echoes Oskar Schindler's heroism in Steven Spielberg's SCHINDLER'S LIST---but also wants to ask serious questions about whether we did enough to prevent the Rwandan genocide from getting out of control. And, by doing the former, he perhaps stunts the latter, to some extent.

Still, George does tell a powerful story in HOTEL RWANDA, and the film, as a whole, is undeniably compelling and moving. The fact that the film raises such relevant issues at all is to be admired.

And Don Cheadle is to be admired, too. The character of Paul Rusesabagina is, almost unbelievably, Cheadle's first lead role, and he comes through with an amazing performance. The desperation Rusesabagina feels as he tries to negotiate for the lives of the Tutsi refugees (including his Tutsi wife, played by Sophie Okenedo), the horror he feels when he sees a street littered with corpses---all this comes through authentically in Cheadle's performance. In fact, I think Cheadle may have come up with the most viscerally powerful scene from the movies last year. It comes right after he sees that corpse-strewn street. Paul is back at his hotel, in his room. He tries to tie his tie, but he is so unnerved by what he has just seen that he never seems able to get it right. Finally, emotion so overtakes him that he throws down his tie in anger and breaks down right next to his bedroom door. The sheer raw emotion of Cheadle's wordless action in that scene is something that I certainly have not forgotten since seeing it; if Jamie Foxx had not so awed people with his interpretation of Ray Charles in RAY, Cheadle might have copped a well-deserved Oscar on that scene alone. (As impressive as Foxx undoubtedly was in RAY, not even he, in one of the final scenes set at a drug rehab center, came up with something as powerful---and as real---as Cheadle's quiet explosion in HOTEL RWANDA.)

Despite my reservation about Terry George's rather timid (and occasionally heavy-handed) approach to dealing with the Rwandan genocide, HOTEL RWANDA is worth seeing not only for the troubling issues it raises, but also for Cheadle's great lead performance.

2239217,4,B0007R4T3U,"Movies like this leave my mind reeling with questions.

Not just the usual ones brought on by the horror of mankind's actions, those questions made pointedly by bodies on the road as far as he can see, speedbumps on a 'cleared road' (cleared of the living). How could anyone do this, to be so consumed by hatred or anger that the normal restraints are completely absent.

Or the big questions like what makes people so different in their response to horror that some risk their lives repeatedly to help while others give in to what looks like mass hysteria and hack up their neighbors? And of course the personalization of that question in: given the same situation how would i react?

We have seen the main pieces over and over again since the British concentration camps for the Boer women and children in 1899, the Armenia genocide with its thousands perishing in the desert or lost in harem sexual exploitation for a lifetime. The destruction of Yugoslavia in an orgasm of violence, rape hotels and the eventual partitioning of history and geography back 50 years. It has happened so many times, in so many places that we get emotional callisus over our hearts to protect us from the immediate horror of it all. But the survivors, they will never heal, will never have the luxury of developing a hard heart to the evils of mankind. They will never close their eyes without reliving the nightmare.

But after all these questions have settled down to a dull aching roar, i am left with the idea that to honor, to remember these dead is to strive to keep it from happening again. To understand how such things erupt in our midst, to think about the warning signs and to struggle to push the powers that rule to build strike forces or international police forces or what ever it takes so that this evil leaves our midst forever. The radio in the background, urging violence, dehumanizing the other into cockroaches, making great divisions where there were little to none before (nose width???) certainly is significant. Mob violence, herd mentality explains part, but what about that man on the radio, or more importantly the few leaders behind the masks of evil, who are they and how did society create them. And more importantly, how do we keep trash thought from rising to the surface of society and causing this? I see the same kind of racism, the same kind of demonization of others, of the cockroachizition decline of dialogue into nothing more than utter polarization and namecalling around me.

As a Christian i worry that the Church which is to be the warning voice against hidden evil, to be that prophetic voice that is heard over the screams of victims and the shouted commands of the evildoers does not seem to be awake and watching over the walls of our civilization as it ought to be. I am glad to see churches looked upon as places of refuge and doubly horrified when that refuge turns into a cemetary when no one cares from outside, and God Himself doesn't seem to intervene to protect the innocent within the walls of His house of worship. The glib answer that they are in heaven today waiting their confrontation with their killers seems little comfort, i wonder how the survivors handle what looks like betrayal not just by their countrymen but from their God to whom they prayed in their last hours of absolute madness. Can we who only have read books or seen movies understand this? No, their stories of faith after the storm are hidden, at least from my view. The stories of faith need to be heard and motivate other Christians to help. but it seems that the rich American church is not just silent but deaf and blind as well.

That brings up the complicity of the West, not just in the remnants of a colonization that drew national boundaries that divided tribal loyalities, that created Hutu and Tutsi, that left an economy based more on exploitation of natural resources for the use of the west and the personal wealth of a few indigenous military and/or political rulers in control, then any democratic sharing for the use of all citizens. More than a failure of nerve, of a long lasting deeply embedded racism that divides black from white nuns and saves only the european from the horror. But of a legacy of mentality, or a worldview of exploitation, of the use of others for your own personal gain. For this is the great intellectual evil leftover from colonization, now the colonizers are black and speak the same language and act just like the British or Belgium or French or ? that left, for when the west left Africa it left behind ideas and a nucleus of people that pursued policies that created the conditions ripe for exploitation by demogues intent on becoming the next wave of internal colonizers, the wolves feeding upon the fatten calf for themselves.

i am sorry. but even if i were to speak out for the unnumbered dead, there appears to be no one listening to their cries at the moment of their deaths, why should my voice matter, when compared to their sacrifice? besides it appears that only God hears their cries.

2239221,5,B0007R4T3U,"In 1994 one of the most brutal acts of civil war occurred in Rwanda, Africa.  It was genocide on the most horrific scale of our lifetimes, rivaled only by Hitler's regime in the 1930's.  Hotel Rwanda is the true story of one man, hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina, who managed to harbor 1,268 refugees inside the upscale hotel he managed until he could find a way to bring them all to safety behind the Tutsi rebel lines.

Though a peace treaty between the Hutu's and the Tutsi's was signed by the Rwandan President, only hours later the president was assassinated and the militia were given the signal to begin killing the ""Tutsi cockroaches"" that had once enslaved the Hutu's.

Hotel Rwanda is a 10 star movie, it left me breathless with its beautiful portrayal of bravery and courage, and crying from the brutality of a genocidal regime.  Not since Shindler's List have I seen a movie with this much power and courage, enough to make even this cold-hearted reviewer break down and cry like a baby.  When one single, everyday person shows this much valor and heroism in the face of utter hopelessness, it makes me believe in the human race again.

Although there is not much overt blood in this movie, there are scenes of violence so horrific that you will cringe in your chair and set aside your cup of hot chocolate.  Hotel Rwanda is a tale of faith, hope, love, bravery, courage, violence, callousness, atrocities, and the shame of humanity.  Only UN General Romeo Dallaire (renamed Coronal Oliver for the movie, and expertly played by Nick Nolte) stayed behind when all other industrialized nations fled the country and left over one million people to be butchered in the genocide.

The cast in Hotel Rwanda was incredible, with stellar performances by Don Cheadle playing Paul Rusesabagina, Sophie Okonedo playing Tatiana Rusesabagina, Desmond Dube playing Dube, Fana Mokoena playing General Bizimungu, and Joaquin Phoenix playing reporter Jack Daglish.

If there is one movie that everyone should see, it is this one.  There are simply not enough good things to say about this movie and how incredibly moving it is, you will just have to sit down and watch it for yourself.  I wound out buying it the same day I rented it, and have watched it over and over, my mouth still dropping open in amazement at how people can be both cruel and kind.  Buy this one.

Also, I strongly recommend picking up a copy of 'Shake Hands With The Devil', the real account of Rwanda written by Romeo Dallaire, the UN General that stayed behind during the war.

Enjoy!",1115856000,3,2553,4.755102040816326
2239222,5,B0007R4T3U,"It is unbeliveably good and moving. I'm not gonna go into details since we know what the f*#$ happened. It's another ""Schindler's List"", but scary thing is it happened in our time. I'm a man, from Asia, and there are hardly any movies that made me cry, but this movie I was ""this"" close to cry to be honest with you. There were moments that tears filled my eyes, and I was also so mad at us as human beings. It is just impossible to imagine we can still kill each other off just because they were from different tribe. Oh, come on. We're the people of the 21st century, and we're still this stupid and that dumb? The actors did their best and they were terrific. By the way, if Jammie Fox wasn't there with his ""Ray"" at the Oscars Don Cheadle would've won with no doubt. I'll definetely buy this movie to show it to my kids when they are old enough that they can learn how we humans can make dumbe and cruel things. Don Cheadle you're my man.

2239223,5,B0007R4T3U,"The thought of almost a million people killed over a 100-day period is beyond imagination, but that is exactly what happened a mere ten years ago in Rwanda when the dominant Hutu tribe slaughtered the minority Tutsi tribe in a civil war that drew little media attention, and much worse, minimal help from the United Nations peacekeeping forces. The killings were the most brutal possible, as the Tutsis were murdered one person at a time. Just like Oskar Schindler, Paul Rusesabagina is the unlikeliest of heroes, as this soft-spoken family man and savvy negotiator is put to the test in the posh Htel des Milles Collines, which he manages in the capital city of Kigali. Against absurd odds, he is able to provide refuge for nearly 1,300 Tutsis and consequently saved their lives. Written by Kier Pearson and Terry George, this remarkable story has been directed powerfully by George, who makes the wise decision to focus on the plight of Rusesabagina and his family rather than take a more epic approach to what would have been too overwhelming to view in full force. Their situation is compelling enough given that Paul is a Hutu and his wife is a Tutsi. Consequently, there is less emphasis on the actual killings and the political leaders involved, though enough is shown to leave a lasting impression. The prospect of death always feels imminent as the story whittles away all the parties who could have helped the Tutsis but chose not to.

Generally a dependable supporting player in grade-A Hollywood pictures, Don Cheadle is an inspired choice to play this reluctant hero, as the actor economically portrays a man used to making deals to get what he needs for the hotel and then uses this skill in response to the shocking events to pacify the Hutu general in charge. In fact, most of the film consists of his increasingly desperate negotiations as the stakes continue to climb, including making a devastating choice to stay at the war-torn hotel while pushing his family onto a truck that could mean their escape. Cheadle plays these key scenes with minimum fuss and makes them all the more emotionally resonant, in particular, when he has a delayed reaction to seeing corpses strewn on a fog-blanketed road and weeps uncontrollably as he is dressing to bargain yet again. Matching him every step of the way is the superb Sophie Okonedo, who transforms the standard wife-and-mother role of Tatiana into something quite transcendent. Effective in much smaller roles are Nick Nolte as Colonel Oliver, the commander of the U.N. peacekeeping force; Joaquin Phoenix as a cynical photojournalist; Cara Seymour as a compassionate Red Cross worker; and Hakeem Kae-Kazim as the wily Hutu general George Rutanganda.

The DVD has two excellent documentaries. The first is ""A Message for Peace: Making Hotel Rwanda"", one of the better making-of featurettes given the participation of the real Paul Rusesabagina, who reasons that the lack of global, specifically American, support in 1994 for the Tutsis had to do with the devastating U.S. losses suffered in Somalia and the fact that Rwanda has no bargaining chip of economic value, i.e., no oil, no natural resources other than coffee and tea. The second, ""Return to Rwanda"", movingly follows Paul and Tatiana Rusesabagina back to their native land after living years in exile in Belgium. He even participates in the audio commentary along with George and singer Wyclef Jean. Strongly recommended, in fact, essential viewing of a reenactment of a massive genocide swept under the rug by the Western media.",1115769600,3,3553,5.0
2239224,5,B0007R4T3U,"If your tired of over-dramatic ""true stories"" don't let that sway you from watching Hotel Rwanda. Hotel Rwanada is neither over-overdramtic or exagerated and what you are left with is a surreal but truthful kick to the heart that will leave you thinking ""Wow, I really don't have it that bad""

Don Cheadle was supurb and truely represented  Paul Ruseasabagina with dignity and honesty. The film is an utter masterpiece and is packed with suspense and sadness (not in a good sense, but representing the feelings that were happening at the time)

The movie is a real ""eye opener"". It will probably make you want to investigate Sudan, where similar autrocities are happening as I type this. It will make you question humanity, and view humans no greater than a drunken dingo. It makes Titanic look like a disney movie and in fact, you probably won't care about the people who died on the titanic at all when you finish hotel rwanda.

The fact that this is a recent event happening little more than a decade ago brings a sort of sickness to your stomach. You realize that you were probably at school, or a child eating ice cream cones when 1 million men woman and children where gunned down and hacked up with michettes in rwanada in a 3 month period.

As for the film itself. The acting was supurb, the atmosphere was intense, the fear was lingering and the imagery was tremendous. I think however, Hotel Rwanda is more than a movie, way more, way way more. Its a true story... and the film itself is worth as much as the paper history books are printed on.

I feel that if anybody doesnt watch this movie they would be disrespecting all those who died needlessly in 1994. as said in the movie by the Canadian luitenant working for the UN ""nobody in the West gives a S**T about african N***rs"". I think its about time people start to understand what happened.

Watch it you will not be disapointed.",1115769600,3,1895,4.555882352941176
2239225,5,B0007R4T3U,"""Hotel Rwanda"", starring Don Cheadle (""Traffic""), is a highly emotional true story of horrific events that occurred in 1994 in Kigali, Rwanda.  There was a clash between the races Hutus and Tutsis.  Many militant members of the Hutus killed about one million Tutsis that year.  This is one of the worst genocides in recent African history.  This film desplists the heroism of Paul Rusesabagina, an assistant hotel manager, who saved more than 1,200 people during the massacre.  Despite the film's main theme as the heroism, there are other storylines that correspond one another to expand the film meaning.  This tells the story of Paul's determination, his love for his family, the people's turmoil, and the peacekeeper's struggle to maintain their heroism.

These stories offer new reference to this underreported event.  Few Americans have heard of this event until this film was released.  ""Hotel Rwanda"" shares these events without it seeming too factual.  These stories fit amongst one another beautifully, sharing a broader perspective of the events and the motives.  The writers obviously didn't hold back on the strong, graphic details.  Those desplictions were necessary to offer audiences a glimpse as they were actually living it.  Without them, the emotional impact wouldn't have been nearly as strong.  Such scenes include acts of brutal murder, abandoned dead bodies lying on the ground, and other acts of graphic violence.

This strong, emotional film is wonderfully expressed through the actors in their equally emotional roles.  Though everybody offers their full potential talents, Oscar nominees Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo stand out.  Cheadle portrays Paul as a compassionate man who knows what he must do.  This previously underrated actor finally received the recognition he deserves with his talent.  Okonedo portrays Paul's wife beautifully.  She expresses her character wonderfully as a family woman and as a victim.  The two actors never lose the turmoil emotion.

Such high film quality makes ""Hotel Rwanda"" worth seeing.  There will not be a dry eye once the film ends.  This film makes a great educational speech for learning about racism and hatred.",1115769600,2,2183,5.315789473684211

After the Holocaust everyone said they would never forget. When I learned about the Holocaust in school I never thought genocide would occur in my life time.

2239229,5,B0007R4T3U,"Don Cheadle plays Paul Rusesabagina, a Rwandan Hutu and manager of the luxurious Mille Collines hotel.  The film is efficient in its story-telling and we are told early that there has been tension ever since the Belgians left because when the Belgian colonists first came to Rwanda they arbitrarily divided up the native Africans into the more elegant and fair-skinned Tutsis and the darker, broader-nosed Hutus.  The Belgians gave a measure of power to the small amount of Tutsi's, and after Belgium leaves the tensions escalate.

Rusesabagina is a Hutu, married to a Tutsi (in a wonderful performance by Sophie Okonedo).  A peace agreement is quickly ignored, the Rwandan President's plane is shot from the sky, and the Hutu's are driven by voices of hatred to ""Cut the Tall Trees"" - a chilling phrase we are told early on is a ""signal"" for Hutus to murder Tutsis.

Rusesabagina opens the doors of the Mille Collines to everyone, most significantly to terrified and hiding Tutsis.  Don Cheadle is the heart and soul of this movie, and we are amazed as we watch him save 1,200 lives by bribing, pleading, outsmarting and standing up to the murderous forces that come to the Mille Collines.  There are several astonishing scenes where Paul essentially shames white Europeans and his Rwandan staff into ""doing the right thing"".  At one point he is quite certain that the hotel is about to be over-run and everyone inside murdered.  He is incredibly calm as he phones the Belgian headquarters of his hotel company (a brief, but effective cameo by the wonderful Jean Reno) and thanks the company for what they have done, then informs him that they are about to all be killed.

Nick Nolte brings the right combination of fear and fearlessness to the role of the Canadian Colonel representing the United Nations, leading a tiny force of UN ""peacekeepers, not peacemakers"" - he and his troops have their hands tied.

This film effectively displays the irrationality of hate crimes and genocide.  The accompanying documentaries are enlightening showing the real Paul Rusesabagina, and we get a sense that the heroism shown in the movie is no exaggeration.  We are also chillingly reminded that genocide is ongoing in Africa (at present in the Congo and Sudan).  The challenge is plainly issued for the world to step up.",1115164800,9,2312,4.910025706940874

this shocking yet amazing tale of paul rusesabagina's courage is uttertly astonishing. Although i was disgusted by the UN's lack of intervetntion i was astounded by one ordinary hotel managers bravery.

This is the sort of film that people need to see. people often like to try to ignore things that are going around us and pretend that they are not happening, but this is reality and the fact is that genocides such as this did take place. after watching this film you find yourself thankful for the civilised societies we live in and if you live in the western world you will certainly not take it for granted.

Terry George's film is a piece with other recent depictions of modern atrocity, ""Schindler's List"" and ""The Killing Fields"" come to mind.  In my mind, George depicts these horrors more subtlely but no less powerfully.  A shot of a bloodied machete, sounds of random gunshots, and tracer bullets racing across the sky effectively convey the madness that enveloped Rwanda.  Cheadle's portrayal of a successful hotel manager who finds himself caught up in the chaos and finds the inner reserve to achieve great acts of human courage is nothing short of a marvel.

This movie should make all who see it feel that if they could be half as courageous as Paul (Cheadle's character), the world would be such a better place.  Unfortunately, it seems that courage and heroism are born out of necessity and proximity in this world, never just out of a universal morality.

Cheadle's character, Paul (sp. last name) is a shining example of what human's are capable of doing, and of how brave we are capable of being.

2239234,5,B0007R4T3U,"Hotel Rwanda is a movie that is emotional and moving, displaying how one hotel manager has a human heart in saving many others' lives when UN abandoned the country to permit violence occurring in Rwanda.

I agree to the other reviewers of the movie regarding the current phenomenon of our society, lacking concerns about the violence happened outside of their own countries.  We read the newspapers we watch TV news.  We have dinner and these violence displays in front of our eyes.  Yet, we keep on eating our dinner and says, ""It is too bad things happened.  It is sad."" And then we keep moving on with our lives, hoping someone else will take charge of it.

I find it ironic with the emotionless expression our TV reporters in the news.  We human beings hope some powerful world leaders (like the President of the United States) would have intervened such cruelty for human justice yet, nothing was done.  It is often when violence hit home, can we truly relate how devastating people's life situations are.  It is only incidents such as 911 hits home hard that wakes Americans up, learning and realizing how painful an episode is when violence hit their home country.  Yet, these tragedies happened in other societies in a consistent basis.  It is a shame that the governments continue pursuing their own foreign interest by invading Iraq, claiming, and lumping the war with Iraq as the war of terror creating more excuses for wars, more violence than creating world peace.

We hear suicide bombings in the Israel.  We hear violence between the tribes in many of the African countries.  We hear the war of terror and we hear the war with Iraq.  We hear violence all over the world.  However, people who live in the United States of America shut their ears up and not hearing how painful lives are in other countries.  People are so self-absorbed about their little own life issues (such as getting the next higher paid jobs, nicer cars, finer food, bigger houses...) while somebody who lives somewhere else is looking for ways to survive, looking for places to shelter themselves and their children.

I questioned, ""How can people have so much hatred towards each other?  Is it necessary?  Why can't we find peace?  Why do we have to fight?  Why do we have to win at the expense of others' lives, sometimes the innocence's lives?""  If world peace is my quest, many Americans' quest, how come the leaders, politicians of the most supposedly democratic country, United States of America, have done nothing?  Americans vote these individuals to become the leaders of this society.  Americans vote these individuals to represent, carry out Americans' decisions, dreams.  Is this a sign that the democratic system failed in the modern American society?  How come President George W. Bush never listen many of the Americans who are against the war in Iraq, which ultimately creates only more violence and tragedies?  How come the American government spends billions of dollars funding the war in Iraq, while maybe a fraction of this money can be spent on world peace, creating a better world for humanity?  A fraction of the cost of the war in Iraq could have spent in stopping violence similar to the massacre of Rwanda.  Yet, the average Joe of the American society has no power to vote the between the options of world peace versus creating violence in other countries.

How come the leaders of the super-power countries are so self-absorbed, self-aloof, allowing, permitting such cruelty and violence happening to some other people, yet pouring resources funding more violence, expensing more young Americans' lives in a war with Iraq?  Here are the many questions I could never understand nor I feel I have control around answering these questions.  Maybe I am being overly critical to the current American government, the current democratic system.  Maybe the American government has done the best they can to run this country and to keep world peace.  But if the government have done the best they can, why we still hear soldiers and civilians dying in Iraq?  If the government is trying hard to keep world peace, why did they delude the society that was a war of terror while they could not find any solid evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq?  If the government is trying hard to keep world peace, why did they jump into a hasty decision going to war in Iraq?

Only if there are more awareness and effort put in world peace, educating people the importance of choosing peace versus violence, can we find the world a better place to live.  Only when human beings start putting more importance around world peace versus funding the inadequate self-interest of some politicians have, can this world be a safer place to live.  Only when we all have this sense of awareness and put world peace as a priority, can we prevent violence happened in Rwanda to re-appear in other countries.",1114992000,2,4897,4.824940047961631
2239235,5,B0007R4T3U,"This film tells of a disturbing, shameful, and tragic episode in Rwandan history, a story that was shaped by the colonial racial politics of its former Belgian masters. In 1994, the African republic of Rwanda descended into civil war. The Hutu majority, inflamed by the political rhetoric of guerilla radio, rose up against the Tutsi minority. This tribal warfare led to mass murder, with neighbor against neighbor, and would eventually see nearly a million Rwandans killed.

During this time of great turmoil, fear, and slaughter, an oasis existed in the capital city of Kigali. That oasis was the Belgian owned luxury hotel, Milles Collines. There, its native manager, Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), a member of the Hutu majority, would find himself in the role of  shepherd with a flock of refugees on his hands, which would include his own wife, Tatiana (Sophie Okenedo), a member of the Tutsi minority, and their children.

After the non-native guests and non-native refugees were evacuated to safety, Rusesabagina was left with the daunting task of taking care of nearly twelve hundred native guests and refugees, many of which were the hunted Tutsis, which just outside the gates of the hotel were being indiscriminately massacred, butchered with machetes or shot execution style at point blank range. Extermination of the Tutsi minority was the agenda of the day, and none, including children, were to be spared.

While a handful of United Nations peacekeepers were at the gates of the hotel, their presence was only for show, as their orders were not to shoot. One of them (Nick Nolte) finally told Rusesabagina, who was hoping for help from the outside world, that not a single country was going to lift a finger to help them, and he brutally told him exactly why. So, Rusesabagina was left with having to maneuver around the corrupt Hutu militia, getting supplies and whatever protection that he could, to ensure survival. Situational ethics was the order of the day, as Rusesabagina bribed, wheedled, and did everything he could to ensure that those in his care would survive and outlast the madness and carnage that  was going on all around them.

This is a brilliant film, deftly directed by Terry George, who keeps the carnage and gore to a minimum. Yet, he manages with just a few well-placed scenes to convey a sense of the overwhelming magnitude of the genocide that took place, while the entire world watched and did nothing.  Don Cheadle gives an amazing performance, low-keyed, controlled; yet, nonetheless, deeply moving.  Were it not for the extraordinary performance of Jamie Foxx in ""Ray"", there is little doubt that Don Cheadle, who, along with Foxx, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor, would have won. The rest of the supporting cast also give stellar performances.

I offer you the Hotel Rwanda. It would be hard to even imagine armed military personnel on the streets of America, but this kind of thing happens nearly everywhere else on planet. War breeds ruthless men and then turns them loose on civilized people who have no means to protect themselves.

Don Cheadle plays the Westernized manager of a Rwandan Hotel. People are being hack up  on the streets with machetes and Cheadle's hotel staff with not perform their duties without official word from their former conquers--The Belgium Government. Then United Nation ""Peace-Keepers"" are impotent as rivers of blood fill the street--children are not spared. They too feel the steel blade.

Worse yet, the West, who went all the way to Iraq to liberate the Iraqis, know about the slaughter and refuse to lift a finger to stop it. Shades of the Nazi extermination of the Jews. Just as the West knew about that shameful bit of history, and did nothing, they knew about this too, and did the same.

It also extends past those 100+ days to the trials and village tribunals years later.  SOMETIMES IN APRIL is a much more comprehensive look at the horror of that time.

What makes this film so remarkable, and powerful, is that it takes the ""whole"" story and distills it down to human scale. It gives us people we can relate to and a story we can manage. It becomes the story not of the Rwandan genocide, but of how that atrocity affected real people and how, even in the midst of such horror, love and courage and compassion -- and yes, even occasional humor! -- found a way to survive.

But the most affecting and frightening thing about the movie is that, as the reporter notes, we watch it and say ""How horrible,"" and then go about our dinner.  I wish there were better answers to the questions raised about what we could -- or should -- do in these times.

2239241,5,B0007R4T3U,"When I first heard about Rwanda and the massacres in the spring of 1994, I wanted to do something about it and was horrified that America wouldn't get involved, mostly because of our bad experience in Somalia just 6 months earlier as well as still deep-rooted racism that is apparent in our media and military actions (the recent Tsunami disaster another example). Shamefully, our country (as well as Europe) views the problems of Africa and most of Asia (beyond the Middle East) as not worth much to sacrifice our lives. Because we ignored the problem and allowed the massacre of nearly a million lives, it is important to have books and movies speak out about this crisis. For that reason, I am grateful that this film was made.

Though the similarities to ""Schindler's List"" are apparent (like Oskar Schindler, who saved 1200 Jews from the Holocaust, Paul Rusesibagina, a Manager of the Hotel Milles Collines in Kigali, Rwanda, managed to save 1200 Rwandans--the Tutsi minority--from being slaughtered). Paul used whatever cunning and lies he could to save his people at every little setback...which included bribery, booze, desperate calls to the Hotel chain's European financial backers, and outright lies to the Hutu General about his being on the U.S. hitlist for war crimes. This film shows that in desperate situations, situational ethics applies, as a strict moralist would likely end up dead. Using personal relationship with thugs to save lives is a lot better than any sanctimonial denouncement of the thug's behavior.

Don Cheadle is amazing in this film, as he nails the accent perfectly. The scene where he breaks down and cries after having seen the devastation of the massacre with his own eyes is heartbreaking to watch. If not for Jamie Foxx's phenomenal performance as Ray Charles, I think Don Cheadle would have deserved the Best Actor Oscar this year.

The song ""Million Voices"" by Wyclef Jean is a hauntingly beautiful tribute to Rwanda, as it encorporates a children's choir and relevant lyrics about the human disaster that remains part of Rwanda's historical legacy. After the Holocaust, many people vowed, ""Never Again!"" would they allow such genocide to take place...yet as we have seen from history, it happened in the Soviet Gulags, on the killing fields of Cambodia, in Bosnia-Hercegovina, in Rwanda, and now in Sudan. Films like these are important to bring about awareness, but in the end, its really a calling to us, daring us to take action in whatever way we can.

The DVD features a short documentary on the real Paul Rusesibagina's return to Rwanda, as we see the horrible preservation of some bodies (at first, I didn't realize I was looking at human remains...they looked like white plaster statues of stick figures). In a way, such a preservation will probably force people to remember, as the human tendency seems to be towards, ""it never happened."" We must remember what evil is capable of achieving...and that it was possible to slaughter half a million people by machetes alone.

2239245,5,B0007R4T3U,"I finally got around to seeing Hotel Rwanda on DVD.  Why is this film a masterpiece?  Why does it change our heart?

First, it's well made.  We seldom leave Paul, the POV character. The tragedy unfolds before him, enveloping his family and country.

It tackles an ambitious topic: hate transformed into genocide.  What a departure from the amazing Hollywood schlock machine.  How could it happen?  Or, depending your rung on the emotional tone scale, why doesn't it happen more often?  It examines how we are sucked from dislike and prejudice to murder, and how, believing we're on God's side, we justify the vilification of others . . . even applaud it.

It hits the larger topic of the indifference of the West towards those without oil.  Paul ran out of money to bribe the corrupt; the people of Rwanda lacked anything to bribe us into action . . . except our own shame.

The story asks what would we do?  How is hatred justified?  How can good men remain mute?

Paul makes the transformation of caring only for his family to caring about his fellow man.  A great film entertains, but it also forces us to examine our moral code . . . to act with decency and justice towards man.

Robert McKee argues great films are no longer written because values are relative today . . . nothing is black and white anymore.  Hotel Rwanda proves him wrong.",1114300800,,1345,4.556485355648536
2239246,3,B0007R4T3U,"Don Cheadle and Sofie Okonedo are absolutely amazing and entirely believeable as a couple caught in the maelstrom of this atrocity, but the film fails to deliver the real sense of horror and abandon that KILLING FIELDS or HARRISON'S FLOWERS conveyed of a world gone insane. And this was an insanity fueled by a pernicious racism that feigned innocence under the Clinton and Blair regimes.

What I didn't like was the movie never gets going and involves you the way the stories of Dith Trang and Harrison did. It touches the historical basues, but actors walk on and deliver the lines, the scenes are all shot the same way and the soundtrack underscores precious little.

It was made for all the right reasons, it's just that in the hands of Terry George, it is a little too cliched and stereotyped without a sense of the seething betrayal needed for people to massacre each other. It's as though the film was done by rote.

Apart from the two protagonists, the film really doesn't give you a sense of drama unfolding. If you are even superficially aware of this story, you'd find yourself wondering why things happened as they did, who were the real criminals, and what hypocritical chutzpah it took for Clinton to fein sympathy and concern while never leaving the airport. There is a much more incendiary story to tell here. Terry George just couldn't find it.",1114214400,3,1361,4.734177215189874
2239247,5,B0007R4T3U,"I don't even know where to begin.  This movie was absolutely excellent!  I haven't seen ""Schindlers List"" yet so I can't compare the two but this tale of hatred, evil and heroism is a masterpiece.  If it weren't for Jamie Foxx's outstanding performance in ""Ray,"" Don Cheadle's failure to win best actor Oscar would have been a major injustice!  Every other performance, particularly by Nick Nolte and Sophie Okonedo is well done as well.  It was so powerful and depressing that even though the movie ended on a somewhat positive note, I had to watch a comedy movie immediately afterward just to make sure that I could sleep that night!

For the rare few who don't know, Rwanda is where nearly one million members of the Tutsi tribe were brutally slaughtered by members of the Hutu tribe who referred to the Tutsis as ""cockroaches.""  Cheadle portrays Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu hotel manager who uses his negotiation skills and international contacts (which he painfully learns are limited) to shelter and protect as many Tutsis as he can, including his wife and children.  The main focus is on Rusesabagina and his efforts to save lives but the references to the slaughter and carnage on the outside are still more than enough to get a sense of the horrific atrocities taking place and it's still very powerful.  During and after the movie, I kept shaking my head wondering how anyone could hate another human being to the point of committing such a thing without any remorse whatsoever.  It's so much worse when it not based on anything any particular person did but when it's based on things such as race, color, ethnicity, religion or other incidental things.  It's the same question I had about slavery, the Nazi Holocaust, Jim Crow and other well known crimes against humanity when I was a child and still have about the 911 attacks, ""ethnic cleansing"" in Eastern Europe, the current slaughter in the Sudan (which will equal Rwanda if not checked) and other similar incidents.

This movie will not provide any answers to those questions but it's crucial that it was made.  We have to be reminded that this has happened and still happens so that we can hopefully learn from it.  Remember, this is a movie and nothing compared to the real life horror of the actual massacre.  When my child is old enough, I will make absolutely sure than he watches it and hopefully it will not only teach him a valuable lesson but further inspire him to be his brother's keeper.",1114214400,,2464,4.737704918032787
2239248,4,B0007R4T3U,"I've read a lot about the genocide in Rwanda.  I picture scenes of despair, murder, and dismemberment.  All I have to do is hear the word ""Rwanda"" and I am filled with sadness at the thought of the brutality of human beings.

I therefore looked forward to seeing Hotel Rwanda.  Don Cheadle had even been nominated for an academy award for his outstanding performance.  I wanted the world to know of the horror that took place just ten years ago.  And I hoped that somehow, this knowledge might change something.

Unfortunately, this is not that film.  I was disappointed.  However, I am not the filmmaker.  And I wasn't the one making the decisions.  This is not the story of the genocide.  It is simply the true story of one courageous man who helped save more than a thousand people.  And, for this reason it is a fine film because I know it was viewed by millions of people, some of whom had never even heard of the country itself.

Don Cheadle is superb in the lead role.  He manages his luxury hotel with sophisticated understanding of human nature and the power of bribes and flattery.  This is the time of the Hutu uprising and, as he is a Hutu, he is safe.  But his wife is Tutsi and she and their children are at risk.  How he saves them, as well as all the other people, is a story of courage.  He's a fine actor, and he shows complex emotions.  I was always aware of the terror he felt underneath all his outward calm, and I, too, feared for his family.

Nick Nolte is cast as the powerless U.N. official.  His performance was fine, as usual.  It's obvious though that he's had some plastic surgery.  It makes his face look smoother but I miss his cragginess and range of expression.

This was not a perfect film.  It was too long.  It somehow simplified the horror.  And it never dealt with the fact that after the Hutus had done their murdering, the Tutsis came back and murdered some more.  However, I applaud the fact that it was made at all.  And I also came away with a real appreciation of Don Cheadle's acting skill.

2239250,5,B0007R4T3U,"Typically, I avoid reviewing anything but books. In this case, I will make an exception. This movie, like ""City of God,"" is a phenomenal look outside of American culture.

As Americans, it really is necessary at some level to be aware of other cultures and how they are faced with overwhelming poverty, violence, and corruption. This is not to say that we do not have our own issues (because America is chock full of issues galore), however, once you see what went on in Rwanda and how it was dealt with, you may begin to question the importance of life...and you will certainly begin to question the reality of racism.

I can speak for no one but myself in saying that this film will and should move you to THINK. Don Cheadle (sp?) was absolutely fantastic in his role and his character shows you how quickly self-importance can turn to motivation for a cause...and if you don't view this movie with anger and passion welling in your heart for the state of humanity, your integrity should be questioned.

I enjoyed seeing the house manager outfox politicians, gangsters, and vigilantes.  The slow but steady build in tension as he first does so for profit, and later for survival was subtle and ingenious.  It's great seeing heroes who use common sense and bargaining skills, rather than weapons, brawn etc. to save lives!

An obvious comparison can be made here to Schindler's List.  The hero uses Jewish labor to make money, then later turns his business acumen to the spiritual business of saving lives.  Different setting, mood and characters, but the same tension--the same need to survive with nothing more than one's wits.

Ordinary people can be heroes.  Hotel Rwanda gave us a powerful example.

My one brief editorial contribution here is that sometimes powerful nations should interfere just because it's right.

2239252,5,B0007R4T3U,"Hotel Rwanda is an amazing movie that captures the drama of a real-life event in the African country of Rwanda. A conflict breaks out between two tribes and the world sits and watches as the Hutu militia massacre the Tutsis. Paul Rusesabagina, played by Don Cheadle, is a hotel manager that becomes an extraordinary hero by housing Tutsi refugees. His acting along with the dramatic scenes helps the audience realize just how bad the chaos was in 1994. This film is a vivid reminder of what can happen if the world turns its back on struggling countries.

Several scenes in this film are especially touching. One scene, for example, displays how millions of people were murdered in the streets without mercy. Don Cheadle and a hotel employee are riding toward the hotel with supplies for the refugees in the fog. As they stop after hitting a few bumps they notice that those bumps were Tutsi bodies that were murdered and left in the streets. Another scene that was touching is one that shows how the U.N. and the world turn its cheek of the situation in Rwanda. As all the non-Rwandans are evacuated a group of nuns and children from a church show up. Half of the group is Rwandan and the other half is not. The U.N. soldiers only take the non-Rwandans and leave the women and children of Rwanda to whatever fate that awaits them.

The film hotel Rwanda really hits home. Superpowers, like our beloved United States, cannot be content with the world we live in. Our country has to have a stronger role in foreign politics and help these countries around the world that are struggling. We can no longer sit idle as events like Rwanda occur.

This film captures the drama of a real-life event and displays it to the world. I give this film five stars. This is not Don Cheadle's first good drama however. Another film called Rosewood depicted a real life event just as horrifying as the Rwanda massacre. Rosewood was a black town in the south that was massacred by whites. Don Cheadle does not play the leading role in Rosewood, but still gives a great performance.

Both films are amazing pieces of work and I hope everyone gets a chance to view them for themselves.",1114128000,3,2165,4.615584415584416

2239254,4,B0007R4T3U,"This movie is a work of art.

Others have given great reviews here, so I won't go on to retell the storyline. I recommend Kim Anehall's review of the movie below if that's what you're searching for. I'll just rant on a few other things pertinent to the film.

I recommend the photographic book, ""Inferno"", by James Nachtwey if you want to see the real face of this brutal civil war. Nachtwey once said he ""was a war photographer; but now is an anti-war photographer."" ""Inferno"" is the sort of war-time photography seen only during Vietnam. He covers, along side Rwanda, Somalia, Romania, India, Sudan, Bosnia, Zaire, Chechnya and Kosovo in his 473 page masterpiece. I tell everyone that ""Inferno"" should be mandatory reading (Viewing) throughout the western world. So, if this movie impacted you, I recommend you go here:

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0714838152 and get a copy.

We in the western world can ""switch off"" the horror of war simply be reaching for the remote. Movies and entertainment make us all numb to the reality of human suffering. I look around and see SUVs with $20,000 in Tires and Mags alone and think of what could be done with that money. A Lawyer's suit. A Plasma Television.

I watch this movie and think about all the people whining about the price of petrol. Yes, we in the west carry a heavy burden. How do we do it?

Naughtwey also has a book out on Afghanistan and Iraq, titled ""War"", which I'm sure won't look as tame as what Bush, CNN or Fox News would have had you think the wars were like. Have to wait till next paycheque for that one.

My ""glaring flaw"" is the films fictitious Canadian UN peacekeeper, General Oliver (Real name: Romeo Dallaire). I'm sorry, but too many times have I seen Hollywood rewrite with history like they have some right. Sometimes justifying it with excuses like, ""Americans won't go see a film about (Enter a historical figure or country), they want to see Americans."" Examples of this are U571, Last Samurai, Private Ryan (Where one gets the feeling that America ""took"" the beach. Five beaches, two for America, two for Britain, and one for Canada) The list goes on and on.

This film is not nearly as deplorable as most others. The film does a respectable, and rare, job of offering a fair portrayal of a non-American demonstrating unbelievable bravery and dedication to his mission, and the people. In many instances you can plainly see his Canadian flag on his shoulder. So, I doubt the name change was malicious, but I have to ask why. I've read it was because the character was ""loosely"" based on the real man. I for one doubt it. I feel strongly that the REAL name should have been used, no matter what the cost. Whatever the reason, I have a hard time believing it was a good one. If he didn't like something in the script, change the inaccuracies. If this was an American general, I doubt very much the movie company would allow his name to be changed. The man is a real hero, and deserves more recognition than the world has given him. I remove one full star for that, and I don't care what their reasoning was. It is just plain criminal.

Lt General Romeo Dallaire in Rwanda:
While the western world sat on their hands, Dallaire did all he could with what they gave him, saving thousands of lives in the process. President Clinton, at the UN General Assembly of all places, said he would go ONLY if it was in their self-interest. To put it crudely, he might as well have said, ""if we can ring oil out of the dead bodies, we'll be there."" Dallaire made several pleas to the Department of Peacekeeping Operations in New York for more troops (He asked for 5,000 minimum) and was repeatedly denied. On top of that, he was instructed not to intervene, and was not authorized to use any force. While spin doctors struggled to ""accurately define"" genocide, Dallaire stared it in the face. How he and his men survived can only be described as miracle, and I'm not religious. After rejecting Dallaire's call for aid, the US refused to acknowledge Rwanda as genocide in order to avoid any possible legal obligation to help the dying. Dallaire felt betrayed by the Belgians perhaps most of all. After ordering 10 of his finest men to secure the Prime Minister of Rwanda, 10 highly trained Belgians, who were among the finest and most experienced in the region. They were ambushed, murdered and mutilated. Dallaire took the full brunt of the blame by the Belgian press and people. The entire Belgian battalion was promptly pulled from Rwanda. Dallaire admitted failing later, but for him, the failure was not to the Belgians, but to the people of Rwanda, who lost nearly one-hundred-thousand times as many people. After the conflict, Dallaire was treated with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. He never commanded troops again.

As I said, others have given great reviews here, so I didn't go on into the storyline much. I just felt someone had to step forward and ask why it was necessary to change the name of such a great man. What would people say if they changed Paul Rusesabagina's name? It would be an equally disrespectful act.

Dallaire has written a book on his experiences in Rwanda, which I am anxiously waiting for the shipment of. It is called ""Shake Hands with the Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda"", and you can get it here: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0786715103

The only other complaint I would have is the seemingly deliberate distance between the viewer and the violence. Again, something books like ""Inferno"" reveal. I believe it is important, especially in a world numb to violence through video games and movies, that people see the brutality of war accurately. It should be hard to watch. Next to impossible. If not, the message may not stick with the viewer throughout their lifetime. Shock value cannot be underestimated. Like those drinking and driving videos I recall from High-School that will never leave your memory, movies like this must sear a visual image of terror and horror that IS reality in all wars, or they can't help but fall short of the mark.

Since this movie had such an impact on me, I truly want to give it a five, but when there's tampering with history like this, I for one get a little aggravated. I'm grateful that a real Peacekeeper named Romeo Dallaire was in Rwanda in 1994, not some made-up guy named ""General Oliver"".

Hotel Rwanda falls short with canned writing and on-cue tear-jerking mediocre music.

Hotel Rwanda almost succeeds in maintaining a degree of sobriety, and a mood of factuality in the dramatic events--and this is its strength and its originality.

However, the script goes too fast to convey the plot's atrocious events, leaving the aftertaste of awkward melodrama. And to give another example. the happy ending is too fast and artificial. I could be much more critical; could go on.

2239259,5,B0007R4T3U,"""Hotel Rwanda"" is one of the most powerful movies of recent times. In 1994, the Hutu tribe massacred almost a million members of the Tutsi tribe in Rwanda while the Western world largely looked away. UN peacekeepers were in place, but they had no mandate to prevent the genocide. The event was viewed by the outside world as mainly a local problem or dispute.

In the capital city, a man named Paul [Don Cheadle] managed a luxury hotel owned by a large corporation in Europe. During the uprising, he housed 1200 refugees in the hotel. He managed to save them all. A Rwandan himself, he was able to do this because he knew the ins and outs of the corrupt local politics.

Ah, Africa! Quick! Named three movies that portray that continent accurately. Why are we so indifferent to the place? It was the West that carved Africa up into the nations we know today. It was the West that lost its control of the place. Are we indifferent because we have little control?

Whatever the answers to these questions, ""Hotel Rwanda"" remains a searing movie.",1113696000,3,1043,4.596774193548387

2239262,5,B0007R4T3U,"Rwanda is a beautiful country with four neighboring countries Tanzania (east), Congo (west), Burundi (south), and Uganda (north).  This country is located in the middle of Africa, which has flourishing green forests and hills.  The Canadian Lieutenant General Romo Dallaire who was assigned as commander of the United Nations troops in Rwanda called it heaven on earth before the three dreadful months in 1994 when nearly a million people where murdered and maimed.  Hotel Rwanda illustrates one man's struggle for survival while trying to save as many as possible, as his nation turned into hell on earth, a hell that the Western World could have prevented, but decided to ignore, as it probably did not seem important or profitable.

A sad issue with the Rwanda genocide is the Western World's decision not to exercise previously learned knowledge from what happen at the Evian Conference of 1938 when the Western World closed its borders to German-Jewish refugees.  This was a decision that cost more than six million Jews their lives, as it indirectly gave Hitler the notion that the world did not care for what happened to the Jews in Germany.  A recent documentary, Shake Hands with the Devil: The Journey of Romo Dallaire (2004), could help shed some extra light on how the world disregarded the events in Rwanda, as it depicts Dallaire's attempts to get help and his own perspective on his situation in Rwanda.  A situation where Dallaire was left in Rwanda with a mere 300 soldiers for an assignment required at least 5000 soldiers, as he helplessly could hear and see victims being butchered that were left to rot on the streets.

A question rises when one hears about this dreadful story.  Why did people not pay more attention to the murders in Rwanda?  Several notions come to mind such as the war in former Yugoslavia and the people's fascination with O.J. Simpson's glove size.  These news stories took up more coverage time on the news than Rwanda, as almost a million lives were scuffed into the slots to fill time in between news and commercials.

A black screen opens Hotel Rwanda, as the audience can see the opening credits and hear radio broadcasts from different radio stations.  Through these radio broadcasts the audience quickly learns where the Western World is focusing its attention, the war in the former Yugoslavia.  Another broadcast provides more in-depth information on how the radio helped spread lies that fed the hatred and anger against the minority group Tutsi.  These broadcasts where frequent, but no one tried to prevent them.  In the documentary of Dallaire the audience can learn that the Catholic Church could have helped lessen the effect of these radio broadcasts, but did not try to spread the word on a wide-ranging level.  It was simply ignored, as many thought that these Hutu extremists were simply crazy, as they ran around in their colorful outfits screaming prejudicial statements against the Tutsi.

Amidst the anger and hatred a luxurious hotel, the four-star Hotel Des Milles Collines, functions as an oasis of delight.  The Des Milles Collines has a skillfully diplomatic manager by the name Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), who knows what to say, what gift to offer, and how to make people feel good at all times.  The work at the hotel takes up a lot of Paul's time, as he frequently finds himself missing out on vital information in regards to what goes on in the nation.  Nonetheless, he is grooming important relationships with key characters in the Rwandan government, which later will be of much use for him.

In a meeting between the Hutu president of Rwanda and the Tutsi rebel leader arranged by Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte), whose real name is Romo Dallaire, both parties sign a peace treaty.  This was a treaty that many welcomed, as many believed that it would bring peace and calm to Rwanda.  However, shortly after the signing of the peace treaty, the President's plane is shot down.  The Hutu extremist's radio broadcast blames the Tutsi, which begins a three month long slaughter of the Tutsi.

Paul finds himself in a predicament, as his wife and many of his neighbor's are Tutsi.  He makes the decision to help save them by bringing them to the Des Milles Collines through bribes and diplomatic poise with brutish soldiers.  It leads into an eye-opening beginning for Paul while many of his preconceived notions begin to break, as the truth leaks out.  In a strong scene between Paul and Colonel Oliver, Colonel Olivier describes for him how little this nation is worth to the Western World.  As a member of the enlightened and educated Western World, this scene will induce shame and guilt, as what Colonel Olivier states is the same thing the audience can learn from Shake Hands with the Devil: The Journey of Romo Dallaire (2004) where Dallaire explains how little he could do as he was ordered to do nothing.

In a seemingly hopeless situation Paul uses his diplomacy in order to maximize the chance for survival, as he and others can bear witness to the madness outside the hotel's walls.  Poignantly genuine is the character that Don Cheadle presents, as he depicts a very humane person who realizes that he must use his powers to survive while trying to save as many as he can.  However, his performance also brings gut wrenching scenes where he stands strong in moments of immediate danger while also displaying moments of true emotions such as fear, happiness, melancholy, and despair.  The film's success rests within Cheadle's brilliant performance, which is highlighted by the talented cast that surrounds him such as Sophie Okonedo, Nick Nolte, and Hakeem Kae-Kazim among many others.

Hotel Rwanda provides a great opportunity for the world to experience the misery and fear that the Tutsi of Rwanda were subjected to during their persecution.  It could not be considered a wonderful film due to its grotesque nature, but it is an important film that should be seen.  The director, writer, and producer Terry George who previously has written screenplays for films such as In the Name of the Father (1993) and The Boxer (1997) displays his skill to tell the truth without shocking or displaying an overwhelming levels of the gruesome crimes that were committed in Rwanda during the spring of 1994.  Instead, he offers the Western World a moral lesson that should not be forgotten, as he leaves the audience with the story of Paul Rusesabagina and his selfless effort to save 1200 people.",1113696000,2,6478,4.909174311926606
2239263,5,B0007R4T3U,"In 1994 when Rwanda descended into the bloody madness of genocide Paul Ruseasabagina (Don Cheadle) was reasonably secure in his process.  He belonged to the Hutu majority that was slaughtering the minority with machetes and he was the manger of the five-star Hotel Milles Collines in Kigali.  But his wife, Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo), is Tutsi and the Tutsi are not only being called ""cockroaches"" on the nonstop incendiary radio broadcasts they are being exterminated like them.  Not only are his wife and children in danger, so is the rest of his family and so are the guests in his hotel.  It is up to Ruseasabagina to do something about this madness simply because there is nobody else to do the job (it would be easier to call the character Paul, but given the story it seems important to focus on the fact he was an African).

""Hotel Rwanda"" is a true story, and even though we know going in that Ruseasabagina is going to save over a thousand refugees this is still a harrowing story.  For the most part the genocide happens outside the walls of the hotel, but there are enough scenes and stories of what is happening to make it clear that the people huddled in the hotel are in mortal danger.  What is probably the most unforgettable moment comes while a van is being driven through the fog and appears to have gone off the road (the DVD extras also contain scenes of the unforgettable way the Tutsi have memorialized the victims of the slaughter at one location).

The explanation for why the United Nations, the Europeans, the Americans, or anybody else with a speck of humanity in them does not intervene to stop the genocide is articulated by the Colonel Oliver character played by Nick Nolte, who tells Ruseasabagina that the problem is that these are just black Africans killing other black Africans.  The words are spoken in disgust and are brutal, but they are horribly true and what redeems Oliver is not only that is he is willing to articulate the brutal truth but that there will come a point where orders to stand by and do nothing are no longer going to be obeyed.  Likewise, the cameraman played by Joaquin Phoenix provides a memorable scene as the Europeans leave the Milles Collines and the character is so shamed not only by the retreat but also by the presence of a hotel employee holding an umbrella over their heads in the pouring rain.

But there is one person who cannot turn his back on what is happening.  Ruseasabagina is literally the right person in the right place, because only the hotel could have become a refuge for the Tutsi and only the manager of a five-star hotel could have known exactly how to placate the military men leading the massacre.  Not only does he speak their language, there is a sense in which they want to speak his as well, showing that even though their arms are covered in blood they can play the role of a civilized man.  Cheadle's performance, deservedly nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, is appropriately controlled just as Ruseasabagina had to be in persuading these thugs to help him.  He cracks only once when a mundane part of his preparing for his job suddenly becomes an impossibility to manage.  He is also a hero who is flawed, making mistakes and trying desperately to do the right thing, even if that means forcing his wife to make a fateful promise or abandoning his family to try and save others.

There is an obvious comparison to be made between ""Hotel Rwanda"" and ""Schindler's List.""  But watching this 2004 film I could not help thinking that if during the Holocaust there had been images of Nazis herding Jews into the concentration camps on the nightly news nobody would have done anything either (but if a whale is trapped in an ice flow in the arctic a rescue mission shall be sent).  Stories such as this emphasize the small number doing good against the large number doing evil, but there is always that even larger number signifying all the people who do nothing and assent to the evil by their silence.  Those who watch ""Hotel Rwanda"" will find themselves counted among that final number and should well remember that even if they were oblivious to what happened in Rwanda history will repeat itself is this regard and give us another chance to do the right thing.",1113696000,195,4253,4.63031914893617

2239265,5,B0007R4T3U,"This is one of the better films that I have seen lately, and well deserving of the Academy Award nominations that it received. The film stars Don Cheadle portraying Paul Rusesabagina in a role in which he was nominated for Best Actor, also well deserved. The story is a retelling of the true events which occurred in 1994 during a Rwandan uprising which the Tutsi population of Rwanda was almost annihilated by the Hutu militia.

Paul Rusesabagina (Cheadle) is a hard working Hutu, who serves as the Hotel Manager of a Belgian five-star hotel, the Hotel Milles Collines, in Rwanda. He is married to Tatiana, a Tutsi, played by Sophie Okonedo. Paul lives in a neighbor populated by both Hutu and Tutsi. As the movie begins, tensions are rising as altercations between Hutu militia and Tutsi rebels escalate. Rumors start circulating about a possible Tutsi coup, as Hutu military soldiers begin rounding up possible Tutsi spies in Paul's neighborhood.

A full fledge genocidal war against the Tutsi population is ignited when the plane with the Rwandan President, a Hutu, is shot down by Tutsi rebels only hours after a peace treaty between the Hutu militia and Tutsi rebels is signed. Paul's neighborhood as well as much of Rwanda becomes the battle ground for the war, where only bribery, blackmail, and payoffs are your only survival.

Paul is able to get his family and a van full of neighbors back to his Hotel in hopes that United Nations soldiers will protect these refugees. However, just the opposite becomes apparent. The U.N. soldiers are forced to take no stand on the situation before them. What's even worst, at one point of the film, the U.N. forces arrive at Paul's hotel in mass only to help to evacuate the European guests stranded there, thus leaving behind the Rwanda refugees to fend for themselves without any protection whatsoever.

Paul becomes a one-man army whose only mission is to save the lives of these people. He is forced to plead to foreign nationals, manipulate generals, bribe the Hutu militia, and grovel to U.N. peace-keepers. He is willing to do whatever it takes in order to keep the atrocities, which are occurring just outside his hotel compounds, from entering their confines.

This story is brutally told; it's both gripping and ghastly. Director Terry George pulls no punches; and emotions run rampant as scenes such as ""the U.N. forces departure leaving Rwandan refugees behind at the hotel"" just tears at the heart. It's a story of how one man overcomes insurmountable odds to make a difference, and it's graphically depicted. Again, this film is not for the squeamish; however, I highly recommend seeing it.

2239267,4,B0007R4T3U,"I came into watching ""Hotel Rwanda"" without previously forged opinions (although I had heard other opinions ranging from overly positive to negative) and I found that its power comes from its subtlety of delivery -- no beating over the head of Hollywoodisms, no grand, self-important proclamations from the central character and most importantly, it doesn't marginalize who's the obvious lead character in this story as Hollywood so often does. It DOES NOT make the unforgivable errors of such Hollywood junk as ""Mississippi Burning,"" ""Cry Freedom,"" and, more recently, ""Last Samurai,"" in that this is a story about Rwanda and Rwandans and the main character is indeed Paul Rusesabagina.

Thankfully, the moviemakers were hopefully aware enough to not make Caucasian characters the leads and push all minorities to the sidelines -- because that's what we find here. This is the story of Rusesabagina and the Rwandan refugees, not how a white character comes and saves the day (which is what is what we see in most Hollywood movies which deal with this type of story).

But that aside, this is one of the most solid, deeply moving movies I've seen in a long time. Some have said this movie treads into ""movie-of-the-week territory."" I disagree. Its power lies in the words, the looks on faces, the largely low-key performances by the actors, and primarily that of lead Don Cheadle who turns subtlety and straightforwardness into strength and passion. Most actors would easily resort to fancy sound-bites, or overstated, overly loud proclamations, but not Cheadle. And thankfully, the script doesn't have any back-patting, self-conscious lines. You can almost imagine the actual people involved in these situations saying those words -- and not one character here is turned into a caricature. Not one is a glowing saint, but true-to-life people with faults and imperfections, caught in a dishearteningly stressful and tension-filled environment. And what we have here is arguably the most gripping and deep-riching big-screen movie since ""Saving Private Ryan,"" but what puts this one higher on the heartfelt meter is that it's a true story. And there really are no ""action"" scenes, no ""loud"" scenes, just human drama, bleak environments, and sadly realistic scenes of violence. You feel as if you're there yourself.

And arguably its most powerful scene features only Don Cheadle -- after just literally stumbling upon a road full of bodies, later on, he is trying to dress up, put on his shirt and tie, and he finds that he's tied it all wrong and he laughs, and so he starts to put it on again, and he starts crying uncontrollably, and he angrily pulls of his tie and shirt, and starts falling to the ground in tears, and then someone knocks on the door and he tries to tell him that he'll be out in a minute, but that trail of dead and all that's happened just bears down upon him at that moment.

Now if only Hollywood could make more scenes like that, and more movies like this.... but I'm not holding my breath as the masses continually go out and see the latest sequel, the latest rehash, the lastest ""blockbuster"" and the latest remake of old movies and of TV shows.

And perhaps the saddest thing of all this, is that few countries, if any, cared about what happened in Rwanda, and don't care about the slaughters going on now in Africa... because there's no money in it. Don't be like most, and just change the channel or turn over and go to sleep.

Paul Rusesabagina is truly a hero and he doesn't have a CD out, nor does he play professional sports. He truly did what he did out of his conscience -- he didn't do it to make money. That doesn't sound so special? Just sit down and think how many of us actually perform acts because they are right, and not because there's money in it.",1113609600,9,3793,4.800918836140888

2239270,5,B0007R4T3U,"With these words written on a visitors' log in a memorial site in Rwanda, the reason for making this stunning film is posed.  HOTEL RWANDA is not only a well written (Keir Pearson), well directed (Terry George), well acted (entire cast) work of cinematic history, it serves as a thunderingly loud announcement of how the world ignored the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, Africa - a country whose only exports are tea and coffee and therefore not high on the agendas of importance of the other nations of the world.  HOTEL RWANDA brings us the realization that there are many unreported acts of inhumanity that never reach our television or radio or newspapers.  How many of us knew about this incident before now?

But this well-crafted film is all the more poignant because it focuses on the quiet heroism of one elegant, enlightened hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) and his response to the Tutsi rebel uprising that resulted in the slaughter of over a million people,  and for what reason? Going back to the time when Belgium 'owned' the country they divided the people into the Tutsi and Hutu categories based on skin color, nasal width and other absurd parameters.  With Belgium's exit the two parties were placed in delicate balance and long years of struggle for control resulted in the 1994 disaster.

The senselessness of the genocide is shown by the selection of victims for which the Tutsi rebels depended on registration cards to identify Tutsis from Hutus: in reality the people had intermarried - even Hutu Paul was married to Tutsi Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo) - so that the killings were wholly irrational.  Given this madness, Paul struggles with the insurgency and gives shelter to as many people as he can squeeze into his hotel, refugees including orphan Tutsis, hotel staff, and friends and fellow countrymen in need of a Gilead.  All of this is happening while the United Nations contingency led by Col. Oliver (Nick Nolte) is impotent and the outside reporters such as Jack Daglich (Joaquin Phoenix) grab footage of the slaughter and flee to safety. Only a Red Cross nurse Pat Archer (Cara Seymour) remains to assist in any way she can.  Paul attempts to contact the outside world through his employer Mr. Tillens (Jean Reno) of the Belgian Sabena Airlines, but the world refuses to recognize the reality of Paul's plight in saving his countrymen.

The cast is exceptional: Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo are brilliant in their roles and the supporting cast is superb.  The DVD opens with a statement from Don Cheadle the actor, the movie unfolds, and the remainder of the CD includes 'the making of' sequences and historical segments that for once are not self-serving aggrandizement, but sensitively informing pleas for understanding and digestion of a genocide that was ignored.  This is a powerful film that deals with an atrocity without electing to lambaste the viewer with gore: the message is more powerful for its understatement.

A president who double back flipped to get out of Vietnam and who made fun of a woman whose death sentence he signed off on BUT who struts around in a flight suit, espouses pieties like ""culture of life"" and wouldn't know the truth if it hit him in the nose?  A former president who did his own backflipping out of Vietnam and who deserved a punch in the nose for how he treated woman, yet is praised as ""progressive""?

I've got a real hero for you: Paul Rusesabagina.  Everyone should get familiar with his story.

Consumed with thinking about your job?  Getting jazzed about that new iPod?  Reworking your budget to afford that Lexus SUV?  Check out Hotel Rwanda before you do.....you might feel so ashamed at your own ""problems"" that you'll save yourself stress about your own life and money since you'll realize that the things you ""have"" to have are of little value.

You see Paul has real problems.  Until early 1994 he led an upper middle class existence as the assistant manager of a four star, Belgian owned hotel in Rwanda.  Paul is a fixer....he knows where to find and get the best of everything for his guests.  He is smooth, poised, and well-connected.

It all comes crashing down with the start of the Rwandan genocide in April 1994.  By the time if was over, nearly 1 million Tutsis were killed by Hutus....a fairly recent artificial distinction made by Belgian colonials in the 19th century.

Paul is a Hutu but his wife is Tutsi and so are many of his friends, neighbors, employees and relatives.  Somehow he manages to hide 1200 of them in the hotel and try to ride out the storm with bribes, bargains, on the fly negotiations, lightning quick decisions, and unmatched courage.  Several false saves raise their hopes: the UN, the arrival of European troops, exit visas for many of the families.  Yet the UN troops only number 300 for the ENTIRE COUNTRY and are ordered not to fire, the European troops invade in order to rescue, well, other Europeans, and the exit visas get the families just a few miles away from the hotel before they are chased back by a Hutu mob.

While you never are exposed to the full brunt of the massacre (the movie is rated PG-13 and most of the violence is off camera and is rarely graphic) you get some measure of the horror of those living in the hotel.  You also understand some of the root causes of the massacre: racial hatred, the psychosis of the mob mentality, desire to belong to a group, opportunism (want that neighbor's house? Denounce him as a Tutsi or Hutu spy), and fear of being denounced yourself if you don't join in.  The movie is so disturbing on this point that you realize how fragile community can be.  Under the veneer of Paul's nice neighborhood roiled issues that brought it down in flames and blood.  How close is any community to a similar collapse when the right buttons are pushed?

I can't say enough about this movie....the acting, direction, and script are all excellent.  The Rwandan story is one that has to be told since it's devastation ranks right up with every other act of genocide/massacre in the twentieth century.

2239278,5,B0007R4T3U,"Every now and then a movie comes along whose subject matter is so important that the art of the film is almost irrelevant.

The universally praised HOTEL RWANDA (MGM) is ordinary filmmaking about an extraordinary man.  Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) is the manager of an elite hotel who exhibits the highest, most noble of human traits when he bravely takes a stand against the barbaric, bloody savagery during the 1994 Hutu massacre of the Tutsi minority.  Almost all the Tutsis were eventually slaughtered (by machete).

When his country descends into chaos, Rusesabagina first wants to save his family, assuming the world will intervene.  When that doesn't happen, he opens his hotel to over a thousand refugees. When a crazed militia storms the gates of the Hotel compound, the  stakes are substantially raised for his, his family's and ""guests"" safety.

Cheadle is magnificent as the clever, calm, quick thinking, heroic but never larger-than-life Rusesabagina.  Sophie Okoneda and Nick Nolte co-star in this unforgettable film.  Don't miss this rare true story about an honorable man trapped in a living nightmare of raging humanity at its most abhorrent, brutal, irrational and bestial level.

If you are reluctant to see this excellent film, fearing graphic depiction of the bloody events, fear not; almost all of it is off screen.  Superior extras include ""Return to Rwanda"" and a commentary with the real life Paul Rusesabagina",1112918400,24,1438,5.208695652173913
2239279,5,B0007R4T3U,"This movie deals with the genocide in Rwanda in 1994.  Over ten percent of all Rwandans died that year, including most of the Tutsi minority in the country.  The bulk were slaughtered with machetes.  It's scary to see how terribly people can treat each other.  And it is interesting to realize that it would have taken very little in the way of outside force to pretty much stop the slaughter.

Don Cheadle does a splendid job of portraying Paul Rusesabagina.  The acting in general is very good.

Now, what will this movie tell one about what happened?  I think it captures how suddenly the slaughter began, an event that surprised many people because they felt that a peace agreement was about to take effect.  I think it shows the constant fear in such a situation.

For those who aren't so sure they want to see all this, I'll tell you one good thing.  This movie leaves out almost all the blood.  We know what is happening, but we're not forced to watch much of it.

This is a serious and well-made movie.  If you are in the mood for a comedy, watch something else.  But if you want to learn a little about what the genocide in Rwanda was all about, this is a good choice.",1112745600,7,1177,4.3842592592592595

Everyone should see this movie -- especially History teachers to show to the students -- to understand the mistakes that were made concerning this genocide and hopefully prevent such atrocities in the future (although that does not seem to be happening with Darfur, Sudan).

It is a superb educational tool. There is no finer depiction of genocide in  Africa absent raw footage by news or human rights organizations.

There is a good reason its performers were nominated in the Oscars. I recommend it highly.

2239285,5,B0007R4T3U,"Hotel Rwanda is very hard to watch. But I recommend people to watch it, for their own sakes on educating themselves on one of the most ignored genocides in recent history.

The genocide that happened in Rwanda was between the two main ""tribes"", the Hutus and the Tutsis. By far Hutus were and still are the majority, Tutsis being the minority. Due to political and social strife, it catapulted when the Rwandan president was killed in a plane crash brought down by Tutsi rebels. This launched Hutu outrage and the masacres began. Everybody in the world did nothing to help, no one in America or Europe sent assistance. People didn't believe it was happening, or if they did, they shut their eyes. In 100 days nearly 1 million people were murdered. This movie is the true story about Paul Rusesabagina and his soulmate Tatiana, a Hutu married to a Tutsi, who housed 1,268 Tutsis and moderate Hutus from the killings in the 5 star hotel in Rwanda where he worked as manager. It isn't just a story of death, it is a strong story of love and family, and of country. It is enlightening and I believe everyone must see it to educate themselves on this tragedy.

The story itself is powerful, but so are the characters. Paul and his wife Tatiana possess a strong love as they house these victims of war and their own children.

The violence is kept far away from the viewers eye, if shown it is seen far away. The most graphic scene is when Paul is driving his van down a back road and stumbles upon hundreds of slaughtered corpses. Otherwise, it is really a story of the people he saved and how he saved them, instead of showing you exactly what violence countrymen did to countrymen. I reccomend everyone, who has a conscience, see this movie. I also recommend to keep an open mind though; not every Hutu was guilty of murder and not every Tutsi was innocent. It is the same as saying only Germans are responsible for the killings in WWII. Keep that fact in mind and do not just label all Hutus as killers.

Ten minutes into the film I had no memory of my doubts. Hotel Rwanda doesn't waste any time setting up it's overtly charged, suspenseful political tone. Plus, come to think of it, it may in fact be targeted at ignoramuses like myself whose apathy toward the African condition takes centerstage in its riveting drama.

Civil unrest has broken out in Rwanda and two warring tribes are at loggerheads, intent on ethnic cleansing. A massacre has been ordered by one side. Innocent civilians are being slaughtered in their gardens and backyards. One man, a hotel manager in a four star hotel in the middle of the riot-torn city, must take it upon himself to save the lives of as many people as can be packed into his premises, much to the chagrin of savage rioteers.

A throbbing game of cat and mouse ensues. Guest-starring are choice anthropoids from a largely impotent UN who lend a political undertone to the goings-on. The film is finely edited and moves along at a rapid clip as we see sacrifice, grace under fire, valor, love, even an occasional tranche of timely well-located humor.

Interestingly, the screenplay's rawness accentuates Hotel Rwanda's impact. The setup of one man doing a noble turn and saving people of different ethnicity is reminiscent of Schindler's List, but instead of Spielberg's noirish rendition, this film conjures up images of Oliver Stone's classic, Salvador, that showcased James Wood as a sparring journalist in South America. Gritty, infectious.

Nearly a million people died during this period of genocide, a toll that may have been dramatically lessened had the world not turned its back. What a truly humbling masterpiece. Recommended in a blink.",1111708800,3,1867,4.967948717948718

Jamie Foxx gave a great performance in RAY, but I truly think Cheadle deserved the Oscar.  His work in the movie wasn't as showy as Foxx's, but it was so much more powerful.",1111708800,10,521,4.7444444444444445
2239289,5,B0007R4T3U,"A big rap from the few mainstream writers critical of Hotel Rwanda, intimated again today in the New York Times, is that it was not graphic enough in depicting the scenes of genocide in Rwanda.  Huh??? How pathetic an attitude is that?? And what does it say about us as a society??  Do we really need to see gruesome machete cuts close up to understand the genocidal horror of Rwanda in 1994??

But this is a review, not the late Susan Sontag on the state of American culture as reflected by its writing critics.  And for this reviewer, Hotel Rwanda must be seen for its depiction of  one man's desperate and resourceful efforts to save lives in the eye of homicidal insanity.  Paul Rusesabagina did what he had to do, flattering and making deals with human vermin, and as a result more than 1000 people alive who otherwise would be dead.  He is a hero and this movie makes that correct judgment unequivocal.  But if the personal story of this one man is clear, Hotel Rwanda, through the character of Nick Nolte,  makes no less clear the complicity of the world for its refusal to intervene in a timely way to mitigate the slaughter.  Nolte portrays the UN peacekeeper colonel who is revulsed by what he is seeing, by the limited mandate -- not to mention manpower -- he has to oppose it, and by the developed world's interest in saving its own white-skinned citizens, period.

Rwanda was 1994; a decade later we get this film made in the U.S. and continued silence from the European countries most responsible -- by their colonial-era policies -- for contributing to the horror.  Now it's 2005 and there is a place called Darfur and a sad new chance for the world to make history, or, in a decade's time, another movie.",1111104000,7,1720,4.548701298701299
2239290,5,B0007R4T3U,"I remember back in the summer of 1994 when the Rwanda genocide first came to my attention, i picked up a newspaper turned to page 30 or something and saw a tiny article describing the deaths of possibly hundreds of thousands of people, what struck me at the time was that this could not be possible - if so many had died this would surely be on page 1? Bearing this in mind i well believe the film's underlying conclusion about western indifference to the conflict being linked to the colour of the victims' skin.

This film charts one man's crusade to save the lives of hundreds of Tutsi refugees and moderate Hutu's by sheltering them in the hotel in which he worked for the duration of the genocide. It is interesting how he became the hero he was, firstly he had a Tutsi wife - it started there, he had to pay in cash for her life, then the empathy he had for his wife carried across to other Tutsi's - such illustrates how compassion and also hatred work, compassion by familiarisation, hatred by separation and misunderstanding.  The film honestly incorporates many artifacts of the genocide, from the orchestrated mass rape of Hutu women to the very public indifference of the world's powers to the plight of the Rwandan people to the catalyst or spark which ignited the genocide - the assasination of the president and the calls for bloodshed using a pirate radio station (which in the film is voiced chillingly enough to make you believe these are actual recordings from the genocide you are hearing).

The subject matter itself needs no elaboration, it would be impossible to make the events more poignant by over-dramatisation. When watching the evacuation of the western journalists in the film i felt echoes of the excellent 70's movie about genocide in cambodia - The Killing Fields, when the journalists moved out (with their dogs) leaving the natives behind to die. Let me say now that i feel the Killing Fields is a far superior film. Hotel Rwanda does not let you go until the very end, at times it feels like the plight of the hotel 'guests' is hopeless (until you realise this is a Hollywood movie you are watching:)), the scene of the escaping UN convoy with refugees being attacked by hundreds of machete wielding madmen is terrifying. Even if this film were absolutely direly acted and directed i would forgive it for two reasons, the first being that the genocide in Rwanda deserves to be recognised in film along with Cambodia/Auschwitz etc, the second reason is that this hotel manager is a true hero (not the clichy kind)and his story is an inspiration to the entire human race. Having said that the film itself was very good, the acting was fine and the film achieves it's goal of psychological transplantation, you feel you are 'there'.",1110931200,3,2765,4.6969072164948455
2239291,4,B0007R4T3U,"Hotel Rwanda starred Don Cheadle who played Paul Rusesabagina, Hutu man in charge of a four star Beligan hotel who protected nearly 1,200 Tutsi refugees from being massacre by his fellow tribemen during the Rwandan Civil War. This was the war which our liberal press and our then president, Bill Clinton, purposely choose to ignored despite of its genocidical nature.

Don Cheadle did a wonderful job as a moral man in a very immoral position. Instead of taking the easy path for safety, he choose to take a route of human responsiblity by protecting those who could not protect themselves. Cheadle's effort clearly earned him the nomination for Academy Award for best actor. He was well supported by Sophie Okonedo who played his wife and also earned a nomination for best supporting actress. There are genuine chemisty between the two and their relationship create the foundation for why Don Cheadle's character did what he did. In simple terms, the film worked because Cheadle's character was believable despite of the fact that this movie was based on a true story.

The film did bring out the Rwandan Civil War to the movie theaters. Script did have to called to attention the differences between the Tutsi and Hutu since most Americans probably don't know or really care. But casual ease that these Africans slaughtered each other may surprised many people.

The film itself wasn't that high of a caliber. The movie was definitely too long, Nick Nolte was badly miscast as the UN military commander and the script was underwritten as most of the characters in the movie appears to be somewhat lightweight. Only Don Cheadle's character was totally fresh out and thanks to the great work by that actor, Paul Rusesabagina came alive. Sophie Okonedo brought her character alive despite of having a pretty limited character. For that, she earned her nomination for an Oscar.

This movie is a pretty decent film but only because the two lead actors were so good. Without Don Cheadle or Sophie Okonedo to carry the load, this film could easily be one of them easily forgettable made for TV flicks that would get three days of hype by the network and disappeared.",1110240000,4,2161,4.880108991825613

When Hutu-Tutsi violence begins, he must use all of his charm, hotel resources and favors to save 1600 of his family and countrymen from brutal deaths at the hands of rampaging mobs and militias.

This episodic film is more notable for the importance of bringing the Rwandan genocide to the screen than for its acting, sets or script. There's a certain unidimensionality to the characters, who either are very good, or very evil, or on their way to becoming so. The plot is somewhat contrived, with the small band of refugees at Rusesabagina' hotel enduring a series of escalating threats until (in the nick of time!) they manage to flee. The clichd approach to a horrifying story dulls its impact. Still, ""Hotel Rwanda"" raises important questions about the role of the outside world (media, government, business) in moderating brutality. It shined a spotlight on the lack of interest that ""civilized"" nations had in stopping the killing. The scenes in which white church workers abandoned their African ""friends"" was more than a little infuriating.

Three cheers for Cheadle, though, who was completely convincing (if 2 turns too noble) as an African man in the midst of chaos. A thumbs-sideways for the film's toned-down violence. True, more people may see the film than if its violence was R-rated, but the lack of horror drained the movie of its emotional context.

Himself a Hutu married to a Tutsi, this film vividly and nail bitingly documents the painstaking efforts Rusesabagina made to safeguard the people staying as 'guests' in his hotel as well as his wife and family. Fortunately, his efforts were largely successful as many of the people he took in survived.
 The film is marvelous in many ways. The acting and directing is superb and it seems no expense was spared in this film's production. I think Terry George was right to pick Don Cheadle for the role of Paul Rusesabagina and he, as well as the other cast members, did an excellent job with their parts.
 The whole film is a gut-wrenching reminder of the effects of extreme tribalism as well as the backlash against colonialism. From what I have gathered with my brief reading of Rawandan history, the Tutsis were always the more affluent class whos members made up the monarchs that ruled in Rawanda while the Hutus role was that of the commoners. Both groups mostly got along until their region was conqured by the Belgians in which the Belgians ended up favoring the Tutsis for positions of power during their occupation. This favoritism on the part of the Belgians as well as the forced dividing of the country's resources ended up leading to the tribal friction in Rawanda which came to a head during the time when this film takes place.
 The French are also to blame for the violence that took place there too since (while not directly addressed in the film) they supplied the Hutus with their military know-how and equipment which was used in the slaughter. There have been some reviews that compare this film to that of ""Schindler's List"" and, in some ways, it deserves that comparison. But I also think its a good way to demonstrate how very bad times can bring out the best in people. Especially during times of strife like what happened in Rawanda. Paul Rusesabagina, Oskar Schindler and others like them deserve immortalization so that, hopefully, others will follow their example and we can all learn from this and other tragic lessons of history.",1109980800,6,2307,4.7625

I am not a big fan of movies that show horrific and terrifying scenes of violence and oppresion, but when I heard that Don Cheadle was one of the main characters in the movie I knew I had to see it.  This movie is definitely a piece of very important history for us all.  The scene when the UN came to the hotel to take of the Europeans, Italians etc, and leave the africans behind was the most emotional part for me.  Watching them stand at the hotel waiting to be rescued, only to be told that they were being left behind was shameful to say the least. At that very moment I was ashamed to be an ""American"".

Don Cheadle was superb, and the actress who played his wife was amazing.  Although this movie was definitely no laughing matter, the small part that I did find amusing and it was certainly justified, Don Cheadle was looking for his family after the rebels came, and when he discovered they were all in the bathroom shower, when he flew the curtain back, his wife was there holding the shower head in her hand.  He said to her,

""What were you going to do with that?"", and everyone in the shower including Don had to laugh.  With all that was going on around them, that was a well deserved moment of humor for all of them. Him finding her and the children, after thinking for a moment that she might have jumped off the roof instead of being slaughtered to death, was a definite sign of relief.

How could such a horrific moment in history be overlooked and not be prevented?? This should have not be allowed to happen.  Its almost without a doubt that Jamie Foxx will win Best Actor for RAY, and he was fantastic in the movie, But I really wish they could give two Oscars that night, because Don Cheadle deseves it!!!!

2239295,5,B0007R4T3U,"This movie is a testament to the power of film to relate the agonies of the human condition and to touch us with them. It tells a gripping story that is both powerful and true. You end up thinking deeply about the value of human life and the impact of human action (and inaction). If I was in Paul Rusesabagina's shoes would I have had the heart to do what he did? As much as I wish the answer is `yes', I have to wonder, would I have been tempted to join the foreign nationals and left perhaps with an unmistakable expression of angst, sorrow and helplessness on my face?

This movie has often been compared to Schindler's list and it is not difficult to see why. Both tell the stories of affluent businesspeople in desperate times who were able to pull strings to help people in need. Both involved people reaching across cultural divisions and paying a price for it. The main difference lies in the awareness of what occurred. We are well aware of the holocaust of World War II because it is well documented in literature and it continues to haunt our moral conscience. The monstrousness of the Rwandan fiasco does not seem to have sunk in yet into our collective sympathies and this is for various reasons some of which the movie prompts you to think about.

Don Cheadle did an amazing job portraying Paul Rusesabagina's character. The movie was very well done from a director's standpoint. With a movie covering a catastrophe of this scope it's easy to think of how much more could have been crammed into the movie but by focusing on one person's struggles it gives us an orientation and a perspective. We can now begin to contemplate how bad it was, and to think that it was many times worse for a lot more people is painful to even ponder about.

The core message of this movie is badly needed since we were not vocal enough when the genocide was taking place and we are not vocal enough now that other atrocities are occurring. Watch this movie, you will not just cry, laugh, become awestruck and get educated --you will also emerge a better person.

In this one rumbling of the earth's crust, a great swathe of people have their lives snuffed out from Indonesia through Sri Lanka and India to as far a field as Somalia on the coast of Africa.  Nature is truly a cruel mistress.

Yet how many people who were brought to tears by this tragedy and rushed to offer help realise that nearly a million people died in 1994 in the tiny nation of Rwanda?  But it's true and the world turned a blind eye.

In an attempt to fill the vacuum, ""Hotel Rwanda"" is a truly great work of art.  The film eschews gratuitous violence as seen in a Hollywood horror film but, nonetheless, serves to remind the viewer of the hell that humans can inflict upon each other.  ""Hotel Rwanda"" is a must see film for 2005 and it deserves its three Oscar nominations.  One can only hope that it is looked on favourably by the Academy.

Don Cheadle as the hero, Paul Rusesabagina, is a revelation.  What's more, this story needed to be told.  Rusesabagina is a 21st century hero in much the same way as Oskar Schindler was in the 20th century.  Cheadle plays a great part and I can only hope that others see the depth of his character.

2239297,5,B0007R4T3U,"What the ""Hotel Rwanda"" is can be argued, but what cannot be dismissed is the power of this two hour movie about how one man can make a difference.

Is ""Hotel Rwanda"" a story about internal, contrived politics destroying a country? Or it is dealing with how those in wealthier, more established countries prefer to pretend such trouble does not exist, that they need not become involved?

Is it about two very similar people groups killing each other? Could the movie be a reminder of how the systemic killing of a people group can happen today, that the evil of the Jewish Holocaust is not unique to the 1940s?

At first glance, ""Hotel Rwanda"" might look like a condemnation against the West's unwillingness to respond to an absolute carnage of genocidal hate. For some, they might see Bill Clinton, or the United Nations as impotent figures in this tragedy of humanity. They are easy figures to pick on, depending on the audience's personal politics, and the fact of who was in office at the time.

For me, the tremendous strength of the movie was one man's valor, of hotel manager's Paul Rusesabagina humble commitment to do the right thing, even though the world around him was chaotically destroying itself.

The plot is simple: two of Rwanda's people groups, the Hutus and Tutsis, are killing each other. Mostly, it was Hutu extremists trying to exterminate the Tutsis. A hotel becomes an ad hoc refugee camp, deftly managed by a man who preferred to be anywhere else. Can the hotel remain safe? Will the people hiding there survive?

Don Cheadle, perhaps best known for his portrayal as Sammy Davis Jr. in 1998's ""The Rat Pack,"" is hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina.

Rusesabagina was just a businessman, the manager of the Belgian-owned Mille Collines, a top hotel in Kigali, Rwanda's capital. He worked hard to raise his family, and tried to keep politically neutral. When he saw neighbors killed, he kept his head low. When he brings in neighbors to be sheltered in the hotel, he still fights to retain his neutrality. However, when refugees start coming to the hotel by the dozens, he begins a new mission as the shepherd of a displaced people.

The bulk of the movie is shot within the hotel. Rusesabagina struggles to manage the appearance of a top quality hotel, since this image helps gird them against attacks. Bribes of money and liquor provide him with more protection, as do desperate calls from some 'guests' to their powerful connections outside of Rwanda.

When the camera takes us outside, we see awful scenes of gang-style killings. Although the Hutus and Tutsis aren't Bloods, Crips, Vice Lords or Latin Kings, but instead, are arbitrarily designated cultural groups, the murders are the same. Just as in any Chicago, New York or Los Angeles gangland war, the precise reasons for the constant violence are loosely based on dictatorial leadership, bigotry and bloodlust.

Listing the scenes which sank my heart is impossible. Singularly difficult to watch was the body-strewn road where Rusesabagina was driving.

""Hotel Rwanda"" is not a movie to bring a young family. Like ""The Passion of the Christ"" and ""Schindler's List,"" it has the kind of violence which is shown to remind us of the reality of the events being presented. Like in those movies, the audience I sat with sat stunned while the final credits rolled.

Like ""Schindler's List,"" the antihero's commitment is the redemption of the story. Although 1 million ""corpses were left behind,"" we see that although many men succumb to evil, not all do. Just as Oskar Schindler could not save every Jew, nor could Paul Rusesabagina save every Rwandan. But, just as Schindler helped a few, Rusesabagina also protected those he could.

Director Terry George might have chosen to dwell on what wasn't happening, and make this a political movie ala Michael Moore. He took the higher road, and tells a story of hope in the middle of a holocaust. I fully recommend ""Hotel Rwanda."" If the movie impacts you, please consider supporting relief efforts that continue in Kigali today.

2239298,5,B0007R4T3U,"I went to see this movie but couldn't hear a lot of the dialog with all the sniffling and sobbing of the audience as they watched the last holocaust of the 20th century. Ironically, when the lights came up after the credits, many of the sobbing masses were the same people who had been wearing Kerry Edwards buttons in months before.

It is an amazing disconnect. The biggest mass murder in the shortest period of time in modern history, with the possible exception of the murders in Cambodia which the newly ascendant Democratic Congress encouraged as they voted for the Jewish holocaust museum in DC at the same time.

This movie is very accurate, and very telling. Clinton gets a total pass on mass murder on a grand scale as nearly one million Tutsi's were hacked to death on his watch, and nary a peep from the liberal media. Bush on the other hand delivers democracy to fifty million Afghans and Iraqis with causality rates smaller than those suffered every day in liberating Europe from Hitler, and he get hoisted as a ""cowboy.""

This movie is wonderful, but it is so accurate, that it will be dismissed because it is really an indictment of the feckless Clinton regime.

2239300,4,B0007R4T3U,"First off, I applaud the filmmakers who recognized this as a true story that needed to be told.  But upon leaving the theater, one can't help but feel that the movie failed to capture the enormity of the Rwandan genocide.  Its tragically ironic that while gruesome violence is often a mainstay of mindless Hollywood entertainment, it is also completely muted and sanitized in an important film where the shocking degree of human brutality is central to the message.  Hotel Rwanda simply ends up lacking the impact it should have, mainly because it opts to shield our eyes from the despicable cruelty committed during the genocide.  The director also takes a few other missteps as well.  The tired Hollywood conventions he uses in depicting Paul Rusesabagina's relationship with his wife are overbearingly sentimental.  Although it's entirely appropriate to acknowledge the resilience of love in a hopeless situation, the movie did not need every other scene to be tearful hugs, with 'I love you' being repeated in a hundred different ways.  To me, this excessive drama merely came across as cumbersome and served to cheapen the power of the story itself.

Despite the great deed of bringing the events of the Rwandan genocide to light, there was also a moment where I felt the film committed a small but crucial act of social irresponsibility.  I am referring to where the film states that the Hutu and Tutsi distinctions were entirely created by Belgian colonials.  Although it is true that the Belgians used the Hutu and Tutsi division to conveniently exercise their control over the region (they used the aristocratic Tutsi to rule over the Hutu majority), historical evidence does not support the notion that the Belgians manufactured these tribal boundaries.  History shows that Hutu and Tutsi existed long before any westerners arrived in the region.  When the Belgians arrived, the Tutsi were already established as the ruling class in the region.  It can even be argued that they purposefully took advantage of the Belgian arrival to further strengthen their power over their Hutu brothers.  The West does bear much responsibility for ignoring and even causing many great injustices in the Third world.  However, history should not be re-interpreted simply to alleviate any social accountability Rwandans have for their own blunders.

But despite the issues I addressed above, Hotel Rwanda is an important movie.  This is a powerful and moving story that easily overcomes its occasionally incompetent directing.  Don Cheadle delivers an emotionally charged yet properly subdued performance wholly worthy of recognition.  There are a couple heart-wrenching scenes, such as a contingent of UN commandos escorting westerners to safety even as they abandon Rwandan refugees and children to their fate, that should leave you with an impression for a long time to come.  This film rightfully celebrates the immeasurable heroism of Paul Rusesabagina, and serves as a heartfelt warning against ethical complacency.",1109203200,,3014,5.252609603340292
2239301,5,B0007R4T3U,"This is a film that haunts you long after you've seen it. What happened in Rwanda in 1994 was genocide--and more shocking than the events themselves was the fact that the international community stood by and allowed it to happen. Hotel Rwanda portrays the sheer brutality of the time, as well as the courage and heroism of people, especially of Paul Rusesabagina, in saving Tutsis and moderate Hutus from being massacred by the Hutu militias.

The film is based on something that actually happened. Rusesabagina, a Hutu, was a manager at a four-star Hotel Mille Collines in Kigali when the genocide occurred. He was a great negotiator, knew all the important people in Kigali, and was good at bribing and talking his way through difficult situations, a skill that later not only saved his life, but those of many others. The killings started with the assasination of the then President on his way back to the country after signing a peace accord with the Tutsi rebels. In the beginning, Rusesabagina refused to believe that things could be as bad as some people predicted, but realized fairly soon that the Hutu militias were determined to exterminate the Tutsis. He fled with his Tutsi wife and children to the hotel; the militia left it alone, mainly because of the Western tourists and journalists staying there. This made it a safe haven for other Tutsis, who started to pour in, escaping from the slaughter outside. Rusesabagina believed that the international community would stop the massacre; he felt that once people abroad saw what was going on in the country, they would not allow this situation to continue. But this faith was destroyed when, instead of sending help, countries start to evacuate their nationals, basically abandoning the Rwandans to their fate. There was only a small number of UN peacekeepers left with orders not to shoot. Rusesabagina somehow managed to keep the 1,200 Tutsi refugees alive by using his negotiating skills and his contacts, both within the Rwandan government and abroad.

Hotel Rwanda is a powerful film, with a superb performance from Don Cheadle as Rusesabagina, and Sophie Okonedo as his wife, Tatiana. Nick Nolte is excellent as Col. Olivier, the UN commander, a character based on the real-life commander, Romo Dallaire, who tried to do something to stop the genocide, even if it meant defying his superiors. One of the things that shines through the horror is the love Rusesibagina has for his wife. Hotel Rwanda is not for the faint-hearted--there are some pretty gruesome scenes. But it is worth seeing--a sobering reminder that this scenario has been repeated countless times and will be, and that humankind does not seem to have learned much from the Holocaust.

In 1994, the Hutu president was killed by Tutsi rebels and as a result, the Hutus, which comprise a majority of the country, struck back in rebellion destroying humanity.

2239308,5,B0007R4T3U,"Terry George's ""Hotel Rwanda"" is one of those movies that is almost beyond criticism. The story of Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), a Rwandan hotel manager who strove to save as many of his neighbors as possible from genocidal government troops, requires no embellishment to make it powerful, and George gives it none: he tells it as straightforwardly as possible, with a minimum of trickery and just enough gore to get the point across. (The relative lack of gore has caused some critics to turn thumbs-down on the movie; if George were really true to the story, they said, it should have been a bloodbath on the level of ""Saving Private Ryan."" I find myself in agreement with George, however; he said that by toning down the gore and getting a PG-13 rather than R rating, he could reach the young people who really need to know what happened in Rwanda.) The story here is as old as history, and as new as today's evening news: the endless ability of a mob of people to find pretexts to hate and kill, and the vitally important message that one person CAN make a difference, even in the midst of murderous chaos. The film is superbly acted down to the smallest bit part, but special mention must be made of Cheadle, who gives a performance of heartbreaking intensity and purity as Rusesabagina, and Sophie Okonedo, who is deeply moving as Rusesabagina's wife Tatiana. This powerful film is a stern rebuke to us comfortable Westerners, who--as one character in the film points out--watched the horrors in Rwanda unfold on the evening news, said, ""How horrible,"" and went on eating our dinners.",1107993600,4,1593,4.754512635379061
2239309,5,B0007R4T3U,"Unfortunately, I have to preface my review with a comment to all those attempting to make the horrific chapter in human history that is portrayed in this film a left wing vs right wing, liberal vs conservative issue. Last time I checked there were at least two viable political parties in this country and neither today nor twelve years ago did the opposition party that was not in power do anything of consequence to curtail or call attention to let alone soundly condemn an immoral and unconscionable 'war'. Most of us through apathy are also culpable. I know I was not paying attention and I'm certain the news was out there (albeit relegated to some minor text on the third to the last page...but still) if I had taken the time and interest to notice. My head is bowed in shame and the only recompense I can offer is to not make the same error twice. Pointing fingers at either side is part and parcel of the same us against them mentality that allowed the Hutus to embrace this genocidal insanity to begin with, so enough already. Don't you get it?

That being said, this is a great film.

  It's completely engrossing.

  It involves you emotionally.

  The dialog is riveting.

  The story is clearly explained.

  The acting is exemplary.

  You can't tear your eyes from the screen.

  Even if you already knew what happened you want to know what's going to happen next.

  You leave the theatre thinking...and thinking...and thinking.

  You pretty much HAVE to recommend it to someone else and you most certainly want to talk about it.

  You will not forget it.

  So why wouldn't any movie that covers all those bases not be considered a great film?  Anyone who has read about all the difficulties the film makers had in getting this movie financed and distributed would know why it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of a 'Spielberg' film. However, story trumps special effects any day. Are we so lacking in empathy that we need to SEE actual dismemberments before we can comprehend the horrors? Just like in 1994 the powers that be really didn't want to tell this story. Thank goodness for passionate artists like (dir.) Terry George who persist through every obstacle to say what must be said despite all the politicians and businessmen and the like who would rather turn a blind eye to anything that doesn't enrich their bottom line. Not to mention the man in the street who doesn't care (or let's be nicer and say he doesn't notice) until the pain is personal. Oddly enough the last category is where Mr. Rousesabagina himself fell until forced by circumstance to find his higher self.

  Like some previous writers I also don't wish to lecture anyone to see it 'for their own good', I know that sounds like a turn-off but I believe you will be glad if you do take the time to see this film.

  Lastly, Don Cheadle has been doing stellar work for a very long time and I expect there is more to come. The subtlety and truth of his performance here cannot be overstated. The best.",1107820800,7,3001,4.586792452830188
2239310,4,B0007R4T3U,"""Hotel Rwanda"" is a difficult movie to review because the intentions of all concerned (director, actors, screenwriter) are obviously deeply heartfelt and thoughtful.
But the execution of said intentions are rudimentary and TV-Movie-like: this film has impact because of the true and sad story: many, many thousands of people murdered in Rwanda as the whole world watched and did nothing. As an American reporter says: ""People will watch this massacre and murder and say, what a shame, and turn back to their dinner.""
And that is exactly what happened.
""Hotel Rwanda"" is shot in flat, almost non-dimensional color that detracts from the inherent drama of this story. Think about the hand held camerawork and use of color in Oliver Stone's ""Salvador."" ""HR"" is the opposite of that groundbreaking film in execution.
But, and this is a big BUT: there is the courageous performance of Don Cheadle as Paul Rusesabagina, a Hotel manager who becomes the savior, through cagey-thinking, horse-sense really, to thousands of Rwandans. Cheadle's Paul is frightened yet calm: his expressive eyes and face always thinking, pondering about what to do next to save his family, friends and whomever else he can: through whatever means he can.
""Hotel Rwanda"" is not a great movie but it is an important one for it tells a story that everyone everywhere needs to know, understand and digest. Why did all of the major powers turn their heads when it was happening? Why did We allow this to happen?",1107820800,20,1477,5.008130081300813

2239312,5,B0007R4T3U,"In 1994, millions of Rwandan Tutsis were slaughtered at the hands of their brethrens, the Hutus. It was a year of unspeakable horror for the people of Rwanda and unconscionable shame for the people of the world. Needless to say, little has changed and the world is overall a testament to the failure of the human experience.

Hotel Rwanda is an impeccably poignant portrayal of the Rwandans' horror in that godless year. We follow the life of Paul Rusesabagina (played to startling perfection by Don Cheadle) during the genocidal clash. He is a Hutu married to a Tutsi with three children. In a society that turned so vile onto itself, Paul's family was always a vulnerable target to barbaric Hutus ready to swing their machetes, decapitating Tutsi ""cockroaches"". In spite of all the horrors he faced, Paul was able to see his family and 1,200 others through to the safe side of reality. While his ""Western"" friends abandoned him and his own tribe violating him, he kept his focus on surviving that nightmare of imminent slaughter; a focus that ultimately pays off.

I was extremely moved by this powerful, unforgettable film. It was so real it hurt. It clearly showed the horrors human beings are capable of through both action and inaction. Tribes and their culture of doom, the West meddling in already fragile societies (you know the drill: divide and conquer), the West being capable yet unwilling to help, the impotence and irrelevance of the United Nations, innate vanity and supremacy and innate brutality have left a soar taste in my mouth for humanity in general.

I was feeling so ashamed to belong to this failing specie called human kind as I was walking out of the theatre. I felt that there was no hope in this greed-driven, vanity-consumed and brashly brutal reality.

I cannot recommend this film enough to every single living person on this earth. It's essential that you see this film for your own sake and the sake of our very survival. I know it sounds cheesy, but the level of realism in this film is astounding and its lessons are viscerally felt.

President Clinton was right to apologize for the lack of world and U.S. response.  I have doubts, though, that the lesson was learned since the U.S. is so heavily involved in the Middle East, there is even less interest in preventing genocide in other parts of the world.

2239317,5,B0007R4T3U,"I have reviewed five aspects of the film, and assigned grades for each aspect, which can be seen below.

(4.5*) STORY:

I'm shocked that I didn't even know about this, nor do I remember it. I was in Nigeria in 1994, about 14 years old. I don't remember hearing about it on the news. But I'm really glad this story has been brought to the fore-front, thanks to this movie (and some other very good documentaries on the subject, I hear).

The story is so important, because not many individuals can imagine this as something that could be happening right now around us. When I saw Schindler's List in 1996, I cried, shocked at how cruel, depraved, dark, and wicked the human race could become. But that was during the second world war - THIS story happened in 1994!

(5.0*) ACTING:

Don Cheadle as Paul Rusesabagina is such an appreciated performance; understated, to pull us into to his character, yet so powerfully reflective of the horror of the massacre occuring around him. We see his heart break, and realise our hearts are breaking also. Sophie Okonedo makes Tatiana so realistic, and so fragile, that it is almost unbearable to watch her go through the horrors of the killings that occur all around her. Joaquin Phoenix and Nick Nolte are the hardest to watch, not because of their very good performances, but because the words they say excuse NO ONE from the guilt and responsibility of the slaughters.

Most impressive of all, are the hutus that support the killings. Many of the murderous rebels don't even seem to be acting; the hatred is palpable and often not just physically violent but emotionally violent as well. Tony Kgoroge (really good is this movie) is very hateful as Gregoire; Fana Mokoena excels as the General Bizimungo - his arrogance and selfishness is so alarming that it is at times quite funny; but, powerful as he is, he is also horrifyingly uncaring, and very duplicitous. I really enjoyed his performance, as a character, he is unforgettable. These antagonists are gripping - you're never sure what any of these men will do next, and that creates an uncomfortable tension for other characters you really care about.

Yet, with all the tension of the film, it is at times laugh out loud funny. It is a credit to these performances that both horror and humor are communicated so efficiently, giving the story a realistic, relatable, powerful feel.

(4.0*) DIRECTION:

This has to be one of my favorite aspects of this film. In terms of the 'PG-13' rating it has received, rather than it being a hindrance, it elevates the movie even more. Many of the horrors shown in the film are shown at a distance, or heard just outside of view, or recounted by the characters - it is very effective. It feels like you're experiencing a horrible circumstance very much beyond your control, with no escape, and no turning back. The feeling of not knowing what will happen next, or only being able to IMAGINE what can happen, works really well in the film. To the directors credit, a little more graphic violence could have easily made Hotel Rwanda an 'R', but this film really makes clear the difference between communicative, and gratuitous - excellent directive decision, and it allows so many more of us younger ones to see this important story.

The style of filming is almost documentary-like, another way of bringing the viewer deeper into the film, and making the true story seem... well, true. Some parts are sentimental, but considering how sad the circumstances become, how could they NOT be?

(5.0*) VISUALS:

Falls very closely in line with the direction. You see victims being dragged to be slaughtered, but the slaughter is never shown. When it IS shown, it is from a distance. We see either the horrifying prelude, the shocking but shielded act of murder, or the creepy, dreadful aftermath. Much of the violence is emotional, and dialogue is used to paint a picture in your mind of what the person talking has seen. It is very powerful, and is a credit to the director. The PG-13 rating is owed to creativity, NOT conformity.

(5.0*) OVERALL:

You would think that a movie like this refects on a wickedness of 'common man' and an uncaring apathy of 'fellow man' that shall hopefully never happen again. Think AGAIN - the very same things happen every DAY, all the around the world, even as I type! Sudan is suffering the very same atrocities RIGHT now; Liberia's population endured several YEARS of slaughter leaving uncountable souls dead and/or missing an arm or a leg. And that's just two countries, and that's just in Africa.

The world is hurting. But we really already know that. We can blame the newstations for not showing enough of the horrors that occur outside our nation (and good, BLAME the newstations, because, most of the time, with their selective broadcasting policies, they ARE to blame... but only partly). Even if we had tv stations devoted entirely to showing the world in turmoil, there would always be more suffering and injustice going on that the stations could show. The real issue this movie raises is when we DO see it, what are WE going to do about it - each person, for him or herself. This movie shows what one man did. He used his talents (the things he could do best; things that he LIKED to do) to effectively save the lives of people he cared about, and learned to care about. We see and appreciate movies that show this precious human quality from time to time, but this is REAL folks. Just as there really WAS an Oscar Schindler, who didn't follow the crowd who had the power, but followed his own heart - there really IS a Paul Rusesabagina, who did what entire governments would not do at a certain terrible time in 1994.

If he can, I can. These are the reasons I really appreciate this film. I'm really sad it's not in wide release (it seems to only be showing in three theatres in all of Montgomery County, MD), but I'm really glad it's been selling out the way it has. I'm really glad I got to see Hotel Rwanda, and I hope you get to do the same. I highly recommend this film.",1107475200,3,6051,4.651685393258427

2239319,5,B0007R4T3U,"What a superb film that porttaryed Africa at its worste and its best. The film was one of the best ever films to come from Africa and my compliments to the whole crew and the actors for bringing to us a story that needed to be told. This allowed us to focus on the reality of the madness of what happened and most importantly maybe the shame that the world stood by and did nothing.

The film was apparently shot in South Africa and I was impressed with the detail in which they where able to create the exact feel of Kigali (Rwanda Capital). The sets where superb and costumes where excellent. I have travelled to Rwanda before and felt that I was in the capital when watching this movie. The actors, all and without exception, portrayed the best of the continets people and also their worste side. Alas Africa puts little value on a human life ands this was portrayed so very clearly in the movie. The 'ethic cleansing' was on such a scale that it dwarfed what we have seen in other movies portraying the shame of what took place in amongst other places, Boznia. This is a must have in your DVD collections and will be found in my cabinet right next to the other excellent movies in my collection.",1107388800,4,1199,4.376681614349776

Perhaps the political situation that caused this conflict is not thoroughly explored. But it is important to realise that the focus of this story is a very personal one. It is not about the war itself, it about a one man's place within it. Hotel Rwanda is film about the good side of humanity and it shows us that one great person can make a difference.",1107388800,,472,4.375

I was emotionally spent by the end of the film. Even so, I found the brave acts of Paul Rusesabagina to be inspiring.

""Hotel Rwanda"" should have been nominated for a ""Best Picture"" Oscar!  The cast is awesome, especially Don Cheadle.  I hope he wins the ""Best Actor"" Oscar.  My sister and mother have seen this film based on my recommendation.  I've also started telling my friends about it.

2239322,5,B0007R4T3U,"Don Cheadle provides viewers with a central focus and a hero story in HOTEL RWANDA, which also exposes the terrible genocide that took place in Rwanda in 1994. Cheadle's character Paul Rusesabagina is a really, really good and calm four-star hotel manager. And he was able to channel his skills at pleasing guests into improbably saving a thousand refugees during a massacre that Western civilization essentially ignored.

Sophie Okonedo plays Rusesabagina's wife Tatiana, a member of the Tutsi tribe that faces extinction in the massacre. Together Tatiana and Paul - a member of the Hutu tribe - work despite incredible odds to cope with this tragedy and save their family and endangered community.

Okonedo and Cheadle's most powerful scenes, though, come when the Rusesabaginas are forced to discuss what to do should their family be slaughtered. The actors are able to juxtapose the very real love that this husband and wife felt for one another with the absolute horror that they could die at any moment under a machete. One scene on a rooftop reduced me to tears.

There are several bigger-name white actors in the film, namely Nick Nolte, Jean Reno and Joaquin Phoenix, who are able to pull the viewers in, but they are pushed to the sidelines as the story continues.

Cheadle carries the film. He's in almost every scene, and he's magnificent.

But the story of this genocide is horrifying. Though the film isn't unnecessarily bloody, it's a difficult movie to watch, even though the story is a great one.",1107302400,,1513,4.940944881889764
2239323,5,B0007R4T3U,"Not since The Killing Fields or maybe Schindler's List have I experienced a film like Hotel Rwanda.

I went with my girlfriend, and we are both still shaken and humbled, angry and perplexed, days afterwards.

This is a frightening, truly insane, yet heartening and hopeful account of people at our worst and our best. One in this case demands the other.

Without spewing political rhetoric or vitriol and the appropriate cynicism therein, two aspects that Hotel Rwanda inspires, I must say this film demanded of me an account of my life, my priorities, my awareness, my actions, my place in the world, not merely in American society, but my moral responsibilities to all people. In this way it is an  inspiration to action, a call to service.

Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo, both deservedly nominated for an Academy Award, play husband and wife, together holding up the hotel he helps run, and eventually solely runs, as an oasis in civil war ravaged Rwanda.

Against the tide of human violence and destruction similarly recreated in films like The Killing Fields and Schindler's List they must juggle the management of their family, the people there, military and rebel leaders, UN peacekeepers, journalists...

This is a powerful film, emotionally draining, frightening and very, very necessary. Not a Saturday night popcorn blitz, necessarily. More like a matinee with time afterward for reflection and consideration.",1107129600,2,1421,5.1521739130434785
2239324,5,B0007R4T3U,"Within the first ten minutes of this film, viewers around me began to tear up. The crying barely stopped from that moment until the end of the film. But this film is both painful and inspiring, powerful on many levels.

The film stands on its own as an amazing work of art, with an excellent cast. Oscar nominated Don Cheadle in possibly his first starring role is extraordinary. The film works at personalizing the story in a way that Saving Private Ryan did not, and this is in a large part due to Don Cheadle. His character, Paul Rusesabagina, struggles every step of the way over the desire to save his family and his inability to do so at the cost of so many other lives.

The film feels all th more necessary because of the fact that the marjority of these events are largely unknown to most of the world. This film should serve as a wake-up call to many people of how often horrible events are simply ignored and allowed to happen. Hopefully this realization will make more of the world stand up and force their own governments to take appropriate actions to help with similar events around the world.",1107043200,2,1108,4.48019801980198
2239325,5,B0007R4T3U,"Don Cheadle is simply fantastic portraying the courageous Paul Rusesabagina, the hotel manager who risks everything to save the lives of those targeted for death.  Paul naively thinks that the Western World will never allow genocide to take place.  He realizes too late that liberals are inclined toward pacifist remedies.  Also, the fact that some white soldiers would inevitably have to shoot black thugs does not help things.  Political correctness reigns supreme within the halls of the West's liberal institutions.  Paul and his wife Sophie (Tatiana Rusesabagina) are living the good life.  They are educated and economically well off.  The ethnic differences between the Hutu and Tutsi are not relevant to them.  They soon learn that others don't agree.  Some will not hesitate to massacre even the infants of their ethnic opposites.  We watch as the horror unfolds.  It appears that Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte) is able to stop the murderers when push comes to shove.  And yet his superiors will not allow him to employ violence regardless of the circumstances.  This is, needless to add, not escapist entertainment.  I hate to guilt trip anybody, but perhaps it is a moral imperative to see Hotel Rwanda from beginning to end.  Who said that you have a right to look the other way?

Hotel Rwanda should have been made around ten years ago.  Unfortunately, the liberal Hollywood establishment most likely desired to protect both President Bill Clinton and the the ineffective Kofi Annan.  I'm sure that a lot of people wanted to stop the making of Hotel Rwanda.  The United Nations comes across as feckless and impotent.  Why does it exist?  What purpose does it serve?  These are unavoidable questions which will haunt you.  Director Terry George has put together a great film.  I cannot praise him enough.  There is no question but that Hotel Rwanda earns five stars.",1106697600,4,1875,5.009740259740259
2239326,4,B0007R4T3U,"The genocide that occurred in Rwanda in 1994 has not only been largely ignored by most of the political world, but by the cinema world as well.  ""Hotel Rwanda"" is the first major motion picture to document the Rwandan conflict, which was fought between two groups, the Hutus and the Tutsis, with the promulgated goal of the Hutus being to eliminate all inferior Tutsi ""cockroaches.""

The themes of ""Hotel Rwanda"" are reflected through characters. Don Cheadle plays Paul Rusesabagina, a relatively affluent and largely respected man who runs the luxurious Hotel Des Milles Collines, serving many important UN commanders and Hutu military leaders.  Paul is well liked by just about everyone, from both sides of the fence, Hutu and Tutsi, a distinction he finds arbitrary and irrelevant.

When the President of Rwanda is assassinated, chaos breaks out.  Unprofessional militias roam the streets, looking to kill Tutsis, one of whom is Paul's wife.  When the Hutu's come to Paul's neighborhood to slaughter his family and neighbors (but not Paul himself, who is guarded by his Hutu categorization), Paul pays them off and takes his friends to the Milles Collines hotel.

Governance continues to break down.  The high ranking UN coordinator staying at Paul's hotel (Nick Nolte) has little control over the genocide.  Paul and his family know they will probably be killed without intervention from the UN, but the rest of the world ignores what is happening, telling all UN soldiers not to fire on the Hutu army.  Because of the UN's forced ambivalence, Paul is the man people look to for leadership and safety.  His hotel becomes a refuge for Tutsis, providing a precarious shelter that is invariably beset by the threat of eradication.

Don Cheadle is fantastic.  His character displays a kind of emotional weight-a posture, a demeanor, a way of carrying himself.  The gravity of the genocide-something which is hard for anyone to grasp-is presented strongly through Cheadle as we see the emotional pendulum of his psyche swing from confusion to determination, then from contempt to frustration.  Cheadle's character, Paul, is a very smart man, and his reaction to the violence around him is believable, creating a sense of pathos.

But while Cheadle effectively delivers the sad sentiments of ""Hotel Rwanda"", the production at times seems restrained.  I was able to see the effects of genocide on one man and his family, but I never felt like I had even a transient grasp of the genocide itself.  Perhaps it is impossible to fully understand.  Perhaps the slaughter of over one million Rwandans and its secrecy from most of our population is something which can never be fully explained or understood, at least not in the medium of cinema. ""Hotel Rwanda"", with just a two-hour running length, can be partially forgiven for not showing more sides of the conflict.  The Rwandan genocide, like other genocides of the past, cannot be easily summarized.  If genocides can only be presented through film as an emotional idea, then ""Hotel Rwanda"" mostly succeeds.  But a simple emotional feeling still left me slightly empty, giving me a glimpse of the suffering people endure without convincing reasons for the hatred which caused it.",1106611200,,3225,5.068181818181818
2239327,5,B0007R4T3U,"Hotel Rwanda tells the story of Paul Rusesabagina, Hotel Manager at the rich Hotel des Milles Collines in Kigali, Rwanda.  Tensions abound throught the city and country as U.N. peacekeeping forces try to stem off a conflict between the two larger groups in Rwanda: the Hutu government and the Tutsi - whom they despised.  At the beginning of the conflict, Paul holds to his belief that the peace agreement that is to be reached can only bring good things to his country, but when the attrocities begin, he realizes that he needs to get his family to safety.  He manages to bring them to the Hotel where they are trapped until someone from outside Rwanda comes to get them.  But, at least they are safe from the genocide taking place outside the walls of the hotel.

Paul maintains the dignity and decorum of an hotel manager, striving to keep the Hotel as ""an oasis in the dessert.""  But the Tutsi refugees - families, the wounded, orphans - keep pouring in.  The U.N. finally does arrive, but not in the force expected.  Paul then realizes that no one is coming to help them, and through his bravery and determination, through all the explosions, gunfire and body-filled roads, he manages to keep over 1,200 people alive in the semi-safety of the hotel and sees them to safety.

Don Cheadle's performance as Paul Rusesabagina is simply remarkable and heartbreaking.  He gives Paul much dignity and strength in the face of such attrocities happening around him.  Sophie Okonedo also gives a strong and emotional performance as Paul's wife Tatianna.  Other well-known actors make appearances suh as Joaquin Phoenix as a news cameraman and Nick Nolte as the leader of the U.N. Peacekeeping mission.  All this coupled with Terry George's direction make for one of the srongest films of the past year.",1106524800,2,1797,4.814332247557004

Both Tutsis and Hutus are actually Rwandan, however Belgium created a difference between them by measuring the size of their nose and proclaiming them as two different people - even though they actually are not.  You know the drill - divide and conquer.

This movie is based on a true story of a Hutu man who works at a Belgian hotel and tries desperately through bribes to save Tutsi people who are staying inside the hotel.  This movie is very emotional and the acting is well done.  Movies like this are very necessary to watch and see what is going on in the world. While we are sitting in our homes comfortably, there are millions of people around the world who are afraid they will not even live to see the next day.  I urge you instead of watching the latest Hollywood movie where there isn't much to be learned, please watch this important movie.

2239329,5,B0007R4T3U,"This movie is an absolute must see. A crucial film commemorating one of the biggest atrocities of the century. Sadly, at last year's 10 commoration ceremonies not one single Western leader deigned to show up to remember this genocide. (Too busy with other things I guess, like waging war in Iraq...) This movie at least presents us with a blip on our ever-vacant radar screens.

While there have been numerous museums and scores of movies about the German genocide (how would they like it if we called it that? like we do the 'Rwandan genocide') sadly, this will probably be the only movie and publicly-consumed token of remembrance about the Tutsi genocide in Rwanda. Then we will move on to the next atrocity on the world stage...

I am particularly perturbed by all the comments from viewers who complain the movie was ""not graphic enough."" How would viewers 11 years after the Holocaust feel about graphic potrayals of that particular event?! Public outrage!!

In Rwanda, many people were slashed to pieces by machetes... Is that the slasher-type gore that viewers really desire? Is that the type of close-up shot we need in order to respond? In Rwanda? In Darfur? In the Congo? In Northern Uganda? Or is it just another morsel to chew on as we feast on our TV-dinners of violence?",1106265600,6,1285,4.7792792792792795

2239331,5,B0007R4T3U,"The country of Rwanda was having some serious problems in 1994.  The members of the Tutsi tribe in the country were being killed by the Hutu tribe.  In fact, it was more of a massacre (the death toll was around a million), and the world looked on and did nothing.

One man did though.  His name was Paul Rusesabagina (Cheadle).  Paul was a hotel manager, of all things.  He sheltered 1,200 member of the Tutsi tribe in his hotel, despite being a member of the Hutu tribe.  His tribal status, along with knowing how to buy off the right people and manipulate hotel registries is what allowed him to do this good deed.  His main focus was his family, as his wife was Tutsi, and his kids mixed.  But he quickly came to realize that he could make a difference, even if it was small, in this awful conflict.  Calling in favors, Rusesabagina was able to get these refugees to safety with the help of the United Nations.

Don Cheadle has been giving solid performances in smaller roles for years now, establishing himself as a great actor.  ""Hotel Rwanda"" is his chance to really break through.  And break trough he does.  The excellence of this movie is because of him.  He brings tru humanity to a man who does not want to be in the position that he is in.  His struggle to help more than his family is difficult, and Cheadle conveys the difficulty with the grace of a great actor.  He should be nominated for an Oscar, and if he is not, it would be a great shame.

The movie as a whole is disturbing.  The lack of assistance from the global community baffles the mind.  And the fact that one man could take his ""safe"" life in his own hands to save as many as he could is inspiring.  ""Hotel Rwanda"" is about the choices we make as individuals and as countries to do what is right.  This is an excellent film that should be seen by all.

Like another reviewer, I thought the movie actually let the Belgians et al off quite lightly however the sense that we in the West should be ashamed of how we ignored the genocide permeates the entire movie.
