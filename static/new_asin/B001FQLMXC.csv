8302356,4,B001FQLMXC,"Although limited in communication skills, my 16yo autistic son LOVES to listen to other languages ... I am pretty sure in our VAST collection of DVD's, that we own every Bilingual Baby ever produced.  I myself haven't watch it, as watching a DVD with my son is PURE torture, as he has little snippets that he likes and he will play them CONTINUALLY. However, based on the times he has ""viewed"" it - I'd say it was a good purchase.",1470700800,,430,4.375

8302358,2,B001FQLMXC,"The pedagogical method used for teaching Hebrew in this video leaves much to be desired.

However, let me say a few positive things about this video:

My 22-month-old daughter LOVES this video. It is similar to Baby Einstein, which she also loves; but it has the added benefit of actually teaching some Hebrew words. So, it has more educational value than Baby Einstein, though it is based on the same principles of having lots of children and objects moving on the screen to (basically) classical music.

So, if you have to choose between Baby Einstein - or a similar product - and this, this definitely has some advantages.  My daughter was readily repeating Hebrew words at her first viewing.

From a language-learning standpoint, however, the presentation is flawed.

Here is the basic set-up:

Each section is introduced by three words, which are repeated several times with images showing those words in action. Then the three words are put into a sentence.

For example:

The words ""boy,"" ""eat"" and ""apple"" are introduced; then they are put into a sentence: ""The boy* eats the apple.""

*Technically, the video says, ""A boy..."" instead of ""the boy...,"" but this is a somewhat minor point.

If you look closely at the example, you can see the problem, which is a bit more pronounced in Hebrew:

The first section introduces the words ""Yeled"" (boy), ""le'echol"" (""to eat""), and ""tapuach"" (""apple"").

Then these are put together into the sentence: ""Yeled OCHEL ET HAtapuach.""

NOTICE that the form ""OCHEL"" (""eats"") looks nothing like the infinitive form ""le'echol"" taught in the first part of the example.

So, kids watching this video will not learn to put words together into sentences.

Here's another example from the video:

Kelev (dog), lesachek (to play, an infinitive) kadur (ball)
Kelev mesachek im hakadur (A dog is playing with the ball. Notice that in the example, the verb changes to a participle, the preposition ""im"" [""with""] is added, and the article ""ha"" [""the""] also gets magically prefixed to the noun.

So, there's a big ""disconnect"" between how the vocab gets put into the sentences.

In fact, by using the Latin alphabet, the individual words look nothing like the examples in the sentences.  If the Hebrew alphabet had been used, this problem would have been alleviated somewhat, but I will simply confine my second criticism to this:

2. The Hebrew alphabet is not used. Frankly, that baffles me, because (I know from personal experience that) knowing the alphabet makes learning Hebrew so much easier.

If you want your kid to learn the Hebrew alphabet, go with Shalom Sesame.

In fact, if you want your child to actually learn Hebrew, Shalom Sesame is a good place to start.",1304726400,9,2702,4.929203539823009
8302359,3,B001FQLMXC,"I have been speaking Hebrew to my 1.5 year old daughter since she was born.  While watching this video with her, I noticed that it definitely helped cement a few more words into her head.  Also, as you get further into the dvd they teach the children how to string words together into sentences, making it appropriate for children as they grow and develop their language skills.
However, it becomes a little monotonous after a while.  The woman's voice doesn't change, and the background music which is classical, also becomes slightly grating after a while.
Having worked in the field of children's cd roms and videos for many years, I think they could've varied the vignettes.  Perhaps incorporating puppet shows and different  narrative voices throughout, making it less monotonous.  There is so much potential in these videos, which I feel they didn't utilize.
All in all, it's okay.  Not sure it's worth the $23.00, but i've done much research and it's really the only product like this on the market.",1261699200,3,1006,4.882352941176471
