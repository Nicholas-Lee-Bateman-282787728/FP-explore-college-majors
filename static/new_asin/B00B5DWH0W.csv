5559320,4,B00B5DWH0W,Many old rockers struggle to perform the music that made them famous.  Peter Frampton is one of those few exceptions.  Though he certainly looks different today his performance in this concert is top-notch.  This DVD is certainly worth your time and money. Don't miss it!,1371772800,,271,4.977777777777778
5559321,5,B00B5DWH0W,"Not only this is a great concert, but also it was recorded and filmed like only a few of other high-definition titles I own. Don't get me wrong; this was filmed many years ago, but maybe the equipment they used was something like..... ""state-of-the-art"". I can possibly say it is even better than the FCA!35 Blu-Ray. Yes, I mean it! Great setlist, the band is amazing and Peter, as always, is a wonderful person on stage, adressing the audience with a sense of intimacy and pleasure. He is a great guy, we all know that. Buy it, right now!",1371340800,,539,4.454545454545454
5559322,5,B00B5DWH0W,I hadnt seen or heard peter frampton for a few years so naturally was a treat to sit down and have a fra.pton show that was not a disappointment musically very good even the band was awesome a real treat in bluray thankyou,1369958400,,222,4.186046511627907
5559323,5,B00B5DWH0W,"This 1998 concert in Detroit is classic Frampton, with lots of his old time hits and some really great new stuff (not all new stuff is great with older bands!).  The Blu Ray quality is top notch, as I had the original DVD version and this really knocks your socks off in terms of resolution.  The audio recording is perfect, excellent dynamic range as you would expect and terrific in a dedicated theater room like mine.  His rapport with the audience makes him the showman he is, and really brings back memories of my first concert seeing him in 1976 when his Frampton Comes Alive album debuted.  Of course, back then he had a bit more hair!",1368489600,3,642,4.461538461538462
5559324,5,B00B5DWH0W,"Peter Frampton is one of the most under-rated guitar players. Since the original live album was only recorded in audio, this is a good way to see what was going on...",1367193600,,166,4.387096774193548
5559325,5,B00B5DWH0W,If you are a Framptom fan you will like this show he is a great front man. His voice and the audio and blu-ray picture were great.,1367193600,,130,3.8518518518518516
5559326,5,B00B5DWH0W,"Im a long time fan of Peter Frampton. As a teenager I'd listen to him over and over and I did not get tired of any of his music. Now that I have him on Blueray , I'll enjoy watching him over and over until my machine breaks down. Peter Frampton.... You the man...",1366416000,,263,3.888888888888889
5559327,5,B00B5DWH0W,"i LOVE this video... have the BR as well as the normal DVD (my office isn't BR so this is one of a few items I have duplicated formats on!). Unlike the new FCA 35 set and tour this features Peter's long time right hand man Bob Mayo on keys/gtr and John Regan on Bass.... as well as the brilliant Chad Cromwell on drums. I like this band better than his newer one and boy were they smokin' on this night. Peter's guitar playing is often overshadowed by his one time status as the Justin Beiber/flavor of the month and that is a shame because he is a killer player and this set is a testament to that.  Brandishing a couple of very tasty Les Paul guitars his tone and touch and taste are on full display and the camera work is great , the audience was into it and I've watched this a half dozen times in the last week!

the bonus interview of a half an hour is worth watching and the bonus clip from FCA 35 is also a nice bonus... altogether a terrific value!!  HIGHLY recommended",1364947200,4,978,4.136842105263158
5559328,5,B00B5DWH0W,"This is a re-release of Peter's DVD of the same title that was released in 2000. It's been out of print for a while and commanded a high price if you could find it. Not anymore.

As I stated in my reply to a review here by Long Time Home Theater Guy, I bought the blu ray of Frampton's FCA tour. It was good and I enjoyed it immensely, but THIS concert is the one to have. I can't explain it, but this Detroit disc blows the FCA show away. I'm not taking anything away from that release either. It was worth every dime.

On top of all that, the picture and sound on this release is stunning.",1364428800,16,591,4.0
5559329,5,B00B5DWH0W,"Have long enjoyed the initial DVD release&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peter-Frampton-Live-in-Detroit/dp/6305837074/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peter Frampton - Live in Detroit</a>&nbsp;from Image Entertainment since perhaps 2004.  The DVD's 16x9 aspect ratio visuals were normally bright, clean and colorful whenever the stage or crowd was well lit.  Held up quite well under low light conditions with only a slight increase in video noise throughout the overall picture.  Pretty typical musical concert stage coverage that won't distract your enjoyment of the performance especially during the close-ups of Peter, the members of his band, or the crowd.  The increased resolution of Blu-ray will only be a plus here.

The DVD audio offered a choice of either Dolby Digital or DTS (both 5.1) playback technology with the latter being my preference.  Even at -20 db on the volume control, the simulation of being there was excellent and I can't wait to experience my favorite classic songs from Peter again (Show Me The Way, Baby I love Your Way, Do You Feel Like We Do) with the expected increase in dynamic range via the new lossless audio tracks available on Blu-ray.  Though recorded a decade earlier than Peter's latest Blu-ray (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fca-35-Tour-An-Evening-With-Peter-Frampton-Blu-ray/dp/B009DT98RK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fca 35 Tour: An Evening With Peter Frampton [Blu-ray</a>]) release from Eagle Rock, if anywhere close, should still sound spectacular.  As a side note, if you've never experienced true concert hall sound levels at home that stays clean and clear at ""elevated"" volume levels powered by appropriate audio equipment,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fca-35-Tour-An-Evening-With-Peter-Frampton-Blu-ray/dp/B009DT98RK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fca 35 Tour: An Evening With Peter Frampton [Blu-ray</a>]) is on my very small list of recommended Blu-ray titles you should sample.  The final mix is a great example of how every Blu-ray concert performance should sound.

From Eagle Rock Entertainment's website, the track listing is as follows:

1.  Baby (Something's Happening)
2.  Lying
3.  Lines on My Face
4.  Show Me the Way
5.  All I Wanna Be (is by your side)
6.  If You Say Goodbye
7.  Oh For Another Day
8.  Penny for Your Thoughts
9.  (I'll give you) Money
10. Nassua
11. Baby I Love Your Way
12. Can't Take That Away
13. Do You Feel Like We Do
14. Off the Hook
15. You Had to be There
16. I Don't Need No Doctor
17. Gemini
18. Boot It Up

While I usually never write a review until actually having sampled the final product, knowing well the original source material along with the Eagle Rock's production standards in the past, gives me great confidence in highly recommending this title.  Should it not be, I won't hesitate to be back and update this rating and review.  If you've been around like I have since his Frampton Come Alive album debuted in the 1970's, this Blu-ray will definitely hit all the right notes with you.",1360022400,10,3112,5.702819956616052

5559334,4,B00B5DWH0W,I think the Frampton Comes Alive 2 was better than this DVD. I saw the reviews for this one and wanted it for my collection. The one thing about this one is Bob Mayo is on it and he died after this series of concerts. It's good to see him in both DVDs as a youngster and then in his 40s/50s. The sound and video is better in FCA2.,1479686400,,330,3.7971014492753623

5559349,5,B00B5DWH0W,"I saw Peter Framptom twice at the Sports Complexes in Kanas City, Missouri. They were called Summer Jams back then in the late seventies. They would have like five major bands at each one and I believe Peter Frampton was the Head-Liner at both. I heard he was in a motorcycle wreck a while back, but he still sounds as good as he did back in the late seventies.",1431648000,,361,4.246376811594203

5559365,5,B00B5DWH0W,"This blu ray is Great!!! Frampton is polished, greased and ready to kick butt. He is an artist and guitarist that has definitely still got it. Many artist lose that ""umph"" over the years, but not Frampton. Though his looks have changed he still has that boyish voice and his guitar playing is phenomenal and better than ever. If you liked Frampton in the past, you will love this recording. Unfortunately, Bob Mayo is no longer with us in this life, but he has got to be mentioned. He played for Frampton many years, and his talents (vocals, guitar and keyboard) on this disc are nothing short of great. Technically, this disc sounds great as well. As mentioned earlier, if you liked him in the past, ya gotta love this disc. He's better than ever. GED",1377129600,4,752,4.536764705882353

After all these years, the guy's still got it.  Plus I'm from Detroit and Pine Knob holds a special place...a great outdoor concert venue.

Buy it.",1374624000,2,320,4.642857142857143
5559367,5,B00B5DWH0W,"I was so glad this was reissued.  Peter can still rock and the production value of this concert video is as high as the performance is excellent. The musicianship is superb - the band was enjoying the show as much as the crowd.  Sure, there were a lot of 40- and 50-somethings out there in the audience, so the energy wasn't as high as when they saw Frampton in their teens and twenties, but they did well for a bunch of old folks.  Yes, I fit the demographic.

For all of you guitar players out there the producers have made the wise decision to show lots of closeups of Frampton's hands as he plays.  Like his music or not, his technique is effortless and productive and interesting to watch.

Frampton's playing hasn't fallen off over the years and they put on a good show in Detroit that year.  If you liked Frampton when you were younger you will like this concert.  If you are a young whippersnapper looking for some good guitar work and a demonstration of how a group of musicians can really get it together as a band you will like this concert.",1374451200,,1052,4.358974358974359
5559368,5,B00B5DWH0W,"I thought for a while to find a simple word: Rejuvenated

Both PQ and AQ are excellent. Classic hits ""Baby I love your way"" momentary turn back the clock. My personal opinion on ""I don't need no doctor"" is superior than the john Mayer version. Worth the bucks.",1373068800,2,260,4.416666666666667
5559369,3,B00B5DWH0W,"The video quality and sound is very good as you would expect from blu-ray. I guess I was hoping for too much from the performance. While Peter Frampton's enthusiasm and showmanship is still there, he is quite a bit less than I remembered.",1372464000,,238,4.558139534883721
8562849,5,B00B5DWH0W,I think this is Frampton's best live performance. If you listen back to back with the Frampton Comes Alive concert i think you'll agree it doesn't  compare to this performance. With years of performing behind him most of the songs sound much more seasoned. The audio and picture are great and his guitar sound and playing is fantastic.  The three great encores were icing on the cake. A must have for any music fan.,1522540800,,415,4.594594594594595
