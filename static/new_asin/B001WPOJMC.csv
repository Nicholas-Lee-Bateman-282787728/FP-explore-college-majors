8585388,1,B001WPOJMC,"This SUCKS!  I Love Woodstock; but the hippies were in charge of creating this DVD and creating the menus.  Basically there are no chapters. It's chapters 1-4 and 5-8, etc... You just have to keep skipping forward until you find what you want and the start of every chapter is some hippie talking about the acid he just dropped.  It's impossible unless you look at the list from the cover and you know what comes next and even then many are preceded by hippies telling stories so you're not sure where you are,  5 stars for the music and 0 stars for the organization. Never buy a ""Director's Cut"" of anything.  Most directors are too full of themselves.",1442016000,,653,4.5
