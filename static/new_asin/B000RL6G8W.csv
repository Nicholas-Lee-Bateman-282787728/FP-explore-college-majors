2869406,5,B000RL6G8W,"These movies and TV shows have been reproduced in excellent quality, especially since I originally saw them on a 12"" round screen TV over 60 years ago. It's fun to relive the days when boys had role models who didn't drink, smoke, cuss, or disrespect women and they could wear toy guns to school without a need to destroy something. It's also interesting to see how much the Hollywood agenda has changed in that time. A great companion piece is the book by Mrs. Cassidy (Grace Boyd) and Michael Cochran, Hopalong Cassidy, An American Legend.",1229040000,14,541,4.705263157894737

Mulford's stories, they strived in changing Cassidy's image, which was both original and influential --- the hero, played by William Lawrence Boyd, was mature and a man of his word --- the plots were solid with a sudden burst of climactic action in the last reel, usually a frantic chase backed by tension building music.

Hoppy with his down-to-earth humor and sentimentality, theses scenes are pure Americana! --- Boyd, with his silver hair, black clothes and white horse (Topper) rode into our lives and we've never been the same since --- your children and grandchildren will enjoy this clean wholesome entertainment --- Hoppy always wore two silver white handle six shooters, never drank or smoked, when the good guys always won and the moral to the story was fair-play -- outstanding role model.

Dennis Weaver narrates with extensive comments from Hoppy's widow, Grace Bradley Boyd and film critic Leonard Maltin. This documentary is featured on Disc #4 and I highly recommend that it be viewed before watching the films and TV episodes.

The technical quality of all the films and television episodes is EXCELLENT: sharp picture, clear audio.

Each of the 12 discs are individually packaged in a keepsake case, each one featuring a different photo of Hoppy on the front.

2869412,5,B000RL6G8W,"Many younger western fans may not be that familiar with Hopalong Cassidy and/or William Boyd.  Here's a brief background sketch of William Boyd, and his most famous role -- that of Hopalong ""Hoppy"" Cassidy.  Boyd was a major star in the silent era of Hollywood films, but had the unfortunate fate of having the same name as the infamous William ""Stage"" Boyd -- an actor who was blacklisted because of activity which violated the ""morals clause"" of his film contract.  When ""Stage"" Boyd's fate was published in a major daily newspaper, the editor inserted the future William ""Hopalong Cassidy"" Boyd's mug instead of ""Stage"" Boyd's picture.  As a result Boyd (""Hoppy"") could only find work in poverty row productions for more than five years.  However, in 1935 Boyd landed the plum part of ""Hoppy"" Cassidy in a series of Paramount 70-minute features.  He went on to play the part of ""Hoppy"" in 66 feature films.  In the early 1950's, Boyd (as Cassidy) would again become a major entertainment personality when he made 52 one-half hour westerns for NBC (including many which were truncated versions of his feature films).  In the 1950-51 season alone, Hopalong Cassidy was rated the #9 program in the country.  In this set you will receive all 52 TV programs, in addition to 10 feature length films (many of which have not been previously released on dvd).  The programs and features are in excellent condition (almost perfectly restored sound and video quality) and you will receive untold hours of viewing enjoyment.  I wasn't yet born when the ""Hoppy"" craze swept the country, but it has been a joy watching these dvd's.  Many of the top western villains of the 30's, 40's, and 50's, are featured in these shows -- I. Stanford Jolley, Victor Jory, Glenn Strange, Roy Barcroft, even Robert Mitchum.  Of course, ""Hoppy"" sidekicks such as George ""Gabby"" Hayes and Edgar Buchanan are along for the ride too.  If you were a fan of ""The Cisco Kid,"" ""The Roy Rogers Show,"" ""The Gene Autry Show,"" ""The Lone Ranger,"" and ""Annie Oakley,"" then you will be thrilled with this collection!",1187568000,71,2075,4.841359773371105
