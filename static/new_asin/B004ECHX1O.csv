The majority of it consists of interviews with a dominant octogenarian who seems to be convinced that the olden days were covered in honey and that she's the primary source for truth and knowledge. It's only with some reluctance that she allows her husband to have a few words because it's pretty evident that she loves the attention and wants everyone else to think that her anecdotes are the most entertaining. Despite sounding like an unlikable sort, the twinkle in her eye somewhat softens her character and helps to lure in listeners. Some of what she has to say about her life and family matters is interesting, no doubt, but most of what she has to say can be heard from the mouth of just about any grandmother.

FamilyStrip is short, but sometimes as she prattles on and on, one wishes it was shorter, or, at least funnier. The funniest part, by the way, is what her husband has to say about the portrait that's recently been painted of the pair and their son. (2.5 stars)",1507161600,,1044,4.612903225806452
