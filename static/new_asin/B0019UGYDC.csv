3444225,4,B0019UGYDC,I very much enjoy these DVD's! I only had one problem - one of the DVD's makes a clicking noise when it is playing. That's the only reason I didn't give a 5 star rating. I did not contact the seller which would have probably replaced them. It was my decision to keep them. I still enjoy them very much!,1272412800,3,302,4.05

3444227,5,B0019UGYDC,"This package is a compilation of two separate ""best-of"" the Little Rascals DVDs, sold together at a deep discount.

As the title makes clear (and to reiterate my comments from each independent disc), these DVDs are unique in that they provide a color Little Rascals experience.  As I understand it, favorite and famous Rascals shorts were cherry-picked to be beneficiaries of this color process, and were then compiled in these collector's sets.

I see the benefits of this process as being primarily twofold: one, it's a new way to re-experience beloved and familiar material.  Two, it's a great way to introduce the classics to the younger, color-biased generation.  Plus, frankly, the price (as of this writing) can't be beat.",1230595200,18,729,5.092436974789916

3444257,5,B0019UGYDC,"This review is of the two-DVD Colorized and Black and White release from Legend Films. Lots to get excited about here. Purists (I appreciate) frown at colorization. For me though, I stand amazed at the technology and efforts in this regard. I view colorized versions as new movies, in a way. Legend Films provides astoundingly great results here! Picture and audio are superb. Plus, at click of a menu button you can choose B/W viewing. Is it better visually than turning the color on the TV down to provide B/W? Not sure, but it is convenient. All episodes on the two DVD's are entertaining as heck! (There, to be fair, is a modest dash of politically incorrect content. An unfortunate sign of the times. Might make this PG as opposed to G rated). I didn't recall Spanky starring as such a little kid! They are all so good and professional! With this single release, Legend Films is on my radar as a producer of quality video works. In closing, I MUST mention the extras! Very cool! How about a roughly 2 min. B/W clip of an ""on studio lot"" go cart race: Jackie Cooper, Groucho, and Harpo! With Charles Laughton as official checkered-flag waver at the finish line! Also, preview footage (color) of a Shirley Temple (1957 or so) show of various Fairy Tales starring the former curly-top and a truly notable and ecclectic array of cast players including Michael Rennie, Jonathon Winters, Angela Cartwright, Martin Landau, Nina Foch, and others staging ""Winnie The Pooh"", ""The Little Mermaid"" and other tales. Trust me. You'll breeze through both DVD's in no time. Wall-to-Wall fun. This set could EASILY create new fans of ""Our Gang"" single-handedly. Terrific Purchase! Exceeded my expectations in every regard! With stuff like this, Legend Films may indeed become ""Legend""-ary.",1375833600,3,1777,4.887417218543046
3444258,5,B0019UGYDC,"Haven't seen the little rascal in over twenty years, I whole heartedly thank you for bring a little bit of my childhood back, will with out a doubt buy from you guys again, an absolute pleasure",1369440000,,193,4.388888888888889
3444259,3,B0019UGYDC,"I was disappointed that the original cast of Spanky, Buckwheat, Alfalfa, etc. we're not in these discs.  They are pictured on the cover, so I naturally expected that they were featured!",1368921600,7,185,4.967741935483871
3444260,5,B0019UGYDC,"This was great! Brings back childhood memories. The re-make is no match for the originals.

Four of my grandkids, ages 10 to 5, finally watched & enjoyed some episodes; others were boring to them.",1517184000,,248,4.533333333333333
8275369,5,B0019UGYDC,These are so funny.  No cgi no animation no nothing but pure physical comedy.  FLY MY KITE is as funny as it gets.  The grandma doing to back flips & diving out a second story window is hilarious.  There was no way they could fake that in 1931!,1514160000,,244,4.020833333333333
