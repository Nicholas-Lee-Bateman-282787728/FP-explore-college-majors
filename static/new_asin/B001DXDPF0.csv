8295324,4,B001DXDPF0,"The season that was by and far the most fun of the entire show. And the best acted. Everyone regular knew their characters so well by now. This is also the final season with Stevenson as the just slightly bumbling camp CO Col. Blake. The very final ep with him delivered and still delivers a double-whammy to most viewers. On other points. Throughout this season there will be bad put downs of the democratic Republic of Korea (South Korea), picking on the US for the war (the war that in reality North Korea completely started--old Soviet documents testify heavily to this) and more rather evil writing. So remember this season like all of this series is rather pro-communist (and defends the in-reality very bad (and very guilty) regime of North Korea).

PS For more on the Soviet documents--see the book ""Forgotten War Remembered, Korea"" by Bill Shinn. Book also here at amazon.",1512172800,,881,4.796052631578948
