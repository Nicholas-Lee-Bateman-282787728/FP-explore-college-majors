8489118,4,B005Y5NIKK,"You'll need a region-free code-free DVD player with a built-in PAL converter to play this in the US.  (These can be found fairly easily and relatively inexpensively online, by the way.)  Fine transfers and sound.  Why these have never been released domestically I never will understand.  Subtitles can be eliminated by scrolling through the four languages until the 'none' option is available.  Well worth it if you enjoyed the series.

The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five is that one episode is missing from season 3, the one where Ricky Nelson sings ""Garden Party.""  I suspect music rights, but who knows.

Fine US seller and shipping, by the way.  The only other alternatives are to try to order from Europe (which will be much more expensive).  These have also been released in Australia; again, much more expensive and you'll still need the international DVD player I described.",1329177600,3,902,4.913907284768212
8489119,3,B005Y5NIKK,This set does not include The New Mexican Connection (the episode where Rick Nelson sings Garden Party)! Otherwise the quality is acceptable for a non remastered series from the seventies.,1328659200,2,188,5.3
