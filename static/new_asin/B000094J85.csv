8415160,5,B000094J85,i've never acually saw this dvd but the comment by Brian Hocum is rediculous. getting an artist in put on something is to better understand where they're coming from or where they're writing. and if anyone knew anything about thrice they would know that they contribute money frome each record to orgunizations even after they left sub city record. so don't be so closed minded and listen to what they're talking about cuz aparently they have better things to say then you.,1155600000,,473,4.780487804878049
8415161,1,B000094J85,"save money and go to dollar store and buy a hammer and beat your foot for a few minutes to get the same feeling you get as listening to these terrible recordings. And why do they interview these bands,I want music if I want a narrative I will read a book

by a great author of expert. I don't care what they think about poverty I want music. If you have to buy Hawthorne Heights or New Found Glory .  Why can't Thrice put out a good concert dvd?",1138579200,,445,3.9887640449438204
