1745716,5,B00006FDD9,"I loved this film to distraction.
We stand guilty before Tupac of one thing: that films like Tupac Vs. did not come earlier. But this is a cross we will have to bear. See this film! To understand how fall turns into flight.",1033257600,8,223,4.209302325581396
1745717,4,B00006FDD9,"Really good film!  This movie has a great interview with Tupac while he was in prison that I'd never seen before.  There's also alot of really cool visuals.  I've always liked his music, but this movie shows how much intelligence and depth the guy had.  I see him in a totally different light. Definitely worth checking out if you're even a slight Tupac fan.",1031875200,10,358,4.546875
1745718,4,B00006FDD9,"This movie really surprised me, I didn't expect to like it. It hooked me from the first moment on. Not exactly a fan, I thought I had clear picture of 2pac and what he was (or wasn't), but after viewing this film I realized I had only gotten half the scoop. I was lucky enough to have seen a press screener where I work, and I can't wait to see the DVD when its released.",1031529600,12,371,3.96
1745719,4,B00006FDD9,I saw an advance screener copy of this last week and I can't stop thinking about it. I've probably seen everything made about Tupac Shakur and this is by far the most entertaining of the bunch. It paints a conflicting picture of a guy everybody thinks they know. It also gives a cool historical point of view (most of which I had no idea about.) Bravo for giving us something other than another rehash of the Death Row soap opera!,1031184000,6,430,4.3875
1745720,1,B00006FDD9,"Let's see if I understand; I'm supposed to get all choked up when a no-talent, gangbanging thug gets whacked? Growing up listening to Sly Stone, Hendrix, Stevie Wonder and Motown, I find it appalling at how black music has decayed and pop culture praises a punk like Tupac.
About fifty years ago there was a TV show called ""Amos & Andy."" It was previously a comedic radio show about 2 black men and various black characters. The radio show was famous and was loved by both blacks and whites. When the radio show was turned into a TV show, the NAACP and other black groups were outraged at how blacks were portrayed as silly and undignified. The show was eventually taken off the air. These days, we now have a form of music that portrays black youths as nothing but gang banging, drug dealing killers who see women as nothing but bitches and ""ho's."" Do we see black organizations outraged? No, rap music is defended and embraced by all.
Too bad I am forced to give this [artist] one star instead of none. Giving recording contracts to gang members is like giving whiskey to the Indians.",1030579200,4,1086,4.545918367346939
1745791,2,B00006FDD9,"Another 2pac Documentary basically. same research,same matters, some things not on other dvds/vhs. it's worth renting first to check out. I have the vhs. Ok if your a tupac fan.",1244937600,,177,4.933333333333334

1745793,4,B00006FDD9,"This documentary is pretty good. It's really interesting, it shows a lot of footage of Tupac. The people interviewed have some really interesting things to say too. Overall, this is a good documentary on the late, great, Tupac Shakur, and any Tupac fan should have this in their collection; but if you're just getting into Tupac, try Tupac: Ressurrection first. Tupac Vs.: two thumbs up!

--Tupac's #1 Fan

1745794,5,B00006FDD9,"Some critics of this artist believe that they are slick by saying that Tupac makes blacks look ""dumb"" and goes further to say that ""blacks are NOT dumb"". First of all, I'm black and we don't need other people to define what is intellectually acceptable for us. Thank you. He was a performer, an artist, a poet. NEWSFLASH! Sometimes in America, performers, artists, and poets are idolized and respected. In my opinion, Americans need to consider the cessation of 2 things: the criticism of the intelligence of artists and their fans(let them choose what they like) AND creating the imaginary scale which defines what a ""smart black"" and a ""dumb black"" is. Non-blacks should not perpetuate the idea that ""the hip hop artist of the week"" is responsible for the rest of the country's opinion of black intelligence. You ARE insulting our intelligence when you say things like that. Most Americans of all races know that Tupac is not the model of black authenticity. Black people don't walk around saying Kurt Cobaine (of Nirvana) was a junky that made white people look like junkies. (If they listened to his music, they might call Kurt a genius.) Keep an open mind, my friend.",1097280000,7,1172,4.806930693069307
1745795,5,B00006FDD9,"When I see a Tupac Documentary, I want to see something that represents him well. I want something that is good for fans, critics, and casual onlookers all at the same time. I want something that highlights his intelligence, and complexity, and depth, and significance. I want something that makes me proud to be a Tupac fan. I want something pretty much free of cursing. I want something that makes we want to share it with everyone. I want something that helps people understand why I'm so into him. I want something that could potentially turn someone on to Tupac. TUPAC VS. delivers on all those fronts. It's basically what I wanted and expected from ThugAngel, but didn't get.
A major part of the content is an interview done in 1995 shortly before he was released from prison, and right before he headed to Death Row. He's not smoking, not drinking, not cursing ----- just talking like the mature, intelligent, educated person that he is so capable of being. The tone of the interview was kinda like the brief interview that appears as an extra on the Gang Related DVD.
To really understand a huge part of who Tupac was and what he came from I HIGHLY recommend a movie that was put out in about 1994 by Mario Van Peebles called BLACK PANTHER. You can't understand Tupac until you really understand the history of the Black Panther Party.",1066348800,26,1343,4.623430962343096
1745796,5,B00006FDD9,"i have not seen the dvd yet but i am gonna get it on pay day.i have supported anything that showed the real pac that fans didn't know and how smart he was.listen to the lyrics not the beat and you will hear how much he loved his people,& friends.buy this dvd and you will see why he was doing what he was doing.support the tupac amaru shakur center for arts. R.I.P.PAC YOUR MEMORY LIVES ON.",1063497600,3,390,4.144736842105263
1745797,5,B00006FDD9,"Tupac Vs has really good footage of 2Pac in concert, the Outlawz and some of the then-Death Row staff. Loved the interview with 'Pac in jail. Some of the stuff he says will shock the hell out of you. He really is a legend and a prophet.
Only thing that bugged me about the documentary was them freaken commentators. That Dyson girl and Elihu maggot write a book about 'Pac and all of a sudden they think they're experts. Man, if you didn't know him personally then stop showing up on dvds. They just annoy you and spoil the whole video. Mopreme would have been a much better option.",1046044800,5,582,4.348623853211009
