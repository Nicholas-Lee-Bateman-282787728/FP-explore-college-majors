8450411,5,B004ZRI8UI,"A normal high school boy Kisaragi Ryuji's peaceful life is turned into an adventure by the return of his second cousin Eriko. Ryuji and Eriko seize a relic box from a black broker. In the box, they find a red dragon girl named Rose. In order to protect Rose from the black organization, Ryuji decides to fight using his power as a relic handler.
  It's actually not a bad story line Ryuji is a a relic handler and uses his powers to help others in need. Relics are magical items mostly from the past that can be used for good or evil. Has cute girls several that are in love with Ryuji. A cousin who's over the top in her actions and bad guys always after Rose.
  I've rated it 5 stars because I enjoyed it and will watch again. And please note writing reviews is not my forte.",1318204800,2,777,4.194630872483222
