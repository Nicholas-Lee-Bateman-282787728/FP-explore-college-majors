There are however swords in film...and some good fights.  I purchased SALVATION along with JA Steel's first movie THE THIRD SOCIETY after reading about her in Curve Magazine and on Yahoo! Entertainment news.  Yahoo! called her ""the female Roger Corman""...so I had to check it out myself.

An interesting plot about good and evil, and personal redemption.  Some good lines...watch out for those safety razors! :)  JA Steel does it all again...write, direct, produce, act, edit...all on a shoe string budget.  This gal certainly has spirit!  SALVATION did not have the dramatic footage of THE THIRD SOCIETY's gun battle action and big toys...however, it was a much more personal look at the woman who continues to defy the norms in Hollywood and make the movies she wants....and she looks good in that black leather outfit!  I bought a second copy of SALVATION to share. :)

I saw in the IMBD that she is working on a third feature film called DENIZEN...I had to look up the word...it means ""inhabitant"".  She is moving into SciFi for this round...looking forward to adding it to my JA Steel library when it is listed on Amazon.",1255737600,,1294,4.912442396313364
