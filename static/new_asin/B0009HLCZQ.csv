8060929,2,B0009HLCZQ,"First of all, this Alpha print of ""Daughter of the Tong"" is washed out and blurry throughout, making the film hard to watch. And the plot of the film is washed out, too.

Films that center around Chinatown are supposed to be mysterious, exotic, and exciting. In those areas,""Daughter of the Tong"" strikes out. For one thing, this Poverty Row ""thriller"" plods along with almost no action.

Evelyn Brent plays Carney, the leader of a gang that is headquartered in a hotel on the edge of Chinatown. I guess that's why we see so little of Chinatown and so much of the interior of a hotel, mainly the lobby and the threadbare room where Carney oversees her operations.

The few attempts to make Evelyn Brent appear to be Asian are to fit her with a black wig cut in a page boy, and to provide her with a nondescript Asian-style dress. That's it. Also, Ms. Brent makes no attempt at having any type of accent other than to speak in a growl. She also spends most of her screen time sitting behind a desk and handing out orders to her motley crew of henchmen.

Grant Withers plays the FBI agent who volunteers to impersonate one of the gang members who escaped from prison, but has yet to make his way back to Carney's lair. Withers just looks tired and bored in this film. George O'Brien, another Poverty Row regular, doesn't put out much effort, either.

The only mystery in ""Daughter of the Tong"" is trying to find the missing story in this dreary little programmer. Is there a good detective in the house?",1320710400,,1501,4.483516483516484
8060930,5,B0009HLCZQ,"I paid about twenty bucks for my set new, and I am glad I bought them, having alot of the other mill creek sets, I knew there was alot of 30's crime drama movies, of which alot of them are ""pre code"", the lame obscenity codes inacted about 1934 by bible thumpers, and though I haven't watched all the movies, there are some really interesting ones, like the 1932 ""The Thirteenth Guest"", a crime mystery, and some horror flicks, like ""Carnage"", etc.
You get Bloody Pit of Horror, a fairly decent transfer seen on other mill creek sets, much better here than a St Claire Vision ""Horrorlicious"" 13 hours+ and nine movies set I received recently.  So far I haven't found any problems with the discs, scanned through alot of them, a couple of the discs had a strange swirl look to the top of the dvd surface, but they played fine, I scanned through all those, and they are just fine.",1286323200,2,878,4.419753086419753
8060931,4,B0009HLCZQ,"Most of these movies are old 1930's/'40's/'50's ""B"" movies. If you like poverty row stuff, you'll probably enjoy most of this box set. Otherwise, try the original 50 Horror Classics box. Also, there are three graphically violent movies from the 1970s and 1980s on the 4th disc,so watch out-they're pretty gross.",1231372800,5,311,5.117647058823529
8060932,2,B0009HLCZQ,"I've picked up several ""50 movie packs"" and even the ""250 horror movie pack"" and have been very pleased, over all.  This set, however, was rather rough.  The movies are all really bad in just about every way imaginable.  Unless you want bad B-Movie quality softcore lameness, go elsewhere for entertainment.",1223769600,2,307,4.980392156862745
8060933,5,B0009HLCZQ,"Night Screams is a collection of 50 horror movies that have only one thing in common: they are all public domain and as such it is possible for them to be presented in highly affordable collections. I paid $21.99 for my set and that comes down to about 44 cents per movie. The way that movie tickets cost nowadays, you really cannot complain about this collection.

This deal is even better when you consider that many of the movies in this collection are available as individual movie DVD's at prices of $5 and higher. Many of the movies in this collection are presented in better condition than they are from other DVD companies.

All in all, a great deal for the money.",1216080000,4,672,4.5
8060934,3,B0009HLCZQ,"I just want to point out that most, if not all, the movies are also included in 250 pack from the same company. I checked this movie by movie :) Depending on your purchase plan, that one might represent better bargain.",1207353600,22,218,4.341463414634147
8060935,3,B0009HLCZQ,"What's unusual about this collection is the somewhat strange variety of types and ages of movies featured. You get some really old (1930s and 40s) films like ""A Face in the Fog"" and ""A Shot in the Dark"", then some newer (1970s) movies like ""Grave of the Vampire"" and ""Carnage"". Some of the older ones I would definitely not call horror- more like crime drama. It is fun to watch the old ones just to see what really old movies were like. Some of them, such as ""Bloody Pit of Horror"", are the kind of cheesy B-movie/ soft porn productions that are so silly they're fun.
There's nothing really great here, but I'd say it's worth buying for the value and the fact that there are so many old, hard-to-find movies here.",1199404800,15,714,4.416666666666667
8060936,4,B0009HLCZQ,"NIGHT SCREAMS 50 MOVIE PACK is an excellent collection of mostly-forgotten fright and suspense films that's sure to please all vintage movie fans.

Some NIGHT SCREAMS trivia:

THE GHOST AND THE GUEST was written by funnyman Morey Amsterdam (of THE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW).
A SHOT IN THE DARK has been used as a movie title on eight separate occasions.
THE FACE AT THE WINDOW is the name of a dozen different movies.
THE TELL-TALE HEART is the repetition winner however, having been used as a title for 21 films! This 1960 version is not an adaptation of the Poe short story of the same name. The only connection to Poe might be the lead character, who just happens to be called Edgar.
MANFISH, on the other hand, was actually based on the writings of Edgar Allan Poe.
Ava Gardner appearing together with those goofy Bowery Boys? Yes, it's not only true, but the fellas were given top billing in GHOSTS ON THE LOOSE.

MILL CREEK value-priced collections offer generally good audio and video transfers of public domain material. If you think you'd enjoy these films, then their&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SUSPENSE-50-MOVIE-PACK/dp/B000A2X4PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SUSPENSE 50 MOVIE PACK</a>&nbsp;may also be of interest to you.
