Yes. Pablo Larrain's The Club is all of those things. And it certainly is not for everyone. But The Club also is one of the most accomplished satires about organized religion -- and organizations in general -- to come along in a long time.

None of this should come as a surprise to fans of Larrain, a Chilean filmmaker who has made his mark with a trilogy of deeply shocking horror-comedies about the legacy of the Pinochet regime. Larrain looks at how a totalitarian system so perverts an entire social system that every aspect of human life is polluted including language, culture and sexuality.

Set in a group home for disgraced priests on the Chilean coast, The Club forces viewers to confront the kind of vile acts committed by these clergymen, including helping the previous regime's torturers, not to mention child sexual abuse. These men ought to be locked away in prison, they are instead hidden by the church in a sort of demented bed & breakfast with a nun who acts as their cook, cleaner, friend and guard.

The story begins with a series of tranquil scenes: We watch as four middle-age housemates and a woman who seems to be their housekeeper go about their daily routine. One contemplates the sea, another takes the dog for a walk, while a third putters about in the living room. They eat together. They seem content.

For all we know, the housemates are all brothers, or four retired professors.

There's a bit of excitement when the woman enters the dog into a local race.

But we notice there's something off about the arrangement when the four men watch the race from a long distance. They seem afraid to join the crowd.

As we find out when a new resident joins the household, the men are not allowed to have any interactions with the locals. These men aren't retirees living out an ideal life on the coast, they are priests sent here to live in quiet shame.

The woman, a nun named Monica (Antonia Zegers), isn't their servant, but their jailer - and sometime friend.

We learn more about the house when a priest named Father Garcia (Marcelo Alonso) brings a new resident to the home. Mateo Ramrez (Alejandro Sieveking) is as gray, nondescript, and skittish as his new housemates. And he's hostile: He tries to explain that he doesn't belong with a group of perverts and criminals.

Just then, we hear a man outside call Mateo's name.

It seems at least one of the locals knows him from before - back when he had a parish of his own. A deranged destitute man-child named Sandokan (Roberto Faras), the local, describes with gruesome detail how Mateo molested him as a child.

That's when things start to get strange ... and very violent.

A form of cinematic shock treatment, The Club is the perfect follow-up to Larran's Pinochet Trilogy - Tony Manero, Post-Mortem, and No - that addressed more directly the political and social corruption that took hold of Chile during Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship.

Not since Luis Buuel has a filmmaker used comedy with such deadly intent.",1464393600,17,3032,4.737642585551331

7613958,5,B01AY1C2WI,"A fabulous film directed by Pablo Larrain, a genius director!  The characters were all so completely different from one another, and each actor
did a superior job of representing their character.  Gut-wrenching scenes and situations in the movie illustrated  ""the human condition""  suffered
by each person in the story.  If you like foreign films, this one is a winner.  I highly recommend it and I will watch for director Pablo Larrain's other films.",1486857600,2,451,5.109589041095891

7613960,4,B01AY1C2WI,"This is a film from Pablo Larrain who brought us Tony Manero and No, and is an excellent film maker. This is about a sort of retirement home for bad Priests on the coast of Chile. There four priests and one fallen nun get to live out their days away from where they can do harm to their erstwhile flocks. The crimes range from sexual abuse of children to child stealing from unmarried mothers. Then after a new incident a crisis counsellor turns up with Vatican credentials.

His job is to find out what has really taken place and see if these people are still worth the efforts of the Mother Church.

Now this is a cold film, it is also very bleak at times with many references to sexual abuses and so can be difficult in places. However, it is also powerful and does not set out to wholly condemn anyone. Everyone gets to have their say and all angles seem to be covered which makes the whole thing more real.

It is also a film that has a sense of doom and an urgency that makes you want to carry on watching it. I am a fan of Pablo Larrain and this film has only encouraged me in that endeavour  recommended.",1484697600,2,1112,4.206572769953052
7613961,5,B01AY1C2WI,"Pablo Larrain is to me one of the most exciting directors alive, and not since Tony Manero has he let so loose as he has with The Club. The depths of meaning to this rather simple tale were not apparent to me until after ""The Slaughter of The Innocents"" scene when I got emotionally involved and things began to click. At that point, the symbols and allegory, the many facets and faces of things truly came alive. Larrain's intellectual understanding of life is remarkable, but it is by virtue of his visceral one-two punch, that you are there, right there, in a non dual space of living comprehension. As soon as I felt that horror, that utter sadness (and brief anger towards the filmmaker for taking me there), at that moment I began to see, and feel, the complexities of this issue, pedophilia (and more) within the church, the church being as much cultural as institutional. Can the problem be traced back to the source? There are more questions than answers, but we are left with the present reality and have compassion and humor to soften the blow.",1484438400,2,1055,4.617021276595745
7613962,3,B01AY1C2WI,"A very, deeply, overwhelmingly dark comedy which teeters on the brink of horror.  I felt I was understanding everything quite well until near the end when it felt like there was a skip in the movie which left me wondering what the hell was going on.  And though I could feel the bleak satirical edge to the film, the music and the grayed lighting really seemed to suggest something morbid.  Again, appreciated but a bit of an overextension for me.",1484092800,2,447,4.5625
7613963,4,B01AY1C2WI,"Fascinating take on  the difficult subject of power. In many ways the film, while not overtly political,  is a metaphor for the problems faced by the post-dictatorial transitions to democracy in Latin America and other places.

7613967,4,B01AY1C2WI,"A very interesting movie that touches one of the most controversial issues of Chilean life nowadays, which is the demise of the public trust in Catholic church. However, the movie goes farther this current topic to deal with a group of ex-priests hiding from their own personal stories: pedophiles, con-men, insane people that in that house creates a paradoxically claustrophobic atmosphere. Located on a hill with a view to the Pacific Ocean, the house embodies the kind of moral condemnation that Chile as a country faces: the truth has been hidden from the public eye, it's been sent to a small house in a small town in the beach. Everybody knows what happened and what happens now in Chile, but the truth is sent away to deal with in ""a Chilean way"". The actors performances is outstanding, making Pablo Larran's work easier to do, since each of the ex-priests is a convincing character, all of them reluctant to accept their condition of social pariahs.",1481068800,2,958,4.847560975609756

7613970,5,B01AY1C2WI,"I cannot say I love it. I am chilean and saw it in spanish and my familiar accent made the movie even worse for me. My God. I don't believe there has ever been a  movie to expose so crudely and viciously the effect that sexual abuse has on children particularly that perpetrated by the ""loving"", saintly authority figure of the ""curitas"", as priests are affectionately called many times in Chile. To show the devastating effect this has had on a humble, poor little boy from Chillan who must have been  the most vulnerable of beings, and show the corruption and complete reversal of the pious innocent soul has no pardon in this world or the next. Director Larrain has shown in all its crudity and ugly words how the victims of this kind of abuse become. It is a rape of the soul. And nearly impossible to watch. Now I can never unsee it and my heart bleeds for or these children.  But if you are brave enough see the movie and understand the truly odious nature of the crime committed in the name of all that is holy.  Amazingly brave movie but you cannot watch it and remain unscarred. I gave it 5 stars only because of the artistry in the execution and acting. Brave work of art.",1476748800,9,1182,4.359090909090909

7613974,2,B01AY1C2WI,"It's rare that I seek out the Internet to post a negative review, but I will this time. I checked the published reviews and the film descriptions, but not one of them (not any that I read) conveyed the nature of the verbal content of this film. Perhaps it's more dramatic reading subtitles, but the stories of abuse are told in graphic, cringe-worthy detail. Okay, fine, I get the concept of shock value. Then they are retold. Then retold again, using the same graphic images and terms--it's really quite a bludgeoning effect. Which was probably the goal--however, it was just way too much for me: once, okay, got it; twice, okay, got it some more; but then three times, I'm tuning out. Then we get to one, two, three greyhounds cruelly treated. . . suffice it to say I had to stop watching the film at that point, as I didn't know what would follow, and I no longer cared. There is something to be said for stark, edgy, raw film, and then there's a whole lot more to be said about subtlety. The image of the yellow house is a brilliant symbol, but really that image alone, and of the town, and the men gathered somberly about dinner, said more about their state of existence and their crimes than all those graphic tales told over and over. One tale, fine, that has impact, spun slowly and masterfully. More than that, using the exact same words and images, well, I'd argue the impact is lessened or even lost. It was for me. Too bad, as I was really looking forward to this film.",1473638400,,1481,4.428571428571429
