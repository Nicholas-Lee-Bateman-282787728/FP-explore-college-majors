1896393,3,B00009XN4H,"The title ""Rock"" 'N Learn is a bit of a stretch even for little children.  I found the video fast-paced but not catchy.  They sing the alphabet evenly spaced, which is an odd variation from the ABC song.  The words for each letter are presented quickly and the corresponding images are fairly small.  It does, however, address ""funny letters"" such as ""a"" and ""q"" that look different in some fonts, and it quickly demonstrates how to write each letter.  I think it is a good choice for a child who knows the alphabet and is on the verge of reading and writing.",1071100800,2,559,4.4411764705882355

7994094,5,B00009XN4H,"After much consideration I chose this series over Leapfrog, My Baby Can Read & Hooked on Phonics. My toddler loves how this series uses both capital & lower case letters (some of the other series don't use both). It is straight forward & easy to understand.",1299369600,,257,4.608695652173913

Highly recommended.",1297900800,,134,5.090909090909091
7994096,3,B00009XN4H,"I bought this movie, along with the Shapes and Colors, for my son when he was 3.  At that time he was not interested in them at all.  He is now 4 and enjoys watching and singing along them.  The songs are catchy and animations are very brightly colored.  I probably would not purchase it again, but I do hope it will help him identify letters better.",1269216000,,350,4.17910447761194

My son is 4 years old and diagnosed with speech delay (which after these DVDs could now be argued against because regular developing chldren and even adult strangers can now easily understand him).  I bought the DVDs and received them around 3 weeks ago. He LOVES them.  He asks for them by name 'I want Alphabet Al, Mommy.' His other favorite is Letter Sounds (my personal favorite).  He has known his alphabets since 2 and able to count to 10 since 2.  He already counts up to (and recognizes) numbers up to 40 (since around 6 months ago).  However, with these DVDs he has learned the sounds that each letter makes, which he did not previously know or even understand the concept. Now when he hears a certain word, for instance yesterday he heard us say 'fun', he repeated it and said 'fff, fff...F'.  My husband had him sound out the word 'dog', and he got the 'd-o'...we are on our way! The biggest change with him is that he doesn't appear to be speech delayed anymore.  He is speaking in sentences up to 10 words.  He can spell 'CAT', and he spells and writes his name (very legibly). This happened within a week of starting to listen to thesee DVDs.  By the way, the 'Phonics' DVD is way too advance for him at this stage.  That said, with how much he's learning, he may be ready for the 'Phonics' video in 6 months or so.  By the way, I just ordered the Rock N Learn 'Getting ready for Kindergarten'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rock-N-Learn-Getting-Ready-for-Kindergarten/dp/B0009UKUIS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rock 'N Learn: Getting Ready for Kindergarten</a>, 'Alphabet Exercise'<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alphabet-Exercise-DVD/dp/B000E8LQWY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alphabet Exercise DVD</a>, and 'Nursery Rhymes'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rock-N-Learn-Nursery-Rhymes/dp/B0007GP7BY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rock 'N Learn: Nursery Rhymes</a>this morning.  I can't wait for them to get to him. (I'll write a review once we receive them and he's had a chance to view them) He is soooo excited by this series of DVDs.  We spend time watching the DVDs with him (fun for adults also - songs are catchy), but can leave him to watch these DVDs guilt free as well.  THE ROCK N LEARN SERIES ARE THE BEST EDUCATIONAL PRODUCT WE HAVE EVER BOUGHT FOR OUR SON & HE HAS SO MUCH FUN WITH THEM.  Buy this series for your family, friends, and your children's teachers.  I'll be buying a set for my son's pre-school and another for his kindergarten (he'll start kindergarten next September). If you visit the Rock N Learn website, you will get a breakdown of the age appropriateness of each DVD.  They have various DVDs from 2 - 10 years old. I can't say enough about these products except 'THANK YOU SO MUCH' to the makers of this product.",1229904000,10,3839,6.291984732824427
7994098,5,B00009XN4H,"You will not be dissappointed!  all the Rock and Learn DVD's are amazing!  I have them all and my 3 year old has learned so much.  I am thrilled with all of these videos, they are very colorful, fun, the quality is great.  I love it that they make it a point to teach both upper case and lower case letters, this is so important because when a toddler is starting to learn the alphabet, this could be confusing because some DVD's will only teach the alphabet in upper case, which makes it confusing once they are introduced to lower case.  These dvd's are worth every penny!",1181692800,11,574,4.327102803738318
