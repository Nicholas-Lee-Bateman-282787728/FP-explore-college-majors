7910858,5,B00000IMBE,"Finally, I found the Tai Fit video available. I had accidentally lost this during a move and am glad to have found Lawrence Whitaker's product again. I have two Tai Bo (Billy Blanks) DVDs collecting dust because it is not condusive to a home workout. He switches up movements to quick and with random scene changes, I found it frustrating enough to keep up. I was in the best shape of my life using Tai Fit. If you can knock out the half an hour workout at least 3 times a week, you will find your abs coming back to the surface, shoulders that don't tire under most sports activities, and a rising metabolism that will burn fat away faster than standard treadmill cardio. Dust off the VHS player and get ready for the original kickboxing workout!",1300233600,,747,4.45985401459854
7910859,5,B00000IMBE,I really didn't think it would be serious but this is a very good workout.  Don't think that other guy is the only Tai that will make you sweat.  This workout is not as jarring as Tai bo either.,1286668800,,194,3.948717948717949
7910860,5,B00000IMBE,"I LOVE this video! I bought it quite a while back, and have since bought several Tae-Bo DVDs, just to try them both. The Tae-Bo moves are too complicated for someone who doesn't dance or have a college major in movement - I found myself floundering wildly just attempting to figure it out. This video, Tae-Fit is do-able by the average ""two left feet"" person! I love the instruction, and now, I turn the volume all the way down and just cue my moves by watching - I don't even listen to the instruction or the video sound track anymore! I love doing this to my own music (heavy metal and hard rock), and I think it's a great video with a great instructor, who doesn't try to ""pep-talk"" you or do stupid things like pretend he can SEE you through the TV screen (like Billy from the Tae-Bo DVDs does). I really like this guy, he's much more ""real"" and very solid and reminds you to do things at appropiate times (like ""keep that stomach tight"" or ""get those elbows up""). I REALLY love the edited in time remaining notes, makes it bearable, just when you feel like giving up, it pops up ""10 minutes remaining"", and you get that relief of knowing you can make it the rest of the way! My advice, learn the moves, then turn the volume down and put on your own upbeat fast-paced music and just use the visual cues on the video! Now I just need the DVD version for at work.",1194393600,,1365,4.253846153846154
7910861,5,B00000IMBE,"Lawrence Whitaker is a very good instructor. I have had a hard time with Billy Blank's Tae Bo. I find his beginning program a bit too fast and complicated. I have almost tripped and pulled muscles with that program, and I thought that I was just incompetent, in matters of kickboxing.

A collection of DVD's called the 10 best fitness, put out by Brentwood Communications, had something called Tai Fit in it. I bought it on a whim. Most of the programs have serious problems, but tai fit and 'kick butt'' are its redeeming saviors!!

I thought that I would give it a try, and after Mr. Whitaker's instruction, Billy Blanks became a whole lot more clear.

... Just letting ''the world'' in on a secret, that should never have been one.",1125187200,2,734,4.545454545454546
7910862,5,B00000IMBE,"This is the first review I've ever written and after reading the other reviews I felt compelled to weigh in.

This is a no-nonsense back to the basics workout.  Unlike one of the other reviewers, I didn't find the background distracting.  Who cares what the background looks like when you're busy doing the workout.

I've been doing this workout for several weeks and every time I do it I feel energized and motivated.

Unlike other over-produced workout tapes, this has challenging combinations and moves that will keep you sweating.

I have the DVD version and have found that it's nice to be able to mix and match the seperate chapters.

The mat work section reminds me of old-school gym callenstenics with a twist.  It's almost like you're back on your highschool soccer team and you've got a coach that makes you WORK.

Seems like so many other videos spend too much time being cute or trendy that they miss the point.

The only complaint I have about this DVD is the super short cool down.  But that's easily remedied by continuing with your own cool down and stretches after the tape is over.

If you make it a goal to get through all the sections of this DVD without stopping, once you achieved that goal, you would be seriously fit.",1091232000,,1241,4.590909090909091
7910863,5,B00000IMBE,So far this is my favorite kickboxing workout.  The strength workout is good too.  And then you get a free CD of music to take the kickboxing on the road with you.  Great value.  Thanks Lawrence!!,1056499200,,196,4.361111111111111
