8750935,4,B0010YQTWI,Had I had this DVD when I started trading I would have avoided making some very amateur mistakes. This is a good DVD for traders who have atleast some knowledge of the markets. If you are looking for a DVD to go over the simple basics with you this is not your cup of tea. Finance terms are used and basic knowledge of the viewer is assumed.,1255219200,5,341,4.104477611940299
