5767789,1,B00D2L8PTW,"I too was duped by the five star reviews that I now know MUST be from people involved with the movie or were paid to leave a good review. I search for Amazon movies on my ps3 Amazon instant video app and can see the star ratings for the movies but not the actual reviews. After paying $4 to rent this piece of garbage movie, I'll definitely be checking the actual reviews on the website.

I watch ALOT of horror movies, and any horror movie buff knows there's alot of crap out there. Well this movie takes the cake. This movie is literally like watching a ghost hunting show on TV...commercials and all. Really guys? Fake commercials? Actually, if this was a real ghost hunting show on TV it would be cancelled because it's even worse than any of those I've seen.

Take it from a horror movie fan who actually really likes found footage movies...this movie is absolutely terrible. Do not waste your money. I am pissed that these other reviews led me to shell out money for this movie. I just wish there was a way to get my money back. I've paid for many rentals in my lifetime that I thought wasn't worth the money, but never have I felt cheated like this. Congratulations, fake reviewers, you did your job and got money out of another sucker.",1379203200,15,1243,4.4
5767790,1,B00D2L8PTW,The five 'five star' reviews has to be the cast / crew of this movie. Don't be fooled. This is a terrible waste of time and money. I'm surprised Amazon charges $3.99 for it - like it's a real film or something. I want my money back.,1379116800,6,232,3.9574468085106385
5767791,1,B00D2L8PTW,"The other reviews HAVE to be from cast/crew/producers of the movie trying to fool you because this is complete garbage.

This was a full price $3.99 movie so I thought it might be higher quality than the $1.99 found footage scum on here.  I was wrong.

Even at its short 70 minute run time it runs out of things to do and places to go, so we have like 10 totally pointless fake commercials interspersed throughout that don't add to the story or anything.

It's all old, ugly people who are terrible actors and deliver their lines wooden as hell.  There is a soundtrack running throughout that is too loud, distracting, and doesn't add any sense of dread at all.  Parts of it were full orchestra so the filmmakers probably stole it without permission to use in their movie without paying any licensing cost.

There is no attempt to scare at all until the last five minutes.  The rest of the movie is just people walking around wondering what some noise was that they heard or why a light flickered.  There is one attempt at CGI/SFX of some ghost girl falling down some stairs.  This gets repeated about ten times throughout the movie pretending as though something different is happening every time when its just the same footage.

At one point there is a five minute scene near the end where these two guys are figuring out how to open a door.  Nothing happens during this time scary or otherwise, just them trying to figure out how to open the door.

I can't stress enough though how there are no scares at all until the last minute or so.  There is not even an attempt at a cheap scare like a cat jumping out or something.  It's all just middle aged and old actors walking around confused and aiming their cameras at non descript walls.

The actors and the filmmakers need to give up their pathetic pipe dream of movie stardom and get real jobs.  They are likely living off government welfare of some sort too, so with that being said, YOUR MOVIE SUCKS AND STOP STEALING MY TAX DOLLARS!",1379116800,3,1988,4.477777777777778
5767792,5,B00D2L8PTW,"As the other reviewers have already mentioned, this is a good independent film that takes on the ""real-ghost hunter, live action feed"" theme.  I am a horror fan and I enjoy watching these these real-time, live action genre films because they place me in the first-person seat.  This film is different from others on the market because it integrates elements that one would see on cable/television such as intersecting commercial breaks (some are hilarious), documentaries, and overviews of how the filming is done. The only criticism I can give is the short ending, which I like to have seen drawn out a bit more.",1379030400,2,613,4.884615384615385
5767793,4,B00D2L8PTW,"The Feed is another low budget shaky camera found footage style movie in the vein of Grave Encounters.

The film itself is actually lampooning the Syfy tv show Ghosthunters, particularly the live halloween specials and actually does a good job of mimicking the show, right down to some funny fake tv commercial breaks.

The filming and acting are both pretty amateur, which works well for the style of the movie, I mean it is supposed to be a tv show and there is some interesting back story to the haunted movie theater in which the movie takes place.

The film does a good job of slowly building up the tension towards the end but here lies the problem, the effects. The budget was clearly so small that the effects completely take you out of the movie when they do rear their ugly head towards the end of the movie, I would've preferred no special effects used at all versus the cheap low budget effects used at the end of the movie.

Still for a low budget independent movie, it's really not that bad and there is an element of cleverness to the way the whole movie was done and set up, you can clearly tell the director did his homework.

So if you are a fan of Ghosthunters, or like this type of movie I can heartily recommend it, just be weary of the cheap effects.",1378944000,3,1272,4.372881355932203
5767794,5,B00D2L8PTW,"I picked this up at Fright Night Film Festival a couple of years ago and was pleased to meet some of the cast, producers, and director briefly. While some indie films suffer at the hands of a small budget, this one makes the most of whatever meager resources I'm guessing they had. It is EXCELLENT! As a horror writer and a horror film buff, I don't throw that word around often. I have high expectations. The cast works well together, the camera work adds to the tension and suspense and creates a claustrophobic atmosphere, and there are several genuinely scary moments. Though artistic, it doesn't take itself too seriously. It's a fun ride, which is what its intentions were. Highly recommended! I've watched it 7-8 times.",1373241600,4,726,4.76984126984127
5767795,5,B00D2L8PTW,"I was invited to the premiere because I am a local ghost hunter. I enjoyed watching this movie in the movie theatre that the film was set in. The movie plays very well as a ghost adventure gone wrong. It has a real sense of history and comes across as a very typical ghost hunt. The film builds a spooky ambiance and has a very interesting ending. Worth the watch! And you can even go to the Art Deco movie theatre this was filmed in. Check out the Campus Theatre in Lewisburg Pa after you watch the movie...it will make using the bathroom a little more interesting,.....you might want to skip the soda...lol",1373241600,4,608,4.389380530973451
5767796,5,B00D2L8PTW,"I attended the premier because my friend Jody had a role in this film, and it was love at first fright!
Anyone familiar with the popular ""Ghost Hunter"" television shows will appreciate this.  A crew of paranormal investigators and a psychic enter an old theater in search of spirits, and are fated to come away with more than they bargained for!  If they come away at all...
There are twists and surprises throughout, all culminating in a thrilling ending.

This is a wonderful film for a night at home, a Halloween party, or anytime when you want to creep yourself out.
Watch it with the lights out!",1373241600,2,600,4.588785046728972
5767797,5,B00D2L8PTW,"Saw this at the Horrorfind convention in 2011 and ended up dishing out the moolah for the DVD. Have watched it 3 times since and am itching to view it yet again.

This is a take on the ""Ghost Hunters"" reality TV show in which a crew of paranormal investigators set up in a haunted movie theater in a small PA town in an attempt to catch the supernatural on film. Sounds cliche? Maybe, but this film is brilliantly made-- the suspense builds up nicely, the dialogue is good, and the acting is spot on. And the cameo appearance by Lloyd Kauffman as a slimy attorney was a nice unexpected throw-in. This memorable film has lottsa ""jump scenes"" and everyone at Horrorfind who viewed this with me seemed to share my enthusiasm.",1353110400,4,722,4.46969696969697
5767798,1,B00D2L8PTW,"Terrible movie. Not really scary and boring except maybe for the last 5 minutes. Random story creates a sense of disconnect too.
 Watch Close Encounters instead. Similar theme but really scary and sensible story.",1393113600,4,212,5.235294117647059
5767799,1,B00D2L8PTW,"I couldn't even watch the whole movie after I saw all the lame/ super fake edits. Ridiculous, they could have at least made it semi realistic. Waste of my money.",1382486400,7,161,4.4
5767800,5,B00D2L8PTW,"It's not perfect, but considering it just cost a few thousand dollars to make, this is a very entertaining movie.  While it is a little predictable at times, it still had an overall creepy feel and a couple good scares.
Since I have Netflix, I hate to ""rent"" movies, but I felt this one was worth the rental.",1382400000,2,308,4.310344827586207
5767801,3,B00D2L8PTW,"If you enjoy found-footage scary movies this one is worth checking out. Storyline is similar to grave encounters which is one of my favorites. Some of the special effects were a bit cheezier then most underfunded found-footage films. Overall the story line is well done, the scares aren't that bad up until the last 5 minutes when its pretty intense, acting is good and the ending is well done. If you're looking for a somewhat creepy, with a couple good scares check this movie out!",1382400000,,483,4.694117647058824
5767802,4,B00D2L8PTW,Not too unlike another similar movie I had seen recently but still pretty creepy. I will watch it again though as you sometimes catch things you miss the first time.,1382227200,3,165,4.533333333333333
5767803,1,B00D2L8PTW,I actually bought this film at the mall. it sounded interesting and the 5 stars made me more interested. I love horror movies so i couldn't wait to get home and watch it. I watched a good portion of the movie and couldn't take it anymore. This movie sucked. It's a waste of money and a persons time to sit and watch it. I can't believe I wasted $10 on this crock of crap smh,1381104000,,374,4.0
5767804,1,B00D2L8PTW,"I really didn't like this one.
The mediocre story and effects, plot holes, bad acting... ugh.
I managed to finish it, but barely. This is what I'd define as a classic example of a ""C"" movie. Not even good enough to be a ""B"".
But...
The one single thing that I hated the most?
The commercials.
No, really. They put in fake commercials, as if you were watching it on TV.
I wish I was joking.
Nobody likes commercials, as it is. As bad as the acting was, it made them even more painful to watch.",1380672000,,492,4.135416666666667
5767805,5,B00D2L8PTW,"I was a big fan of Grave Encounters when I saw it awhile back; I kind of thought it took a wee bit too crazy of a direction, though, in the last quarter of the film.  I really enjoyed The Feed, and felt it was a little more consistent; I think they really pulled off the feel of this type of show, and the acting was spot on in portraying non-actors (whether deliberate or not, it really felt like I was watching a locally produced ghost hunting show, the way they were portrayed).  It is just one of those movies that I feel like they had a lot of fun making, and it made it more fun for me to watch.  My only criticism, and I do understand why, is the length of the film.  I rented it for one night, so didn't get a chance to check out any special features, so hopefully when I get it in the mail, there is maybe some more footage or something.",1380412800,2,846,3.9881656804733727
5767806,3,B00D2L8PTW,The movie was okay but it kept turning off on us and starting up during the movie.  It was very frustrating to be watching it and then it turn off and on.,1379635200,,154,3.8125
5767807,1,B00D2L8PTW,DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE FIVE STAR RATINGS FOR THIS MOVIE. THIS WASTE OF TIME HORROR MOVIE HAS GOT TO BE THE WORST I HAVE EVER SEEN.  TOTAL C-MOVIE ACTING. TOTAL C-MOVIE. NO ACTION-NO GORE-NO BLOOD-NO MONSTERS. I CANNOT BELIEVE AMAZON IS PUTTING CRAP LIKE THIS OUT TO RIP US OFF OF OUR MONEY. WHO EVER GAVE THIS FILM 5 STARS IS WORKING EITHER FOR AMAZON OR THE AUNT AND UNCLE WHO PAID VERY LITTLE TO HAVE THIS MOVIE PRODUCED. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN LISTED UNDER THE RIP-OFF GENRE.,1379289600,15,478,4.311111111111111
8588609,1,B00D2L8PTW,"Boring! If you'd like a tour of an old theatre, this is your movie. It almost got scary the last 5. Doesn't  compare to Grave Encounters, as someone else wrote.",1492041600,,160,4.333333333333333
8588610,5,B00D2L8PTW,"This movie actually accomplished what Grave Encounters did not. This is exactly (well close to it) what would happen if a live Ghost Hunters episode was actually dangerously haunted , and the crew were really in danger. Do I think this is as good as Grave encounters in some ways absolutely- but your talking a main stream high budget film vs. a low budget smaller production company. The story/plot is great they really do have a creep factor that similar films do not, the acting is fine (it seems they chose to go with a cast that could act verses one that looked good)- but bottom line the rhythm and vibe is totally realistic reality ghost show - it even has commercials- well worth the money and time.",1462838400,,707,4.53125

8588612,2,B00D2L8PTW,The only scary thing about this movie occurred in the last five minutes. The rest was putting me to sleep. The acting sucked.,1435449600,,125,4.478260869565218
8588613,3,B00D2L8PTW,"I found this ""found footage"" c-horror microbudget film to be an interesting and worthwhile rental. The acting was decent and the visuals equally satisfactory. Not many scares, unfortunately, but they did a good job of drawing you in to the experience and it wasn't - as so many films in this subgenre are today - overacted (like Daylight, a recent addition to Amazon Instant, and many, many others). Is it up there with the really good ones, like The Houses October Built or Mockingbird - ones that are definitely a cut above the rest - no, but it's definitely worth it if you have seen the majority of FF films and are looking for something that is worth the price of admission.",1418169600,2,679,4.573770491803279
8588614,1,B00D2L8PTW,"I like the ""found footage"" genre. Some are good, however some are also bad. All I can really say is that I was bored with this movie. This movie even had fake commercials in that, now what movie does that? I am just glad I rented it instead of being a bonehead and just straight buying it, like I do sometimes.",1416960000,,310,4.098360655737705
8588615,1,B00D2L8PTW,"I really wanted to like this film. It's a gutsy thing, trying to fake a national cable TV show on a shoestring budget. And I found all the actors really likable. But there was just too much time spent standing or sitting around in connective spaces, and the payoff scenes of the actual ghosts were so hokey...but the real problem was that it really sets you up for some big reveals. It's set in this theater where there's a long history of hauntings, missing people, mysterious fires, and the implication that the theater's founder was an evil pedophile of some sort. So we're eager to know the real story behind it all. Instead all we learn is that the theater is haunted by scary ghosts and that the TV team is getting in way over their headsboth of which were foregone conclusions. Skip this and instead watch Dark Feed, Reel Evil, The Addicted, Hidden, or Session 9, all of which are much better at creating big, labyrinthine haunted spaces.",1415318400,,945,4.597633136094674
8588616,4,B00D2L8PTW,"Maybe it's just me, but I found this movie very enjoyable. A ghost chasing team investigates a haunted movie theater and gets more than they bargained for.

8588617,2,B00D2L8PTW,"Feed arrived fine and on time. The movie itself was a big letdown, it was poorly made and not a bit scarey.",1397606400,2,107,3.909090909090909
8588618,1,B00D2L8PTW,"I usually read reviews and still choose to view the movies for myself, mostly because what some people might consider not a good movie turns out to be an ok movie for my personally. But this one, yea this one should not even be available to be purchased.  Anybody with some video editing software and a couple of cameras can make a movie now a days I guess.  Don't waste your money and time attempting to watch this movie.  Plenty of other good ""found-film""/""documentary"" style horror films on the market.",1393286400,4,505,4.588888888888889
