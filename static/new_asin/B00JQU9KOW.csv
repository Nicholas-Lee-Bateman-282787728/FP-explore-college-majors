6389121,5,B00JQU9KOW,"Tracey has a way of hitting those hard to reach areas in such a gentle, safe and effective way! Such great cardio intervals and DEEP toning. I didn't know I had muscles in my ""muffin top"" area until ""Absolution.""

6389122,5,B00JQU9KOW,"I'll start off by saying that I consider myself to be at an intermediate level, I only workout at home, and I own dozens of workout DVDs. I love Tracey Mallett as an instructor and own almost every workout she offers. I find her upbeat and encouraging, while still providing excellent form tips. This DVD is no exception. I will say that this DVD is intermediate to advanced and there's not always a modification given, so be prepared! I especially loved the 20 minute countdown clock to keep you going when you feel like giving up!
This DVD has a total run time of 40 minutes, but you can break it into two 20 minute workouts. Workout #1 is more cardio based, while workout #2 provides more ab-centered toning. I also felt a lot in my shoulders.

Workout #1 Breakdown (sorry I don't know the proper terms for these moves):
-Side lunge and balance with weights
-Cardio: Squatting windmill (this one hurts my neck a little)
-Standing leg side crunch with weights
-Cardio:Bunny jumps
-Lying on back and lowering legs to the side
-Cardio: Jumping diving plank
-Chopping wood with arabesque
-Cardio: Lateral jump into plank
-Plie twist with weights
-Cardio: Skier
Ends with a brief stretch for legs and obliques

Workout #2 Breakdown:
-Side crunch in plank
-Bunny jumps
-Plank arabesques
-Kick to side plank (I couldn't do this one, so I just held the side plank)
-Lean back with weights, 1st legs down, then legs up
-V crunches on mat with weights (I put the weights down at this point because I was feeling it in my neck)
-Alternating legs
-V crunch to pike
-Rolling like a ball up to standing position
-Plank oblique cruches
-Criss Cross Bike
Ends with brief stretch for abs",1401753600,28,1673,4.648648648648648
6389123,4,B00JQU9KOW,"Just got the ""Absolution"" two 20-minute segments from Tracey in the mail yesterday. I've worked out to Tracey DVDs since Booty Barre and grown to love her quirky pronunciations (""heexxhale"") and upbeat attitude throughout her workouts. This one doesn't disappoint. Besides being in the useful two-part format, I like that one is more cardio oriented, and one focuses more on isolating the abs more intensely.

She works the whole body, especially in the cardio circuit, but this is definitely an ab-facing workout. I work out 4-6 times a week with cardio and strength training but I am quite sore in my back and obliques right now. I blame the ""Chopping wood/arabesque"" move in workout 1. Insta-sore-so-good! Things get a little intricate and confusing at times -- see kick dip to side plank (with a raised leg, if you're up for it), but I like that, because challenging the body leads to change. Can't wait to do it again.",1400112000,16,923,4.841772151898734

8653391,4,B00JQU9KOW,"I would give it 3.5 but was not bad enough for 3 stars.
I liked first workout more. Second was unnecessarily difficult and I barely got any cardio feel out of it. Would keep it just for the first workout.",1525219200,,204,4.125
8653392,5,B00JQU9KOW,"This is an awesome video. It includes high intensity cardiovascular exercises, Pilates and toning to create a tighter waistline. I have shelved it temporarily as I noticed my cardiovascular endurance is seriously lacking. I have to pause it every few minutes to walk around and catch my breath. I think if a person truly committed themselves to this workout and did it every other day, within 4 weeks they would definitely notice a difference in their waistline. I love how there are 2-20 minute segments so you can do half now and half later. I could do the cardio portion in the morning, shower, go to work and come home and do the toning portion. I could also choose to do cardio today and toning tomorrow.",1501113600,,709,4.634920634920635
8653393,2,B00JQU9KOW,I had a hard time keeping up with the pace. I felt like I was all over the place and needed a break. I would say I am average for exercising. It was hard to watch her while trying to copy her moves without missing a step.,1440028800,4,221,3.723404255319149
8653394,5,B00JQU9KOW,"I work out often at an intense gym doing cardio, indoor rowing, and weight lifting. The first time I followed the video I was super sore the next day. It was great!",1427414400,2,164,4.15625
8653395,5,B00JQU9KOW,"This workout is all kinds of difficult and sweaty, but it gets the job done.  I've already noticed my waist shrinking, which is quite a shock considering that I've tried to whittle it down for the past 2 years!
If you're looking for an easy workout this is not for you, but if you're looking for an effective workout you should try this out.",1425081600,2,341,4.328125
8653396,5,B00JQU9KOW,"I found this workout quite challenging for the most part, I did the 40 minutes using 5's and 8's  dumbbell,  mostly 5's and I had to drop the weight a few times.  I am not sore at all but I Think is because I usually exercise for 1 hour and 30 minutes 6 times a week. I use workouts like Insanity, Jillian Michael, Tracey Anderson, P90x, Barre, Cathe, Jari Love, Kelly Coffey and some other  programs.  I really enjoyed this dvd and I felt like my abs were worked and my heart rate got up to 150 and stay over 135 for the most part witch is good calorie burning. I liked this dvd because it was fun and time flew by.",1424649600,,616,4.016393442622951
8653397,3,B00JQU9KOW,"Being 50 years old, I have been focusing more on Barre/Pilates focused workouts in the past few years due to diminished strength in my right arm and leg from previous injuries.  I have a few of Tracey's dvds and love them as they are fun and challenging; so I was excited about ordering this one, especially since it had 20 minute workouts.  This is an intermediate-advanced workout, which I do not have a problem with as I think alot of Tracey's dvds are in that range.  But, though I found the majority of the workout fun and challenging like her other dvds, there were a few positions that I found too strenuous for my right arm due to having to maintain my body weight for too long on it.  I also found some of the transitions a little choppy and awkward - they didn't flow smoothly into each other (i.e. lateral jump/hop to a plank).  I will probably give this dvd away as I do not think I will use it very often.",1424304000,6,918,4.283236994219653
