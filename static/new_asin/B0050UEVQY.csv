4518470,5,B0050UEVQY,I'm not one for toilet humor but I love Shin Chan. The episodes are just as good as when the series started. Japan has over 800 episodes and all we get are 3 seasons? NO FAIR! The Simpsons stopped being funny over 10 years ago but it's still going. Give us more Shin Chan!!!!!,1348963200,31,276,4.12962962962963
4518471,3,B0050UEVQY,"I hated this season when I first tried to watch it.  After giving it a second chance, I found that the second half of each disc was much better that the beginning.  They still dropped the best humor ideas from the first season, as there is very little Action Bastard. etc.  If you don't like the first episodes, skip ahead to the third episode on each disc.",1347753600,,357,4.298507462686567
4518472,5,B0050UEVQY,I love this series. Its potty humor with a 5 yr old. I wish Funimation would do the rest of it. If you have a sense of humor this is for you.,1334188800,,141,3.4375
4518473,5,B0050UEVQY,"But for how long? I love the team that did this dub but the ending seems to suggest this may be the last season if we don't buy enough DVDs! Overall highly enjoyable, my only complaint was that some episodes were in 4:3 aspect ratio, but not a big deal. If you've enjoyed the previous seasons you'll love this too.",1326844800,,314,4.25
4518474,5,B0050UEVQY,"If you're new to this show, it's kind of an animated ""What's Happening, Tiger Lilly?""  Some weirdos in Texas took an innocent children's show in Japan, redubbed it in English to make the episodes about lesbian donut bumping and abortion shame, and inserted a bunch of hilariously dated pop references that somehow make their subjects seemingly even less topical than they already were.

The humor is about as demented as it ever was, yet the show is still weirdly relatable.  The more my wife and I laugh at it with its foul characters and elementary school bathroom humor, the more we sadly realize we are becoming more and more like Mitzy and Hiro.  Maybe there are a lot of families with the same generic dysfunctions that we have, like a dirty old man grandpa, or a dynamic harpy wife/drinky husband combo.

Regardless, this is a great show and I can't recommend it enough.  In a just world, it would replace two or three Seth MacFarlane shows on Fox Sundays.  I know there's something like 20 years of Shin Chan cartoons from Japan to pull source material from, so hopefully the show lives on for a similarly ridiculous long time.

My one complaint with the DVDs would be the lack of extras.  I've seen YouTube videos of Laura Bailey doing interviews and panels at anime conventions, and she is cute and hilarious.  It would've been nice to see some BTS stuff with her and the other voice actors and writers, because the twisted minds that come up with this stuff must be at least as entertaining as the actual show.  Hopefully, that sort of thing will be included in a future set, or for free on the Funimation website.",1319932800,,1625,4.607638888888889
4518475,5,B0050UEVQY,"I've been a fan of the series since it was first on Comedy Central (never could get into the actual Japanese version, the voices of the characters seemed off to me). I was sad to see it taken off Adult Swim on Comedy Central, but man was I excited to see it coming back on DVD. The season three part two is a must have for any comedy fan, the jokes are offensive but always in the best of ways, and the plots make it all the more hysterical. I was a bit disapointed by the lack of bloopers, in Season 2 they included some extra bloopers and I have to say that I've never laughed so hard.z",1319414400,,588,3.9915254237288136
4518476,5,B0050UEVQY,"After about the third season being released I immediately purchased Part 1 and 2 for Season 3. After watching both of them I can honestly say that it didn't disappoint me. I really enjoyed the first season of this show, and then when watching the season it seemed like it started off really well and just started to drag out toward the end of part 2 season 2. This season has taken it and pushed it back up to where it was at the beginning of the second season for me. If I had to rank this in comparison to Part 1 of this season, I'd say that Part 2 comes out on top. There is plenty to laugh at as usual so go try it and enjoy your copy today.",1317600000,3,645,3.931297709923664
4518477,5,B0050UEVQY,I got the items and the are great :),1450483200,,36,3.111111111111111
4518478,5,B0050UEVQY,Loved this purchase! Shin Chan is the s***! Purchase came in quicker than expected too.,1447804800,,87,4.866666666666666
4518479,1,B0050UEVQY,why there isn't a English caption !!!,1445040000,,37,4.428571428571429
4518480,5,B0050UEVQY,Best show ever!,1436918400,,15,4.333333333333333
4518481,5,B0050UEVQY,Best show ever!!! I love shin-chan!,1434672000,,35,5.0
4518482,5,B0050UEVQY,"Fast delivery, good price.",1433808000,,26,5.75
4518483,5,B0050UEVQY,"Love this Show!!! unfortunately, Adult Swim decided not to renew it for a fourth season. The English version is much funnier than the Japanese because the jokes refer to the American pop-culture. I am satisfied with my purchase.",1430870400,,228,5.026315789473684
4518484,5,B0050UEVQY,"OMG I love Shin Chan! The things that come out of this 5 year-old's mouth! This is definitely an animation for adults, not means for kids. The kids in this show are cute only by drawings. You will laugh your butt off!",1425168000,,217,4.190476190476191
4518485,4,B0050UEVQY,"Another good season of Shin Chan, though, I can't say it's better than season 1.  There are far more plays on words, darker episode themes, darker humor, and a look into Shin's early childhood.  The only reason that I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the fact that this is the final season and the only ""extras"" included on the DVDs are trailers for the show.  You would think that the least Funimation could have done is include a goodbye message from the cast, a behind the scenes look at an after party... SOMETHING!",1423612800,2,527,4.357142857142857
4518486,5,B0050UEVQY,Love this came on time and nothing wrong,1423612800,,40,4.125
4518487,5,B0050UEVQY,"So funny.  As a general warning this show isn't kid appropriate, but we knew that already.  Very entertaining.",1422057600,,110,5.055555555555555
4518488,5,B0050UEVQY,"Funny and hilarious, I'll say its only for people with a different sense of humor",1414108800,,81,4.466666666666667
4518489,5,B0050UEVQY,I love Shin Chan and Amazon was the only place that had the latest season. Funny as ever!,1409270400,,89,4.0
4518490,5,B0050UEVQY,"Season three was just as good as the first two.  My husband and I love this show and really wish there would be more seasons.  If you like obscure humor this is a good bet. If you're a Shin fan, it's a great bet!",1400544000,,212,3.7954545454545454
4518491,4,B0050UEVQY,I really have enjoyed watching the entire season. Shin is funny as hell an the family is off the chang,1398038400,,102,4.15
4518492,5,B0050UEVQY,....I would finish that line but you'll have to check out season 1 for the conclusion....and I don't want to get in trouble for the language.  That's just one of the many reasons this show should have ore than 3 seasons.  The last episode is hysterical and just makes you want more!!!,1393372800,4,284,4.4423076923076925
4518493,5,B0050UEVQY,we finally get the seasons that cartoon network feared to air. this show is not for kids even though it is about them and that's one of the reasons it is hilarious,1392854400,,163,4.125
4518494,5,B0050UEVQY,it came on time with the other two I ordered. All the disks for all three seasons worked perfectly and were all in plastic as new.,1389312000,,130,4.038461538461538
4518495,5,B0050UEVQY,"If you actually have a sense of humor that includes, but is not limited to, dirty humor, I suggest you watch all 3 seasons. He's just a naughty little boy who will probably grow up to be some sort of deviant/felon. And that's okay with me.",1385424000,,239,4.217391304347826
4518496,4,B0050UEVQY,I love Shin Chan! I wish they would come out with a complete English version season every year! I've bought every season and plan to buy future ones!,1379548800,,149,4.357142857142857
4518497,5,B0050UEVQY,"I recently got into the show over the summer and I loved the first two seasons immensely. However, it was a hassle trying to find the episodes to watch, whether it was online or trying to find a friend who may own the previous disks. When I was approaching the end of season 2, I thought it best to order the third season on DVD so I wouldn't have to deal with the trouble of finding the episodes, and let me tell you, I don't regret ordering the disk set. There are many classic episodes on this set and even though a lot of the jokes derive from references to older episodes, it's still enjoyable for anyone to sit down and watch it. If you enjoy the type of humor found on the Simpsons or South Park, Shin Chan is a good choice for you.",1377907200,,739,4.103448275862069
4518498,5,B0050UEVQY,"I love the show since was show in cartoon network. The best dub in any anime series and casting, all the voices fit the character perfectly the only sad part is that this is may be the last season and in japan is like the simpsons with more than 10 and a lots of movies.",1377216000,,270,3.9272727272727272
4518499,5,B0050UEVQY,"I've loved Shin Chan since I first saw it & have been waiting to buy the third season for some time. Shin, of course, is up to his same nonsense. The off color humor is so enjoyable &, after a long day at work, a good laugh is just what I need. Can't wait for season 4!",1376611200,,269,3.736842105263158
4518500,5,B0050UEVQY,"Note: I said WITH a kid, not FOR kids. Do not show this to your child unless you have lots of money for therapy bills. You, however, will love it.

Addicted to Shin-Chan for years; a refreshing break from all the ""Yuki/Shinji-is-just-an-ordinary-high-school-student-and-then suddenly-this magical-fairy/demon/ET/robot-appears-and..."" genres.

Usually I don't do dubs, but this isn't an ordinary dubbed anime. What we hear is voiceovers by the American Funimation team (including the amazingly talented Laura Bailey as Shin), who have outstandingly, wonderfully written their own original scripts for the show, just based on the action. It gets deeply weird, but in a good way like you want.

Crude and perverted and lustful and awesome. Go get you some of the demon five-year-old Shin right now. But do keep it away from the younglings.",1368144000,,836,5.415384615384616
4518501,1,B0050UEVQY,"Let me think, pay a low monthly fee to watch all shin chans and other great series, or pay 1.99 for a single episode...  Lol this is the worse deal i've ever seen.  You guys need to drop the price or make it so if your a prime, you get to watch these episodes for free.  Since you can already do this legitly anywhere on the internet, you'd be a fool to pay for this.",1362182400,,367,3.8666666666666667
4518502,4,B0050UEVQY,At first I had no idea what to expect from the show. On a whim I decided to give it a chance. I was very pleasantly surprised At the clever humor. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a good laugh and is interested in discovering something different.,1360281600,,256,4.244897959183674
4518503,5,B0050UEVQY,I love this show it has a wicked sense of humor! I would recommend to anyone looking to laugh and for a show that is not mainstream!,1360022400,3,132,3.925925925925926
4518504,5,B0050UEVQY,"Really enjoy the series -wish there were more available. This DVD set is what you expect - mostly just the show, not much in the way of extras. If you like the earlier seasons, this is more of the same. But with some better short bits between the episodes.",1360022400,2,256,4.244897959183674
4518505,5,B0050UEVQY,love it hilarious was so happy to complete my collection of the shin chan series best anime in my opinion,1358985600,,105,4.3
4518506,5,B0050UEVQY,"I could not find this anywhere and I cannot tell you how much I have enjoyed this show! Very childish ( but still not for kids) humor, but it makes me laugh!",1358899200,,157,3.9375
8451937,3,B0050UEVQY,Thought it would have Japanese with English subtitles. Overall its still good but I like reading subtitle while listening to Japanese.,1507766400,,134,5.428571428571429
8451938,5,B0050UEVQY,"I love this show, unfortunately my dog ate through most of my seasons, so I will be buying again.",1501977600,,97,4.157894736842105
8451939,5,B0050UEVQY,"the dvd set came in good condition with my collection
thank you",1483833600,,63,4.333333333333333
8451940,5,B0050UEVQY,I have loved this series since episode one and this season is just as silly and gross as the previous seasons.  The only problem I had with it was the voices of some of the actors don't sound the same as they did in seasons one and two.  I really hope they end up making more english dubbed episodes.,1476144000,,300,4.067796610169491
