8393294,1,B003AYEYVO,"As a collector of artistic video material I'm disappointed with this product, for both its technical and artistic level.
Only the center of the image is used so there's an external black frame; it's a ""half-resolution"" signal that I never witnessed in this kind of products, too bad.
It's also lacking on the creativity side, with a repetition of the same video samples (took also from other sources like the movie Naqoyqatsi) brought together without sense, mixed with panning still images from the software Electric Sheep.
For me it doesn't worth the price.",1298246400,2,559,5.021505376344086
