All the characters have odd habits, quirks, and phobias that make them funny and interesting. I gave it 3 stars because the show is quite funny and cute, but it's not a very exciting or fast-paced show and there are some dull moments.",1384646400,,414,4.447368421052632
8439653,4,B004SCB10O,"A funny, little sitcom shot in the middle of a family diner. What Working!! lacks in a cohesive narrative, it makes up for in over-the-top comedy, easily relatable characters, and just a dash of heart. While the abrupt end will leave you with a bad after-taste, as a whole, it was entirely satisfying.",1341014400,,301,4.69811320754717
8439654,5,B004SCB10O,"Wagnaria!! (or Working!! as it's called in Japan) is a lighthearted romp of an anime for teenagers and college kids. The setting is a Denny's-ish restaurant called Wagnaria, in which guests are served delicious meals by a bunch of goofballs.
The goofballs in question to name a few, include Popura Taneshima, a short, peppy girl who wishes she was taller, Takanashi Souta, a newly-hired boy who has an affinity for all things small and cute (e.g. puppies), and Mahiru Inami (my personal favorite), a girl who is deathly afraid of boys.
Basically, the show puts these characters in a lot of silly sitcomlike shenanigans, only they're actually funny. From the manager, who refuses to work, to the waitress who is never without her sword, to the unlikely relationship between Souta and Mahiru, Wagnaria!! is bound to deight it's otaku audience.
The DVD only has Japanese audio, but there are English subtitles. Unfortunately, they're a little fast for people who have difficulty reading fast. Contentwise, as I've suggested, this show is for teens and up for slapstick comedy, profanity, and occasional innuendo. One of the characters is also a lesbian. If this sounds good to you, give it a try. It's a pretty good show.",1328400000,8,1218,4.9754901960784315
8439655,5,B004SCB10O,"This show is very lighthearted and humorous. This is mostly a slice of life genre mixed with comedy.
I bought the premium edition since I learned that the extra goodies you get with premium editions are just fun to keep around.
This is the first season and if the second season comes out on dvd or blu-ray I will definitely purchase it.",1328400000,,336,4.435483870967742

8439657,4,B004SCB10O,"This is a comedy about a young girl, who has to put up with three abusive older brothers, who let her do all the housework and sometimes beat her. At her part-time job at the family restaurant Wagnaria she has to put up with a co-worker who punches her in the face several times every day because he is uncomfortable around women. Sounds like a lot of fun, right? I mean, it is just slapstick. It is OK when it is a cartoon and not in real life.

No, obviously not. If the show was like what I had just described it would be outright offensive, slapstick or not. However, the unfortunate teenager isn't a girl but a 16-year-old boy. His older siblings are women and it is an androphobic girl who beats him up at work. And for some reason this really does make the show acceptable. I am aware that there is a double standard at work here, but in the context of anime comedies women assaulting men isn't nearly as offensive as men abusing females. And I really mean it; I like this show.

Wagnaria!! is a show in the slice-of-life genre. The concept at first seems fairly predictable and formulaic. There is a teenage boy with glasses, Sota, and a cast made up mainly of more or less attractive females. However Wagnaria!! manages to stay clear of many of the ordinary clichs. To begin with, the girls, with one exception, are not crushing on Sota, and he does have enough personality to be more than just a stand-in for the male viewer. Thankfully there is not very much in terms of fan service, at least not blatant enough for me to notice.

The comedy of Wagnaria!! is character-driven and to large extent based on the fact that the staff of the family restaurant, as well as some of their family members, are wackos. To be more precise, they are people who appear to be fairly normal until you notice their quirks. And the quirks aren't lovable. Sota may be a level-headed and intelligent young man, but his love of things small and cute (which according to him include water fleas) borders on the creepy. His co-worker Inami would be a sweet and fairly ordinary girl, if she could control her compulsion to punch every man that she sees. Yachiyo, the head waitress, at first appears to be a responsible big sister type--but what's the deal with the sword she is always carrying around? And isn't it a bit sad that she has devoted her entire life to feeding Kyoko, the manager? My first impression was that they were more or less one-joke characters, but that is true only in some cases. It is true about Kyoko. She eats all the time, and that's about it. Her slim figure must be due entirely to the different laws of biology in the anime universe. Many of the characters, however, are sufficiently fleshed-out for me to find them likable and worthy of some sympathy. Obviously, we are not talking about psychological realism in any three-dimensional sense.

To some extent the comedy of Wagnaria!! is based on stuff that would be tragic in another context. Sota's three elder sisters, for example, are a bitter divorcee, a shut-in and a drunk. His younger sister Nazuna is caring and responsible, but she has also learned to be manipulative--and to take pleasure in it. Inami's androphobia is due to the fact that her father has systematically manipulated her into fearing men. Yachiyo's obsession with Kyoko has severely limited her options in life. However, this is not real life, it is a mildly surreal anime that resembles real life. For one thing, many of these characters would be unemployable in the service sector. Not to mention the fact that Sota would be hospitalized from the repeated beatings.

In my case, what makes this show worth watching is that it has some heart in it. The staff of Wagnaria are a group of slightly difficult people who have learned to get along with and even care for one another. Like many people in real life, they have an adequate perception of what others are like while lacking some self-awareness. Sota, partly out of self-preservation, takes it upon himself to help Inami deal with her problem, and as a result she develops a crush on him in spite of being well aware of his flaws. Their co-workers try to nudge the budding romance in the right direction. It actually is kind of heart-warming.  Also, the animation is good.",1314748800,9,4270,4.597112860892389
8439658,5,B004SCB10O,"I bought this DVD set with absolutely no idea what to expect, which is always a risk. However, I was very pleasantly surprised; this is a very offbeat comedy with a heart. The characters, as expected, are very eccentric, but the female lead is surprisingly sympathetic, making the transition from comedy to romance in the latter half of the series not in the least bit frustrating.

Subtitles are similar to Toradora, where they're more attempting to match actual meaning than strict transliteration, I would think. This is always kind of strange and amusing, but I don't have any objection.

Funny, strange, and a very addictive opening song. Looking forward to the next season of this later this year.",1312675200,,703,4.9491525423728815
8439659,5,B004SCB10O,"There are animes which are the mainstreamers. Everyone loves them and they sell like crazy. They have good stories and bad stories from time to time. But then there are the hidden gems. Those which get a limited run and not everyone hears about. Their stories tend to be some of the best and most memorable. The characters themselves are also used as the blueprints for countless shows after them. Wagnaria (Working!!), is one of these shows. Its short, yes, but with some of the most memorable and enjoyable characters I've ever seen in an anime. If you are an anime fan, you know all the character types. Wagnaria certainly borrows some ideas, but it also breaks outside the mold on others. Perhaps it is due to the setting of the story, but then again, there have been other restaurant shows which have had carbon copy characters.

From episode one till the final scene ends, Wagnaria keeps you watching and wanting more. I remember watching it as it aired in Japan and couldn't wait for the next week to come for a new episode. If you've seen any new anime since this show aired in Japan, you'll notice the common thread of an androphobic character more prominent. As I've been watching over the years, I've seen that character become grossly overused ever since this show aired. Obvious a lot took notice of Wagnaria. But not to spoil it too much, yes there is one in Wagnaria, but her character is a lot more likeable and entertaining than any other i've seen. The rest of the cast is just as strong. In fact, Poplar reminds me so much of a girl I worked with years ago, that I cannot watch this show without thinking of her and laughing.

Art is well done but not Clannad level. However, you can tell from episode to episode that the creators really put their all into this show. It was wonderful to see this brought to the states. Personally while I'd like an English dub to be able to share with others who can't read subs, I am glad they didn't. I could never imagine Poplar or any other character in English.

Great show. Yeah the price is a bit for it, but its very worth it. The ending is semi left open but it doesn't completely piss you off like other shows. Plus, there is a season 2 in the works. Enjoy, its a fantastic little gem in the anime world!",1308614400,19,2267,4.431654676258993
