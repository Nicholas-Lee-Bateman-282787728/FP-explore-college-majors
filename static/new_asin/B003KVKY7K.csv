8398955,3,B003KVKY7K,"This is a disappointing little collection of Claude Rains films I am sorry to say. The cover implies it is part of the high quality WB box set series which it isn't at all. I figured it might be and hoped for quality transfers of Angel on My Shoulder, They Made Me a Criminal etc but instead the transfers were strictly public domain quality. There's no attempt to polish the sound and vision of any of the films offered in this set.

The movies themselves are excellent. The Evil Mind is a surprisingly excellent little film from the 30's. The Pied Piper of Hamelin, Angel on My Shoulder and especially They Made Me a Criminal feature Rains much more in a supporting role and again, you'd think with the title and presentation, you'd see Rains starring in more of the films offered than just ""The Evil Mind""

The price fits the quailty of the set even though you are doomed to received DVDRs (as advertised)",1360972800,11,908,4.496969696969697
