8521694,3,B007SZCQ3E,Could have been a really great show if they hadn't tried to make it reality show style. The narrator is annoying and they get off the subject a lot (talking about modern tanks that have nothing to do with the episode). Good overall but could have been much better.,1516838400,,264,4.408163265306122
8521695,5,B007SZCQ3E,"It was overall a good show, I wish it had ""made it"" and become a regular series. Much more informative than what passes for ""reality"" TV these days.",1515628800,,148,4.321428571428571
