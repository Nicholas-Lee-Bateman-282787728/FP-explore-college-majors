3960562,5,B002NXSRWK,"This is what the live action movie should have been like. sadly I was somewhat disapointed by the live action G.I.Joe movie.

in the live action movie the Joe team was well represented, but Cobra was not, plus they made the Baroness a goodie two shoes, and don't get me started on the Snake Eyes orgin where he and storm are kids in a truly stupid and laughable fight scean.

but enough about that.

G.I. Joe Resolute started off as a webcartoon. Im VERY glad that it will be on DVD. its a Very good movie. a true G.I. Joe classic.

a word of warning, espeisly to parents, this movie is very adult. there are some brutal fight sceans in this movie, some blood, and a few people die.

Resolute begins with Cobra returning after a long period of rest. they kick off by killing off captain Blood and leaving him out in plain veiw. the Joe team have littel time to figure out Cobra's plan, but they must work fast, or the world is doomed.

we see many favorites in this movie, Duke, Snake Eyes, Tunnel Rat, Destro (in a mask as he should be unlike mr. Eccelston), the Baroness (in proper evil mood), Zartan pops up to, as do many other Cobra opretives and Joes.

again there are many deaths, such as capt. Blood. Bazooka is the first of the Joe team to die, just to show how serious this situation is.

Cobra is now out to use their new weaponry to dominat the world. Destro and the Baroness are holding some scientiest prisoner, and Storm Shadow is hunting Snake Eyes.

the movie does a good job of retelling the orgin of Snake Eyes (better then the live action movie did).

i like this version of Cobra Comander. there is even a slight acknolagement of the old Sunbow series. the Resolute Commander states that he once pretended to play the fool to trick his enemies. now he is in rare form. the commander is at his most evil, in this movie. utterly insane and defitly a leader not to challenged or questioned. i very much enjoyed this version of him. (again much better then the live action movie).

now as most Joe fans know in the comics Snake Eyes and Scarlett were an item.
but in the Sunbow cartoon Duke and Scarlett flirted off and on.

this movie ties these two continutys.
so it seems like all this time there has been a sort of love triangl going on.

scarlett must chose between Duke and Snake Eyes
and she does indeed decid on the one she cares for the most.

the other chartures are good.
Destro sounds a bit TO much like Sean Connery though. but its good to see him in proper from. to bad he dosent get more screan time, but i was glad to see him play out his role in this movie rather well.

the movie starts off with it seemeing that Cobra will be victorious, so the Joes are hard pressed to attain victory. which is good.

all around this is a good movie, with great battles, chartures, and story.

its a very good G.I.Joe movie that any fan of the francise will enjoy.

and i just cant say it enough but Resloute is everything the live action movie should have been but wasnt.",1256688000,7,2992,4.303030303030303
3960563,5,B002NXSRWK,"as a long time fan of both anime and manga and also growing up watching GI JOE in the 1980s this was the answer me and my fiancee wanted a more mature story!

3960564,5,B002NXSRWK,"G.I. Joe: Resolute first aired in 7-minute installments on Cartoon Network's [adult swim] in the summer of 2009. For adult fans of the 1980s cartoon series this is as close to perfection as an animated Joe feature can get. The animation style has a much more sleek and anime feel to it, but these are still the same characters and it's set in the same ""universe"" as the 1980s cartoon. ""Resolute"" has all the classic characters (Baroness, Destro, Cobra Commander, Duke, Snake Eyes, Stormshadow, Scarlett, etc.) from the '80s cartoon, but it treats them with a PG-13 rather than a ""Saturday Morning"" sensibility. There are bullets and blood and death.

The plot centers on another attempt by Cobra Commander to overtake the world and the Joes rallying to stop him. The highpoint of the film for me included the ultimate battle between Snake Eyes and Stormshadow I always dreamed of as a kid. If the 2009 feature film had half of the energy and emotion as this one fight alone it would've been an infintely more enjoyable film. Bottomline is if you were a 1980s Joe fan and found the live-action film lacking then you will be pleasantly shocked and awed by this outstanding animated feature.",1255392000,64,1188,4.766990291262136

However, this take on joe needed more time to develop, as a run time of 58 minutes seems way too short for such a promising take on joe.

This movie is approximately one hour, but it covers a lot of ground and worth your five dollars if you get a chance to grab this edition.

Let me describe it in short:
Action, cool, amazing, fan favorite, ninjas, cool characters. If you love GI Joe, then you will love this.

This was way better than the earlier 80's animations, because for me it was the way it should have been all along.
If a plane gets blown up, there is no parachute and bad guys escape, instead they show them being destroyed.

Not really a great kids one, but not crazy violence.

3960599,5,B002NXSRWK,"Just wow.
It's great to see a G.I. Joe that is adult material.
The fact is G.I. Joe is used regularly as a child's show.
It's however wonderful to see something from a childhood to be portrayed for myself as a grown-up.

Despite being a collective of a mini-series into a film, it would be fantastic to see this as a full feature series. G.I. Joe fans will get a kick out of this seeing how far the show has gone to see it brought up to your age level.",1359849600,2,452,4.022222222222222
3960600,3,B002NXSRWK,"Overall, Resolute is essentially a triple-length G.I. Joe episode with death and blood.  It was interesting but not as engaging as it should have been.  I didn't feel as much as I should have toward either the heroes or the villains.  The likely culprit is the dialogue; it wasn't horrible, but generally wasn't great.  A couple of distractions came from unrealistic battle sequences involving people standing directly in the middle of heavy gunfire without being hit.  Given the scale of the threat presented at the beginning of the film, I would have liked to have had some reference to other major characters that were not shown.

The high point of this film is the animation, and the general visual style; it's all very smooth.

Overall, I enjoyed it, but it lacked a greatness that I hoped for.",1345248000,,799,4.788321167883212
3960601,5,B002NXSRWK,"This is definietly not the cartoon I grew up with. It's definitely made for a more adult genre. You have what we've always waited to see.....Snake Eyes using his Sword to take out Cobra bad guys, the final fight of all fights between Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes and sadly, the death of good ole Bazooka. Picked up this movie on a whim and it's now one of my favorites. Wish this came out when I was younger cause this is what I always wanted to see.....shots being fired and actually hitting someone, not running for cover from explosions and a all out fight to the finish!",1333324800,,573,4.364485981308412
3960602,5,B002NXSRWK,"A different twist to the Gi Joe cartoons as a kid!  This Gi Joe cartoon movie was more geared towards the older genre; but tied in what you loved from the 80's cartoon!

3960603,3,B002NXSRWK,"A great version of GI JOE, more hardcore and adult. Warren Ellis wrote the basic script and it shows! It is a great animation, a bit short (as it was first released as websodes) but highly entertaining. The animation is great, like a good anime and the plot is simple but effective. If you always wished to see GI JOE in a more adult and hardcore way, this is it! Bullets hurt, people get killed and all! :)",1319932800,,407,4.230769230769231
3960604,5,B002NXSRWK,This is one of the few instances where an 80's cartoon is rebooted right! The reboot in question is done while keeping the backbone of the original franchise in tact. Resolute was initially broken up into a few webisodes then later aired on Adult Swim. Seeing all these character in a more mature setting was very exciting.  And I only wish that they (Hasbro) would do more in this untapped area (especially with the original Transformers).  It's only 58 minutes long but still does a decent job and manages to create a relevant story. It's just to bad that Resolute was so short lived.,1318723200,,586,4.625
3960605,4,B002NXSRWK,"This is a great animated version of GI Joe, especially considering that it was presented as 5 minute ""webisodes"", which of course will make limits to how the story will be able to be told.

This show is presented as an adult upgrade from the old TV cartoon, rather than being based on the Marvel comic of the same time. (Mostly seen in the relationship between Duke and Scarlett, rather than Snake-Eyes and Scarlett).
The violence level, however, is more on par with the comic, which was not afraid to have the Joes kill their enemies, instead of shooting the guns out of their hands.

The only problem I had with this version is with Duke and Scarlett. It was not that they were together instead of Snake-Eyes and Scarlett (by far the better pair), but because Duke was not very likable in this series (especially when he makes Scarlett choose between him and Snake-Eyes, and Snake-Eyes is standing right there). Scarlett does not come up much better in that regard. If you want them to be an item, just have them an item. Why act like jerks to Snake-Eyes?

3960608,1,B002NXSRWK,"This is my first ever review in all the years I've used Amazon as a resource, but I felt compelled to say something.  Sadly this seemed like an effort to keep up with all the anime fans and x-box fps gamers.  I felt nothing for any of the characters (where was Avalanche? He'd mourn Bazooka's death like no one else), and it was only remotely interesting to see the Snake Eyes flashback simply because he and Stormshadow were characters that everyone wanted to know more about back in the day (like Boba Fett).  There's a lot of plot holes, characters make appearances simply to say their line and then die or just to be way over the top - like the Baroness (horrible accent btw) and Destro.  Sigh.  G.I. Joe blowing up a fake Wal-Mart was kinda tongue-in-cheek, but the only thing close to the Joes I used to know was when Gung-Ho and Roadblock were chatting it up (though moments before Roadblock was nothing more than a ammo-wasting pyschopath).
Maybe I'm just getting old at 33 *weeze*, maybe my childhood days are gone (I remember when the original He-Man used to be ""extreme"" violence), but I just felt like I was watching G.I. Joe caving in and loosing their standards just so they can try to keep up with movie, video game, and tv trends.  There's a lot more that can be said (like soooo much shaky-cam), but I think I've said enough.  Yo Joe?",1286755200,4,1351,4.467479674796748

3960610,5,B002NXSRWK,"I've harbored a love affair for the cartoon since it first burst onto TV screens across the good ole US of A so many years ago and was nothing short of supremely impressed by this DVD.

If you're a comic fan, you're familiar with the name Warren Ellis.  He is a British comic writer who is best known for his books PLANETARY, THE AUTHORITY and TRANSMETROPOLITAN.  He's currently writing ASTONISHING X-MEN for Marvel Comics.  He also has a mini-series called RED that has been adapted for the big screen & will be coming out later this year with Bruce Willis leading an all star cast.  For the most part, the man can write (although sometimes I question his sanity ala DOKTOR SLEEPLESS & his first novel CROOKED LITTLE VEIN) and boy does he deliver in this adult take on America's Elite Fighting Force.

Originally released via HASBRO's website and, later on, Cartoon Network, the series begins with two surprising deaths which alerts viewers to the fact that this isn't your 80s GI JOE.  The characterizations are right on the money.  The plot is old school joe but that story is elevated by the subplot involving Storm Shadow & Snake Eyes.  The action is intense and story ends as great as it starts.  The writing, coupled with the beautifully fluid japanese animation, makes this a must have for any GI JOE fan.

This is the live action movie the GI JOE fans would have loved -- GUARANTEED!",1279670400,4,1392,4.617886178861789
3960611,5,B002NXSRWK,"OK, I'll admit, I'm a bit older than most people watching GI Joe today.  I grew up on it, playing with the toys as a child.
I was at a friend's house, killing time after watching my hockey team get knocked out of the play-offs, and my friend puts this movie in.  I was going to argue, but he said to give it a chance.  I'm glad he did!
This is a serious movie, and not recommended for small children, like the age I was last time I watched the show.  In the opening scenes, a lot of people are killed, including a permanent member of GI Joe.  People are stabbed and shot with bullets, not blue lasers, then getting ""knocked out.""
All that being said, it had a pretty good plot, and predictable, but decent, finish.
All in all, I was surprised how much I liked it!  If this became an ongoing show, like on [Adult Swim] I'd stay up and watch it.  Though at that rate, they'd run out of characters to kill pretty fast.",1273104000,10,915,4.135593220338983
3960612,4,B002NXSRWK,"GI Joe Resolute, oddly enough debuted the same year as the motion picture movie GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra.  My brother and I were extreme fans of GI Joe in the 80s as we collected EVERYTHING GI Joe then.  This cartoon is by far the best cartoon adaptation, as the regular series was totally not accurate (Remember Lifeline was an extreme pacifist in the cartoon, but the toy came with a HUGE pistol, vehicles in the cartoon could fit large numbers of characters in them, etc.)

This cartoon series is directed to the older audience who enjoyed watching the 80s cartoon series, or reading the comics, or playing with the toys.  There is violence in this cartoon, much more than the 80s GI Joe The Movie (remember that 1.5 hour cartoon in the 80s?).  There are some of the good guys who actually dies in Resolute, but I they are not any of the main characters (Joes with no codename with the exception of one individual, Bazooka).

Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow face off in Resolute, probably the most favored of all GI Joe characters.  I remember playing with my friends in elementary school and we would fight and argue with each other on who could be Snake Eyes!  He was one of the few GI Joe figures that had several versions.  The comic series had some intense ninja action between these two individuals, and now you get to enjoy some of that type of action in this cartoon!

Now the bads....... there were some inaccuracies that made me give this review 4 out of 5 stars.
1.  Dial Tone was supposed to be a guy, not a girl!  I actually had this figure and he had a huge backpack thingy.  Resolute creators chose to give this girl the codename Dial Tone, as they said this character had enough dialogue to warrant her having a real Joe codename.
2.  Ripcord was supposed to be a caucasian person.  I think he looked African-American (same as the motion picture movie, which I was sad to see).  I too, owned this figure in the 80s.
3.  Snake Eyes lost his ability to speak..... not from Zartan the sniper (in Resolute), but he actually lost his ability to speak (and got his face massively disfigured) by a helicopter accident, as noted in the comic book series in the 80s.

Aside from the errors, I hope the creators will create more of the cartoon series (as the 80s cartoon had a lot more errors and the quality of the drawings was not there).  It is the same with the Transformers franchise in the 80s.  The Transformers the movie(80s movie cartoon) had superior animation/quality of drawings versus the regular cartoon series.

Should you buy this DVD?  If you grew up with the toy line in the 80s/early 90s, read the comic series in the 80s, or watched the 80s cartoon series........ then YES, you should definately buy this DVD.",1269475200,,2735,4.493927125506073
3960613,5,B002NXSRWK,"If you grew up watching GI Joe and to satiate your nostalgia, you watch the old series then find yourself disappointed by its tameness, well Warren Ellis and Justice League's Joaquim Dos Santos have something for you. GI Joe: Resolute is the 80s series all grown up. No more parachuting out of exploding planes. If COBRA troopers and Joes shoot each other, they take casualties. If they fall, they die. And so on. There's even a graphic assassination scene within the story. Just as COBRA Commander said, they laugh at me before. Now, they'll die (or something like that).

The story starts fast and never lets go. Fan favorites Gung Ho, Ripcord, Duke, Flint, Snake Eyes, Roadblock are all here and meaner than ever. It's satisfying action that was missing from the movie.",1269302400,,772,4.804511278195489

3960615,5,B002NXSRWK,"If you grew up watching the 80s cartoon, then this will be a rewarding experience.  Even if you hadn't read the comics, the way the Joes/Cobra are portrayed is very entertaining.

Gone is the bumbling Cobra Commander, gone is the scheming Destro/Baroness from the comics - now we see a united Cobra with the ability to take over the world and the balls to actually pull the trigger.

The only thing I was a little torn on was the Duke/Scarlett/Snakes triangle.. but you'll see what I mean when you watch it (for fans of the original comics).

The fight scenes are great between the ninjas - they went to great lengths to showcase Snakes' commando abilities as well as his ninja mastery.

Gun battles and high-altitude operations abound - well worth the money!",1267920000,,759,4.676691729323308
3960616,5,B002NXSRWK,"G.I. Joe: Resolute is the movie Rise of Cobra SHOULD have been!  The creators really took great care to give a fresher face to G.I. Joe, but still remain true to its 80's roots.  This is a movie made for us fans who grew up watching the Joe's in the 1980's.  It's classic, yet more mature, including more blood and the use of bullets, rather than colored lasers.  If, like me, you grew up with the battle cry of ""Yo, Joe!"" you have to get Resolute.",1267833600,,448,4.174418604651163

3960618,5,B002NXSRWK,"The movie and the animation is great. The fact that this is for adults and there are major characters that die and a city that is wiped out provide a further realism to it.
 The Live action movie should have followed this story and then maybe it would have been a good movie.

3960620,1,B002NXSRWK,"Resolute aspires to reinterpret the Joe universe for adults by ramping up the violence.  Long-established characters make cameos as corpses within the first few minutes in CSI fashion.  Cobra Commander angrily hacks up his troops with a sword.  The Joe team now find it acceptable to recklessly destroy civilian-populated areas (and likely contaminate many others) by using thinly-guised nuclear ""particle"" weapons in an all-out quest to kill Cobra Commander.  Joe and Cobra characters behave uncharacteristically and both sides are prone to say ""what the h---?"" within mere minutes of shoddy dialogue.  Snake-Eyes continues to be portrayed as a borderline superhero.  This all adds up to little more than cheap shock value and tedium.  It is GI Joe haphazardly interpreted by those (comic writer Warren Ellis this time) who care nothing about the franchise.  Save all the violent alterations, there is little in the way of plot and no comedy relief whatsoever.  This is ""edgy"" style without substance; Ellis ultimately has little to contribute.  The fact that so many fans have lapped this up is disturbing.  The GI Joe team I grew up with would do everything to protect the lives of innocents and avoid global catastrophy, not engage in the same amoral tactics of Cobra.  If we really must interpret that direction, isn't Ellis then saying something very negative about modern American militarism?  Really I don't think he has anything to say to begin with, but if this really is a definitive Joe team, as some fans believe, are we not then asking Hasbro for a very negative, reckless representation of US military professionals?

Both DC and Marvel have allowed similar direct-to-video short animated films (most are usually under 90 minutes) based on superhero characters.  Remarkably, Hasbro has followed suit by lifting previous restrictions on its property.  This is not animation for children by any stretch, though it is not anything I would recommend to other adults either.

The animation (which seems inspired by more recent Japanese style) is fantastic.  I loved the Duke-Snake-Eyes-Scarlett love triangle (which seeks to meld inconsistensies between the cartoons and comics).  It makes far more sense than the Rise of Cobra movie triangle and I felt it has been a long time coming.  Many Joes are depicted, though few have speaking parts.  It may ultimately be best to watch it with the mute button on.  There is no discernable plot anyway.  I found myself watching the DVD in more-digestable segments, similarly to how it was first broadcast on Cartoon Network.",1264204800,7,2576,5.15421686746988
3960621,5,B002NXSRWK,"I saw this one on late night TV not long ago and let me say its the way G.I. Joe was meant to be in my view! Don't get me wrong, I LOVED the 80's series. Still do as I recently purchased the re-release of them on DVD but this one appeals to me as an adult.

There was some things that were wrong with it, such as the sudden death of key characters like Bazooka but other than that, it was great!

There isn't much that I can add that hasn't already been said. I say enjoy it but I will also add to the voices in saying this version of G.I. Joe isn't for children! This is for late-teens to adults only!",1262217600,,602,3.846774193548387

The title is created for older children and there is some blood but not over the top gory like Manga.  I let my 6 year old watch it with no problems.  With the releaase of the adult movie, this cartoon comes off as feeling polished and edgy yet enjoyable for the entire family.  Originally airing in small segments this past summer, this cartoon develops a quick plot and ends it all in one hour.  There is no reason for the creators not to make a half hour series on late Friday's like the Clone Wars on Cartoon Network.  I would set my DVR and watch it and buy the season on disc afterwards...thats how good this cartoon turned out.  This is certainly worth the $12-$13 considering there is no tax or S&H if you buy over $25.  Enjoy!",1261612800,,847,4.276729559748428

3960626,5,B002NXSRWK,"This is the GI Joe for the new millennium, pass the terrible live action movie and watch this instead. This was created as a 'what if' series. It doesn't have to maintain continuity and anyone can die, being stand alone everything is fair game. This isn't a kids cartoon but its made to appeal to those who fondly remember GI Joe but want to see it with a Punisher MAX type twist. Resolute has much more in common with the Marvel Comic line than with the Sunbow cartoon. Without spoiling anything more people die in the first five minutes than in the entire Marvel comic series combined. The story is complete and give some closure but with plenty of option to make follow up. A great take on GI Joe with a modern, and more violent twist.",1260835200,,738,4.394160583941606

The storyline is well-concieved and implemented.  And the animation is top-notch.  I can't fault it for that.

However, the needless, long gun-fights where both parties are standing in front of eachother (no dodging) at almost point-blank range sometimes and nobody hits anybody...
AND

SEMI-SPOILER
The needless, abrupt, out-of-nowhere DEATH of severy key characters was ridiculous, and goes against the very nature of the classic GI-Joe series.

This movie had so much potential, but fell short.

Plus, it's not even a full-length feature.",1260316800,2,593,5.450549450549451
3960628,5,B002NXSRWK,"I grew up watching the original GI Joe cartoon.  It was part of my formative years and I started purchasing the DVD collections when they were recently re-released and it definitely holds a special place in my heart.  The issue that I run into now is ""Wow, this is pretty cheesy"".  GI Joe : Resolute is what I (as a 35 year old boy) have wanted to see : a more adult version of one of my beloved childhood cartoons.  The gloves are most definitely off in this DVD.

This is definitely not for children.  In the first 5 minutes, we see actual death as one of the classic Cobra characters shows up dead and Cobra Commander (in a much less whiny role) commits mass murder on a scale never before seen in GI Joe, or any other cartoon for that matter.

Fast paced and thoroughly enjoyable, I can watch this over and over again and I lend it to friends who always rave about it on returning the DVD.",1259971200,,893,4.2176470588235295
3960629,5,B002NXSRWK,"So what do I say that hasn't been said. Well I'll start off saying I enjoyed Stephen Sommers' ""G.I.Joe: Rise of Cobra."" I also enjoyed ""Transformers: Revenge of The Fallen."" Both could've have been much better, and ""G.I.Joe"" definitely had more potential and more done right than ""Transformers 2,"" but something felt a little off in the film. I think it was Snake Eyes' lips. They were SO damn distracting. I mean seriously he was the ""Pouting Ninja."" Angelina Jolie is jealous of his rubber lips. But I digress...this isn't about ""G.I.Joe: Lips of the Ninja,"" this is about the greatness that is ""Resolute.""

I first caught this when they aired it as a complete movie on Cartoon Network in April. I was blown away by the art, which is definitely anime influenced and better than any iteration of the Joes to hit the small screen since the 80's. Everyone looks pretty much as you remember. Hell Snake Eyes is in his ORIGINAL gear with the goggles, not the visor we've become accustomed to. Duke looks like Duke, Destro like Destro, and Cobra Commander like...well Cobra Comander. Everyone has been updated a little is all, making them look just a little more military. Cobra's higher echelon all look regal in their almost british/euro military looks (I loved what they did with Destro and Baroness). But what really makes this show shine is that it was targeted for people like me, who grew up watching the show and imagining epic battles in our rooms and backyars as we played with the toys.

What the writers (Thank you Warren Ellis) have done in an hour long space is to take everything we loved about ""Joe"" and turned the intesity up to 15, throw out the cheesiness and make it real. There's a body count, beloved characters die, there are no lasers, and pilots don't parachute to safety everytime. In short this is war, this is terrorism, this is G.I.JOE the way we always wanted it. I can only hope that we get some more like this because not since the 2002 ""Masters of The Universe"" cartoon, have I been so ecstatic over the return of something from my childhood. It was done right and with love. So if you're a fan GET THIS MOVIE! The tagline was ""No Lasers. No Parachutes."" and they were right. Now you know, and knowing is half the battle.",1257811200,3,2250,4.5945273631840795

This movie is specifically designed for fans of the original 80's cartoon who enjoyed it as children and who played with all the toys and are now adults.  It's GI Joe for ME, NOT my kids.

The movie is fantastic and as an adult who never felt the need to ""outgrow"" cartoons I enjoyed it throughly.

As others have said, if you were a Joe fan as a kid in the 80's then buy the movie, you'll love it.  Again understand that while the movie will be great for you it may be a bit much for your kids if you have them.",1257724800,,627,4.024193548387097

The animation is top notch.  The characterizations are respectful to the 80's mythology even though some liberties are taken with some of the origins like Snake-Eyes they don't take away at all from the enjoyment of the presentation.  Destro James McCullen is at last given his proper Scottish accent even though at times he does sound a bit like Sean Connery. Cobra Commander has been given a makeover with a sleek new battle helmet and Cobra Troopers are equipped with realistic SDU tech ops gear.

My biggest complaint is that Resolute is way too short!  Clocking in at only 58 minutes edited together from the original 7 minute Adult-Swim episodes into one seamless full-length story.  It would also be nice if this had been released on Blu-ray in full 1080p high definition with lossless audio but even though it is only on standard def DVD at 720p it still looks and sounds pretty darn good.

Well G.I. Joe Resolute is everything we remembered G.I. Joe as.  Big cast of old favorites, awesome action, beatiful animation, and of course some great ninja fights.  Cheezy dialogue that plagued the old cartoon is absent in this film.  Cobra Commander, without revealing too much, takes a psychotic persona similar to the Joker in the Batman: Dark Knight movie.
