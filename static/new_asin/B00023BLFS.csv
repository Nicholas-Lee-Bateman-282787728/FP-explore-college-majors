2057823,5,B00023BLFS,"This is by far the best multiplication dvd!  It gets the kids up dancing/singing and learning at the same time (great for visual/action learners)!  The first round of each segment gives the answer right away, the second round of each segment hesitates for the answer so the child can yell it out immediately and then wait for the confirmation (wish there was a little longer hesitation but it's pretty good).  You can select the segment you want by going to the menu - right now my grandson is learning his 2's and this is really helping!  We call the hamster the ""Rap Rat"" for fun!",1488326400,,582,4.514285714285714

2057847,5,B00023BLFS,I spend a lot of time and money purchasing and researching educational items for my grandchildren. This DVD is money well spent.  Even the grown ups in my van are tapping their fingers and dancing in their seats - its funny to watch.  Multiplication Rap is motivating.  The kids compete with the characters after a while and strive to beat them to the answer.  The music is energetic and clean! No worries about inappropriate language.

What I wasn't expecting was that the first grader got into it to. In fact he was taking notes trying to figure it all out. It's really been a hit for both of my sons. The raps are fun/not annoying. It is correlated to Common Core State Standards. It's perfect for homeschooling, and parents that work with their kids beyond school.

2057869,1,B00023BLFS,"Its a very long video of cartoon characters singing- not rhyming- the multiplication tables while the numbers flash on the screen.  I could sing this myself but it doesnt make you remember them any easier.  For example they sing to music,  3x3=9, 3x4=12, 3x5=15 and so on thru all the number sets.  This is the same thing we do on the flash cards, over and over but the tough ones to remember are still the tough ones to remember.  There's no catchy songs to help.  If you don't know the answer to 7x6 singing it is not going to make you remember.  Just like when you forget the words to a song.  Now I did order at the same time a book called Times Tables the  Fun Way by Judy Liataud and Dave Rodriguez.  THAT I would recommend for those kids who just get stuck on trying to remember the more difficult ones.  This book has a short story about a single fact for example 4x4=16  If you want to drive a 4x4 you have to be 16 to drive.  Some of the stories are a little corny and a stretch but at least its a better way to remember.  I am going to make my 8yr old listen to the video every day for his ""homework"" to see if it helps, but so far he hates it.  I don't recommend this product unles you can get it for $1",1394236800,,1215,4.004166666666666
2057870,1,B00023BLFS,"Unfortunately, this was a little too babyish for my 5th grader.  I was hoping for some cool rhyme or song method to learn by, but I don't think reciting 2x2 is 4, 2x3 is 6, etc to the same beat is what we were looking for.  Disappointed in the product.",1389484800,,252,4.02
2057871,5,B00023BLFS,"Rock N Learn is a great place to go for fun learning materials for your child.  They offer DVD's, CD's, and Apps to help engage your child while they learn.  We have been a fan of their products for some time now.  My kids like that they make learning fun!  They offer a variety of materials on different subjects too.  This is a nice way to help your child in an area that they might be having trouble in too.

My son has started 3rd grade this year.  I know that he will continue to learn more about multiplication.  I think this can be a challenging subject for some kids.  I am excited to incorporate the Rock N Learn Multiplication Rap DVD into helping him learn this.  He has already watched it once and he truly enjoyed it.  The songs in the DVD make this an enjoyable way for him to work on his math skills.

About the DVD
The Multiplication Rap DVD from Rock N Learn is in line with Common Core Standards too.  This DVD is suggested for children in 3rd grade and up.  The DVD includes songs that help your child learn their multiplication facts - up to 12.  It also incorporates skip counting.  My 1st grader is working on this right now.  Even though she is not in 3rd grade yet, there is something she can get out of the DVD too.  The DVD is a cartoon that has fun characters.  The DVD features a fun hamster.  The hamster is D.J. Roc Doc.  He is a hip hop hamster.

2057872,3,B00023BLFS,"as a user of Leapfrog DVD's, phonics, ABCs, and Math.. I feel like this video even though is not leap frog falls a bit short. The music and rapping of the times tables is okay at best I feel. I think my kids (7 and 5) are getting a little out of it... but the songs and music is pretty much the same throughout... and the video well,... my kids seem to get bored with it. but I will continue to put it on for the kids in the car until I find something else? by the way I also use times table charts and have them write the multiplication facts 4x's each, at least 1 sheet a day.",1380758400,,578,3.865546218487395

2057874,5,B00023BLFS,I had this DVD years ago when my daughter was learning multiplication and she was one of the fastest kids in her class to master all of her multiplication after watching this program.  NOw I purchased it for my 6 year old who is in advanced math and he is learning at a rapid speed as well!

Before this DVD my daughter did not remember her 3X's tables now not only does she know her 3x's tables but she also knows her 4, 5 & 6.

The rapping actually rhymes and there is a rhythm which is easy to memorize.  my daughter was able to mimic they rhyme and memorize her times table with the help of this DVD .  The best part of this DVD is when the rapping mouse gets done going through a list of numbers for example 2x2 = 2 , 2x3=6 and so forth . He will go through it again and the child would have to shout out the answer before he does .  I like it and think it is worth the money .

2057883,2,B00023BLFS,"Multiplication Rap is more fun than just rote memorization.  It gives the children another hook to hang their hat on as they are learning basic facts.  The more methods in which material can be presented to a child the more likely they are to understand and remember it.  I have searched far and wide for a multiplication cd/dvd/vhs to present the multiplication facts in a fun way.  This comes pretty close to what I hope to find.  My 7 year old daughter is mildly interested in it, I have to suggest that she watch it rather than her askinG to watch it.  She will then sit through the whole thing without complaint.  My 9 year old son is not at all interested.  I think a child under 7 would be more entertained by it.",1226361600,,720,4.32089552238806

Like its counterpart&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rock-N-Learn-Multiplication-Rock/dp/B00023BLG2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rock 'N Learn: Multiplication Rock</a>, it is best used as a reinforcement tool for students who are already working with multiplication tables in school.

Multiplication tables are shown sequentially from 2 x 1 to 2 x 12 and so on, up to 12 x 12, each set being repeated with a slight pause before the answer is given. This allows the child a chance to practice saying the tables. It also mentions multiplying numbers by zero and one as a part of the introduction.

Unfortunately, the ""rapping"" isn't very good (at least by current standards), and only takes place during the introductory and closing segments of each set of numbers.  While the tables are being shown, it is in the same monotone as the tables in Multiplication Rock, and this was a bit of a disappointment.  However, I must acknowledge that this DVD was made back in 2004, and I understand that an updated version is in the works, with better music and graphics.

Despite the bad rap, I've found that it's easier to get children to practice their multiplication tables when music and video are involved, so just choose whichever type of music you think would best hold your child's interest (rock or rap) and get the relevant DVD.  Both are helpful in getting children to repeat and memorize tables.

Recommended for students from around seven and up, who need a little help in memorizing the multiplication tables they're learning in school. (I would however suggest waiting for the updated version to see if they can beat the rap)

Rated: 3.5 stars

2057885,3,B00023BLFS,"This DVD is not one to teach your child the multiplication facts but one to use to sharpen their multiplication skills. The music is fast, loud and upbeat.

2057886,1,B00023BLFS,"The word ""rap"" being tied to this monstrosity is just laughable!  There isn't one single rhyme on the entire DVD, I could have recorded my students pounding better beats on their desks, and there's a bad 80's song out there somewhere that wants its keyboard riffs back.  I actually remember being taught by a ""rap"" technique in the 80's called ""wrap-ups"" that was 100 times more effective: it included worksheets and kinesthetic learning tools.  This DVD does not include any strategy.

I wanted a new tool to help out my struggling students- I don't mind corny- but I wouldn't even think about using this because it's not even catchy.  They go through each number sequentially and this is the extent of the rap: 4 x 1 is 4. 4 x 2 is 8. 4 x 3 is 12.  Say that outloud to a beat and call it teaching, but there's no way that this is going to stick in a childs head.

8021222,5,B00023BLFS,"This was the only DVD I could find that incorporates visual, audio and some fun into learning multiplication at a decent price.  My son struggles with math and I thought if we could cover all the ways to learn at once maybe he would do better. The graphics definitely leave much to be desired but honestly all of my kids from my 9 yeaar old to the 4 and 2 year olds like the movie. In the maain menu it also has a skip counting part as well which was a big bonus. I don't know how effective it is yet as we just bought it, but they are very excited and love to dance and sing the songs with the weird rat guy.",1516147200,,609,3.911290322580645
