8031950,5,B0002UA3XM,"This DVD is pretty slick, and contains some of DIR EN GREY's best performances. There is an equal mixture of old and new Diru (KISOU, VULGAR, WITHERING TO DEATH) and the editing and camera angles were done really well. Aside from the fact Kyo's hair keeps switching between blonde and black, I would swear it was all recorded at once, at one show. The best performance on here hasta be THE FINAL, the pyrotechnics kick in at just the right moment. I cry everytime I watch this, wishing I was there in the front... but alas, they'll probably NEVER come to SEATTLE or PORTLAND...",1176422400,,577,4.5576923076923075
8031951,5,B0002UA3XM,"This DVD contains an equal mix of both old and new Diru (KISOU, VULGAR, WITHERING TO DEATH) and they even throw in one of the poppier songs, JESSICA. Kyo actually smiles for once when he sings that one, lol. ^_^ The editing on this DVD is the best I've ever seen on anything. The only way you can tell it wasn'y all recorded at the same time is the fact Kyo's hair keeps switching between jet black and blonde. My favorite has to be THE FINAL, with the awesome pyrotechnics. Watching this makes me wish I was there, but alas... they'll probably NEVER come to SEATTLE.",1176422400,7,567,4.3584905660377355
