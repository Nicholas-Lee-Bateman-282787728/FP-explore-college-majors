5036723,5,B006XDU7W4,This Series is just too short leaves wanting more than what it gives you. The Stereo typical Harems Series though.,1338249600,,114,4.75
5036724,5,B006XDU7W4,I liked this anime. The only complain is that it left me wanted to see a bit more. This is especially true when you get a hint that someone tampered with IS suit that our hero touched. It would be good to see more. I recommend checking this one out!,1338249600,,249,4.0
5036725,5,B006XDU7W4,"This show was awesome I liked the new look on a moble suit and all the abilities each suit had.  I will always be a fan of mobile suit gundam wing with will forever be my favorite mobile suit mech anime, but this one was definently a solid second or third place",1335916800,,261,4.019230769230769
5036726,3,B006XDU7W4,"I heard a lot of good things about Infinite Stratos online before it came out and decided to check it out. What do I have to lose right, other than a few minutes of my day every week?

Story

Basically, the story revolves around this one guy who is the only one that can pilot an IS. Why? We are not really told ever. In fact, there really isn't a story line to really follow. The anime is mecha/harem mixed type of anime that follows the slice of life type format of story telling, which imho isn't that good if they do not know how to do it right. In this case, the anime suffers greatly from it because the slice of life type of format, more specifically focuses on the girls, hence it becomes a harem. Harems aren't necessarily a bad thing, but there's just so little room for error or rather they are much too generic for anyone with a more sophisticated taste to appreciate. In my opinion, I didn't really like that they focused more on the harem than on the mecha which was actually quite nice. I really liked the designs, weapons, etc the mechas had to offer, but alas the harem of course takes more of the time. I give the story a poor 2/5

Animation.
Very decent. Mechas, weapons, persons, are animated quite and it shows that they took some time in doing things. Very few stills, which is a good thing. 4/5.

Sound
Mainly for sound I like to focus on the characters voices, music and sound effects. For character voices they did a decent job. I always recognize Levy's voice from Black Lagoon and she was a perfect fit for Ichikas tough nosed sister. Music, didn't really stand out much to me. It's your typical J-pop stuff you might hear once and forget it. Sound effects decent. No qualms there. 3/5

Characters
Nothing much to say about the characters. I thought they were rather generic and didn't find any of them particularly interesting. They basically were just there. It is an harem after all, so you won't find any that will leave a lasting impression. 2/5

In conclusion, this is a pretty average anime and well to be honest most harems are pretty average. Lucky for IS the animation and mecha designs, fights, etc really saves it from being terrible. Characters and story are pretty poor and music is average. In all I give this a 2.5. Average.",1331337600,6,2267,4.4375
5036727,4,B006XDU7W4,"You get Infinite Stratos...

The concept behind the series is not bad. It borrows a bit from an older series called Sky Girls. There are differences indeed. Sky Girls does not have mechas behaving more like power suits that fit into a compact form they wear at all times. They also are more like personal jets than suits like this. When you look at them both, Infinite Stratos has an edge on design. For that reason alone, IS is worth a rental.

As a harem anime, IS fits in on par. Characters behave in traditional patterns and there are the common characters rehashed. You can somewhat predict how the story will go from that. If you are a fan of these sorts of shows, you will find some decent scenes here and there. It isn't a bad show and it is nice that there really isn't one completely clear winner girl throughout it. You know which girl is going to get more screen time but each of the girls make an impact on the guy, some more than others. The potential for a sequel is quite strong.

Had this series been released years ago, it might have been cleared for a full 24 episode season. That is perhaps one of it's biggest weaknesses. It is just a single season. Some of the character development with the other girls gets cut and the series tends to rely more on, the clueless guy with girls fighting over him, concept. That alone causes it to drop a star.

Harem animes have tended to slip more into this format in the past years. Something which is a bit of a shame. Love Hina is the textbook example of a good harem anime and it still is. Too often writers use the girls fighting over the numbskull to insert fanservice. Generic story + generic characters...just insert dumb guy...add girl fighting...blend!

The SciFi aspects of this series and the mecha designs alone are what brings IS out of the generic toilet. It is a bit generous to give it 4 stars but I can't quite give it 3 stars. So 3.5 rating on this would be best. At the very least, give it a rental if you have a renting service. It is worth at least that much.",1330387200,33,2038,4.324607329842932
5036728,3,B006XDU7W4,"Story: 2.5/5. There really is no story. It's another one of those harem type anime where the guy is the only if not few guys in a school of girls. Though I would recommend this over Maken-Ki, this show does not have much depth into it and leaves many things unexplained. It would be a given that the manga explains more considering what has and hasn't been covered in the anime series.

Characters: There will be a couple familiar voice actor/actresses here and there, such as the childhood friend of the main protagonist, who also voices a main heroine in Seitokai Yakuindomo and a handful of others. There's also some generic characters such as a chinese girl who has the tiger/cat tooth sticking out, which shows a bit of a peachy and cute side. A Natzi/german military girl, I can't dive too much into that yet. Another is a class representative, also blonde from a rich family, also another stereotype, and has a more tsundere type character. A few anime shows are following this format, along with the childhood friend more likely being more tomboyish and try to be perfect at everything and less reliant on our male character. I would say most people would pick this anime because they either have low standards, or because they simply love the characters. If you are buying this because you like Char, you are not alone and yes she is arguably the most popular of the fanbase as there's already trading cards made last year.

Animation: Decent/So So

DVD Details:

Languages: The Format is Hybrid, to those who don't know what that means, if a DVD has a Hybrid format, it means it carries both English Dub (English Voice Acting) and Japanese. New DVD's are coming with the feature where you either turn on English (typically without subtitles and some japanese text in the background of a scene does Not get translated), or with Japanese language with English subtitles and may or may not translate background text.

Packaging: I have yet to see it but I plan on preordering this anyways. I must warn the audience however.

WARNING: It does matter who the manufacturer/publisher is because it is the publisher who determines the quality of dvd covers. For example, Funimation released Shuffle! which is 4 DVDs. When opened, the inside also has art and the dvds are in their respective slots on either side of the dvd holders in one dvd cover. Sentai Filmworks, which is recently releasing DVD titles, (from my experience because I have bought Clannad and After Story and maybe one other title) have made a disappointing packaging. Firstly, the cover is too plain and simple. Secondly, when the dvd cover is opened, typically the inside of the case may be a bit flimsy, and so are the holders for the multiple dvds or single dvd. If you have a case for say Clannad, all 4 DVD's are placed on top of each other in one slot and the owner will panic because there is difficulty in getting the DVD out and its a pain to move 2-3 discs to get to the bottom and wondering if the bending of the DVDs (even a little) may damage and bend the dvd's permanently.

But I digress, if you are a fan of IS then go ahead and make the purchase, seeing how there may not be another publisher. I have not yet confirmed what the BD will be like but the BD covers generally are the same and should be much better compared to standard (lower than standard from Sentai Filmworks).

If you haven't figured it out yet, the publisher of Infinite Stratos is Sentai Filmworks, so you should be warned for their quality for packaging. However, there are other reasons why you should buy this dvd!

Extra Features! WOOHOO!

Contains episodes 1-12 plus the Encore OVA episode and a bonus music CD (most likely not a soundtrack but perhaps Singles Album or Character Song Collection, whether this is Eng or Jap has yet to be confirmed).

Special Features: Commentary, Behind The Scenes, Interview, Radio IS, Clean Opening Animation, Clean Closing Animation.
(See that? You get Commentary And Behind the Scenes And Interview AND radio talkshow! Now if this was all in Japanese this would definitely be most pleasing because in interviews/behind scenes/and especially commentaries which are becoming very popular, you get to hear the life of certain actor/actresses in the studio, or unlike in many western commentaries, instead of talking about merely the characters, the japanese features give a much more in depth/detail of level of understanding and background of characters that English Dubs hardly/never do. Other themes that actors/actresses are aware or learned from the director and sometimes gossip of a sequel or other spoilers in the same series may be mentioned.

Despite whether the packaging may or may not be satisfactory, this DVD box definitely comes jam-packed with a decent amount of extra features! And all for the price of 35.99 on rightstuf! Oh, and if you read this far congrats because I gave you the name of a site where you can buy anime much cheaper than here. (rightstuf has one f)",1327622400,15,4983,4.741339491916859

The treaty also ensures that every nation will be given the technology to prevent any one nation from becoming to dominate. As a result the nations of the world find an alternative use for these mechs competitive tournaments.

In addition these mechs shift the balance of society to women due to them being the only gender capable of controlling the mechs. So when years later a teenage boy is found capable of controlling the mechs there is only one thing to do force him to attend an all girls academy that trains mech pilots, but before he can adjust to his new surroundings his life gets even more complicated thanks to some old and new friends.

The animation, characters, story and English dub are awesome making this series one of my favorite Sci Fi / Mecha animes!

5036751,2,B006XDU7W4,"Now, as I'm sure you're aware, this is a Harem-Mecha anime.

They have a few of these out there....ok, they have a lot. I mean, guys like girls, they like Harem, and they like robot's, lets shove it all in one series!

Plot - Starring ""Generic Blue Haired Boy"", Infinite Stratos is our 10-minutes into the future world, where the ""Infinite Stratos"" (IS) is this body-suit mecha designed for military use, since it's creation it's taken the world by storm as well, any super mecha suit would. Only women can pilot it(Because a Wizard did it), outside of our Hero....because Wizard.  So now he's going to an all girls school to pilot a robot, he gets to have fun in the classroom and end the episode with Mech fighting, what could go wrong?

Genericness aside, I'm rather fond of the character designs. While Blue-Hair is just stupid...because he's generic and in every harem anime evah (cept a few good ones), the Female Lead, individual School Uniforms(Dayum they got these crazy uniforms) and the gay-option are all interesting characters to me.
Seriously, how often does the main character get a gay-option?  The trick is rather obvious and ruined in the pictures, and it's not really a gay option...but damn it, the idea was fresh enough!

Back to the bad, the series trips over itself on it's own logic, rules, and setting over and over.
Like how only girls can pilot the robots...so they're the dominate gender in the world and male and female gender roles are a little flipped, with Women supposed to protect men and such..because these robots are just that powerful. There are only 400-er-so Robots in existence, they're owned by the government for the most part, and you'll probably never see on in your life if you're not a character in the school this show takes place, so that makes no sense.  Then you've got them shouting the Robot's are banned from the military so they're ""A Sport only"" and for some reason, they give these robot's guns and swords and have them fight to the death gladiator style.....for war-testing of course.

I'm doing rather bad at reviewing/explaining this, but I think you get the Drift.

If you want a good Anime, this isn't for you. If you want to watch something that's short, and good for a calm relaxed watch, go for it, this series has enough fun to entertain you.  But turn your brain off. Fight Scenes are good, Mech designs are meh, Movement is awesome but don't expect their robot's to break, they just ""phase off"" cuz you know, it costs money to animate broken parts. Did you want some kinda Robot-fighting anime? Go watch Gurren Laggan if you want Action, Neon Genesis if you want some good(or really whiney) characters, Vandred if you want Harem-Mecha done a little better and longer, and Mobile Suit Gundam if you want good story.  Stream this, don't buy it until you've seen it.",1374624000,,2831,4.698989898989899

As the only man able to pilot an Infinite Stratos (IS) mech our hero is sent to a school for IS pilots, all of whom are female. With various additions this becomes a 5 + 1 situations. They could have moved the harem building along faster and then used the opportunity to explore some of the more interesting ideas that they casually toss aside. Who makes the pilotless IS units? Why did the German one go rogue? Just what else has the twisted genius created and why? None of these are followed and the opportunity to see tactics and battles develop alongside the fan service was missed. The mixture of CGI and cell animation is well done. The English soundtrack is okay but listen out for the worst English and German accents ever, ever, ever put onto an innocent soundtrack. Appalling as Cecilia would say.

5036764,4,B006XDU7W4,"There's nothing new or novel in Infinite Stratos. It's a straightforward 'harem' anime and it follows the predictable format. No major character development occurs and no surprise plot twists happen. Despite all of this, I rather enjoy the show.

While Infinite Stratos breaks no new ground, it does manage to follow the formula perfectly. Each character fits into well-established archetypes, but they still somehow manage to stay fairly fresh and as more than just paper cutouts. I particularly enjoy that instead of creating some over-the-top sob story or other clumsily manufactured emotional hook to try and develop interest in a character, Infinite Stratos is content to let the characters' personalities and actions drive earn their emotional appeal. It's more believable and much more entertaining, and it is one of the most refreshing aspects of the show.

Ultimately, it still is a harem anime, and sometimes character personalities are bent (or outright temporarily changed in a few instances) in order to move the plot along. Fortunately, these violations are not too common. This show also has a lot of very revealing 'fan service,' so if it isn't clear from the product details: this show is NOT FOR LITTLE KIDS. Teenagers and up should be fine.

In short: If you want a light-hearted, mindless show that follows a formula but at least follows it well, Infinite Stratos is a good choice. It's nothing I'll brag about watching, but in the short time I've owned it, it has made its way back into the playlist over and over again. It's a true guilty pleasure.",1351209600,,1570,5.007662835249042

5036766,4,B006XDU7W4,"""Infinite Stratos"" is an action-oriented harem comedy set at an academy where teens learn how to pilot light aircraft built around an IS (Infinite Stratos) system core.  The IS core provides a good deal of power, but they are not allowed to be used for military purposes, nor are they allowed to be used in space.  The biggest restriction on them, however, is that they can only be piloted by women.  The system simply won't work for men.

No men, that is, except for Ichika Orimura, who found out accidentally at the age of 15 that he could get an IS powered frame to function.  More than that, simply by touching the frame, he could intuitively understand its purpose and what it could do.  Seizing this unique opportunity, the Japanese government immediately enrolled Ichika in the academy.

The story is fun to watch, but somewhat lacking in the logic department.  For instance, if the frames are not allowed to be used for military purposes, why are all of them armed?  And if these frames are only used in ""games"", why do the participants shoot at each other with live ammo?  I guess these aren't your father's Olympic Games.  :P  They also make a big point of telling us that there are only 467 cores available IN THE ENTIRE WORLD because the inventor won't produce more than that.  And yet they turn right around and talk about ""mass producing"" frames.  You might as well try to ""mass produce"" nuclear submarines.  I'm also curious as to why they are training hundreds of pilots every year to fly these things, when they will get out of school and have nothing to fly...

The artwork is clean, and the color palette is bright.  The animation is at TV standard or above; the fight scenes were well done.  The music was adequate, but not memorable.  There is a fun bit in the ending credits where Ichika is running just in front of the girls who are ""chasing"" him.  The ""pack"" starts with just Ichika and Houki, but adds new girls as more girls are added to his ""harem"" in the story.  Recommended.",1347321600,,2003,4.554621848739496

A downside to the show is the lack of risk taken with the story, could definitely been more original or edgy. But i can forgive that.",1517788800,,466,4.35632183908046

Because of harem and story reasons, women are the only ones who can pilot their mechas. Due to this, being the only guy who can pilot a mecha immediately makes him the center of attention. The rest of the story involves the daily interactions between the main character and the other students, as well as the occasional enemy appearing to move the plot along.

- Comments: If you were looking for a strong, confident, non-hesistant main character; you will have to look elsewhere. The main character of the show is fairly weak compared to the other pilots. He's often protected by the other pilots.
Not only that, he isn't the smartest person out there, either. But his unique circumstances and kind-hearted personality helps win over the other female students without much effort. Furthermore, the main character is plain and common. He exhibits traits that are common in many anime characters that have harems.

- Features: English and Japanese audio with English subtitles. Includes 12 episodes on 2 DVDs for a total of about 5 hours. Comes with a bonus such as a soundtrack DVD and some special features for a total of 4 DVDs. Rated TV-14 for violence and fan-service.

- Conclusion: The main character is your standard character you will find in many other harems. The girls are cute, the mechas are unique and interesting and may be more appealing to those that prefer compact mechas. The fan-service is moderate and the scenes have plenty of comic-relief.
