2752894,2,B000N2HDIW,"I'm not sure what most of the other reviewers are seeing in this very poorly done production, but this is the worst movie commentaries I've seen by members of the former MST3k crew (which includes Nelson's commentaries on various remastered films from Legend Films).  It was actually worse than Hollywood After Dark, which I gave a higher rating than I would normally just because it showed potential.  Unfortunately, this only seems to defy my belief in the potential by being duller than Hollywood After Dark.

The film itself is ripe for the jesting on so many levels, but like Hollywood After Dark there are so many moments where they just let the movie go on by itself, and usually during moments of silence.  Furthermore, the jokes made typically just weren't funny.  Not from lack of trying, but more from the lack of a solid writing team like the one that was present with MST3K.  Sure, we love Mike's on screen attitude and look/sound, but it greatly shows that the trio sadly needs the rest of the writing crew from MST3K and just aren't capable of providing the overall quality that most of us look for in these type of movies.

The one good thing I can say about Killers From Space, in comparison to Hollywood After Dark, is that at least one of the skits was funny (the dead pan look - they gave it some name I can hardly recall let alone spell).  The bonus skit was just a waste of time.  It was a cute idea, but it was ruined with using lines that just weren't funny.

When I rated Hollywood After Dark, I gave it +1 star since it had the potential.  I cannot do the same here.  Considering I barely laughed once through the whole movie and had to watch it twice in a row to really see it all since the first time I ended up checking my e-mail and browsing the Web after I lost interest in the movie and the commentary about half an hour into it.

Again, if you're a fan of MST3K, you'll probably want to own this regardless of how bad it is (or isn't; your opinion may vary).  But, if you're new to these types of productions, go out and get one of the MST3K volumes rather than this.  They have more movies and at least one of them will be a whole lot more fun to watch than either of the Film Crew films out so far.",1188172800,7,2233,4.2959427207637235
2752895,5,B000N2HDIW,"Not content just to leave us with a bad movie about ""stripping"", The Film Crew hits us between the ""Eyes"" with their second release, ""Killers From Space"".

One of the eight Ka-zillion cheaply made sci-fi movies produced during the 1950's; the plot is rather typical. Peter ""Don't Mention My Brother"" Graves is a noted, if not notable scientist who's plane drops like a rock after circling an atomic blast. He shows up days later in a confused state, which seems fairly normal for him, despite a large L-shaped magic marker stain on his chest passing for a scar. Seven hours into the movie (or so it seems), Pete ""remembers"" that he ran into some optically challenged aliens sporting cumber bunds after his plane crash who want to ""take over"" or ""kill something"" or maybe just fiddle with some dials.  Whatever, they have to be destroyed if only for the sake of good taste and Pete figures that turning off the electricity will do it...and so it does.

And I thought ""Hollywood After Dark"" was dirt cheap, this piece of work makes a Roger Corman film look like ""Ben Hur"".  Peter ""Next on Biography"" Graves is pretty bad, unless you compare his performance to the sets, special effects, & every other actor in the film. In which case, he deserves an Oscar just for surviving this mess.

The Film Crew is again in top form, though they really pound the ""Biography"" aspect into the ground. The two skits are really good, especially the one after the film and they won't disappoint any MST3K fan out there.  The ""Special Feature"" tops the one in ""Hollywood After Dark"" and while I won't give it away, I will suggest that you don't immediately choose a topic and just watch Kevin Murphy.

Once again, I was not pleased with the limitations of the DVD and would suggest that they add scene selection to the menu and perhaps an alternate audio channel that just has the film dialogue.  But these are fairly minor nits that won't stop me from purchasing the next release from The Film Crew.

Tidbits:

- Hard to believe, but two years after this debacle was released, Peter Graves turned in a very good performance in ""Night of the Hunter"".

- The final explosion seen through the window is from one of the many atomic bomb tests performed in the Pacific Ocean just after WWII.  And judging from the view, the power plant must be 25,000 feet above sea level.

- Although they don't have the robots, it is interesting that The Film Crew falls into the same patter. Mike still seems to be the leader, Kevin's comments are very similar to what Tom Servo used to say, and Bill has the same short fuse with movies like this as his counterpart Crow T. Robot.",1187827200,8,2643,4.5741525423728815
2752896,5,B000N2HDIW,"I like this episode better than ""Hollywood After Dark"" (which I gave 4 stars) and it really seems to fit the ol' MST3K groove.  It is strange to hear the same late Mike era voices without the shadows of the bots and Mike.  The commentary is as funny as ever from these guys.  I look forward to more.

2752897,5,B000N2HDIW,"After 'Hollywood After Dark', The Film Crew set its eyes on a prime (and, by some accounts, long-standing) target called 'Killers From Space'. On this DVD episode, it's easy to tell that the crew are becoming more comfortable, as the sketches are even better and the extra 'Did You Know...' is considerably funnier than the extra on the first release. The actual movie riffing is on par with 'Hollywood'--high-quality, with the occasional miss. It definitely feels like the latter MST episodes with each member pulling their weight in riffs, but with the welcome move toward more of a PG-13 environment.

I'm looking forward to the remaining two releases, and left wondering if more are in the works. Here's hoping they do, because The Film Crew just seems to get better.",1187222400,3,771,4.930769230769231

I liked Hollywood After Dark, that was hilarious and I thought was on par with some of the best episodes of MST3K.  However, Killers From Space is on par with some of the worst.  Wait for the next episode coming next month, I'm sure that will be better.  I'm giving it 3 stars because I like this series, but really it deserves a 2.",1187049600,3,518,4.309278350515464
2752899,4,B000N2HDIW,"This is the second DVD from Mystery Science Theater 3000 veterans Kevin Murphy, Mike Nelson and Bill Corbett, now calling themselves ""The Film Crew"" and it's great to hear them working together again. The synergy is still there when these guys get together to make fun of a bad movie and the results are both really funny and entertaining.

Killers From Space is a 1954 black and white science fiction movie directed by W. Lee Wilder, the brother of the much better director Billy Wilder. If you've seen any of W. Lee's work before (e.g., The Snow Creature) you know you're likely in for a dull, hilariously bad film, and Killers From Space does not disappoint! From the dull opening filled with narration over stock footage to the goggle-eyed aliens in jump suits, to scenes of Peter Graves endlessly running away from rear projections of ""giant"" lizards and insects, this film will alternately make you howl with laughter and nearly doze off to sleep. It is also interesting to note that this is one of the first films wherein a human is taken by aliens, has medical work performed on him, and then has ""missing time"" and can't remember what happened. It is the only lasting significant, if dubious, contribution to our popular culture this film has to make.

The Film Crew commentary is sharp and funny throughout most of this clunker of a film, although when the film slows to a crawl in the middle there does seem to be a lull in the commentary as well. It's as if the film was so vacuous at that point that it was hard to generate jokes about it. However, once action commences again as the hero races to save the world the jokes pick up too.

The host segments are funny, especially the one in the middle of the film called the ""lunch break"" and the closing sketch is quite good as well. There is a brief sketch included as an extra feature that is also worth watching. Please note that the jokes on this DVD are intermittently a bit more PG-13 style than what was done on MST3K, so you might want to screen it yourself first before sharing it with younger children.

I definitely recommend this entry from The Film Crew, it is just as enjoyable as their first DVD, ""Hollywood After Dark"" and I'm looking forward to the next couple releases from them, Wild Women Of Wongo and Giant Of Marathon. Any comedy fan would enjoy this, but it's especially recommended for fans of MST3K and old B-grade SF movies. Mike, Kevin, Bill, it's great to have you back in our living rooms riffing away at new material!",1186617600,15,2508,4.554323725055433
2752900,4,B000N2HDIW,"As was the case with the first Film Crew disc, ""Hollywood After Dark,"" the second release also seems slightly out of practice in terms of the riffing.  While there may be fewer 'clunkers' in the jokes, as some reviewers have commented, there are also fewer direct hits.  However, this second release is a slight step up.  The 'host segments' are significantly funnier, and the riffing itself is improved, eliciting a number of full throated laughs from this particular viewer.  Not to mention, of course, that the film is an abysmal piece of '50s sci-fi trash starring Peter Graves, and featuring some typically terrible editing and camerawork.  The story goes nowhere...and it goes there slowly.  In short, the film would've been a classic episode of Mystery Science Theater, and it is used admirably here as well.  If only there were a silhouette, this would be virtually indistinguishable from MST3K.

And yes, for those who are wondering, the riffing is still at a slightly more 'mature' level than MST's standard 'saturday morning cartoon' rating.  Nothing overbearing, but a few sex based jokes and a few weak swear words.  Most viewers will barely register the elevation in 'adult content.'",1186444800,12,1197,5.061224489795919

2752907,4,B000N2HDIW,"The Film Crew consists of three alumni of the great movie-mocking TV show, MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000.  The premise for this project is not that Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett are trapped in an orbiting satellite; instead, they're three lowly employees at a DVD distributor, charged by their boss to create a commentary track for every movie they release, no matter how obscure or painful.

KILLERS FROM SPACE is the second film to be mocked by The Film Crew and its sheer goofiness makes it a perfect target.  Peter Graves stars as a nuclear physicist whose exact job is unclear, but it involves riding around in air force jet planes over nuclear tests and making wry comments.

After Peter Graves' jet crashes and burns during an atomic test, the army becomes a little suspicious when he turns up relatively unscathed and insisting that he be allowed to keep his top secret clearance and access to government files on nuclear weaponry.  These suspicions turn out to be somewhat justified when Peter Graves starts having visions of bizarre alien creatures who apparently share an optometrist with Sesame Street's Cookie Monster.

Even more than the first entry in the The Film Crew series, KILLERS FROM SPACE really felt to me like the return of MST3k.  Although the theater seat silhouette is still absent, the overall style of the episode felt very familiar.  Perhaps it was simply the presence of Peter Graves who appeared in more MST3k movies than almost any individual actor.  Maybe it was the choice of a science fiction film.  Or possibly it was because this type of bad film lended itself to sillier jokes rather than the more risqu comments from the previous Film Crew movie (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Film-Crew-Hollywood-After-Dark/dp/B000TGQOK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Film Crew: Hollywood After Dark</a>, a so-called thriller starring a stripping Rue McClanahan).  Even the DVD extra (where the Film Crew repeatedly dub differing ""out-takes"" over one of the sillier moments from the movie) reminded me of the type of thing that old-school, Joel-era MST3k would have done.

I'd hold up KILLERS FROM SPACE along with some of the better episodes of MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER.  I laughed out loud many, many times, and more than once I was forced to rewind in order to watch something I had missed while laughing.  I'd recently viewed the MST3k treatment of PARTS: THE CLONUS HORROR and with the shared jokes about Peter Graves, watching this made me feel very much at home.

(The DVD comes with a single extra, the aforementioned dubbing of additional dialog over a scene.  While this is mildly amusing, what is actually much funnier is the animated menu on the DVD Extras section which features Kevin Murphy becoming increasingly frustrated waiting for the user to hurry up and make a selection.)",1208390400,,2866,5.157667386609071
2752908,4,B000N2HDIW,"""Killers From Space"" is the second release from the ""Film Crew"".  Three of the members of MST3K have joined together to have another go at schlock.  This movie is ideal for an MST3K-type treatment, and the Crew does a pretty good job at riffing this wiener of a movie.  The plot is that Peter Graves, atomic scientist is forced by the aliens to deliver key test data after reviving him from an otherwise fatal plane crash.  The aliens are mutating a bunch of lizards and insects to destroy all life, so they can move in.  Naturally, no one believes him so he undertakes to shut down the power source the aliens are tapping.  The movie itself is some sort of early Fellini film: bizarre insert shots of closeups, Killers who don't show up for almost 20minutes into the movie and frankly aren't all that threatening, and the smoking.  My goodness, the smoking, folks are lighting up every 10 minutes or so (maybe a tobacco company was a sponsor-not unusual in the 50's).  Is this equivalent to a great MST3K episode?  Well, maybe not a best-effort, but I think it is certainly competitive with the last two seasons of MST3k.  Recommended.",1207612800,,1136,4.635

You've still got the host segments, albeit one or two less per episode (which is a pro or a con depending on the situation) but youve lost the silhouettes, which is indeed sad as it cuts out any number of visual gags that were always enjoyable (check into Cinematic Titanic, the other MST spin off for that).  But all in all its still the same lovable mike, tom, and (new) crow, some of the funniest most ingenious guys to ever hit any shade of screen anywhere..

As for the title its self, you can't go wrong with peter graves in atrocious B's horror/sci-fi films.  The piss poor production/acting/scrip and bug eye aliens in this feature need no mockery to produce guffaw a plenty all on its lonesome.

So in all, if you miss the crew of the SOL, this is a more than suitable substitute for your fix of wry witty film savagery.

For those new to the ""guy making fun of a movie"" thing, Id advise you pick up a MST3K box set first (also available on amazon no less!), as they strike the pallet a little cleaner, but by no means avoid the fun of ""the film crew"".

Unlike that film, ""Killers From Space"" is a delightfully bad, hence intrinsically more entertaining grade-C sci-fi cheapo, and so should have been perfect for the Crew. But the old ""MST3K"" spark is simply missing. There are some really good one-liners along the way, but they are too few and far-between. Set-up skits and interstitials are boring. The print, by the way, is terrible, although there were excellent prints of this title still being shown on local tv through the 80s (I know, I edited one for tv, a pristine print from Paramount, which held distribution rights). The heavy scratches and splices are annoying and distracting. I feel, reading other reviews, that the Crew is simply coasting on goodwill left over from MST3K, and here I must agree with the hated SCI FI Channel executive Stephen Chao, who killed MST3K because he felt it ""wasn't funny enough.""

Like many others I miss the silhouettes in the corner, and generally find the host segments to be weaker than MST3K due to the loss of tension between the imprisoned filmgoers and the mad scientists. Despite these relatively minor critiques, I still enjoyed the film, and hope for many future Film Crew releases.

The film itself is an early horror film starring Peter Graves against aliens and the military industrial leadership. Given the era, it's obvious that nuclear energy plays a key role in the film, hilariously represented here by either stock footage of very lame special effects. While I like Peter Graves, in this he is totally wooden, which makes him an easy target for skewering. Obviously Graves is eventually vindicated in a climactic scene that is as humorous as it is ludicrous.

While the Film Crew is not MST3K, they do spend more time working the movie, rather than messing around with props and side stories.  Which is good or bad, depending on what you liked about MST3K.

8174174,5,B000N2HDIW,Mike and crew really hit it out of the park with this one.  I'd rank it up there with Manos Hands of Fate!,1362182400,,106,3.608695652173913
8174175,4,B000N2HDIW,From the MST3k vets: a movie about highly incompetent aliens with bulging eyes trying to conquer the world with giant cockroaches and giant cockroach-burning rays. Starring Peter Graves in a forgettable role as a brainwashed scientist this film is made worth watching by the wisecracks of the Film Crew!,1322179200,,303,5.204081632653061
8174176,3,B000N2HDIW,"I ended up getting the final round of Film Crew discs after enjoying ""The Giant of Marathon"" and ""Hollywood After Dark"".  The first one I popped in was ""Killers From Space"" starring frequent Mystery Science Theater 3000 actor, Peter Graves.  Was I prepared for more references to ""Biography""?  You better believe it.

""Killers from Space"" has all the hallmarks of a classic bad movie just asking for the riffing treatment.  It's a black and white 50's sci-fi thriller that contains not only aliens from another world but atomic mutations!  That's right two genre clichs in one film.

Peter Graves is a scientist who is popped into a jet fighter and sent to monitor an atomic test blast from above.  While flying above the blast zone he notices something shimmering in the desert.  As the jet moves to investigate, things go horribly wrong.  The jet is downed and the blast occurs.

But fear not, Graves miraculously shows up the next day unharmed except for a surgical scar on his chest.  His doctor and co-workers are baffled by his condition, and Graves discovers that his dreams are plagued by visions of men with ping pong ball eyes.  Could it be that Graves is controlled by some unknown force!?!

I've actually made the movie sound much more interesting than it turns out to be.  The basic idea is actually good solid sci-fi pulp fodder.  With the right approach a nifty little movie could have been made.  Instead, turgid direction, slow ponderous acting and some really bad editing sucks all the joy from the film.

In particular this movie suffers from a saggy middle section.  The opening scenes with the jet and atomic blast are actually pretty good and goofy enough to provide lots of laughs.  The ending with Graves running around trying to stop the aliens (or is he controlled by them?) is also pretty solid.  But that middle portion with Graves sneaking around and lots of long pointless conversations between grey lumpy faced men just slows the film to a halt.

Even the big moment of the alien reveal and the appearance of giant mutated desert beasts doesn't do anything more than annoy the viewer with a very long, very pointless chase scene with poor special effects.

Fans of bad movies will enjoy a nice game of spot the actor.  Most of these guys have shown up in a Mystery Science Theatre film at some point.  I recognized one man from ""The Atomic Brain"" and another who was in ""Miracle on 34th Street"".  And keep an eye on one of the workers in the power station - could it be Coleman Francis (of ""Red Zone Cuba"" and ""Sky Divers"" fame)?  Some mysteries were never meant to be solved.

So where does that leave Mike, Bill and Kevin?  Well this type of movie works pretty well for them.  The bookends are great material and they really roll with it.  The whole atomic test/jet sequence is riffed perfectly and I was laughing pretty hard.  The finale was also really funny.  But that middle section, especially the talky scenes was tough.  They did their best, but it was a bit of a drag.  I was actually thankful that the lunch break popped up when it did.

Speaking of host segments there are three.  The first is the introduction to the movie with Bob Honcho talking about male body parts and funerals.  Then Kevin goes a bit crazy and won't let Mike and Kevin eat their lunches, but insists on discussing some bit of trivia.  The final segment deals with a little known film technique that involves reaction shots provided by actors who are completely devoid of any living spark.  Are they dead, or are they acting?

The extras include a bit about the alien language used in the film.  It is followed by outtakes from the film in which the alien language is translated.

Not a bad outing all together. Once again the movie itself seems to be the major hurdle here.  The saggy middle slows the laughs down, but the bookends are definitely worth seeing.  Basically I give it the same score I gave the previous two Film Crew discs.",1247443200,4,3953,4.616379310344827
8174177,3,B000N2HDIW,"With the MST3K Alumni now divided into the RiffTrax and Cinematic Titanic camps, it's easy to see ""The Film Crew"" for what it was...an interim project, and experiment, something that led the team of Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett to bigger and better things (RiffTrax).

We all loved the 'bots, and while Cinematic Titanic re-instituted the ""silhouettes"" gimmick, both teams are 'bot-less. In ""Killers From Space,"" we have MST3K-style cast skits that break up the movie. ""Killers"" isn't a ""so bad it's good"" film, it is simply bad and dull.

In terms of the ""Film Crew"" vibe, Nelson and company are just trying too hard. The ""Mission Impossible Meets Dr. Clayton Forrester"" thing is forced, as if they were trying to copy MST3K's format without looking like they were trying to copy it (which made it look exactly like copying).

The three stars in my review are basically a star each for Mike, Kevin, and Bill for getting back on the horse and giving the fans what they wanted...wise cracks over bad movies. Of course, what the fans really want is a full-blown, 'bots-included MST3K reunion, and that remains to be seen...or not.

Thanks, Mike and Kevin and Bill. Keep on riffin' in the free world.",1237507200,,1211,4.8076923076923075
