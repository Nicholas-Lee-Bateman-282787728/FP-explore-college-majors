8226828,3,B000X3FF6I,"I ordered this DVD for our 11 year-old son, thinking it would be an enjoyable learning piece for him, given his fascination of Marine Biology.

As we found this to have beautiful underwater filming, and somewhat informative segments, it was very lengthy, and soon became boring. Not just to our son, but our entire family.

Also, it is not a good device to use scholastically; our son knew most of what was discussed in the DVD (about the different fish and their habitats) from his 5th grade education.

So, if you're just looking to buy a DVD with some very beautiful underwater scenes, this one is fine. BUT, if you're wanting something more of a study guide, I'd pass.",1241568000,2,672,4.630252100840337
8226829,4,B000X3FF6I,"Awesome video, very informative. Easy selection of types of fish / etc. to see video and facts of that species. Was hoping to see a wider variety of marine/aquarium fish. But still is a great video. I would recommend this to others.",1229472000,,232,4.5476190476190474
8226830,5,B000X3FF6I,"Obviously a heck of a lot of work went into this. Hats off to the makers. Stunning footage, easy menu, incredibly informative. I use this as a teaching tool and highly recommend to anyone who is interested in life beneath the sea.",1218153600,6,230,4.5
8226831,4,B000X3FF6I,"This DVD is awesome as an instructional, fairly comprehensive guide to marine life. It can not, however, be used as a reference to look up species and search, for instance, for the name of a fish sighted. The best way to use this DVD is as an enjoyable movie of all varieties of fish life. The camera work is exceptional, the number of species highlighted is good, the facts presented about each species are interesting. All in all, a great value and a good way to prepare for carribean dives but cannot be used as a reference.",1197590400,2,527,4.443298969072165
8226832,5,B000X3FF6I,"I own the German version of this DVD and love it. This is really what I've been waiting for. I took my laptop and this encyclopedia along on my last diving vacation and was able to learn so much about what I was seeing underwater. There are really facts in this DVD that are hardly known even by diving instructors - as I found out! The menu makes it really easy to find what one is looking for and the films are not only informative, but also entertaining and full of beautiful footage. I highly recommend it!",1194480000,8,510,4.268041237113402
