8046252,2,B00079HWNC,These episodes were recorded right from the TV. I brought Seasons 3 & 4 at Target and they have every episode on each plus they have a clear picture. Now I will have to spend another $10 to get the complete Season 2. I'll just give this one away. Very disappointed.,1371686400,,265,4.215686274509804
