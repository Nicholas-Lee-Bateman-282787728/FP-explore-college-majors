8280407,5,B001AYXB7O,"This DVD is for the true TSC fan. My gut tells me that ""Live at Full House"" is not worth the disappointment. With that said, I would watch this footage prior to the Council's latest collection, ""On Film,"" in which we see Weller and his gang polished and as good as they ever were on stage. This is a fun performance nevertheless, with both renditions of ""My Ever Changing Moods"" --fast and slow-- among other things.",1230163200,,416,4.4868421052631575
