2773511,5,B000NOK0MQ,"Martin & Lewis shine in this beautifully put together set of these fun and glossy movies.  It's a treat, especially considering that 4 out of the 5 movies are produced in the great widescreen format of VistaVision  - so the visual clarity is especially acute, plus all 5 movies are in color which is made fine use of, particularly in the whimsical 'Artists and Models'.  The design of the DVD box - which opens up like a triptych - is excellent and includes reproductions of the 5 original movie posters plus a fine montage of stills from the movies.  So enjoy 5 entertaining movies with the cool and suave Dean Martin and the manic brilliance of Jerry Lewis.",1181088000,3,659,4.559322033898305

2773515,3,B000NOK0MQ,"Most fans and critics agree, the last eight Martin & Lewis comedies are not the quality that the first eight are.  In fact, Jerry Lewis has stated many times that he himself has never watched ""Hollywood or Bust"", because it is ""too painful"", indeed, the behind-the-scenes bickering between the two is apparent in the films.

To some degree, ""Three Ring Circus"" is no loss, because it is notorious for fighting between Jerry and Dean.  However, ""Money from Home"" should certainly be avaliable, it is Dean and Jerry's first color motion picture, and only 3D.

The titles that are avaliable on this collection include fan favorites:  ""Artists and Models"" and ""Living It Up"".  One crtitic wrote, in ENFANTE TERRIBLE (see books) that ""Rain Main"" is a remake of ""Hollywood or Bust"".  ""You're Never Too Young"" is my personal favorite of this bunch.

Being a completist, I certainly will be getting this set, but I would love for Paramount--and other companies--to continue releasing Jerry's solo catalogue, we still need:  ""Rock-a-Bye Baby"", ""The Geisha Boy"", ""Visit to a Small Planet"", ""Who's Minding the Store?"", ""Three on a Couch"", ""Which Way to the Front?"",  ""Hardly Working"", ""Smorgasbord"", and ""Fight for Life"".",1173052800,24,1210,5.096446700507614

As a result, I had to give the set a four-star rating instead of a five for this glaring oversight.

However, the final films of the ""dynamic duo"" are quite good (and in COLOR!), in spite of the fact that building tensions between Martin & Lewis were heading towards an inevitable split.

But I'll take the bad with the good and still look forward to a second helping of Dean & Jerry!",1172966400,4,637,4.5701754385964914

It's clear to see that whoever owns the rights to these films is trying to make a killing here.  Packaging several rather poor films with one a lot of fans really want, and at this price, is not very good.  M & L films started going downhill and that trajectory is made up of the films in this collection.  'Hollywood' remains popular with their fans because it was their last one.  I imagine the owners are going to stick it to us fans one more time.  Something tells me Lewis is the guy calling the shots on this effort.

The films are blessed with high production values and shot in bright, beautiful color. Paramount has done a beautiful job preparing these for DVD--it looks like they have actually gone back to the original VistaVision negatives for the transfers. I was constantly amazed while watching these films of just how good they looked. Plus, they're still funny and don't need to resort to profanity and bodily fluids for laughs.

2773674,5,B000NOK0MQ,"I was there when they made this, I was 16 and looked 16, but they thought I was 18 looking 16.  It was summer vacation and my music teacher got me the gig.  I drove to Hollywood at 5 in the morning everyday for 2 weeks, I was in one shot, at the school when Dean says ""here comes the reception committe now"".. a girls band starts out and the music was ""face the music"", I even remember the words.  As I said I was there for 2 weeks, and made 50 dollars a day.  We sat on the sidelines and waited in case they needed us for anything else but that one shot, so I made good friends, good money, and good memories.  Dean would show up at the last min. and go over a few things, and boom the music would start they would film his song and dance and off he would go.  Jerry on the other hand would go over and over his lines and his dances and stay long after to play with the crew.  One time a very nicely dressed older man came on the set, Jerry was dancing and all of a sudden he knocked this mans hat off, pulled him down on a bench and began to cut his tie off, I stood there with my mouth open and all of the crew were in stitches, I found out later that he was one of the producers, and Jerry buys him hats and ties galore, and so he felt, I guess, he could distroy any of them he wanted.  That was a summer I will never forget, they gave everyone Christmas gifts (Canasta Cards with their faces on them) and some other things, and to this day I remember it just like it was yesterday.

2773721,5,B000NOK0MQ,"This set has the two best Martin & Lewis films--You're Never Too Young and Living It Up.  The price of the set is worth it for these two alone.

You're Never Too Young is the team's best film, one that can be watched over and over again, as Jerry plays a little boy who is obviously much bigger than he claims! Musical numbers are great, especially the marching song. Add a jewel mystery and an all-girls school and you have non-stop comedy.

Living It Up is another great movie, though there are a couple of slower parts that drag the pace down a bit.  Jerry is ""dying"" and brought to New York by a newspaper for his final days.  Dino is great as a ""doctor"" who turns on the charm every time he opens his mouth.

Pardners is pretty good.  But it seems that the other two aren't quite in the same category--the more women they added to their films, the worse the quality of the movies.  And the other two have LOTS of women in them but much less comedy.",1217289600,2,953,4.226519337016574

So far, the only method of legally obtaining a copy was to buy this collection.  Of all the movies included, Artists and Models is by far the best.  It's worth buying the collection merely for the ""bathtub scene"" with Jerry and Dean, and the ""stairway scene"" with Jerry and Shirley MacLaine, and we particularly love ""Mr. Murdock"" and his high-functioning office.  If you are a Jerry Lewis fan, Artists and Models is certainly going to be enjoyable for you.

2773758,5,B000NOK0MQ,"The last five films made by Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis in the 1950s make for fine family viewing, full of outrageous silliness.  Lewis always plays the loud, irrepressible big kid to Martin's smooth crooner.

My favorite of the bunch is ""Hollywood or Bust,"" in which rich kid Jerry teams up with con artist Dean for a cross-country road trip with lots of songs, girls, and a happy ending at a movie premiere.  ""Living It Up"" finds Jerry mistakenly diagnosed with a fatal disease; a New York newspaper brings him to the Big Apple to document his last days.  Dean plays his doctor who falls for reporter Janet Leigh.  In ""Pardners,""  the boys head out west to help a gal who's trying to keep her ranch from being taken over by the bad guys.  Jerry masquerades as a 12-year old to escape a diamond thief in ""You're Never Too Young,"" and ends up hiding in a girls' school where Dean is the music teacher.  In ""Artists and Models,"" the boys are roommates; Dean is an artist and Jerry dreams about superheroes.  They fall in love with Dorothy Malone and Shirley MacLaine who live upstairs.

There's nothing even remotely resembling sophistication in either plot or acting; it's all over-the-top, madcap hi-jinks that the kids are sure to enjoy.  Jerry is very funny and steals all his scenes, Dean sings two or three dreamy ballads, and there's some innocent romance in each movie.

2773829,4,B000NOK0MQ,"It was considered rather odd when C.S. Lewis, in the already oddly titled, but very readable book, An Experiment in Criticism, suggested not that there were different kinds of books, but different kinds of readers. As regards Jerry Lewis films, I'd suggest that there are different sorts of viewers. Briefly that means one sort like his films and another sort don't. I count myself firmly in the former camp, considering him one of the all time great comic talents. Having said that, however, these films are nevertheless very much of their era.

For one thing, they take that era entirely for granted in a way that other comic films don't. Laurel and Hardy's last film, Utopia, although in black and white, seems yet far more universal than these Lewis/ Martin films. Why? A few reasons come to mind. The easiest thing for Hollywood to write about is Hollywood. In that sense, Hollywood or Bust is the strangest film in this set. Strange because it takes the adventurers so long to get there. Thus it fails both as a road trip picture and the standard ""making it in Hollywood"" faire. That said, there are many great comic moments, which brings up the next point.

These films were obviously meant to showcase the duo's immense talents. In that sense, they are never acting in a movie as much as the movie is unrolling around them. This sort of star power is virtually unknown today, but in the 'fifties, it could easily cross into various media: movies, TV variety shows (adapted from radio), Las Vegas stand up. The Colgate Comedy Hour, using a format adapted from radio, embroiled the dashing duo in surprisingly long and involved comic sketches. As was the case with The Carol Burnett Show, this comedy could also include pathos and be very moving.

The five films in this set, unlike the first volume, are all in color and all but ""Living It Up"" are in widescreen format. They date from 1954- 1956, often considered the best years of television, and a unique time in the history of the movies. In general, color didn't make things more realistic, but lighter in tone. Movies didn't have to be good, they just had to have big stars, and be big, splashy productions. For that reason top billing on these films is given to ""VistaVision,"" Paramount's patented theatrical technique.

The only other thing that mattered was the director. For that reason it's often former cartoon director Frank Tashlin. Jerry easily pulls off gags likely first done by Bugs Bunny, but he's almost alone among live stars in that regard. The worst example is in Tashlin's The Glass Bottom Boat, where Doris Day is thrown pell mell into a futuristic kitchen gone wild, as has been done in countless cartoons, and makes it a thoroughly forgettable scene. Likewise, Paul Linde seems to get his drag scene in that film from a Bugs/ Daffy 'toon. Compare this film, with so many random slapstick schticks that Doris can't help be out of her element, with Move Over Darling, where she's entirely in it. Then again, the Norman Taurog directed Pardners in this set comes off extremely well because underlying the extemporaneous antics of Martin and Lewis is an strong story line enabling them to play off of any and all Hollywood wild-west stereotypes.

Arguably, one ought not probe too closely into films meant merely for fun, but watching these films now simply shows how much movies have changed. The main reason is that while these films were meant for the big screen and a Saturday afternoon laugh fest, escapist faire if you will, but packed to give the most bang for the buck, later movies, while launched in theaters, find most of their life on TV. For this reason, the fantasy element in films like Artists and Models seems merely unnerving, breaking what little there is of dramatic tension in the romance scenes. To a degree this is one with Shakespeare, who never let the audience forget, with a wink, that ""the play's the thing"" and for whom marriage was the sign of a happy ending. My main discovery in this visually dazzling and many- sided film was how well Shirley MacLaine could dance.

Film buffs will have endless comments on these films, and the eight films in volume one make it almost too full to review. That said, the packaging is somewhat puzzling, in that the films are presented in both volumes without extras or commentary. Why isn't there an insert booklet giving some background? At any rate, most of the Lewis and Martin/ Lewis films are at last on DVD, and for one kind of audience (including this reviewer), that's more than enough reason to rejoice.",1182902400,5,4557,4.747474747474747
2773830,5,B000NOK0MQ,"HOLLYWOOD OR BUST and (especially) ARTISTS AND MODELS are two of the greatest films of the 1950s.  The director of both, Frank Tashlin, was the Hitchcock of lowbrow social satire.  Both are at times visually and compositionally amazing.

The other three films are reasonable (at least LIVING IT UP), but Norman Taurog was pretty much a director-for-hire.

The tension between the two stars, for me at least, only makes these films more interesting, as it embodies the dissolution of post-classical Hollywood myth-making.",1182038400,,520,5.304878048780488

these films look fabulous!!  Many of them are VISTAVISION which was the absolute highest grade quality/size negative format from  the 50's era.

I'm  not going to deduct stars for what Isn't in this set...that's lame...this is 5 very well presented movies with many many laughs..some great songs  and loads of fun...for a bit over $20?  Geeez , how can you resist?

I can't  explain Martin & Lewis to you ...if you don't know  their work..start with volume  1 then this one..and don't avoid the Legendary Jerry set as its wonderful as well.  Kids out there? Think Adam Sandler invented that character of his?  watch Jerry...
