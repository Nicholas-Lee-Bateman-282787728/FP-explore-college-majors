8249768,4,B0013CADT2,"Adventurously mixing Sergio Leone Italian Westerns with Robert Rodriguez's Mexican view of the genre and spooning in a healthy dose of American gangster movies, Director/writer Shaky Gonzlez's ""Pistoleros"" is a shotgun blast of a flick. The life of the toughest gangster in Copenhagen, Frank Lowies, is being investigated by a pair of filmmakers, who meet with one of his old associates to get more background for their script in progress. Before they know it, they are downing beers with a number of Frank's past acquaintances, getting a story that gets wilder at each new turn of events.

It seems Frank has a day of reckoning when the jail sentences of cohorts involved in a train heist are running out, and they want to know where a missing bag of five million has been hidden for all these years. Frank's two sons, a female explosive expert, a Latino gunslinger, a pair of Pakistani thugs, Frank's sluggish brother, an Arabian arms merchant and a cast of con men from around the world converge on Copenhagen in a mad and violent search for Frank's missing money. And as the search and violence escalates, it's clear that this bounty will only make it into the hands of the last man standing. Yet does this cash exist, or is it the urban legend the two young filmmakers have heard it was? ""Pistoleros"" works this turf with excitement and humor, with gunfights and intrigue. It's a good old shoot'em up without the cactus plants, a gangster film without the Mafiosi. It's also a great deal of fun.",1235433600,2,1500,4.747126436781609
