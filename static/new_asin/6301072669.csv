308371,5,6301072669,"THE BODY IN THE LIBRARY is one of the best-known titles in Agatha Christie's series of novels starring Miss Jane Marple, who as a Christie sleuth is second in popularity only to Hercule Poirot.  The TV adaptation, made by the BBC in 1987, is indeed ""superbly staged.""  As it opens, the dead body of a flashily dressed platinum blonde girl is found lying in the library of the home of a Colonel and Mrs. Bantry, friends of Miss Marple's.  This unlikely circumstance sparks off a complex tale of greed, social climbing, and human weakness.  In puzzling the case out Miss Marple finds vital clues in two unlikely details:  the length of the murdered girl's fingernails and an aria from Mozart's THE MARRIAGE OF FIGARO.  (Those viewers familiar with the aria and its place in the opera may guess its relevance to the human drama here - though in the end it is shown to be relevant in a much more mundane way.)
Just as David Suchet ""is"" Poirot (in another BBC series) Joan Hickson ""is"" Miss Marple, her clear blue eyes suggesting the keen, insightful mind behind her abstracted manner.  Gwen Watford is wonderful, too, as Dolly Bantry, who struggles to maintain a brave front even as her husband is suspected of murder.  Other standouts in the big cast include Andrew Cuickshank as a wealthy invalid who planned to adopt the dead girl, Colin Higgins as a slightly retarded villager who stumbles upon a second body, and Anthony Smee as Basil Blake, the Colonel's free-spirited young enemy who turns out to be a man of character; David Horovitch, an actor who strikingly resembles Walter Matthau, steals every scene he is in as the maddeningly efficient Inspector Slack.  Such a first-rate cast and storyline make the unusually lengthy episode continually absorbing.",1153872000,3,1759,4.836666666666667

I watched this movie without reading the 1942 Dame Agatha Christie novel that it was based on.  (Christie wrote twelve Miss Marple murder mysteries altogether.)  I'm glad I did this!  Why?  Because it forced me to really watch the movie in order to try and deduce who the murderer was.

A maid discovers a body in the library of an estate called ""Gossington Hall.""  The wife of the owner of this estate calls Miss Marple (the late Joan Hickson) in to investigate unofficially.  Officially, the police are called in to investigate with Detective Melchett (Fred Jaeger) and Inspector Slack (David Horovitch) leading the investigation.  They find that the dead person is associated with the ""Majestic"" resort (a five star seaside hotel).  Another body is soon discovered in a place that seems to have nothing to do with the body found in the library.  Eventually an attempted murder occurs.

Miss Marple solves the case.  Her primary clues are fingernails and Mozart.

Who are the people associated with the estate and the seaside hotel?  They are as follows:

(1) Colonel Arthur Bantry, owner of the estate (Moray Watson)
(2) Mrs. Bantry, the colonel's wife (Gwen Watford)
(3) Conway ""Jeff"" Jefferson, a millionaire confined to a wheelchair (Andy Cruickshank)
(4) Adelaide ""Adel"" Jefferson, Conway's daughter-in-law (Ciaran Madden)
(5) Mark Gaskell, Conway's son-in-law (Keith Gaskell)
(6) Raymond Starr, a tennis instructor at the hotel (Jess Conrad)
(7) Josephine ""Josie"" Turner, hostess at the hotel (Trudie Styler)
(8) Ruby Keen, dance instructor at the hotel (Sally Jane Jackson)
(9) Basil Blake, a film maker (Tony Smee)
(10) Dinah Lee, Basil's girlfriend (Debbie Arnold)
(11) Pamela Reeve, a schoolgirl (Astra Sheridan)
(12) George Bartlett, Ruby's pupil (Arthur Bostrom)

Joan Hickson (whom Agatha Christie herself wanted to play Miss Marple) captures the essence of the heroine super sleuth in her performance. (Hickson was 78 years old in this movie!)

This murder mystery is especially good because it's not obvious who the murderer is.

Finally, the cinematography of this movie is good.  All costumes are authentic looking.  The background music adds to each scene.

In conclusion, this is a fun movie even if you have read the novel it's based on!!

7809273,5,6301072669,"Mrs. Dolly Bantry (Gwen Watford) tries to inform her husband of the reported body and is accused of imagining the report due to reading trashy books in bead at night. As usual, Jane is always in the right place to view the potential suspects. Clues are everywhere yet who would mix bodies and books?

Speaking about night, I would not start this film to late, as it seems to go on forever at 151 minutes. As it was a made for TV (1984), I suspect that this video is a composite of a series. In addition, there are places where it takes leaps to different situations with out any transition. You can guess the plot in general but the details are surprising. It is wrapped up so quickly that you will need to run the ending a few times to put it all in perspective",1502409600,,762,4.255172413793104

The question is - are the two connected. There are a number of suspects and the inspector investigating the case feels that Miss Marple is an annoying old lady with no real understanding of crimes. A lot of emphasis is made by others that she understands crimes better than anyone else and that she evaluates crimes by comparing what she sees with what she saw in her home town. There are many red herrings and it is unlikely that a viewer of the film will be able to figure out what has been going on, but this does not detract from the enjoyment of the film.",1449014400,,708,4.213235294117647
