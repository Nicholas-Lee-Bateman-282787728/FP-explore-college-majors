2652770,4,B000I2KQNQ,"Marc (an unsettling, often whacked-out performance by Vincent Lindon) and his wife Agnes (quietly sane but maybe conniving, maybe not Emmanuelle Devos) are getting ready for an evening out with Agnes' ex-husband Serge (Mathieu Amalric) and his new wife. As a joke Marc shaves off his moustache while bathing and of course, naturally expects Agnes, Serge and the next day his fellow workers and the man at the Espresso stand to notice. But no one does. In fact, Agnes tells him he never had a moustache though Marc finds photos from a trip to Bali with Agnes...moustache squarely on his upper lip. The photos disappear before Marc can show them to Agnes and when he asks her about them, she has no recollection of a trip to Bali. And so it goes.
Director Emmanuel Carrere, who also wrote the screenplay based upon his novel has fashioned an enigmatic though thoroughly fascinating film: What is Really Going On Here? ""La Moustache"" never really answers that question: nothing is spelled out, made crystal clear. Is it about the complacency that sets in between partners after a few years: a complacency in which they fail to notice any kind of small change in or on each other? Maybe.
Directed and written by men, ""La Moustache"" has a lot to do with Men's hatred of the drudgery of shaving daily...Marc quits shaving for an extended period of time and never appears happier. It's not surprising that the Men's Fashion Industry pushes the unshaven look as a desirable, virile, macho look: we are all open to anything that saves us from shaving daily.
At times perplexing, confusing, witty yet always intelligent, ""La Moustache"" never fails to hold your interest...though you will be hard pressed to say what it all means. And maybe that is the point.",1186185600,,1748,4.810631229235881
2652771,3,B000I2KQNQ,"The cover of this DVD misleads when it likens its drama to Hitchcock's work. There is actually nothing approaching a Hitchcock level of suspense here. However, the viewer is kept intellectually guessing, ping-ponging back and forth at least through the first part of the film, wondering,  ""Did the man have a moustache, or didn't he? Is he gaslighting his wife, or is she gaslighting him?""

Like the French language itself, there are so many letters of explanation in this film that don't get pronounced, but that inform the pronunciation of other letters in the words. Director Emmanuel Carrere refers to ""ghosts"" whose presence is felt, trailing the characters' lives. However again, none of this rises to the level of suspense.

Most of the value of this movie lies in its view of a marriage. This is an adult relationship, different from the kind we see in most American films where one spouse (usually the woman) is shown as mere adjunct to the man's answering call to action. Here both partners are given gravity and tenderness and extension.

Actor Vincent Lindon is especially good at showing a longing bafflement. He doesn't undermine his performance by distancing himself from his character as many Americans might when called upon to play a man who isn't conforming to all gender stereotypes. Here Lindon is unflinching as a man who is not interested in football and who gets lost, almost waif-like, in what might be the complexities of his own imagining.

There's a good director/producer commentary on this DVD, pointing out the ground from which some of the film's mists arise. But this isn't the movie for anyone who demands clear plot or resolution. In fact, the film is almost gratuitously devoid of explanations. But you might feel invited to fill in the tantalizing blanks yourself, to suit your own view.",1182038400,10,1824,4.947712418300654

2652773,4,B000I2KQNQ,"LA MOUSTACHE is a very well acted and conceived Belgian film that starts with a terrific premise that could be the opening for either a comedy or a drama and ends up wondering which path to take.  Writer/director Emmanuel Carrre (with co-script writer Jrme Beaujour) takes us on a mind trip that becomes increasingly disorienting and frustrating as the film progresses.  It challenges the audience to think but then there is no payoff for the effort.

Marc (Vincent Lindon) is a handsome middle aged man married to Agns (Emmanuelle Devos) for fifteen years and one morning, in what in retrospect is in response to a bit of relationship ennui, decides to shave off his moustache which has always been present since his marriage began. The surprise to Marc is that Agns doesn't even notice. At work Marc quietly shows up and no one notices, not even his close associate Bruno (Hippolyte Girardot).  Marc is at first perplexed, then he confronts his wife and fellow workers with the fact that he just shaved off his moustache and no one believes that he ever had one!  Marc begins to search for photos showing his previous face and gradually the photos disappear and his wife denies ever seeing them, ever traveling to Bali where the photos were taken, etc.  People begin to wonder about Marc's sanity and his wife suggests he seek psychiatric care.  It is at this point that Marc enters a fugue state and ultimately disappears to Hong Kong on a never ending quest for discovering the truth about who he really is, whether he actually exists, whether he is the pawn in a cosmic game....it just gets more ludicrous.

Both Vincent Lindon and Emmanuelle Devos are superb in these peculiar roles and the film has solid production values. Perhaps it is the director's point to leave the audience in a confused state, one that calls forth the existential questions, but as a film it merely peters out, leaving the viewer a bit frustrated by the lack of substance.

2652774,4,B000I2KQNQ,"Come see the famous dissapearing moustache act! But seriously, this is one of the most unique plots for a film i have ever seen.. It is a psychological puzzle that keeps you uncertain throughout the entire movie.. what is real? what is imagined? how did i get here? it takes a rather silly yet rather profound thinker to come up with these questions.. la moustache is a great attempt to pull us off the balance beam we tread so precariously on..",1173225600,2,445,4.506172839506172
2652775,5,B000I2KQNQ,"What an inspired plot.  Shave your moustache and no one notices. Great premise, but can you hold the pieces together?
Of course the humor gets heavy when the only one laughing is the guy who is the naked (moustache of many years shaved). Soon he has to solve the un....solvable?
This is where the ""6th Sense"" scenerio comes in. This is why it is worth watching.
Unfortunately it counts on an audience that has an IQ above Einstein.
So when first watching this film....Those that are high IQ need not read further.

So what you have to do is say to yourself: is it his wife who is crazy?

This will at least get you past GO!

2652776,3,B000I2KQNQ,"The premise is so simple that it is hard not to find it attractive. A man shaves off his mustache only to find that nobody in his life believes that he ever had one. He goes through the natural paces; thinks it is a joke, thinks it is a conspiracy, thinks the whole world has gone mad. Director Emmanuel Carrere makes an interesting choice early on by showing us the shaving of the mustache so that throughout we side with Marc (Vincent Lindon) and think that he is the normal one. I assume that he did that so we would surrender to the Marc vs. The World storyline that he was going with. At its core I feel as though Carrere is trying to say something about the nature of relationships, about how the smallest things can collapse a seemingly happy love affair. Marc and his wife Agnes (Emmanuelle Devos) seem to have a perfectly nice thing going, but subtract the mustache from the equation and suddenly the entire house of cards come crashing down. And most importantly it is a good time, so even though Carrere plays dirty pool along the way and even though the plot becomes a jumbled mess at the end I still recommend you to go check out this film.

The thrust of the story is a variation on the Wrong Man device. It doesn't take place in our logic based world. By shaving his mustache he sets himself back, time wise or otherwise, to a place where his dad is still alive and he has yet to quit smoking. Plus everybody in his life refuses to admit that he had a mustache that we the viewer clearly saw and the conspiracy is far too wide to have been man made. So he needs to prove to the world that he did have facial hair just as Richard Ian Blaney needed to prove that he wasn't the necktie murderer in ""Frenzy."" Lindon's performance also helps things along as not only does he look like the quintessential straight man but also nails the role and all of its nuances.

In a very messed up third act Marc decides to head for the Far East (Hong Kong to be specific). We are never given a concrete reason, but given the fact that he is a stranger in his own life it is at least understandable. He becomes some sort of freak who spends his days riding around on a commuter boat. During all this my thumb kept tilting more and more downward but I could never come to the point of not liking this film. Then, in the style of David Lynch, his wife just shows up in his hotel room with no explanation given. The amount of sense being made spirals south until the end when he shaves off his mustache again and this time his wife notices. All of this backs up my theory that the theme is how little things can expose a greater rot in a relationship. I am a film viewer who will always take logic over illogic, but this is one of those rare films that left a smile on my face despite my state of perplexion. The first two thirds are considerably better than the last which looked like filler dressed up as high art. ""La Moustache"" felt quite polished for a French film and perhaps that is why it got such a lengthy run here in America. So unless you are scared off by subtitles or a little bit of confusion there really is no reason why you should not check this one out. ***1/4",1171065600,6,3174,4.235973597359736

Up to the end, I loved this funny (at first) and finally disturbing French film that slyly forces you to shift the paradigm you think you're in.

How fragile our shimmering realities if some little thing fractures our bubble.

How ephemeral our identities that are held together by nothing more than fleeting reflections of self.

If you're fond of French films like Cach and Lemming, this one is a tasty treat up to a point.

But be warned that no matter how glued you might be to the unfolding Hitchcockian twists, the final ending is a HUGE, FRUSTRATING DISAPPOINTMENT.  In fact, it made me angry to be so unsatisfied.  There's such a thing too much trimming and editing to achieve some kind of minimalist existential French ambiance.

Your average American viewer will probably not like this film for the following reasons, though: It's subtitled, it makes you think, and there is very little dialogue. However, I feel that these aspects pull together to make something far more compelling than anything I've seen Hollywood produce since Inception (and even that was still very Hollywood-esque.) I'm only giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because the ending of the film leaves far too many questions unanswered, and inexplicably brings back a character without any rhyme or reason which obviously confused even the main character.

2652800,3,B000I2KQNQ,"I was immediately sucked in to this after watching the trailer..why does no one notice his moustache is gone! It's driving me crazy! My initial reaction was that it left a bad taste in my mouth. It was entirely intentional of course. American cinema tends to wrap it all up in a neat little bow for you lest you interpret meaning on your own. Of course, this does not mean that this film was by any means the best of it's genre. The only thing that remains consistent is we're all left with questions after. I love reading the different interpretations of this film after watching it and was a bit surprised that no one went for the seemingly easiest explanation...though any interpretation is most likely over analyzed and leaves us just as crazy as the main character.
I viewed this as the window in to a madman's mind. Much like the Machinist or Shutter Island, but less cut and dry. Something has traumatized him - the death of his father, perhaps? Loss of connection with his mother..maybe even a failed marriage? Afterwards, I saw the moustache only as the key to his madness. I felt that Marc was experiencing a false reality. As with any movie from the perspective of the delusional we are not sure what we are seeing is real or imagined. Personally, I think the scene where his wife takes him shopping 'as wives do' and maybe even their dinner together was not actually happening (shades of 'the sixth sense' dinner scene..why did she not eat a single bite of food? If you look at the 'goofs' in IMDB you'll notice they overfilled Agnes' glass after she took a sip in this scene. My idea being that they wanted it to look as if she'd taken a drink without losing any volume from the glass, but overcompensated) When he does leave Paris for Hong Kong he travels back and forth seemingly endlessly on the ferry. He writes his love a post card from one hotel showing her where he is, which he never sends. And yet, she appears in the next hotel that he checks in to. She would have no idea he was staying there, let alone in Hong Kong...and knows nothing of the jacket that she had bought with him only a few scenes earlier. In the end, I felt this was a film about a man who has begun his decent in to madness punctuated by moments of clarity and maybe even a few flashbacks to happier times. He has created an ideal life in his mind so well that even the figments of his imagination don't notice when he's had a shave.",1369180800,2,2426,4.3933333333333335
2652801,3,B000I2KQNQ,"This movie is somewhat enigmatic but I would like to offer an interpretation.

It is a simple fable, an implausible story told fancifully to illustrate a specific point.  Like a poem or song, more lyrical than literal and does not need to make sense in the traditional linear story-telling sort of way.

The fable is of a married couple that is ostensibly in love, or at least in a pleasant committed relationship.  Until one of them decides to change things.

When the man shaves without consulting his wife, she simply cannot acknowledge the action.  The more he asserts this independent move, the less connected he is with his present life as well as his past life.  So much so that he ends up in a foreign land as a stranger without community.

When, at the end, he finally accepts the small realities that his wife (and community) expects of him then he has his marriage and life back.

The movie simply states that relationships are an interaction between who we are and what is expected of us.  We cannot be entirely our uncompromised selves or we are left without community.  Whether it is with a lover, friend or coworker, people must agree what they will accept as the reality about themselves within the relationship or the relationship will not work.

Sanity and love lie in the acceptance of those many small compromises between our ego and the other to achieve the connections we need.  That is assuming these compromises are ones that you are willing to accept.  Marc explicitly understood those compromises and, thus enlightened, he still made the willing choice to accept being a little bit of what his wife needed him to be.

Agnes, towards the end, also offers Marc the opportunity to determine if their new friends will remain their friends back in Paris.  This throw-away line represents another opportunity for a negotiated shared reality rather than a unilateral imposition.  Except that Agnes is now offering to make the compromises required to stay in communion with Marc on his terms (at least regarding the friends).

That said, the movie was wonderful in its narration and delivery, but needed to be shorter by a half hour.  Honestly, many scenes can be viewed in fast forward without missing much.

By the way, I have seen other interpretations of the ending including the following from wikipedia:

- Alternative 1: His wife, Agnes, is a borderline personality that must control everything about Marc (character traits not evident earlier in the film).  This seems like someone imposing a way too literal ending to the movie.  Marc would be an idiot for never seeing these traits in his wife before and reacting so bizarrely.  It reduces the whimsical nature of the film to a psychotic episode without meaning or purpose. Besides, if we were to get so literal then why would people other than Agnes tell Marc he never had a moustache?

- Alternative 2: The final scene harkens to the vacation pictures earlier in the movie and the shaved moustache is a fresh start and an opportunity to relive his marriage from the start on new terms.  Except the terms aren't new, the second shaving is a negotiated presentation of the husband rather than a unilateral move by Marc. Also, thematically, Marc never looked for a new beginning at any point prior in the film.  Instead, Marc had been looking for a shared interpretation of their current reality throughout the movie.

-  Alternative 3: The final scene was meant to be an idealised dream of what Marc wished had happened.  This makes no sense as then we must question if any of the movie was real or an idealized representation by Marc.  Since the whole thing is a surreal Kafka-esque exploration, the question is really rendered moot just by the genre.  As with the man-into-insect transformation of Kafka's ""metamorphasis"" or the interzone in Cronenberg's ""naked lunch"", we are just to take events at face value: man shaves moustache and his world crumbles until he regrows it and shaves it in a way that is mutually acknowledged by his spouse.  There is no need to figure out if and when it became fantasy as the whole premise is absurd to begin with.",1342396800,3,4131,4.781382228490832
2652802,5,B000I2KQNQ,"Great film, amazing score. the plot line is cool and disturbing. The acting, especially from the main guy is so real and candid...

Great job!",1317600000,,142,4.68
2652803,3,B000I2KQNQ,"Watching this mindbender, I got two possible messages from it.  The first is about unconditional love.  Loving someone feels wonderful and warm...but also insecure because of the trust required.  Towards the end, Marc makes an important decision to leave evidence behind.  By doing so, was he making a decision to love Agnes anyway, despite his doubts?  But then, doubts never go completely away because can you ever really know someone?

Or was this really about codependency? In one scene, he writes to Agnes, ""Without your eyes, I see nothing.""  And so, maybe this is really about a person who stays in an unhealthy relationship because he feels like nothing without it.

It was hard what to make of the characters.  Was Marc crazy?  Was his wife crazy, as well as sadistic?  Were all his friends in on some sadistic joke, too?  The storyline was hard to follow, too, because it was hard to tell if this story was in chronological order, moving backwards, or in circles.

2652804,2,B000I2KQNQ,This film is like two films in one. The first half of the movie (in France) is wonderfully taut and suspenseful. We wonder about the motives of the characters. The second half (in Macau) is filmed like an amateurish indy film. The ending is a frustrating exercise in disappointment and need to be explained away only by watching the interview with the director (on the DVD). I borrowed the book to compare the endings and think the book ties up the loose ends better. All in all a rather frustrating and meaningless movie after the suspense in the beginning.,1286064000,4,558,4.646464646464646
2652805,4,B000I2KQNQ,"La Moustache is an excellent film despite the fact that a lot of the story is open to interpretation--some of what we see is apparently fantasy and some is apparently reality; and the action is primarily seen through the eyes of Marc, a Frenchman living in Paris. This lack of clarity between fantasy and reality was somewhat frustrating; I admit it; but the film as a whole still works well--this will haunt me for quite some while to come. The acting was very convincing and the script was well written; I also think the choreography and the cinematography enhance the film even more. I also liked the musical score.

When the movie begins, we meet Marc Thiriez (Vincent Lindon) and his wife Agns (Emmanuelle Devos) who have a happy marriage in Paris where Marc works at an agency that designs properties. One day on a whim, Marc asks Agnes if he should shave off his moustache; and Agnes replies that she ""wouldn't know (him) without it."" Marc shaves it off--and then his world begins to turn upside down very quickly.

For one thing, Agns doesn't even notice that Marc's moustache is even missing--indeed, she insists that he never had one! Their friends and Marc's coworkers, including Bruno (Hippolyte Girardot), Serge (Mathieu Amalric) Samira (Cylia Malki) and Nadia (Macha Polikarpova) don't notice and join Agns in claiming that Marc never had a moustache, either! Slowly Marc begins to wonder if he's going insane--or are they playing a very cruel trick on him that needs to stop right away?

The film has many other scenes that can be viewed as either reality or fantasy. Marc forgets the exact street address of his parents which is also the house in Paris where he grew up; and suddenly when Marc overhears that he will be committed to a psychiatric hospital Marc goes to extremes to avoid that as he runs away frantically. Where he goes and what happens next is all very interesting and again it is all open to interpretation.

There's much, much more to the plot than this--it may seem as if I've given too much away but I assure you that I haven't. Look also for a good albeit performance by Hei Poon Yuen as a hotel manager.

The DVD comes with a featurette that explores the making of the film and there is an optional running director/producer commentary as well.

La Moustache is very creative although the story doesn't always make sense.

2652806,4,B000I2KQNQ,"La Moustache is an excellent film despite the fact that a lot of the story is open to interpretation--some of what we see is apparently fantasy and some is apparently reality; and the action is primarily seen through the eyes of Marc, a Frenchman living in Paris. This lack of clarity between fantasy and reality was somewhat frustrating; I admit it; but the film as a whole still works well--this will haunt me for quite some while to come. The acting was very convincing and the script was well written; I also think the choreography and the cinematography enhance the film even more. I also liked the musical score.

When the movie begins, we meet Marc Thiriez (Vincent Lindon) and his wife Agns (Emmanuelle Devos) who have a happy marriage in Paris where Marc works at an agency that designs properties. One day on a whim, Marc asks Agnes if he should shave off his moustache; and Agnes replies that she ""wouldn't know (him) without it."" Marc shaves it off--and then his world begins to turn upside down very quickly.

For one thing, Agns doesn't even notice that Marc's moustache is even missing--indeed, she insists that he never had one! Their friends and Marc's coworkers, including Bruno (Hippolyte Girardot), Serge (Mathieu Amalric) Samira (Cylia Malki) and Nadia (Macha Polikarpova) don't notice and join Agns in claiming that Marc never had a moustache, either! Slowly Marc begins to wonder if he's going insane--or are they playing a very cruel trick on him that needs to stop right away?

The film has many other scenes that can be viewed as either reality or fantasy. Marc forgets the exact street address of his parents which is also the house in Paris where he grew up; and suddenly when Marc overhears that he will be committed to a psychiatric hospital Marc goes to extremes to avoid that as he runs away frantically. Where he goes and what happens next is all very interesting and again it is all open to interpretation.

There's much, much more to the plot than this--it may seem as if I've given too much away but I assure you that I haven't. Look also for a good albeit performance by Hei Poon Yuen as a hotel manager.

The DVD comes with a featurette that explores the making of the film and there is an optional running director/producer commentary as well.

La Moustache is very creative although the story doesn't always make sense. This type of art is open to individual interpretation and hence there have been many different interpretations of the meaning of the plot and its twists.

2652807,5,B000I2KQNQ,"This movie is a parable about how awesome moustaches are. This man, like all manly men, has a sweet 'stache. In his staggering hubris, though, he shaves it and, like a modern Samson, immediately loses all of his power and goes completely mad. The rest of the movie is him searching Hong Kong for Mr. Baseball, Tom Selleck, to beg forgiveness.

Before he leaves on his sojourn his girlfriend, who is of course hot but understandably disagreeable after he shaves, takes him to a department store and buys him a ridiculous green jacket. This is a subtle allegory about the real reason the Mayans disappeared, which was their disavowal of moustaches (rightly an unpardonable crime).

I myself have a moustache and it's the greatest thing that's ever happened to anyone, ever. The only bad part is that now, when I wake up every afternoon, I wind up late to everything. Pre-stache I'd just roll out of bed, make a hot pocket, maybe change clothes, high-five a baby and be on my way. Now, however, I cannot even tear myself away from the mirror. I just stand there, staring at my stache, like some moustachioed Narcissastache.

Oh vanity, thy name is moustache!

Still not convinced? A quick anecdote: my girlfriend wanted to get pregnant so I shaved the ""macaroni"" above my cockadoodledoo; the next day she was carrying sextuplets. I was wondering how we were going to afford it when my moustache came in in the morning and threw a few grand on the floor. Allegedly he'd been leaving my lip to work the graveyard shift at Chachi's while me and the misses slept. He even brings home day old bagels whenever he can, the lug.

Anyway some wayward reviewers claim that the movies ending is ambiguous, open ended, open to interruptation, etc. This is absurd, and it is clear these people have never had a moustache and may be dangerously conservative. The whole point of the movie, and the end, are blatant warnings of those who have the flava-sava to never shave it off, lest their lives become pathetic and inadequate, and those who never have grown a moustache to step back and reevaluate their lives before it is too late.

It is almost Halloween, and I am doing my part by buying 10-grosses of fake moustaches and handing them out in lieu of candy. Gogol and Kafka would be proud, except they are both dead.",1256515200,4,2302,4.657635467980295

2652809,4,B000I2KQNQ,"""La Moustache"" is a trippy French flick by director Emmanuel Carrere, which he adapted from his novel of the same name.  The film opens with Marc, a middle-aged Parisian, bathing and playfully asking his wife whether he should shave off his mustache.  They joke that she wouldn't be able to recognize him, as he's had a mustache his entire adult life.  Marc goes along with the joke and impulsively shaves; however, instead of being shocked, his wife doesn't notice.  He assumes that she's playing a joke, but she apparently isn't.  Things become stranger still when his friends and co-workers fail to notice the demise of the titular mustache as well.

Only a French film could sustain this rather silly premise for nearly 90 minutes, although the mustache is merely the trigger for what follows.  The film's initial light comedic banter slowly changes to a tense, brooding tone as Marc starts to act erratically - all stemming from the mustache incident.  I was amused and intrigued throughout the film, although some viewers undoubtedly will find ""La Moustache"" boring depending on their tolerance level for semi-pretentious French films.  One could interpret the plot in a number of ways.  Marc might have gone mad, or the film might be an examination of how two people can never really know each other or about the disparity between how we view ourselves and how others views us.  At the end, I had no idea what the film was ""about"" or what the film ""meant,"" but I was entertained enough not to care.",1249776000,6,1505,4.817120622568093
2652810,3,B000I2KQNQ,"At the beginning of this movie, we see a man shave his mustache. But when he emerges from the bathroom, his wife doesn't seem to notice. Nor do his co-workers or friends. He never had a mustache, they say. The man starts to go crazy. Parts of his life seem to be disappearing. He's caught in an alternative reality -- a different version of himself. He questions everything. Finally, when he overhears his wife talking about having him committed, he runs away -- to Hong Kong.
For long stretches of this movie, I was quite riveted It seemed to owe something to Kafka. Without anything scary happening, a mood of unease, even menace builds. The idea that the basic building blocks of a person's life can be so easily undermined is disturbing. The movie seemed to have something important to say. But the plot loses its way in the Hong Kong scenes and the end is a way too facile. Ultimately, we get no explanation of how and why -- everything is rather too easily resolved.

When he confronts her about it she claims he never had a mustache. His first instinct is to assume that everybody is ganging up to play a joke on him, but soon he begins to doubt his own sanity.

The premise of this movie is very original and intriguing. It would've made a great Twilight Zone episode. Unfortunately the whole thing soon turns into a mess. The writing is sloppy. The interactions between the characters are confusing at best, bordering on the nonsensical. At worst the whole thing feels smug and pretentious. The few scenes where Marc and his wife bother to talk to each other like normal people are so loaded with psycho-babble that even Dr Phil would beg them to shut up.

This would've made a great short film. The first 15 minutes were OK but as the movie went on I just wished it was over. The ending is as unsatisfying as it gets. I was left with the impression that writer and director Emmanuel Carrre was trying to demonstrate how much smarter than the rest of us he is.

2652816,5,B000I2KQNQ,"This is an absolutely incredible film.  Just wonderful.

I read the book a couple of years ago and recently re-read it.  As I looked it up, I found a film had been made-- I didn't know about it-- so I immediately purchased a copy.

If you haven't read the book, you must. And, this time, reading the book first is probably a good choice.

I'm baffled that some seem to think the ending was unclear. I think it was very clear. However, I don't want to include any spoilers here.  It's exactly as it seems to be.  Exactly. So, if you're confused and looking for a hidden meaning, you won't find one. It's exactly as the main character understands it to be at the very end.

The movie starts out with Marc asking his wife, Agnes, if he should shave his mustache.  He does, and she doesn't notice. As a matter of fact, nobody notices.  When he confronts his wife and friends, they insist that he has not had a mustache for at least 15 years.  Obviously, somebody is either lying or going crazy.  He is suspicious of his wife and friends for quite a while, but then begins to believe that they are indeed telling the truth, and he is somewhat removed from reality.  Again, however, he starts distrusting his wife, since strangers recognize his mustache in older pictures.

Who is telling the truth? Who is insane? The film begins with us clearly seeing Marc's mustache.  We also clearly see the hairs he trims, the hairs he washes away in the tub, and the hairs he washes away in his shaving tray. We watch him complete his entire shaving ritual-- first using shaving scissors, then an old-fashioned razor.  We see everything through Marc's eyes.  We meet his Serge and his wife. We hear Agnes talk about going to Marc's parents for lunch.  What is real and what isn't?

Both Vincent Lindon and Emmanuelle Devos do a perfect job here. There isn't constant chatter or dialogue and nuances are delivered through subtle expression.  They are both so wonderful-- Lindon in particular.

This movie is not about middle aged angst and it's not about a marriage falling apart nor is it about a man entering a 15 year time warp. It also is not a comedy by any stretch of the imagination-- although, like life, there might be some time you find yourself laughing a bit-- but it's due to the absurdity of the situation and the empathy the characters inspire.

The music is gorgeous and the cinematography beautiful.  This is very much recommended.

Note: The ending here is different from the book.  The book's ending is a stunner. When I was finished, I just sat there wide-eyed-- not believing what I just finished reading.  I re-read the last few pages because it was so unbelievably shocking.

That ending definitely wouldn't have worked here. At the end of the film, I was almost praying I wouldn't have to see what I read in the book. It might have worked visually, but I doubted that it would. Carrere made the right choice here when deciding to change the ending.  Again, if you read the book, you wouldn't wonder at all who was right all along or if one of the characters were truly crazy.  There is no ambiguity in the book.  However, there's no ambiguity here, either.  It just hits you with a half a ton of bricks rather than a full ton.  And, that's not criticism-- a half ton still knocks you over. Just make sure you realize that the main character understands the truth at the end, and you will understand, too.",1199836800,27,3411,4.522875816993464
2652817,4,B000I2KQNQ,"I must say that my first and immediate reaction to this film was wtf? Is this film about existential crisis? Parallel universe? Midlife crisis?  Nervous breakdown? Is it a dream? It's hard to say. While I love things just enigmatic enough to be forced to think, I don't want to have to need Cliff Notes or have to watch the director's explanation in the extras section to understand what's going on in the end. As it turns out, the director did say that scenes that actually would have given the viewer even the slightest clue as to what is really happening were deleted. Huh? While this film is touted as a Hitchcock-esque mystery, I'm thinking more like Kafka. It had a certain surrealist quality about it that leaves you asking... a lot.

Marc (Vincent Lindon) shaves his moustache, which he's had the whole 15 years he and his wife (Emmanuelle Devos) have been together. His wife, friends, and work colleagues don't mention that the moustache is gone and this upsets Marc. This is when the mystery starts. He starts to point it out and everyone thinks he's crazy saying he's never had a moustache. He then tries to find proof that he did have one, getting out pics of a trip with his wife, and asking a stranger to look at and older pic to confirm his rightness. While the stranger confirms the moustache, the wife denies any trip even happened. At this point, even though both he and his wife start to feel that he needs psychiatric help, he still feels that he is not off, but that maybe his wife is.

As the film progresses, past and current reality starts blurring and becoming distorted and we see that his perception of reality keeps changing, and that both realities are happening at the same time. When things come to a head and he hears his wife and friend talking about committing him, he escapes to Hong Kong to find himself by--- taking the ferries back and forth all day? I guess that's a metaphor for the switching back and forth between realities? Whatever.

This film is absolutely worth watching though for the brilliant performances of both Lindon and Devos. Lindon gives truly a haunting performance as the lost, confused, and angst riddled Marc. And Devos does the loving wife watching the descent of her husband into craziness perfectly. She has a quirky off beat way about her that fits with the ambience of this movie completely. Moreover, this film did keep me very intrigued and glued to the story until the end as I was wondering what's really going on. It does resemble Hitchcock somewhat in that we are wondering at some point if it's him going crazy or if he is being driven crazy by those around him. However, unlike Hitchcock, things aren't as clear cut in the end.",1192406400,3,2700,4.607068607068607

8143700,5,B000I2KQNQ,"I keep returning to this under-the radar film, which I find to be soothing during troubled times, since it's so good on several levels.  It's the mystery of the entire story as it unfolds, as well as the protagonist / antagonist Marc (Vincent Lindon) that continue to draw me back into the world of ""La Moustache"".  What is actually happening to Marc in this film?  Is he suffering from hallucinations, mental illness, burnout -- Or all of the aforementioned?  What exactly has precipitated his downward spiral?  The soullessness of Western corporate culture?  The stultifying monotony of his seemingly glamorous life?  Perhaps life in Paris, at least in the way that Marc lives it, or imagines it -- Is not fulfilling enough for him to remain stable.  Thus he takes off spontaneously, presumably to escape ""the straitjacket"".  Once in Hong Kong, inexplicably he decides to just blend in, to be invisible as he travels back and forth on the ferries.  Marc's ""escape"", albeit to evade being taken to the psych ward, redefines the term ""liberation"".  The only way he can experience freedom is to sneak out on the sly.  It remains an open question as to whether Marc's moustache truly exists; the moustache, as metaphor, ultimately representing Marc's struggle with feeling unseen.  The director, Emmanuel Carrre, makes use of a surrealistic ambiance in this film; one can never be too sure about the difference between Marc's perception of reality -- And reality itself.  Finally, the score by Philip Glass is outstanding, memorable and superbly integrated into the film by the director.
