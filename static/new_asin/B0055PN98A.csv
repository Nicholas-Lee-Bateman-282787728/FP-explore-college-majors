8458546,5,B0055PN98A,"Love this DVD!  It is so creative and taught by the most enthusiastic PE teacher that keeps the students engaged in an exercise journey.  As the teacher tells a ""story""  he has the students do exercises ""hold in the plank position so you don't touch the hot lava""  or the students do crunches as they sit in their ""space ships""  and go ""hyper speed and slow down"".  Great for grades K-3rd",1470355200,,388,4.394366197183099
