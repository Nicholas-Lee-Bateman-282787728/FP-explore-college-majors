8290883,5,B001D11A68,There aren't enough adjectives to describe Mara Felix.  She was very talented and had tremendous sex appeal.  I absolutely love to watch her movies over and over.  There are six movies in the pack and the only one that I have watched only once was Juana Gallo and I think it is because it is in color and I prefer black and white.,1368057600,,330,4.2063492063492065

8290885,3,B001D11A68,"Maria Felix, was a great star for decades.  ""Discovered"" while on a break from her secretarial job in the early forties; she then went  on to become one of Mexico's most enduring stars of the cinema.  She was the original Mexican Diva whose admirers elevated her to goddess status.  She was admired and loved by many, and married four men.  One of them Agustin Lara (Mexican writer of many, many songs including ""Granada"" wrote the song 'Maria Bonita') for her, while on their honeymoon in Acapulco.  While there may be many Marias who are bonitas, in Mexico, Maria Felix is the only ""Maria Bonita"".

The movies' video is good.  The sound on some of them could have been cleaned up. The compilers did a somewhat indifferent packaging job. The collection is a good deal however.

If you want to show off Mexico's Golden Age of Cinema, '1940's & 1950's, this is a good starting point. There is some film noir, some character studies and some semi-historical story tellling.

And probably most important Maria  Felix was a precursor of the feminist impulse. She was strong, independent and beautiful to boot.",1357862400,8,1105,4.7936507936507935
