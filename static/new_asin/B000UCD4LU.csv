8212857,4,B000UCD4LU,"TNA Bound For Glory October 22, 2006 Compuware Arena Plymouth, Michigan

This is the 2nd annual Bound For Glory which happens to be TNA's biggest show of the year. This is the first time they held a monthly pay per view outside of the impact zone in Orlando, Florida.

Kevin Nash Open Invitational X Division Gauntlet Battle
There are 16 competitors in this match which is basically a battle royal, this was a great way to start off the biggest pay per view of the year. Kevin Nash was very entertaining commentating alongside Mike Tenay and Don West, the high flyers of the X Division kept this match exciting. Rating 4/5

Four-Corners Tag Team Match
Team 3D Vs. AMW Vs. The James Gang Vs. The Naturals
This was a solid tag match but it was cut a tad short considering the amount of wrestlers involved. Although I will say that I am amazed at how B.G. James is still so very entertaining. Rating 3.5/5

Monster's Ball Match
Abyss Vs. Samoa Joe Vs. Brother Runt Vs. Raven W/ Jake Roberts as referee
This was a good hardcore match, Abyss threw Runt into the crowd and they caught him. Joe took a pretty good fall off the ramp and Runt took one off the scaffolding uptop the entrance ramp then Abyss jumped onto him. Abyss gets his face smashed onto his own tacks and of course Jake gets involved in the action as well. very entertaining match. Rating 4.5/5

Loser Gets Fired Match
""E.Y."" Eric Young Vs. Larry Zbyszko
This wasn't a very long wrestling match, it was more like a segment and a pretty good one at that because you can always count on Eric Young to be entertaining at the very least. Rating 3.5/5

X Division Championship Match
Chris Sabin Vs. Senshi (C)
This was a pretty typical Sabin-Senshi match with a lot of kicks going back and forth. There were also good high-impact moves and of course what would a X Division match be with out those good spots. This was a good match. Rating 4.5/5

8 Mile Street Fight
Christian Cage Vs. Rhino
This was a good hardcore match I kind of wish these 2 wrestlers would've been added into the Monster's Ball match. This match actually started outside, I guess cause it's a street fight, Rhino slams christian on top of a zamboni and drives it into the arena. They take the match into the crowd and at one point Rhino is put into a straight jacket. Rating 5/5

6 Sides Of Steel For The NWA Tag Team Championship
LAX Vs. AJ Styles & Christopher Daniels
This match should be remembered for two things a great tag team match and a great steel cage match. AJ Styles is nuts he jumps onto Hernandez from the top of the cage and Hernandez even attempts to return the favor. What can I say this match had me chanting TNA TNA TNA along with the crowd. These four men worked well together and they should be proud of themselves for putting on these kinds of matches. Rating 5/5

NWA World Heavyweight Championship Match
Sting Vs. Jeff Jarrett W/ Kurt Angle as the Special Enforcer
This was a good solid main event for the world title and for TNA's biggest show of the year. Both men put on a good show and this is one of the better Jeff Jarrett wrestling matches that I have had the opportunity to see in TNA. Rating 5/5

Well I gave this dvd an overall 4 stars the event is very strong with a couple of average matches mixed in but if you are a fan of professional wrestling then this is for you. I totally recommend purchasing this dvd.",1201651200,,3376,4.3872
8212858,3,B000UCD4LU,"It was around this time in TNA that the new booking team that was set into place in late September really changed the product into more of the ""sports entertainment"" enviroment instead of the pure ""professional wrestling"" product they had since their move to Flordia.  It was heavily showcased on this PPV as you had more talk stuff that should have been saved for Impact than PPV.

Preshow: Lance Hoyt & Ron Killings vs. Serotonin - Nothing special here as it was the typical ""warm up the crowd"" match between all five...which is a shame since you know The Truth & Lance Hoyt are capable of so much more.

Senshi vs. Austin Star vs. Alex Shelley vs. Jay Lethal vs. Sonjay Dutt - The main point of this match was to put over the fued between Shelley & Star over being Nash's ""teacher's pet"" which came off well at the end here along with their ""blind"" tags during the match and each having a hand in each other's eliminations.  The match itself was your typical X division multiman match which delivers every time.  Nash's commentary is also funny at times.

Bikini Contest: Eric Young vs. Ms. Brooks - First of all, normally I don't comment on these things but watch their highlight package before the match & look out for the Don West line about Eric Young ""looking like a baby about to be breast fed"" when Ms. Brooks flashed him & Tenay's reaction to it.  In fact, Tenay & West's commentary here resemble J.R. & King's commentary during a WWE divas match except you normally don't hear this from Tenay & West all the time so it is very comedic.  The ""match"" itself was the only skit on here that was worth the time it was given as Ms. Brooks didn't have on a skimpy outfit but still looked hot while Eric Young was just comedic gold with his ""bikini.""  This was just one of those segments that I just found absolutely funny.

X Division Champion Christopher Daniels vs. Chris Sabin with Jerry Lynn as the special referee - This match was exactly how I said their previous ""Genesis"" PPV was in that it was solid inring work from start to finish with Sabin constantly putting over his new attitude whenever he was in control.  One of the best matches of the night once again by these two.

Here is skit #2 as they had the MVP of the World Series David Eckstein come out to promote some book he was coming out with while AJ Pierzynski & Dale Torborg from the previous World Series champions Chicago White Sox & the basebrawl last year came out as well but acted like heels in destroying his book & double teaming him until Lance Hoyt made the save.  After the action in the previous match, we're given a heavily dry skit that went on too long & didn't involve anyone on the TNA roster to the point where fans were chanting ""WE WANT WRESTLING!!!""  Crap segment overall.

Rhino vs. AJ Styles - Boy, this was the most aggressive I've seen AJ Styles since I started watching TNA because he jumped Rhino during the prematch interview.  They had a high impact wrestling match that resembled a fight/brawl at times with them going though the crowd & backstage.  The ending was great to put over Styles as a heel but the match wasn't over yet & they continued to fight afterwards as well.  This was a completely different AJ Styles match than you would expect...and that's a good thing in this case.

Flag Match: NWA Tag Team Champions LAX vs. AWM - If they would have cut out the last to segments/skits of this PPV, this match would have had more time to be something more special than it was.  The match was alright as it had some good moments such as Gail Kim getting involved in the action & the ending that would lead to the eventual breakup of AMW.  Again, the only downfall is that this match was short.

Thoughout the night, there were backstage segments that teased the idea that DX (Shawn Michaels & Triple H) were in the building along with their supporting players like Big D. Johnson (the fat oily stripper) but it turned out to just be the Voodoo Kin Mafia doing a DX paraody complete with imposters of the Spirit Squad & the Big Fat Oily Guy. Honestly, I found the skit more corny than funny but the punchline was to issue a $1 million challenge for DX to fight them...like WWE would really accept or even acknowledge it.  Another waste of time.

NWA Champion Abyss vs. Sting vs. Christian Cage - This came off like they were more worried about putting over their current storylines with all three (five if you include Tomko & James Mitchell at ringside) than having a match.  It's watchable & has some standout moments like Abyss being stomped face first into the thumbtacks.  But besides that, it seems like a big cluster & the wrestlers seem lost at times.

Kurt Angle vs. Samoa Joe - This was the best out of their 3 match series as it lived up to the expectations that people had for their first encounter.  This was a wrestling clinic complete them getting reciepts for what happened the previous month like Joe going face first into steel steps and a series of reversals between the Nikita Clutch & Ankle Lock.  Again, my favorite match out of their three match series.

So overall, this PPV illistrates that TNA strong point is their ""sports"" with the in-ring wrestling action while they're ""entertainment"" isn't their strongest point with only 1 out of 3 segments worth watching over & over again which knocks down the rating for this PPV.  I recommend, just skip the last two talk segments.",1191196800,,5407,4.497955010224949
