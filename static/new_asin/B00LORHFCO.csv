6497573,2,B00LORHFCO,"Watchable, but if this is digitally restored, i certainly wasn't impressed.  Looked more like ""digitized from a VHS tape"" to me.",1459209600,,128,5.095238095238095

6497575,2,B00LORHFCO,"I have seen many digitally restored digital video disc. This is not.
Picture quality is of poor quality.
Digitally restored means just that, and this is not.",1453248000,2,157,4.851851851851852

6497579,3,B00LORHFCO,"We own all three seasons of the Gilligan's Island TV series.  My 8-yr-old fell in love with the show this summer and is on her 4th round of watching them.  She kept asking if they were ever rescued, so ..... The storyline was good, but not great.  The cast was wonderful, but not quite the same without Tina Louise.  The TV movie tried to bring a resolution to the ""Gilligan's Island"" series by having the castaways rescued and try to resume their lives back into ""civilization"" after being marooned for 15 years.  Unfortunately, they were shipwrecked again on the same island.  Fate perhaps, or trying to restart the series?  I was a little disappointed by the ""restored"" version of the film, but it may be better than the non-restored version.  The crisp, digital quality wasn't there, and there seemed to be some glitches in different places.  I'm not sure if that was caused by the original 70's film being old and spliced, or mediocre restoration services.  They may have done the best they could.  The cover is deceptive as Judith Baldwin, not Tina Louise, played Ginger in this movie.  Still, if you're a Gilligan's Island fan, it's a nice addition to your collection.",1439596800,6,1175,4.733990147783251

8667451,5,B00LORHFCO,"This is a fun movie. I've forgotten how hokey the Gilligan's Return movies were, though. ( I watched the other two on YouTube).  honestly don't get what the complaints are about the quality of this movie. These were shown once only on TV, back when they were released and never seen again. I think the quality of this is about as good as you can expect for the age of the movie.

I own the series, and play it almost every day when I work. ( I work from home.) It's fun and always seems like it's the first time I've seen each one, even thought I've been doing this daily for about a year. I never skip any shows, as they never get old even being seen non stop. A lot of times when I watch a show over and over, like CSI LV, I get to where I can't stand to watch some of them so much and skip a lot. I don't do that with Gillian.

So, yeah the  Return to Gilligan's island moves are super corny, but they're great.  Let the quality go, people, and just have some fun for a change!",1514678400,,980,3.979591836734694
