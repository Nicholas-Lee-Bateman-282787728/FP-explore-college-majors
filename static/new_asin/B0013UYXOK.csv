  I would recommend this to all fitness levels.",1404000000,,104,4.15
3119639,5,B0013UYXOK,"I started doing this workout on demand for free on my TV.  It is an excellent workout!  I works all the muscles in your body (and believe me, you'll feel them the next day!) and is highly adaptable.  Like Rob says, you can add or subtract weight and do the easier or harder moves to make this workout grow with your needs.  All of a sudden, they dropped the option from on demand, so I went to Amazon right away and ordered my own copy.  I'm about to do the workout now!",1381104000,,470,4.065217391304348
3119640,4,B0013UYXOK,When I get a new workout video I preview them before I consider to use them. This is a good video however the workout routine is pretty similar to all the other videos out there. I was looking for something more intense that uses dumbbells.,1366329600,,240,4.355555555555555
3119641,5,B0013UYXOK,"Rob Glick's Total Body Strength Training it soooo true to its title. It is a sound, fun, different workout. I love it.

I wish my knees weren't so unreliable--he does LOTS of squats, lunges, and moves; but I fixed that by just adjusting my range of motion. I can't go as low, but that's ok. It's still a thorough, awesome workout.

You won't regret buying it!",1270166400,,359,4.424242424242424
3119642,5,B0013UYXOK,"This is a great workout! It's one of my favorite weight training DVDs! It's challenging!
You will not be sorry for purchasing it!
It has many exercises that other DVDs don't.  It is a total body workout.

It's Rob with two women behind him doing what he does.  One of them works on an easier level and the other two work on the same one.  The girls are respectfully dressed. (not with their chests hanging out)

You will sweat during this workout.  The length is perfect at around approximately one hour.",1263859200,,504,4.483516483516484
3119643,5,B0013UYXOK,Wasn't expecting the music on a CD but was very cool.  This isn't hard-core at all but it's a little more advanced than for a beginner.  For me it was perfect.,1239235200,,159,4.096774193548387
3119644,5,B0013UYXOK,"I did this workout for the first time the other day and I have to say this is a great workout.  It is fast enough paced that you get your HR up the whole time but you don't feel rushed.  There are quite a few squats and lunges but he varies them enough that you don't feel like there is endless reps or get bored.  This is one of the best circuit workouts I have done in a while.  There is no cardio just strength circuits but it does have a cardio benefit due to the fact of moving upper and lower body at the same time.  Rob is very engaging, encouraging but not over the top.",1216166400,4,578,3.905982905982906
3119645,5,B0013UYXOK,"I own a few other Rob Glick workouts and this one is just like the rest, GERAT! Another reviewer states that it is good for working out almost every muscle and she's RIGHT! You feel the burn for sure, depending on how much weight you use. YOu can mix it up with lighter weights or heavier, depending on what you can handle or in the mood for. AND...you get a bonus cd of the workout music, which is awesome. What a value?! You can't beat it. I haven't seen anyone else do that. I'm so pleased with this purchase. :)",1213315200,6,515,4.16
3119646,5,B0013UYXOK,"This is about my fourth or fifth workout from Rob.  I love all his previous workouts so I thought I'd give this a go and I'm glad I did.  This is really fantastic for working out almost every muscle in your body and it's challenging too.
You use your different sets of weights along with a step to do these exercises.  You can either lighten or make heavier, your load of weight to push yourself or take it easier if the moves seem too difficult.  While there are a lot of the regular moves you'd expect from weight training, there are a few different like doing lunges with glute lifts which might help to 'shock' your muscles.  I love the music that goes along with this workout and they give you a bonus cd with the music on it.
Rob is as friendly as ever and he's always reminding you about your form and technique but he doesn't over do it.  I don't have a lot of workouts led by male instructors and it's nice for a change.  He knows his stuff and he's created an excellent program that I'm able to stick with and really enjoy.  I hope you do too.",1209254400,13,1053,4.178217821782178

8253129,5,B0013UYXOK,"This is a great total body strength training workout for all fitness levels.  Rob has a very pleasant personality and he provides good instruction and motivation.  They use a step platform for some of the moves, but no worries if you don't have one.  I do the workout without the step.  I do have a Swiss ball which helps when performing chest flys; I like to be off the ground for some of the chest work.  I really like the thorough warm-up and cool-down/stretch; so many other videos skimp on these crucial steps.  The only thing I don't like about it is there are very few deadlifts.  Probably because if not done with proper form they can cause injury, but that's true of all lifting moves.  So I continue to do more deadlifts after Rob has moved on to the next exercise.  The entire workout will take about 67 minutes to complete.  I love this workout!",1412553600,2,857,4.435897435897436
8253130,5,B0013UYXOK,I love this workout. This white guy has got the dope dance moves!!! He can give the Zumba creator some competition!!!. He cues well and you will love the workout!!,1407974400,,163,4.466666666666667
