8387790,4,B00332EWWE,"This is truly a very good series about the more recent discoveries made in astronomy. But while the DVD set is decent enough why have the producers not made a Blu-ray version available? This series was originally shown (and continues to be shown) on Oasis HD, a high-definition specialty television channel. If any material deserved high definition it is the images shown in the series from various space craft and telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope. I would have given this a five star rating had I been reviewing the (currently non-existent) HD version.

NOTE: There is a second group of Cosmic Vistas episodes that were made more recently. Hopefully, when the producers release those they will do so on Blu-ray as well as on DVD and will also take that opportunity to release a BD version of their other astronomy series, Hubble's Canvas.

UPDATE: As of late December 2013 a third group of 6 episodes has aired on Oasis HD.",1387411200,2,940,4.832298136645963
8387791,4,B00332EWWE,I was very happy with this collection of images! I am a space enthusiast with a collection of dvds on Hubble images and on programs with planetary images. This collection is one of the better ones. I gave it four stars instead of five because it is a little dated. Some of the later tv shows have more up-to-date images. I would still recommend this to a friend as the price is not too bad for the footage that you get.,1371859200,,419,4.185185185185185
