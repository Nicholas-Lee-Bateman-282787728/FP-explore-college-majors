8495532,4,B0069VHTPI,"The story is what was the hottest about this flick.  Sure, there was plenty of eye candy to keep a guy satisfied.  But the real gem of this was the intrigue.",1357689600,,157,4.032258064516129
8495533,1,B0069VHTPI,This is by far the worst DVD I have ever seen. Do not buy this so called movie we all hated it and want our time back as well as cash. Horrid.,1342483200,,142,3.46875
8495534,4,B0069VHTPI,"Perhaps more than any other film-maker, cult director Toby Ross loves to bend or weave through genres and his ideas are seemingly endless. Rather than re-visiting old themes or rehashing formulaic ideas, Ross rolls the dice and wins! To Fetch A Predator is a rather quirky hybrid that works well not only as part erotic thriller but also very well as a satire of NBC's Dateline. Although To Fetch A Predator could easily be part of Ross' Darkotica series, the viewer will more than likely find it to be less brooding and downtrodden. In fact, there's a very sly humor which permeates the dark atmosphere making his latest endeavor one entertaining if not highly ambitious film & perhaps a crossover blend which will undoubtedly reach a wider audience. What I enjoyed most about the film is how it forces us to question our own morals or re-think everything we've been taught to believe about sexual predators as well as the fashioned media. In the end, we should wonder who the real predators are. If you're a fan of Toby Ross, To Fetch A Predator doesn't disappoint. On the other hand, this wouldn't be a bad place to start if you've never caught one of his films before. Two enthusiastic thumbs up!",1340841600,2,1200,4.691943127962086
8495535,1,B0069VHTPI,I gave this one star as Amazon do not allow  you to rate a film with no stars. Maybe it should be rated minus 10. Everything  is dreadful  about this film. The color  is a mess in many scenes. The acting does not exist- in fact you cringe when watching  most of the performances. Lazy script and the director  (maybe there wasn't one?)is as mundane as the actors are. You know the film is going to be bad as there is no name or address on the sleeve of the  company who released the dvd .Isn't that illegal?,1340755200,,507,4.112244897959184
8495536,3,B0069VHTPI,"I've grown to look forward to Toby Ross DVD's. I was a little disappointed by this one. The production quality should be getting better as he produces more film's, but it is not... The sound in most scenes sounds like an echo chamber. Some of the sets are recognizable from his other films and they don;t even bother to take down promotional posters for his other films in the background.
The story is weak and took too long to get into. Hey, don't you know the phone number to the payphone next to the soda machine that Handsomes wife will stop at to get a soda on the way home, and can't you predict the exact time she will be there. A boardroom scene where the main character ""Handsom"" was pitching the show idea seemed to drag forever and the actors were really weak.
There are a few nude shots that feel like they were thrown in, just to make it more interesting, but even that is not enough to make the film ""entertaining""
Not my favorite Toby Ross Film!",1339718400,3,960,4.338888888888889
