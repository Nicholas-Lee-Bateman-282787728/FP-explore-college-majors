8063431,4,B0009N7LY6,"I loved the Mr. Peepers Show of the early 50s. I joined the Navy in 54 to 58 and got the Paul Gallico books in the ship's library and liked them too. I found out that Wally Cox was cast as Hiram Holiday and I was not able to see the show. Here's my chance. I orded Vol. 1. Please reissue Vol. 2. I saw Wally Cox tooling around New York city on motorcycle. A once in lifetime thrill.
