8155608,1,B000KCIBQ8,"Bill Viola's ""I Do Not Know What It Is That I Am Like"" (which will be refered to from here on as ""IDNKWIITIAL"") is the perfect example of what a movie is like when it cannot live up to the standard set by its own idea. It is proof that you can have the most amazing concept for a video or film ever conceived, but that doesn't mean that you can create a good video or film from it. The back of the DVD case states: ""[It] is a personal investigation into the inner states and connections to the animal consciousness we all possess"". That's such a interesting idea that really could have made an amazing piece. I would to watch a movie that explored the behavioral similarities that humans and animals share, and explored the concept of a shared collective consciousness. Bill Viola, unfortunately took that brilliant concept and made a really boring, overly long, and seemingly pointless video. Had I not read the back of the DVD case, I would have no idea what the concept is. As it is now, ""IDNKWIITIAL"" is basically like watching the most inane nature documentary ever made.
 Looking back at it, one of the major reasons of my complaints might come from the fact that ""IDNKWIITIAL"" is just too dated to be relevant anymore. Maybe back in 1986 when it was made, there were no other videos that were able to focus on just the animals that closely or personally. But in 2009, after stuff like ""Planet Earth"" has revolutionized and changed nature documentaries, ""IDNKWIITIAL"" can no longer claim relevance. Then again, I can't imagine the shots of, who I assume is Viola, the bearded man just sitting around his house taking notes and watching a tiny monitor were ever considered high art.",1239148800,3,1687,4.604651162790698

8155610,5,B000KCIBQ8,"I love everything Bill has done. I have loved his work since he showed his pieces to Gene Youngblood's video art class when I was at CalArts in the 70's. So, I'm not perfectly objective. But, this video, along with Chott el Djrid and Hatsu Yume, are my favorites.  I think that ""I do not know..."" is in some ways an extension of ""Hatsu Yume"" in that it deals with man and nature, in color.  But, this video, in particular, deals with how we relate to nature and how aspects of nature relate to each other. I don't want to give away all the cool details. But, the way that the ""Bill eating a fish"" scene echos back to the buffalo scenes, is extraordinary. If you like Bill Viola, you will LOVE this.  If you don't know Bill Viola but like video art, then this is an accessible, powerful, very intense introduction to his work. I only hope that ""Editions a Voir"" keeps making Bill's work available to American video freaks like myself!!!",1180224000,5,935,4.393063583815029
