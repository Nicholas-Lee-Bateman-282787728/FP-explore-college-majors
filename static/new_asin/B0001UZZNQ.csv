8019980,4,B0001UZZNQ,"A good action flick from Gene Autry's later period.  Made in 1950, this movie co-stars Gail Davis who is in top form as the obnoxious brat whom Gene soon wins over.  The story has to do with Gene convincing the other ranchers to use barbed wired to fence their lands in order to isolate their stock and improve the breed.  But Harry Shannon wants to bring in sheep so he has his gunmen wreak havoc upon the ranchers until Autry turns the tables on him.  Gene sings several good songs but, in my opinion, most of the songs are misplaced in the storyline.  This movie is reproduced with sparkling clarity.  High production values in producing the DVD.  A lengthy written biography of Gail Davis.  About seven minutes of conversation between Autry and Pat Buttram taken from the Gene Autry Theater on the former Nashville Network.  This DVD arrived from Amazon's subsidiary provider several days sooner than did the rest of the order (although New Year's holiday was in there).",1325894400,,974,4.715976331360947

8019982,5,B0001UZZNQ,"Filmed in 1950, starring Gene Autry, who by that time was a seasoned actor who had grown better and better with the years. Gone were some of the dressy and wonderfully tailored outfits of yesteryear and in it's place was a man in plain jeans and shirts, (of course, we still had the fancy guns and custom made cowboy boots Autry was so famous for) but none the less the hero who saves the day.  One of the first in the area to use barbed wire for his cattle ranch, Autry had to uncover a plot by the bad guys to drive a wedge between neighbors using the barbed wire controversy, so that they could buy their ranchs to raise sheep.  In turn he also helps a young girl, Gail Davis and her brother to keep their ranch which was in trouble financially.  Autry movies in the late 40's and early 50's took on a much more realistic story line which I guess was due to the maturing of this famous ""Singing Cowboy"".  Either way...whether in early movies or the later, more serious movies....they just didn't make them any better.  Autry will never be forgotten for the moral and ethical values he showed in these movies.  My hats off to you Mr. Autry....He died Oct 2, 1998 long before I discovered his movies and I wish I had found them sooner!!",1093824000,6,1237,4.333333333333333
