8346072,5,B001VE2692,"I would give this DVD 10 stars if they were available.  Having taken several workshops from David, I can say that he is one of the best artists as well as instructors I've had the pleasure to take from.  He is down-to-earth, enthusiastic about painting, challenging, very good at getting the feel and essence of a scene without defining every little item the eye can see.  I find him amazing.  If you are into growing as a watercolor artist, David is one of the best out there to move you from one level to the next.  I am sorry that the person who gave this DVD a one-star couldn't appreciate the kind of art that David produces.  It doesn't matter.  There is a world full of people who do, as exemplified by the many many awards he has received from around the world, including China.  'nough said!",1500595200,,800,4.394557823129252

8346075,1,B001VE2692,I was looking for help in finding the light.  David doesn't  really give this and his work is not impressive.  My 9 year old  paints better than this.  Don't waste your money,1370995200,2,174,4.3125
