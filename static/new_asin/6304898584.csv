7879484,4,6304898584,"If nothing more than entertainment than buy the tape for the various skills involved. I never recieved my copy of the tape after the fight so I had been looking for this tape for a long while. I review every different MMA fights out there. Not just to see what styles they have incorporated with their knowledge of fighting skills but how they morph each style so that it has the best chance of succeeding. I look at all my fights and break it down to what might be a better approach if it exists. I also look at all the fights to see the different approaches of each fighter. You never know, I may have to face them one day. This was my best shape at 375 lbs. and at 17% bodyfat. I know I can do alot better than that for the next time.",1042675200,,737,4.054794520547945
7879485,3,6304898584,"This Super Brawl was held on April 9, 1997. This event as two tournaments and a Superfight rematch. In the Middleweight tournament is Brazil Open veteran Maurice Travis and rookie fighters in Leonard Carter, Pat Matsuda and Jason Pili. This was interesting but I did not care. In the Heavyweight tournament is UFC 6 veteran John Matua and rookie fighters in Lance Gibson, Bob Gilstrap and Peter Matautia. Good tournament but was not great. The Superfight was a rematch from Super Brawl 3 match between Danny Bennett and Jay R. Palmer. At the last fight Bennett kicked Palmer's head in the 15th row of the Blaisdell Arena. This fight was ok but not as great as the first fight.",996883200,,676,4.689075630252101
7879486,4,6304898584,"...It is a two-tape set; the first tape is 83 minutes and thesecond 20 something minutes.
It features many great fights includingthe rematch between J.R. Palmer and Danny Bennett. At Super Brawl 3 the two fought and it resulted in the most amazing knockout I have ever seen. You can tell the rematch is personal. Also on the tape are two four-man tournaments. One lightweight (200lbs or under) and one Heavyweight tournament (200lbs and over). You may recognize some of the fighters from the UFC.
This is a Mixed Martial Arts competition not Pro Wrestling.  These are real fights not fake fights. If you enjoy Mixed Martial Arts this is an excellent tape. If you are into predetermined outcomes and the theatrics of Pro Wrestling and don't want to see real fights don't buy this video.  END",956707200,3,790,4.759124087591241
