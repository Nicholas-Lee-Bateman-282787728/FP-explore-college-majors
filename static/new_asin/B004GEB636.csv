She seems to have always had that presence of mind, dealing with the present situation, that we see in her acting in ""The Good Wife"". The film settings look so authentic, she puts herself in the picture as a real person. Good for Archie, and hope to see more of her in the future.",1485475200,,325,4.258064516129032
8428666,4,B004GEB636,"Yasmin is the story of a Pakistani woman living two separate lives. She spends half her life in the Muslim world with her traditionally Muslim family. The rest of her day is spent working a job and living and socializing with her British peers. When terrorists strike New York September 11, 2001 her world changes as she finds herself in the midst of the prejudicial backlash against all Muslims. Archie Panjabi brings Yasmin to life for me. She portrays so much human emotion without even speaking that one can't help but feel the pain and conflict that Yasmin is going through. This movie gives one a peek at a very personal struggle with prejudice and living with grace and dignity through it all. I recommended this movie ... two thumbs up. Excellent performance from Archie Panjabi.",1349049600,10,787,4.794117647058823
