2077082,4,B0002CZB6O,I wanted to see this film before I decided whether or not to buy it ~ I rented it and was pleased to find it did not have that 'dated' l970's feeling at all ~ it was pretty good in theme and story ~ Jill Clayburgh and Lee Remick give strong and good performances representing opposite sides of the coin in our society and it's restrictions ~ ~ ~ It's not really heavy either but good for a discussion with your mate ~ My man and I had a really good talk after this film  ~ ~  I like Monte Markham for his intelligence and was not disappointed in his part in the story ~ ~ ~ Worth seeing. Good to share with someone.,1390435200,,615,3.9516129032258065
2077083,1,B0002CZB6O,Buy this disc only if you must have the movie now. Otherwise wait to take it from off air or until another DVD company decides to do an acceptable job of transferring it. This DVD is a DVD-R with a picture that looks as if it were made from a copy of a copy VHS. My laser disc issued by Image Entertainment is of far superior quality. This DVD is a total waste of money.,1369440000,3,370,3.9466666666666668
2077084,5,B0002CZB6O,"I saw this movie in the 70's when it came out. As with many from that era, it is another one you don't see too often in reruns on TV. I was happy to see it offered on DVD, and was glad to add it to my collection. With digital downloads being pushed in favor of DVDs, the price continues to rise on films from recent history. There are some which are very worth it to me, and this is one of them.
Based on a book by Gail Sheehy, this movie stars two great actresses who have since passed away. Jill Clayburgh, and Lee Remick are sorely missed. Look for Melanie Mayron of thirtysomething fame as one of the prostitutes in which Ms. Sheehy chronicles in her story.",1356566400,7,661,4.131782945736434
2077085,4,B0002CZB6O,This is really a good movie and Lee Remick is as usual a super good actress. The subject matter when this movie was released was not talked about very much.,1348272000,,156,4.233333333333333
2077086,5,B0002CZB6O,Very pleased with Hustling DVD. Excellent quality for a movie made in the 70's. So gritty and real. Would highly reccomend[spelling?] for any Jill Clayburg fans out there.,1315612800,7,171,5.142857142857143
2077087,2,B0002CZB6O,"This film is based upon Gail Sheehy's pseudo-sociological book dealing with streetwalking prostitution in midtown New York, and features Lee Remick as a middle class magazine journalist who selects one particular harlot named Wanda (Jill Clayburgh) with whom she somewhat bonds in the course of investigating unsavoury real estate dealings involving socially prominent figures who ostensibly benefit from prostitution income. Despite the use of open mikes and harshly grained lighting to bring about a sense of aural and visual realism, the work suffers from a romantic approach to its subject, presenting the prostitutes and local police who arrest them as one reluctantly interlaced family, with the pimps grotesque caricatures, and the direction by Joseph Sargent vying with Jerry Fielding's jazzy score for being the most unimaginative contribution, whereas those real problems associated with this type of vice activity: venereal disease, the deleterious effect upon local business establishments, etc., are barely touched upon, indeed being submerged beneath a flurry of bootless subplots.",1135987200,6,1095,5.807453416149069
8026283,2,B0002CZB6O,"1975 (NOT 2012 Amazon!) TV movie. Hollywood version of the book. Not very good. See ""Whore 2"" made in NYC for a more realistic film.",1482796800,,132,4.32

8026292,5,B0002CZB6O,"This film received a lot of attention when it was shown on TV back in the mid seventies. It was made for television. It was groundbreaking. The actresses are great, Remick and Clayburgh. It has a feel of a play in the performances (a lot of the cast were New York City theatre actors while Remick had been a film star for years and bringing that huge reputation to television for the project; Clayburgh, still mostly unknown got recognition for this but would in a few years become hugely famous and an Oscar winner due to her performance in another great seventies film 'An Unmarried Woman'), but is filmed, if not artfully, certainly grittily as New York City was in the seventies and eighties. Further, the screenplay is well done as in it is honest, is constantly putting issues, and consequences, and nuances on the table; there isn't one wasted moment. This was a risky project and the characters and the performances are not caricatures. Through our eyes now it may seem like caricature but that is because the issues have been explored so widely for the last 35 years since, and because, this film was shown. One point might be the exaggerated New York accents used by the actors but one gets used to it, especially if one has lived in New York City for any extended period of time. This is a substantial film. It holds up very well. It should be respected and not disdained.",1426291200,,1383,4.580645161290323
