8356569,5,B0028NSEGY,"Romance on the Run is movie-watching that becomes surprisingly fun in this snappy and charming little ""B"" from Republic Pictures starring Donald Woods and Patricia Ellis. Director Gus Meins gives Jack Townley's screenplay from an Eric Taylor story just the right pacing and atmosphere. There is also just a bit more polish than usual for a ""B"" picture and the performances by everyone are first rate, particularly the two leads and Edward Brophy, who supplies the humor.

The story is reminiscent of a Boston Blackie, with Donald Woods' excellent turn as Barry Drake similar to the style and character of Chester Morris in those films. It is all about suave Drake trying to recover a stolen necklace, and seemingly succeeding. When it turns out he's recovered a phony, both he and the secretary for insurance man J.W. Ridgeway chase the the two culprits with the necklace from Cincinnati to New Orleans while Lt. Eckhardt of the police chase them.

William Demarest of My Three Sons' television fame is likable mirroring the Faraday part in the Boston Blackie series and Grace Bradley is also fine as Lily Lamont, one half of the thieves Drake and Dale Harrison are chasing. Some backwoods humor, including a moment about ""Revenuers"" as Drake has to backtrack once he discovers who really has the necklace makes for great fun. The ending doesn't let the viewer down as a romance begun on a train finally reaches its destination.

All-in-all, this little ""B"" gem from 1938 will get very high marks from fans of that genre of film. While so many are slow-moving and dull, this one has a good script and sparkling, energetic performances. Woods and Ellis -- a WAMPAS baby who often referred to herself as the Queen of ""B"" pictures at Warners -- along with Edward Brophy and William Demarast make this one a 53-minite ""B"" mystery fans won't want to miss.",1372377600,2,1850,4.829652996845426
