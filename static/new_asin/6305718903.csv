1060211,3,6305718903,"This was by far one of the most interesting movies to come out in '99, but don't be mistaken.  The basis of the film is a quote from the ""Gospel of Thomas.""  Many of the passages of this Gospel that they use in the  movie are not in the book.  Others are simply miss-quotes.  The filmmakers  counted on the fact that not many people have actually read the  ""Gospel of Thomas.""  Also, the books that the movie says the  church is keeping from the faithful are easily available.  They are just  not canonized as holy texts.  However this is, after all, just a movie.  As  a movie it stands well on it's own and is worth watching.  Some spectacular  special effects (though some could have been better handled) and a well  thought out plot make this movie memorable. Great performances by Arquette  and Byrne that, in the hands of lesser actors, could have turned into a bad  movie.",949449600,,879,4.449367088607595
1060212,5,6305718903,WELL WHERE CAN I START THIS MOVIE IS THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME. STIGMATA IS SUPERB AND BRILLIANT. RUPERT WAINRIGHT SHOULD GET AN ACADEMY AWARD FOR THIS MOVIE.

1060213,2,6305718903,"The movie had a good story at its core, but it never really tries to add up to anything meaningful. Loud for the sake of being loud, heavy-handed when delivering any sort of moral, and confused at times about its own  plot, Stigmata goes nowhere.",947808000,19,246,4.466666666666667
1060214,4,6305718903,"where should i begin? the explicit yet appropriate content of this film or it's characters?the movie is based on an atheist named frankie(patricia), she is in her tub when she recieves her first of several painful to watch  but obviously more painful to experience stigmata(hence the title). yadda  yadda yadda, catholic priests(byrne), yadda yadda yadda, the quote: anabe  non importante which loosely translate to: the messenger is not important,  yadda yadda yadda, conspiracy, yadda yadda yadda, room of fire, and then we  get to the end. i loved this film, not a perfect film but great. now,  wether youl believe in stigmata or think it's just the proof of hysteria( i  will explain later), this is a film to see. i loved the way how the  segments of scenes merge together by phasing.
now, the controversy,  stigmata as you know must have heard is not only the bleeding of MY LORD  AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST, but the actual puncture wounds, yeah i know its  very disturbing but MY LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST died on the cross for  our sin's.
back to the topic, hysteria is what skeptics claim stigmata  is. now im not the best to tell you what it is but i can give you the basic  theory behind it. it is when a person that really believes that something  physical is happening to him, BUT ISN'T, actually does, you know what i  mean? like lets say a man is dreaming and he truly believes that someone  stabbed him, and when he wakes up he bore the wound that he believed he  has. now don't freak out or anything just because you have weird dream, its  for the people who truly, deeply, and thinks with his heart and soul that  he has some physical injury upon him.
finally, im a christian, i'm asian,  and i loved this film, what christ went through is very painful, yet so  full of meaning, he is so strong and focused and the pain he had to endure  is of course not really felt but the actress, patricia, is very good in  this film, it takes on hell of an actress to act out the pain and suffering  of a cruxifiction. she is very talented and so is byrnes, very good cast,  plot, twists, and leaves you with a satisfied feeling.",947203200,19,2135,4.438144329896907
1060215,3,6305718903,"This movie, often billed under the category of ""supernatural thriller"" or ""horror movie"", in my opinion is difficult to define entirely by either label though I suppose it has its moments which allude to these descriptions. Stigmata presents a good story, complete with intrigue and emotion, nice special effects and a quite surprisingly hard hitting message that leaves the viewer with some measurable food for contemplation.
The story is about a 23-year-old hairdresser by the name of Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette) who also happens to be an atheist. She's just an ordinary non-religious person, with ordinary friends. After Frankie's mother sends her a gift, which happens to be a cross from a deceased stigmata priest in Brazil, things change. She begins to experience the phenomenon of stigmata; bleeding like Jesus Christ did on the cross with wounds appearing in her hands, feet, head and back. Frankie's stigmata experience is also accompanied by intense visions of the crucifixion of Christ which are portrayed more violently and dramatically then I had seen in any other movie which depicted the crucifixion of Jesus. Frankie's disturbing encounters, which she can't understand, causes her to go to doctors and psychologists who determine she must either be suicidal or epileptic. Her chance encounter with a local Catholic priest brings a Vatican investigator, Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne), to document her episodes. Confronted with the powerful force that has taken control of Frankie, Kiernen immediately recognizes this phenomenon as an actual miracle of God. She has become a messenger for God to reveal a lost Gospel supposed to have been written by Jesus Himself. This revelation uncovers a conspiracy to keep the Catholic Church, not Jesus, as central to faith. Former priests come forward to validate the truth of this so-called Gospel by Jesus. Frankie and Andrew develop a unique friendship as the film progresses, and eventually both are met individually with their own confrontation of the question of faith over religion as well as to deal with the conspiracy at hand which has some officials in the ranks of the Catholic Church prepared to pursue whatever means necessary to silence the messenger and the Gospel she is compelled by her experience to convey. The intensity builds as the story progresses, leading the audience to a dramatic and powerful close.
To say any more would be to spoil the climax and conclusion of this movie, but I will say that what was most striking to me was the message conveyed through the film that ""the Kingdom of God is within you... not in mansions of wood and stone..."" signifying that God is not found in mere religious structure or traditions of men, but He is living and real and desires to indwell the hearts of people. Of course anyone familiar with their Bible knows that this message is boldly conveyed throughout the Scriptures and not merely in some lost pages of an ancient alleged Gospel, but the movie confronts the topic of faith head on and I feel does so brilliantly. The interesting twist of this picture is that God uses an atheist to proclaim His message; someone completely non-religious who is touched by religion in a very disturbing yet powerful and intimate way - in that she is identified with Christ through His sufferings.
Probably not a whole lot of Christians will jump at the opportunity to buy this film, because of some of its disturbing scenes and language at points, not to mention the ""dark"" feel of the movie (which includes themes of demonic possession, crucifixion, etc.).  That is completely understandable and I certainly wouldn't classify this film as a ""Christian"" movie, but I would recommend it nonetheless because no matter your religious affiliation, the movie is powerful and the story is great and makes some strong points about religion versus relationship. There is also a short clip that portrays a very strong anti-abortion message, which was quite surprising as well.  The film-work, acting and even the music was decent. I gave it three stars because there are better movies out there and this one is on the ""dark side"" as far as movies go.  I would also classify it as not appropriate for children because of some bad language at times and disturbing, violent scenes. I saw it twice at the theater and enjoyed it both times.  I have both the DVD version (which is great because there is commentary through the movie by the director) and the VHS.",946339200,6,4464,4.995967741935484
1060216,5,6305718903,"This DVD features a gorgeous 2.35:1 widescreen transfer, capturing all of the films beauty.  STIGMATA is probably the most gorgeously filmed movie EVER, and the DVD edition is great.  The added scenes are great, the  alternate ending is VERY interesting, and the Natalie Imbruglia music  video, for the truly haunting ""Identify"", is moody and luscious.  For open-minded viewers, Stigmata is a great pick.  And for the record, it  does NOT rip off The Exorcist, as the Exorcist did not INVENT  ""possession signals"", such as talking in a strange deeper voice,  speaking different languages, or facial contortions; these have been  documented phenomena in MANY TRUE POSSESSION CASES.  Just wanted to clear  that up. Patricia Arquette is brilliant.",946339200,68,744,5.318965517241379

The lead characters are sympathetic; a woman receives the stigmata and a priest who is losing his faith in a corrupt Catholic Church. The dilemma centers around the scrolls discovered in the 1940s with many more gospels in them that the Church does not want to be made public because the gospels emphasize the divine in everything and a personal relationship with it; hence, no need for the Church.

1060447,5,6305718903,"In the Brazilian village of Belo Quinto, Father Andrew Kiernan, a former scientist and a Jesuit priest who investigates supposed miracles, examines a statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe weeping blood at the funeral of Father Paulo Alameida, who had experienced stigmata. While Andrew is collecting evidence, a young boy steals the rosary from the father's hand. The boy later sells it to a woman in a marketplace, who sends it to her atheist daughter, Frankie Paige, living in Pittsburgh.
Frankie is attacked by an unseen force while bathing, and receives two deep wounds on her wrists. As the wounds are treated, the doctors cannot find the cause. Frankie asks a priest if he is Andrew Kiernan, but the priest says he is Father Derning, the lights in the train flash, and Frankie is whipped from behind by an unseen force. While Frankie is hospitalized again, the priest sends security tapes showing the attack to the Vatican, and Andrew is sent to investigate.
Andrew interviews Frankie, believing her wounds may also be stigmata. When she tells him she is an atheist, Andrew tells her that stigmata is when the deeply devoted are struck with the five wounds that Jesus received during the crucifixion. Frankie begins to research on her own what the cause could be. Her head begins to bleed, the third stigmata wound caused by the Crown of Thorns. Frankie runs home, where Andrew is waiting, and then runs into an alley. As Andrew pursues her, Frankie smashes a glass bottle and uses the shards to carve symbols on the hood of a car: when Andrew approaches her, she yells at him in another language.
I enjoyed this film very much and I engulfed myself into her character. Gabriel Byrne played in another movie just like this one except he played the devil in ""End of Days"" with Arnold Schwarzenegger.",1481241600,4,1800,4.790996784565916

They are in many respects more in tune with modern science, not the materialistic parts of but the parts that reveal connections among all things. I believe in god as a cosmoquantum supra-conscious aether or the essence or stem of all things, a unified geometry that underlies all reality. This is more along the line s of Pantheism, Panpsychism and related perspectives. All other perspectives are Deistic or idealistic,  and gnosis and love should be the way of everyone. Catholics see it as heresy , to what the idealism of institutionalized power and biased manipulation. No wonder Christians, yell and nash their teeth, when we believe in thing's and figure heads while mocking the cosmoquantum holy spirit. Aetheria not materia is true.

Like at least one other reviewer, I was so pleased that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Nag-Hammadi-Scriptures/dp/0061626007/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Nag Hammadi Scriptures</a>&nbsp;were mentioned at the end. These are the ""lost gospels"" (buried/hidden for safe keeping, actually) of the words of the living Jesus. Here are just a few juicy excerpts for all y'all with ears to hear...

The Gospel of Thomas:
56 Jesus said, Whoever has come to know the world has discovered a carcass, and whoever has discovered a carcass, of that person the world is not worthy.
67 Jesus said, One who knows everything but lacks in oneself lacks everything.
77 Jesus said, I am the light that is over all things. I am all: from me all has come forth, and to me all has reached. Split a piece of wood; I am there. Lift up the stone, and you will find me there.
78 Jesus said, Why have you come out to the countryside? To see a reed shaken by the wind? And to see a person dressed in soft clothes, like your rulers and your powerful ones? They are dressed in soft clothes, and they cannot understand truth.
103 Jesus said, Blessed is the person who knows at what point the robbers are going to enter, so that he may arise, bring together his estate, and arm himself before they enter.

The Wisdom of Jesus Christ:
The Savior said to them, I want you to know that all people born on earth from the foundation of the world until now are of dust, and though they have inquired about God, who he is and what he is like, they have not found him. The wisest of people have speculated on the basis of the order and movement of the universe, yet their speculation has missed the truth. It is said that philosophers voice three distinct opinions about the order of the universe, and they disagree with each other. Some of them say that the world governs itself, others say that divine forethought governs it, still others that fate is in charge. All these opinions are wrong. Of the three opinions I have just mentioned, none of them comes close to the truth. They are mere human opinions.""

The Book of Thomas:
Woe to you, prisoners, for you are bound in caves. You laugh, you rejoice in mad laughter. You do not perceive your destruction. Neither do you perceive your plight, nor have you understood that you dwell in darkness and death. Rather, you are drunk with fire and full of bitterness. Your hearts are deranged because of the smoldering within you, and the poison and blows of your enemies are a delight to you. Darkness has risen in you like the light, for you have surrendered your freedom to slavery. You have darkened your hearts and surrendered your minds to foolishness. You have filled your minds with the smoke of the fire within you, and your light has been hidden in the dark cloud. You love the garment you wear, although it is filthy, and you have been gripped by nonexistent hope. You have believed in what you do not know. You all live in bondage but pride yourselves in your freedom. You have baptized your souls in the water of darkness. You have pursued your own wishes.""

For one its not a horror movie.  It has been classified at such in a few places but to me its really a though provoking thriller.  To me its all the better for that.  After receiving a rosary from her mother unbeknownst to her to have been stolen from a dead priest young hair stylist Frankie, an atheist, begins to endure the attacks of the stigmata (the wounds of leading up to and including the crucifixion-crown of thorns, whipping, nails through the wrists and feet and spear through the side-) and signs of possession .  A priest comes to her and grows to care about her.  As the spirit within her begins to speak, the younger priest starts reevaluating his feelings on the Catholic churches ways through the scriptures of Thomas.  With the vatican in a stir over it all it may be all on him to save Frankie.",1459036800,,825,4.466666666666667

1061188,3,6305718903,It was a pretty good film.  Gabriel Byrne is pretty good and so is Jonathan Pryce. A bit overacted but a nice little film to watch.,1458000000,,131,4.038461538461538
1061189,5,6305718903,"Stigmata is a wonderful movie with a rather clever premise. It features Gabriel Byrne as scientist-turned-priest, Father Andrew Kiernan. Kiernan works for a division of The Vatican called The Congregation for the Causes of Saints. It is his job to travel the world to investigate any purported miracles that are brought to The Vatican's attention. This movie is worth it for Gabriel Byrne's physical appearance alone. Gabriel moves beyond handsome to Lord-have-mercy hot, which is appropriate, I suppose, given his character's profession.  Patricia Arquette plays Frankie Paige, a 20-something atheist who participates in all manner of heathenism (clubbing, drinking, sex) who suddenly starts receiving the Stigmata, the wounds suffered by Christ when he was crucified. This catches The Vatican's attention and off goes Father Kiernan to Pittsburgh to investigate what is happening to Frankie. Long story short (I don't want to give too much away), Father Kiernan grows quite fond of Frankie, and vice versa, and he becomes more a man trying to save the woman he (perhaps?) loves instead of strictly a priest investigating someone suffering the Stigmata. Gabriel and Patricia work and look great together. Their chemistry is palpable. Both performances are stellar. The script is strong, although Gabriel can express so much with just a look.  His smile is breath-taking. His intelligence shines through during a scene where Andrew explains to Frankie how it was he came to be a priest after working as scientist. He is so incredibly charming. Poor Frankie. She's smitten. So was I. There is also a great supporting cast, including Jonathan Pryce as Cardinal Houseman, Andrew's boss. Both men are powerful actors as that power shines through in their scenes together near the end of the film. Nia Long is also great as Frankie's best friend, Donna.

If you're an ardent Catholic (and can't separate film from reality) my guess is you won't appreciate this film.  If you're squicky about blood and/or violence this may not be for you either. No punches (or stabs or nails or whips) are pulled in the scenes when Frankie receives the Stigmata wounds.",1458000000,2,2148,5.181556195965418

1061381,5,6305718903,"Just one question.  Is there a gospel of St. Thomas?  If so, is it true the ""church"" does not recognize it or what?  Why haven't we seen a copy of this book.  If it is the actual gospel Jesus Christ, then everything written in that book is of a divine nature and would be applicable to everyone and everything.  I want to see the Book of St. Thomas.  I think the ""church"" as its own agenda to keep power by controlling what is made available to the public.  This movie brings up a lot of stuff that if answered would open up a whole new way of thinking and would actually give more power to God rather than take it away.  It would also give more importance and make critical each person's self worth and how important it is to value oneself.  Bottomline - Old Testament (Arc of the Covenant) showcased in ""The 10 Commandments"";  New Testament (Book of St. Thomas) showcased in ""Stigmata"".

 This is what I took away from this movie.  It was also an excellent thrilling ride that took you through the 5 stages of Stigmata very graphically.  All in all a super good movie that is a must watch movie.  Did the makers of this movie try to get out a message that has been hidden for ages OR is this just another deliberate attempt to confuse everyone.

1061727,1,6305718903,"This was SO bad. Purporting to be based on a discredited Gnostic ""scripture"", this movie is like a textbook for how to recognize demonic possession. Instead of possession, though, the plot claims to show that dramatic, supernatural signs - flames everywhere, a woman considering an abortion who appears to be channelling a very old person who manifests his anger in what are traditionally considered demonic ways - mean that Jesus never intended what the NT Gospels say, but instead He intended for us to ""find Him under every stone"" (this, by the way, is Gnostic pantheism and not the theology of any part of Judaism or of any Jewish sect, however obscure).

The movie eventually suggests that the Gnostic gospel of Thomas contains the real words of Jesus, which the power-hungry apostles supposedly suppressed - but it does not reveal some of the more outrageous claims of this same gospel (""Mary will become a man to enter Heaven""!!). At the end of this contradictory plot, the priest investigating the matter abandons his priestly vows, so now he can sleep with the troubled, pregnant, suicidal but pretty woman at the center of the phenomena - yay!  So awful. I can NOT understand how anyone gave this a high rating.

For anyone hoping the Gospel of Thomas was wrongly excluded from the NT, please read it. The Gnostics OFTEN hijacked the famous figures of other religions and wrote their own ideas as though having been spoken by these other figures. That is what they did with Jesus. Thoth, an Egyptian god, is another figure used by them to promote Gnostic ideas that were in no way shared by the Egyptians.",1438214400,3,1615,4.802158273381295

1061729,4,6305718903,"Its been some time since I originally saw this movie. I didn't see it in theaters but when it was released on either cable or disc, maybe even VHS. At the time I remember it felt like a number of other movies that came out about the same time that combined a rising tide of Satanic evil battled by a Catholic church that seemed in turmoil only to rise up and face that evil head on. Maybe it was just a few films being released at the same time or that my memory is not what it once was. In any event, the movie I watched now felt a lot stronger than the one I watched way back when.

Gabriel Byrne stars as Father Andrew Kiernan, a scientific researcher for the Vatican. His job is to go to various locations in the world where miraculous events have taken place to verify or deny the existence of those events. For the most part he discovers that the sudden appearance of say Christ image on a building wall is nothing more than oxidation caused by rusty drains, but there are moments that something truly miraculous have happened.

The film opens with one of these events as a statue of the virgin mother begins to bleed from her eyes in South America. As Kiernan observes the event he stands transfixed while his doubts about his beliefs come into conflict with what his eyes see. The statue began bleeding when the priest in charge of this location passed away. While lying in his coffin as the crowd observes the statue, his rosary is stolen by a young boy who sells it to a tourist in town. Kiernan gathers samples to take with him in his investigation but doesnt load the statue to send to the Vatican as is usually the case.

The scene changes to Philadelphia and we now come across young Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette). A punked out hair stylist Frankie is a free spirit with no religious connections to speak of. It was her mother that bought the rosary thinking it was just a necklace. Frankie gets it in the mail and shortly after problems begin. Frankie begins to suffer sudden attacks which leave her physically damaged even though no one is with her at the time and the wounds she suffers are not self-inflicted. The first of these occur in her bathtub where she finds holes as if spikes were driven through her wrists.

These wounds and the way they come about are referred to as stigmata, the wounds suffered by Christ on the cross when he was crucified. While theyve happened to various people over the years Frankie has no idea what is going on or why she is having this happen. Word reaches the Vatican about the event and Kiernan is sent to investigate. Prior to his departure from Rome and just before he receives these instructions were witness to a bit of a confrontation between him and his superior, Cardinal Houseman (Jonathan Pryce). While it means little at the time it will eventually become one of the most important aspects of the film.

As Kiernan investigates the stigmata occurrences of young Frankie the two begin to form a certain friendship, nothing romantic but more along the lines of Frankie getting guidance when it comes to religion and Kiernan slowly and possibly rediscovering his faith. Which each new mark of the stigmata the effect they are having on Frankie physically and emotionally intensifies. For Kiernan he discovers something more. When Frankie suffers the wounds she also tends to transform, almost as if possessed. She speaks in tongues which Kiernan records and at one point inscribes an ancient language on the wall of her apartment. While Kiernan had no idea what these words mean a friend at the Vatican tells him to back off.

It seems that the words are written in an ancient Aramaic language that was spoken by Jesus Christ himself. What they say could be fatal to the basis for the Catholic Church or interpreted to reinvigorate a belief in God throughout the world. As the secret world of the Vatican is revealed to Kiernan and the viewer as well, the true meaning of what has happened opens up before our eyes. Whether good will triumph over evil, if that is what it really is, isn't revealed until the end of the film.

The movie has drawn comparisons to being a lackluster EXORCIST rip off but is far from that. The only real similarities between the two are the involvement of the Catholic Church and the seeming possession at times of Frankie. But there are marked differences on hand as well. The question of whether Frankie is demonically possessed, mentally ill or being influenced by something far different is there from the start and not resolved until the final moments of the film. Its a gripping story that draws you in and holds your interest throughout.

This not just the result of the story but also of the involvement of the actors on screen. Byrne does a fantastic job as Kiernan, playing him as a skeptical priest who one would think in that occupation should be the least skeptical person in the room. As a man of science he seeks proof where faith is usually found. It is through his eyes that we draw our own faith as well. As Frankie a young Arquette does a great job showing a woman in fear for her life while discovering a world she has no inkling of.

The result of this combination of story, crafted storytelling seen in the visuals and cinematography and in the acting combine to make an incredibly interesting story that will possibly renew faith for many viewers. Shout Factory once again offers a fantastic transfer of the film as well as numerous extras that include an audio commentary track by director Rupert Wainwright, a music video, featurettes, theatrical trailer and deleted scenes. If you loved the movie this is the version to own. If youve never seen it, its one worth watching. In troubled time like we live in perhaps a movie that renews faith is just what we need.",1436313600,,5783,4.579710144927536

But if you're looking for the cover art that Amazon shows for this, you'll need to look elsewhere.  They've re-issued this DVD with different front/back cover art, and in an eco case, kinda p*ssed me off when it arrived and it wasn't what I'd purchased (please see my 2 re-issue ""Customer Images"" to see what you'll actually get).  Not too bad but not the original covers, and I swapped the eco case for a real keep case.  All in all a good movie, and as long as you can get past the re-issued package, you'll be happy you bought this.

Granted, its and older film now and we, as a society, seem to have become desensitized to this type of horror, generally speaking.

However, I would not put it on par with the psychological horror that exists in INSIDIUS, THE OMEN (original) or the recent DELIVER US FROM EVIL. And Let alone THE CONJURING.

1062882,2,6305718903,"The Plot

  This movie revolves around the discovery of the Gospel of Thomas in 1945. The Vatican assigned three men to translate it. When it was discovered that the message of the book would undermine the authority of the Roman Catholic Church, the project was aborted. Two of the men refused to give it up and were excommunicated; the third became a Vatican bureaucrat.
  The movie opens at the death of one of the two men in San Paulo, Brazil. Although he had died, a statute of the Virgin Mary was bleeding in the sanctuary where he had served as priest (not a Roman Catholic parish). A Vatican investigator discovered it and learned it was human blood. While his investigation is ongoing, a woman traveling in Brazil buys the rosary of the dead priest in an open market. She mails it to her daughter in America, along with other souvenirs. Almost immediately the daughter, who does not believe in God, begins to have unusual experiences.
  Although she is immoral, she begins to experience bleeding in her wrists, which later include bleeding on her feet, as well. This phenomenon creates enough publicity that the Vatican sends the same investigator. He initially concludes that it cannot be a legitimate case of stigmata, because this phenomenon always happens to devout people. However, over the course of time he sees enough that it makes a believer out of him.
  The girl has experiences which seem more like cases of possession. A male voice speaks through her in another language and she writes on the wall in a form of Aramaic. The investigator sends pictures of all this to the Vatican. The message is from the Gospel of Thomas.
  Ultimately, the Roman Catholic Church tries to kill the girl, but the investigator rescues her. He returns back to the Brazilian church and discovers a translated copy of the Gospel of Thomas hidden in the church by the old priest before he died. The movie ends with a very obvious attempt to connect the girl to St Francis of Assisi. Then text appears on the screen informing the viewer that the Gospel of Thomas was discovered in 1945 and that the Vatican had declared it to be heresy. It was intended to raise questions in the viewers mind concerning the motives of the Roman Catholic Church in banning the Gospel of Thomas.

The Message

  The message of the film is that the messenger is not important, only the message. Although the girl uses profanity, attempts to seduce the priest, and does not believe in God, her message is that the Gospel of Thomas is authentic. The reason we know her message is true is because of the stigmata associated with her. Underlying all this is the current mind set which encourages spirituality, but not through organized religion.
  Since the purpose of the movie is to draw attention to the Gospel of Thomas, we must examine the message of that book. Why would Hollywood be so interested in promoting this book? The liberal Jesus Seminar treats it as the fifth gospel. This movie portrays it as the only gospel Jesus wrote and as more accurate than the other accounts. Ironically, a generation which has little knowledge of the four gospels may get excited about this new ""gospel.""
  Liberal scholars show great excitement over this discovery for the following reasons:
  1. Their faith in the Bible, and specifically in the four gospels, has been destroyed through higher criticism -- especially source criticism, form criticism, and redaction criticism. In the movie, one Vatican authority explained, ""We're all blind men in a dark cave looking for a candle which was lit 2000 year ago."" In other words, the information in the Bible cannot be trusted to be accurate. But the priest begins praying again after being convinced of the authenticity of the Gospel of Thomas. He admitted he had not prayed for a long time. The message is clear. We can believe the Gospel of Thomas, even if we cannot accept the Bible.
  2. They tend to believe that the New Testament canon of Scripture is not closed, but that God will continue to give new revelation.
  3. This belief in an open canon is sometimes based upon a misunderstanding of progressive revelation. While God did reveal himself progressively, the canon is closed because the faith was once for all delivered to the saints (Jude 3). There were no more apostles by AD 100, since an apostle had to be an eyewitness to Jesus Christ. Therefore the office of an apostle terminated along with the revelatory gift through which the Holy Spirit inspired the apostles to write the Word of God. The Church never accepted apocraphical [secret] or pseudepigraphal [falsely ascribed] books because the messenger and the message are important. A book written under a false name, usually an apostle's name to give it apostolic authority, could not be from God because it is based upon deception. There were no serious attempts to add books to the canon until the Roman Catholic Council of Trent in 1546, which had its own ulterior motives. They added the apocraphical books at the Council of Trent in 1546 because they needed some basis for their teaching on purgatory. They added 13 books which fit between the Old and New Testament. However, there are about 50 gospels which are falsely ascribed to an apostle; The Gospel of Thomas would be one of this 50.
  The Gospel of Thomas was not written by the apostle Thomas, but is dated about AD 140. But part of the theme of the movie is that the messenger is not important. In other words, it is not important how this book got here; just accept it. Ironically, it has not been subjected to the same criticism that the Bible has received.
  Jesus did not write The Gospel of Thomas, since he left this world in AD 30. Jesus did not write anything, but he is the Living Word of God. Everything in the written Word of God points to him. The genre of a ""gospel"" is defined as an eyewitness narrative written so that the reader would believe on Jesus Christ. Actually, the Gospel of Thomas cannot be called a ""gospel"" because it contains no narrative. It contains 114 parables, proverbs and other saying attributed to Jesus. While it contains some saying which are also found in other gospels, it does not call Jesus ""Christ,"" ""Lord,"" or ""Savior."" It does not mention his death or his resurrection. The book is considered to be gnostic literature.
  While it would be good news if more information about Jesus had been discovered, we would expect any legitimate source to correspond, and not contradict what we have already been told. It would also be very important to establish who the author was. Was he an eyewitness or were these oral traditions passed on for generations and therefore subject to distortion?
  But the question must also be raised, why was this information withheld from Christians for 1800 years? And why is it now coming forth? The doctrine of progressive revelation would explain why those before Christ did not have a complete understanding of the Messiah, but since our faith under the new covenant is specifically in the person and work of Jesus Christ, why would vital information be withheld after his advent? It reminds me of an unknown will suddenly produced at the time of an estate settlement.
  In an age where skepticism has destroyed faith in the Jesus Christ who was revealed in the Bible, the Gospel of Thomas fits well with the modern mind set. Jesus was a teacher; nothing more. The one quote from the Gospel of Thomas that was repeated several times throughout the movie was, ""The kingdom of God is within you and among you."" Another translation puts it, ""The kingdom is inside of you and it is outside of you."" This statement could be interpreted to mean that all we have to do is recognize the kingdom. In other words, salvation is enlightenment, which is a gnostic concept. The so-called ""new age"" teaching is actually a recycling of ancient gnosticism.
Luke 17:21 makes a statement which sounds similar. ""The kingdom of God is within you."" It has been debated whether should be translated ""within"" or ""among."" The emphasis is not that the kingdom is essentially inward, but that the kingdom is among them in the person of the king. Since Jesus was speaking to unbelieving Pharisees, the kingdom could not have been within them. Insight concerning the kingdom is not based on observation (v 20) or speculation, but is based on the presence of Christ. The kingdom may not be spectacular, but its influence is visible.
The interpretation given throughout the movie is that spirituality is a personal matter, not organized religion. But the kingdom of God is not within all humanity. Only those who are born again are in the kingdom of God (John 3:5).

What about the stigmata?

  The authentication of the message in the movie is the stigmata. This word is used in Galatians 6:17 where Paul says he bears in his body the marks [stigmata] of Jesus. This is the only place this word is used in Scripture. Does it mean that Paul bore the nail prints, foot prints, and wound in his side, just like Christ? Or is Paul making a comparison between the sufferings of Christ and his own sufferings as an apostle for Christ? Although Paul had a thorn in the flesh (2 Cor 12:7) and did endure physical affliction (2 Cor 11:24-27), there is no record that he actually received the same wounds as did Christ.
  There is no record that anyone did until the case of Francis of Assisi in the 13th century. McClintock and Strong, writing in their Cyclopedia between 1867-1887 concluded that cases of stigmatization have occurred, yet rarely outside the Roman Catholic Church. It is a stroke of genius that the screen writers use a Roman Catholic phenomenon to discredit the authority of the Roman Catholic Church. Yet their previous movie credits include predominately horror and occult-type films. This hardly qualifies them as theologians. Their concept of God seems to include a mixture of both good and evil. The unnecessary violence in this film earned it an ""R rating.
  In this discussion it must be emphasized that the five wounds received by Christ in his passion were substitutionary. He suffered for us. In no sense can it be suggested that anyone, including Francis of Assisi, suffered on our behalf. At best, the stigmata only witness to the unique suffering of Christ. I think stigmatization tends to occur among Roman Catholic mystics because of their emphasis on his passion. The Catholic crucifix portrays Christ on the cross, but he is no longer suffering on a cross. He is reigning on a throne. Therefore, our identity with him is better portrayed as communion with him through prayer.
  I am also concerned that the stigmata becomes an apologetic for the faith. Charismatics, with their emphasis on signs and wonders, also use physical manifestations as proof of spiritual realities. But the evidence of the Holy Spirit is holy living and the greatest witness to the atoning work of Christ is a transformed character, not some bleeding palm.
  And yet this brings us to the greatest weakness of the film. The screen writers use the historical phenomenon of stigmata as a basis for this fictional account and the purpose of this fictional account is to prove the validity of the Gospel of Thomas. The phenomenon of stigmata and the authenticity of the Gospel of Thomas are two unrelated subjects which are only brought together in this film. Even if we accept that the phenomenon of stigmata has occurred, we have not proven anything about the Gospel of Thomas.

The dilemma of half truths

  As a Protestant I do not accept the papacy nor the exclusive claim of authority made by the Roman Catholic Church. However, I can accept such Catholic mystics as Francis of Assisi as true followers of Christ. Their devotion does not validate the papal system, however.
  But the message of the film seems to advocate a personal spirituality that is not connected organizationally. This is a false dilemma. My faith need not either be reduced to the institution of Roman Catholicism or personal mysticism. The means of grace includes participation in a local assembly of Christian believers.
  While the message is more important than the messenger, again this is a half truth. It does matter how the message arrived and through what channels it came. It does seem, however, in the movie that the girl is transformed into a saint through the process of bearing the message. There is an element of truth here. Handling the Word of God should transform the messenger. Yet she never repents of her sin, renounces her atheism, nor confesses faith in Jesus Christ.
  Again, while this movie acknowledges the existence of God, he is a capricious god who can inflict pain because he is god. Nothing of his goodness, his grace, nor his love comes through.
  A fourth dilemma is that while the Gospel of Thomas does verify the historicity of Jesus Christ, it redefines him as just a man. Ironically, many who are the most open to a new revelation from God seem to have rejected the established revelation of Scripture. According to 2 Thess 2:9-12 they are wide open to deception.
  Therefore I do not accept either the authority of the Roman Catholic Church or the authenticity of the Gospel of Thomas. While the movie is actually a search for spiritual reality, it only gives two options -- the institutionalism of Roman Catholicism or the mysticism of The Gospel of Thomas.
  Other options in the search for spirituality is a return to the tradition of the Orthodox Church, which split from Rome in AD 1054. My opinion is that they are as corrupt as Rome, but their saints are also worth reading. John Wesley reprinted 50 volumes of these saints and mystics called The Christian Library. He included both Catholic and Orthodox writers.
  A fourth option, which I am more interested in, is the movement led by Thomas Oden to discover the consensus of Christian thought for the first 500 years. Oden is producing the Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture in 27 volumes. He would not advocate adding new books to the biblical canon, but would make available the earliest Christian interpretations on the Bible. He has also produced a 3-volume theology based upon what the early Church taught. He and I would both conclude, I think, that historic Methodism was a revival of apostolic Christianity.
  A spiritual revival is coming, but it must be a balance between the emotional, the intellectual, and the ethical. Most movements only have part of the equation. It must transform the head, the heart, and the hands. We must be scholars, mystics, and activists.",1381795200,3,14559,4.7972

1062970,3,6305718903,"""The Exorcist"" had a huge impact in Film. It was no cheap outing. Yes. It was high powered for the time. Nothing like that had been done before and it caught many off guard. But it had a good script, good performances, a good subtext and William Friedkin at the the helm. So, of course, many chased it trying to achieve that level of expertise and success. This might have been closer than many, but, for my dollar, it still came up short.

Here's the scoop. Patricia Arquette plays Frankie Paige. She's a beautician in Philly who begins to experience odd events including classic symptoms of stigmata. Father Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne) works for the Vatican as an investigator or these sorts of phenomenon. He's put on the case and wants to dismiss it because Arquette is an atheist, and atheists don't experience stigmata. Odd things pile up and he begins to change his mind.

I found this all to be overwrought. In ""The Exorcist"", as intense as things got, it all hung together and effected the viewer at a deep level. Part of that might have been the late 60s, 'the world is changing', subtext. But it had great gravity. Here I got the impression the director, Rupert Wainright, was just trying too hard. He really went after it and that might be the problem. Everything was just too. And Patricia Arquette, even though she'd been in the biz for awhile didn't work for me. With the exception of a couple of scenes, I don't feel as though she found the right notes. I like Gabriel Byrne and he doesn't disappoint here. Jonathan Pryce, as Cardinal Houseman, was also good. He exemplified the self righteous and corrupt posture of the Vatican in its wanting to squash anything that might chip away at its position of power.

This isn't a bad watch by any means. It moves at a fair clip and has a good Hollywood sheen on it. I just couldn't get past what it was trying to be. It had no authority in its own right.",1369008000,,1917,4.502873563218391

1063077,4,6305718903,"I've recently asked people from the Religion and Christianity Forum here on Amazon what were their views on horror movies. I've always been curious to know what they think about demons, angels and demonic possessions and the way they are depicted in horror movies. At first, i thought that stupidity, non-sense  and heresy would be the main comments i would get in regards to horror but i was far from the truth. A few people indeed admitted that horror was nothing more than non-sense for them but a majority of them actually liked the genre and the movies for what it is. We had an interesting discussion about it and i was surprised to see that yes, some of those movies were indeed able to bring a little message of faith across  people who never really had a opinion on it, but mostly, those movies were also seen and praised for entertainment purposes, basically just to have a good time, like everybody else. STIGMATA was one of those movies, it was raw, scary, entertaining and at the same time carrying a very strong message of faith..

Stigmata was not a big Hollywood production movie, i never consider it like that, it was simple and straight to the point. No big Hollywood stars, no crazy special effect, just a good story with punch. I would consider it as ""Religious Horror"", so as any movies involving demonic possessions and exorcisms.  It is the story of Frankie Paige, a young atheist who seemed to have received what is consider as ""Stigmata"", marks and sores corresponding to the crucifixion wounds of Jesus Christ. Father Andrew Kiernan will help Frankie figure this out and find out why these things are happening to her. It appears Frankie might be holding the key to what would appear to be a gospel in the exact words of Jesus Christ (The Gospel of Thomas). Father Kiernan will have to get to the bottom of this, eluding a conspiracy to keep this gospel from coming out.

Definitely recommend it to any religious horror fans. A good movie with a strong message! And remember, Jesus said... the Kingdom of God is inside you, and all around you, not in mansions of wood and stone. Split a piece of wood... and I am there, lift a stone... and you will find me.

1063078,3,6305718903,"what really kills me is during the last credits the ""big lie"" is put out there once again.  it comes in many forms.  this time it's the so called 'gospel of thomas'. it is like MANY other 1st and 2nd century gnostic belief systems that were condemned by the early church fathers and correctly so.  it (the gospel of thomas) essentially promulgates and encourages the idea that an individual Christian 'leader' of a specific sect has the ability to gain insights or enlightments that can exceed or go beyond Christ's teachings.  so you have people walking around claiming they knew what Jesus REALLY meant, 'cause they saw it in a dream, etc.  like 'god was a simpleton and created the universe badly' kind of nursery material.  that's actually one of the beliefs that one such 'christian' group had.  and to imply the church, i.e. evil greedy individuals who have power over people and won't give it up (by belief in the 'sayings of jesus' per the 'gospel of thomas' or other apocryphal materials) is a BIG LIE.  the church has always (especially in the early days when the Apostles and disciple of Jesus were still living) ASK them if said information agreed with what Jesus told them or they heard him say, was how many things were decided.  Christ did not leave a book behind when he rose from the dead, but He DID leave an 'institution'(the horror!)of people consisting of his 12 Apostles and His following.  so smoke on that, producers of the 'stigmata'.  otherwise a 'just above' middle rated horror movie that can be entertaining.",1342656000,3,1537,4.719101123595506

The music in was bad, the club music should've stayed in the club scenes. It would've benefited from a better soundtrack.

Overall, its creepy and has some great scares, but I wasn't a big fan of the acting. I recommend checking it out, at least a rental. As of 7/9/12, Stigmata is available on Netflix Streaming (the subtitles when they spoke in foreign languages was cut off during my stream.)

If you have never been to Sunday School and do not have any background in the Bible, etc., you will have no trouble enjoying this movie. However, I could not help but get distracted by some of the unequivocally real-world false statements made by some of the characters. Like Jesus of Nazareth was killed by a spear or that Jesus did not give any structure or ceremony to his disciples. Or that there are fifteen gospels. There are actually four gospels and generally the rest are Gnostic gospels, like the Gospel of Thomas mentioned at the end of the movie. These Gnostic gospels were rejected because they were not written by any apostles nor by anyone associated with the apostles, and they were clearly based on Gnosticism and not the teachings of Jesus.

1063171,5,6305718903,"I saw this film years ago when it was first released and enjoyed it. I saw it again recently and enjoyed it even more the second time around. I had forgotten that the film was based upon the Gospel according to St. Thomas, a gospel that is not recognized by the Roman Catholic Church and is not included in the New Testament. The Gospel according to Thomas is not about the life of Jesus. Rather, it is about the things that Jesus said. There are one hundred and fourteen such sayings that have been translated. One of those sayings is at the heart of this film. ""Split a piece of wood, and I am there. Lift up a stone and you will find me.""

The film is about an investigative Jesuit  priest, a young atheist who suffers from the stigmata, and a conspiracy within the Roman Catholic Church to suppress a certain gospel, as if fears its destruction should that gospel become public. The investigative priest, Father Andrew Kiernan, is played with appropriate gravity by Gabriel Byrne, a serious man with a faith issue, as he is not just a man of the cloth, he is also a scientist with a degree in chemistry. He travels around the world investigating alleged miracles. The young atheist suffering from Stigmata is Frankie, a twenty-three year old hairdresser played with great sincerity by a young and nubile Patricia Arquette. Cardinal Houseman, the politically savvy church official seeking to suppress the perfidy of the Church, is played with zealous determination by Jonathan Pryce.

I loved everything about this film. While there are elements of horror intertwined with its underlying intellectual theme, these two odd bedfellows merely make the film more interesting. I certainly did not find the juxtaposition of these two elements incompatible. The special effects do not overwhelm the film, but, instead, serve to enhance the experience of the viewer in understanding the film's themes and message.

1063227,4,6305718903,"I give STIGMATA 4 stars for the quality of the acting.  The film itself could have been so much more than it is.  All the ingredients are there.  For those who want to automatically call it an EXORCIST rip off, it certainly is not.  The story is very different and fully based on the presence of the stigmata.

The story is original, believable and much effort is put into the special effects.  But the script does not totally flow and the scares and suspense just aren't really there.  Maybe it is overproduced.  Again, the acting is superb.  patricia Arquette has an acting tour de force as Frankie, the young woman who is stricken by the stigmata as is Gabriel Byrne as Father Kiernan the investigative priest sent to study her.  They also play very well off each other.  Also, each scene in which she is stricken by another sign of the stigmata is very efefectively shown.

But all the other pieces just don't mesh.  I think the producers and writers took on too much and didn't give the movie and storyline the dedication it deserved.  It is certainly not a bad movie and has some of the best acting you will ever see.  But Patricia Arquette and Gabriel Byrne are certainly let down by the material they are given.  They carry it as best they can.

Had this film been handled more carefully it could have become a very important, popular film with a message that put it in the same genre as THE EXORCIST but kept it a standout film in its own right.  People see the clips etc. and think its just another film about a possessed girl.  This is so not true and sadly the opportunity to tell the story well is wasted as is the excellent acting.  But believe me, allow yourself to watch it just for that - the acting -  and Patricia Arquette in particular will blow you away.",1222732800,,1775,4.4
1063228,3,6305718903,"Stigmata isn't painful, but it does have the stigma of not being very good. It is a horror film but in this case the monster that terrorizes our young protagonist is Jesus Christ--or someone carrying a message from him. It compares to The Exorcist and The DaVinci Code, but is not as good as either. By straddling the two genres of horror and dramatic Vatican thriller, it succeeds at neither. The stigmata scenes aren't scary and they overuse sloppy special effects. Why is there always water dripping, and why does Frankie Paige, a hairdresser in Pittsburgh, always smell flowers whenever she is having an episode? And how do two hairdressers living together afford such a large albeit somewhat scummy but artfully decorated loft?

The film is based on an interesting premise, that the Vatican is suppressing certain gospels that have turned up by Peter, Mary Magdalene and even Judas. This plot pivots around one written by Thomas--and such a text does exist though its veracity is questioned. The film, however, is a little sloppy with the details, claiming it was written in Aramaic, a language spoken in Jesus' day, but it is actually in Coptic, an ancient Egyptian language based on the Greek alphabet. Here is a quote from Stigmata that was taken from The Gospel of Thomas, verse 77:

-------------------------
[Frankie is possessed by Father Alameida]
Frankie: Jesus said... the Kingdom of God is inside you, and all around you, not in mansions of wood and stone. Split a piece of wood... and I am there, lift a stone... and you will find me.
-------------------------

At one point our stigmatized hairdresser ostensibly writes Aramaic on the walls of her loft, but the director actually had her write in ancient Hebrew because he thought it looked cooler. But I quibble. I am not sure if, as Father Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne) claims, that St Francis of Assisi was the first to receive stigmata, but I have a whole pack of fact checkers working on it and you will be the first to know should they unearth any verification. Another interesting factoid gleaned from Father Kiernan was that the nails in a crucifixion actually go through the wrists, because palms couldn't support the weight. This is in spite of all the crucifixes you see showing the nail through the palm. Another Vatican cover up?

Though not a great film, it is at least mildly entertaining, with performances by Patricia Arquette as Frankie Paige--the stigmatized hair dresser, Gabriel Byrne, Enrico Colantoni as Father Dario, and Jonathan Pryce as the sinister Cardinal Daniel Houseman.

Patricia's character, Frankie, for short, is named Francis, and this is an allusion to St. Francis of Assisi, the first person believed to be stigmatized. Patricia is younger sister to Rosanna Arquette, and also a sister to David Arquette, and therefore is sister-in-law to Courtney Cox. She is also the grand daughter of star of stage and screen, Cliff Arquette, best known for the character 'Charlie Weaver' that he created for the Jack Paar Show. An interesting bit of Patricia trivia is that Tom Waits' wife called Patricia a Bonsai Aphrodite, and Tom used that line in the song ""Black Market Baby"" from The Mule Variations. She is quite the Bonsai Aphrodite, though I didn't recognize her at first, but upon further investigation I found that she played the medium, Allison Dubois, on the TV program: Medium.

-------------------------
[Frankie is possessed by Father Alameida]
Father Andrew Kiernan: Frankie? Frankie... who are you?
Frankie: The messenger is not important.
-------------------------

If, as Marshall McLuhan posits, The Medium is the Message, and the messenger is not important, what does that portend?

Other Patricia Arquette film credits include Ed Wood, with Johnny Depp; Little Nicky, with Adam Sandler; a dual role in Lost Highway, directed by David Lynch; and finally, she played Linda Loveless opposite Charlie Sheen, who (in quite a stretch) portrayed Chuck Traynor, in Deeper Than Deep. Though Stigmata is not her best work, she at least had the best line:

-------------------------
Dr. Reston: And are there any problems with a significant other?
Frankie: Yes...
Dr. Reston: Which is?
Frankie: I'm not very significant.
-------------------------

This could serve as the film's epitaph.

Gabriel Byrne was the priest who investigates miracles and debunks them with science. Byrne is from Dublin, and his slight bit o' brogue didn't seem out of place on a Catholic Priest. I last recall seeing him in Little Women with Winona Ryder, but he also played Byron in Gothic, and was one of the usual suspects in The Usual Suspects. In 1999, besides Stigmata, Byrne was also in The End Days. Both performances earned him Razzies for worst supporting actor, but Stigmata also won him a best supporting actor award--but it was from Blockbuster.

Jonathan Pryce is probably now best known for playing Governor Weatherbee Swann from The Pirates of the Caribbean. I liked his off beat brother-in-law Norman in The Rachel Papers far better. Other notable films worth the Pryce were Brazil, Glengarry Glen Ross, and De-Lovely. De-Lovely was a bio pic of Cole Porter starring Kevin Kline, and Pryce's character Gabe sang Porter's ""Blow, Gabriel, Blow."" However, as the embodiment of Vatican corruption and cover-up in Stigmata, he didn't really measure up to my expectations.

-------------------------
Cardinal Daniel Houseman: [while trying to strangle Frankie] I'll not let you destroy my church!
-------------------------

Not buying it, Pryce!

Enrico Colantoni might be familiar to you from Just Shoot Me! where he played the photographer, or from Veronica Mars where he played Veronica's father, a former cop turned private eye. Now he is playing a SWAT cop on a new show, Flashpoint, but we will see if that isn't just another flash-in-the-pan.

According to the credits, Portia de Rossi played Jennifer Kelliho in Stigmata, but I would have to watch it again to see who she was and how she does. Portia has also had her most successful roles on television, notably as ""Ice Queen"" lawyer Nell Porter on Ally McBeal, Lindsay Bluth Fnke on Arrested Development, and Olivia Lord on Nip/Tuck. By the way, Portia married Ellen DeGeneres on August 16, 2008 at Ellen's house in Beverly Hills, California attended by Ellen's mother and her mother. I wonder who caught Portia's garter?

If you like this kind of pretentious garbage conjuring up images that lack any meaning then this film is for you! The film itself does offer an interesting take on church politics (that's why I didn't give it a 1) which has definitely picked up steam as a sub-genre thanks to ""The Da Vinci Code"", but it loses itself in a war of stylistic nonsense over substance. The cinematography is great, freeze any frame in the film and you'll have an amazing photo but if you cut out most of the emphasis on the rain, dripping ceiling, never ending array of lit candles, car lights cutting through the dark you'd have a much shorter, straight to the point film. I didn't hate all of this, as a matter of fact it did add to the story in a grimy, uncomfortable way (the heavy clothes she wears looks like a burden on her) however, the filmmakers rely so much on it that it becomes a sensory overload that's not worth the payoff.

Both Burne and Arquette were wonderful in this, and the visual images were arresting and beautiful. (The flashes of images of crucifixion made religious stories so much more real to me than dunking one's head in a bucket o' blood, like Some Other Movies have done.) But I found the point of the movie to be thrilling, and it instigated in me a lot of new thought and hope.

I was so glad to see how many other people have questioned religion without giving up faith -- or the quest for truth. I had heard of the Nag Hammadi Gospels, but didn't really know what they were. This was a lovely way to introduce me to them, and it inspired me to check them out.

The teachings of the man who threw the moneychangers out of the temple, who came to tell people that there's more to religion than sacrificing a pigeon, have been turned into another monstrous institution that crushes people under the wheels of its machinery. This film dares to question what this Religion has become, and to invite people to hear the words of a simple rabbi in Galilee, who -- far from owning the world's most expensive real estate -- owned nothing more than the clothes on his back.

1063278,4,6305718903,"It is amazing to see the amount of time, energy, mental fuel that is in vain consumed to build and rebuild the plot theory that says the Catholic Church has hijacked Jesus Christ from a gospel of love to a gospel of domination and control. This film is one more stone along that road. It is an incredible story, meaning a story that cannot be believed, just as if when dealing with the Christian god there were no limits whatsoever as for the lack of any logic or reason. The haunting of a non believer by an Aramaic document that she has never seen, what's more understood, to the point of getting the victim of the reproduction  in her flesh of Jesus' stigmata and her writing on a wall the full text of the document still in Aramaic is unbelievable. A human being can only be haunted by something that has had a concrete connection or contact with that person. It is not the beads of a dead priest from Brazil, stolen by some non identified local person, bought by the mother of the victim in the village, who at least visited the place where that dead priest used to preach, and received via mail by the victim from her mother, that can justify that haunting of that person. Then the contradictory discourse of a priest who is originally a scientist and who turns a believer in empathy more than reason for the girl justifies in his blindness the extreme defensive attitude of the hierarchy of the church that prefers killing the evidence to accepting the disturbing truth, if truth it is.

1063279,1,6305718903,"This movie was comical as to both content and production.  Yet, the producers brazenly add a concluding unscientific postscript about the gospel of Thomas discovered in 1945.  This movie overdid the trashed apartment theme a la Blake Edwards of Pink Panther lore.  The male voice coming from the woman probably sealed the priest's vow to remain celabite.  The supernatural power in the woman that trashed the New York subway train was apparently careless of the safety of the people on the subway, as well as reckless in disregard of the insurance claims.  The priests in this movie must have been modeled on the Anti Defamation League in their consummate fanaticism.  The one priest was fanatical, the other a borderline libertine.  Ironically, both appeal to the spirit of Hollywood and serve its purposes in giving credance to gnosticism by discrediting symbols of Christiandom.  However, in its ad hominem attacks, gnostic Hollywood stays free and clear from addressing any factual questions, such as the actual dating of the socalled gospel of Thomas.  If the ""kingdom of God lies within you,"" then why are people so selfish, greedy and rotten?  Gnostic Hollywood cannot answer this question.  What is brainwashing?  Who has that as their priority?  Brainwashing creates the appearance of appealing to the intellect while all the long censoring the person from contravening facts and arguments.  We don't hear both sides of the story in this film.  All we get is the classic informal fallacies of appeal to emotion and ad hominem attacks.  I hope the viewing public has enough self respect to pick up work written by Christian scholars who, unlike Hollywood, actually give you facts and information.

I recommend reading John A. T. Robinson's book ""Redating the New Testament,"" or F. F. Bruce's book ""The New Testament Documents: Are they Reliable,"" or Geisler and Nix's book ""Guide to the Bible.""  While the canonical books clearly share an ideological parlance, they also can be dated within a few years of Christ's crucifixion.  The gnostic texts don't have this merit.  Furthermore, the gnostic texts are in contradiction to the teachings of the canonical texts.",1154736000,4,2171,5.131054131054131

An investigative priest comes to figure out what's happening, and the two set out to discover what's happening, ultimately uncovering a big Vatican conspiracy.

The movie has a lot going for it, especially with an untypical character receiving the stigmata and the great cast it has built up (Patricia Arquette and Jonathan Pryce especially).  It also has Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins doing the score, but that apparent benefit is also one of the film's minor failings...  A score should undertone and strengthen a film's drama, but this movie with its excessive (and repetitive) fast-paced editing, directorial fat, and overfocus on the music makes it seem much more like an hour and a half long music video.

That's cool if you're wanting a music video.  However, I don't imagine many people approach this film from this direction.  I would have prefered more focus on the rest of the craft of the movie, but that's just me.

It's also slightly predictable in that not-good-predictable way.  There's one scene that seems kind of excessive but is foreshadowed earlier, though that doesn't mean it was necessary.  Overall the film just got too caught up with being some visual/musicy slamfest to slow down and think about what it was trying to do.

Many people go by what the critics say and Stigmata is living proof that you shouldn't, this is a very entertaining film so don't listen to everyone. And as you can see, the Amazon readers ""for the most part"" seem to enjoy the movie more than the big guys do. I've heard comments that ""people enjoyed the movie when it came to DVD moreso than they did when they watched it on the big screen. Why is this? I'm not really sure. Maybe it seems more like a made for ""TV Movie"" but I don't feel that is the case. It doesn't seem to be a ""cheaply"" made movie by any means and the actors are known. Nonetheless...

It's no Exoricst or Gone with The Wind, but Stigmata is fun and anyone that enjoys a tale about religion/horror movie in general, should give it a chance. Gabriel Burne (Father Andrew Kiernan) plays the role of the slash scientist/priest quite well. I always thought he was a wonderful actor. He also played Satan in End of Days and played a big role in ""Point of No Return"" with Bridgette Fonda. His wonderful acting skills are very well done. This great popcorn movie puts a stab into religion in general and some might be offended, but remember, it's just a movie!!! Once again, the Catholics are attacked, but it's all believeable and fun at the same time. Patrica Arquette does a substantial job as her role as a self admitting atheist who gets inflicted with the Stygmata. A simple hairdresser brought into the madness.

She kind of looks bored through some her scenes and she needs to show a little more emotion and spunk in my opinion, but ""Gabriel"" saves most of the scenes when they are both together. The movie takes a lot of it's general ideas from the Exorcist, same idea, just a different time and infliction only now with a twist.  I felt the movie is very suspenseful, clever, dramatic and the acting is very well done. This movie won't bring you any closer to God, that's not what it's trying to do, it's just trying to do something different and fun, and I think Stigmata succeeds! Buy it now if you haven't seen it.

Running Time:  103 minutes

Rated R for intense violent sequences, language and some sexuality.

Stigmata"" is a very strange film. It takes a real hit on Catholicism, and at times, religion in general. Obviously, ""Stigmata"" isn't a film for all audiences, people with strong religious beliefs, for instance, and is certainly not appropriate for younger viewers. The production has so many good qualities, it's a shame to ultimately conceive that the flaw that sunk the motion picture is not its story or characters, but the individual scenes themselves.  Director Rupert Wainwright succeeds in making a very intense, engrossing picture; however, ""Stigmata"" is a jigsaw puzzle in which there are many interestingly shaped and colorful pieces, but, unfortunately, they do not fit together to create a final piece of work.

The film opens with an acclaimed and dedicated Priest/scientist named Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel Bryne in a fine performance) investigating a bizarre occurrence in a Brazilian church where a religious statue bled from its eyes. After noticing a few unique things in this town, however, after he returns home to Cardinal Daniel Houseman (Jonathan Pryce), Kiernan pleads to be sent back to this area to investigate further, but his requests are suspiciously denied. ""Stigmata""; however, centers on a young atheist woman named Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette) lives an independent life in Pittsburgh where she is occupied as a hair stylist with her fellow coworkers, including close friend Donna (Nia Long).  Things drastically heat up for Frankie after she receives a rather significant gift from her mother who was shopping on vacation. This is an item from a salesperson off the streets whom himself stole from a dead Brazilian priest. Soon, Frankie begins to suffer violent, disturbing visions and appearing on her afterwards are wounds resembling the ones suffered by Christ, a symptom called the stigmata.

After more and more stigmata attacks are inflicted on Frankie, Kiernan is sent to Pittsburgh where he investigates. It is when Frankie explains to Kiernan that she does not believe in God when he then denies the occurring stigmata attacks on her. You see, usually the stigmata happens to deeply religious Catholics, and Frankie is anything but; on the other hand, never before has each one of the five stigmatic wounds taken place on one individual person, and by the time this film is over, guess how many Frankie will have suffered. ""Stigmata"" contains the kind of plot that I liked to experience; a deep, involved and revealing storyline that focuses on touchy subjects. The characters are lost in their dialogue, but if the audience buys the premise, they allow themselves to be sucked in the events that transpire. The person who I saw this movie with found the plot too absorbing for her, and I have a feeling that this is how the majority of an audience will feel, therefore, although it is a close call for me, I am not recommending the film. I do feel, however, that there is a group of individuals out there who, like I somewhat was able to do, will happen to enjoy this production for what it is worth. If the film fit together a bit more, I think there may have been much potential here. But in the end, ""Stigmata,"" gets lost in its controversial atmosphere and forgets that movies like this need explanation and a through-line, not brief grizzly scenes that repeat themselves over and over again.",1135814400,,3618,5.084317032040472

I find it absurd, contrived, and ultimately, weak.

It had a lot of potential, but chose the easier route with its love scenes and such. I have such a respect for writers who _don't_ have their main characters sleep together.

I would have been more gracious with my opinion of this movie if it hadn't been for the last ten seconds of it. The ultimate moment in this already tired Hollywood cliche came as the movie ended with somber text appearing, painting a final stroke in its story of a grand conspiracy against the Gospel Of Thomas. Such a heavy-handed attempt to give the preceding images a deeper meaning fails; it's misleading and inaccurate, and amounts little more than a weak potshot. Sadly, though, many people may be taken in by this trick.

Like a made-for-TV movie about ""True Stories"", this one should come with its own disclaimer: ""Based on an actual religion.""

Many will find this movie entertaining, but don't confuse style for substance.",1130716800,4,1030,4.731843575418995
1063340,5,6305718903,"...but don't be put off by the reviews of others who seem to have an axe to grind against this movie.

The synopsis is simple enough.  Frankie (Patricia Arquette), a 'trendy, hip' hairstylist suddenly receives the stigmata (apparently transferred to her from a rosery who used to belong to an excommunicated priest), and Father Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne) is sent from Rome to investigate.  Their relationship changes throughout the movie from simple aquaintence to falling slightly in love, to frustration and anger, to a relationship that may be best described as father/daughter; all while Father Kiernan is trying to solve the perplexing mystery as to why she has received the stigmata.  Eventually Father Kiernana figures out that he's being used as a pawn to silence the supernatural in an attempt to make the ""church"" rule supreme over personal faith - a faith described by the Gospel of St. Thomas.  The movie closes by mentioning in passing what the Gospel of Thomas allegedly is, and pointing out the fact that the Catholic Church has rejected it.

I have heard people complain that this is too much of just a montoge of scattered images, but i don't think that that's a fair criticism.  The movie does have more of a photographic feel to it, in that it reads like groupings of photographs about particular moments in the character's lives over a period of time - as opposed to a completely smooth, seamless film.  If more segmented filming isn't your thing, you probably won't like the way the filming of this movie is handled - don't buy it.

In my opinion, the imagery in the movie is quite breathtaking and very visually interesting.  Both main characters, Frankie and Father Keirnan, play opposite to the dramatic scenery; that is they're both really rather matter-of-fact down to earth; something other people have reviewed as 'boring.'  Watch for yourself and see if you like the mixture.

A couple words about the DVD.  First, as many people have mentioned, the DVD does come with an alternate ending, and I agree with DJD - watch it with the director's ending, which is much more powerful, and just makes more sense.  Second, I should mention the one thing that I don't like about the DVD's extras: you have no choice but to watch all of the deleted scenes if you want to see any of them.  It's not a big deal, but it'd be nice to see all the choices instead of having to watch them all to see them all.

On a final note, I have to say that although I really enjoyed the movie (my wife and I just bought it because we both liked it so much), it does have a theological bent that I disagree with.  Although I'm not Catholic (I graduated from a Protestant Seminary), I do agree with the Catholic church in deciding to not cannonize the Gospel of St. Thomas.  I agree that faith is personal and is not regulated by the Church, but the gospel of Thomas consists of more than ""The Kingdom of God is within you..."" etc. etc., (the section that was continually quoted in the movie).  By the time you get to the end of The Gospel of St. Thomas, you find that Jesus is saying all sorts of things that are out of line with the cannonized gospels, and that he's a male chauvinist; far from the Jesus who took time to love and care even for a woman caught in adultry (John 8:3-11).  So, it's a good film about the tensions behind the scenes in religious communities, but this movie certainly does have a bias about a truly questionable document.

Enjoy the movie!",1130112000,5,3466,4.5941558441558445

Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette) is a hard-living, hard-partying, wild hairdresser in Philadelphia.  After her globe-trotting, uncaring mother gives her a rosary she got at a small church in Brazil, Frankie begins hallucinating, and becoming injured.  The doctors think these wounds were self-inflicted.

Father Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne) is sent by the Vatican to investigate rumors of a woman with stigmata.  Kiernan is an investigator for the Catholic Church, documenting claims of bleeding statues and the like.  But Kiernan is frustrated when he realizes the Cardinal (Jonathan Pryce) only wants to put such rumours to bed, not to truly explore them.

Kiernan and Frankie become close, which angers the Cardinal. As she spends more time with Kiernan, her hallucinations turn into full-on possession.  Will Kiernan obey the Church, or defy it for a woman?

Stigmata really makes you think.  The end is not at all clear.  It merits much discussion as to was Father Kiernan right in the decision he made?  Who was the entity that possessed Frankie really after?  Was the entity angelic - or demonic?

Really a good movie.  Patricia Arquette gives a sincere and feral portrayal of a sinful woman trying to control everything in her, and around her, even when it is killing her.",1129939200,2,1501,5.090163934426229

First off, I found this movie to be terribly boring and the acting to be poor, notably by Patricia Arquette. I almost dozed off because of how boring it was. I swear tht it's got to be one of the most boring movies of all time.

Also, the scenes where Arquette suffers the wounds of Christ are strange and over dramatic. Oh, and then, like a couple hours later, she's fine. After she suffers Christ's wounds, she's fine. I mean, come on! She'd take a while to recuperate from it. She'd suffer pretty bad.

You don't like any of the characters, especially the character suffering stigmata, who on top of it has a man's name, Frankie.

But, the worst is the relationship between Father Kiernan and Frankie. They fall in love. I mean come on, that's idiotic! Seriously! The movie plays off other movies, copying off them basically and has many lame scenes, notably the lame and terrible ending.

This movie deals with an interesting topic, but doesn't go anywhere and instead is boring, pointless, lame and idiotic. This movie is one that everyone should run away from and hide from.",1123286400,2,1152,4.632352941176471

A rosary in Brazil is stolen from a corpse after a bizzare funeral takes place and is sold. That's where the whole plot starts. Next, Patricia Arquette's character begins experiencing cataclymic changes in her life that makes everyone think she is losing her mind. For example, she causes one huge destruction on a subway train while being beaten on her back repeatedly by an unseen force. She also gets bloody holes in her palms. The same thing happens 2 times and she is sent to the hospital 2 times, and a  bunch of other really strange stuff happens that she can't explain. My guess is because she said she isn't religious in this movie. Her character then writes  either latin or aramiac on the wall and, in another scene, shouts that language in a male voice. Every answer leads to another question and her only hope is an exorcism. It seems like another kind of ""Exorcist"" movie to me. If it sounds good to you, I recommend it. ""Stigmata"" also has great special effects for the genre. It's sort of a religious/ritualistic/pay-attention-to-the- plot/crime/thriller type of film, and yeah, it is pretty neat. 4 stars=Really good.

It might just make your imagination spin, and of course ""Stigmata"" intends to do just that -well, it works! (On me that is)

Fantastic picture, the same goes for the acting and the talented cast, Arquette and Byrne were as born for their parts -usually all movies contain one or more scenes that may irritate a little, something unecassary (even the movies that are your favorites) -but I find ""Stigmata"" complete.

Keep in mind when you see ""Stigmata"" that this is not a horror-movie, and I'd recommend you watch it with the alternate ending.

1063376,5,6305718903,"The movie did a commendable job in getting across what Jesus' message was to mankind:  That the ""church"" is all around you and more than a building, either fancy or plain, and a bureaucracy of men. A bureacracy that not only reads His Word to the flock but forms ""its"" opinion (not His) of what He intended us to learn from His coming and then in effect voices this opinion to the flock as  His Word.

I frequently ask myself this question when the organized religions, governments, etc.  take a position or action on some matter, be it war, be it same-sex marriage, be it ""Holy War"", be it the Crusades, be it the Inquisition,  etc. etc.: ""If Jesus were a man(or woman) and if He was here today, would He behave this way and want us to behave this way?""  The answer I always come to is ""NO"".  The Jesus I've read about is a loving and forgiving Diety - not a ""fire and brimstone Tyrant"" nor a ""picky benevolent Diety"". In today's world, He would be The Expert on Compassion, Forgiveness, Tolerance and everything Else that is good and right.

If the Stigmata and the Jesus Scriptures truly exist, then this will be a threat to most of the religious bureaucracies throughout the world. It will also be a threat to those governments and those leaders that proclaim their actions are in accordance with and necessary under ""Gods Laws"" and in accordance with ""Allah's wishes"" and all the other references to our Divine Creator to justify their positions and actions.

And, those institutions - be they a ""Church"" or a ""government"" or some ""other"" and the individuals who believe the ""word"" of those institutions, will not only find themselves subject to judgement the same as the rest of mankind, but they will also be subject to judgement on the consequences of their actions taken and in justifying their actions in the Name of The Father, Son, Holy Ghost, Jesus, Allah, and Others.",1106438400,4,1881,4.607784431137724

The story line was often confusing and there were many unnecesary scenes. An attempt at ""style"" is worth mentioning but the key word is ATTEMPT. There were times when you were amazed by the sheer beauty of a shot, but that was soon eclipsed by overpowering music, graphic violence or sporatic camera movement.

There were far too many holes in the plot, very few if any questions are ever answered. The ending does not succeed in passing it's message to the viewer. You feel virtually no sympathy for any of the characters and you even grow to hate them

1063378,3,6305718903,"British director Rupert Wainwright's ""Stigmata"" presents sharply clashing forces of good and evil in which petite blonde beauty Patricia Arquette, a professed atheist, is attacked by spiritual elements in the same manner that Linda Blair was so plagued in the seventies in ""The Exorcist.""

Gabriel Byrne, an Irish actor who initially gained fame on stage with Dublin's famous Abby Playhouse group, is an idealistic young priest working out of Rome's Vatican.  He had just investigated a case of stigmata, namely evidence of reopening the wounds Christ sustained on the cross at Calvary, in the case of a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary at a church in a small Brazilian town.  He observed the evidence of blood appearing in the appropriate places on the statue.

Byrne is stymied when his immediate superior, Jonathan Pryce, a cardinal stationed at the Vatican, dampens his enthusiasm and then sends him on to a case in Pittsburgh, which involved Arquette, whom he meets at her place of employment, a beauty parlor.  Initially he states his conviction that future investigation is unnecessary.  His reasoning is that in former cases of individuals bearing the stigmata, such as St. Francis of Assisi and, more recently, the Italian Catholic priest Padre Pio, were all devout believers.

Byrne and Arquette become strongly attracted to each other, and the priest concedes that he became a priest in later adulthood and had enjoyed conjugal relations before that point.  Eventually Pryce comes to Pittsburgh, and, behind Byrne's back, begins to perform an exorcism.  The drama heightens as does the clash between Byrne and Pryce over the direction of the Roman Catholic Church in regard to manifestations of stigmata and what they ultimately mean.

The camera work is brilliant, as are the special effects revealing Arquette's experiences, but considering the importance of the doctrinal clash being posed, the issues could have been better fleshed out in the script.",1105056000,,1966,5.212698412698413
1063379,5,6305718903,"This movie is one of my absolute favorites (and I've seen a lot of movies).  It is all about conflict - the conflict that Frankie experiences with the stigmata (fighting for her life, essentially), the conflict that Andrew faces within himself because of his attraction to Frankie and the vow that he took for the church, the conflict between authority and subordinates (the church's attempts to suppress information).  The film is beautifully directed with amazing angles, and a lot of work was put into production (view with director's commentary - he'll explain a lot in it).

The actors are also amazing - I am really impressed with Gabriel Byrne's portrayal of Father Kierning.  He is very expressive and is able to relay emotion without speaking, which is a great gift.  (And he's really easy on the eyes, too, lol.)  Patricia Arquette also is amazing - she makes Frankie a very strong woman and someone who isn't in the ""mainstream"" but who is very logical and intelligent.  Despite the bad rap that ravers get, most are thinkers, which I see in Frankie.  The supporting role by Nia Long is extremely well-done.  As the best friend, she brings to the role a caring person who's always by Frankie's side; she's concerned without being cheesy, which is a touch of realism that I'm glad was included in the movie.

The look of the film, the colors, the way that the film was processed (with ""skipping,"" which is explained on the DVD) also give it a dark yet light and ethereal look which I think was essential to making this movie work.

As far as the topics of the movie (because there is more than one), they are all thought-provoking and should be examined closely to really be absorbed.  If you like make-you-think movies, you will definitely love this movie.

The one beef I had with this DVD was the director's alternate ending.  I think that the theatrical ending is much better because it leaves more to the imagination.  The viewer can see the ending however he or she pleases; interpretation is at the hands of the viewer.  The movie itself however, is awesome, and had I been able to give it ten stars, I would've.  I cannot say how amazing I think this movie is (because I don't have the space, lol), but I just think that it's very worthy and deserving of 5 stars.

1063380,2,6305718903,"This movie was just dumb.  Anyone who know anything about stimatists knows that they don't experience what Frankie did in this movie (there are people today that receive the stimata). This was more like demonic possession than a gift from God.  The film lost me here... why would such a gift manifest itself in such a evil and demonic way?  Even if she was ""channeling"" the dead priest, was he not a holy man, and not the devil?

Also- I hate the way they portrayed the Catholic Church.  Are there really police in the Vatican library watching over the priests who are engaged in research, threatening them if they seem to be doing anything ""suspicious?"" Give me a break.  And for all the claims of the church subverting this ""dangerous"" document, it is widely available for all the read on the internet. Funny, the Church still exists in spite of that.  I read some of this ""gospel,"" and it reads alot like the Bible... I hardly see where saying ""The Kingdom of Heaven is within you and all around you"" is very scandalous..... Jesus told us that He lives within each of us, and His spirit is wherever 2 or more are gathered in His name.  It sounds alot like when Jesus told folks in the Bible that ""The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.""  Anyway.... it seems like just another Hollywood attack on the Catholic Church, which is used to such attacks, since it's the only Christian church that has been around since Jesus founded it himself (and promised that the Gates of Hell should not prevail against it.) In spite of all of these attacks by secular media, the Church will be here forever... and stronger for having endured.",1101945600,3,1622,4.546391752577319

I agree that this shouldn't be compared to The Exorcist. That original movie has I think more rawness to it, this movie is slick, stylistic, and extremely methodical.

1063428,4,6305718903,"This movie had a message that was so appealing to me it colored my perception of the film with favorable colors in spite of its ""horror movie"" parts. Maybe I am wrong, but I felt the movie wanted to say that ""god is everywhere"" and that human beings do not need someone to stand between them and god. My feelings about religion were always such that religion is supposed to bring happiness, comfort and support and not engage in war, conflicts and guilt or the acquisition of power.

Another reason for liking this movie was Patricia Arquett. She is so sweet, candid and fresh that her ""purity"" seems to come out of the screen. You do believe she was somehow ""chosen"" even if the necklace reached her hands by coincidence.

As for my criticism. This movie can be described as an horror/thriller. Frankie Page, a hairdresser is starting to hallucinate and have outbursts of acute pains, causing severe wounds in her body. These turn out to be very typical of a situation called Stigmata where strong believers in Christianity totally identify with the suffering of Jesus Christ.

An investigator, sent by the church to check on this case, is drawn to Frankie and keeps on inquiring her case in spite of the fact that she is no believer, a basic criteria for stigmata. As typical to thrillers, our investigator is alone without any help from outside sources. As usual the whole (Christian) world is against him. As usual our investigator arrives in the last moment to save the day. However, the movie, and especially its last part is filled with ""horror""/unnatural parts which were much too much for my taste. I liked the first part of the movie when we did not know yet what is true and what isn't and I was waiting for a logical explanation for everything we saw. I like to be on the thin line between reality and the unnatural, but this film moves towards the unreal in a very firm way. I could accept some ""miracles"", especially since the movie explains in such a beautiful way how people ""need"" the miracles and how such signs of god become the cornerstone of their belief, yet it was a little too much

I would like to add that the movie succeeded in presenting Jesus suffering in a way that makes him, so I felt, closer to any human being (this coming from a Jew) in the sense that one cannot remain indifferent to his suffering after ""feeling"" them together with Frankie.  I therefore felt that in spite of the presentation of the ""church"" in dark colors, the movie did not do any harm to the Christian faith.",1093737600,2,2515,4.5676274944567625

When released in 1999, there was a brief outcry from the Catholic church since this movie challenges basic tenets of Catholic faith & presents ""The Church"", it's internal workings & hierarchial church government in quite an unflattering light, to be sure.
The premise of the story is about an agnostic woman receiving stigmata & even more interesting, an intertwining story about a church cover up dealing with the Gospel Of John and the political maneuvering that works within all organizations, be it church or state.
Patricia Arquette as Gen X, ""rave"" generation hairstylist, Frankie, the tortured woman who receives ALL of the manifestations of the stigmata. That being two wrists, as opposed to the palms of the hands , two feet, crown of thorns, and the ""coup de grace"" being the spear through the side. Frankie also exhibits possession and lots of other ""Exorcist""-like manifestations.
Gabriel Byrne plays Father Keirnan, a young Jesuit priest-cum-white collared detective as he spans the globe investigating possible sainthood of the devout, weeping Mary statues, stigmata, demon possession and the like, all in the name of  the church and at his boss, Cardinal Daniel Houseman's (Jonathan Pryce) direction and discretion.
Fans of TV's Ally McBeal will recognize ""Nell""-Portia DeRossi in a supporting role as Frankie's fellow employee, Jennifer Kelliho, and Nia Long also has a part as Frankie's friend, Donna Chadway.
The soundtrack to Stigmata is most interesting. Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan and Mike Garson score the movie's music to create a perpetual sense of darkness, evilness, and general unease.
Remy Zero's ""Gramarye"", Chumbawamba's ""Mary Mary"", David Bowie charges up for ""The Pretty Things Are Going to Hell,"" a mechanical/NIN sounding song, Afro Celt System with ""Release."" Natalie Imbruglia and ""Identify"", ""Inertia Creeps"" by Massive Attack and the beautiful, ""All Is Full Of Love"", by the incomparable Bjork.
As a neat Catholic twist, during the final scene in the garden, the statue in the background is of St. Francis of Assisi- in the Catholic belief system, the first person to bear the marks of the stigmata...

1063435,3,6305718903,"A strange film, with a very interesting concept. If you're devoutly religious, then you'll know what the stigmata is. I've never heard of it, and I found I learned quite a lot - what the stigmata's are, where they appear etc. And finding out some cool trivia - every crucifix, whether on a necklace or in a church, is technically 'wrong'. Christ did not have the nails driven through his palms, cos the nails would just rip right through the flesh. Instead, the nails were driven through the wrists, which is more correct. And this is where the marks appear on Patricia Arquette.
Who, by the way, is a great actress! Apart from her, I could have seen Cate Blanchett in this role, but Patricia Arquette plays the part of Frankie almost too well. It's very realistic, and you have to remind yourself it's just a film.
The beginning credits have some very cool scenes, which is a quick look at what Frankie is like. Her life is full of clubbing, hairdressing, and guys. And she's in no way religious. Kinda obvious what's going to happen, considering the best part of the film is about religion.
Some of the scenes featuring flashbacks to the stigmatas/Christ are very realistic and too scary to watch. They happen very abruptly, and in the weirdest places, for no apparent reason. It's almost painful to watch Patricia Arquette act out receiving the stigmatas.
I found this film quite good, and learned a bit from it. You can die from having all 5 stigmatas - nails through feet & wrists, the crown of thorns, and finally, the fatal spear through the side. But watch from behind a cushion.",1071360000,2,1587,4.631205673758865

The acting is great, I enjoy Gabriel Byrne and his understated performance, he did well with a script that is cumbersome at times.  The film is beautifully shot, and the techniques used give it a surreal quality, while the editing definitely could have been better (I kinda liked the deleted scene of Alameida's suicide).
But to address some of the more foolish statements made...yes, some of the explanation process within the movie is a little simplistic but I hate to be the one to break this to you-not everyone is Catholic, not everyone went to catechism, I didn't but I was able to follow some of the dogma that is the foundation for the Catholic church.  When Frankie attempts to seduce Kiernan, it is because she is a) being influenced by Alameida, a devoutly religious man who suffered the stigmata and b) as it is explained, stigmatics suffer from demonic attacks and temptation because of their belief and faith.  Okay?
I won't defend every aspect of the movie, because although I really like this movie, no movie is ever perfect and up to everyone's standards.

While the story is flimsily entertaining, and the effects creative and almost overwhelming, the film and its message can barely hold itself together.  The acting is sufficient, so I have to blame the screenplay.
The basic premise is: a young woman - - who happens to be an atheist - - is stricken with stigmata (a condition where the wounds of Christ's crucifixion appear on a body) after receiving a religious item from a priest who has recently died.  The handsome, hip, priest who is assigned to investigate her case is then caught in the midst of Vatican politics fueled by Church self-preservationists.  The woman, meanwhile, goes through a very ""Exorcist""-like transformation.  There are some very dumbed-down plot points that you have to just swallow in order to stay with the story.  Does anyone today really not have any idea what a rosary is?  Especially anyone who lived through the late '80s - - and is familiar with Madonna, Cher, or any other of the myriad of celebrities who have rosaries tattoed to their bodies?  Does a priest, particularly a priest who is stationed out of the Vatican itself, really need to be explained about the variety of Gospels, where they came from, and why they vary?  Would a hospital really release a patient whom they believed just jammed a pointed object cleanly through both wrists?  Wouldn't they put you on suicide watch or something?  Especially after you keep coming back with other mysterious wounds and no logical explanation for them?  And the biggest farce of them all - - how does a hairdresser get medical insurance where her doctor immediately wants to implant neuro-sensors into her head to investigate the cause of her seizure-like problem?  I have a government job and I have to get an ungodly number of authorizations and referrals just to have a mole removed!
The best part of this movie is seeing Enrico Colantino, the guy who played Elliot the photographer from the tv series 'Just Shoot Me', in character as a Vatican toady with a thick Italian accent.
The problem with 'Stigmata' is most of the characters are utterly under-developed, as is the primary plot line, and the focus is placed on the special effects, including some not-so-dazzling attempts at utilizing symbolism.  I would have appreciated a more educated approach to learning about the so-called hidden gospel, and the attempts to get the Church to release the contents, with a little less possession sensationalism.",1061251200,4,2597,4.947004608294931
1063481,1,6305718903,"Borrow liberally from ""The Exorcist,"" employ cheap music video-style editing, and round up a handful of third-tier actors, and you've got ""Stigmata,"" an unscary and woefully stupid religious thriller.  The editorial review advises us not to dismiss this film as an ""Exorcist"" rip-off.  How can you not?  It mirrors that 1973 movie very closely, but unlike ""The Exorcist,"" ""Stigmata"" shows no concern for originality, vision, or a plausible script.  Patricia Arquette is a twentysomething atheist who gets mysterious wounds that are similar to those of Christ.  A priest gets called in to investigate the matter, and the two begin a journey that's far less interesting than what the movie promises to be.  Like most bad horror flicks, ""Stigmata"" labors to get scares from the audience through lots of blood, hyperactive editing, and other tired techniques.  But even if this film weren't such an ""Exorcist"" wannabe, you'd still be left with amateurish acting, a script riddled with holes, and the sight of Nia Long in purple extensions.  My advice?  Skip this dud altogether.

The cardinal sends the priest to explore these cases...yet is appalled when he tries to look deeper into them.. Stupid. They explain to the priest who wrote the Gospels (guess he was absent during that part of class)..In this day and age do many poeple still not know what a rosary is?

Gabriel Byrne plays Father Kiernan, a young Jesuit priest whose degree in chemistry makes him a sort of priest/detective as he investigates weeping Marys and the like around the world. Meanwhile, Frankie (Patricia Arquette), a rave-generation Pittsburgher, is afflicted with the stigmata--holes that appear in her wrists, resembling the wounds of Christ. The young woman's symptoms filter back to the Vatican and Father Kiernan is assigned to the case. The priest is puzzled by Frankie's atheism; usually the stigmata only appear on the devout (hence the age-old controversy of miracles vs. hysteria).

It is a story about faith, with stupendous performances by Gabriel Byrne (this man is amazing, and so expressive without ever saying a word or going over the top), Patricia Arquette, Rade Serbedzija and Jonathan Pryce (who gives a chilling performance). Rupert Wainwright does a great job directing this religious drama/thriller. His choice of camera angles and moves, as well as the special processing ('skip bleaching') of the film stock help add to the surrealness of the film. Rounding it out is an amazing score by three different artists--Billy Corgan (of the Smashing Pumpkins), Mike Garson (a world renouned pianist), and film composer Elia Cmiral. Together these artists have created a strong film.
The dvd contains a commentary track from the director, deleted scenes, Natalie Imbruglia's vidoe for ""Identify"", which Corgan and Garson wrote (and the video is filmed in an interesting way--it is worth watching, regardless of how you feel about the song).

1063486,4,6305718903,"I love this movie because it puts me in a very relaxing mood when I watch it. It reminds me of the ambient(Trip Hop Music) that I love so much. This movie has a very dark and gothic vibe too it which I feel is beautifully filmed. Patricia Arquette is one of the best at conveying quirky or unusual characters. For an hour and 47 mins, you are definitley in Frankie Page's world. I know that a lot of Christians will have a problem with the message that this film is trying to convey. And I think that is one of the reasons it didn't do as well as it should have. I love it because you rarely get a film that goes into a persons life style as this one did.
  ""Very Brief Plot to this Story!""
  Frankie Page (Patricia Arquette)is a beautiful alternative female that is d'void of faith. She is extremley egotistical, and very spoiled to some extent. She is possessed by a preacher that died before he could convey the pages that were hidden in the Bible. So basically she recieves the Stigmata because the preacher she is possessed by had it, and she is his messenger. Basically a self proclaimed atheist, recieves a quick lesson that God does exist. Now the whole stigmata is a gift thing,I don't quite understand? Also I don't understand why a Preacher would possess a womans body and act in such a belligerent manner? But anyway, the Church doesn't want this secret out and will do anything to protect it, Including homocide! See Patricia in ""Lost Highway -(Masterpiece) and Goodbye Lover"" another interesting experience. The soundtrack is very trippy and I recommend it as well. It features Bjork and Massive Attack as well as other interesting artist. Also if you are looking for another movie that has the same feel try ""Lost Souls"" starring Wynonia Ryder but don't expect much. ""Lost Souls"" is just Beautifully filmed and has a good gothic theme/mood to it. But I warn you Lost Souls isn't nearly as superior in plot as this film"".

1063487,5,6305718903,"This movie is probably the most thought provoking movie I have seen in quite while. In this movie, we have a completely hedonistic, nihilistic Patricia Arquette who denies God, while  Gabriel Byrne plays a scientist/priest who questions miracles and on some level questions his faith through his church, yet believes in God.
The cast does an outstanding job, and there are some excellent religious points made in the movie. Gabriel Byrne has a brief speech where he explains how science and the ""just happened"" theory in regards to life appearing on this planet has contradictions. Then, in another scene, an ex-priest talks of what and where the true church is to be found. Which, by the way, is very much correct, according to the Gospels.
The ending very much follows the religious theme of the movie and draws heavily from stories in the Bible where both doubters and unbelievers were given signs that convinces them of the existence of God.
I rate it worth owning, because the movie is worth seeing more than once. Again, another movie that had lousy reviews, and once again, the reviews were wrong.",1041033600,4,1104,4.872340425531915

This film received mixed reviews in the UK, some of them not too flattering, I am just so glad that I watched it regardless.  The soundtrack is wicked, so much so, I bought the CD.
Some people have taken this film as an affront to religion, I did not see it that way at all, on the contrary, the wounds of Christ that were appearing on the character in the film sent a thousand and one messages out to the viewer.
I have seen this film five times now and I know, that I will watch it again, thoroughly enjoyable with a very different storyline.

1063489,5,6305718903,"When I first saw the commercials back when Stigmata was released, I cringed at the thought of a ""Next Exorcist"". I avoided the film up until TBS finally broadcasted it earlier this year, and I was amazed by it.
If you go into the movie believing it's the ""Next Exorcist"" plot-wise, you will be horribly disappointed. The only ties between the two movies are the use and discussion of religion, religious beliefs, and figures, and possession itself. The experiences of both Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette) and the Exorcist's leading character, Reagan (Linda Blair) are drastically different. Whereas Reagan was possessed by a demonic spirit for cruel reasons of it's own, Frankie experiences an extremely different sort of possession. Frankie became possessed by the spirit of a recently deceased priest, Paolo Alameida.
Father Alameida, along with two other priests, had been working together to translate a document found near the site of the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in Jerusalem. The document is entirely in Aramaic - the language believed to be used during the time of Jesus. The three priests begin to believe that the words in this document are actually words spoken by the living Jesus Christ at the time of his last supper, telling his Disciples how to continue his church after his crucifixion.
Once word began to spread in the Catholic church about the gospel (and how damaging it's content would be to the church itself), the three priests were discommunicated and exiled, with Father Alameida relocating to Bel Quinto, Brazil, where he would head a church, and eventually commit suicide before the translation was finished.
After Frankie's mother (on vacation in Brazil at the time), sends her a rosary (that was actually stolen from the body of Father Alameida), Frankie begins experiencing wounds similar to those of Christ at the time of his crucifixion. After a priest witnesses Frankie receiving the wounds of the whip across her back in a subway, Father Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne) is sent to investigate the possible appearance of the stigmata, the wounds of Christ.
As Andrew's time with Frankie grows, she continues receiving more and more wounds, and finds herself speaking and writing in languages she does not understand - Italian...and Aramaic. Andrew actively works to bring the meanings of the words Frankie is speaking and writing to light, thus strengthening the tension between Andrew and the Catholic church, most notably Cardinal Houseman (Jonathan Pryce), who originally exiled the three priests working on the translation.
The movie shows the negative side of what happens when churches become dictatorships. As the meanings of the words spoken and written by Frankie, as well as the reasons behind (as well as who is responsible for) her possession become clearer to Andrew, the Catholic church tries harder and harder to silence Frankie and to continue making people believe that the church is continuing the faith as Christ wanted, regardless of whether or not a simple exorcism is done to cast out the spirit of Father Alameida to keep him from using Frankie to finish the translation...or by silencing Frankie herself.
The movie is a chilling representation of fanaticism and explores hidden aspects of religion and of possession, separating it from the Exorcist and the like.

1063522,4,6305718903,"""Stigmata"" is a thought provoking, if sometimes religiously confused, MTVesque journey through the possession/stigmata of Frankie Page (Patricia Arquette), a twentysomething atheist raver who suddenly exhibits stigmata (the wounds that Christ received on the cross) after receiving a recently deceased priest's rosary in the mail (her name, combined with later symbolism (the doves feeding from her hands, the statue of St. Francis in the garden), is an obvious nod to St. Francis of Assisi-one of the original working titles was ""St. Frankie of Pittsburgh""). However, director Rupert Wainwright appears fundamentally confused on basic issues, confusing stigmata (which appear to devout Christians) with possession (Frankie speaks in tongues, stabs herself, levitates, and scribbles in Aramaic on the walls).
Gabriel Byrne is fantastic (as usual) as Father Andrew Kiernan, an Irish organic chemist turned man of the cloth, who is sent around the globe to investigate bleeding statues and religious sightings. Frankie has an attack in the subway that is witnessed by a priest, and word filters down to the Vatican, where Father Kiernan is hastily reassigned after discovering an authentic bleeding statue of the Virgin Mary in Brazil. Angry at being silenced, Kiernan arrives to find Frankie seeing hallucinations, hearing voices, and sporting some gaping holes in her wrists (the hospital staff fears self-mutilation and suicide attempts) that continue to bleed.
The film follows the pair as Frankie's condition deteriorates and the attacks become more violent as another mystery, this one inside the walls of the Vatican, unfolds.  The ""Stigmata"" tagline says it all: the messenger must be silenced. The explanation for the phenomenon is unexpected, as are the two different endings: the theatrical ending and the director's ending. Due to poor test screenings the theatrical ending was substituted, but Wainwright's ending fits in more with the predictions of Father Andrew. There are several deleted scenes, including an alternate opening that explains Father Almeida's death. Factual errors run rampant, including Father Kiernan's assertion that no one had ever received all five stigmata (untrue, St. Francis received all five at once), that St. Francis of Assisi was 23 when he first received the stigmata (he was in his forties), and the fact that Cardinal Houseman wears a goatee (prohibited by the Vatican).
The visuals are striking if overwhelming. Multitudes of candles are present in almost every shot, as is water, doves, and blood. The scenes of Frankie receiving the stigmata are almost seizure-inducing-strobe lights, split-second flashes of nails being hammered into wrists, Frankie's bloodied face from several angles, all without transitions, rushed and drowned in a hard-rock soundtrack (the visuals alone built up a sufficient atmosphere of foreboding; the hard rock was overkill) penned by Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan. Sinead O'Connor and the Afro-Celt Sound System contribute, as does Natalie Imbruglia, and David Bowie.
""Stigmata"" is entertaining, although it is extremely violent, gory, contains graphic sex, and is easily religiously offensive. There really is no Satanic demonic possession, rather something using Frankie as a messenger for good (albeit with extreme Machiavellian means).  The movie casts a less than flattering light on the Catholic Church and the Vatican, and seems to glorify Frankie's hedonistic lifestyle. But the stigmata and Father Kiernan inevitably leave a large impact on Frankie's life, Frankie, who was once so self-assured in her partying ways and the non-existence of God. As the messenger she utters these words from the gospel of St. Thomas: ""The kingdom of God is within you and all around you. It is not within buildings of wood or stone. Split a piece of wood and you will find me. Look beneath a stone and I am there."" Although at times it looks like an outtake from Madonna's ""Like a Prayer"" video, ""Stigmata"" is thought provoking and visually stunning.",1025913600,3,4022,5.454253611556982

I believe in God I always have, but I have never bought into the belief that you have to belong to a church or a certain religion to be with Jesus.  Since the discovery of the Dead Sea scrolls there has been controversy and this movie raises the question if the Vatican has been forthcoming about the interpretation of the scrolls or if they have held something back in fear that the truth would unravel the Vatican and the Catholic religion as a whole.

1063525,4,6305718903,"I need to address some comments made by Pat McCullough.  I agree that the film takes some liberty in saying that the Gospel of Thomas predates the New Testament.  At the very least it comes from the same period as Mathew and Luke.  However, it shows a striking resemblance to the hypothetical source document for those gospels, the ""Q"", which must have existed in parallel to the Gospel of Mark for Mathew and Luke to be written.  It is this still hypothetical Q Gospel that may have possibly predated even the earliest version of Mark, which was probably written around 40 AD.  And Coptic is considered a form of Egyptian, not Greek.  A fragment of an earlier version written in Greek had already been discovered, so it is presumed that the original language of the Gospel of Thomas is Greek, which makes sense if one assumes it to be a partially Gnosticized version of the Q (Gnostics were like a cross between the Greek Sophists and early Christians).  The idea that Jesus was anti-orthodoxy, however, is not a uniquely Gnostic trait and still survived to some degree in the New Testament.  So even if one throws out the goofy anti-flesh & circular philosophy portions of Thomas, you could still end up with a resemblance of the Q Gospel saying such things as ""the kingdom of heaven is inside you and all around you, but you do not realize it"".  So in this sense I think the film is still not too far off the mark. (no pun intended)",1021248000,4,1435,4.5310077519379846

There's supposed to be a conspiracy to keep Christ's words from the faithful and there's also some sort of satanic possession going on which keeps the special effects people busy.  Gabriel Byrne plays the priest who tries to help her and also is attracted to her, but he's just about as believable as the rest of this awful story.  It's true that the film did move fast and held my interest, but only because it was so strange.  I give this a ""thumbs down"". Don't waste your time.",1021161600,4,882,4.745098039215686
1063527,4,6305718903,"This innovative horror has Patricia Arquette as Frankie, a hairdresser who suddenly starts experiencing the stigmata.  Eventually the Vatican gets to hear of it and send miracle detective Father Kiernan (Byrne) to find out if it's a true miracle.  Upon arrival it soon becomes apparent that this is no ordinary case: Frankie is experiencing more of the five wounds of Christ than any stigmatic ever has before and, anyway, she doesn't believe in God.
Obviously there's a lot of comparisons to be made to 'The Exorcist', but this is actually an entirely different movie.  For one thing, it's about as modern as any movie could hope to be, with techno music and electric photography.  Secondly there's a lot here to suggest that this isn't your usual horror.  Interestingly, rather than focusing squarely on Frankie's personal hell it also takes into accounts the Church as Father Kiernan discovers an elaborate conspiracy in the Vatican.  It turns out that Frankie is more than just a stigmatic but is trying to uncover the secret of an entirely new gospel, that of Jesus' own words.
This plot is not only controversial but incredibly interesting in a day when most modern horror movies merely ape their predecessors.  Here the hope doesn't lie in religion, in fact it's the exact opposite, with the Church being portrayed as a powerful and anything but benevolent force.  Doubtless this will offend many, although the concept is nothing short of original.
The acting is very good indeed as well, especially Arquette and Byrne as the two leads.

The problem, it seems, is tying the two together. The explanations for the events given where either weak, or confusing. Why was an atheist afflicted with stigmata? What was the Vatican so desperate to cover up? Why was such a high level priest driven to such unchristian behavior? These questions are answered, but rather unconvincingly.

Father Andrew Keirnan was a scientist before he became a priest. He has an interesting job. He works directly for the Vatican and travels the world checking out reported visions and miracles. Most of these turn out to be bogus, but in South America, he witnesses an event that he cannot disprove. Upon the death of a priest there, a statue of the Virgin Mary in the local church begins to weep blood. While all this is going on, a boy steals the dead priest's rosary and sells it to an American tourist, who sends it to her daughter as a present. As soon as it arrives, the girl begins to experience a condition know as the stigmata. She begins to suffer the wounds that Christ suffered on the cross. What makes it all the more mysterious is that the girl isn't Catholic. In fact, she doesn't even believe in God. Father Keirnan becomes involved in ways he never dreamed possible. And a Cardinal back in Rome is willing to do anything to hush the whole matter up.
Patricia Arquette is marvelous as the victim, Frankie Page. She throws herself into the role, and while it isn't a part worth losing sleep over, I can't help but admire Arquette's energy. She should have a long and successful career. Gabriel Byrne gives his usual serviceable performance as Father Keirnan, a man who long ago lost his own faith. Jonathan Price is suitably creepy as the nefarious Cardinal Houserman, while Nia Long does okay in the thankless role of Frankie's best friend.
This brings us to the fly in the ointment - the plot. The Catholic church was particularly upset over Stigmata. I'm not Catholic, so to me it was basically just another movie. Still, the whole thing is illogical, and I suspect that the screenwriter was either a former Catholic with something against the Church or someone who didn't do their research. The stigmata is supposed to be the blood of Christ. It would seem that, if such an experience really occurred, it would bring the person to a higher plane of existence. Instead, after a particularly horrific episode, Frankie and her friend decide that the best idea is to go to the local disco. After all, it's Friday night. Later, Frankie goes through a demonic possession straight out of The Exorcist. This scene is in total opposition to the original notion that she is made to suffer for the purpose of some greater good. The story becomes a muddled mess of theological mayhem, but I do not think the Church will suffer any irreparable harm from this Hollywood Stigmata.",1016582400,,2660,4.6617021276595745

1063546,1,6305718903,"Despite it's glossy visuals, production values and dependable performances by Gabriel Byrne and Patricia Arquette, Stigmata is an utter failure at it's core. At the basis of this overwrought dreck is a Catholic conspiracy revolving around a hidden gospel written by Jesus himself. A gospel that the church doesn't want anyone to know about. Their line of thought focuses on the belief that this testament would somehow challenge the basic tenants of Catholic faith. Most pointedly in the removal of a mid-point between man and god. Essentially saying that you wouldn't have to talk to god through the church and follow it's methods of repentance, (hail marys and whatnot). Unfortunately for the pretentious drivel that is Stigmata, there is a simple flaw that makes this film completely null and void. Apparently everyone involved in the production of Stigmata wasn't aware that all evolutions of protestant faith are already based on the iconoclastic tenant of a direct connection with god. Growing up a baptist I am well aware of it. I'm also aware that it's nothing new, and catholocism isn't any worse for wear because of it. Stigmata's intensely self involved delusion is, quite frankly, pathetic. That this film actually caused any ripples whatsoever in the Catholic community is beyond me.
Beyond that more obvious failing, this film has loads more. Logic leaps and plot contrivances are par for the course. We also get to revel in and underlying cheapness. This is most apparent in the occasionl and utterly pointless nudity of Patricia Arquette. Not that she's not a pleasure to look at, but it doesn't serve any purpose other than a thrill. Neither do the over stylized and over loud effects. At one point she is possessed by some kind of demon who procedes to toss Byrne around, trashing the place. The only reason it happens is so they could have some sort of evil and menacing presence in all this mumbo jumbo. Once this film goes all Exorcist on us, (a film who's shoes Stigmata couldn't even shine), there's no saving this mind number.
Yeck! Avoid like the plague.",1003622400,12,2079,4.942857142857143
1063547,4,6305718903,"While it's certainly no Exorcist, Stigmata is a successful film that engaged me enough to give it an above average rating. I watched this film with a bunch of friends and I don't think they enjoyed it very much. But I really liked this film. I think if you look closer into the movie, just try to enjoy it and see its message then I'm sure you will be able to appreciate the film a lot more. Stigmata is surprisingly very intelligent. It explains with excellent cleverness exactly what is happening to the main character. The film also searches into the depths of religions and pulls out things we never knew about and some great philosophies about God. The movie is also visually stunning. We get slow motion, blood and water drips splashing spookily, statues crying and brilliant makeup and special effects. When you see what is happening to Frankie as a retread of what happened to God while he was on the cross, you feel like you can actually hear the whip lashing, or feeling the nails going into your wrists. So, the movie is smart, intriguing, looks great and has an interesting moral. What more do you want? Perhaps the movie could've cut the romance story, which really peeved me off, and there were a couple of boring parts. The end sort of leaves on an unexciting note. However, the big picture is a movie that has a great meaning and terrified me with its scenes of intense violence. This movie is not for the faint-hearted and hard-out Christians, but I recommend Patricia Arquette fans, thriller and supernatural movie fans and people who enjoy good visuals and eerie settings to watch Stigmata.
NOTE: I loved the production notes and alernate ending to the movie on the DVD, but felt they could've had something that journied a little further into the genius of the excellent visuals. This remains a good DVD buy, and the sound is fantastic!",1002240000,3,1856,4.661585365853658

First of all it was promoted as an ""Exorcist"" styled psychological chiller.  Naturally I was psyched to see it based on that but in truth ""Stigmata"" is nothing like the ""Exorcist"" in story, style, or quality.  After seeing it it was obvious that this comparison was merely a shameless promotional scheme meant to deliberately deceive the viewer.
Furthermore, and not the least of its problems, was the casting. Gabriel Byrne was fantastic, as usual, even with the dull material he had to work with.  I swear the guy must be an alchemist but instead of turning lead into gold he achieves the same result with garbage.  Patricia Arquette on the other hand could suck the life out of an Ed Wood production.  She's the only actress I can think of that's guilty of underacting and here she is with top billing!  All the while they had Portia de Rossi in the cast who's an extraordinary and capable actress, despide credits the likes of Ally McBeal and Scream 2, and she's in the movie for less than twenty minutes.  I defy you to find the logic in this.
So what we have here is a miserable addition to the ""end times"" cadre of films that experienced a mercifully short life in '99.  It had a few chilling visuals but in the end it utterly squandered any potential it may have had.  You can bury this right next to ""End of Days"" for all I care.",996105600,7,1509,4.514705882352941

It is women who suffer being pinned up, being hammered, being crowned with thorns, all the world over, but without getting any hearing on the agendas of the governments.

1063589,4,6305718903,"...Two Commanding Leads (Patricia Arquette and Gabriel Byrne) and Stylish Directing by Rupert Wainwright. ""Stigmata"" Rises above the Ordinary and gives it's audience Thrills, Chills, Well Developed Characters and an Interesting Premise.
Patricia Arquette plays Frankie Paige, a Confessed Atheist who has been Suffering a series of Attacks, which leave Markings that resemble Jesus' Wounds before his Death on the Cross. Gabriel Byrne plays a Vatican Investigator who is sent to America to find out the Truth, or the Cause behind these markings.
The story is Immediately Intriguing, as is the film, which is Captivating from the Pre-Credit Sequence. It Greatly Differs from the Horror movies released around it (""End of Days"" and ""Sleepy Hollow"") as it deals more with the Religious aspects more Realistically and Ultimately it's more a story about Good than it is about Evil.
Wainwright's Music Video-ish Directing style keeps the film Rolling at a Brisk Pace, his Visual Style is Always Eye-Catching and he directs the Actors well. Jonathon Pryce, Nia Long, Rade Serbedzija and Portia De Rossi appear in the Supporting cast but they aren't given much to do, Byrne and Arquette Rarely leave the screen, which is a Good thing as watching their relationship grow Past a Doctor/Patient relationship is one of the films Great Joys.

However, after the exciting opening and build-up, the main ""horror"" (more accurately ""supernatural"") plot fizzles out.
There is also a romantic subplot about the forbidden love between a celibate priest and a beautiful woman that actually remains quite strong for the duration of the film and avoids descending into melodrama like most such plots, however the ultimately weak horror plot winds up detracting from this aspect of the movie.  There is also a political plot about intrigue within the Vatican regarding the suppression of the Gospel of Thomas, etc., that is unfortunately underdeveloped and which also gets lost in the shuffle.

The scenes are a longer more explicit sex scene between Frankie and Steve, a alternative beginning where Alameda kills himself by jumping off the church, a scene where Frankie is in the salon alone and stuff starts flying around poltergeist fashion, a scene where Frankie kicks Steve out of her apartment after a fight, a more explicit scene where Frankie stabs her wrist and finally a alternative ending where it is implied that Frankie dies.

I would have to agree that it is gravely misinformed when it comes to ""lost gospels"" and the real intention of the Catholic Church.  I assure you that the Catholic Church's intention is not to ""hide the truth"" from us common folk; and I also assure you that the Church does not accept ""lost gospels"" because they show evidence contrary to the Church's belief, and in turn, the Church is in fear of its inability to stay in ""power.""  Investigations on these new findings (such as the gospel of St. Thomas, the Dead Sea Scrolls-which have been deemed authentic by the Catholic Church, the book of Mormon, etc.) are done with incredible and tedious detail and are deeply analyzed.  So, for the Church not to recognize the authenticity of a lost gospel means that they specifically found something that suggested it was not real.
And the weird love relationship between the priest and the ""atheist.""  Puh-lease.  Sworn to celibacy and that easily tempted?  God save us if our Catholic priests were that lecherous and vulnerable....
On the DVD and film itself - I found the clip titled, ""Frankie and Steve Get It On"" unnecessary, and might I add, very pervertedly titled.  Where the makers of this film serious at all?

There are a few interesting visual ideas, but you get the feeling that's the only thing the director brought to the movie, since the screenplay has no real meat. The characters are typically one-dimensional and live only to serve the plot. Many times during the movie, you can see them jump up and walk angrily out of the shot, or deliver a dramatic one-liner and exit (usually to another jump-cut), precisely when the dialogue would force them to say something substantive, or force the screenplay to tip its hand and reveal that there's no real meat to the story. The actors do fine with the roles they're given, but frankly, those roles don't amount to much.

No wonder the Freemasons were persecuted so much, throughout time, and continue to be persecuted today.

Frankie Paige does not believe in God, demostrating her absence of faith through her rather wild-child lifestyle of the mainstream nineties. While sitting in her bathtub one night, she begins writhing and jerking, apparently not because she wants to, and blood begins pouring out of fresh holes in her wrists. Doctors and surgeons cannot interpret the cause of the holes, and label it an attempted suicide. After receiving whip slashes across her back on a subway train, Frankie's situation comes to the attention of the Vatican, where Father Andrew Kiernan is sent to Pittsburgh to investigate the strange occurences. Upon his arrival, he becomes more emotionally involved with Frankie than his conscience allows, and this, accompanied by two more strange wounds, conspire to force Kiernan as well as Paige look at their lives and take stock of themselves. After hearing Kiernan's explanation for her marks, Frankie will soon learn that she is channeling a powerful message that could change the way humanity looks at the church.
If this synopsis sounds the least bit confusing, then this movie is not for you. If you find it intriguing, then I highly recommend going out to rent it. First of all, the movie is unlike most movies of the horror/thriller genre in that it does not come out and say which one it is; you must infer it for yourself based upon how the movie registers in your mind. The suspense of the film is high if you can understand the complex plot and subplots; otherwise, you may find it hard to understand, and certain scenes and dialogue will not make sense.
Rupert Wainwright has done an excellent job in incorporating fact with fiction, making the film much more believable. The technical and factual aspects surrounding the phenomenom of stigmata are handled nicely, and very accurately. A lot of religious symbolism is also interjected into the plot, wihch makes it not only a thriller for bloodseekers, but a thriller for those in the mood for deep religious meaning.
Actors take their parts very seriously, playing them with perfection and knowledge of what the character is truly experiencing. Arquette shines as the beautiful and tortured Frankie, and her performance in scenes of the stigmata add to the intensity and suspense. Byrne is superb as Father Kiernan, showing sympathy when needed but also remaining intact with his side of strictness in terms of his objectives dealing with the Vatican.
A downright delicious film that was trashed by critics everywhere, Stigmata is a perfect ensemble of actors and storyline that will satisfy those in the mood to think while they watch.",969926400,4,2854,5.035940803382664

By the end of the movie I could hardly get her to say anything. She was so freaked out that I thought she was in shock. I don't usally let things affect me like that. But the way i felt about the movie was that it was of the Devil himself. It left me with such a bad feeling that I wasn't sure what to believe. I am not a real religious person but I know with out a doubt that what I saw on that movie was pure blasphemy. I have never used that word before but that is the only word I could think of after I watched this movie.

The  movie is about the mysterious in our life. Stigmata (the wounds of Christ  inflicted on very spiritual persons) must be one of the more colorful  elements of Christian mythology, and it is fascinating to see them realized  within the modern world. Our heroine, Frankie, gets the wounds even though  she is unreligious and quite earthly - but she is honest. How does an  honest person react to the sacred, to the otherworldly, to a mysterious and  overwhelming visit by God? Think of it. It is just a very interesting idea  and this movie makes it justice.
There are two other themes in the story:  a scientist priest who falls out of love with the church and into love with  Frankie, and a (quite fictitious) gospel of Christ and the Vatican's  efforts to suppress it. There is also a demonic thread in the story which I  personally found off-key. All of these themes are joined into a well  crafted movie with intelligent use of color, music and Christian symbols  aplenty (streams of water, drops of blood, pigeons, fire). I found the  movie to be immensely viewable.
The DVD includes the director's  commentaries, a very worthwhile addition.",968371200,3,1359,4.759656652360515

After that, it goes back through ""power"",  ""faith"" and ""passion"".

1063717,2,6305718903,"You know the routine: Bad cop, Good cop.  For over 30 years the movie industry has been stretching the limits to graphically portray evil. Now western viewers are weary of evil and are ready to cheer when good wins,  but we have developed a taste for violence and horror, just so long as  there's a 'nice' ending, something to cause us to cheer, or to bring a  happy tear to our eye. Well, watch out folks, the real trouble is just  beginning. It won't be in the form of overt evil; it will now be in the  form of heartwarming good. Here's what's up and what role this movie plays  in it:
The message of this movie has to do with the validity of the word  of God and changes that are coming with power. It is a weapon designed to  attack Christianity and reintroduce an ancient heresy.
But first a note  on the stigmatics: Non-Catholics will reject the concept of the stigmata.  Jesus took our pain with Him on the cross, why would He inflict such gross  mutilations on anyone for spiritual reasons. I'm not an expert on Catholic  spirituality, but what I've heard is that stigmatics have hearts  consecrated to the Lord and out of their profound communion with Him, they  begin to share in the fellowship of His sufferings. That's a real Biblical  concept ignored by most modern western Christians who are mostly  ""blessing-hungry."" Whether you accept the stigmatic experience as  legitimate or not, the question arises, why do the movie makers want to  create a story about it? The answer is actually found in the messages that  scroll across the screen at the end of the movie. They mention some ancient  documents that were found in the desert in recent years and which the  church ""suppressed."" More on that in a moment.
You've read the  story line already. It turns out that the girl is speaking and writing in  Aramaic, an ancient language spoken by Jesus. In fact, it is the lost  Gospel of Thomas. The dead priest was working on the manuscript and now his  spirit, in the company of obviously demonic persona, are trying to express  themselves through the girl to get the message out
One thing I am really pleased  about in this movie is that the text of the gospel of Thomas was delivered  by a demon. That was one commitment to truth on the part of the movie  makers.
This movie does not stand in isolation. It is part of an  emerging family of ""spiritual"" movies including ""The Green  Mile"" and especially ""The Matrix."" <",966384000,,2433,4.534562211981567
1063718,5,6305718903,"An incredible soundtrack propels Stigmata as the best movie I have seen in decades.  The bare bones of the movie was about the struggle for oppressed  truth to be brought to public attention.  Certain truths are hidden for  political, medical,...selfish reasons.  Religious truths, be it small or  large, are often held undisclosed by another country or equally powerful  holder.  The religious truth pursued in the movie was that to love God  didn't mean you had to pray inside of a church or attend to a minister.  The Gospel of St. Thomas, scholars edition, that was found near where the  Dead Sea scrolls were found,  was used as supporting evidence.  The priest  who tried to decipher the scroll and make it public met an untimely death.  The spiritual influences in pushing the truth forward will be enjoyed by  people who believe firmly in the non-physical world interacting with and on  the human world.  The use of light and dark, music or a mix of sound  effects with music really added suspense and maintained it.  Wonderful  job by Patricia Arquette who played the unsuspecting messenger, Frankie  Paige, and Gabriel Bryne was a compelling and believable character, Father  Kiernan, who doubted miracles as the  scientific eye sent to dash the  miracle of stigmata in Frankie Paige.",966297600,7,1294,4.962441314553991
1063770,2,6305718903,"""Stigmata"" is the story of an athiest woman, Frankie (Patricia Arquette), who recieves the mystical stigmata while possessed by a spirit  that bears truth of a new and possibly world-changing scripture.  As she  experiences the pains and agonies of Christ's wounds and sorrows, she is  investigated by a scientist/detective/priest (Gabriel Byrne) on behalf of  Rome.  In an effort to prove the authenticity of Frankie's miracle, the  source and truth of its messenger is realized, and that's when all hell  breaks loose.  Amidst scenes of fire and fury, The Vatican, represented by  a powerful and unsavory cardinal (Rupert Wainwright), attempts to burn the  truth by sending both Frankie and her priest to early graves.
Though the  film is for the most part entertaining and even somewhat informative, it is  nothing new, nor original.  The overall message of the film, that the  Vatican is willing to do anything to hide the ""truth"" and protect  it own position of power, is one of the most overdone and, frankly,  uninspired themes in American Cinema.  As with most such films, the  uninformed viewer will be appalled at the gall of the Church's hierarchy,  and will direct hate and disgust towards the dealings of Catholicism.  To  the informed and unbiased viewer, however, the film will stand as simply  another statement against organized religion.  Either way, the film  promotes individual discretion over spiritual communion, which is  liberating to some, but misguided and lonely for many many others.
The  movie is worth seeing if one is hoping to spark a religious debate . . . it  could be be good for a class of some sort.  If not, then the movie is  nothing more than an uninformed, terribly unfair portrayal of Catholicism  and the Vatican, as has been done numerous times before.  Relationships in  the movie are often unrealistic, and actions are portrayed in very  incriminating ways.
Comparing ""Stigmata"" to ""The  Exorcist"" is ludicrous, because the former is so negative and the  latter so positive.  ""Stigmata"" does copy some scenes of  possession, but its message is one of distrust.  ""The Exorcist""  is the opposite, in which spirituality and the Church wins over evil.  If  one wishes to see the good in Catholicism, ""The Exorcist"" is the  ultimate.  Instead of opinion, ""The Exorcist"" is driven by fact,  and therefore a more reliable source for religious convicition.  ""Stigmata"" is entertaining, but far far insuperior to its more  realistic and accurate predecessor.",966211200,3,2496,5.109725685785536

I saw the movie as a warning if there is  ever something like that gospel discovered,  I wouldn't doubt for a second  that the church would not censor it as it will decentralize it's  authority.
It was also cool that it had an alternate ending but I liked  most the theatrical one.  One thing I did skip was the director's  commentary... it was 3am today and i had to go to work the next day.
I  didn't like the fact that Padre Alameida's suicide was editted, i think it  was a very important part of the film...

And while I thought she did a very good job in Stigmata, the message of the movie made me see it a second time.  This is not a  horror movie...not an Exorcist remake.  There were some major holes in this  movie, but its message and the visuals overshadow the weaknesses.  What's  right about it:  The acting is more than adequate(Byrne & Arquette).  The overall message that organized religion is often very self-serving for  very human factions is undeniable!  Stigmata very effectively makes the  point that buildings and group of stodgy old men aren't a necessary part of  your relationship with any higher power you might recognize.  Visually,  this movie is quite often stunning.  What's wrong about it:  I felt that  the movie would have been better served with a classical soundtrack(i.e.-  Wagner) than with the modern techno tracks that were present throughout the  movie.  It would have been much creepier with an orchestra or violins.  There were times when it looked more like a music video than a major motion  picture.  There is  a gaping hole in the middle of the story.  I can't say  much without giving something away, but what you eventually find out is  wrong with Frankie(Arquette) is inconsistant with the scene in the middle  of the movie where her character tries to seduce Byrne.  In conclusion, it  is certainly worth overlooking the flaws to get the deeper message.  If  you're not into messages, don't worry.

1063827,3,6305718903,"So I finally get to see this in the cheap seats. Patricia Arquette-- yum. Gabriel Byrne-- okay, well, every woman I know thinks he's the bees' knees. Jonathan Pryce really CAN play a scary guy. Interesting soundtrack, if a  little on the silly side (are you really going to hear pop electronica at  any club whose main piece of decor is chain link fence, one wonders?). Very  loose basing on factual events surrounding Nag Hammadi, and I mean VERY  loose (Brazilian priest yes, possessed stigmatic no). And despite this odd  wave of religious-themed media these days, film, at least, seems to be  taking a more intelligent approach to it than television. Instead of  mindless pap like Touched by an Angel and Providence, Stigmata seems to be  drawing from the Blatty/Friedkin axis, and that cannot ever be a bad thing  (well, okay, except for Exorcist II). You know the plot, right? Atheist  suddenly finds herself plagued with Christ's wounds, speaking in dead  languages, and writing on the walls of her apartment. Actually, it kind of  reminds me of a sexy blond John Denver in Oh, God. Happily, Byrne is a lot  more attractive than George Burns was.
  Once again, I walked out of  the theater with a sense of underwhelment that stemmed only from the film's  last ten minutes, just like in Sleepy Hollow. Stigmata is a stylized,  slick, well-processed tour-de-force right up until the end, where instead  of wrapping things up nicely (despite the fact that things COULD have been  wrapped up nicely quite easily, in any one of five or six different ways),  suddenly the screen goes black and we get some overlay text about Nag  Hammadi. All well and good, but what happened? Do Gabe and Patty get  married, go off, and make babies? Does Patty kick off and get a really nice  funeral? Does Gabe ever actually finish getting the haircut Patty starts to  give him? Does Patty's not-so-significant other get jealous and kill them  both in a fit of rage? And is that stupid statue really a miracle? All this  and more... we dunno. Still, I'd prefer the loose ends rather than Sleepy  Hollow's artificial tying-together, if not by much.

1063828,5,6305718903,"Stigmata is by far one of the best movies I've seen- it is really incredible in comparison with other movies that try to achieve its success.
This movie is strange, and sometimes even slightly sinister in  its portrayal of a woman named Frankie Paige in New York (Patricia  Arquette) who is afflicted with the Stigmata, or the wounds of Christ. An  open minded priest (Gabriel Byrne) ends up meeting with her, and is  extremely surprised to find that this claim of Stigmata occurences is true,  despite the fact that Frankie doesn't go to church. In fact, Frankie isn't  very religious at all, and lives the shallow, hip life of a partying  hairstylist. The contrast between the Church and the life of this young  woman is brilliant and stunningly effective.
The rest of the movie is  spent discovering more about the situation that Frankie is in, and the  possible implications it could have to the church, and to the religion  itself. In the end this movie is a deeply thought provoking exploration of  religion itself, how everything that is accepted by the church may not be  the truth, and how what many of us follow could be completely backwards. It  really makes you think.
This already strong movie is further enhanced  with the visual effects- so much so that you could buy this movie just for  the incredible scenes. All of the wounds of Christ shown in the film are  very realistically, enough so that many squeamish people may have to turn  away from the screen during these moments. The the way the wounds are shown  to occur (chaotically, and in sudden flashses) is incredible, adding to the  suspense. Also, in the climax of the film there is one particularly  rewarding scene which you might just have to watch over and over (it's too  cool!)
This movie is definitely and incredible achievment in filmaking,  with a great and intellectual plot expressed with beauty. Some people may  not like it as much if they are sensitive to graphic scenes, or if they  don't like content that has to do with religion. However, for the majority  of people who see it, this movie is a greatly rewarding and enjoyable  experience.",961027200,10,2131,4.735694822888283

Not so with this one!  There were enough accurate facts (e.g.,  the Gospel of St. Thomas was found in 1954 and it quotes Christ as saying  ""split a piece of wood, I am there. Lift up the stone and you will  find me there.""; Christ's wrists would most likely have been nailed,  not his hands, etc.) to make it believable.

1063855,4,6305718903,"SPOILER WARNING:  This comment contains specific references to plot elements that reveal the ending.  It is strongly recommended that you see the film before reading this review.
`Stigmata' uses as its premise the  actual existence of the gospel of Thomas, a gospel taken from a scroll  found in 1945, and condemned by the Catholic Church as heresy.  This gospel  gives essentially the same message as the gospel in the film, that the  kingdom of God is of this earth and it is not about heaven, churches or  religion.  But clearly, the gospel in the film is not Thomas, despite the  allusion at the end of the film.  Thomas was written in Greek not Aramaic,  and has been dated by scholars to the second century, hardly  contemporaneous with Jesus.  The film is a highly contrived fictional yarn  that imaginatively invents a scroll of Jesus' words and then takes the  religious mythos of stigmata and combines it with the mythos of possession  (in ways not consistent with either) as a device to reveal the plot of the  Church to keep the gospel a secret.
We are asked to believe that an  atheist gets stigmata (no such event has ever been reported) as the result  of possession by the spirit of a dead human whom she never knew (this is  the purview of the devil; human spirits are not thought to possess living  beings) because she touched his rosary beads (also touched by her mother,  the boy who sold them to her and Father Kiernan without effect).  Ok, I  guess that's what fantasy films are supposed to do, conjure improbable  situations out of the imagination.  Still, it takes liberties that distort  and misrepresent religious beliefs, which is always risky business.  While  watching this film, I had to pretend I didn't know what I know.  Once over  this hurdle, it was an fascinating, engaging and frightening story.
There  are other strange inconsistencies and unanswered questions though.  Father  Alameida was a good and pious man.  Yet he possesses Frankie with an evil  vengeance and attempts to use Frankie to sexually seduce Kiernan, beating  him from pillar to post when he doesn't consent.  That's just not  consistent with who Alameida was.  Also, why was Frankie strong enough to  throw Kiernan around the room like a rag doll, but helpless to stop  Cardinal Houseman from choking her?  And what was all the dripping water  about?  If that was explained somewhere, I must have missed it.
Comparisons between this and `The Exorcist' are misplaced.  They really  had nothing in common other than the fact that the main character was  possessed.  There is one scene during the rage following Frankie's  seduction attempt of Kiernan that had obvious elements of comparison but  that was about it.  This was not an exorcism and the devil was nowhere to  be found.
From a filmmaking standpoint, this film was terrific.  Rupert  Wainwright does a marvelous job from start to finish with this film.  The  photography was fantastic.  The use of the camera perspectives, scene set  up and various techniques including slow motion, double exposures, rapid  fire jump cuts and reverse slow motion were all fabulous (though sometimes  used to excess) and added power and impact to create some very scary  footage.  I've read complaints about the sound, but the sound on the DVD  copy I had was great with excellent surround effects.  It was a bit loud at  times but not so much that I had to ride shotgun on the volume  control.
This was a marvelous breakthrough performance for Patricia  Arquette.  When she was in Frankie mode she was sometimes arrogant and self  centered, and at others sweet, helpless and terrified.  When in possession  mode she was powerful and frightening.  She handled all these states  believably and with aplomb.
Gabriel Byrne also gave a wonderful  performance as Father Kiernan.  He achieved just the right balance between  intellectual skepticism and self doubt with a genuine concern for  Frankie.
Overall, I really enjoyed this film.  Yes, the story was flawed,  but not irretrievably.  As a supernatural thriller it was first rate.  I  rated it an 8/10.  Not for the squeamish.",958176000,,4123,4.887755102040816
1063856,4,6305718903,"When a film centers its plot as strongly around the practices of a particular religious sect as ""Stigmata"" does Catholicism, one can assume the film will be an attempt to comment on that sect, or at least  some aspect of that sect's traditions.
""Stigmata,"" though,  steps quickly out of the path of genuine, or even alarmist, commentary as  Arquette's ""Frankie"" becomes more and more deeply involved in the  weird spiritual legacy symbolized by the rosary of a dead South American  priest.
This priest, whose position on the ""good guy-bad guy""  scale is at best questionable throughout the film, has given his life to  the pursuit of the ""true"" historical Christ.  Does director  Wainwright admire or condemn him for this?  It's hard to tell--in the  theater version of the film, we see the late priest only as demon possessor  (the source, perhaps, of the ""Exorcist"" echoes); it's only in the  DVD's deleted prologue that we see the priest, tormented by his struggle  against the Catholic hierarchy, fling himself from his church steeple.  Perhaps this scene had been intended to win our sympathies for the poor  source of Frankie's suffering.  But even with the scene included, we still  are left to wonder just whose side God is on--or is Wainwright trying to  say that the church has killed God?  (And if so, why the optimistic  alternate ending?)
As theologically vague and spiritually empty as the  film seems to be, though, it does qualify in my book as a high-quality  psychological thriller.  Pretend the stigmata are caused by simple demonic  possession, and that Jonathan Pryce and his goonies are, oh, Nazi agents,  rather than priests; if you can ignore the failed attempt at religious  commentary this film is an excellent view.",957571200,,1742,4.958333333333333

Arquette in  particular continues a career of great performances; this lady can act!  But, as I reached the conclusion, I couldn't help but wonder if the  screenwriters got confused on which direction they were headed.  At some  points, Arquette's character is clearly antagonistic toward priests and  nuns--ala ""The Exorcist"" in a few scenes--but later we're told  she's the messenger for Jesus's words as revealed through the departed  spirit of a Brazilian Catholic priest.  The messenger premise would've  worked without the apparent presence of a demonic force.  The use of the  stigmata to validate her message was gripping and effective--if only the  end hadn't muddied their purpose.

1063955,2,6305718903,"Stylistically, this film is very late 90's.  Color isblue-filtered and the over-all effect is MTV/Rock video-esque, or ifyou perfer, one could use its stills for any number of Vogue magazine fashion ads.  This can be good, I guess, but in a movie length piece it gets more than strained.
One set is a virtual similacrum of the Mike Jackson video where he smashes a car in a N.Y. alley--it's the same alley, the same car, the same whipping wind, only a possessed P. Arquette squats atop the derelict car clawing at its sheet-metal.
Stigmata is as follows:
--a series of pieces stolen from: the excorcist (including hospital scenes where a terrified protagonist is subjected to nasty tests which we know will be useless, levitation, speaking in 'deep' demonic voices, confusion ""What's happening to me"", whip marks, virtually everything except: no ""help me"" on the girl's stomach, and, alas, no green vomit)
--MTV 'trendiness': protagonist is pieced and fashionably tattood, navel-ring, et al., works in a (GET THIS): hair salon cum piecing/tattooing parlor.  But what is worst of all in this little setting detail: there is no reason for her to work here, excepting, of course, that it is sooo cool.  If she's so depraved, be a stripper, or a bar-tender, or a punked-out waitress who has a bit of a coke habit. This would actually add a bit of ""Depth"" and even better ""Complication"" to an otherwise bland character.  Neat glowy rings and leather pants do not an interesting character make.
--excesive use of candles, see the Crow, et al.  Protagonist takes long baths in tub.  This is O.K., what isn't:
 1.  There are at least 20 dozen candles lit around it.  Spooky? No. The movie is as spooky as trendy club.  Actually less, these tend to horrifying prices.  2. the tub is has no curtain and sits in the middle of the room (?).
3.  the room has 20' ceilings and is the size of a warehouse.
4.  room has cast iron sky-lights (!).
5. remember, protagonist is a hair-dresser in N.Y.
6.  this scene keeps its tone with: A: model shoots B: gothically inspired comercials and music videos C: movies, albeit bad ones. (Candles: they can be evil and holy at the same time--wheee...)
--Male priest + female possessie = sexual tension.  Beyond trite.
--Big Hollywood finish.  Which not only fails to deliver, it just ain't scary.  Just plain stupid, and hopefully an insult to one's intelligence.

The film has great production values, but again, so do most commercials.  And the film has the feel of a cobbled together series of music videos, Vogue spreads, and T.V. commercials, it's like a resume of the director's past work (one of which looks like an American Express (or that flower company) commercial--the cafe scene where P.A. asks Priest if he misses sex [you see this stupid query comming a mile away...ugh], and when she gets tossed into the flower arrangement you just want to clap and yell with cathartic glee--take that Patricia! [...which I must admit, I did])
This movie is at best a stylish, yet conventional pastiche of tired demon/religion/catholic/possession movies.  Worse, it is dull, dull, dull -- except if you can see it in the movies and laugh your head-off at all the right (or wrong) times, i.e., whenever Patricia gets horribly injured.
One marginally redeaming virtue: those unfamiliar with the Apocrapha and in particular to the Nag Hammadi codex, otherwise known at the Gospel of Thomas, discovered in Egypt in 1954, I believe, may at least get some exposure to this important find.  But this could also be seen as a horrible pity -- to gain insight into your religion through a very silly movie.
In sum: Writing a review for this one is like writing a review for a twinky.  Those who like Hostess products will eat it anyway, those who don't won't even go near a review of such creme in the first place.  Chances are, if you like this kind of fodder, kudos. There is a lot of this stuff out there; I envy your easily entertained simplicity for you will never have a weekend bereft of a 'great' and/or 'provocative' film.
A great example of ""Bad-Film"": (mainly a work of trite mediocrity, dull, banal, perdictable, poorly written, topical--read: trendy and soon to be dated 90's ephemera, and attempting to pass itself off as important or ""thought-provoking"", which it may be to those lacking grey-matter above the eye-brows.)",956102400,11,4350,4.815860215053763

1064001,2,6305718903,"I saw the film ""Stigmata"" when it was released, theatrically, and I was extremely disappointed with it.  I thought the performances were flat and unconvincing.  I will admit that ""Stigmata"" had some  slick direction by Rupert Wainwright (although some may argue that it  looked like a techno music video). But I found the overall result to be  just boring and uninteresting.  I gave the film 1 1/2 star out of 4.
When  ""Stigmata"" was released onto DVD, the cover boasted some very  intriguing special features, such as deleted scenes and an alternate  ending.  So, my curiosity got the best of me and I checked it out.  I, once  again, thought the movie was flat and was a hideous attempt to rip-off  ""The Exorcist.""  But the DVD transfer was beautiful and the  commentary by director Wainwright was informative.  I can say that I was  more than a little disappointed in the alternate ending, though, which is  no more than a few additional, very brief camera shots.  The other features  include a music video and an interesting 8-page insert.
Bottom line: If  you enjoyed the film at the theatre, I think the DVD is a must have.  Or if  you were like me and thought the movie was missing something, then you  probably won't find that something on this DVD.",955411200,2,1257,4.660550458715596

The  video quality in this title is very well done,  and everything comes across  as cleanly as you would expect from a dvd (despite no animorphic format).  The 5.1 surround is also a plus, as the eerie score comes at you from all  directions.  In terms of extras, you get an extra ending (which, in my  opinion, makes everything fall together better), a music video, and the  directors commentary.

The pace of the movie was really slow, so you kept on waiting to see  if there is any more to this movie other than watching Pat Arquette going  through this spiritual agony. Yawn...Well guess what? There is nothing  more. This movie was glorified by "" The Exorcist"" and that is how  it made it's money.

So what do you do when you find a new gospel, Jesus' own words at that and one that will attack the church's core? This is the story of an everyday girl (played wonderfully well by Arquette)who becomes possessed and starts to exhibit stigmata. Trouble is that stigmata only appear on the devout and Arquette is an atheist. Along comes Byrne (also great) to unravel the mystery - an ex-scientist turned Father - but he becomes drawn into a cover-up on a massive scale.
The effects are minimal and well done. The story is gripping. The DVD is provided with deleted scenes and an alternative ending (which I preferred) along with a music video.

Acting performances were generally good and the visual style added to the  tone; losing colour over time as Arquette fades away. I was particularly  struck by the alternate ending which fitted the general tone of the film  much more than the theatrical release's 'happy ending', increasing the  impact of the film.

It is an old school of thought about the real 'religious'  significance of the 'church', and a new one about the truth coming to  light. This film helps that 'new' school of thought along. I can understand  why it was bashed. The Papal is a billion dollar business. No need for  churches? Priest? Great elaborate halls of worship? What will Rome do? God  is in you?
In fairness I can see where people picked up on the  exorcist/omen angel, but to dismiss the film as a result of it allows their  organized religious 'slip' to show.
If your looking for food for  thought, another option to who is in charge and how, then pick this one  up. If the idea that the church is one big money making fallacy incenses  you, skip this one.

The premise:  Jesus sits down and writes his own gospel story/scripture.  (Yeaaa!)  Then, oops, he loses it.  (Rats!)

The movie also  predictably omits that no bible scholar (even university academicians with  no religious allegiances) has ever regarded the ""st. thomas""  gospel as anything other than a mediocre fabrication.

After watching the movie, I was so happy to find out about the ""words of  Christ"". I don't belong to a church. I don't go to church. But that  doesn't mean I don't beleive in God. I am a good person. I try to live my  life correctly and I don't need to go to church to pray. I don't need to  tell someone else what I've done wrong. I don't need the Middle-man. I  loved this movie because it tells you that. ""Christ said""; you  don't have to worship me or my father in a building. I will be there,  anywhere, you need me.

Based on the overweighing consensus, you are MORE likely to ENJOY this movie than hate  it.  So go for it!  I personally loved every aspect of this movie: the  story line, acting, photography, special effects & Dolby 5.1 are all  top notch.

True  Sci-Fi fans will be disappointed.  This isn't even a good Exorcist rip-off.  The premise for the movie is unique, even though factually  void.
However, the WORST aspect of this movie is that it takes itself far  too seriously, and once it does that it collapses.  It degenerates into a  preachy, self-absorbed sermon --- exactly the type of religious mentality  it presumes to attack.",951955200,9,739,5.033057851239669
1064226,4,6305718903,"I loved this movie! I can understand why a lot of Catholics wouldn't though. The film portrays the Catholic church in a most unflattering light. I read one reviewer who wondered why the Catholic church would speak out  against a film like Dogma and not this film...Easy answer, the St. Thomas  gospel is a very real document discovered in 1945, and rest assured the  Catholic church didn't want to speak out against this film because they  didn't want it to receive any more publicity than it was already going too,  and they had no real argument as the document is real and does exist. The  church(and not just Catholic ones)are a multibillion dollar industry, and  if people were to go by the words of Christ himself in the St. Thomas  gospel, then church's around the world could stand to lose a lot of support  and money. ""The temple of God is inside you, not in mansions of wood  and stone, split the wood and you will see me, lift a stone and you shall  find me""

Everything about this film works.  The photography, the music, and  especially the actors.  Patricia Arquette is yet again amazing and dynamic  in a part that most actresses could never play.  She is strong and gritty,  and sweet and vulnerable.  She just knows how to convey emotions on screen,  like no other actor can.  And her scream...comes from her womb, not her  head...so bllod curtling.  Gabriel Byrne is also well utilized here,  presenting strength here...we can see he is a human as well, not just a  hero.  if you want to think, if you want to be scared, if you want to be  entertained and have something to talk about, see Stigmata.  watch out fot  the attack scenes...the most startling scenes ever shot on film...you feel  as if you are being crucified!",951955200,2,913,4.622641509433962

The best thing I liked about the DVD was the director's  commentary.  It is one of the best that I have heard.  He really gets into  the way the film was made and the problems that were encounterd.  The only  disappointment was that the commentary didn't continue onto the director's  ending which you would think would be the obvious place for an explanation.",951955200,5,598,4.547169811320755

There is a lack of plot in this movie.it is just the bleed  typical nonsence that you would expect to come out of hollywood. Every time the  tension sags ~Patricia arquette will be afflicted with a new wound and  gabriel byrne(the priest) will look very worried. Okay so the acting is  very good for this type of movie which is the main reason why i even gave  it the two stars along with the impressive special efects. The film is also  far too short and you almost feel as if the director had rushed the end of  this film.

1064281,4,6305718903,"O.K., so in the past year or so I have found that I don't enjoy the movies that get ""Thumbs up"". If I want to see ""real life"", I'll look out the window. When I pay to see a movie I want to be  entertained. So I was expecting to like this movie (since critics didn't).  But what I saw was a movie that was extremely well acted by ALL involved, a  movie that was beautifully photographed (with some amazing shots  throughout)and a truly brave story line that was sure to alienate a HUGE  market share.
I can't possibly imagine what the critics did not like  about this well paced, well acted thriller.
At the least it is the most  underrated movie of the year.
One note...Inside the booklet that comes in  the DVD case, there is a letter from the Director. It explains that the DVD  comes with an alternate ending, and to please watch the entire movie WITH  the alternate ending (as opposed to watching the alternate ending as a  seperate scene after viewing the theatrical version). And sure enough, when  you click ""play movie"" from the main menu, you must make a  choice. Go with the directors cut. I viewed the theatrical ending after I  watched the directors cut, and the film lost it's impact.
The transfer to  DVD is excellent, and the sound is fine. There is nothing muddy or muddled  about this movie. And although the subject of stigmata has been handled  before,I guarantee that you have never seen it handled like this. I was  thoroughly entertained from start to finish by this fine movie. If you are  on the fence about buying stigmata, go for it. It's the best thriller I  have seen in a while.",951782400,98,1607,4.438356164383562

See people wanted to compaire this to The Exorcist, or came to the theaters wanting to see The Exorcist. Or They came exspecting a Horror  Movie. When they found out it wasn't a horror movie, more of a Mystery  Thriller, they were just so disapointed they couldn't help it.
The  Exorcist is my favoirt Horror movie. And I didn't go looking for The  Exorcist feel... you know why? STIGMATA IS A WHOLE DIFFERN'T  SUBJECT!
This film has SOME GREAT ACTING! well not from the teen's of the  film.  but that is to be exspected. The only TRUE problem I see that is a  Major put down to the film is it is more MTV related... and that was a let  down.
Anyways 3 Stars is what I give it.. maby more of a 3 Star and a  Half. but the most I'll go is 4 stars.

Gabriel Byrne (an Irish favorite). ""How is your  faith Catholic Church?"" should be the quote since the faith was on  trial and rightfully so. The writer, undoubtedly prophetic, stated, in a  literary way, through a lost Gospel written in Aramaic by Jesus Christ,  that God is inside of us and we need no go- between but Christ himself.  Sacrilege may have been the intention of the filmmakers, some have said,  but, truth be told, it ended up being the truth--God is in us not in a  church. Brilliant directing, fine acting, and another fine portrayal by  Jonathan Pyrce. Loved every minute of the film and so will you--if, of  course, you have the faith.

1064360,4,6305718903,"First of all....I really liked it. While many of you may be turned off imediately by a film with a title like ""Stigmata"", this is a great film. Stigmata is about persons with a deep religious faith who take  on the outward signs of crusifixtion as Christ did. These people develop  thorn cuts on their heads, bleed from the hands and feet, and wounds in  their side. This is a film that brings elements of possible demonic  possessions with the response of the Catholic Church. At times the audience  may wince at the gore but also be entertained at how it is presented. As I  sat watching this film, I wondered what I would do if I encountered a  person floating in the air hanging on an imaginary cross....would calling  911 bring the relief or help I seek? I could just imagine a Milwaukee cop  showing up and quickly leaving (but still having enough time to stop and  give me a parking ticket first.) This film will cause you to wonder....do  these things really happen? Do other religions other than Catholics have  stigmatas, and how come they don't make movies with non-Catholic priests  responding....here comes Jim or Tammy Faye to take care of a demon, now  that might sell. The film is well done, it keeps your attention, it  challenges you, and is well acted and filmed.

I left the theater with my jaw hanging and eyes gaping at how good it really was.  As  always, Gabriel Byrne has a way of pulling you into the film and into the  feelings of the characters....especially his. Through his character who is  a Catholic Preist, I FELT his struggle with love and religion - both common  struggles to anyone who has a heart, soul, or brain.  I never found any  fault with ANYTHING that happened in the movie, like the fact that if  Patricia Arquette was posessed by a holy Saint, I don't think he would be  trying to seduce Father Kiernan (Byrne).  No one who nitpicks EVER enjoys a  movie!  Some things to enjoy: the artistic direction was beautiful in a  creepy, X-files sort of way and they couldn't have picked someone better  than Billy Corgan to compose music. (My favorite band is the Smashing  Pumpkins, favorite Actor - Gabriel Byrne...you can see how I loved this  movie!) Corgan added an extra demension to the film as I kept thinking I  heard heartbeats coming from the back of the theater. The main thing that  attracted me to this movie (Byrne aside) was all the commotion surrounding  the ""bad rep"" that Catholics were given.  I personally found it  funny that, as a whole, they spend too much of their time dishing it out to  others but they can't take it themselves.  This movie is like a government  conspiracy only it involves corruption among a sanction of society that  undoubtedly has INFINITELY more power than the government - the religious  institutions. As with all conspiracy movies, all I have to say is that it  really makes you think....",949881600,22,1732,4.608552631578948
