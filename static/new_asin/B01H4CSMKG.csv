8764672,4,B01H4CSMKG,"It's good for what it is. What it is about will depend on everyone's individual point of view, which in turn will depend on your history. For anyone who grew up in a weird, crazy, or abusive family, I think you'll get the message just fine.",1530316800,,240,4.239130434782608
8764673,5,B01H4CSMKG,"Yes this film is completely random,  Bizzarre and leaves you with a bunch of questions but isn't that what you want to feel after a movie? Everything was perfect about this film. Obviously the actors all nailed it. But the lighting was perfect and so was the shading. I love how the wife getting hotter and hotter every scene that goes on. I believe they did that on purpose. Now I don't wanna give away anything important so all else I'll say is  this is a thriller that doesn't really start becoming a phychological thriller till about 30 to 45 minutes into the film.  I'd suggest this film to anyone of any age because it's not violent or vulgar. It really is a must watch!",1492560000,,676,4.392
8764674,3,B01H4CSMKG,"This is a film that tells you what is going on, yet I had no idea. Pit Bukowski plays ""the student"" who rents a room at The Bunker for peace and solitude for his work which looks like scribbling, but clearly is something deeper. He is short on his rent money and eventually it is agreed upon he is to teach their son Klaus (Daniel Fripan) for the shortcoming. Klaus is to grow up to be President, yet doesn't have the sense or social graces to be functional in society. Mom (Oona von Maydell) at the risk of giving too much away (30 minute PLOT SPOILER) talks to Heinrich who has moved into her through her leg. He is a great leader from a distant Galaxy here to...who knows but he got sick and moved in her body. Knowing all of this didn't make my understanding of the film any better. Father (David Scheller) is well educated and clearly he sees what is going on...but maybe he doesn't.

The film was engrossing and somewhat entertaining, but I felt lost like Klaus.

8764675,3,B01H4CSMKG,"I liked this film, and appreciated all the thought that the director put into it, as well as the DVD edition I got (the special features are nice; commentary made by the director in English, and over fifteen minutes of deleted scenes--some of which explain more of the film). There are some somewhat clear flashbacks to Dario Argento's stuff, some of them apparently due to mechanical problems (cameras filming in red), and there's quite a bit of heart to the film, with interesting bouts of humor.

I agree with the other reviewer that said that there are many questions left after watching, though I have come to understand the director left it open-ended on purpose (and I suspected as much). I would say that I disagree with some of the director's/editor's choices in deleted scenes. There are at least two scenes that it pains me that weren't included in the film because they really would have helped tie the film together (one gives us better insight into the father, and his ""drugged-out"" behaviour in one of the last scenes, and the other includes a line about Jesus giving away his coat that foreshadows and frames one of the last bits of the film perfectly. It just kills me that they cut this out, as the film isn't too long to begin with. They could've kept 90% of the deleted scenes in and it would've still been a fine, and possibly better, film.

All-in-all, it was an interesting film to watch, and  one that I waited for eagerly; the director's commentary that we skimmed over was engaging as well. It just seemed that the film was missing something that would have made it great. Also, for those that are watching it and having trouble; I think the beginning feels a bit slow.",1472169600,4,1695,4.6245847176079735
8764676,3,B01H4CSMKG,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for my honest review

When it comes to quirky films, few directors can pull them off with finesse and ease.  Many times, such movies are not written well, therefore they fall flat and just wind up in mediocrity-hell.  But every now and then, a film comes along that surprises and entertains, yet still falls a bit short of being great.  This is the state in which I have to categorize DER BUNKER.  While I found it fun and entertaining for the most part, I felt a pang of disappointment as the film ended; not because it was over, but because so much was left unfinished.  The result has left me on the fence about my perception of the movie and how to describe it.

I hate to say anything negative about this film, as it has a lot of heart and intelligence.  But in the end, I watch films for entertainment and do NOT base my opinions on artistic merit.  I know some reviewers put stock into that, but I do not for the most part.

DER BUNKER is shot very well and looks great onscreen.  I like how homey the underground dwelling is made to look; in many scenes, you cannot tell the family is underground at all.

The acting is great, with Daniel Fripan stealing the show as Klaus, the 8-year old who is being groomed for our next President.  Fripan is actually a 30+ year-old man, and he definitely looks it.  The absurdity of such a casting choice is perfect here, and it makes the ridiculousness of the plot even more fun.  Fripan is joined by Pit Bukowski, who portrays his mentor.  I previously saw Bukowski in DER SAMURAI, another Artsploitation feature.  Bukowski once again does a fantastic job with his role.

The story in DER BUNKER is where I have issues.  Granted, films of this nature don't have to have much of a plot per se to be funbut this one actually opens several subplots that it never finishes.  If such effort is going to be put into them (as you will see), I feel like I need to have more information to finish them out.  Instead, we are left hanging.  **SPOILER ALERT**  (stop reading here if you do not want to know plot-points).  For example, the alien living in Klaus moms leg is never fleshed out (sorry for the pun), nor is anything ever explained about it.  Why even bring it up?  Also, the ending is too bizarre for me.  Why do Klaus mom and dad not go after him?  What 8-year old boy can fend for himself in the world?

But with these issues aside, I did enjoy DER BUNKER overall, so I suppose I can recommend it.  If you're looking for sensibility, however, I would step past this one.  Otherwise, strap on your crash-helmet and settle in for a weird ride.",1472083200,,2641,4.350409836065574
