2571664,5,B000FL7CB4,"I can hardly wait for this DVD. I can finally dump the series  from my DVR. Because they aren't going anywhere until I have them on DVD.

Man, I miss this show! Anyone for a Comeback of The Comback?",1149724800,13,198,4.051282051282051
2571665,5,B000FL7CB4,"Oh I just loved this show!  So much so that many Valerie-isms have been adopted into my personal life, including putting my hands together as a way to say thank you, the term ""Note to self, I didn't need to SEE (or hear, smell, taste, etc) that!"", and describing boring things politely as ""fun...it's fun"".  An all-time favorite!!!",1148688000,11,331,4.689655172413793
2571666,5,B000FL7CB4,"This was one of the best series ever. Lisa Kudrow was brilliant in it. Valerie Cherish- one time a-list TV star is making a comeback as a supporting character on another sitcom. At the same time she is doing a reality documentary about her comeback. Some did not find it overtly funny(You have to actually watch it- the jokes don't fly out and hit you in the face) enough, but I have to tell you that I laughed almost to the point of incontinence on several occasions. And I loved Valerie. She always tried to do the right thing, but it was just so hard! Her sidelong glances at the camera documenting and yet, another embarrassing moment were hysterical. Taken from raw (unedited)footage of the documentary, this show captured some great ""unintentional"" moments. I loved every episode. HBO did not give this show enough time to develop, cancelling it after one short season. BAD HBO! Valerie had much more to say and I think the show would have developed into another ""Sex and the City"" if it were given time to flourish. But no for HBO- let's release another ""Sex and the City"" gift set or another season of One Night Stand with mediocre stand up comedy. Release them on DVD or not, I don't care. I have my set and I will treasure them. But I will buy them if you do.",1148515200,13,1269,4.450643776824034

2571697,4,B000FL7CB4,"Another reviewer nailed the one problem with this: it's painful to watch. I have no idea what a ""celebrity"" lifestyle is really like, but I do remember living in Arizona around a group of wealthy women who struggled with losing their youth and relevance. This made me think of that experience. Though it really is more painful than enjoyable, I can't quit watching because it feels like having a window on a whole other plane of society. I keep wondering how realistic this is - and imagine it must be since Kudrow has ""insider info"" on the lifestyle. If this is what that world is like, my heart goes out to people living in it.",1501804800,,629,4.478260869565218

2571699,5,B000FL7CB4,"Brava to Lisa Kudrow!  I came to this season of The Comeback having only seen Kudrow in Friends.  As an industry professional myself, I thought it would be fun to see a take-off on what happens behind-the-scenes in the development of a new show.  The Comeback: Season 1 is spot on.  The characters are people I've met through the years.  But what's great here, is what Kudrow brings to her part.  She is poignant, she is kind, she is insecure.  She lets us see every facet of her and in ultra-brave performance.  I highly recommend this season and am so glad to learn that after a ""hiatus"" of years, it is coming back.  Congratulations, Lisa - I'm sorry it took so long for me to catch up with what you are doing!",1498003200,,713,4.340909090909091

2571701,5,B000FL7CB4,"Binge-watchable just watched season 1, spoilers ahead:
Lisa Kudrow does an amazing character study as Valerie Cherish a sitcom actress aiming for a comeback taping a reality show while playing second fiddle on a new sitcom with an antagonist slob show runner. I like how they demystify showbiz and humanizes tv stars as real people & the Valerie Cherish character reminds me of a gung-ho 1940's actress and you'll cheer as Valerie is redeemed at the end of season 1.",1490054400,,466,4.8375

I actually feel to sorry for the ""aging"" actress trying so hard to be part of a sophomoric 20-something comedy that is not funny. And the reality show overwrite just makes the whole situation more pitiful.",1483833600,,360,4.013888888888889
2571718,4,B000FL7CB4,"This show is really quite good, but, painful to watch.  Painful the way the British Office is painful.  Good acting, good plot, good writing.  But, the humiliation that Valerie has to endure, and she does it very well, makes me hurt.  Especially as I'm in her age group and understand too well how after a certain age you can be easily written off.  The Office was great, but, I winced so often when Ricky Gervais' character (can't remember his name now) made his many inane comments and actions.  So, I recommend The Comeback, but, especially if you're over 40, you might feel the pain too!",1482969600,9,591,4.580952380952381

2571726,5,B000FL7CB4,I have only watched the first episode but it was really funny. I never appreciated the talent of Lisa Kudrow. She seems so natural in this quirky comedy. It's worth a look.,1481500800,,172,4.40625
2571737,5,B000FL7CB4,Awesome series.  Lisa Kudrow is a genius.,1481500800,,41,4.857142857142857
2571738,2,B000FL7CB4,"Spoiler alert - kind of.  Lisa Kudrow is brilliant and talented and it was sad to see her play a character who is so unredeemable.  Her character, Valerie Cherish, never shows a shred of interest in anyone else or any glimmer of self-awareness.  I watched the first three episodes and then skipped to the Season One finale to see if there was any glimmer of hope for her, any realization, any change.  Not.  Instead she is more entrenched than ever in the horrible life she is living.  It is completely unbelievable that someone as shallow, selfish, and seemingly unintelligent as Valerie would have the smart caring loving patient husband portrayed here.  It is a smart show and we are probably supposed to see some kind of satirical commentary on reality TV and the audiences who love it.  I couldn't see it that way.  Instead I found it disturbing that it followed the industry's convention of putting a beautiful talented actress in situations where she is ridiculous and her sexuality is supposed to be humiliating (think Terry Hatcher on the stripper's pole in Desperate Housewives, or Sarah Jessica Parker's Carrie's drunken attempted-seduction of Berger in Michael Patrick King's own Sex and the City, or too many examples involving Diane Keaton) once she reaches a certain age.  The finale made me sad and a little bit horrified.  As for Kudrow's acting, the come-and-go Southern-type accent was a drawback.",1481414400,,1416,4.9576271186440675

2571746,1,B000FL7CB4,Boring and sort of depressing.  Perhaps too realistic a view of the business.

2571781,5,B000FL7CB4,"Genius!
I thought it was corny, boring and awkward at first like many other reviewers but then I realized Lisa Kudrow is truly brilliant and the writers knew exactly what they were doing. They reached deep into the guts comedy and writing to wrench up this gem. Season 1 of ""The Comeback"" runs like one long joke that if you walk away from too soon you'll miss it, but if you stay to the end you'll be glad you did.",1472688000,,415,4.2

2571785,5,B000FL7CB4,"Lisa Kudrow is such a fantastic actress.  While that makes this show almost painfully awkward to experience at times, it also is what makes it fantastic to watch.  If you're looking for a complex plot, this isn't your show, but that's the whole point of it - showing how vapid and empty our ""reality"" TV culture is.",1470700800,,315,4.508771929824562
2571796,5,B000FL7CB4,"I only heard about this show not long ago through an advertisement on the radio but didn't think much of it. Then while browsing the shows on Amazon, it caught my attention since so I decided to watch the pilot for season 1. I was immediately hooked and had to binge-watch the whole season! Then I found out it was originally released in 2005! I was mind-blown that it had been that long ago! Why didn't I know about this show sooner? Except for the flip phones, the show still looks current. I'm glad I finally got to watch this hidden gem thanks to Amazon! The cast is great, well-acted, all characters have their own personality but definitely Lisa Kudrow shines as our heroine Valerie! This comedy is a brilliant parody of the making of a reality show. Highly recommend.",1469923200,4,774,4.535714285714286
2571797,1,B000FL7CB4,"I couldn't get through two episodes. I love Lisa Kudrow, but the character she played was so awkward and out of touch it.

2571798,4,B000FL7CB4,Fun show to watch. Lisa Kudrow is does a great job of showing the main character balancing her feelings of being a seasoned success with her obviously out-of-date nervous interactions with those around her.

I feel her pain, so I can't laugh much, maybe a little, here and there, but not enough to know it was supposed to be a comedy.  I had to go read the description to find out for sure that this is a comedy, or at least, that it's intended to be.  I think it's pretty real.  There actually are actors who are so into trying to maintain a level of fame that they have lost touch with reality, and they live only in the past.  I would give it 5 stars for realism, but unfortunately, can't give that many for funny, as it's not that much.",1463443200,3,643,3.945736434108527

2571954,5,B000FL7CB4,"The Comeback Season 1 tv series stars Lisa Kudrow as the character of actress Valerie Cherish living in Los Angeles, California. The character of Valerie Cherish is determined to regain her career mojo and blaze a phoenix-like rise back to professional/career success for herself. I also noticed that Malin Akerman (I recognized her from the Billions tv series and the Trophy Wife tv series)is also in the Comeback tv series As Juna Millken. The character of Milken proves to fit in perfectly with what is expected for her superstardom role. Both the characters of Millken and Cherish get along well professionally, but Millken seems unaware of how Cherish secretly wishes that she were as popular and successful as Millken. As an aspiring writer, I enjoyed the angle demonstrated on the lengths a celebrity may go through in order to understandably stage a professional comeback.",1455062400,,880,5.118055555555555

It is like knowing there is a horrific car accident that you don't want to look at, but you look at it anyway. The writing is great and portrays what, I believe, most ""reality TV"" shows are like.  For the most part, I spent most of my time wishing Kudrow's character would just have a real moment and quit being so fake.

Her future in Hollywood is dependent on the reality show that is being filmed of her life and current small role on a TV show.

Lisa Kudrow pokes fun at reality TV shows by playing an actress on the downside of her career attempting a comeback while being followed 24-7 by a camera crew.  She does a good job with the part, but I'm not comfortable with the the whole concept of awkward confrontation entertainment.  The humor in the show comes from the twenty-something stars of her comeback vehicle simultaneously seeing her as the seasoned veteran and over-the-hill has-been while the show's execs view her as an overbearing pain who won't take direction and play the part of background furniture in which she's been cast.

What I liked most about this series is Lisa Kudrows devine display of an insecure actress trying as best as she can to hide her constantly hurt feelings from being exposed.  Kudos to Kudrow!  The subtleties of her expressions hint at feelings of betrayal - while her glib brush-offs of perceived slights truly do feel most believable.  In this day of glorified ""Reality"" shows, The Comeback really does poke a twisted, splintery stick in the eye of any viewer who is idiotic enough to believe that their is really anything ""legit"" about the genre.

What I didn't like was that the story began to feel stale fairly quickly.  I understand the show is coming back after an exceptionally long hiatus so I am hearing this to what I'd like to see in the new material.  Valerie Cherish needs to be a bit more sympathetic so that the viewers (like me) stay engaged with her.  I found myself nodding off because this first season didn't engage me.  I wasn't rooting for anyone.

Also I did not like Lisa's obnoxious voice when she visited Jane in the country house with the horses. She was pretty insensitive but also rather obnoxious. She was not that way all of the time otherwise. She showed empathy on occasion. She does say the wrong things to the wrong people as part of her character. There are some truly funny scenes. I did not care for the writers making fund of her with a broom handle suggesting a lewd action. . This seemed a little sophomoric but also pretty awful.

2573110,5,B000FL7CB4,"I remember seeing this when it first came on HBO and when it got cancelled being totally flummoxed. How does something this brilliant get cancelled? But maybe all it really needed was 13 episodes. In the decade since Lisa Kudrow filmed the show, 40-something women in Hollywood may have gotten more sexual and attractive (thank you, Botox) but their roles certainly haven't changed. Yep, it's still the town where 50-something actors are routinely paired up with 20-something actresses as their love interests. In fact, it may have gotten worse. Kudrow was willing to dive into how Hollywood completely desexualizes women in their sexual prime -- the scene where she's forced to stand stiffly behind her younger costars in a garish pink track suit while shooed away from the fun and told to look ""disapprovingly"" at them is classic. In reality, Lisa has a better body than her younger costars, but she's forced to cover up and utter lines like ""The last time I was licked like that was 1942."" Kudrow was totally game for this type of humiliation and her character, Valerie Cherish, swallows it in order to stay in the game -- though she does subtly fight back. I was glad to hear that Chris (Kellan Lutz) hits on her in Season 2 because I kept waiting for that in Season 1. Despite Valerie's flaws, and there are many, you keep rooting for her because she just refuses to disappear, the way Hollywood wants any woman over 35 to do. (Thank goodness for TV, where woman ""of a certain age"" are still allowed to be complex and desirable.)",1425600000,,1534,4.70631970260223

Maybe I wasn't sure of what to expect with this show, or I thought it would be something different. But after watching this and the full second season as well, I grew to like the show and the character of Valerie Cherish, along with some of the other regulars. It's a mockumentary reality show following a washed-up former Tv actress trying to make her comeback with her own reality show and with a bit part on a new sitcom show that's geared toward the teenage-20 something demographic. We follow Cherish through her struggles in the industry and with adjusting to camera crews constantly following her around and how it affects her life and relationships.

Plus I was NOT a fan of the television show Friends (my bad I guess) so I decided NOT to watch. However, when The Comeback was picked-up for a second season, a decade later, I was intrigued to know why. There have been several, solid T.V. shows that were canceled before they had a chance to catch on; mainly because of the increase in the number of networks producing television shows and integration of streaming services. (Happy Endings...now Selfie...the disappointment is fanatical)  Anyhow, I wanted to know why this show? Why now? Lisa Kudrow has had some great movie roles after Friends and she's really funny on Web Therapy. So I decided to watch the first episode just to see what I'd missed and I couldn't stop watching, the show's self deprecating humor was funny; I loved it.

I only watched the first 3 episodes of season 1 and jumped to season 2 in hopes that a 9 year hiatus would mean a revamp of sorts. Season 2 is no different.

I watched it 10 years ago when it first aired and fell in love with it. Ever since then I have incorporated Valerie Cherish's lingo into my daily vocabulary. I'm always saying, ""Awwwww baby girl"", ""I don't need to see that,"" ""Marky Mark,"" ""Spider eyes,"" ""I need to know known that I'm being heard,""....  Everyone will love this show. I've shown it to friends when they come over and everyone is instantly hooked. I don't know if it's the embarrassment I feel for Valerie's embarrassing actions and the awesomeness of how she changes awkward situations to her benefit to feed her constant self absorbed insecure ego? It's so hard to explain!  Now I'm ready to watch the new 2014 season. I have 5 episodes on DVR.  Gonna be a great ""Cherished"" Christmas.  """"""Now please enjoy.... THE COMEBACK! ......

She was the center of attention and had the opportunity to do some comedic things that would have been too out of character for Phoebe. This is done as a ""documentary"" with the crew a bit contemptuous of the job they have to do, but by the end a begrudging understanding begins to form between the has-been star and the director. It is sometimes uncomfortable to watch Valerie Cherish's eternal optimism in the face of snotty writers and bit players, but you will love her for trying so hard against all odds. This is one of my all time favorite shows and would love to see a second season.

2574154,2,B000FL7CB4,"I sorta enjoyed the first episode of ""The Comeback"".  She was a dumb blonde with more confidence than her talents justified, who kept jockeying for more exposure and attention, and blind to the rejection she kept receiving.

One can laugh at her, because it's somewhere we've all been, albeit hopefully not as obviously as her.

By the third episode it was painful to watch this attention whore. I suppose a lot of bored kids have taken the wings off a fly, amused to see it struggle - and maybe a second fly, only to figure out that it offers little of amusement.  It's the ones that keep on with a third fly and a fourth that one starts to wonder if this is where congressmen and banksters come from.

Flies are just flies, after all, and we swat them without a thought.  And the star of ""The Comebaqck"" is a fictional character, but someone who keeps watching this ""one trick pony"" of a show needs to get hooked on a good novelisrt.  Dick Francis, perhaps, or John Grisham.

There's a story of the guy who walks into his bedroom to find his nest friend in bed with his wife.  ""I *have* to,"" he explains, ""She's may wife!  But why YO?""

In another layer she is the focus of a Reality TV show with a unit following her around as she goes from home to the studio each day.

In attempting to insert her experience and charm into the work-a-day set of actors, writers, directors and producers she becomes the butt of many jokes as the old lady who doesnt fit any longer.

Lisa manages to meet each obstacle with a smile that is not quite hiding the hurt that lies beneath the surface.

I remember seeing an interview once with Mary Tyler Moore, and she was singing the praises of Ted Knight, saying how he managed to make the basically unlikeable character of Ted Baxter LOVABLE.  And this is what Lisa does for Valerie Cherish.  Yes, she's self-centered, narcissistic, and a little absentminded.  Like telling her friend Mickey to ""put a pin in it"" in the middle of a story he's telling, or doing take after take of relating to the viewing audience on how her stepdaughter is finally starting to warm up to her (and being too self-involved to realize that her stepdaughter simply wants to be on a reality show, too).

But underneath it all, there are glimpses of a woman who's so insecure, she really just wants everyone to like her.  Underneath it all, she's still that girl on the girl's field hockey team in high school, smarting at how they ""wouldn't let her be in the picture"" for yearbook.  Heck, even Jane-The-Producer got teary eyed over that one.  Lisa Kudrow lets us in on those little details, those little glimpses, and makes a basically unlikeable character LOVABLE.

2574590,5,B000FL7CB4,"Like other well-crafted comedies of recent vintage made for viewers who appreciate sharply defined characters suffering from human conditions -- think ""Arrested Development"" -- THE COMEBACK offers extremely funny circumstances built around the pathetic and often failed attempts to attain the unattainable.
This show won't probably be appreciated by audiences who prefer the ""hit them over the head"" type of sitcoms seen mostly on CBS-TV in the past few years. Instead THE COMEBACK plays best to more discerning comedy fans who want more mature (if not adult)
writing, pacing and flair that has been the hallmark of modern efforts such as ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" and ""Veep"" on HBO and ""30 Rock,"" ""The Office"" and ""Parks And Recreation"" on NBC. These shows are all quirky and fun, but not slapstick.
The great writers from the Greeks to Shakespeare and today know that there is a fine line between tragedy and humor. Indeed,
Lisa Kudrow's fictional character here is obsessive and narcisstic and doomed to fail. Yet, she never gives up and has a husband who loves her and caring friends to support her in her quest to reclaim fame. Ultimately it's a positive tale and full of laught for those with a fine taste for parody and pathos.",1415404800,,1231,4.951690821256038

Honestly, it was pretty tough for me to go through the pilot episode and the first few. I was confused and utterly not entertained because of the whole ""reality show"" element. In addition, who loves watching the protagonist of the show as a mid-aged, try-too-hard, stiff-minded and overall-boring comeback actress? It is just depressing. It was depressing for me, but then I realized this was never meant to be a light-hearted brainless comedy like the ""Room and Board"" show-in-show. It brought me to tears at the last episode of season 1, when the plot took a final twist and I could relate to the character's confusion and mixed feelings. It appeared pretty realistic to me, including the irony of the reality of the show business, or the contemporary world that we are in. Not intending to spoil it for anyone, so I used a lot of big words-if you can get it, you will, after watching the show. This show is not for a laugh.
By the way, great cast, great performance, and great character developments. Lisa appeared Phoebe-quirky often, but it surely was a depressing and that was a great job. Great job to those characters who are meant to be like-able or unlike-able respectively.",1414800000,,1332,4.554166666666666

I understand that there are people like this in the real world but they aren't interesting to watch at all. The actor does a great job of being incredibly unlikable but the real writers of the show needed to create another side to him. His hatred for Kudrow is not funny, it's just very cruel. It's hard to laugh at Kudrow's character when she is treated so badly for no reason. Couldn't the real writers have given this guy less of an edge or at least some reason for his hatred? I just don't understand. Are we supposed to think someone this awful is funny? Nothing against the actor himself. This is a writing problem. It really draws away from what should be a very good show.

2574663,5,B000FL7CB4,"I was both surprised and delighted that HBO saw the error of its ways and decided to give ""The Comeback"" a comeback and I can't wait for the new episodes. This show was ahead of its time in predicting how reality television would continue to swallow up a huge chunk of available air time (although it's nice to see that scripted tv has made its own comeback in the past few years, thanks to some brilliant shows). The writing and directing here are spot-on and Lisa Kudrow is genius. It's also laudable that she was willing to play such an unattractive character - unattractive in the sense that Valerie Cherish almost gives new meaning to the term self-absorbed - and then let the character suffer the humiliation she goes through trying to re-grab that brass ring in Hollywood. If you haven't seen the show but you're put off by shows/characters that have uncomfortable stretches of embarrassment on a regular basis (Larry David/""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" for example) - you might not respond to ""The Comeback."" If you enjoy smart writing and a strong cast anchored by a star turn from Ms. Kudrow AND have a snarky sense of humor to boot, grab the popcorn and settle in for a great evening.

P.S. In perusing the reviews here, it's clear that the show just clearly wasn't some people's cup of tea - and that's fine. But really, in all the dreck that's on television, THIS is what you give 1 star?",1414022400,,1395,4.602409638554217

It's a brilliant critique of the current state of TV and of the American culture of celebrity, especially of puerile comedies and reality shows. Lisa is exquisite in the role; the insecurity, pride, pain, and resilience of Valerie come across in every scene. Valerie is treated horribly by the television industry, but refuses to let go of her self-image as the ""it"" girl of sitcoms. This isn't really a comedy, which is why people think it's a boring comedy. It's more of a serious art show. Oh, and Mickey, her hairdresser, is a very touching character. Great cast, strong writing.

2574969,5,B000FL7CB4,"Lisa Kudrow was always funny.  The first time we saw her she was playing a ditsy waitress, Ursala Buffay, in ""Mad About You"", and then she was cast as Ursala's equally ditsy twin, Phoebe Buffay in the long-running ""Friends"".  She was hilarious and touching in both roles.  In ""The Comeback"" she is playing her own alter-ego, Val, who much like herself has had a long-running hit series and finds herself suddenly middle-aged and looking for a way forward in her career.  She becomes the star of one of those reality shows where a film crew comes to her home and monitors her and her family 24/7.  Concurrently, she lands a role on a new scripted TV series, but this time, as the meddlesome Aunt Sassy, landlady to a bunch of 20 year-olds. (If you're old enough, think ""Three's Company"".)  In this role she is totally eclipsed by the young, ""hot"" female lead, Juna and her buddies and bullied by the young, ""hipper-than-thou"" writer and the older and more polished ""hipper-than-thou"" producer.  Poor Val.  Her only staunch companion turns out to be her hair stylist, Mickey, who's been with her through all her incarnations.  Her husband and step-daughter, meanwhile, must quietly endure the hardships of being constantly under the scrutiny of Jane, the deadpan camera operator tracking every slip of the tongue, every faux pas, every embarrassing private moment. While Val can be vain, egocentric and tone deaf to others' sensibilities - cocooned as she is in the privileged life of a celebrity - she can also be extremely vulnerable, and you find yourself rooting for her, wishing someone  would cut her a break.  On top of all of the abuse from without, many of Val's wounds are self-inflicted.  She has a knack for saying the wrong thing at the wrong time, then realizing her mistake just a bit too late.  Still, she bounces back from every humiliation with a kind of courage and grit I can't help but admire.  Kudos!",1408752000,,1920,4.778787878787878

I think the problem then (as now, judging from the smattering of 1-star reviews), is it was a little ""too original"" for those that need a laugh track.  You know the type.  They're the same people who think THE BIG BANG THEORY is high comedy.  The exact audience ROOM AND BOARD would have targeted.  Lisa Kudrow is perfect.  Anyone who thinks her acting in this is ""forced"" should stick with FRIENDS.

But if you can see a little Valerie in yourself (because she is in all of us), then this show will affirm our shared vulnerability and longing to be loved.

It was the precursor to many comedies that followed in which there is a conceit of a reality show in the works...Modern Family, The Office, Parks and Recreation.  In some ways, this show is a one trick pony.  You understand the basic premise that the show is about humiliation...as are most comedies in the faux reality format.  What saves this is that Lisa Kudrow does humiliation so well.  It's a shame that it only lasted one season, but it ends very satisfyingly as a self-contained entity.

I didn't hate the show, but rather felt somewhat uncomfortable for the main character. I gave it a shot and watched the next episode. I couldn't stop watching it and ended up seeing the entire season in one day. I watched the show probably 10 times more after that, and the more I see it, the more it grows on me. I can see why some people think it's the worst show ever though and I clearly see who those people are. If you are looking for a light comedy in lines of ""Friends"" (that's what you are probably expecting from the show seeing Lis Kudrow on the CD case), this show isn't quite what you are expecting. You are fan of Lisa, you will enjoy it anyway. I actually didn't think much of Lisa after seeing ""Friends"". Didn't think of her as a great actress whatsoever. I discovered Lisa's talent after ""The Comeback"" and then I re-watched ""Friends"" again, and realized how tremendously talented this actress is.
I am very mad at HBO for dropping the show. This show had so much potential. I hate business people who see only money and ratings. They miss the real gem stone chasing after green papers.

I saw some people accusing those who gave this show 5 stars, that they somehow related to the cast. I am not a friend of any cast member who worked on that show. English isn't even my first language.

Now flash forward 7 or 8 years later, Valarie is now married and has one ungrateful stepdaughter. She haven't had any roles and needs comeback. Finally a great role comes for her. She gets the supporting role as Aunt Sassy on the new sitcom Room and Bored. Thats not it, she has a camera crew following her around documenting her comeback.

2575452,4,B000FL7CB4,"I have to say that I found the first few episodes painful to watch, especially because I wasn't sure if I liked Valerie or not, but I'm glad that I hung in there. She's so desperate for approval and it's not easy to watch her go through all of the pain of trying to get back into show business in her early 40's.  If show business is as it's portrayed in this show, which seems likely since the whole show feels so real, it's a brutal industry to work in, particularly if you're not in your twenties.  Once you start to care about her, the show gets better because you start to root for her.  Plus I thought that the cast was superb, particularly her husband.  When you can't relate to anybody else, you can always relate to him.  I ended up very hooked on this show and sad to learn that it didn't get renewed for a second season.  The season finale was fantastic.  There was definitely more story to tell when it came to Valerie Cherish.

2575477,4,B000FL7CB4,"I went into ""The Comeback"" with somewhat of a reverse bias since I found ""Friends"" to be the most overrated sitcom in TV history and blame reality shows for the moral decay of modern society and totally despise them. But ""The Comeback"" skewers reality shows as well as giving viewers a delicious satire on behind-the-scenes Hollywood.

Lisa Kudrow plays Valerie Cherish, trying to make her big ""comeback"" on a new reality show that documents the early '90s sitcom star's struggle to land a new gig in a show called ""Room and Bored"".

Along for the ride are Val's put-upon businessman husband she affectionately calls Marky-Mark (Damian Young); her queeny hairdresser/best friend Mickey (Robert Michael Morris); and sweet, bubbly new young co-star Juna (Malin Akerman). Kellan Lutz (""Twilight"") appears in one of his first acting jobs.

Though Valerie is over-the-top in her quest for fame and constantly over-estimates her own importance, Kudrow gives the character subtle shadings so that you really do care about her, and as a result develop a loathing for the despicable slob writer Paulie G. (Lance Barber) who constantly treats her like a sub-human.

Since Kudrow's been in the business long enough to know, I suspect that the line between satire and Hollywood reality became blurred and you have to wonder how much of this actually happens in real life.

2575483,5,B000FL7CB4,"I have just so much love for this too short lived masterpiece of a show. I am so surprised that HBO cut the cord so soon on this great show.
I think maybe this show was born ahead of It's time by just a year or two. If this show was shown today I think It probably would had been a better hit. The real reality shows of today play out almost exactly to how this parody satires them, no matter what reality show I stumble upon as I surf through the channels, this show pops up in my mind admittedly. This show has so much replay value as I re watched this DVD set more than any of my discs in my whole library. Every cast member is just perfect combined with some genius writing. I love this show!
I was never a big Kudrow fan until this show, she brings such life to her character you find yourself believing that there really is a Valarie Cherish. IMO Kudrow's best work is seen here in ""The Comeback""

Now for this DVD set by HBO, I have some disappointments, though the picture and sound are just fine. I am not pleased that a play all feature wasn't included.
All the episodes are in the full frame format as filmed, don't understand why cause 16 X 9 TV's had been around, so I wish this was widescreen. Extras contain fun and interesting commentaries with Kudrow and creator Michael Patrick King.
Two made special for this DVD set Valarie Cherish bits. Valarie in the dressing room of Dancing with the Stars was hysterical, but this just left me wanting more! More of the adventures of Valarie Cherish..curse you HBO!
On the last episode's commentary Mr. King talks about a lot of footage filmed for the Comeback that never got seen in the end..
I wish that deleted scenes were included on this set maybe on an additional disc, but maybe thats why they weren't..HBO didn't want to put anymore $ into this.

If you haven't purchased this set yet I suggest you do it soon.. I have a feeling HBO may knock it out of print soon, if they haven't already.

This Is in my list of one of the greatest television shows ever made, just so sad that it was prematurely halted, I have a feeling it would have even got better with the next season.

2575525,5,B000FL7CB4,"Having never been a fan of Friends, the only thing I'd seen Lisa Kudrow in was the comedy Romy & Michelle's High School Reunion (which is hilarious). I remember seeing her promote The Comeback on a few talk shows like The View and seeing bits and pieces of the show itself, but I didn't pay too much attention to it. Fast forward to summer 2009. I was cruising through the video store when I came across the dvds for a steal. A friend had just told me how much she enjoyed them and encouraged me to check it out for myself. I took her word for it and I'm so glad I did.

Lisa stars as Valerie Cherish (sounds like a porn star's name, huh?), former star of a fictional 90s sitcom called I'm It!, but now a washed up has-been. Looking for a role that will put her back on the A-list, Val is cast on a new sitcom called Room and Bored (it's like a sexualized version of Saved By the Bell with double the cheese). Originally led to believe her role will be that of a wise, sexy architect with plenty of screentime, she ends up playing Aunt Sassy, a frumpy landlord reduced to one short appearance every episode. Poor Val makes due with what she's got while cameras following her for her reality show (you get a cookie if you figured out it's also called The Comeback) capture scenes from her personal and professional life.

All of the characters are interesting, funny, and engaging. Val's loving husband Mark, whom she affectionately calls ""Marky Mark"" (Damian Young), is clearly uncomfortable with cameras invading their personal life, but puts up with it for his wife's sake. Her stepdaughter Francesca (Vanessa Marano), a ""too cool for school"" 12 year old obsessed with things like ""ciggys"" and the Atkins diet, pops up from time to time pretending to show interest in Valerie strictly for camera time. Thankfully she has her hairdresser and best friend Mickey (Robert Michael Morris) to lean on during tough times and stare at her awkwardly as she continually embarasses herself. She also (kinda) bonds with her 20 something co-stars. Starlet Juna Millken (Malin kerman) in particular. Executive producer Tom (Robert Bagnell) is kind to Valerie and tries to help her out when she needs it, but fellow producer Paulie G. (Lance Barber) makes it his mission to ignore and humiliate her whenever the opportunity presents itself. It takes her a long time to get the message, but she really gives him his comeuppance in one of the best laugh out loud scenes ever. Rounding out the cast is The Comeback's director Jane (Laura Silverman). She tries to keep her interactions with Val at a minimum with very few on-air appearances, but it's clear that she genuinely cares about her.

Lisa Kudrow's performance is brilliant. Valerie is clearly self-absorbed and seriously lacks self-awareness in her quest for a comeback and makes a fool out of herself time and time again, but that also makes her humanity shine through. She's awkward and clumsy, but she's a sweet woman with a good heart underneath it all. Most of the episodes are comedic, but Lisa kills during the dramatic parts that will leave you feeling sorry for her and cheering her on even more. Plus, she has some of the best one liners. As odd as it might sound, it's a good thing HBO cut The Comeback after one season. It would've been interesting to see what direction season 2 would've taken, but the show comes full circle by the end. That's all the Val we need.",1278201600,4,3421,4.632619439868204

First of all, I want to preface this review with an important fact: I HAAAAATE Lisa Kudrow in Friends. Well, I shouldn't say that...I guess I just hated the character of Phoebe. I was always like ""We GET it, you're crazy and weird and ethereal and stupid"". So I wasn't actually looking forward to a whole show that centered around Lisa Kudrow ((because as I implied, I thought I didn't like Phoebe because of LK)). But OH MY GAWD is this show hilarious.

That being said, I'm a huge fan of the mockumentary feeling shows, which is what ""The Comeback"" is. I mean, it's a fake reality show, so you kind of get the same feel as ""The Office"" and ""Parks & Recreation""...very Christopher Guest ((""Waiting for Guffman"" is one of my absolute fave movies)). And it's totaly fluid too, you don't sit there thinking ""Wait that doesn't make sense with what happened before!"" ((which I, much to chagrin of my co-watchers, tend to do)).

So like I said it might help if I list shows I like that are similar. SNL is my absolute favorite show in the world, and of course ""The Office"". Also LOVE ""30 Rock"" and ""Family Guy"". I think you get the picture.

This show peels back the inner workings of a sitcom and the life of it's main character (Valerie Cherish)with hilarious results. What made it so compelling was the feeling, that it was drawn form reality with a dash of tongue in cheek thrown in; to keep it from becoming sad. The story is about an aging hollywood actress who made it BIg at one time and then faded into obscurity. She is cast in a new sitcom and is excited to revive her flagging career, only to find that she is in a supporting role and not the main character. what is worse, she is stripped of any good lines and as time goes by she becomes frumpier and frumpier.

Lisa Kudrow co-created and plays Valerie Cherish, a 'C-list' celebrity who starred in an ""Ally McBeal""-like hit series a few years back and desperately misses the fame and attention that came with that show. In an effort to get back on the magazine covers, she signs on to do a reality show about her 'Comeback' as she gets a new series, painfully bad but semi successful 'Room and Bored'. The insider depiction of the struggles and humiliations of an actress of a certain age desperately trying to hang onto her celebrity status is equal parts hysterically funny and heart-breaking.

Lisa Kudrow is FANTASTIC !  Though I never watched her on Friends, I have always liked her performances and thought she had a real 'comedic flair'.  For those (two people) who are unfamiliar with her talent, watching The Comeback will confirm my enthusiasm for her.

With no personal sense of vanity, Kudrow has 'attacked' her character Valerie with such insight and empathy that one can't help but be sympathetic to her character's struggles and experiences.

In the 'hands of a lesser talent' the story would be really inconsequential and uninteresting.  However, Kudrow brings Valerie alive with all her hopes / dreams / foibiles and sheer craziness that you can't help but laugh !

The series (unfortunately 'cut short' by, what I imagine is, the 'all boys club' management at HBO) is really a 'gem' and not to be missed.

P.S.  I recently saw Lisa in the movie Happy Endings and want to recommend that as well.  She (AND the movie) are really GREAT !",1194134400,3,1149,5.551724137931035
2575569,5,B000FL7CB4,"Lisa Kudrow proved definitively that she was the most talented actor of all the Friends after her Oscar-worthy performance (I know it's an overused expression, but really, she is THAT good) in The Opposite of Sex, and in The Comeback she blows everyone everyone everyone out of the water.

This is a very clever series, a tongue-in-cheek documentary style show based on the making of a documentary-style reality show. Yeah, wrap your mind around that. Anyway, Kudrow is phenomenal, in no small part because the writing she gets to work with (finally!) is worthy of her talent. Her antics are hysterical, but she can also break your heart into a million pieces with a single facial expression.

I especially appreciated the antagonistic dynamic between Valerie and the infamous TV writers' room.  It's not always fun to watch (the hijinks of 30 Rock are G-rated in comparison); it's at times shockingly realistic, dark, bitter, and also, weirdly, the funniest thing you will ever see on TV (or HBO, rather).

To the reviewers griping about HBO: Depressing as it is, this series sometimes drew less than 1 million viewers when it was on the air, so I can't blame HBO for canceling it, but I agree, what a loss for the few of us who were watching.

She's wants people to believe she's cool, calm and collected but most of the time she's freaking out about something ridiculous.  All of that said, you cant help but love her and want to see her succeed.

Kudrow in the role as Valerie is NOTHING like her role as Phoebe in Friends.  This only serves to show the woman's comedic (and in some cases, dramatic) range.  She makes Valerie Cherish feel like a real person and most of the time, its hard to imagine that Cherish and Phoebe were both played by the same woman.

The show itself is very funny and centers mainly on Valerie Cherish's acting comeback as she works playing a ridiculous older-woman-ish character on a sitcom.

I just wanted to say thank-you above to 'melodygoddess' for her AWESOME review of ""The Comeback"" DVD set. You have helped me better understand what an incredible impact that little show had on me. I rented it when it came out last summer and, as usual for me with any full -season dvd set, I finished it in one sitdown. Lisa as always blew me away...if ever there was a performance that screamed ""Emmy-award-NOW!"" this is IT.  I was so emotionally affected by it at first just how badly some people treated Valerie and just how far she would go to stand up for herself no matter what. I was even brought to tears several times watching - and I consider myself a guy already in touch with my emotions already! ""We don't NEED to see that!"" Valerie might even say. U

Upon buying it a month later I can appreciate so much more comedic stuff that I missed the first time just all the laughs in the awkwardness and reality-tv making world; the fun moments and the genuine friends/co-stars Valerie had all along like Mickey, Juna, her 'business-man' Marky-Mark, and above all, proving her heart at the last possible moment...Jane. And that last episode which is a roller coaster ride of a rush in itself..then playing ""Cherish"" as the last song during her final big return...just overwhelming for me how good it ended...I hope you can understand what I mean.

I am even going to be bold enough to state that if you enjoy ""Curb"" or ""The Office"" (British version especailly) then I am very confident you will enjoy this. Lisa Kudrow is perfect as the often oblivious Valerie Cherish and the reality show format works very well especially with Kudrow's Valerie Cherish not really getting the point of a reality show constantly telling the director, ""Time out, Jane."" The only shortcoming I can really pinpoint is that Valerie Cherish lacks a certain humanity. She should come off more sympathetic than she does but that complaint disappears by the end of the series. But in the beginning you don't know whether or not to feel sorry for her and laughing at the sad sack that is Valerie Cherish's life almost seems mean.

2575603,5,B000FL7CB4,"If your a fan of subtle, intelligent humor, you need to watch this fantastic series. Lisa Kudrow stars as Valerie Cherish,  in this show about a washed up actress who is desperate for a comeback. While filming for her new sitcom in which she ""stars"" as Aunt Sassy, she also has a crew of reality show cameras following her around, documenting her ""comeback"".

What the reality cameras see is a struggling actress who just can't get any respect. Every kind of humiliation comes Valerie's way in her quest to regain America's heart, the same people who gave her a people's choice award that she holds so dear to her.

Valerie soon became my favorite television character of 2006. Every awkward silence, uncomfortable glance at the camera add to this shows perfect use of subtlty as humor.

The production is intended to create a fake reality show of a decadent actress. It explores and ridicules the character, focusing on her pathetic and unlucky life. Too bad the scenes are too long, lots of blabbering, poor script, dull story and unintelligent jokes. You have to search for good takes, because this show isn't funny at all.

2575627,5,B000FL7CB4,"I am not fan of reality TV shows but I am HUGE fan of Lisa Kudrow. There is a cool distinction about her performance/presentation and I have seen most of her work. I was dying to see this DVD since I didn't have chance to see it on TV. I am not sure what could be an inspiration of creators and producers to make a show like this. I think it's incredibly original show. It's written perfectly and every scene is worked out in a detail. But is definitely NOT the show for massive audience.

When I watched the show for the very first time, I had a million mixed feelings. I was completely confused. I didn't know what to think about Valerie or the rest of the characters. After I have seen it more than once, I was able to pick up on more details that are written into the show. It is truly unique show on many levels.

Lisa's acting is absolutely amazing. She nailed completely every single line and scene. My favorite moments of the show are Valerie's ""personal video diary"" moments. There is so much irony in those. I cracked up on every one of them. The references she makes to pop-culture from the past are very refreshing and appropriate. The music used in the show is another plus.

I love character of Valerie Cherish. She has lots of qualities and great moral values. As an actress I think Valerie's fans are similar to Lisa Kudrow's fans. Valerie is a bit an outsider, uniquely beautiful and has THE BEST sense of humor. I love her comebacks - I think they are hysterical. Her facial expressions are SO funny in a way that makes her every scene original. Valerie is definitely someone that, in a real life, I would love to have around me. I don't think that Valerie's character is ""Anti-Phoebe's role"" in any way. Valerie is just NOT Phoebe.

The thing that threw me off a little, was Michael Patrick King's comment (in his commentary for the very last episode of the season), that Madonna ""stole Valerie's look for her last tour"". I guess he meant Madonna had red-hair look for the cover of COAD which was legendary Madonna/Steven Klein collaboration. I don't know what to think about that comment ...

So, to sum everything up, this show takes TV to another level. It's pushing an envelope ... Essentially, it had positive message. It would be ""thrilling"" if THE COMEBACK comes back to TV.",1161475200,3,2300,4.479713603818616
2575628,3,B000FL7CB4,"Recently,I was watching ""Ebert and Roeper"", when guest reviewer,Director Kevin Smith(Clerks), highly recommended this series. I decided to give it a try because I like Lisa Kudrow. Though I generally despise reality Tv shows,this is actually just a satire about reality shows so I was pretty sure I would like it anyway.

Lisa Kudrow(co-creator of this series and co-writer of the first two episodes) plays Valerie Cherish,a former Tv star,who although is very funny at times,is mostly such a weak and pathetic character [except for one great episode(#8)],that many people won't even get beyond the fourth episode.

The first 7 episodes of the ""The Comeback"" spend too much time playing the same one note over and over again. Valerie Cherish is pathetic. Okay,I get it. Though each episode is only about 26 to 30 minutes in length, many scenes go on for too long or are dull to begin with, so that any momentum that the show often develops, disappears quickly. Normally,scenes like this are deleted, but because this involves the filming of a reality show,before it's edited,they are left in so that we can feel like we're actually part of the film crew and we therefore often see too much of the mundane stuff that happens in Valerie's life.

Yes,Valerie's timeout thing with the film crew is funny,as are so many other subtle things she does,but she also watches paint dry and does other mind numbing things that tempted me to fast forward the Dvd. As Valerie would say,""I don't need to see that!"" However, I hung in there because I like Kudrow and hoped my pain would eventually subside. No pain,no gain,I kept thinking.

I survived the first 7 episodes of this 13 episode series because I like Lisa Kudrow rather than the mostly pathetic,sometimes dense,yet well-meaning Valerie Cherish character. However,I did chuckle and laugh often enough to keep me watching.

It's also important to note that the episode (#8) where Valerie Cherish visits Palm Springs and finally leaves the claustrophobic soundstage setting of her Tv sitcom ""Room and Bored"", behind, is an absolute gem!

The remaining final five episodes(#9-#13) are similar in tone to the first seven,but seem to have a bit more energy and more interesting plot points to follow(luckily less character development moments),so I feel they are all worthy of a B Grade,instead of the C Grade that the first seven deserve. They were also able to keep me much more interested and were much less painful to watch.

DVD EXTRAS:
Valerie After the Laughter: Valerie tries to film ""The Comeback"" Dvd Extras but keeps getting interrupted.
GRADE: B (Mostly cute,funny,typical Valerie)(8 minutes and 47 seconds long)

Valerie Backstage at Dancing with the Stars: No,you DON'T see Valerie dance. Instead she just mostly complains to Mickey,her gay hairdresser, while she's backstage,wearing a green, revealing outfit.
GRADE: C (only the last three minutes or so were funny enough to make me chuckle a few times,but because Mickey is always very good with Valerie,I still enjoyed it.) (6 minutes and 12 seconds long)

So,although the first 7 episodes might seem at times like you're watching the same episode over and over again,they still have many funny moments scattered throughout,and I laughed out loud several times.

It is so unfortunate that HBO chose not to bring it back. I never missed an episode, and ordered the DVD with all the wonderful extras and watch it everyday. As Kudrow said, after all the Emmy nods, no, they weren't crazy for what they created with this show, and yes, they were certainly on to something wonderful with this fantastic concept. I hope that the head honchos over at HBO change their minds and decide to bring this amazing show back. It was perfect. Everything was so right and so on point from start to finish.

In The Comeback I was always on Valarie's side, even though I don't think the vewier is supposed too.  I assume it was written to make you feel embarassed for the character, and you are, but sometimes you feel sorry for her and wind up rooting for her in her quest to regain her sit com legend status

I was really suprised by the quality of writing on the show and thought the the premature cancellation was unfair.  However, how would they have been able to keep coming up with ideas for that kind of documentary style concept. But within the 13 episodes they were able to create and complete the character arcs and maintain through-line and pathos for Valarie.

Overall I think the show was great while it lasted, and the emmy nominations should have cushioned the blow for being axed so early on.",1157500800,5,943,4.497076023391813

I loved it. It was so real and Lisa Kudrow's ability to act, not just pure comedy (like she did in ""Friends"") but Kudrow hits all the other emotional levels of a human being throughout these 13 amazing episodes. It was a delight to watch Kudrow's character, Valerie Cherish, grow up and mature (even as an older woman, character development was amazing).

Now don't even get me started on the special features! I wanted to call everyone I knew and be like ""hey did you know....""? There is a TON of bonus features, I think, since all the other boxsets I have don't compare in bonus feature material as this one does. The commentaries are terrific and there is one where Kudrow plays Valerie commentarying on the episode and that was real fun. There were two featurettes and that very well could have been part of episodes from season two. It was nice to see new material like that. And trailers!! I have never seen trailers on a DVD set before but there are, so that made me smile.

Lisa Kudrow plays Valerie Cherish who used to star on a show called I'm It and now is a has been.  To rekindle her career, she is doing a reality show called The Comeback.  The Comeback has cameras that follow her around almost 24/7 but mainly focuses on her new gig on a show called Room And Bored.  On Room And Bored, she plays an 'old hack' called Aunt Sassy to a group of young teenagers who live downstairs.

There are so many times when we feel for Valerie.  She is the only older cast mate so therefore she's not included when the gang go for dinner, she's relegated to the back of the photo shoot for the promotional material, there is that episode with Charla from The Amazing Race and doesn't fill the car with gas so Valerie runs for the bus and falls, she's the only cast member not invited to a particular party, ...  She really is a nice person (very Phoebe-ish; same mannerisms just more intelligent) who is not only trying to save her career, but trying to make her husband understand why the camera crew is always around and why she has to take calls during dinner.

It's a great show that I highly recommend.  It may take a little time to get used to - I have to say I didn't like the first episode, and only after the second did I start to really enjoy it, but it is worth watching.",1155340800,5,1504,4.205574912891986

I was very excited to see that this was going to be released on DVD, expecting a treasure trove of extras, etc. ""Valerie After the Laughter"" and the Dancing with the Stars segment were cute, but besides that and the commentary on a few of the episodes by Kudrow and King, it really left me wanting more behind-the-scenes material (i.e. interviews with the other cast members, more commentary, etc.).

She definitely deserves the Emmy nomination for this show. Watching all the emotions flash across her face as Valerie Cherish while still trying keep her composure and dignity is priceless.
 Valerie Cherish was a big sitcom star over 10 years ago. Now she is back from obscurity in a new sitcom and a reality show. The conflict begins when Valerie comes back to television only to find everything has changed from her glory days when she was on her hit sitcom, ""I'm It!"". Now being treated more like a ""has been"" than a star, she tries to adapt to the new situation which bring results that range from hilarious to heartbreaking at times. Totally unaware to the brutal ""warts and all"" approach to reality TV, Valerie is in for a big surprise when the first episode of her reality show, ""The Comeback"" first airs. What starts out as her worst nightmare ends up being her biggest dream!
I don't think some people ""get"" this show because it's not a straight forward comedy. It's different, wonderfully different!
 The commentaries by Lisa Kudrow and the creators on the DVD explain what they were tying to achieve with the show.
The one downfall of this show is after watching the last episode you are left wanting to watch more. And...there definitely could have been so much more with room for this character to grow and change over many seasons. Sadly, HBO yanked the plug without really giving it a chance. Now it ends up with Emmy nominations for Lead Actress in a Comedy, Best Directing in a Comedy. I also thought i heard it was nominated for Best Casting in a Comedy also.

2575650,5,B000FL7CB4,"One reviewer said, ""so funny it hurts."" I'd actually say ""hurts so much I couldn't laugh.""  Both as a writer and a performer Lisa Kudrow has shown she is absolutely brilliant.  Her character Valerie is a has-been with a stunning lack of awareness of herself and the industry that has passed her by.  Forced into a humiliating career choice which she believes will be her path back to A-list fame, Valerie despite her previous role is most definitely not it, but she is the only one not to know.

The pain begins as her character is progressively marginalized for younger, hipper Friendsoids.  Off screen her attempts to act as mentor and moral center to the cast come off excrutiatingly tone deaf and awkward.  A scene in which we learn that one of her co-stars, who Valerie considers green and ripe for training, is actually a well-seasoned veteran of another entertainment medium is almost tragic.

The supporting cast from her personal life is great.  Her loyal puppy of a clueless hairdresser almost steals the show, and her step daughter is brilliant.

This is a great, can't miss series, and Kudrow absolutely deserves an Emmy for this work, but don't curl up with it hoping for some charming laughs.  The material is painful and almost bitter, but worth every minute.",1154736000,16,1274,4.802752293577981

It's just too bad that HBO didn't have the nerve to keep it going. That being said, I don't feel too sad for the show. In one season, Valerie undergoes a pretty amazing arc. The last episode is a perfect end to the series. I would have loved to see more, but its a great package in and of itself.

I think the humor is something you either get or don't get. It's pretty subtle most of the time. Lisa Kudrow can send me into a fit of laughter with one twinge of her face in a reaction shot. It took me a few episodes to get into it, but once I did I was hooked completely.

As some reviews have commented, there are times you don't know how to react. Valerie can bring out so many reactions. You feel sorry for her and want her to win, you're annoyed by her pretensions, laugh at her obliviousness, and warmed by the fact that she really is a good person at the heart of it all. She's such a complete character that Lisa Kudrow dissapears. I never once thought of Phoebe. It's great that ""Valerie"" does some commentary tracks. They are frequently as hilarious as the episodes themselves.

Kudrow is also helped by an amazing cast. Mickey is a great supporting character, always there with a great throwaway line, her husband is the perfect straight man to the absurdity of Valerie's existance, and special note must be made of Pauly G. He's got to be one of the best villains ever. He's so frustrating that you just have to cheer when... well, that'd be telling. It's a great moment.",1154476800,18,1642,4.394736842105263
2575653,3,B000FL7CB4,"Lisa Kudrow stars in this humorous HBO show about a former 80's star who is attempting to make a comeback in present day.  Kudrow plays Valerie Cherish, the star of the now defunct ""I'm It,"" who auditions for a role in a new show called ""Room and Bored.""  Little does she know, that the role in ""Room and Bored"" hinges on her willingness to participate in a reality show depicting her comeback into prime time.

Reasons why Valerie is so funny:
1) She has no idea that she's such a has-been and the fact that the younger, hotter cast of her new show has completely eclipsed her.
2) She still has the same hairdresser, and accordingly the same hairstyle, that she did 13 years ago.
3) Her attempts at playing normal for the cameras are the worst sort of overacting and her ideas are shut down left and right by the writers, cameramen, and producers of either show.

This show was created by Kudrow and Michael Patrick King of Sex and the City.  It's different than most other shows on the market right now because it's willing to laugh at itself.  The people behind The Comeback know that the reality tv market is oversaturated and play it up. It's a shame that this show got cancelled after only one season, but it's worth watching nonetheless.",1154476800,6,1244,4.506666666666667
2575654,5,B000FL7CB4,"Cancelling ""The Comeback"" after only one season is one of HBO's biggest blunders in recent history.  The show was incredibly creative with pitch-perfect writing and casting, but never quite found an audience.  Unfortunately, a series with this much wit and creativity demands a sophisticated audience.  If the execs at HBO had enough guts to stay with the series, I'm sure it would have found an audience, but giving it just 13 weeks was a pretty raw deal.  Lisa Kudrow was simply outstanding, and very deserving of her Best Actress Emmy nomination.  This DVD is excellent and the ""Dancing With the Stars"" portion of the extras alone makes it worth buying.  The audio commentary from Lisa Kudrow in character as Valerie is absolutely hilarious.  This is a must-buy even if you may have missed the show on HBO.",1154476800,12,809,4.861313868613139
2575665,5,B000FL7CB4,"After hearing that Lisa Kudrow would star in a new show about a B-list actress whose trying to make a comeback by starring in her own reality show, I immediately find the series very appealing. And when I finally saw the pilot episode, I really saw a promising series. The series had a rocky start. It premiered to mixed reviews and the ratings were disappointing. Fast forward to the finale and the show, even though the ratings were still weak, is finally receiving wide critical support. And then HBO all of a sudden pulled the plug and abandoned the show. I was really mad when HBO announced that the show won't be renewed for a second season. I really think they've made the wrong decision. They didn't give the series the chance to build an audience especially since the critics are finally behind the show.

But at least HBO redeemed themselves (a little bit, I'll never forgive them for what they did to the show) when I learned that they'd be releasing the first and only season of the show on DVD on August 1 this year. And I'm glad that there's a great amount of special features included in the set most notably the commentaries on 6 episodes. Here are the special features:

Valerie's DVD Interview

Footage of Valerie backstage at Dancing with the Stars

Commentary on 6 Episodes (Pilot, Valerie Triumphs at the Upfronts, Valerie Bonds with the Cast, Valerie Hangs with the Cool Kids, Valerie Stands Out in the Red Carpet, and Valerie Does Another Classic Leno)

So here's a rundown of my personal top 5 episodes of the show:

(Brief background on the series: Valerie Cherish is a former sitcom star from the show called ""I'm It"" and she's planning to make a comeback by starring in her own reality show while also starring in a new sitcom called Room and Bored.)

1. Valerie Relaxes at Palm Springs- a major turning point for the series. A lot of people have been a little annoyed by Valerie being such a pushover and a doormat. When Valerie finally stood for herself, people started to root for the character. Lisa Kudrow gave an Emmy worthy performance in this episode. The drunk scene was priceless. And the ending was perfect.

2. Valerie Does Another Classic Leno- the series finale is a bittersweet episode. I'm sad that we would never see these characters develop but I'm glad that the series ended on a high note. This episode is a full circle moment for Valerie as she had her big Leno appearance again. The irony of the episode is that when she finally gave up the sleaziness of reality shows, it turned out that was exactly what she needed to regain her fame. The ending of Valerie being mobbed by fans is a classic moment and perfect way to end the episode and series.

3. Valerie Stands Up for Aunt Sassy- another stand out episode as Valerie defended Aunt Sassy (the character she played in the sitcom) from the writers when she found a punchline offensive that might turn off the viewers. This episode was funny and a great character episode for Valerie.

4. Valerie Saves the Show- Valerie was not happy with the premiere of her sitcom when her big scene was bombarded by invasive advertisements. A really funny episode.

5. (TIE) Valerie Stands Out in the Red Carpet and Valerie Hangs with the Cool Kids- the first was about the whole cast of Room and Bored attending an award show where Valerie had a major fashion faux pas with her dress. The second is about the whole cast planning a boycott of the show and backing out in the last minute without Valerie knowing.

There are other great episodes in the series, but those 6 episodes were my favorite. Lisa Kudrow really was award-worthy as Valerie Cherish. She was able to find the balance of comedy and drama in her consistent and well defined characterization. From the first episode to the last episode, the mannerisms she created for the character was intact. She really becomes the character. Kudrow is surrounded by a group of talented supporting actors, most notably Damian Young, as her supportive and protective husband, Lanca Barber as the infamous Paulie G., the pain in the butt whose mission in life is to keep Valerie's life miserable, and lastly Robert Michael Morris as Mickey, Valerie's cheerful makeup artist and her ""favorite gay"", I mean guy.

I think this is a welll made, engaging, and entertaining series with some wonderful performances from the cast headed by Lisa Kudrow. I highly recommend it.

Grade: A",1154476800,10,4414,4.678709677419355
2575666,1,B000FL7CB4,"This was purely a money saving attempt by HBO. Carnivale had been such an expenbsive show to produce, some say the most expensive ever, they tried to pull this cheap drivel on us with soso production values and a writer who was mailing in episodes from the latrine.

It's too bad no stars is not an option here, this show deserves it. Buy this and see foe yourself how much replay value this travesty has. None. A fake reality show following a star trying to regain the spotlight. It COULD have been funny. The acting, pacing, lame jokes, and even lamer inside jokes made this too dreadful to even watch to make fun of. Take the most mundane episode of Entertainment Tonight, dumb it down even further, fire the writing staff, forget all about timing and tempo, combine it with the worst True Hollywood Story ever made, and call it a comedy when it is at most a vanity piece for the star. One star is too much and one season was too much!",1154304000,5,938,4.390804597701149
2575667,2,B000FL7CB4,"I watched the entire series while on HBO. This DVD set is very expensive for the entertainment you will get.

The concept (well documented here already) is that Kudrow's character doesn't get she is B-list at best and slipping even lower fast. Thus, nearly every joke is based on her lack of perception about the real world which we (the viewer) can see via the documentary footage. And that joke is that most people won't put up with an actress who acts like a diva but isn't.

That's it. That's the entire series. That's why the ratings weren't that great -- if you saw one episode, you pretty much saw them all. With few exceptions, there were great opportunities for character development which simply never occurred. (One of the rare counter-examples is when Kudrow's character's step-daughter practically steals an episode by showing how she changed her personality with all the cameras around her house filming the ""documentary"".)

As a result, the characters become simple one dimensional cut-outs: the fat, grumpy writer, the fey hairstylist/personal assistant, the bubbly up-and-coming starlet, etc. The ending of the season is also rather weak since nearly all of the series is very black in its humor, there is a tack-on feel for a ""feel good ending"". Of course, fans of the series may want to claim this is Kudrow's post-modern attempt at satire on the real Hollywood which always looks for that ending. My mileage varies from that.

It's suicide to write a luke-warm review here of something that the die-hard fans will have an emotional reaction to, but it needs to be done. This series was cancelled by HBO even before it was over and the majority of critics didn't care for it either. My rating hopefully will warn people that there is another point of view besides all the 5-star reviews.  This is a mildly amusing, but ultimately mediocre effort, especially compared to other HBO comedies.

Finally, the discriminating reader will find that all 5 star reviews here are voted positive unanimously, while anything 3 or less is universally panned -- despite being thoughtful, though less than positive, reviews. That's usually a sign that the 5 star reviews are a set of die-hard extreme fans whom have axes to grind (e.g. upset that the show was cancelled).

2575668,5,B000FL7CB4,"I realize that dark comedy like this way-too-short-lived, fake-docu-comedy, which aired on HBO last year, is not for everyone. But, if you get the humor of ""The Office,"" either the origional BBC version or the equally great NBC series, then ""The Comeback"" is for you. If folks tuned in thinking that they were seeing Lisa Kudrow that they knew and loved from ""Friends,"" then they, too, will be thrown for a loop. The complete opposite of ""Friends"" (which I also love) or its spin-off ""Joey,"" which was miserable (save for scenes that included the always sidesplittingly funny Jennifer Coolidge as Joey's agent), ""The Comeback"" had some of the best writing and painfully realistic acting on the part of Kudrow. I'm sorry that HBO didn't get it or give it a chance to find an audience. Paired with ""Curb your Enthusiasm,"" ""The Comeback"" could have been an HBO classic.

I saw a talk with Lisa Kudrow in which she explained that the head of HBO TV Production never really ""got"" the show -- otherwise he might have given it another season. But still, what we have been given in this DVD set is a miraculous little gem, a polished and perfect masterpiece, brilliantly written and acted, and highlighting Kudrow in one of her most engaging performances. The masochistic agonies of her gut-wrenchingly optimistic Valerie Cherish, will not be for everyone -- but for those who do ""get"" it, it is that rare beauty: truth in art.

BIG-TIME Kudos to Ms. Kudrow; we most certainly have not seen the last of her. In a perfect world Poetic Justice would ensure that she will win the Emmy she so richly deserves for making Valerie Cherish a household name in (at least) MY household.

It all strikes a little too close to home for television celebs, I think, and Kudrow isn't afraid to go to those uncomfortable places making us cringe even as we laugh.  At the beginning of the series we're laughing at Valerie and her obvious attempts to make herself look good in the eyes of her fans from the past.  By the time the first season wrapped, we were with her every step of the way, rooting for her triumph and feeling her pain.  I'm so glad we're going to get this show on DVD... now if we can just have a second season?",1152230400,52,790,4.427586206896552
2575674,5,B000FL7CB4,"Perhaps the Producer, Michael Patrick King from Sex and The City and Lisa Kudrow, star from Friends were really expensive to get for HBO, since those shows were so big. However, those shows were made for the masses. Perhaps HBO was expecting another block buster ratings giant. It sounded like it, when they chose not to renew this show, saying the numbers weren't there and they didn't have any resources to put into promoting it further.

However, The Comeback was more of a niche show; subtle, intelligent, willing to embrace pain, humiliation in a point blank fashion. Willing to embrace phases we tend to avoid: those difficult moments in life when somebody says something in which you are not quite sure how to respond, socially awkward situations. A series this intelligent and insightful can only appeal to a few. The great masses prefer simple minded fair to distract them or prefer to see lots of things exploding with lots of pyrotechnics kind of like Homer and Bart Simpson, who are caricatures of ""Everyman"" on the Street"".

But as Valerie (Lisa's character says in one episode); Reality TV is becoming ""Coliseum mentality"" and that she doesn't do coliseums. Valerie feared her show would not fare well in such a world. This thought proved to be prophetic.

Lisa Kudrow graduated from Vassar College with a degree in Biology. She's an extremely intelligent woman although you might not think so with all the ditzy characters she has played like Phoebe and the Romy and Michelle HS Reunion character.

In The Comeback however, as the main character and as Executive Producer, her intelligence is allowed free rein, as she is allowed to fully develop this Valerie character into a lightning rod for all manner of ridiculous situations...she still plays the part of silly and vain woman but does it so well in concert with the whole cast... We get to see humanity and all it's ridiculous foibles: vanity. prententiousness, selfishness, rudeness, vapidness, indifference, ego mania, self involved-ness...

Each episode allows us to see in subtle details and not so subtle details the dynamics of human/social interactions.

It was definitely not a show for the masses...I don't know if the 2nd season could have been as good as the first but at least we got 13 fantastic episodes of which I have watched at least 15 times each. I think Lisa and Michael should have tried to bring it to Showtime after HBO dropped it but Hey life is always changing...I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",1149984000,121,2496,4.861176470588235
