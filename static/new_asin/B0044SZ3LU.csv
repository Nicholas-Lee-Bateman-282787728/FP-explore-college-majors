8416292,3,B0044SZ3LU,"This DVD features one episode of the Care Bears television series in which the Care Bears have a chance to win the annual basketball game.  Only about 10 minutes long, it focuses on the Care Bear cousins...Brave Heart Lion is the coach and Lotsa Heart Elephant is the player who has to prove herself, if I am remembering correctly.  Daughter watched it repeatedly (for reasons which escape me).

If you are looking for someone's first computer video game, Care Bears Catch A Star would be a good choice.  It features eight simple games: Bedtime Bear's Domino Dilemma, Cheer Bear's Cheer Up Bubbles, Friend Bear's Flower Power, Good Luck Bear's Charm Builder, Love-A-Lot Bear's Wish Sender, Share Bear's Ping Pong Fun, Tenderheart Bear's Pattern Puzzle, and Wish Bear's Star Buddy Rainbow Notes.  With 8 selections to choose from, there is no need to spend much time on any one game, and ValuSoft even claims it will work on Windows 7 (works great on XP).",1334448000,,954,4.828220858895706
