1369217,5,B00004XQOS,"A good video for Tubby fans.  My son couldn't stop laughing throughout all the wonderful antics of the Teletubbies and the Noo-Noo.  It is also nice to see some of the traditions that take place in other parts of the world at Christmas time.  If your children like the Teletubbies, this is definitely one for their video library.  A video even adults won't mind sitting through again and again (especially if you like snow and can remember playing in it when you were a kid).",973814400,15,475,4.552941176470588
1369225,5,B00004XQOS,My little siblings enjoyed this dvd. They kep wanting to watch it over and over again. A must-by for tubby fans!,1358899200,,112,4.380952380952381
1369226,5,B00004XQOS,"I wanted to get a dvd about winter and this was ""the one"". My daughter loves it and watch it  everyday this month. It's nice that it shows kids celebrating Christmas in other countries. It's long and not very much action, but if she likes it I'm happy.",1357344000,,252,4.25
1369227,2,B00004XQOS,"Video has jerky sections between clear sections.
Overall the story line is OK.
Perhaps I should only purchase new DVDs",1354838400,,118,4.95

1369229,5,B00004XQOS,The movies are in excellent condition including the movies case(rare).  I received it fast without any problems.  My children were very excited to see the teletubbies with my 12 year old loved as a baby.,1311724800,,203,4.771428571428571
1369230,4,B00004XQOS,This is an excellent product for toddlers.  There is so little made for this age group.  It's sad that they are not making these any more.  My 2 year old granddaughter is glued to the TV when I put this in.  It helped introduce her to snow and Christmas.,1291334400,,254,4.122448979591836
1369231,5,B00004XQOS,Picked up this video to help teach our 18-month old son about Christmas and Santa. It was a huge hit and he watched it almost daily! It quickly became his favorite video from our library of Teletubbies and Baby Einstein DVD's.,1230249600,,226,4.536585365853658
1369232,2,B00004XQOS,I ordered several Teletubbies DVDs. This was not my favorite. It was just okay. My 14 mo. old did not seem impressed either.,1214092800,,124,4.434782608695652
1369233,5,B00004XQOS,As long as my baby enjoys it then that's all that matters. Personally I don't care for it.,1214006400,,90,4.055555555555555
1369234,5,B00004XQOS,"My nephew who is almost 3,(in a few days), loves this dvd. I bought it for him for Xmas, which is why I purchased the Christmas in the snow dvd. He hadn't ever seen Teletubbies, since they aren't on PBS kids anymore, if they are, I've missed them everytime. But he took to them quickly. He loves the Sunbaby and all the characters. He's watched it several times and will watch it several times more.",1200614400,,399,4.333333333333333
1369245,5,B00004XQOS,"My child owns 4 teletubbies DVDS. Most are 55 -60 minutes long(this one is 100 minutes long!), and keep his attention enough so that he either plays with his toys while watching or sits quietly and watches. I use these DVDS only when I want to empty the dishwasher, or get things done while watching him at the same time (and so he's not climbing in the dishwasher or near the stove while i'm cooking).
So far, he seems to love watching the various kids from different countries and see how they celebrate christmas.  He also loves seeing snow, since we don't have any here!",1199404800,,574,4.466666666666667
1369246,5,B00004XQOS,thank you so much i love ordering from amazon they have any thing i need,1195603200,,72,3.8666666666666667
1369247,5,B00004XQOS,"I absolutely love this DVD because it has so many entertaining clips that differ from the rest of the series because of the unique snowy environment. My daughter loves to watch the Tubbies go sliding down a snowy hill and build a snow Tubby. The clips of real children around the world celebrating Christmas are also a lot of fun, and the music from those clips is carried through the rest of the video.",1170892800,2,403,4.45945945945946
1369248,5,B00004XQOS,My children adore the teletubbies and watching them play in the snow is great fun (especially since we live in the South and don't see much snow).  We are fans of all the teletubbies videos!,1130112000,,190,4.428571428571429
1369249,5,B00004XQOS,We bought Teletubbies Christmas in the Snow a few weeks ago for our 15 month old (13.5 months adjusted-preemie)...Figured it would be the typical teletubbies fare-which it was- but once again it explored many cultures and their handling of Christmas...My husband and I both loved watching the various Christmas activities of other nationalities...Really cool stuff!  We may incorporate some into our next holiday celebration aside from our existing italian and german traditions...Oh and my little guy just loved it!,1103846400,4,516,5.531645569620253
1369250,5,B00004XQOS,"We are big fans of the Teletubbies in our house, so to find a holiday DVD for our daughter was really a treat.  In this installment of Tubby bliss, the Teletubbies are introduced to snow for the first time.  Their adventures, from 'sliding' down hills to making a 'Snow Tubby', are a hit with my daughter, and the snipets of 'Christmases from Around the World' are interesting for us all to see.  And there's a bonus segment of 'Teletubbies Everywhere', which always draws smiles.  We found this to be a nice diversion from the 'usual' Tubby stuff...:).",1073433600,6,553,4.670103092783505
1369251,4,B00004XQOS,"My ONLY complaint about this video is that it is so long. Two videos is a little bit much in my opinion.
The positives are that this video is typical of all Teletubbie videos. There are short segments that provide good stopping points with little shows between the Teletubbies shows. They are fun and gentle and encourage hugs and respect. They are fun.
My young daughter, who is 2 still likes Teletubbies. My son, who is 4, has recently outgrown the Teletubbies. So that might provide potential buyers of an age range (0-3/4) when buying this video.
Enjoy.",1058659200,5,557,4.6938775510204085
1369252,5,B00004XQOS,"Tubbies ride on Thomas and friends comming in second in popularity.  I dug the snow. My two year old son and I kept remarking, It's snowing again!  Dipsy finaly discovers the joy of sliding.  Christmas celebrations in different countries is cute.  You can't go wrong with lot's of big hugs.",1003968000,2,290,4.74
1369253,5,B00004XQOS,"This video conveys a peaceful and loving atmosphere. Even when it is snowing, the sun is shining. There are great segments of different countries and Christmas traditions. It is ""too cute for words."" The children loved it! They danced, clapped and sang along. Even the babies enjoyed watching the snow fall and pointed to the snowman. Older kids were curious about the different languages spoken. Best for ages 0 to 2 when broken into smaller viewing segments.",1000425600,5,460,4.987012987012987
1369254,5,B00004XQOS,"We bought this just before Christmas '00 and my one-year-old and my 10-year-old loved it.  We especially like the Finnish kids singing the song ""Dip Dop"" (or whatever it is).  The baby, who doesn't talk yet, is getting good at singing her own version and making some hand motions she sees them make in the video.",979257600,7,312,4.553571428571429

7926263,5,B00004XQOS,"This DVD is quite interesting with the Teletubbies! It has a little different atmosphere than what we're used to! The snow covers the ground and the Teletubbies learn to have fun in the snow! This DVD also includes different video segments from children about Christmas in different parts of the world. Finland, UK, Spain, South America I believe, it has lots of segments to keep children interested. It is a 100 minute movie unlike the ones that are 50-70 minutes! This one goes for a while with all the content it has! It's too bad they don't have this show on PBS anymore or have anything to do with it. It was such a good show when it ran better than some of what is on today. If you have small children at home purchase this DVD! The content will keep them interested for a while!",1407024000,,785,4.383561643835616
