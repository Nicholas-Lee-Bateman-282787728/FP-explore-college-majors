7883248,3,6305050171,"I'm watching this right now on Netflix.  So this review isn't about the show itself, but rather the commentary.  The commentary on the video is sexist and pervy!  The magician assistants are very pretty and wearing revealing outfits.  But what is disturbing is that every magic trick had a comment from the narrator.  Things like, ""well that's one thing to do with that body"".  Or replaying a girl running in slow motion.  Or talking about the girl when she's in a provocative position (which is often since they are squeezing into a step or a barrel).
I think the show itself is good and my kids enjoy watching the it.  I just have reservations with them watching it because of those comments. Yuck!",1466899200,8,700,4.634146341463414

He showed old tricks.....these aren't the more modern-day illusions. Besides......(and this message is for all you haters out there)....you can go to youtube and watch videos on how to perform illusions and purchase books on magic tricks. It is no different. If Valentino should be banned, then the books and videos from the ""other"" magicians should be banned as well. They are just as guilty as Valentino. It isn't a crime for God's sake.....get over it.",1377820800,,583,4.959183673469388
7883251,4,6305050171,"It's funny how some people here cry ""he broke the code!"" and give it 5 stars, and others make THE SAME CRY, and give it one... I don't think the magic in magic is entirely in not knowing how it's done, more, its in the presentation. As demonstrated every day, when we enjoy fiction and theater, we CAN suspend disbelief long enough to enjoy an artistic or spectacular presentation. We know that is NOT Richard II up there on that stage, and we know that magic is an illusion, but we allow ourselves to believe it is, at least for the moment, what it seems to be.

In other words, though somewhat demystified by this series, I think magic will survive. As someone else here said, magicians will continue to invent ever more amazing tricks, which will continue to astound audiences for a long time to come. Those of us who wish to keep the most magic in magic need not watch this expose.",1337731200,,885,4.396341463414634
7883252,4,6305050171,I have always been wondering how they di magic tricks and this show was perfect for me.  It was awe inspiring and wonderful.  I wish they would release the complete series on DVD.,1289692800,,179,4.393939393939394
7883253,5,6305050171,"I agree with the reviewers who say that the magic industry may have actually been HELPED by this program series... many of the people who were previously unhappy with magic because they couldn't figure out how the tricks were done (and so they didn't want to go and see magicians perform because it would just have been puzzling and upsetting to them; I know because I myself am one of those folks) may now like magic better after having seen this program about how some of the tricks are done, and so they may now feel inclined to go and see magic shows.  You see, folks, entertainment is a ""whole-world"" business, and as such, it must create various types of material so as to cater to every facet of the population.  As I say, there are many people --- yours truly included --- who DO want to know how magic tricks are performed... we actually DISLIKE not knowing how a trick is done, and so we may not bother watching magicians because of the frustration and resentment we feel at not being allowed to see the secrets behind the illusions.  So this program's magician is merely bowing to that comparatively small but sizeable and enthusiastic segment of the audience who so desperately DOES desire to know what the secrets are.  You can't please all the people all the time, and I say, let those of us who do like to see how magic tricks are performed have our little shows that give us what we want --- nobody said you had to watch them, too!  It's just like anyone who produces documentary movies about anti-Christians, devil-worshippers, cannibalism, etc. --- certain people are interested in these things, and so they are grateful for any media that covers what they like.  The rest of us should not criticize the producers of these ""alternative"" movies, because, again, the rest of us don't have to watch them if we don't want to.  Let's not criticize media coverage of a certain subject just because we don't happen to agree with it... this is a free world, remember?  ""Live and let live"", you know?",1216598400,3,2009,4.592178770949721

7883256,5,6305050171,"I can just picture the meeting during which the producers of this program were trying to convince Fox TV to air ""Magic's Biggest Secrets Finally Revealed.""  Because there is such a hew and outcry against anyone who would break the so-called ""magician's code,"" it must have taken some strong convincing to get the okay from station owners.

The show did end up making it on the air, which means the point was made as to why the program should air on public television.

And now the program is on VHS.  Now.  How do you suppose that happened?  I imagine some magic enthusiasts may be against this sort of thing because this could be the beginning of something worse!  ""What if all magic is revealed??""

Never happen.

The magic industry is quickly losing its audience.  People are becoming far too sophisticated and savvy to be interested in the mundane.  How, then, to drum up interest in magic again?

The answer?  Create a series of programs that reveal the secrets to some of the more sophomoric tricks.  First, because of the rubber-neck principle, people will tune-in in droves.  That creates the interest.  That way, the next time some fancy illusionist appears on TV to promote his latest on-stage gig, people will really want to figure out how it is done.  Except NOW, they won't be able to figure it out because the trick has been changed.  The secret is not at all what appeared on the Secrets Revealed tape.

For example, the Masked Magician reveals how an assistant is transformed into a live tiger while in a covered cage suspended in midair.  The secret lies in the fact that the cage is always covered by a sheet on three sides, but the front is always open to the audience.  The assistant steps in and the sheet then covers the front of the cage.  The assistant opens a small door built into the floor of the cage and crawls into a space just large enough to fit her.  The assistant is very thin and fits nicely in the false floor.

But the floor isn't the only false thing about this cage.  The back wall of the cage is also false.  The back wall, built to look like part of the iron cage, has the back section of the curtain built into it.  When the assistant inside the cage pulls a rope, the back wall falls forward and lies flat.

Standing behind the false back wall is the tiger.  When the wall falls to the floor, the tiger naturally walks to the front of the cage.  That's when the sheet covering the cage is completely removed.  The assistant is gone and in her place is the tiger.

Pretty simple, right?  Kind of corny perhaps?  Now that the secret has been revealed, all magicians are bankrupt, right?

Wrong.  Now these clever magicians must come up with a new way to perform the same trick.  And the new way cannot incorporate false rear walls on the cage where during most of the trick the back wall is always covered by a sheet.

The trick is now done with all walls of the cage completely open to the audience.  No tiger can be hiding behind a false wall as long as the audience can see clearly through the cage.

So how is it done?  Well, maybe if you see it live, in Las Vegas, you can figure it out.  Now, is the objective for revealing these simple tricks becoming obvious?

This VHS version, like the Masked Magician other programs, are really only teasers.  A person who is truly curious to know how any of the tricks on his shows are performed need only visit a library.  These secrets have been revealed a long time ago.

The forklift behind the curtain (or similar device built into the stage) lifting the ""Levitating Woman"" is nothing new.

Pulling a rabbit out of a hat after just showing the audience that it was empty only a moment before is easy enough.  The narrator tells us, during the trick's revelation, that rabbits are chosen (over cats and small dogs) because rabbits stay still.  He doesn't tell you that rabbits, like birds, have flexible bones and can be confined to unbelievably small confined spaces.

The purpose of the Masked Magician's programs are not to break anyone's code of secrecy.  It is common knowledge that today's illusionists are in on the scheme to drum up more interest in their craft and, as long as nothing really important is revealed, they endorse the Masked Magician's efforts.",1135123200,27,4257,4.528252299605782
7883257,1,6305050171,"This video should be banned.  The person that reveals these illusions violated copyright and patent by showing the secrets to these illusions.  There is a difference between this video and instructional videos.  This is video merely gives the secrets, whereas an instructional video explains the secrets, as well as, methods, history and other information about the trick, and has enough background in magic to know that half the fun of seeing magic is not knowing the secret.  I'm thoroughly displeased as a magician.",1020470400,6,518,5.204819277108434
