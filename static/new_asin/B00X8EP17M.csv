8715358,5,B00X8EP17M,"HAIRY WHO AND THE CHICAGO IMAGISTS is a 1 hour and 45 minute color movie about an art movement associated with Chicago, that was prominent from the mid-1960s until the mid-1980s.  The quality of the cinematography is first rate, and we see present-day interviews of the artists and curators, appearing to be in their 70s and 80s, and we also see older color movie footage from the 1960s and 1970s.  The paintings and occasional sculptures are the main attraction, fortunately.  The wiggling-jiggling-nervous black and white graphics animation, created by Lilli Carre is fun, exciting, and appropriate, and the style of Lilli Carre's graphics is consistent with a 1-minute comparison of the wiggly-jiggly type of art from cartoons from the 1930s.  In this 1-minute comparison, we see a short excerpt from a Popeye cartoon.

HAIRY WHO AND THE CHICAGO IMAGES features paintings from two groups, THE HAIRY WHO and the NON-PLUSSED SOME, as well as a few other artists that fit under the Chicago Imagist umbrella, such as Joseph Yokum and H.C. Westerman.  The main artists featured here are Jim Nutt, Ed Paschke, and Roger Brown, and you have to have fallen off of a turnip truck not to have heard of these majestic artists.  The other artist that are repeatedly featured in this film are Ray Yoshida, Jim Falconer, Jim Wirsum, Art Green, Gladys Nilsson, Suellen Rocca, Phil Hanson, Ed Flood, Sara Canright, Barbara Rossi, and Christina Ramberg.  (Suellen Rocca and Barbara Rossi are the cute ones.)

The interview with Gladys Nilsson was educational to me, in that she described her paintings as showing people woven together.  It was interesting to hear her comments on the tour of Chicago Imagist paintings throughout South America, especially her initial thought that the artists should tour under their own names, and that the exhibit should not be called, ""Chicago Imagists.""  Then, in the same interview, she reveals why she changed her mind, and this was because of an analogy with the New York Pop artists, where at first they were all called pop artists, and where some ten years later they all emerged individually.  Also, I had not previously heard of Sarah Canright, and her style at an earlier time was of designs in lighter tones than found with a typical pastel, as in the very lightly colored: DOUBLE TAKE (1969) and WHISPER (1969).  Although I visited Phyllis Kind Gallery in the early 1980s, it was interesting to see her in her present-day interviews and in her interviews from back in the day, and it was interesting to see the interview with Jim Nutt, where he stated that she made many enemies, and that she also converted some her friends into enemies.

Earlier this year (2017), I purchased HUMAN CONCERN/PERSONAL TORMENT from Amazon.com, since I had seen the corresponding exhibition at University of California at Berkeley (January to March 1970).  In perusing the pages of this book, I was delightfully shocked to see an early painting by Ed Paschke.  This means that I had already been a fan of Ed Paschke when I was only 18 years old (without realizing it), before I became a more conscious fan of Ed Paschke, about 12 years later, when I was living in Wisconsin.

COMPLAINT.  I have only one real complaint.  The movie shows how in the early days, the Chicago Imagists were inspired by comic book cartoons and that they manufactured their own comic books to go with their exhibitions.  We see a short interview with Dan Nadel, who has published books about the Chicago Imagists, and also about cartoon comic books.  My complaint is that this movie fails to state that Jim Nutt copied his style from BASIL WOLVERTON, an artist for Mad Magazine.  Another person has published the fact that Wolverton inspired Jim Nutt, namely, author Glenn Bray.  In the ORIGINAL ART OF BASIL WOLVERTON (2007), author Glenn Bray states that, ""The impact of Wolverton's vision on subsequent . . . fine arts is obvious . . . artists like . . . Jim Nutt . . . turn his [Wolverton's] pop monstrosities into museum-worthy artifacts."" I agree with Mr. Glenn Bray.

This concerns the very excellent book: JIM NUTT: COMING INTO CHARACTER by Lynne Warren.  The reproductions of the paintings in this book, in terms of image quality and in terms of the large number of paintings, is a wonder to behold.  However, the writing in this book takes the form of meaningless gibberish.  Instead of acknowledging that Jim Nutt was inspired by Basil Wolverton, this book states that Jim Nutt was inspired by two Italian artists: Raphael and by Inghirami.

MINOR QUIBBLE.  I was a little disappointed to see that there was no mention of artist ROBERT GORDY.  Robert Gordy (1934-1986) was a New Orleans-based artist whose work showed striking overlap with some of the paintings by Ray Yoshida (1930-2009). Robert Gordy's pictures are in the permanent collections of such institutions as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, and the National Collection of Fine Art in Washington.  I was glad that this video mentioned artist Robert Lostutter, one of the Chicago Imagists, but the video did not show any of his painting.  In the early 1980s, when I lived in Madison, WI, the art center had an exhibit of Mr. Lostutter's paintings.  Also, I was slightly disappointed that the video did not mention artist Hollis Sigler, a Chicago artist.",1496793600,,5396,4.87513691128149

8715360,5,B00X8EP17M,"Chicago art as a sub-culture.  As many other reviewers have stated, this was more about the art than the artists.  A nice blend of both with many paintings and sculptures that you can pause on and get a really good look.  Compares Chicago with New York in an interesting way stating that NY art took itself more seriously.  This was not done in a condescending way but rather expressed the whimsy of the Hairy Who and the Chicago Imagists who had a great deal of fun with their expression.

Very interesting and relevant to today's art scene and budding artists as well as established artists who can benefit from watching this film.

For art fanciers, historians, and other dreamers.  Enjoy the color, personalities, and back stories of the later 20th century art scene in Chicago.",1468627200,,782,4.7481481481481485
8715361,5,B00X8EP17M,"One art movement calls for art for art's sake. This documentary, Hairy Who and the Chicago Imagists, accomplishes that goal in its own way, it's own perception of modern art.

What made this documentary directed by Leslie Buchbinder effective was its visual insistence to put more emphasis on the art work rather than on the artist. Even though Chicago Imagist such as Jeff Koons, Jim Nutt, Ed Puschke, and a host of others get, face time interview, this documentary, however, is more about showing their art then the artists' personal history. That history, such as attending the famous Chicago Art Institute, and the painters sharing their feelings about art, is showed and mentioned in this documentary, yet what stands out more than the painters are their artwork in the Chicago galleries.

What I find most annoying about documentary on artists is the video relies more on showing the painter  more than his or her artwork. Not with Hairy Who. The artwork, the paintings, take center stage, not the artists. For that alone, I would bestow, give, five stars to this art documentary. There is very little pretensions, very little we are artists, we are special people, in this production; it's more about the art for art's sake.

In NYC, the art world is highly politicized. Given the fact that many artists in the Big Apple are well known like Andy Warhol, Keith Haring, Jean Michel Basquit, and many others, some still living today, shows how politics play into the equation of great art, some say politics is far more important than talent. This documentary about the Chicago Imagist plays a bit into the politics equation of the art world, but not entirely. It shows the art, and lets the viewer interpret the creation on their own terms, without someone nudging them to ask if they had seen this or that, and were they aware of what the painting sold for.

When I read that a Basquit painting, primitive art, sold for millions of dollars, recently, I was quit impressed. Yet my mind wasn't focused on the art work itself, it was more focused on the price tag. Suddenly the philosophy of art of art's sake, was lost, crumbled, discarded like a candy wrapper in a subway trash can. In the end, it all boils down to the dollar sign.

Not true with Hairy Who. The art is put up front. It takes the center stage in the second city, Chicago, and the dollar signs are never mentioned, it's far from view.

That alone made this documentary worth watching. Did I like the art work shown? Sure, of course, I have HD, and the colors of the paintings stand out in boldness. For so-called imagists' art work, HD is heaven sent to display their quite interesting art work filled with brilliantly colored combined with smooth colors of all shapes and forms.",1464134400,,2750,4.716666666666667

Of course there is a lot of amazing art work shown in the movie as well.  The set includes not just the Blu-Ray disc or DVD (depending on which format you order) but it also comes with two flip books with animation from the film, a small ""Are you a Surrealist?"" poster and a brief essay.
