8360782,5,B0007L6PRY,"Skinhead Attitude, this is a great documentary from Germany about the skinhead cult, which at this point is over 40 years old now!! What I like about this documentary is it balance both tradional non racist skins and racist nazis from Europe, the U.K., and North America. When most people think of skinheads the image have are black clad, sieg heiling baldheaded white storm troopers!!! But how many people would even imagine that the skinhead subculture is a combination of white working class hard mods and West Indian rude boys dancing together to Jamaican music called ska or even soul music from the U.S. during the late 1960s? How any people think of Black skinheads or Jewish skinheads, but they exist!!!! The interviews with Jimmy Pursey of Sham 69,the Godfather of Ska Laurel Aikens, Roddy Moreno of the Oppressed, Buster Bloodvessel of Bad Manners, and various nonracist skins and nazis provide two sides of the same coin. Sadly this movie is region coded and you have to have an all-region player to watch it, but if you are interested in the skinhead subculture (and you have an all region player or know a friend who has one) do yourself a favor and pick it up. And although it's German there are english audio options!",1349568000,4,1232,4.761682242990654
