7876587,3,6304681062,"That is what you get. Poor story,acting,weird camera tricks,used in wrong time and wrong place,but enough gory to satisfy the gorehounds.
But I admire lifestyle of Todd Sheets:he work in haunted house,listen metal music,he is a horror fan and make his own gory movies. If for nothing else,than for this ,I want to see his other movies",1038355200,,334,4.87719298245614
7876588,5,6304681062,"Great editing, creepy characters, the best zombie make up Ihave seen in a low budget film and a surprising ending makes this onefar better than part one. There are some really crazy parts with theserial killers that are so disturbing anbd brutal and it all ends inone of the BEST knifings I have ever seen on film.  You have to seethis one (hint: it's shot from INSIDE the guys mouth!) to believe it! The acting is pretty strong for a movie like this, but don't expectgreat thespians. The best characters are the bad guys. The scarecrowactually did give me the creeps, but I wish I knew more about him andI would like to have seen how he was destroyed better. That is theonly MINOR flaw in an otherwise great time. Highly entertaining andthat is all that really matters to me. Be ready to for some sickeffects and a fast (very fast actually) paced movie.",982281600,,854,4.545454545454546
7876589,3,6304681062,"I love zombie movies. There always chock-full of gore(Except for a few), the acting is usually bearable, character development is always there, and zombie effects are great. This film is... well, different. The entire film  literally looks like it was shot on standard home video cameras, and there  is hardly any character development. However, I love low-budget flicks, and  this one is good, but not great. If you like lots of gore, than this movie  is for you. There are some incredible gore scenes and the zombie make-up is  fantastic.( It's obvious whre most of the budget went). And let me clear  something up about the scarecrow. Yes. it is pretty creepy, but the  scarecrow only gets about 2 minutes on- screen, and he didn't kill anybody  during that time. There really is no plot. The only reason I can figure out  why the dead came back to life is because some guy took the scarecrow's  jacket. However, this is not a bad zombie flick, it is pretty good. My  advice, don't buy it immediately. If you find it for rent, DEFINETELY rent  it. Then, you'll see what I mean. If you like it, well, I think it was  worth the money I payed for it.",964051200,2,1150,4.524271844660194
7876590,2,6304681062,"This movie seems like it was filmed in one weekend with the help of the director's friends and family,and a low end camcorder. The violence is gratuitous and is utilized not to advance the story but to simply shock the  viewer. The story itself is derivitive,contrived,and overall incoherent. The  characters never develop beyond an half dimension and you can care less  what happens to them. I realize what the director was going for,he was  trying to imitate redneck zombies but he failed miserably because troma  cornered the market on ultra violent,shocking,exploitation movies and it's  hard to say but they do it with more class and with a serious sense of  humor.",921110400,,670,4.981981981981982
