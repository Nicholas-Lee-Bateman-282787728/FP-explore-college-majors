I received this item within a reasonable time frame, When I opened it I was quite amazed and disappointed by the low quality of the box the DVD arrived in, The flap that the disc rests on inside was very loose and after removing the DVD from the box it appears that this was probably burnt on a store bought set of cheap discs and and an average DVD burner.
As well as that the image on the disc looks like it was put on with a very low grade DVD label printer.

Quality of Content : Good / Reasonable

The quality of the content on the DVD itself is fairly good the quality is sufficient and not glitchy or anything, It works very well.
The tutorials which are given by the instructor Trevor Hensley are good and informative to the viewer.

Conclusion:

If your looking for good tutorials and not a low grade quality dvd box and disc you might be better off just going to the ""stan winston school website"" and just paying on the spot to watch their online tutorials and or webinars.

I think it would of been a great idea for the people who made this DVD to include a UltraViolet digital copy mainly because for the price paid an individual should get more for their money.

Because as a stand alone dvd this item most certainly is not worth the amount that they are asking for you to pay.",1400630400,,1326,4.238095238095238
