8137659,2,B000H8S052,"I was looking for something I could use to supplement an oral presentation. I work with people in recovery - high risk for many STDs - and this would have put people to sleep in 5 minutes. It was 'nice to know' information, but there was nothing in it that I care to share in a DVD format that I could not do more effectively with an oral presentation. Unfortunately, there is never an informative AND interesting DVD series of STDs. I would recommend the HBO series ""Addiction; Why Can't They Just Stop?"" as one of the best DVD presentations on said subject.",1194825600,2,559,4.436893203883495
