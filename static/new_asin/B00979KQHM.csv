8537338,5,B00979KQHM,"HART'S WAR is an incredible WWII film set in a German POW camp. Bruce Willis plays Col. William A. McNamara, senior ranking American officer in the camp. Colin Farrell plays Lt. Thomas W. Hart, who has been recently captured during the Battle of the Bulge. Hart had attended Yale Law School. There is a murder in the camp and a downed Tuskegee Airmen is accused of the murder. Col. McNamara organizes a court-martial with the permission of the camp commandant Visser, played by Marcel Iure, and Lt. Hart is chosen to defend him. The court-martial is an elaborate ruse to cover a planned escape and more. HART'S WAR is an interesting film. It is worth seeing to watch Bruce Willis' performance. Bruce Willis' Col. William A. McNamara is a very strange character as probes and manipulates people and events. I thought Rachel Portman's score was very interesting and brought out the underlying humanity of what unfolded. HART'S WAR is an incredible film and that is just the point. It is a dark and moody film, but under it all, it lacks credibility. If HART'S WAR had been simply an outright battle of wits between Col. McNamara and commandant Visser I think it would have fared much better.

Director Joel Schumacher's TIGERLAND and his minimalist approach used in this film really work and the term Auteur comes to mind. It is a Vietnam era war film that never leaves the United States. The film focuses on recruit Roland Bozz a rebellious loner who gets released from the stockade and joins a platoon that is sent to Fort Polk, Louisiana where the Tigerland training area is located. Colin Farrell plays Private Roland Bozz. Roland Bozz is a born leader, but he's trouble. Yet like any born leader he can get the job done his way. He is hated and despised by most, but he is a wheel. The Tigerland training area is the last stop before shipping out to Vietnam. The training there is rough and rugged and it replicates the dense and thickly forested jungles of Vietnam. Colin Farrell as Private Roland Bozz is a real standout. He makes friends and enemies. He is a pacifist at heart and he has ways of getting recruits discharged from the army using the system. The training exercises at Tigerland mimic real scenarios and real death is always a possibility. The story, the camaraderie and the tangled web that gets woven, the overall outcome is something to see. This is a great film and totally underrated.

WINDTALKERS is a good WWII movies filmed over the past few years in that brings attention to these uniquely qualified men of war to draw upon their heritage in this time of global conflict. It is a multi-layered and multi-faceted tale told visually through incredible images enhanced with armor piercing sound effects. The dialogue really has to take a back seat to this simple tale of men and their survival because the images of the land, the bleak faces and the carnage tell it all. This film is named WINDTALKERS but the film does not really focus on the code developed by the Navajo Marines. Director Raoul Walsh had peripherally addressed the Navajo code in 1955 with his film BATTLE CRY with Felix Noriego as Marine Crazy Horse where we saw Japanese operators baffled while listening in on radio and field-telephone transmissions. Director John Woo, as did Raoul Walsh, decides to focus his attention on the men and their diverse backgrounds and what makes them Marines. However, Woo narrows his focus on the relationship between a war-weary, shell-shocked and enigmatic Marine sergeant (Nicolas Cage) and a good-natured naive Navajo recruit (Adam Beach) assigned to him. Beach can't understand the actions or behavior of loner Cage's intensity for killing and bloodshed but learns eventually that if you survive you then increase your chances of having your comrades around you survive as well. Woo is a director noted for action and WINDTALKERS contains some of the most frenetically staged sequences ever filmed. These sequences reminded me of some of Sam Peckinpah's cathartic work from THE WILD BUNCH, the montages of the combat maelstrom of his CROSS OF IRON and the intensity of the intimate fighting of combatants from Edward Zwick's Civil War epic GLORY. This is not action for the sake of action that can be easily labeled on John Woo. Woo is making a statement that all this carnage can be addictive yet simultaneously it usually creates and strengthens intimate camaraderie. But you really can never afford to be close to any of your buddies and this is a highly moral conflict. Is battle weary hardness a symptom or a mechanism to survive? This is the price of defending the ideals that we hold so dear. This is a very subtle and great film that can be easily glossed right over for its true meaning and realization. WINDTALKERS draws attention to forgotten heroes.",1421625600,,4795,4.817961165048544
