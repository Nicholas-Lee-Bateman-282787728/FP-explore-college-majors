8323843,5,B0000D0YV9,"The Documents of Destiny series provides students access to the thoughts of great minds from prestigious Universities such as UCLA and UC Davis in California, the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey, University of Connecticut in Storrs, Connecticut and Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Each subject matter expert has a sense of passion when they speak about the various topics. I can't tell if it is their love of history or their love of teaching that is coming across but that is irrelevant. What is relevant is that it draws you in and keeps you interested. While editing the programs I would occasionally find myself just sitting there listening to what someone was saying and the narrators voice would come in and the screen would go black. My next thought of course was 'Okay John, you can watch the program when you're done with it now get back to work!'
Transformation and Industrialization. When I saw that sub title for the first time I thought, 'How am I ever going to get that to fit on the television screen and make it legible!?!' Well, I did it. This program carries the viewer through the end of the 19th century and shows how American government dealt with the industrial revolution and made it's decisions, good and bad. As the nineth program in the series, it continues to deliver great knowledge to expand the minds of everyone.
