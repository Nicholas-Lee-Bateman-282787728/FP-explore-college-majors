7926253,5,B00004XQOR,"""The Bicycle Corps: America's Back Army on Wheels"" provides a historical window into several interesting subjects: America's black military prior to the world wars and the influence of bicyle transportation right before the automobile age. It possibly explains Mark Twain's humorous use of knights riding military bicyles in ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,"" and gives you a window into my hometown of Saint Louis and its Forest Park before the Worl's Fair, where this epic bicyle ride ended.",1358208000,,505,5.325
7926254,4,B00004XQOR,"This documentary provides excellent detail and photographic stills to bring back to life an almost forgotten experiment in the US military background.  The story is still fresh, and its obscurity just proves that history is more fascinating than fiction.",1113264000,5,254,5.512820512820513
