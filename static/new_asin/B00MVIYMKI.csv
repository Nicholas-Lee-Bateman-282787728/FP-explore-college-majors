6602632,4,B00MVIYMKI,"This is a pleasant romantic film set during the holiday season.  A young black woman named Jennifer comes home when her father is hurt and, business executive that she is, she immediately sets about getting him into a nice retirement home where he can be looked after; she's already selling the house.  But then she makes a wish and things change.
  A very enjoyable movie with a good cast; in some parts it is sweet and serious, and in some parts it is very funny.  I've only seen it once but I'll be seeing it again.",1416355200,5,518,4.354166666666667

8674867,5,B00MVIYMKI,"This is a fantastic movie.  It's very similar to the movie The Lake House where a man and a woman are living in two different time zones, and yet are able to communicate with each other through letters.  Tatyana Ali is hilarious in this movie, and should definitely do  more comedy roles.  She also has a fantastic singing voice.  This is definitely going on my list of top 5 Christmas movies which I will watch year after year.",1480809600,2,428,4.435897435897436
