1817602,5,B00007KK1U,"Keep in mind that the director of this film was an atheist, and that one of his primary purposes in filming it was to experiment with a new/different cinematic style. Therefore, no fancy sets or backgrounds, just a concentration on the life of a very devout, simple, and loving young girl. Not her whole life, only bits and pieces of how she thought, what she said and did, and what life in a Cloistered Convent was like. l've seen this movie several times, and not once did l see any overt or obvious act of the so-called lesbianism. See it for its spititual message, and keep in mind that after this movie was released there was a solid increase in applications to Carmelite Convents and a more solid interest in the life of St. Therese of Lisieux, also known as the Little Flower.",1079913600,91,783,4.4825174825174825
1817603,4,B00007KK1U,"This intimate, intense little film shows the making of a saint `from the outside.' When I first saw it, I was so impressed by the portrait of young Therese Martin that I learned all I could about the icon she became to the Roman Catholic World. The after-death publication of her stubby-pencil autobiography ""The Story of a Soul"" captured the attention of the devout. She rapidly came to be known as `The Little Flower' or ""St. Therese of Lisieux"" and was canonized in 1927, becoming co-patroness of France with St. Joan of Arc, and a ""doctor of the church"". The film shows us this giant figure of the faith as she appeared within the hermitically sealed world of a Carmelite convent-a little girl with quietly extraordinary qualities. No music or heavenly light announces her holiness. The scenes are barren, the light is directional and shadowed, as in a Caravaggio painting. The film presents a series of vignettes, as though on as shallow stage. Within each one, she seems to seek to hide, not allowing herself to dramatize even her own illness and approaching death. But the reactions of other sisters reveal her. An elderly nun chooses her as confessor, surrendering to her the one private possession she has retained, against the rules, for 50 years. A confused and unhappy young sister responds to her clear-eyed and loving compassion. A crabby older sister showers her with flowers and asks her for the relic of a fingernail clipping, astonished that she is unable to withhold her homage. Most important, her Mother Superior, who alone knows her secret desire to become a great saint, requires that she write down the thoughts of her heart, knowing that they will be important. Believers will be moved, the merely curious may find themselves breathless.
One vignette in particular, stays with me as a beautifully rendered cinematic explication of her character. I have never in all my researches on St. Therese encountered a narrative that `validates' the scene, but it has a haunting truthfulness. Therese is working in the kitchen with another sister. A box is delivered. When opened, it proves to contain a huge, live lobster. Therese boldly lifts it, though she is clearly frightened and awed by its claws and its repulsive appearance. But it is too large for her hand, and falls heavily to the floor, writhing and snapping on its back. She bends over, rights the thing, and picks it up. As she bends, blood streams from her mouth-a hemorrhage from the lungs, and the first sign we see in the film of the tuberculosis that will painfully kill her. She smiles radiantly to her companion sister, wiping the blood away, and saying that she `bit her tongue.' Thus, Therese faces death. I am struck by this scene because it reflects another painful scene in Dostoevsky's  novel, The Idiot.  A tubercular young student recounts a nightmare in which he is trapped in a room with a huge scorpion he knows he cannot escape. His terror and horror at this entrapment by inexorable death contrast strongly with Therese's outward reaction, though we later learn that she, too, is afraid. The difference? She boldly asserts her fear as a test of her faith, and continues to give herself to the God she no longer can see.
I see that some reviewers have been unnecessarily disturbed by the young nun who is so attached to Therese. This isn't a sick modern-day attempt to introduce'lesbianism' into the convent. It illustrates that one of the great difficulties religious must face is the inevitable temptation to form special attachment to another individual. Such special, individual love IS a problem for those trying to focus all love on an invisible God. Watch closely. You will see that Therese knows her fellow sister is troubled. Clear-sightedly, but lovingly, she refuses to participate in that exclusivity. The disturbing scene in which this sister eats sputum Therese has coughed up from her dying lungs is clearly based in the girl's attempt to emulate the actions of St. Catherine of Siena, who drank water used to wash a leper's skin. This action is 'perverse' only to those who do not understand it as an attempt to participate sacrificially in another's human suffering. Where the young sister is 'wrong' is that she would do such an action 'for Therese' but probably not for a stranger who is, as Mother Teresa of Calcutta would put it ""Jesus in a distressing disguise."" Therese herself costantly reveals less self-dramatizing sacrifices in her 'Story of a Soul.' To some, she appears extremely neurotic. To me, her 'craziness' appears the insanity conferred by divine love. Such madness for love of God will always look bizarre to non-participants.",1077148800,149,4662,4.922490470139771
1817604,1,B00007KK1U,"I love St. Therese and have read her autobiography, letters, and poems.  Unfortunately, this movie does not do justice to Therese.  At times, the movie is kind of creepy, paying undue attention to a lesbian nun in love with Therese.  This nun is almost the co-star of the movie.  It seems to me that the film maker is critical of Therese and the Carmelites.  This is not a movie for children in particular, because it would only confuse them.  Actually, it would probably confuse anyone. What a shame. The movie gets 1 star only because of good acting by the woman who plays Therese.  The movie has other faults, but I'll not dwell on them because its really not worth it.",1066608000,32,672,4.5041322314049586
1817605,4,B00007KK1U,"Can't believe how the reviewers on this page overlook some serious subtexts in this film.  It's a dark movie and the setting is so stark and minimal it could have been on a stage or filmed in black and white.  However, I can understand devout people getting swept up with the film because of the actress who plays Therese--I have seen all available photos of St. Therese and this actress looks just like her, down to the rosebud lips.  Luke Films also recently came out with a film on St. Therese that will make traditional Catholics happy, but its American actress who plays the lead role is a far cry from this one.  She is thoroughly French yet has all the sweetness, spiritual romanticism, and innocent exuberance Therese of Lisieux emits from her autobiography. However, these French film makers certainly make their late twentieth century, post-Christian European statement on the mentality of a turn of the century Carmelite nunnery.  One young nun who is obviously rather mental apparently also has some lesbo hots for Therese, but her angst leads her to escape via a knotted cloth as if she's in a prison (I read the autobiography several times as a teen and don't recall Therese ever mentioning any ""jail-break"").  The cranky old nun Therese wrote about is featured in this film and with impressive detail.  The film depicts a bizarre spectacle of the nuns at Christmas taking turns cradling and dancing about with a creche figure of the Baby Jesus as if it were a real baby, as if we're being told these nuns are acting out their repressed and thwarted motherhood.  There are indeed other messages the makers plug in this setting of severity that seems more like S&M to people of our generation and it was possible such holy self-abuse prematurely killed Therese who died of TB in her early 20s.  I'm not defending such extremes that Carmelites of that time performed--in fact, rather than such unnecessary extremes, I'd prefer along with the doctor (the voice of the film maker?) who says ""This place should be burned down""--but just be forewarned of the film maker's subliminal commentaries.
Nevertheless, I found this film was very worth seeing and buying if watched with a critical eye.  Besides the excellent performance of this actress who portrayed one of my favorite saints, I was very touched and deeply stirred by how the film showed the great love and affection among the Martin sisters (Therese had two or three sisters in the convent), especially how one sister was the embodiment of perfect love, empathy, and attentive care for Therese as she suffered in great misery in her final stage of tuberculosis.  Parents who have to contend with kids obsessed with sibling rivalry should sit them down and show them that beautiful scene.",1064880000,32,2755,4.8528784648187635
1817606,5,B00007KK1U,"This is not the film about a Theresa who lives in India.  This is the french film about the life of St. Therese of Lisieux, also known as the ""Little Flower"".  It is one of the best attempts of movie makers to put spiritual life and inner experience on film.  Intensely intimate and sometimes a bit shocking, Therese ranks up there with Kundun, Why has Bodhidharma left...,Last Temptation of Christ, Passion of St. Joan of Arc (silent film) and others that are uncompromising in showing inner experiences of saints and mystics. Highly recommended!",1043625600,17,547,4.860215053763441
1817607,5,B00007KK1U,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Therese/dp/B00007KK1V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Therese</a>&nbsp;is, in my opinion, the best film ever made about St Therese of Lisieux, the ""Little Flower"". Alain Cavalier's stroke of genius lay first and foremost in the choice of the young French actress, Catherine Mouchet, to play Therese. I truly believe I will never in my lifetime see any actress top her performance. She captures all the youthful joy and innocence of Therese. She is so wonderfully ALIVE. I didn't know much about St. Therese beforehand. I have never been as moved by a film since, except for Mel Gibson's THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST. I experienced a ""Springtime of the soul"" after seeing it, started going to daily Mass and became a daily communicant. Little miracles started to happen. This film turned me into a hopeless ""Thereseophile"". I'm a cradle Catholic who's read nearly every single book ever written about her. I own 6 statues of her along with every image of every size and type - holy cards, photographs, drawings and paintings. I've been to her national shrine countless times. I take off work every year on Oct. 1 to celebrate her feast day. Even my license plate reads LTLWAY.
This film may not appeal to everyone. It is very unconventional, very stylized, surprisingly and refreshingly different. It was filmed like a stage play, with minimal props. Only photographic-studio-type backdrops are used, very effective in focusing all the attention on the actors and actresses. It's more an interpretation of Therese rather than a blow-by-blow, totally factual story of her life, as in Leonardo diFillipis's THERESE. It has some completely fictional characters and content which may be troubling to some. To me, this FEELS like what I imagine the real Therese to have been. What's important is that the real essence of Therese is captured here, and I love to imagine the real Therese was very much like Catherine Mouchet's portrayal of her - filled with joy, innocence, and childlike trust. This Therese is obedient to a fault, just like the real Therese was. She has compassion. She willingly makes sacrifices for others. Like the real Therese she thinks only of others and never of herself. And she has a sense of humor, just like her namesake. Therese by all accounts was a great mimic and even in Carmel she often entertained the other sisters with imitations of others. The younger sisters in the community were always disappointed when she was absent for recreation because then they said it was going to be boring without her.
I found this film to be light years from the diFillipis film THERESE (2007). I appreciate the fact diFillipis stuck strictly to the facts, but overall I found his version plodding, tiresome, and boring. I had been anxiously awaiting its release for several months. I left the theater feeling very disappointed and let down.
One last thing - make sure you ask the seller beforehand if their copy is the original version, in French with English subtitles. I unknowingly bought a dubbed in English version from a well-known Catholic seller some years ago who didn't say in their catalogue listing that it was a dubbed version. Because of this they refunded my money, even though it was against their policy to accept returns on VHS tapes.",1363219200,5,3327,5.084095063985375
1817608,1,B00007KK1U,"I threw this movie in the trash after watching it and felt guilty for having given any time to it at all.  It is a repulsive attack on the life of this holy woman. She is shown as mentally ill and secretly hating her Catholic faith.  there is a scene where she drops a crucifix, steps on it and intentionally drags it along the floor under her foot...the directors attempt to somehow suggest her disrespect for Christ. There are many disturbing scenes which are based on the sick, anti-Catholic imagination of the director and not at all on any facts about St. Theresa's life. The only person who could enjoy such a film would have to have a similar hatred for Catholicism and be fond of these creepy, repulsive, so-called artsy movies.  It taught me to do my research before buying a movie that I think might be edifying!",1334016000,6,822,4.503355704697986
1817609,2,B00007KK1U,"I have been studying the life of St. Therese for some time now.  I have also participated in retreats and meetings with third order Carmelite OCD.  At first I was impressed by the innocence of St. Therese captured in this film.  Almost no secular films get the supernatural life of the Church right.  The vinyettes are unusual, artistic and beautiful. The first third of the film beautifully captures the ardour of faith and a soul drawn and courted by the love of God.  However the doubt of secular natural reason which has no notion of the supernatural and the evil of the sin of jealousy dominate and the inner workings in the soul of Therese are not portrayed enough to stir the soul of the viewer.  Insinuating that tasting the spitum of a tuberculoan or skin of a leper is a means of uniting with the cross of Jesus is nothing but sick thinking and the vulgarity of this scene would almost turn even the most faithful away from the beautiful notion of true sacrifice. Overall this film would have shaken my faith in religious life but I personally know beautiful Carmelite nuns who have lived their vocations for 40 years.  I've also seen real life documentary films such as The Nun which are much more natural and beautiful.  I am surprised that the Church condones this film which I believe would turn the doubtful away but conversely strengthen the more developed soul against the uninformed secular culture.",1303516800,,1417,4.685483870967742
1817610,1,B00007KK1U,"I was not crazy about the American movie about St. Therese because I felt it portrayed the characters as too one-dimensional, and everything felt too airy fairy.  However, after seeing this film, the American one now seems like a pure gem.

This movie portrays St. Therese as a demented, neurotic, little creep. It portrays the monastic life as something that is dreary and rather depressing.  It seems to me that the movie was based far more on the director's opinion of Catholic monasticism than on the actual life of St. Therese itself. For anybody interested in the actual life of St. Therese I recommend reading her autobiography, and avoiding this film at all costs!",1302220800,5,672,4.87719298245614
1817611,1,B00007KK1U,"The setting of this film was entirely on stage and thoroughly cinematic with a sense of darkness and lack of joy all throughout.  It's not that the characters didn't express joy, it's just that I couldn't feel their joy from the way they expressed it.  I found it to be at the utmost unusual, not in the least bit inspirational, and even scary to watch.  I haven't read ""Story of a Soul"" (St. Therese's autobiography) but know about St. Therese's ""little way"".  If I were to rely on this film alone, I would certainly have a misconstrued understanding.

I've watched other films on saints, including ""Bernadette"", ""The Passion of Bernadette"", and ""St. Teresa of the Andes"", and found these films to be so much more inspirational.",1289088000,5,729,4.753968253968254
1817612,5,B00007KK1U,"This film is a wonderful tribute to the life of Saint Therese. I love the way that it is shot in a very minimalist fashion and conveys the life of the enclosure beautifully.
The film is composed of vignettes of her life and many of the important moments that Therese faced are covered. The nuns chanting is soulful and I have watched this movie many times and never fail to be moved by the acting and message that it conveys.",1232755200,8,425,4.325
1817613,2,B00007KK1U,"I found it very hard to give this movie a ""1-5"" rating. It isn't that kind of a movie.

This movie is less a movie and more a chronological series of audio-visual poems, done with great care in the technical artistic details. In the craft of it, the movie is extremely well done. Like poems, the more these scenes speak eloquently to some of us, the more they are not going to speak at all or are going to carry an entirely different message to others.

Although millions of Catholics would probably understand the movie reasonably well, I think a person with no background knowledge of the story of St. Therese or of the Carmelite life is either going to be misled or else find the story simply baffling. A great deal of vitally important foundational information is left unsaid. If you didn't understand the rule of life that operates in a Carmelite convent, for instance, the places where exceptions were made would go unnoticed. I don't see how a Protestant who has never read the autobiographical writings of St. Therese could watch this film and not walk away wondering why on earth Therese is so inspirational to so many, let alone why she was made a ""Doctor of the Church.""

Since all of the actresses dress identically (obviously!), keeping track of which story is which is not a piece of cake. Also, a great many liberties are taken in the story. In order to contrast Therese's simple faith with the real excesses that might have existed within the world of cloistered orders as a whole in her time, stories were made up that probably had no place whatsoever among the sisters that St. Therese actually lived with. The result is to portray her convent as a more or less emotionally and psychologically diseased setting, something not found in Therese's first-hand depiction. The faults of the sisters she lived with, where she depicted them at all, were far more of the common garden-variety human faults that we all know quite well. Her story is one of living a quietly holy life among pious people with the ordinary faults that even the pious struggle with, not one of finding one's way amongst women with, for example, sadomasochistic tendencies. Again, a person who had not read about her writing would have no way of knowing this.

This movie would be a really poor way to get acquainted with St. Therese or the doctrines she developed in her writings. It is, rather, a poetic comparison between true and false sanctity. Taken that way, I can see why some are so enthusiastic about it. As for myself, I couldn't get past the short shrift given the ordinary ""little"" life that Therese lived and most of us live, a life that she found can offer great opportunties for deep sanctity.",1187568000,14,2695,4.667368421052632
1817614,2,B00007KK1U,"I first watched the Vatican-approved version with Lindsey Younce in the starring role, and while I enjoyed the film as part of my growing admiration for Therese, I felt the film was too emotionally drawn and lacking depth.

This film, evidently directed by an atheist, went to the other extreme...too artsy fartsy. And what's more, the director's atheism portrayed the saint as well as all the other nuns in the Carmel as deranged neurotics with a latent S&M streak.

I'm reading the writings of Therese and those who knew her. That's where you will find her spirit...not in this film.",1185667200,9,585,4.84

1817625,3,B00007KK1U,"First and foremost, this is not a traditional biographical movie. It is a theatrical, artsy, series of vignettes. Very French.

Secondly, there is very little that can be interpreted as being anti-Catholic, or scornful of Therese. The ancient expression of Christ as husband and lover may be surprising to modern ears, but it was part and parcel of Carmelite spirituality.

Likewise, one may not like to see flagellation and self-mortification through pain, but that is part of the tradition of the ascetic life, and not something to be ignored because it's uncomfortable.

Whether you enjoy the film or not, its basic presentation is not anti-Catholic or a betrayal of the life of Therese.

At the same time, you must read her writings yourself if you want to have any sense of this amazing young woman of God.",1142985600,31,811,4.897810218978102

I must say that it's nice to see the attempt at making Catholic oriented films, but the new movie is quite bad and perhaps shouldn't have been made.  This film, however, is wonderful.  It's filmed in the style of a stage production, so no LucasArts lightening bolts, etc., here, but it doesn't pretend to be anything more than that.  In a way it's simplicity is quite fitting when we consider the message of Therese (""the little way"").

I highly suggest this film even if you don't think you're into watching ""Catholic"" movies.  There's a beautiful life story here, and it's told very well.  A great family film that doesn't feel like a family film.",1142726400,21,701,4.650406504065041

One must realize that life in the 19th century was not convenient or easy--and the convent life depicted reflects various aspects of that. Also, French culture at the time of her life was tolerant of much innocent physical demonstrations of love among family members--also depicted in the film. Comments about St. Therese calling Christ her lover are obviously oblivious to the writings of St. Teresa of Avila, St. Francis of Assissi, St. John of the Cross, and the Lord Himself in the Bible in ""The Song of Songs"". To assign other vulgar meanings to these references by her in the movie is uneducated and parochial. I found this movie to be one of the most beautiful I have ever seen about her life. And if anyone things the sets were stark, I invite them to visit the Carmelite convent where Therese lived and died--compared to that, the sets used in the movie were luxurious!

Anyways, the content of the movie did not move me in any way.  Again, as a child I was moved by the two films mentioned above, so I thought this one would too.

Overall I would rate this as a better film than the more recent ""Therese"" about the same subject, though the target audience may be different.

Some creative license is taken with the story (including an invented character), but overall it creates a compelling portrait of the young saint and her desire to be united to Jesus despite seemingly innumerable obstacles. The pacing is slow, even dreamlike at times.

Watching this movie will focus the viewer on contemplating what a person will do for love, especially love of a God they cannot see, and how to love one's neighbor. I would recommend this to people of faith and those seeking, especially as material for reflection on a retreat, etc.",1430179200,2,1025,4.720670391061453

7977365,5,B00007KK1U,"Alain Cavalier prayed to St. Therese and his prayer was answered. He made this film in gratitude to the young French saint, who died of tuberculosis at age 24 in the ninth year of her life in the Carmelite convent in Lisieux. Catherine Mouchet actually looks like Therese and gives a moving portrayal of Therese, who had an impish sense of humor and who was aware of the frailties of our human existence, as well as being an ardent lover of the Lord Jesus Christ. This film's vignettes beautifully tell Therese's story, told by herself in ""The Story of a Soul,"" available in a complete version from the Institute of Carmelite Studies. The actor who portrays Therese's beloved father also resembles her father, and all the acting is superb. This film is a must for those of us who love the little Therese.",1393804800,2,804,4.629370629370629
