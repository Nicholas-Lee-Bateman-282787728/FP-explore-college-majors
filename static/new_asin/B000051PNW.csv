7929388,3,B000051PNW,"This is another one of Bruce Li's(excuse me, Ho Chung Tao's) better films. To make a long story short, he and some other friends go fishing, find some illegal gold from Vietnam, they find themselves in trouble with what appear to be triad gangsters over the loot, one by one they get killed off, Bruce Li fights one of the crime bosses to the death only to get shot down in the end by a nameless gunman right when he looks like he has room to breathe. This reminds me alot of Bruce Le's(the other Bruce Lee clone) Supergang, which followed a similar theme and had a similar end. A rare find and a keeper...and Bruce Li is being himself as opposed to mimicking Bruce Lee.",1157328000,,670,4.325396825396825
