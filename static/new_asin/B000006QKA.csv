Loretta Young had one of the longest, if not the longest careers in the history of show business, starting in silent films as a teenager then conquering talkies then eventually television. Her life story is interesting because this was a beautiful woman in a rugged industry who was a staunch Catholic. In Hollywood, after contracts at Warners and 20th Century Fox, she went freelance, an unexpectedly bold decision for a woman of her persona. Reconciling her private life to her religious beliefs while she maintained a very successful career makes her an icon of sorts.

This program explores all facets of the woman with invaluable input from one of her sons as well as from her daughter to Clark Gable born out of wedlock.  The program is more objective than Young's own biography which tactfully avoided any analysis of the the controversies of her life, concentrating on her spiritual life instead. The program has only been available on obselete VHS and has not appeared to date on DVD to my knowledge. In recent years, a number of Young's films have surfaced on DVD implying that interest in her is reviving. The VHS is worth tracking down if you are interested in the actress.",1264204800,,1301,4.829596412556054
