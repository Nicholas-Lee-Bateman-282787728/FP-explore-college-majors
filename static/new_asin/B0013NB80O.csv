The only thing was that there are no subtitles at all in any other language.  It is because some of the words in Portuguese are similar/same in Spanish that i can pick up bits and pieces of the dialogue. But dispite that, i really enjoyed watching the show. The character of Emilie is so cute that you cannot help but fall in love with her. The actress are great and the story line is really good. The behind the scenes were great too.

If you are fan of the movie then take a chance.",1213747200,,701,4.155555555555556
