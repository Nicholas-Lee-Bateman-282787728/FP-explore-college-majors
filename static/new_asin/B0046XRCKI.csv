4271194,5,B0046XRCKI,"Oh this movie or mini drama or whatever they call it was something I believe anyone with a beating heart would enjoy.  I both laughed and cried while watching this thing, and still catch myself getting a little tearrie eyed during some of the scenes.  BUY THIS DVD.  IT IS WORTH IT.",1352246400,4,282,4.384615384615385
4271195,5,B0046XRCKI,"Words don't describe how much David Tennant shines in this series. As a doctor who fan i always knew he could act - mainly seeing the fun, action side. This series - you're heart will break for him as you watch his heart break. He makes you feel like he's not even acting and you are just watching a friend struggling....",1340668800,6,321,4.278688524590164
4271196,5,B0046XRCKI,I loved the movie!!  David Tennant is amazing.  It works on my computer and I love it.  The movie is very emotional and stirring.  It makes you think of things yourself in your life.  It was a very good movie.,1305676800,12,209,4.125
4271197,5,B0046XRCKI,"I really enjoyed 'Single Father' and recommend it for anyone that wants to see more from David Tennant.  His acting is fabulous as always.  Paired again (briefly) with Laura Fraser (Casanova, Neverwhere), and then with Suranne Jones (Doctor Who fans will recognize her as Idris/The TARDIS from 'The Doctor's Wife') David's depth of emotion and angst in this one is just amazing to watch.  Rupert Graves (Sherlock) also makes an appearance as the father of the deceased mother's eldest daughter Lucy.  The talent of the younger actors in this is very impressive as well.  The BBC really should put this on BBC America and release a region 1 version.  I'm sure plenty of fans would greatly appreciate it.",1406678400,3,702,4.906779661016949
4271198,5,B0046XRCKI,Another great performance by David Tennant. This is a true to life but sad film. You will need a multi-region DVD player to view this film in the USA.,1405468800,,150,4.206896551724138
4271199,5,B0046XRCKI,This mini series is excellent. I have had it for about a month and have watched in multiple times. Excellent.,1380672000,,109,4.5
4271200,5,B0046XRCKI,"Such a beautiful show.  Both heartbreaking and heartwarming, and superbly acted by the whole cast.  I bought the DVD because I love David Tennant's work, but I fell in love with the whole show!",1376438400,,193,4.647058823529412
4271201,5,B0046XRCKI,This series was an emotional one that all the actors did a fabulous job with. I enjoyed it greatly. Only wish I could have gotten as a region 1 here in the States.,1373500800,2,163,3.9696969696969697
4271202,5,B0046XRCKI,No actor does angst better than David Tennant and In Single Father that talent shines.  My only complaint is that it moves a bit fast. This series could easily have gone 5 episodes instead of four.,1372291200,,197,4.472222222222222
4271203,5,B0046XRCKI,"The movie was great, great!  David Tennant was 10 stars - brings every thing expected and more. The emotion he shows in the film is amazing. A real roler coaster from sad, to distraugh to angrey, to worry, to happy. The sex sceens were racey, I loved them , more skin from David. The story line was sad and later hopeful and then happy. The Kids were great in this , but David Tennant was definetly the supream star( he is) in this. This is the best acting by David Tennant and that is saying something with all the great acting he has done in other movies and tv.",1362614400,2,564,4.174311926605505
4271204,5,B0046XRCKI,"First, I was worried I'd never be able to watch a Region 2 DVD, but the seller (Factory Distributor) answered my email immediately and assured me it would work on my computer.  It worked perfectly.

Everyone in this four-part drama did an exceptional job acting.  David Tennant was superb.  The story was done in good taste and with a sense of reality not seen in most movies.  It showed the raw agony of losing a spouse/mother/friend and the ensuing turmoil that the surviving spouse must deal with, but did so without relying on melodrama or overacting to engage the audience.  The tight storyline and excellent acting made it impossible to only watch one episode at a time and was well worth a second viewing the very next day.  This is a very emotionally charged series, so have tissues handy!",1360108800,2,797,4.690647482014389
4271205,5,B0046XRCKI,"I bought it because David Tennant is in it and it wasn't shown here in the US. What I received was a story that had me in shock, tears, laughing at times. It's a story of a loving family in grief; a father who has to learn how to be more than the guy who comes home at the end of the day, to 4 kids and a woman he loves. When she dies, suddenly, he not only has to deal with his grief, but the children's and especially the 15 year old girl who he's raised as his own, but who has another father, supposedly from a one night stand. The problem, they never legally married. The story goes on with a ""helpful' meddling sister of the deceased mother, the sweet husband of this sister, the children's personalities .. the ex-wife,18 year old daughter from that marriage and her 3 year old. David Tennant is amazing as Dave Tiler, the father finally accepting the role of single father to 4 children and an adult child and grandchild. The best friend is also a factor and I suggest you buy the DVD to see what happens there. The children's acting in this is unbelievable, they have the emotions and depth that the script requires and even Evie, the youngest, has great talent. The 15 year old, acts with grace and beauty.
I suggest that you use the captions if you're not used to listening to the Glaswegian accent. It can be a little difficult to understand at times. This is no Doctor Who, science fiction, feel-good movie, but you can see the Good Doctor's personality in David Tennant learning to be a good father. Buy it. See it. You can see why people say David Tennant can play any part and make it a great movie.",1355875200,15,1615,4.281045751633987
4271206,5,B0046XRCKI,"I was familiar with David Tennant from his work as The Doctor in Doctor Who and as Hamlet. His wonderful performances in those roles made me want to see more. His performance in this just blew me away. Actually, all the performances in this are phenomenal. They're so authentic that watching this feels more like dropping in on real lives than watching a scripted drama. Single Father beautifully captures the complexities of modern blended families and made me laugh at some points and brought me to tears at others. I've watched it several times and still love it.

Technical note: These are discs meant for the European market. You'll need a multi-region DVD player to watch them. I bought one through Amazon and I'm very glad I did.",1353110400,8,736,4.75
