7820822,5,6302035716,This is a cool movie.  Quite entertaining and my god they wreck a lot of cars. I really enjoyed this obscure and little known film. Recommended,1391817600,,143,4.5
7820823,5,6302035716,"I enjoyed the movie despite it's slow pace,confusing plot(yet interesting,I object to an Priest being in the story. But it's not in an negative light which is good,and the imagery being used but it's not in an bad way either.)It's not Bond if your looking for that and not one of the best movies of the era and genre,Largely forgotten but still worth watching. It's on Netflix instant to see for yourself,I enjoyed Keach's character and Moore' and the Priest's character also the scenery and the Car Chases. The Damaging of the Monte Carlo(Poor Chevy.),The Scenes with Ringsby Tank Lines(Trucking Co.)White-Freightliner Cabover tanker truck doubles pulled by orange single axle WhiteFreightliner Cabover Daycabs(no sleepers).and the story is unique in it's way. Although an Brit passing off as an Italian?come on! Looking forward to add to my collection.",1352764800,2,854,5.240875912408759
7820824,2,6302035716,"When a film has as many alternate titles as The Sicilian Cross - Street People, The Executors, The Executioners and Opium Road among them - it's a pretty strong warning sign that it's not going to turn out well. Take the central casting: Roger Moore and Stacy Keach in an Italian movie about a half-Sicilian Mafia lawyer and his racing driver pal trying to find out who planted a million dollars' worth of drugs in a cross from Sicily that a gangster has donated to a San Francisco church - and Roger Moore's the one playing the Sicilian (""Smartest thing I ever did was to get you out of Sicily and into that English law school."" ""Being half-English, half-Sicilian was a good deal for both of us.""). Well, he was married to an Italian at the time, though it's more a sign of the poor state his non-Bond film career was in during the 70s during that long gap between his second and third bond films (he's even second billed) that he ended up being cast in an Italian grindhouse movie.

The general rule in exploitation flicks, particularly Italian ones, is the bigger the star, the weaker the film, and most of the money here seems to have gone on the leads with little left over for action scenes. In the film's one big car chase both cameras somehow manage to miss the one big stunt with an oil tanker overturning while Moore is very obviously doubled by a Bo Hopkins lookalike. Mind you, that's nothing compared to the Italian actor playing his father in the flashbacks, who looks like Baron Frankenstein decided to build a Roger Moore out of the leftovers of his first creation but had to fill in the gaps with bits of Richard Kiel.

In his defence, Moore never made a secret of using a running double whenever possible in the Bond films, though his natural run here isn't half as bad as Keach's, which makes him look like a sped-up silent movie clown. It's hard to shake the feeling that Keach's role was intended for Tony Curtis, though Keach models his performance on Bing Crosby in a Road movie (his best scene sees him scoring powdered milk from a geriatric hooker!).

With no fewer than six credited writers - Ernest Tidyman and Randal Kleiser among them - it's surprising just how bland and uneventful the film is. The central premise really doesn't make much sense and nothing particularly interesting happens along the way to the underwhelming climax. The unoriginality extends to Luis Bacalov's score, which brazenly uses Ennio Morricone's flashback theme from Fistful of Dynamite for its own flashbacks. The kind of film that you can watch while doing your homework or tax returns without worrying about getting a bad grade or a surcharge, there's little going for it other than curiosity value. If you do want to seek out a copy on DVD, it's available in an English-friendly version in Germany via Amazon.de.",1351555200,2,2823,4.653306613226453
7820825,5,6302035716,This is a Forgotten Roger Moore Classic. Outstanding Mobster action tale. Keach and Moore make a great team.,1180396800,,108,5.055555555555555
