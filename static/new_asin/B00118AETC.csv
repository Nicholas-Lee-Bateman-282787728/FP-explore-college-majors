8240918,5,B00118AETC,"Chico Caldwell leads this class of 5 female students in his motivating, drill sergeant manner.  His execercise system involves high repetitions of very small movements.  I like the way he counts out the reps of each movement which helps to keep you motivated and going until he says, ""Relax Easy!""  I also like that he tells you which muscles are being worked. A chair is used occasionally for support during some exercises. This is a more advanced version of his previous video. The music is a 80's and the set is obviously a hotel. I would say don't let the small movements fool you into thinking this is easy. Chico's jokes and personality make it fun - though challenging.  Get a copy of this if you can.  I had to buy the VHS version.",1330646400,2,739,4.485074626865671
