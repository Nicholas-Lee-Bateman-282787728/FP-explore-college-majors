1659698,4,B00005T33B,"I was 260 lbs and had just begun the atkins diet last february when I bought this tape (exercise is a must for atkins). I hated to exercise, but I found this tape delightful! It is quite a taxing workout if you are out of shape or obese, but after a couple of tries it is the perfect balance of sweat and fun. Without Richard I probably would never have become the devoted exerciser I am now. After a couple of months you'll need to switch to a more difficult tape (I recommend any of kathy smith's cardio tapes and tammi lee webb's Cardio Blast), but Richard is the best way to ease into an exercise routine.",1070496000,12,609,4.213675213675214

7953449,5,B00005T33B,"I rate this product to receive a five!!  Yes it's used, but in great condition! It came nice and clean and looks great! It also came swift without having to pay swift fee's!!! Now that is an economy saver!!! As a mom of an Autistic Teen I could not have asked for a better service provider, thanks ""goHastings""!!!

Autistic children do not always understand time and patience.  My son learns through music and his teacher is using this CD at school to help the student's exercise.  My son being on medication can gain weight easily and has to stay active.  He loves sweating to the Oldies 2 and the libraries do not have any copies where we live so I searched Amazon and found this company.  Could not be more satisfied!!!

As soon as the package came my son ran to the TV to play it and started exercising!!! Thanks goHastings!!!",1364774400,,830,4.456953642384106
7953450,5,B00005T33B,"This is actually the second time I have owned Sweatin' to the Oldies 2.
My first copy was a VHS and I wore it out!  This DVD is great and I
just love the extras that were included since the original.  The
music is great and gets you moving.  My two teenage daughters love
doing this workout and love the oldies music!  It gets us all
moving and feeling great!  We love you RICHARD! :)",1276128000,3,384,4.066666666666666

7953452,5,B00005T33B,"I have started to do Richard Simmons probably back in 3rd. grade.  My birthday: August 27th., 1984 Anno Domini.  I had just reached my ninth birthday before 3rd. grade.  I probably like Richard Simmons more than regular sports because I have autism to some extent, Tourette Syndrome, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and obessesive compulsive disorder (OCD), so I have probably not enjoyed things quite so much with other people around me.

""Sweatin' to the Oldies 2"" probably has great songs and great exercises.  It has more vigorous exercises than the original ""Sweatin' to the Oldies"" video.  It is also longer than the original ""Sweatin' to the Oldies"" video.

Tom DeWitt is the correct name of the reviewer, not Linda DeWitt.

Is this review at all helpful for you or no?",1153008000,7,793,5.0
7953453,1,B00005T33B,"This video has good dance routines, as well as songs. Teh dance routine for ""Windy"", was the best. It made me feel good and free. That's the only part I like about the video.
The video is low-impact aerobics, and takes alot of dedication to see results. It took a very long time to see the benefits of this workout. I can see how this video can benefit very large people, because it isn't too straining on the body.
But if you have the energy and stamina to really shed excess weight off you body. Well then I would suggest you do this workout everyday. Even twice a day. A low-carb diet wouldn't hurt much. Because it will be some time before you see major results.
It's a good complimentry after you have done some weightlifting, but I wouldn't suggest this video to anyone.
IT'S NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!",1088380800,,803,4.4324324324324325
