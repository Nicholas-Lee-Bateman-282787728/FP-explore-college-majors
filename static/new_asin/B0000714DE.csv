What a horrible and racist film. The characters are almost cartoonishly evil and the only voice of reason is an American WHITE man.
I'm sure none of the people who reviewed this racist lie about the Chinese community positively, are even Asian. No, this is NOT how the Chinese community is. I'm sure there are a few individuals who are like that, but they also exist in every race.
Asians are human... not cruel, heartless and/or naive, as depicted in this lie of a film.",1075680000,8,535,4.469387755102041
1799628,5,B0000714DE,"Now Chinatown is one of the rare (these days) films that sneaks under the Hollywood radar ... a film that is well acted, staged, written, produced, directed ...
Steven Dunning has created a film that sheds some light onto the world of immigrant workers ... new arrivals to our country ... aliens in an alien land ... but does so through empowering his main character ... and in a realistic way ... one which most people can easily identify wth in their own way.
Lianne X. Hu does a remarkable job portraying the main character Lee, who is abused by circumstance and status ... friendless but yet hopeful.  Steven Dunning also does a remarkable job ... not only acting in this film, but also producing, directing and authoring Now Chinatown.
I would have loved to have seen this film in a theatre ... however ... Steven Dunning has done such an excellent job producing the DVD that watching this film at home",1059091200,10,907,4.598765432098766
1799629,5,B0000714DE,"They don't make films like this anymore.  The slow, methodical pace might seem distracting at first, but it reminds you of life's genuine flow, of how a story would look if the lights and cameras weren't present.  So rare, especially for Hollywood; the pull of wider audiences normally prevents such work from even making it to the screen.  I'm anxious to see what this director does with his next film, if he can remain as centered as he did here.  Too many films today try to do too much, but films like this remind us of the old addage that less is definitely more.",1039824000,10,568,4.4326923076923075
1799630,5,B0000714DE,"well since the Los Angeles Times film critc Kevin Thomas and The Hollywood Reporter said it was great i saw it in a theater first, and they were absolutely right! i don't know how the director (Steven Dunning) did that and wrote and produced and acted, i kinda didn't realize that till it was all over, what a job! future clint eastwood, hehe. in a theater i've never seen guys crying too with the girls and then laughing right after that, my brother even tried to act tough but he loved that movie.  i hate knight in shining armour stories so at first i was thinking oh no, but then you see it's not that at all, and it's such a powerful emotional rollercoaster, the music was great- i want a soundtack from the movie's website, i saw an article in Daily Variety that this was one of their top 3 picks for theater distribution, i hope that happens because i saw the film at a festival and wanted to take others back but the screenings were packed ad sold out both shows, so i'll get the dvd, the director talked after it and said the dvd will be the next level of what people will expect of all following studio and indy dvd's as far as the extreme diversity of the extra content and even has new terms for things that we've never heard of yet, it's not chick flick, it's so inspirational once you hit the end and you feel so free and light, that was cool, so ship it soon!",1034294400,10,1374,4.224334600760456

1799757,5,B0000714DE,"Your movie, Now Chinatown, stimulated my senses and touched my emotions. Your realistic and sensitive portrayal of a Chinese immigrant girl struggling to survive in the Los Angeles Chinatown offers the viewer a real treat. Your  accurate perspective on a subject rarely explored by today's movie industry is a great contribution. You have decided to tackle a subject shrouded in mystery to most people. Most Americans have no concept of the behind-the-scenes drama that may occur daily at a Chinese Restaurant. Steve, you had succeeded in unfolding this subject in such a way that all audiences can not only understand but also connect and sympathize with the plight of the main character. Your movie is not only entertaining but it is also educating. Too bad there are not enough movies like yours out there in that vast Hollywood landscape. Please keep me posted about your future projects. I would love to get a
tape of Now Chinatown when it becomes available.  Your film was just superb! Please let me know when will you be in New York. I would like to meet you.

The actors were fantastic and we forgot we were even watching a film. Anyone can relate to this even though it is set in Chinatown. My husband was crying along with me and that is rare.

1799760,1,B0000714DE,"Honestly, folks, don't be fooled. This movie is the most stereotypical and racist films I have ever seen. It is amazing that we are in the year 2004 and that such awful portrayals of minorities could still exist in films like this.
Being a white man, I won't speak on behalf of the Asian people, but I know racism when I see it, and this movie is racist. The Asian characters are stiff, lifeless, and full of unhumanistic qualities that I was ready to shut off my DVD player and read a book. What was Steve Dunning thinking?
I can also guarantee that Steve Dunning is probably calling all his croonies to come and inflate his ego by praising his movie in the reviews who give him nothing but 5 stars. How pathetic. Don't be fooled. This is a terrible movie.",1080604800,3,757,4.375886524822695
1799761,5,B0000714DE,"I work for a women's help shelter and this film is a great lift to many of out clients who have been through terribly viloent situations and forced labor and sexual abuse. I know of a local Los Angeles shelter we work with and their own mission states what I think the writer of this film is trying to help by making people discuss the issue. Our shelters aren't here because there are no problems or people who need us! Thanks to the filmmaker!
The Asian Pacific Women's Center mission states:
Founded in 1993 by local attorneys and community activists who recognized the dire need for a long-term shelter (18 months) that could serve Asian and Pacific Islanders (APIs) as well as other women of color, APWC has developed a transitional housing program combining linguistic accessibility and cultural sensitivity of supportive services for the victims and survivors of domestic violence - women and their children.",1080000000,2,915,4.909677419354839
1799762,5,B0000714DE,"I am an Asian male who saw the film and the event where the director spoke. I learned a lot of things that day and researched more myself since I have heard stories like this but did not have to go through it myself.
The workers' isolation makes it difficult for them to access outside help and corroborate their stories for authorities.  ""Domestic worker cases- they're like this dirty little secret,"" says Jenny Stanger of Los Angeles' Coalition to Abolish Slavery & Trafficking. ""They're working in the private sphere, where you are least likely to detect slavery. I think it's an enormous problem; there are a lot of them out there.
""In many cases it's one person's word against another,"" adds Dr. Mohamed Mattar of Johns Hopkins University's Protection Project, a research institute dedicated to human trafficking. ""In many cases...we're talking about high-profile people, because who can afford domestic except somebody like a diplomat?""
just like in the film
A quote from one boss to their worker tells it all ""You don't even deserve to be in this country (U.S.). I only did you a favor by bringing you here and you don't appreciate it. You come from poor blood and poverty!"" just like in the film when they yell at her and think they are better than a poor country girl
my friend is a cop in Monterey Park, CA and gave me this which is on the city website, a city of hard working good Chinese families but like in the film things happen there too like everywhere-
The criminal ringleaders employed Chinese women as prostitutes in medical offices and private residences throughout Southern California. Organized Crime and Vice Division Prostitution Section detectives obtained a search warrant for a total of ten business and residence locations in Los Angeles and Orange Counties involved in this criminal enterprise. Locations searched were in Sherman Oaks, Santa Clarita, Westchester, Torrance, Redondo Beach, Altadena and Irvine.
On April 1, 2003, OCVD detectives arrested four suspects for 266 (h) P.C., Pimping. Qiong Feng Chou, 52, Kit Poon, 32, and Trisni Tedjasutisno, 30, were arrested at or near a residence in Irvine
-LAPD office of the Chief of Police
On July 17, 2003 the Monterey Park Police Department, in conjunction with the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, Los
Angeles Police Department, San Gabriel Police Department, and the Los Angeles
County Probation Department served search warrants at thirty locations
throughout the San Gabriel Valley involving members of the ""Black Dragon""
Asian Gang.  Officers from Glendale, Burbank, Alhambra, El Monte, Monrovia,
Glendora, Baldwin Park, West Covina, Pasadena, Azusa, Arcadia, and Whittier
Police Departments, Members of L.A. Impact, Los Angeles County and Orange
County District Attorney Investigators, and Agents from Alcohol Tobacco and
Firearms, and State Parole Agents assisted in the early morning service of
search warrants.
This investigation was the result of a three-year joint agency effort to curb
the criminal activity of the gang.
The ""Black Dragon"" Gang is a violent street gang that has been active in the
West San Gabriel Valley area since 1984.  Most of the members of the gang are
of Asian Decent.  The criminal activities of the
gang have included murders, attempt murders, assaults, drive-by shootings,
weapons violations, home invasion robberies, commercial robberies, extortions,
residential burglaries, auto thefts and the operation and/or protection of
houses of prostitution.",1080000000,6,3514,5.258467023172906
1799763,5,B0000714DE,"me and my friends had to comment on this after seeing the film, steven dunning was invited to speak at our university and he is truly doing good for many, he is standing up for those who are beaten down by giving them courage to stand up when they see what the girl in this film does, we are glad someone is showing what happens to many people, i found the sf weekly article and had to quote them:
Situations like this have been documented for years. The worker's isolation (i.e. not being allowed out of to make any outside contacts or friends) is so extreme and the culture of fear created by their employers is so great that the worker's believe they will suffer serious harm if they leave their jobs, and have no choice but to remain in and continue laboring in abusive conditions."" - Human Rights Watch researcher Carol Pier wrote in her report ""Hidden in the Home: Abuse of Domestic Workers with Special Visas in the United States. Like many, Alice was told not to speak to anyone because anyone could be an FBI agent ready to deport her. Also she was falsely told she could not venture far from the apartment because her visa did not allow her to go anywhere without her boss. And even forced to wash all laundry and dishes by hand even though there was a washer/dryer and electric dishwasher because her boss said she was paying HER to do the work.
Alice had come to the U.S. to make money to send back to her family, though her employer prevented her from doing so for months by telling Alice that she could not transfer the money by herself, but then refused to help her do it.  Without her sending money, Alice knew her family would starve.  She was told she first had to pay off her plane ticket here from Kenya.  Many Southeast Asian trafficking victims are forced into prostitution to pay off a $10,000 or higher U.S. dollar boat passage. Police raids on these houses that resemble prisons in the Chinese communities of the Los Angeles area are documented by the Los Angeles Times in recent years.
Whoever happens to enter the path of a victim seeking help is often their only hope, whether it be a neighbor or pastor as in Alice's case, or a stranger.  Alice went to Father Bob Moran at a local church and waited until everyone was gone before she approached him. ""She seemed kind of fearful, desperate. She said they took her passport away and she couldn't really go anywhere. It didn't seem right; she didn't seem to have much freedom."" Alice says `I was thinking America is the home of the free. I didn't understand why there is freedom and I am not free. I am like a prisoner in the land of free people."" Alice was left alone for a month and given only 8 dollars for food. She says ""It's hard, but I don't know. I don't know anything about this country.""  She finally escaped to a women's shelter where she has been for more than a year while struggling with the courts and her immigration status but has yet to tell her parents back home of all her troubles here. ""It took enormous courage for her to come forward and assert her rights against a powerful and influential person,"" says Kathleen Kim of the Lawyer's Committee for Civil Rights.  Alice states one reason for coming forward and exposing what many people think doesn't happen anymore in this country ""It's really hard, but if there is a hard thing like going without food, or living without my mother, I always think it is better if it doesn't happen to other people.""
i think alice is the real lee like in the film",1080000000,5,3496,4.437694704049845
1799844,5,B0000714DE,"I saw this review for Raise the Red Lantern (another good film) which also shows women being abused by men and other women around them just like Now Chinatown and I think someone smart got the point right. This reinforced the fact that Now Chinatown is a very well done film not about one race rescuing another, (since there is never more than a friendship between the two and the white guy is gone halfway through the film- she does it all on her own, he's just like a book she finds in the street showing her there is something different out there, so the jealous boys who can't make their own film should back off), it's a really a film about the class system that hurts us all in all countries and some other reviewers already cited articles on that subject. I would agree, so here's the clip I think says it right:
Most people no doubt lament the life of the women...really, one might say, trapped by a system of male privilege. But I would remind those who see only that, that for every woman the ""master"" has, that is one woman another man will not have. The system does NOT favor males. It favors wealth and privilege. In such a system there are many men without wives, fomenting unrest, which is why modern states forbid polygamy. What does a man do with the capital and power he accumulates or inherits? If the system allows, he spends it on women and the assurance of his paternity. This is the way humans are, and any sexist or racist interpretation of this movie misses this truth.",1079049600,6,1494,4.416666666666667

To be a successful person, it is not a piece of cake.  However, your dream which working in the film industry has become true.  After reading your personal record, I could imagine how hard you would have worked at the very beginning of the bottom ten

eight year old son was with me and complained,
but in minutes, he was engrossed as well.  Instead of the typical
""Boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl"" It was ""Boy meets girl,
boy empowers girl, girl sets herself free"".  How refreshing!
How beautiful.  This was a brilliant and captivating story.
It expressed many complex themes but it was conveyed with
such entertaining simplicity that my little boy thoroughly enjoyed it.
He and I talked about sociology and freedom all afternoon.
Obviosly, this film was targeted for adults, but the very mature
subplots went right over my son's head and I was there with him to talk
about the prevalent issues.  I thank you for the lessons you taught my son and I thank you for the reminders to me about taking my rights for granted.  The messages stuck with us.

I am a petite Asian woman who owns her own company and bosses people around just like the men in this film. I am not controlled by what the media shows and intelligent people don't base their character judgments on what they see on TV. I am no sellout but because I have seen COPS do I think that all whites are drunken trailer trash? Obviously they are not or this country wouldn't be so successful with people like you wanting to come here. I see this film and do I think all Asian men are nonsexual? Not the Asian guys I date. And do all older Asian men treat women from a superior stance? Everyone in my family did and we've been here a lot longer than the people in this film.

1799849,5,B0000714DE,"My sister lived like this and not very funny for her. She was glad to see herself in this moviefilm. I have copied this from the San Fransico newspapers.-
Accurate statistics on human trafficking are almost impossible to obtain because it remains such an underground problem and because the problem is not limited to one country or region. The U.S. government estimates 800,000 to 900,000 people are trafficked from nations all over the globe every year, a conservative estimate of 20,000 directly into the U.S..  Though the true size and scope of the problem are unknown, what is clear is that the American legal and social services organizations across the country handle more labor trafficking cases than sex trafficking cases.  The Freedom Network here in the U.S. is a coalition of 20 groups that work in trafficking victims, sees primarily labor related cases. In Northern California, Mie Lewis of the Bay Area Anti-Trafficking task Force says a majority of the regions trafficking cases involve forced labor of workers.",1078963200,6,1026,5.101190476190476
1799850,5,B0000714DE,"Okay, I don't know Steve Dunning but I know because I am not narrow minded that he is no racist and he could have made a film of facts ten times worse than this. And for my Asian brothers who are throwing the word racist around, you are only showing your own ignorance, you do not make us look good, but I know not all of us are that irresponsible. I work in this field and will add some truth to what is already in this film, even though it is slight and mild in comparison to many, many realities in our community and others. Do you also believe that Dunning would be racist if he had made Boyz in the Hood where real situations are also shown?  And if you saw that film I suppose now you believe that all black people live that way, right?
Human trafficking according to the UN
Jan 25 2004 New York Times Magazine story ""Sex Slaves on Main Street"" ""are horrendous factual lives which constitute only part of this international problem, instances involving people brought to this country under false pretenses remain a woefully overlooked and misunderstood crisis""
International experts have called this ""the human rights issue of the 21st century""
""It's not about chains and whips: it has to do with psychological imprisonment- as well as physical and sexual abuse"" -Joy Zarembka of Wasington, DC based Institute for Policy Studies which offers legal help and social services to trafficking victims.  ""People are threatened or spoken to in a way that makes them feel compelled to work because they believe there will be negative consequences if they don't.""
Such a larger problem across the United States, The Trafficking Victims Act of 2000 was passed in Congress, making it easier to prosecute traffickers while also offering protection to victims under the newly created ""T"" visa. Before the act was passed, abused, exploited and trafficked workers- whose immigration status is linked to their employer- had nowhere to run. Even if they had the opportunity to escape, they might still face deportation.
As President Bush himself recently said in a speech, ""There's another humanitarian crisis spreading, yet hidden from view. Each year an estimated 800,000 to 900,000 human beings are being bought, sold or being forced across the world's borders. Among them are hundreds of thousands of teenage girls, some as young as 5, who fall victim to the sex trade.""

She is practically an indentured servant in the Chinatown restaurant where she works.
This is something, unfortunately,  that is happening very often in real life.  There are many poignant scenes, particularly when the Empress, a local Chinatown dignitary played by award-winning actress June Kyoko Lu, gives comfort advice to Lee, the young woman played by Lianne X.

I mean, seriously, how many times do i have to be reminded that the role of an asian man on this planet is to oppress the asian woman?  And how many times do i have to be reminded that the only one that can ""save"" her is, of course, the white man?  What's sad though, is that i've actually seen this theme worked better in films like The Transporter, Pillow Book, and even Dumb and Dumberer (Don't get me wrong though, all those movies sucked too, so you figure out just how much worse this film is).  Seriously, did he think this concept was original?
Oh, aren't IR relationships just wonderful and liberating!?  Of course, there's never any mention of the exploited mail-order-brides, those horribly tacky military brides (and equally as exploited), or even the ever prepetual asian female self-hater (aka SELLOUT, aka Amy Tan, aka Maxine Hong Kingston, aka Kim Wong Keltner).  Why?  Because all's well in the land of la-la, and the only thing that would corrupt it is the hand of the evil asian MAN!  ... but boy do i love those asian women because they're so _______!",1075766400,9,1212,4.626168224299065
1799920,1,B0000714DE,"Wow, what an original script. Let's here:
Little Chinese woman immigrated from an oppressive nation and then further oppressed by her own people, family, and culture. She yearns to be something different - perhape to become WHITE.
Lo and behold, the WHITE KNIGHT in shining armor is here to the rescue. Frees the entrapped, fragile, and obedient Chinese woman from her oppressor that tells her that ""She will always be Chinese.""
Does it occur to any Chinese person that being Chinese is shameful? It is a default for a Chinese woman, in order to shed her shame for being Chinese that she must remedy this situation by running to the WHITE man?
Althought this is laughable garbage, but it is none-the-less powerful poison to the impressionable mind - the Asian youths growing up in America. These kinds of garbage from Hollywood and the like poisons our Asian youths to hate themselves, their parents, their culture, their upbringing.
THIS GARBAGE HAS TO END. Steven Dunning is a blatant racist and a deplorable human being for spilling such poison.
Let me tell you about the heroes of the immigrant Chinese. The brave and fearless parents that came to a foreign land with no money, no connection, no skill, and no English that brings their next generation to forge a better future. They work their hands to the bone to support their kids through higher education. They endure the hate and racism from their OWN KIDS, poisioned by the Steven Dunnings of America, yet still persevered and worked honorably for the better future of their children.
Here is challenge to the racist Steven Dunning: shed your wealth and lead your family to Vietnam and see how long you can survive? Steven Dunning, you are truly a piece of human waste.
Steven Dunning is nothing more than a two bit racist pig. I will spit in his face if I see him.
What a shame for humanity!",1075680000,12,1852,4.7368421052631575
7973870,5,B0000714DE,"Lianne X. Hu is a remarkable actress!  A tour de force performance...sometimes you can run across an Indie film that will leave such a great impression upon you and ""Now Chinatown"" is a great example!

I think for me Lianne's performance is what makes the film remarkable!  Her range of emotion is very impressive!

The story itself is predictable and some of the situations silly in my opinion but with the material she has to work with I was very impressed with her acting skills.

Steven Dunning who played the sensitive restaurant customer who comes to her defense is ok in his role but comes across wooden in his dialogue with Lianne...I think as a director, producer and writer he did very well for his first time effort.  This film seems to rein you in and the ending was superb emotionally!

Sometimes the best films aren't the big budget monsters....small independents like this really leave you with something.

Now don't get me wrong...there is a lot lacking in this film but watch Lianne X Hu's performance and how she reaches really deeply into her soul to bring this really believable character to life!

Casting directors pay attention.  Watch it and maybe consider this remarkable talent for fleshier projects!",1444953600,,1226,4.850961538461538
7973871,5,B0000714DE,"This film is a brilliant contribution to Cinema. It focuses on one woman's journey from fear to courageous triumph as she plows through cultural oppression to eventually discover beauty and freedom beyond the confines of a restaurant embodying abuse and cultural restriction. During her working hours in Chinatown she meets an American named ""Steve"", who witnesses the injustice she faces at the restaurant. After some confrontation made by him on her behalf, he soon offers his friendship to her and attempts to introduce her to a world filled with possibilities, once unknown. There is a good reason that it was highly recognized and awarded at the time of its release. I encourage anyone to see the movie.",1289174400,,708,5.05982905982906
7973872,5,B0000714DE,"It's so funny how people can only see their own reality and ignore the lives of others. Just because one doesn't know it or live it doesn't mean it doesn't happen or come from other's real life. this movie was made about a real person who lived this life and even worse things were not in the film. the director met her while he was teaching in chinatown LA. i saw the LA Times/Kodak screening where he spoke and he is real about equality. Kevin Thomas (LA Times) only writes good reviews for good movies. watch the LA news, dead chinese in containers land in san pedro shipping port, san gabriel cops raid brothels where asian girls are locked inside 'working' off their smuggler's payment. human trafficking is rampant. this movie is a girl not even treated as bad as other's reality! whites, blacks, mexicans can all be nice and help people, so no complaints if this is a black guy? think about who is a racist...and yes i'm chinese, lucky to not go through this but my friends have, even worse. and think about this, even though most of the woman suffering are by their own male kind, even terrible women run some of the trafficking houses. we should all wake up...click 'customer reviews' by the 4 stars to see i'm not alone. I love the one titled `shut up asian male cry babies, live our female life!', it's so true. and i don't think all the people who work at the women's shelters are lying. i support this film's message- everyone should be treated equal and have freedom of choice!",1234828800,,1491,4.485294117647059
7973873,4,B0000714DE,"If you can get over some of the bad acting, you'll see that this a very touching story. Lianne X. Hu plays Lee, who is a virtual slave in America, working at a restaurant to support her family back in China. Lee's life consists of going to work and going back home everyday, as she is forbidden to go out, have friends, or even listen to American music.

All this while she endures emotional, physical, and sexual abuse at the hands of those she depend on. Her only hope is her new friend, Steve, who seems to be the lone customer in the restaurant, except for a group of geriatric mahjong players. As Lee and Steve's friendship begin blossoming onto a romance, they are alienated from each other due to a misunderstanding.

It's heart wrenching to learn the extent of Lee's hardships as the movie unfolds. This movie was low budget, but I didn't mind the no-frills sets. My only gripe is that most of the actors were obviously amateur. (including director Steve Dunning, who really should stick to directing.) I did enjoy Ms. Hu's performance, she was very convincing as Lee, showing a wide range of emotion. My only problem with the script is that Lee and Steve gave up on each other too easily. After the misunderstanding, I can't believe they parted ways without one or both of them DEMANDING an explanation for what happened, especially with Steve's job situation. (I won't give away the ending.)

All in all, the story was good and I did shed some tears.",1183420800,,1460,4.586206896551724

This is a moving story of one such person with clearly Asian features who tries to make a go of it here. What she learns is that freedom is a relative term. She is bounds by the cultural rules and regulations within Chinatown, her Now. But what about her Tomorrow? Director/Producer/Screenwriter/Actor Steven Dunning takes the viewer down the dark alleys of a place even Chinese Americans no longer see as we move outward into the suburbs for better schools. But Lee is trapped--or is she?
This low budget indy makes many statements and awakens the complacency within us. Now I understand why this film was named one of the top ten DVDs of the year 2002. It has earned this honor.",1082678400,,822,4.523489932885906
