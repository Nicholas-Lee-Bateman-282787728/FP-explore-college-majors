8203570,2,B000S0KYT4,"This heavy, slogging series will test the patience of serious students of the subject. Excessively dramatic music, repeated shots of the same cannon-going-off, spear-waving, arrow-shooting grow tiresome. Sometimes it's the same shot of nothing more dramatic than a section of wall. The organization is at times confusing, as the narrator (Walter Cronkite!) drones from topic to topic. Images don't always square with narration. (e.g. While the narration insists flintlocks won out for early firearms technology, the pictures shown are men firing matchlocks!) And then there are the reenactors, the standard 15 or 20, shot over and over again, doing their best to represent Mongol hordes, French knights at Crecy, Aztecs fighting Conquistadores, and never enough to make a convincing image. And, OK, they bring in John Keegan to make the occasional pithy comment, but the narration and the images generally roll around him like a mighty river around a massive boulder: barely inconvenienced. The whole thing puts me to sleep. Anyone interested could start with Keegan's ""A History of Warfare,"" and Weigeley's ""Age of Battles,"" and proceed from there to more specialized works.",1405296000,,1175,5.426229508196721
8203571,4,B000S0KYT4,"As usual, ""Uncle Walter"" makes the obscure understandable.  The graphics and recreations of battles were interesting without being gory.  From the very primitive tribal clashes to the early Iraq war this showed and explained how warfare has evolved along with cities, countries and national ego.  All in all, a very watchable and interesting DVD.",1304985600,3,346,5.37037037037037
8203572,4,B000S0KYT4,"Though not historically perfect or accurate it is a well-narrated series that outlines how war and civilization are linked over two millenia. For amateur historians and people intrigued by the seeming necessity of all great empires to war, it should be of interest. What convinced me to purchase the set was the narration by Cronkite, which is a great selling point.",1304121600,,366,5.016393442622951
8203573,5,B000S0KYT4,"Fine documentary of World History through the study of war.  As technology changes we are introduced to the way of fighting since Ancient Greece to the technological and digitalized modern U.S. Army and we receive an explanation of how the society and the way of fighting was changed by technology or organization, being the introduction of gunpowder a step that allowed Western Europe to conquer the world.

The reconstructions of Armies and battles are very well made making use of some Hollywood or European movie footage as the case with the Battle of Leuthen, Zulu Dawn, and we also have outstanding reconstructions by reenactors as the Imperial Roman Army.  Some footage had a feeling of being cheaply made such as the reconstruction of the Macedonian Army and Alexander or the Late Roman Army footage but this does not diminish much from the rest of the production.

Especially valuable are the narrative and opinion provided by Sir John Keegan, one of the foremost authorities in military history.

One of the best documentaries I have seen and I highly recommend it.",1209686400,9,1075,4.983240223463687

This Learning Channel series gives an overview of mankind's tendency to make war, and ""improvements"" in fighting made throughout history, from the ancient Greeks to the present day --- Walter Cronkite, who has the proper stentorian tones as our narrator, is our guide for this eight-part, seven-hour exploration that-like the classic Ken Burns documentaries that have paved the way-combines still photos, archival footage, the reading of letters by historical characters, and reenacted events to create a compelling look at our past world events into war.
