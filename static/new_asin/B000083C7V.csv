2643632,5,B000083C7V,"I think Playin' Around The World is SOO Awsome! At the beginning when Anais said, ""Whassap Sacramento!"" That was at the Sacamento State Fair on September 2nd 2002, and I was there! (this year, aaron carter is gonna be there sept 1st) Later on you see Rosie walking into the portable holding a bunch of posters, and saying, ""That's cool"" real quick. Those were our posters! OMG! And inside the room You see Faye holding them. My friends and I gave it to them, and we got our t-shirts signed. It was great fun, even though we looked HORRIBLE! I got the old Play DVD, and the new ""Playin' Against..."" one, and they are both so awsome, It's like----I MET THEM!! EEEEE! I hope to meet them again soon :-)",1059868800,2,699,4.384615384615385

2643634,5,B000083C7V,"This DVD is so so so so SO cool! I especially loved the end with ""To Live And To Die For"" because I had never heard that song before (I currently only have the mini album). So anyway, here's a review of the chapters: (the heart to hearts are also awesome)
1. Intro: coolio ""I said brrr it's cold in here there must be some Play girls in the atmosphere""
2. Showtime!: awesome live show
3. Life On the Road: good summary of what it's like to be on the tour bus - with a bit of humor from the bus driver
4. Let's Dance!: shows some of the dance moves - pretty cool
5.(and 6.) Sing It Girls: awesome preview of songs from the new CD
7. Surf's Up!: haha get to see them learn to surf
8. Making of ""Us Against The World"" video: cool little robot dogs and (of course) great singing by Play
9. ""Us Against The World"" video: love the ninja scene
10. Making of ""M.A.S.T.E.R. Part 2"" video: nice touch
11. ""M.A.S.T.E.R. Part 2"" (featuring Lil Fizz from B2K) video: great moves (as the guy said, a ""hot video"")
12. ""I'm Gonna Make You Love Me"" video: from the first day, I just HAD to love this song
13. ""Cinderella"" live from Rotterdam video: nicely done
14. & 15. Outro & Credits: As I said before, I especially like this part because of ""To Live And To Die For"". It's such a beautiful song (to me) that sometimes when I sing the stronger parts of it I start to cry. It's definitely the best thing to end the DVD with. Overall, this DVD has earned a 5 star rating from me.",1045353600,17,1462,4.097560975609756

2643637,5,B000083C7V,"If you like Play, you'll love this DVD! It's packed with lots of cool stuff!
It kicks off with several live performances! Then you get to follow Anais, Anna, Faye, and Rosie on tour, in the recording studio, at the beach, on the tour bus, etc., etc.! Lots of footage of Play just ""hanging out"" and at work (like practicing their dance moves) is included!
There is also the videos for ""Us Against The World"", ""M.A.S.T.E.R. Part. 2"", and ""I'm Gonna Make You Love Me"". There's some behind the scenes of making the videos also!
This is a great DVD for Play fans! The young ladies are VERY cute and the whole thing is alot of FUN! My face hurt from smiling so much while watching it!! PLAY ROCKS!

8141528,5,B000083C7V,"Hey Everybody!!! I live in New Zealand and I didn't know if PATW would work on my DVD play since the dvd is Zone 1 and my player is Zone 4. IT WORKED! I screamed when it worked! Lol newayz.
It Has:
INTRO: which is their chant thingy which is introducing themselves
SHOWTIME, which they perform Us Against The World, Cinderella, M.A.S.T.E.R Pt. 2 and Im Gonna Make U Love Me without Chris(which is crappy but its still great lol)
LIFE ON THE ROAD, which is like in their tour bus and stuff
LETS DANCE, the girls practise a few of their dance moves like Im Gonna Make U Love Me, Cinderella and MASTER Pt 2.
SING IT, GIRLS Part 1, This is when the girls are in the studio and are practising I Must Not Chase The Boys.
SING IT, GIRLS Part 2, They practise Honey to the bee.
SURFS UP!, the girls go jet skiing and then they learn how to surf except Faye cuz she already knows how and shes the Camera Girl.lol
MAKING OF UATW, it shows behind the scenes footage of Us Against The World and the girls talk about how they got together. Since they were only 12 and 13, they still have strong Swedish accents when they're talking! Its really cute!
UATW VIDEO, Us Against The World Video
MAKING OF MASTER PT 2, Behind the scenes of MASTER Pt 2 and Lil Fizz talks for like 20 seconds!
MASTER PT 2 VIDEO, MASTER Part 2 video, I love this video!
IM GONNA MAKE YOU LOVE ME VIDEO, I LOVE THIS VIDEO AND THE SONG! CHRIS TROUSDALE IS SOOOOOOOOO CUTE! IN THE VIDEO, HE LOOKS REALLY CLOSE WITH ANAIS! THEY SHOULD TOTALLY GO OUT! THEY WOULD MAKE A CUTE COUPLE!!!
CINDERELLA VIDEO, the Cinderella video which is live from Rotterdam. I also love this video.
OUTRO, they talk about BOYS! Like how many b/fs they've had etc.
Before the Credits, each girl says a message to us fans! What Anna and Rosie said were really inspiring to me.
On the bonus features, it has Heart to Heart with each girl and say like in Rosies one, Faye, Anais and Anna say what they like about Rosie then Rosie sayd stuff like her most embarassing moment.
Each on the Heart to Heart's only go for like 2 minutes each.
In the end, I give this DVD 1,000,000/1,000,000! lol
I ABSOLUTLEY LOVE IT AND WATCH IT EVERYDAY!
IF YOUR A PLAY FAN, ITS A MUST HAVE, IF YOUR NOT, BUT IT ANYWAY AND YOU WILL BECOME A PLAY FAN!!!",1065657600,6,2262,4.226327944572748
