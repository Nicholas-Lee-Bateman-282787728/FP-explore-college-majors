1425147,3,B00005BJX4,"Sexual Intrigue is a very average and easily forgettable softcore flick. It isn't bad, but it isn't good either. The plot revolves around a Charlie, who has just been released from serving a year in prison. His girlfriend's ex-boyfriend gets him a job working for some rich woman, who gets him involved in some stupid plan to kidnap her stepdaughter and get money from her rich husband.

Throughout all this, we get eight sex scenes. All are boy/girl. Kira Reed (the girlfriend) participates in three of the scenes, Kim Dawson (the rich woman) also participates in three, and Zette Sullivan (the stepdaughter) participates in two. All the women are attractive do a good job in the sex scenes. But the sex scenes all range from poor to just decent. All are too short and a little too tame.

It's a shame. In the hands of a better production team, the story and cast could have been better utilized. There were several scenes in the movie that were just long, pointless shots of someone driving down a highway or sitting on a deck and staring at the beach. That all should have been cut out and the time used to lengthen the sex scenes. Also, there are three times in the movie where it appears that two people are going to get it on with each other. But then the action just stops and we go to the next scene. Stuff like that is really annoying.

Anyway, unless you are a huge fan of either Kira Reed or Kim Dawson, I don't recommend this one.",1145232000,13,1442,4.454545454545454
1425148,1,B00005BJX4,"This is your typical soft porn.  Wasn't very erotic and very predictable.  The girl on the cover is very familiar, but never appears in the movie.  That was why I bought it because I remembered the woman on the cover of the movie, but she is not even IN the movie.

Don't waste $$ on this one.  Just go rent a real X.",1140652800,3,317,3.9682539682539684
1425149,4,B00005BJX4,"This is some real value for your soft-core dollars.  I enjoy watching these genre of movies because they get the girls turned on and things can get hot and heavy afterwards if you are daring and make a good play -- and a good dinner with some nice wine.  This movie is alot better than others that I've seen like ""Story of O"" and ""Full Body Massage,"" because it's not just alot of good looking sexy people having lovescenes, but also something of a good story and decent acting.  I found myself getting lucky with this tape with more that three different girlfriends, and I was able to really put into action the excellent techniques I learned from the video ""New Sex Now.""  This movie and those new sex techniques is really a great combination!",1075766400,55,745,4.496296296296296
1425150,5,B00005BJX4,for the opening was great kira and her husband making it in the bedroom the whole out story was very good it kept you on the edge of your seat wanting to see more of all the girls involed the daughter was a cutie and so  the lady  married to the wealthy husband has a body that won't quit this is a very good  video for 18 on up but not for the  younger generation.,1075420800,14,365,3.8266666666666667
1425151,4,B00005BJX4,"This story is about Kira Reed's husband(whom is a ex-prisoner) working for a wealthy woman whom in the end ask him cook up a story saying her daughter is kipnapped and require a ransom. The plan was foiled because Kira Reed's husband told the wealthy woman's 'husband' bot to eat the medicine that his 'wife' and the 'lover' give him. He told him that this is a plot. Kira Reed and the police officer later 'stormed' the house of the wealthy woman's place of accomodation where she and the lover was caught setting up the plot. What I could remember about the scenes inside are these:-
1)sitting sex between Kira Reed and her husband(opening shot)
2)sex between the wealthy woman and Melcom.
3)Sex in swimming pool between Kira Reed and her husband.
4)Body touching between Kira Reed's husband and the Kate
5)Body touching between Kira Reed's husband and the 'daughter' of the kate's 'husband'.
2)sex between kate's 'husband' and her at bed.
3)sex between Malcom and the 'daughter' of kate's 'husband'
4)sex between kate and Kira Reed's husband
5)sitting sex between 'daughter' of kate's 'husband' and kira Reed's husband.
6)sex between Kira Reed and the police officer.
so there are six erotic scenes altogther. This is one of the good collection for those whom like LOS movies. The overall movie I can say is between good and very good.",1063670400,161,1338,4.847161572052402

1425153,4,B00005BJX4,"For fans of the soft core genre, this is an excellent contribution.  It has beautiful women, highly charged simulated sex scenes, and a decent plot to boot involving a plan to pull off a pseudo kidnapping to get a deceived father to put up a million bucks ro ransom his daughter who is in on the scheme (well played by a sexy young thing who unfortunately does not get a credit listing). In my opinion, Kim Dawson dominates the picture. This luscious blond seems to get better as she matures.  Here she plays a very nasty stepmother to a T.",990316800,104,540,4.39

1425175,3,B00005BJX4,"This DVD was OK. I found the movie to be interesting and the sex scenes weren't too bad. The only reason I purchased this DVD was because I wanted to see more of Kira Reed and her scene in the hot tub with her husband was somewhat pleasing. However, I was disappointed in Kim Dawson's performance as well as Kira Reed's appearances in her scenes. I would've liked to see her in longer sex scenes. But three stars suits this movie.",1290038400,,430,4.320987654320987

1425178,4,B00005BJX4,"With both Kira Reed and Kim Dawson performing their erotic arts, this movie could be about a quilting bee and still be worth watching.

As it is, the movie has a decently intriguing plot about kidnapping, murder, a frame up, and of course, the challenge of finding out how many of the principle characters can simulate having sex with each other.

The scene with Kim Dawson's see thru bra alone is worth the price of the movie, or the time to watch it. Its a truly instant turn on look from a male point of view.

My rating here is compared to other media of its type. Its certainly not a 4 compared to mainstream films. Compared to other soft core erotica, however, its excellent work.",1275955200,,686,4.428571428571429

1425182,4,B00005BJX4,"I had the VHS of this movie for a few years. I ordered the DVD after reading reviews and ratings online. This is one of the times when the distributors got it right. The sex scenes were longer on DVD than VHS. Kira Reed is one of the queens of the softcore genre. Her scenes are better and longer than when I saw them the first time. Especially her last one which is the last sex scene. If the other filmakers of this genre would follow suit, releasing the unrated versions instead of R-Rated ones, the sales of their movies to DVD could increase.",1236470400,5,547,4.269230769230769

The story is basic and eh.. but my favorite sex scene is the first one! Very intimate and passionate without being way to graphic. The other sex scenes were ok but not as good...

Don't expect a whole lot with the story but if your looking for intimate movie this may suite you",1500940800,,436,4.129411764705883

7937907,5,B00005BJX4,"I just saw this DVD on yesterday evening and I must say that it certainly held its own for a B-movie. While the acting was somewhat pedestrian I can't complain about the storyline, which kept me guessing right up until the end.

Then there were the females! Oh my God! They were all gorgeous, save for the character that was supposed to be the kidnapped daughter. Each female character held her own to the men in this production and the writer of the screenplay never lets up. Indeed, it's the men who act like fools. Whether it's the nosy bumpkin at the beach house or Charles Taylor, a man who spent time in prison for a crime he (Supposedly) did not commit. Taylor goes from being an ex-con looking for work to an innocent dupe who clearly never learned in prison not to touch a murder weapon.

I liked this movie and I'm glad I purchased it. I do recommend it to those who want a steamy mystery with lots of sex and even a little bit of action. But the sex is top notch. overall the production could have been better. Lack of lighting created a bit of grain in the footage that could have been avoided with adequate lighting. But I still rate this film Four and a Half Stars for plot and the gorgeous gals that starred in it.

There is a story to in this film as equally as multiple sex scenes. The posing under-age chick is annoying after seeing the entire flick once.

I liked that it showed mens body parts but still not as equally as the females... cause we have more goods- whatever.

It's not cheesy & yeah, I'm being quite bold as a female giving a review.",1350259200,,490,4.315217391304348
