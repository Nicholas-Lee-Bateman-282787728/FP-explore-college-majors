6937653,2,B00RZXWUJE,It was so bad that I couldn't stop looking at it.  It had a good premise but the filmmakers didn't bother getting their set design straight. Really she was a renowned chef?.. in a divey looking mess of a place that looked like it was never cleaned. The people who were making the food were so careless and with no gloves handling food.  Most of her lovers were gross and fat making the love scenes even more disturbing then the killing scenes. The actors were bad except for her gay male assistant chef.  It was like a bad John Waters/Divine movie.,1442361600,,548,4.405940594059406
6937654,5,B00RZXWUJE,"This movie was fun!!!!  A queer homage to the 1970s Italian Giallo and American Grindhouse genres.  I didn't know what to expect, but this film was completely entertaining and campy in just the right way.  It reminded me if John Waters' made a horror movie back in his prime.  I definitely recommend this film to people who want to take a ride through the comedic, gorey, sexy and horrific romp that is the culinary world.  Foodies will love this film too!  So many jokes about the restaurant industry.  You can clearly tell the film was written by someone who used to work in restaurants!",1441929600,,589,4.605769230769231
6937655,4,B00RZXWUJE,"It was nice seeing a movie with a cast of normal looking people and the lead was very good.

Recommended to fans of low budget Comedies. There is some violence and blood (and nudity), but not really a Horror flick.",1441843200,2,214,4.35

6937657,2,B00RZXWUJE,Just another attempt at a grindhouse horror movie.  Not that great even for an eight hundred dollar budget.,1439769600,,107,4.944444444444445
6937658,5,B00RZXWUJE,"This film brings together all that you love about Dario Argento, Herschell Gordon Lewis and John Waters. Plus, super hot sex scenes and fantastically shot. Take this home tonight.",1432080000,2,179,5.206896551724138
8696563,3,B00RZXWUJE,"This movie's simply categorized as ""horror"" when it should be ""horror comedy."" Unfortunately, none of the comedy works. It's more quirky than funny. I have a feeling the producers were aiming for a serious yet weirdly humored film (like American Psycho for example). They even have a scene where the main character/villain is discussing music in an obsessive Patrick Bateman style way. The (unintentional) humor of that scene derives from the fact that they can't play the song she's discussing (because they don't own the rights to it). This movie contains a lot of nudity, though I'm sure many viewers won't appreciate it because the women all look normal. They're not Hollywood supermodel caliber. The acting is quite abysmal. It's abundantly clear that none of the participants are professional actors. If you can tolerate amateur pursuits, you might find this movie mildly entertaining.",1531526400,,891,5.2377622377622375
8696564,1,B00RZXWUJE,"I know that this is a comedy, but that doesn't mean it has to be ridiculous. Someone should tell the blond in the opening scene that her acting. or lack thereof, is beyond stupid and disgusting.  When the murderer picks up the slice of cucumber, I knew that the movie was downhill from then on.

The names of some of the cast made me wonder if they were unemployed strippers or adult film actors.  For example, the last name Frottage, look the word up in the dictionary.",1522195200,,470,4.379310344827586

8696568,1,B00RZXWUJE,"I almost turned it off when early on the movie suddenly zoomed into a 'large' woman's butt crack. but I held back my gags of disgust, to see where the movie would go. Alas, there is waaayyy too much girl on girl action committed by class B people in this movie. Yuck!!!!  I didn't watch it for long. Its too bad that most of the free movies offered by amazon prime, stink like this one does.",1448064000,2,391,4.144736842105263

8696570,5,B00RZXWUJE,"Well at least it takes place in San Francisco. Hello 2015 the modern era. Where women want to assert themselves and be more like men and don't like penis and men want to be more effeminate and love penis. Humphrey Bogart would be so proud of our society and how far we've come. Women are learning the wonderful gift of ego and the magic of cannabalism. Power greed and conquering are traits of the 21st century female. A lot of chicks acting like alpha dudes. But I say I'm all for it. To each their own. All hail the new chief in town.

Being that I'm a guys guy the scenery in this movie is fantastic. Oh and San Francisico's not bad either. But whoever scored this movie needs to be taken out behind the wood shed and taught a lesson. The big marching band drum crescendo is hysterical and annoying. On the list of my top 10 worst/best of 2015 for sure.",1443398400,,856,4.251533742331288
