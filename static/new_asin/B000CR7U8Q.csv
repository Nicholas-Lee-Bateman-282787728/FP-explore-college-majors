Dulcimer is not his primary instrument and I think that shows.  He often plays with his thumb on the side of the sound box and under the dulcimer.  He addresses the technique, saying it was mostly for video purposes, but again, I had trouble relating to it.

That said, he knows his chords.  He demonstrates C, D, D7, Dm, E, Em, F#, G, A, Am, B, Bm...bars and variations.  I found it interesting, but I was looking for ways to pick up speed in jams...I don't see this video being helpful for that.",1260403200,3,645,4.153225806451613
