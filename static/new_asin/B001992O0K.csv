3425888,5,B001992O0K,"I was really sad when this show went off the air after only 3 seasons, it would be awesome if it were released on DVD. I have the first 2 seasons that I recorded when it was on but for some reason that I really regret now I never recorded season 3. I really loved the friendship that developed between Jack and Sue, Bobby,D, Tara, Lucy and even Myles not to mention Levi's total cuteness. I would definitely buy this series on DVD if it were released.",1215820800,72,451,4.195402298850575
3425889,5,B001992O0K,Wonderful TV show!!  The show is about a deaf woman who joins the FBI and uses her skill of lip-reading to further along investigations when traditional methods cannot be used.  This is based on a true story and I think the best part of the show is the fact that they speak about God and Country.  They show the good side of the FBI and the brave men and women that work everyday to protect our USA.  Very patriotic!,1211846400,64,416,4.227848101265823

3425951,5,B001992O0K,"I have been watching the first season on my Amazon Prime.  Six episodes in I just bought the whole set of five seasons in one.  This is such an inspiring series that I watch each episode several times.  This is definitely a must for any family who wants good, clean, no bad language or sex issues, for their families.  All ages can watch and parents have no fear your kids will be entertained and you will be too.  God is presented In Appropriate spots.
  I am teaching myself sign language via books, videos, and online lessons etc.  It is really fun trying to read and watch the ASL as well as lip reading.  I am 50% deaf in one ear and almost 40% in the other.  If my back is to you I often can't hear what is said so it is tough.  ASL is something that I know I will likely need in the future.
  Sue Thomas is an amazing and inspiring woman.  This show is wonderful.  A definite MUST buy for any family.",1495670400,,907,4.102857142857143

3425957,3,B001992O0K,"I enjoyed watching this series.  It was entertaining and held my interest.  Was also a good clean family friendly show that everyone could watch.  I was disappointed in some aspect of the show.  In my opinion the show should have been more about Sue Thomas, FBI agent who happened to be deaf and less about Sue Thomas, deaf person.  I realize the show was a golden opportunity  for the deaf but too much emphasis on deaf actors, deaf community, deaf problems etc. Also, periodicly cutting out the sound was just plain annoying.  As a hearing person no matter how many times the sound is cut off I can never fully understand what it is like to be deaf.  As an animal lover I wish Levi had a bigger role. Overall I am glad I purchased the dvds and watched the series.",1487462400,,765,4.375886524822695

The cast camaraderie, the witty dialogue, the insights given both into deaf culture and the challenges faced by FBI agents (both in case-solving and dealing w/ politics) create entertainment with depth.

3426180,5,B001992O0K,"I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting, but I was pleasantly surprised.  This show was on a Christian network, and some ""Christian"" movies are overly schmaltzy.  This isn't.  Yes, God is mentioned in it when appropriate, but no specific doctrine is shoved down anyone's throat.

The fact that it's based on a true story makes it that much more enjoyable. I really urge people to do some background reading on the real Sue Thomas, who makes a cameo appearance in the final episode.  Additionally, check out the resumes of Deanne Bray (who plays Sue Thomas) and her husband (who plays a recurring character named Troy).  They are just adorable.  I especially like the fact that this show uses ""real"" hearing-impaired people.  My husband is disabled, and for years Hollywood would put able-bodied people in wheelchairs and pass them off as handicapped, or sighted actors pretending to be blind.  This show doesn't hesitate to use incredibly good actors who happen to be hearing-impaired. And now I'm really motivated to learn sign language.

The show is definitely family-friendly, but the themes of the episodes are better suited to teens and above.",1452384000,3,1150,5.005263157894737

3426213,5,B001992O0K,"For a crime show, this series generally avoids gratuitous violence and gore, and completely steers clear of what plagues most contemporary television shows: casual sex and too much skin. It's refreshing to have a show I am not embarrassed to watch with my children. The writing is creative, the characters have depth, the dialogue is interesting, and the acting is believable. On top of that, the story inspires viewers to overcome adversity and persevere despite setbacks.

The series follows the journey of Sue Thomas, a deaf woman who can sign, lip read and speak, as she moves to Washington DC to join the FBI.  Her amazing capabilities in lip reading are noticed by Special Agent Jack Hudson, who gets her immediately transferred from the fingerprinting department to his elite surveillance team.  Overcoming barriers and some prejudices, you see her blossom into a key and appreciated member of the team.  Although the plot lines are great, it was the relationships between the different characters that I enjoyed the most, especially her great friendship with best friend/housemate Lucy and the 'will they - won't they' obvious attraction between Jack and Sue.  Her 'hearing dog' Levi is also adorable! Overall, a very enjoyable series!!",1426723200,3,1045,5.011560693641618

Consequently I will probably catch another episode or two, but that's doubtful.

3426452,5,B001992O0K,"These are well-made dramas that feature a functionally deaf FBI agent who had turned lip-reading into an asset in crime investigation. While that's her unique skill, she is a unique individual, among other unique individuals which provided ample story lines and interaction in crime and resolution. Don't expect the FBI of ""Criminal Minds"" which is the exploitation of badness. This in contrast is the way law enforcement dramas started out, taking the high road, the good guys win.  I recommend you not burn through this series quickly but that you sprinkle it in strategically in place of dark products like Black List, Criminal Minds, Breaking Bad, or whatever HBO is coming up with next. Those are not healthy family fare in my opinion. You can't un-see those shows, so the best thing is to not see them at all. This program series gives you a choice and if you encourage this type of fare by buying it other producers will follow and make other ""family"" safe products. After you've seen the series or just an episode, pass it on through the family, a static shelf library does no further good. Instead of bragging rights to shelving it in your home library convert your ownership to bragging rights that you're sharing it and you've even lost track of where it is now. Pass it along with a note that you don't want anybody to store it, that they should enjoy and then pass it on instead.",1412899200,4,1392,4.681632653061224

Because I wanted to see the rest of the episodes, I splurged on the entire set, and I'm so glad I did.  I have really enjoyed this series.  The acting is good, the stories and relationships are touching and realistic, and the writers manage to keep the really creepy stuff the FBI agents deal with from being graphic and gory. Not to mention that I'm an extreme dog-lover and using Levi the service dog as one of the regular ""characters"" in each script makes the episodes that much more fun for me!  I also appreciate the messages these shows deliver about respect and consideration for others.  The humor is clean and genuine.",1412640000,,732,4.432835820895522

The episodes dealt with the problems of the FBI and solved these problems with good moral values, no foul language, included God's teachings, and did not feel they had to show blood and guts of every situation.  The talented Deanne Bray that plays Sue Thomas and is deaf in real life, was outstanding in this series...a true role model for young and old.  I only wish the series had been longer.

However I (and they) find the story line interesting, both from the FBI cases, the characters' interactions, and many touching / heartfelt segments.  The actress who plays Sue is actually deaf, so the signing, speech, and issues are somewhat true to life.  Every so often, the TV sound is cut, and we experience what it means to be deaf in a hearing world.  The tables are sometimes reversed and we see also what it means to be hearing in a deaf world.  I'm amazed at the warmth and humanity that comes across in every episode.

The seven main characters in the series work together very well and they obviously like each other even though their personalities are so varied.
  The writers of this series are clever, witty, and know how to develop tension without overdoing it.  The scenes that could be bloody and gross, are handled discretely - not like so many other programs on TV.
  The Christian values of Sue Thomas permeate the whole series but not in an offensive way nor is it sappy or predictable.",1394582400,2,649,4.640350877192983

Great story lines for law enforcement content without the foul language, lewd content or gore.  If you have a heart you'll usually feel  a tug on those 'ol heart strings at the end of an episode.

I was concerned about purchasing something produced by a company I had never heard of.  The price is a little high considering the number of episodes, but it certainly is quality TV.  Being able to purchase this series on DVD saved me the time it would've taken to convert my VHS tapes to DVD, plus the picture is better since I had some trouble getting PAX; I actually got cable so I would be able to see this show.  This series is a must buy for anyone who loved the series or who enjoys a good program with decent people you can actually like.

3426709,5,B001992O0K,"I have been involved in entertainment for 42 years, and have never observed the dynamics of a show quite like this. The producers took a great chance on the possibilities of longevity for the series, which I believe cost them the cancelation in the end. But what remains, is substantial, inspiring story of a deaf woman who finds it in herself to be a giver instead of a taker, a group of law enforcing friends who can turn on the heart instead of the gun, and a series of immensely engaging heartwarming cases you would never see on a ""regular show"". Time will only tell, but I think that in Sue Thomas FBeye you have a series that can stand the test of time when it comes to quality and depth, something you'd be hard pressed to find today in the network. I salute the producers and writers of such a courageous enterprise. TV is the much better for it!

Based on a true story, this series is one of the best I have ever seen and is on my top-ten favorites list of all time.  Sue Thomas F.B. Eye  has everything that makes a movie good - a touch of romance, drama, humor, action, and adventure. What's more, the writers and producers managed to pull off this feat without the use of the distasteful Hollywood variety of violence, crass humor, foul language, and sexuality.

Sue Thomas F.B. Eye is a wholesome show, but it's far from dull. Each episode includes the latest case to solve by Sue's F.B.I. team, which includes:

Sue, a talented lip reader who helps solve many cases, but who struggles with being accepted because of her disability;

Jack, the lead investigator (with a dash of romance between he and Sue);

Lucy, Sue's best friend and roommate, and the administrative assistant for Sue's F.B.I. team;

Bobby, the Australian agent with a flair for fighting for the underdog;

Tara, who can figure out just about anything on the computer and is the technology guru of the group;

Demetrius, the serious, yet kind, agent who learns a lesson the hard way about how his workaholic tendencies affect his family; and

Miles, the annoying know-it-all who has it out for Sue in the beginning.

Some of the episodes include some scary parts that may be inappropriate for those under 10 only because of the theme. There is nothing objectionable in any of the episodes and Sue Thomas F.B.Eye is a perfect series for the entire family. I highly recommend purchasing the entire set. As of this review, there are five seasons, but I'm hoping they'll make more soon!

3426840,4,B001992O0K,"This is a highly unusual series, based on the true story of real life FBI agent Sue Thomas. The still-living Thomas, who was deaf from a very young age, was hired by the FBI when she was in her early 20s because of her remarkable ability to read lips and transcribe the dialogue on visual surveillance equipment that lacked sound. Thomas's ability to read lips accurately made her quite an asset to the agency as she helped solve cases. This series is a fictionalized account of a few years that she spent with the FBI.

Where to start? First, the good. Deanne Bray--in real life, almost completely deaf herself--is a phenomenal actress. Highly expressive and luminous, she comes across as real, and a nice person to boot. One can't help but fall in love with her as she not only uses her lip-reading ability, but also connects to others--from co-workers to the criminals--on a deeply truthful, direct, heartfelt level. If you see Bray speak in real life (check the 'net), you can see tremendous depth shining forth.

Unlike most other crime programs, this series spares us the excessive gory, bloody violence in scenes that would make one want to avert their eyes. However, Sue Thomas, F.B.Eye is still high in tension. The swat and capture scenes are filmed jerkily with a hand-held camera. And the few times that Sue herself is kidnapped are unnerving. Particularly poignant is the time that Sue is blindfolded and begs, ""Please, take off the blindfold, my eyes are everything to me!"" Yes, her eyes ARE everything to her. And you, the viewer, are right there in her world as you realize how hard this deaf woman must work to compensate for the loss of one of her senses.

Remarkably, Bray's speech is practically crystal clear. Aside from the fact that she needs to see you in order to know what you're saying, the only hint that she's deaf is what sounds somewhat like a very slight lisp. But Bray's voice is wonderful in its inflections, tone and timbre. Were the theme of living as a deaf person not such an integral part of the show, one could easily forget that for the most part Bray can't hear. (She has very slight hearing in one ear, but she's legally deaf.)

Aside from who the character of Sue Thomas is portrayed to be, one of the most wonderful things that this series offers to hearing viewers is a sense of what it means to be deaf. Sue's roommate and co-workers learn to sign in American Sign Language (ASL), and there are plenty of deaf, signing actors with a lot to say. One striking thing about ASL is its rich visual/metaphorical content. People who sign HAVE to be expressive in order to make themselves understood. This all makes for very interesting, absorbing theater. But being deaf is never a forced issue; it's organic to the plot, the deaf actors are organic to the plot, and learning what it means to live in a silent world is illuminating for me, a hearing viewer. When some of the characters sign, captions appear on the screen so people unversed in ASL know what they are saying. And, of course, there are subtitles so that the hearing impaired can view the show too.

It's easy to fall in love with this character. So why only 4 stars? There are some really annoying flaws that detract from the message and from the plot. First, in nearly every episode the Thomas character talks about God--how God has interceded, how she has faith, how all things work according to a grand plan. This reflects the religiosity of the real Sue Thomas. That's fine--but in any good art, the cardinal rule is ""Show, don't tell."" We, the audience, end up being preached to, and after a while it gets very tiresome. If the amount of time devoted to discussing God could have been reduced to one-quarter or one-fifth of what it is, and referenced more subtly, it would not have interfered. Also a bit too Disney-esque and saccharin is the mention of friends, ad nauseum. SHOW, DON'T TELL: actions speak louder than words. The entire cast (both regular and supporting actors) does such a fine job of acting, there's plenty of showing. Unfortunately, it seems as though the writers wanted to make sure that the audience ""got"" the values of love, integrity, family and honesty; so too often the scripts hammer these things at us instead of allowing the acting to carry the message.

Another huge turn-off was the presumably good-natured ribbing of one character in particular, FBI agent Myles. He's long-winded and somewhat arrogant, but it became tiresome after a while to hear so much badgering from the co-workers who were actually mean to him, quite unnecessarily. At one point, Lucy pretends that she knows some of Myles's secrets (she doesn't), so she blackmails him into doing her bidding for an unspecified period of time. It's actually shocking to hear her gloat, ""It's great to have a man-servant""--and this reverse sexism from an African-American woman, no less! MAN-SERVANT? True, Myles had treated Lucy badly during an early episode, but why are we doing tit for tat, especially when the message of love and forgiveness suffuses the series? If a criminal can be forgiven, why not a co-worker? Where is the ""God"" in that? Since this series is so uplifting in so many ways otherwise, this noticeably dragged it down.

My third gripe relates to the unresolved ending between Sue and fellow FBI agent Jack, who clearly is in love with Sue. Office rules forbid co-workers within the same division from dating, so there is a very strong bond between Jack and Sue that remains platonic and provides some tension throughout. Sue clearly loves Jack too, but during the last episode she allows him to (obliquely) tell her his feelings without revealing how she feels herself. This seemed way out of character, since in every other area Sue is up front. Her refusal to reveal her vulnerability was hugely anti-climactic and didn't sit well. Can you say ""Denial""?

To conclude, the biggest flaw is the writing. The series deserves better and the characters deserve better. Keep an eye out for Rick Peters, with his charming Australian accent; and Tara Samuel, with a unique voice, huge eyes and pixie-ish features that remind one of a gentle Meg Ryan. Marc Gomes gives a subtle but good performance, and Troy Kotsur, Deanne Bray's real-life husband, is fantastically expressive as a reformed deaf criminal.

This series offers a new meaning to achievement in the face of difficult odds; to being all you can be, even if you're different; and a vastly increased understanding of what it means to be deaf in a hearing world. My household had to purchase these DVDs because they are not available for rental. I'm real glad I bought these DVDs, but I don't know if I could watch them again.

Recently, after acquiring another old TV series on DVD I decided to see if this show had ever been published.

I first found a shady place selling a set that turned out to be very poor quality off air recordings complete with bad reception and commercial interruptions with partial commercials on DVD-Rs.

My older two children used to watch this with me; my daughter was six and my son was four (my younger daughter was still a baby); they learned a lot about physical challenges and how people can easily overcome them to excel in life.  It also taught them about patience and tolerance when dealing with people who have physical or mental challenges.

I loved how the show seamlessly blended drama, action and comedy.  This was one show to which I looked forward every single week.  It's a shame that it only lasted three seasons; with the right writing team, it could easily have gone twice that long.

The series contains a lot of stuff about doing the right thing and listening to your heart and how hard it sometimes can be to really do just that.
Sue is the main caracter, she plays the deaf woman from a small town that becomes an FBI-agent because of good luck, stubborness and skill. She can't hear anything so she reads peoples lips, which is a very useful skill for the FBI.She also has a ""hearing"" dog that helps her with stuff so she can live a normal life.

We have always hoped it would come back.  Great actors playing characters that were so enjoyable, I never had to be concerned letting them into my living room for entertainment.  It is a rare quality these days to watch a show that is extremely entertaining and not offensive.

I've always loved action shows so the FBI part intrigued me.  The unique humor had me roaring many times.  The friendships and trust built within the team unit was more than a pleasure to watch, as well as some romance and other characters with stories to tell.  For me it had it all.  But what really shocks me is that there has never been before or after, a show that so completely brings together the worlds of the hearing and the deaf.  The misunderstandings, the hurt, the possibilities of bridging the gap.  I learned more on that show about compassion than any other.  As an animal lover, Levi the wonder dog absolutely rocks as Sue's hearing dog.  He is entertaining and adorable.

I have never stated this before, but I can't help but to wonder if possibly the fact that Sue has Christian values, actually thanks God when the guys don't get blown up, that people that are so anti Christian and anti conservative values are trying to keep this show off the airwaves.  It just makes no sense to me.  I know people who would love to watch a great wholesome TV show like this.  We certainly have enough offensive shows. Is it not allowed to have TV with conservative values anymore?  Maybe some don't think it is politically correct? God help America if we've lost freedom of opinion on the airwaves.  Certainly most of the media makes that obvious. Think of all the viewers they are losing.

Animal Planets efforts to promote SueThomas FBEye fell far short to me.  How will viewers know about the show if they don't advertise.  I don't believe for one minute that 2 weeks was enough time to get the word out that our favorite show was back on a channel that maybe some viewers don't watch.

I have to say even on Amazon, I was disappointed to type in Sue Thomas F.B.Eye and not be directed immediately to the list of new DVD's coming out.  Maybe there isn't a date yet, but at least if people are made aware of it becoming available, they will be putting it on their list to buy.

3426942,5,B001992O0K,"""Sue Thomas: F.B.Eye"" is a heart-warming series, based on a true story that your entire family will appreciate. This critically-acclaimed series includes a long list of very talented actors and actresses, and stars Deanne Bray in the title role of Sue Thomas.

What first attracted me to this program was its true-to-life concepts and its startling realism. This is also a great show for anyone who enjoys animals because a very cute and bright Golden Retriever is prominently featured in every ep. Perhaps it's no coincidence that the series is in current rotation on Animal Planet (Mondays @ 9PM).

Although the series was very successful, it was canceled in 2005. However, viewers like myself have never forgotten about ""Sue Thomas: F.B.Eye"" because rarely has there been another series as beautifully written with such an important message; that it doesn't matter what life gives us, we can all become whatever we choose, if we work hard at it and follow our heart!

Deanne Bray is an exceptional actress because she lights up every scene with her charm and chemistry. I also especially enjoyed Enuka Okuma, playing Lucy, Sue's co-worker and close friend. Enuka is also a very successful and talented actress in her own right, longtime fans who grew up watching her on TV remember her best from the series ""Fifteen"".

One of my favorite eps was the second-half of the pilot because it was so fast-moving and refreshing in its overall message. Although it was sad to see, it was also so cute seeing Levi laying down in the hospital bed.
