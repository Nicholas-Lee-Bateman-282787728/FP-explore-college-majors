2983588,5,B000WMA6R8,"Being an old hippie (who missed being drafted by 3 numbers), I thought this film was remarkable. I can just imagine how awful it was for those who were shot down and captured. This film may not show all of the horrible things which occurred to some POWs but it sure gives one the idea of how bad it was.

I never wanted to see us in Vietnam, but that doesn't mean I didn't respect the soldiers who were there. I wanted all of them to come home safely. I cried for those I knew who were severely injured or died.

This film is one of the most striking accounts I've ever seen about the war. I've heard horror stories from people I've known over the years who have talked about their tour(s) and this film shows how it must have been for those who had to endure prisons in the jungle. I'm not sure many POWs ever escaped from those camps, but Dieter certainly did.

As an aside, I just finished reading an account of the prisoners who were with Dieter in the prison camp. The real story is quite different than the one told in this film. Gene was not the deranged one, and the rest of the prisoners who escaped had already devised a plan to someday escape when Dieter arrived. However, this film is still quite a story of survival. In reality, Dieter died of ALS in 2001 after years as a TWA pilot.",1504224000,,1296,4.217741935483871

2983595,3,B000WMA6R8,"Never liked Christian Bale but after seeing this movie, well I still don't like him. Not a great movie but worth a watch, I wouldnt call him a hero, just a survivor, he never did anything heroic. Sappy ending, but makes you feel good.",1502409600,,234,4.340909090909091

2983609,5,B000WMA6R8,"Screw the negative comments on here ! Our People that were captured went through Hell, and so did all those who fought,those weblog were killed, and survived Vietnam. They did not receive the "" welcome home "" like those in present wars . It was really too late when they all finally received the "" welcome home "", it's more like a compensation award.",1501027200,,350,4.484375
2983610,4,B000WMA6R8,"Fairly good movie.  It can be a little slow at times, very quiet a lot of the time, mixed with loud gunfire.  I highly suggest subtitles.  Christian Bale is a fighter pilot who crashes on his first mission and is captured by the Vietcong.  He leads the other, already interned POWs on a mission to escape the camp.  After escaping, there are some elements the movie doesn't explain well, IE: where the other men went and why only 2 remained together. It explains the 3rd man, but not the rest leaving.  This film is based on a true story and I think it did well telling that story.  Good film.",1500595200,,593,4.336363636363636

2983659,1,B000WMA6R8,"If you have read the book ""Hero Found""  then this is just your typical Vietnam POW escape movie.
 I highly recommend the audiobook version of the said book. It is an amazing story  something this movie is said to be based on. However it leaves out the most critical parts and gets the rest very wrong.  The premise is only slightly similar to the book -the very things that make the book so amazing, beautiful and exciting are not to be found in the movie. Bale  is not effective in the lead role. He lacks the charisma and spirit of the person this movie is based on.  If you don't want to read the book then save yourself some time and just watch Missing In Action.",1474156800,,667,4.253968253968254

2983705,3,B000WMA6R8,"Christian Bale makes friends and enemies alike in a sparsely-populated den of POWs at the onset of the Vietnam war. Undergoing another major transformation for the role, Bale lost a ton of weight to sell his emaciation, but as he's decked out in a big, baggy flight suit for the duration it's often difficult to see his worsening condition. There's a strange mood that lingers around the fringes of this one, something to take us out of the moment. Maybe it's Bale's weirdly sunny disposition: even when he's being drug at gunpoint through the streets of a rough jungle village, he's smiling politely at the dumbstruck townsfolk. It could be the simple, businesslike way the prisoners plot and execute their escape, which seems a bit too easy. Even the relationships between the captives, carried out via hushed tones and late-night chats amidst shackles, have a floaty, dreamlike quality about them that doesn't fit the seemingly-horrible situation. As a picture it lacks conviction, that one moment for the audience to stand up and cheer, or even feel a sense of genuine tension about the cast's impending doom. I often felt removed from the action, as if I were reflecting upon it after the fact and glossing over the more grisly everyday challenges.",1466467200,,1253,4.943127962085308

2983752,5,B000WMA6R8,"Christian Bale was amazing in this film as a shot down American pilot POW in The Vietnam War. The POW camp scenes were very realistic and at times, a little tough to take but that's what it was like for POWs. It reminds me of what Senator John McCain and others like him went through as POWs. The sets and scene locations for this film were just as real and of high cinematic value as the locations for other Vietnam genre films such as Apocalpyse Now and the Deer Hunter. The cast was great who played alongside Bale as fellow POWs as well as the small cadre of Vietcong captors. This was one of the better films about the Vietnam conflict and the American soldiers who served and sacrificed there for our country. It is a must see!!",1465084800,,734,4.326086956521739

2983801,3,B000WMA6R8,"Here is an example of the gross incompetence of Amazon's streaming movie service. I got an email from Amazon recommending Rescue Dawn starring Zach Grenier and I thought, hey that's interesting, I didn't know Grenier, who played David Lee on The Good Wife, starred in a Vietnam movie! So I clicked and clicked but couldn't find it, and then Searched and had to type the entire word Rescue plus a space before this picture showed up. And what did the listing say? This film, which I had seen twice, is written and directed by Werner Herzog and stars Christian Bale. Grenier has a very minor part. This is a very weak Herzog film. In fact I find it annoying primarily due to one of the characters. Bale doesn't have much to do and he doesn't do it very well.",1464652800,,756,4.446043165467626

2984115,4,B000WMA6R8,"I enjoyed this movie. Interesting spin on Vietnam movies, as it takes place very early in the war, before the massive American buildup. Loosely based on a true story, it is about an American Navy pilot who gets shot down over Laos and is captured. Without going into details and spoilers let me say Christian Bale turns in a very good performance. The movie is from 2007, so he had not peaked yet in his acting abilities, but nonetheless does well. The supporting cast is also very good. Filmed entirely on location in Thailand, the movies gives a very good depiction of what a Southeast Asian jungle is really like. Some scenes will be noted by the squeamish. For those interested in history/war movies, I'd recommend this.",1462752000,,724,4.708661417322834

The way they make the prisoners out to be a bit crazy and went way overboard on how they acted as captives is appalling. I could not finish watching this movie. It angered me to watch. The director should be captured and tortured for his horrible take on what these men went through. Don't waste your money and please don't allow this kind director believe he can take such a horrific part of someone's life and s*** on its memory. The family and friends of the men involved in this are horrified by how it has been portrayed.

2984470,3,B000WMA6R8,"Enjoyed what i could. Maybe there should be more detail about how they survived in the jungle. Being familiar with wilderness survival there is various strategies for finding and managing food and hunger. I found it unbelievable to find their way at night. it may work in open country but  it must be too dark to move in the jungle at night. His tactical way of moving under cover looked real. Concealment is a very important factor in escape and evasion. Doing things like standing on a rock and setting the hut on fire to draw attention of aircraft may seem like a good thing to do but it will also draw the enemy that is hunting you. some of the guards seemed lax and not the characteristic of a good soldier especially under the conditions they were under. From what i heard the Viet Cong were very tough warriors. i cannot understand how they could leave their weapons unattended while guarding prisoners One of the first lessons learned in Army Basic.

Whispering may be realistic while in confinement but it makes it hard to hear and understand what is being said. this seems to be a major problem with Amazon movies and i will continue to rate good movies low until it has been fixed if it can.

I never was eligible for Viet Nam and the draft ended as soon as i graduated from high school. I never really did see a real war (wished i had but praise God i never did). I can still watch war movies without having relapses. i have no memories to manage.

Like most stories there always is some inaccuracy and there needs to be some drama to make it interesting.",1461024000,,1567,4.411764705882353

2984561,4,B000WMA6R8,Good flick based on real events.,1446854400,,32,4.5
2984562,4,B000WMA6R8,"Released in late 2006-2007, ""Rescue Dawn"" is based on the true story of German-American Dieter Dengler (Christian Bale) who was shot down in February, 1966, during a Vietnam bombing mission. He was held in a Laotian prison camp with several other prisoners, including Duane Martin and Gene DeBruin (Steve Zahn and Jeremy Davies), before attempting to escape the following Summer.

Directed by the famous German auteur, Werner Herzog, known for cult hits like 1972s Aguirre, the Wrath of God and 1982s Fitzcarraldo, Rescue Dawn has a somewhat artsy air compared to more conventional Vietnam War flicks, like 1986 Platoon and 1989s Casualties of War, which isn't to say its a better viewing experience than ""Platoon,"" but it's about as good as the other one. In any case, it lacked the mega-budget of those blockbusters. It was shot in the jungles of Thailand in 44 days and things got ugly when the producer couldn't pay the crew for lack of funds.

Ill be honest with you, during the first hour I was taken aback by what struck me as bad acting on Bales part, like his smiling and comedic words at the absolute wrong time. It just didn't ring true, but then I saw that it was intentional, particularly after watching the Making Of featurettes on the DVD, which show that Dieter was a weirdly obsessed guy who absolutely refused to give up. It was his nave-yet-unshakable optimism and iron-will that got him out of his jungle hell. The director would know more about the real Dengler since he made a documentary of his POW travails in 1997, Little Dieter Needs to Fly. After watching clips from that film you'll realize that Bales performance isn't far from the truth. Dieter always had this perpetual smile and weird sense of humor that either annoyed people or endeared them. So the performance is SUPPOSED to be eccentric. Besides, there's more than a hint of black comedy in the movie because the situation for American POWs was nigh surrealistically absurd.

The movie has been severely criticized by members of the families of Gene DeBruin and Phisit Intharathat, the latter being the only other survivor of the group, a Thai. Herzog acknowledged that DeBruin acted heroically during his imprisonment, refusing to leave while some sick prisoners remained, but claimed to be unaware of this until after the film had been completed. He said that this angle wouldve probably been included in the story had he learned it earlier. However, the DeBruin family said that Herzog was not interested in speaking with them prior to the film being completed. For me personally, I didn't think Debruin was portrayed THAT badly. The way hes depicted is simply the result of his being incarcerated in a primitive jungle prison for two years BEFORE Dengler arrived. The latter was only there for five months before attempting to escape.

A critic referred to Rescue Dawn as One Flew Over the Bamboo Hut on the grounds that its essentially a war version of 1975s ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."" Like that movie, Rescue Dawn depicts a group of average men who were a little off BEFORE undergoing involuntary imprisonment. While Dieter (Bale) refuses to be locked down and is constantly trying to keep his mental skills sharp through humor and plotting, some of the other POWs are increasingly becoming lost in their own minds, which then sets up its own impenetrable walls. The fact that Rescue Dawn is based on a true story where the ending is known doesn't prevent it from being a quality jungle survival drama. Please take note because this isn't a war action film, although theres some of that; its a survival drama. In any case, unlike One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest where the protagonist flew over the cuckoo's nest and disappeared forever, this movie offers hope. One flew over the bamboo hut, fell in for a while, but makes it out!

The film runs 120 minutes.

It's the only film I've seen where it deals with a pilot being shot down while flying a mission in the Vietnam conflict, being captured and put in a POW camp and then escaping from the camp.  I imagine there have been other similar movies made but I haven't seen them.  It was a pretty small camp with only 6 prisoners and it made me wonder just how many other small camps existed like this in Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos for captured Americans.",1430352000,,605,4.2894736842105265

2984980,4,B000WMA6R8,"Dieter Dengler's amazing story of escape from a brutal Laos prison camp.  Filmed on location in Thailand.  In movie fiction, Rambo would have single-handedly fashioned crossbow-launched RPG's, destroyed the entire prison and the Pathet Lao force, and led all his fellow prisoners to safetly.

Dengler doesn't do any of that (though he does, satisifyingly manage to mow down the prison guards with their own weapons.  This is, after all,  a TRUE story, and a remarkable one.  Without Dengler's dogged determination to survive, he and his fellow prisoners would all have disappeared off the earth.

2984988,3,B000WMA6R8,"A movie based on actual events....  but the script was weak and choppy, making it difficult for me to establish a time frame/timeline as the movie ran its course.  This may have been a result of a less-than clear timeline in the actual veteran's memory and the script did little to fill it in.  This was not a movie that kept me engaged through action or terrific lead acting, although the two main supporting actors fleshed their characters out quite well.  I remained engaged because the trailer intrigued me when it mentioned that the jungle proved more dangerous than being held in a POW camp but the trailer over-promised and under-delivered.

2985265,5,B000WMA6R8,"Director Werner Herzog's RESCUE DAWN is an incredible tale of survival and the will to live. Christian Bale's performance as German-born Dieter Dengler is totally enigmatic, mesmerizing and captivating. Dengler is a Navy pilot during the Vietnam War. On a classified mission he is down over Laos and captured. Bale's performance is so aloof and curious, but is always singularly focused on escape. He may escape confinement by his captors, but the green dense jungle proves to be even more confining than can be imagined. Christian Bale's performance remains focused, but his determination is challenged time and time again. This is an interesting film based on true events. It holds your interest throughout. I love the finale even though it was criticized, but in reality its almost surrealistic and humorous feel, puts the film's entire narrative in perspective and makes it so thought provoking.",1424390400,,899,5.25

This could have been a good movie as far as storyline, but its apparent low budget and relative lack of special effects seriously limited its ability to capture the viewer.

2985297,5,B000WMA6R8,"Rescue Dawn is not just a movie.  This is a living chance to see what many of our veterans faced during the Vietnam War.

Christian Bale plays Dieter Dengler an Air Force pilot shoot down and captured in Loas during the very early stages of the American involvement in Vietnam.  Bale is awesome as the captured airman.  He shows pride, courage and a source spirit that had been missing in the hellhole of a prison camp where they were incarcerated.

Rescue Dawn is a story of hope and desperation, friendship and loss.  Bale and company do justice to what was a horrible thing.

Jeremy Davies is absolutely superb as Gene, the starving inmate with hope.  Steve Zahn plays Duane, an inmate on the brink of breaking down and losing all his marbles.",1421539200,,746,4.598484848484849

2985547,4,B000WMA6R8,"Christian Bale leads a team of co-stars who turned in, for this particular veteran, a very realistic (both historically and visually) rendition of combat, survival, escape, resistance, and evasion.
Bale plays the lead role as US Navy Lieutenant Dieter Dengler. Dengler was a pilot who flew clandestine combat bombing missions against Communist forces in Laos during the years preceding major combat operations in Vietnam.  In his first combat mission, Dengler's plane sustains anti-aircraft damage resulting in a crash landing.  He evades capture for a few days, but is eventually caught and turned over to the VC who ultimately transfer him to a POW camp in Laos.
While in the camp he meets fellow POWs and begins to develop a plan to escape.
This review does not intend to provide a full recap of the film; rather, it will serve to inform the potential viewer that this author found the movie entertaining, evocative, humorous, and most importantly (for me) a realistic depiction of some of the ways humans respond to whatever life throws at them.",1419292800,,1049,5.022988505747127

Thought the movie was good, but after watching the documentry 'Little Dieter Needs to Fly' we were disappointed that  the movie did not depict many situations that Dengler lived through and what a man can endure when captive in a hostal enviroment. This could be due to the PG-13 rating. It was just another Hollywood movie. A couple scenes held your attention but otherwise not edge of your seat.

2986423,4,B000WMA6R8,"Excellent movie about the 1966 escape from Laos by downed US airman Dieter Dengler (played by Christian Bale).  ""Rescue Dawn"" is a gritty examination of the role will, ingenuity and patience plays in the decision to escape from a group of malevolent captors.  The performances are uniformly solid, led by Jeremy Davies and Steve Zahn, with Christian Bale playing a somewhat unsympathetic lead. Particularly notable was the brotherly, tethered relationship between Bale and Zahn. IT was both touching and real and gave the film much of its emotional underpinning.  The location shooting in Thailand was spectacular and gave you a sense of actually being present in the stifling and oppressive jungle conditions.

The climactic 15 minutes were disappointing in that a movie so full of nuance and subtlety was quickly brought to an exaggerated and overblown conclusion.  Maybe it truly happened that way, but even a movie based on real life events deviates somewhat.

Regardless, a very uplifting story of the courage to overcome terrific odds.",1415750400,,1041,5.240963855421687

It was carefully representative of the facts, but unlike most Hollywood movies, he did not glamorize or hype up the events.  In that it was believable.  The central figure was clearly a leader, and made it home because of his perseverance, and unlike the other prisoners, he only was in forced imprisonment for months, rather than years.

The story ramps up quickly with Christian Bale, as real life Dieter Dengler, crash lands in Laos and is captured by what appear to be the NVA and a ragtag band of local villagers with weapons. What follows is his transport to a small POW camp with only six other prisoners who had been there one and a half years, minimum.

The story tells more than the hardships of the camp, the ruthlessness of some of the guards, and digs into the psychological erosion that happens to people enduring those conditions. One of the characters actually looked eerily like a young Charles Manson but I'm not sure whether that was intentional. Regardless, for me, it underscored the psychological drama being played out.

In sum, this is a very fine, but not great, film that tells a story we've seen before, think Great Escape with a lot fewer players and a lot more jungle, from a slightly different angle.

2986732,4,B000WMA6R8,"This is difficult to review because the movie itself is so depressing and discouraging to me as a decorated soldier myself and the film points out clearly the courage and strength of some of our soldiers. What it also shows is that most of this country today couldn't care less about what we did but instead they just TAKE the good from our sacrifices and do NOTHING for anyone else but themselves and don't give a soldier one second of thought much less be grateful to them.
The acting in this film is beyond just good.....it could get nominations for awards it's so powerful but I love acting as much as the film usually so I pay attention to that and can't watch many of the films put out today by some stars because they can't act at all. I won't mention Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt here either but Christian Bail just delivers one great performance here.
To add to the films credits it's also based on a true story so that just makes this film unbelievable to me.
NOT FOR KIDS or the sensitive at all and it did me no good either except for seeing what good direction and great acting is like once more. It's a 5-star movie I took one away from because it is so depressing and down but other than that, it's one great incite into some of our soldiers lives and what they gave.",1413936000,,1277,4.2809917355371905

The last two films with Christian Bale I like are this movie and ""The Prestige"".  I thought ""American Hustle"" was very underwhelming.  I couldn't make it through the whole movie.

The movie is worth at least 4 stars. The hero, the POWs are worth all 5 stars.
Even so the movie does not try too hard to portray the genuine sadism the POWS usually had to endure it seemed to me. There is a bit of it. Maybe it has become politically incorrect to dwell on that, I dunno.

2986944,3,B000WMA6R8,"Christian Bale makes friends and enemies alike in a sparsely-populated den of POWs at the onset of the Vietnam war. Undergoing another major transformation for the role, Bale lost a ton of weight to sell his emaciation, but as he's decked out in a big, baggy flight suit for the duration it's often difficult to see his worsening condition. There's a strange mood that lingers around the fringes of this one, something to take us out of the moment. Maybe it's Bale's weirdly sunny disposition: even when he's being drug at gunpoint through the streets of a rough jungle village, he's smiling politely at the dumbstruck townsfolk. It could be the simple, businesslike way the prisoners plot and execute their escape, which seems a bit too easy. Even the relationships between the captives, carried out via hushed tones and late-night chats amidst shackles, have a floaty, dreamlike quality about them that doesn't fit the seemingly-horrible situation. As a picture it lacks conviction, that one moment for the audience to stand up and cheer, or even feel a sense of genuine tension about the cast's impending doom. I often felt removed from the action, as if I were reflecting upon it after the fact and glossing over the more grisly everyday challenges. It's nicely shot, with a genuine appreciation for the area's unique terrain and the helpless fury of its residents at a looming US intervention, but the story itself never moved me like I felt it should.",1405296000,,1457,4.902834008097166

I'll admit that I know more about POW and prisoner conditions that I wish, but Herzog nails it.  The entire film feels authentic.  It maintains interest, it doesn't sugar-coat, it doesn't preach.

We talked a long time and he gave me a signed copy of his book ""Escape from Laos"". I was so impressed by his fortitude and  desire to escape. I was so impressed by the movie which unfortunately Dieter did not live long enough to see. I think he would have been impressed with Christian Bale and other actors.

First he doesn't bail out of his plane, then climbs on a high rock in enemy territory and starts flashing a mirror when no search planes are around. DUMB!! The only glimpses of true humanity come from a few if the other captives. The scenes of eye rolling nonsense are too numerous to mention. Some lovely scenery though.

2986956,4,B000WMA6R8,"This is not your typical blood and guts story and as I researched later about this event, there are some separations from the truth. Scenes of extreme torture are left out of this movies - only references are made to that. This movie concentrates on character development and really, the best part about this movie is the acting done by all the characters. I had some issues with moving through the bushes and NOT using the machete to get through. Why have it if you won't use it? Then Bale, the lead character, catches a snake and proceeds to eat it. Yet, again, having a machete, why not take off the head first? Just small details like that bother me a bit.

What I did watch twice was from the point where the spotter plane sees him and comes back around for another look and then the helicopters come in to get him! At last!! All I could think of was how I would have felt by then!! I really loved the ending. I won't say more on that part.

The plot was a bit off, along with those nagging little details that bothered me so that's why I gave it four stars. Acting is great by everybody involved - Bale always gets really into his characters. So did the other prisoners too.

A piece of history of that war kept silent for some time, mainly because we weren't supposed to be there in Laos. The sad part is wondering who got left behind and is anyone still there?",1390003200,,1368,4.274131274131274
2986957,4,B000WMA6R8,Rescue Dawn is the movie version of the Dieter Dengler story. The movie pretty much follows the Dieter Dengler documentary. Christian Bales brings Dieter Dengler to life throughout the film. To me the best part of the movie portrays the escape plotting with five or more prisoners and daily life as a prisoner being moved from location and living in the Lao POW camp. The movie's end give the viewer a good feeling especially with the rescue and celebration in the carrier hanger bay.

The men were not as they were depicted in the film. Other than that it was a tense and exciting film, but just keep an open mind when watching and know that Dieter was not the only hero in the movie.

2986962,3,B000WMA6R8,"Based on a true story, I found it to be a depressing, two dimensional piece of film making. A surprise given the director is Werner Herzog. The Vietnamese or Laotians were on the whole portrayed as vicious killers ""anti Yankee""-for no good cause, despite the opening sequence of the American strafing of Laotian countryside with huts blown apart in moody pyrotechnics. And the dialogue noting the Americans had no justifiable reason to be in Laos attacking Laotians. Dieter Dengler appeared by the end of the film to have learned nothing from incarceration, escape or seeing his friend violently killed so close to being rescued. In my view, not a classic wartime drama. Just another good old boy doing his duty kind of film. The ending was sick. So, a beautifully shot film, some good images (including a raft shot straight out of Aguirre Scourge of God) and lines of dialogue but stereotypical in the telling of the story of a side bar of the Vietnam War and trite.

2986966,5,B000WMA6R8,"A great film for the action-adventure crowd, especially because it is true and very close to the actual events of Dieter Dengler's shoot-down and captivity. It also is very well shot in the jungles of Thailand, jungles very similar to Laos and northern South Vietnam.

As Christian Bale says, the actors didn't try to imitate the real life characters, they just based their performances on the characters without trying to copy their speech inflections and mannerisms. This is a truly great film from the point of view of someone who has been there and knows the terrain of the triple canopy jungle in that deadly area of NW South Vietnam and SE Laos. That it has a happy ending is simply an accident of events and the good fortune of one person.

Dieter Dengler should have been a national hero, with his name on the lips of everyone in the USA. That would have happened if he hadn't been flying in the wrong war at at the wrong time. LBJ and the CIA were conducting a totally illegal black war in Laos and the men who were shot down mostly paid the ultimate price for having been there. Dieter Dengler had an irrepressible optimism, unrelenting determination and the good fortune of happy coincidence on his side or he, too, would have been one of those permanent MIA's.",1385251200,,1272,4.599118942731278

But this actually works in its favor, giving it a gritty and real feel. Christian Bale continues to amaze, not only is this role wildly different from Batman, but he inhabits it so well, that you pretty much forget it is Bale or you think this must be the ""real"" Bale.

The story itself is incredibly compelling. Brutal, real, sad, inspiring. All of that. The more so because it is apparently mostly true (I gather that there are some descendants of some of the secondary characters who dispute some of the movie's accuracy).

The movie isn't long, but you feel like you have been through the ringer. Never boring, the movie paces itself remarkably well, alternately showing the painful slow passage of time and then with the anxious desperation of events that quicken the pace.

I am very glad I sought this one out.",1344297600,,934,4.580838323353293
2986989,3,B000WMA6R8,"Am a fan of Christian Bale. His performances are often sublime, fascinating and like him or not - almost always engaging. Reconnected with the actor over the past decade or so having last seen him as a young boy in '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Empire-of-the-Sun/dp/B007KW5N9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Empire of the Sun</a>'. Admittedly stunned at the skilled actor he had become while screening '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Machinist/dp/B001U0HAZM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Machinist</a>'. Just one of many excellent, even amazing, performances.

However, this isn't one of them.

It took me a while to verbalize what I couldn't put a finger to at the time. A recent second screening allowed me to note the issues I have with this production.

Firstly, this felt and played like a television movie, with the accompanying cheesy effects, pedestrian screenplay and lazy cinematography. The sets, while undoubtedly close to authentic, filmed cheap; too many scenes looking like they were done in a climate controlled sound stage.

Add to the list of mishandled opportunities: Underutilizing the natural locale; not providing us the scale of the escape. It must have seemed like an insane plan to the desperate prisoners. But because Director Werner Herzog doesn't give us the immensity of the journey, according to the maps of Laos and Thailand I scoped before writing this review, the critical moment comes off as very local; as if freedom was merely over a mountain range. The scale, so important for us to feel and understand the massive undertaking of the escape, is never properly defined, hollowing the drama considerably.

Additionally, and it's something I've never seen Bale do - overact. Not in every single scene, but at times. And it's embarrassing given his immense skill set and ability. Again, one can solely lay this at the feet of Director Herzog. Unsurprisingly,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/his-next-mainstream-directorial-effort-bombed/dp/B002TVQ48K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">his next mainstream directorial effort bombed</a>. I'm unfamiliar with his German productions so perhaps this is reflection of a lost-in-translation situation. Historically, some European and Asian directors can't segue into US mediums. That or he's just a so-so director. I like to give him the benefit of the doubt.

In fact, I think it's fair to call this Christian's weakest career performance, even though that's still generally better than most of his peers. And made more apparent given that that list includes running around as a costumed comic book character.

My harshest criticism is directed at the ending of the movie - ack - trite. An insincere finish and one that I despised given how little effort went into correctly training the actors to look and move as Naval personnel. The worst? The person who played the emcee - blatantly not an actor and apparently some buffoonish relation to one of the producers. How about a steak? No, how getting a professional performer in there Herzog? Astounding horrid closure to a mishandled project. A disservice to the memories of the men whose lives this movie is based on.

My only compliment is for Steven Zahn. Very high marks - one of the few performances that rang completely true. To date, the finest performance of the surprisingly versatile character actor I've screened. Sadly, his outstanding execution is utterly lost in this mediocre product.

Ultimately, this movie has the basic elements to showcase an incredible journey of survival and the endurance of the human spirit - but fails to capitalize on the talent and core basic elements at hand. To see how this could have been done, I suggest screening '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Way-Back/dp/B004C45AX2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Way Back</a>' which utilizes similar content, but producing vastly superior results. Also consider watching '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gulag/dp/6303425577/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gulag</a>' from 1985. A stunning cable film that revealed the horrors of the communist ""justice"" system. Unfortunately, this is one of the many lost HBO movies, and therefore only available in the VHS format.

I'm torn as to where the line should be drawn. And yet another case for the Amazon half-star.

Call it a high three for Zahn's outstanding effort alone.

Movie Note: In doing research for the real story that formed the basis of the screenplay, I was surprised to learn how much Herzog had omitted, contrived and fabricated. Gene DeBruin, the character played by actor Jeremy Davies, was at the very least slandered. And at the very worst, defamed. If you're interested in hearing the other side - search for the website dedicated to Gene's memory. Quite a different tale told by survivors and witnesses.",1343865600,,4974,5.789329685362517

Werner Herzog's movies can at times be way too intense to get through but they are worth the journey. This role of Dirk Diggler (oops, real life war hero Dieter Dengler, I meant) also proves Christian Bale is the best actor on the planet period (sorry, Deppster and Leonardo).

You can read the synopsis elsewhere so I won't spoil it but the casting was spot on and the cinematography is superb esp. from the opening bombing raid
sequence through to when Bale gets captured.

Also, fans of the TV series ""Lost"" watch for the Darma Intiative's boss in a bit part and Faraday as the yin to Bale's yang in the POW camp.

The extras are well worth the price of the DVD as you get about 45 minutes of how the actors got that POW look, how Herzog threw himself into the task, how the jungle is truly a ""character"" in the movie and the true story of how the real Dieter Dengler shows how an optimistic outlook on life can truly be lifesaving.

Dieter Dengler's life and his particular experience in Vietnam was truly compelling enough without Herzog's fictional bungling...actually slanderous bungling! (Lord, I'm going to be using a lot of exclamation points here!)

Herzog's portrayal of fellow captive Eugene Debruin as a coward and quasi-traitor is ludicrous! On the contrary, this man stayed behind after the prison break to tend to another severely sick and incapacitated inmate. He sacrificed his only chance at freedom and was likely executed for his unselfish heroism. Why did Herzog have to make him out as a coward? To add to the drama? I don't get it. Even Dengler in the books ""Little Dieter Needs to Fly"" and ""Hero Found"" acknowledged Debruin's sacrifice. Eugene's family is justly outraged.

Other than that glaring twist of the facts, it is a pretty good action movie. Bale gives a very good performance. At least Herzog didn't place some fictional native love interest in the movie as most of the ""Based On A Real Story"" movies do.",1317686400,,1175,4.894472361809045

2986995,3,B000WMA6R8,"Rescue Dawn may distort history, but for a Hollywood production it has more than moments which do not.  And the odds are it's been appreciated over the last half-decade for exactly that reason by Americans knowledgeable about the Vietnam War.

The movie stars Christian Bale and Steve Zahn as American warriors captured in Laos or northwestern South Vietnam in 1965, when according to the movie's pre-narrative, ""few Americans thought the Vietnam War would become an all out war.""  I must have been one of those few, because I knew President Lyndon Johnson was fully committed to America's long-dead South Vietnamese puppet Diem's refusal to honor the Geneva Accords; and I sensed that America's buildup for (if not the actuality of) the bombing of North Vietnam, Operation Rolling Thunder, had begun.

The movie's first scenes take place aboard the U.S.S. Hornet (having survived WW II with laurels), in the Gulf of Tonkin, and the most cracking-wise loudmouth among the officer-pilots is a man with the soon-to-become-notorious moniker ""Spook.""

A Navy pilot, Bale is shot down by ground fire on his first bombing mission from the Hornet across South Vietnam.  At the time, America's attacks on Laos to interdict Viet Cong supply lines into South Vietnam were well-guarded CIA secrets, and kept out of America's big media; after all, Laos was a separate country bordering on South Vietnam, a member of the United Nations and presumably protected from American aggression by Article 4 of the U.N. Charter.

Bale and Zahn meet soon after Bale is shot down, in captivity in Laos (the DVD's blurb says the POW camp is in northwestern South Vietnam, but Zahn says he thinks it's in Laos), and in less than a year they escape down a tributary to the Mekong River.  The escape is reminiscent of The African Queen (regarding leaches among other things), while before the escape the POW camp scenes were reminiscent of The Bridge on the River Quai (regarding POW in-fighting and the ""impenetrable forest"" being the POW camp's walls).

But what impressed me most about Rescue Dawn were not its war and POW camp scenes, which occupy probably 98% of the movie's running time, but two after-Bale's-return-to-safety scenes.  There is first, Bale's hospitalization, rest, and recovery -- interrupted by his interrogation by two laughably sinister men in black suits from the CIA.  And then, this CIA interrogation is interrupted by several of Bale's shipmates, who clandestinely whisk him away from the hospital and the CIA clowns and return him to the Hornet.  Once back on his ship, Bale is honored by all hands for his extraordinary courage and escape from captivity, but more like the hero who scored a high-school football team's conference-winning points than like a Navy pilot and officer.  And at one point, the chubby master of ceremonies for Bale's shipboard reception says loudly to him: ""You MUST believe in something.""  Nailing it for 21st century moviegoers, Bale replies with his school boy's modest grin: ""I believe I could use a good steak.""

And these two completely impossible scenes brought home to me just how unlike Vietnam are America's apparently unstoppable wars in 2011; how de-institutionalized is military heroism today; and how most Americans only tolerate our soldiers like they tolerate Wall Street Billionaires and the inmates of our prisons -- if they remain nameless and faceless.  Yes.  Goddamit.  And how the very little in the larger scheme of things that was positive about soldier-ing in 1965 is gone, truly gone now the way of all flesh.",1313798400,,3564,5.052901023890785

Although it is suppose to be based on a true story, the director Werner Hertzog has embellished the exploits of fellow German Dieter Dengler and in doing so has sullied the names of others who were in the prison.

Two observations: One, in the Commentary on the deleted scenes Mr. Hertzog mentions several times the Lao peasants that played some of the roles.  It is infuriating to hear an educated person who can use people and call them peasants.  The lao people are some of the kindest and honest people I have had the chance to meet.  The people may be poor and they may lack formal education but they are survivors and deserve respect.

Two, One of the deleted scenes shows a farmer giving rice to Dieter and asking Dieter for his ring.  I doubt it would have happened that way.  The farmer would have give the rice to make merit and not for an earthly reward or there was an offer of a trade that Dieter tried to get out of after the fact.  In an earlier part of the movie Dieter was disappointed that he only got one day in Saigon to frolic with the go go girls and hookers yet, he make a big deal about his finacees ring.  I bet he had less of an attachment to the ring then the farmer had to his finger.

Three, Some of the people in Laos are very poor, any of the food they gave the prisoners would likely have graced the guards table as well. Seeing the prisoners eat mealy worms or bug larva is just day to day living for some people.",1307491200,,1588,4.239202657807309

Christian Bale is the main character, Dieter Dengler, a pilot in the Navy who gets shot down and is taken to a POW camp in Laos.  Along the way, Bale's character encounters two other very gifted actors.  First is Steve Zahn, who everyone thinks of as a comedic actor.  But in Rescue Dawn, he shows tremendous dramatic depth and is is enjoyable to watch him in this role.  The other great actor is Jeremy Davies. If you're a fan of the TV show Lost, you know him as Daniel Faraday (and it takes a few minutes to get used to seeing him in another role).  Together, the performances of these fine actors make the movie worthwhile.

2987007,5,B000WMA6R8,"This is one of the best films I've seen for a while as it was very thought provoking and afterwards I wanted to know much more about the actual people the events were based around.  I found this film a highly realistic portrayal of the experiences of those unfortunate POW's in their years of captivity in the jungle, far from home, with little or no prospect of rescue, the interaction with other prisoners being the only thing that kept them alive. I felt the key characters were portrayed in a way that made the viewer feel in their position.  What a terrible reality they were suffering, trying to survive day by day, and being shackled like caged animals by cruel captors, living in their own excrement and facing death daily. I found this film made as big an impact on me as I had felt watching The Deer Hunter, and the reason being the sheer horror of the reality of these people's lives and the futility of their situation.

Whilst I appreciate the family of Eugene Debruin do not feel the character was accurate, I none the less found the portrayal facinating, as THIS person (Eugene) had suffered for over two years before the film's main character appears (Dengler), and the Director does a good job in showing Eugene's suffering and his state of mind that must have been close to the truth of a person in his situation at that time, even if not the actual truth of Debruin himself. I think the character of Eugene shouldn't be taken too literally, and he represents a victim of prolonged incarceration and what is really heartbreaking is that he doesn't appear to survive at the end of the movie.  If he is shown as confused or resigned, then if not this exact character in the movie then there would have been hundreds or thousands like him, so I did not interpret the character as being necessarily accurate in precise detail, but the portrayal evokes strong emotions of the hopelessness that must have been felt.  The actor Jeremy Davies, did a truly excellent job in the role, not necessarily of the real Eugene, but of the type of long suffering, despairing and resigned POW.

Steve Zahn is incredible as the doomed Duane Martin, fighting for survival, pitiful, incredibly weakened yet somehow surviving weeks on the run in the jungle only to meet the most shocking and horrendous end. By this time the viewer is numbed by the horror that his extremly weak friend witnesses. Regards this friend, and the main character, Dengler, he is portrayed ultimately as the hero not least as he is the only American who actually survives the terrible ordeal and lives to tell the tale, and so this is his story, and Christian Bale is superb in the role. You feel his ordeal every heartaching minute and the outcome is a miracle. There are no clues as to how it will all end for the characters, as they are in an impossible situation from the outset. The fact that there are any survivors at all makes it a story worth telling.

Werner Herzog crafted an incredible film from Dieter Denglers story of survival, making it an historical yet painful tale, which leaves you aching with worry for those that didn't make it out and are still listed as Missing In Action to this day.  Its not a war movie and yet war creates the background to the story.  It is a movie of survival against impossible odds, and the tragic deaths of so many who died in the jungle whose final stories will never be known and who in time will be forgotten. This film helps us remember the brave attempts at survival of Dieter Dengler, Duane Martin, Eugene Debruin, their friends, and thousands of other POW's.

Bale is fine as stoic figures like Batman, but when asked to show real emotional depth, as here, he comes up empty. Even his American accent fails at times; it's not hard to hear that this is not his native dialect, which takes away a lot of the realism. All told, I was rather disappointed with this movie. I like some of Herzog's work, especially Aguirre, but something about this one just didn't move me. True story or not, it felt forced and far too film-like.

I kept thinking about Papillon, and how touching that movie was, and how I just wasn't feeling much for any of these characters. It gets better as it goes, but the opening seemed very staged and fake, especially the scene where Spook is cracking wise about the training films. He wasn't very funny, but everyone kept laughing their phony laughs, and it detracted from any sense of reality. It also felt like Herzog didn't really know how to make the ship life seem authentic; he's much better directing a couple guys in the jungle than a group of people in normal life. Maybe that's because he knows this isn't really a true story.

A little research reveals Herzog's dishonest and self-serving lies about Eugene Debruin's actions in the camp, and Dengler's feats in general. Herzog makes Gene look like a villain and an idiot, while those who were there say it was just the opposite; Dengler did very little of what he's given credit for here: engineering the breakout, etc. But of course this is Werner's second movie about his little hero Dengler, whom he seems to think will bring credit to all Germans if Herzog can just make up enough lies about his ""heroic"" actions. Instead, it just makes me respect Herzog less, as a director and a German (I enjoy German culture in general, so spare me the polemics). If you really love this film, do some research and see what the real story is. It ain't what we're fed here.

It looks good on blu-ray, and my favorite thing about the movie was the excellent score, which heightened the proceedings immensely. But I had to agree with my girlfriend when she said, ""This just isn't that interesting."" Somehow, this exciting ""true"" tale felt like a Hollywood film in many of the worst ways, especially the occasional weirdly jingoistic moments.

This is the story of an American pilot shot down over Laos early in the war before it was common knowledge that the USA was bombing in Laos. This is a tough, gritty, hard movie.

The movie was well created with realistic settings (mostly filmed in Thailand). Yes, I do recommend this movie, but, make sure you are ready for a 2+ hour heavy war movie.

2987013,5,B000WMA6R8,"I can't remember the last time I actually found a movie worth seeing in a theatre. I did not see this film in a theatre, but I wish I had!

I first heard of Dieter Dengler from the Guidebook For Marines. His story is mentioned in the Code Of Conduct chapter, as an example of how an American fighting-man should conduct himself as a P.O.W.

As a Naval aviator during the Vietnam War, he served aboard the aircraft-carrier  U.S.S. Ranger. Dengler flew an AD Skyraider, a prop-plane designed for close air-support and reconaissance. Assigned to fly a secret mission to bombard targets in Laos, Dengler was shot down, and manged to evade capture for some time.

Captured by Pathet Lao guerrillas, he was brutally beaten, and eventually interned in a small P.O.W. camp with two other Americans and a small group of Thais. All of the others were personnel employed by Air America, except for Duane Martin, who was an Air Force pilot.

Having no intention of staying in this prison, Dengler improvised a number of tools for an escape attempt. He eventually mobilized the others into making an ingenious escape effort. When the time came, Dengler killed the guards with their own weapons. Dengler and Martin set out together, into the jungle, toiling through dense foliage, mud, incessant rain, illness ...and afflicted by such jungle-pests as leeches and insects. Sadly, Martin was later murdered by a Lao farmer. Dengler survived for 23 days in a hostile environment, hunted by Pathet Lao soldiers, before he was eventually rescued by an Air Force helicopter crew.

This movie is a fine portrayal of Dengler's impressive and relentless will to survive.

I do not know where the film was shot, but some truly incredible mountain and jungle landscape is featured throughout.

Sadly, Mr. Dengler is no longer with us. Afflicted with ALS, he passed away on 7 February, 2001.

Mr. Dengler was born in Germany, and witnessed World War II as a child, as Allied forces invaded in 1945. Watching the exploits of Allied fighter-pilots inspired him to become a pilot. As a teenager, he was apprenticed as a machinist, and saved his money to emmigrate to America. At age 18, he sailed to the U.S., and survived on the streets for a short time, before enlisting in the Air Force in 1957, where he  served as a gunsmith.
Dengler took the test for aviation late in his enlistment, and passed. However, his enlistment was soon completed, before he could enroll in the program, and he moved to California to attend college. He was accepted into the Navy cadet Program, and was soon commissioned. He originally trained as a Skyraider pilot, but was trained to fly jet-aircraft after his P.O.W. ordeal. After his time in the Navy, Dengler was employed as a test-pilot for TWA.

Another point of interest regarding Mr. Dengler:
While attending S.E.R.E. school, Dengler escaped the simulated P.O.W. camp THREE TIMES, ...and was the only student in his group to actually GAIN weight!",1256774400,,2956,4.856858846918489

Regardless of whether or not the movie was historical, I think they just made the acting too dry and boring.  Except for the opening and ending scenes, this thing might as well be a documentary, not a movie.  It has the feel more of a slow documentary than a movie.  I found the attempt at humor to be sad.  It came off strange when they tried to mix serious POW environment with poor comedy about someone messing his pants every night.  I really don't know much about Christian Bale.  When I first read the reviews on this film, a lot of people kept saying how Christian was such a good actor in this movie.  I've come to believe that some people fall under the bandwagon syndrome than they realize.  Would anyone in their right mind say that that was great acting?  Give me a break.  Not trying to disrespect Christian Bale, (I've recently seen him in 3:10 to Yuma and thought he did some pretty good acting there.) but sometimes I think people find out that some guy is supposed to be one of the best actors out there, and all of a sudden they are afraid to give any negative criticism about the guy's acting in anything because they might look like they don't know what they are talking about.  This movie drags and some of the acting is just flat out pathetic.  If you want to see a movie because Christian Bale is in it, don't make it this one.",1251763200,,1505,4.309608540925267

2987017,5,B000WMA6R8,"Another war movie, however, this one is a little bit different from all the other ones.  Instead of focusing on constant shooting action, strategies involving taking out the enemies, and other things you'd expect in a war movie, this one focuses LESS on action, and more on the Americans escaping from a Vietnamese prison during the war.

Do they eventually escape?  Well, you probably know the answer to that one.  But the film actually does a good job focusing on the Vietnamese, and the way they went about their lives during the war.

The place the captured Americans were held wasn't exactly the worst place in the world, perhaps the prisons in Vietnam weren't really that bad, or maybe the films developers just didn't do a good enough job showing what those prisons were REALLY like, I don't know the answer to that one.

I just know Rescue Dawn was a good movie because you kept pulling for the Americans to get out of jail, find a clear exit, and hope the helicopters eventually arrive.

I'm reluctant to reveal TOO much more about this movie because war films don't usually vary much with each one, so I don't want to spoil what little surprises this film features that you haven't seen before.

2987018,5,B000WMA6R8,"I was disturbed to learn, after seeing and admiring Werner Herzog's ""Rescue Dawn,"" that the surviving families of Dieter Dengler and other Vietnam-era POWs depicted in the film accuse Herzog of lying outright about these men and their histories. In particular, they say he desecrates the memory of Gene DeBruin, a far more positive, courageous  and altruistic man in real life than as portrayed by Jeremy Davies in the film. In the DVD commentary, Herzog said he wished he had known the additional information about DeBruin before he made the film; DeBruin's surviving family members, however, say Herzog ignored their multiple attempts to contact him.

This news leaves me sad and uncertain what to think. Certainly Herzog's film, for the sheer quality of what's on screen, is powerful and inspiring. Herzog was so moved by Dengler's story that he filmed it twice: first as a documentary, ""Little Dieter Needs to Fly,"" and then as ""Rescue Dawn."" The real Dengler--a Navy pilot who was the only Vietnam POW to successfully escape from the Viet Cong--had enough courage, grit, optimism and resourcefulness for a dozen Navy flyers, and Christian Bale gives the performance of his career so far as Dengler. So does Steve Zahn as Duane Martin, Dengler's fellow POW. The film is suspenseful, even harrowing--Herzog, as always, put himself, his cast and his crew through a myriad of extreme situations--and Peter Zeitlinger's photography of the Southeast Asian jungle is magnificent. So how am I to feel upon learning that such a brilliant film misrepresents the lives of some of the people it depicts? All I can say is, see this film for the excellence of its craft, but take the story with a grain of salt.",1244678400,,1702,4.968421052631579

2.  However, when the movie was over, I was left with a feeling of disappointed / dissatisfaction.  After thinking about it for a while, I guess the my main problem (s) with the film is that the Christian Bale's performance was odd vs unconvincing.  I know that the pilot in real life was known for his positive attitude, but Christian Bale's performance makes him out to be a goofball... at times.  Being former Navy and in the aviation community, I know that aviators are a unique group of people, often being very ""colorful"", however I've never met or known a Naval aviator that was a goofball as portrayed via C. Bale.
  Then on top of that, it was disconcerting that after the pilot's escape companion was killed, there was minimal reflection on his fellow POWs after getting rescued.  The film portrayed the pilot as just being concerned with the fact that he was rescued; ie again, there pilot's character lacked any type of depth or complexity.  It just didn't ring true.

3.  Anyway, I'm sure that a lot of folks have a different take on this.  This will spur me on to get the documentary via the same director;  by definition, this will be a more realistic take on what the pilot was all about as well as his story etc..",1244592000,,1280,4.461206896551724

Visually, we couldn't have picked a better movie to inaugurate ourselves into the world of Hi-Def films. Herzog's cinematography is exceptional. The colors and details are so arresting and intense that, honestly, it is almost overwhelming for a moment. Unfortunately, the sightseeing doesn't get to last very long, as once Christian Bale's Deiter Dengler gets captured, the tone shifts visually to the muddy prison camp for much of the rest of the film.

I wish I had more to say about this movie, but unfortunately there's not much more to say: Christian Bale's performance is engaging, but on par with what we'd expect from him. The real star performance comes from Steve Zahn, who finally reveals that he can act. He performs well beyond what one would expect from the guy that starred opposite Jack Black in Saving Silverman, and if I had to pick one real reason for seeing this movie, it would be his performace.

This film is quite good at presenting not only the physical privations of torture and starvation but also the mental toll exacted by the fear, boredom, and hopelessness of incarceration.  Set against this backdrop, Dieter's refusal to give up becomes a powerful testament to the resiliency of the human spirit.

2987031,4,B000WMA6R8,"It's been quite a few years since Werner Herzog did a major fictive film. The last couple of decades has seen an increasing veer into documentaries and more experimental cinema. However, with 2007 film, Rescue Dawn, Herzog shows that the years have not taken their all too inexorable toll on the visionary mind. While the film is not an inarguably great masterpiece along the lines of some of his classic fictive films from the 1970s, it is a terrific war film, but, more so, a terrific prison escape and action film, even as it wholly subverts many of those subgenre's worst banalities.
  The film is sometimes an expansion, condensation, and retelling of the same basic tale Herzog told in his classic 1997 documentary Little Dieter Needs To Fly. That film chronicled the life and capture, over Laos, of a German born U.S. Navy Pilot named Dieter Dengler, who spent six months as a prisoner of war in Laos, before escaping with six other men into the jungle. Only Dengler was known to have survived. Rescue Dawn details and condenses many aspects of the earlier film, and is well acted by a stellar cast, well directed by Herzog, and brilliantly cinematographed by Peter Zeitlinger, who melds the stunning visuals of Thailand with Herzog's own classic `eye level realism' to evoke some of the same sorts of jungle imagery that made films like Aguirre: The Wrath Of God and Fitzcarraldo so impressive. On top of that is the wonderful film scoring by Klaus Bedelt, which is very minimal yet effective when employed; mixing the high and low forms of music Herzog is known for.
  The plot is rather simple, and greatly condenses the tale the real Dengler tells within the earlier film.... The acting, especially on Bale's part, is outstanding. In each of his roles, Bale creates characters wildly different from each other. Comic actor Steve Zahn also shines as the timid Duane Martin, and Jeremy Davies makes for an excellent counterpoint to Dengler's exuberance, whether true or not. And the film also benefits by its fast pace. Despite being 125 minutes in length, the film never has `dead air'. It moves relentlessly from scene to scene, often being cut just before a typical Hollywood moment would arise in an action film. Thus, Herzog gives the viewer their Hollywood steak while not clogging their arteries with the mindless fat.
  Yet, despite all its excellent points, at its heart, this film, unlike the documentary version of Dengler's life, is simply a deeper action film (a sort of leaner, meaner The Bridge On The River Kwai); it lacks the overall intellectual depth, probing, and agon that defines great art and suffuses Herzog's fictive classics from earlier in his career, even as it is a significantly better work of art than such a similarly themed and lauded film as The Deer Hunter. Rescue Dawn, however, and despite its near miss at greatness, is certainly a must see for those people who want to get a richer perspective on the Vietnam War, and deserves its place alongside Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket as unique visions of that war. But, to get an even fuller sense of what the war and Dieter Dengler were all about, watch Little Dieter Needs To Fly right afterwards. It's called eating the cake whilst having it, too; but, more than that, one will find that the cake is also surprisingly healthy and enlivening.

2987034,4,B000WMA6R8,"Inspired by the true story of Dieter Dengler's (Christian Bale) ordeals during the Vietnam war, Rescue Dawn follows Lt. Dengler on his very first combat mission.  Prior to the primary ground battles, U.S. troops flew bombing raids missions into Laos, and it is during one such excursion in 1965 that Dengler's plane took ground-fire that caused a crash.

While jungle survival videos produced by the military were supposed to keep a downed pilot safe in Dengler's situation, they did no such thing.  Woefully unprepared for the jungle, he's captured in a matter of days and soon faces months of sadistic torture at the hands of both the Laotians and the Vietnamese.  Beatings, being bound and tied to a moving oxen, and nearly drowned, he's eventually moved to a P.O.W. camp where other soldiers are being held.  It is in this prison camp that a daring rescue attempt is devised by the shared contributions of the prisoners, as Dengler and other prisoners fight through the jungles of Laos towards Thailand and eventual freedom.

Convincing as Dengler, Christian Bale really sells out for this role.  Throughout the movie his physical condition noticeably worsens, his weight takes a dramatic drop, and he truly looks like he may have been tortured as a POW.

Troubling, however, is what I have read since watching the movie.  Evidently, several other prisoners and their families take umbrage with the manner in which the movie portrays certain events.  Werner Herzog takes liberties with certain facts, giving credit to Dengler when others were responsible, and painting other prisoners in a negative light when, in fact, they were courageous and patriotic throughout the entire ordeal.

Not knowing the contested history, this movie is a solid contribution to Hollywood's Vietnam oeuvre.  It's a tense, harrowing drama, and I'm upset that this is based in even the remotest sense on reality.  Knowing that certain portrayals within the movie inaccurately tarnish the legacy of good men who gave their lives upsets me even more.",1217721600,,2030,5.096676737160121

Rescue Dawn tells the true story of Dieter Dengler, a Navy pilot shot down and taken prisoner in the Vietnam conflict. The movie title is a little bit misleading, since the movie does not center on a ""rescue"" so much as it does the escape and survival of the prisoners. The movie definitely centers around Dengler, and I think they were trying to give you a real sense of the isolation and confusion that came with being a prisoner of war (it's a little bit artsy).

The characters (mostly fellow prisoners) and Christian Bale as Dengler were terrific. The story flowed well and I was on the edge of my seat almost the entire movie. Great scenery, great acting, great situations. The special features fill you in on some of the details of Dengler's life too. Overall, you can't miss with a true survival story in Vietnam.

2987038,3,B000WMA6R8,"Werner Herzog, the filmmaker behind such legendary films as ""Fitzcarraldo"", ""Aguirre: The Wrath of God"" and the documentary ""Grizzly Man"" among many others, made a documentary called ""Little Dieter Needs to Fly"" almost a decade ago. The filmmaker follows Dieter Dengler, a pilot with the United States Navy during the Vietnam War, as Dengler revisits the country where he was shot down and taken prisoner and as he returns to his home country of Germany. Herzog believed the story to be so powerful that he decided to make a film about the incident.

""Rescue Dawn"", directed by Herzog and starring Christian Bale as Dieter along with Jeremy Davies and Steve Zahn as two of his fellow POWs, follows Dieter as he prepares for his first mission as a pilot in the late 60s. He receives instructions to fly into Laos, before the war has even begun, to bomb suspected targets. During the mission he is quickly shot down and tries to attract a rescue copter or plane. Instead, soldiers and extremely angry militia find him and take him to a POW camp, where he meets Duane (Steve Zahn) and Gene (Jeremy Davies), two of the handful of American soldiers who are already being held captive in a small clearing in the middle of the harsh, hot jungle. Their guards aren't giving them enough food or water, they are chained up at night, and Dieter realizes he simply can't sit around waiting until they starve to death or the guards decide to shoot them because they are bored. He comes up with an escape plan and tries to convince everyone that it will work. But as they are starving and any potential escape means living in the jungle for a significant period of time, they are frightened and scared of the prospects.

I understand what Christian Bale is trying to do as Dieter, but the effect is still a little strange. And the character doesn't work. When we first meet Dieter, we could be watching a sequel to ""Top Gun"", the pilots are in a briefing, ready and raring to go, ready to jump into their planes and start flying. There are no political discussions about their mission and the objective, they are American pilots and their mission is their objective. And Dieter is particularly gung ho as this is his first mission. He smiles as everyone pats him on the back because they know this is the culmination of a lifelong dream for Dieter; Dengler was actually born in Germany and immigrated to the United States and became a citizen always dreaming of becoming a pilot and flying planes. Bale uses a very slight accent to portray Dengler's origins. And throughout the film, this accent gets a little more pronounced when Bale is trying to show Dengler's frustration. I get this part of the character. What was less successful for me was Bale's portrayal of Dengler's 'enthusiasm' throughout the film. As Dengler tries to convince the rest of the POWs, he seems to smile here and there, trying to show them that his plan will work, that there isn't a lot of danger out there. Throughout, he appears to remain particularly lucid and determined, as though the lack of food, water and livable conditions has no effect on him.

When you watch Bale's performance next to that of Steve Zahn and Jeremy Davies, there is just something that doesn't mesh. Granted Duane and Gene have been in captivity longer, but even when Dengler is loosing weight (Bale will soon challenge DeNiro for the title of ""Most Method Actor in Films"" if he continues to lose and gain weight for every film role) he continues to appear determined and the madness affecting his friends never seems to enter the picture for Dengler. This, combined with the faint accent, makes the character seem less real even though I am sure Bale studied footage of the real Dengler, studied his mannerisms and voice.

Because there are really no politics in this film, it becomes less interesting somehow. Initially, the pilots are gung ho for the mission, despite the fact they are about to bomb many villages. And the conclusion of the film seems to indicate Dengler is ready and willing to go on another mission, as soon as he has recovered. In fact, a coda states as much at the end of the film.

I have not see ""Little Dieter Needs to Fly"", but I have to think that Herzog probably captured some remorse from the former pilot. In ""Rescue Dawn"", the story ends much earlier than this and we have no evidence of this.

""Rescue Dawn"" is an interesting story but it lacks the necessary punch or a great performance from Bale to fully move the viewer.",1216857600,,4499,4.652830188679245

In ""Rescue Dawn,"" Christian Bale plays Dieter Dengler, a navy pilot who was shot down over Laos in 1966.  He spent many months in a prisoner-of-war camp not far from the Ho Chi Minh Trail, suffering torture and starvation along with the half dozen or so other men who were imprisoned with him.  A man of great determination and resourcefulness, Dengler engineered a daring escape that earned him the Navy Cross, the Distinguished Flying Cross and a Purple Heart.

""Rescue Dawn"" was directed by Werner Herzog, the world-famous auteur of such visionary films as ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God,"" ""Fitzcarraldo"" and ""Grizzly Man.""  Given that pedigree, one is struck by just how conventional a piece of filmmaking ""Rescue Dawn"" turns out to be (Herzog made a documentary on Dengler, entitled ""Little Dieter Needs to Fly,"" in 1997).  Perhaps because the director found himself hemmed in by the biographical nature of the material, ""Rescue Dawn"" feels pretty much like every other prisoner-of-war film set during the Vietnam Era (and before).  The main distinction of this movie lies not in its plot details or character insights but in the fact that Bale and several of the other actors were willing to go on drastic diets and drop massive amounts of weight in order to achieve their emaciated looks.  With their ribs and spines clearly sticking out through their taut skin, the actors never allow us to doubt for a moment their total commitment either to the material or to their art.  The problem is that it becomes such a distraction to us in the audience that it may actual have the opposite effect than what was intended. We begin to worry more about the actors than about the characters, questioning whether any role is worth putting one's health and life at risk in such a manner.  In other words, rather than drawing us deeper into the story, it actually winds up pushing us away.

Reservations aside, it is important to note that ""Rescue Dawn"" is still a film well worth seeing.  It is superbly acted by Bale, Jeremy Davies and Steve Zahn (as two of his fellow POWs), and  features any number of disturbing, harrowing moments as we watch men, pushed to the limit of their endurance, trying to keep hope alive even after all reason for hope has vanished.  We watch in complete empathy as deprivation, confinement and emotional abuse take their toll on the characters` bodies, psyches and spirits.  The last half hour of the film, in particular, is poignant and heartbreaking as the men become increasingly desperate in their efforts to stay alive.

I wish the filmmakers had provided some clue as to what happened to some of the other prisoners after they and Dengler part company late in the film.  We're happy that things eventually worked out well for Dengler, but we would like to know how the other characters we've come to care about fared as well.  I imagine that Dengler himself would have wanted it that way.",1201392000,,2924,4.790836653386454
2987056,4,B000WMA6R8,"This is another excellent movie concerning Viet Nam and Cambodia during the Viet Nam war. If you enjoyed ""Bat 21"", ""Platoon"", or ""Full Metal Jacket"" you will probably want to catch this one. This movie shows how a handful of prisoners try to escape deep from the jungles to return to their base. It is a enlightening and frightening experience. Bale does a great job as the lead character and the rest the support cast are quite good. The character development is what really pulls you into the movie. They make you feel their pain and realize how they were best able to cope with their circumstances. Good quality DVD with standard extras. Decent replayability.",1201132800,,662,4.765217391304348
2987057,5,B000WMA6R8,"Let me start this by saying that I was a personal participant in the rescue of Dieter Dengler. I was the loadmaster on the C-130 crew that spotted the fires he set and it was with a parachute from one of the flares he dropped that he signaled the pilot who finally saw him and effected his rescue. I am also an accomplished author and a frequent contributor to VIETNAM magazine.

With that said I must say that after reading Dieter's book and seeing the previous documentary, I am convinced that the criticims put forth regarding the accuracy of the movie are unfounded. Dengler makes it clear in his book that there was bad-blood between the Americans and the Thais and also makes it clear that it was he, in particular, who devised the escape plan. The movie version of his story condenses some events but that is what movies do. It also shows his fires being spotted by helicopters when it was actually a C-130 crew that he signaled, but so what? The movie was shot on location in Thailand using available resources and attention to detail is not possible in that kind of situation. What amazes me is that events depicted in the movie that I thought at the time were hookey actually happened, particularly the scene where his squadron mates spirited him out of the hospital and back to the carrier. As war movies go, this is probably the most historically accurate I've ever seen. As for how Gene DeBruin is portrayed, I would suggest that critics read Dengler's book. While he may be more kooky in the movie than in real life, Dengler implies that he was a little bit off his rocker.

Incidentally, as a fan of EMPIRE OF THE SUN, I don't think Herzog could have made a better choice than Christian Bale to portray a pilot in a survival situation.",1200873600,,1750,4.517350157728707

 Remember the sacrifices of so many unsung heroes of the front lines,for this isn't a propaganda and all that. If you think this film is all ********,then it saddens me as this film truly represents human beings' reactions and actions in times of real helplessness. Doesn't matter if you are the allies or the enemies. In the end, this film, for me at least, makes me thankful for the people who's destiny is to fight for their respective countries.

Lost in the jungle, he soons becomes captive in a prison camp, where he leads the other captives on a revolt.  Surrounded by jungle, however, escape from one prison soon leads to captivity in another...

Christian Bale is at his finest.  He never lets the viewer down; in ""Rescue Dawn,"" he gives you far more than what you ask for.  You ask for great acting, he gives you reality (watch the making-of documentary; dear God, the things these actors put themselves through for their art...).  Steve Zahn has been known for his comedic roles, but this film should put any doubts about his talent to rest; he is absolutely amazing.  Jeremy Davies, too, amazes; the three of them have a certain troubled dynamic that could only come from a true-life story.

Christain Bale while on a secret mission to bomb targets in Laos crash lands in that area which leads him to become a prisoner of war in the Vietnam camp. He meets a few other pow's who have turned light in the head due to their continued incarceration. We are shown christian bale and his buddies tied to stones at night so that there is no chance for escape. They are given the crappiest food to eat, usually some rice and water. Basically they are treated a little better than at a Nazi concentration camp. But I could not make out what the movie was about. Its got a bit of comedic relief
when the pow's chatter around when christian Bale tries to have intelligent conversation with his buddies (a bunch of loonies). He then hatches out a plan for escape. Its a pow story half the way, with a bit of comedy and then the other half is an escape story. But the problem is that I found the sublte comedy to be kind of taking away from the
eriousness or the horrificness the we should feel at a pow camp. The movie was kind of being light hearted about a very serious subject. It's a tough movie to classify. At times I felt it was like a documentary with seemingly unneccessary long takes or long winded conversations which did nothing to further the tempo of the story.

The facts surrounding this movie can be researched by an internet search about the book ""Escape from Laos"" by Dieter Dengler, or simply by a search about Dieter Dengler.

2987066,1,B000WMA6R8,"This movie is awful.  It's awful not so much of bad acting, it is awful because Werner Herzog is an opportunist and elevates an heroic character by sacrificing the good name Eugene DeBruin who was just as heroic as Dieter Dangler was and perhaps more so by sacrificing his own life to help a fellow prisoner, though most people do not know this.

Anyone interested in the truth should google Rescue Dawn The Truth.  This is a web site that Eguene DeBruin's brother has made and points out many egregious ommissions and twists of the truth that Werner made.  He basically strives to increase Danglers heros status through ommissions and distortation of the truth by villifying DeBruin.  He sacrifices this poor man and has no problem doing it for the good of his movie.  He rationalizes this by proclaiming his goal was to tell Dangler's story.  It's too bad that in doing so he creates a presumption that this movie is accurate when in fact Herzog clearly failed to do his research on the other characters.

Some factual errors include the wrong number of POW's, making DeBruin into a Charles Manson like charcter when in fact DeBruin was very caring of his fellow POW's.  DeBruin volunteered to stay behind during the  escape attempt to care for a sick prisoner who could not leave--this ultimately cost him his life. The escape plans were already formulated by the time Dengler became a prisoner not by Dengler himself.  DeBruin and another prisoner, not Dengler made the handcuff key that freed them at night.  Dengler was not the only prisoner to fire his weapon during the escape attempt.  In fact, another prisoner shot and killed the guards.  After the escape when Dengler and DeBruin met the movie portrays him as scared and indecisive, which is completely opposite of how DeBruin actually acted.  Dengler was hiding in the woods when Martin was killed by the villager, too weak to help and did not fend off the villages with his machete.  Dengler is documented stating that DeBruin was of strong character and Jerry DeBruin, brother of Eugene feels that Dengler, had he lived to see the making of this movie would not approve of Werner's portrayal of DeBruin.

One must take this movie with a grain of salt.  Dieter Dangler was a hero that is for sure but so were the others in that prisoner of war camp.  Werner wants to take advantage of Dangler's German immigrant status and make him the sole hero and defacto leader at the expense of the other prisoners, particularly DeBruin.

Believe what you want, but this film is not an accurate depiction.  It reminds me of the old saying; Believe half of what you see and none of what you read.  I think that saying is true here.  Eugene DeBruin was a hero and a patriot and his sacrifice should never be forgotten.  Consider this movie more of a work of fiction than anything else.",1199059200,,2835,4.680808080808081

2987078,5,B000WMA6R8,"Werner Herzog is a wonderful filmmaker and everything he does is worth seeing.  This movie is a dramatization of the events recounted in his 1997 documentary ""Little Dieter Needs to Fly"".  Because it is a dramatization, some of the events in the movie are conflated, and some of the characters are different than the real life people with those names.  For example, Jeremy Davies gives a wonderful performance as Eugene McBruin.  In the movie, McBruin provides threats and resistance to what Dengler is trying to do to survive.  He comes across as weak, broken by years of captivity, and unnecessarily contrary to the idea of escape.  However, his family rejects that portrayal.  This is an especially important point because there were reports of his being alive and in Laos until the 1990s.

The dramatizations aside, this is a very good movie.  Dengler was a German who was a child at the end of World War II.  His hometown was on the receiving end of air attacks from the allies and a particularly low and close flight by one pilot transformed Dieter and form that moment on he needed to fly.  He emigrated to the United States and joined the military so he could fly.  As the movie portrays, he was shot down in February 1966 and eventually captured, tortured, and imprisoned in Laos.

Eventually, he and his fellow inmates made a plan for escape and the latter half of the movie recounts that attempt in June 1966 and what happened afterwards.  The story is quite intense and Christian Bale does a fine job portraying Dengler.  Steve Zahn gives a very moving and emotional performance as Duane Martin, Dengler's closes friend among the prisoners.  Obviously, Dengler escaped and survived and we share the delight of his former crew when he returns to the ship.  And we share Dengler's sorrow at the loss and pain he suffered in captivity and during the difficult escape process.

In real life, Dengler left the service and became a test pilot and survived four additional crashes.  He later became a pilot for TWA.  He died of Lou Gherig's disease in 2001.

I give this movie a strong recommendation.

2987079,4,B000WMA6R8,"It's ironic (but not unexpected) that Herzog's most successful film to date is probably his most conventional, and least characteristic, film. What makes it seem uncharacteristic is its complete lack of irony, its refusal to stand at a distance from its characters or from the situation as they see it. Most of Herzog's films are explorations of obsessions, both their danger and excitement -- the capacity of obsession both to reveal and transcend as well as to destroy. In their unflinching look at the passions that drive men to create and destroy, Herzog gives a kind of portrait of himself, of what he admires and what he questions.

Here it is Dieter Dengler, played very well by Christian Bale (in another body altering performance), who is obsessed with flying. Of German descent, but now thoroughly Americanized, Dengler is not interested in war per se but takes advantage of the opportunity that military service provides him to become a fighter pilot. He ends up being shot down and captured, and the film explores his reaction to this captivity, and his drive to escape. Apart from a stubborn tenacity that brushes aside objections to his plan, Dieter is unambiguously presented as a hero in the tradition of classical American films. Herzog clearly admires the man, and this film (like the documentary upon which it was based - ""Little Dieter Needs to Fly"") is a celebration of his dedication and perseverance, and reveals a side of Herzog that may be less evident in many of his other films. One feature that makes it clearly not your average war prisoner film is its unwillingness to be judgmental about the captors -- who are in a precarious situation themselves and managing only as well as they know how. Rescue Dawn is, perhaps, not a film I'll go back to again and again like Aguirre or Fitzcarraldo or Stroszek or Lessons of Darkness or Wild Blue Yonder, but it is a very well made and well acted film -- and definitely one to watch.",1197158400,,1954,4.781065088757397

2987081,5,B000WMA6R8,"A very good movie.
unlike any war, vietnam, or prisoner of war story i can remember watching or reading.
it is the story of Dieter Dengler, the only US Navy pilot to escape from the Pathet Lao.

The story is a contrast of opposing ways of looking at both the world and yourself.
Dengler's vs. two other prisoners in the camp, one of resignation, the other one an outward optimism (rescue will come before the rainy season starts), but really another form of resignation and pessimism (because it isn't joined to action but to waiting).

What i find extraordinary is not the survival of people in such awful conditions, but how a single person, sustaining what really is an absurd optimism can uplift and motivate the whole group.

I think this is the message that the director wishes people to take home, optimism maybe misplaced, but without it hope flees. It is better to be an out of place foolish optimist then to resign yourself to your surroundings and give up.

It is an extraordinary message and it is provided to us in the movie with forcefulness and with a subdued passion for life that really ought to rub off on each viewer as she/he looks at their lives and says ""things really aren't that bad"", ""i just need to get moving in the right direction"", ""with the right attitude-like Dengler's"".

Where do people like this come from?
How do they sustain their optimism in situations that destroy other people?
If i can't be that person, how do i get to meet one and learn from watching them?

It is a worthwhile to own movie, i can only imagine what Dengler was like in person from watching the movie, i've never personally met anyone quite like him.
so i'm glad i ""met"" him in the movie.",1196294400,,1695,4.522875816993464
2987082,3,B000WMA6R8,"Christian Bale plays naval pilot Dieter Dengler, a German-born American citizen who is shot down during the early stages of the Vietnam War over Laos, and is then kept as a prisoner with other POWs in a small shack in the middle of the jungle. They struggle to survive with little or no food, as Dieter hatches a long-winded plan to escape the confines of the camp. Opening with real footage of a village being bombed, Werner Herzog's feature version of his 1997 documentary 'Little Dieter Learns To Fly' does little to expand on the themes explored more thoroughly in said doc. The problem here is a lack of a focus on the part of Herzog, who allows some plot strands to unfold to a point, but then frustratingly severs them without a proper conclusion. For about an hour in the middle of Dawn's running time, everything seems to hit its stride, and it appears to be unfolding tentatively and with genuine skill - taking things up several notches from the unemotional and dull opening. Bale and Zahn in particular excel in roles that have an indisputable emotional power - and not just in the staggering weight loss. There's a real sadness in Zahn's eyes that portrays a vast sense of emotion far beyond any other role of his career, and if there's any justice in the world, the former funnyman will bag his first Oscar nomination for this stunning performance. The same, however, cannot be said of the unbelievably irritating Jeremy Davies, who incoherently mumbles his way through another role. While a partial lack of urgency in the concluding twenty minutes will leave you scratching your head, Rescue Dawn is still a captivating story of survival that is helped enormously by a predictably brilliant Bale, and a stunning turn from Zahn.",1196208000,,1742,4.771523178807947
2987083,4,B000WMA6R8,"This was an interesting movie about a US Navy pilot who is shot down over Laos during the Vietnam War, captured by the Pathet Lao, imprisoned, and makes a daring escape thru the Laotian jungle. Dieter (Christian Bale) is an optimistic German-American POW, not at all cartoonish, gung-ho, or sadistic as portrayed in movies like THE GREEN BERETS-PLATOON-FULL METAL JACKET-THE DEER HUNTER, who knows he must escape his cruel captors before they kill him and the other prisoners. We feel his frustration and determination, despite the doubts expressed by the other POWs, that he will convince them that they must all work together if they are to survive. Dieter succeeds and he and fellow POW Duane (Steve Zahn) do make their getaway and struggle thru the jungle in search of freedom. This is a riveting look at the misery suffered by Americans captured by the enemy during the Vietnam War. It is an uplifting movie and I highly recommend it.",1196121600,,939,4.875
2987084,4,B000WMA6R8,"Christian Bale has been Oscar worthy time in and time out.  He is, without question, one of our finest working actors, so it is no surprise that the best thing about `Rescue Dawn' is Bale's harrowing performance.  As Lt. Dieter Dengler, Bale is breathtaking.  While the film itself is flawed his performance is far from it.

`Rescue Dawn' centers around a young pilot who is shot down behind enemy lines and taken prisoner by the Pathet Lao.  In his newfound POW camp Dengler meets five other captives who have been in captivity for a much longer period of time.  This fact is evident in their mental state for the lack of food and lack of hope has begun to strip away their sanity.  Dengler immediately makes a connection with the only stable man in the group, Duane Martin, and the two of them start to plan an escape.

As far as POW films go this film can't compare to greats like `The Deer Hunter' but it does have a lot going for it.  First of all it is visually mesmerizing.  To be honest I am reminded of the feeling I got when watching last years `The Painted Veil', that surreal overwhelming feeling of seeing something truly rich and lush, and there are many scenes, especially in the third act, that are supremely rich and lush.  The jungle is so green, so vibrant that it becomes its own character.  The acting on all fronts is great.  Much has been said of Steve Zahn's performance, and while I don't feel it was `a revelation' I do feel that it is his finest performance yet, but then again, that really isn't saying much is it?  Bale as has been mentioned time and time again is brilliant here.  If this movie had been released this month instead of mid-year he could be a serious contender for the Oscar, but sadly he will most likely be overlooked.

Jeremy Davies' character adds a lot to the feel of this film for he starts off where Dengler will ultimately end up (in regards to mental instability).  I think that is truly the beauty of Bale's rich performance.  He takes on such a transformation, yet it is so controlled and gradual that it never feels forced.  You have watched him transform before your eyes at such a natural pace that it all makes sense to you.  And not only does he take on the mental transformation, but physically as well he wastes away before the camera.

The direction by Werner Herzog is also very good and deserves mention.  Obviously he is very interested and connected to this heroic tale.  I think maybe that his `connection' to the subject may have blinded him slightly when concluding this picture, for those last few moments really do a number on the overall feel of the film.  In other words, I hated the ending.  It felt way too Hollywood for a film that up until that point felt nothing like the sentimental mush hand fed to the masses today.  That is a small bone to pick, I know, and the other flaws I find within the film are petty in themselves.  There are moments of sheer confusion which were slightly irritating (the POW camp scenes seem frantic at times and with everyone whispering it becomes a strain to try and follow what is actually going on) but overall it's nothing too disappointing.

In the end `Rescue Dawn' was a very good film, not perfect but not every film has to be.  Bale is as great as they say he is, but what else would you expect.  I will say that I hope and pray this at least picks up a Cinematography nomination at this year's Oscars for Peter Zeitlinger does such an outstanding job in allowing the scenery to move the film that I'm tempted to say he is the best thing to happen to this movie.",1196121600,,3581,4.422900763358778
2987085,4,B000WMA6R8,"I decided to pick up Rescue Dawn on Blu-ray as a blind buy after reading so many positive reviews of the film.  Overall, I was not disappointed!

First off, trailers for the DVD on television will make the movie appear to be packed with action.  It's not.  It's a character driven drama more than anything else, so if that's not what you're looking for go snatch up Die Hard 4 (another great movie).  What I found truly compelling is that you could see the characters' actual physical and mental changes throughout the story - especially Christian Bale's - and thus feel more emotionally attached to the characters and their fates.  Aside from the story itself, the movie looks beautiful in high definition (lots of lush green jungle scenes) and is very tastefully shot.  The sound is quite nice, too, although I don't have an audio rig capable of playing the DTS-HD soundtrack.

2987087,5,B000WMA6R8,"Christian Bale has found a role and a movie that match his talent, finally. Never mind that it was not a popular theatrical success; this is one that will be watched and remembered for years to come. The criticism hat it offers nothing new in the genre of P.O.W. films is mistaken for one simple reason: the other films don't have Dieter Dengler as a central character. While some have read his behavior while prisoner as arrogant, I found him instead to be optimistic, even, at times, naive; for days after seeing this in the cinema, the scene that remained with me was the one when he first tries to flag down a U.S. helicopter flying over, and instead is shot at, mistaken for the enemy. Dengler, rather than sink into utter despair, shouts back, ""Hey, you idiot! You almost hit me!"" That, I think, underscores the uniqueness of his character, the irrepressibility that makes him, and Bale's masterpiece of a performance, so unforgettable. This film by the way, is only enhanced by watching the documentary ""Little Dieter Needs to Fly,"" which should have been included in this DVD release. Kudos must also go to Klaus Bedelt, who in my opinion wrote a most poignant and appropriate soundtrack to this film. It brings a depth and dimension to the film, rather than merely hang as a supplement to it. And yet it stands completely alone as well, evocative of the film but not needing it to survive on its own as a stunningly well- wrought and lyrical piece of music.",1195862400,,1466,4.642307692307693
2987088,4,B000WMA6R8,"So speaks Dieter Dengler when asked for comment at the end of his journey of jungle captivity in Laos.  RESCUE DAWN is as much about the courage and fortitude of a captured soldier during wartime as it is about a true incident.  From the inherent optimism of pilot Dieter Dengler (played with commitment and finesse by Christian Bale) the story transcends biopic and offers lessons for life in general; the human spirit can be indefatigable.

Writer/director Werner Herzog has expanded his 1997 documentary about Dieter Dengler and in doing so he has provided us entry into the psyches of soldiers captured by the enemy and the extraordinarily trying conditions in which they survive. The optimistic and eager Dengler is sent on a classified mission to bomb certain targets in Laos in 1965 with his fellow pilots including his best friend Spook (Toby Huss).  Denlger is shot down and captured, interrogated, tortured, and placed in a prison with fellow inmates Duane (Steve Zahn in a career changing superb performance), Gene (the emaciated and excellent Jeremy Davies), Phisit (Abhijati 'Meuk' Jusakul), and Procet (Lek Chaiyan Chunsuttiwat).  The living conditions are deplorable: the men are starved, chained together making even the possibility of caring for bodily functions negligible, and the moral is low.  Dengler changes that using his ingenuity and immediately plans for escape.  Duane aids Dengler but Gene fears the consequences of an aborted escape attempt. Yet with Dengler's expertise and cunning the escape into the jungle is planned and is essentially successful - until the other enemy (the jungle) reduces the forces to one. As Dengler is rescued he is left with the ghosts of his fellow inmates, a factor that will haunt him and alter his life after rescue.

Christian Bale's performance is near perfect as are the performances by Zahn and Davies.  The film feels too long at times but that also suggests that director Herzog wants the audience to understand the mental deterioration and stagnant time cycle that cripples prisoners of war.  The atmosphere of the prison camp is presented well and if the ending of the film becomes a bit too 'Hollywood', after the 2+ hours of prison confinement that is somewhat of a relief.  RESCUE DAWN is a powerful film with some of the best acting of the year's crop and certainly deserves the attention of a wide audience.  Grady Harp, November 07",1195776000,,2407,5.035264483627204

You will leave this film with a new understanding of the human soul. An understanding that when man's heart is strong, he can survive anything.

It's more simple and straightforward than it could have been and feels like it was made for the laid-back moviegoer, not fans of war movies and/or serious filmmaking.
At times, some scenes felt as if they were straight out of a made-for-TV movie. There's no doubt that the POWs were in a stressful situation, but the film's direction doesn't make us feel it. It feels like actors playing the roles of soldiers in a POW camp -- you won't find much here along the lines of a ""Platoon"" or ""Saving Private Ryan."" In fact, you'll find some shades of ""Top Gun,"" namely because Bale's character comes off as an overly easygoing, happy-go-lucky, almost goofy guy. Now, perhaps the real-life person he's playing was like that in real life (I have not seen the documentary by the same director), but it just doesn't feel right. I was reminded of Tom Cruise playing Tom Cruise the Actor.

2987091,5,B000WMA6R8,"War stories from the Vietnam era are always daunting. Always told by the heroes who lived them--fine examples like Apocalypse Now and Platoon come to mind. They are always full of courage, patriotism but told with crude reality. Rescue Dawn tells the story of a brave American soldier who became a POW during the Vietnam War. He just wanted to be a pilot, but became something greater than that. The film's great story, acting, and visuals create a sense of realism that the audience will appreciate. This is the best war movie of 2007. Also, this is Christian Bale's best performance of his career and probably a contender for best actor at the Oscars.

Brief Story Intro:
It is 1965. US Navy Pilot Dieter (Christian Bale) is going to a secret mission to South East Asia--Laos is his destination. As he is flying through the mountains, his plane gets shot down by the enemy. Miraculously, he survives the crash, but now he has to run away from these Asian peasants who are looking restlessly for him. Unfortunately, he gets caught. After suffering torture, he is taken to a prison camp in this hostile jungle where he meets other Americans soldiers like Duane (Steve Zahn) and Gene (Jeremy Davies). He becomes the leader of the group by showing determination, ingenuity and courage. He doesn't want to stay long there--like many of them--so he masterminds an escape plan. They all agree, but Gene is not too sure about it--he believes that the war will end soon and they will be released. After secretly collecting simple tools, they plan their escape.

Review:
Based on a true story, told with intensity, but what really makes this movie shine? One of the most important aspects of Rescue Dawn is its realism. It is hard to find actors who want to go the ""extra mile"" to give life to their characters. The main actors look, in every sense, like real POWs from the Vietnam era--down to their starving bodies and personalities. They transformed themselves for this role and I praise that kind of commitment--great actors who have done the same are Charlize Theron (Monster) and Tom Hanks (Cast Away). Especially Christian Bale who plays a charismatic, next-door guy Navy pilot who just wanted to fly his plane, made fun of surviving military videos, but once he becomes a prisoner of war, he chances to a mature survivor who has to keep his sanity in order to survive his captors and the jungle--his biggest enemy of all. It is heartbreaking to see all the things our hero has to go through to be alive. He never gives up even though the odds are against him. I won't be surprised if Christian Bale gets a nomination for this extreme role.

I also praise the German director Werner Herzog whose cinematography has a bit of a ""documentary"" look--especially when Dieter is taken to the village when we see his captors and regular people from the village--and also displays a sense of isolation and beauty of the South-East Asia jungle--some of the visuals are very impressive, but there is more than that. Rescue Dawn has the best soundtrack of 2007. The music goes well with every dramatic scene. The beauty of the melodies are so uplifting, that gives the ending, one of the most satisfying moments in recent memory.

The Verdict:
War stories are best told by the people who lived them, day by day, tear by tear. The ones who suffered unimaginable things, but their will to survive, kept them alive. Rescue Dawn tells the dramatic story of one of those heroes from the Vietnam War--All with vanguard acting and visuals. Some might complain for its running time (126 minutes) but this is a small issue because this is one of the best films of 2007.",1192752000,,3647,4.720565149136577

2987093,5,B000WMA6R8,"Is there anything and any part that Christian Bale cannot do? Honestly,this phenom seems to be finally in the consistent top echelon movies and each time he astounds just as he did as a child in ""Empire of the Sun"" back in the mid 1980's.
I will say right here that Bale's performance as Dieter Dengler, the shot down Navy pilot who survived torture at the hands of the Laotians in pre-Vietnam War, is nothing short of amazing. He is in every scene in this 2 hour+human wartime drama by Werner Herzog;that it extremely demanding for an actor. It is obvious the amount of starvation weight loss that he underwent to BE Dengler at his lowest as a prisoner in Laos,eating worms and rice! Bale is so in control of his character that the viewer is extremely confident that what is on the screen is Oscar worthy. This entire film hangs on the strength of Bale's sensitive rendering of Dengler.
Without Bale, this film, as fascinating and riveting true story as it is,would be diminished in any other actor's hands. Not since Adrian Brody's Oscar winning role in ""The Pianist"" has a film so relied on the complete command of the material in the hands of the lead man. This is not to say that the supporting roles are not incredible,because Jeremy Davies and Steve Zahn as the two Americans interred with Bale in the cruel Laos camp are truly standouts as supporting actors.""Rescue Dawn"" is not so much a War film or a film that makes statements about War (though one is left to infer),but rather an in depth look into the character and makeup of humans in extraordinarily harsh conditions. Anyone would want Dengler as portrayed by Bale as their best friend; loyal,funny,charming,optimistic,resourceful,confident,apologetic and most of all incredibly and refreshingly innocent.
This film is so good all around that I find no fault with any of it. It is slow (it needs to be) and deliberate. Much of the dialog is barely above a hushed whisper. Close attention must be paid. Herzog puts his audience in the bamboo prison with the six captives. He shackles us nightly with the prisoners. Herzog allows the viewer to be a living but silent partaker in their incredible and inhumane suffering .We move through thick jungle brush while escaping our captors and we watch our friends die viciously.

2987095,4,B000WMA6R8,"The true story of German immigrant turned American pilot Deiter Dengler, (Christian Bale), and his subsequent capture, confinement and escape from a POW camp during The Vietnam War, echoes elements of The Great Escape, and several other escape films, while delivering its own distinct 'war is hell' eulogy in its shadowy, claustrophobic and artful camera eye which defines the hero and his fellow prisoners as a Christ figure surrounded by grungy devotees. Scenes within the confines of their jungle clearing bamboo prison cell, as the prisoners huddle together and whisper secret plans for escape, are indebted to images of famous classical Christian paintings, like an up-close and personal Da Vinci's Last Supper. With Deiter's return to freedom, in the sanitary and joyous sanctity of his home base, he is lifted horizontally above the heads of his cheering fellow soldiers while draped in white hospital convalescent clothing, looking like Jesus rising from the dead. In one scene he wrestles with a large serpant in an attempt to eat it. Director Werner Herzog's religious interpretations are like chapters that lead to a harrowing and godless scene, where an enemy in enemy land, (Deiter), screams in horror to a sky litttered with unwitting rescue helicopters. It is at once, a hope filled and hopeless scene, a picture of war itself.

While following the conventions of escape films; The Deer Hunter, Midnight Express; the list goes on, Rescue Dawn is grittier and less majestic in its adventurous tone, keeping it's cinematic drive not in the panorama of heroic nature, but in the vistas of exotic beauty in the Thailand jungles where the movie was filmed, which reveal a hostile environment of flood swollen rivers, determined blood sucking slugs, and impassable jungle terrain, and the starkness of the mundane and military place of freedom where the adventure began. The movie follows the book on escape films with POW's on the verge of mental breakdown, a bowl of live worms for breakfast, discourse among escapees, emotional freedom ringing conclusion, but it does it all so artfully, you are never reminded of the other great escapes. In Deiter, played by Christian Bale, we have not a disillusioned Vietnam soldier on the verge of living a lifelong nightmare, but of the quality John Wayne boasted, but without the bravura and impossible manhood.  You can picture him barbequing in his backyard with the wife and neighbors, leading a carefree life when the war is over.

The film ends without revealing the fate of Deiter's fellow prisoners which is upsetting. It also offers a lingering question which may suggest topical references to our current state of military affairs. There is a psyche-bizarre scene after a torture session where Deiter seems in compliance with his recent captors as they stand near a body of water filled with, what looked like minnow sized sharks. It is suggestive of the prisoners signing papers declaring America an evil imperialistic nation after an intense psychological torment, hence their confinement, as opposed to their demise.

I didn't know what to expect next. The way you think a typical Hollywood movie would follow is not what happens here. Plans don't go as intended, disasters unfold, and the good aren't always good and the bad aren't always bad.

This time around he dramatizes one of the greatest ever survivor's tales. Dengler was 18 when he left his home in Germany for the states with one mission in mind, to fly for the American military. On February 1, 1966 he took enemy fire and crash-landed his plane in Laos while on a secret mission. After surviving in the jungle on his own he was captured and tortured (hanging upside down with an ant nest around his neck, submerged in a well, dragged by an ox through a village), then taken to the Pathet Lao prison camp. There he met other POWS, then escaped after they overheard the guards say they planned to shoot them. The fellow POWS were separated after the escape, and Dengler and his buddy Duane Martin teamed up. Martin was eventually beheaded by villagers, but Dengler was rescued after improbably surviving the dense jungle.

This film may not show all of the horrible things which occurred to some POWs but it sure gives one the idea of how bad it was.

I never wanted to see us in Vietnam, but that doesn't mean I didn't respect the soldiers who were there. I wanted all of them to come home safely. I cried for those I knew who were severely injured or died.

This film is one of the most striking accounts I've ever seen about the war. I've heard horror stories from people I've known over the years who have talked about their tour(s) and this film shows how it must have been for those who had to endure prisons in the jungle. I'm not sure many POWs ever escaped from those camps, but Dieter certainly did.

As an aside, I just finished reading an account of the prisoners who were with Dieter in the prison camp. The real story is quite different than the one told in this film.

Christian Bale is a fighter pilot who crashes on his first mission and is captured by the Vietcong.  He leads the other, already interned POWs on a mission to escape the camp.  After escaping, there are some elements the movie doesn't explain well, IE: where the other men went and why only 2 remained together. It explains the 3rd man, but not the rest leaving.  This film is based on a true story and I think it did well telling that story.  Good film.",1500595200,,593,4.336363636363636

 I highly recommend the audiobook version of the said book. It is an amazing story  something this movie is said to be based on. However it leaves out the most critical parts and gets the rest very wrong.  The premise is only slightly similar to the book -the very things that make the book so amazing, beautiful and exciting are not to be found in the movie. Bale  is not effective in the lead role. He lacks the charisma and spirit of the person this movie is based on.  If you don't want to read the book then save yourself some time and just watch Missing In Action.",1474156800,,667,4.253968253968254

3218202,3,B000WMA6R8,"Christian Bale makes friends and enemies alike in a sparsely-populated den of POWs at the onset of the Vietnam war. Undergoing another major transformation for the role, Bale lost a ton of weight to sell his emaciation, but as he's decked out in a big, baggy flight suit for the duration it's often difficult to see his worsening condition. There's a strange mood that lingers around the fringes of this one, something to take us out of the moment. Maybe it's Bale's weirdly sunny disposition: even when he's being drug at gunpoint through the streets of a rough jungle village, he's smiling politely at the dumbstruck townsfolk. It could be the simple, businesslike way the prisoners plot and execute their escape, which seems a bit too easy. Even the relationships between the captives, carried out via hushed tones and late-night chats amidst shackles, have a floaty, dreamlike quality about them that doesn't fit the seemingly-horrible situation. As a picture it lacks conviction, that one moment for the audience to stand up and cheer, or even feel a sense of genuine tension about the cast's impending doom. I often felt removed from the action, as if I were reflecting upon it after the fact and glossing over the more grisly everyday challenges.",1466467200,,1253,4.943127962085308

The POW camp scenes were very realistic and at times, a little tough to take but that's what it was like for POWs. It reminds me of what Senator John McCain and others like him went through as POWs. The sets and scene locations for this film were just as real and of high cinematic value as the locations for other Vietnam genre films such as Apocalpyse Now and the Deer Hunter. The cast was great who played alongside Bale as fellow POWs as well as the small cadre of Vietcong captors.

I got an email from Amazon recommending Rescue Dawn starring Zach Grenier and I thought, hey that's interesting, I didn't know Grenier, who played David Lee on The Good Wife, starred in a Vietnam movie! So I clicked and clicked but couldn't find it, and then Searched and had to type the entire word Rescue plus a space before this picture showed up. And what did the listing say? This film, which I had seen twice, is written and directed by Werner Herzog and stars Christian Bale. Grenier has a very minor part. This is a very weak Herzog film. In fact I find it annoying primarily due to one of the characters. Bale doesn't have much to do and he doesn't do it very well.",1464652800,,756,4.446043165467626

3218612,4,B000WMA6R8,"I enjoyed this movie. Interesting spin on Vietnam movies, as it takes place very early in the war, before the massive American buildup. Loosely based on a true story, it is about an American Navy pilot who gets shot down over Laos and is captured. Without going into details and spoilers let me say Christian Bale turns in a very good performance. The movie is from 2007, so he had not peaked yet in his acting abilities, but nonetheless does well. The supporting cast is also very good. Filmed entirely on location in Thailand, the movies gives a very good depiction of what a Southeast Asian jungle is really like. Some scenes will be noted by the squeamish. For those interested in history/war movies, I'd recommend this.",1462752000,,724,4.708661417322834

The way they make the prisoners out to be a bit crazy and went way overboard on how they acted as captives is appalling. I could not finish watching this movie. It angered me to watch. The director should be captured and tortured for his horrible take on what these men went through. Don't waste your money and please don't allow this kind director believe he can take such a horrific part of someone's life and s*** on its memory. The family and friends of the men involved in this are horrified by how it has been portrayed.

3218967,3,B000WMA6R8,"Enjoyed what i could. Maybe there should be more detail about how they survived in the jungle. Being familiar with wilderness survival there is various strategies for finding and managing food and hunger. I found it unbelievable to find their way at night. it may work in open country but  it must be too dark to move in the jungle at night. His tactical way of moving under cover looked real. Concealment is a very important factor in escape and evasion. Doing things like standing on a rock and setting the hut on fire to draw attention of aircraft may seem like a good thing to do but it will also draw the enemy that is hunting you. some of the guards seemed lax and not the characteristic of a good soldier especially under the conditions they were under. From what i heard the Viet Cong were very tough warriors. i cannot understand how they could leave their weapons unattended while guarding prisoners One of the first lessons learned in Army Basic.

Whispering may be realistic while in confinement but it makes it hard to hear and understand what is being said. this seems to be a major problem with Amazon movies and i will continue to rate good movies low until it has been fixed if it can.

I never was eligible for Viet Nam and the draft ended as soon as i graduated from high school. I never really did see a real war (wished i had but praise God i never did). I can still watch war movies without having relapses. i have no memories to manage.

3219058,4,B000WMA6R8,Good flick based on real events.,1446854400,,32,4.5
3219059,4,B000WMA6R8,"Released in late 2006-2007, ""Rescue Dawn"" is based on the true story of German-American Dieter Dengler (Christian Bale) who was shot down in February, 1966, during a Vietnam bombing mission. He was held in a Laotian prison camp with several other prisoners, including Duane Martin and Gene DeBruin (Steve Zahn and Jeremy Davies), before attempting to escape the following Summer.

Directed by the famous German auteur, Werner Herzog, known for cult hits like 1972s Aguirre, the Wrath of God and 1982s Fitzcarraldo, Rescue Dawn has a somewhat artsy air compared to more conventional Vietnam War flicks, like 1986 Platoon and 1989s Casualties of War, which isn't to say its a better viewing experience than ""Platoon,"" but it's about as good as the other one. In any case, it lacked the mega-budget of those blockbusters. It was shot in the jungles of Thailand in 44 days and things got ugly when the producer couldn't pay the crew for lack of funds.

Ill be honest with you, during the first hour I was taken aback by what struck me as bad acting on Bales part, like his smiling and comedic words at the absolute wrong time. It just didn't ring true, but then I saw that it was intentional, particularly after watching the Making Of featurettes on the DVD, which show that Dieter was a weirdly obsessed guy who absolutely refused to give up. It was his nave-yet-unshakable optimism and iron-will that got him out of his jungle hell. The director would know more about the real Dengler since he made a documentary of his POW travails in 1997, Little Dieter Needs to Fly. After watching clips from that film you'll realize that Bales performance isn't far from the truth. Dieter always had this perpetual smile and weird sense of humor that either annoyed people or endeared them. So the performance is SUPPOSED to be eccentric. Besides, there's more than a hint of black comedy in the movie because the situation for American POWs was nigh surrealistically absurd.

The movie has been severely criticized by members of the families of Gene DeBruin and Phisit Intharathat, the latter being the only other survivor of the group, a Thai. Herzog acknowledged that DeBruin acted heroically during his imprisonment, refusing to leave while some sick prisoners remained, but claimed to be unaware of this until after the film had been completed. He said that this angle wouldve probably been included in the story had he learned it earlier. However, the DeBruin family said that Herzog was not interested in speaking with them prior to the film being completed. For me personally, I didn't think Debruin was portrayed THAT badly. The way hes depicted is simply the result of his being incarcerated in a primitive jungle prison for two years BEFORE Dengler arrived. The latter was only there for five months before attempting to escape.

A critic referred to Rescue Dawn as One Flew Over the Bamboo Hut on the grounds that its essentially a war version of 1975s ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."" Like that movie, Rescue Dawn depicts a group of average men who were a little off BEFORE undergoing involuntary imprisonment. While Dieter (Bale) refuses to be locked down and is constantly trying to keep his mental skills sharp through humor and plotting, some of the other POWs are increasingly becoming lost in their own minds, which then sets up its own impenetrable walls. The fact that Rescue Dawn is based on a true story where the ending is known doesn't prevent it from being a quality jungle survival drama. Please take note because this isn't a war action film, although theres some of that; its a survival drama. In any case, unlike One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest where the protagonist flew over the cuckoo's nest and disappeared forever, this movie offers hope. One flew over the bamboo hut, fell in for a while, but makes it out!

The film runs 120 minutes.

It's the only film I've seen where it deals with a pilot being shot down while flying a mission in the Vietnam conflict, being captured and put in a POW camp and then escaping from the camp.  I imagine there have been other similar movies made but I haven't seen them.  It was a pretty small camp with only 6 prisoners and it made me wonder just how many other small camps existed like this in Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos for captured Americans.",1430352000,,605,4.2894736842105265

3219477,4,B000WMA6R8,"Dieter Dengler's amazing story of escape from a brutal Laos prison camp.  Filmed on location in Thailand.  In movie fiction, Rambo would have single-handedly fashioned crossbow-launched RPG's, destroyed the entire prison and the Pathet Lao force, and led all his fellow prisoners to safetly.

Dengler doesn't do any of that (though he does, satisifyingly manage to mow down the prison guards with their own weapons.  This is, after all,  a TRUE story, and a remarkable one.  Without Dengler's dogged determination to survive, he and his fellow prisoners would all have disappeared off the earth.

3219485,3,B000WMA6R8,"A movie based on actual events....  but the script was weak and choppy, making it difficult for me to establish a time frame/timeline as the movie ran its course.  This may have been a result of a less-than clear timeline in the actual veteran's memory and the script did little to fill it in.  This was not a movie that kept me engaged through action or terrific lead acting, although the two main supporting actors fleshed their characters out quite well.  I remained engaged because the trailer intrigued me when it mentioned that the jungle proved more dangerous than being held in a POW camp but the trailer over-promised and under-delivered.  This was a forgettable movie that I will not remember the title for in six weeks.",1428278400,,730,4.716535433070866

3219762,5,B000WMA6R8,"Director Werner Herzog's RESCUE DAWN is an incredible tale of survival and the will to live. Christian Bale's performance as German-born Dieter Dengler is totally enigmatic, mesmerizing and captivating. Dengler is a Navy pilot during the Vietnam War. On a classified mission he is down over Laos and captured. Bale's performance is so aloof and curious, but is always singularly focused on escape. He may escape confinement by his captors, but the green dense jungle proves to be even more confining than can be imagined. Christian Bale's performance remains focused, but his determination is challenged time and time again. This is an interesting film based on true events. It holds your interest throughout. I love the finale even though it was criticized, but in reality its almost surrealistic and humorous feel, puts the film's entire narrative in perspective and makes it so thought provoking.",1424390400,,899,5.25

Christian Bale plays Dieter Dengler an Air Force pilot shoot down and captured in Loas during the very early stages of the American involvement in Vietnam.  Bale is awesome as the captured airman.  He shows pride, courage and a source spirit that had been missing in the hellhole of a prison camp where they were incarcerated.

Rescue Dawn is a story of hope and desperation, friendship and loss.  Bale and company do justice to what was a horrible thing.

Jeremy Davies is absolutely superb as Gene, the starving inmate with hope.  Steve Zahn plays Duane, an inmate on the brink of breaking down and losing all his marbles.",1421539200,,746,4.598484848484849

3220044,4,B000WMA6R8,"Christian Bale leads a team of co-stars who turned in, for this particular veteran, a very realistic (both historically and visually) rendition of combat, survival, escape, resistance, and evasion.
Bale plays the lead role as US Navy Lieutenant Dieter Dengler. Dengler was a pilot who flew clandestine combat bombing missions against Communist forces in Laos during the years preceding major combat operations in Vietnam.  In his first combat mission, Dengler's plane sustains anti-aircraft damage resulting in a crash landing.  He evades capture for a few days, but is eventually caught and turned over to the VC who ultimately transfer him to a POW camp in Laos.
While in the camp he meets fellow POWs and begins to develop a plan to escape.
This review does not intend to provide a full recap of the film; rather, it will serve to inform the potential viewer that this author found the movie entertaining, evocative, humorous, and most importantly (for me) a realistic depiction of some of the ways humans respond to whatever life throws at them.",1419292800,,1049,5.022988505747127

Thought the movie was good, but after watching the documentry 'Little Dieter Needs to Fly' we were disappointed that  the movie did not depict many situations that Dengler lived through and what a man can endure when captive in a hostal enviroment. This could be due to the PG-13 rating. It was just another Hollywood movie. A couple scenes held your attention but otherwise not edge of your seat.

You have to admire the cast of characters, what they had to put up with-including each other-both good and bad.

3220920,4,B000WMA6R8,"Excellent movie about the 1966 escape from Laos by downed US airman Dieter Dengler (played by Christian Bale).  ""Rescue Dawn"" is a gritty examination of the role will, ingenuity and patience plays in the decision to escape from a group of malevolent captors.  The performances are uniformly solid, led by Jeremy Davies and Steve Zahn, with Christian Bale playing a somewhat unsympathetic lead. Particularly notable was the brotherly, tethered relationship between Bale and Zahn. IT was both touching and real and gave the film much of its emotional underpinning.  The location shooting in Thailand was spectacular and gave you a sense of actually being present in the stifling and oppressive jungle conditions.

The climactic 15 minutes were disappointing in that a movie so full of nuance and subtlety was quickly brought to an exaggerated and overblown conclusion.  Maybe it truly happened that way, but even a movie based on real life events deviates somewhat.

Regardless, a very uplifting story of the courage to overcome terrific odds.",1415750400,,1041,5.240963855421687

It was carefully representative of the facts, but unlike most Hollywood movies, he did not glamorize or hype up the events.  In that it was believable.  The central figure was clearly a leader, and made it home because of his perseverance, and unlike the other prisoners, he only was in forced imprisonment for months, rather than years.

The story ramps up quickly with Christian Bale, as real life Dieter Dengler, crash lands in Laos and is captured by what appear to be the NVA and a ragtag band of local villagers with weapons. What follows is his transport to a small POW camp with only six other prisoners who had been there one and a half years, minimum.

The story tells more than the hardships of the camp, the ruthlessness of some of the guards, and digs into the psychological erosion that happens to people enduring those conditions. One of the characters actually looked eerily like a young Charles Manson but I'm not sure whether that was intentional. Regardless, for me, it underscored the psychological drama being played out.

In sum, this is a very fine, but not great, film that tells a story we've seen before, think Great Escape with a lot fewer players and a lot more jungle, from a slightly different angle.

3221229,4,B000WMA6R8,"This is difficult to review because the movie itself is so depressing and discouraging to me as a decorated soldier myself and the film points out clearly the courage and strength of some of our soldiers. What it also shows is that most of this country today couldn't care less about what we did but instead they just TAKE the good from our sacrifices and do NOTHING for anyone else but themselves and don't give a soldier one second of thought much less be grateful to them.
The acting in this film is beyond just good.....it could get nominations for awards it's so powerful but I love acting as much as the film usually so I pay attention to that and can't watch many of the films put out today by some stars because they can't act at all. I won't mention Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt here either but Christian Bail just delivers one great performance here.
To add to the films credits it's also based on a true story so that just makes this film unbelievable to me.
NOT FOR KIDS or the sensitive at all and it did me no good either except for seeing what good direction and great acting is like once more. It's a 5-star movie I took one away from because it is so depressing and down but other than that, it's one great incite into some of our soldiers lives and what they gave.",1413936000,,1277,4.2809917355371905

3221264,4,B000WMA6R8,"An Excellent film.  Herzog is such a brilliant director.  Christian Bale and Steve Zahn give superb performances. Unfortunately, I have not liked Bale's latter roles, which is a shame because he is such a fine actor. I am so sick of comic book films, especially Batman.  The last two films with Christian Bale I like are this movie and ""The Prestige"".  I thought ""American Hustle"" was very underwhelming.  I couldn't make it through the whole movie.

He does have a couple of new films coming out that look promising, so do not think I am writing Bale off; he is too good.",1413763200,,572,4.5588235294117645

3221300,5,B000WMA6R8,"This is a great movie! The realism is unnerving at times, but to know what our POWs went through in Vietnam was an eye-opening experience. This man's life story on film is truly extraordinary.",1413676800,,192,4.676470588235294

3221306,5,B000WMA6R8,"This is my kind of movie. Lots of adventure and worry of if he will make this alive. The man is a Navel Officer Pilot and is flying a mission into VC Territory when he gets shot down and I won't spoil it but I was sitting on the edge of my chair waiting the outcome of this officer. Ok, so I give it a 5 because in my opinion it very good war story, and a true account of someone's life in war.",1413676800,,394,3.7023809523809526

3221339,4,B000WMA6R8,"This struck me as a realistic portrayal of what it must be like to be a POW in a wholly different culture from our own.  It's hard to believe that someone could actually live through the constant torture and abuse, but many POW's have managed to survive, so this movie appears to be based on ""real life.""",1413676800,,304,4.333333333333333

3221369,5,B000WMA6R8,"Looking for ""Missing In Action"" or ""Delta Force"" or ""Commando"" shoot 'em up action flicks? Look elsewhere. This is all about REAL POWS, real history, with real actors. Real escape, real daring, real suffering.
The movie is worth at least 4 stars. The hero, the POWs are worth all 5 stars.
Even so the movie does not try too hard to portray the genuine sadism the POWS usually had to endure it seemed to me. There is a bit of it. Maybe it has become politically incorrect to dwell on that, I dunno.
One thing I do know is that was one tough dude, a real survivor.",1413417600,,562,4.261682242990654

3221441,3,B000WMA6R8,"Christian Bale makes friends and enemies alike in a sparsely-populated den of POWs at the onset of the Vietnam war. Undergoing another major transformation for the role, Bale lost a ton of weight to sell his emaciation, but as he's decked out in a big, baggy flight suit for the duration it's often difficult to see his worsening condition. There's a strange mood that lingers around the fringes of this one, something to take us out of the moment. Maybe it's Bale's weirdly sunny disposition: even when he's being drug at gunpoint through the streets of a rough jungle village, he's smiling politely at the dumbstruck townsfolk. It could be the simple, businesslike way the prisoners plot and execute their escape, which seems a bit too easy. Even the relationships between the captives, carried out via hushed tones and late-night chats amidst shackles, have a floaty, dreamlike quality about them that doesn't fit the seemingly-horrible situation. As a picture it lacks conviction, that one moment for the audience to stand up and cheer, or even feel a sense of genuine tension about the cast's impending doom. I often felt removed from the action, as if I were reflecting upon it after the fact and glossing over the more grisly everyday challenges. It's nicely shot, with a genuine appreciation for the area's unique terrain and the helpless fury of its residents at a looming US intervention, but the story itself never moved me like I felt it should.",1405296000,,1457,4.902834008097166

I was so impressed by the movie which unfortunately Dieter did not live long enough to see. I think he would have been impressed with Christian Bale and other actors.

Scenes of extreme torture are left out of this movies - only references are made to that. This movie concentrates on character development and really, the best part about this movie is the acting done by all the characters. I had some issues with moving through the bushes and NOT using the machete to get through. Why have it if you won't use it? Then Bale, the lead character, catches a snake and proceeds to eat it. Yet, again, having a machete, why not take off the head first? Just small details like that bother me a bit.

What I did watch twice was from the point where the spotter plane sees him and comes back around for another look and then the helicopters come in to get him! At last!! All I could think of was how I would have felt by then!! I really loved the ending. I won't say more on that part.

The plot was a bit off, along with those nagging little details that bothered me so that's why I gave it four stars. Acting is great by everybody involved - Bale always gets really into his characters. So did the other prisoners too.

A piece of history of that war kept silent for some time, mainly because we weren't supposed to be there in Laos. The sad part is wondering who got left behind and is anyone still there?",1390003200,,1368,4.274131274131274
3221454,4,B000WMA6R8,Rescue Dawn is the movie version of the Dieter Dengler story. The movie pretty much follows the Dieter Dengler documentary.

The movie's end give the viewer a good feeling especially with the rescue and celebration in the carrier hanger bay.

The Vietnamese or Laotians were on the whole portrayed as vicious killers ""anti Yankee""-for no good cause, despite the opening sequence of the American strafing of Laotian countryside with huts blown apart in moody pyrotechnics. And the dialogue noting the Americans had no justifiable reason to be in Laos attacking Laotians. Dieter Dengler appeared by the end of the film to have learned nothing from incarceration, escape or seeing his friend violently killed so close to being rescued. In my view, not a classic wartime drama. Just another good old boy doing his duty kind of film. The ending was sick. So, a beautifully shot film, some good images (including a raft shot straight out of Aguirre Scourge of God) and lines of dialogue but stereotypical in the telling of the story of a side bar of the Vietnam War and trite.

3221463,5,B000WMA6R8,"A great film for the action-adventure crowd, especially because it is true and very close to the actual events of Dieter Dengler's shoot-down and captivity. It also is very well shot in the jungles of Thailand, jungles very similar to Laos and northern South Vietnam.

As Christian Bale says, the actors didn't try to imitate the real life characters, they just based their performances on the characters without trying to copy their speech inflections and mannerisms. This is a truly great film from the point of view of someone who has been there and knows the terrain of the triple canopy jungle in that deadly area of NW South Vietnam and SE Laos. That it has a happy ending is simply an accident of events and the good fortune of one person.

Dieter Dengler should have been a national hero, with his name on the lips of everyone in the USA. That would have happened if he hadn't been flying in the wrong war at at the wrong time. LBJ and the CIA were conducting a totally illegal black war in Laos and the men who were shot down mostly paid the ultimate price for having been there.

But this actually works in its favor, giving it a gritty and real feel. Christian Bale continues to amaze, not only is this role wildly different from Batman, but he inhabits it so well, that you pretty much forget it is Bale or you think this must be the ""real"" Bale.

The story itself is incredibly compelling. Brutal, real, sad, inspiring. All of that. The more so because it is apparently mostly true (I gather that there are some descendants of some of the secondary characters who dispute some of the movie's accuracy).

The movie isn't long, but you feel like you have been through the ringer. Never boring, the movie paces itself remarkably well, alternately showing the painful slow passage of time and then with the anxious desperation of events that quicken the pace.

3221486,3,B000WMA6R8,"Am a fan of Christian Bale. His performances are often sublime, fascinating and like him or not - almost always engaging. Reconnected with the actor over the past decade or so having last seen him as a young boy in '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Empire-of-the-Sun/dp/B007KW5N9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Empire of the Sun</a>'. Admittedly stunned at the skilled actor he had become while screening '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Machinist/dp/B001U0HAZM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Machinist</a>'. Just one of many excellent, even amazing, performances.

However, this isn't one of them.

It took me a while to verbalize what I couldn't put a finger to at the time. A recent second screening allowed me to note the issues I have with this production.

Firstly, this felt and played like a television movie, with the accompanying cheesy effects, pedestrian screenplay and lazy cinematography. The sets, while undoubtedly close to authentic, filmed cheap; too many scenes looking like they were done in a climate controlled sound stage.

Add to the list of mishandled opportunities: Underutilizing the natural locale; not providing us the scale of the escape. It must have seemed like an insane plan to the desperate prisoners. But because Director Werner Herzog doesn't give us the immensity of the journey, according to the maps of Laos and Thailand I scoped before writing this review, the critical moment comes off as very local; as if freedom was merely over a mountain range. The scale, so important for us to feel and understand the massive undertaking of the escape, is never properly defined, hollowing the drama considerably.

Additionally, and it's something I've never seen Bale do - overact. Not in every single scene, but at times. And it's embarrassing given his immense skill set and ability. Again, one can solely lay this at the feet of Director Herzog. Unsurprisingly,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/his-next-mainstream-directorial-effort-bombed/dp/B002TVQ48K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">his next mainstream directorial effort bombed</a>. I'm unfamiliar with his German productions so perhaps this is reflection of a lost-in-translation situation. Historically, some European and Asian directors can't segue into US mediums. That or he's just a so-so director. I like to give him the benefit of the doubt.

In fact, I think it's fair to call this Christian's weakest career performance, even though that's still generally better than most of his peers. And made more apparent given that that list includes running around as a costumed comic book character.

My harshest criticism is directed at the ending of the movie - ack - trite. An insincere finish and one that I despised given how little effort went into correctly training the actors to look and move as Naval personnel. The worst? The person who played the emcee - blatantly not an actor and apparently some buffoonish relation to one of the producers. How about a steak? No, how getting a professional performer in there Herzog? Astounding horrid closure to a mishandled project. A disservice to the memories of the men whose lives this movie is based on.

My only compliment is for Steven Zahn. Very high marks - one of the few performances that rang completely true. To date, the finest performance of the surprisingly versatile character actor I've screened. Sadly, his outstanding execution is utterly lost in this mediocre product.

Ultimately, this movie has the basic elements to showcase an incredible journey of survival and the endurance of the human spirit - but fails to capitalize on the talent and core basic elements at hand. To see how this could have been done, I suggest screening '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Way-Back/dp/B004C45AX2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Way Back</a>' which utilizes similar content, but producing vastly superior results. Also consider watching '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gulag/dp/6303425577/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gulag</a>' from 1985. A stunning cable film that revealed the horrors of the communist ""justice"" system. Unfortunately, this is one of the many lost HBO movies, and therefore only available in the VHS format.

I'm torn as to where the line should be drawn. And yet another case for the Amazon half-star.

Call it a high three for Zahn's outstanding effort alone.

Movie Note: In doing research for the real story that formed the basis of the screenplay, I was surprised to learn how much Herzog had omitted, contrived and fabricated. Gene DeBruin, the character played by actor Jeremy Davies, was at the very least slandered. And at the very worst, defamed. If you're interested in hearing the other side - search for the website dedicated to Gene's memory. Quite a different tale told by survivors and witnesses.",1343865600,,4974,5.789329685362517

Werner Herzog's movies can at times be way too intense to get through but they are worth the journey. This role of Dirk Diggler (oops, real life war hero Dieter Dengler, I meant) also proves Christian Bale is the best actor on the planet period (sorry, Deppster and Leonardo).

You can read the synopsis elsewhere so I won't spoil it but the casting was spot on and the cinematography is superb esp. from the opening bombing raid
sequence through to when Bale gets captured.

Also, fans of the TV series ""Lost"" watch for the Darma Intiative's boss in a bit part and Faraday as the yin to Bale's yang in the POW camp.

The extras are well worth the price of the DVD as you get about 45 minutes of how the actors got that POW look, how Herzog threw himself into the task, how the jungle is truly a ""character"" in the movie and the true story of how the real Dieter Dengler shows how an optimistic outlook on life can truly be lifesaving.

Dieter Dengler's life and his particular experience in Vietnam was truly compelling enough without Herzog's fictional bungling...actually slanderous bungling! (Lord, I'm going to be using a lot of exclamation points here!)

Herzog's portrayal of fellow captive Eugene Debruin as a coward and quasi-traitor is ludicrous! On the contrary, this man stayed behind after the prison break to tend to another severely sick and incapacitated inmate. He sacrificed his only chance at freedom and was likely executed for his unselfish heroism. Why did Herzog have to make him out as a coward? To add to the drama? I don't get it. Even Dengler in the books ""Little Dieter Needs to Fly"" and ""Hero Found"" acknowledged Debruin's sacrifice. Eugene's family is justly outraged.

Other than that glaring twist of the facts, it is a pretty good action movie. Bale gives a very good performance. At least Herzog didn't place some fictional native love interest in the movie as most of the ""Based On A Real Story"" movies do.",1317686400,,1175,4.894472361809045

3221492,3,B000WMA6R8,"Rescue Dawn may distort history, but for a Hollywood production it has more than moments which do not.  And the odds are it's been appreciated over the last half-decade for exactly that reason by Americans knowledgeable about the Vietnam War.

The movie stars Christian Bale and Steve Zahn as American warriors captured in Laos or northwestern South Vietnam in 1965, when according to the movie's pre-narrative, ""few Americans thought the Vietnam War would become an all out war.""  I must have been one of those few, because I knew President Lyndon Johnson was fully committed to America's long-dead South Vietnamese puppet Diem's refusal to honor the Geneva Accords; and I sensed that America's buildup for (if not the actuality of) the bombing of North Vietnam, Operation Rolling Thunder, had begun.

The movie's first scenes take place aboard the U.S.S. Hornet (having survived WW II with laurels), in the Gulf of Tonkin, and the most cracking-wise loudmouth among the officer-pilots is a man with the soon-to-become-notorious moniker ""Spook.""

A Navy pilot, Bale is shot down by ground fire on his first bombing mission from the Hornet across South Vietnam.  At the time, America's attacks on Laos to interdict Viet Cong supply lines into South Vietnam were well-guarded CIA secrets, and kept out of America's big media; after all, Laos was a separate country bordering on South Vietnam, a member of the United Nations and presumably protected from American aggression by Article 4 of the U.N. Charter.

Bale and Zahn meet soon after Bale is shot down, in captivity in Laos (the DVD's blurb says the POW camp is in northwestern South Vietnam, but Zahn says he thinks it's in Laos), and in less than a year they escape down a tributary to the Mekong River.  The escape is reminiscent of The African Queen (regarding leaches among other things), while before the escape the POW camp scenes were reminiscent of The Bridge on the River Quai (regarding POW in-fighting and the ""impenetrable forest"" being the POW camp's walls).

But what impressed me most about Rescue Dawn were not its war and POW camp scenes, which occupy probably 98% of the movie's running time, but two after-Bale's-return-to-safety scenes.  There is first, Bale's hospitalization, rest, and recovery -- interrupted by his interrogation by two laughably sinister men in black suits from the CIA.  And then, this CIA interrogation is interrupted by several of Bale's shipmates, who clandestinely whisk him away from the hospital and the CIA clowns and return him to the Hornet.  Once back on his ship, Bale is honored by all hands for his extraordinary courage and escape from captivity, but more like the hero who scored a high-school football team's conference-winning points than like a Navy pilot and officer.  And at one point, the chubby master of ceremonies for Bale's shipboard reception says loudly to him: ""You MUST believe in something.""  Nailing it for 21st century moviegoers, Bale replies with his school boy's modest grin: ""I believe I could use a good steak.""

And these two completely impossible scenes brought home to me just how unlike Vietnam are America's apparently unstoppable wars in 2011; how de-institutionalized is military heroism today; and how most Americans only tolerate our soldiers like they tolerate Wall Street Billionaires and the inmates of our prisons -- if they remain nameless and faceless.  Yes.  Goddamit.  And how the very little in the larger scheme of things that was positive about soldier-ing in 1965 is gone, truly gone now the way of all flesh.",1313798400,,3564,5.052901023890785

Although it is suppose to be based on a true story, the director Werner Hertzog has embellished the exploits of fellow German Dieter Dengler and in doing so has sullied the names of others who were in the prison.

Two observations: One, in the Commentary on the deleted scenes Mr. Hertzog mentions several times the Lao peasants that played some of the roles.  It is infuriating to hear an educated person who can use people and call them peasants.  The lao people are some of the kindest and honest people I have had the chance to meet.  The people may be poor and they may lack formal education but they are survivors and deserve respect.

Two, One of the deleted scenes shows a farmer giving rice to Dieter and asking Dieter for his ring.  I doubt it would have happened that way.  The farmer would have give the rice to make merit and not for an earthly reward or there was an offer of a trade that Dieter tried to get out of after the fact.  In an earlier part of the movie Dieter was disappointed that he only got one day in Saigon to frolic with the go go girls and hookers yet, he make a big deal about his finacees ring.  I bet he had less of an attachment to the ring then the farmer had to his finger.

Three, Some of the people in Laos are very poor, any of the food they gave the prisoners would likely have graced the guards table as well. Seeing the prisoners eat mealy worms or bug larva is just day to day living for some people.",1307491200,,1588,4.239202657807309

Christian Bale is the main character, Dieter Dengler, a pilot in the Navy who gets shot down and is taken to a POW camp in Laos.  Along the way, Bale's character encounters two other very gifted actors.  First is Steve Zahn, who everyone thinks of as a comedic actor.  But in Rescue Dawn, he shows tremendous dramatic depth and is is enjoyable to watch him in this role.  The other great actor is Jeremy Davies. If you're a fan of the TV show Lost, you know him as Daniel Faraday (and it takes a few minutes to get used to seeing him in another role).  Together, the performances of these fine actors make the movie worthwhile.

3221504,5,B000WMA6R8,"This is one of the best films I've seen for a while as it was very thought provoking and afterwards I wanted to know much more about the actual people the events were based around.  I found this film a highly realistic portrayal of the experiences of those unfortunate POW's in their years of captivity in the jungle, far from home, with little or no prospect of rescue, the interaction with other prisoners being the only thing that kept them alive. I felt the key characters were portrayed in a way that made the viewer feel in their position.  What a terrible reality they were suffering, trying to survive day by day, and being shackled like caged animals by cruel captors, living in their own excrement and facing death daily. I found this film made as big an impact on me as I had felt watching The Deer Hunter, and the reason being the sheer horror of the reality of these people's lives and the futility of their situation.

Whilst I appreciate the family of Eugene Debruin do not feel the character was accurate, I none the less found the portrayal facinating, as THIS person (Eugene) had suffered for over two years before the film's main character appears (Dengler), and the Director does a good job in showing Eugene's suffering and his state of mind that must have been close to the truth of a person in his situation at that time, even if not the actual truth of Debruin himself. I think the character of Eugene shouldn't be taken too literally, and he represents a victim of prolonged incarceration and what is really heartbreaking is that he doesn't appear to survive at the end of the movie.  If he is shown as confused or resigned, then if not this exact character in the movie then there would have been hundreds or thousands like him, so I did not interpret the character as being necessarily accurate in precise detail, but the portrayal evokes strong emotions of the hopelessness that must have been felt.  The actor Jeremy Davies, did a truly excellent job in the role, not necessarily of the real Eugene, but of the type of long suffering, despairing and resigned POW.

Steve Zahn is incredible as the doomed Duane Martin, fighting for survival, pitiful, incredibly weakened yet somehow surviving weeks on the run in the jungle only to meet the most shocking and horrendous end. By this time the viewer is numbed by the horror that his extremly weak friend witnesses. Regards this friend, and the main character, Dengler, he is portrayed ultimately as the hero not least as he is the only American who actually survives the terrible ordeal and lives to tell the tale, and so this is his story, and Christian Bale is superb in the role. You feel his ordeal every heartaching minute and the outcome is a miracle. There are no clues as to how it will all end for the characters, as they are in an impossible situation from the outset. The fact that there are any survivors at all makes it a story worth telling.

Werner Herzog crafted an incredible film from Dieter Denglers story of survival, making it an historical yet painful tale, which leaves you aching with worry for those that didn't make it out and are still listed as Missing In Action to this day.  Its not a war movie and yet war creates the background to the story.  It is a movie of survival against impossible odds, and the tragic deaths of so many who died in the jungle whose final stories will never be known and who in time will be forgotten. This film helps us remember the brave attempts at survival of Dieter Dengler, Duane Martin, Eugene Debruin, their friends, and thousands of other POW's.

Bale is fine as stoic figures like Batman, but when asked to show real emotional depth, as here, he comes up empty. Even his American accent fails at times; it's not hard to hear that this is not his native dialect, which takes away a lot of the realism. All told, I was rather disappointed with this movie. I like some of Herzog's work, especially Aguirre, but something about this one just didn't move me. True story or not, it felt forced and far too film-like.

I kept thinking about Papillon, and how touching that movie was, and how I just wasn't feeling much for any of these characters. It gets better as it goes, but the opening seemed very staged and fake, especially the scene where Spook is cracking wise about the training films. He wasn't very funny, but everyone kept laughing their phony laughs, and it detracted from any sense of reality. It also felt like Herzog didn't really know how to make the ship life seem authentic; he's much better directing a couple guys in the jungle than a group of people in normal life. Maybe that's because he knows this isn't really a true story.

A little research reveals Herzog's dishonest and self-serving lies about Eugene Debruin's actions in the camp, and Dengler's feats in general. Herzog makes Gene look like a villain and an idiot, while those who were there say it was just the opposite; Dengler did very little of what he's given credit for here: engineering the breakout, etc. But of course this is Werner's second movie about his little hero Dengler, whom he seems to think will bring credit to all Germans if Herzog can just make up enough lies about his ""heroic"" actions. Instead, it just makes me respect Herzog less, as a director and a German (I enjoy German culture in general, so spare me the polemics). If you really love this film, do some research and see what the real story is. It ain't what we're fed here.

It looks good on blu-ray, and my favorite thing about the movie was the excellent score, which heightened the proceedings immensely. But I had to agree with my girlfriend when she said, ""This just isn't that interesting."" Somehow, this exciting ""true"" tale felt like a Hollywood film in many of the worst ways, especially the occasional weirdly jingoistic moments.

This is the story of an American pilot shot down over Laos early in the war before it was common knowledge that the USA was bombing in Laos. This is a tough, gritty, hard movie.

The movie was well created with realistic settings (mostly filmed in Thailand). Yes, I do recommend this movie, but, make sure you are ready for a 2+ hour heavy war movie.

3221510,5,B000WMA6R8,"I can't remember the last time I actually found a movie worth seeing in a theatre. I did not see this film in a theatre, but I wish I had!

I first heard of Dieter Dengler from the Guidebook For Marines. His story is mentioned in the Code Of Conduct chapter, as an example of how an American fighting-man should conduct himself as a P.O.W.

As a Naval aviator during the Vietnam War, he served aboard the aircraft-carrier  U.S.S. Ranger. Dengler flew an AD Skyraider, a prop-plane designed for close air-support and reconaissance. Assigned to fly a secret mission to bombard targets in Laos, Dengler was shot down, and manged to evade capture for some time.

Captured by Pathet Lao guerrillas, he was brutally beaten, and eventually interned in a small P.O.W. camp with two other Americans and a small group of Thais. All of the others were personnel employed by Air America, except for Duane Martin, who was an Air Force pilot.

Having no intention of staying in this prison, Dengler improvised a number of tools for an escape attempt. He eventually mobilized the others into making an ingenious escape effort. When the time came, Dengler killed the guards with their own weapons. Dengler and Martin set out together, into the jungle, toiling through dense foliage, mud, incessant rain, illness ...and afflicted by such jungle-pests as leeches and insects. Sadly, Martin was later murdered by a Lao farmer. Dengler survived for 23 days in a hostile environment, hunted by Pathet Lao soldiers, before he was eventually rescued by an Air Force helicopter crew.

This movie is a fine portrayal of Dengler's impressive and relentless will to survive.

I do not know where the film was shot, but some truly incredible mountain and jungle landscape is featured throughout.

Sadly, Mr. Dengler is no longer with us. Afflicted with ALS, he passed away on 7 February, 2001.

Mr. Dengler was born in Germany, and witnessed World War II as a child, as Allied forces invaded in 1945. Watching the exploits of Allied fighter-pilots inspired him to become a pilot. As a teenager, he was apprenticed as a machinist, and saved his money to emmigrate to America. At age 18, he sailed to the U.S., and survived on the streets for a short time, before enlisting in the Air Force in 1957, where he  served as a gunsmith.
Dengler took the test for aviation late in his enlistment, and passed. However, his enlistment was soon completed, before he could enroll in the program, and he moved to California to attend college. He was accepted into the Navy cadet Program, and was soon commissioned. He originally trained as a Skyraider pilot, but was trained to fly jet-aircraft after his P.O.W. ordeal. After his time in the Navy, Dengler was employed as a test-pilot for TWA.

Another point of interest regarding Mr. Dengler:
While attending S.E.R.E. school, Dengler escaped the simulated P.O.W. camp THREE TIMES, ...and was the only student in his group to actually GAIN weight!",1256774400,,2956,4.856858846918489

Not trying to disrespect Christian Bale, (I've recently seen him in 3:10 to Yuma and thought he did some pretty good acting there.) but sometimes I think people find out that some guy is supposed to be one of the best actors out there, and all of a sudden they are afraid to give any negative criticism about the guy's acting in anything because they might look like they don't know what they are talking about.  This movie drags and some of the acting is just flat out pathetic.  If you want to see a movie because Christian Bale is in it, don't make it this one.",1251763200,,1505,4.309608540925267

3221514,5,B000WMA6R8,"Another war movie, however, this one is a little bit different from all the other ones.  Instead of focusing on constant shooting action, strategies involving taking out the enemies, and other things you'd expect in a war movie, this one focuses LESS on action, and more on the Americans escaping from a Vietnamese prison during the war.

Do they eventually escape?  Well, you probably know the answer to that one.  But the film actually does a good job focusing on the Vietnamese, and the way they went about their lives during the war.

The place the captured Americans were held wasn't exactly the worst place in the world, perhaps the prisons in Vietnam weren't really that bad, or maybe the films developers just didn't do a good enough job showing what those prisons were REALLY like, I don't know the answer to that one.

I just know Rescue Dawn was a good movie because you kept pulling for the Americans to get out of jail, find a clear exit, and hope the helicopters eventually arrive.

I'm reluctant to reveal TOO much more about this movie because war films don't usually vary much with each one, so I don't want to spoil what little surprises this film features that you haven't seen before.

3221515,5,B000WMA6R8,"I was disturbed to learn, after seeing and admiring Werner Herzog's ""Rescue Dawn,"" that the surviving families of Dieter Dengler and other Vietnam-era POWs depicted in the film accuse Herzog of lying outright about these men and their histories. In particular, they say he desecrates the memory of Gene DeBruin, a far more positive, courageous  and altruistic man in real life than as portrayed by Jeremy Davies in the film. In the DVD commentary, Herzog said he wished he had known the additional information about DeBruin before he made the film; DeBruin's surviving family members, however, say Herzog ignored their multiple attempts to contact him.

This news leaves me sad and uncertain what to think. Certainly Herzog's film, for the sheer quality of what's on screen, is powerful and inspiring. Herzog was so moved by Dengler's story that he filmed it twice: first as a documentary, ""Little Dieter Needs to Fly,"" and then as ""Rescue Dawn."" The real Dengler--a Navy pilot who was the only Vietnam POW to successfully escape from the Viet Cong--had enough courage, grit, optimism and resourcefulness for a dozen Navy flyers, and Christian Bale gives the performance of his career so far as Dengler. So does Steve Zahn as Duane Martin, Dengler's fellow POW. The film is suspenseful, even harrowing--Herzog, as always, put himself, his cast and his crew through a myriad of extreme situations--and Peter Zeitlinger's photography of the Southeast Asian jungle is magnificent. So how am I to feel upon learning that such a brilliant film misrepresents the lives of some of the people it depicts? All I can say is, see this film for the excellence of its craft, but take the story with a grain of salt.",1244678400,,1702,4.968421052631579

2.  However, when the movie was over, I was left with a feeling of disappointed / dissatisfaction.  After thinking about it for a while, I guess the my main problem (s) with the film is that the Christian Bale's performance was odd vs unconvincing.  I know that the pilot in real life was known for his positive attitude, but Christian Bale's performance makes him out to be a goofball... at times.  Being former Navy and in the aviation community, I know that aviators are a unique group of people, often being very ""colorful"", however I've never met or known a Naval aviator that was a goofball as portrayed via C. Bale.
  Then on top of that, it was disconcerting that after the pilot's escape companion was killed, there was minimal reflection on his fellow POWs after getting rescued.  The film portrayed the pilot as just being concerned with the fact that he was rescued; ie again, there pilot's character lacked any type of depth or complexity.  It just didn't ring true.

3.  Anyway, I'm sure that a lot of folks have a different take on this.  This will spur me on to get the documentary via the same director;  by definition, this will be a more realistic take on what the pilot was all about as well as his story etc..",1244592000,,1280,4.461206896551724

Visually, we couldn't have picked a better movie to inaugurate ourselves into the world of Hi-Def films. Herzog's cinematography is exceptional. The colors and details are so arresting and intense that, honestly, it is almost overwhelming for a moment. Unfortunately, the sightseeing doesn't get to last very long, as once Christian Bale's Deiter Dengler gets captured, the tone shifts visually to the muddy prison camp for much of the rest of the film.

I wish I had more to say about this movie, but unfortunately there's not much more to say: Christian Bale's performance is engaging, but on par with what we'd expect from him. The real star performance comes from Steve Zahn, who finally reveals that he can act. He performs well beyond what one would expect from the guy that starred opposite Jack Black in Saving Silverman, and if I had to pick one real reason for seeing this movie, it would be his performace. Ultimately, though, the plot drags through most of the second act, and while it's not a bad film by any stretch of the term, it's just not  a movie I've had a strong desire to watch again.

Refusing to give up hope, he leads the other, dispirited captives (Steve Zahn, Jeremy Davies, Abhijati ""Meuk"" Jusakul, and Lek Chaiyan Chunsuttiwat) in an escape attempt.

This film is quite good at presenting not only the physical privations of torture and starvation but also the mental toll exacted by the fear, boredom, and hopelessness of incarceration.  Set against this backdrop, Dieter's refusal to give up becomes a powerful testament to the resiliency of the human spirit.  Director / screenwriter Werner Herzog is famous for shooting his films in difficult locations; in this case, the gorgeous Thai countryside provides a stunning setting and steeps the film in authenticity.

3221528,4,B000WMA6R8,"It's been quite a few years since Werner Herzog did a major fictive film. The last couple of decades has seen an increasing veer into documentaries and more experimental cinema. However, with 2007 film, Rescue Dawn, Herzog shows that the years have not taken their all too inexorable toll on the visionary mind. While the film is not an inarguably great masterpiece along the lines of some of his classic fictive films from the 1970s, it is a terrific war film, but, more so, a terrific prison escape and action film, even as it wholly subverts many of those subgenre's worst banalities.
  The film is sometimes an expansion, condensation, and retelling of the same basic tale Herzog told in his classic 1997 documentary Little Dieter Needs To Fly. That film chronicled the life and capture, over Laos, of a German born U.S. Navy Pilot named Dieter Dengler, who spent six months as a prisoner of war in Laos, before escaping with six other men into the jungle. Only Dengler was known to have survived. Rescue Dawn details and condenses many aspects of the earlier film, and is well acted by a stellar cast, well directed by Herzog, and brilliantly cinematographed by Peter Zeitlinger, who melds the stunning visuals of Thailand with Herzog's own classic `eye level realism' to evoke some of the same sorts of jungle imagery that made films like Aguirre: The Wrath Of God and Fitzcarraldo so impressive. On top of that is the wonderful film scoring by Klaus Bedelt, which is very minimal yet effective when employed; mixing the high and low forms of music Herzog is known for.
  The plot is rather simple, and greatly condenses the tale the real Dengler tells within the earlier film.... The acting, especially on Bale's part, is outstanding. In each of his roles, Bale creates characters wildly different from each other. Comic actor Steve Zahn also shines as the timid Duane Martin, and Jeremy Davies makes for an excellent counterpoint to Dengler's exuberance, whether true or not. And the film also benefits by its fast pace. Despite being 125 minutes in length, the film never has `dead air'. It moves relentlessly from scene to scene, often being cut just before a typical Hollywood moment would arise in an action film. Thus, Herzog gives the viewer their Hollywood steak while not clogging their arteries with the mindless fat.
  Yet, despite all its excellent points, at its heart, this film, unlike the documentary version of Dengler's life, is simply a deeper action film (a sort of leaner, meaner The Bridge On The River Kwai); it lacks the overall intellectual depth, probing, and agon that defines great art and suffuses Herzog's fictive classics from earlier in his career, even as it is a significantly better work of art than such a similarly themed and lauded film as The Deer Hunter. Rescue Dawn, however, and despite its near miss at greatness, is certainly a must see for those people who want to get a richer perspective on the Vietnam War, and deserves its place alongside Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket as unique visions of that war. But, to get an even fuller sense of what the war and Dieter Dengler were all about, watch Little Dieter Needs To Fly right afterwards. It's called eating the cake whilst having it, too; but, more than that, one will find that the cake is also surprisingly healthy and enlivening.

3221531,4,B000WMA6R8,"Inspired by the true story of Dieter Dengler's (Christian Bale) ordeals during the Vietnam war, Rescue Dawn follows Lt. Dengler on his very first combat mission.  Prior to the primary ground battles, U.S. troops flew bombing raids missions into Laos, and it is during one such excursion in 1965 that Dengler's plane took ground-fire that caused a crash.

While jungle survival videos produced by the military were supposed to keep a downed pilot safe in Dengler's situation, they did no such thing.  Woefully unprepared for the jungle, he's captured in a matter of days and soon faces months of sadistic torture at the hands of both the Laotians and the Vietnamese.  Beatings, being bound and tied to a moving oxen, and nearly drowned, he's eventually moved to a P.O.W. camp where other soldiers are being held.  It is in this prison camp that a daring rescue attempt is devised by the shared contributions of the prisoners, as Dengler and other prisoners fight through the jungles of Laos towards Thailand and eventual freedom.

Convincing as Dengler, Christian Bale really sells out for this role.  Throughout the movie his physical condition noticeably worsens, his weight takes a dramatic drop, and he truly looks like he may have been tortured as a POW.

Troubling, however, is what I have read since watching the movie.  Evidently, several other prisoners and their families take umbrage with the manner in which the movie portrays certain events.  Werner Herzog takes liberties with certain facts, giving credit to Dengler when others were responsible, and painting other prisoners in a negative light when, in fact, they were courageous and patriotic throughout the entire ordeal.

Not knowing the contested history, this movie is a solid contribution to Hollywood's Vietnam oeuvre.  It's a tense, harrowing drama, and I'm upset that this is based in even the remotest sense on reality.  Knowing that certain portrayals within the movie inaccurately tarnish the legacy of good men who gave their lives upsets me even more.",1217721600,,2030,5.096676737160121

Rescue Dawn tells the true story of Dieter Dengler, a Navy pilot shot down and taken prisoner in the Vietnam conflict. The movie title is a little bit misleading, since the movie does not center on a ""rescue"" so much as it does the escape and survival of the prisoners. The movie definitely centers around Dengler, and I think they were trying to give you a real sense of the isolation and confusion that came with being a prisoner of war (it's a little bit artsy).

The characters (mostly fellow prisoners) and Christian Bale as Dengler were terrific. The story flowed well and I was on the edge of my seat almost the entire movie. Great scenery, great acting, great situations. The special features fill you in on some of the details of Dengler's life too. Overall, you can't miss with a true survival story in Vietnam.

3221535,3,B000WMA6R8,"Werner Herzog, the filmmaker behind such legendary films as ""Fitzcarraldo"", ""Aguirre: The Wrath of God"" and the documentary ""Grizzly Man"" among many others, made a documentary called ""Little Dieter Needs to Fly"" almost a decade ago. The filmmaker follows Dieter Dengler, a pilot with the United States Navy during the Vietnam War, as Dengler revisits the country where he was shot down and taken prisoner and as he returns to his home country of Germany. Herzog believed the story to be so powerful that he decided to make a film about the incident.

""Rescue Dawn"", directed by Herzog and starring Christian Bale as Dieter along with Jeremy Davies and Steve Zahn as two of his fellow POWs, follows Dieter as he prepares for his first mission as a pilot in the late 60s. He receives instructions to fly into Laos, before the war has even begun, to bomb suspected targets. During the mission he is quickly shot down and tries to attract a rescue copter or plane. Instead, soldiers and extremely angry militia find him and take him to a POW camp, where he meets Duane (Steve Zahn) and Gene (Jeremy Davies), two of the handful of American soldiers who are already being held captive in a small clearing in the middle of the harsh, hot jungle. Their guards aren't giving them enough food or water, they are chained up at night, and Dieter realizes he simply can't sit around waiting until they starve to death or the guards decide to shoot them because they are bored. He comes up with an escape plan and tries to convince everyone that it will work. But as they are starving and any potential escape means living in the jungle for a significant period of time, they are frightened and scared of the prospects.

I understand what Christian Bale is trying to do as Dieter, but the effect is still a little strange. And the character doesn't work. When we first meet Dieter, we could be watching a sequel to ""Top Gun"", the pilots are in a briefing, ready and raring to go, ready to jump into their planes and start flying. There are no political discussions about their mission and the objective, they are American pilots and their mission is their objective. And Dieter is particularly gung ho as this is his first mission. He smiles as everyone pats him on the back because they know this is the culmination of a lifelong dream for Dieter; Dengler was actually born in Germany and immigrated to the United States and became a citizen always dreaming of becoming a pilot and flying planes. Bale uses a very slight accent to portray Dengler's origins. And throughout the film, this accent gets a little more pronounced when Bale is trying to show Dengler's frustration. I get this part of the character. What was less successful for me was Bale's portrayal of Dengler's 'enthusiasm' throughout the film. As Dengler tries to convince the rest of the POWs, he seems to smile here and there, trying to show them that his plan will work, that there isn't a lot of danger out there. Throughout, he appears to remain particularly lucid and determined, as though the lack of food, water and livable conditions has no effect on him.

When you watch Bale's performance next to that of Steve Zahn and Jeremy Davies, there is just something that doesn't mesh. Granted Duane and Gene have been in captivity longer, but even when Dengler is loosing weight (Bale will soon challenge DeNiro for the title of ""Most Method Actor in Films"" if he continues to lose and gain weight for every film role) he continues to appear determined and the madness affecting his friends never seems to enter the picture for Dengler. This, combined with the faint accent, makes the character seem less real even though I am sure Bale studied footage of the real Dengler, studied his mannerisms and voice.

Because there are really no politics in this film, it becomes less interesting somehow. Initially, the pilots are gung ho for the mission, despite the fact they are about to bomb many villages. And the conclusion of the film seems to indicate Dengler is ready and willing to go on another mission, as soon as he has recovered. In fact, a coda states as much at the end of the film.

I have not see ""Little Dieter Needs to Fly"", but I have to think that Herzog probably captured some remorse from the former pilot. In ""Rescue Dawn"", the story ends much earlier than this and we have no evidence of this.

""Rescue Dawn"" is an interesting story but it lacks the necessary punch or a great performance from Bale to fully move the viewer.",1216857600,,4499,4.652830188679245

In ""Rescue Dawn,"" Christian Bale plays Dieter Dengler, a navy pilot who was shot down over Laos in 1966.  He spent many months in a prisoner-of-war camp not far from the Ho Chi Minh Trail, suffering torture and starvation along with the half dozen or so other men who were imprisoned with him.  A man of great determination and resourcefulness, Dengler engineered a daring escape that earned him the Navy Cross, the Distinguished Flying Cross and a Purple Heart.

""Rescue Dawn"" was directed by Werner Herzog, the world-famous auteur of such visionary films as ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God,"" ""Fitzcarraldo"" and ""Grizzly Man.""  Given that pedigree, one is struck by just how conventional a piece of filmmaking ""Rescue Dawn"" turns out to be (Herzog made a documentary on Dengler, entitled ""Little Dieter Needs to Fly,"" in 1997).  Perhaps because the director found himself hemmed in by the biographical nature of the material, ""Rescue Dawn"" feels pretty much like every other prisoner-of-war film set during the Vietnam Era (and before).  The main distinction of this movie lies not in its plot details or character insights but in the fact that Bale and several of the other actors were willing to go on drastic diets and drop massive amounts of weight in order to achieve their emaciated looks.  With their ribs and spines clearly sticking out through their taut skin, the actors never allow us to doubt for a moment their total commitment either to the material or to their art.  The problem is that it becomes such a distraction to us in the audience that it may actual have the opposite effect than what was intended. We begin to worry more about the actors than about the characters, questioning whether any role is worth putting one's health and life at risk in such a manner.  In other words, rather than drawing us deeper into the story, it actually winds up pushing us away.

Reservations aside, it is important to note that ""Rescue Dawn"" is still a film well worth seeing.  It is superbly acted by Bale, Jeremy Davies and Steve Zahn (as two of his fellow POWs), and  features any number of disturbing, harrowing moments as we watch men, pushed to the limit of their endurance, trying to keep hope alive even after all reason for hope has vanished.  We watch in complete empathy as deprivation, confinement and emotional abuse take their toll on the characters` bodies, psyches and spirits.  The last half hour of the film, in particular, is poignant and heartbreaking as the men become increasingly desperate in their efforts to stay alive.

I wish the filmmakers had provided some clue as to what happened to some of the other prisoners after they and Dengler part company late in the film.  We're happy that things eventually worked out well for Dengler, but we would like to know how the other characters we've come to care about fared as well.  I imagine that Dengler himself would have wanted it that way.",1201392000,,2924,4.790836653386454

If you enjoyed ""Bat 21"", ""Platoon"", or ""Full Metal Jacket"" you will probably want to catch this one. This movie shows how a handful of prisoners try to escape deep from the jungles to return to their base. It is a enlightening and frightening experience. Bale does a great job as the lead character and the rest the support cast are quite good. The character development is what really pulls you into the movie. They make you feel their pain and realize how they were best able to cope with their circumstances. Good quality DVD with standard extras. Decent replayability.",1201132800,,662,4.765217391304348
3221554,5,B000WMA6R8,"Let me start this by saying that I was a personal participant in the rescue of Dieter Dengler. I was the loadmaster on the C-130 crew that spotted the fires he set and it was with a parachute from one of the flares he dropped that he signaled the pilot who finally saw him and effected his rescue. I am also an accomplished author and a frequent contributor to VIETNAM magazine.

With that said I must say that after reading Dieter's book and seeing the previous documentary, I am convinced that the criticims put forth regarding the accuracy of the movie are unfounded. Dengler makes it clear in his book that there was bad-blood between the Americans and the Thais and also makes it clear that it was he, in particular, who devised the escape plan. The movie version of his story condenses some events but that is what movies do. It also shows his fires being spotted by helicopters when it was actually a C-130 crew that he signaled, but so what? The movie was shot on location in Thailand using available resources and attention to detail is not possible in that kind of situation. What amazes me is that events depicted in the movie that I thought at the time were hookey actually happened, particularly the scene where his squadron mates spirited him out of the hospital and back to the carrier. As war movies go, this is probably the most historically accurate I've ever seen. As for how Gene DeBruin is portrayed, I would suggest that critics read Dengler's book. While he may be more kooky in the movie than in real life, Dengler implies that he was a little bit off his rocker.

Incidentally, as a fan of EMPIRE OF THE SUN, I don't think Herzog could have made a better choice than Christian Bale to portray a pilot in a survival situation.",1200873600,,1750,4.517350157728707

If you think this film is all ********,then it saddens me as this film truly represents human beings' reactions and actions in times of real helplessness.

Christian Bale is at his finest.  He never lets the viewer down; in ""Rescue Dawn,"" he gives you far more than what you ask for.

Jeremy Davies, too, amazes; the three of them have a certain troubled dynamic that could only come from a true-life story.

Christain Bale while on a secret mission to bomb targets in Laos crash lands in that area which leads him to become a prisoner of war in the Vietnam camp. He meets a few other pow's who have turned light in the head due to their continued incarceration. We are shown christian bale and his buddies tied to stones at night so that there is no chance for escape. They are given the crappiest food to eat, usually some rice and water. Basically they are treated a little better than at a Nazi concentration camp. But I could not make out what the movie was about. Its got a bit of comedic relief
when the pow's chatter around when christian Bale tries to have intelligent conversation with his buddies (a bunch of loonies). He then hatches out a plan for escape. Its a pow story half the way, with a bit of comedy and then the other half is an escape story. But the problem is that I found the sublte comedy to be kind of taking away from the
eriousness or the horrificness the we should feel at a pow camp. The movie was kind of being light hearted about a very serious subject. It's a tough movie to classify. At times I felt it was like a documentary with seemingly unneccessary long takes or long winded conversations which did nothing to further the tempo of the story.

3221563,1,B000WMA6R8,"This movie is awful.  It's awful not so much of bad acting, it is awful because Werner Herzog is an opportunist and elevates an heroic character by sacrificing the good name Eugene DeBruin who was just as heroic as Dieter Dangler was and perhaps more so by sacrificing his own life to help a fellow prisoner, though most people do not know this.

Anyone interested in the truth should google Rescue Dawn The Truth.  This is a web site that Eguene DeBruin's brother has made and points out many egregious ommissions and twists of the truth that Werner made.  He basically strives to increase Danglers heros status through ommissions and distortation of the truth by villifying DeBruin.  He sacrifices this poor man and has no problem doing it for the good of his movie.  He rationalizes this by proclaiming his goal was to tell Dangler's story.  It's too bad that in doing so he creates a presumption that this movie is accurate when in fact Herzog clearly failed to do his research on the other characters.

Some factual errors include the wrong number of POW's, making DeBruin into a Charles Manson like charcter when in fact DeBruin was very caring of his fellow POW's.  DeBruin volunteered to stay behind during the  escape attempt to care for a sick prisoner who could not leave--this ultimately cost him his life. The escape plans were already formulated by the time Dengler became a prisoner not by Dengler himself.  DeBruin and another prisoner, not Dengler made the handcuff key that freed them at night.  Dengler was not the only prisoner to fire his weapon during the escape attempt.  In fact, another prisoner shot and killed the guards.  After the escape when Dengler and DeBruin met the movie portrays him as scared and indecisive, which is completely opposite of how DeBruin actually acted.  Dengler was hiding in the woods when Martin was killed by the villager, too weak to help and did not fend off the villages with his machete.  Dengler is documented stating that DeBruin was of strong character and Jerry DeBruin, brother of Eugene feels that Dengler, had he lived to see the making of this movie would not approve of Werner's portrayal of DeBruin.

One must take this movie with a grain of salt.  Dieter Dangler was a hero that is for sure but so were the others in that prisoner of war camp.  Werner wants to take advantage of Dangler's German immigrant status and make him the sole hero and defacto leader at the expense of the other prisoners, particularly DeBruin.

Believe what you want, but this film is not an accurate depiction.  It reminds me of the old saying; Believe half of what you see and none of what you read.  I think that saying is true here.  Eugene DeBruin was a hero and a patriot and his sacrifice should never be forgotten.  Consider this movie more of a work of fiction than anything else.",1199059200,,2835,4.680808080808081

3221575,5,B000WMA6R8,"Werner Herzog is a wonderful filmmaker and everything he does is worth seeing.  This movie is a dramatization of the events recounted in his 1997 documentary ""Little Dieter Needs to Fly"".  Because it is a dramatization, some of the events in the movie are conflated, and some of the characters are different than the real life people with those names.  For example, Jeremy Davies gives a wonderful performance as Eugene McBruin.  In the movie, McBruin provides threats and resistance to what Dengler is trying to do to survive.  He comes across as weak, broken by years of captivity, and unnecessarily contrary to the idea of escape.  However, his family rejects that portrayal.  This is an especially important point because there were reports of his being alive and in Laos until the 1990s.

The dramatizations aside, this is a very good movie.  Dengler was a German who was a child at the end of World War II.  His hometown was on the receiving end of air attacks from the allies and a particularly low and close flight by one pilot transformed Dieter and form that moment on he needed to fly.  He emigrated to the United States and joined the military so he could fly.  As the movie portrays, he was shot down in February 1966 and eventually captured, tortured, and imprisoned in Laos.

Eventually, he and his fellow inmates made a plan for escape and the latter half of the movie recounts that attempt in June 1966 and what happened afterwards.  The story is quite intense and Christian Bale does a fine job portraying Dengler.  Steve Zahn gives a very moving and emotional performance as Duane Martin, Dengler's closes friend among the prisoners.  Obviously, Dengler escaped and survived and we share the delight of his former crew when he returns to the ship.  And we share Dengler's sorrow at the loss and pain he suffered in captivity and during the difficult escape process.

In real life, Dengler left the service and became a test pilot and survived four additional crashes.  He later became a pilot for TWA.  He died of Lou Gherig's disease in 2001.

I give this movie a strong recommendation.

3221576,4,B000WMA6R8,"It's ironic (but not unexpected) that Herzog's most successful film to date is probably his most conventional, and least characteristic, film. What makes it seem uncharacteristic is its complete lack of irony, its refusal to stand at a distance from its characters or from the situation as they see it. Most of Herzog's films are explorations of obsessions, both their danger and excitement -- the capacity of obsession both to reveal and transcend as well as to destroy. In their unflinching look at the passions that drive men to create and destroy, Herzog gives a kind of portrait of himself, of what he admires and what he questions.

Here it is Dieter Dengler, played very well by Christian Bale (in another body altering performance), who is obsessed with flying. Of German descent, but now thoroughly Americanized, Dengler is not interested in war per se but takes advantage of the opportunity that military service provides him to become a fighter pilot. He ends up being shot down and captured, and the film explores his reaction to this captivity, and his drive to escape. Apart from a stubborn tenacity that brushes aside objections to his plan, Dieter is unambiguously presented as a hero in the tradition of classical American films. Herzog clearly admires the man, and this film (like the documentary upon which it was based - ""Little Dieter Needs to Fly"") is a celebration of his dedication and perseverance, and reveals a side of Herzog that may be less evident in many of his other films. One feature that makes it clearly not your average war prisoner film is its unwillingness to be judgmental about the captors -- who are in a precarious situation themselves and managing only as well as they know how. Rescue Dawn is, perhaps, not a film I'll go back to again and again like Aguirre or Fitzcarraldo or Stroszek or Lessons of Darkness or Wild Blue Yonder, but it is a very well made and well acted film -- and definitely one to watch.",1197158400,,1954,4.781065088757397

3221578,5,B000WMA6R8,"A very good movie.
unlike any war, vietnam, or prisoner of war story i can remember watching or reading.
it is the story of Dieter Dengler, the only US Navy pilot to escape from the Pathet Lao.

The story is a contrast of opposing ways of looking at both the world and yourself.
Dengler's vs. two other prisoners in the camp, one of resignation, the other one an outward optimism (rescue will come before the rainy season starts), but really another form of resignation and pessimism (because it isn't joined to action but to waiting).

What i find extraordinary is not the survival of people in such awful conditions, but how a single person, sustaining what really is an absurd optimism can uplift and motivate the whole group.

I think this is the message that the director wishes people to take home, optimism maybe misplaced, but without it hope flees. It is better to be an out of place foolish optimist then to resign yourself to your surroundings and give up.

It is an extraordinary message and it is provided to us in the movie with forcefulness and with a subdued passion for life that really ought to rub off on each viewer as she/he looks at their lives and says ""things really aren't that bad"", ""i just need to get moving in the right direction"", ""with the right attitude-like Dengler's"".

Where do people like this come from?
How do they sustain their optimism in situations that destroy other people?
If i can't be that person, how do i get to meet one and learn from watching them?

It is a worthwhile to own movie, i can only imagine what Dengler was like in person from watching the movie, i've never personally met anyone quite like him.
so i'm glad i ""met"" him in the movie.",1196294400,,1695,4.522875816993464
3221579,3,B000WMA6R8,"Christian Bale plays naval pilot Dieter Dengler, a German-born American citizen who is shot down during the early stages of the Vietnam War over Laos, and is then kept as a prisoner with other POWs in a small shack in the middle of the jungle. They struggle to survive with little or no food, as Dieter hatches a long-winded plan to escape the confines of the camp. Opening with real footage of a village being bombed, Werner Herzog's feature version of his 1997 documentary 'Little Dieter Learns To Fly' does little to expand on the themes explored more thoroughly in said doc. The problem here is a lack of a focus on the part of Herzog, who allows some plot strands to unfold to a point, but then frustratingly severs them without a proper conclusion. For about an hour in the middle of Dawn's running time, everything seems to hit its stride, and it appears to be unfolding tentatively and with genuine skill - taking things up several notches from the unemotional and dull opening. Bale and Zahn in particular excel in roles that have an indisputable emotional power - and not just in the staggering weight loss. There's a real sadness in Zahn's eyes that portrays a vast sense of emotion far beyond any other role of his career, and if there's any justice in the world, the former funnyman will bag his first Oscar nomination for this stunning performance. The same, however, cannot be said of the unbelievably irritating Jeremy Davies, who incoherently mumbles his way through another role. While a partial lack of urgency in the concluding twenty minutes will leave you scratching your head, Rescue Dawn is still a captivating story of survival that is helped enormously by a predictably brilliant Bale, and a stunning turn from Zahn.",1196208000,,1742,4.771523178807947

Dieter (Christian Bale) is an optimistic German-American POW, not at all cartoonish, gung-ho, or sadistic as portrayed in movies like THE GREEN BERETS-PLATOON-FULL METAL JACKET-THE DEER HUNTER, who knows he must escape his cruel captors before they kill him and the other prisoners. We feel his frustration and determination, despite the doubts expressed by the other POWs, that he will convince them that they must all work together if they are to survive. Dieter succeeds and he and fellow POW Duane (Steve Zahn) do make their getaway and struggle thru the jungle in search of freedom. This is a riveting look at the misery suffered by Americans captured by the enemy during the Vietnam War. It is an uplifting movie and I highly recommend it.",1196121600,,939,4.875
3221581,4,B000WMA6R8,"Christian Bale has been Oscar worthy time in and time out.  He is, without question, one of our finest working actors, so it is no surprise that the best thing about `Rescue Dawn' is Bale's harrowing performance.  As Lt. Dieter Dengler, Bale is breathtaking.  While the film itself is flawed his performance is far from it.

`Rescue Dawn' centers around a young pilot who is shot down behind enemy lines and taken prisoner by the Pathet Lao.  In his newfound POW camp Dengler meets five other captives who have been in captivity for a much longer period of time.  This fact is evident in their mental state for the lack of food and lack of hope has begun to strip away their sanity.  Dengler immediately makes a connection with the only stable man in the group, Duane Martin, and the two of them start to plan an escape.

As far as POW films go this film can't compare to greats like `The Deer Hunter' but it does have a lot going for it.  First of all it is visually mesmerizing.  To be honest I am reminded of the feeling I got when watching last years `The Painted Veil', that surreal overwhelming feeling of seeing something truly rich and lush, and there are many scenes, especially in the third act, that are supremely rich and lush.  The jungle is so green, so vibrant that it becomes its own character.  The acting on all fronts is great.  Much has been said of Steve Zahn's performance, and while I don't feel it was `a revelation' I do feel that it is his finest performance yet, but then again, that really isn't saying much is it?  Bale as has been mentioned time and time again is brilliant here.  If this movie had been released this month instead of mid-year he could be a serious contender for the Oscar, but sadly he will most likely be overlooked.

Jeremy Davies' character adds a lot to the feel of this film for he starts off where Dengler will ultimately end up (in regards to mental instability).  I think that is truly the beauty of Bale's rich performance.  He takes on such a transformation, yet it is so controlled and gradual that it never feels forced.  You have watched him transform before your eyes at such a natural pace that it all makes sense to you.  And not only does he take on the mental transformation, but physically as well he wastes away before the camera.

The direction by Werner Herzog is also very good and deserves mention.  Obviously he is very interested and connected to this heroic tale.  I think maybe that his `connection' to the subject may have blinded him slightly when concluding this picture, for those last few moments really do a number on the overall feel of the film.  In other words, I hated the ending.  It felt way too Hollywood for a film that up until that point felt nothing like the sentimental mush hand fed to the masses today.  That is a small bone to pick, I know, and the other flaws I find within the film are petty in themselves.  There are moments of sheer confusion which were slightly irritating (the POW camp scenes seem frantic at times and with everyone whispering it becomes a strain to try and follow what is actually going on) but overall it's nothing too disappointing.

In the end `Rescue Dawn' was a very good film, not perfect but not every film has to be.  Bale is as great as they say he is, but what else would you expect.  I will say that I hope and pray this at least picks up a Cinematography nomination at this year's Oscars for Peter Zeitlinger does such an outstanding job in allowing the scenery to move the film that I'm tempted to say he is the best thing to happen to this movie.",1196121600,,3581,4.422900763358778
3221582,4,B000WMA6R8,"I decided to pick up Rescue Dawn on Blu-ray as a blind buy after reading so many positive reviews of the film.  Overall, I was not disappointed!

First off, trailers for the DVD on television will make the movie appear to be packed with action.  It's not.  It's a character driven drama more than anything else, so if that's not what you're looking for go snatch up Die Hard 4 (another great movie).  What I found truly compelling is that you could see the characters' actual physical and mental changes throughout the story - especially Christian Bale's - and thus feel more emotionally attached to the characters and their fates.  Aside from the story itself, the movie looks beautiful in high definition (lots of lush green jungle scenes) and is very tastefully shot.  The sound is quite nice, too, although I don't have an audio rig capable of playing the DTS-HD soundtrack.

Overall, I'd definitely recommend this to fans of drama or war movies.",1195948800,,950,4.75

3221584,5,B000WMA6R8,"Christian Bale has found a role and a movie that match his talent, finally. Never mind that it was not a popular theatrical success; this is one that will be watched and remembered for years to come. The criticism hat it offers nothing new in the genre of P.O.W. films is mistaken for one simple reason: the other films don't have Dieter Dengler as a central character. While some have read his behavior while prisoner as arrogant, I found him instead to be optimistic, even, at times, naive; for days after seeing this in the cinema, the scene that remained with me was the one when he first tries to flag down a U.S. helicopter flying over, and instead is shot at, mistaken for the enemy. Dengler, rather than sink into utter despair, shouts back, ""Hey, you idiot! You almost hit me!"" That, I think, underscores the uniqueness of his character, the irrepressibility that makes him, and Bale's masterpiece of a performance, so unforgettable. This film by the way, is only enhanced by watching the documentary ""Little Dieter Needs to Fly,"" which should have been included in this DVD release. Kudos must also go to Klaus Bedelt, who in my opinion wrote a most poignant and appropriate soundtrack to this film. It brings a depth and dimension to the film, rather than merely hang as a supplement to it. And yet it stands completely alone as well, evocative of the film but not needing it to survive on its own as a stunningly well- wrought and lyrical piece of music.",1195862400,,1466,4.642307692307693
3221585,4,B000WMA6R8,"So speaks Dieter Dengler when asked for comment at the end of his journey of jungle captivity in Laos.  RESCUE DAWN is as much about the courage and fortitude of a captured soldier during wartime as it is about a true incident.  From the inherent optimism of pilot Dieter Dengler (played with commitment and finesse by Christian Bale) the story transcends biopic and offers lessons for life in general; the human spirit can be indefatigable.

Writer/director Werner Herzog has expanded his 1997 documentary about Dieter Dengler and in doing so he has provided us entry into the psyches of soldiers captured by the enemy and the extraordinarily trying conditions in which they survive. The optimistic and eager Dengler is sent on a classified mission to bomb certain targets in Laos in 1965 with his fellow pilots including his best friend Spook (Toby Huss).  Denlger is shot down and captured, interrogated, tortured, and placed in a prison with fellow inmates Duane (Steve Zahn in a career changing superb performance), Gene (the emaciated and excellent Jeremy Davies), Phisit (Abhijati 'Meuk' Jusakul), and Procet (Lek Chaiyan Chunsuttiwat).  The living conditions are deplorable: the men are starved, chained together making even the possibility of caring for bodily functions negligible, and the moral is low.  Dengler changes that using his ingenuity and immediately plans for escape.  Duane aids Dengler but Gene fears the consequences of an aborted escape attempt. Yet with Dengler's expertise and cunning the escape into the jungle is planned and is essentially successful - until the other enemy (the jungle) reduces the forces to one. As Dengler is rescued he is left with the ghosts of his fellow inmates, a factor that will haunt him and alter his life after rescue.

Christian Bale's performance is near perfect as are the performances by Zahn and Davies.  The film feels too long at times but that also suggests that director Herzog wants the audience to understand the mental deterioration and stagnant time cycle that cripples prisoners of war.  The atmosphere of the prison camp is presented well and if the ending of the film becomes a bit too 'Hollywood', after the 2+ hours of prison confinement that is somewhat of a relief.  RESCUE DAWN is a powerful film with some of the best acting of the year's crop and certainly deserves the attention of a wide audience.  Grady Harp, November 07",1195776000,,2407,5.035264483627204

I dare anyone to watch this movie and not be moved not only by Bale's performance but by the fact that this unbelievable man was able to make it through situation where most if not all people would have curled into a fetal position and accepted death. You will leave this film with a new understanding of the human soul. An understanding that when man's heart is strong, he can survive anything.

3221587,2,B000WMA6R8,"I saw this movie mainly because Christian Bale plays the lead, and it was worth watching, but it's solid entertainment, but not great, and doesn't warrant repeated viewings. It's more simple and straightforward than it could have been and feels like it was made for the laid-back moviegoer, not fans of war movies and/or serious filmmaking.
At times, some scenes felt as if they were straight out of a made-for-TV movie. There's no doubt that the POWs were in a stressful situation, but the film's direction doesn't make us feel it. It feels like actors playing the roles of soldiers in a POW camp -- you won't find much here along the lines of a ""Platoon"" or ""Saving Private Ryan."" In fact, you'll find some shades of ""Top Gun,"" namely because Bale's character comes off as an overly easygoing, happy-go-lucky, almost goofy guy. Now, perhaps the real-life person he's playing was like that in real life (I have not seen the documentary by the same director), but it just doesn't feel right. I was reminded of Tom Cruise playing Tom Cruise the Actor.

3221588,5,B000WMA6R8,"War stories from the Vietnam era are always daunting. Always told by the heroes who lived them--fine examples like Apocalypse Now and Platoon come to mind. They are always full of courage, patriotism but told with crude reality. Rescue Dawn tells the story of a brave American soldier who became a POW during the Vietnam War. He just wanted to be a pilot, but became something greater than that. The film's great story, acting, and visuals create a sense of realism that the audience will appreciate. This is the best war movie of 2007. Also, this is Christian Bale's best performance of his career and probably a contender for best actor at the Oscars.

Brief Story Intro:
It is 1965. US Navy Pilot Dieter (Christian Bale) is going to a secret mission to South East Asia--Laos is his destination. As he is flying through the mountains, his plane gets shot down by the enemy. Miraculously, he survives the crash, but now he has to run away from these Asian peasants who are looking restlessly for him. Unfortunately, he gets caught. After suffering torture, he is taken to a prison camp in this hostile jungle where he meets other Americans soldiers like Duane (Steve Zahn) and Gene (Jeremy Davies). He becomes the leader of the group by showing determination, ingenuity and courage. He doesn't want to stay long there--like many of them--so he masterminds an escape plan. They all agree, but Gene is not too sure about it--he believes that the war will end soon and they will be released. After secretly collecting simple tools, they plan their escape.

Review:
Based on a true story, told with intensity, but what really makes this movie shine? One of the most important aspects of Rescue Dawn is its realism. It is hard to find actors who want to go the ""extra mile"" to give life to their characters. The main actors look, in every sense, like real POWs from the Vietnam era--down to their starving bodies and personalities. They transformed themselves for this role and I praise that kind of commitment--great actors who have done the same are Charlize Theron (Monster) and Tom Hanks (Cast Away). Especially Christian Bale who plays a charismatic, next-door guy Navy pilot who just wanted to fly his plane, made fun of surviving military videos, but once he becomes a prisoner of war, he chances to a mature survivor who has to keep his sanity in order to survive his captors and the jungle--his biggest enemy of all. It is heartbreaking to see all the things our hero has to go through to be alive. He never gives up even though the odds are against him. I won't be surprised if Christian Bale gets a nomination for this extreme role.

I also praise the German director Werner Herzog whose cinematography has a bit of a ""documentary"" look--especially when Dieter is taken to the village when we see his captors and regular people from the village--and also displays a sense of isolation and beauty of the South-East Asia jungle--some of the visuals are very impressive, but there is more than that. Rescue Dawn has the best soundtrack of 2007. The music goes well with every dramatic scene. The beauty of the melodies are so uplifting, that gives the ending, one of the most satisfying moments in recent memory.

The Verdict:
War stories are best told by the people who lived them, day by day, tear by tear. The ones who suffered unimaginable things, but their will to survive, kept them alive. Rescue Dawn tells the dramatic story of one of those heroes from the Vietnam War--All with vanguard acting and visuals. Some might complain for its running time (126 minutes) but this is a small issue because this is one of the best films of 2007.",1192752000,,3647,4.720565149136577
3221589,5,B000WMA6R8,A great film by Werner Herzog. A touching film. A soaring performance by Christain Bale. A magnificent supporting performance by Steve Zahn. The score is pure genius. An amazing film. Five stars no doubt about it.,1192406400,,213,4.944444444444445
3221590,5,B000WMA6R8,"Is there anything and any part that Christian Bale cannot do? Honestly,this phenom seems to be finally in the consistent top echelon movies and each time he astounds just as he did as a child in ""Empire of the Sun"" back in the mid 1980's.
I will say right here that Bale's performance as Dieter Dengler, the shot down Navy pilot who survived torture at the hands of the Laotians in pre-Vietnam War, is nothing short of amazing. He is in every scene in this 2 hour+human wartime drama by Werner Herzog;that it extremely demanding for an actor. It is obvious the amount of starvation weight loss that he underwent to BE Dengler at his lowest as a prisoner in Laos,eating worms and rice! Bale is so in control of his character that the viewer is extremely confident that what is on the screen is Oscar worthy. This entire film hangs on the strength of Bale's sensitive rendering of Dengler.
Without Bale, this film, as fascinating and riveting true story as it is,would be diminished in any other actor's hands. Not since Adrian Brody's Oscar winning role in ""The Pianist"" has a film so relied on the complete command of the material in the hands of the lead man. This is not to say that the supporting roles are not incredible,because Jeremy Davies and Steve Zahn as the two Americans interred with Bale in the cruel Laos camp are truly standouts as supporting actors.""Rescue Dawn"" is not so much a War film or a film that makes statements about War (though one is left to infer),but rather an in depth look into the character and makeup of humans in extraordinarily harsh conditions. Anyone would want Dengler as portrayed by Bale as their best friend; loyal,funny,charming,optimistic,resourceful,confident,apologetic and most of all incredibly and refreshingly innocent.
This film is so good all around that I find no fault with any of it. It is slow (it needs to be) and deliberate. Much of the dialog is barely above a hushed whisper. Close attention must be paid. Herzog puts his audience in the bamboo prison with the six captives. He shackles us nightly with the prisoners. Herzog allows the viewer to be a living but silent partaker in their incredible and inhumane suffering .We move through thick jungle brush while escaping our captors and we watch our friends die viciously.

3221592,4,B000WMA6R8,"The true story of German immigrant turned American pilot Deiter Dengler, (Christian Bale), and his subsequent capture, confinement and escape from a POW camp during The Vietnam War, echoes elements of The Great Escape, and several other escape films, while delivering its own distinct 'war is hell' eulogy in its shadowy, claustrophobic and artful camera eye which defines the hero and his fellow prisoners as a Christ figure surrounded by grungy devotees. Scenes within the confines of their jungle clearing bamboo prison cell, as the prisoners huddle together and whisper secret plans for escape, are indebted to images of famous classical Christian paintings, like an up-close and personal Da Vinci's Last Supper. With Deiter's return to freedom, in the sanitary and joyous sanctity of his home base, he is lifted horizontally above the heads of his cheering fellow soldiers while draped in white hospital convalescent clothing, looking like Jesus rising from the dead. In one scene he wrestles with a large serpant in an attempt to eat it. Director Werner Herzog's religious interpretations are like chapters that lead to a harrowing and godless scene, where an enemy in enemy land, (Deiter), screams in horror to a sky litttered with unwitting rescue helicopters. It is at once, a hope filled and hopeless scene, a picture of war itself.

While following the conventions of escape films; The Deer Hunter, Midnight Express; the list goes on, Rescue Dawn is grittier and less majestic in its adventurous tone, keeping it's cinematic drive not in the panorama of heroic nature, but in the vistas of exotic beauty in the Thailand jungles where the movie was filmed, which reveal a hostile environment of flood swollen rivers, determined blood sucking slugs, and impassable jungle terrain, and the starkness of the mundane and military place of freedom where the adventure began. The movie follows the book on escape films with POW's on the verge of mental breakdown, a bowl of live worms for breakfast, discourse among escapees, emotional freedom ringing conclusion, but it does it all so artfully, you are never reminded of the other great escapes. In Deiter, played by Christian Bale, we have not a disillusioned Vietnam soldier on the verge of living a lifelong nightmare, but of the quality John Wayne boasted, but without the bravura and impossible manhood.  You can picture him barbequing in his backyard with the wife and neighbors, leading a carefree life when the war is over.

The film ends without revealing the fate of Deiter's fellow prisoners which is upsetting. It also offers a lingering question which may suggest topical references to our current state of military affairs. There is a psyche-bizarre scene after a torture session where Deiter seems in compliance with his recent captors as they stand near a body of water filled with, what looked like minnow sized sharks. It is suggestive of the prisoners signing papers declaring America an evil imperialistic nation after an intense psychological torment, hence their confinement, as opposed to their demise.

I didn't know what to expect next. The way you think a typical Hollywood movie would follow is not what happens here. Plans don't go as intended, disasters unfold, and the good aren't always good and the bad aren't always bad.

This time around he dramatizes one of the greatest ever survivor's tales. Dengler was 18 when he left his home in Germany for the states with one mission in mind, to fly for the American military. On February 1, 1966 he took enemy fire and crash-landed his plane in Laos while on a secret mission. After surviving in the jungle on his own he was captured and tortured (hanging upside down with an ant nest around his neck, submerged in a well, dragged by an ox through a village), then taken to the Pathet Lao prison camp. There he met other POWS, then escaped after they overheard the guards say they planned to shoot them. The fellow POWS were separated after the escape, and Dengler and his buddy Duane Martin teamed up. Martin was eventually beheaded by villagers, but Dengler was rescued after improbably surviving the dense jungle. Dengler tells his tale in his own words in the book Escape from Laos (1979).",1185580800,,1033,4.6502732240437155
