Apart from that you guys must have lost your minds. The movie wasn't taht great and I wouldnt buy it for that price if the disc was solid gold!!!",1233100800,2,249,4.081632653061225
1642001,4,B00005OSOA,"totally like this movie, bought the dvd, watched it, unfortunately the dvd movie has been edited. I know, cuz I recorded the unedited version to vhs a long time ago, then transferred that to DVD with my recorder (cuz vhs doesn't last well) while waiting and hoping for it to come to dvd (such a great movie deserves to be a perfect copy), so bought when it came to dvd, and noticed the edit (dialogue edit) which disappointed me as there was no reason to edit anything in this otherwise perfect movie.

that's my two cents worth.",1166745600,14,529,4.453608247422681

1642003,4,B00005OSOA,"This is a very good movie and one of my all time favorites.  It is based on a rugged settler who builds his home on a piece of land that is designated by the Indians as their sacred burial ground.  Unbeknownst to the settler and his Indian bride, he weathers attacks by the angry Indians who try to push him from their land.  The setting takes place in a wooded, mountainous region of the United States and is very picturesque.  The movie is filled with action and the actors are very realistic and believable.  The settler shows a keen wit and is able to ward off multiple attacks at his homestead and while on horseback on the trail.  He is later joined by a mountain man who helps negotiate with and is later killed by the Indians in an attck at the homestead. If you enjoy Indian history and want something that the entire family can watch together this is a very good movie and a collector VHS which can be enjoyed for many years.  I highly recommend this movie.",1010016000,14,967,4.338888888888889

The product arrived with=in a few days after purchase and was as expected and has provided me with many hours of enjoyment. I recommend anyone looking for ANYTHING, check with Amazon first and you could save a lot of frustration and maybe even some money. I have found that it is hard to beat Amazon for service and price. I recommend this movie for all who share my interest and Amazon.",1465257600,,518,4.641304347826087

7949235,2,B00005OSOA,"If I had known this video was a christian modified cut I would never have ordered it. I have an old copy of this movie but the beginning has been wiped out and the copy is getting too old to view. I ordered this one in an effort to have, for posterity, a copy where the image and sound are higher quality. However, when born-agains cut and copy these movies they wind up being worse than the 30 year old copy I already have. Not only is the image and sound as if you are under ten feet of water, but I have never understood their effort to cut out every little cuss word. I have never heard the words ""Heck"" or ""darn"" so much as when watching this video. This movie was already rated G but after the dove people got hold of it, well, they ruined it. More than 20 people get killed in this movie but - by gosh darn heck - they don't get killed while cussing is going on! I suppose it's OK for parents to show their kids a movie that depicts killing as long as they don't say hell or damn while they are doing it. To say I'm very disappointed in this trashy copy is a gross understatement. I originally rated it one star but changed to two because the movie - if not screwed up the way this copy was - is a fantastic movie. If you can find a copy that remains unmolested, buy it! If you find one for sale, make sure it is not a butchered copy as this was is.",1355616000,8,1356,3.970695970695971
