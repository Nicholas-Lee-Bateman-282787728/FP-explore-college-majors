7866238,3,6304252021,"When the son of a director makes a film about his father, you have certain expectations. Bias, yes, but also insight and facts that are otherwise  unknown. George Stevens Jnr provides us with his father's behind the scenes  footage and also the World War 2 film he shot of D-day, the liberation of  Paris, and Dachau, since he was in the special coverage unit. (The war  footage is actually badly edited, or is it that the material is still  subject to the censorship of the military?, and accompanied by a  Hollywood-type saccharine score by Carl Davis). Jnr tells us that he was  bequeathed his father's memorabilia, yet when it comes to covering his  Hollywood career, we get hardly anything new. Even the behind the scenes  home movies are mostly tedious images of the actors waving to the camera.  So then we are left with the movies Snr made, complemeted by present day  interviews with some of the actors involved. Of these, Katharine Hepburn is  particularly entertaining. George Stevens is admired in the same way as  John Ford, a point driven home by iconic profile stills of Snr in a cowboy  hat. Like Ford, Stevens style was simple. He boasted that he could manage  any genre, though he never tried a thriller, and his contemporaries Howard  Hawks, William Wyler or John Huston were just as versatile and also managed  to add some individuality. So there hangs an air of suffocating  self-importance to the films we see. What is interesting is that this air  evolved. His career in Hollywood began as a cameraman and gag writer for  Laurel and Hardy, and Hal Roach. The story of how he overcame the blue eyes  of Stan Laurel that the camera didn't register is the promise of detail  unfulfilled. And the action of Gunga Din looks fun. Hepburn may have hit  upon the reason for Stevens loss of humour. She comments that she had  fierce arguments over his abandoning comedy, which she felt was his true  gift, and turning to more serious subjects, though Jnr makes the point that  it was his war experience which contributed to this decision. I guess after  Dachau, nothing is funny anymore. Jnr also tells us that his father watched  Triumph of the Will alone in a screening room and then said it was the most  influential of his life. (Interpret that as you may). What is mentioned in  this doco but passed over quickly is Snr's notorious reputation for  shooting multiple takes of the same scene at different angles, so that he  could make decisions when editing, which the studios balked at because of  the cost of film exposed. (In this way, he was the opposite of Hitchcock,  who shot so that the film could only be edited one way - ie the way Hitch  had storyboarded it.) However all this seems worth it when you consider the  one-take long-shot of The Way You Look Tonight from the Astaire/Rogers  Swing Time (a lesson in how to shoot a dance number), and the beautiful  extreme closeups of Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift in A Place in the  Sun. Millie Perkins from The Diary of Anne Frank tells us that during their  shoot, Stevens always wore dark sunglasses and treated the actors in the  way he wanted them to perform. Since they were all meant to be frightened,  that doesn't sound too positive. Luckily for Perkins, her character was to  be loved. The perceived failure of The Greatest Story Ever Told also  deprives us of anything of his later film, The Only Game in Town, though  the discussion of his disagreement with Cecil B DeMille over Joseph L  Mankiewicz and the Directors Guild during McCarthyism is fascinating.",967334400,12,3553,4.694805194805195
