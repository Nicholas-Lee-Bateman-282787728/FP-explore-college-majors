2476344,4,B000E0OE44,"The generally warm and rewarding reception this movie has received demonstrates once more the slow but steadily advancing of the worthy Palestinian cause. The fact that it is no longer possible to simply debase a Palestinian view with nonsensical allegation of pro-terrorism and anti-Semitism, testifies to this. People are beginning to understand that Palestinians are more then just bomb plotting caricatures of human beings, hatching out their next hate filled anti-semitic and anti-western plot, but real bleeding and above all struggling people. Of course the other side of the medal paints the Israelis in less then a flattering light. But isn't this truth? Who would care to view an overly balanced and positive portrayal of a people or system holding up Apartheid in South Africa; or off racial segregation in the United States?

The story revolves around two Palestinian friends in Nablus, who are quite ordinary but whose future and lives are clouded by the tragic political reality surrounding them. They, like many young men in the West Bank, hope to somehow alter or influence this reality and the loss of dignity that goes with it. This hope for a better future and a more dignified existence makes them easy targets for recruitment as potential suicide bombers. This happens when they are recruited for a suicide mission in Telaviv. However, being human they struggle with their task and their inner struggle is given voice by Suha, a beautiful western educated Palestinian. The ending of the movie highlights the tragedy; senselessness and loss of human live in the conflict.

The weaknesses of this movie are that is made largely for a western audience, therefore avoiding any direct showing of Israeli violence and occupation. The female heroine Suha is by her education a pacifist and believer in the resistance of non-violence. This of course largely panders to the sentiments of a European and American audience and is somehow naive, but nonetheless politically correct. If pacifist ideals and rationality were truly so inherently western in core, then widespread support of the Palestinians, not including suicide bombers, and condemnation of Israeli practices and occupation would have been much more common. But these supposed weakneses are understandable and ready to made compromises.

Facing the film and its message are widespread apathy, ignorance and hatred towards a perceived entity called ""the Arabs"". The larger part of this cruel attitude comes from an American audience. Angered by the film for humanizing Palestinians, therefore dehumanizing their own arrogant worldview, they lash out at the film for supposedly supporting terrorism. Never minding that this is exactly what the film does not do, it would suffice to say that the same audience were likely standing in line and rooting for ""True Lies"" and ""Rules of Engagement"". Violence seems to be always righteous and good when condoned by ""us"". From this point of view the Palestinian position, demonstrated in this film, is much more Humane and less ethically warped.",1137888000,21,3058,5.262295081967213
2476345,5,B000E0OE44,"In the movie Paradise Now, Saeed is asked to smile by a photographer. The photographer insists, Saeed persists in his refusal to smile. Meet Saeed, a young man living in Nablus in the occupied territories.

Ironically, Saeed means happy in Arabic.

While I spent time in occupied territories, I could always tell the difference between the locals and the foreigners. The ones the grew up there and the ones that were visiting. The local ones rarely, if ever smiled. The ones visiting from abroad smiled liberally, when greeting you, when saying goodbye, when talking about something funny and for no reason at all.

Then we meet Suha, she smiles lots. Guess what? ... she grew up in France. People are nice to her because she is the daughter of a martyr and a hero, also she is cute.

In a Hollywood movie, Suha would make Saeed smile by the end of the movie, at one point you think that surly the movie is going in that direction.

So many similarities with a Hollywood movie

There is a cute leading female.

Two guys dressed in a black suits, which reminded me of the Men In Black movie and the Blues Brothers movie.

Suspense.

One quarter into the movie the suspense was so high, that my friend who came to see the movie with me looked like she couldn't take it. I offered to hold her hand. For about five minutes we both forgot about the north American rule that females are not supposed to hold hands in public and behaved like we would in the middle east despite the fact that my friend is not middle eastern, we held hands. She looked at me and whispered, you must find this even more distressing than I do, I nodded with my head to say that I am ok. I wanted to tell her that everything in this movie is familiar, the language, the mentality, the way people talk, I have seen it all before, only in real life. It must be distressing to be exposed to all this within 15 minutes.

My favorite scene in the Blues Brothers is when they are going around looking for the other members of their band. They knock on a door and a lady with hair curlers opens the doors. She looks at the two men wearing black suits and asks them

lady in hair curlers: Are you guys with the FBI?

Blues Brothers: No Ma'am. We are on a mission from God. We are musicians.

That scene cracks me up each time I see it.

Saeed and his friend are not sure if they are on a mission from god or not. When they discuss the nature of their mission, they don't seem sure if god is behind it or not. You wish they were religious crazy fanatics on a mission from god ...... that is the lie that we have been told in western media, time and again ..... surprise! ...... they are not. Religion plays a role ..... but a very small role in the events that are about to take place.

Paradise Now is not a Hollywood movie

No happy ending

No violence

No car chase scene

No sex

One small brief episode of swearing and it is very brief indeed

As I watched the movie, I wished I could have reach out to Saeed to shake his shoulder. I wished I could tell him, ""Saeed! you are young and beautiful, your whole life is ahead of you, don't throw it away"". Suha tries hard to play the audience's voice in that movie. She even speaks Arabic with a funny accent to mark her foreignness and out-sidedness. She is treated with polite decorum, but nothing she says seems to address the realities on the ground. She is there in person, but far removed at the same time.

When the movie ended there was complete silence in the whole movie theater. You could have heard a pin drop. In most movies, you can hear the tidbits of conversation about the movie as you walk out. Again, as we walked out, there was complete and stunned silence. Nobody was saying anything, not even to their mobile phone. Everybody was completely and utterly stunned by the movie and so overwhelmed with what they just saw they were speechless.

In short, absolutely brilliant. If you are planning to see it, prepare to see a truly thought provoking movie that will rock your world.",1137542400,34,4011,4.340026773761713
2476346,1,B000E0OE44,"murders.  This movie is the story of two prospective mass murderers.  The film gives their mission of death more meaning that any civilized society should ever grant.  This is the story of the same type of individuals that create bombs, surround them with nails, then go onto buses and explode themselves into the innocence of children.  The movie attempt to show these men as gun makers, vs the actual mass murderers using the guns.

Imagine the minds of those who seek to gain attention by the organized and orchestrated slaughter of innocent life.

This is the story of localized genocide, by a group of individuals that has sworn oaths to destroy Israel.

This movie glorifies that same sort of conduct that was the mindset of 9-11 bombers.  As if any human being beyond a rabid sociopath would think its acceptable to blow up life.

This movie is story of a cancer eating out civilization, and exposure to it, is a mind warping degeneration of the mind.

The film's goal is not of understanding, but instead tries to get the viewers to accept that terrorizing civilians by blowing up children is a valid for political expression.  Though the movie claims to not be a validation of the tactic of terrorism against innocent life, its very nature and topic validate mindset of these genocidal mass murders.

The movie attempts to show these evil intentions and plans without becoming part of it.  But it can not.  Sympathy to those who would blow up children, is granting the PLO tactics of death squads.

I would give it less than one star, if I could.

THE POINT SHOULD BE:  Not what are these men are thinking, but rather what would you think if these men took over your child's school, and blew them up.

I reccommend everyone AVOID viewing this film, its a cancer to to mind, and destruction of one's own soul.",1137542400,38,1817,4.660377358490566

2476376,5,B000E0OE44,"Paradise Now is a beautifully shot film and directed film that immerses you completely in the mind and morals of a Palestinian suicide bomber. This experience, while startling, is clearly not for everyone, and neither is this movie. But for those unafraid to explore some different, highly disturbing mindsets and help understand the many small humiliations that lead to seemingly senseless acts of violence, Paradise Now is well worth watching.

Directed by Hany Abu-Assad, this film plunges the watcher directly into the Israeli- Palestinian conflict. Said and Khaled are two lifelong friends who live a hardscrabble life in Nablus. Oppressed by the occupation, they seem to be stuck in dead end jobs and given few options due primarily to prejudice and discrimination on the part of the Israeli occupiers. Their days (it is clear long before one character points it out) are a lesson in deadening boredom.

So when the two are chosen by a Palestinian terrorist group to carry out a suicide bombing in Israel they are only too happy to accept. The rest of the film focuses on the fateful days the young men are to carry out their mission: their preparations, their last wishes, and their states, mental and physical. We soon see that Khaled is only too happy to carry out the mission--he believes he is unquestionably right and on a mission from God. But Said is more unsure; he continually questions whether what he is about to do is morally right. The films main focus is whether Khaled and Said will fulfill their suicide mission, or walk away.

For those looking for a fair, balanced look at the Israeli Palestinian conflict that presents recognizably human characters from both sides, should not look to this movie. In Paradise Now, Abu-Assad places the viewer directly in the consciousness of the two Palestinian suicide bombers, and we see all Israelis as he sees them: as oppressors. There are hardly any Israelis with speaking roles; those who do emerge do so very briefly, and are fairly stereotypical and unsympathetic. Mostly, the Israelis seem like the nameless, faceless enemy--far removed from our heroes and the ""real life"" of Nabulus. This is a positive thing in that it helps further allow viewers to see the world as Said and Khaled see it. However, it also feels fairly manipulative on the filmmakers part in that it allows viewers to easily sympathize with Said's planned actions, to view their ""taking out as many Israelis as possible"" as a heroic act of protest, rather than a senseless mass murder.

It's worth noting that Hany Abu-Asad, the writer and director, has said in interviews that ""Israelis are hated for a reason,"" and declared that had his background been different, he, too, may have ended up a suicide bomber. This is somewhat understandable given his background, however, one wonders if it makes for a less than fair-minded movie. Suha, who serves as the voice of reason, does discourage the young men from going through with their bombing. However, it is worth noting that during her speeches against the act, she frequently argues that Said should not go through with it because ""it will give Israelis an alibi for further violence against us."" She never once mentions that they shouldn't do it because the act is wrong in that it murders innocent people.

Ultimately, though, the movie is fair in its own way--- it presents us with an honest view from one perspective. I would highly recommend Paradise Now for those who enjoy thoughtful, well-made films with serious subject matter.",1419638400,4,3527,4.940978077571669

Why would anyone volunteer for this mission?  What do you think of and do the night before?  Do you question yourself?  Do you see the world, and other people, differently when walking around with explosives strapped around your waist?

This movie is about choices, not politics.  The political issues are not debatable to these young men; their choices are.  Will they carry out their assignments?  You'll need to watch to the very end... there are some surprises.

Obviously, there is a great deal of horror that goes with any bombing, let alone killing civilians, soldiers, and yourself.  A movie that hasn't been made is the tale of the Emergency First Responders that show up on the scene.  Can you picture anything more terrible?

What's important is what's on the screen, not what's pre-conceived in your head, and this time I could appreciate it for the excellent, intelligent, emotionally and morally complex and challenging film it is.

2476425,3,B000E0OE44,"I remember the 2005 Oscar race.  It was one of the first `awards seasons' that I actually watched closely and so when it came time for the awards to be handed out I actually had a pretty good handle on who the eventual winners were going to be (I even predicted the `Crash' upset in Best Picture, despite most prognosticators saying that the `buzz' was merely media trying to insert some tension into a sewn up race).  With foreign film, it really looked like `Paradise Now' was going to walk away with the prize.  It had good word of mouth, decent reviews and the themes were very relevant and of social discussion.  All indicators pointed North and yet, with this particular category there is really never a sure thing (if that were the case then `The White Ribbon', `Pan's Labyrinth' and `Amelie' would all have won).  Yes, if there is EVER a true surprise at the Oscars, it comes here.

So, in like fashion, `Paradise Now' lost to `Tsotsi'.

While I am most certainly not a great advocate for this particular film (which I'll get into in a moment), I must say that it is leaps and bounds better than `Tsotsi', which is one of the WORST film of the aughts.  Honestly, the foreign film category is often a misleading indicator of the quality of the films made overseas in that year because the rules restrict a lot of films from even being nominated.  The cream of the crop is often ineligible (in 2005 `Cache' was probably the best film of that given year, and it was ruled ineligible for a nomination) or isn't even nominated.  I mean, 2005 had greats like the aforementioned `Cache' as well as the powerful `Le'Enfant' and `2046'.

None of them were even nominated.

Alas, we aren't really here to discuss this; it was just a thought I had at the moment.  The film, `Paradise Now', discusses the controversial subject of suicide bombers.  This is done in a more direct and realistic tone than the recent `Four Lions', which is (for the sake of discussion) a far better film than this one.  With all its seriousness, `Paradise Now' fails to feel truly connected to its core.  I think the main issue comes from the direction, which gives the film a very `made for television' feel.  It lacks the gritty earthiness needed to convey a theme so rich with subtext.  Instead, the film feels dry and merely surface; not deep-rooted.  Even when the finale comes and the audience is supposed to drop their jaws it doesn't come as an impactful surprise.  It feels predictably clich.  The ending is a minor saving grace, considering that the bulk of the film feels generically manipulative.  Even the circumstances surrounding the `doubts' flooding into the newly appointed martyrs feel staged and unrealistic; or, even if they are realistic they feel uninspired and predictable.

The film isn't all bad though.  There is some tension clearly present, even if it is manipulated, and the performances (debut at that) by the two stars are very well done.  I wish I had more to praise though.  The film isn't `bad', it's just mediocre; and mediocre shouldn't win awards.",1317945600,,3060,4.6835205992509366

2476427,5,B000E0OE44,"""Paradise Now"" is a wonderful foreign film about two Palestinian men who hesitate on carrying out a terrorist attack in Israel. The story is pretty well thought out, the scenery is lovely, and the ending is definitely an interesting one. And while it does imply violent situations, you do not actually see any on the screen. This movie should be seen by any fan of foreign movies.

A few reviewers criticized the movie because they thought the movie promoted terrorism. While everyone has a right to feel however they would like, I personally didn't think the makers of the film wanted to encourage people to engage in suicide bombings to fight for what they believe in. There are hundreds of movies out there about drugs, rapes, and underground criminal activity, but I don't think any of them actually promotes its viewers to go out and mimic the characters' bad behaviors. You can even tell the main character, Said, was having second thoughts about going through with the bombing, because he saw an innocent, young child on the bus and realized it would be morally wrong to kill him. Furthermore, if the movie was pro-terrorism, the character Suha wouldn't have urged the men to abort the mission, reasoning that if they carry out the attack, it will just give Israel more reason to keep Palestinians under their thumb. I identified with Suha's character, and this movie didn't justify terrorist attacks to me.

What this movie did do was make me think critically about the issue, and hopefully it will do the same for you. If the men had more economic opportunities, for instance, cost-benefit analysis would have stopped them from planning to blow themselves up. If the Palestinians had their own army, underground operations like those would be much less common.

I think the movie could have done a better job showing more examples of the injustice the men were fighting against, but otherwise it was a great movie.",1306886400,,1923,4.8567073170731705
2476428,5,B000E0OE44,"Suicide bombing is portrayed as a sad option for Palestinian youth with few opportunities.  The main character is not driven by the expectation of a wonderful afterlife, or by religious or political fanaticism.  He is led along this path by subtle cultural undercurrents--such as family honor.

This film has its humorous moments--as when the leader of the local terrorist cell munches a sandwich during the numerous takes of the videotaped oration/epitath of one of the characters who has chosen to become a bomber.

2476448,5,B000E0OE44,"There's not enough that can be said about the insane motivations of suicide bombers, but Hany Abu-Assad's powerful ""Paradise Now"" is the closest I have seen to this point. It's a sad account of two sad young men who have been brainwashed into thinking martyrdom will aid the cause of the cowards who decide their fate. When push comes to shove, they both have second thoughts, and the outcome is left to the imagination of the viewer; regardless, it's upsetting and usettling. The preciousness of life--ALL life--is examined, and the futility of it all is quite well addressed. ""Paradise Now"" is an excellent film on many levels. Aside from its profound subject matter and the fine direction, the acting from all is excellent, especially from our two lead characters,Sad (Kais Nashif) and Khaled (Ali Suliman). Filmed on location in the West Bank, production values are above average for an Indie film; generous close-ups are frequent, adding a very personal tone to the film. Though it's a small faction of Muslim unrest, one cannot deny that the suicide idea is to be dealt with, though I'm sure it will never be understood. I, personally, choose to praise a God who holds life as precious, not to randomly destroy it; to think of this world not as it is, but as it ought to be.",1300233600,,1280,4.744394618834081

2476450,5,B000E0OE44,"PARADISE NOW opens windows of information to those of us who do not live in the Middle East and who toil over understanding the strife that daily bitterly continues, bruising the lives of both ends of the polarity that separates the peoples of the region. Are there ever to be answers or solutions to the crises? For this viewer watching and absorbing PARADISE NOW is illuminating in that it removes the expected political preaching to focus on the minds of the people living under the daily stress of life at its most difficult. Taking us there, making ideas into people with all the convictions and rebelliousness and fragility, writer/director Hany Abu-Assad (with Bero Beyer) offers invaluable insights and in the end we are left with a story about humanity and the consequences of decisions, and the desperate need for peace.

Said (Kais Nashef) and Khaled (Ali Suliman) are childhood friends in Palestine who have been elected to be suicide bombers in an attack on Tel Aviv. Their election to be martyrs for the destruction of the 'invaders' is considered an honor: their deaths will bring glory to their country, their families, and guarantee them instant entry into heaven. We see the two men as citizens living in the dusty hovels, facing barricades and checkpoints that make their lives ones of constant stress. Martyrdom will bring them peace and eternal rest. The entire process of preparing the elected martyrs, from making farewell videotapes for their parents, to having their hair cut short, to having the bombs strapped to their bodies, to dressing them in black suits for the 'wedding' they are instructed to claim to attend in Tel Aviv, to sending them off at the designated spot is relentlessly filmed. Said and Khaled accept their roles although with varying degrees of emotional commitment. At the point where the lads are to begin their martyrdom venture they are separated and the story is how each continues living, each now alone.

The families and the perpetrators of the scheme are well drawn by a strong cast, with one female role Suha (Lubna Azabal) as a voice of reason and peace standing out particularly strongly. The sensitivity of the actors Kais Nashef and Ali Suliman keeps this drama from sinking into politicism and instead allows us to understand the inner turmoil of the two men they portray as they cope with their duties and their lives.

This is a powerful document that serves as a plea for peace wherever terrorism is a factor - and now that is global. If more of us could watch and absorb films such as PARADISE NOW perhaps the itinerant boundaries separating mankind by misunderstanding could be reduced without the need for war. Highly Recommended.

I had read the script, and pictured the two leads played by much younger people, which I imagined would give the film a deep sense of the tragedy of the loss of innocence.  So I was disappointed when I first saw the finished project.

But that's not a fair way to judge a film.  What's important is what's on the screen, not what's pre-conceived in your head, and this time I could appreciate it for the excellent, intelligent, emotionally and morally complex and challenging film it is.  Any film that can make suicide bombers 'human', without justifying their actions, or can really make you understand the roots of violence and terrorism without condoning for a moment it is an important film for the modern world, and an important film to see.

Beyond that, its finely crafted, with terrific performances, and directed to create amazing levels of tension, without feeling manipulative.",1286409600,2,968,4.871951219512195
2476452,4,B000E0OE44,"I included some of the movie's dialog to get the prospective viewer interested in certain aspects of the movie. So if that is a spoiler for you, please stop here!

Said and Khaled are young Palestinian friends who are recruited to go on a suicide bombing mission against the Israelis. During their scary journey of decision they express their emotional struggle when contemplating the possibility of killing innocent whilst remembering their oppressed past and hopeless future.

The brain washing used to recruit young men that plays on their pain and beliefs, like bacteria on an open wound, are shown through many discussions like what the recruiter said:"" What can you do when there is no justice or freedom? Then there's the individual that is forced to fight for it. If we give in to the law that says, the strong devour the weak, then we become the animals. That's intolerable. Death is better than inferiority. That means whoever fights for freedom, can also die for it.""

The two friends strike a friendship with one of the guys love interest who is an open minded and educated woman. Dialog is the main tool in the movie to describe how difficult it is to get humans to let go of their hatred. The erudite young lady argues with them: ""That's no sacrifice. That's revenge. If you kill, there's no difference between victim and occupier.""

The dialog again shows how young men face the decision of killing themselves and others as Said puts it: ""Even worse, they've convinced the world and themselves that they are the victims. How can that be? How can the occupier be the victim? If they take on the role of oppressor and victim then I have no other choice but to also be a victim and a murderer as well. I don't know how you'll decide, but I will not return to the refugee camp.""

Eventually, the conversations become simply cold lectures, but some credit should be given to the honesty and truthfulness while exploring the problem of suicide attacks. This is an attempt to convince the extreme Palestinians to snap out of physical fighting and ponder the thought of dialogue and civilized thinking.

2476454,5,B000E0OE44,"I had read or heard about this Arabic language movie, and I was very interested so I bought a copy.  Just as an aside, I told a coworker and friend that I had purchased the film.  He is Egyptian and the movie had a special interest for him.  We made a night of it, his wife and mother prepared a traditional Egyptian dinner and we watched the movie with his wife and his parents.  He sent the kids to their rooms, although now I do not believe that to have been necessary.

It is a story about two friends in Palestine that decide to become suicide bombers.  <!--more-->It explores why they would take such an action.  The Western mind has a hard time comprehending this course of action.  The movie paints of picture of two sympathetic individuals in an impossible situation without any real hope.

It also delves a little into the ""characters"" that recruit these young men (and of late women) for these suicide missions.  It is not a pretty or complimentary picture.  They make even used car salesmen seem honorable.

It in small ways demonstrates the frustrations and indignations of living in Palestine when most things are ultimately controlled by the Israelis.

While you would think this would be a violent and bloody movie, it is not.  What violence there is, is implied or left to the viewer's imagination.

I still do not think suicide bombing is right or the solution to anything, but the movie did give me some insight into why it happens.  It gave me insight into a different side of the Palestine/Israel conflict than I receive from the American media.

It is well worth watching for those reasons, and it is a well made movie to boot.  Go rent it or buy it.

1.  You can't bring on peace by committing violent acts; and
2.  If you truly want to help your family, stick around and stay alive for them.

The actors are excellent here, the photography is nicely done, and the director wisely chooses not to be too graphic in the depictions of what these men set out to do.  It's better to imply than to be explicit in this case.

2476456,1,B000E0OE44,"General Observations:
The film is originally in Arabic with voice-over in English, poorly done with little or no proximity effect in the audio.
The acting quality is often poor or ""cheesy.""
The plot is monolithic: A one-note theme of martyrdom's cause.

General Themes:
- Palestinians are victims oppressed by evil ""Jewish Settlers."" The movie clearly evokes the sympathy of the viewer toward the Palestinian ""plight"" and gives a platform for contempt for the Jews. No attempt is made to provide a balanced view of Israeli rights or sufferings under decades of terrorist attacks.
- Weak ""collaborators"" (those who reveal Palestinian terrorists or terror plots) versus strong ""martyrs"" (those who become Palestinian terrorists or suicide bombers)
- The just cause of ""resistance"" against the ""never-ending occupation"" of the Jewish State. Clearly the Palestinian argument is promoted that Israel does not have the right to exist.
- The conscience of the ""cause"" is greater and more noble than the conscience against it
- Said (the suicide bomber) is earning back the honor his father lost when he became a ""collaborator""
- The struggle to do the will of Allah

Significant Lines:
- ""Kill the collaborators, their families, their neighbors and their friends"" (this represents a position validating the execution of collaborating Palestinians by Palestinians)
- Jamal, the recruiter philosophizes at length the rationale for suicide bombings with phrases like ""It's time to answer the assassination of [a political prisoner]""
- ""You must be very proud of Abu Hazan(?). Because of what he did, our cause is still alive."" (a suicide bomber)
- ""Either accept inferiority or let me die as a martyr.""
- ""Under the occupation we're already dead.""
- ""If you feel weak [having doubts about the terrorist act] read the Koran and pray.""
- The ""settlers"" (Jews) ""polluted the water to lower our sperm count.""
- Did Said ""betray us by not carrying out the mission?""
- ""At least we will die as equals.""
- ""Israel has no morals.""

Significant Scenes or References:
- The recruiters for young and impressionable men to become terrorists plot the day and time for others to die for the ""cause."" They secure ""work licenses"" in Israel, the contacts and the explosives. They promise instant martyrdom and the glory and honor that they and their families will receive. They also enjoy a pita snack while video taping the last words of one of their martyr recruits.
- The projection of the terrorists backgrounds is that of nice, wholesome families and good people, but all oppressed by the ""occupation"" of the evil Jews.
- Extremist actions such as burning down a theater in Israel is justified because ""the Jews decided not to hire workers from the West Bank.""
- Israeli atrocities are suggested such as breaking the leg of a Palestinian resister asking him, ""which leg he would like to keep.""
- A local video store in Nablus sells and rents videos of the ""martyrs"" last words before their fatal deed - usually glorifying Allah and justifying their cause in front of a flag while holding a machine gun or strapped to a bomb. The store also rents or sells videos of the execution of the discovered ""collaborators"" and their last words. The storeowner suggests that the ""collaborators"" executions are in greater demand.
- Said's father is assumed to have been a collaborator and was executed by the Palestinians. Yet it is clear that Said blames the Jews who ""used his [father's] weakness.""
- The would-be martyrs are blessed by religious rituals including a ""last supper"" recreation with Jamal (the recruiter and Jihadist philosopher) at the center (reminiscent of Jesus and His disciples).
- Abu Kharim (sp?), the primary leader of the unnamed ""resistance"" movement, shows up on the scene to congratulate and bless the honor of their martyrdom and is venerated as ""The Legend."" He assures them that after the deed, ""we will commemorate your success"" and your ""families will be honored.""
- Jewish soldiers are projected as cowards who ""won't put themselves at risk"" and will shoot the suicide bombers ""at a distance"" because ""he is afraid of death.""
- The assurance of Jamal to the would-be martyrs is that immediately after their deed, ""two angels are there to greet you.""
- The terrorist, Said, is portrayed as having a sensitive, benevolent conscience as he chooses not to blow up a bus filled with women and children. In the final scene, however, Said is shown on a second bus with soldiers (and that is the camera focus) and innocent civilians in the background. Said has now overcomes the temptations to turn back. The camera zooms in on Said's face that appears to reflect newfound peace and determination. We don't see the explosion or the carnage, but it is clear what happens as the screen suddenly goes white rather than fading to black.

Review:

This is not only a poor film, but also an unveiled attempt to persuade the viewer of the desperation of the Palestinian - that, in fact, they are an oppressed people who have no other weapon than that of terrorism. The suicide bombers are victims, not murderers.

Anti-Semitism is rampant throughout the movie and no rebuttal is even attempted. Jews are portrayed as evil ""settlers,"" and immoral oppressors who have no right to ""occupy"" the Middle East...or to exist.

I find it appalling that such unveiled propaganda was up for several awards. This is neither art nor entertainment. At best, this is fodder for extremism and, at worst, promotes terrorism.",1258761600,16,5493,4.970620239390642
2476457,5,B000E0OE44,"There is not much else I can say about the film that has not already been said. Truly interesting film.

However, I can say that if you look at the negative reviews that have been posted here, you will not find anything bad about the actual film. Most, if not all, the negative reviews are political in nature. The reviewers have focused more on the message (or lack thereof) of the movie. There are no helpful reviews critiquing the acting, cinematography, character development, etc. This is an interesting, finely made film. Whether or not this film glorifies terrorism is irrelevant; what is more important is whether or not the scenes are executed properly. Do these types of conversations happen among these terrorists? Do ""some"" Palestinians see these terrorists as heroes? Do these terrorists have friends and families? The difference here is that these terrorists are given a face.

I can see why some people are offended by this film. It is indeed controversial, as this is the first time I have seen a film where the terrorists are given a ""face"". Movies like United 93 do not go into detail on how the terrorists ended up on their mission. Paradise Now focuses completely on how these terrorists ended up on this mission, and that is where the controversy stems from. You may be angry after you see this film, you may even be repulsed. But that is what makes this film so interesting. Highly recommended.",1249344000,,1416,4.775510204081633
2476478,2,B000E0OE44,"Being from Israel, this movie is bound to affect me in different ways. Hearing that this was about the Palestinian point of view, I mostly expected bias, but I simply had to watch this out of an intense curiosity to understand. I very much needed to get some insight regarding the people that are trying to kill me every day.

The movie's prime objective is to put a human face on the suicide bombers and to explain why they feel this is necessary. This is a good thing. I WANT to see these people as human beings and I want to understand them.

Two aspiring martyrs and one more peaceful-minded Arab girl influenced by Westerners are the protagonists. Their daily lives are explored, the constant tension and presence of the barriers and Israeli soldiers is shown, they play, work, discuss their existence and humiliations, and disagree on how to achieve freedom. Palestinian society is shown to glorify the bombers and decry collaborators as the ultimate humiliation, with home-made movies containing their last words being sold as populist entertainment (both martyrs and collaborators).

When it's time for our protagonist to make his own impassioned video, the camera breaks down, then he inserts a reminder for his mother about water filters. The procedure to convert this human who is just like us into a killer is shown to be a well-oiled machine run by professionals who are seen as legendary heroes of society. They are trained on everything from the mindset they need, to the technicalities of the bomb, to the technical fact that two angels will pick them up and take them to heaven as soon as they die. One bombing attempt goes wrong, the bombers suffer plenty of second thoughts and moral questions, they are affected by the sight of children, and finally, they go after paradise because they are driven into a corner, desperate and frustrated and want to go to heaven.

And now comes the discussion: Is the movie objective? Are the anti-Israel speeches made by the protagonist or by the director? Many reviewers claim this movie is objective and presents two sides; but the only two sides are on differing ways to fight the occupation of Israel.

The occupation is presented as an absolute evil, and the Israelis are claimed to have no morals by both 'sides'. The Israelis are after ethnic cleansing and the humiliation and control of Palestinians, but, claims the peace-loving girl, by bombing them up 'we are merely giving them an excuse to continue killing and humiliating us'. How on earth is this objective? It's a trick. By presenting a relatively moderate point of view, it gives the feeling of balance.

Here are some objective and verifiable facts to balance out the propaganda in this film: When the land was split into two nations, the first thing Palestinians did was attack. They lost (just barely), and Egypt and Jordan occupied their land for 20 years. When Palestinians attacked Jordan, they were killed and driven out by Jordanians and promptly went to make a bigger mess in Lebanon. When Egypt and Jordan attacked Israel, Israel took the Palestinian land from them. When Israel offered land for peace, they refused to talk and attacked again a few years later. Israel continues to occupy land that has been repeatedly used for aggression and murder, and every time peace talks are initiated, the Palestinians increase their attacks. When Israel forces out settlers to give them Gaza, instead of bulding a nation, they use it to attack Israel even harder.

And then we have the official Palestinian government's (Hamas) charter that says Israel does not have a right to exist, it must be destroyed, and that all talks with Israel are useless and bad. This is in writing and can be verified by anyone and yet the majority of Palestinians voted for Hamas and support suicide bombing. Even the word 'Palestine' is a symbol of occupation forced by Romans over the Jews. There were Jewish 'Palestinians' in this land continously for thousands of years way before the Muslims even existed, and yet we are occupiers? We have no right to exist? The only reason there were fewer Jews than Arabs here is because they were repeatedly thrown out or killed, and weren't allowed back in.

One serious mistake Israel made was to allow settlements on this land before the issues and partitions were settled. But if the Arabs had negotiated for peace back in the 1970s, the settlements wouldn't have had a chance to spread. And when push came to shove, Sharon uprooted settlements for the Palestinians in Gaza.

I and most other Israelis want the 'Palestinians' to have their land and freedom. I want to respect them, to treat them as neighbours, to trade with them. But every time we turn to them for peace, we get bombed. Yes, the barriers, curfews, and occupations are evil. But without them we get bombed every day. History has proven this over and over again. Every time we pull out they launch another attack. Every time we give them something, they use it against us to kill us. When they do get land they show no interest in building an economy and a nation, only to attack. So we have no choice but to keep 'humiliating' them. Otherwise we'd be dead. It's their official policy to kill us when we turn to them for peace. This is a fact, in writing, supported by a majority of their citizens, AND proven a dozen times over by history.

So going back to the movie: If what the movie shows is truly what Palestinians feel and think, and all they see is the occupation and Israeli soldiers ruining their lives and taking away their freedom, then it is an amazing phenomenon of blind rage that doesn't know when to quit or when to try alternatives. I agree that we are humiliating and killing them, but have they given us a choice?

I watched this movie to understand them, and now, unfortunately, I do. For this reason, I recommend this movie. But, as opposed to what another reviewer said, to understand is not to forgive.

I hope one day the Palestinians will understand our point of view. That we are willing to give them their own state and freedom as long as they don't want us dead and that they make us believe that over 60 years of continuous blind rage and religious hate are over. You want your own state? Then next time we come to you to talk peace for the umpteenth time, call a cease-fire, recognize us as potential neighbours and stop killing our children.

To give ones life just to hurt the other side - that's a pretty intense hate. BUT NO, that's not it at all. It's the idea of freedom. The same idea which created America. They are freedom fighters reduced to using the most precious thing a person possesses because they have little else.

I was stunned at the difference between the Israeli life and the Palestinians lives. It was like I stepped back in time, when in Palestine. The Palestinian side put me in mind of the Biblical Palestine that Jesus walked.

 It was so enlightening to find out that their decision was NOT just hysterical fanatism as it's always portrayed in the Pro- Israeli media,
BUT RATHER a surgical strike against injustice.

My most favorite and thoughtful line in the entire film was when SAID explained to SUHA that the resistance is defined by the occupation and when he pointed out that they are the occupiers, oppressors, bulldozers but yet they are the victims! Ha, what a gross miscarriage of justice!

This film really opened my eyes to the ""other side"". My church, my schools, my neighborhood and town have all been awakened and are now looking deeper than just what the media tries to spoon feed us.

2476483,4,B000E0OE44,"Aside from the obvious political messages and issues surrounding suicide bombings, this movie provides some glimpses of life in the West Bank. It is of course a powerful movie that makes one think of what it must be like for a person to be so desperate as to accept suicide operations as an only choice. There is plenty of commentary about the circumstances Palestinians find themselves in, be it the shame of having a family member cooperate with the Israelis, the shame of having had the Israelis invade one's house, the lack of fresh water, the difficulty in finding good jobs, the inability to move freely from place to place or the many other little things that affect the daily lives of people in the West Bank. American audiences might recognize two of the main actors from the Hollywood film, The Kingdom here. That's sort of typical of Palestinian-Israeli films. The pool of actors is somewhat small and the same ones show up in many movies.

The plot of this movie follows approximately two days in the lives of a couple of young Palestinian men who are friends. It begins with one of them losing his job and proceeds to cover the twists and turns of planning for a suicide mission that becomes available. Some of the ups and downs have to do with circumstances beyond the characters' control and some involve emotional stress that comes up as the mission progresses. After a false start, things fall into place and we see the two characters on their way to Tel Aviv. The ending of the movie is left intentionally ambiguous and may seem to some as a cop-out, but it is really the best ending that could have been chosen. It does not detract from the meaningful emotional buildup. Many Palestinian movies have this kind of ending and in a way it's appropriate because the types of trials and tribulations that Palestinians often face do not resolve themselves in real life. Things just keep going on the same way they always have. I'm not sure how realistic the actual story is, but I think most of the elements of the movie speak to basic realities these people face.",1226102400,2,2077,4.644021739130435

There's nothing but rubble, bombs and check points and the daily grind of trying to exist.  This movie doesn't take sides and it's really hard to understand how people who co-existed in this region for hundreds of years are now mortal enemies.  Where do you start to understand.  This movie doesn't try either but rather it attempts to put a face to these young men whom you are used to seeing in the media.  After going thru with the preparation for Jihad Said and Khaled hit a snag and had to turn back which gives these two time to think about wether they really want to go thru with this.  The tension and suspense leading up to the conclusion is both sad and telling.  For one of them, the reason for doing it is to erase the shame of his father being a colaborator and the shame of having to live like a common animal under occupation.

At the end of the movie, the credits rolled without music or fanfare of any kind. For the first two to three minutes of those credits, not a soul stirred nor spoke. The audience just sat there in stunned silence. One person stood to leave and the rest of us then followed like lemmings, but still, there was not a sound. People left the theatre as if they were leaving a gravesite; silent, reverent and stunned by loss.

If the chance presents itself, you need to walk, run or crawl to your nearest theatre when this film is offered.

But knowing that, get to the movie, and deal with the soul damage later. Dealing with that damage is part of the experience. In the film, the director does not take a stand pro or con, he leaves that to the audience.

2476487,4,B000E0OE44,"Some movies tend to stuff the idealogy down our throats and yet, this movie raises more questions than answers.  We are accustomed to read about the conflict between Israel and Palestine in the news but seldom do we see it from Palestinian's perspective.  The story premise is simple enough about two childhood friends who decide to become martyrs.  They make it clear that since they cannot be regarded as equals with Israel in life, they may just as well regard themselves as equals with Israel in death by killing as many Israeli soldiers as possible through suicide bombing.  Here, there's this lady by the name of Suha whose father is hailed as a hero (suicide bomber) and yet, she belongs to a human rights group.  She believes that violence doesn't resolve the conflict and the best way to win is by reasoning through morality.  Said, one of the suicide bomber partakes in the scheme because he yearns to be ridden of his father's label as a collaborator.  His best friend eventually comes to realisation that their action would achieve nothing.  I guess that it's hard to reason sensibly when your living environment is oppressed and that Palestinians are humiliated and treated as occupied prisoners when not too far away, Tel Aviv leads a rather comfortable lifestyle.

2476495,4,B000E0OE44,"This film is a character study of would-be suicide bombers.  From the bombers' perspective, the main themes are Israel as ""occupier"", Palestinians as humiliated, ""occupation"" as perpetuating ""resistance"", and the human body as the only weapon left to Palestinians.  These are bleak themes, wrapped in the poverty and squalor of decimated Palestinian urban landscapes.

Each of the two would-be bombers expresses doubts about their mission, showing they're reflective, thinking beings, not one-dimensional automatons.  Frighteningly though, neither is distinct in any meaningful way, suggesting any of a thousand men (or women) could replace them.

There are many poignant moments in this film, but the most striking for me is when Suha, a well-educated intellectual woman, asks one of the bombers ""what will happen to the rest of us left behind?""  The painful message is that everyday Palestinians who would pursue peace through non-violent means are marginalized by those who believe violence is the only viable terms of engagement with Israel.",1198886400,3,1045,5.540880503144654

2476524,3,B000E0OE44,"The film ""Paradise Now"" presents a compelling story of forty-eight hours in the life of two young Palestinian men who are selected to carry out a suicide attack in Tel Aviv, Israel. The plot focuses on childhood friends Khaled and Said who are living a difficult life under the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. The two friends work dead-end jobs at a local auto repair shop and place much of the blame for their difficult situation on Israel.  After a long day at work, Said is approached by one of the leaders of the Palestinian resistance and told that he and Khaled have been selected to carry out an ""operation"" against Israel. As the story continues, the two friends contemplate the ethicality of their decision and struggle to decide whether or not to carry out their mission.

Artistically speaking, this film was done very well. There is excellent character development of the two friends, Said and Khaled. During their struggle to accomplish their mission the two friends question their own motives and the legitimacy of resorting to violence to solve a problem. The arguments posed in the film are also extremely relevant to the current conflict between Israel and Palestine. Through the characters of Said and Khaled, the director, Hany Abu-Assad, discusses controversial issues such as the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the legitimacy of Palestinian suicide bombers. Having recently spent time in Israel, this film provided insight to the struggles of the Palestinian people. Many of the views conveyed toward Israel are understandable considering the low quality of life that Palestinians experience. I appreciated that this film pushed me to re-consider my own opinions toward this issue. Any successful piece of artwork forces audience members to think about the issue, and this film did just that. Having said this, ""Paradise Now"" also encouraged me to look at both sides of the issue, which is necessary in order to formulate an opinion about any issue.

Where I felt this film fell short was the context, or lack there of, that this story was placed in. Although this film is a good way for outsiders to understand the situation from the Palestinian point of view, my fear is that this fuels ignorance towards Israel and its people. ""Paradise Now"" provides no historical look at how the situation between Israel and Palestine has come to be. There is no reference to the original U.N. partition plan of 1948 in which the land of Israel was divided evenly between Jews and Palestinians. The only reference given to Israel is that of an occupying force, rather than a legitimate country, which overlooks the accomplishments that Israel has had in the last sixty years. Israel is constantly referred to as being an oppressive society, and at one point that it ""has no morals"" in terms of its military actions. The only reference given to Israel being provoked by suicide bombers is through the character of Suha. Suha is a moderate-minded young woman that Said falls in love with just before he sets off to carry out the attack. Although Suha does bring up valid arguments about why Said should not carry out the attack, she is in no way the heroine of the film, Said is. There is never any reference to the amount of fighting that Palestinians direct at each other. Much of the instability in Palestinian territories is due to political violence between the rival parties of Hamas and Fatah. It seems as if Abu-Assad has overlooked this issue in order to garner support against Israel. This being said, I don't believe that Abu-Assad's purpose of creating this film was to portray a balanced view of the situation. This film was successful in providing an ethnocentric view of life as Palestinian and the justifications, in their mind, of suicide attacks.

I did find this film valuable for audiences who are educated about the Israel-Palestine conflict and have an understanding of the history behind the situation. I would recommend this film to anyone seeking to understand the daily hardships that Palestinians go through. Even though people might not agree with everything that this film conveys, it is beneficial in that it forces one to reexamine their opinion about a certain issue.",1175126400,15,4220,4.93943661971831
2476525,5,B000E0OE44,"For those viewers who are wondering whether this is a pro suicide bomber movie or not, I can say that it may depend upon who's doing the viewing.  Director Hany Abu-Assad, who is a Muslim was born in Nazareth, which is a largely Christian city in Palestine.  He moved to the Netherlands when he was a young man and currently lives in Los Angeles.  He believes the film presents ""an artistic point of view of...[a] political issue.""

I tend to agree.  The proof perhaps is in the fact that some Palestinians feel the film wasn't fair to their situation while some Israelis feel that the film glorified suicide bombers.  Both sides can find evidence in the film to support their point of view, and the arguments can become heated.

Personally I find suicide bombings abhorrent and counterproductive.  My belief has long been that the Palestinians would further their cause through a non-violent approach similar to methods used by Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.  Using your children to kill other people's children while committing suicide is not only morally wrong, but not likely to win the hearts and minds of people who can help you.  Furthermore the idea (expressed in the film by the suicide bombers and those who exploit them) that some people are superior because they are not afraid to die demonstrates a limited understanding of human nature and ignores history.  The Japanese used suicide bombers in World War II for example to no good effect.  And those men were not the ""humiliated"" and ""oppressed"" uneducated youths typical of suicide bombers in the Middle East.  Instead some of them were the cream of the young manhood of a growing nation.  Understand also that if the United States had the need it would have no trouble persuading countless Americans to commit suicide for God and country.  Some of the combat missions in the Pacific Theater amounted to something close to suicide.  No single people have a monopoly on tribalism.

What Hany Abu-Assad shows in the film is that the justification for suicide bombing is at best suspect and at worse without any merit at all.  ""What happens afterward?"" one of the bombers asks, and is told, ""Two angels come and pick you up.""  This is not merely satire, it is a burlesque of the ""Paradise Now"" reasoning.  Indeed the title of the film is itself satirical and ironic.  Young men seeing this film will notice that it is THEY who are being used as suicide bombers, not the political leaders and the imams.  Also the scene in which the suicide bombers make the obligatory video saying goodbye to family and friends and ""I did it for God"" with automatic rifle held on high, was played as farce, revealing the empty promise behind being used.

The fact that most of the anti-suicide rhetoric in the film comes from Suha (Lubna Azabal) who is the daughter of a privileged Arab and onetime opposition hero is seen as significant by some because in Arab/Muslim countries the political opinion of women is of scant value, and therefore Suha is seen as expressing a minority or discredited opinion.  However, since her expression is so very well articulated and persuasive, it can be seen from the opposite point of view, as expressing reason and moral truth.

Hany Abu-Assad of course had more than an artistic intent in making this film.  Clearly he wanted to put the tragedy of the Palestinians upon the silver screen (and DVD) for all the world to see.  To be effective he realized that he could not poison the waters of his expression with subjectivity and one-sidedness.  He had to work hard to be as objective as possible and to present both sides of the argument.  That way his film would be viewed and discussed, and some sympathy and understanding might develop.  He had to show suicide bombers as living, breathing human beings.  Notice that the two depicted are relatively intelligent young men, not mindless robots.

I share with Abu-Assad the belief that if all the facts about what is happening in the Middle East become widely known and understood (in so far as it is possible to understand the lives of people living in different cultures thousands of miles away) this knowledge and understanding would help to bring about positive change.  Ignorance is our only real enemy.

In short, Paradise Now is a work of art and an excellent film that clearly deserved its Golden Globe Award as the Best Foreign Film and its nomination for an Oscar as Best Foreign Film.  Kais Nashif who plays Said, one of the bombers, and Ali Suliman, who plays the other, both do an outstanding job, particularly Nashif who manages to combine the look and feel of a disadvantaged youth with the strength of character of a young man who is determined to follow what he ultimately determines is his fate.  His motivation goes beyond the ignorant and indoctrinated suicide bomber who is hoping to be rewarded with virgins in heaven.  He has personal reasons for becoming a suicide bomber.  He is the son of a man who collaborated with the Israelis, and consequently he feels that his fate is to compensate for what his father did.

The film was shot in Nablus and Nazareth and captures some of the atmosphere.  The editing is crisp and the story unfolds clearly with a nice tension.  The sense that the bomb around the bomber's waist could go off at any moment is one of the devices in the film that maintains that tension in a unique way.

All in all this a film very much worth seeing regardless of how you feel about the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.",1173484800,9,5498,4.738170347003154

2476527,4,B000E0OE44,"This is the story of two young Palestinian men recruited to bomb West Bank Israeli targets. The movie isn't a documentary, but it has the ride-along, realistic feel of one.

In a way, it sticks almost too much to unfolding in real time. It doesn't give us quite enough back-story to make us feel we know these men. But we do come to see them, not as bizarre fanatics, but as anyone's sons, as the boys next door. Although one of them is fired from his job at an auto repair shop/junkyard - for the most part these men are relatively well off and come from loving, close-knit families. One is even in a position to enjoy a budding romance with the lovely, free-thinking daughter of a revered Palestinian martyr.

However, the film is amazingly accurate and prescient in what insights it does provide about the bombers' motives. Just recently, studies have come out that reveal most suicide bombers are NOT motivated by a desire to enforce their religious views on the world. Rather they are chafing at the humiliations they feel they and their people have been made to suffer at the hands of various occupying forces. This is true for militant groups everywhere around the world, whether it be in Africa, Indonesia, or in the Middle East. And that's exactly what this film gets across about its two young men.

In spite of actually having a lot to live for, the young men feel honored to be selected to strap bombs to their waists and to walk across the checkpoint to ""take out as many Israelis as possible."" Religion is not their reason per se. They see themselves as freedom fighters, as liberators. Their faith in Allah's absolute Truth is only their means - the foundation of the strength they feel they have to muster to accomplish their goals.

One of the most riveting scenes in the movie shows these men videotaping their farewell speeches. They stand aggressively in front of the camera, machine guns akimbo, and deliver their mission statements. These are combinations of grandiosity and of the touchingly mundane. One bomber trails off with advice to his mother on where she can get the best buy on milk, information she'll need when he's no longer physically present to help her with the shopping.

Then these two men, with their bombs locked onto them, are driven close to the West Bank boundary they will have to negotiate. However their plans go immediately awry. One of the men returns to home base. The other becomes literally a loose cannon. He's the one who perhaps doesn't quite have the simplistic trust that his companion has always had in everyone's reassurances about the two angels who will carry them to Heaven after they have detonated themselves. He is also the one who just may not be absolutely sure about the justice of his cause. He pauses - as he looks into the eyes of the Israeli children who would be included as his targets.

This is an engrossing film. It's one that government officials should view before making policy decisions. But it can provide some better understanding to all of us. It is a rare opportunity to see the living conditions of average Palestinian Muslims on the West Bank. Its female lead is not veiled. She speaks her mind freely, intelligently to men - and is more comfortable with herself than most American women are. She's the kind of woman one barely guessed existed in these parts of the Muslim world.

But the really gripping aspect of this movie is the way it will put you in the shoes of a young Muslim with a mission - as he faces an almost unimaginable decision. What will he do? This film is well worth the bit of extra effort required to read its subtit",1170892800,8,3625,4.628304821150856

2476531,5,B000E0OE44,"Paradise Now a gripping film on the lives of Palestinian suicide bombers. Having spent a semester abroad in the middle east in college, I was particularly interested (and passionate) about this subject. I left my 3 months in Israel/Palestine more frustrated and confused than when I initially came (my initial thoughts/views were quickly destroyed when confronted with real life), and this film doesn't attempt to solve the problem, merely shed a more complete light on the plight of Palestinians. A few things of note in the film:

  * The media and prevailing assumption of the West (especially in the evangelical church) is that suicide bombers choose this route as a vengeful, spiteful, and somewhat lustful FIRST resort of dealing with the Israeli/Palestinian issue. While the film doesn't shy away from the heroism that is fostered among suicide bombers in Palestinian culture, it makes a compelling case that this method of suicide bombing is but a desperate last resort. ""If one cannot be equal in life, then at least one can be equal in death...""; this is buts one rationale offered. (This is not a justification of suicide bombings, but rather an attempt at understanding. Big difference...)

  * Along the same line, the film does a powerful job of showing the everyday reality that leads many young men (and a few women) to choose suicide bombing as a means to not only further the resistance, but also as a means of escaping the hell that is life in present day Palestine. It's difficult to watch a human being resort to such desperate measures.

  * The film also is careful to note that not all Palestinians are extremists. Many are conflicted, oppressed, yet hopeful proponents of peace and justice. Thus, the Palestinian people are vastly more complex than the media (and the church in the West) gives them credit for.

  * The entire issue is incredibly more complex than we realize. There are deep, deep cultural/ethnic/religious issues at play, issues that mere diplomacy won't fix. Western political pragmatism and strong arming won't cut it. Carrots and sticks by the U.N. won't do it either. Until the world immerses itself in the middle eastern culture (honor/shame, prominence of land, community over the individual, etc.) and 'contextualizes' a plan for peace, our attempts to 'help' will only breed more suffering.

  * Finally, a parting shot: maybe if we owned up to the reality that both the Palestinians and Israelis have made some crucial mistakes, and both have legitimate gripes, we could then provide a platform to make some progress. But this involves leveling the playing field, which is a far cry from present-day reality, as evidenced by our own nation's blank checks and blind eyes to Israel's campaigns against the Palestinians. Again, this doesn't at all make suicide bombings a good or right thing, but understanding leads to healing...",1168214400,11,2879,5.031578947368421
2476532,5,B000E0OE44,"I rented this film and Spielberg's MUNICH at the same time.  I was surprisingly disappointed by MUNICH and surprisingly impressed by PARADISE NOW. I thought this film would be a piece of obvious propaganda but it definitely wasn't.  It was evident that this film tried to be truthful and also recognized the madness inherent in suicide-bombing.  Contrary to PARADISE NOW, I found Spielberg's film to be a piece of pro-Palestinian terrorist propaganda.  Go figure; I didn't see that one coming.  I found this film riveting.  The characters were fascinating and got more so as the story progressed.  The script was excellent and the acting exceptional.  It showed slices of Palestinian life and thinking.  It was sympathetic to the Palestinian ""cause"" but that was seemingly incidental.  I felt this film was about people trapped in a bad situation economically, spiritually, and morally.  About people usually denied the opportunity to make choices but when they had to make them, the options were few and often very extreme with extreme consequences.  And those consequences were not just to themselves.  I learned a lot through this film.  Those little background facts that help you better understand why a people politically act the way they do.  How do some people become suicide bombers, why and what are the rules.  It was fascinating.

2476553,5,B000E0OE44,"Paradise Now is not a film about politics.  Director Hany Abu-Assad creates suspense enough to make you feel like you're watching a thriller, but at its heart this is a stirring document of the lives of two young men of occupied Palestine.

Filmed on location in Nablus, the story opens with Khaled and Said being notified that their suicide mission is to take place within the next 24 hours.  As the clock winds down, we watch their handlers lead them through their last rites, first in a series of religious ceremonies meant to sooth their consciences, and later in a last filmed statement to fan their simmering hate.

At first it feels like you're being set up for a James Bond type movie - all flash and sizzle with no substance. But when the mission goes awry and the bombers get split up, their fear, their doubt, their shame - the things that make them human - begin to seep out around the edges of their hate and resignation and at last you begin to see what it is that motivates Khaled and Said, young men who would otherwise be chasing girls and racing cars, to strap on a girdle of explosives.  Credit goes as much to the actors as to the director/writer for allowing these characters to shine and to step out of the shadow of stereotype.

The film does not glorify or excuse the bombers.  In fact, the point of view character, the Western educated Suha, condemns them while pleading for a new course, a new way of thinking and resisting that does not require random violence.  If the film makes any point at all, its that the eye-for-an-eye tactics of the Intifada and the Israeli government cannot lead to a peaceful resolution of the conflict.

And that is most certainly not a political message.",1163635200,7,1711,4.547231270358306
2476554,4,B000E0OE44,"It is impossible to look at this 2005 Palestinian film with any objectivity since the story concerns the fate of would-be suicide bombers, but director/co-writer Hany Abu-Assad does a compelling job of bringing a palpable sense of humanism and laying out a broader context for why such devastating acts of terrorism occur. He is even audacious enough to include some unexpected comedy elements to emphasize the mood of desperation in the country. Written by Abu-Assad with Bero Beyer and Pierre Hodgson, the tightly wound plot focuses on two young Palestinian men, who as low-end auto mechanics about to be fired, don't think twice about being martyrs for the cause.

Naturally they are a study in opposites - Said is grimly serious to the point of obsession because he is the son of an executed Israeli collaborator, while Khaled is swept up in the spirit of the cause and likely nave about his impending death and subsequent entry into heaven. Most of the movie is about their preparation for a meticulously planned strike in Tel Aviv, and their outward appearances change dramatically so they can fit in among the Israelis (referred to as ""settlers"" by the Palestinians). Training them is Jamal, as he emptily spouts extremist rhetoric under the leadership of Abu-Karem, who runs the underground political organization responsible for the bombing. Complicating matters further is the romantic relationship developing between Said and Suha, the daughter of a revered Palestinian leader and whose pacifist views provide a direct counterpoint to the two men's actions.

Running only ninety minutes, the film is quickly paced, and the last twenty minutes are pulse-racing in the way that effective American crime thrillers are. The acting is strong, especially among the three principals - Kais Nashef as embattled Said, Lubna Azabal as conscientious Suha, and in particular, Ali Suliman as increasingly manic Khaled. In a surprise about-face from his comic turn in 2004's ""The Syrian Bride"", Ashraf Barhom gets quite serious as Abu-Karem. Particularly impressive is the crisp, sun-drenched cinematography by Antoine Hberl. Abu-Assad has taken great pains to present a dispassionate political perspective while heightening the personal drama. For the most part, he succeeds even if the script turns to polemics toward the climax. Regardless, this is a provocative, deeply cinematic work. The 2006 DVD offers only the theatrical trailer as an extra.",1162425600,7,2447,5.304123711340206
2476555,4,B000E0OE44,"As a film, Paradise Now is a suspenceful masterpiece. The most evil of characters, suicide bombers become human and sympathetical to the viewer. Lives are explored and scenes of a degraded West Bank life are constantly in perspective of the viewer. Said and Khaled, the 2 friends who are recurited by a terror group to carry out the killings are interesting characters in their own right. As a film I greatly enjoyed watching this work.

Now for the problems that I found with this film. Politics-wise (lets face it, we cant talk about this film without mentioning politics or history), there are many errors and simple omissions of historical facts, vis a vis Israelis and Palestinians. For one, Israelis themselves become nothing more than faceless, oppressive monsters from another dimension, whose only goal is to hurt and humiliate the Palestinians shown in the film. In one of the scenes where Khaled is videotaping his 'martyrdom' video, he mentions that Israel rejected a 2-state solution, when in fact the only rejection came from Palestinian terror groups, whose stated goal is written clearly for everyone to see, a complete and utter destruction of Israel (read the official Hamas charter), not some dreamy and heroic struggle of occupation. This fact in essence dooms the film's factual basis, compounded with other numerous half truths and allegations.

I do not want to insist on a powerful film such as this to go over every minute detail of the conflict, so I will say this; watch this film with a grain of salt. It is without a doubt a powerful,emotional and very well made film by talented film makers, and the 2 main actos (Said and Khaled) are simply superb in their roles. Politics aside, as hard as that may be, the film is an excellent work.",1160956800,,1765,4.8604651162790695
2476556,4,B000E0OE44,"PARADISE NOW opens windows of information to those of us who do not live in the Middle East and who toil over understanding the strife that daily bitterly continues, bruising the lives of both ends of the polarity that separates the peoples of the region. Are there ever to be answers or solutions to the crises? For this viewer watching and absorbing PARADISE NOW is illuminating in that it removes the expected political preaching to focus on the minds of the people living under the daily stress of life at its most difficult. Taking us there, making ideas into people with all the convictions and rebelliousness and fragility, writer/director Hany Abu-Assad (with Bero Beyer) offers invaluable insights and in the end we are left with a story about humanity and the consequences of decisions, and the desperate need for peace.

Said (Kais Nashef) and Khaled (Ali Suliman) are childhood friends in Palestine who have been elected to be suicide bombers in an attack on Tel Aviv. Their election to be martyrs for the destruction of the 'invaders' is considered an honor: their deaths will bring glory to their country, their families, and guarantee them instant entry into heaven. We see the two men as citizens living in the dusty hovels, facing barricades and checkpoints that make their lives ones of constant stress. Martyrdom will bring them peace and eternal rest. The entire process of preparing the elected martyrs, from making farewell videotapes for their parents, to having their hair cut short, to having the bombs strapped to their bodies, to dressing them in black suits for the 'wedding' they are instructed to claim to attend in Tel Aviv, to sending them off at the designated spot is relentlessly filmed. Said and Khaled accept their roles although with varying degrees of emotional commitment. At the point where the lads are to begin their martyrdom venture they are separated and the story is how each continues living, each now alone.

The families and the perpetrators of the scheme are well drawn by a strong cast, with one female role Suha (Lubna Azabal) as a voice of reason and peace standing out particularly strongly. The sensitivity of the actors Kais Nashef and Ali Suliman keeps this drama from sinking into politicism and instead allows us to understand the inner turmoil of the two men they portray as they cope with their duties and their lives.

This is a powerful document that serves as a plea for peace wherever terrorism is a factor - and now that is global. If more of us could watch and absorb films such as PARADISE NOW perhaps the itinerant boundaries separating mankind by misunderstanding could be reduced without the need for war. Highly Recommended.

2476557,5,B000E0OE44,"""Paradise Now"" is one of the first post-September 11 films on terrorism that I've seen and it's one of the most overlooked and powerful. Saying it's overlooked isn't completely accurate, it was nominated for the Best Foreign Film Academy Award and it won the Best Foreign Film Golden Globe. Most people won't see it though, because it's in Arabic with English subtitles. The movie is about two Palestinian men named Said (pronunced SI-EED) and Khaled, who see that their life is like a prison that they can't get out of. Both of these men long for paradise, whether it's real or just in their head. So the two men join a group of martyrs, have bombs strapped to their bodies, and begin crossing into Israel to commit a suicide mission in Tel Aviv. It's not so one-sided though, the movie kind of sidetracks...As soon as Said and Khaled cross into Israel, they are separated. Khaled gets back to the martyrs, while Said begins wandering around and realizes that the mission is his fate and he can't change it. The movie is pretty insightful at looking at the motivations of terrorism (like the critic John Anderson says on the cover, although I'm paraphrasing)...But, at the same time, I think that most terrorists don't think the way Said and Khaled do. The movie isn't likely to offend anyone that is offended by films like ""World Trade Center"" or ""United 93"" because it's about terrorism, but not the same kind as portrayed in those films (I haven't been offended by any film I've ever seen, so this is just an opinion). Even if you're not into reading subtitles, this is a haunting and important film that should be seen by people. This movie has the potential to be shown in classrooms at some point. In a world where politics can make you win Oscars and Grammys (Michael Moore, Rage Against the Machine, etc.)...

""Paradise Now"" is a small foreign film that should just be seen.

2476558,1,B000E0OE44,"I've been reading many of the reviews of this movie, and I can't help noticing how many people were giving this top ratings. People who watch and love this movie are totally unaware of the REAL situation in the Middle East. This film shows the humanity of two average-joe Muslims who are called up to fulfill their promise...to go into a crowded area, and kill dozens of people! Those who rave about this movie, saying how it's not propaganda at all do not know the truth. A very in-your-face propaganda scene shows the two protagonists leave their destitute Arab-ghetto and enter the ""urban metropolis"" of Tel-Aviv. The only message people get from this scene is, ""Oh, those poor Palestinians; look how poor they are."" While those territories are actually poor in real life, the way that scene was shot doesn't make you think, ""why are those areas so poor in the first place? The Arab government has promised year after year to build up Muslim economy and welfare."" The story unfairly pins the blame all on the Israelis; their growth in economy and industry led to the downfall of the Muslims'. So how do the Arabs retaliate? They go according to their RELIGION, they blow themselves up in a public area, killing many Jews surrounding them. The viewer is left feeling sad at the end of the movie, because one of the characters almost got his friend to not kill himself. But at the last moment, he ""fulfills his destiny"". The drama here, according to the viewer, is generally, ""That's so terrible. In the end he died."" What they DON'T say is, ""That's so horrible. He killed all of those people. He killed himself just so he could take as many Jews with him as possible."" And that's the truth.

This movie, however ""moving"" it may be to many, still avoids the truth, bringing out unjust and antisemitic propaganda to the film industry in a ""well filmed and thought out movie."" Personally, I think anyone who naturally enjoys this movie, because of the drama of seeing two terrorists kill themselves, is an antisemite himself. This movie's moral isn't to spread peace and to feel sorry for those ""poor Palestinians"", it's ""to spread hatred and death among the Jews"". The mere fact that this film got nominated for best foreign film is mortifying; it shows just how low the movie industry has sunk. In fact, it also shows how low society in general has sunk as well.

There are no easy answers or good/evil dichotomies in this complex and tragic conflict, and the film-makers (this was directed by an Israeli Arab, and multinationally funded production) don't cop out on us particularly not at the ending, which is about as non-sensational and non-propagandistic as you could ask for.  The two suicide bombers are neither glorified nor demonized; there is a dispassionate and naturalistic tone to the entire film which is quite admirable.

2476562,4,B000E0OE44,"The thing that's most striking about ""Paradise Now"" - an Award-winning Palestinian film about two young men recruited to be suicide bombers - is the remarkably matter-of-fact way in which it approaches its subject.  Without a trace of jingoism or a hint of sensationalism, the film tells the story of Said and Khaled, two long time friends who are called upon to sacrifice their lives for what they believe to be the good of the Palestinian people.  As the film starts, Said and Khaled receive word that they are to travel to Tel Aviv, where they are to blow themselves up, taking as many Israeli soldiers with them as they can.  However, the plan hits some unforeseen snags, causing the men to become separated and giving each the chance to rethink his commitment to the act.

Directed by Hany Abu-Assad, ""Paradise Now"" was a highly controversial film from the moment it was released in 2005.  (It was also a production fraught with a great deal of danger and peril for the individuals making it, as the crew fell victim to exploding land mines, helicopter gunfire and even the kidnapping of the location manager during the filming).  The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is so messy, complex and entangled an affair that it is virtually impossible for any film to please all the various individuals with a stake in the issue.  There is always bound to be someone who thinks any movie on this subject will go too far or not far enough in siding with one or the other of the parties involved (just look at the brouhaha aroused by Spielberg's ""Munich"" last year).  And, certainly, ""Paradise Now,"" remaining true to its characters, provides perhaps a slightly more sympathetic view of the Palestinian cause.  However, the filmmakers make it abundantly clear that terrorism and violence are not the answer to the problems facing the region and that such acts are tragic and ultimately counterproductive for both the individuals and the nations involved.

What's most remarkable about ""Paradise Now"" is that, given the extreme volatility of its subject matter, it still manages to remain so cool-headed and even-handed in its tone.  Through the compelling performances of newcomers Kais Nashef and Ali Suliman, the film becomes, first and foremost, a human drama about two young men caught in a mindset that seems positively inscrutable to those of us living in the more peaceful, secular West.  We come to know them as individuals, but we are never asked to approve of their actions.  If anything, we are made acutely aware of the waste of life and potential that would result from such an action.  For the movie makes it quite clear that men like Said and Khaled can accomplish much more in the way of peace and equality if they are alive and actively engaged in the cause than if they are dead.  That is a message we cannot hear too often in these perilous times in which we live.  And that we can hear it coming from individuals so close to the actual heart of things is what makes ""Paradise Now"" such an indispensable addition to the cause of world peace.",1155168000,5,3052,4.773764258555133
2476593,5,B000E0OE44,". . .it's best to actually watch it, so as to lessen one's chances of coming off looking like a reactionary.  For instance, had the reviewer below who wrote this line--

""There is no dillema [sic], the suicide bombers do not think twice during their last 24 hours before the deed.""

--seen the film all the way through, he would have known that both of the bombers do in fact question their mission (and quite gut-wrenchingly at that) at various times throughout the entire film, right up until the end.  It is, in fact, the bombers' ambivalence about their mission that provides and sustains the plot's necessary tensions.

As noted by other reviewers, this film is not about who's ""right"" or ""wrong"" in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Rather, Abu-Assad seeks to present what life is like for the average Palestinian living on land occupied and controlled by a foreign power, and to explore the many components--political and economic oppression, feelings of guilt and shame over one's father having been executed for collaborating with the Israelis, plain old despair, and, yes, religious fanaticism--that go into leading a person to strap a bomb around his (or her) own waist.  It is a very complex portrait psychologically speaking, one that likely corresponds rather closely to the complex reality it seeks to portray.  If that amounts to ""humanizing"" terrorists, then so be it.  Like it or not, they are human beings.  Writing them off as anything less is dangerous and counterproductive.",1153526400,11,1497,5.048780487804878

Why won't they make a movie about the suicide bombers of 9/11, how poor they were, how pure they were, how they loved thier families, and fighting for freedom, and how they had no choice in doing what they did. Obivously this movie has an agenda supporting the martirdom of a dark age society. There is art, and there is propaganda, there is no peaceful conclusion to the movie, no positive message.

It starts off with the two main characters are close friends who are on some sort of a list to be a suicide bomber. At first, both are keen to do so. Its clear from the start that they are considered by their handlers to being weapons not people. However after awhile, one realizes that this is wrong. He tries to persuade his friend not to do it. His friend however goes ahead with the suicide bombing and for good political effect it is shown to be tough soldiers that he is going to kill.

The movie acting goes back and forwards from being extremely good to dismal.

Basically the Palestinians are presented as victims, when the Palestinians could have had peace with Israel if they wanted it.",1152489600,9,750,4.420289855072464
2476597,5,B000E0OE44,"I found this film to be excellent, well made and insightful. I found it had three strengths.

First, it has the qualities of a really good thriller. Two young Palestinian men, Said and Khaled, agree to be human bombs and travel to Tel-Aviv to wreck havoc.  However, things go wrong and plot becomes complex as the two men are separated and separately decide whether or not to move forward with the mission. The men franticallylook for each other, for their Palestinian contacts, and for a way to remove the bombs tied to their waists. As the two men search for each other as well as the Palestinian underground leadership, the film becomes tense and full of plot twists.

Second, the film does a very good job of character divelopment. Of course Said and Khaled move from being junk yard mechanics to terrorists, but we see their character develop quickly when when the planned terrorist attack gets aborted. We see angry and nieve Khaled mve toward maturity and reflection. We see reflective and pensive Said move toward resolution and commitment to his task as an end point in the cycle of shame he has experienced since his father was executed/killed as a consprirator with the Isralis. In the character of Said we see why a young man would sacrifice his life for such a cause.

Third, the film presents a fair and balanced representation of the issues faced by the Palestinians. Suha, the grand-daughter of a Palestinian leader, provides us with the voice of peace and negotiation. We hear arguments from both sides of the Palestinian community. There are those that would seek reconciliation and peace and neotiation and then there are those who think the conditions have gone far beyond discussion and communication. The Palestinian terrorist leadership is revealed to be constantly on the run, always looking over their shoulders, and thus highly nervous when Said and Khaled fail at their mission on the first attempt. We see a decayed and poverty stricken Palestinian village compared to the brigh beaches and shopping malls of Tel-Aviv.

Despite the fact that this was a well balanced, thoughtful, and fair depiction of the dynamics in Palestinian villages, I still think a non-violent approach is the only way Palestinians will eventually gain the esteem and sympathy of the world.  Terrorists and their acts continue to bring about violent reactions from Israel, thus setting up a cycle of violence and retribution.

The film is thought provoking, giving much more insight into the minds of poor Palestinians. It is well made and careful in presenting its message - thus making it all the more powerful.",1151971200,3,2615,4.943052391799545
2476598,1,B000E0OE44,This movie is a little too one sided for me. The whole movie shows the hardships of the Palestinians but fails to show the hardships of the Israeli's. How could someone justify terrorisim? Do you see Jews blowing themselves up in German malls today? What will killing civilians benefit? The movie is great at making you feel bad for a terrorist but then again movies can be made about Hitler and Stalin to make you feel bad for them. This is a terrible one sided movie.,1151884800,19,469,4.465116279069767
2476599,4,B000E0OE44,"Neither bomber nor terrorist be.

Getting the ""inside scoop"" is a tough thing to do in a fictional tale on such a delicate subject. I have friends who are on both sides of the Palestinian/Israeli conflict and I try equally hard to see both their views. But the things I could never get over were the constant incursions of the Israeli's into Palestine, and the Palestinian radicalists who strap bombs to themselves and detonate their deadly selves in the middle of women and children. Regardless of my political standpoint, both of these things just felt ...well ...inhuman.

""Paradise Now"" is refreshing in that it doesn't ask the audience to take sides. We're just along for the ride with two good friends, Said and Khaled, Palestinians who are given the task of strapping on bombs and destroying as many Israeli's as they can (it's noteworthy to mention that this ""reaction"" is in response to the death of a Palestinian). Politics takes a backseat here as we witness these two men turn from automobile mechanics to walking time-bombs; they don't have a personal agenda, so to speak. They are out to do what is demanded ""by God"". But once armed and led into Israeli territory, things quickly go awry: an Israeli tank appears and threatens the mission. Said and Khaled get separated and the Palestinian militants who sent them on this mission begin to question their loyalties. Indeed, even Said and Khaled begin to question themselves. Why are they doing this? What will be gained? These are incredibly tough questions that the film plops into the audiences lap. And we get to see these things through the eyes of the two friends. The issue isn't forced upon us in some docu-drama fashion. This is fiction but with a splash of personal and modern morality.

Hany Abu-Assad (director) deserves quite a bit of praise for his telling of this story. His gentle handling of this volatile subject matter held the perfect pitch: not forcing a message upon us yet getting a message across nonetheless. And that message? It's more about friendship, loyalty, love and loss than political extremism. Oh sure, the politics are tucked into the background but it's not (thank goodness) the focus.

And it's no small wonder this movie was nominated for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars this year.",1151712000,5,2282,4.858611825192802
2476600,5,B000E0OE44,"This is an outstanding movie that explores the motivations of Palestinian suicide bombers.  The conventional wisdom in the US is that they are either religious fanatics, rabid anti-Semites, and/or political extremists who want simply to murder Israelis and push their country into the sea.  This film tries to examine some of the moral complexities of the occupation and the suicide bombers, and to explain (and in part justify) their motives.  If the director wanted to create a more sympathetic, nuanced image of the Palestinian resistance, I think he has succeeded.  In this story, two young Palestinians who are close friends are called upon to carry out an operation against Israel.  We follow the characters as they examine the reasons for volunteering for this mission, their uncertainties, and their motivations as they question whether or not they can really go through with the operation. Through them, we learn about the diversity of viewpoints among the Palestinians regarding the occupation and suicide bombing.  We also see the suffering of the Palestinian people, and view up close what the Israeli occupation means to the daily life of the Palestinians.  After watching this film, it is pretty easy to understand why the Palestinians are pissed.  The only thing that I disliked about this movie was that the director completely avoided the difficult moral dilemma of the Palestinian suicide bombers attacking civilians by making the bomber's target a bus (mostly) full of Israeli soldiers.  I suspect that the audience's reaction would be somewhat different if the bus were filled with women and children. This is really a minor complaint though, why should Palestinian films address all the moral complexities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict when there are literally hundreds of pro-Israel propaganda films that completely ignore the effects of the creation of the Israeli state and the occupation on the indigenous Palestinians?  This is a timely film that I think most viewers will find extremely compelling.  This film is a start in what I hope is a greater effort to portray the Palestinian viewpoint on the conflict that will be accessable to Western (and particularly US) audiences.  Regardless of what your viewpoint is on the conflict, this film is definitely worth watching.",1150761600,5,2304,5.2650273224043715

We sense the scope of their environmental ills, having been introduced to the border town of 'N' through the eyes of the daughter of a 'martyr', returning from Paris to become a resident. Director,Hany Abu-Assad enlarges our tolerance for our fellow beings by allowing us to identify with the martyrs in their absolute otherness to the extent that we understand what is motivating them to strap explosives to themseves and gain their paradise now, through ultimate sacrifice. It's a terrible thing, the white screen at film's end signifying that erasure, an absolute act of nihilistic theological despair. The film enables us to put ourselves in their postion, to feel almost the intensity, the insanity of the contradiction that requires their act. Unless we're capable of such an imaginative leap, as the film conjures, we remain strangers to eachother, maintaining the tragic dualism we currently endure with two implacable systems, hating and bombing eachother. I've seen no other film that comes close in attempting to understand this. The laudable,'Syriana's' terrorists weren't granted this kind of nuanced dimension, where we deeply feel the dilemna, the decisions and implications of the jihadist's life. Without proseletyizing for an instance,Abu-Assad transports us(no pun intended) into the terror of the situation. A real and remarkable film.",1149465600,10,1470,5.451754385964913

Things to keep in mind: Unlike how it is shown in the film, most victims of Palestinian terrorism are civilians, including children, not military personnel. The film's characters recite ""facts"" about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that are hardly factual.  This isn't necessarily problematic from my point of view.  I am sure terrorists really do subscribe to that world view and a piece of art (as this surely is) is entitled to artistic license, but I'd hate for it to be confused for an accurate desciption of the facts underlying the conflict.",1148947200,8,842,5.079710144927536

2476634,5,B000E0OE44,"I just returned from some time in the middle east (my first trip) and experienced a world of paradoxes.  Arabs and Muslims seem to profess brotherly love and cohesion among themselves, and then totally dismiss each other in reality.  The Iraqis are suspicious of Turkey and Iran (not Arabs but still Muslim), the Turks distrust the Kurds, the Kurds seem to trust no one but themselves, the Saudis live in their own insular world supported by oil money and imported labor, and I firmly believe if it weren't for their conflict with Israel, the Palestinians would be mostly marginalized and/or ignored by their Arab/Muslim cousins.  I also don't believe in ""historical rights"" to land.  Given any spot of land on this planet, all you have to do is choose a certain century, and a different people occupied that chunk of land.  So, based on that, I have little sympathy for Israeli or Palestinian  ""historical"" claims to middle eastern land.  Heck, the ""holy land"" was occupied by Rome at some time, so Italy should even be able to claim something based on that faulty logic.  Alexander conquered it as well...maybe Greece should lay dibs on the middle east too.

BUT, back to the movie.  Very well done! Palestinians are people.  Regardless of what some of them are capable of doing, it's ignorant and stupid not to try to understand what's motivating their actions.  Though there may not be good reasons for blowing yourself up (very few good reason for that in my book), there are obviously reasons why it happens (flimsy reasons or not).  This movie doesn't offer any concrete answers, but takes a very human look at the possible motivations and environments that shape and influence people into even considering such actions.  The main characters are loosely defined, given a bit of history, and then we simply see who they are at this moment in time in their lives.

The cinematography is great, the acting solid, and the topic quite timely.  Unfortunately too many people out there won't think enough about this.  They'll just ""react"".  They bomb, shoot, blow-up, rant, rave, dis the Amazon reviews in favor of this movie, and discount anything that doesn't agree with their view.  Way to ignore the one tool that would best help the world solve problems like this...your intellect.

My biggest complaint is it would have been good to see the Israeli side of this story a bit.  I have one American Jewish friend who said once, ""Were they nuts?  Why the hell did they build a Jewish nation in the middle of the middle east surrounded by millions of Arabs who HATE them?  Didn't we have some extra land in Montana to offer up or something?""

And the real reason for these reviews...will you like the movie?  Hmmm...depends.

Not only was I surprised that Warner Bros. would put out a film about such a controversial subject, but also the cinematography retained a certain ""indie"" quality that made it a pleasure to watch.  The editing is absolutely superb, and you will probably sweat in your seat for the full 90 minutes of the film.  The excellent production quality and tight suspense contrasts with the long-winded opus ""Munich"" by Spielberg, but both are good films in broaching the difficult topic of terrorism and retribution.  I also recommend the Israeli movie ""Cup Final"" for a poignant look at Israelis and Palestinian guerrillas before the era of suicide bombing (which began 1993-94).

The political message of the movie is actually quite powerful, for those who can handle a little nuance.  By showing a snapshot of the lives of two Palestinian men who decide to become suicide bombers, the film refuses to condemn them as nameless, faceless terrorists.  Rather, it demonstrates the horrible political tragedy of which their decision is part and parcel.  In the end, the film proves that they actually DO have a choice to contribute to the cycle of violence (or not).  The film is not a documentary (although it was shot on location with Israeli Jews and Arabs), and so it fails to articulate a clear political alternative to the current situation.  However, by illustrating in stark terms the agency of the characters involved and the difference that their choices make, it points the way toward an ethical rejection of the status quo (violence) in favor of an alternative future.",1146096000,26,1787,4.845394736842105
2476637,4,B000E0OE44,"""Paradise Now"", the new Palestinian film recently released on DVD, is an engrossing look at what life is like in a part of the world many of us will never get to see. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 2005.

Said (Kais Nashef) and Khaled (Ali Suliman) are two young men who have lived in the West Bank for their entire lives. They, like most of their friends and family, have long since learned to live with the constant presence of Israel in their lives. They don't give checkpoints a second glance, they barely duck when a bombing happens nearby, they have learned to live without many of the things we take for granted; variety of food, movies, freedom of movement. One day, Jamal (Amer Hlehel) tells them their time has come; they have been chosen to perform a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv, in retaliation for the murder of Suha's (Lubna Azabal) father. When Suha, a friend of the two young men, finds out about their plan, she tries to stop them, believing that the violence will only lead to more violence.

""Paradise Now"", written and directed by Hany Abu-Assad, is a surprisingly moving film. Shot in the West Bank, the film thrusts us into daily life in this very remote part of the world. I say remote because I think I can safely say many of us will never see this very different part of the world. It depicts the lives of the two young men, showing us their difficult struggles, in an effort to convince us why they would be so eager to participate in such a heinous act, why such a thing would make them `heroes'. And ""Paradise"" does a remarkably good job of convincing us. Their life is very difficult, but it isn't difficult because of the Palestinians or the Israelis. It is difficult because of a long standing history between the two groups. They have spent so many years hating each other, trying to eradicate each other; it is difficult to wonder if they will ever reach peace.

After the two men are chosen, we watch their indoctrination and training.

The process of any change they experience is a gradual one. They each share a last evening with their families, never revealing the journey they will take on the next day. These scenes are very emotional, yet low key. They can't reveal what will happen, to keep their parents safe from the news and the effects. Yet, they also have to maintain a sense of normalcy. They can't cry or get emotional or bid a long farewell. Perhaps it is this lack of a proper good-bye which helps to begin the journey of change. They are groomed, heads shaven, clothes changed, to make them appear more Israeli, so they can blend in. They receive detailed instructions. One of them should set off their bomb first, allowing the police and authorities to come to the scene and then the second should set off their bomb, to inflict more casualties. Then they receive the instructions about how to get into Tel Aviv and where to go.

But Said and Khaled go through with it, leaving for Tel Aviv. Complications arise.

Abu-Assad does a very good job of showing the conflicting emotions in his main characters. They have been trained, programmed, all of their lives to believe Israel is the enemy, and now they have the chance to become martyrs for the cause, to become heroes. Yet, they begin to question if this is the way to obtain their goals. After they arrive in Israel, they blend in, receiving only cursory glances. What really makes this film powerful is that it pretty evenly presents both sides of the story. It clearly wants to show peace is the way, but it has to give us an idea of what they have lived with all of their lives. To present only one point of view would not do the film justice. We need to see both, to make the right way seem all the more correct and powerful.

Kais Nashef is very good as Said, the more unemotional of the two, steely, reserved and determined to carry out his mission. Ali Suliman's Khaled is the more emotional one. He is more excited about his calling and also more scared when the effects of the mission become clear.

Suha proves to be the level headed member of the group. She is quite smitten with Said, but he doesn't seem able to reciprocate. When he learns of his fate, he becomes even more withdrawn, afraid to get her hopes up. As soon as she learns of their plans, she raises many good points, debating with them the need for their journey. She believes that the only way to end this current problem is through peaceful negotiations. Violence will only lead to more violence, as it has in their culture for years, for decades.

Shot in Nablas, the film depicts the town and life in it with an unflinching eye. Covered in dirt, debris and decades of war, Nablas is not an attractive place. To us, it looks uninhabitable. To these people, this is all they know, so they live with it. They have to, they have no choice. It is difficult for them to leave and obtain anything else, to improve their lives, because of the history of this place.

""Paradise Now"" is all the more powerful because of it's ending. The ending is a little ambiguous, leaving it open to interpretation. The filmmaker's leave this to our imagination and it is all the more powerful for that reason. Our mind can make up a much more horrifying ending than they could ever film.",1145491200,12,5288,4.498958333333333

I am also disappointed in Warner Brothers trailer, this film was not the film or the message you see in the trailer.  The marketing department worked their magic by changing the color, pacing, adding pop music and the ever dependable deep voice to completely change the films feel, message, and identity.  It's one thing to try to resurrect a $100M blockbuster you've blown your summer budget on, it's something completely different to manipulate viewers when the themes, issues, and opinions run so deep!",1144713600,7,714,4.827868852459017
2476641,5,B000E0OE44,"Although I can't embrace some of the conclusions to which this film hopes to lead its audience, ""Paradise Now"" succeeds as a film because it is a well-crafted story.

While Spielberg's ""Munich"" deals with similar territory - the futility of violence to quell the tide of violence - this film does not stumble on its way to resolution. Where Spielberg tried to foist the idea of moral equivalncy on both sides of the conflict, ""Paradise Now"" is content to tell a story -and tell ti well - with its own unique voice.

Granted, it offers a variation of ideas - and once or twice slips into political rhetoric - but it does not patronize the viewers by pretending to present the Israeli viewpoint. Nor does it coddle the viewer with a false ""all-things-being-equal"" morality. It is exactly what it presents itself as being: the story of two men tapped to be suicide bombers. It is content in that. An opposing viewpoint need not be self-censored. If you want ""balance,"" go look elsewhere.

The triumph of the film is measured in the way it involves its audience in the drama. Even though I abhored some of their beliefs, I still cared about these characters. I worried for their safety; I mourned for their families; I questioned the sanity of one who chooses hopelessness over the possibility of love with a most beautiful woman; I resented the ""handlers"" who send these two young men to be pawns in a schene over which they have no control.

This is a gripping movie which deserves to be considered for the merits of its storytelling - not condemned for its politics.",1143936000,5,1565,4.659420289855072
2476661,5,B000E0OE44,"Although my mother would certainly debate the point, acknowledging a political view is not the same thing as endorsing it.  So I do not think finding ""Paradise Now"" to be provocative or compelling constitutes a political position that needs to be articulated or defended.  Said (Kais Nashef) and Khaled (Ali Suliman) are a pair of Palestinians living in the West Bank.  They work together at a garage and are best friends.  In response to an Israeli attack, the Palestinian organization to which they belong has decided to retaliate and set up their first mission in two years.  Said and Khaled will be sent to Tel Aviv as suicide bombers, using the technique that we have become familiar with from the news: the first bomb will go off and when the rescuers arrive to deal with the dead and dying the second bomb will detonate.

Said and Khaled spend a last night with their families, who do not have any idea what will be happening the next day.  The two men are shaved, given haircuts and new suits, so that they can blend in with their intended victims.  But when they film their final statements of martyrdom there are problems with the video camera.  What follows is not really a comedy of errors, because there is nothing funny about suicide bombers, but director Hany Abu-Assad (""Al Qods Fee Yom Akhar"") has a definite sense of irony.  The last statements of martyrs are not expected to include shopping tips (to be clear, this is not a funny moment, but rather one that recognizes what strange thoughts go through the mind of someone who is about to go out into the world and blow himself up).

The problems with the videotape are a harbinger of what is to come, as the detailed plan gets off track.  Said and Khaled become separated, and the plan that has been put into place is not exactly full of contingencies.  However, the extra time gives both men a chance to have second thoughts, each going in a decidedly different direction.  This gives the film, co-written by Abu-Assad and his partner Bero Beyer, and opportunity to present different points of views on why a group engages in suicide bombings and why the practice will not result in the desired changes.  Jamal (Amer Hiehel) is the brains behind the operation, while Suha (Lubna Azabal) represents what we would think of as being the voice of reason in the film.  But there are reasons on both sides and a reasonable assumption is that viewers have already made their minds up on this issue before they even sit down and watch ""Paradise Now.""

When things go wrong with the plan there is a sense in which this 2005 film starts to become a thriller.  Granted, one of the questions is clearly whether or not these human bombs are going to go off.  But ""Paradise Now"" is not trying to be a thriller.  Instead it is finding space between the decision and the act to reconsider both.  I have been thinking over whether the fade from the final shot of the film is a poetic touch by Abu-Assad or an effort at ambiguity.  At this point I am inclined to go with the former, especially since I have little doubt that viewers will impose their own ideology when deciding to solve the apparent ambiguity.  This is not a movie that is trying to change the minds of its viewers, just one that is trying to get them to see things from a different perspective.  Ultimately, that is what may well prove more disquieting than the thought of seeing bombs going off.",1143676800,6,3417,4.573070607553366

""Paradise Now"" makes the very same statement Patrick Henry had once made for another great nation: give me liberty or give me death.

This movie is about a million times more effective in educating the World of the Palestinian fight for freedom and sovereignty than a million suicide bombers could ever achieve. This is a movie that does not bomb, yet explosive to the World's collective conscience.

The movie also showed a glimpse of Tel-Aviv, the capital of Israel. It looks like Miami. It looks like a fun city. It is a modern city. How great it would be if Palestinian cities begin to look like that.

The real peace process between Israel and Palestine has just begun when this movie got released.",1143331200,17,848,4.716216216216216

Are there ever to be answers or solutions to the crises? For this viewer watching and absorbing PARADISE NOW is illuminating in that it removes the expected political preaching to focus on the minds of the people living under the daily stress of life at its most difficult.  Taking us there, making ideas into people with all the convictions and rebelliousness and fragility, writer/director Hany Abu-Assad (with Bero Beyer) offers invaluable insights and in the end we are left with a story about humanity and the consequences of decisions, and the desperate need for peace.

Said (Kais Nashef) and Khaled (Ali Suliman) are childhood friends in Palestine who have been elected to be suicide bombers in an attack on Tel Aviv.  Their election to be martyrs for the destruction of the 'invaders'  is considered an honor: their deaths will bring glory to their country, their families, and guarantee them instant entry into heaven.  We see the two men as citizens living in the dusty hovels, facing barricades and checkpoints that make their lives ones of constant stress.  Martyrdom will bring them peace and eternal rest.  The entire process of preparing the elected martyrs, from making farewell videotapes for their parents, to having their hair cut short, to having the bombs strapped to their bodies, to dressing them in black suits for the 'wedding' they are instructed to claim to attend in Tel Aviv, to sending them off at the designated spot is relentlessly filmed.  Said and Khaled accept their roles although with varying degrees of emotional commitment.  At the point where the lads are to begin their martyrdom venture they are separated and the story is how each continues living, each now alone.

The families and the perpetrators of the scheme are well drawn by a strong cast, with one female role Suha (Lubna Azabal) as a voice of reason and peace standing out particularly strongly.  The sensitivity of the actors Kais Nashef and Ali Suliman keeps this drama from sinking into politicism and instead allows us to understand the inner turmoil of the two men they portray as they cope with their duties and their lives.

This is a powerful document that serves as a plea for peace wherever terrorism is a factor - and now that is global.  If more of us could watch and absorb films such as PARADISE NOW perhaps the itinerant boundaries separating mankind by misunderstanding could be reduced without the need for war.

What I will say is how moved I was and how I appreciated the fact that there was no happy ending, no ""Let's tie up all the loose strings"", no ""Everyone has to leave happy"" type hollywood ending. This movie is what Hollywood needs more of, but will never make because the ""masses"" just won't support them.

While taking on a topic that is definately uncomfortable to watch in this day and age, this film manages to make you care about the bombers and for 90 minutes, you understand and feel for the men set on destroying life. It was a fascinating look at what may have actually happened in the 48 hours prior to many of the headlines we see on tv new programs every night.

If you have watched those Vietnam-war films, from Deer Hunter (1979) to Full Metal Jacket (1987), you will understand what I mean. Paradise Now (2005) is the first film about the current middle-east situation makes it to the American public. Even there are other features, drama or documentary, they are less well known if not unheard of. The film is written in a controversial manner from beginning to the end. If you think or expect it to be simply pro or anti terrorism, you should watch it again.

The film starts with two good friends being invited to do a suicide bombing and things went wrong during the first attempt and the occurring in between force them to think about nature of the matter before they decide to commit themselves to the second one.

Terrorists are portrayed in a satirical way and pacifists are portrayed as idealists if not nave. If you cut out the bombing part, it is about the daily life of people living there in ""National Geographic"" style. Like many films of similar nature, portray of two protagonists from similar background facing the same situation; their proximities and differences are there to reveal the nature of the subject. If one pretend all these happened in nineteenth century or farther away, the subtleties and intention of the film will be more obvious to our eyes.

The long-suffering Palestinian people in fact had a territory, prior to the Balfour Agreement, and contrary to the terms of that agreement, which stipulated a land equally divided between Zionists and Palestinians, they were deposed of territory, property and independence.  Their homes were confiscated and they were sent into refugee camps.  After long negotiations and several wars they were granted provisional rights of habitation, but parts of their land were then given over to illegal settlements, and the rest was occupied by Israel.  Any protest was punished with torture, imprisonment or worse.  And while Israel grew and prospered, the Palestinian territories gradually fell into decay, a condition made worse by persistent bulldozing of homes, disruption of services and uprooting of entire sectors of the population.  Suicide bombings are only a pathetic, and certainly misguided, display of desperation, in response to decades of injustice.  That is what the film is really about.  And a very effective film it is, despite faults in continuity, and hectic subtitles, long and difficult to read so fast.

I simply cannot believe it; Israel participated in the making of the film and it is an anti terrorist film. Or else I did not understand anything. Mind you, the subtitles were bloody fast!  We are in Palestine. Two long-term friends with little future are manipulated and convinced to be suicide bombers. One of them, Khaled, talks with the daughter of a Palestinian dead hero and is shocked to hear she is not impressed by his action, that there are better ways. The other one, Said, has a guilt complex due to his father being a collaborator. The machiavelic manipulators don't miss the opportunity to exploit their state of mind. Khaled and Said are both the ideal young, inexperienced and aimless victims of ruthless and cold extremists. The film is sober, beautiful and terribly powerful. My favourite scene is when they are recording the martyr video. Khaled talks about freedom, pride, patriotism, mother's love while the manipulators are eating a sandwich in a total indifference.

I just want to say, in response to other viewers, and to those who may want to see the film or the video, that the claims that some reviewers make about the film--that it glorifies suicide bombings, that it is one-sided, that it condones violence--are utterly false. The film does not condone suicide bombings or anything of the sort. Rather, the film shows how such violence shatters worlds. What the film does is plunge the viewer into the midst of a situation most of us are aware exists, but know all too little about. The movie does so so vividly that you feel you are there, amidst the house-studded hillsides, ramshackle poverty, & isolated moments of beauty within Nablus. (I haven't been there, but apparently the movie was filmed largely in Nablus, until the danger of the situation forced filming to shift to Nazareth, so most of the footage of the city was indeed shot on location.) The movie is set in the Palestinian territories not as a slight to Israel, but rather because that is where suicide bombers happen to come from; it's a real place, even if nobody's been able to fit it politically onto the modern world-map. In my opinion, based on having just seen the movie, ""Paradise Now"" does *not* take sides, let alone in favor of suicide bombing, but rather presents a wide range of views about the conflict, with those of Suha, the young woman who argues most passionately against suicide bombings, specifically set up by the plot and the director so as to be at the forefront of the viewer's attention and sympathies. The movie is simply one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen. I recommend you see it as soon as possible if you have not done so already.",1140739200,68,1833,4.608562691131499

Simply looking at the stark contrast between the landscape of infrastructure in Israel and the West Bank is educational as to what is really going on here.  Israel receives more foreign aid from the U.S. than all other foreign aid recipients combined!  Can these people not find a way to live together?  Is it not our responsibility to help? The burden here is not all on Israel.  However, as the film makes clear: the random bombings are felt to be justified by the continued violence which is perpetrated and perpetuated by the occupation.
But the question runs deeper that the war between Israel and Palestine.  Regardless of who is found to be at fault by whom, 'haves' must find a way to accommodate their brother and sister 'have-nots' in this world, which now is delimited by a nuclear option.
This challenge is raised here.  The suicide bomber is humanized. The film performs the admirable service of showing us that we are all human, Semitic, Caucasian - whoever.  And we are searching for our humanity.  If we do not find it now, in this generation, all, very likely, is lost.  The desperation of that search is mirrored in the desperation of the suicide bomber.
The film puts a human face on radical Islam and gives the reasons why it does.  The human face of the perpetration of violence must be seen.  Rage emerges from the witness of injustice. We must confront that rage and put and end to the violence, which is its inevitable expression when there appears to be no other salvation.
The tension in the film reaches a classic grandeur.  The one ""must see"" film of 2005.",1139356800,16,1701,4.667785234899329
2476700,5,B000E0OE44,"Very relevant and great movie. It shows many different sides, although the movie does not claim to be a history or documentary of the region. Watch to understand something that goes on. And although politics prevent ""Palestine"" from appearing on  a map- it does not mean it is not there.

Amazing move. Highly recommended, especially to those who DO NOT agree with suicide bombings.",1138924800,14,382,4.953125
2476701,5,B000E0OE44,"The characters, inhabiting a world we only know abstractly, become so real for us in this film! I think that is what prompts the vitriolic responses some critics have made who talk only about ideology and politics, not about what they have seen in the film itself. OF COURSE it makes us very uncomfortable to see people who are doing things we recognize as bad, and are, by culture and nationality, loyal to the other side of an issue, as human beings who might be our neighbors or relatives; people not that unlike ourselves. That is so with these two conflicted young men, whose experiences touch on the humdrum as well as the dramatic; on rueful comedy as well as on tragedy. These are people we laugh with as well as feel anguish with (remember the quarrel with the auto repair customer, or the scene in the video store where the prices of videos of martyrs vs. collaborators are haggled over?) Then there is unforgettable poignance in such moments as when these Palestinian would-be bombers see Israeli children, getting on a bus, flying a kite, etc., and you know why they are frozen in miserable inaction! (How did the critics who call this film lacking in empathy for the terrorists' victims miss these scenes? Look again!)And the ending doesn't tie any truth up for us; we have to try to figure it out. Like life!",1138233600,16,1322,4.629787234042553
2476702,1,B000E0OE44,"I do happen to aggree with Erica too and I bet she wasn't being funny with her geography.  You see, you should go and take out a current atlas and try to find Palestine.  You might be looking for a while.  Having made that point, I do think this movie glorified terrrorists, and in America our tolerance of these bombers should be extremely low.  They have two choices.  They could spend their lives enjoying what they have and spending time with their families and friends, or they could strap themselves with explosives and blow themselves up along with innocent people.  To regular people, there is no choice.  This movie was extrememly one sided and unfair toward the people who live in fear all the time yet choose the right thing to do and that's to act civilised and not to kill people.",1138147200,28,793,4.542253521126761
2476703,1,B000E0OE44,"This movie makes these terrorists out to be martyres.  They are not.  They are cowards who blow up innocent people.  I thought we were supposed to be opposed to terrorists.  The information on this page says this is set in Palestine.  When I last looked on a map or atlas, there is no country called Palastine.  I don't recommend this movie to anyone.  Your money would be better spent on almost anything else.",1138060800,27,410,4.534246575342466
2476704,5,B000E0OE44,"I saw this movie in the cinema 2 days ago.  I have to say it was the most awesome portrayl of the Palestinian situation- to every hit the movie screen. It speaks to people on a real basic level, one where the viewer is forced to think about how they would deal with this situation when every other option was taken away from them.

I also loved how it alluded to the idea of Palestine having a battered wife syndrome at the hands of Isreal.  As in they cycle of violence, the purpetrator almost always blames the victim and then claims they are truely the ones being vicimized.

I loved this movie and cannot wait to buy it on DVD.

A big THANK YOU to the people who made & participated in this film!",1137974400,18,700,4.1940298507462686
