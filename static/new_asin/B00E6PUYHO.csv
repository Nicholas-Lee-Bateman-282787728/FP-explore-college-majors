8602119,1,B00E6PUYHO,"Is it any surprise to see so many 5 star fake reviews when a movie portrays that Danny Trejo at least be in more than 3 minutes of the movie? I almost gave it two stars as it is semi-watchable, but seeing as they are trying so hard to pull one over on the audience, I moved it to 1 star. If you watch this movie expecting a movie that Danny Trejo is in, you'll be sorely disappointed and turn it off 45 minutes through, after seeing not even 1 full minute of Danny. Skimming forward, there appears to be another short scene thrown in. I get that Danny isn't picky and he is a workaholic but trying to fool the audience by putting Danny on the cover is akin to having a naked woman feed you dog doo thinking it will make it taste filet mignon. Aside from that, the main character's emotional range is wooden and doesn't come off as naturally in character.",1484352000,,854,4.181818181818182

8602121,1,B00E6PUYHO,"I like Danny Trejo. He was terrific in ""Heat"", but then again...who wasn't? That is because of the director: Michael Mann. Everything else Trejo has done is mediocre at best. This film is true garbage. Watch ""Heat"" instead.",1483747200,,223,4.894736842105263

8602124,1,B00E6PUYHO,"First of all, Trejo has only a supporting role. The lead actor is an untalented nobody in a ""thriller"" that is basically a Lifetime movie with some profanity thrown in. Predictable, poorly written and acted and technically inept. I've found that if a movie shows up on Prime I've never heard of, there is usually a good reason for that. Watch The Machinist if you want to watch a good thriller about a man wrestling with insomnia and skip this stinker. The performance by the actor playing the wife is one of the worst I've ever seen",1480118400,,533,4.505154639175258
8602125,2,B00E6PUYHO,"The Insomniac is a somewhat watchable thriller / mystery that has entirely too many 5 star reviews, a real problem here and on IMDB. People vastly overrating a movie to the maximum number of stars because they have a personal attachment to the film is ruining the rating systems that have been reliable for many years. Not the worst movie but not the best either, I saw only 2 stars.",1479168000,,383,4.485714285714286
8602126,5,B00E6PUYHO,"John Figg (Eddy Salazar) thought his world was pretty cushy. A recent work promotion, a loving girlfriend. The only bummer has been the recent death of his beloved father. Now he has moved into his dad's house to settle the estate. Soon afterwards his car is stolen and a few days later this house is broken into. In a believable turn of character, he turns into an extremely paranoid, edgy guy. He purchases a gun and turns into an insomniac suspicious about nearly everyone. I read where Eddy Salazar lost a lot of weight to portray this character. The make-up on him is outstanding and truly shows a crazed, tortured guy. The cinematography is outstanding, the cast amazing and the writing solid and suspenseful. Definitely two thumbs up for me!",1478736000,,748,4.7615384615384615
