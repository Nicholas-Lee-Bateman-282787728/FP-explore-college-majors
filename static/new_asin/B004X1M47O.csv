4491225,5,B004X1M47O,I was glad to see this finally released. This is CBS entertainment when it was at its best. Blake and the other characters from Dynasty performed excellently. This program's flashy excessiveness and luxury are typical of the 80s. If you like this I also recommend that you get the Dallas DVD.,1310860800,2,292,4.745098039215686
4491226,5,B004X1M47O,Great to see CBS Entertainment releasing the fifth season all at once. Hope they continue with this through the final four seasons.,1306454400,6,131,5.0

Si no no tendria sentido ya que esta temporada ya esta editada en ingles mucho mas economica en UK.Y perderian muchas ventas innecesariamente lo cual querria decir que no continuarian con las demas temporadas.",1304467200,,385,4.848484848484849
4491228,5,B004X1M47O,"On the same day that ""Dynasty: Season 5-Volume 1"" arrives in stores (which is July 5, 2011) ""Dynasty: Season 5-Volume 2"" will be made available. You can also purchase these boxsets individually or in a special two set bundle.

 Volume two is on 4 dics and features the last 14 episodes of the 1984-1985 televison season that aired on ABC. The shows themselves look beautiful, are in full frame format, and come in English mono the way they were originally broadcast. This was the year ""Dynasty"" finally became the #1 show in North America knocking ""Dallas"" out of the top peg.

 The last 14 shows dealt with Daniel Reese's attempt to lure Krystle away from Blake; Alexis' realization that her daughter slept with her husband, and the most infamous cliffhanger of all-time with the Moldavian wedding massacre, an episode that would be the highest-rated episode of ""Dynasty"".

 Like other ""Dynasty"" DVD sets (with the exception of season 1) there are no bonus features.

 The following is a list of the last 14 episodes from season 5, their airdates, and a short summary of the plots:

1. ""Foreign Relations"", Jan. 23, 1985 (Ali McGraw's first appearance and Jeff gets married)

2. ""Triangles"", Jan 30, 1985 (Steven and Luke separate)

3. ""The Ball"", Feb. 6, 1985 (The infamous episode where an AIDS infected Rock Hudson kisses Linda Evans in a love scene that leads to widespread panic in the Hollywood community leading actresses to renegotiate their contracts insisting if they didn't want to kiss an actor then they shouldn't)

4. ""Circumstantial Evidence"", Feb. 13, 1985 (Amanda become engaged to a prince)

5. ""The Collapse"". Feb. 20, 1985 (Dominique and Alexis face off)

6. ""Life and Death"", Feb. 27, 1985 (Dominique has heart surgery)

7. ""Parental Consent"", March 6, 1985 (Amanda and Michael prepare to marry in Moldavia)

8. ""Photo Finish"", March 13, 1985 (Sammy Jo meets a Krystle look-a-like named Rita in New York City and puts her plan in motion)

9. ""The Crash"", March 20, 1985 (Blake is involved in a plane crash with Daniel Reese)

10. ""Reconciliation"", March 27, 1985 (Sammy Jo learns who her real father is)

11. ""Sammy Jo"", April 3, 1985 (Sammy Jo meets her dad)

12. ""Kidnap"", April 10, 1985 (Emma Samms first appearance as the new Fallon)

13. ""The Heiress"", May 8, 1985 (It is learned that Sammy Jo has been awarded a large estate from her father)

14. ""Royal Wedding"", May 15, 1985 (The wedding episode where terrorists shoot the crowd in the Church leaving everyone for dead)",1303344000,14,2499,4.84433962264151

4491234,5,B004X1M47O,"This is Dynasty at its peak, No 1 in the US and the rest of the world...the season finale MOLDAVIAN MASSACRE takes your breath away.",1409443200,,132,4.32
4491235,5,B004X1M47O,"I have been trying to locate this season, great package",1409270400,,55,4.6
4491236,4,B004X1M47O,"Season 5 features more of the exploits of Blake and Krystal Carrington and their various children and relations.  I felt like Dominique's character wasn't utilized as much as she could have been (her storylines, and appearances, seemed much more limited than before) but all of the other actors are on point.  There is the introduction of Emma Samms as the new Fallon, though she only appears briefly before the end of the season, and the infamous ""Moldavia Massacre"" cliffhanger episode at the end of the season is really well done and suspenseful (since it happened more than 25 years ago, I had already picked up on ""spoilers"" that told me who lives and who doesn't, but I can imagine that people watching it at the time would have been in an absolute uproar!)

In terms of the DVD collection itself, it is similar to the others in the series: clear plastic, with disc trays that snap into holders on the spine of the case.  The printing is bright and well designed.  If you loved this when it was on, or just want to experience a real slice of 80s glamour and excess (the fashions on parade are UNREAL!), this collection is well worth a look.  I don't love that each season comes out in two volumes, but there are enough episodes per set to keep me entertained.",1399766400,,1265,4.5506607929515415
4491237,5,B004X1M47O,"""Dynasty"" is just filled with bubbles...of the champagne variety and of the soapy kind.  Yes, it's a nighttime soap; but the bubbles from this soap are diamond encrusted and a sight to behold just like ""Dynasty"" itself.

Watching this show always feels like a special occasion.  The romance of Blake (John Forsythe) and Krystle (Linda Evans), the parties, and people who dress for dinner...I mean really dress for dinner in glorious clothes.  Those elements you can always count on.  Add to that:  a prince, a proposal, the addition of Ali MacGraw, Heather Locklear as Sammi Jo causing all kinds of problems and guzzling champagne or root beer floats while she's at it, a wedding, a main character who collapses, infidelity, some mysterious photos, a kidnapping, foreign intrigue, a man who wants his brother's wife & his father's company and one shocking cliffhanger where all may be lost.

In the second half of season 5, which aired in 1985, there are 15 episodes of very good color and quality.  There's one very short special feature; a 1985 Entertainment Tonight interview with Rock Hudson about his role on the show.

I highly recommend ""Dynasty"" if you want pure guilty-pleasure fun.  But remember, Alexis wouldn't feel guilty at all...she would watch it with caviar and Dom Perignon.",1393632000,,1292,4.9953271028037385
4491238,3,B004X1M47O,"As a teenager, used to love this show. I know that I'm giving away my age here, but that's fine since I've earned every passing one. I've obviously grown up since it's just okay. As a teenager, I used to look forward to each episode with great anticipation. the storylines and the lines spat by the actors were juicy and ahead of their time. Now, as I watch the show, I find I get irritated by the foolishness of it all after just one DVD and I have to stop it and watch something else. For its time though, while it lasted, Dynasty was a great show with a great ensemble cast that worked along and off of one another. The fashions were beautiful; something no other nighttime soap offered. This was the first season without Pamela Sue Martin as daughter Fallon and the first season for the appearance of long lost daughter Amanda portrayed by English actress Catherine Oxenberg. In my humble opinion, the earlier shows were the best, especially seasons two through four and excluding season one, which was bloody awful.
Overall, if you're a fan of nighttime soap operas, pure escapism and racy plotlines, there's no reason why you shouldn't enjoy this season. Just be sure not to expect Shakespeare. Who! Wait a minute! Dynasty is to its day what Shakespeare was to his day. I do detest the way that these DVDs are being released in the USA. It shows how badly the studio wants to squeeze this country for every dollar it can get where in Australia and the UK, this isn't the case.",1393027200,,1482,4.5130111524163565
4491239,5,B004X1M47O,Great series to view and buy!  Quality of DVD is very good.  I recommend it;  especially to those who saw the tv series when it first aired.  Brings back some memories.,1390780800,,168,4.32258064516129
4491240,5,B004X1M47O,I chose the five stars becauce the picture for clear and it gave me the experence of watching it for the first time on teevision. It was like going to the movies and watching the move without interuptions.,1370736000,,205,4.421052631578948
4491241,5,B004X1M47O,"It is Dynasty in the best form. At least, for me. The show had rating 24.8 % from January to May 1985 and the audience loved it. There is the most known cliffhanger of Dynasty, the most shocking kiss, the longest gay plotline in the history of the show and both Linda Evans and Joan Collins had an important place in the script (later, the character of Krystle became pointless). The biggest overstep is Claudia and Adam as a couple (but in season 6 it was even worse when they became married). And I miss Pamela Sue Martin a lot. But still, this is very self-confidente, strong and successful Dynasty.",1370304000,,602,4.4818181818181815
4491242,4,B004X1M47O,"I Havent really seen this show since the 80s but recently got hooked again. Although sometimes over the top, it really is a very dramatic and suspenseful show, the cliffhangers are to die for! I don't think you can find a series today where the leads are in their 40s and 50s and still sexy, bitchy and give it all they've got! You go Alexis!!!!! By the way, you can stream the whole series on Amazon Prime excdpt for season 5! WTF!!! Go watch it now, you know you want to!",1364601600,,473,4.208791208791209
4491243,4,B004X1M47O,"I had decided that I was going to watch all 9 series about a year ago. I grew up watching this show. It is pretty funny to see the clothes, make up, hair styles, smoking, drinking, and the characters again. You must remember that the DVD quality has not been digitally remastered! Good for a laugh...",1364515200,,300,4.375
4491244,3,B004X1M47O,I was disappointed when I was watching the DVD's because more than one of them would stick and I would have to restart the episode over and then advance to find where I left off.  This was very unnerving after the fourth or fifth time.  This also happened with episodes on Volume 1.,1361750400,,282,4.30188679245283

4491246,4,B004X1M47O,"There can never be enough drama, twists and turns.  The only down side is this season does not have othar language subtitles... It's a shame I cant share it with my spanish speaking mother.",1361404800,,189,4.5588235294117645

4491248,5,B004X1M47O,"Dynasty is my favorite TV show of all time, so this review is biased!  Volume 2 has 4 discs, looks great on wide screen HD TV.  Disc one has the famous kiss scene with Rock Hudson and Linda Evans (Linda panicked when news of  Rock's AIDS got out).  This set also has the Season Finale Moldavian massacre.  I've  watched Seasons 1- 5 Vol. 1 from Netflix, but Vol. 2 never made it to Netflix.  Fortunately Amazon had it at a reasonable price.",1355875200,,440,4.2926829268292686
