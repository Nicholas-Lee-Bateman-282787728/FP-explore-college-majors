8579968,3,B00CBMXMRI,"Good visual presentation

Poor tracking of note information on instructional track

Poor reference of which muscles are under or over

At the very high cost of the disk, it is rather stunning to have Mr. Hu close with "" Well actually how much would you use this......not much, it is actually better to use push pull "" .....why did I just watch 2 hours of the wrong thing.

The section of muscles in relationship to expression was really good, that was well done.

I am only giving it one star because it is of the way the presentation was organized, the content is great, but for the cost it could been a little better in its delivery.

Areas for improvement:

1) Think out the numbering, labeling  and placement of muscles  rather than making it up on the fly , the current  process is distracting
2) Don't over draw the same lines so much , it either looks like you are not sure or that you have OCS (Obsessive compulsive sketchitis, don't know when you have beaten the line to death).
3) If push pull is better than explain that difference and show it for the muscles
4) Pre draw your model with a variety of expressions so, in your life portrait sketch you can say, ""Ok here is an example of how that expression knowledge translates into the art of drawing"" so while you are sketching that part of the face, you can say, ok here is how this would have looked happy, sad, angry etc. then cutting the video over to the pre drawn expression of the model for the major expressions.
5) Do a pro and cons chart of push and pull vs. ""muscle detailed knowledge "", when is each technique better.
6) Draw an overlay of the muscles onto the completed live portrait, explain why and how you chose to not over define the muscle in the drawing.
7) Do one drawing of the live person , and show where different light directions would impact the major muscle light shadow landmarks if there were an error
8) Make up a real face , drawn without being a muscle map diagram , and without using a live person or portrait photograph.

I will buy all of the videos, the issue is not that they are not good the issue is they should be more polished with more examples and less video time wasted on pieces and then not pulling all the pieces together.",1446076800,,2230,4.349397590361446
8579969,4,B00CBMXMRI,i thought the video was quite clear. I understood about the underlying muscles of the face and the demos were good. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn about facial anatomy and how to draw it.,1399507200,,208,4.358974358974359
