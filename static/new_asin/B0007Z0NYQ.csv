2253331,4,B0007Z0NYQ,"""A Very Long Engagement"" is a true epic French film, and worth seeing if you are at all willing to see foreign cinema.  Unlike many smaller-scale French films, which typically don't have the budgets of major Hollywood spectaculars, AVLE is a richly textured, wonderfully detailed period piece showing France during and just after World War I.  The cinematography and settings alone are worth the price of admission, and the scenes of trench warfare are unforgettably poignant.

AVLE is a multi-layered film.  At its heart it is a love story that asks the question: when should a person give up on a loved one, and accept what appears to be reality?  It also shows the tremendous impact that war has on families, lovers, and other aspects of ""normal"" life, and can perhaps help explain the tremendous aversion to war that even today the French have.  The film shows both the good and the bad sides of the romanticism of its French characters.  And finally, the film is also an intricate puzzle to be solved.  It is this last aspect of the film that I wasn't able to follow by seeing the film just once:  the clues that the main character puts together flew by so quickly that I wasn't able to follow them all through to the conclusion.  At times, I was so wrapped up in the film that I forgot that I was reading subtitles, but I just didn't focus enough attention on this aspect of the plot to keep up with the rapid-fire developments.

AVLE has all the ingredients of a successful epic film: excellent settings, costumes, cinematography, acting, and a storyline.  If the film were made in the US and the actors spoke English, it would probably be a success (in this country) on the order of ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Schindler's List"".  For those who are willing to read subtitles, AVLE can be almost as enjoyable as an epic mainstream Hollywood film.",1105401600,3,1851,4.658461538461538
2253332,5,B0007Z0NYQ,"This is a film you are going to either love or hate. There is quite a bit of graphic violence (World War I trench warfare), particularly in the first fifteen minutes or so, but much of this film is definitely from a female viewpoint, and plot revolves around the protagonist's quest to find her missing lover. Without being preachy, this in an anti-war film that shows war as ugly, cruel, and rather pointless. The only thing I have seen that is rather like this was the English Patient -- sort of a chick flick with explosions. If you really loved the English Patient, you will probably love this.",1105228800,5,598,4.546296296296297
2253333,5,B0007Z0NYQ,"A romantic French WWI epic, this is a story about two life-long lovers, Mathilde and Manech, separated by the war.  Having lost both parents in a transit disaster and crippled by polio, Mathilde has little more than her imagination and memories to comfort her while she anxiously awaits the return of her fianc&eacute;e Manech.  She refuses to accept the news of a German siege at his location as a sure sign of his demise, and even a visit to his grave isn't convincing enough.  She enlists the aid of a bumbling investigator to find some leads, but ultimately it is Mathilde herself, strapped with resolute determination, piecing together the intricate pieces of the puzzle that make up the fate of her beloved Manech.  Like in Jeunet's ""Amelie"" we are led through a gauntlet of mysterious, passionate, and perverse characters.  One of those characters is played by Jodie Foster, who delivers quite a blazing performance in just a few minutes on screen.  Director Jeunet creates a contrast of realities by cutting from the beautiful French countryside to the bustle of Paris, and of course to the WWI battlefield.  The battlefield scenes are not for the squeamish - filmed with such nightmarish realism that rivals the brutality depicted in the famous opening minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan.""  This is an immensely moving story about hope, stuffed with humor, horror, and humanity.  Photographed with such painful dreamlike beauty and set to a haunting score, A Very Long Engagement is one of the year's most magnificent films.

Ironically enough, this film has been shunned by French critics for being ""too American.""  Unfortunately American audiences will mostly stay way from a film spoken in French (though it is subtitled very well in English).  Americans love war movies, and this is one of the very best to be made in the past decade.  Be brave and see a film with subtitles, and you will not regret your decision.

Recommended if you liked:  Cold Mountain, The English Patient, Amelie.",1104624000,14,1996,4.969879518072289
2253334,5,B0007Z0NYQ,"This film is lovely, beautiful, fascinating. A real story of sadness and love. I was moved and touched by the portrayal of a woman who loved a man very, very deeply and even when staring at his grave never gave up hope. Wonderous... Also the hell of war - all in one package...",1104105600,7,277,4.245283018867925
2253335,2,B0007Z0NYQ,"I went into this movie with high expectations, and to say the least I was very disappointed. I had to ask myself if this was just a bad comedy or a bad drama because there are so many elements intertwined that I couldn't tell the differece.(A quick example would be the whole tuba thing. I thought that was pretty funny, but no one else in the theatre was laughing when she first started playing it. She also played it during very somber times in the movies. If they were trying to be serious, they failed.)

I don't even know where to begin(which is a main reason I disliked this movie). There is just so much stuff going on, that the movie completely loses sight of the main love story. The director gets so caught up in his cute tricks, and cgi splattered intestines, that he doesn't invest enough time with the characters we should care about.

There are so many names and faces you have to keep track of in order to get any satisfaction out of the detective part of the story. When the ""AH HA"" part of the movie came, I was too confused to care. The detective story is just plain nuts. I mean give me a break. Murder By Death has more plausible story line than this movie.

The whole story is like a ADD wonderland. A clip here, another clip there. Wouldn't you think that the two lovers' relationship(prior to the war) would be important? There must not be more than 10 minutes of footage dedicated to their life before the war. The longest pre-war conversation they have consists the boy making fun of the girl when they are 9 or 10. How are we supposed to know these people and why should we care about them?

There are some parts that are quite touching, when they actually let the people talk, and I thought acting was generally good, considering the directing. I think there should have been a much more somber attitude to the entire movie because the fun ends every time the trench warfare is shown. At the end of things, I saw this movie as nothing more than a slightly-above-average-Hollywood-special effects-fluff fest...",1104105600,6,2036,4.494594594594594
2253336,4,B0007Z0NYQ,"It is quite difficult to form an accurate opinion of 'A Very Long Engagement'. While the Audrey Tatou scenes in the French countryside are charmingly Amelie-esque, it is hard to balance those with war portions of the film. While both parts are done exceedingly well, I don't really feel that they can happily co-exist within the same film. Basically, Jeunet has created Amelie within a war film, and this is a particularly difficult and uncomfortable concept that fostered a lack of cohesion within the film.

Furthermore, as an English speaker watching 'A Very Long Engagement', I would suggest that the film can only truly be grasped on further viewing. Because there is so much happening within the frame, it is quite difficult to concentrate on both the pictures and the subtitles. Irrespective of this, the characters and plot can get somewhat confusing and the narration is occasionally quite choppy.

While this was my overriding sentiment, 'A Very Long Engagement' is wonderfully realised and the tiny artistic touches (like 'Amelie') are exceptionally beautiful. The film is incredibly romantic, unique and a real break from other films released in 2004.

While it is clearly flawed, it is truly a blessing to be able to view something with such unusual beauty and these flaws are minimalised because of Jeunet's creative vision.",1103500800,3,1338,5.128440366972477
2253337,5,B0007Z0NYQ,"Sure, the name is an open target for dumb jokes. But Sbastien Japrisot's haunting romance ""A Very Long Engagement"" translates well onto the big screen, with a bit of help from ""Amelie"" director Jean-Pierre Jeunet and the wonderful Audrey Tautou.

Mathilde (Audrey Tautou) is a pretty young girl who was left crippled by polio, and is being raised by her uncle and aunt. Before World War I, she fell in love with a boy called Manech (Gaspard Ulliel), but he was sent to the war and killed. Three years later, Mathilde gets a mysterious letter with shocking news: Manech was not killed in action, but condemned to death by being sent unarmed to the front lines -- and miraculously, he might still be alive.

Mathilde is determined to find her lover -- dead or alive -- and learn what really happened on that day three years ago. So she puts out ads in the papers, gathers accounts, and hires a detective to follow the cold trail. And slowly the gaps in the stories emerge, giving Mathilde clues to whether Manech died... and where he might be now.

""A Very Long Engagement"" (French title: ""Un Long Dimanche de Fianailles"") diddles a few details from the novel, but is faithful to it in the ways that matter -- the ""MMM"" inscriptions, the non-linear storytelling, the horrors of World War I. In some ways, it seems almost impossible to transfer onto film without creating a pretentious mess -- but it wasn't.

Jean-Pierre Jeunet proves that ""Amelie"" was no fluke, but this time he relies mostly on visual artistry, rather than in magical realism. He also reminds us, by displaying the French countryside along with flashbacks of the front lines, that war is stupid and wasteful. But it's not an obvious, slam-in-your-face reminder. Like the romance, it's delicate and wistful.

The only problem with ""A Very Long Engagement"" is the ""long"" part -- it's truly exquisite, but it does drag a bit. Since it can be summed up as ""girl searches for her seemingly dead lover,"" there are only a few twists along the way. But the beautiful visuals may make up for that in part. The cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel is particularly striking, tinted in sepia or black and white. The entire movie has the feeling of an old photograph brought to life.

The love between Manech and Mathilde is not a grand passion, but it is a very real love -- it's not implausible to believe that two such people might have existed. Tautou is sweetly elfin as Mathilde, creating a likable heroine that it's impossible not to root for. Ulliel gives an equally good performance as the boyish, naive Manech, a perfect match for Mathilde.

""A Very Long Engagement"" is a truly beautiful follow-up to the magical ""Amelie"" -- a war story, a love story, and a mystery all in one. Enchanting.",1103241600,52,2750,4.704781704781705
2253338,4,B0007Z0NYQ,"It's difficult to combine a charming, almost quaint love story with a grand, very intense war epic without getting some mixed results.  That's how I left the theatre after watching A Very Long Engagement - feeling mixed.

On the one hand, the overarching story of a woman desperately clinging to hope of her one true love's return is as sweet and heartwarming as Buttercup in The Princess Bride.  In Audrey Tautou, Jean-Pierre Jeunet really has found the perfect embodiment of young, almost misguided, love.  Tautou plays Mathilde with such sincerity and devotion that, like Amelie, you can't help but root for her.  That's important because Mathilde is the axis around which the story revolves and everything comes back to her.  She launches her own inquiry as to what really happened at Bingo Crepuscule, the place soldiers accused of self-mutilation or treason were sent to die.  And that leads to the second movie within a movie.

The war portion of AVLE is a gritty, dirty, bare bones portrayal.  I hesitate to use the word ""realistic"" because my basis for comparison is basically other war movies.  However, what Jeunet does capture realistically are the feelings of hopelessness and the desire to be home.  Home is normalcy, family, love, and warmth.  War is a dark, muddy bleakness that goes for miles on end.  It's easy to say that soldiers who mutilate themselves to get back home are driven to the brink by madness, but is it crazier to stay and very possibly die for a cause you're not entirely sure about or try and do anything in your power to get back to your loved ones?  This movie isn't a moral judgment on soldiers or warfare but it explores the things that are done in the name of war and the effects it has on those left behind.

One notable performance aside from Tautou of course is Marion Cotillard as Tina Lombardi, the girlfriend of another of the condemned soldiers who is also looking for her love.  Her methods are slightly different from Mathilde's but it's interesting to see just how similar they are.

I really enjoyed both parts of AVLE.  Jeunet captures the little idiosyncracies of people like no one else.  One example is how we always make deals with ourselves to change our fate - for example, ""If I hold my breath until the end of the tunnel then I'll make it to work on time.""  Another of Jeunet's trademarks are the wonderful characters that surround the heroine.  In this case, the doting aunt and uncle, the postman, and the private investigator to name a few.  I left feeling mixed because you literally go through your entire emotional range during the movie - laughter and happiness to just utter horror and sadness.  By the end, you're almost too depleted to make a definitive determination on the movie.  There are also a lot of characters and the soldiers especially, who spend alot of time being covered in mud and dirt, are difficult to tell apart.  When their personal stories came up, I found myself asking ""Now which one is he again?""  In that sense, I think you really need to see it twice in order to make a final assessment.  Perhaps I'll go watch it again and update my review.

All in all, this is a movie you almost have to watch again to clarify all the different characters, but it's one that is WORTH watching again.  I really enjoyed the love story and I really enjoyed the war story - both are incredibly done.  But the combination of the two really makes AVLE an epic - an epic story and an epic emotional rollercoaster.  Because of all the ups and downs, you almost need the ending to be really sad or really happy, just to get some closure, but that's the one emotion the movie didn't offer.",1102636800,11,3660,4.6191950464396285
2253339,4,B0007Z0NYQ,"A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT, the World War I romance that I saw in sneak preview yesterday, was directed by the same guy who made AMELIE and starred the same actress from AMELIE and looked a lot like AMELIE and seemed like it really, really wanted to remind us of AMELIE. But A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT is darker and way more complicated than AMELIE, and, to me, it was confusing and a lot less satisfying.

A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT is beautiful to look at, first of all. It gives us beautiful shots of Brittany - and it features some amazing battle sequences from the trenches of World War I.

Its love story features two young, innocent kids named Manech and Mathilde, who have loved each other since they were very small. Mathilde caught polio as a child and, in the film, walks with a limp. (In the novel, she's in a wheelchair.)

The movie begins by showing us that Manech, sent to the front, goes crazy, tries to get out of the war, gets convicted for treason and sentenced to a horrible, horrible death. He's sentenced to walk out onto the battlefield unarmed with four other men, where the enemy will attack at morning.

A few years later, Mathilde, who has been told that Manech was killed, refuses to believe it and investigates the intricacies of what happened on that battlefield that day.

As details pile up and characters from the trenches start to reveal layers of secrets, the film becomes a confusing, twisted puzzle involving dozens of characters, some of whom are hard to keep straight.

A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT is another story from Jeunet featuring complications of fate and how a plucky, moon-faced girl chooses to navigate her way through it. You still cheer for Audrey Tautou and want her character to find what she's looking for. But it doesn't ""work"" the way AMELIE does.",1101081600,9,1786,4.636075949367089

2253349,5,B0007Z0NYQ,"Before watching A Very Long Engagement, I'd seen much of Madame Tautou's work as well as Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Le Fabuleux destin d'Amelie Poulain, so my expectations were very high. I'm pleased to say that this monumental film has surpassed them.

Engagement is a work of art and an unutterably gutwrenching display of the deepest and most common human miseries caused by war. Jeunet is a master at depicting the horror and unnecessary violence war causes. Tautou is a master as well at depicting the dull, throbbing pain she feels due to her separation from the man she loves. But it's more than that: one of the things that draws me to Jeunet, and French cinema in general, is the depiction of life. Yes, A Very Long Engagement is a tragic film, but it still depicts life. And that's what adds so much veracity to Jeunet's storytelling: he weaves real life into his drama, and he does it so well.

A Very Long Engagement is a gorgeous cinematic experience, and I highly recommend it.",1457654400,,985,4.687861271676301

BTW I did find it a little hard to follow the names and nicknames of the soldiers. ...not your typical ""war movie"".

2253524,5,B0007Z0NYQ,"Most North Americans have either never heard of Audrey Tautou, or know her because she appeared in Amelie or The Da Vinci Code. The biggest hurdle is that the majority of her films are French, and I'm well aware that more than 90 percent of people can't stand subtitles. That's a shame, because Tautou is a fantastic actress. She's physically attractive, but her acting contains a depth of emotion that is even more beautiful. It's easy to root for her characters. Just look into those soulful dark eyes and see how much emotion she conveys without saying a word.

Jean-Pierre Jeunet is an extremely quirky director, and his films have an unmistakable style. Think of him as a French version of Wes Anderson or Quentin Tarantino; at least in terms of humor. Although this film contains more serious subject matter than Amelie, that humor is still there. I usually watch it with a grin on my face and tears in my eyes.

So, what is A Very Long Engagement about? Well, it's set during World War 1, and the first 15 minutes might lead you to believe that it's a war film, but it's actually an epic romance. How many guys have stopped reading already? It's in French and it's a romance! If you're the type of person who can't stand typical romances, don't worry. This film is much more than mere fluff. It has a deep story, with so many interesting characters that you might lose track of what is going on the first time you see it. Just watch what Jeunet does with the character of the postman. Jeunet is perhaps an acquired taste, but I strongly urge you to check out his work if you haven't thus far.

Mathilde (Audrey Tautou) is 20, and she's in love with Manech (Gaspard Ulliel). She developed polio as a small child, and he was the only kid in school who was interested in talking to her. One flashback shows how they met, and how he captured her attention by offering to carry her on his back to the top of a lighthouse. Love comes in many forms, and I often wonder why two people end up together. It can be for all kinds of reasons, but it's clear as we see Mathilde and Manech come to know each other that their relationship is something very special. Unfortunately, it's interrupted when Manech is required to become a soldier. Jeunet doesn't romanticize war at all, so expect a few unpleasant scenes.

The story continues as five soldiers, including Manech, are accused of trying to get out of fighting by deliberately wounding themselves. Rumors reach Mathilde that Manech is dead, but she refuses to believe it. Mathilde suffers a little bit from OCD, and a few scenes are all the more moving because of it.

That's just the set up, and already it's becoming a complicated story. The remainder of the film shows Mathilde's attempts to discover the truth about Manech. Is he still alive? She enlists the help of a private detective to find out what happened.

It's a superb performance from Tautou, and she's ably supported by some of Jeunet's regular actors, including Dominique Pinon, Ticky Holgado, and Jean-Claude Dreyfus. Marion Cotillard shows up as a glamorous assassin, who is intent on avenging the death of her lover. Jodie Foster has a small role, but her story is an important part of the whole, and it's an enjoyable sequence.

It would be wrong of me to review this film without mentioning the wonderful cinematography. Its Oscar nominations for artwork and cinematography were most appropriate. Some of the war scenes are harrowing, but the film is also punctuated by moments of great beauty. The French countryside is one of the stars, and can be breathtaking at times.

A Very Long Engagement is a visceral experience. You'll feel for Mathilde and Manech, and you'll laugh at Jeunet's sense of humor. Some of the best films transport us to a different place, and this is most definitely one of them. I won't reveal the ending, but it worked extremely well for me, and I feel a whole range of emotions every time I see it. I'll always remember the three Ms, the albatross, and my favorite scene as Mathilde tries to beat the car to the bend in the road.

See this film!

I'm a Veteran of two wars so you should take everything I say with a grain of salt when considering my review.  It's been my experience that others, like myself, who have personally experienced appalling violence are more sensitive to it.  In other words, those who have only ever experienced it through movies and television are more desensitized to it than I am.  I understand that constructs a paradox that is a little hard to accept, nevertheless, I've found this to be true based on my own experience.

As to the movie, I am a huge period flick fan so I thought I would 'give it a go'.  Big mistake.  I nearly lost my lunch in the opening five minutes.  I didn't finish the film (as I said before, I had to shut it off after less than fifteen minutes) so I can't comment on anything else.

While Engagement is decidedly graver, it nonetheless has its charm and thanks to the remarkable Audrey Tautou, the driving character in the movie captured my interest and carried me through this densely woven and mysterious plot. Tautou is a treasure as the main character Mathilde, a young girl obsessed with getting to the truth behind her young lover's disappearance while fighting in WWI. The characterizations of this girl are brilliant and it is impossible not to be taken in by her methods of determining fate. Foolishly, I thought I was the only one who did such things...
Filmed in sepia tones and loaded with gorgeous reproductions of WWI era France, director Jean-Pierre Jeunet lays out a fascinating tale of the enduring power of love and the dream smothering finality of war. He avoids overt anti-war lecturing in favor of the matter-of-fact starkness of ordinary people put in extraordinary circumstances. Films that deal with war are best when they avoid heroic clichs or preachy sentiments, opting for the commonality of human reaction. A Very Long Engagement is such a film.",1262476800,,1350,4.951541850220265

2253614,5,B0007Z0NYQ,"A bizarre mix indeed but, believe it or not, it's a pretty apt description of this very odd but quite brilliant film.

First off, you get the most realistic depiction of what war must be like since ""Saving Private Ryan"", only this time the scene is the trenches in the Somme in 1917... so meticulously recreated, believably presented and deeply shocking that it will leave you stunned and drained by the time you've got through the first section of the film.

But then things become very different as director Jean-Pierre Jeunet and lead actress Audrey Tautou take very distinct aspects of their comic classic, ""Amelie"", and rework them into a much ""darker"" mix involving a charmingly poignant love story and an extremely complex and, in the end, pretty unbelievable detective story, centred on the fate of five men sentenced to almost certain death for self-mutilation in the trenches. Tautou plays a tougher but actually similarly sweet & quirky character to Amelie, and Jeunet uses a number of the same directing techniques that made ""Amelie"" such unconventional but fascinating viewing - flash backs, unusual camera angles, fast scene cutting, bizarre events, and intriguingly odd characters - right down to a secret box that holds the key to a mystery.

And, like ""Amelie"", the dialogue is in French and its delivery is fast, meaning that if you're trying to follow it with English sub-titles you're quite likely to get lost at key points. None of which sounds too promising. But no matter, because the detective story element of the film is fairly predictable, the dnouement to the love story holds no surprises and, their not why the film fully deserves a five star rating.

Why it does is because Jeunet is such a brilliant director and, as a result, the film is stuffed full with superb cinemaphotograhy, first class acting, wonderful scene-setting and, above all, a ""pace"" that holds your attention throughout and a ""style"" that makes for, at times, quite beautiful viewing... until, that is, you're plunged back into his equally brilliant vision of what life was actually like in the mud, squalor and blood of the trenches.

Horrific, charming, wholly believable and pretty unbelievable, all at the same time, ""A Very Long Engagement"" is an extremely strange film but one that will leave you marvelling at the sheer quality of its direction, photography and acting... and, as ""Saving Private Ryan"" achieved so successfully, it's depiction of the grim realities of war make it one of the best anti-war films that you're likely to see and one that you won't forget for a very long time.",1256169600,2,2595,4.95632183908046

I finally found it at the library, in a 2-disc version, but wasn't able to watch it til the last moment. Pity! There is so much to absorb, too much for one viewing (and reading subtitles). I won't blab away the plot, like previous reviewers; it's way too complicated, and, yet, very simple. I was reminded of ""Doctor Zhivago"", with a gender switch, because Mr. Jeunet has crafted an opulent adventure/love story, full of intrigue, passion, gorgeous sets and cinematography, fine acting, and generally a satisfying film experience. (It also takes place during the same time period.) Ms. Tautou sheds some of that natural beauty, to enhance her frustrating quest; Gaspard Ulliel is wonderful, and not only because he's gorgeous, but goes through the most amazing revelation from charming to shell-shocked ambivalence, never losing the sweetness of character that made Mathilde so intent on her mission. I thought I noticed Jodie Foster, a feisty character, and when the credits rolled, I was blown away; her perfect French, combined with the passionate character, just added to my admiration of her. Indeed, the entire cast was excellent, and Mr. Jeunet's sure hand kept everything in perspective. The second disc has some great stuff regarding the development, and turning these actual locations back to 1920's authenticity. I was moved a great deal; it's a simple story, fascinating and very individual-type characters, and numerous flashbacks keep it riveting at all times. A very fine film.",1233187200,,1581,5.131782945736434
2253628,4,B0007Z0NYQ,"Featuring Audrey Tautou, who was so cute in ""Amelie,"" with the same director and several of the same actors -- and some of the whimsy and charm that made the ""Amelie"" movie so memorable -- this movie also has a dark side. Graphic scenes of the violence of World War I is not for the faint of heart. The movie is beautifully crafted, of course, well acted, memorable and moving. Not many movies are so good, I just have to own them, but Jeunet's films and anything with Audrey cause me to get out my credit card.

This movie has the suspense of a ""whodunnit,"" as five French soldiers with hand injuries (some deliberate, one accidental) are accused of ""self mutilation"" as a ploy to get out of combat. The penalty for this crime is execution. Instead of facing a firing squad, these five are dumped in ""no man's land"" between the French and German sides. All are reported dead, but ""Mathilde"" (Tautou) cannot believe ""Manech"" really died. Despite military cover-ups and misinformation, she meticulously searches the truth behind each man's death, and she never gives up hope of finding Manech alive. (No plot spoiler here.) The movie does have some silly plot devices but the do not ruin the movie for me. I'd invite friends over to watch this one with me again and again.",1227830400,3,1271,4.623893805309734

2253631,5,B0007Z0NYQ,"With the possible exception of America's Claire Danes, the French actress Audrey Tautou is probably the most interesting actress alive to simply watch onscreen. It's not that Danes and Tautou are not beautiful, they are. But they are not gorgeous screen sirens; they have an accessibility to them that makes ordinary men feel that they could some day have a girl like that fall in love with them. This is because they radiate, they simple glow with presence. Tautou, who first came to American filmgoers' attention with the smash hit comedy Amlie, is also the lead star of A Very Long Engagement, the new film by the director of that earlier film, Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Tautou not only engages with her ability to simply radiate, but because she can do more acting simply with her face than most actresses can do with their whole bodies, and in this film she shows it, playing a World War One era polio victim in search of her lover who is presumed dead.
  The film is gorgeously shot, in unrealistic tones- ranging from golden to sepia to gray, in the sense of the trench warfare....This is a great film, with scenes of battle carnage every bit the equal of the ridiculously overlauded Saving Private Ryan, but it also has believable and identifiable characters, moments of great humor and depth, and a true actress for the ages in Tautou. Whether she is scheming, playing the tuba, consoling herself, or playing a little mind game to bargain for the safe return of her lover (which she does several times in the film), Tautou dominates the screen like few actors can....
  A Very Long Engagement, adapted from a French novel by Sebastian Japrisot, is a truly terrific film, and even though it really isn't a strict war film, I would rank it right up there, just behind the best war films ever made- the aforementioned Paths Of Glory, A Thin Red Line by Terrence Malick, 1997's Regeneration, from the U.K., and Apocalypse Now by Francis Ford Coppola. Audrey Tautou is a star of the highest order, whose comparisons to that other filmic Audrey- Hepburn, are apt.",1220745600,,2060,4.745810055865922

2253633,5,B0007Z0NYQ,"This film has entered the pantheon of films that I can see over and over and yet understand more on each viewing - it is so subtle and intricate, as the mystery unravels, that there are always additional details to find and savor.  That makes this one of the best films I have ever seen on many levels.

First, you have the mystery and horror of the Great War.  I live in France, and every town has a monument full of names on it for those who died in it.  This film will make you feel what it cost, in very human terms, both in those lost and in the psychological destruction of the survivors.  While I have read about what it was like, this film is a wonderfully fresh view of it.

Second, there is a story of pure young love, which envelopes the life of a spectacularly quirky beauty.  This is perfection, so moving that I feel tears well up every time I see it.  With Mathilde and her tuba by the shore, or the hand of the sleeping Maneche on her breast, you feel what it is like for all of us the first time.  The poetry is undeniable, beyond melodrama, in acting that is uniformly brilliant.

Third, you have the mystery:  Mathilde feels Maneche is still alive, and barely wavers in her search to find him or to discover what happened, a faith that survives beyond her lamentation at his grave.  This enters her into a unique adventure, bringing her into contact with a society in change.

Fourth, you view a wider tableau of people within the society.  In this respect, the film is as good as a Balzac novel, portraying the tensions and aspirations of people embedded in their  time, which in my opinion is the best way to understand the power and beauty of history.  France is portrayed here in the early 1920s, a very beautiful country with underdeveloped culture and economy, in astonishingly vivid and accurate detail - you see the charm and poverty of the old Europe that is barely an echo today.  It is here that you get cameos by Jodie Foster, one of the best roles I have seen of this truly fine actress, and many others (all French, I think) whome I did not know.  Foster is one of the many people that Mathilde seeks out in her search, gaining crucial information yet also helping a fellow traveller in pain.

Fifth, there is a psychological depth in the choices of all the characters.  Mathilde becomes a wise and tenacious adult, marked by her pain and yet only dimly aware of her potential.  She very much reminded me of my wife.  She chooses life, while others take more destructive paths or show themselves unable to grow beyond the unimaginable circumstances they survived unwhole.  Here, you see Mathilde's doppelganger, a prostitute bent on savage revenge.  But there are so many others, each of whom adds a crucial piece to the puzzle in an unfolding story of intricate complexity.

2253635,5,B0007Z0NYQ,"This movie has become one of my very favorite movies. I have watched it four times and every time I get something new from it. Each time my heart swells with admiration at this perfect example of the film makers art. It is a joy to watch.

Where to begin to describe its virtues? The scrupulously accurate sets, circa 1917? The magnificent vistas, whether the Brittany coast or the trenches of northern France? The attention to detail: the wagons & autos on the Place de l'Opra; the one man shelters dug into the side of the trench; the broken Christ and Cross in the opening shot and the later reference to a church?

Depth of meaning? ""Bingo Crepuscule"". Before the War 'Bingo' was the nickname for the French national lottery.

'Crepuscule' is French for ""twilight"". Twilight: the 'no-man's-land' between the warring sides. War? What is war but a national lottery of life and death? The draft is even conducted by chance by pulling numbers at random......and you need five numbers to get 'bingo'....... ......""Bingo Crepuscule"".....

Which brings us to why you can watch this film several times: there is absolutely nothing wasted in this film. Every piece of information the film maker gives you is needed. Tuck it into your sleeve, you'll need it later. Example? The tuba: sometimes Matilda plays a distress call, sometimes music...... but.... do you note when she plays what? It's not at random.

The acting? Ah, the acting, such an evenness of excellence, it is like fine smooth wine. You're not even aware how good it is, it goes down so easily - every actor, every part; great and small.

Even the small little dramas are deftly done, like mini operas: the whore killing the fat man or the man in the tunnel. Ah, and how well all the little dramas are so skillfully woven into the fabric of the larger drama!

Even the sound track gives important information: it wasn't until the third time I watched it that I realized the metallic 'thunk' was a dud bomb.... which drove a character into a basement beneath a church....(remember the wheat field)......

There are so many little jewels in this film. It is a true pleasure to watch.....again and again.......each time you come back a little richer.",1208649600,12,2206,4.771653543307087
2253636,4,B0007Z0NYQ,"As Tina Lombardi in A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT, Marion Cotillard won the French Academy Award, the Cesar, for Best Supporting Actress.  She was on the screen for nine minutes, and in her mid-20s. What's interesting to new fans of the 2008 Best Actress Oscar winner is the beginning, in Cotillard's career, of her movement away from the light comedy roles she had played early on (most commonly known to US movie audiences in A BIG FISH, A GOOD YEAR, and the French TAXI 1,2 and 3) into darker, more intense roles.  A treasure on the path is FURIA, in which Cotillard plays a resistance fighter (a longer review can be read there).  Though Lombardi is mostly talked about in A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT, when she does appear as The Officer Killer, she transfixes the audience.  Her scene with Audrey Tautou in prison was a revelation; Tina Lombardi is tough and hard, but once given a message from her dead lover, she weeps one pure tear.  It's an added pleasure of A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT to see Cotillard several years ago doing small roles so well, and a pleasure as well to see Jodie Foster, whose fluent French (acquired at a French-language academy in Los Angeles when she was a child) helped disguise her as a French farmer's wife.",1207699200,,1227,4.610091743119266
2253647,4,B0007Z0NYQ,"The previews of this movie presented images that promised an enduring love story set against the backdrop of WWI.

That it is driven by a seemingly nave love story seems almost incidental to what the director seems intent to present here, an epic inspired not only by Stanley Kubrick's 1957 antiwar classic about a WWI suicide mission,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paths-of-Glory/dp/0792841409/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paths of Glory</a>, but also Edward Zwick's 1996&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Courage-Under-Fire/dp/B00005221J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Courage Under Fire</a>&nbsp;and to some degree, Akira Kurosawa's 1950 classic,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rashomon/dp/B00003CXC6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rashomon</a>.

The film is successful in evoking memories of these other films and at the same time, bears the unmistakable stamp of Jeunet's now-recognizable visual invention. Whereas his filmmaking style befits the optimism and quirkiness of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amelie/dp/B0000640VO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amelie</a>, it surprisingly feeds very well into this much darker tale. The most memorable example is an extended scene, which takes place in a field hospital crowded with wounded soldiers and housing a huge, hydrogen-filled zeppelin. An undetonated shell is lodged in the ceiling as the zeppelin unexpectedly lets loose from its tether. The contact of these objects is inevitable, but Jeunet films it in such a stylized chain of events that I was impressed with his flair as much as I was dreading the outcome. Jeunet invests a lot of effort capturing the bleakness and sheer brutality of war, including a plethora of mutilations that made me wince, but again his visual sense does not allow it to reach the gut level of the opening scenes of Steven Spielberg's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saving-Private-Ryan/dp/B00001ZWUS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saving Private Ryan</a>. Rather, they become part of this intimate world he is building to facilitate his storytelling, which in itself is stylized by its very unfolding. The technique can be frustrating at first since so many bits of information are thrown at the viewer without much context until it all weaves together into a singular strand that moves toward the ending.

Audrey Tautou, Dietrich to Jeunet's von Sternberg, downplays the charm she displayed in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amelie/dp/B0000640VO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amelie</a>&nbsp;for a more sullen performance as Mathilde, a woman handicapped by childhood polio but relentless in her search for Manech, her fianc and lifelong love. I wish there were more scenes of their blooming relationship, as I think that is the one imbalance in the film that could have drawn me closer to her character. So much is assumed of our empathy for her plight, but frankly she comes across as a bit too monomaniacal at times. With the intensity of the romance missing, Manech, as played with appropriate vacuity by Gaspard Ulliel, comes across as something of a cipher despite what is obviously his undying love for her. The four other men who were court-martialed with Manech on the front lines for self-mutilation are all revealed in their own stories. A serial-killing prostitute brings an unusually exotic, Mata Hari aspect to more than one of the stories, but that is not the only plot twist. Prominent in one of the other stories is Jodie Foster, speaking what sounds like impeccable French, as a put-upon housewife who in an effort to save her husband, gets mired in an unfortunate love triangle. Foster gives a fine, small performance, but her recognizable appearance and Yankee appeal cut into the realism of the story at an important juncture.

Fortunately, the film is a feast for the eyes throughout. Thanks to Bruno Debonnel's expert cinematography, the film contains desaturated hues that produce an almost brown-and-white look that recalls an old, graying photograph. I think the film could have been trimmed from its 2 -hour running time, but it doesn't feel much time has been wasted in getting to the hopeful conclusion. It's definitely worth seeing for Jeunet's individualistic filmmaking panache. The two-disc 2005 DVD set contains the movie on the first disc and an extremely informative commentary track from Jeunet (in French with English subtitles) that covers everything about the production. The highlight of the second disc is the comprehensive 73-minute documentary, ""A Year at the Front"". More than a standard making-of feature, it covers everything from storyboarding to location shooting. Two other shorts are included - ""Parisian Scenes"" covers what it took to re-create 1920's Paris, and ""Before the Explosion"" concentrates on the mechanics behind the zeppelin sequence. Finally, there are also fourteen deleted/extended scenes with optional commentary from Jeunet.",1206662400,,5549,6.298684210526316
2253648,4,B0007Z0NYQ,"""Amelie"", Jean Pierre Jeunet's rightly praised follow-up to the abysmal fourth entry in the ""Alien"" series, was one of my favorite foreign releases in recent years and there was such a charm and lightheartedness about it that it cheered me up whenever I'd see it. Reuniting with star Audrey Tautou, you'd think ""A Very Long Engagement"" with its more adult story and complex narrative would make it just as good or even better but unfortunately there's occasions where there's some missteps that could've been changed.

During World War I, Matilde is seeing off her childhood friend and love Manech as he goes straight to the trenches. But him along with 5 others self-mutilate in hopes they'd be taken out due to injury but instead they're sentenced to walk within ""no man's land"", the middle of the trenches between French and German forces. Declared dead, Matilde doesn't believe and starts her own investigation into what exactly happened.

A lot of foreign films tend to be predominantly story driven, often having big vista shots and dialogue as opposed to action scenes and the like. This film does have some wartime scenes but they're used sparingly and doesn't delve into Private Ryan-esque battles every 15 minutes. The thing is, since the story gets the bigger emphasis, is that it's just not a very well-paced film. A film should make you feel like you're so caught up in it that the time seems to fly by but I was constantly away of its length and the strange pacing. Plus there's some subplots, one involves Jodie Foster (who surprisingly has a great handle on the language) that could've been taken out while one involving Marion Cotillard in a situation similar to Mathilde doesn't seem as prominent as it should be. And there's some ""Amelie""-style humor like dog flatulence (I wish I was kidding) that doesn't work, period.

But then again, Jeunet's films have always been a great sight to watch and while I prefer the color scheme of Amelie, this film is also visually sumptuous with a sepia-toned color grading and more gray, dull looks for the war scenes. But on occasion, it seems like he went overboard and many scenes in the countryside look too....yellow and kind of distracting. The actors though are just as welcome to watch from Tautou to frequent Jeunet regular Dominique Pinon. It's a shame that a storyline involving Foster who's admittedly good got a mention whereas the one with Cotillard wasn't as fleshed out since I got quite interesting in her side and the dichotomy of what Mathilde does and the other character would've made a good story idea.

I'd recommend you watch the film since it's a well-made and watchable story but whether Amelie spoiled me or its the film itself, this one slightly missed its mark.",1205625600,,2746,4.848614072494669

But enough about who made the movie.

A Very Long Engagement follows Mathilde (Tautou), an orphan partially paralyzed from polio, as she undertakes a desperate journey to find her fianc, a French soldier in World War I named Manech (Ulliel).  Their love for one another is portrayed as remarkably profound and that really is what this movie is built on.  Jeunet has a unique way of introducing characters to us.  He makes it almost impossible to not relate in some way to them.  The characters in his films are far more charming than most, especially here.  Manech was one of five soldiers convicted of self-mutilation.  He did this so he would no longer have to serve.  All five soldiers faced a death sentence by being forced to enter No Man's Land between the French and German trenches.  All are assumed to have not survived but Mathilde's faith in Manech's survival cannot be shaken.  A Very Long Engagement is seen through the perspective of both primary characters, but mostly focuses on Mathilde.  I won't give away the end but suffice to say it is among the most beautiful bittersweet movie moments in many years.

In such a passionate story that never loses my attention I sometimes forget how amazing this film is visually.  You can plainly see that Jeunet is delighted to tell his story with a big budget, and believe me he uses it wisely.  The war scenes do not for one second turn away. Even with all I've heard, read about, or seen visual interpretations of; nothing could prepare me for Jeunet's seemingly spot-on depiction of World War I trench warfare brutality.  What's amazing is he contrasts these fragmented horrific visuals with mostly gorgeous countryside shots of north western France and gazing shots of the beautiful and delicate Mathilde.  Seems so appropriate, as the world I see today might need these contrasts as a reminder of how very beautiful life has the potential to be.  A Very Long Engagement to me is the total package.  It really is what movies should be about and I very highly recommend it to anyone.",1204848000,13,4685,6.4631410256410255

2253651,5,B0007Z0NYQ,"""A Very Long Engagement"" is incredible. It is admittedly quite a sweeping story that takes a lot of involvement to follow, but it is also a masterpiece that smacks of ""Amelie"".  (I will throw in that I have never read the book...)

I watched this in French class, and it does help with comprehension to speak French at least relatively well.  There are some nuances that are, per se, lost in translation (""MMM"" - in English, it became ""Manech's marrying Mathilde"", but in French, it's ""Manech aime Mathilde"" - ""aime"" means ""loves"" and is pronounced like the letter ""m"") and the whole thing sounds much softer and more beautiful in French, which is a very beautiful language, despite the hacking sounds produced whils saying some words.  The actors do speak fast, and yes, the Parisian accents are strong, but if you watch the subtitles, most everything will make sense; the subtitles, contrary to many reviews, are concise and accurate, if a little quick.

I will admit this film is very, very graphic, both in relation to the bloody battle scenes and the typically French risque scenes.  I couldn't watch when Tina Lombardi met her fate, for example, and for half the movie I felt like throwing up.  But it is an emotionally charged story and is simultaneously an excellent depiction of the horrors of WWI and a sweet love story.  The repeated lines delivered by Manech, for example, are an excellent touch, as is the last line (watch and see - I'm not giving it away).  The plot is complicated, true, and convoluted, and when I was finished I had to read a plot summary to make sure I understood everything, but it's worth it; the romance, tragedy, and mystery combine exquisitely.  There are some strange bits of French humor and it does play a little bit like ""Amelie, Having Just Read Da Vinci Code, Travels Backwards in Time to WWI"", but it is very rewarding.

The actors are also wonderful.  Audrey Tautou, one of my all-time favorite actresses, pulls off another fabulous performance, and Gaspard Ulliel, her love interest in the film, is adorable and a very convincing terrified soldier.  Jodie Foster didn't strike me as all that amazing, but the woman who plays Tina Lombardi, the Corsican whore, did an amazing job, especially when she received the note from Angel.

This is definitely a movie for an older viewer with enough time on his or her hands to really get swept up in an invovled, complicated story, but overall, it is very much worth the time it takes to really understand it.

2253656,5,B0007Z0NYQ,"I don't exactly know how to describe it, but ""A Very Long Engagement""  is a magnificent visual essay on love, beauty, tragedy, hopelessness, and hope.  Watching this movie is a powerful experience that touches all of the senses.  Its worth watching several times so that you can take in all of the stunning visual beauty, the subtleties in the dialogue, the performances, and the gorgeous settings.

Its a the wonderful example of art and expression that touches the heart, representing so much of what is beautiful about french films.  Most of the films produced in the country of my birth (USA) are big budget, insensitive, and superficial displays of brute force and celebrity.  I'll admit, it took a second viewing for this ugly american to make sense of some of the scenes, limited by the english subtitles and my eight grade french.

There are so many things to say, and most of it has been said by others much better than I can.  Here are my highlights:

1.) Love and loyalty.  The young woman so touched by the love of the young man (had she thought her polio made her unlovable?), that she refuses, over a period of several years, to give up on a relationship based only on a few wonderful days.

2.)  Audrey Tautou:  Most beautiful women are usually described as visually stunning.  Tautou must be one of the most beautifully feminine females in cinema, not because of how she looks, but what she is.  Voice, movement, attitude, expressions, strength, vulnerability, emotions, etc., she is beautiful to watch - even if she didn't have those incredible eyes.

3.) The ending in the garden - saying so much, and saying so little.  So graceful, so wonderful, so disappointing.  What has happened to these two young people?  What will happen to them?

4.)  The seemly random hand of fate, chance, and cruelty. The unspeakable horror of WWI.  The most beautiful and the most ugly of human behavior, side by side, each making the other look more extreme.

Yeah, its long.  You have to pay attention, and at some points it's difficult to tell some of the young male actors apart from each other.  In the end, however, I was thankful to be able to absorb at least some of what this film has to offer.  With the exception perhaps of only the odd title (""A Very Long Engagement""), it was entirely magnificent.  ""Enchantee!""",1186531200,5,2323,4.699751861042183

2253668,5,B0007Z0NYQ,"It's no secret to those who know me that I'm a fan of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's directorial work. But to be honest I did not think he could outdo himself after Le Fabuleux destin d'Amlie Poulain.

I was wrong.

This is a story with love, loss, drama, misery, and joy so profound it cannot be expressed in mere words. It's a war move, chick-flick, murder mystery, and comedy all rolled into one. And though this sounds like a real mash-up it works... beautifully.

This is a story with many arcs, multiple perspectives, and varied interesting characters. Even the production notes are surprising. The ""wooden hand"" for instance (you'll know when you see it) is a real functioning work; not CGI.

Bruno Delbonnel's, who also filmed Amelie, cinematography continues to amaze. He stands head and shoulders above virtually all others. Delbonnel continues to produce the longest most difficult continuous shots I've ever seen; some of which you'd swear are impossible.

What many may not know about this film is that Jeunet accepted funds from both the National French film bureau (Commission Nationale du FILM FRANCE) and Warner Brothers. This angered some French who claimed the acceptance of foreign funds invalided it as a true French film.

I disagree. Despite the heavy financing from Warner Brothers this is Jeunet's vision and it's 100% French.

The appearance of Jodie Foster was a major surprise. In fact, not only did she speak her own lines, Jeunet claims her French was flawless. It was a nice meaty part for a cameo too.

Amazingly Jeunet seems to be able to surpass his best with each new work.

Jeunet has managed to make a film that stands up to repeated viewings. There always seems to be something new to see.",1181174400,6,1717,4.852739726027397
2253669,5,B0007Z0NYQ,"""A Very Long Engagement"" is a powerful epic of love and hope set against the backdrop of brutal all-out war and its bitter aftermath.  Audrey Tatou (of ""Amelie"" fame) plays Mathilde, a physically handicapped young woman in France during the World War I era.  When the war is over and her lover fails to return home, and is reported dead, Ame... er, Mathilde (I'll always think of Audrey as Amelie) refuses to believe it and sets out on a determined quest to learn of the whereabouts of the man she believes in her heart Must still be alive.  In the quest, she uncovers the stories of a number of other soldiers during the war, and comes in contact with another 'searcher', who's tracking down the whereabouts of high-ranking military officers, for a very different reason.  With plentiful flashbacks to the bloody trench warfare, and flashbacks further back showing the evolution of the relationship between Mathilde and her beau Manech, beginning with their initial meeting as children.  Full of love, tragedy, compassion, brutality, and humor, and enhanced by a great cast and vivid cinematography, ""A Very Long Engagement"" is a masterpiece synthesis of the war movie and the romance movie.",1180310400,3,1192,4.969849246231155

The love story with Tautou, less so - although the gentleman who played Manech gave an incredible performance. Tautou's performance was too coy. The unraveling of the mystery was ridiculous on-film. Her cottage was gorgeous to look at, as was most of the countryside. I read the book, and the mystery also didn't read well and was hard to follow. The film's ending was quite artistic, but also quite disappointing in the way it was wrought.",1171929600,2,594,5.071428571428571
2253673,5,B0007Z0NYQ,"A Very Long Engagement (Un long dimanche de fianailles/2004) is Jean-Pierre Jeunet's screen adaptation of Sebastien Japrisot's novel by the same name.  The adaptation of Japrisot's novel, with its convoluted development, was far from easy, in particular due to the voluminous correspondence between Mathilde and her informants: in a film, one needs action, not lectures.  Jeunet and Laurant solved the problem by substituting actual meetings for many of the novel's letters, introducing new characters, such as the mailman (an homage, en passant, to Jacques Tati's Jour de Fte/1949), and by using telephone communications, which in context is definitely an anachronism.

On the other hand, Jeunet, who is known as a very finicky, even obsessive director, did not hesitate to recreate some aspects of the story down to the most minute details, using some of the most sophisticated digital magic -- through it, we glimpse some of the Paris of the early 20th Century, which no longer exists: the Place de l'Opra, the Trocadro Palace, built for the Universal Exposition of 1878, the Orsay train station, before it became a museum, or Les Halles central market, ""Paris' belly,"" which disappeared in the 1960s, and which those who knew it rediscovered with great pleasure.

The film's mise-en-scne is brilliant.  Jeunet's biggest challenge came with the reconstruction of the Somme battlefield.  To Jeunet, this was a very serious business: no fantasies allowed here, as this tragic historical moment could not be played with and betrayed.  The group scenes, such as the charge under fire of the soldiers, are filmed with the kinetic art of an Eisenstein.  The poignant scene of the landing on Omaha Beach in Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan (1998) also comes to mind.  As all of the war scenes were to be filmed in exteriors, the technical constraints were serious.  On a French military post, an area of 62 acres were transformed into a film studio, and several hundred yards of narrow trenches were dug out, filled with water and mud, and numerous shell holes, which had to withstand about the six weeks of exterior filming in the rain.  Trees were uprooted and miles of barbed wire were laid out.  Several miles of blue ""horizon"" material were used to fashion the military costumes, which, of course, were exact copies of those found in various French museums.  Jeunet compiled a small back-story of the life in the trenches, letters of the soldiers who were at the front to their families, pictures, etc.  Jeunet even required that each extra read Les carnets de guerre de Louis Barthas, tonnelier, 1914-1918, a famous diary of the author's World War I experiences.  On the other hand, Mathilde's affection is portrayed with the innocence of an Amlie Poulin, with the freshness of pure love.

Of course, everybody would have recognized Audrey Tantou, the ""star"" of The Fabulous Destiny of Amlie Poulin, a fact that may have been detrimental to her after all.  Her ""fabulous"" acting in this past film has certainly prejudiced many viewers who have the distinct impression of a dj vu.  However, if she, as an actress, still has a precise technique and the contagious humor of Amlie Poulin in the present film, she merely adds to it feelings.  Although she may be more capricious than passionate, she retains her freshness and the sincerity which makes her performance deeply moving.  Strangely enough, Mathilde is not so much the principal character of the film as she is a catalyst around which a multitude of other characters orbit. Gaspard Ulliel (Manech) is mostly a presence in the film through other people evocations, including Mathilde's.  At the end of the film, we still don't know much about him except what others have told us, although he is pivotal to the story, and Ulliel fulfills this role marvelously.

The other actors, and they are numerous, are Jeunet's usual gang of ""fetish"" actors, each one with his own remarkable and unique mug, who have followed him since Delicatessen, such as Jean-Claude Dreyfus, Dominique Pinon, Ticky Holgado (deceased, 2004), Rufus, etc, who are all familiar to Jeunet's fans.  Additionally, we have a group of well-established artists like Andr Dussollier, Clovis Cornillac, Marion Cotillard, and Jodie Foster.  These actors are just a few among the many that Jeunet cast, each in the most suitable role possible.  There are no misunderstandings here; everybody is ""in tune.""

Jeunet turned again to Angelo Badalamenti (The City of Lost Children) for the music.  Badalamenti is David Lynch's regular music composer (Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive, Twin Peaks).  His music, full of sweeping nostalgia, is the keystone of the present film.  With its first appearance at the story's beginning, as it accompanies the heart-wrenching trench scenes, it firmly fixes in our subconscious the horrors of the war, which then permeate the rest of the film to its conclusion.

In the dialog we find many one-liner jokes, popular sayings, and plays on words that cannot readily be translated into English, and which, in the process of subtitling, have unfortunately lost most of their poetry and wittiness.  I guess for those of you who are persnickety, you will have to do what Jodie Foster did...  Such types of lines and rejoinders are found throughout the film, conferring a bitter-sweet atmosphere to the film, as Jeunet tried to prevent his film from turning into a simpering tear-jerker.  The witticisms are the film's ""safety valve,"" preventing us from being overwhelmed by the depiction of war's ignominy.

Jeunet's films have always been known for the brilliant coloring of his film and his use of sepia and yellow filters to alter the images.  This film is no exception, as all the scenes are colored. The war scenes are in crepuscular grey-bluish tones, blue ""horizon"" like the color of the soldiers' uniforms, well-suited for the events they depict.  However, as a contrast, Jeunet colors all the other scenes in sepia/yellow, which after a while becomes disturbing.  Why color the naturally beautiful landscapes of Brittany?  On the other hand, this artificial coloring is favorable for creating a kind of fairytale atmosphere, which is certainly appropriate to the story.

With A Very Long Engagement, Jeunet denounces wars, and the politicians and militaries who instigate them for their own benefits.  In a brilliant mise-en-scne, Jeunet shows us the miseries, both physical and psychological, inflicted by wars on human beings.  We are in the trenches of WWI, on the Somme front, with the French ""poilus,"" (""the hairy ones""), as the grunts were then known.  They are waiting for yet another meaningless assault on some meaningless enemy position, most likely just to please someone in the upper command who, safe from harm, decided on a whim or a hunch to order such assault, which he hopes will reflect positively on him and bring him glory, a medal, and maybe a promotion.

Poilus were renowned for their courage, doggedness, and endurance. However, they were not passive followers of orders. At the disastrous Chemin des Dames offensive of 1917, under General Robert Nivelle (another hero-genius), they were said to have gone into no-man's land baaing in black self-parody, acting like the lambs to the slaughter their commanders apparently took them for. Outstanding for its mixture of horror and heroism, this spectacle proved a sobering one. As the news of it spread, the French high command soon found itself coping with a widespread mutiny. A minor revolution was only averted with the promise of an end to such costly offensives.

World War I, referred to in some history books as the ""Great War,"" was a masterpiece in perfecting the horrors that only men are capable of inventing.  But ""great,"" in what sense?  Certainly not in the sense of ""illustrious,"" or ""noble,"" or even ""heroic,"" although in their state of misery and desperation, the soldiers on both sides of the trenches were heroic.  This war was indeed the ""mother of all wars,"" whose battles produced some of the largest mass graves ever.  One of its main battles was the battle of Verdun, also known as the ""mincing machine of Verdun.""  Just imagine a battle which lasted eleven months - 21 February until 21 December, 1916, resulting in more than ONE million casualties, half of them killed outright.  The ""artists"" of such a slaughter were General Eric von Falkenhayn and Prince Wilhelm (later known as ""the butcher of Verdun"") on the German side, and General Joseph Joffre and General Philippe Petain on the French side: All of these legal assassins got praises for their ""heroism,"" medals, and promotions, entirely won on the backs of the million poor souls who had never asked to be there in the first place.  Military historians all agree that the butchery of Verdun hardly resulted of any tactical advantage for either side.

The action of the present film takes place at another ill-conceived battle, the battle of the Somme, a counter offensive made to relieve the pressure on Verdun.  It started on July 1, 1916.  In this single day, the British infantry suffered 57,470 casualties!  When it all ended six months later, after 420,000 British, 200,000 French, and about 600,000 German casualties, the Allied forces were still 3 miles short of their first day's objective...  Of course, ""humanity"" has made progress since that time: the battle for Stalingrad during WWII lasted about six months, resulting in some two millions casualties.  However, the ""rules"" had changed, as part of this hecatomb also includes civilians, euphemistically referred to as ""collateral damages,"" who have now become fair game.

Thanks to this legal assassin elite, together with its politician counterpart, a whole generation of young men was sent to the slaughterhouse, wiped out in a few years.  What is this called, a ""generationcide?""  There were no round-ups, just a mobilization.  Nobody wore a yellow star, just a uniform.  And there were no death-camps, just battlefields, or better yet, ""fields of glory.""  Jeunet, however, is careful not to paint all the military commanders with the same brush, contrasting the vile and disgusting Commandant Lavrouye (Jean-Claude Dreyfus), with the honest and compassionate Captain Favourier (Tchky Karyo).

Jeunet, having taken by his own admission Stanley Kubrick's remarkable Path of Glory (1957) as a model, films the war and its trail of misery, shows great care to stay within the bounds of credibility, devoid of any epic elements which would magnify and glorify war, and would distance us from the small men overcome by History's mayhem.  Jeunet shows us the death sentences handed down for the slightest pretext, to the whim of the superior commanders and their sense of moral superiority and righteousness, while themselves hiding from combat and living in luxury.  He confronts us with the despair of men who are at the end of their wits, who cannot bear any longer the carnage that never ends, notwithstanding the fact it gives some individuals the opportunity to rise in their positions thanks to their hate of other people's lives, their taste for torture and sadism, their mental imbalance and psychology, all of which derive from the worst schizophrenia used by politicians and military brass to achieve their unspeakable aims.  I will abstain from drawing any parallels with the present situation in the Middle East.

Jeunet brings to life the wizened, taciturn men one sees every evening at 6:00 pm, with their breasts overflowing with military medals, walking up the Avenue of the Champs Elysees in Paris, toward the Arc of Triumph.  Those men go to symbolically revive the Eternal Flame on the tomb of the WWI Unknown Soldier (is he French or German?), the same unknown soldier who became Major Delaplane's (Philippe Noiret) last concern, in Tavernier's brilliant Life and Nothing But (1989).  Many of them were the poilus in that war, or some other wars later on.  Thanks to Jeunet, they are no longer folkloric shadows walking up the great avenue, and we are a little bit more knowledgeable regarding their past.

Nevertheless, Jeunet's film ends on a note of genuine optimism.  A Very Long Engagement's theme is also the conflict between bestiality and love: war tears lovers asunder, and love has to conquer all.  Mathilde is relentless pursuing the truth regarding the fate of Manech, knowing in her heart that, against all semblance of reality, and just because she loves him so truly, he must be alive, no matter how overwhelming or horrible the war was.  Jeunet tells us that Love can win, and his film is full of optimism, as he concludes with the lovers' reunion and the human spirit's victory over bestiality.",1169164800,10,12698,5.072150072150072

With the exception of her last flick with Mr. Hanks, she seems to have been a bit type cast into the daisy-like waif who simpers and could either turn the world in on herself or blow it wide open--you never know. The story was a bit hard to follow, which probably wasn't helped by the language barrier and translation. As usual, I noticed several places where the subtitle did not match what was said at all, which shaded things a bit differently. It was a pretty film though, with interesting cinematography. The war scenes were different than you tend to see in American films. They were gross in this, but the drama was around the reaction of the characters experiencing whatever gross thing more than the gross things itself.

2253676,5,B0007Z0NYQ,"Many reviewers complained that the film was too long, for me it was too short. That's how much I liked this film. I am still waiting for that ONE World War One film to be done someday, but this is good enough for now. I have always wondered why no one in Hollywood, or anywhere for that matter have never done a GOOD, film on this horrific slaughterhouse of a war. The 'War to End All Wars' did not of course end all war's; but it ushered in the most tragic consequences mankind has ever known: A consequnce of events that we are still suffering from. Maybe someday [are you listening studios?} someone will make a film about Verdun, the Somme, or any other tragic battle that occured in this horrible war. However, this film does a very great job in two ways. [More actually]. But two in particular.

On one side, we the viewers witness the slaughter of young men [and eventually older men, as the young were senselessly killed] filled into the meat grinder of the western front. What would any man who has seen this type of carnage do? A war in which these men filled their void by scurrying and huddling amongst each other in the water-filled, waist deep mud and rat infested trenches they called home? Only to leave it when they were to go over the top and face almost certain death, or maiming.

Were their actions irrational or cowardice? I don't believe it was cowardice. This was not to be the glory of what they believed and learned about from their schoolmasters and politicains when they were growing up. The dangers of nationalism: which was constantly drilled into their heads since their youth betrayed them. Finally, they claimed their senses. Was it irrational for them to shoot themselves in order to live and go home? Or was it better to meet their fate by going over the top and knowing that they would be killed? I will not judge those who did this [And many did]

But the film is about more than just this tragic war. But the aftermath of the war itself. And what impact it had on those the dead and missing left behind. Enter Mathilde (Audrey Tautou) who refuses to believe that her fiance has met his death on the front. And this is Mathilde's story as she searches and investigates the circumstances of her loved ones death. Or was their a cover-up, and he is really alive? In Mathilde's impassioned love for her sweetheart, she will allow no one to deter her from her search. Is he still alive? Did he really die, or did some lucky happenstance intervene to save him?

This is a very poignant story, and there are no happy endings for many. However, no one is ever the same after such a tragedy of events. But maybe, just maybe there is hope for Mathilde. The film does a wonderful job in not only exploring Mathilde's love for her fiance, but also takes a detour into another woman's life, whose lover's death has caused her to deal a harsh blow to those involved. The cinematography in the film is outstanding. And the scenes of battle are excellently choreographed. I highly recommend this film. I belongs in your collection.

2253693,5,B0007Z0NYQ,"If this film had been made in English, by an English or American director and cast, it would have won a truckload of Oscars -- it's a pity that more audiences hadn't seen this masterpiece. Some points worth raising, even after all the other reviews so far:

In a way, it's not a WWI film. The central story, in 1920, is Mathilde's search across peacetime France into the disappearance of her fiance Manech, who was condemned by court-martial and abandoned in no-man's land, with four others, in January 1917. Indeed, few war-themed films have a woman who is this much of a driving force (Manech is almost passive in his suffering, by comparison) as she launches an investigation, despite a limp, the result of childhood polio. Mathilde's search is complicated by another young woman, who also had a lover lost among the five, also hunting those responsible -- only this young woman wants revenge, not information.

The flashbacks to 1917 spare us nothing of the mud and suffering of the Western Front; the cinematography is brilliant. But so are another series of flashbacks, ca. 1910, to Mathilde's and Manech's first friendship as children, beautifully staged on the Breton coast and in a lighthouse. The scenes in 1920s Paris, rural France, and Corsica are vivid, crowded, and in landscape scenes, beautiful. And the 1920 sequences of searching and investigating become increasingly dark and deadly, scary in their own right.

Jodie Foster (yes, that Jodie Foster) appears in a brief but pivotal role as a war widow. Fluent French, splendid and sensuous performance, and the ""was that who I thought it was?"" moment didn't occur till she was gone.

And the musical scoring! I thought a film this suffused with the film score would have suffered from it at some point. Angelo Badalamenti's scoring never was less than perfect, always carrying the film and making it that much more emotionally powerful. The period costumes seem perfect and some of the country settings, esp. the seaside Breton cottage where Mathilde lives, are gorgeous.

The extras make for a fully worthwhile DVD set. The ""Making of"" film was unexpectedly terrifying. The camera that swoops over the lighthouse, the many train sequences, the trenches was borne on a helicopter, quite visible in ""Making of"" -- it was scary how close the chopper flew to its subjects. That pilot was good. ""Making of"" also shows the care that went into the special effects -- notably the crowd scenes, and one man's mechanical hand.

And there's the ""Making of"" incident where director Jean-Pierre Jeunet films a trench sequence: in the film, French soldiers hiding from an artillery barrage are buried alive in their trench. ""Making of"" shows the filming, the special effect, and then the real-life tension as they dig the four actors out after the explosion. The crew doesn't seem sure that they'll be quick enough.

This film is not to be missed; the DVD is very worth having. Others have compared it to Saving Private Ryan. I would compare it to Dr. Zhivago -- only on a much higher level.",1154822400,4,3045,4.900970873786408
2253694,4,B0007Z0NYQ,"Audrey Tautou is a wonderful actress.  I've seen her in four or five movies now, and she is always very good.  Of course my first was Amelie, still one of my favorite movies of all time.

In this movie she is the fiancee of a Frenchman who is drafted for World War One.  The title ""very long engagement"" refers to the years in between their engagement and the climax of the movie when our questions are finally resolved.  He went off to war, he was sentenced to death, he was injured or killed in the war, but is he still alive?  How could he still be alive, considering that the war has been over for years now and he still hasn't contacted anyone?",1154822400,2,649,4.235772357723577
2253695,5,B0007Z0NYQ,"An English version would most likely be of inferior quality over the original.  We know the debacle of ""Just Visiting"", a movie which lost all the attraction and humor of the original ""Les Visiteurs"". American audiences need to give subtitled movies more credit, they get the opportunity to come as close to the intended original as they possibly can. Understanding French, I was deeply moved by the narrative which reads like poetry from beginning to end.  Having an English version of this movie would probably negate all that in favor of action over script, think ""Mission Impossible"".

This movie isn't about loud bangs. The story of Matilde is a voyage inside her head as she goes through a rollercoaster of hope and disappointment. We can't help but feel for her, and that's why I give this movie a 5 star among other (visual) reasons. It achieves what it intended to do.",1144454400,7,877,4.7947019867549665
2253696,4,B0007Z0NYQ,"I was not a big fan of Amelie. Maybe because it was too whimsical. It was so light, it practically floated away. Maybe there weren't enough machine guns. A Very Long Engagement corrects that. Seriously, though, this movie has everything. In many ways, it's a great date movie. It has a love story as well as war scenes. The love scenes are good, but the war scenes are spectacular. We see soldiers literally drown in the mud, as they in fact did in the slaughter pens of Verdun and the Somme. In addition to providing some of the best war footage ever put on celluloid, Engagement tells an interesting story of a woman in search of her fiancee, who supposedly died at a little piece of hell called Bingo Crepuscule. Tatou, playing a cripple (a fact which doesn't take away from her usual radiant charm), searches for her missing lover. Jodie Foster gives a surprisingly erotic turn as a Polish woman living in France. It might be Foster's sexiest performance. My biggest problem with the movie was the ending. Without giving away too much, let me say that the reason for a major character's absence is explained using a plot technique too similar to the old ""it was all a dream"" soap opera cliche. The dialogue moves quickly for those who don't understand French and have to rush to read the subtitles, and while reading, you miss some great scenery. Last of all, it's tough at times to keep track of all the characters. Nevertheless, Engagement is well worth watching--lush, romantic, and thoughtful.",1143417600,6,1501,4.7110266159695815
2253697,2,B0007Z0NYQ,"People who think elevator music is Mozart will probably like this movie because it has subtitles and is slow.  A story which should have been great... but feels, instead, interminably long. Tarkovsky and Leone can get away with lethargic pacing because they are true cinematic artists. Jeunet, unfortunately, isn't, and this movie comes off as a lethargic `Amelie Goes to War'.

Gorgeous cinematography... but the Italian hooker angel-of-death was a much more interesting character than the one Ms. Tatou, unfortunately, portrayed.  They made a movie about the wrong person!

2253698,4,B0007Z0NYQ,"A Very Long Engagement does a surprisingly deft job of balancing the absurdities and horrors of war with the absurdities of everyday life and the tenuous nature of hope and history, both ever changing and prey to the unbalancing influence of the smallest detail. More than most, this is really a film about the enduring pains of war that linger long after the last shots are fired and the battlefields are grown over as Mathilde's journey for her lost love goes from hospitals to widows to cripples to the thousands of official forms that once meant life or death. It's here that the film's lavish budget is really felt, allowing the story to span a wounded country eager to forget but unable to, as well as recreating the front lines. The reconstruction of the trench scenes is similarly impressive, although, as in Jasprisot's novel, the attitude of the poilous is much more sympathetic than it would have been in reality (deserters and self-inflicted wound cases were widely hated by soldiers at the front, who generally felt they should take their chances alongside them).

Its use of narration pays dividends, establishing that each of the five condemned man has a life and people that care about them. It's still done with Jeunet's characteristic quirkiness and black visual humor, but that's all too the good. And while there are some similarities, Tatou is not exactly Amelie here, all-too-ready to dismiss a helpful source as a slut in her own small-minded determination. The little games she plays with fate might seem whimsical, but she loses as many as she wins. Even the ending that proved so unacceptable for US audiences by opting for neither an obviously happy/unhappy ever after ending is just right, leaving its characters in limbo but not without hope.

A final touch of absurdity is added by Jeunot's audio commentary, where he complains over the end credits that despite spending more money by filming in France with French cast and crew entirely in the French language, the film was met with astonishing hostility by the French film industry which immediately declared it a foreign film and moved that it be forced to repay it's small government subsidy and be ruled ineligible for all French awards. I guess now he knows how George Stevens felt after being persuaded to shoot The Greatest Story Ever Told with a US crew in Monument Valley instead of cheaper foreign shores now only to be ridiculed and abused by the industry for his troubles...

2253700,5,B0007Z0NYQ,"It is 1917. Manech is a nineteen-year-old newly-drafted soldier in the French Army. Life is hard in the trenches, and the memory of his fiance waiting for him at home is the only thing that keeps him going amidst gray skies, gray days and gray, bloody death. But what if he were given a medical discharge? If he is injured--not too severely--they will send him home to his beloved Mathilde, and his young life can resume. The decision made, he maims his own hand and claims it was an accident. It is his bad luck that so many others have had this same idea. He is not believed, and instead is sentenced to die as a traitor, cast out of the trenches into the barren no-man's-land between the lines with four other men, each with a similar injury--perhaps self-inflicted, perhaps not.

It is 1920. Mathilde is still not satisfied with the puzzling official explanations she has been given for her fianc's death, and nurses the not-so-silent conviction that he is out there somewhere, lost but alive. After all, she says, if he were dead, she would know. Ignoring the sensible advice of those around her, she sets out on a quest to find out what really happened on that lonely battlefield in France. The story is revealed piece by piece, each new puzzle piece completely altering the composition until we cannot be sure what is true, what is false, and what is mere interpretation . . .

The plot is elegant and masterful, the acting is both wonderfully human and beautifully precise, and the technical aspects of the film are stunning. This is one of the best films of 2004. It's too bad France refused to submit it to the Oscars; it would have given Million Dollar Baby a run for its money.",1139270400,8,1689,4.570957095709571

The country scenery was beautiful and peaceful, and I also loved the ocean scenes as well. The war scenes in this movie were very dreary and probably very realistic. You can't help but root for Mathilde, and feel terrible for her fiance. Definitely plan to spend a long time in front of the tv- we had to turn it off about halfway through because it was late and we had to work the next day- but neither of us could sleep!

2253702,5,B0007Z0NYQ,"This director just keeps topping himself.  DELICATESSEN was an amazing artistic achievement, as was CITY OF LOST CHILDREN.  We'll forgive the failed attempt to make a Hollywood film (the fourth ALIEN movie).  Audrey Tautou and Jean-Pierre Jeunet previously collaborated on AMELIE, also a fantastic film, and at the time, Jeunet's best work.  But A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT tops them all.

Part romance, part war story, the plot is ever fascinating and continuously keeps you hooked in.  The characters are all well-drawn and compelling.  The editing and sound design are excellent.  The cinematography, my favorite aspect of this movie, is jaw-droppingly beautiful.  Every shot is like a masterfully created painting.  Usually, I can get into a movie if one of the above attributes is executed well.  But A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT delivers on all counts... a very rare achievement for a film.

If I have ONE complaint about this film is that I don't speak French.  Normally, subtitles don't bother me at all.  But viewing this film, I found myself torn between following the dialog as it flashed by at the bottom of the screen and absorbing the cinematography... both were so well done, I could never decide which to focus on!  You really need to watch this movie twice... once to read the subtitles and follow the story.  And then a second time, with the subtitles off, just to take in how beautiful this movie looks.

One of the best films I've seen in many years.  Hollywood should be taking notes.",1137715200,3,1494,4.884462151394422
2253703,5,B0007Z0NYQ,"Jean-Pierre Jeunet teamed with elfin Audrey Tautou to steal our hearts with the hyper-romantic surrealistic comedy ""Amelie.""  Paris had never looked better, and Tautou burst into the American film consciousness as one of the most endearing actors working today.  Completely original and still surprising after several repeat viewings, ""Amelie"" is an intelligent tonic for the blackest of moods.

Jeunet reunited with Tautou for the flip-side of the romantic coin with ""A Very Long Engagement.""  This movie is a romance, to be sure, but a romance dominated by melancholy, by loss, and by dashed hopes.  Set in France during and just after the dark days of World War I (and magnificently recreated, by the way), ""Engagement"" once again follows two lovers, Mathilde (Tautou) and Manech (Gaspard Ulliel).  Childhood friends grow into sweethearts, only to be torn asunder by France's never-ending need for future corpses in its insane trench warfare against the Germans.

If no movie can ever really capture the horrors of trench warfare, ""Engagement"" comes as close as one can imagine.  The movie opens with the stories of five Frenchmen accused (some fairly, others not) if self-mutiliation to get themselves excused from combat.  A heartless senior commander ignores their pardon, and they are each sentenced to die by being sent out unarmed into the blasted No Man's Land between the German and French lines.  Within 24 hours, each soldier is reported as killed in action.

But Mathilde knows that Manech is still alive.  They have one of those romances where hearts know truths that cannot be stained by newspaper reports or Army records.  So Mathilde starts her long quest to find her lost Manech.  Through her journeys into Manech's time at the front, she meets several soldiers, wives, girlfriends, and parents, and they each tell her a smidgen of the story of her beloved.  Her journey is often confusing (in no small part, no doubt, caused by my complete ignorance of French and my need to rely on the subtitles), but always compelling.

Jeunet is a masterful filmmaker, blending humor, romance, and carnage into a wonderful montage of highs and lows.  In ""Amelie,"" he kept our sides splitting with comic gems such as the garden gnome travelling the world, or an abusive shopkeeper getting his comeuppance, or even the shocking suicide that takes two lives as the jumper leaps off Notre Dame only to land on someone else.  In ""Engagement,"" there is a lot less comedy and most of the shocking scenes coming from the battlefield (including a hydrogen-filled blimp incinerating a hospital and a soldier using a hand grenade to bring down an enemy airplane).  But he still finds little ways to bring enchantment into the story, whether it's a jarring splash of color in a washed out battlefield or the shot of Mathilde playing her tuba on the French coastline.

The acting is top-notch across the board here.  Look for many of the same actors from ""Amelie"" to find their way into ""Engagement,"" and also look for a magnificent, heart-breaking cameo by Jodie Foster -- effortlessly demonstrating both her acting chops and her command of French.

""Engagement"" is a dark, powerful film, and there are several violent scenes that will fall into the ""Saving Private Ryan"" category.  But none of the violence is gratuitous - it serves a purpose, if only to remind everyone of France's self-inflicted military scars.  And these scenes of carnage are used to elevate the story of love that drives the movie swiftly through its 2 1/4 hours.

A wonderful film that will appeal to history buffs, romantics, and fans of grand spectacles.  Let's hope that Jeunet can keep this filmmaking team together, 'cause they make magic.",1137628800,5,3713,5.0163132137031

2253706,5,B0007Z0NYQ,"I was prepared to dislike ""Un long dimanche de fianailles"", reasoning that a 131 minute French WWI era epic costing $56 Million would be bloated and ponderous, in the tradition of ""Gone With the Wind"". Instead I found a complex story that blended visual mastery with emotional intimacy. While the huge budget was there for all to see in the wonderful production design, it did not overwhelm the human elements of the film.

If you have not seen this film try to imagine a ""Paths of Glory"" premise, leading to a woman's obsessive quest on almost the intensity level of Truffaut's ""The Story of Adele H"", and revealed in a storytelling style like that of Akira Kurosawa's ""Rashmon"".

Like Kurosawa's classic, Jean-Pierre Jeunet's ""Un long dimanche de fianailles"" illustrates the subjectivity of truth. In this case soldiers in both the French and the German trenches witness the disciplinary banishment of five French soldiers to the ""no-mans-land"" between their trenches (apparently the French were enamored enough by the English term for this area that they adopted it). As the heroine and her detective track down individual survivors they discover conflicting accounts of what became of each marooned soldier. Each witness saw the same thing but from their own individual perspective. Obviously this misdirection device is not original (see ""The Hole"" for a particularly nice recent example) but it is very effective and is simply one weapon in a director's arsenal of ways to take the viewer where they want them to go.

Amelie"" star Audrey Tautou, the ""Adele H"" of this film, is a young woman who refuses (""An albatross is stubborn, he knows he can outlast the wind"") to believe her fiance and childhood sweetheart is dead. They have been in love since age nine. French films are big on this childhood sweetheart angle. Although I have never known an actual couple who can trace their romantic involvement all the way back to this early age, it does provide an excuse for some of the film's best scenes; the polio disabled girl being carried to the top of the lighthouse by her young admirer, where they kiss each other on opposite sides of the glass window.

""Un long dimanche de fianailles's"" greatest strength is also it's greatest weakness as the complex ""Rashmon-like"" storytelling technique and huge array of characters and incidents requires close attention or careful note taking to keep viewers from being overwhelmed. This is made even more challenging by the need to read subtitles (unless your French is way better than mine) while attempting to view the action.

It could benefit from a little selective trimming, like losing the moronic and completely unnecessary hospital scene with the silly exploding hydrogen balloon. This scene does not fit the tone and texture of the film but it probably cost so much to stage that they felt compelled to utilize it. It subtracts 10 IQ points from the target audience.

Tautou's character Mathilde is able to enlist the aid of a famous private detective (The Peerless Pry) at a bargain price because his own little girl is likewise a polio victim. Two recurrent devices are used repeatedly to unify this complex story. The first is Mathilde's heartbreakingly vivid reliance upon little superstitions to tell her if her soldier is still alive (""if I reach the bend before the car Manech will return safely""). The second is a comic relief bit involving the rural postman's dramatic arrival on his bicycle with the latest dispatch to advance the story (""When I see gravel I make it a point of arriving in style').

Fortunately, Jeunet does not give into the temptation to go out on an overly dramatic note but instead ends with a restrained poetic voice-over. Very nice.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1131321600,29,3773,4.929133858267717

Teaming up with the creative force behind the international hit ""Amelie"", we the audienece are treated a sometimes surreal, heartbreaking and uplifting look at the world through the eyes of a determined young lady. Audrey Tautou stars as Mathilde, a young bride to be whose fiance Manech has been sent to World War 1 only to not return. Their special bond allows Mathilde to have hope that her fiance didn't die in the War despite what everyone says. What follows is a series of events that astounds, angers and delights the audience as we join Mathilde in her quest to find out what became of her Beloved Manech.

Director Jeunet creates beautiful scenes all wrapped in his trademark sepia tones that makes the visuals take on a surreal, almost dreamy effect. His ability to give you a quick rundown on each character's strange quirks and idiosyncracies  is one of the joys of watching his films.

As one other reviewer wrote it was also a joy to see Jodie Foster give a fantastic performance as a Parisian lady who also lost her husband to the war.

2253734,5,B0007Z0NYQ,"Of the two world wars, the first one caught my attention due to the absurdity of the trench warfare and the lack of clear evil on either side. A Very Long Engagement is the story of Mathilde's search for her lost fianc&eacute; who disappeared in the war. It is a love story for all the soldiers who left behind fianc&eacute;'s, wives and loved ones. The novel by Sebastien Japriosot, read many years ago, didn't leave much of an impression on me but something about the gorgeous cinematography and pacing of the film did.

Almost like an afterthought, A Very Long Engagement portrays trench warfare more effectively than any film I can remember, except perhaps All Quiet on the Western Front. Sentimental family reunions, the reading of letters, everyday conversations, pull us into scenes of brutality on the front. When an old war hero arrives at Mathilde's house to recount a tale of the war, his suspenseful story is intercut with a visual representation of the actual events. Mathilde is shocked by his story, but the soldier is not finished and goes on to say, ""what happened next was even worse . . .""

The investigative pace of the film will please anyone who appreciates a mystery. The ridiculously named Bingo Cr&eacute;puscule, where the main events take place, is visited repeatedly from the perspective of various soldiers. The fate of Mathilde's fianc&eacute; is revealed through acts of bravery and betrayal. The motif of MMM (Mathilde marries Manech) works nicely at several plot turns.

I liked the fact that the film never lingers on tragedy, humor, love, memory or present moment too long. All these emotional scenes are shuffled together rather quickly, leaving only the clear line of the ""wire"" to hold on to. This feels like a more realistic approximation of what these characters must be going through and preserves a lightness of tone.

A Very Long Engagement has a rich look to it and high production values. Saturated shots of the French countryside are contrasted with the grays and blues of the trench or the polished look of Paris.

Other startling scenes include a silent-film style French Guillotine execution, a meeting between Mathilde and a woman on a parallel path, and a view through the trenches while soldiers arm their bayonets.",1130716800,,2267,4.939632545931759

2253738,5,B0007Z0NYQ,"A Very Long Engagement is based on the novel by S&eacute;bastien Japrisot, and follows a spunky Breton girl crippled by polio, Mathilde (played by the luminous Audrey Tautou from Am&eacute;lie) as she searches for her fianc&eacute;, who was supposedly executed for treason during WWI. Several of the cast and crew from Am&eacute;lie reappear, including Ticky Holgado, who plays an oily private detective, director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, and cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel, whose rich colors saturate and bring to life bygone eras with ease. There are some similarities to Am&eacute;lie: Mathilde says to herself, ""If I reach the bend in the road before the car, Manech will come home alive,"" and other such similar incantations in an effort to stave off bad luck.

The story switches between Mathilde's quest for the truth as she infiltrates military archives, tracks down wives of the other soldiers executed for self-mutilation, and struggles to maintain hope that her fianc&eacute; Manech (the charmingly boyish Gaspard Ulliel) somehow survived the brutal punishment of being tossed into No Man's Land and left to fend for himself, and Manech's experiences in the horrific front line trenches filled with mud, rats, and corpses, constant shellings, and the spectre of death that stalks them. We see men blown apart into shockingly vibrant confetti, stabbings by bayonet, murders, and the darkest sides of humanity that war brings out in people. There are a confusing number of characters, particularly in the trenches, but Jeunet makes an effort to develop distinct personalities for each since they all have similar appearances.

One highlight is Jodie Foster as the Polish wife of one of the officers in Manech's company. Jodie was fluent in French by the age of fourteen, and does all her own voiceovers in French editions of her films, so it was a charming surprise to see her delightful character here.

Beautiful on-location scenery in Brittany (Finist&egrave;re), Paris, and the countryside, a lush soundtrack, vibrant cinematography, eye-popping visual effects, and a luminous optimism for life in the midst of the horrors of war, A Very Long Engagement is sure to delight fans of Am&eacute;lie, WWI buffs, and lovers of romance alike.

The bonus DVD includes segments on how the film's incredible visual effects were accomplished, a documentary of Paris in the 1920s, deleted scenes with director's commentary, and a making of featurette.

2253739,4,B0007Z0NYQ,"_A Very Long Engagement_ is a beautfully filmed, entertaining, heartbreaking movie, that follows the novel by Sebastien Japrisot, that shares its name eand upon which it is based, most of the time. However, the spirit of the novel and the spirit of the movie are very different.

  I was both pleased and dissappointed with the job this director, the same that directed _Amelie_, also starring Audrey Tautou, did with this story. This movie has the same upbeat whimsy of _Amelie_, the same mix of the tragic and the absurd, as well as the jubilant and comical that _Amelie_ did. However, it did not always fit with the story as I imagined it when reading the novel. The novel is very tragic, but filled with hope. The extra tones of the movie (the absurd, especially), did not belong. I felt that these detracted from the simple heart-wrenching beauty of the story itself.

  The other complaint that I had was the treatment of the character of Tina Lombardi in the film. A deeply tragic character, she plays a very important, and rather large role in the novel. In the film, however, her character seems as though she were thrown into the story - her storyline seems like a filmmaker's afterthought, and the tragedy of it is lost. The string of murder's that she commits are so contrived and executed with such complicated machinery in the film that she seems to be almost a murderous parody of Inspector Gadget. This character should have had more screen time but with out all of the fancy machinery that the director adds.

  Watching the film a second time, I tried to forget that I'd read the novel, and forget that I knew the story before, and I really enjoyed the movie. It's a great story, the acting is wonderful, and I laughed and cried - all signs, to me at least, of a great film.

2253764,4,B0007Z0NYQ,This film was excellent.  Loved the attention to detail and the trench scenes gave an incredible look into the life of the ordinary French soldier.  Interesting plot too and some fine acting.,1125360000,,191,4.9375
2253765,4,B0007Z0NYQ,"After the phenomenal success of Amlie, Jean-Pierre Jeunet could have played it safe. Instead, he parlayed that success into an ambitious romantic tale set against the backdrop of World War I. A Very Long Engagement reunites Jeunet with his star from Amlie, Audrey Tautou, allowing her to stretch as an actress.

As with all of Jeunet's movies, this is a beautiful looking motion picture, expertly shot by Bruno Delbonnel and reinforcing that the director is still one of the premiere cinematic stylists. In contrast to the grim, harrowing war scenes, the ones at home are shot in a warm, sepia tone colour like an old, faded photograph. As with Amlie there is an incredible amount of detail contained in every scene that often threatens to overwhelm the actors. Jeunet applies the same fractured, hyper-realistic style he used so well in Amlie (he is the master at little visual asides, inserts that provide brief insights into a character) to this ambitious hybrid love story-war film-mystery. However, Audrey Tautou has such a compelling, striking presence that she is never lost in the film's arresting visuals.

Those looking for the emotional pay-off of Amlie will be disappointed. After two hours and all of the convoluted plot twists that one has to navigate, you feel a little cheated by the lack of a satisfying emotional conclusion. Did we and poor Mathilde go through so much only to reach such a lackluster conclusion? Perhaps that is the point Jeunet is trying to make. That war has its costs. Men are killed, go crazy or just lose their way. There is a glimmer of hope at the end of A Very Long Engagement but it is an anti-climatic feeling.

On the first disc is an audio commentary by director Jean-Pierre Jeunet. For the war scenes he used Word War I photos as references and drew upon his own experiences in the military while admitting that on a technical level he was inspired by Saving Private Ryan. This is a very informative track with Jeunet speaking constantly and candidly.

The second disc starts off with a feature-length making of documentary entitled, ""A Year at the Front: Behind the Scenes of `A Very Long Engagement.'"" It goes from the storyboarding/pre-production phase to the completed movie with no narration, instead opting for a fly-on-the-wall approach. This is quite a detailed look at the filmmaking process and an excellent companion piece to Jeunet's commentary.

""Parisian Scenes"" is a look at how they changed contemporary Paris into one of the `20s: a mix of CGI and practical sets, props and costumes. Jeunet has worked with the same crew for five movies and so they know what to expect from him but this film was particularly challenging in terms of its scale.

""Before the Explosion..."" examines how they pulled off the impressive hydrogen-filled zeppelin explosion sequence.

Finally, there are 14 deleted scenes with optional commentary by Jeunet. They don't add up to much in terms of time as the director explains that he does most of his cutting during the script stage and that way he has very little to cut during editing.",1125273600,,3078,4.8963531669865645

2253767,3,B0007Z0NYQ,"This film tells the story of a woman, Mathilde, searching for her fiance, Manech.  They are separated when the French army conscripts Manech to the trenches in World War I.  Very early on we see Manech courtmartialed for self-mutilation, deliberately allowing himself to be shot in the hand so that he'd be discharged from the army.  We also learn that he is a gentle, thoughtful, and sheltered soul who was unready for anything like the horrors of trench warfare, and basically cracks under the strain.  Instead of a nice, clean firing squad, he and 4 others accused of the same crime are forced over the top, weaponless, into no-man's land to either be killed by German snipers or to die of exposure.

Mathilde is informed that Manech is dead, but she knows in her heart that he is not.  She plays games with herself - ""If the reflection from his watch hits the crucifix on the wall, I know Manech is alive.""  She hires a private detective to help with her search.  She takes out ads in the paper asking for information.  She finds a prostitute who was in love with another of the court-martialled men and who is wreaking revenge on those that carried out the sentence.  These events allow the film to sweep from atop a lighthouse in Brittany to the island of Corsica, often with breathtaking scenery and seamless marriage of CGI and live action.  It also allows the introduction of a huge cast and many memorable characters.  Two are worth mentioning - the postman who delights in making skid marks with his bicycle in the gravel driveway of Mathilde's house, and the adulterous wife of another of the condemned men, played anachronistically by a well-known American actress (her accent is disguised under the guise of her character's Polish ethnicity, but it sounded pretty good to me anyway).  The other triumph of the film is the evocation of the front in WWI - the soldiers living in the mud and water, the long spells of boredom punctuated by sheer terror, the mutinousness of the soldiers (on all sides) as the war dragged into its 4th year, etc.

The film is in French, of course.  Many have complained that the subtitles are hard to keep up with.  They are not - they are plain, easy to read, and accurate, if terse (however, my French is rusty, made more inadequate by the fact that the Parisian accent is very different from the Quebecoise accent I learned in school).  I'm sure that if I was fluent in French I'd pick up a lot more nuance from the roles.  As it was, I found the sheer number of characters to be somewhat confusing and the subtitiled dialogue was not interesting enough to really draw me in.  The failing of the film is that it's just a little too long (at 2:15) with too many little side-plot diversions.

The DVD is quite a nice package, and includes a number of nifty extras.  There is a long and informative making-of feature that is quite raw in its production value (not the highly-polished and edited as Peter Jackson or George Lucas versions), but is all the more charming for it.  There are cut scenes as well, a commentary, and so on.  Certainly this 2-disc set is a worthy offering, and perhaps I'll enjoy the movie more on second or third viewings, once I am able to concentrate more on the scenery and acting, and not so distracted by the plot twists and multitudinous characters.",1123372800,9,3323,4.594915254237288

While some prefer films to be dubbed I always try to get the movie in it's original language with subtitles because you get a better feel for the way the lines are supposed to be said.

1-if you want to watch specifically based on your love of the film Amelie-I think you'll be disappointed. It's a entirely different premise than that film.

2-this film is definately NOT for those under at least 16-it has several fairly graphic sex scenes and many hard to watch, violent war scenes. Depending on your teens maturity level, it could be watched, but I'd suggest you pre watch it yourself to decide if it would be suitable for your teen.

3-watch this film when you have ample time and a quiet house. As mentioned previously, the film is long, and you'll need all your attention to keep up with the subtitles.

The film is tragic one moment, hilarious the next, visually stunning, and Audrey Tantou is a treat as always-you'll see many old favorites from Amelie and Delicatessen, and well as Jodie Foster speaking fluent French-which is worth the price of admission by itself:) It's quirky and hauntingly beautiful-well worth watching.

2253771,2,B0007Z0NYQ,"I'm not sure how he pulled it off, but the director has managed to make a dull film out of fine novel of love and war. Actually, I do know how he pulled it off: by focusing on the scenery and the cinematography at the expense of a compelling narrative--a common problem to be sure. Interestingly, he manages to create a saccherine look where one would expect--in the life-as-it-never-was scenes of French rural life, where a fat chuckling aunt is always stirring at the stove while the wry and eternally good-natured farmer stands at the ready to refill your glass with the fine local vintage--but also where one would not expect. So, for example, in the scenes at the front we see the mud at just the right depth, the uniforms all exactly right, the trenches perfectly constructed, and so on. But in striving for this superficial perfection, the filmmaker forgets to engage the viewer. Even a scene in which a prostitute violently revenges herself on a customer is curiously clean and full of art, but no life. The upshot is that you don't care about a single one of the characters, who are all stock caricatures in any case. If you've read the book, you'll definitely want to pass on the film; if you haven't, you'll have a much richer experience if you pick it up and pass on this unfortunate mistake.",1122854400,10,1304,4.600858369098712
2253772,3,B0007Z0NYQ,"""A Very Long Engagement"" is lovely looking, alternately bathed in a golden homefront glow and a barren gray warscape. World War I is just ending as five court-martialed Frenchmen are sent into ""no man's land"" to face certain death. One of them is engaged to a farmgirl who is unconvinced of his  demise. She inquires into his fate and those of the four other soldiers, their comrades, friends, families, and just about everyone these people ever encountered in the course of a couple of years.

It is difficult to keep their stories straight (they come and go, some never to return) while hurrying to read the subtitles and at the same time admire the painterly images gracing and racing across the screen. The movie opens with a series of rapid vignettes of the five soldiers using flashbacks and a narrator speaking in French. If you don't keep up here you may not catch up later. We shouldn't have to revisit a film to savor its nuances, of which this one has a goodly share.

It is at once a tender romance, a detective story, and a grim account of trench warfare. Strong scenes from all three are shuffled together and flash onto the screen, some of them compelling but having little to do with the girl's search for her sweetheart. At one point, she seeks out a woman who later writes to her of how she tried to conceive by the friend of her impotent husband; the woman, who flashbacks her tale, is played by the unbilled bilingual American actress Jodie Foster.

As he did in the popular ""Amelie,"" Jean-Pierre Jeunet directs the gamin Audrey Tautou in the showcase role (she is soon to appear opposite Tom Hanks in ""The DaVinci Code""). He and his CGI team have created some vivid scenes and impressive  settings, but this is a large-scale movie with a small-scale mindset. Because of a rules snafu, France as expected chose not to submit it for a 2004 best foreign film Oscar. In that category, at least, the best picture really did win.",1122336000,3,1944,4.606936416184971

2253785,3,B0007Z0NYQ,"There aren't many Hollywood smiles that can match Audrey Tautou's small, impish grin. It's not wide and glamourous, but it's knowing, clever, masking deeper emotions. One of the weaknesses of ""A Very Long Engagement"" is Tautou doesn't smile much at all - her character, a World War I-era farmgirl named Mathilde, is a grim one, quiet  and determined, but not joyful. And since it's a war movie, about the most barbaric and grueling of any European war, the role doesn't call for joy.

But, then, ""A Very Long Engagement"" isn't exactly about the war in any linear sense. Cross ""Amelie"" with ""Rashomon"" and the visual battle style of ""Enemy At The Gates"" and you have this film, directed with flourish by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who is never boring but swinging for a fence he can't reach, a mixture of drama and romance and, unfortunately, intricate mystery about the fate of Mathilde's fiancee, Manech (Gaspard Ulliel) after he is sent into no man's land between the front-line trenches of the Germans and the French.

Mathilde clings to the belief that Manech survived, and there are about 12 different perspectives from the men on the front lines, some just incomplete, some just wrong, many presented in a way that makes them seem factual, but aren't.

These theories are intercut with the quest of a prostitute Tina Lombardi's (Marion Cotilliard) to avenge the death of her lover, who was part of Manech's ill-fated group. Her story is given only a handful of moments, but it's more interesting anyway, and a scene between Mathilde and Tina is one of the movie's best. Jeunet stages the bombing of a military hospital - which, for reasons unknown, houses a hydrogen blimp - late in the film, and it too is terrifically dramatic - but ultimately unrelated to the fate of Manech. Jeunet seems to understand that the sheer volume of plot waters down the main romance, so he plays to the script's high points while neglecting the central conceit. At some point ""A Very Long Engagement"" becomes a tour of the horrors of the time. Little more.

Ulliel plays the boy they call ""Cornflower"" with a mixture of tenderness and sacrifice, but we don't know him like we know those who saw him last, who talk as much about their own adventures as they do Manech. Is it cold to suggest Manech isn't worth finding?

Tautou is disappointing, not so much for her performance, which alternates the notes of despair and hope nicely, but the role of the polio-stricken Mathilde, who limps her way to her true lover. I admire the girl's caginess and feminine wiles, but she's a drag and wee bit precious at the same time, a trait that played swell in ""Amelie"" but is wrong for a period drama.

The leads aside, ""A Very Long Engagement"" boasts a large cast of burly, gregarious men with mustaches and quietly tortured men with Little Prince faces. It's not easy to keep them straight. And Jodie Foster offers her talent in an unbilled role as the wife who cheated with a man who was friends with her husband who may have mistakenly seen Manech die, but in any case gave his boots to his friend, who did die, and whose boots were rumored to have been worn by Manech after that, but weren't. I think.

Get all that? Do you want to?",1121904000,6,3206,4.661946902654868
2253786,5,B0007Z0NYQ,"Although I am a fan of Audrey Tautou, John-Pierre Jeunet, and indeed French films in general, I was at first reluctant to see this film. I do not usually enjoy war films, and from what I had heard, this film featured brutally realistic depictions of WWI trench life. However, I am certainly glad that I finally gave in.

The movie tells the story of Mathilde, an intelligent young girl crippled by a childhood bout of polio, and Manech, her fiance who was supposedly executed during WWI for self-mutiliation. When Mathilde receives notice of Manech's death, she refuses to believe that her fiance is truly dead, and she embarks on a long and arduous quest to discover the truth about Manech's fate.

In addition to a wonderfully complex and emotional performance from Audrey Tautou (who is one of the best actresses working in French cinema today), as well as a cameo from Hollywood's own Oscar darling Jodie Foster, this film is a veritable banquet for the eyes. Like his previous film 'Amelie', director John-Pierre Jeunet has filled this film with swooping camera shots, eye-popping cityscapes of Paris, and (unique to this film) beautiful views of the French countryside. Particularly effective is his use of colour - the dull greys and browns of the battlefield trenches contrast greatly with the warm golden/sepia haze that seems to hang over Mathilde's Britanny cottage. Particularly beautiful shots include one of Mathilde gazing over the ocean from the top of a lighthouse at sunset; a sudden wind sweeping over a golden wheatfield, pressing the wheat to the ground in eerie waves; and a slow trailing shot following Mathilde as she wanders through a bustling outdoor Parisian market. John-Pierre Jeunet certainly knows how to please the eye!

This film also features many heart-wrenching scenes of WWI battlefields, but they are tastefully done and (to the best of my knowledge) give a very good sense of what life in the trenches must have been like. Although, as I said, I am not typically a fan of war films, I thought the scenes were very well done and they were definitely integal to the forwarding of the plot.

As far as the plot goes, the movie is thoroughly engaging from first to last. Although the film is long (over two hours), the plot is a complex one that warrants a lengthy running time, and I was certainly not watching the clock during this movie. This is certainly a film that deserves multiple viewings, however, since it is occassionally difficult to keep track of the entire gallery of supporting characters.

In conclusion, this film has something for almost anyone, and I strongly recommend it. In my opinion, it was one of the best films of 2004, and was woefully under-represented at the Academy Awards.

P.S.: I also recommend the novel 'A Very Long Engagement', by Sebastien Japrisot. Although markedly different in some respects, the novel is utterly compelling and beautifully written.",1121644800,10,2925,4.94704684317719
2253787,4,B0007Z0NYQ,"""A Very Long Engagement""  is a sumptuous film by director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, adapted from S&eacute;bastien Japrisot's novel ""Un long dimanche de fianailles"". Mathilde (Audrey Tautou) is a young Frenchwoman who lost her fianc&eacute; in World War I. Three years after his reported death, a former soldier summons Mathilde to the hospital where he is confined and tells her the story of how her beloved Manech (Gaspard Ulliel) met his death. Sergeant Esperanza (Jean-Pierre Becker) was charged with escorting 5 men who had been condemned for self-inflicted wounds, Manech among them, to their execution in 1917. They were taken to a comically named trench ""Bingo Cr&eacute;puscule"", where they were to be put over the wall into the no man's land between the French and German lines and left to die. Mathilde departs with a box of letters from the 5 men to their families, which illness had prevented Esperanza from delivering, and a renewed hope, perhaps obsession, that her Manech may have survived.

I expected ""A Very Long Engagement"" to be a sentimental quest for a long lost love. It is, but as the film progresses and we learn about the 5 condemned men, its allure crept up on me. About half of the film had passed and I had begun to think it too long to sustain one woman's romantic fixation when I noticed that a real mystery had developed. Mathilde's pursuit of information about Manech and his comrades produces more questions than solutions, and the audience slowly realizes that there is something peculiar going on. The film gives the impression of a romantic epic, but it is the mystery that sustains interest.

I have yet to see Audrey Tautou play an extroverted character, and Mathilde is another introvert: superstitious, morose, and consumed by her mission. Tautou gives her a mischievous charm. Jodie Foster, whom I don't believe has done a French film in 20 years, has a nice supporting role as the wife of one of the condemned soldiers. ""A Very Long Engagement"" has a rich, sumptuous visual style of idealized French countryside. The difference between real backgrounds and digital backgrounds is sometimes obvious, but their styles are so consistent that it didn't bother me. ""A Very Long Engagement"" is sentimental, but Mathilde's investigation stimulates curiosity after a while and pulls the viewer into the unfolding drama of ""Bingo Cr&eacute;puscule"". French with subtitles.

The DVD (Warner Brothers 2005): Bonus features include a trailer, a soundtrack promo, and an audio commentary by director Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Jeunet discusses the film's visual allusions, casting, creative decisions, locations, some technical issues, and comparison to the novel. The commentary is constant, without lulls, but it's a kind of endless string of trivia with no comment on characters or themes. I wonder if that is explained by culture or if it is simply the way Jeunet likes to do his commentaries. The commentary is interesting, but doesn't address what one might expect it to. Subtitles are available for the film and commentary in English, French, and Spanish.",1121558400,3,3079,5.127490039840637
2253788,5,B0007Z0NYQ,"The idea that Jean-Pierre Jeunet would make another film starring Audrey Tautou that would remind you not only of their previous success with the international hit ""Am&eacute;lie"" is not at all surprising.  But the fact that ""A Very Long Engagement"" (""Un long dimanche de fianailles"") will also remind you of Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" is certainly unexpected.  Yet the contrast between a realistic depiction of the horrors of trench warfare in the First World War and Jeunet's inventive use of the camera and other cinematic tricks may well prove unpalatable to some, but I found this 2004 film totally captivating.  Besides, the war scenes are dominated by brown, with splotches of gray, which contrasts nicely with the golden glow of the scenes in the ""present"" focusing on Tautou's character.

In 1917 at the front in the Sommes, five French soldiers are court-martialed for the offense of self-mutilation.  For all but one of these men these were desperate acts to get out of the living hell of the trenches.  The condemned men are not shot by a firing squad, but instead are sent to the trench of Bingo Crepuscule where they are served a last meal and then sent out in the no man's land between the French and German lines.  Eyewitnesses report that none of the five survived, but Mathilde (Tautou) feels that she would know if her fianc&eacute;, Manech (Gaspard Ulliel), had died.  It is now 1920 and she is determined to find out what really happened to him.  Along the way she finds out about the other four soldiers and several of their comrades, just as we find out about how the shy, polio-stricken young Mathilde (Sol&egrave;ne Le Pechon) ended up with the young Manech (Virgil Leclaire), son of the lighthouse keeper.

Determined to find out the truth, Mathilde collects information from reluctant former soldiers, their family members, and government officials.  Her aunt (Chantal Neuwirth) and uncle (Dominique Pinon), who raised her when she was orphaned, wish Mathilde would accept that Manech is dead, but our heroine refuses.  Like the postman (Jean-Paul Rouve) who delivers letters to Mathilde answering her questions regarding the fate of her fianc&eacute;, we are caught up in her quest, and one of the best things I can say about this film is that while we are certainly hoping that the quest is not in vain, the stories that make up the journey are compelling enough that it works either way.  For example, when Mathilde goes to confront Elodie Gordes (Jodie Foster), the story she has to tell is memorable, but while it answers a few questions about what happened at Bingo Crepuscule, it does not get Mathilde any closer to finding Manech.  Yet even such dead ends constitute another piece of the puzzle, and S&eacute;bastien Japrisot's novel, which provides the words for the film's narration, is full of such pieces.  In the end, the story and the characters are as captivating as the compelling visual images that Jeunet provides in this rich film.

In the world of cinema the French army is far and away the most brutal one to ever be depicted.  In reality the Soviet army might have been worse, but all we have to go by is the opening sequence of ""Enemy at the Gates,"" while the cruelty of French officers has been established by ""Paths of Glory,"" and reinforced by every reference to the Dreyfus case (e.g., ""The Life of Emile Zola"").  Add to that the Vichy government that played along with the Nazis in ""Casablanca,"" and you are inclined to start thinking that once you get past the Napoleonic era the only good French general is a dead French general.  ""A Very Long Engagement"" certainly plays into that idea, but what stands out more is the graphic depiction of the trench warfare of the Great War.  There are few films about that war, but when you are talking about ""Wings,"" ""All Quiet on the Western Front,"" ""Sergeant York,"" and ""Gallipoli,"" you end up with a small but pretty good collection.  But just as ""Saving Private Ryan"" did for World War II, this film redefines cinematic realism for the War to End All Wars.  If the scenes of horror entwined with the romanticism of Mathilde's quest does not offend your sensibilities, you will find ""A Very Long Engagement"" to be a glorious film.",1121472000,2,4242,4.822068965517241

This immensely moving portrait of WW1 and actual trench-warfare [we're fortunately spared the results of mustard gas] reminds us to look closely at the 'reasons' behind war and its aftermath.

Audrey Tatou is brilliant as the fiancee who does not give up and constantly plays little games with her conscience [?] and god to reaffirm her belief that her soul-mate is alive.  [Her performance reminds us of Mamoulian's advice to Garbo ""Queen Christina"" - the final scene]  Tatou's face alone states it all.

The landscape is vast - taking us from the WW1 trenches, through the agonies of domestic separation to quaint revenge [the bordello mirror episode].  Superior/Award winning Art Direction, Costume and score [but that's always the standard  Juenet sets - perfection].

This movie should be mandatory viewing for the young ~ just as a reminder.

[Jodie Foster shines - and brings ever-new dimensions - as the misbegotten wife, facing a unique dilemma ~ all for love].

2253790,5,B0007Z0NYQ,"War is filthy, nasty, and bloody.  It is also a form of disagreement where one or more parts of society has decided that verbal communication can no longer achieve the desired result, and thus, tries to convince the disagreeing party through brutal physical force.  The force is most usually not carried out by those who tend to disagree, as they draft innocents to carry out the disagreement with full force.  The innocents usually are too busy to worry about national power struggles, as they have to carry out their daily labor while providing food and shelter for loved ones.  If the innocents disagree with those who recruited or drafted them they will most likely face a court martial, and in the past, even death.  A Very Long Engagement plays out un the backdrop of the French government who drafted and sentenced a group of five innocents to death due to cowardice through self-mutilation during the end of World War I.

Jean-Pierre Jeunet opens with a genuine visual description of the realities of war during World War I.  The rain pours down over the desolated no man's land between the French and German border in 1917 in the opening shot.  Relentless artillery fire has stripped the land on the battle front from all sign of life while the rain water slowly seeks its way to the lowest place - the trenches.  The trenches are the home of the soldiers where they have to live among water, mud, urine, body parts, and other disgusting objects.  Endless machine gun fire forces the men to remain below the top edge of the trench as bullets hungrily seek new living targets above.  The poor conditions due to rain and overcrowding in the trenches develop terrible hygiene among the men, which creates several other enemies besides the ones in the opposing trench such as trench foot, trench fever, and other illnesses that often caused death.

Death seems to be the only way out for those who arrive to the front, which makes the notion of hope a meaningless dream.  Seasons develop different kinds of obstacles in the trenches.  Winter brings cold while in the summer diseases peaks in the trenches, as the overwhelming stench of rotting human flesh and feces would make any normal person throw-up.  As if this was not enough, the men constantly struggle with sleep deprivation due to nightly bombardments while proper meals are something of a heavenly dream.  Morale could not be lower while an abundance of madness lingers in minds of the soldiers in this nightmarish home of World War I.  Unknowingly at the time, this is a year before the end of World War I, but for those who live in the trenches it might as well have been an eternity until the end of the war.  The only desires these men have are to leave the madness of the trenches behind them at any cost.

Having the notions of the conditions of World War I in the mind, it becomes clear what compels a man to shoot their own hand while trying to leave the trenches and the battlefront behind them.  In he beginning of the film Jeunet introduces five men who all have shot their own hand in order to avoid the trenches.  However, all of the five men have been sentenced to death due to the act of self-mutilation, which is observed as a sign of cowardice.  The five condemned wander through the trench at Bingo Crepuscule where flashbacks disclose the identity of the five men.  Up to this point in this review, you the reader, might think that A Very Long Engagement is a war film, but do not let this notion trick you.  This is a love story where one of the five condemned men, Manech (Gaspard Ulliel), who is or was, which is never clear until the end, engaged to Mathilde (Audrey Tautou).

Two years after World War I, Mathilde still awaits the return of Manech, her first and only love.  She holds on to her hope that he is still alive through silly speculations and wishful thinking while she contacts survivors from Bingo Crepuscule where Manech supposedly died.  Through many of survivors Mathilde hears often the similar stories of his death, but she refuses to accept the stories.  Persistently, she hires a private detective to look up more information while she continues her own personal investigation of the fate of her fianc.  Unlike the trench war previously described, Mathilde quest resembles a fairy tale where she is determined to find her prince.

To say that this is an anti-war film might be true to some degree, but it does not present a complete image of the story.  Jeunet portrays several different notions in this story such as love, hope, death, relationships, vengeance, and more.  Through the survivors from Bingo Crepuscule Mathilde learns much about the five condemned men, but the audience also learns much about why life is worth living through these stories.  In essence, A Very Long Engagement tells a story of life and the glue of life - love.  Love is the main theme, which Jeunet throws into contrast with numerous different notions such as death, hatred, and anger.  Through the contrasting elements Jeunet accentuates the importance of love.  Thus, it is more accurately stated that this is a love story.

There is strong presence of cinematic symbolism that Jeunet uses from the opening scene with the broken crucifix with a partial and dangling icon of Christ until the very final scene.  In the first scene, the importance of hands comes into the image where the Christ icon hangs from only one hand.  The five men were also injured in their hands while several scenes stress the importance of hands carrying out actions.  This could suggest that people with two hands can carry out different kind of deeds. In this case, the hand could deliver both love and hatred.  Love representing emotional touch and handshakes while hatred displays the notion of pulling a trigger that kills another fellow human being.  Thus, the notion of mutilating one hand could then extend the thought that the five condemned wanted to end their ability to carry out hatred and brutality against mankind.

In a clever intricate woven tale Jeunet incorporates flashbacks and voiceovers into a complex narration of Mathilde's pursuit for the lost Manech.  Visually the fragmented storyline encourages the audience to ponder Mathilde's yearning for Manech along with the aftermath of war, which displays terrific editing.  The camerawork bears a resemblance to his preceding films Delicatessen (1991), The City of Lost Children (1995), and Amelie (2001), but it still feels original.  It is obvious that Jeunet is more comfortable telling stories that are slightly bizarre and fantastic.  What Mathilde learns about Manech's fate will not be revealed here, but one thing is certain, A Very Long Engagement is a marvelously touching story that offers both comedy and tragedy on a very high level.",1121299200,5,6788,4.812068965517241
2253791,5,B0007Z0NYQ,"""Un long dimanche de fianailles"" (A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT) is a visual wonder of a film, a tremendously entertaining epic that offers history, World War I from the French point of view, suspense, intrigue, and a healthy dose of romance.  Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet conducts this cinematic symphony based on the novel by S&eacute;bastien Japrisot and has achieved that fine balance between historical incident and romantic illusion.  Clocking in at 134 minutes this is a huge project but the result is as personal and tender an unpretentious love story as you'll ever encounter.

Though the plot is complex with many subplots, MANY characters, and nonlinear method of storyline, the basic tale is that of Mathilde (the beguiling Audrey Tautou), who from childhood has been crippled by polio, and Manech (Gaspard Ulliel) who has been with Mathilde since childhood in a lasting love relationship.  Manech is sent to war (the war is recreated is some of the more realistic rainy trenches situations ever filmed), and when the impact of constant horror becomes too much for him, Manech arranges for a gunshot wound to his hand and thus is condemned to death along with four other soldiers guilty of self-mutilation in order to avoid further battle.  The  fate of the five soldiers is in question and this fact that no one is sure what happened to the five is what drives the story.

Simply stated the story concerns Matilde's unwavering hope that Manech is still alive some years after the war and she hires a detective to investigate the whereabouts of Manech. Through her own intervention and association with incidental characters related in some way with each of the five soldiers Mathilde finally discovers the truth of her very long engagement.

Tautou and Ullieil are splendid in their roles: Tautou can create a character as much from her sensitive plastique face and expressions as from her lines.  The supporting cast is uniformly excellent and there is a very fine cameo by Jodie Foster as Elodie Gordes that allows her to broaden her impressive acting career with a French-speaking role!  The sets and costumes of 1920 France are perfectly achieved in ambience and the cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel who has elected to shoot the entire film in a sepia-toned pastiche of historic flavor is of the highest quality.  Add to this fine mix the original music score by Angelo Badalamenti  and the result is a film that is bound to have a long life.

Yes, there are a lot of films about wars and their effects on mankind and A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT is as well conceived as any of them.  Where this film emerges as unique in its genre is its emphasis on the indomitability of the human spirit: while the size of the project is monumental, the underlying spirit is intensely personal and as such is not afraid to add gentle humor to the mix.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, July 05",1121212800,3,2883,4.865030674846626
2253792,5,B0007Z0NYQ,"One writer stated that this is a movie for thinkers. To some degree, I disagree. I say it is a movie for the passionate. Granted, the average American viewer who wants all flash and pizzazz and a movie that isn't intellectually or emotionally challenging won't find this movie especially noteworthy.

It's unfortunate that some of the beans have already been spilled, because much of the ultimate glory and pleasure in this film is in NOT knowing some things (oh, like the ENDING, perhaps!!). I saw many similarities with Amelie in the way this movie was 'told'. And you'll recognize some of the same faces as well.

The story of one woman's determination, against all odds, to find and hopefully reunite with her one true love is vivdly and evocatively portrayed in this movie. Unless you are shallow or just not into movies with passion, this one will stay with you for some time.",1119312000,,882,4.758169934640523
2253803,5,B0007Z0NYQ,This movie is mainly about France in the World War One. It concerns the heartfelt lingering pain of the French families being torn asunder and split apart during thr war years. The main character Audrey Tatou plays in my opinion she represents the innocence of pre-war France and the lover she searches for is representative of going back to pre-war idealism and happy moments. Yet we can never go back can we? This movie is very unlike the film Amelie. This movie is dark and contemplative which makes it's happy moments stand out more sort of like life itself. This is a film for educated people. The average moe wouldn't understand it. The average moe doesn't see movies in French with english subtitles anyway. Thank heavens you the reader are more literate than the average moe. If you're a thinker you will simply LOVE the intelligence in this movie.

2253805,5,B0007Z0NYQ,"Once more the French fertile imagination decides to make a real punch demostration of superb good taste and charm picture, get its goals without apparent effort. The dinamism and engaging script won't let you down. You will face and be part of this sensible drama in search for a love in the middle of the First War. Pierre Jeunet employs the War only as a big frame to tell us a love story and the inexhaustive hope that feeds the soul of Audrey Tautoo, a twenty years old girl who never gives up for his love's life. She suffered of polio in her early childhood but that is not any obstacle to prevail in what she believes.
The script is real web that will involve several secondary stories but the whole ensamble is conceived as a huge watch mechanism, so well articulated and filled of intelligent doses of black humor all the way.
Andre Dussollier, Jodie Foster, Dominique Pinon and all the cast is simply outstanding. The crude war sequences are admirably well filmed, loaded with intense realism and profound humanity before any other circumstance. Jeunet does not judge, he just only watchs and presents the kindness and the abominable horror of certain human beings not only in the War but far beyond the War field. The destroyed indult letter of Poincar that never came, will work as a complex fixed idea of revenge because the life of these five men will be narrowed linked.
If you like the artistic films, if you want to enjoy of a whole film, without fissures that face you with the reality of those years you will enjoy this one. No doubt just a second and go for this artwork.
Nowadays the lovely, funny and expresive face of Audrey Tautoo. Jeune as Stanley Donen with the other Audrey, and at least fifty million people in the world are simply bewitched with her charisma and outstanding presence. Undoubtedly she would seem to fill the long long time expected emptiness left by the other Audrey, at last.

2253807,4,B0007Z0NYQ,"To make a filmed version of French bestselling novel 'A Very Long Engagement' has been THE dream of director Jean-Pieere Jeunet, best known for international hit 'Amelie.'  Now Warner Brothers, who owned the right of the book, agreed to co-produce the film with the star Audrey Tautou, and now this is the result of this Hollywood studio's wise decision.  Thank you, Warner Bros.

But the film is definitely French, in language and in style, and the story begins NOT with the endearing characters in Paris, but with the rain-soaked trenches during the time of WW1.  Five soliders are being court-marshalled for wounding themselves, and they are sentenced to be expelled into the no man's land, the terrirory between the German and French lines.  One of them happens to be young Manech (Gasper Ulliel, 100% different from 'Strayed'), who received a terrible shock during the last battle.

But the true protagonist is Matilde (Tautou radiently beautiful as ever).  She was in love with Manech, and still is even after the war is over, and the five soliders are supposed to be dead.  However, Matilde believes that her love is still alive.  Believing in her unfailing intuition, she doggedly follows the traces of the witnesses and clues that are scattered all over France while she needs a wheelchair to travel.

A word of warning first; unlike 'Amelie' in which everything looked charming (but in fact it is not though), some parts of 'A Very Long Engagement,' especially the war scenes, are very violent, though not too graphic.  And don't forget that there are some killings (by one mysterious lady Tina).  But her MOs are so ingenious that you may be rather fascinated to see them.

The film is well-crafted in whatever way you may think of -- gracefully Gothic visuals, rousing music score (by Angelo Paralamenti known for David Lynch films), and first-rate acting (including by one Jodie Foster speaking French.  And she was once in a French film 'Blood of the Others' by Claude Chabrol, so that's no surprsing matter).  At the end credit you will find many names familiar to French film fans -- Tcheky Karyo, Jean-Claude Dreyfuss, Dominique Pinon, and ... but making a list may be pointless after all.

For the star of the film is Audrey Tautou as Matilde.  Every audience will fall for her, and be impressed with her strong acting as the independent heroine.  Though the film looks awfully whimsical at times with so many characters and incidents, she remains the pivotical presence all through the  film.

The original novel is written by veteran Sebastian Japrisot, who died one year before the film was completed.  (Many of his books had been filmed, 'Rider on the Rain' for example.)  As they compressed so many things in the original into 130 minute film, 'A Very Long Engagement' suffers from very confusing relations between so many characters.  In book, we can stop and think; in film, well, you can stop your DVD player, but I'D rather not.  Let the film keep on telling its story, and enjoy the world of Jeunet's visual genius.  You never get bored with the strikingly original images he presents.",1112054400,6,3113,4.8726235741444865
2253808,4,B0007Z0NYQ,"There are a handful of directors who create films that are always interesting and I eagerly anticipate the release of their films, flocking to the theater on opening weekend. I know that even if Clint Eastwood, Terry Zwigoff, Patrice Laconte, Peter Greenaway and others, park an actor in front of the camera reading the phone book, (I'm looking at you, Greenaway. ""8  Women""? What were you thinking?), these bad films will have some element that is interesting and help them rise above the rest of the pack. I count on these directors to lift my spirits and prove to me that film can still be an art form.

Jean- Pierre Jeunet, a member of this club, creates films jam packed with unique, interesting visual details. This level of enhancement in his films helps create the fantasy worlds that are the setting to his films, to such a degree that you never doubt their existence. The addition of memorable, believable characters and an interesting story helps raise his films to a level not achieved by many other directors.

""A Very Long Engagement"", his follow up to ""Amelie"", one of my favorite films of all time, also stars Audrey Tautou. However, the similarities pretty much end there.

Manech (Gaspard Ulliel) is one of five French soldiers sentenced to death for self-mutilation during World War I. For their sentence, they are taken to the front line, a place called Bingo Crepuscule. The orders are to send them over the front line and let the Germans, the freezing cold, starvation, or a combination take care of them. Mathilde (Tautou), Manech's lover, learns of all of this later. She is told that Manech was killed, but doesn't, can't, believe it. Searching for Manech, she leaves her aunt and uncle's idyllic seaside farmhouse, for the journey. She will meet anyone and follow any lead that might prove to her that Manech is still alive.

""Engagement"" is a beautiful film to watch. This may seem strange, given that a third of the film takes places during the first world war. As Mathilde makes her way along the journey, Jeunet crafts a picture perfect rendition of early 20th Century France. The country scenes are idyllic, and would seem to be easier to craft, but they blend seemlessly with the sepia-toned images of Paris. A scene set in a busy marketplace in Paris was obviously created with the aid of CGI, not because it is faulty in any way, but because it is so perfect and expansive. The scenes set on the front lines are equally memorable for their quick, incisive images that convey the horrors of war.

Jeunet tries to recreate many film conventions from the Silent film era. He uses an iris camera movement a few times, paints the images in sepia tones and more. These `ticks', for lack of a better word, actually aid in the recreation of this world. They help us forget that we are watching a film made last year. Perhaps it was actually made during the silent era, or the early days of talkies. Perhaps they actually filmed in that crowded marketplace in the middle of Paris. Was that a real locomotive? A real bi-plane?

The film should also be applauded for it's restraint with music. Many scenes have no musical score, allowing the viewer to experience and feel emotions that you experience. The music doesn't broadcast the emotions the filmmaker expects you to feel. This further aids in a moving and genuine experience.

Audrey Tautou became a sensation in France and well-known here for her role in ""Amelie"", a role so infectious and lovable. In ""Engagement"", the laughter is almost wholly replaced by drama and she is very memorable as Mathilde. Mathilde is on a quest. Her life's love has been pronounced dead, but she doesn't believe it. Tautou conveys the love her character feels which makes us believe in her quest.

All of the actors, and there are many, create characters that are believable and add to the fabric of the story. Also, each of these characters has a unique backstory, which we learn about, during the course of the film. Even Jodie Foster, who plays a supporting character, makes you forget that you are watching American Film Star Jodie Foster.

Every single element of Jeunet's films is crafted with such detail that you often forget you are watching a film and get swept up in the story he is telling. Isn't that the mark of a great filmmaker?",1110931200,19,4305,4.735647530040054
2253809,4,B0007Z0NYQ,"Unfortunately I saw this film in its original French with Icelandic subtitles at the French film festival here in Reykjavik, and though my French and Icelandic are both passable, the film had so many characters and a great deal of important visual stimulation/scenery (integral to the story) that it was difficult to concentrate on all the various forms of media bombarding the senses all at once. All the men in World War I uniforms looked virtually indistinguable apart from the obvious age difference between young soldiers and older soldiers. Then, the characters as introduced in the beginning were difficult to recognize outside of their uniforms. All of these characters and their stories are important because they act as clues and pieces of information in the investigation that ensues through the entire film.

Despite the linguistics handicap and my inability to concentrate, this film was still moving on several levels. Audrey Tautou portrays Mathilde, a resolute young woman who refuses to give up hope that her fianc, Manech, has truly died. She wants answers, using whatever means necessary. Manech is presumed dead, but various clues point to the fact that he is still alive (or at least that there is no conclusive proof that he perished). He has been officially declared dead, but Mathilde's connection to him is so strong that she refuses to believe or accept his death and seeks the truth. As she searches and meets others who have some connection to her Manech, scenes are shown in flashback form, both to illustrate the history and depth of her relationship to Manech and to show various characters' recollections of Manech or of the war. The acting here was superb-Tautou has never been one of my favorites, but she gave her role a certain level of conviction and was therefore quite convincing. Also surprising was the appearance of Jodie Foster in a brief role; her facility with the French language assured an effortless blending in with otherwise native French cast members. This was a beautiful and compelling story I do plan to see again to absorb all the details and subtleties I missed the first time.",1109635200,3,2133,4.991573033707865

It's an incredible film, for its content, its director, its script, its leading actress (and, for that matter, all of the other actors in actresses as well:  they're uniformly excellent), as well as it's general design.  But above all of that, it's a movie that can't be described but has to be seen because it's about everything.  It's a war movie, a love movie, a crime movie, a naturalistic movie, a surreal movie, a movie partaking of gross sentimentality and hideous realism--and be forewarned:  some of the scenes in it made even me wince and flinch--a movie about human evil and human kindness both...much more the latter than the former.  Notwithstanding all of that, it has to be seen or else you will be slightly the less for not having seen it.  Mathilde's Quest is that overwhelming.  And she's just so loveable, watching her search for the truth, raising the dead from the grave.",1109548800,2,1097,4.677083333333333
2253811,4,B0007Z0NYQ,"A Very Long Engagement was indeed a long drawn out film that was directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, and based on the acclaimed novel by Sebastien Japrisot. Jeunet is known for his so-called lush theatrical presentations(Amelie and City of Lost Children.  Engagement is also lush and very graphic when it came to the gruesome WWI scenes and the French countryside.  Besides the landscape of the film, like all period films, what is a war film without a love story?  The core of the film rested on the untireless narrative of a dear lover waiting for her fiance to return from the war -- the romance between childhood sweethearts, Mathilde (Audrey Tautou) and Manech (Gaspard Ulliel).  The story begins rather jagged and fragmented, but slowly evolves despite the ups and downs of the story line that involves Mathilde's growing weariness and search for her lover, which eventually resolves within the climax of the film.

Once again, this is one of those films that is threefold.  First, you have the plotline about Matilde and Manech, second, WWI and its depiction as a mechanized war that Jeunet wants to suggests that there's something more intricate, political and psychological as it pertained to the France's recollection of war and memory. And third, there's a little film noir added with one woman, who's name I cannot recall, who goes out like a martyr, along the same lines as Joan of Arc.  It is this aspect of the film that offers the somewhat confusing plotline because you have to keep track of each character's stories.

Nevertheless, A Very Long Engagement is a thought provoking film with its melodramatic scenes as well as its comic relief.  The ending is unpredictable and leaves the film dangling for one more minute, and leaves the audience thinking, is that it? It is one of those unusual foreign films that can be viewed over and over again in order to understand the gist of the plot, and it is highly recommended.",1109548800,2,1934,4.854103343465046
2253812,4,B0007Z0NYQ,"The previews of this movie presented images that promised an enduring love story set against the backdrop of WWI. What Jean-Pierre Jeunet's follow-up to ""Amelie"" really is, however, is a whodunit, a jigsaw puzzle of a mystery that starts slowly in a fragmented recollection of seemingly unrelated events and gradually through the introduction of new characters, becomes a story of unrelenting commitment. That it is driven by a seemingly nave love story seems almost incidental to what the director seems intent to present here, an epic inspired not only by Stanley Kubrick's 1957 antiwar classic about a WWI suicide mission, ""Paths of Glory"" (strongly recommended), but also Edward Zwick's 1996 ""Courage Under Fire"" and to some degree, Akira Kurosawa's 1950 classic, ""Rashomon"" (also strongly recommended).

The film is successful in evoking memories of these other films and at the same time, bears the unmistakable stamp of Jeunet's now-recognizable visual invention. Whereas his filmmaking style befits the optimism and quirkiness of ""Amelie"", it surprisingly feeds very well into this much darker tale. The most memorable example is an extended scene, which takes place in a field hospital crowded with wounded soldiers and housing a huge, hydrogen-filled zeppelin. An undetonated shell is lodged in the ceiling as the zeppelin unexpectedly lets loose from its tether. The contact of these objects is inevitable, but Jeunet films it in such a stylized chain of events that I was impressed with his flair as much as I was dreading the outcome. Jeunet invests a lot of effort capturing the bleakness and sheer brutality of war, including a plethora of mutilations that made me wince, but again his visual sense does not allow it to reach the gut level of the opening scenes of Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"".  Rather, they become part of this intimate world he is building to facilitate his storytelling, which in itself is stylized by its very unfolding. The technique can be frustrating at first since so many bits of information are thrown at the viewer without much context until it all weaves together into a singular strand that moves toward the ending.

Audrey Tautou, who seems to be turning into Dietrich to Jeunet's von Sternberg, downplays the charm she displayed in ""Amelie"" for a more sullen performance as Mathilde, a woman handicapped by childhood polio but relentless in her search for Manech, her fianc and lifelong love. I wish there were more scenes of their blooming relationship, as I think that is the one imbalance in the film that could have drawn me closer to her character. So much is assumed of our empathy for her plight, but frankly she comes across as a bit too monomaniacal at times. With the intensity of the romance missing, Manech, as played with appropriate vacuity by Gaspard Ulliel, comes across as something of a cipher despite what is obviously his undying love for her. The four other men who were court-martialed with Manech on the front lines for self-mutilation are all revealed in their own stories. A serial-killing prostitute brings an unusually exotic, Mata Hari aspect to more than one of the stories, but that is not the only plot twist. Prominent in one of the other stories is none other than Jodie Foster, speaking what sounds like impeccable French, as a put-upon housewife who in an effort to save her husband, gets mired in an unfortunate love triangle. Foster gives a fine, small performance, but her recognizable appearance and Yankee appeal cut into the realism of the story at an important juncture.

Fortunately the film is a feast for the eyes throughout. Thanks to Bruno Debonnel's expert cinematography, the film contains desaturated hues that produce an almost brown-and-white look that recalls an old, graying photograph. I think the film could have been trimmed from its 2 -hour running time, but it doesn't feel much time has been wasted in getting to the hopeful conclusion. Definitely worth seeing for Jeunet's individualistic filmmaking panache.",1109030400,4,4028,5.098484848484849
2253823,4,B0007Z0NYQ,"A spectacular film of love and war created by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, A Very Long Engagement captures love in the midst of a hurtful place called World War I.  It takes us to a tour of the French army frontlines in the heated years of the war, as well as a rural French province after it.

It's refreshing to watch Audrey Tautou in performance of a more mature role.  She was wowed with the little childish girl image she left in Amelie, but she has come back with the promise of proving how relentlessly devoted she can be as a lover.  She indeed protrayed such a loving fiance in this movie.

Gaspard Ulliel, on the other hand, is one hot pick.  Now where were we when he was making the french showbiz headlines?  Fantasizing over Brad Pitt or Heath Ledger.  Sadly i was born in 1981 while he in 1984.  He gave a fair performance in this movie, not necessarily golden globe material, but good enough for MTV's Moonman.

The movie was a chore to watch in the beginning because, as it was a story of a very long engagement, it was a story of five unfortunate french soldiers.  It was told in flashbacks that somehow gets viewers confused.  Who's prisoner # 11115?  What happened to the other prisoner?  Now whose girlfriend is that?  And whose wife is that?  These questions can go on and on because of a slight information overload in the introduction, but will somehow be answered in the proceeding chapters as the story progresses.  The other four prisoners start being their own characters, and their family and friends soon develop into important names in the story.

Whilst the cinematography is achingly beautiful (every and each frames are aesthetically spectacular), the very essence of the movie itself was a main drag.  The basic premise was everyone told her that her man was dead and that she ought to move on with her life.  Stubbornly, she held on to the very ONE thing that she knew best, that is, she loved him and she wouldn't give up until there was a concrete evidence that he was dead for real.  As a result, she led the investigation by procuring service of an investigator, entrusting her lawyer, aided by her uncle and auntie, chance encounter with stranger.  As a feel good movie, as we expected a happy ending.  Anyhow, the plots were Don Quixote at best, too much voice over as if we were told of a story in kindergarten, and it seemed to drag on and on.  Audrey, perhaps were miscast in this movie as her angelic face somehow mistyped her as simply Amelie, the sweet innocent girl that was looking for her first love.  Perhaps, the team tried to repeat the formula of Amelie onto this movie.  Personally, I feel that the intimate essence of the movie isn't suitable for the epic genre.  Jodie Foster was a pleasant surprise.  Her cameo character added weight and credibility to the movie somewhat.  Overall, a half boil movie that deserves better.

2253826,4,B0007Z0NYQ,"Jean-Pierre Jeunet's A Very Long Engagement combined two major elements, romance and war to create this movie about a great quest. Audrey Tautou playing Mathilde plays the great quester determined to find her lost fiancee, Gaspard Ulliel playing Manech who was supposingly killed in the no-man land during the First World War. Three years later, despite of all odds against her, Mathilde keep on hoping and questing, basically moving forward thanks to her superstitious train of thought of that keep her hopes alive.

Its not every day you find a movie where romance and war find a near perfect mix. The gritty trench warfare scenes were seen as a flashbacks as Mathilde slowly uncovered the story behind her fiancee's supposingly death.

The movie also worked well as a detective story as well and funny to say this but the movie get better as it moves on, as truth and deception uncovered itself, the story moves faster. The moves is well crafted, nicely written and well acted. The camera work is superb and I admired the way it adjust and adapt as the movie goes from hell of World War I trench warfare to bright sunny days of peace.

Audrey Tautou who regretfully will forever be assoicated with her movie ""Amelie"", does an excellent job and she was well supported by her supporting cast. French-speaking Jodie Foster is also in this movie with a small role. Gaspard Ulliel who played the fiancee does a good role, portarying almost naive innocent to his young role.

Overall, it proves to be a pretty good movie, the two and half hours or so length proves to be not a problem as the story unfold with a rapid speed once it catches on fire. Of course, everything in French so you have to read the subtitles which I thought was clear and got the spirit of the spoken words. The interesting mixture of war and lost romantic love created an story of quest by a woman who only listen to what her feeling tell her.",1106524800,2,1914,4.620588235294117
2253827,4,B0007Z0NYQ,"Nigel Andrews, stellar reviewer for the Financial Times, asked his readers yesterday (Jan 20, 2005) to imagine Jean-Pierre Jeunet's ""A Very Long Engagement"" as a combination of Corelli's Mandolin, Random Harvest and The Count of Monte Cristo.  [Let's hope he was was referring to Corelli the book, and the not the dreadful screen adaptation.]  Funnily enough, I was also touting 'Engagement' to friends as a similar hybird: except I went with ""Amelie"" meets ""Saving Private Ryan.""

You're right: that sounds completely implausible, but it works in the hands of master director Jeunet, whose unique Amelie-flecked stylings distance 'Engagement' from the pack of just being 'another film about war.'  The resemblance to 'Ryan' comes in its graphic, unrelenting depiction of the violence of battle and the utter despondency of war's combatants.  There's some truly great filmmaking here.

On the Tautou scale, 'Engagement' ranks well above 'Happenstance,' 'Venus Beauty Institute' and 'God Is Great, I'm Not,' and somewhat below 'He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not.'  'Amelie' is beyond category (Tautou will go to her grave as Amelie).  'Dirty Pretty Things' can't be compared to these because it's Tautou's first swing at an English-speaking role.

Speaking of languages, for US-based viewers, it's a special treat to watch Jodie Foster emote extremely well (I assume) in French, replete with the film's steamiest scenes.  There's a wonderful scene played by Foster and on-screen lover (all too briefly) J&eacute;rme Kircher in which he says he 'loves her parentheses'...at which point a smile breaks out on her face and, sure enough, her mouth is surrounded by a perfect set of enclosures that he caresses.  Jean-Pierre Jeunet's films are filled with moments like these.",1106265600,12,1764,5.332129963898917
2253828,5,B0007Z0NYQ,"Yes, it is confusing with the bombardment of characters that are splattered here and there throughout the entire movie but it isn't very difficult to follow after a while.  They do plenty of flashbacks from different angles of the same event that one will become familiar with each character although not quite remembering their names.  If as any movie lover, one will pick up little clues to keep focused on whom is whom.  Such as when Mathilde first meets the bartender with the wooden hand she comes home and recounts the names, the people who built the wooden hand, which happens to be one of the five soldiers sent to expected death at no man's land that faithful day, over and over.  It is an epic saga of the young girl's journey to finding out the truth-the truth of whether or not she is holding onto hope that may become realized or just blind baseless hope of something that could never be.

This movie is a reunion of the director and his leading actress Audrey Tautou.  The two worked together on the movie Amelie.  If one looks back to Amelie there are plenty traces of the dark side of the director's vision and it is certainly explored and realized in A Very Long Engagment.  The trench warfare of WWI is truly stunning and disgusting as that war was.  The tuba becomes her distress call not just an idiosyncracy of hers and each time she plays it it becomes more familiar to us.  Familiar because undoubtedly every one of us has a habit to unwind after stressful situations and playing the tuba as a ship's distress call happens to be hers.

I rather like to compare the director Jean-Pierre Jeunet as the modern day Hitchcock.  With each movie the style, vision, and themes that possess each director becomes more and more pronounced.  Jeunet pays attention to every detail-the look, the feel of his film, sex, romance, whimisical habits/details (such as the albatross in AVLE and the goldfish in Amelie, certain personalities that inhabit each movie of his.  ETC...

Basically the film is about Mathile holding onto hope that her childhood sweetheart, her fiance, is still alive and did not die on no man's land condemned.  It is three years after 1917 when he was supposed to have died and she still holds onto hope.  One reviewer complained that there were slight background(flashbacks) as to their love before the war but really if the girl after 3yrs still holds onto hope, and she is a sensible girl even though whimisical, then doesn't that explain all?  Manech (her fiance) was condemned for trying to get back home to her.  Anyway, as the movie progresses it is still important that she finds that her hope is realized but even if she does find that her fiance is dead, it becomes more important that she is able to find out the entire complete truth of what happened to the five men that were condemned that faithful day to die on no-man's land including Manech.  Although, as the audience, one would rather hope that she finds her fiance alive and well somewhere.  But, more than a love story it is a story of will and tenecity that one person could have to seek out something-a story, an event (what have you)  that could have just layed somewhere as a bunch of yellowing papers in an archive storage.

This movie is over two hours but it is worthwhile and does not compromise on the story.  Even the ending has a bit of a dark undertone to it.  Let's just put it this way if you keep coming back to A Very Long Engagment, hesitant on whether or not to see it, just please watch it.  MOre than most likely you will enjoy the movie perhaps grumble slightly about the length perhaps lose track of the many characters at first but if you can read the subtitles it must mean you are working your brain while watching the movie so surely a few characters here and there will not make you lose your temper about devoting two hours to this enchanting film.",1106179200,,3879,4.553314121037464
2253829,5,B0007Z0NYQ,"My understanding is that France has declined to submit A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT for Oscar consideration as 2004's Best Foreign Film. I can't imagine why.

War is not glorious. Especially if you're Manech (Gaspard Ulliel), a young French soldier convicted by a military court, along with four others, of committing self-mutilation with the intent of escaping service in the front lines of World War I. The punishment is grotesque. Rather than death by firing squad, the five are forced over the top of the most forward trench and into the No Man's Land between the French and German positions - there to die by whatever bullet, mortar shell, or bomb strikes them down. The subsequent deaths of all five are attested to. Letters are sent to surviving family members by the French authorities saying their boys died in battle. This was in 1917.

Mathilde (Audrey Tatou) was Manech's fiance when he marched off to war. She's also crippled in one leg after having been afflicted with polio at a very young age. In 1920, she's contacted by a dying survivor of the war, ex-Sergeant Esperanza (Jean-Pierre Becker), who'd been in charge of the provost detail assigned to escort the five condemned men to the front trench, as well as act as carrier of the last missive each was permitted to write home. He tells Mathilde of their bizarre fate, and gives her their last letters, which he's kept since the war's end. Using these and the veteran's story to provide clues, Mathilde embarks on a lengthy search for the truth behind Manech's death with the help of a private investigator (Ticky Holgado). Interviewing friends, family members, and lovers of Marech's four condemned companions, as well as other soldiers present in the trench, Mathilde needs to answer the question, ""Is Manech truly dead?"" She has no doubts; he's alive. But, the evidence is elusive and inconsistent.

As crafted by director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT is a hypnotic tale of mystery, official cover-ups, lies, misperceptions, secrets, coincidence, tenuous clues, guilt, innocence, honor, and, ultimately, love. Jeunet has created a masterpiece of special FX, lighting, unusual camera angles, split screen images, breathtaking panoramas, and visual asides. And then there are the entrancing depths of Audrey Tatou's brown eyes, in which I could happily lose myself forever. There's not been the likes of this young actress since Audrey Hepburn.

Though not advertised as such, this film is a gut wrenching depiction of World War I trench warfare. It's perhaps the best I've ever seen, especially when shown in contrast to gentle Mathilde's quest through post-war Paris and the luminous French countryside.

Astute and sardonic Mathilde, perhaps because of her affliction, is a take-no-prisoners dynamo of perseverance. No obstacle is too great that it can't be overcome. In the end, she finds ... Truth. And, if you see A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT, you'll experience amazement, delight, and tears. For me, it's 2004's Best Foreign Film no matter what the Academy votes.",1105920000,297,3042,5.100401606425703
2253830,3,B0007Z0NYQ,"A French woman seeks out her fiancee who supposedly has been killed in World War I.  But is he really dead?

It takes a long time to find out. I went into this movie on Tuesday and it seemed like Thursday before I got out.  It's only 2 hours and 14 minutes, but it seemed much longer.  It has as many characters as a Tolstoy novel and as many twists as a croissant.

The good points of the movie are the stunning photography, the comic tidbits, and several well drawn characters.  The bad part is that you need a program to keep track of who's who and you're so tired and confused by the end you really don't care much.  This is a movie with wretched excess of plot, character, incident, and scene.  If I chose -- and I won't choose -- to see the movie four or five times I might figure it out.

2253831,4,B0007Z0NYQ,"Yes, I said, ""lush"". This movie visually encompasses the colors found in our most beautiful dreams and yet is in many aspects reflective in it's depiction of WWI through the eyes of the French. It is an epic tale of romantic hope during WWI that follows the investigative journey of a young woman named Mathilde played by Audrey Tatou (Amelie, Dirty Pretty Things) who is trying to find out what has happened to her lover.

Several plots are played out through out Mathildes' search. At first you blindly follow the scenes and then slowly the stories become knitted together as you discover along with Mathilde the truth her loves circumstance. I enjoyed the interweaving of the story and the wonderful directing that held this movie together so well by director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Amelie, Alien Resurrection).

Most of all, I loved the cinematography. Thank you, Bruno Delbonnel! Mr. Delbonnel (The Cat's Meow, Amelie) created the visually lush colors in this film with his wonderful talent in the art of cinematoghraphy. This film is lush and beautiful with it's fabulous color in the country scenes to it dramatic sephia effect during the war scenes. Together with Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Mr. Delbonnel has created a wonderful film and piece of art.

Finally, I'd like to mention the supporting actors associated with this film: Jodie Foster, Julie Depardieu, Marion Cotillard, Gaspard Ulliel, Tcheky Karyo, and Clovis Cornillac. This is a wonderful french film with depth, beauty, hope, and like all the French films I've seen a quirky sense of humor that enhances the wonderful art of life.

2253832,4,B0007Z0NYQ,"""A Very Long Engagement"" opens in the midst of muddy, bloody trench warfare during World War I, where five French soldiers have been convicted of wounding themselves to get off the front lines.

Though they avoid a firing squad, the men are marched unarmed into the no man's land between their own line and that of the German army; it is a smoking, bombed-out landscape cluttered with barbed-wire, mustard gas, machine-gun fire and mortar shells, and the men's fates are apparently sealed.

One of the soldiers, however, is Manech (Gaspard Ulliel), a young dude with the extremely good fortune to be the fiance of Mathilda (Audrey Tautou) - good fortune not just because she looks like a healthier Audrey Hepburn, but also because she's convinced her man is still alive and is determined to track him down and bring him home.

The mystery of what happened to Manech takes some unraveling, however, and eventually involves secret codes, hidden cellars, assassinations and a murderous woman who acts as if she might be Mathilda's evil twin.

""Engagement"" is based on a novel by Sebastien Japrisot, but it's very much the product of director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, whose visually stunning films feel a bit like large, shiny cuckoo clocks. His previous effort was the sunny ""Amelie"" (which also had Tautou as its superhumanly resourceful heroine), and ""Engagement"" has some of that film's whimsy. This time, however, Jeunet's fable is tempered with the graphic violence and lurking dread of combat.

Some viewers may wish they had a program to keep track of the movie's complex web of characters and flashbacks, but even those who lose some of the threads will be satisfied, not just by the resolution but also by the sight of this sprawling, eye-popping epic.  See it on a big screen if you can.",1105747200,4,1789,4.926910299003322

8054416,4,B0007Z0NYQ,"It had been a long time since I last watched this film, but one of my suitemates enjoys French film and wanted to see it after I described the plot to her. However, I didn't really remember much else beyond that. Jean-Pierre Jeunet makes rather quirky films, and A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT is no exception. There is a sense that the world he depicts could exist, and it helps that the story has an actual historical setting, but there will always be a few things that seem off-kilter or just a little weird. Weirdness done or its own sake can be off-putting, but I feel like there was a good amount here that helped to round out what were very endearing characters. In general, there was a sweetness that provided excellent counterpoint to the horrors of war that are periodically depicted. Of course, the story itself is a large part of this. Audrey Tautou's character goes on a mission to find her fianc who went missing during the war. She never gives up hope that he might still be alive, even when things don't look they will turn out ok. A lot of French films (at least the well-known ones) are known for being downbeat and/or having depressing endings. I liked that this film is more positive and hope-filled. The only mild gripe I have is that it might take a little too long to get to the eventual destination. Not quite patience-testing, but surely the script could have been tightened a little bit. Still, this was a wonderful story told with great performances and a generous helping of visual panache.
