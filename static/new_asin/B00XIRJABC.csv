8716011,5,B00XIRJABC,"Advanced enough to be a great workout, not so advanced a beginner couldn't do it. (I'm near beginner.) Sarah's voice is soothing, the instruction she gives is good, and I enjoy her affirmations and gentle encouragements. And the background is Marvelous. Once I get the hang of a yoga dvd I really don't ""watch"" it that much, just sort of listen and glance up/over, but the setting for this dvd is glorious to glance up to, and the sound of the stream and the birds is deeply soothing. Sometimes I actually play it just to watch, like a nature dvd (that just happens to have someone teaching yoga). Seriously. So, I suppose, this serves multiple purposes for me. : ) Overall, practicing with this dvd gets out the kinks, is helping make me stronger, and leaves me feeling both deeply relaxed and calmly invigorated. This ""Happy Yoga"" dvd really does make me happy, body, mind, spirit!
PS For anyone who is an complete beginner or who has any health issues, I'd recommend using any of her ""chair yoga"" dvd's first. I started off with a few of those, and they're Excellent, as well. : )",1461456000,6,1083,4.558974358974359
