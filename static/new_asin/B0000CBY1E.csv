1918080,5,B0000CBY1E,"I purchased this set for my 18 month old and she absolutely loves it.  The dancing and singing and Barney, his friends and other children keep her captivated.  We also purchased Elmo's World, Babies, Dogs and More plus The Book of Pooh, which she did not enjoy.  Barney is definitively the winner.  Maybe as she gets older she'll like the other DVDs but now Barney is her favorite.  We also have a 10 DVDs collection of the Muppet Show, which she stays tuned to only briefly.
Thanks.",1078444800,11,483,4.505747126436781
1918081,3,B0000CBY1E,"Barney is always great and a big hit with my daughter. However, I would not recommend this particular DVD, if you buy DVD's due to the many wonderful features, such as playing just the songs, skipping adverts and going directly to certain chapters. This DVD has none of these features, so you may as well buy the VHS version. It has some wonderful songs, and is fairly entertaining, however, I would not buy it again, and now make sure that the DVD's I purchase allow us to play just the songs, or select certain chapters. Usually my 17 month old gets bored with the dialogue and wants only to see the songs. If they revamped the DVD, it would probably get 5 stars.",1066089600,8,665,4.414634146341464
1918082,3,B0000CBY1E,"It took a while for my 2.5 yr old to like this DVD. It's more educational for slightly older kids than some of Barney's other works which are simple & musical.  There are several familiar songs but the basic concept for this DVD is ""methods of transportation"". Colours are vividly portrayed as well as graphics which is nice to see. Either way your child may like this. Worth a try!",1034812800,7,382,4.457142857142857

7998757,5,B0000CBY1E,"My 4 year old grandaughter wanted the round and round we go dvd, when I found the set, I knew she'd enjoy the zoo one too.  These two entertain her and her 2 year old sister for hours!!  Thanks Barney!!",1251676800,,202,4.025
7998758,1,B0000CBY1E,"Yes, like others have already said, my kids love Barney.  To be honest, I've enjoyed watching previous Barney DVD's myself as the songs are catchy and fun and I think generally there are some good things in there for kids.  But I have to say that I am extremely disappointed with this DVD.  I guess the producers thought it would be cute to take away the ability to do anything but play the DVD.  Any attempt to fast forward or skip simply starts the DVD back at the beginning, effectively forcing you to sit through all of the previews and advertisements in order to get to the actual Barney episode.  IMO, this is bordering on arrogance.  Well, so sorry to the producers of Barney, but you don't decide what I watch.  And you certainly don't decide what my kids will watch.  I'll not have you shoving your advertising down my throat or theirs.  This will be the last Barney DVD you ever sell to my family.

Sincerely,

Your former customer.

BTW, Nice marketing strategy!",1166745600,5,973,4.528735632183908
7998759,5,B0000CBY1E,I bought these for my daughter for our 12 hour drive down to FL for vacation and she loved them both she loves the animals in the Let's Go to the Zoo (although when BJ trys to take pictures they make the film go fuzzy and then focus and watching that in the car was making me a little motion sick) and she enjoyed the Round and Round we go because of the songs.  A good deal all around!,1126483200,5,386,3.8860759493670884
7998760,5,B0000CBY1E,Excellent introduction for young children to experience many different animals,1124150400,3,78,6.9
7998761,3,B0000CBY1E,"I'd give ""Let's Go to the Zoo"" 5 stars. My 20 month old LOVES it!! It's really a great video (and he normally doesn't like TV at all -- and I personally don't normally like Barney).

However, the other video, ""Round and Round We Go,"" has an older man in it that scares my son to death. He can't get past the intro, for fear that the man will come onto the screen soon. Maybe he'll grow out of it, but he may grow out of Barney by then, too...

I should have just bought the zoo video instead of the bargain 2-pack that included the video with the weird-looking man.",1123372800,5,565,4.081081081081081
7998762,5,B0000CBY1E,back in the dayz the survivors and me used to say barney is corny and i hate barney but now when i think of it the barney days were the good times because it reminds me of when we were survivors and they weren't hypocritical. so this gets 5 stars,1114560000,2,246,3.94
7998763,3,B0000CBY1E,"My 18 month old doesnt sit through these, They gets 3 stars only because it is Barney and she just LOVES Barney.

Lets go to the Zoo is much better than Round and Round we go. The Animals get her attention. However, it is defective. The sound goes off and the DVD skips/jumps.

I cant even return them because I live in Hong Kong (had it delivered to a US address while my husband was visiting back home) it isn't worth the cost of mailing it back to Amazon.",1099094400,4,458,4.134831460674158
