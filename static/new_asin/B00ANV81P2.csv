5461654,4,B00ANV81P2,"Obviously, this Cartoon Network show is meant for kids, but I found a lot to enjoy, myself. Orange can certainly be annoying, but I think the show does a good job of taking him to ""the line"", and then pulling it back. Not that he lived up to his name every episode, but the odd time when he did, it was tolerable.  Toby Turner's ""Nerville"" is the only human character, and he does the comedy a little broad-- but I really do admire his commitment to the part. It isn't easy acting alone on a green screen, but he did a good job. And I could tell from some of the bonus material as well as some of the credit sequences that he's got a knack for improv with some of the alternate lines he was coming up with.

 The standout character for me has to be Marshmallow; I just loved his high-pitched voice (thankfully, not overdone) hollering ""Yaaay!"" one second, and then being fatalistic another. I wish I could remember a specific line, but it would usually go something like, ""Yaaaay! I like to watch things burn!""

 I found many of the jokes to be rather witty, and I liked how the plots were all over the place from episode to episode. They'd do a little bit on the Revolutionary War in one episode, then a riff on Star Trek in another; from a road trip to a vineyard, then holding off an invasion of vegetables.  If you don't like one episode, they're only about ten minutes long, and there's good odds you'll enjoy the next one.

 My nine-year-old just loves the Annoying Orange You Tube series, so he and I knocked-out this DVD set with all 30 episodes in about a week.  The total run time on the 4 discs is 339 minutes, so they obviously didn't utilize the full capacity of DVD. But I am going to assume the first three discs with episodes are the same discs previously released singly. The fourth disc with bonus features is pretty light; maybe a half hour of content.",1370822400,5,1871,4.33810888252149
5461655,1,B00ANV81P2,"This is what's ruining Cartoon Network! Remember all the good shows? Ed, Edd, n Eddy? What about Foster's, Samari Jack, Cow and Chicken, Powerpuff Girls, and Johnny Bravo? Cartoon Network is now showing this horrible excuse for a cartoon.

Youtube is the death of TV, with the Fred show being a total failure they decided to bring Annoying Orange to TV. All this show is filled with annoying gags, stupid plots, and horrible, horrible actings. I'm sorry, but this show is just plain horrible.",1370044800,3,492,4.857142857142857
5461656,1,B00ANV81P2,"This show is one of the worst shows on Cartoon Network, even worse than Adventure Time and Regular Show. It's jokes are idiotic, the animation is terrible, and the characters certainly live up the the shows title. It baffles me that Cartoon Network keeps shows like this around while they cancel shows like Young Justice or Green Lantern. I would recommend those shows long before I would recommend this one.",1369699200,2,408,4.8428571428571425

8554918,2,B00ANV81P2,"I couldn't determine any age group that this video would be appropriate viewing for. It glorified inappropriate, selfish, cruel, insensitive manipulative, rude, bullying behaviors towards strangers, friends and enemies. It was also very loud and caustic in tone. It was also insipidly, and inherently stupid. In fairness I did not watch all of the videos. My IQ had already dropped ten points with what I did view. Even the child that had requested I get the video stopped watching it because Orange was mean. This video lived up to it's name, ""Annoying.""",1413676800,,555,5.043478260869565
8554919,1,B00ANV81P2,"As if the webisodes weren't bad enough, now Orange has his own TV SHOW?! I hate this show and I hate everything about this show. Orange would be much better if he were just a little annoying, but he is WAY too annoying here! Everything that comes out of his mouth makes me want to jump into a vat of toxic waste. The other characters are annoying, too! That scientist guy [I don't wanna say his name] is a complete spaz! That marshmallow's voice gives me a headache! Everybody!

The plots for every episode are uncreative, too. Just about every episode is a dumb parody of something. If you ask me, the episode ""Fruitloose"" sounds more like ""Fruit Loops"" than ""Footloose."" ""Fruitpendence Day"" is a parody of ""Independence Day,"" which is probably the dumbest thing I've ever heard. But worst of all... here it comes... there are actually MUSIC NUMBERS in the show! After hearing Marshmallow sing I almost literally had suicidal thoughts. Even some of the bad guys had music numbers! The combination of CG and live-action is supposed to sound clever and artistic, but it just looks really stupid.

Instead of ""Nya nya nya nya nya,"" how about ""no no no no no?"" EVERY EPISODE SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS PUT TOGETHER AT THE LAST MINUTE! Go put it on if you want to torture someone. They will wind up in the insane asylum, I'm tellin' you.",1404950400,,1325,4.563025210084033
8554920,5,B00ANV81P2,My son loves the DVD. He mimics characters in the DVD. It is a joy to watch. I am happy with the purchase of this DVD. I would recommend for purchase in the future.,1394323200,,164,3.8529411764705883
8554921,5,B00ANV81P2,Kids love this show. We also like the bonus disk. I love that having an Amazon Prime membership allows free shipping and great prices. This show is wicked funny. My husband and I watch it long after the kids leave the room. Old people won't get it.,1391731200,2,248,4.297872340425532
8554922,5,B00ANV81P2,"While the setting of this series is a tad different from the webisodes, it's still an enjoyably random ride for any fan.",1386028800,,120,4.5
8554923,5,B00ANV81P2,"Orange isn't THAT annoying...only when he repeats himself.  his plays on words are quite amusing.

the thing i love the most are that each fruit's eyes are the same!  look closely and you'll see that the tear ducts are both on each fruits' right!

obviously not for everyone, but at least check out a couple episodes and decide for yourself.  nerville is a really good dancer.",1376611200,,376,4.636363636363637
