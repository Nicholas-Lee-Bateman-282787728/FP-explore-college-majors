8190046,3,B000PANXOA,"This is a fairly fast paced video, with a LOT of info regarding the subways/buses packed in to thirty minutes.
If you're unfamiliar with the NYC subway system and are using this as sort of a training/prep lesson, be sure to take notes!  The information is GREAT and very detailed, but can be dizzying (but it does kind of match the pace of the city).  You'll never be able to remember the difference between uptown vs downtown, express vs local, transfers vs north/south lines vs east/west lines (far fewer of the latter by the way).  Having been to the city countless times and, dare I say 'mastering' the system, I was able to follow along, but had I watched this before my first visit I'd have been shell-shocked!
Just don't worry about color; they don't matter.  Only worry with the line number or letter & you'll be fine.  Oh, and don't reference a line by color either when speaking to others (ie: i'm trying to get to the red 2 train); you'll immediately have a neon tourist sign appear over your head!!!!!!!  Reference the train you're looking for by number and/or letter and by uptown (Bronx-bound) or downtown (Brooklyn-bound).

All that said, this is a very informative & helpful video, and very well done.  Just be sure you take notes.  I would also HIGHLY suggest pulling up a subway map online & referencing that while you watch (and be ready to pause the video often!).  But doing this will help make sense of what the host/narrator is talking about and showing you.  Again, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND doing this!  That way when you get there & pick up a hard copy of the map much of what you're looking at will be much more familiar (and easier!).",1359763200,2,1655,4.554054054054054
8190047,3,B000PANXOA,Ok but not great...gave me some good tips but still confused about the NYC subway and its navigation.  It goes too quick and not enough details.  It would be nice if it were comprehensive,1198454400,,187,4.470588235294118
8190048,5,B000PANXOA,It provided an excellent guide of our visit of NY City. We used it to plan our visit and know how to best enjoy our vacation at The Big Apple.,1191110400,,142,3.7666666666666666
8190049,5,B000PANXOA,"Wow - do I wish I had this video before my first trip to NYC.  As a southern girl visiting the Big Apple, I was fearful of getting lost, or worse, ending up in a bad part of town. The NYC transit system is essential to get around the city - but also somewhat intimidating and confusing.  Ms. Storey is obviously a seasoned traveler and gives an excellent ""big picture"" view as well as details of the transit system.  Don't leave for NYC without it!",1182124800,,448,4.247058823529412
8190050,5,B000PANXOA,"Surprising how interesting a DVD guide for navigating the New York City transit system can be!  I was very impressed with the quality and relevance of information presented in this guide.  This is a must-see for anyone planning to travel in NYC and use mass transit -- which everyone should be considering if you are going to the Big Apple.  In fact, although I have tried my hand at navigating NYC using the subway before, I still learned a great deal more of helpful information from watching that I look forward to putting into practice soon.",1179619200,,545,4.65625
