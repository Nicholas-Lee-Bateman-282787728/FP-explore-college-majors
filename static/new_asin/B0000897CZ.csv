1831174,1,B0000897CZ,"I was completely disappointed with this box set.  The video and audio were terrible, the worst I have seen on DVD.  A complete waste of money.  Do not buy this set!  Beware of other Delta and Laserdisk productions!  I hope this helps others not waste their money!",1066089600,70,263,4.51063829787234
7980569,3,B0000897CZ,"Deceptive adverstising.  It says, ""The Lost Episodes Marathon."" These are the same episodes that have been released by countless budget labels on both VHS and DVD.  I didn't think it was possible, but, Delta Entertainment's release of ""The Lucy Show"" is even worse than Madacy.  The discs with five episodes aren't bad.  The episodes are complete.  ""Lucy Gets Jack Benny's Account"" is the full 25 minutes, as opposed to the 21 minute version most companies have.  As for the discs with only three episodes, the quality is pretty much abysmal.  The episodes are sloppily edited and the sound is muffled.  It sounds like everyone's talking through a tin can.  Still, it contains all 30 public domain episodes, but, I can't 100% recommend this one.",1444608000,,745,4.943548387096774
7980570,1,B0000897CZ,"Don't bother with the public domain episodes of ""The Lucy Show."" You're throwing away your money. The audio and video quality isn't very good. Buy the official season releases of ""The Lucy Show."" We already have seasons one through three out. Season four should be out sometime in March 2011. You won't believe the difference between the shabby quality of the public domain episodes and the unbelievable quality of the official releases. It's like they were filmed a month ago. In addition you get great bonus features. So stop buying the same 30 episodes. I was fooled twice and decided to wait for the real thing.",1292198400,,615,4.811320754716981
7980571,1,B0000897CZ,"This is Carol Butler's son writing this review.  My mom bought this ""collection"" for me at Best Buy when it first came out.  I believe it's out of print now, and if in fact it is, I wouldn't be surprised.  The quality is terrible.  The picture is scratchy and full of splices.  The audio is muffled, especially on the DVD's that have only three episodes each.  Only a few episodes are complete.  Those are the ones on the DVD's with five episodes.  There is at least five minutes cut from most of the episodes, and most of them aren't really that funny.  The best episode in the whole set is ""Lucy and Viv Put in a Shower"".  That's a classic.

Don't waste your money on this set.  Every other company that has released ""The Lucy Show"" has the same episodes and they are much better quality and cheaper.  However, your best bet would be to wait for the official season sets.  The Official First Season is out now and The Official Second Season is coming out in July.  Those sets have the complete episodes in pristine quality and many bonus features.  They're cheaper too.",1275523200,,1071,4.443298969072165
7980572,5,B0000897CZ,Not sure why everyone is k'vetching.  I've got the set and the picture and audio are perfect.  The shows are hilarious and if you're a Lucy fan you're going to love it.,1164412800,,168,4.21875
7980573,1,B0000897CZ,I bought these singly for $5.00 a piece from a bargain bin. They simply are unwatchable. Do not waste your money on these DVDs from Delta or Laserlight. They are complete garbage!,1159660800,17,179,4.625
7980574,1,B0000897CZ,"I am trying to find the series runs of the Danfield, CT days with Viv, Lucy, her kids, Cris and Jerry, and Viv's son.  I would love to have the Christmas episodes. PPPPPPLLLLLLLLLEEEEEAAASSSSSSSSSSSSEEEEEEEEE quit boxing the same old ones and calling it The Lucy Show.  I would love to have all of the seasons starting with the Danfield days to the California days, but in sequence!!!!!Also, I would love to have the whole Here's Lucy Seasons.",1146355200,18,443,4.815789473684211
7980575,1,B0000897CZ,"I bought this DVD collection and was very, very disappointed.  Not only because of the high price, but because the transfers are poor and the episodes are NOT intact.  There are several scenes missing in each episodes.  Any true Lucy fan knows this.  The choice of episodes here are also not the best.  One of the worst episodes ""Lucy the Fight Manager"" with Don Rickles (an annoying presence), has NOT ONE funny moment in the entire episode.  Save your money until the people in charge of putting out ""The Lucy Show"" decide to put it out season by season in a complete, remastered, decent quality product.",1124496000,27,606,4.669811320754717
7980576,3,B0000897CZ,"Anyone know if the episodes featuring Ethel Merman and Joan Crawford will ever make it to DVD? Have they already been released? If so, which set(s) do they appear?",1111017600,2,163,4.655172413793103
7980577,4,B0000897CZ,"This DVD is great! It isn't in perfect condition, but definitely viewable. Only don't pay what Amazon is asking for it! I got this set at Costco for only $19!",1096502400,7,158,4.3
