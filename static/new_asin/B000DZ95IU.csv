2475418,5,B000DZ95IU,"Threes company has always been one of my favorite tv shows. When i was growing up in the seventies. I always got a kick out of the show. The humor,and story lines.were brillant. I always felt the show was top notch. I have watched the show since day one. I have dvd seasons one thru five. I cannot wait to own the boxed set in two weeks...I thank you Stewart L.",1140739200,5,361,4.098591549295775
2475419,5,B000DZ95IU,"Priscilla Barnes joins the Three's Company cast as Terri Alden in this season six box set.  The chemistry between the roomates is rekindled with this character addition, and a unique zaniness becomes present in Apartment 201.  Janet Wood(Joyce Dewitt)evolves dramatically into a high-energy, loveable person, and classic Jack Tripper (John Ritter) carries off impressive and hysterical facial expressions and physical comedy.  Larry Dallas (Richard Kline) and Mr. Furley (Don Knotts) add to the hilarious havoc with misunderstandings and situations that will leave you in tears.  John and Joyce, the show's veterans, always hoped they wouldn't simply make people chuckle, but fall off the couch laughing, and they've achieved their wish.",1137715200,9,737,5.672727272727273
2475420,5,B000DZ95IU,"Underestimated Priscilla Barnes saves show from cancellation. If you look at the first few shows, you will see that Priscilla Barnes has a stronger part in Three's Company than in the later seasons and episodes. Why? I didn't know why until I saw the special E years later. Priscilla Barnes was not happy with the producers and wanted out of the show. Instead of having a public fiasco like Miss Suzanne Somers did, Barnes decided to honor her contract. However, Barnes' part became less substantial in the last two seasons due to: Number one, Barnes unhappiness with show and Number two, Barnes' producers unhappiness with Barnes. According to Barnes' interview, the producers reduced her salary for not offering to renew her contract when it expires. As a result, the show lost its magic in seasons 7 and 8. Sexy Priscilla Barnes became third party to John Ritter and Joyce Dewitt. However, Priscilla Barnes was the Marilyn Monroe who saved the series. The best episodes were the first ones when Jack has to go to the hospital and meets Terri, who he likes, and she rejects him. Then later, he rejects her and humuliates her in public when there is a threat she will become his new roommate due to Janet's liking. Also, we have the episode where Terri thinks Jack is a hustler. Other highlights, Jack sees a robber, Terri brings home a date, who Jack and Janet thinks came from a mental hospital, the Lucille Ball special, one of her last appearances, hosts the one hour retrospective of the last 6 years of Three's Company. This is a great season. I can only thank the talented, sexy, Priscilla Barnes. I love Suzanne Somers but like Priscilla Barnes almost as much. If Priscilla Barnes didn't have the war with her producers, the ill-fated ""Three's A Crowd"" would never have transpired. John Ritter wanted a new show, Priscilla Barnes wanted out, and only poor Joyce Dewitt wanted the show to continue. Enjoy this dvd set because it is the best one after Somers but declines afterwards.",1136851200,27,1990,4.771014492753623
2475421,5,B000DZ95IU,"Season 6 marks the debut of Priscilla Barnes as the new roommate, nurse Terri Alden. Terri does not start off on the best foot with Jack Tripper as we see in the two part season premiere ""Jack Bares All."" Jack ends up humiliating her in front of everyone, with Larry's help, at the party in the second half of the episode, but quickly realizes what he has done, and welcomes her aboard. With Terri's arrival, Jenilee Harrison's character of Cindy Snow leaves to attend UCLA to become a veterinarian, although she does remain in a limited role for the rest of the season, before being let go. Harrison, who was a last minute replacement the previous season due to the Suzanne Somers situation, did not have the sexual tension necessary as one part of the series, so the producers brought in Barnes, who was able to fill that void. I do believe that Barnes certainly is a much nicer person than Somers, and that her character of Terri fits in much better with Janet and Jack than Chrissy Snow ever did. With Somers' departure(she was fired at the end of season 5), Joyce DeWitt's character of Janet Wood takes on more of a physical comedic role with Jack Tripper. Some memorable moments from this season: Jack and Janet's friendship reaches an important moment when Jack tries to warn her that her dance instructor is a creep and only interested in one thing. Janet realizes this at the end of the episode ""Some Of That Jazz."" Jack, trying to win back his girlfriend, serenades the wrong girl(with Larry singing). Jack pretending to be a doctor to impress his visiting grandfather. And, at the end of this season, we see a two part retrospective ""The Best Of Three's Company,"" hosted by the first lady of television herself, Lucille Ball. A fantastic season, which proves even more that JOHN RITTER is the star of this show, NOT Suzanne Somers with her big head and swelled ego.",1136592000,13,1876,4.636636636636637
2475422,5,B000DZ95IU,"The 1981-82 season,the sixth for Three's Company,began a little later than usual due to a writers' strike. Fortunately,the strike didn't last as long as the actors' strike that delayed the beginning of the previous season. Suzanne Somers,one of the original TC cast,was officially fired after 1980-81 although Jennilee Harrison filled Somers' shoes as the roommate of Jack Tripper(the late John Ritter) and Janet Wood(Joyce DeWitt) in the middle of that season. In 1981-82,Cindy Snow,Chrissy's beautiful but clumsy cousin played by Harrison,moved out of apartment 201 to study veterinary medicine at UCLA(University of California at Los Angeles). So Jack and Janet throw her a farewell party. Guests included upstairs neighbor Larry Dallas(Richard Kline),landlord Ralph Furley(Don Knotts),and Jack's and Janet's not-yet-moved-in roommate Terri Alden(Priscilla Barnes). Also Jack went back to work at Angelino's Restaurant(he was fired after one shift under a different name in the previous season). Jack rejoined his boss Frank Angelino(Jordan Charney,playing the role recurringly) and Felipe Gomez(Gino Conforti,also playing the role recurringly). Jack injured his finger in Angelino's kitchen and was sent to Wilshire Memorial Hospital. He was placed under the care of a beautiful nurse who gives him a tetanus shot. Here's where Jack and Terri meet. Terri is that nurse. At first,Jack didn't want to be roommates with Terri after how she treated him. But Jack changes his mind at the party. Cindy regularly visited apartment 201 when she wasn't at UCLA. Here's what else we see this season: When Terri moves in,her parents and sister drop by to see the apartment. Also,she tries to perform as best she could on her violin(she was studying the instrument). I thought it sounded awful! Janet almost becomes a professional dancer(she quit working at Arcade Florists and later came back). She was sexually harrassed by her male instructor. The trio spend the weekend at Cindy's aunt's farm. Terri on a dinner date with a co-worker,a psychiatrist who Jack and Janet thought was a ""looney bin"" patient. Jack ends up in jail because he unknowingly set a wanted criminal free. Jack serenades a southern belle with the aid of Larry and two guitars. Jack's healthy grandfather,who Jack thought was terminally ill,visits the trio and Wilshire for treatment from Jack(the grandfather thought Jack was an M.D.). Also there's a two-part retrospective entitled ""The Best of Three's Company"",hosted by the late Lucille Ball. We also see Ritter and Ball meeting. Ritter was a longtime admirer of the star of the 1950's sitcom I LOVE LUCY. After this season,Harrison was written out and her character was never mentioned again. I dedicate this item to the memory of Ritter(September 17,1948-September 11,2003).",1136332800,18,2795,5.412844036697248

2475606,5,B000DZ95IU,"Great show from when i was a kid, and still easily holds up today.  The main thing you need to know?  There were only two types of shows: ones involving a misunderstanding, and ones involving out-right deception.  And 3's Company knew how to milk them for all its worth and get the laughs as well.  Plus, it had an uncanny ability to get some of the best character actors to create extremely memorable supporting bit players in guest spots.

I have all 8 seasons and despite being more of a Mr. Roper and Chrissy fan than a Mr. Furley and Teri fan, i think this is one of the best seasons for 3's Company(3 best imo being seasons 3, 4, and 6).  You get quantity and quality on this set, only thing missing are bloopers.  As with seasons 2-8, it comes in a convenient case and folds out like a book for easy access to the dvd's.

Despite being season 6, for the most part, this really could be a great starter season for the uninitiated.  Cindy and Furley are pretty much established, Terri is introduced, and traces of Chrissy and Lana are gone.  Of course, the 3 work-horses Jack, Janet, and Larry are all at full-strength as well.

Get all 8 seasons cause it really was/is a funny, and at times heart-felt, show about friends and how they stick with each other and have each other's back.  On screen anyway.  And speaking of friends, how Jack Tripper never ended up on a guest spot in Monica Gellar's kitchen is beyond me.  My two favorite t.v. chefs, and they were never in the same kitchen?  Yeah right.

(side note: this season has one of the most idiotic/ridiculous/hilarious scenes ever committed on tv...Jack on a couch with a cpr dummy.  Enjoy)",1278806400,3,1653,4.456666666666667

2475608,2,B000DZ95IU,"If you don't have Seasons 2, 3 and 4, they are ""must-haves"" and the best this show ever produced.  After that, the story lines often became too predictable, simple and stupid.  Terry in the beginning certainly wasn't as good as Chrissy, and although I like Furley a lot, I got more laughs out of the Ropers, not to mention that after Season 4, Furley didn't seem to be in as many episodes.  I've purchased Seasons 1 - 7 in this show.  I'm almost finished with Season 6, but it's not a labour of love to watch - just labour.  I can tell you I won't have any hesitatations selling these bad boys back to Amazon.  There's no way I would sell 2, 3, and 4, but after that you can keep 'em.  I'd never put myself through Seasons 5 or 6 again.  No thank you!  I have yet to finish the last disc in this season.

Addendum:  Well, I just finished the last disc and have to say my review above is too harsh.  The last disc is probably the best although the first disc has one or two good ones as well.  Also, in the last few episodes Terri starts going bra-less a lot more, with stunning results.  That and the episodes are just funnier and more interesting to watch made me regret giving Season 6 only two stars - my fault for reviewing before I finished watching - but on the other hand, it does represent my feeling after sitting through discs 2 and 3.  Since it seems that the program is in an up-swing by the end of Season 6 (disc 4) I am looking forward to and can only hope that Season 7 continues this momentum.  Honestly speaking though, while there are 2 or 3 good episodes in the first 3 discs, and with disc 4 being quite good overall as well, it will still try your patience getting there - this season ended on a good note, but I don't forget a lot of the sour ones it took to get there.  For these reasons I'd change my star rating to 3 overall, and certainly no more than 4.  A substantial number of these episodes (more than half) are pretty lame - a few 5 star episodes does not make the whole season 5 stars - in spite of my nostalgia for the the show and the fact that I grew up with Jack, Terry and Janet.",1274745600,,2116,4.094660194174757

The fifth season has maybe five really good episodes, but if you really like this series you'll want the whole collection.  This season, six, is where the character relationships really shine.  It is in these last three seasons (6,7,& 8) that the comedy and story lines are the best.",1227484800,2,415,4.581081081081081

There are certain innuendos made but I personally think that it is still good clean fun and this is true entertainment.  I definitely recommend this series to everyone.",1216857600,,395,4.444444444444445

I saw a little of the new girl, who replaces her (she was a L.A. Rams football cheerleader/ a sporty girl), and she arrived at their apt/ house, as Chrissy's cousin. She is ok, but Chrissy was a big part of the show. Still, Janet, and Mr. John Ritter, still do real good. This is a super, super good tv series. Highly recommended, esp seasons 1-4.",1216598400,,517,4.232323232323233
2475625,5,B000DZ95IU,"Season 6 marked the debut of Priscilla Barnes as new roommate Terri Alden, a nurse at the local hospital. While Cindy moved out, on the pretext of attending classes at UCLA and living in the dorms, Jennilee Harrison frequently stops by the apartment and maintains contact with the gang.

Plotwise, there's much of the familiar old hilarity, stemming from issues and themes such as Mr. Furley's self-proclaimed machoism, Jack's love for the ladies, and misunderstandings between the roomies.

Jack's job as a chef also allows for owner Mr. Angellino and envious ""salad boy"" Felipe to make a number of repeat appearances.

Some memorable episodes include ""Maid to Order,"" where the klutzy Cindy attempts to work as the trio's housekeeper, and another features a visit from Jack's grandfather, who is under the delusion that Jack is a doctor. Still another involves a robbery at Janet's flower shop while Jack is a visitor.

It's also funny to look back, thirty years later, at some of the pop culture that is don't-blink-an-eye common now, but a novelty in the late '70s. For example, much confusion (of course!) ensues from a mix-up when the gang sets up their first answering machine, as it does when Jack and Janet are pursuaded to try a computer dating service.

Despite its being the sixth season, this show is still consistently funny. You won't regret picking up a copy!",1188345600,,1375,4.935064935064935

2475629,5,B000DZ95IU,"Season six catches the cast of Three's Company in transition. Suzanne Somers is gone as Chrissy Snow, and Terri Alden is in as the new roomate of Janet Wood and Jack Tripper. Chrissy's sister Cindy was in a lot of the early episodes of this season just in case the viewing audience didn't take a liking to Terri.

Highlights of this season afre the episode where Janet's flower shop gets robbed, and the episode where Jack comes a long on Larry's date with Terri (even though Jack was supposed to be having supper with Janet).

I also enjoyed the first episode where Terri becomes the new roommate (at the bequest of Terri) and tries to win over Jack's acceptance. All of the episodes of Three's Company revolve around sexual innuendoes and misunderstandings, and many of them are predictable.

But the cast, including Don Knotts as Mr. Furley, giving winning performances all the way through the season, and they carry the day even when the storyline lacks spark and creativity. I have to give this 5 stars.",1162512000,5,1008,4.715909090909091
2475630,5,B000DZ95IU,"I bought this season mainly for one episode, my favorite of all time- ""Up in the Air""- Jack is at his very best in that episode.

We laugh and laugh and laugh at that one.

However I have been pleasantly suprised it has some other great episodes-for example,  ""Strangers in the Night""- Jack and Larry are both great in this one. You also see a real tender side of Jack in this episode that is so sweet.

Even though I miss Chrissy in this season I feel like Teri holds her own as the newcomer.  I never really got into Cindy as Chrissy's replacement, so I was happy to see Teri come along.

Overall a great season- but I feel they are all great. You can't go wrong with Three's Company.",1158451200,6,686,4.198473282442748
2475631,3,B000DZ95IU,"I love Threes company and was looking forward to getting this season, but I have to say that I was left a little disappointed.  The writters seem to have difficulty dividing the episodes between the characters.  Whereas before you would have had episodes focused on the Ropers, Larry, or one of the kids, this season is essentially Jack and Janet.  Furley is hardly seen after the first few episodes of this season!!!  And on the few occassions he does appear he says more or less the same thing ""got a date with a hot chick tonight"".  Larry is used a lot more but still does little more than ""knock on their door"" deliver a few lines, and leave (and don't get me started on Cindy!!!)

Also they seem to treading old ground.  Several episodes are very similar to those in earlier seasons, and actors reappear in different roles (for example, Angellinos daughter was Ropers niece in season one, Janets Svengali had been Chrissys Svengali in season three, the woman who wants to buy the building from RF was the woman who bought the building from Roper for Furleys Brother in season three, and Jeffrey Tanbur is back!!!)

No wonder they shook things up in season seven by openning Jack's Bistro.

Now for an uncomfortable truth........Terry can't act.  She mugs for the camera, but it all looks so un-natural.  And while she does become a central character in the series, this isn't a great start.

This is a season for completeists.  Far better would be to look for any of the three seasons featuring the Ropers (boy were they missed).",1153180800,4,1534,4.657992565055762
2475632,5,B000DZ95IU,"Three's Company is one of my favorite shows, I remember watching the re-runs over and over again as a kid. Thanks to Nick at Nite and now DVD releases of each season, I can feel like a kid again and view these wonderful episodes un-cut and anytime I feel like it. Season 6 is by far my favorite, the arrival of Priscilla Barnes character, Terri made this classic show even better. Terri is not dumb like former roommates Chrissy and Cindy, she actually has a brain, she is a registered nurse. The main reason I love this show is the talented and much-missed John Ritter, his physical comedy was timeless like Lucielle Ball. My favorite episode of this season is when Terri invites a therapist over for dinner at the apartment and Jack and Janet thinks he is a mental patient, full of laughs and of course those classic misunderstadings. Three's Company should be in everyone's collection, Come and Knock on our Door...""",1146096000,6,919,4.644171779141105
2475653,4,B000DZ95IU,"So finally, we have approached the Priscilla Barnes years of Three's Company.

After the Suzanne Somers debacle of season five in which we were rather hastily introduced to Cindy Snow, Chrissy's cousin, it became obvious that a new roommate is needed. Jennilee Harrison is great eye candy, but her acting and comic timing needed a lot to be desired; not to mention chemistry between her and Joyce DeWitt and John Ritter.

So enter Priscilla Barnes, and season six of Three's Company turn out to be the year that the show will either make it or break. History showed that Priscilla Barnes saved the show and extended it to another three successful years.

However, watching the season again on DvD, several things are becoming apparent that were not so obvious at first.

Despite the addition of the talented Priscilla Barnes, her chemistry with Ritter and DeWitt, while adequate, was not the same as Suzanne Somer's. In fact, due to the absence of Somers, the show had re-focused itself; instead of being about Jack, Janet and Chrissy, it is now about Jack and Janet with Terri occasionally getting in the mix.

In season six, John Ritter and Joyce DeWitt often carried the show and the Terri Alden character rarely said more than ten words in a row. Other than the premiere episode that introduced her character, Terri was often looking from the sidelines as Jack and Janet goof it up.

With the addition of Barnes, the Cindy Snow character was left on the sidelines. In season six, Jennilee Harrison became loud and obnoxious, almost as if she was overcompensating her character's increasing irrelevance.

Overall, season six still manage to rack up points for some outrageous episodes, my personal favorites are: Jack's 10, Hearts and Flowers, Eyewitness Blues, Janet Wigs Out, Doctor In the House, Professor Jack, Two Flew Over the Cuckoo Nest, Strangers In the Night, The Matchbreakers, Maid to Order, and Now, Here's Jack.

As for extras, only the premiere episode have audio commentary. I am surprised that Chris Mann, the author of ""Come and Knock on Our Door"" didn't do a commentary for season 6, for he provided a lot of interesting insight on previous seasons.

And for all of you out there posting requests for episode lists instead of reviews, get Chris Mann's book. You will find complete episode listing there.",1143590400,5,2325,4.910714285714286
2475654,5,B000DZ95IU,"I love this season just as much or more because the tension that suzanne somers created was gone.  There's no other like Joyce DeWitt and Pricilla Barnes did a fantastic job.  It would be great to see them on TV someday.  To Don Knotts,Norman Fell,Audra Lindley, I miss you and you still bring laughter to all who watch.  To John Ritter, Thank you very much for all the years of hard work, dedication, and laughter.  We can know why the lily has so brief a time to bloom in the warmth of sunlights kiss upon it face before it folds its' fragrance in and bids the world good night to rest its' beauty in a gentler place.

Joyce Dewitt was always on point&I had a crush on that chick&still like her,but the vibe of the show with the writing was missing something. Don Knotts was a trip though.without Suzanne Somers the show lost a certain edge it had&while the two ladys that replaced her had some moments,neither captured that certain ""IT' that Somers had.",1143331200,6,504,4.9411764705882355
2475656,5,B000DZ95IU,"I've always loved Three's Company for its ability to replace characters and still remain entertaining and memorable.  As popular as Suzanne Somers was on the show, I always enjoyed Priscilla Barnes more.  Terri Alden is every bit as attractive as Chrissy Snow and much more intelligent.  It's a shame Priscilla Barnes was not happy with her experience on this show, because she truly made this season special.  Don Knotts, John Ritter, and Joyce DeWitt continue to deliver wonderful performances as Mr. Furley, Jack, and Janet.  Several reviewers have said this was one of the best seasons of Three's Company.  I agree with them completely.",1142812800,26,640,5.105769230769231
2475657,5,B000DZ95IU,"Most people will agree that Three's Company lost quite a bit of their magic chemistry (pertaining to the cast) when Suzanne Somers was dropped from the show, only to be replaced by the pretty (yet horrible) Jennilee Harrison.  Although the ratings of the show improved somewhat during the fifth season, the writing just wasn't up to snuff anymore.

Enter Priscilla Barnes.

The antithesis of the 'Chrissy' character, 'Terri Alden' brings a new vitality and dramatic pathos to what could have been another empty-headed part.  This season ends up on another high due to the total package of the cast, writing, and the crew.  Some of the best television of all time can be found on this set, including ""Macho Man"", ""Two Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"", ""Maid To Order"", and particularly ""Up In The Air"", which garnered John Ritter his first deserved Emmy.

Those who claim the show 'jumped the shark' during this season have their eyes shut and their ears gummed up.  By the end of this season, you can tell that the whole of the cast has their parts down cold.",1142812800,9,1055,4.73224043715847
2475658,5,B000DZ95IU,"John Ritter (may he rest in peace) was the star of ""Three's Company."" He was always such a perfect comic actor because both his slapstick and deadpan expressions could make even the most serious viewer laugh hysterically. Jack has always been my very favorite character of this series. And even though Mr. Ritter has passed away way too soon his legacy will live forever.

I used to watch the repeats of ""Three's Company"" as a little child and I always felt like I was watching a ""grown up show."" Twenty years later it doesn't seem ""risque"" or sexually charged like most primteime (and unimaginative) sitcoms are today. However, ""Three's Company"" was a pioneer in the sexual revolution of modern American television, because they were able to push the envelop of submission just a little further each week. But it is also a very funny, classic, sitcom that the entire family can watch. It is unfortunate that ""Three's Company"" never really got the respect it deserved. Although Jenilee Harrison and Priscilla Barnes are excellent, it is also unfortunate that by the 6th season Suzanne Somers was long gone.

Professor Jack  First aired: 10/27/1981
