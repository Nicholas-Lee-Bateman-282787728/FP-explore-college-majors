8385876,4,B0030H16VW,"Deeply disturbing and thought provoking, well-acted if not without serious flaws, this indie film asks some serious questions
about our relationship to the suffering of others.

Lukas, a young socially disconnected toll-booth clerk who lives in a sort of haze meets a holocaust survivor and becomes
obsessed with the man, and then the subject itself.  He begins working for a group recording survivor testimony. Ever more
unhinged  Lukas becomes driven to watch and recording the testimony, filling up his own empty life with the horrifying
 memories of others.  He starts to call himself a Jew, watches the tapes 24/7 and becomes increasingly delusional.

Ultimately, this borrows a bit too heavily from other films of lost souls becoming increasingly mad in messianic ways;
Taxi Driver,  The Believer, etc. as well as some clich concepts of 'going crazy' behavior. (Does every disturbed person tape
hundred of images to their walls?)

It also relies too much on hard to believe behavior by others.  (e.g. the attraction the daughter of the 1st survivor, a bight young
doctor, to the pretty blatantly unstable Lukas is very hard to buy, as is the idea Lukas keeps his job long when he starts indulging
in behavior like video-taping every car that passes by his toll booth, asking the occupants 'are you a Jew'?).

But this has it's own understated nightmare quality, which makes it, like a train wreck, compulsively watchable.  Which, in turn
implicates the viewer in the same kind of obsession with the suffering of others the main character thrives on.

It also, only partly successfully, attacks Hollywood for trivializing the Holocaust in blockbusters like `Shindler's List', although it
doesn't make it clear why `The Memory Thief' is really any different (in fact I felt queasy about the use of real survivor testimony
n a film that's more a tale of madness than history).

None-the-less, I was always pulled in by the film, and quite haunted by it.  Something I can say about far too few films.",1329177600,,2002,5.009063444108762
8385877,5,B0030H16VW,"I have every book and tape on the holocaust; I've lost family during the war and I won't ever want to forget or have the world forget what has happened.  This movie was odd, very odd but it was also sheer genius.  The story is explained above in another review so I won't go into all the particulars but it is amazing how this tale was weaved-turned upside down-and circled around to end up changing this boy's life.  Now I don't believe this kid was all there but what he went through and what he became was heartwarming.  Nobody has written a movie like this where so few characters held the whole show--if you are Jewish (as I am) and if you are not it doesn't matter--this is a piece of history that will bring tears to your eyes, heart to your heart and you will never forget it--it just lingers, it makes you think 'could I have survived?' and that's a good - no it is a GREAT thing for the more we know the more the more we will be sure this WILL NEVER EVER happen again -EVER!!!!!!!!!!

THE MEMORY THIEF tells the story of Lukas - an aimless, haunted young man in contemporary L.A. who buries thoughts of his own past in the humdrum routine of a tollbooth clerk. A chance encounter with a Holocaust survivor suddenly brings into focus a world and an identity he embraces with frightening intensity - the victimized Jews of World War II. As he begins to enthusiastically act out his newfound obsession, Lukas discovers that survivor's guilt isn't just a Jewish phenomenon.",1265155200,2,952,7.73394495412844
