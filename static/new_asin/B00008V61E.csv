7987267,4,B00008V61E,"I really enjoyed this film, I had seen it before and I'm the same age as the young boy who in fact wrote the story and directed this film, Maurice Murphy. In fact I was at school with Maurice in 1954. I came from northern Victoria myself and witnessed the Italian prisoners of war being treated similarly, mainly by their own from memory... even attending Mass. There is a beautiful natural atmosphere in most parts of the film, the acting is excellent and mostly was a good fit for the time. I'll watch it again and I'd like to one day in the future catch up with Maurice. Well done Maurice. Ron Walker",1475107200,,603,4.345132743362832

7987269,4,B00008V61E,"The film has it's weaknesses but overall it is entertaining, sympathetic and interesting and quite well acted.  It is a fictional account , as seen through the eyes of a child, of Italian prisoners of war working as farm labourers on an Australian farm and the relationships that develops between the family (Mother and children), German Jewish refugees  and the prisoners of war.",1391731200,,380,5.015873015873016

7987271,5,B00008V61E,"For a really unique view of World War II, I'd recommend this movie.  Far from the horrors of the War, it is the story of three sets of people affected by the war.  The father of the family left home at their farm has been away for five years as a soldier.  There are a German Jew and her daughter, who have escaped from Germany; they were trying to get to the United States, but instead were diverted to Australia.  Finally, there are two Italian POWs, who have been 'loaned' out to the absent soldier's family to help keep the farm running.

The most unique aspect of this movie is that it is probably the only World War II movie where the Jew, at least the mother, is the 'bad guy.'  She is a bitter, sour, vindictive woman who will resort to fabricating a story to get back at one of the Italians because her 20-year-old daughter finds him attractive.  [She doesn't have much else to chose from in such a remote farm.]

This movie is full of very interesting and entertaining segments.  Probably the most comical is when the seven or eight-year-old boy, high up in a tree, sees one of the Italians and the Jewish daughter get totally naked outdoors and make love.  He then tried to explain it to his eleven-year-old sister and younger brother.  The whole movie is made up of different ordinary, yet intriguing daily events that make the whole experience of watching it very satisfying.  I would caution that there are a three incidences related to sexuality, so if parents let their kids watch the movie they should be prepared to explain it to their children.  I don't recall any bad language.",1203379200,5,1597,4.503472222222222
7987272,5,B00008V61E,"""15 Amore"" is an excellent movie shown from the perspective of a child living in an Australian farm.  The beauty of nature and the simplicity of life in the farm is contrasted with the darkness and hatred that rise from the remote Second World War.  This darkness deeply affects, in different ways, most of the adult characters of the movie.",1198022400,3,341,4.666666666666667

It has not been released locally and I enjoyed it enough to make the purchase from Amazon.",1142812800,,167,4.0606060606060606
