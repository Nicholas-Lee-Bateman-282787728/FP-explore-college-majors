6583107,5,B00MIA0JHY,"This is exciting and long overdue. I remember watching the original series on TV in the late 50's with my dad who was a WWII vet. I was only 8-10 back then so didn't truly understand all the humor points, but I remember my dad laughing and explaining things to me. After I completed boot camp in 1969 the memory of the episodes took on a whole different meaning. I've owned the VHS anniversary edition for years as well as 2 copies of both the DVD anniversary edition and the first season. In fact I love the series so much I bought 2 copies of both DVDs just in case anything were to happen to one of them. While some critics these days might say the scripts were simple compared to 2010+ TV; the Bilko characters were well developed and the chemistry they had with each other made every one of Bilko's plots and shams hilarious. Few if any comedies since have stood the test of time as well as The Phil Silvers Show. I've pre-ordered this and am anxiously awaiting the release date. This will be the best Christmas gift I will have received in many, many years. The only regret I have is my dad passed on in the early 90's, long before any of the episodes were first released, and I know he would have enjoyed seeing these once more. Kudos to the manufacturer for releasing this now as the long wait for one of television's greatest comedies is almost over. If you've never seen the show but like fun, wholesome entertainment you won't be sorry if you purchase this series. It's Americana at its best!",1411689600,11,1503,4.39068100358423
6583108,5,B00MIA0JHY,I have no idea why it took the brainiacs at Cbs so long to release the complete series. Along with the honeymooners it has stood the test of time and still funnier today than the so called comedy sitcoms currently running. Welcome back Phil we have waited a lifetime for your show to get the recogniton it deserves. As for all those CBS execs who kept us waiting no comment.,1411344000,14,374,4.357142857142857
6583109,5,B00MIA0JHY,"2 thumbs up 4 Shout Factory ! Thank you very much for coming to our rescue , giving us the shows we love and want to see again and be able to own them. I'm going to send S.F. an email to ask them to get the rights to release the complete 11 seasons of BAYWATCH !  I found out that the U.S.A. releases are only 3 seasons and not complete or actual. Germany is the only place the complete series has been released. SO COME ON SHOUT FACTORY LETS DO IT AGAIN !!!",1408406400,5,458,3.872340425531915
6583110,5,B00MIA0JHY,"I too almost cried when I saw these.  I will pre-order today.  While you can't say Bilko is underrated since it is a classic, it does not get the recognition it deserves since it was on when I Love Lucy, and The Honeymooners were on.  Phil Silvers is simply a genius, he alone is worth the price.  Throw in Col. Hall, who is also a low-key genius, the platoon, Rocco, Doberman, Henshaw, etc.

A few months ago I ordered Bilko the complete series from another DVD provider (I probably can't say the name but don't ""wish (for a) DVD"" from these people"".  They are copied off TV, some from Comedy Central some from TV Land some from who knows.  The quality is awful, obviously VHS tape at slowest possible speed, often with complete sections missing.  Come from China, in 2 months, with stick on address labels on the DVD's.  Wait for these from Shout to come out, they do the best they can with the material and while it won't be HD, it will be the best possible quality.

Real simple, if you like good old slapstick, silly, over the top comedy, situations that are completely unrealistic yet make you laugh uncontrollably get this.",1408233600,32,1130,4.495098039215686
6583111,5,B00MIA0JHY,"The Best Comedy Show  Ever ! I did cry when I seen this on Amazon Uk and pre ordered,  I hoped it would get a stateside release.  Nat Hiken and Phil Silvers and the entire cast made this the best show.  The writing and acting are classic, no shows even come close to this. This release made my number 1 TV show  wish come true.  Thank You Shout Factory !",1407888000,15,354,3.9857142857142858
6583112,5,B00MIA0JHY,"SGT. Bilko  Yea, Yippie, another great TV classic from shout factory. The memories have been flooding back with all the great releases of late. Sometimes I think no one is listening to us the consumer and then wow. We get Batman 66, the Jeffersons and the one and only great Phil Silvers and Sgt. Bilko. He was Funny and always had something new up his sleeve. What a holiday season our family will have this year with all the great TV of yesterday. Bilko for the holidays and the price is great. Thanks Shout and Amazon.",1407456000,17,521,4.427083333333333
6583113,5,B00MIA0JHY,"I almost cried when I saw this was being released. More to the point, my faith in humanity was restored! The PHIL SILVERS SHOW (also known as YOU'LL NEVER GET RICH; also also known as SGT. BILKO - or just plain BILKO to fans) was voted the greatest sitcom of all time by the UK's RADIO TIMES in 2003, and no less an authority than Larry David (creator of SEINFELD and HBO's CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM) declared it his favorite television program ever.

BILKO ran for 4 glorious seasons (from 1955 to 1959), garnered 3 consecutive Emmy Awards for Best Comedy Series, and enjoyed a healthy life in syndication for decades (particularly in the UK, where its popularity has remained undimmed for more than 50 years). It transformed Phil Silvers and Nat Hiken into household names and TV icons, and made overnight celebrities of Paul Ford, Joe E. Ross and Maurice Gosfield to boot. It showcased mid-century sports legends like Yogi Berra, Whitey Ford, Sam Snead, Jake LaMotta and Red Barber, and was one of television's very first shows to feature an integrated, multi-racial cast. Among the stellar writing staff were Leonard Stern (whose impressive TV credits include The HONEYMOONERS and GET SMART), Arnie Rosen (writing supervisor of The CAROL BURNETT SHOW) and a certain promising future playwright named Neil Simon. BILKO offered TV audiences their first glimpse of up-and-coming performers like Dick Van Dyke, Paul Lynde, Allan Melvin, Harvey Lembeck, Fred Gwynne, Al Lewis, Charlotte Rae, Dody Goodman, Julie Newmar, Tina Louise, Alan Alda, Bea Arthur, Irwin Corey, Larry Storch, Bill Dana, Morey Amsterdam, Godfrey Cambridge, Bob Hastings, George Kennedy and more. (A pre-famous James Earl Jones can be clearly seen in the episode ""Operation: Love"" from 1958, five years before his 1963 movie debut in DR. STRANGELOVE. An uncredited Robert Morse can be spotted as one of the Schmill University linemen in ""Bilko Goes to College,"" long before his breakout roles in The LOVED ONE and HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS. A pre-blonde, pre-BEVERLY HILLBILLIES Donna Douglas turns up in ""Bilko and the Crosbys,"" and Dick Cavett appears fleetingly as an extra in ""Bilko's Godson."") President Eisenhower numbered himself among the millions of fans who never missed an episode. (Ike reportedly had prints delivered from CBS to the White House whenever pressing national business deprived him of catching the broadcast!) BILKO's success inspired a host of copycat shows, from TOP CAT to McHALE'S NAVY, and it proved to be a merchandising bonanza as well. Silvers' famous dimpled smile adorned comic books, LP records, board games, joke books, coloring books, slide puzzles, holster sets and more, and spawned a truly memorable series of print ads for its sponsors, Camel cigarettes and Amana refrigerators. It was a very big deal, indeed.

I've been waiting for this one for a long time. My own personal favorite episode is #44, a Season 2 gem called ""Doberman's Sister."" (Fair warning: you'll never forget the ending -- no matter how hard you try!) Thank you, Shout! Factory, for restoring another undeservedly neglected Golden Age classic, in its entirety, for a whole new generation to discover and savor. There IS hope for Mankind after all!

HYAH-heyaaah-HEYYUP!! UPDATE: I have the set in hand and can vouch for its completeness and overall quality: 20 discs with 142 uncut episodes (approx. 25-26 mins. in length, not the edited syndication versions.) PLUS: the unaired pilot and surviving segments from two lost Phil Silvers TV specials (both featuring live BILKO skits with the original cast). According to popular myth, The PHIL SILVERS SHOW supposedly jumped the shark in the 3rd and 4th seasons when Nat Hiken left the series for health reasons (and to create CAR 54, WHERE ARE YOU?) and the platoon relocated from Kansas to California. This is rubbish, however. I just rewatched the later seasons, back-to-back and in sequence. It's true there's an illogical role-reversal concerning Cpl. Henshaw, but that's virtually the ONLY misstep in an otherwise sure-footed and outstanding series. Phil Silvers was never less than mesmerizing in the role, and the show remained to the end as sharp and fast-paced as ever, with MANY classic episodes characterizing its final years. The following product information comes from both the official Shout! Factory press release and actual sampling of the DVDs themselves. Cheers!

6583135,5,B00MIA0JHY,"One of the greatest sitcoms ever. Every episode is funnier than the last one. Continually hilarious from the first episode to the last episode. Many nobodies made guest appearances before they became big stars. Silvers was a genius in this role. As great as Gleason was in The Honeymooners, Silvers is right up there with him as a pioneer of early TV. Plenty of extras beyond the episodes to enjoy. Will watch it over and over throughout the years.",1507507200,,448,4.6835443037974684

6583137,5,B00MIA0JHY,"""Brilliant"" doesn't even begin to describe the astounding, frenzied energy of Phil Silvers in this show. These were one-take live performances in front of an audience, so you get the flaws and all - including Silvers' incredible improvised one-liners which are unbelievably hysterical! It's like watching a 25-minute comedy-farce piece of theater - I was literally choking with laughter at times! Considering this show was from the 1950's, the DVD transfers are magnificent. Bravo to everyone involved in this project! (Next in line for all-time funniest TV shows: ""The Honeymooners"" and ""I Love Lucy"" - but ""Sgt. Bilko"" rules!!!)",1500336000,2,630,5.373737373737374

6583143,5,B00MIA0JHY,"While it gets very little airtime anymore, this is considered among the greatest comedy series of the Golden Era of the 1950s, right there with I Love Lucy and The Honeymooners.  And it was Ike's favorite TV show.  This was the first of Nat Hiken's large cast series, something that is cost-prohibitive today.

While not all that popular in the US today, The Phil Silvers Show is still surprisingly popular in the UK.  Apparently enough to impact product marketing.  And the definitive DVD set for this series is not any US-market version, but the Medium Rare Entertainment / CBS Video set ""The Complete Collection"" for the UK market, sold on Amazon's UK site (and some pre-owned versions are here at the US Amazon site).  That UK version has been fully remastered and has superior PQ (for a DVD).  Unfortunately, it is NOT a Region 1 set (it is Region 2 for the UK).  So for those here in US, you'll need a region-free player or drive to read them.  A little research can reveal how to either obtain such a player or drive (some are sold here at Amazon), or to revise the firmware on certain drives to make them so.  But it is well worth the effort, as the UK version offers a serious improvement in picture quality over any other copy of this show we have seen, and plays beautifully at the NTSC standard.",1494806400,,1307,4.5

6583151,5,B00MIA0JHY,"This is great set of Phil Silvers andSgt. Bilko's platoon, one of my favorite shows as a kid in the '50's. Amazing early appearances by actors and actresses that became stars later: Alan Alda; Bea Arthur; George Kennedy; Efrem Zimbalist Jr.; Dick Van Dyke; etc. And guest appearances by the McGuire Sisters; Bing Crosby; Dean Martin; Mickey Rooney; etc.

Excellent quality video. And, although there was a packaging error in my set (two copies of one disc, so one disc was missing) the publisher, Shout Factory, quickly replaced the missing disc. Excellent customer service and I could not be more pleased.",1473897600,4,606,5.0
6583152,5,B00MIA0JHY,"I have been hoping for just such a package for decades! All of Bilko under one roof. These episodes are always amusing, and sometimes side splitting. Winner of 3 consecutive Emmy's for best comedy,",1460851200,2,197,4.823529411764706

6583155,4,B00MIA0JHY,"Yes, Sgt. Bilko is funny, but after watching 3 of the 4 seasons it got a bit boring. Like many other sitcoms, freshness wanes when the theme doesn't change much. Bilko' s greed seemed exceeded only by his repeated failures. Perhaps that was the lesson to be learned with this series. The first three seasons took place in Kansas and I guess the writers figured there weren't any more situations there to keep the show going so they moved everyone to California. Somehow the efforts at humor didn't gel as well there as far as I could tell.

To be honest I am reviewing hundreds of classic TV episodes for inclusion into a small library and I will include this series, but I need to let the viewers know that a little Bilko goes a long way. I still much prefer McHale's Navy and F-Troop to this show. I am not surprised that Phil Silvers didn't want to continue further seasons.

On the plus side, the video is great considering the age of the show. The sound could be a little better, but then, that is most likely due to the age as well.",1455321600,,1038,4.345360824742268
6583156,4,B00MIA0JHY,"I have been waiting for this for decades - not only because the televised episodes had syndication cuts (in fact, some episodes have two different sets of cuts; for example, I have seen broadcasts of ""It's For the Birds"" that leave out the $32,000 question, and broadcasts that leave out the sailor's $64,000 answer early in the show), but it includes a few episodes I never saw aired (and I am under the impression that some - the Kay Kendall and McGuire Sisters episodes, for example - were not broadcast because of rights issues).  Note that this is pretty much a ""bare bones"" release; there aren't any deleted scenes, for example, but that's not surprising considering that it's about 60 years old and the show had a habit of not having second takes for minor errors.

It doesn't get five stars because the transfer quality is moderate.  I realize the source material isn't sharp to begin with, but some scenes come across like an overly compressed JPEG picture.",1453680000,7,966,4.738095238095238

Every episode is hilarious and a joy to watch.  I will treasure this feel good classic sitcom from the 50's for many years to come.  I should also mention that another great sitcom from the early 60's is Car 54 Where Are You?

6583286,5,B00MIA0JHY,One of my favorite classics.,1416182400,,28,4.8
6583287,5,B00MIA0JHY,"The first person to own a personal computer was Phil Silvers.

It was in his head.

The extraordinary actor/comedian had a razor sharp sense of timing and the ability to call upon decades of skill developed in vaudeville and on stage. By the time ""Bilko"" came along, he could run through routines like a Rolls-Royce.

Silvers, who might also be known to audiences from ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,"" ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World,"" two Disney comedies and the ""Hamlet"" episode of ""Gilligan's Island,"" was as iconic to TV comedy as Lucille Ball (who has a cameo in a ""Bilko"" show) and Jackie Gleason.

Watching a master in action is remarkable in itself. But with Bilko, you also get scripts by such writers as Neil Simon and guest roles from Dick Van Dyke (first TV comedy appearance), Alan Alda (first TV acting job) and Oscar winner George Kennedy, who started out as a military consultant and was encouraged by Silvers to join the show in a guest role.

Other recurring roles are played by actors who went on to major series work: Fred Gwynne, Al Lewis, (both of The Munsters); Paul Lynde (Bewitched); Jane Kean (The Honeymooners);  Charlotte Rae (The Facts of Life), Larry Storch (F Troop) and Barbara Barrie (Barbara Barrie).

Bilko's main crew are composed of character actors familiar from hundreds of TV shows, movies and cartoons, like Allan Melvin (All in the Family, The Brady Bunch, Magilla Gorilla, Pufnstuf the Movie), Billy Sands (McHale's Navy) and Harvey Lembeck (the Frankie and Annette movies).

If you love cartoons, this show was a blueprint for many. Daws Butler had a field day with his spot-on Silvers impression for Hokey Wolf (and Top Cat on records). Hanna-Barbera's ""Top Cat"" was based squarely on ""Bilko,"" right down to the voice of Maurice Gosfield (Doberman on ""Bilko"") as the voice of Benny.

Among the 142 episodes, there are some true classics among the already fine half hours. My top picks include:

The Twitch (Charlotte Rae)
The Court Martial
The Vampire
Bilko's Formula Seven (Natalie Schaefer)
The Con Men
Platoon in the Movies
The Eating Contest (Fred Gwynne)
It's for the Birds (Fred Gwynne)
Bilko the Art Lover (Alan Alda)
Bilko Presents Ed Sullivan
Bilko Goes 'Round the World
Radio Station B.I.L.K.O.
Show Segments (the cast play themselves)
Bilko Saves Ritzik's Marriage
Bilko's Big Giveaway (Morey Amsterdam)
Guinea Pig Bilko
The Weekend Colonel

Series creator (and great TV comedy writer/producer) Nat Hiken transferred the basic premise (sans Silvers) to a police precinct with his other classic sitcom ""Car 54, Where Are You?"" starring Gwynne and Joe E. (""ooh! ooh!"") Ross, who was again teamed with the explosive Beatrice Pons as a constantly battling couple.

The series' four seasons are sold separately if you don't want to get them all at once. You can start with any season, as there are no story arcs and the characters remain consistent throughout (with the possible exception of Melvin's character of Henshaw, who suddenly becomes the voice of reason in the very last few episodes).

Some of the bonus features were carried over from an earlier DVD release of selected episodes, but this is the first time the whole series has ever been available to own. The features include commentaries by Storch and Melvin and the original ""You'll Never Get Rich"" show and interviews with Silvers and his daughters. It's a goldmine worthy of the avarice of Sgt. Bilko himself.",1415923200,3,3445,4.9189655172413795
6583288,5,B00MIA0JHY,This series brings back such fine memories for me. I have two other DVDs that I ordered some time ago from AMAZON and finally the complete series was available. I was in the 5 grade when this series first aired. I thought it was very well done and wish some of the new series are as funny. The package arrived in very good condition.,1415664000,,333,4.21875
6583289,5,B00MIA0JHY,"FINALLY! I've been watching the First Season of this show released some years ago (along with E-Bay ""taped from television"" copies of the rest of the series) and have been hoping I would live to see a complete edition. On the advice of other reviewers, I just ordered the British edition from Amazon. UK, but if you don't have an all-region DVD player, don't hesitate to buy this set. For me, SGT. BILKO is THE single funniest, most brilliantly performed comedy series in the history of American television. To paraphrase T.S. Eliot, ""There is SGT. BILKO and FAWLTY TOWERS. There is no third."" [PS: If you don't have a Philips All-Region player, you're missing out on a vast number of films that are not yet available in the American market. And they're far less expensive than many regular DVD Players.]",1415577600,2,804,4.75
6583290,3,B00MIA0JHY,"After receiving and viewing parts of this set - and doing some research - I must agree with other reviewers:  the UK set is better and, if you have a code-free, multi-region DVD player - preferred.  Much more respect for and tribute to the show's details.  Go to Amazon's UK website and see for yourself.  Cost, with shopping, will be more than the US release.  But the US release is truly lazy and does not speak well for a trend I'm sensing from Shout! Factory.  Also true for the recent WKRP release.  The trend seems to be to get the content on a rack and move it, move it, move it.  The WKRP release was far better in many ways than the Bilko release.  If you read the very fine print on the Bilko sets, there's an indication that some episodes have been edited.  The WKRP situation was much more transparent about this because of the music rights.  What's missing from Bilko?  Dunno.  Also, it's clear that Shout re-used the original SEASON ONE packaging.  In other words, not much effort was put in here - and the shows, while taken from nice prints, have not been upgraded in quality.  Disappointing.  Bilko was clearly more popular in the UK than in the US after its initial run.  The differences between the two releases are evidence of this.  Sometimes it does pay to find a code-free, region-free player and find better editions globally.  And sometimes, the releases of classic US shows are not even available in the US - such as Mr. Terrific and the later seasons of McCloud.

=======

I've just ordered the UK set to find out for myself.  If my suspicion is correct, my US set will be heading for eBay soon enough.  I also see where Amazon just raised its price to beyond the price I just paid for the UK set, including shipping from the UK.  For those still interested in the US set, there are better deals elsewhere.

=======

Further update.  Received the UK set super-fast.  Paid less than the US set is currently going for on Amazon (as opposed to the far lower pre-order price.)  I agree completely with everything other reviewers have written about the UK set.  It is simply better.  So, if you have a code-free, region-free player with a PAL-NTSC converter, go British (who seem to have more demonstrable affection for The Phil Silvers Show.)  My greatest disappointment is that this is a lazy release by Shout! Factory, and I expect far better.  I'll be a bit more cautious in the future.  I'll keep my three-star rating in tribute to Phil Silvers and company.  As for my US set, it's on eBay.  Everyone wins!",1415404800,8,2533,4.5265486725663715
6583291,2,B00MIA0JHY,"The actual content is 5 star and Phil Silvers was a genius and his comedy timeless. However I can only muster 2 stars for the lacklustre presentation of the episodes and packaging. Prints although watchable have not been cleaned, show signs of age and are not in broadcast order. Why does this edition display Viacom as this dates the masters to the early 90s? Episode details are scant, no history of the show like the UK edition. Looking at season one its obvious Shout! did a Bilko style deal and bundled the 2010 edition as this is identical to the copy I already own. Glad to have the complete Bilko, Phil never disappoints. However the presentation here does.",1414886400,25,665,4.6440677966101696
6583292,2,B00MIA0JHY,"Definitely an inferior release in comparison with the UK version. The first glaring error appears on the label on the outer packaging where it states that this release marks the 60th anniversary of the show - the 60th anniversary of the first episode being broadcast is not actually until September 2015. As to the picture quality there has been no attempt to de-noise or clean the prints and there are some cadence issues - as a result the picture quality is inferior compared with the UK boxset whose prints were cleaned and de-noised. The outer casing which houses the boxset is very, very flimsy indeed. The Season One DVD appears to be old stock leftover from the original CBS release in 2010 and is identical to my original CBS S1 purchase, whilst the other three seasons are emblazoned with the SHOUT logos. The inner sleeve artwork on Seasons 2, 3 & 4 simply lists the episode titles whereas the Season One sleeve contains episode titles, episode guide and airdates - and as such suggests that SHOUT have worked on the remaining unreleased 3 seasons only. Episodes also include a mixture of CBS and Viacom idents at the end of the credits. The UK release has been standardised to include CBS idents only. This again shows a lack of attention to detail. Written information is non-existent whereas the UK release includes a detailed, well-illustrated booklet. Apart from Season 1 the episodes have been listed in production number order as opposed to the actual airdate order whereas the UK version has listed episodes in actual airdate order. The extras too are not as good as on the UK release - US viewers only get the original 5 minutes of the Sonny Fox interview whereas UK viewers are treated to a 20 minute version of this interview. The UK version includes an excellent fun piece called Bilko In Colour and also includes a wonderful easter egg in the form of a copy of the original script for the pilot episode - neither of which are present om the US release. The other extras are simply re-hashes of the extras used on the 50th anniversary and CBS Season 1 releases apart from a couple of interviews with Phil Silvers' daughters. On the plus side there is an episode of The New Phil Silvers Show but once again this does not appear to have been cleaned or de-noised. As the price is reasonable it is worth buying simply to see Phil and the gang in action and enjoy the sharp writing and sublime scripts but for the ardent fan I'd recommend investing in a region-free DVD player and a copy of the UK release.",1414713600,48,2524,4.6236080178173715
