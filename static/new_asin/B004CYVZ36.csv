4330279,5,B004CYVZ36,"I  was at  the July 18th 2008 friday night show and I have to tell you hands down this was the best show Billy joel ever put on, and when  Paul Mccartney came out at the end to sing ""let it be"" it was unbelieveable. This dvd will be a definite must buy, for sure!.",1296000000,7,264,3.7636363636363637
4330280,5,B004CYVZ36,"I remember filing out of SHEA that hot summer night in 2008 - stunned at what I'd just witnessed - and already chomping at the bit for a CD or DVD of this historic show. After seeing a bunch of garbage on youtube, we FINALLY got to see it at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2010, and I was FLOORED.

OK - in the interest of full disclosure - I'm a huge Billy Joel fan, and even bigger Paul McCartney fan, and (alas) a die-hard NY Mets fan. So, really - what's not to like.

Billy Joel turning over the mic to Sir Paul - at his own concert, in his own backyard, was really classy. So much so, that when McCartney opened ""the new Shea"" (CitiField), he invited Billy to perform with him. No big deal ? Tell me, for as often as Paul is a ""special guest"" on the concert stage, how many times does he bring on a guest ?

NOTE: It's not a straight concert film - there's lots of New York history - baseball and otherwise - in the mix. I really was hoping they'd have done a treatment similar to the ""Concert For George"" (George Harrison tribute) DVD - one disc with the theatrical release (edits, interviews, backstory, documentary stuff), and one with just the concert (beginning to end).

UPDATE - JUST ANNOUNCED JAN 21: There will be a CD/DVD set called ""Billy Joel Live at Shea Stadium"", to be released March 1st. NOW it seems all will be right in the world ! Set list looks like a combination of the two-night stand, with guests from both nights.

Still, top to bottom, the movie is terrific. Very informative and entertaining.",1294876800,67,1522,4.289198606271777

playing the last concert at Shea Stadium before they tore it down.  Billy had the class to iinvite
other great performing artists to this show - such as Paul McCartney.
This is a documentary DVD, not a concert DVD - just to be clear to the customers.
But it is fantastic and a must have for Billy Joel, Beatle fans and Shea Stadium fans.
Now I want Billy Joel's sales company to release a DVD concert that was titled ""Live from Long Island.""
It was great, but isn't on DVD yet.  Let's see that one available soon please!",1419033600,9,620,4.336206896551724

I just watched it with all the extra scenes and interviews, and as a Long Islander who grew up in the same area as Billy Joel, it brought back great memories.  I am also a fanatic Mets fan, so the scenes and interviews with Mets personnel was the best.  Seeing all the stars who attended, it made me wonder if there is a complete video of the concerts, with more of Don Henley, John Mayer, Tony Bennett, Paul McCartney, and the others.  All in all though, it was a wonderful video.",1417910400,3,504,4.387096774193548

But then, WHY should I look for that? Duh,! It should have a RED WARNING for the product on the zones. I understand that Amazon is global but come on! This is so ridiculous! Wish I would have read the negative reviews before I purchased but I figured they'd be about the quality of the snow...hard to judge that when you can't watch it! Very very very upset!

4330399,1,B004CYVZ36,I bought this DVD for a Christmas gift. I searched for it on Amazon and it popped right up. I chose the first one on the list. What I didn't read carefully enough was the format - it was a European format that wouldn't play on our machines. I had to order a second one in order for my son-in-law to enjoy it. I think Amazon did a disservice by listing it first without a disclaimer or at least emphasizing the European format. The DVD itself was really good once I had the right one.,1390435200,2,483,4.094736842105263

4330423,5,B004CYVZ36,"So here's the disclaimer:  I am a native New Yorker, a fan of the Beatles (who isn't?), a fan of Billy Joel and my beloved Metropolitans, otherwise known as the New York Mets.

What a treat.  I remember watching the last game at Shea Stadium on tv.  It was the same weekend that Paul Newman had died, and I kept thinking this was the end of an era.  Seeing all those great New York Mets return to Shea one last time, left me in tears.  A year or two later, I had heard about the ""Last Play at Shea"" but wrote it off as a concert video.  Boy oh boy, was I ever wrong.

It is a concert video, but it isn't.  They are able to intertwine, quite effortlessly and seamlessly, the history of Shea Stadium, how the Mets came to be, Robert Moses, who built (or destroyed, depending on your point of view) the highways that criss-cross the city, the bedraggled Mets teams over the years  -- highlighting the remarkable Game 6 comeback in the 1986 World Series -- and the life and music of Billy Joel.  I am three weeks from my 51st birthday, and when I was in high school, Billy Joel's music was ALL OVER THE PLACE.  And with the birth of MTV, he hit paydirt in the 80s and 90s.  It wasn't until years later that I began to appreciate Billy Joel for the tremendous talent that he is, singer/songwriter and Piano Man.

I learned things about New York City I did not know prior to watching the documentary.  How they were able to gently fold in so much in just an hour and a half is brilliance.  The songs take you back, Billy Joel playing his heart out on stage with an on-point band, and the cavernous, decrepit Shea Stadium, months away from being torn down.  As Mets outfielder Darryl Strawberry said, ""it was a dump, but it was our dump.""

I remember the last game at Shea, and explaining to my son in that mournful weekend as we processed the loss of Paul Newman, the epic moments that happened at Shea:  the tumultuous 1969 season when God blinked and the Mets won the Series, the visit by the Pope, the game played two weeks after 9/11 and the blast in the night by Piazza that saved us all, and of course, The Beatles.  This documentary was able to capture it all.

And how they managed to get Sir Paul to return to Shea, to come full circle, with Pete Flynn (""get off me grass""), the Mets groundskeeper who whisked the Beatles off the field back in 1966, was nothing short of stupendous.  The last scene is singed in my brain:  a time-lapse of the final walls being torn down of Shea Stadium, revealing, like a curtain, the glittering jewel of Citi Field, new home of my beloved Metropolitans, all to the soaring notes of ""Let it Be.""  I wept like a baby, truly.  This documentary touched me more than I imagined it would.  Thank you, Billy.  LET'S GO METS.",1384128000,4,2755,4.288759689922481
4330424,1,B004CYVZ36,Shame on the seller. I bought it few weeks ago and was planning on watching it with several friends last night.

Well apparently they thought it would be better to put this dvd in a different format so that people in the NY area who are Mets and Billy Joel fans, who'd actually want to watch this thing, CAN'T play it!!! The dvd player simply brings up a message about it not being playable because of international restrictions or something like that.

It chronicles the rise and fall of Shea stadium, and the Mets, along with the career of Billy Joel as he plays the last concert at Shea stadium. Really well made and a lot of interesting trivia about all the entities mentioned.  Special guests at the concert are Paul McCartney, Tony Bennet, Garth Brooks and others.  Lots of special folks on the DVD that have been important in Billy Joel's life, including family and band members - which have often been one and the same!

I was somewhat disappointed when it arrived and it was not what I expected. But I decided to put it in and watch it anyway. I was overjoyed that I made that mistake. The video was a great, well written, and attention keeping documentary about the history of Shea Stadium, with lots of great information on the Mets, Joel, and the Beatles. You also make a connection with the groundskeeper that was with the stadium from opening day until the last play. Excellent video, well put together, and well worth the buy.

Beautifully crafted, this video is rich in the history of both Billy Joel's life and musical career but also Shea Stadium and the Mets. All of the moments of life are part of history but we often never realize how connected things are, how connected we all are, until someone puts the pieces together for us.  That's what this felt like to me, it was a delightful and also sometimes sad emotional puzzle being put together before my eyes.

I read complaints about sound quality and can't really speak to that because I had no initial expectations, but getting even a glimpse of great artists like McCartney, Mayer, and Bennett to name a few, seeing historical concert and sports clips from Shea, and hearing Billy do the old songs again, was just wonderful.

It is an awesome retrospective of the emergence and growth of an important music culture and an American rock icon both having matured, withstanding the test of time. Billy Joel's life history is brilliantly intertwined with that of the Amazing NY Mets and their original, former home. The significance of Shea as a music venue with various footage including The Beatles 1965 concert, is as inspirational as the sports team who uplifted the spirits of the greatest city on earth during its most troubled times. Billy Joel effectively underscores his talent and humility and shows why he is clearly Long Island's favorite son. His duets with various music legends, including Tony Bennett  (NY State of Mind) and the surprise arrival of Sir Paul McCartney to cap this final performance at Shea before its destruction, is something that that will reverberate over and over.",1325289600,,1002,5.024096385542169

This one (""The Last Play at Shea"") is a historical look at the closing-down and final events at Shea Stadium, NOT a concert DVD.

4330493,5,B004CYVZ36,"As a child I saw on our old B&W TV a broadcast of The Beatles Live At Shea.  It was so wonderfully inspiring to a young child and it kicked my love for music, already budding due to having a sister eight years my senior who exposed me to great music, into a higher gear that hasn't ever left.  This documentary is every bit as inspiring and it is with great hope that the current generation will watch this with that same awe and wonder.

""Last Play At Shea"", the documentary, is chock full of interesting facts about how Shea Stadium came to be and its storied history.  Theres the Mets and how their history dovetails their ""The Haunted House"".  There's the landmark ""Greatest Concert Ever"", The Beatles Live At Shea Stadium, and how its legacy never left and even to this day is stil considered a landmark for the stadium and history.  Then there's Billy Joel...The quentessential New York hometown boy who, outside of The Mets, owns a big chunk of Shea.  It's all here and is lovingly, and very informatively, told in an entertaining as well as authoritive way.

Finally, there's the final concert itself.  If ever there was a concert that unified a large hoard of people in a huge areana, this is it.  Billy Joel assumes his role as fellow New Yorker, Mets fan, and artist with humility and grace.  His respect for what he is a huge part of is delivered in a truly inspired performance.  He starts with a mass of many and ends up with a house united as one.  He rightly calls it ""spiritual"" and his humbleness in letting Sir Paul McCartney end the show with ""Let It Be"" is one of the most perfect acts of selflessness you ever see on stage by a rock 'n' roll superstar.  The word is inspiring, and I can't help but believe in the years to come we will be seeing waves of musical performers who say, like Billy Joel said The Beatles Shea performance did for him, they decided this is what I want to be.

What can I say except ""please see this"" as words always fail when something is this special.  I will add that the information presented regarding Billy Joel's life only added, and not in any gratuitous way, to how I can understand what made Billy Joel NY's favorite musical son.  You get the impression that although Billy Joel has risen to the top of the musical heap he is just a hometown boy that decided to follow his inspiration and he, too, is a underdog that turned into something more by becoming a survivor.  This is a great documentary telling a story of which unifies and entertains, highly recommended...""Please see this""!",1300406400,8,2542,4.465367965367966

4330511,4,B004CYVZ36,"As a Met fan, who also happens to be a Billy Joel fan, I was excited by this release. It is a wonderful documentary that is insightful, heart harming and nostalgic. The back stories of Billy and Shea are enlightening. Didn't know that Shea was a dream of legendary visionary Robert Moses. Didn't know that Billy can from a musical background and had a rough life. Didn't know that Keith Hernandez was despondent after making first out in Game six. Didn't know that Mets groundskeeper, who was there when I was a chiild, drove the Beatles in the Stadium. My only disappointment was that I wanted more about Shea and the Mets and less about Billy and his career.

The quality of the video was outstanding. Looked really great playing in my Blu Ray. The sound was good. The older footage was outstanding and seems to have been upgraded. My only critique was the lack of extra material. When are we ever going to see the heroes of Shea tribute in the last game. Would have loved to see my favorite Mets introduced and line up. The piece with the music critic was great. His insights on music as art was extremely useful. It really challenges the Billy haters.

For those considering purcahsing this video do so. The price is right and it is worth the value with its loads and loads and loads of memories. The interviews are timeless and worth the price alone.",1298419200,,1355,4.526530612244898

So we all gathered to watch LPAS last Saturday night and all I can say is, it was fabulous from start to finish.
I loved the informative history lesson, if you will, telling all about Robert Moses' plans for a better New York including his pearl in Queens, a stadium, eventually adopting the name of William A. Shea Municiple Stadium or, simply, Shea Stadium.
There is much vintage footage, which I love, of the stadium and of the Mets baseball team who called Shea their home.
Then there is succulant color film of the night The Beatles held a concert at Shea. This was great! With Sir Paul himself describing the evening we watch a clip of the group laughing their way through ""I'm Down"".
One of the things I really enjoyed about this documentary are the interviews weaved into the picture. Billy Joel, Paul McCartney, various members of Billy's band, Christie Brinkley and Billy and Christies' daughter among many others.
The scenes from Billy's concert that closes the stadium Shea are electric.
The sound of the band couldn't be better with special attention to Billy's vocals and piano.

4330517,5,B004CYVZ36,"Most people this week will be talking about the latest big screen blockbuster to make its way to DVD. I'd like to highlight something a little different. A documentary that I would guess most haven't even heard of. And yet it's a fitting tribute to the careers of one of America's top living songwriters and...a baseball field.

THE LAST PLAY AT SHEA is a tribute to both Billy Joel and Shea Stadium. The documentary is never boring and leaves you wanting more (word is we will get as I've heard the concert in question is being released as well). It starts with a goal, Billy Joel putting on a concert to be the final event held at Shea Stadium before it meets the wrecking ball. But it's more than that.

Rather than a simple film concentrating on one topic or the other, the film blends the stories of both leads into one. We get the background life story of Billy Joel in more of a topographic style instead of in depth and of how the events that shaped Shea Stadium also affected his life as well. For instance the construction of Shea Stadium was what prompted his family's move as it was being built where they once lived. The stadium hosted the New York Mets which Joel came to love. And its opening event was one that changed his life forever.

The first big event held in Shea was the live performance by the Beatles in the 1965. There is little doubt that you've seen the footage of the event with them being driven to the stage in center field and then hopping on the stage to thousands of screaming young girls. It was the Beatles that Joel saw on TV that made him decide that's what he wanted to do.

But the film doesn't only focus on Joel. It also tells the story of the New York Mets. The Mets and Shea were built to fill in the void left when the Dodgers picked up and moved to California. They were the home town team that stuck in there even when times were tough. They were the team the working man supported as opposed to the New York Yankees. They were a team beloved by fans more than most. And they came back from tough times to rise to the top of the heap once more, just as Joel has done on several occasions.

As both stories unfold we also get portions of the two night concert that Joel put on as a tribute to the stadium. He gathered guests around him feeling that with the size and spectacle that IS Shea, he wasn't worthy of paying tribute alone. He's wrong, but he did bring along friends like Garth Brooks, Roger Daltry, John Mellencamp, John Mayer and Tony Bennett to help. He also brought along another special friend who deserved to play the final show at Shea: Paul McCartney.

McCartney was there at the beginning and at the end, though the story of his barely making it that last night is an event in itself. And the most touching moment is seen with an employee of Shea who had been there from the start, a groundskeeper who took his job to heart. He was the man who drove the Beatles to the field in those old news clips and he is the man who drives Paul to the stage via golf cart on that last night.

The music is great. The old footage of both Joel and Shea are informative and offer some historical perspective of the stadium and of Joel in his formative years. It's sad to think that this grand old stadium is gone in lieu of the brand new corporation owned Citi Stadium. And it's sad to think that Joel, as he states while on stage, hasn't released a CD of new music in 15 years. But both are up to the task of this momentous occasion.

The film is a perfect blend of both, or actually all three stories: Shea, Joel and that final concert. It would have been an event to behold.",1297123200,21,3627,4.261627906976744
