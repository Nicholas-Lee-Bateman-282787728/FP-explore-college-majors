2888568,5,B000SQFBY6,"The Boise State Broncos have a reputation. Promise less with a band of rag-tag 'too small for Division I' recruits then deliver more than expected. In turn BSU is one of the most exciting teams in Division I football. To their fans they're the little, non BCS that could. Going undefeated they beat brawn with brains when they crashed the elite BCS party with a 43-42 upset victory over powerhouse Oklahoma in last year's Fiesta Bowl. This compelling, slick documentary takes the viewer beyond the feat and concentrates on the players that not only could, but did.

Director Michael Hoffman is a Payette native and former Boise State Student Body President and A-list director that struck it rich in Hollywood. Hoffman is as Boise Blue as the Broncos, yet he lets his blue collar flag fly with this film. He aptly concentrates on the fabric of this accomplishment, the players and their dreams and it's refreshing to see a story unfold where hard work is rewarded in the end.

From the opening minutes of this marvelous film one can see that this Band of Bronco Brothers are bound together by work ethic and never say die attitude. There're glimpses of the team's legendary weight room workouts and the runs up the Bronco stadium stairs.

Then there's Jared Zabransky the farm boy that always knew he'd be playing big time football somewhere. Zabransky shines in this film not only because of his triumph but his sincere frankness. Overcoming a disastrous game against Georgia the year before, family struggles, then faced with adversity of throwing an interception with just a minute to go in the Fiesta Bowl, he tells us how he was able to pull off one of the greatest finishes in college football history. Then there's the touching interview with his mother. Now we know him and the rest of the story.

This is a solid documentary made in spirit of how and why and then there are the glorious lessons for the common man. Eleven men working together can beat the BCS elite if they truly believe. This is the team that finished 13-0 the best finish in college football in 2006, that's a lot of belief.

Hoffman weaves the story through the apt and insightful interviews with players, fans, coaches and the plentiful highlight footage. The end result is a film that presents a 360- view of the Broncos you thought you knew. There's amazing fan stories, including a guy who held off a trip to emergency room, so he could watch the end of the Fiesta Bowl.

A nice touch is the DVD's Special Features with extended interviews with Coach Chris Petersen and a surprising Dan Hawkins who when asked why he left Boise State for Colorado said, ""You didn't need me any more."" Which was an insightful way of saying that the Broncos had done all they could do under the Hawk. Hawkins is humble and loveable and fans will be remembered why they liked him so much.

The only downfall of the DVD is that it ends after an hour and a half. It's so juicy, interesting and insightful that many will long for an extra hour of insight and insider story lines. The players coaches, fans are so earnest comfortable and clean that you'll forgo bathing for a week or so. Hoffman succeeds in putting an intimate face on the familiar Bronco nation. It's fair to say that this is one of the best sports documentaries made on college football. And this comes from a diehard ISU Bengal Booster.",1194220800,4,3365,4.645378151260505
2888569,5,B000SQFBY6,"Michael Hoffman was able to catch the exact essence of what it takes to be successful, not only on the blue turf, but in life itself.  Through interviews with the players, their families and members of the BSU staff, we get a priviledged view of the makings of a true to life dream team.  This documentary should be shown in every classroom in this country.  It's about overcoming adversity, the American work ethic, what character and integrity is all about, and the building of confidence.  You can't watch this show without feeling like you learned a life lesson just by watching it. Highly recommend it even if you're not a huge football fan.",1189036800,,646,4.6902654867256635
2888570,5,B000SQFBY6,"Of course, I'm a bit biased.  This film, however, is wonderful.  Upon first hearing about this, I thought it would be another cheesy documentary that will be forgotten in 6 months.  Michael Hoffman is a great filmmaker, and his use of all aspects of production is superb.  It doesn't hurt that the scenery, players, coach, and, of course, our beloved Blue are there to make things (even) more interesting.

If you loved the Fiesta Bowl as much as the Boise, Idaho fans, you will enjoy this for both the story and the doc itself.

GO BRONCOS!",1188950400,,541,4.583333333333333
2888571,5,B000SQFBY6,"What an inspirational show. This documentary proves that through a combination of heart, attitide and the belief in one another-now this is  ultimate gift!  Everyone can learn from these life lessons and experiences. Thank you Boise State for offering to share your vision- to never give up and never let anyone tell you that you don't belong.

GO BRONCOS.",1188259200,6,356,5.0
2888572,5,B000SQFBY6,"""Out Of The Blue"" Is a story of more than just football, it's a story of building character,pride and personal responsability. Who we are off the football field, after the game is over,is every bit as important as playing the games themselves. Very few of our beloved Bronco's go on to the N.F.L, yet all of our beloved Bronco's become Pro's in life of one form or another after the stands are empty and the lights go out. The insperation is genuine, the story true, so sit back and enjoy the blue collar hard work it takes to build a nation, the Bronco nation. From the coaches and staff,  to the players and fans. There's a little bit of 'Bronco' in all of us.

2888574,2,B000SQFBY6,"The description is NOT correct ! hen pecked husband thinks that he accidentally kills an odd woman he picks up in a bar & invites back to his apartment. He then places her body on the patio of his next door neighbor. The neighbor proceeds to take advantage of the situation. Not really very funny considering the husband is a coward & a cheat wanna be. In the end the ""manly"" thing to do is to be bossy to his wife, who seems to somehow enjoy it. Very out dated sensibilities.",1426291200,2,476,4.241758241758242
2888575,3,B000SQFBY6,This movie's overall high average rating is due to some of the ratings are for another movie with a similar name.  This movie is one of those cute classics that would never happen in real life.  Not bad but not great.,1425081600,,217,4.2682926829268295
2888576,4,B000SQFBY6,"Nearly all of this film takes place in two adjacent apartments, but the action is non-stop. Of course the movie is influenced by the gender roles of the time, and requires an inebriated bar fly to get the story going, but once it is going, it moves quickly and easily from situation to situation.  Much of the banter is hilarious, well written and well delivered by the actors. Some films take time for initial character development at the expense of plot, but here the plot starts immediately and any (somewhat superficial) character development occurs as the situation unfolds.  It is simply a fun film.",1420502400,2,605,4.8076923076923075

2888579,5,B000SQFBY6,"I really enjoy that most of the stars of this movie are playing against type.  That makes it very funny.  I particularly enjoy the performance of Ann Dvorak, who shows what a skilful comedian she could be.  She is a very underrated actress, who was truly great.",1403913600,2,261,4.51063829787234

2888581,4,B000SQFBY6,Good cast of actors all around in this goofy comedy.  We enjoyed it.  It was not perfect but not very many films are.  It was better than a lot of the junk they produce today in my opinion.,1393372800,,189,3.9210526315789473

2888583,1,B000SQFBY6,"More than half the reviews here (and most of the good ones are for a Boise State football movie).  The others are reviewing the George Brent, Carole Landis film from 1947.  First off, while I love George Brent this is a real stinker and he is completely out of his element.  The video quality is terrible with even worse sound.  Ann Dvorak tries to save the movie with her comedic performance but it looks like the whole thing was rehearsed and shot in two days.  Most scenes are painful to watch with the actors mostly waiting to alternate lines with no realistic flow.  The plot could have worked out and they did assemble a decent cast, but it just doesn't come together and the quality of the DVD is too poor to even give it a friendly second star.  Skip it.",1388448000,5,762,4.361702127659575
2888584,5,B000SQFBY6,"I was very happy to see Out Of The Blue finally available on DVD. It's a fun but forgotten comedy from 1947. The cast is terrific especially George Brent as an unhappily married husband, Carole Landis as his domineering wife, and the hilarious Ann Dvorak who just keeps getting everyone into trouble. As usual Carole Landis steals every scene she is in (although she does get slapped by Virginia Mayo!) and she looks beautiful. The sound and picture quality was very good especially for an on demand DVD. If you're a fan of the actors in it you'll certainly enjoy watching Out Of The Blue.",1367107200,4,589,4.619047619047619

2888590,5,B000SQFBY6,"Not being familiar with Boise State or even that part of the country, I enjoyed looking deeper into the program that suddenly came to the upper echelon of big-time college football with its bowl game victory over Oklahoma a few years back.  This documentary was well done and exposes the ins and outs of a program that does things the right way.  I would recommend it to any football fan.  As a high school coach I'm always looking for documentaries on little known schools that have made it big.  This particular video didn't just cover the season game by game, but rather looked closer at some of the players, coaches, and the philosophy of being a Bronco.",1273104000,3,658,4.598290598290598

2888592,5,B000SQFBY6,"This film ranks among my all-time favorites.  I was simply amazed at how well Mr. Hoffman told his story leading up to the perfect season.  I highly recommend this film for all football fans, especially those in the non-BCS conferences.

8206235,5,B000SQFBY6,"Initially, the story line was so unexpected and off the wall it was hard to concentrate on how hilarious the characters really were. The second viewing was the charm. A gem deserving cult status. All actors play against type and the result is a hoot. The ""Out of the Blue""  Olive was out of this world= dead or alive, Brent a hen pecked ninny, Landis an iron faced vindictive shrew, Turhan Bey undaunted, insinuating, sexy & smooth as silk playing by ear with zanies and the lovely Mayo (in search of a ""mate"" and a litter) along for the ride with Bey and Rabelais her objective. A treat. The ending a twister. The only drawback was the quality of the video (not restored) and the audio was like hearing voices from another room.",1503792000,,729,4.481203007518797
