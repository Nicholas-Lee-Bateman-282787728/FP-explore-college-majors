8646504,4,B00IYRLV1I,"Not just another Faith Based Sports Movie. It hits hard on certain themes that are sometimes avoided while illustrating how character is developed out of conviction, love, and sacrifice.",1459209600,,186,5.448275862068965
8646505,2,B00IYRLV1I,"Sorry to say there was very little basketball, a few pick up games scenes and discussions about the draft. Otherwise it was just about two estranged brothers. It was definitely a low budget production and while it did convey the Christian faith message it was REALLY boring. Not sure what the PG-13 rating was for - some drinking and a scene of smoking pot but by no means what you would consider a PG-13 movie. Both were so innocuously done that a younger kid would barely pick up on it. Acting so/so.  Way too much ""Bro"" and a really cheesy scene with a flash of a gun in someone's hand followed by a quick getaway in the car which was poorly edited. In a culture that's becoming increasingly anti-Christian I think faith-based productions really need to seriously step up their game. Would not recommend.",1438387200,,807,4.604166666666667
8646506,1,B00IYRLV1I,"You would have thought it would be about basketball and you would see a little basketball. Well, it wasn't exactly like that. There was a little basketball, and a lot of tension between one ""stray"" brother and one ""on the rocks"" brother. It was odd, and definitely a waste of money. I could have found a lot of better things to do with my evening. Perhaps the makers needed a larger movie budget.",1410048000,,396,4.438356164383562

8646509,4,B00IYRLV1I,"Jason Fields directs and stars in this Christian film about a college graduate balancing his newfound faith, family, and pursuing a career in professional basketball.  The main character, Damon Sharp struggles with temptations and tries to relate with his broken family still healing from their father/husband leaving them.  Damons mother isn't taking good care of herself and his brother Darrin (starred by Day of Our Lives, Sean Douglas) is still living a partying lifestyle with a young son depending on him.

Damon is trying to relate to his brother and seeks advice on life and sports with his Christian athletic friends.  Several professional basketball players star in this film and share their faith filled testimonies.  The roster includes Corey Maggette, Allan Houston, and Anthony Tolliver.  Not surprisingly, there is rap music and it too, is Christian themed.  While its not my style, the artists who rapped were clearly talented.  Unfortunately this movie only offers stereo sound so people with 5.1 or better setups won't be able to benefit from it.

The visual quality could be better, but the message of Gods love and grace is still shown clearly",1401321600,2,1163,5.1436170212765955
