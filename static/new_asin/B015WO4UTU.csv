8734765,4,B015WO4UTU,"Long thought lost, this film appears in pristine condition transferred directly from the rediscovered negative. This film is a unique blend of Jesus Christ Superstar, Othello, and Twin Peaks. The producers, used to making ordinary focus-group-tested commercial films, had no idea how to market something this unique and fitfully brilliant. Instead of finding the right marketer, at least two major re-edits were attempted. In respect to famed cinematographer Conrad Hall, the visuals seem largely intact. However, in the first half, the soundtrack has a pointless voiceover (or sing over) that introduces every character and describes almost every action, no matter how obvious. In its original edit, with a little more budget, this could have been a flat-out classic. It's too bad the producers didn't realize that this film could have been marketed for the midnight movie crowd like Rocky Horror Picture show, made the following year, another quirky London play converted to film. This is the only chance that Patrick McGoohan, famous for the Prisoner TV show, directed a film. He brings an unexpectedly intense surrealism to the task that reminds me of David Lynch. For those familiar with Lynch's Twin Peaks, I was surprised to see so many parallels in the style as well as the story line (e.g, Bob vs. Iago, Laura Palmer vs. Desdemona, Red Room vs. Black Bus).",1453507200,3,1365,5.153153153153153
8734766,5,B015WO4UTU,"While I can't speak to the DVD production, I was one of the few members of the first screening of this film after it was re-discovered. Long thought lost, Patrick McGoohan's sole directorial picture is as unique as it is delightful. Stunning visually and laced through with the vibrant poetry of Shakespeare and Richie Haven's thrumming period blues, this is not a DVD you'll want to miss if you enjoy rare cinema.",1447286400,7,414,4.763888888888889
