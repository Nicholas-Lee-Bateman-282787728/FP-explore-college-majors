So what's it all about? Well, it is about a very enterprising young lady called Keiko Nakadai who gets a chance to fill in while the regular weathergirl is absent at a local TV station. At the end of the weather report, Keiko comes from around the desk and flashes her knickers. The rest, as they say, is history....

The film is a perfect representation of the madcap Japanese sense of humour and it also has some great lines.
My favourite comes from the poor school boy who is love with Keiko: ""All the boys are in love with you. You're the most intelligent, most beautiful and most violent girl in school.""

Kei Mizutani plays the role of the dominatrix Keiko Nakadai with obvious relish.",1192147200,2,956,4.359550561797753
