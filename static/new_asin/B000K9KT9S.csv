Contrary to what you may expect, especially for that much money and for only 1/2 an hour, there is no production value at all. This is just a 1/2 hour home video of a guy walking/swimming around with a camcorder, occasionally set to cheesy music. There is absolutely NO narration or anything else to indicate what sites or locations that you are watching. Don't get me wrong, there are some gorgeous views on the DVD - but anyone with a camcorder can get those if you're in Bonaire. Also, the DVD would freeze for a few seconds every minute or so.

As for the bonus DVD w/ 256 pictures...again, don't expect ANYTHING from the pics. It was just a dump from a memory card and copied onto a DVD for distribution. Even an amateur photographer submitting images for publication would remove all of the out-of-focus pictures. There are quite a few of them, too...and I'm not talking about slight fuzziness from not being in focus, it's more like, ""What is that a picture of?!?""...no rules of thirds or any basic photographic principles were followed...the images actually say they were shot with a Canon PowerShot SD550...I would at least have recommended an SD800 or A710, both with Image Stabilization...but, they're still P&S cameras...and there are waaaaay too many camera crammed in a plant macro attempts - I think he must've given the camera to a 12y.o. and said ""Just take pictures of anything until the card is full...""

I hate to rag on a fellow diver, but dang...it's like you just reached in my pocket and stole forty bucks...

If you are going to produce material like this and put your name all over it, it would behoove you to add at least some amount of professionalism to the product...",1199404800,3,1819,4.642857142857143
