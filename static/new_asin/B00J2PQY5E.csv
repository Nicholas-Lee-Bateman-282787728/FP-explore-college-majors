6316925,5,B00J2PQY5E,"Excellent documentary to suggest next time someone says they don't know what GMOs are.  A few scenes are a bit hokey but this dvd is loaded with good info.  I'm buying a copy for my organic gardening class so I can share it.
And next time someone tells you that organics won't feed the world, you can tell them we already produce twice as much food as we need on this planet.  The problem is politics that keeps people hungry.  And organics actually produce MORE food longterm than chemical production.  Refer people to the Rodale Institute and 30 years of studies.",1405987200,67,565,4.554455445544554

We should want to know what role we play in this experiment that has been conducted upon us without our knowledge nor our permission.  We should be outraged that we have lost our innocence, to greed and corruption.  You may not realize it but there was a time when our food was safe and we didn't' have to question it, but no longer.  Corporate america does not care if we or our children suffer any long term effects caused by the monsters that they create, so long as they reap their rewards.

25% are just slow scenery shots.

25% is actual information you can learn from like:
- GMO's are in our food and are even fed to fish you would catch in a National Park.
- To avoid GMO's, buy organic.
- Monsanto is the main company pushing GMO's and there is a lot of corruption in our government.
- Other countries know the risk of GMO's

If we don't learn to do breeding fast by inserting genes into food we are going to run out of it. thousands die from vitamin deficiencies these methods can provide. Also haven't heard of any study showing toxin or bad results from modifying food because of all the work going into preventing this.

Instead, this very sloooowly covered how pervasive GMO foods are in America (the point could've been made in a couple minutes) and then proceeded to feature an endless stream of kitschy, fear-mongering, what-if's with very little science to back the paranoia. Finally, towards the end, the French rat study appears. Yes--this is what I wanted!

The food industry has been taken over by chemical companies who do not care if you die from their food so long as the profits are large.  Don't stick your head in the sand.  You MUST see this.  The solution, for now, is spend the extra money to buy ORGANIC.  Our own Congress just passed HR 1599 (The Safe and Accurate Food Labeling bill).  It is anything but this.  It precludes states from requiring food manufacturers to disclose whether their food is genetically modified or not.  You read that correctly.  Almost all of the Republicans in Congress voted for this bill.  Our local representatives (Darry Issa, Dana Rohrabacher), supposedly conservatives looking out for us, voted yes on this bill.  They threw us under the bus to keep us in the dark about what we eat for bribe money.  I called Darryl Issa's office in DC and gave them an earful.  The guy answering the phone had nothing to say.....no defense.  He just apologized and said they are getting a lot of calls about this.  Trust nobody, especially not our representatives, the state and federal government, and all the food manufacturers.  California had a chance to force GMO disclosure but voters were deceived by Monsanto's commercials depicting family store owners going out of business because of the proposed labeling law.  What a lie.  Californian's were too stupid to think for themselves and the proposition did not pass.  Wise up.  Educate yourself.  Watch this documentary!",1455753600,2,1609,4.788321167883212

This documentary reveals the unfortunate truth of the insidious effects of central power handed over to campaign contributors. The reason Jeremy had so much difficulty finding truthful answers is because our government is not protecting the people but rather their campaign funding.  This film will both anger you yet enlighten you to the truth. Jeremy had to go over sees where independent studies were performed (longer than the 3 month study performed by the gmo company to ""prove"" the safety of their profitable product to the FDA) which discovered major health hazards!  No shock...it was just a relief to FINALLY have a study speak the truth to the public even if a text book company hired someone to retract the study.  I wonder how much money switched hands for that retraction to happen.  Companies can even support local elected officials, which can influence what information is allowed to be taught within public education institutions.  I refrain from using company names bc the companies are so unethical that there is no limit to their quest for power.  I thank Jeremy for documenting his tenacious quest for the truth.  Thank you for sharing this most unfortunate truth so that just maybe our public can overcome this health hazard.

What was fun for me in this film is where the Dad used his little kids for a kind of 'teach-in'.  In a remarkable coincidence his oldest son is a seed fanatic and collects them wherever he can.  Although deeply disturbing in how Monsanto and others introduced this fake food under our radar, so to speak, in this film the material was lightly handled creating a nice balance while we are being freaked out.  Our only recourse at this point, since the Dark act supported by Monsanto was passed not allowing labelling, is to buy organic wherever possible and let our Senators know where all 90 percent plus of us stand on this issue and keep pushing for them to do  their duty by us. Until we get money out of politics there may be more of the same.  Keep alert!",1437955200,,858,4.364779874213837

6317425,5,B00J2PQY5E,"There are criticisms that can be made of this documentary but they are few: Certainly a stronger intellectual thread line could have been used, a bit more intellect would have buttressed the soul of this documentary without withering its emotive intent. There is also a serious question about the role of parents and what we teach our children: while Jeremy means well in making his children aware of what they are eating, he veers into instilling the kind of fear that is unhealthy for children. Children have no ability to Solve the problem and as such, it is a parent's job to protect them, rather than install free floating fears.

On the other hand, the use of such cute kids just screams the issue: We do not know what effect the infusion of these GMOs into our soil and foods will have on these kids, and all the other kids of the world, in forty years. Fifty years. Sixty years. Most of us have no idea what fresh vegetables of fresh fruit tastes like. I am a gardener and as a gardener, my choice is to use no pesticides of any kind. I experiment with various natural enemies of all those things who think I'm growing my vegetables for them, rather than for my family. Because I presume I will lose a certain percentage, I grow a bit more to compensate.

Besides watching this documentary, a couple of quick healthy eating tips would be to eat no fast food; it's just not necessary. And buying organic is not expensive when you have no waste. When I buy a chicken (organic, of course) every bit of it is used including the carcass for the most wonderful soup. Recently used some of those frozen chicken breast to make chicken soup because I didn't have a chicken carcass (a family member buys them to use for sandwiches for his lunch at work) and was appalled at how terrible it tasted. The difference was not slight; the difference was such that one has to wonder if all those cans of stuff and crude we've been eating has ruined our taste buds and no one knows what anything tastes like, kinda like in The Matrix where ""Mouse"" says everything tastes like mush or oatmeal or something like that.",1427068800,2,2105,4.493472584856397

This makes it possible to apply the herbicide roundup and kill everything except the roundup ready seed and plant. This increases yield because they can plant them closer together without having to make room for weeding rows. They also use genes from a bacterium that produces a toxin to certain common crop pests such as tobacco mosaic virus which affects corn crops.

What should worry everybody is the toxic roundup we are eating and drinking! Now Monsanto has literally created superweeds and superbugs which are roundup resistant. Talk about a bad company!

Wish more people cared this much! Adorable family!

The maker of this documentary put a lot of work into it, traveling to D.C., Norway, France, and Haiti and more places.

Monsanto declined to be interviewed as usual. We need to care more about big companies having too much money and power, rather than being passive about it. There is clearly no transparency in this company. If they were proud of their seeds and their products they would be singing about it!

Organic farming is sustainable and does produce the same yields as factory farming. Any other statement is a myth.

Also, there is a part in the movie where they dress in HAZMAT suits to play in the corn because ""the corn is a pesticide.""  That's crap.  A plant that is a pesticide simply means that the typical pests don't like the plant.  Not that it is a toxin.  If more people would grow even a small fraction of their own food, Monsanto and Bayer wouldn't have the power they do.  The thing that gets me is how Monsanto sues farmers for their crops getting pollinated by their crop.

6317595,1,B00J2PQY5E,"This guy claims that we already produce twice as much food as we need. The WHO and IPCC disagree and wonder how we're going to feed 9 billion people in just a few decades. Who's right? This guy? He talks to a couple of Haitians, watches them burn some seeds, and determines that GMOs must be bad. Sure, we modify seeds to be more water efficient and resistant to pests naturally so we don't spray more chemicals and this guy has an issue with it? Sorry, I think Joe Shmedley isn't really the person I want to determine the validity of my science. A few centuries ago, he'd have been a flat-earther.

I'm no fan of massive agribusinesses and I have a real problem with a company who can patent part of our food supply, but this film isn't the answer to the argument, it's just fear mongering similar to the nuclear disaster frenzy of the 70's. We've been systematically ""genetically engineering"" our agriculture for thousands of years.",1415923200,17,934,4.559523809523809

In fact if your going to Genetically Modifiy something, why can't they just genetically modify the weeds so the weed has the poison in it and not the food, so that the seed can't reproduce, is dwarfed, and dies prematurely and makes excellent fertilizer??? Instead of putting poison into the food, put it in the weeds...

About this documentary, people are tired and leery of empty evangelistic documentaries that rely far more on sensationalism and have little to no data or facts. There are many good introduction to the dangers of GMO documentaries that have already come out. This documentary has nothing new, nothing compelling, nothing to further the cause so that we can make steps in catching up with the rest of the world to ban or at least label the dangers in these foods; especially the dangers for children.",1415836800,4,855,4.77027027027027

It should cause anger and thus, efforts to work to stop this madness inflicted on us in such a stealthy way.  It was narrated in an informative, relaxed, and thorough manner featuring candid conversations with Jeremy, his wife, and children (who were sometimes quite amusing and which helped counter the gravity of the subject matter).  Quite excellent!  I plan to watch it again and take notes.  Everyone in America and Congress should watch this and vote immediately to stop this atrocity committed on our health.

6317622,2,B00J2PQY5E,"I was hoping for a clear explaination of why GMOs are bad.

Instead, the movie showed mostly the director's kids, how much people hate Monsanto (Haitians and farmers), how GMOs are in the majority of processed foods people buy, and how most people don't know any of this.

I DO NOT eat GMOs. Not because there is a conclusive study showing the negative long-term effects of GMOs on a significant sample, but because there isn't ANY study showing the the long-term effects on a significant sample (nobody knows).

The only long-term study DOES show a higher mortality rate in the GMO fed rats vs. the control group (2 years, which is 60 human years), but the the sample size is only 20 rats per group (certainly enough to warrant a study on a larger sample, but not enough to know for sure whether GMOs are bad).

I gave it two stars because it still conveys the ubiquity of GMOs, and how reasonable it is for us to at least KNOW when we're eating them. But, as for supporting it's case against GMOs, it was severely lacking.",1415577600,5,1024,4.489247311827957

6317784,3,B00J2PQY5E,"Good Documentary has a lot of useful information, however like most documentaries the director/producer goes to the extreme to get his point across.  Put it this way, any business headquarters that you show up to including the one that you currently work for with out an appointment, and it doesn't matter what questions you are asking, they will turn you away.  Its called ""Professionalism"".  If that company doesn't want to schedule an appointment they don't have to, that is their right.  Just like its the right of any business to refuse service to any one that walks in the door.  The one thing that really caught my eye is the part where they have to wear HAZMAT suits to run through a cornfield.  I was raised on a farm, I did de-tasseling,  GMO or no GMO, there is nothing that the corn is putting off that will warrant the wearing of a HAZMAT suit.  With that said the most dangerous thing in a cornfield is actually the dirt.  Sounds odd right, how could ""dirt"" something that we used to roll around in and play in be dangerous.  This is because most farmers use manure which is animal s*** to fertilize their fields.  Its some of the best fertilizer money can buy, ask any farmer.  Now I don't know about you but I personally don't like to roll around in animal s***.  Hence why I see it as dangerous or unclean.  But hey, everyone has their views and opinions on what is and isn't dangerous.
  Either way its a good documentary the information is always nice to add to my knowledge of what things are.  Just remember when you start seeing the extreme stuff.  Like all the questions about ""do you know if that has GMOs"" or ""Do you know what a GMO is"" most people don't have a clue what that is, or if its in their foods.  They even state that it is cost prohibitive for a company to go out of their way to see if such and such is GMO or not.  He even says it himself,  a company is there to make money.  That is what companies do.  Now is Patenting GMOs wrong, yes.

6317818,3,B00J2PQY5E,"Very one sided - did not discuss any positives.

Jeremy Seifert is the writer, director and narrator of this documentary. He looks like he is in his 30s/40s and drives a VW Eurovan with his family. He looks like a hippie and therefore I knew this documentary would be extremely biased. The documentary was very one-sided, he discussed most of the opposition which I mentioned in my article.

It was interesting to see that he would interview farmers discussing the negatives and as the farmers were about to discuss the positives, the scene would cut off and he would raise another issue. He never discussed any positives which come from GMOs.

This documentary was very critical of Monsanto, I did not realize that Monsanto is the leading global seed provider to farmers. I just thought it was part of roundup and supplied herbicide. Seifert kept on mentioning how GMOs were only about money and nothing else, what he did not discuss is that scientist developed genetic engineering with a sole purpose of providing a greater good to humanity and Monsanto took the risk to invest in this technology. Seifert also mentioned patenting and the containability of this technology which lead in to a brief discussion of the precautionary principle.

Seifert discussed something that I was not familiar with. Since GMOs contaminate organic fields, Monsanto is forcing organic farmers to pay for the GMOs they inadvertently grow. I think this is pretty ridiculous, scientists need to figure out a way to contain the spreading of GMOs and Monsanto should be responsible of the spreading not the farmers. Seifert also discussed how lobbyists have shares in Monsanto (I smell conspiracy).

Seifert did discuss how regulatory bodies have limited the research on health effects of GMOs. Seifert interviewed Gilles-Eric Seralini, a French molecular biologist, who performed tests on mice to see what the health risks of GMOs would be. The male mice developed liver and kidney failures within 4 months and female mice developed tumors within 4 months. What baffled me was Seralini is a famous scientist in France but he was interviewed by Seifert on the street.

Seifert did not mention anything about drought, frost nor salinity resistance in GMOs. He discussed a field test in Idaho that organic yields were just the same as GMOs yields, he concluded this issue with, well since they have the same yields, then we do not need GMOs. I thought this argument was ridiculous, he conducted a test in Idaho and made an irrational conclusion about the world. He did not factor the differing environmental conditions.

This documentary discussed the Svalbaard Seed Vault in Norway. It is a gigantic vault that has seeds from all over the world in case a world catastrophe occurs. This documentary also discussed how people from Haiti will not grow GE seeds because they are unnatural. Monsanto donated millions of seeds to third world countries, some countries have planted these seeds, others have burned these seeds due to cultural reasons.

This documentary finished off with how the consumers in the US should know that they are consuming GMOs, they have the right to know. He discussed how the United States should adopt the same labeling policy as the European Union. In the EU, GE foods must be labeled so consumers know that they are eating GMOs. He mentioned how ketchup from Heinz in the US is made from corn oil but ketchup from Heinz in EU is made with sugar.

This documentary was interesting, it was nice to have a background on this topic because I was able to weed out his bias. To others, this documentary will make them aware of GMOs. I do believe that citizens of the United States should have the ability to chose what they eat and should be informed of what they eat.",1406678400,8,3767,4.882629107981221
6317819,4,B00J2PQY5E,"While not as hard hitting as some of the other films I've seen on the subject, this one treats it very gently and yet is clear about the dangers of GMO's in our lives.  I highly recommend it.",1406678400,27,191,4.026315789473684
6317830,5,B00J2PQY5E,"The Big Picture...

...keeps getting bigger and bigger as increasingly more major corporations begin sticking their tentacles into ""our food.""  Note that one has to put the term ""our food"" in quotations for two reasons: 1) the food we eat, from planting, growth, harvesting and preparation, is no longer truly ours; and 2) it is only for the sake of convenience that we refer to the chemical, pesticide and alien gene laden concoction offered the American people as ""food.""  It is precisely the focus on the bigger picture, shown to us as Jeremy Seifert, the film's creator, discovers it that sets this documentary apart from others such as ""Genetic Roulette"" by Jeremy Smith and even Marie-Monique Robin's ""The World According to Monsanto."".

Where ""Genetic Roulette"" depicts in greater detail the host of illnesses at least tentatively traceable to GMO, ""GMO OMG"" presents a more socio-economic view.  It shows the inextricable synergy between the chemical giants and the seed conglomerates.  The more ingrained in the world's agriculture GMO's become, the more - not less but more - dependent on pesticides and chemical fertilizers they become.  This is also one of the major themes of ""The World According to Monsanto,"" as is the revolving door between Monsanto and the USDA and FDA.

And to even a greater extent than either of the other two GMO films, ""GMO OMG"" gives the lie to the corporate red herring that only GMO's can feed the world's people.  More than one study - and one of the studies a three decade long study - shows GMO's and organic crops running neck to neck in quantity; and shows organic crops far more sustainable over time.  Organic crops are hardier and do not deplete the soil to the extent GMO crops do.

Another thing this documentary does - and does through the almost continual presence of Jeremy Seifert's three young children - is to show what a monumental task it would be to wean people off GMO based foods.  His kids balk time and again at being denied treats virtually everyone in American takes for granted: candy, cakes, ice cream, and so forth.  So while there is understandably a push for organic foods, Mr Seifert does not offer platitudes about how we must at once switch from GMO to organic.  He sees - and shows us - through his own family how difficult it would be.

He shows us also that at least some changes, however minor, can occur even involving the giant food producers.  Whereas in the USA Heinz ketchup uses corn syrup, the same product manufactured to conform to German regulations uses sugar.  So it can be done, however gradually.

Mr Seifert interviews Professor Gilles-Eric Seralini, whose study of GMO effects on rats shows a distinct link with tumors the longer the rats are exposed to GMO's.  One of the French journals that published Seralini's findings later decided to remove his work from its pages.  This happened shortly after a former Monsanto employee was hired by the journal as an editor.  Undoubtedly a pure coincidence.",1406592000,68,2995,4.844793713163065

But there are now other films available that explore the harmful effects of this blight upon the Earth that include results of peer-reviewed and other tests showing the extremely serious impact on the health of animals and potentially on human organs and life processes  as well as the massive financial damage it is doing to the family farmer by the mean-spirited,incredibly aggressive, unjust pursuit of patent protection followed by Monsanto's minions with devastating financial impacts on persons such as farmers who did no more than have farms located near other farms using Monsanto seeds and other products, whose plants and thereby their seeds contaminated by Monsanto's profit driven development of products that threaten the very existence of all life on earth.

Could we have expected anything less from a company that had Donald Rumsfeld push through the approval by the FDA of Aspartame, over the objections of the FDA's own studies showing its potential for human damage.

I am well aware over the arguments of food safety vs.the ability to feed the exponentially growing world population, but I side with quality of life rather with quantity and with good over evil empowered by political/monetary clout.",1406246400,38,1469,5.133891213389122

Jeremy uses his children to make us think about how our choices today will impact future generations. The film makes it clear that we have a right to know if the food we buy has been genetically modified.

6317838,5,B00J2PQY5E,Yep known this for awhile now. I personally did my own experiment. I have not been able to drink milk and eat most dairy since about 1999 or 2000. I recently bought some organic milk because I use to drink a lot of milk as a kid and teenager and then all of the sudden I can't drink it anymore. I asked myself what is going on? I said either I changed or the food has. Well the food has changed. I bought some organic milk and to my surprise no stomach issues. Bought some organic ice cream which is almost impossible to find and still no issues. Thank you GMO's for making me really sick. Thank you MONSANTO for being the most evil corporation on planet earth and making me real sick as well. If the people demand it and make a bigger market for it ORGANICS will grow. The people have to get educated first. If you don't want organic I certainly understand but at least label our food as GMO if it contains GMO's! The rest of us should be able to choose.,1406160000,144,955,4.139784946236559

8647503,5,B00J2PQY5E,"I liked the presentation of the information.  There's not much science in here, as another reviewer mentioned, but how could there be, when Monsato refuses to release is raw date on the science that was used to deem GMO's as safe?  What this documentary does do is bring awareness to the fact that as consumers, our biggest advantage is knowledge, and that knowledge is already being suppressed and distorted by Big Biotech.  It also serves as a motivator for change, because knowledge is never enough without inspired action.

If you need absolutely definitive scientific conclusions to convince you that GMOs are dangerous, you're not going to get it because that's not the way that it goes, and it kind of misses the point.  As one interviewee in the doc states, the genetic modification of the organism is of lesser concern to him than the implication that GM crops which are being drenched in poisons are probably transferring those poisons to humans upon consumption.

More information upon the environmental impact of pesticides, herbicides, and inorganic fertilizer would have been welcome, but I suppose you can learn about that in other documentaries, such as PLANEAT.",1527811200,,1178,5.077720207253886

The film makes the case for the basic need to go GMO-free or at the very LEAST label GMO foods (which is common sense and common consensus). The film explores why it has been so hard for our government to pass basic laws to regulate GMO foods (basically greedy corporations with money). I was shocked to learn that the largest seed producers are chemical companies! WTF! Another reason why congress and our government is losing credibility.

The film does lack more solid scientific health data to say that GMOs are detrimental to our health even though it does site the many countries that ban them. I don't think this is the film's fault, but rather simply because the research aren't there yet (i think).",1517097600,,842,4.6066666666666665
