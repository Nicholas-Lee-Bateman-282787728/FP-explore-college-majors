8438042,5,B004QC6HFA,I'm an elementary school teacher and I love this video series for my students. Beautiful videos that help with students who may have creative blocks or apprehension with art education. This series of short videos approximately 5 minutes each it Is also a great way to fill-in those last-minute time gaps. These are high-quality videos that I would recommend them to my peers.,1474848000,,375,4.968253968253968
