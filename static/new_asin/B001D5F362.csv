8291713,5,B001D5F362,"I recently discovered Arnaldo Antunes through the group Tribalistas. I'm extremely glad I discovered this artist. His music is very diverse. When Arnaldo Antunes was singer/ songwriter for the group Titas most of their music was (hard)rock and punk. His first solo albums also contained a lot of rock and punk. But it was always very melodic. His work with Tribalistas showed more of his softer side. This DVD follows in the same vein. This is very melodic music accompanied with accoustic guitars etcetera. If you understand portugese you 'll see the lyrics are also great. My advice is to buy the DVD and not the cd as it contains a lot more songs.
In the last years I haven't heard any album worth 5 stars, this is the exception.",1350864000,,732,4.638461538461539
