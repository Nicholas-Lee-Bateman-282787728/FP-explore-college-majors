The movie itself is not an assault against Jews as much as it is a warning of the dangers of the unrestrained privatization of public assets. It is surprising to see this warning, coming from over 75 years ago. We general associate the ravages of privatization with the perceived modern phenomena of globalization. This movie reinforces the truism that greed is as old as man.

I think the main failing of the movie is the failure to distinguish between Judaism and Zionism, but that point may have been lost in the translation.

There is also the question of the relevance of Hitler's social policies prior to his ascendance to absolute power. Remember, he destroyed unions, attacked teachers and journalists, imposed iron clad rule over the judiciary... all of these actions consistent with what are perceived to be modern globalist policies. Wide scale privatizations could have been a factor in German life during the early days of the Third Reich, around the time this film was made.

I agree that this movie has significant value as an educational tool.",1210723200,6,1180,4.855721393034826
2968338,5,B000WGLADS,"Archiv-DVD's newest release, ""Jud Suss: Holocaust Studies Series"" is the definitive Holocaust collection which features the uncut version of Veit Harlan's vicious anti-Semitic costume epic.  For anyone to suggest this film had very little to do with the heinous crimes committed by the Nazis is not only scandalous but a slur against the slain six million during the Holocaust.  This is perhaps the only motion picture produced during the Third Reich which encompasses the true anti-Semitic ideology expounded under National Socialism.  Much of the screenplay was obviously penned by Goebbels with suggestions by Rosenberg and Streicher.  This single film was the cornerstone and exponent of the pre-launching of the official campaign against the Jews of Germany and then Nazi Occupied Europe from 1940 onwards.  It is certainly no coincidence nor accident that Goebbels ordered this film produced as early as 1938.  And it is neither a coincidence either than Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler ordered the entire SS and uniformed police to screen the film prior to going into active service on the Eastern Front by the coming Winter 1940.
This film was as well heavily screened in European areas prior to any official anti-Jewish aktion against the local population.  It was also heavily screened to SS guards and camp personnel at all the Nazi concen-tration/extermination camps.  One does not have to have much of an imgaination what the end results were.  And it is certainly no surprise to anyone that this film was entered into as evidence for the prosecution at the International Military Tribunal (The Nuermberg Trails) during 1945-1946.  Its director was tried twice for ""Crimes against Humanity"" for creating the film and acquitted twice.  It was agreed that the original negative be destroyed following the trial.  This never happened.  It is no suprise as well that this film is still banned by the German Govern-ment to this day as an official law exists banning this specific film.
I thoroughly suggest this film as an excellant example of Nazi anti-Semitic propaganda in the way art can be twisted to fit ideology, no matter how tainted it may be.  ""Jud Suss"" was quite obviously a celluloid blueprint for genocide no matter how subtle other reviewers may claim in their own naive opinion.",1204675200,14,2304,5.175202156334231

8223168,4,B000WGLADS,"It is not easy to assign a star rating to this anti-Semitic propaganda film, but I will give it four.  The production values and acting are equal to a big budgeted Hollywood production; it is solidly put together and has a good dramatic flow; you get involved in the characters and their motivations.  But when you consider the motive behind the enterprise was to stir up hatred against the Jewish people, to identify them as a parasitic race, to justify their destruction, you may feel rather nauseated.  I'll say this:  if there had been no identification of the lead villain as Jewish, if all the anti-Semitic slander had been eliminated, this still would be a well-mounted melodramatic costume picture about an unscrupulous, shifty villain who worms his way to be toadying Treasurer to the Duke of Wurttemberg.  He taxes the citizens just for carting wagons on the streets, and uses his power to crush any critics.  Everyone hates him, but because he is helping the Duke to get richer, he is protected.  Eventually, of course, he meets his downfall, pleading loudly that he was just doing his duty, before getting his just deserts.  Ferdinand Marian, of Austrian extraction, plays Suss as a slimy but clever scoundrel, with an oily voice and fluttering gesticulations, always scheming to increase his own wealth and power, also to get his people into the all-Gentile city.  Veit Harlan directs the melodramatic story with assurance.  The print from Holocaust Studies has a remarkably good picture and sound.  This film is a valuable document of Nazi propaganda that ought to be widely seen and discussed.",1462665600,,1608,4.962686567164179

8223170,5,B000WGLADS,"~It's a wonder in today's economic-tyranny that such a splendid specimen of Nazi-era b&w-cinematography is being allowed public viewing,  -as it very concisely depicts how the Talmudicly brainwashed Hebrews have gone about subversively infiltrating every Anglo/Aryan nation with their greed-driven schemes to divide & concur naive non-Hebrews.  This should not be confused as anti-Semitic, -which inane term is actually a flagellant misnomer (80% of Jews are non-Semitics!) concocted by the Beni'Berith Zionist-agents when the Rothschilds cunningly hyjacked our usTreasury in 1913, and swiftly installed their subversive so-called FederalReserve-sys. & IRS-henchmen, as well as their notorious ADL.  Sadly, the resulting globalist America of today is a pathetic warmongering remnant of our founders great quest to liberate us from the ever conniving Rothschild-bank'sters;  --much as Chancellor-Hitler strove to liberate the noble, albeit now 'Jew-occupied' nation of Germany, from the perverse subversion of Hebrew bank'sterism, in the form of both revealed anti-social Communism and Capitalism.
The film begins with coronation of Karl'Alexander, Duke of W&uuml;rttemberg, a selfish man whom has fooled the people, -and deceptively swears an oath to obey the laws of the dukedom- ""according to traditional W&uuml;rttemberg loyalty & honesty"".  However, the Duke soon becomes frustrated because W&uuml;rttemberg's provincial Council righteously refuses him the funds needed to maintain a lifestyle comparable to his neighboring sovereigns;  --in particular, he wants a personal-bodyguard, and opera/ballet group.  Yet lacking funds even to purchase coronation-gifts for the Duchess,  the self-engrossed Duke foolishly sends a courtier to Frankfurt to borrow money from a devious Jew named- Joseph S&uuml;&szlig; Oppenheimer (-agent of Rothschilds).  The sly Jew Su$$ soon suckers the gullible Duke so deep in debt that this Trustee of the Public-faith is induced by the Jew to impose nasty Jew-taxes, which disrupt the natural process of free-enterprise economics, -which had enabled the happily well-managed township to prosper without the adverse oppression of Property-taxes!
Unfortunately, had this film been allowed to screen in 1940-America,  --its revelations echoed by highly regarded HenryFord and Chas. A.Lindbergh would have doubtlessly prevented the tragedy of Jew-promoted WW2, -which was essentially genocide upon Aryans.
Today, most astute individuals are aware that the Hebrews powerful propaganda-machine (-which includes print-publishing, and FCC-controlled Radio/TV-stations as well as our usPublic-Libraries!), -had zealously brainwashed the public into believing the Jews outlandishly hateful anti-German 12-zillion Jew-deaths by transformation into lampshades & soap!
In summation, it is good that this historic educational-film is reemerging, whereby great free-enterprise organizations, such as Amazon-com and YouTube.com, and usConstitution supported free-speech, --enable ethical public-discussion to prevail despite constant efforts by so-called 'progressive liberals' (aka:  democrats/communist) to deny us our right to express our opinion in the manner we are doing here.  ThankYou for your thoughtful consideration of my historic viewpoint...
Sincerely,  ~Robair of So. Calif.

8223171,5,B000WGLADS,"Joseph S Oppenheimer was a German Jewish banker who was executed in 1738, as a result of charges brought by the many enemies he had made in making his fortune.

His story was the subject of many literary treatments, most notably Lion Feuchtwanger's 1925 novel titled Jud S.  Feuchtwanger was Jewish, and an outspoken opponent of Nazism, and his portrayal of Oppenheimer was very sympathetic.  In 1934, Lothar Mendes directed a film adaptation of the novel.

Goebbels, the Reich Minister of Propaganda, commissioned a new film version, partly to counteract the Mendes film.  The result, Jud S, made in 1940 by Veit Harlan, is very remarkable in many respects.  For one thing, the film is surprisingly entertaining.  It is fast-paced, well acted and the crowd scenes are (for the time) very well done.  This is in stark contrast to the usual propaganda films (see Der Ewige Jude, for example, also made in 1940 at the behest of Goebbels, and which is laughably bad).  One can imagine members of the SS, who were required to see this film, groaning at the thought of having to sit through another propaganda film, being pleasantly surprised as this action-filled costume drama unfolded.

The film is also remarkable for its moral ambiguity.  The gentile characters, including the hero - the romantic lead - are really unsympathetic, whereas the Jewish characters - including the title character - come across quite favorably.  The propaganda message - intentionally or not - is that corrupt politicians are more to blame for the social and economic problems than are Jewish bankers.

This DVD is a 2-disc package with many extras.  The film print is excellent.  In so many ways, this is a film worth seeing.",1370736000,,1704,4.9298245614035086
8223172,4,B000WGLADS,"First the pluses.  This is a very good print.  The subtitling is generally excellent with a few exceptions.  The film itself, Veit Harlan's ""Instrument of Murder"" (according to his son Thomas Harlan), is a historical document that should be shown in schools today but alas is not.  I did not give it a 5 star because of my disappointment with the bonus features.  There are excerpts from several other Nazi anti-Semitic films, Robert & Bertram, The Rothschilds, Linen From Ireland, The Fuehrer Gives the Jews a City, The Eternal Jew and Vienna 1910 but there were no English subtitles.  That was disappointing and since my German is somewhat poor, it made the bonus features not nearly as useful as they could be.  The was also the promise of an historical essay entitled Jud Suss and the Holocaust by German film historian David Calvert Smith.  I was told to access a website to see it.  The website no longer exists.  So yes, I was frustrated.  However, I still recommend this product because of the quality of the print, the titles (which were better than the ""Deluxe Restored Edition"") and the ability to see excerpts from some seldom seen films.  Brush up on your German for those!  I also recommend GermanWarFilms  .com for those who are interested in German cinema 1933-45.

8223173,2,B000WGLADS,"Watching propaganda films produced by the Nazis has been an eye opening experience in terms of the measure of hate by which they operated for so many years. What is most disconcerting is that modern anti-semitism is the product of an earlier christian anti-semitism which included the infamous ""blood libel"" pogroms where jews were accused of murdering gentile children and using their blood as an ingredient in passover matzos. Why such hate for a people who have contributed so much to the world? I'll never know as long as I live!",1264982400,,533,4.868131868131868
8223174,5,B000WGLADS,"I loved ""Jud Suss,"" both the film and the character.

Loving this movie was disturbing. ""Jud Suss"" was commissioned and overseen by Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda minister and Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War. The film was shown before Nazis began rounding up Jews. ""Jud Suss"" played a direct, horrific, role in the Holocaust. You can't talk about this film without that nightmare hovering over every word you say.

I ended up writing a long essay entitled ""Loving Jud Suss."" The essay is now linked from my homepage. I hope interested readers will have a look and share their thoughts. I'll try to convey the gist here.

First, this is a well-made, vintage, costume melodrama slash swashbuckler. If you like Golden Age, black-and-white, big budget, studio adaptations of popular novels set in the eighteenth century, chances are you could enjoy many aspects of this film: palace intrigue, fast pace, romance, period detail.

I watched ""Jud Suss"" as if on split screens. The Nazis want the viewer to see an amoral, crafty Jew who destroys the life of a German city, Stuttgart, by introducing ballet, flirtation, and parties, by instituting a tax to improve the region's poor roads, and by allowing Jews entry to the city. I resisted what the Nazis wanted me to see. I like ballet. I live in a state with toll roads; good roads have to be paid for somehow. I don't think that allowing Jews, or any minority, out of their ghetto and into previously segregated neighborhoods is a bad thing.

I could *also* see what the Nazis did not want me to see. I could see how the film lays bare the self pity, sense of personal victimization, and exaggerated view of the power of the other that is at the heart of racism and prejudice. The main German characters in ""Jud Suss"" are pathetic. Faber is a ninety-pound weakling and insufferable bigot. He can't even consummate a kiss, never mind a marriage, with his beloved, Dorothea. Dorothea is beautiful but simpleminded and insincere. She wants Suss but can't handle her own desire. Councilman Sturm, Rader, and Duke Karl Alexander are all obese, shouting, ineffectual old men. That Nazis held up blowhard Sturm and prissy bigot Faber as the heroes of the piece tells you how skewed - and how foreign to our modern sensibilities - was the Nazi value system.

In seeing both what the Nazis wanted me to see and what they did not want me to see, I could see the absurdity and ethical and intellectual bankruptcy of Nazi ideology. That exercise made this one of the most fascinating film watching experiences I've ever had.

Ferdinand Marian, as Joseph Suss-Oppenheimer, made this movie. He is onscreen for almost the entire film; even when he is not, he is the super potent center of others' attention. Marian's is one of the most riveting, charismatic performances I've ever seen. I could not take my eyes off him from his first scene to the last.

Off-screen events add to the unforgettable quality of Marian's performance. The story is that Marian did not want to take this role, and was so distraught when Goebbels forced him into it that he got drunk and destroyed his own apartment with an ax. Marian died in a car accident, and the rumor is that he killed himself, because of this role and its horrible history.

All the principles involved in ""Jud Suss"" made some excuse or another to try to get out of it. Goebbels tightened the screws and forced them into it. They later claimed that they did everything they could to make Suss as sympathetic as possible under the circumstances.

I read Ferdinand Marian's ""Jud Suss"" as an unforgettably sympathetic character. Even as I was watching the film, even as I was seeing it on a split screen, with the Nazi version on one side and my own interpretation on another, I also saw the tumultuous surrounding events. I saw the real Joseph Suss Oppenheimer, an historical figure who was tortured and executed in eighteenth-century Stuttgart. His killers kept his body on display for six years. I saw Ferdinand Marian, the actor, forced to act in a film he wanted no part of. I saw Jud Suss, the character in the movie, a lone Jew surrounded by bigoted, narrow, primitive proto-Nazis who made his, and their own lives, a misery, because they insisted that only Jews could be so perverse as to bring culture, modernity, and eroticism to a decent, clean, lifeless German city. My sympathy overflowed for Suss the character, Marian the actor, and the historical Suss-Oppenheimer. A Nazi propaganda film achieved the feat of rendering the German characters in the film universally repulsive, and the one Jewish character irresistibly sympathetic. That being the case, it's all the more tragic that Marian ended his own life over this role.

Scholars emphasize the charisma and appeal of Marian's depiction. In fact, the director, Veit Harlan, reported that Marian received ""baskets of love letters."" It is more than a bit weird that one of the sexiest overtly Jewish characters in the history of cinema is a character in a Nazi propaganda film.",1255651200,12,5031,4.818076477404404

8223177,3,B000WGLADS,"Today's viewers would probably see this film as a mean-spirited but almost comical anti-Semitic creation--certainly no less stereotypical or racist than some of the much-praised stuff by Spike Lee, among others. Suss comes across as a medieval Gordon Gecko or Bud Fox, manipulating the system for his own gain until things backfire and stuff hits the fan, causing his own downfall. The star-gazing rabbi, whom Suss lures into the plot, is portrayed (I feel somewhat sympathetically)as one who is cynical of Suss's motives and scheme and who tries to dissuade him and to urge him to return to his orthodox roots. I think that this movie is actually pretty tame stuff, as hard-core anti-Semitic works go, and probably is a lot less infammatory than the filth created by the degenerate pornographer Jules Streicher.",1217116800,3,812,5.112781954887218
