A must see for anyone who has ever removed , or who would like to remove, themselves from the ""real world"" and go for an extended hike.",1398902400,,252,4.883720930232558
5683676,5,B00C169EH6,"Another wonderful hiking film from Scott Herriott,

Scott Herriott is a wonderful filmmaker who brings his own sense of adventure and tells his own story without getting in the way of the journeys he seeks to document. He never takes himself too seriously and the product he creates makes the viewer part of the adventure because he helps us see it through the eyes of ""real people.""

I met Scott on the Appalachian Trail when I was thru-hiking in 2011 and was delighted to be a part of his documentary ""Flip Flop Flippin."" I have watched a lot of trail movies, but this one truly captured the spirit and the love (yes) that makes the AT what it is. The people are awesome and so is the adventure -- Scott told that story extremely well.  I was also in Flip Flop Flippin' 2, telling my side of what it's like to be a ridgerunner on the Appalachian Trail.  I was delighted with this film, too.

I also loved Wayfaring, another Scott Herriott movie,  and it really makes me want to hike the Camino. I loved Wayfaring (like Scott's AT movies) because of the people in the films and the charming way that Scott helps them tell their stories. I have toyed with the Camino hike and Wayfaring really took me there and stoked my interest in travelling abroad. The scenery was amazing and I loved the interviews with the wonderful cast of pilgrims and those in the villages along the way.

Thanks, Scott, for the Flip Flop Flippin' films because it documents an important chapter of my life. Thanks for Wayfaring because I now have a look into my future.",1393372800,,1545,4.496428571428571

5683678,5,B00C169EH6,I've seen every A.T. documentary in the last 20 years and this is one of the most entertaining. You really get the feel of what it's really like on the trail.,1377043200,,158,4.129032258064516
5683679,5,B00C169EH6,"Great service. I could not believe how quickly this movie arrived in my mailbox.
Fun movie. I would like to see the Flip Flop Flippin 1. The trail would be the trip of a lifetime.",1375574400,,179,4.142857142857143
5683680,5,B00C169EH6,"Just got done watching 'flip flop flippin' 2'-an App Trail documentary by Squatch aka Scott Herriott. It is the best AT documentary I've seen! Check it out at [...], this movie is about 121 minutes and highly entertaining, Gets ya in the mood to hit the trail,  I don't know Scott personally but I first learned of him from his Pacific crest trail films which are  also excellent, I work in the IT business and after a stressful day watching one of these flicks lowers your blood pressure and absolutely relaxes you,  also I want to mention I bought the Blu ray version and some of the scenery really pops, especially the bugs and animals, I recommend watching one flick and promise you the other hiking films at [...] are also very good.",1364428800,,738,4.533834586466165
5683681,5,B00C169EH6,"It is more than worth the extra money to buy the blu-ray version. The crew carried high def cameras and made some pretty amazing shots on the Trail.

Ever since I thru-hiked the AT in 2006 I've been looking for a documentary that would give me the same feeling I've had while I was out there. After more than a dozen I can say without a doubt that this one does the best job. If you're scouring Amazon looking for a documentary you may be saying to yourself ""Oh-there's one by National Geographic, they're professional, I should get that one."" Don't. As great as Nat Geo usually is it falls flat on its face compared to this movie.

This movie shows the contradictions that often accompany life on the Trail. You'll see gatherings of hikers with people playing music and having fun in town right beside the total quiet and beauty found on lone mountain tops. You get a great sense of the different reasons people come out to hike, and the different ways people choose to live their life on the Trail. (No other documentary has shown how younger hikers are more socially oriented while older hikers are often calmer and out for the nature.)

The movie is filmed in HD--if you have blu-ray it is worth getting it! The quality of the video really immerses you in the film. There were several points where I felt choked up because it brought me so close to my thru-hike. You will love this movie!",1364428800,,1392,4.47244094488189

5683683,5,B00C169EH6,"Having enjoyed the first ""Flip, Flop, Flippin'"" and some of Herriott's previous 'Walk' themed films, I knew I'd be entertained and inspired, but there's a quality and density in this one that you don't want to miss. Sprawling vistas (beautifully edited with really charming music selections) are interspersed with all kinds of goofy trail-side revelry, non-staged, impromptu interviews, and the occasional how-to and don't-do dispensed by interesting hiker folk from all over, not to mention all ages & levels of fitness/unfitness. Flip, Flop, Flippin' apparently refers to a method of hiking the trail, but it also seems to aptly describe the film and even the rollercoaster experience of the Appalachian Trail itself -- the rapturous beauty, the climbing and climbing and climbing, the characters, the animals, the exhilaration, the pain, the friendships, the ticks... well, you get the idea.

Though fairly downplayed, we also see Herriott's own challenges -- returning to the trail after apparently being laid up by a tendon issue then some repeated hospital time (some hilarious images of which are inserted in the film). And did I mention there are bears? Oh yeah! CUTE frolicking BABY bears! And frogs, and tiny little spotted deer, and extremely creepy crawly things with thousands of legs. But I digress...

Whether you're an avid hiker or a couch potato -- you'll love it.
It's JUST PLAIN ENTERTAINING.",1364256000,2,1412,5.243362831858407
5683684,5,B00C169EH6,"Loved this documentary. All the Flip Flop Flippin documentaries are fun to watch. If you are planning a thru-hike , a backpacking trip or are just interested in long distance hiking these documentaries will get you excited. I'm planning a thru-hike this March and I have watched each of these at least 3 times already and its only November.",1448409600,,340,4.779661016949152

5683689,5,B00C169EH6,This is a great video if you like hiking adventures and you like to see real people doing real things. It is not a movie with actors or a dry documentary about hiking the AT. It is well made and captures the personality of many real hikers that have the drive to Through Hike the AT. It is interesting and comical due to the people that tell their stories about the trail. I loved it enough to watch both and will be watching the third when it is available.,1419811200,,457,4.146067415730337

8576135,4,B00C169EH6,This is a great documentary about the atmosphere and the type of people you meet on the trail. It did not have as much trail scenery and information as I thought it would. Still a great documentary for those looking into hiking the AT.,1472428800,,235,4.363636363636363
