7981090,2,B00008AORZ,"I purchased this DVD for the movie ""And Then There Were None.""  I loved the Agatha Christie novel and wanted to see the movie.  However, the sound is so difficult to understand even at high volume that I had to give up watching it.  I understand and enjoy most old movies even with poor picture quality; this was the poorest one I've seen.  On picture quality alone I wouldn't say this is a problematic DVD, but because it seems impossible to understand, I'd have to recommend skipping this one and finding one with restored sound.  The movie itself however is probably much better than two stars; the two stars are for sound and picture quality only.",1129161600,16,651,4.577586206896552
7981091,5,B00008AORZ,"This is a single sided DVD which contains three mystery/suspense thrillers.  1)'And Then There Were None'; Barry Fitzgerald, Walter Huston, Louis Hayward; 97 minutes, B&W: Based on the Agatha Christie classic, a mysterious host invites ten guests to an old house by the sea. When the quests end up being killed off one by one, terror and suspicion run amuck. Who will be next, why are they being killed off, and who is the killer?  2)'Cry Panic'; John Forsythe, Earl Holliman, Anne Francis; 74 minutes, Color: Driving through a small town, a man accidentally hits a pedestrian and kills him. In trying to get assistance with the accident, the body disappears. No one in town, not even the sheriff, is willing to admit that anything happened. What secrets are they hiding and how far will they go to protect those secrets?  3)'The Bat'; Vincent Price, Agnes Moorehead; 79 minutes, B&W; In this old dark house mystery a killer has invaded the rented mansion of a mystery novelist and her guests. One by one, the guests are being killed off as the Bat flies. What is the motive of the Bat? Is there something hidden in the mansion? And, perhaps more sinister, who is the Bat?  These are three very good suspense movies. 'And Then There Were None' is one of the best among mystery movies. The quality of the DVD is good. I have a 20"" TV and they look as good if not better than VHS. Among the American Home Treasures triple feature DVDs, this is the best of what I have seen. The bonus material includes filmographies of the stars, biographies, and trivia. I have just given teasers based on the jacket descriptions. The premise of mystery movies is not to know what is going to happen so you can get caught up in the mystery.-Bob",1100044800,46,1726,4.5941558441558445
