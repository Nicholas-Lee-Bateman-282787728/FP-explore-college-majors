8641887,5,B00IFRMX8W,"I'm an avid movie goer and recently joined Amazon Prime, mostly for the free deliveries, but also to see as many free movies as possible. I have Netflix and Vimeo as well.  I stumbled upon this movie one night while going through the catalog and found the premise interesting enough to give it a try.  From the opening scene (what an opening!) to the end credits I was glued to my tv set.  I have a Firestick and was able to watch it on my 65"" high def with surround sound. This movie exceeded my expectations for an independent and I will be watching it again with my wife. If you like layers of ""WTF"" embedded in a movie plot, then this one is for you. Kudos to the writer!!",1505347200,3,676,4.184615384615385
