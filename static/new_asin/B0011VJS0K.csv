8242642,5,B0011VJS0K,"I bought this set as a gift for my grandpa who loved Red Skelton. He always listened to his old skits on audio cassettes when I was little and laughed hysterically (which otherwise never happened). Now he spends a lot of time in front of the flat-screen, so when I saw this set I had to buy it. From all accounts he absolutely loves it and laughs like he did all those years ago. Anything that can do that is worth every penny to me. Would recommend as a gift to those in their golden years and loved Red Skelton.",1363046400,,513,4.14

Our grandchildren watched one of them and because some of the jokes were based on the culture of Red's days, they did not get all of it but it was a lot of fun to watch for us.",1281052800,,284,3.7966101694915255
8242645,4,B0011VJS0K,"Unfortunately, the final Skelton series Christmas broadcast (an annual tradition) is NOT included in this package. Season 20 therefore consists of 23 (not 24) programs.

Cancelled after nearly two decades on the CBS network, THE RED SKELTON SHOW moved back to Red's original television home, NBC-TV for one final season. As in the early 1950s, each of these broadcasts is 30 minutes. The Skelton show's long-time announcer, Art Gilmore is here along with the David Rose orchestra. NBC (and other) celebs also appear.

8242646,2,B0011VJS0K,"I am not a huge fan of Red Skelton's but this set sounded interesting and the price was low.

 Unfortunately,from what I have watched, it is no surprize this early 70s show at the nadir of Red's career was short lived.

The opening monologues are dated and listless, the comedy sketches seem trite , forced and lame - Skelton often tries to break up his guests and this makes much of it seem amateurish. This is unlike the breakups on CAROL BURNETT where the the professionals try to keep in character.

 And even with these being variety shows , the musical guest like Cass Elliott et al are not allowed to sing..

Unless you are a diehard fan , avoid this set",1226188800,5,661,4.377049180327869
