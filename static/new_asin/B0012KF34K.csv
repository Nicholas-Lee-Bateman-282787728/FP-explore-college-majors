3090819,4,B0012KF34K,"too new agey for me but a good workout and change of pace. I bought this from goodwill used. great condition, less than $5. can't beat that price. Music is silly to me and I feel like a hippy. I found I had no flexibility and envy those ladies. Again, not my thing but I did feel the burn.",1404086400,3,289,3.9152542372881354

3090823,5,B0012KF34K,"This is my favorite work-out video ever. I have the motivational statements from this video going through my head as I go to the gym as well. I recently ordered this again because I thought I had lost my copy but I ended up finding it so I cancelled the order. However, they said the cancellation was not guaranteed even though I had ordered it late at night and cancelled within an hour or so since I was sorting through boxes.",1373932800,,428,4.296296296296297
3090824,5,B0012KF34K,"I am a HUGE fan of BeachBody products, especially Yoga Booty Ballet. As a prior owner of the product, I am very pleased with how it is equally effective as it is 'feminine', if you will, not to say that a man cannot benefit from this video. It'll definitely have you 'feeling it', especially in the advanced section. This is a workout video that I can actually say I look forward to because of how its modified to make one feel 'sexy' before one actually begins to look that way. Once you purchase the DVD, you'll understand just what I mean. I lost my first one in a move so I was quite excited to order it again - PROBLEM??- The manufacturer sent me the wrong disc. Imagine my disappointment. Not only was it the wrong disc, but the DVD inside was actually filthy. Being a used product, I expected perhaps a scratch on the case or maybe even figerprints on the disc but this was just ridiculous. This product is definitely worth the buy, even if you have to get it new to be on the safe side, but if you do purchase from this vendor, buyers beware!!!!",1300320000,6,1053,4.296482412060302

8246449,5,B0012KF34K,"My absolute favorite workout dvd, and one that I never get tired of. The exercises are deceptively simple, but will totally kick your butt if you're not ready for them. My favorite section is definitely the ballet (who knew holding your leg in the air was so damned hard?) I feel so graceful when I do these workouts!",1478044800,,317,4.482758620689655

8246452,1,B0012KF34K,I should have had lower expectations. This one is tough to get through. It is dated and views of moves are not well done.,1446940800,,121,4.083333333333333
8246453,5,B0012KF34K,"I bought this a long time ago from half price books and I think my step mom stole it from me, well anyway I was so pleased with it that I ordered another one because I loved the core workout with the ball and all of the dance yoga and of course the ballet sections as well. I can honestly say that I have no complaints on this video whatsoever! You can workout to this video at any level, there are more simple workouts, warmups and of course higher level as well, you will be greatly satisfied I can guarentee it! :)",1433635200,2,517,4.078431372549019
8246454,5,B0012KF34K,"One of my favorite workouts.  New agey, but effective.  I'd originally purchased this in the early 2000s, the set with the little rubber ball, but a pillow works just as well.  Lost that DVD and got a great price on a replacement.",1427414400,,230,4.428571428571429
8246455,5,B0012KF34K,Amazing DVD!! Used the set years ago and recently pulled them out post pregnancy. Had two babies in two years. Still a challenge. You'll get toned and gain strength and flexibility without feeling like you're punishing yourself with a workout.,1425168000,,243,5.1
8246456,5,B0012KF34K,its exactly as I thought a great workout,1422316800,,40,4.125
