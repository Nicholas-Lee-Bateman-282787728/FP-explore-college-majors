7831413,5,6302794498,I saw this movie about 30 years ago and have been wanting a copy ever since. The cast it top-notch and the plot will keep you guessing till the very end. And I mean the VERY end. I wish so bad I could buy this movie on Amazon or watch it thru my video rental service. It would be worth every penny!,1375401600,,298,3.8225806451612905
7831414,5,6302794498,Been looking for some way to purchase this film. Saw it when it came out - made such an impression that years later we're still trying to resurrect a copy from anywhere - no luck yet. If you stop watching anywhere short of the very end then you'll have robbed yourself of a delicious treat!,1309478400,,290,4.290909090909091
7831415,5,6302794498,"This is a excellent story and mystery based on a missing wife, yet a wife appears who isn't the wife? Similar storyline in One Of My Wives Is Missing, and based on a play before that. This time it's based in the winter, in another small town. Good cast with Elliott Gould, Fred Gwynne and Margot Kidder. If you liked this film, also see One Of My Wives Is Missing, a bit better, with James Franciscus, Jack Klugman and Elizabeth Ashley. That 1976 film was same storyline, but set in a lake resort town (filmed at Lake Arrowhood, CA.) Vanishing Act never released on dvd, therefore the price remains high if you can find the VHS. One of my Wives Is Missing was briefly released on dvd, but long out of print now. Good luck finding either. But very good movies, and good surprises at the end solving the mystery.",1301961600,,810,4.406666666666666
7831416,5,6302794498,"This is just a great movie.  It will keep you guessing and ""choosing sides"".  Great casting.  I would love to have a copy on DVD.",1278892800,5,129,4.08
7831417,5,6302794498,"Made for TV movie I saw the first time in the 80's. I was so impressed with the story/plot. Rarely does a movie ""bug"" me as I watch it, but this one did. Just couldn't figure out what was going on. Everytime you think you have a clue, they throw a twist in it and your back to saying,""What is going on!!""

Seen it priced here this time ""USED"" for $129.00 but a year or so back I saw it selling as ""NEW"" for like $85.00. I bought the cheapest one ""USED"" and hope the quality will allow me to convert it to DVD so I can play it easier. VHS is on life support. Soon, it will be my kids ""8 Track Tape"".",1278288000,2,598,3.8225806451612905
7831418,4,6302794498,"What do the male leads in this 1986 mystery/intrigue sleeper have in common? If you answered, ""They both are veterans of the 4077,"" (Elliott Gould in the movie and Mike Farrell in the subsequent TV series) you win the Kewpie Doll!  Oops! Sorry! The prizes have disappeared!
Farrell is Harry Kenyon, newlywed honeymooning in a quaint Rockies village. But the new Mrs. Kenyon has disappeared. Or has she?  Gould is the Police Lieutenant on the case who would much rather be back home in NYC.  There's also Fred Gwynne as the Priest who not only cannot find Car 54, but appears unfamiliar with Saint Thomas Aquinas -  and the Super Margot Kidder, apparently having an identity crisis pre-dating her recent confusion in Beverly Hills.
The beginning of this film reminded me a little of the later quirky ""Fargo"" especially Lt. Rudameyer's preoccupation with that Deli sandwich. But at least the folks in Fargo know how to drive on winter roads. What WAS San Franciscan Kenyon thinking driving like that?",1023840000,3,998,4.887573964497041
