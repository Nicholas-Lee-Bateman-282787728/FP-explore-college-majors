2998582,5,B000X5ICO8,Great work-outs! He keeps me motivated and 30 minutes is perfect in my busy schedule! Thanks!,1254700800,5,93,4.875
2998583,5,B000X5ICO8,"The power half hour series backs up all of the work I put into the power 90 system.  Many of the same moves and some new ones are incorporated into each workout...I love the stretches at the end of the four days!  The workouts are still under an hour-Tony's motto is ""Power and shower in under an hour!""  I love these workouts!",1240531200,11,327,4.241935483870968
2998584,5,B000X5ICO8,"While Tony Horton comes across as a little bit on the corny side, these workouts rock. They do work. I own them and incorporate them in with my Turbo Jam schedule when I want a challenge. You will reshape with this set. Get ready to do lunges, squats and lung-kick combos, because there are plenty of them in here...If you're having trouble with balancing, simply use a chair. The ab workout is EXCELLENT...These programs work, and I'm going to try Power 90 next...

You've got to get past the corny bit, but at least you'll get a good laugh out of it...This trainer knows what he's doing...If I had young kids, I'd get the set for kids, because he strikes me as being an excellent motivator for young people too.",1231891200,15,713,4.484615384615385
2998585,5,B000X5ICO8,"This DVD set is incredible!  I don't know how Tony Horton packs such an
intense workout within each 30 minute DVD, but you absolutely get your
money's worth.  Everytime I do these exercises, my problem areas totally
reshape, and I'm amazed by my increased stamina and endurance.  If you
want to incorporate a short, challenging exercise system into your busy
lifestyle, power half hour is worth considering.  It even comes with a
training guide that contains several customized programs focused on the
specific areas of your body you want to target.  I would rate it at about
4 and 1/2 stars...I shaded in 5 stars because it wouldn't allow me to
fill in the half for 4 and 1/2, and it's definitely better than 4 stars.

The power half hour sets for sale on amazon seem a little pricy.  You can
purchase them directly from beachbody's website for $39.90 plus $4.95 for
shipping and a couple more dollars for sales tax (depending on your
state's sales tax).  It won't cost more than $48 or $49.  However, the
sellers on amazon are charging at least that amount. Plus, you have to pay
an additional $3.00 for shipping.  Just trying to save you a few dollars!",1216425600,58,1155,4.617647058823529

8226943,4,B000X5ICO8,"I like half-hour workouts...if I feel like working out longer I do two of them...otherwise a half-hour fits in my busy day.  The workouts are as hard as you want them to be.  Thigh Trimmer and the Abs workout have a bit more of a cardio element to them.  The arms workout is the only one that uses weights or exercise bands (the exercises are shown with both options).  You could add weights to the buns and/or the thigh workouts to make them harder.

Tony is fun, and the background exercisers have good form.  I love these workouts.  This was actually a replacement for my first Power Half Hour DVD that I loaned to someone and never got it back.  This one won't be leaving my house!",1383004800,,685,4.338582677165355
8226944,5,B000X5ICO8,Incredibly effective workout video. I first borrowed one from a friend and soon realized how much more interesting my workout can be with a good coach as Tony Horton. He makes it much more fun and easier to get motivated. After ordering this video I soon received it and now enjoy my daily workout with Tony and company. Thanks,1382572800,,327,4.559322033898305
8226945,5,B000X5ICO8,"This gets me going in the morning. I'm not in the best shape, but I'm getting better. Tony doesn't make you feel like an idiot, he says over and over again to do what's right for you. None the less, you can help push yourself harder... he makes it look fun, and cracks jokes along the way. I got this as a pre-cursor to the P90X series b/c I read another review that says you have to be in decent shape before you can start this, and this DVD / workouts certainly do it. I've probably done 8) 30min workouts so far and my family has already noticed a difference. Working out at home is awesome - you can grunt, sweat, look like crap and no one is there to judge you. You can also just walk downstairs and save time driving to the gym. It wakes me up, gives me that encouraged self-control throughtout the day, and is awesome. I look forward to trying more of his workouts.",1377129600,2,872,4.165680473372781
8226946,5,B000X5ICO8,Love this program . . . It gives you a great 30 minute workout and I can see the results. Working out is not my favorite thing to do but I can handle 30 minutes a day hitting those key areas. It was diffenately worth the money.,1373155200,,227,3.851063829787234
8226947,5,B000X5ICO8,"I bought this a while ago and only used it when I can't get to the gym . Tony's video is very good, I work out every day but that didn't quite prepare me for  his. I was exhusted after  working out with his DVD. I would definetly recommend this for any one that  is serious about working out .",1368748800,,293,3.85
8226948,3,B000X5ICO8,"I originally wanted to get P90x, but thought I might be too out of shape for that and I got this video instead. I'm so glad I did. It was perfect for me and I think I will be ready for P90x very soon. I was not happy with the condition of the DVD though. I bought it used for 60 bucks and you can get a new one for 70 or 75. It was cracked in the middle and looked very beat up. I am surprised it actually worked in my DVD player. I don't think I will ever buy a used DVD again.",1363478400,,478,3.5619047619047617
8226949,5,B000X5ICO8,Great video to get back in shape or do a quick 30 minute workout. All workouts are done without weights and they will still kick your but! Tony will teach you great moves you can do anywhere...even at work.,1347062400,,206,4.3076923076923075
8226950,5,B000X5ICO8,This is a great DVD for women especially if you only have a few minutes a day to get a workout in.  Got the DVD quickly and!,1334793600,,124,3.5925925925925926
8226951,5,B000X5ICO8,"I have done this program after having done P90X. It's a much lighter program and presents a few pros and cons but overall a great buy:
Pros:
- It is 30 mins, exactly not a minute more. Great if you are short on time.
- It incorporates all elements of workout including weight training, cardio and stretch, which for instance is missing from a program like supreme 90 Days.
- Requires limited equipment and can be done on the go.
- A single DVD for the entire program

Con:
- Does not incorporate pull up bars or similar exercise. The upper body portion is fair but could use an extra routine.

Overall good buy.",1324339200,8,611,4.350877192982456
8226952,3,B000X5ICO8,THIS WAS A SHORT VERSION AND NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT'D BE -  I RETURNED IT.,1287273600,,73,3.5625
