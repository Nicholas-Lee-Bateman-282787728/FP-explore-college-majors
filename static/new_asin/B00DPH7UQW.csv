5841326,5,B00DPH7UQW,"I can't really explain why I like this show. I ran across an episode of ""Ruby Gloom"" online, and I was hooked. The episodes are mostly light and silly (with a positive message), and the show is primarily aimed at a very young audience. But I get a kick out of the ""horror-cliches-as-normal"" premise. (Besides, where else can you encounter characters with names like ""Malady"" and ""Malaise""?) If you like offbeat cartoons, ""Ruby Gloom"" is worth a watch.",1429833600,,451,4.794871794871795
5841327,5,B00DPH7UQW,"This disk contains the following episodes:

Gloomates
Seeing Eye to Eyes
Name that Toon
Broken Records

If you are a fan of cartoons like Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, The Addams Family, or Friendship is Magic, chances are you'll love Ruby Gloom and I highly recommend buying any DVD from ""Deep Discount""",1424563200,,311,4.961538461538462

original episodes were about 15 minutes. there are bonus items of the little parts before and after many episodes.

 box description is incomplete ... not a subtraction of the quality of the dvd.",1380672000,,361,4.538461538461538

For those few of us in the US who already know about this adorable little Canadian cartoon, seeing this and the other five DVDs that were just released this week is great news! This marks the first time Ruby Gloom has ever been available in the US, and collectively, these six releases give us more than double the number of total episodes released on the two existing Canadian sets.

For those of you out there who haven't yet met Ruby Gloom, the product description describes her and her cartoon
pretty much perfectly: ""In a Victorian mansion on the outskirts of Gloomsville lives Ruby Gloom. Ruby's perfect day is a gloomy one, full of creativity and adventure with her offbeat circle of friends."" Ruby is the quintessential ""Perky Goth"" girl; that is, her skin is ghastly white and she wears a black dress with yellow-and-red striped stockings and all of her friends are cyclopses and skeletons and banshees and two-headed frankenstein rock stars, yet instead of being outright creepy, she's the self-proclaimed Happiest Girl In The World. Ruby is boundlessly lovable and wants to do nothing but share that happiness with everyone she meets.

The characters and setting and overall tone of the show are very reminiscent of Tim Burton's family films, Beetlejuice The Animated Series, and classic 60s Addams Family. The show remains at all times perfect for viewers of any age - there may be a few spooks here and there, but they're the fun sort of spooks, the ones that insist that monsters are not so much vicious as mischievous.

The only things preventing me from giving these releases five stars are the following: six DVD sets consisting of four episodes apiece at $9 a pop is a tad more than I'd prefer to spend (hardly more than you'd pay for any other standard retail DVD though), and oddly enough, the short bumper segments that bookended each episode when they aired on TV have been disconnected from their respective episodes and stuffed into a subcategory on each DVD called ""mini-episodes"", though they were included in their original spots on the Canadian releases. From what I can see, this is true on all of the American DVDs.

Episodes included on this particular DVD:

+ Grounded In Gloomsville
+ Ruby Cubed
+ Once In A Blue Moon
+ Time Flies

An imperfect release, but a long-awaited US release nonetheless, a healthy does of sales might convince Phase 4 Films to license and produce DVDs for the remainder of the episodes, so I do recommend that fans pick these up! It's great not having to scrounge around YouTube to find sloppy, low-res copies of episodes split into three chunks just to get your Ruby fix. :)",1379462400,,2717,4.792735042735043

5841332,5,B00DPH7UQW,"I had never even heard of Ruby Gloom before. I found it in a Walmart in the Halloween section. I thought my wife, who also likes Emily Strange, would like this; and since it was only 5 dollars I decided to chance it. My wife loved it, I loved it and so does our 6 year old son. Of course, I'm going to buy some more. If you like movies like Nightmare Before Christmas, Corpse Bride, Adventures of Billy and Mandy, Edgar and Ellen you will most likely like Ruby Gloom too.",1379030400,,471,4.130434782608695

5841334,5,B00DPH7UQW,"I never actually saw this series when it was shown in the UK, but I rarely watch TV these days. It was actually a chance viewing of an episode on YouTube that got me interested in this series, and I haven't regretted anything yet. Well, that's not totally true, but I'll explain.

Ruby Gloom started as a line of greetings goods or something like that which was eventually turned into this series of animations by Nelvana of Canada. Ruby is a kind hearted, somewhat sensible type living in an old mansion in a town called Gloomsville surrounded by various weird characters for whom she often acts as their sanity anchor. Examples include Iris, the thrill seeking cyclops girl for whom enough is never enough; Misery, a girl that you might think is the most unlucky, morose, accident prone person in the world until you discover a dry wit and a warm heart; Skull Boy, a skeleton that is always in search of his true identity and Scaredy Bat, a bat that lives up to his name in every way.

This DVD features four stories from the start of the series - one where Misery, Iris, Skull Boy and Frank & Len (a two headed boy band!) think that Ruby is moving out, another where Iris takes up bouncing after finding some springs and ends up visiting the other side of the world and so on. These are all great stories, so it is a great pity that only eight episodes, four on this DVD and four on the ""Misery Loves Company"" DVD, are the only episodes out of the forty that were made that you can currently buy outside Canada.",1370736000,2,1514,4.4035714285714285

It's great for younger kids, with gentle life lessons. But it's amusing enough for grown-up cartoon fans looking for a break from daily drama.",1458604800,,313,4.709090909090909
