8296013,1,B001E1BO4U,"First things first, NEVER buy any exercise DVD without having taken an in-person class first. That goes for yoga, aerobics, dance, whatever. You need a real instructor to show you proper technique. Second, there is almost NO actual dancing in this video and very little movement at all. It's almost all talking and the ""workout"" is not a workout at all unless you're like 90 years old. For each movement they break down, they give you a screen of notes before, a minute or so of actual instruction, then a minute of notes again after. They do this 10 times before getting to the actual ""workout"" which is basically the warmup and same 10 moves without the notes. This DVD wastes so much time.

The performances, while interesting to watch, are completely irrelevant to learning how to dance or working out. I don't honestly get the point of this DVD. It doesn't center around any one concept. Is it about history? Is it about technique? Is it about exercise? Is it about showcases? It takes so much time on each category, but still manages to not tell you enough about any one category for there to be a focus. Each part you watch leaves you wondering either, ""Is there more?"" or, ""Why did they spend five time on THIS one little thing?"" This DVD is something better gotten at the library where you can be disappointed and confused for be free.",1369872000,,1344,4.576763485477178
8296014,5,B001E1BO4U,THE DVD IS GREAT. IT IS EASY TO LEARN FROM AND FUN TO DO. THE DVD IS SET UP NICELY.,1293062400,,83,3.2
8296015,3,B001E1BO4U,i don't like to workout so this is a good distraction while doing the right thing. the movements are made simple enough for me to imitate the moves and feel the burn,1280707200,,165,4.1875
8296016,2,B001E1BO4U,"I enjoyed the history section, but as an instructional belly dance program, this DVD is lacking. The instructor describes the movements and shows you, but there's no repetitions or practice. If you're looking for information, this isn't a bad DVD, but if you're looking to really learn belly dance, there are tons of better quality DVD's out there.",1265500800,4,348,5.017241379310345
8296017,2,B001E1BO4U,"History segment is decent.  Instructions are too brief.  If you're a beginner, not enough time is spent on each movement.  If you're more advanced, you already know this stuff.  Claims to show how to create a ""Showcase Performance.""  Instead, it just shows random clips of two different ""dances.""  No hints, suggestions, or even voice cues are given for creating a dance.  Also, the random clips (""dances"") include moves that are not included at all in the instruction segment.  If one is very new to bellydance, she will have no idea what is being included in the ""dances.""  Spend your money on something else.",1252281600,3,611,4.854368932038835
8296018,4,B001E1BO4U,"This DVD gives a good break down of basic moves, then at the end performances how they are incorporated.",1230595200,,104,4.526315789473684
