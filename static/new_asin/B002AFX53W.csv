3884127,5,B002AFX53W,"Finally!  It is about time someone released Takashi Nomura's brilliant noir film, A COLT IS MY PASSPORT.  This film, alone, would be reason enough to buy this box set; but, the added attraction of four more clasic Nikkatsu Action flicks (including the superb CRUEL GUN STORY) makes this a gotta-get for fans of hard-boiled Japanese action cinema.
Hats off to Criterion/Eclipse for stepping up and unleashing more great Nikkatsu films!

Those shot with/in dark shadows, with strange or unusual camera angels with conflicted protagonists.

8359473,3,B002AFX53W,"ORE WA MATTERU ZE (I AM WAITING/I'LL BE WAITING).  EXCITING AND POWERFUL GANGSTER FILM!
Director: Koreyoshi Kurahara
DVD
1957
Rating = ***
Film = a solid three (3) stars; restoration = five (5) stars; subtitles = 4.5 stars.  Koreyoshi Kurahara's directorial debut, and it's a stunner!  A raw, in-your-face gangster movie, but with an unusual psychological twist.  Its effect on the viewer is immediate (starting with the initial, haunting scene) and continuous (right up to the final, ambiguous fadeout).  Once Director Kurahara has drawn the viewer into his film, resistance is futile!  The tale is a fists-on violent (there are lots of boxing fights) and mildly romantic (the protagonists may become lovers later on) one of a fascinating chance encounter.  Each character has suffered a devastating set back (she as an operatic singer, he as a light-weight boxer) just as their respective carriers were taking off.  Acting by the two leads is extremely engaging.  Actress Mie Kitahara's performance really shines when she is given significant/meaningful dialog to deliver besides just exhibiting facial expressions and body language.  Actors playing supporting roles as yakuza types deliver uneven performances and often look/act ridiculous (intended commentary by the Director?).  The climatic fight scene suffers from overdone symbolism (a ton of paper currency somehow ends up covering the prone hoodlum-boss loser) and phony, non-synchronized sound effects (punches always sound the same and are often heard before being seen!).  Garden-variety crooning during the opening and closing credits seems incongruous and out of place in a yakuza-themed movie.  Otherwise, the music is spot-on jazzy.  Cinematography (narrow screen, black and white) and lighting are outstanding and major contributors to the film's successful edgy impact.  Restoration is excellent and subtitles are very well done.  Highly recommended.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.

KORUTO WA ORE NO PASUPOOTO (A COLT IS MY PASSPORT).
CRIMINALIZED NONSENSE.
Director: Takashi Nomura
DVD
1967
Rating = ***
Film = barely three (3) stars; restoration = five (5) stars.  Director Takashi Nomura's photoplay places style way above substance.  How the film looks seems paramount.  All else is secondary, starting with the movie's title which is catchy but illusionary.  The script is all over the place, but is basically trying to illustrate the lack of honor among gangsters as well as the stupidity within ranks of organized crime that reaches right to top management.  (If you are a leader of a large, prosperous gang, would you risk your life by going into the field instead of just sending your foot-shoulder killers?)  The Director seems obsessed with attributes (mostly invented by early American movie makers) of the mythical American ""Wild West,"" and is striving hard to cast Japan of the middle 1960's as some sort of ""Wild East.""  (Silly and nonsensical as it may seem.)  Acting is no great shakes with the lead male actor (Jo Shishido) looking like he has a very bad case of the mumps (or a kilogram of cotton stuffed into his cheeks).  This facial distortion does not add to his hit-man ""ganger persona,"" but, instead, seriously distracts from his performance (apparently he underwent plastic to achieve this look!)  The score apes music from contemporary Italian/Spanish westerns; it is out of place, usually irritating, and distracts from scenes when on the sound track.  Sound effects are impoverished, seem to be an after thought, and often unintentionally humorous especially when male actors are always made to sound like they are wearing high heals, even when climbing gangways!  Cinematography (wide screen, black and white), lighting, and editing are okay.  Subtitles are about right for line readings, but often fail to translate signage even when the camera lingers on it.  Yet another film that gives yakusa (gokudou) a bad name.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.

SONO GOSOUSHA WO NERAE: 'JUUSANGOU TAIHISEN' YORI (TAKE AIM AT THE POLICE VAN / AIM AT THE POLICE VAN / AIM AT THE POLICE VAN: ""NUMBER 13 TURNOUT/BREAKDOWN  LANE"" ).  Lost In Execution!
Rating = ***
Director:  Seijun Suzuki
DVD
1960
Film = barely three (3) stars; cinematography = five (5) stars; restoration = five (5) stars.  Director Seijun Suzuki is unable to overcome a nonsensical scrip or direct/edit scenes to maximize action and suspense.  The basic ingredients are there for a potentially top-notch, exciting photoplay, but the Director's plodding approach pretty much neutralizes the dynamics.  This movie ""cries out"" for re-editing especially of the climatic scenes which are highly original, but squandered by poor direction/editing.  Suzuki also seems to be fixated on showing high-speed vehicles on deserted country roads and sliding around city corners.  There is a boatload of these ""padding"" scenes which add little (if anything) to the story (and often don't make much sense either).  The script is just plain lame.  For example, it fails to explain the film's title:  just why is a police bus shot up (at the start of the film) or, for that matter, why do any of the subsequent murders take place?  Trying to turn a dodgy, minor talent agency into a bigger prostitution ring is not much of a plot device.  Leading actress Mari Shiraki is allowed to overact in the closing scenes which humorously diminishes rather than enhances the impact of her performance.  The jazzy film score is fine, but sound dubbing leaves much to be desired.  All vehicles sound the same especially the squealing of tires whenever a car goes around a corner (chronically underinflated tires?); all gun shots from a variety of weapons sound the same; and sporadic background noise (perhaps from an air conditioner?) in some interior shots only serves to highlight (instead of hiding) the mechanics of how scenes are spliced together (sound comes and goes for even single-sentence line readings!)
Cinematography  (wide screen, black and white) is excellent with deep focus lighting and some of the best shots from inside moving vehicles on film to that date (practically no phony rear-screen projection is employed--what the viewer sees is really happening!)  Using filters to render day for night, however, is a bit of a distraction, since it is obviously phony (other night scenes appear to have been filmed in the dark and look great).  Recommended for film-school students studying how not to make a movie. WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.

KENJUU ZANKOKU MONOGATARI (CRUEL GUN STORY).  A Bit Too Many Bangs for the Buck.
Rating = ***
Director:  Takumi Furukawa
DVD
1964
Film = three (3) stars; subtitles = three (3) stars; restoration = five (5) stars.  Director Takumi Furukawa seems bent on breaking the Guinness Word Record for gun shots fired in a single movie!  Just about every scene ends in gun fire (and many also start off with it).  Intra- and inter-gang warfare provides the back drop.  It looks like every available character actor was rounded up to maximize the body count.  Paybacks piled atop paybacks leaves no survivors (which provides quite a nice savings to taxpayers footing the bill for incarcerations!).  Acting is okay (lead actor is chubby-cheeked Jou Shishido [who under went plastic surgery to inflate his mouth to look tougher, but, at least to me, just makes him appear as an undisciplined trumpet player!]).  Cinematography (wide screen, black and white), scene lighting, editing, body makeup, sound dubbing, and score are all very good.  Subtitles are pretty much mandatory due to the heavy use of Kansai Ben line readings and contemporary slang.  Unfortunately, translations leave much to be desired.  They need a good grammatical scrub (perhaps the translator was not proficient in Western dialects?) to reduce their length so as to increase their time on the screen.  Good shoot-em-up ganger film.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.

SABITA NAIFU (RUSTY KNIFE / RUSTED KNIFE).  A 3-D Movie:  Dull; Dumb; And Disappointing.
Rating = **
Director:  Toshio Masuda
DVD
1958
Film = two (2) stars; cinematography = barely three (3) stars;  subtitles = 3.5 stars; restoration = 4.5 stars.  Director Toshio Masuda proves that even a yakuza-themed movie can be a big bore.  The script contains no surprises (what's coming is telegraphed well in advance) and male actors consistently come across as let's-pretend-to-be-gangers (they need ""yakuza boot camp"" training!).  Scenes apparently meant to be exciting are not at all because of poor execution and editing.  The Director also allows his cast to double down on hammy histrionics (perhaps to compensate for a weak script and listless direction?).  Lead male actor needs dental work (which sometimes distracts from his tough/soft-guy performance as viewer can't help but fixate on this deficiency in close-ups).  Leading actress (Mie Kitahara) delivers a knock-out performance (as usual).  Score is minimalistic and pedestrian except for the full-orchestra sections which are exceptional, but far too few.  Cinematography (wide screen, black and white) and scene lighting are, well, simply terrible.  Excessive filtering/fogging of dark scenes sometimes makes it close to impossible to see what's happening.  Outdoor daylight scenes are often bleached-out (by being under exposed) and, hence, hard to look at.  Rear-screen projection is consistently crude and patently phony.  Subtitles are often too long and flash on screen too briefly to be fully read (unless you are a skilled speed reader!).  Translations stray a bit too far from line deliveries.  Most signs are translated.  Best to avoid this turkey.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1426291200,2,9621,5.276497695852535
8359474,4,B002AFX53W,"This set includes five popular crime films produced in the 1950s and 1960s by Japan's Nikkatsu studio. These are gripping, superior ""tough"" underworld films, which are particularly interesting for their blending of film genre influences, among them Japanese chanbara samurai film, French gangster movies, spaghetti westerns, and American film noir. I think these films would appeal to viewers who like the related genres mentioned. They all include much violence which, while not clinically graphic in the manner of some more recent films, is so effectively done that it's perhaps more shocking.

A Colt Is My Passport is the best of the set. Like some of the Clint Eastwood films, the movie gets you cheering for a cold-blooded killer because he's not quite as bad as the people trying to murder him. The killer in this case is Jo Shishido, a fine actor whose understated style effectively conveys the iciness of a professional assassin; as the gangster genre requires, unlike his enemies, he has his own strange sense of honor.

Recommended for people interested in Japanese film, Japanese popular culture, or the gangster/film noir",1358467200,,1134,5.191256830601093
8359475,3,B002AFX53W,"This boxset is no way the best Nikkatsu had to offer if you read Mark Schilling's book, ""No Borders, No Limits: Nikkatsu Action Cinema"" you'll see the best Nikkatsu crime films ""Roughneck"" ""Gangster VIP"" or ""Velvet Hustler"" have been left out of this Criterion boxset. Out of the five films offered here (I am Waiting, Rusty Knife, Cruel Gun Story, Take Aim at a Police Van and A Colt is My Passport"" only one is a gem while the rest are just average. The best is A Colt is My Passport it follows Nikkatsu super star J Shishido a cool hitman who after assassinating a target is pursed by some killers out for revenge as he is forced to hide out with his partner. The film boasts cool direction and shows influences of Jean Pierre Melville and a climax that is thrilling and memorable. The same cannot be said for the others which border on average: Rusty Knife a dull and rather uninteresting film, I am Waiting a good yet unimpressive noir, Cruel Gun Story, an oft tale tale of the heist gone wrong and the triple-crosses that follow and Suzuki's Take Aim at Police Van which has a great opening yet convoluted story. None of the films reach the level of the gripping A Colt is my Passport and left me deeply disappointed but this boxset is worth the price for that film alone yet made me feel that Criterion had missed an opportunity to make a brilliant boxset. Here's hoping Criterion will release another boxset with classics mentioned in Mark's book like ""Roughneck"" ""Retaliation"" ""Gangster VIP"" and ""Velvet Hustler"" which would make top notch boxset.",1345939200,5,1556,4.620938628158845
8359476,3,B002AFX53W,"(3 1/2 stars) Criterion puts out another above average eclipse set for those looking to dig a little deeper into their vaults. Series 17 is five films put out by the Japanese Nikkatsu studio at various times between 1957 and 1967.

These can probably best be classified as slightly poppish crime-noir, nothing as over the top as Suzuki's ""Branded to Kill"", but nothing as realistic as say ""Pale Flower""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pale-Flower-The-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B004NWPY4I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pale Flower (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray</a>]. Some are better than others, and of course over a 10 year span you'll see some changes in tone and style. Considering the age of the films you will see minor transfer/quality issues here and there, but overall still very, very good. The movies vary somewhat as to theme, but most focus on some aspect of ""redemption"", ""trying to go straight"", or ""rescuing your lover/friend/oneself"" from corruptive influences.  It is hard as an outsider to know if this was directly reflective in any way as part of the healing process of losing World War II, or just a reason why some of the typical aspects of these types of films struck a nerve and became so popular in Japan at the time.

The best of the bunch is ""A Colt Is My Passport"" (1967), directed by Takashi Nomura and starring Joe Shishido. You could give this 5 stars, but it does contain a very annoying spaghetti western soundtrack that does not fit well with the movie and is played so frequently that it proves to be distracting. Shishido plays a hitman that falls into the inevitable web of betrayals and doublecrosses, but it contains several nice touches and an ending that for '67 was fairly innovative.  It's a little dated now, when for example the tough guys marvel over the ability of a shotgun to take out more than one person at a time. Aside from the aforementioned music its very solid overall however, and must be a fan favorite as I couldn't help but to notice it is on the cover of the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Borders-No-Limits-Nikkatsu-Action-Cinema-Cinema-Classics/dp/1903254434/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Borders, No Limits: Nikkatsu Action Cinema (Cinema Classics)</a>.

Shishidoites can also see him star in 1964's ""Cruel Gun Story"", and then also put in a solid 10 minutes or so before losing a fight with a speeding train in 1958's ""Rusty Knife"" (which in my opinion was a little too campy).  You ultimately don't see enough of him in Knife to be able to say this is a 3-disc Shishido set, but it looked to me that his performance there is from before he got the famous ""cheek implants"" that made him the Marlon Brando of the Japanese gangster world, which makes it a nice treat. He still looks roughly the same, and I wonder if eventually he would have had the exact same career if he had forgone the plastic surgery.

None of the films feature Shishido working with the director he is probably the most strongly associated with, Seijun Suzuki, but Suzuki does have a film represented here, 1960's ""Take Aim at the Police Van"". At this stage of the game he is nowhere near to approaching his manic zenith that starts to peak in ""Tokyo Drifter"", or even ""Branded to Kill"". But there are enough trademark touches that I would think that rabid Suzuki fans would still enjoy watching it.

The last film is 1957's ""I Am Waiting"", starring the prolific japanese power couple of Yujiro Ishihara and Mie Kitahara (also in Rusty Knife). Whereas that film had too many young actors in it trying to do their best rebel without a cause imitation, they do a much better job here (although I would still not call it true noir, more young pop). Japan had many disaffected youth after the war who were really struggling to find an identity, and from a marketing standpoint they represented too strong of a force to ignore. They were also being drawn heavily to US and French film imports, and it may have also been culturally important for Japan to show it could match from a pop-culture standpoint what the west had to offer.

In several cases the music drives most of these down by a 1/2 star or so, and otherwise I would probably give it a 4 star rating overall. I still prefer Criterion's ""Pale Flower"" to any of these films, so if you have to choose what to buy with limited cash on hand I would start there. For Shishido fans though it's an easy call to pick this up.",1335225600,6,4512,4.9498018494055485
8359477,5,B002AFX53W,"Included in this boxed set are 5 fantastic Japanese films noir produced by the Nikkatsu studio in the 1950s and 1960s.  This was the height of the Japanese film noir era, and few studios produced as many wonderful films of this style during that era.  The price is reasonable for 5 expertly translated and subtitled quality films.  The Eclipse collections have impressed me for the quality of sound, picture, and subtitles for what are considered less 'popular' collections.  Along with the Eclipse collections for Ozu and Kurosawa, this is one of my favorites.

'I Am Waiting' is the earliest film and features a disgraced former boxer as the hero.  He was involved with the mob and organized crime years ago, but left that life behind.  He is suddenly swept back into that world when he intervenes and rescues a woman in distress from her gangster boss.  The film centers around the interaction of both main characters with the specters of their past and their hopes for the future.

'Rusty Knife' is a wonderful and dark film revolving around an ex-con's attempt to live a straight life and forget his dark and awful past.  Despite his efforts to distance himself from the world of organized crime, he is swept back into this world due to his desire to protect a younger former organized crime colleague.

'Take Aim at the Police Van' is a story of a hit on an ex-con.  The disgraced guard takes it upon himself to track down the killers and clear his name.

'Cruel Gun Story' features an ex-con trying to live the straight and narrow, but gets back into crime despite his wishes to stay clear.  His former colleagues arrange a heist of an armored car.  During the heist and afterwards, things go horribly wrong and a trail of violence and dead bodies follows.

'A Colt is my Passport' is probably my favorite of the bunch.  This is the story of a mob hitman, Kamimura, hired to assassinate a rival mob boss.  After the hit, his boss sells him out to the rival boss' son.  The tables turn as Kamimura attempts to flee/fight off the hit against himself.

All in all five great mob/hitman/crime noir films for any fan of the genre!",1316908800,4,2132,4.634666666666667
8359478,5,B002AFX53W,"All credit to the other reviewers who have done their homework and appreciate the stylistic elements of these films.  I'll just say I picked up one these at the local library and found myself scouring the shelves for a similar Criterion pattern on the spine to score the rest.

What I enjoyed were characters who could convincingly slouch like a Japanese version of Zoot-suited Bogart, plots with match-ups and double-crossing like the ""Good, the Bad and the Ugly"".  These movies provide an immersion in a time and world (Japan post-war low-lifes and gangsters) as lost to us all as a  Jurassic forest, or the royal court of the Sun King.  Gives me faith that in the worlds of film, literature and music there is more to explore.",1314576000,10,729,4.708661417322834
8359479,5,B002AFX53W,"Having seen most of the films in the traveling Nikkatsu noir retrospective last year when it hit New York and Boston, I was initially disappointed with the choice of titles in this collection, because the only film from that retrospective included in this box set was A Colt Is My Passport.  But in hindsight, I'm glad Eclipse didn't merely duplicate the films from that retrospective, as obviously there is a lot more Nikkatsu noir out there than most of us had any clue about.  Whoever chose the films for this collection knows their Japanese noir and picked a bunch of obscure and pioneering titles that all happen to be excellent.  All 5 of the films in this collection are true films noir (not ""sort of noir"" borderline cases like many DVDs marketed as ""noir"" can be), kinetically and inventively filmed in black and white, featuring excellent jazz scores (and in one case a spaghetti Western-like score), beautifully presented with barely a hint of print damage, and in their original theatrical aspect ratios.  As with the ""no frills"" approach taken in the Eclipse collections to keep the prices reasonable, there are no special features like interviews, documentaries, trailers, etc.  However, the printed liner notes provided for each film give you all the critical/historical background you need on each film.  I very much hope Eclipse decides to do not just a follow-up but multiple volumes of this collection -- and soon!  No doubt there are plenty of noirs out there from the incredibly prolific Nikkatsu studios.  Japanese noir didn't really take off until the late 1950s (barring the two influential Kurosawa films: Stray Dog and Drunken Angel in the late 40s), so many of the Nikkatsu noirs I saw in that travelling retrospective were inevitably in color.  So it would be great to see some of these color noirs included in the next collection, particularly Toshio Masuda's other films (the one in this collection, A Colt Is My Passport, is black and white, but Red Handkercheif, Velvet Hustler, Gangster V.I.P., Bloodstained Challenge, and probably others are in color).  In fact, how about an Eclipse set with just the Masuda noirs, along with further sets with films from various directors?  In any event, this first collection is an essential purchse for fans of film noir, Japanese cinema, or just plain highly entertaining B-movies.",1262649600,36,2353,5.007692307692308

Not everything in the genre is easily obtainable from this side of the globe, especially for the relatively older works not directed by Kurosawa and the other well-known masters. This fine collection of films from one of Japan's oldest film studios is certainly a welcome contribution. The five pieces are very diverse, worth watching at least once and delivered in excellent quality and obtainable for an affordable price.",1255132800,18,600,5.13265306122449

From the mid-1950's to the early 1970's, Nikkatsu specialized in brutal crime movies to attract the youth audiences that were becoming accustomed to American big-screen imports.  In ""I Am Waiting"" (1957), a restaurant manager and former boxer saves a beautiful, suicidal club hostess trying to escape the bonds of her gangster employer.  ""Rusty Knife"" (1958) has former hoodlums trying to leave behind a life of crime only to have their lawless past resurface when the authorities seek them out as witnesses to murder. ""Take Aim at the Police Van"" (1960) is an action whodunit.  A police truck is attacked and a gangster inside is murdered.  The penitentiary warden, accused of negligence, is suspended, but takes it upon himself to track down the killers to regain his honor and reputation.  The other films are ""Cruel Gun Story"" (1964), about a mob heist, and ""A Colt Is My Passport,"" about a hit man caught between rival gangs.  As in keeping with the high standard of The Criterion Collection, print quality is exceptional considering the age of the films.",1251244800,7,1198,5.015151515151516
