8747310,4,B01AGTP5GS,"A young, 35 year old couple decides to frolic in their local cemetery one evening. This turns out to be a bad idea, since it just so happens that a vampire named Caleb Croft (Michael Pataki- ZOLTAN, HOUND OF DRACULA) has chosen the very same night to emerge from his nearby tomb! While the ""youths"" are busy fooling around in their car, Croft moves in! After killing lover boy, he puts the real moves on the girl! In an open grave! The cops are stumped, except for Lt. Panzer (Eric Mason), who believes the woman, named Leslie, was raped by Croft, who died years earlier! Leslie is found to be pregnant w/ Croft's child, and chooses to keep it, though it shows no signs of life! After some scenes of mum and baby Croft, we're shown junior as an adult. His name is James Eastman (William Smith- INVASION OF THE BEE GIRLS, MANIAC COP), and he's been hunting his odious father for most of his life. He's finally located him. Croft is a professor, at a college where most of the students are middle-aged. Man, they sure can dance though! Eastman refuses to boogie, as it's not in the Nosferatu handbook! However, he does get a lot of immediate, female attention! One thing about these vampires, both father and son, is that they attract women like socks attract dust-bunnies! GRAVE OF THE VAMPIRE (1972) wasn't as well-known as other, early 70's vampire films, like COUNT YORGA or THE NIGHT STALKER. Actually, GRAVE is much darker than those films. The idea of a mother raising an undead offspring must have been pretty shocking back in '72! The ""nursing"" scene is both grim and audacious for its day! Aside from the occasional murder, the action dies down quite a bit after that, up until the seance slaughter / battle of the bloodsuckers finale! Alas, Eastman's last words in this movie are nearly unintelligible, due to too many fangs in his mouth! As close as can be understood, they were: ""BBBBLLRRRBBBLLLUUMMMBBBRRAAABLPPPH!""...",1520812800,,1930,4.71301775147929
8747311,3,B01AGTP5GS,"It gets a star for William Smith.  You should read this guys bio - the number of films and TV shows he made is astounding.  He's the guy who fought it out with Clint in Any Which Way You Can and was the Russian in Red Dawn.  Come to think of it, I believe he taught Russian at UCLA.",1506729600,,282,3.7457627118644066
8747312,1,B01AGTP5GS,"The story is very good about a half blood vampire out to kill his father a vampire who rapes a human.the good vampire,William Smith is kept alive when his mother finds out he can only survive on blood which she gives from her own body. I disagree with those calling this movie atrocious but then again i am a horror fan. Why the one star,if you buy the copy with a girl walking the hallway the copy is atrocious and amaturerly copied. It was copied from a movie screen and you can see the room it was copied in on the sides of the movie screen. The bigger the tv screen the worse it looks",1500768000,,588,4.121739130434783

8747314,4,B01AGTP5GS,"If Joseph Campbell was right and the plot of the Odyssey is ""Go find your father"" and it is REALLY about Telemachus trying to find his father Odysseus (aka Ulysses) post Trojan War than this is John Hayes' THE ODYSSEY. In this film James Eastman portrayed by drop dead gorgeous William Smith must find HIS father Caleb Croft (played by Michael Pataki) who happens to be a vampire. William is a half-vampire and this film (based on the novel by David Chase) is the inspiration behind the BLADE comics and movies. Blade first appeared in the comic Tomb of Dracula Vol. 1 #10 a year after this film was released which was 1972. Tomb of Dracula introduced Blade in '73.",1473120000,,665,4.55
8747315,1,B01AGTP5GS,"This review is for the Amazon Instant Video of the horror classic Grave Of The Vampire, which is a great classic vampire film from the 70's. The instant video of the film appears to have been transferred from an ancient VHS tape. The transfer is cropped pan & scan & the color definition is faded & washed out. Granted the cost was fairly cheap to buy, but disappointing. Amazon needs to allow a ""preview"" of the actual titles before purchasing. Vudu has this option & is very helpful for seeing the quality of a title before purchasing. Not just a trailer for the film. The film is a great classic. The film transfer is very substandard.",1465516800,,638,4.508620689655173
