7894065,4,630577272X,"VCI's two-tape VHS set of THE PHANTOM (1943) is full screen dubbed and recorded at SP speed. Although it doesn't have a HiFi audio track, the sound is very clear. Condition of source material is quite good-- with some spotting near reel ends, but there's no edit breaks, and all chapters are complete.

Tom Tyler, a bit past his cowboy star prime, plays the often out-of-breath Phantom. He wears a mask, skin tight crown-to-to-toe leotards, and a wide belt with a silver 'P' buckle that holds up his dark-striped panties.

Weightlifting champ Tyler, who was born Vincent Markowski in 1903, had minor roles in John Ford's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/STAGECOACH/dp/6304696582/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">STAGECOACH</a>&nbsp;(1939),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WHAT-PRICE-GLORY/dp/B0001NBMIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WHAT PRICE GLORY?</a>&nbsp;(1952),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SHE-WORE-A-YELLOW-RIBBON/dp/B000O599NK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON</a>&nbsp;(1949),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THEY-WERE-EXPENDABLE/dp/B000O599VC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THEY WERE EXPENDABLE</a>&nbsp;(1945) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/RED-RIVER/dp/6304696612/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">RED RIVER</a>&nbsp;(1949).

Various subsequent health issues slowed Tyler down and he died at age 50 of a coronary.

THE PHANTOM is an above-average superhero movie serial, created by COLUMBIA for little money on backlot jungle sets, depicting an illogical land decorated by artificial shrubbery where African lions and Indian tigers rub shoulders. The natives, all played by whites, either speak clichd broken English, or a laughable gibberish consisting of such hyphenated jargon as moola-moola, ugga-mugga, boola-wonga, bunga-bunga and the always popular umma-gonga-tonga. You can't make this stuff up!

The Phantom is the mysterious white guy who holds sway over several native villages through the skillful use of magician hocus pocus and rousing oratory. When necessary, he appears and vanishes behind a wall of flames created by manservant Moko, a froggy little native boy in an asymmetrically-hemmed cougarskin skirt and Injun Joe wig.

Each of these 15 chapters includes at least one display of fisticuffs in which our hero battles a minimum of three bad guys. Late in the story we segue from the jungle to a Moorish castle set, where Mongol and Assyrian costumes, the latter accoutered with assagais and tin woodsman helmets, are taken out of mothballs. These duds adorn a small number of journeyman extras-- more guys for Phantom to feed knuckle sandwiches to.

Tartar, the leader of this motley bunch, lolls on a curvy couch. He wears a fur-trimmed hat with a Hersheys kiss on top and tokes on a hookah while resting against over-sized pillows. When Phantom is confronted by several of Tartar's men, he starts their donnybrook by slapping one of them with one of their boss's pillows. Now that had to really hurt!

For this final section's climax, a stuntman in a mange-riddled gorilla suit wrestles Phantom in a dirt-floored pit. Around the monster's neck is a chain from which dangles the missing ivory key to a seven piece puzzle map that will reveal the location of a fabled treasure city. All ""The Man Who Never Dies"" has to do is defeat his 500 lb. foe in hand-to-fur-clad hand combat, and the key will be his. Can he do it? Did we sit through 15 chapters only to see him fail? There's your answer.",1314748800,2,3993,6.452336448598131
7894066,5,630577272X,This a must for any fan of The Phantom. It remains true for the majority of it to the original comics and contains some excellent action scenes. I thought Tom Tyler did a great job in the role of The Phantom and even if you are not a fan of the hero this still should take pride of place in anybody's collection as it is a classic serial from beginning to end.,1009670400,10,360,4.013888888888889
7894067,5,630577272X,"I generally agree that Columbia did not turn out a lot of the best serials, but they did a good job, IMHO, on this one.  Well, maybe Tom Tyler couldn't act, but he was good enough.  There's much to recommend this.  The most interesting facet to me was that, unlike most serials, the main character is, in the minds of the bad guys, dead at the end of about nine of the fifteen chapters.  This, of course, reinforces the idea of ""The man who can not die"", or ""The Ghost Who Walks"".  The chapter endings in all serials show the hero in extreme peril, but not usually and continually as a result of a ""death trap"" plotted by the villains.  And so, by the last chapter, even the primary villain is wondering if the Phantom is immortal or not.
I also enjoyed the use of Ace, ""The Wonder Dog"", as the Phantom's dog, ""Devil"".  I am glad that they didn't try to have the main character's white horse featured in the comic strip as part of this serial.
The plot was better than average, a bit more complicated.  The chapter endings weren't spectacular, but the action was continuous.  So I recommend this, especially to those familiar with the comic strip.",993513600,11,1147,4.423809523809524
7894068,3,630577272X,I have been a Serial nut since I was 6 years old back in 1939. After looking for years for a Phantom print I finally found one with Amazon.  Sorry to say I was somewhat sorry with this Columbia Picures product.  In all fairness no one could make a Serial with the quality of Republic Pictures. They had the best directors and technicians in Hollywood. The Phantom I have is good with a very good story line. But the special effects are just not there.  And that's what makes a Serial. Tom Tyler is one poor actor but that's his charm.  When he made Captian Marvel I think in the entire 15 chapters he only spoke a total of 60 words.  William Whitney the director once said that those few words were too much for Tyler. But that's OK for Tom I still enjoy watching him.,987292800,4,768,4.232876712328767
7894069,5,630577272X,"Being a huge fan of Lee Falks' Phantom, I have tried to track down this seriel for quite awhile. I was able to obtain from a collecter who had this seriel before it was made available again to the public. Let me just say that Tom Tyler does a great job of playing the Phantom! Obviously this seriel does not have the production value of the Adventures of Captain Marvel, but it does have an excelent storyline that could fit into any Indiana Jones movie. This seriel does a much better job of establishing the mystique of the Phantom with the natives of Bengali and the mystery of the Phantom, the Ghost Who Walks.
This has alot of action with the Phantom and Devil and the Phantom battles a gigantic gorilla. This ends up being a guy in an ape suit but it is a pretty cool looking menacing suit and not just a cheesy gorilla outfit. It is overall fun and a blast to watch if you are a Phantom fan. Anyone who enjoys old movie seriels knows the formulas used so don't expect groundbreaking cliffhangers. This may not be the best seriel ever made but it is a very well done seriel and one I recommend if you like action/adventure heroes.",978825600,53,1136,4.338028169014085
7894070,2,630577272X,"Tom Tyler, who stars in the best serial ever made, The Adventures of
Captain Marvel, dons the purple spandex in this early version of Lee
Falk's ""Ghost Who Walks"".  The Phantom is one of the most
intriguing comic characters ever, a legendary jungle hero who the
natives believe to be immortal because he continues to exist for
centuries.  Actually, the Phantom is really human; being replaced by
descendents of the original Phantom who donned the suit to avenge his
parents' death at the hand of pirates.  Tyler looks great in the
outfit, and the jungles scenes look pretty good, but this
unfortunately is a typical Columbia serial; weak story and not one of
my favorites.  The only thing intriguing about this one is that it
remained unreleased for years, and only available to private
collectors who sold it at a premium to rabid fans of the Phantom.
However, if you are a Phantom fan, then for $ bucks, you gotta have
it just to see the dude in the suit.",956275200,24,957,4.6117647058823525
