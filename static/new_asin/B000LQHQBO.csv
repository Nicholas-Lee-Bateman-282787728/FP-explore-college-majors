8163652,5,B000LQHQBO,Very good rendering of the life of Santa Teresa. Concha Velazco had an outstanding performance. The DVD packaging (in polypropylene box) is much better tan the Bluray packaging (card box). But Bluray quality is far superior.,1440460800,2,224,5.25
8163653,5,B000LQHQBO,"Great movie, great performing, great way to study and learn about the life of St. Teresa.",1187740800,,89,4.625
8163654,5,B000LQHQBO,"I also had no problem playing this in my US DVD player. This movie is great, especially how it was filmed in Spain - very authentic! Highly recommended!",1180051200,,152,4.464285714285714
8163655,5,B000LQHQBO,"As a previous comment stated, I also was not able to play the PAL format on my TV, but it will play on my HP DVD-rom. Try Ebay for a copy. I purchased mine from Spain, and it is well worth it.  Excellent production, inspired acting, and an edifying but down-to-earth treatment of the life of Teresa of Avila.",1179273600,2,308,4.220338983050848
8163656,5,B000LQHQBO,"I had seen this movie years ago and it is just fantastic for a mature viewer. (Not offensive to Catholic truths, a ""living biography"" of St. Teresa of Avila. I say ""mature viewer"" because it portrays the sinners as definite, explicit sinners). The acting is just top-rate! Being a mini-series, the film highlights St. Teresa's life, so it may be helpful to be familiar with her story in order to follow the episodes as they skip a little time and place from one to the next.

I was delighted to find ""Teresa de Jesus"" available to purchase on DVD and risked doing so despite the conflicting reports of playable or not playable on US players.  However, for myself, NONE of our players (four of them, mostly Sony), could play this PAL-format DVD.

However, it IS playable on my Apple computer, thankfully.

Perhaps this will help you decide whether to buy this PAL version of this masterpiece of cinema.",1176940800,6,901,4.6835443037974684
8163657,5,B000LQHQBO,"I also had no problem playing the DVDs even though I have a cheap-o DVD player that I just bought.

The story is terrific and I think all the acting is also very fine.  It is a little disturbing when it shows some of the excesses of society during the time Saint Teresa lived.  But it shows how she used her strong personality, personal warmth and her great intelligence to overcome any obstacle in living out her calling.  I loved this mini-series.",1170633600,4,449,4.439024390243903
8163658,5,B000LQHQBO,"No problems at all with the merchandise.  At first, my only concern was the NON-USA FORMAT, PAL.  But forunately, I had no problem with that neither.  The transaction was succesfull and painless.  I definetely recommend this seller.

Thank you very much.",1169683200,6,254,5.097560975609756
