8026368,5,6303450342,"Excuse the metaphor, but this is the ultimate Construction Equipment Hard-Core movie. There is no plot, the music is dreadful, but if what you want to see is digging and dumping, rolling and plowing, digging and dumping... this movie is for you.
On a more serious note, many construction videos are paced as fast as a Music Video (especially the CAT 1&2 vids which we returned). Editors cuts to the next scene before ALL the dirt drops out of the bucket or truck...  Our 2 year old finds that very frustrating.
This video's slower pace lets you see all the action from beginning to end. Older kids might find it too slow, but hard-core toddlers love it.",974160000,,653,4.581196581196581
