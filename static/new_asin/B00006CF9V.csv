8471659,2,B00006CF9V,"Three words ... Save your money! Any similarity to MTV's Real World is purely coincidental! One the Bus is more like Blair Witch without the laughs. This effort at a documentary was apparently put together by it's original director when the now defunct production company went on the auction block. Dustin is the only character with any depth. He is a slightly over-weight, but cute and introspective character who elicits some sympathy for his longing to find a soul mate. Pretty boy Charles is all but invisible in the film. Jason Webb, a former Freshmen model is the other cutie. Unfortunately, he has very little of interest to say and don't expect to see him in the ""all together""- it never happens. In fact, if all you are looking for is some gratuitous sex, you will be equally disappointed. There are maybe a half dozen brief ""butt shots"" in the film and about 20 seconds of full frontal nudity, but don't expect anything exciting. The characters mention briefly that they have had sex, but don't expect to see any of it! While the premise of the film is interesting, it fails miserably to achieve it's goal. The conversation is shallow and none of the characters really develops fully. I am one who is able to recognize when a film has some redeeming qualities, but just doesn't appeal to ""me"". That's not the case with On the Bus. If you really must buy this film, click on Used and buy my copy!",1032307200,29,1405,4.601593625498008
