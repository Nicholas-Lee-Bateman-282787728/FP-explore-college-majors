This movie is not for everyone, especially if you're really into big budget Hollywood movies and stars. Kim Coates was amazing and believable as Serrano and I loved him in this role. This movie was very dark and sometimes disturbing, but the search for redemption is touching and very well played. If you like strange indie films that offer more real substance than expensive explosions and overpriced action, then this movie just may be for you.",1277424000,,539,4.806451612903226
