2604094,4,B000GB5M9M,"As one of the very best nice , good , encouraging , wholesome , patriotic , all American good guys . From the military , seaplane pilot in High Barbaree (1947) to Mickey Rooney's older and off at war brother in The Human Comedy (1943) to the resolute and heroic stranger of The Romance Of Rosy Ridge (1947) to this film (1949) , Johnson portrayed a uniter , never a divider . And brilliantly and effortlessly at that .
This is another fine and interesting example of a Van character doing what he did best . An upstanding and incorruptible detective hell bent on capturing a fellow officer's killer . The twist and discovery here will take you by surprise in all probability . If you've seen any or all of the pictures I've indicated , or not , check out the great Van Johnson and be in the know .",1407110400,,797,4.28476821192053
2604095,3,B000GB5M9M,"Van Johnson was famous in the early forties when all the big actors were drafted into the war. I guess he is collectible, if for no other reason. As he aged he went downhill from his frothy interviews. He did appear in many musicals, even with Judy Garland. They aren't bad movies either.",1405296000,,288,4.452830188679245
2604096,3,B000GB5M9M,"A police detective (Van Johnson) attempts to crack a case involving the killing of another cop suspected of being on the take from bookies. This necessitates romancing a showgirl (Gloria DeHaven) to get information which doesn't sit well with his wife (Arlene Dahl), who hates him being a cop anyway. This is a pretty lifeless crime drama that's not dark enough to be called noir and not enough suspense to be referred to as a thriller. Johnson is possibly the least likely actor one would think of for a tough talking cop and while he gives it the old college try, he's never quite convincing enough though it does provide DeHaven with one of the best roles MGM ever gave her. The uneventful plot doesn't sit well with the glossy MGM studio bound treatment, it might have been better if it had gone the faux semi-documentary shot on location route of something like Dassin's THE NAKED CITY. Directed by Roy Rowland with a brief forgettable score by Andre Previn. The supporting cast is first rate though: John McIntire, Tom Drake, Leon Ames, Norman Lloyd, Jerome Cowan, Anthony Caruso and Donald Woods.

The MOD DVDr from the Warner Archives is a very nice B&W transfer.",1371081600,14,1171,4.740196078431373

2604100,4,B000GB5M9M,Great in depth look at realistic Crime Scene work. No CBS CSI hear. Some graphic photos (ie: dead bodies). Wouldn't suggest viewing if not interested in the career field.,1273881600,2,170,4.896551724137931
2604101,5,B000GB5M9M,"Scene Of The Crime, Killwhitneydead's new DVD offering, is nothing what I expected. It use to be customary to have the DVD consist of only the show with a few extras strewn about. Not so with Killwhitneydead. On here, the documentary serves as the true highlight.

Killwhitneydead have intrigued me since the day I found out about them. The music is unrelenting and the excellent samples are something I've been unable to dismiss. But once I started looking into them, reading all this stuff about how they were banned from their hometown, why they couldn't play live, etc., that added another dimension to this insane band. Well, all those stories are cleared up as the lead member of KWD, M (or Matt), sheds some revealing light on the band as a whole. As disappointed as I figured I'd be this documentary is far too interesting to turn your back on. Live clips, how the band actually started, and everything up to the re-release of So Pretty So Plastic is included on this feature.

The bonus interviews with band members new and old are nice to watch, however not essential. The interview with the cover girl of So Pretty So Plastic, original and re-release, is funny but not at all what I expected. Give and take though. The live set shot in the bands' hometown is exactly as advertised, raw. Raw doesn't mean poor quality though. Seeing how insane the crowd gets and how much that influences the band's performance is pretty amazing. The music videos/stage antics are about normal, aside from the video (hilarious). Then of course you have the standard photo gallery.

To truly enjoy Scene Of The Crime I do believe you need to be a fairly significant KWD fan. So if you are a fan and are like I was, wondering if all the rumors are true about the band, then this is far and away worth the money. Other than that, well, just enjoy it.",1158624000,5,1840,4.586626139817629
2604102,3,B000GB5M9M,"Not the best of the genre, but interesting enough to keep your interest and the hero is not an anti-hero, but also not as smart as he thinks he is.
Similar in concept to Naked City, but not quite as gritty and realistic.",1443139200,,220,4.1395348837209305

2604104,5,B000GB5M9M,I love these old movies and especially van Johnson.  Unfortunately I will not be buying anymore WB or Amazon movies because of Amazon's stance on not selling the confederate flag.  I love Amazon and have recommended it to many people.  Plus I used to spend a bunch of money thru them and use their credit cards....no more.,1436140800,,322,4.614035087719298
2604105,4,B000GB5M9M,"Plot: Lt Conovan (VAN JOHNSON) tries to clear the name of a dead cop with $1,000 cash in his pocket labeled CROOKED.

Conovan uses ""snitches"" including the ever resourceful ""Sleeper"" go get the dirt on a new KILLER labeled THE TURK ....complete with  a 'GIMPY LEFT hand.' The TURK has a new scheme......he is robbing and killing BOOKIES. So both the MOB and the Cops want to find him.  The key to finding TURK is his love interest..... Chlorine Singer/Stripper Gloria DeHaven, who develops a ""soft spot"" for Conovan.  After another cop is killed Conovan turns up the pressure on DeHaven to find Turk.  Conovan's lovely wife...(ARLENE DAHL) l has little to do.  GREAT shoot out between the cops and Turk and a very heavily armored getaway car.

2604108,2,B000GB5M9M,"I did not finish watching the movie because it was not the movie I wanted to see. I got the title mixed up with another crime suspense. The movie I wanted to watch is titled, ""Story on Page One"", directed  by Clifford Odets, staring Rita Hayworth, Anthony Franciosa, Gig Young and Mildred Dunnock.

I have been longing to see ""Story"" since I first encountered it in 2000. I began watching the movie, but never completed the viewing because I had an appointment to run out to.  I have been trying to find ""Story"" ever since to finish watching, but could not find the title anywhere!

What added to my problem was that I didn't know the exact title; thinking it was called, ""Scene of the Crime"".  I think I have found the the former to view, and then post my review!",1427760000,,764,4.390070921985815
2604109,5,B000GB5M9M,"This film is vastly underrated. Is it ""noir""...?  That depends on whose definition you choose to use, today everything seems to be labeled noir , but strictly speaking I'd say it's not.  Doesn't make any difference though because it's a very good ""crime"" drama.  It has a realistically good plot that you can follow, nice black and white filming, and believeable acting from a great cast of actors.  I personally find this movie much more enjoyable to watch than many of the traditional ""sacred cows"" of the genre (e.g. The Naked City).  IMO Van Johnson was very believeable as a Detective and Arlene Dahl... WOW... is she cute!  Oh and don't forget Gloria DeHaven in her prime... Give it a look...I think you'll love it.",1419379200,5,721,4.728

8130192,3,B000GB5M9M,"Scene of the Crime is a 1949 black and white attempt by MGM to move into the territory owned by Warner Bros. Dore Schary (1905-80) had just moved from RKO and wanted to shake up the MGM image which was fading in the post war period. This was one of his films he personally got involved with, and he saw it as an opportunity to not merely change MGMs image but also to expand the careers of two MGM stars  Van Johnson and Gloria DeHaven.

Van Johnson (1916-2008) had been a song and dance man playing musical comedies with some success. He was never top tier (e.g., Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra), but Schary saw some dramatic potential (e.g., 30 Seconds Over Tokyo) and pushed him into this one and more (Battleground, Command Decision). Hes certainly adequate in this role as a cop investigating the murder of his ex-partner.

Gloria DeHaven (1925-2016) also had a rich career in the musical genre (Step Lively, Two Girls and a Sailor), and in this film she plays a stripper with ties to the underworld. Shes merely OK and her dramatic career didn't take off, though she enjoyed success in TV (Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman, Ryans Hope).

Beautiful Arlene Dahl (1925) plays Johnsons suffering wife. She and Johnson enjoyed some success the year earlier in The Bride Goes Wild.

The film has a staple of dependable character actors, including John McIntire (TVs Naked City and Wagon Train), Norman Lloyd (popular in Hitchcock films), Tom Drake (Judy Garlands boyfriend in Meet me in St. Louis), Leon Ames (Judy Garlands father in Meet me in St. Louis), and Anthony Caruso  (The Asphalt Jungle).

The film is often mistaken for film noir, which it isnt. Its also not that great. Considering the crime dramas from the 40s (High Sierra, This Gun for Hire, The Blue Dahlia, The Killers, The Naked City, Criss Cross, They Live By Night, White Heat) and this one doesnt hold up that well.

The big Oscar winners in 1949 were Hamlet (Picture, Actor, Art Direction, Costume Design) and Treasure of the Sierra Madre (Director, Screenplay, Supporting Actor). The top box office hits were Samson and Delilah, Battleground, Jolson Sings Again, The Sands of Iwo Jima, and I Was a Male Order Bride. Other notable films that year were All the Kings Men, Champion, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, Twelve OClock High and White Heat.",1472083200,,2316,4.743781094527363
8130193,4,B000GB5M9M,"This is pretty good. Van Johnson is surprisingly effective as the hard boiled detective, I had only seen him in musicals before. This is a period piece but it's well done. My first car was a 1949 Ford. There are a lot of these in this movie.",1466985600,,241,4.148936170212766
