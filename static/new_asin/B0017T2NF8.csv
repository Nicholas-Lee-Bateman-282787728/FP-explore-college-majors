The Battle between the Rally EVO & the Tuner S2000 and the K20A Face off were my favorites.",1219104000,,121,3.88
8496092,4,B0017T2NF8,"The Touge Battle between the Mitsubishi WRC setup againts The Touge Champion S2000 was very interesting, but one thing that I noticed quite disappointed was that the Mitsubishi WRC using the gravel tyres and with gravel suspension setup also. This is my reason why I don't rate it with 5 stars although the track battle of using all k20 engine put in different chasis was very interesting and entertaining. For Best Motoring video fans, I think you should buy it ... :)",1214438400,2,469,4.7317073170731705
