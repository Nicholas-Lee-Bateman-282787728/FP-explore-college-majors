2638869,1,B000HLDC52,"Just as all Halestorm movies, this one blew.  And sucked.  And blew a little more.  Embarrassingly enough, I was an extra in this movie, and I know from first hand experience how unorganized and cheap the production of this movie was.  I couldn't tell if the time period was in the 70s, 80s, 90s, or recently took place in Eastern Idaho.  And not only is it another lame and over-the-top Mormon satire, it's a complete knock off of Dodgeball (which was hardly mediocre at best).

To sum it all up into one word---  Barf.",1190764800,4,520,4.468085106382978
2638870,4,B000HLDC52,"I had a chance to watch this movie with a mixed group of people in Salt Lake City.  By mixed, I mean that some of us were Latter Day Saints and some were Methodists.  We have all played softball in both the Utah Protestant leagues as well as the LDS leagues.  My brother, a protestant, played on an LDS league basketball team in the late 1960s.  It was rough house basketball. My brother got his nose broken in an LDS ward basketball game.

This movie is not ""true to life"" but it is true satire of the real situation when some people play for a church league.

I am a Methodist who was born, raised and still live in Utah.  My LDS friends and I have played on the Methodist, mixed men and women co ed team and on the all male LDS team. All of us have played on the same teams in both leagues. We are not the best athletes.  We are probably the worst sports.  The best sports on these teams are the men and women who have actually played high school and or college sports.

The situations and attituedes in this movie are real.  There is a little flare for the dramatic by adding Hot Rod Huntley and Mark Eaton to announce the final game, but the situations and the attitudes displayed in the movie are true to reality in both the Protestant and LDS leagues in Utah.",1167004800,10,1266,4.190082644628099

8140258,3,B000HLDC52,"I did not know what to expect from a ""Mormon"" movie.  This was recommended.  Maybe closer to Utah these are funnier, but I did enjoy it and I don't feel that it was a wast of my time. As a LDS person so far away from Utah it seems like a nother planet, the humor sometimes takes a minute or two for me to figure out.",1206403200,6,316,3.772727272727273
