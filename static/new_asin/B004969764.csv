4287593,5,B004969764,"This young woman has effected my life spiritually.  The purity of womanhood is recognisable in the manner of Mary, mother of the Christ  Marta seems so perfect for the life she leads and I always think about her praying for me - that is what she leaves you with.

Nuns have always been a mystery to me.  They are.  Marta lit up the candle to  my soul.

Her family is just as inspiring and devoted to God, with their own Chapel on a beautiful farm, still with diversity of social and spiritual differences.  Marta is the soul.

It is wonderful to know that I can get up and know that this beautiful person is just across the ocean praying for me.  What a wonderful gift, Lord.  Thank you for letting me find Marta.",1357603200,9,713,4.285714285714286

4287595,5,B004969764,"I found it to be a very interesting look at how a young Swedish woman becomes interested in becoming a Carmelite nun.  I hadn't thought of Sweden as being a particularly religious country - especially not a Catholic country, so this also a fascinating look at a whole family that is not only very religious, but Catholic enough to build a chapel on their farm.  A very moving documentary, and a well-balanced look at the subject.",1295222400,33,429,4.631578947368421
4287596,5,B004969764,This is a deeply human and sublimely spiritual story of a religous Vocation set within the context of both a loving family and a doubt filled secular society. The lack of artifice and profound intimacy of the exchanges and the relationships make on feel priviledged to watch this. A beautiful and Inspiring Experience.,1288742400,39,318,5.018867924528302

8418838,5,B004969764,This was a thought provoking documentary.  Following her as she went into the convent; seeing how her family was so proud yet so sad because they missed her.  Makes you realize just what these ladies give up to follow their calling.,1397692800,3,232,4.634146341463414
8418839,5,B004969764,"Highly recommend!  Gives a wonderful account of a young woman who felt called by God and chose to answer that call.  If you know any young women who are curious about the Religious life or are seriously considering, this is a great movie to see.",1388275200,3,245,4.4222222222222225
8418840,3,B004969764,"Very interesting but I don't care for the fact that these women are expected to not be in contact much with their families.  I appreciate the dedication to prayer and living a pure life, but I felt sorry for her younger brother and other siblings, that they rarely get to see their sister.",1386288000,2,289,4.452830188679245
8418841,5,B004969764,"I'm not Catholic, but I found this documentary by accident on EWTN and was interested enough to continue watching. I watched the whole thing, and was surprised and very inspired, and happy to have seen this. My opinion of nuns and monasteries is changed forever, and I have a lot of respect for them. It's a great documentary, high quality, and very well done.",1368316800,10,360,4.640625
