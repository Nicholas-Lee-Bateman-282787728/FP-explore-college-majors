766564,4,6304017626,"Infinitely better than the two films immediately following it (Murderers' Row and The Ambushers), but not as good as the final Helm film (The Wrecking Crew). Silly villain as played by Victor Buono and Stella Stevens  was not as good here as Sharon Tate was in TWC. The plot is presented  decently enough here though. Note that the villain's underground lair  preceded that of James Bond's Blofeld by more than a year.",962582400,2,418,4.777777777777778
766565,5,6304017626,"Although I loved reading James Bond books and Matt Helm books, I also enjoyed the first movies of those books very much. After ""Thunderball"" 007 moved further away from the book each new  movie. In the meantime I discovered Matt Helm on film. The first film was a  very humorous impression of the book ""The Silencers"". Dean  Martin, to me, was a very good choice for the Helm-figure. His jokes  appealed to me, especially the autoradio-joke on his own hit-music. Also  the joke with the reverse-firing gun takes care of some fun. But I must  admit: Stella Stevens' appearance was the real finishing touch. I still  have a clear image in my mind (after 33 years) of the scene where Helm  tears off her dress in the hotel room. I guess it must be considered now a  typical 60's movie, but reviewing it will undoubtedly amuse you again. If  so ... you could also try other Helm-movies, especially ""The  ambushers"", and another amusing Spy spoof, with James Coburn, called  ""Derek Flint"". You could even try Bond's own spoof ""Casino  Royale"", but that's very much pop-art and confusing, next to being  funny. Even if you don't like secret agents you can enjoy these movies. But  """"The silencers"" is the best as a try-out!",946080000,4,1217,4.6745283018867925
766566,4,6304017626,"This has to be one of the best spy/Bond spoofs coming out of the spy genre sixties. Many elements of Austin Powers originate here...the desert underground lair, Buono as the ""Dr. Evil"" villian, to name a few.  Dean Martin is biting cool. The automated bath with Lovey Cravesit and his  station wagon with slide-out bar and beds is the ultimate secret agent SUV.  See it to appreciate not only this film but to appreciate Bond and Austin  Powers.",921369600,2,445,4.666666666666667

767072,5,6304017626,"This first Matt Helm movie is a must-have if you're a Dean Martin fan, especially at this price! This is wide-screen and I didn't see any censorship as some of the really old reviews here mentioned.  I wish they were still producing all 3 other Matt Helm movies on DVD!

If you have never seen a Matt Helm movie, you will need to keep an open mind. Dino was widely known as the ""King of Cool"" and this movie as silly as it is, definitely shows why he got that nickname.  I mean who else can pull off a full bar in the back seat of his ""station wagon"" and still be suave about it. This movie clearly helped inspire Mike Myers in creating Austin Powers and many of the other characters in those movies, more so than the James Bond films.

If you're looking for a serious movie, don't look here.  If you're looking for classic old-time comedy, this is for you!",1451174400,5,857,4.233128834355829

767136,5,6304017626,"I saw this film waaaaay back when it was first released and it has always been a favorite of mine over the years. I just saw what I think is a restored version on cable the other day. The colours were vivid and excellent AND it was widescreen. I hope this release is the same. It is also the complete film, at least as I remember it. I've seen versions on TV that obviously were edited and incomplete and the horrid ""pan-and-scan"" mess. Anyway, Dean Martin does a very cool job of being a very cool secret agent in the very cool 1960's. Contrary to some critiques, Dino does a fine job here with just enough tongue-in-cheek suaveness to let us all in on the send-up he's doing as  an archetype/stereotype of the cool, detached spy a la James Bond/Sean Connery that was in vogue then. Stella Stevens is very funny here and almost steals the film from Dino. Daliah Lavi is quite lovely and very sensuous as the elegant but treacherous double-agent and Victor Buono plays his part as the sinister Tung-Tze for all its worth (although I'm sure in today's PC world, Buono's portrayal would garner much criticism). Cyd Charisse has an excellent opening song and dance sequence (she mimes the song; the vocal belongs to Vikki Carr!) which sets up the plot of the film.

767376,4,6304017626,"If you dig Dean Martin, glamorous gals, or groovy gadgets, you'll love THE SILENCERS, the first of Dino's fondly-remembered ""Matt Helm"" films (based on the series of books by Donald Hamilton).

With tongue planted firmly in cheek, Dean Martin plays Matt Helm, part-time spy and full-time ladies' man, assigned to stop power-mad megalomaniac Tung-Tze (Victor Buono in Asian makeup) from destroying the world with a rogue nuclear missile.  Stella Stevens is Gail, a scatterbrained innocent caught up in the action.

Forget about trying to follow the plot, just sit back and revel in the outrageous clothes (designed by Moss Mabry), and the comic skills of Dean Martin and Stella Stevens, who both give sensational performances.  Ms Stevens in particular will stun you with her physical comedy and luminous beauty.  Dancing legend Cyd Charisse (with singing dubbed by Vikki Carr) performs the Main Title sequence plus ""Santiago"".  The bevy of screen beauties also includes Daliah Lavi, Nancy Kovack, Beverly Adams and Barbara Burgess.

At the end of the shot, Cyd draws up a zipper from her hip to her armpit, revealing more than just a little leg, but still legal.  You can imagine my disappointment on subsequent showings to find that the title sequence had been cut short by the network censors.

You can also imagine how disappointed I was to find that this DVD has a reworked title sequence, which dissolves quickly from the end of the dance number before too much is revealed, to the I.C.E. shield on the office wall.

The only way its watchable, is to think of how Mike Myers would adapt some of it for Austin Powers later. Unlike the Bond and Flint flicks, this one is sort of a musical with Dino himself singing half a dozen numbers. The action scenes are stupid. Dino has not a single redeeming quality other than the adolescent wisecracks. The effects are extremely cheesy, and I can't even bear to watch the ""laser"" scene - the noisiest non-lasers ever envisioned. The women are treated like props more than any other movie I can think of - half a dozen beauties quickly pass through the movie during the credits and first 20 minutes - until it settles on Stella and Israeli actress Daliah. This movie was an obvious cheap copy of the Bond and Flint movies at the time, and it does not hold up well after 40 years.",1182988800,2,924,4.377906976744186

767381,4,6304017626,"Following four highly successful serious spy films starring Sean Connery as that world-famous fictional British spy James Bond, American film companies began playing with the idea of producing their own spy films with equally world-famous, but more humorous, spies in their own James Bond spoofs.  On January 16, 1966, the first James Bond-inspired spoof hit the big screen starring James Coburn (1928-2002) as Derek Flint in Twentieth Century Fox's film ""our Man Flint"".  Only one month later, on February 18, 1966, a second James Bond-inspired spoof hit the big screen starring the well-known comedic actor/lounge singer Dean Martin (1917-1995) as the semi-retired spy Matt Helm in ""The Silencers"", which was produced by Claude Productions and Meadway, and distributed by Columbia Pictures.

Similar to Derek Flint, Matt Helm loves to be surrounded by beautiful women; but unlike the super-serious & high-tech Flint, Helm is far more laid back.  Helm's bedroom is equipped with a rotating circular bed (which was also part of Mike Myer's 1997 portrayal of British superstar/super-spy Austin Powers in ""Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery""), which can also role forward and raise at an angle so that it can let Helm (and anyone else in Helm's bed) slide into a waiting olypic-sized bubble-bath.  Doing his best to avoid being used in yet another spy mission, Helm leaves his expensive home and travels to Acapulco where an unexpected blond woman is waiting in his bedroom.  While in his arms, she is shot from behind by one of Helm's former spy coworkers Tina (Daliah Lavi, who appeared in yet another James Bond-inspired spoof in 1967: the highly comedic ""Casino Royale"" that also starred Woody Allen, David Niven and Peter Sellers).  Discovering that they're being watched by operatives working for the evil mastermind Tung-Tze, a.k.a., ""Big-O"" (Victor Buono, 1938-1982), Helm & Tina escape in his station wagon to Phoenix, where they expect to find a highly sought after computer tape.  The tape is in possession of a singer named Sarita (Cyd Charisse), who ends up shot while performing on stage, but hands the tape over to the highly-accident prone Gail Hendrix (Stella Stevens) who runs on stage to help her.  Helm & Tina quickly rush Gail out of the club and away from enemy agents, but suspect that she is also an enemy agent working for ""Big-O"".  After being temporarily knocked out by gas shooting out of a phone, Helm is assisted by his & Tina's boss Sam Gunther (Robert Webber, 1924-1989), who also prevents Gail from escaping.  Helm then takes Gail to San Juan, which is where Sarita told her that something was going to happen before she died; but can Helm stop the dastardly Tung-Tze and his evil plan?  You'll just have to watch the film to find out!

In typical 1960's motif and humor, ""The Silencers"" is still a very humorous spoof to this day and I rate it with 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it to anyone who enjoys a non-serious spoof. Dean Martin would portray Matt Helm in three more subsequent films: ""Murderer's Row"" (later in 1966), ""The Ambushers"" (1967, which is my personal favorite) and ""The Wrecking Crew"" (1969).  Hopefully these other three Matt Helm films will also be released on DVD.",1110672000,13,3228,4.9647495361781075
767382,4,6304017626,"I won't review the film as this has been done by others. However, I would like to add some thoughts about the ""cropping"" issue--

To many fans of DVD, a key selling point is seeing a film the way it was orginally presented in the theatre.

Most people are aware today that widescreen films shown on a full frame standard TV's are cropped-- that is, they are panned and scanned and you lose information (images). Pan & Scan changes the composition of the film.

With this in mind, people expect to see ALL of the composition when a film comes out on DVD and is viewed on a widescreen televison-- not less. However, there are exceptions:

In some circumstances, the director of a film will compose a shot with more information than is meant to be conveyed to the audience.

The ""extra"" information is never meant to be seen. When the film is ""matted"" for release, the additional info is covered up and you are left with the director's original conception of the shot.

Now here's the thing: when the film is shown on commercial television in a standard full screen format, the ""matts"" are opened up and the film subjected to pan and scan. In this case, you may now see parts of the shot that were covered up-- and also lose other parts that were originally shown.

The bottom line here is that this release of ""The Silencers"" shows the film in its ""matted"" form the way it was shown in theatre's. People who have seen the film on television all these years became accustomed to seeing the ""open matt"" pan & scan version. They have seen more information than was intended and now think that the released DVD version has been ""cropped"" because the afore mentioned images are now missing.

Here's a great example:  (warning: spoilers below)

A previous reviewer makes mention that in a certain part of the film, actress Nancy Kovack is shot in the back and we her bare bottom. This reviewer then complains that in the DVD version, we don't see that far down. The conclusion that is drawn is that this scene is to riske' for the DVD version for some reason and has been cropped or edited out.

As explained above, this is simply not true.

In the pan & scan ""open matt"" scene, we see the actress wearing only a shirt and pantyhose. Dean Martin is holding her and we see Kovack from the back. As she is shot, Kovack arches up and we see her pantyhosed butt come out of the shirt.

This ""nyloned butt"" shot was never intended to be seen-- remember this was a film made in the mid 60's-- nudity simply wasn't going to make it in to a film that was rated the way this one was.

Further, there was also another bit of nudity just slightly earlier in the same scene that is in the ""open matt"" pan & scan  version-- Kovack in shirt and pantyhose rushes up to Dino and we see both of the actors side by side.

As Kovack turns towards Martin, her short shirt lifts and parts slightly, and we see a glimpse of Kovacks ""front"" (for want of a more descriptive term).

Again, this was not meant to be seen and never would have made it past the censors during the original release.

So, in this instance, viewers have seen a more racy version of the film on televison than was ever shown in theatre's-- the complete opposite of what is expected with a DVD release-- hence the complaints.",1105142400,40,3267,4.416666666666667

767446,2,6304017626,"I've waited many years to see this fearsome foursome of cheese find a decent release in DVD. Sadly, thanks to bad cropping and seemingly random censorship, it still hasn't happened yet.

The four films are, of course, The Silencers, Murderers' Row, The Ambushers, and The Wrecking Crew. (A fifth intallment was storeyboarded but never shot.)

Letting the studio off the hook by saying things like ""widescreen areas always crop full frame versions,"" is being much too gracious in the face of these money-grabbing studio weasels who also CUT entire parts of the film and never even gave you an original trailer.

And I should know about the widescreen concept, since I am, after all, the chairman of the WWS - the Widescreen Watchers Society. (Yes, my organization has a movie site online, but an Amazon review is not the place to plug it by posting links to it.)

Rather I just wanted to point out that it is instead within the ""full frame"" or ""standard screen"" format that all cropping takes place. The most dominant style is pan-and -scan, which is done by zooming in on whatever the film editor decides is the most important area on screen at any given moment.

That's why you often end up with the ridiculous sight of one person chattering happily away to the air for long periods of time, since you can't see the other person he's talking to. And because of the zoom effect, naturally you also get a more blurred focus on the overall picture.

But a presentation in widescreen, whether it be a regular rectangle (Vista-Vision style) or a more narrow rectangle (Panavison style), or somewhere in between, never cuts out frames and/or zooms in after the fact at any point. This gives you the vast difference of ultimate picture composition in crystal clarity, resulting in the best total viewing experience possible - which is why the original director filmed it that way for its theatrical release in the first place!

How today's studios stamping out inferior DVDs think the public will never notice such a huge difference is completely mind-boggling! And who buys most of the DVDs of older movies anyway? Film buffs who are very picky about such things to begin with!

RECOMMENDATION: Wait until all four films are put out together in an improved deluxe edition - TRUE widescreen (non-cropped and non-censored), featuring behind the scenes featurettes (which they shot back in the '60s as long commercials for such films), surviving crew interviews, trailers, etc. Otherwise, forget it.

Hey, Rat Pack fans - or just fans of Dean Martin in general - you know ol' Dino deserves far BETTER than this shoddy treatment! Mama mia!",1081123200,87,2630,4.852678571428571

767450,3,6304017626,"For fans of the original character, the Matt Helm films can cause feelings of ambivalence.  On one hand, the films are enjoyable as pure escapist fun, with no pretensions whatever of seriousness.  Cool swinger, and singer Dean Martin portrays Helm as one of the most laid back, and least motivated operatives ever.  His missions are viewed more as opportunities to have a good time, rather than as serious business.  At appropriate moments Dino will even break into a song.  These films are among the most light-hearted fluff, to come out of the 60's spy craze.

Surprisingly, the cartoonish character seen on the screen evolved from something quite different.  Matt Helm, is the literary creation of the late Donald Hamilton.  The Helm in Hamilton's books, is a rugged, and tough operator, who bears no resemblance to the breezy film persona.  Hamilton's novels are serious, often brutal stories, of espionage, with a distinct American flavor.  Helm was an American literary equivalent to Ian Fleming's Bond.  With the character being so debased in the translation to the screen, an opportunity to serious challenge Bond, purposely was not taken.  In many ways the potential of the character was wasted, but what's done is done.  While it is certainly possible to enjoy Helm both in books and film, the character bears almost no similarity, beyond his profession as a photographer, residence in the Southwest, and the codename ""Eric"".

The Silencers, is the first of the four Helm films, and it takes some of its plot elements from Hamilton's first Helm novel, ""Death of a Citizen"".  Though much is definitely played for laughs, the story does hold together pretty well.  With the semi-retired Eric, being reluctantly brought back into service as an agent of ICE (Intelligence Counter Espionage), by a lovely ex-partner (Daliah Lavi).  Heading ICE is James Gregory, as MacDonald.  The USA is threatened with nuclear assault, by the forces of Big O, lead by Tung-Tze (Victor Buono).  Helm's mission to recover a secret tape, takes him to Phoenix, and a meeting with klutzy Gail Hendrix (Stella Stevens).  Together, Helm and Hendricks, take on the forces of Big O, and foil their plot to alter the course of a missile with a nuclear warhead.

Dean Martin plays a caricature of himself, rather than making any serious attempt to become Matt Helm.  His willingness to then make himself the brunt of so much humor, shows that is he is in this project strictly for laughs.  While Dean does an adequate job in the hand-to-hand combat department, the action in the film is rather limited.  A low speed car chase, while perhaps realistic, looks pretty lame, as are the special effects in the cave battle at the film's conclusion.  One bright spot is voluptuous Stella Stevens, who is pretty good in a comic role.

Introduced here are several elements which will reoccur in subsequent films, such as Helm's tilting circular bed that spills occupants into a pool, his secretary Lovey Kravezit (Beverly Adams), and silly gadget weapons.  Another pattern that starts with this film, concerns Matt's leading ladies, with one usually being American, and one being European.  The film finishes with a promo for the next Helm film, Murderer's Row.

The Silencers sets the tone for the films that follow, which if anything, are less serious with even flimsier plots.  The Matt Helm series is not for everyone, and it may require some ""regression"" back to a mid-sixties mindset to appreciate them.  But for those who can ""dig it"", they offer a rather mindless escape from reality.  The Matt Helm series, along with the Derek Flint films, remain some of the most popular and beloved of the 60's spy spoofs.",1039392000,7,3687,4.964110929853181

The only downfall I give this film is that during the remarkable opening title sequence, where you see Cyd Charisse and two other women, who should get the recognition for appearing in the film albeit of a few minutes, doing their little striptease routines, as an possible twist to the Bond title sequences where you only see the silouhette of their nude form. I hope in the DVD release, they show the making of the movieand of the title sequence.
