8044875,3,B000768G94,"The cast is extraordinary, especially Bogarde. The story takes long to gets into. The location in Austria
is nice to look at.",1377648000,,125,4.7272727272727275
8044876,4,B000768G94,"I mean look at it: ""For me,"" John W. Levin writes, ""it's all about the cast. Plot means next to nothing."" Well, that sounds like a rational basis for criticism. So, what, if the movie starred Laurence Olivier, Humphrey Bogart, Bette Davis and James Dean, but the script was literally typed by chimpanzee, you'd be like, ""I'm there! Count me in!""? Yeah, buddy.

Then he says, ""I like Bogarde and Ava Gardner. I hoped that would be enough. It wasn't."" So, then, the plot DOES matter..? Be consistent in your standards. And maybe put enough effort into your reviews so that they're longer than two sentences. Otherwise, please don't waste people's time with your unhelpful, poorly thought-out gibberish.

Make no mistake: this is a top-notch espionage/political drama in the realistic mold of Le Carre""s best work, not a James Bond spy thriller/shoot-'em-up. (Nothing against 007 - ""Skyfall"" was one of my favorite movies last year - but J.B.'s movies obviously don't have a lot to do with the real world.)

The cast here is uniformly excellent, with young Timothy Dalton a stand-out, and even Bekim Fehmiu (such a stiff in ""The Adventurers"") acquitting himself well as an exiled Eastern bloc political leader. Beautiful Nicole Calfan (as a female assassin) has a surprisingly revealing nude scene for a PG-rated film (though this is a '70s PG we're talking about here).

And director Cyril Frankel is a truly underrated talent - check out his other films, too, like ""The Very Edge"" (if you can find a copy), which stars Jeremy Brett as a rapist, as well as ""Never Take Sweets from a Stranger,"" a still-shockingly relevant and powerful Hammer-produced drama about child molestation.

My only real criticism here is about the fullframe presentation of the film on VHS, since it was originally shot in Panavision and the print, as was the practice 30 years ago, has been panned-&-scanned. I realize that this isn't really fair to pick on, since pretty much all VHS was full-frame back in 'the old days,' but still...it is an undeniable flaw. Minor and even less than distracting, depending on one's sensitivity to such matters, but still worth mentioning.

Overall, though, this is a really underrated and little-known film well-worth re-discovery.",1376092800,,2243,5.0
