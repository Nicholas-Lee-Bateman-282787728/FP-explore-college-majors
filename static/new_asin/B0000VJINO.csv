8003751,2,B0000VJINO,"This film's plot did not exactly meet with the description I had read.  It was described as being a thriller revenge story with suspense and tension, and it could have been that, too.  Instead, it bogged down and lost my interest.  I still watched to see if there would be revenge, though we didn't get to see a revenge plot develop as I had hoped.  It's well-acted but not very interesting.",1216252800,,391,4.464788732394366
