The DVD treats the subject breast cancer in a very sympathetical way and each of the womens' story reflects a part of my own cancer history, cancer experience and efforts to survive.

8462044,5,B0058OQ4AI,"I am in love with this documentary. Such an important look at our assumptions about beauty and being a woman.  Reminded me of the Norweigian project, Det Dobbelte Kyss by Ellen Francke from many years ago. A must see for every American woman.",1339718400,3,242,4.627906976744186
8462045,5,B0058OQ4AI,"A refreshing step away from pink ribbon culture that shows real young women dealing with cancer who have decided to show their scars to the world. The video description is slightly misleading in that breast cancer is not the only cancer represented -- while three of the young women tackled breast cancer as their primary malignancy, the fourth had ovarian cancer and elected to have the mastectomy to lessen her future cancer risks. An interesting photography project and a thought-provoking documentary.",1309392000,15,505,5.246913580246914
