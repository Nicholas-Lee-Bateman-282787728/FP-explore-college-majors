8130438,3,B000GBFRME,"I really enjoyed this segment on the HCZ, but was shocked when it was over.  It only lasted about 10 minutes (if that), and for the price of the DVD I expected a lot more.  If they had combined different segments from other 60 minutes episodes (even on related education topics if not the HCZ itself) or included cut footage - SOMETHING more than the individual one-time segment - it would be worth recommending for purchase.  However, at this price, you'd get alot more out of reading the loads of information -  background, press releases, media spotlights, etc. - available at HCZ.org or even on YouTube!  Even the books by Paul Tough and Mr. Canada himself cost less than this DVD.",1293235200,,685,4.628099173553719
8130439,3,B000GBFRME,I purchased this because I was hoping to get an in depth look of the HCZ. The program is very short (less than 15 minutes). I was under the impression that it was a full hour because of it being on 60 minutes and the cost was high for a dvd. I also bought Geoffrey Canada's book which I am reading. I should have just stuck with the book and skipped the dvd. I didn't learn anything new from the dvd.,1256601600,7,400,3.950617283950617

Geoff Canada is a true-blue American hero. Don't miss this inspiring and touching view of the man and his brilliant work.

8130441,5,B000GBFRME,"This is a wonderful report about Geoffrey Canada's Harlem Chidlren's Zone & Promises Academy. Ed Bradley was the reporter and it was bittersweet to see him conduct the interview with his usual intellegence and warmth. There is one thing to be aware of when ordering 60 Minutes DVD's: You will wait at least a week to receive them no matter what type of shipping speed you select. I am a professor and use 60 Minutes pieces in my classes. The slow delievery has, at times, interfered with my planning and pacing. However, the interview on its own is one of the best!",1231718400,3,565,4.549019607843137
