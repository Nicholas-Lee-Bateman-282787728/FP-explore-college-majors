8360626,1,B002B2740Y,"The show's of this series are excellent. My problem is these episodes have been released on so many other Civil War Productions by The History Channel and the majority of the rest of the series haven't been released at all, not even on VHS. Common on History Channel, quit re-hashing the same few episodes and release the rest. Same goes for ""The Real West"" which was out at the same time hosted by Kenny Rogers!",1479340800,,412,4.506666666666667
