4109852,5,B003COG18G,"The main talking point about this production of Handel's Admeto, re di Tessaglia for the Festspiel Orchester Gttingen in 2009 is clearly Doris Drrie's extraordinary Samurai setting of the opera.  Notionally in the same period as the original 1727 production but translated to the samurai culture of Japan of this period (albeit in a highly stylised fashion), there are questions however about whether Drrie's fascination for Japanese settings, while appropriate for the likes of Turandot and Madame Butterfly, can really be effectively applied to the Greek mythological subject of Handel's Baroque opera, Admeto.

Happily, the answer is, yes - it works and it works exceptionally well.  If nothing else, the stripped back minimal staging and measured formalised gestures of the Japanese setting suit the conventions of opera seria, with their being no unnecessary elaboration or clutter to distract from the virtuoso solo singing.  But with the bold lighting, coloured backgrounds, silk screens and shadow play, not to mention the extraordinary use of Takashi Endo's Japanese butoh dancers (most of them almost entirely naked), the director manages to make the emotional content of the subject tangible as well as heightened.

That subject is a mythological one that is well covered in opera, particularly in opera seria - the story of Admetus, the king of Thessaly, whose life is spared from a fatal illness by the sacrifice of his wife Alcestes.  Gluck's opera Alceste covers the same story in a rather cut-down form without the Antigone subplot (Robert Wilson's minimalist production of Gluck's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alceste/dp/B001IOMW76/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alceste</a>&nbsp;from the Chtelet Theatre in Paris, available on DVD, compares favourably with the production of Admeto here), but the storyline is much more involved in Handel's version.  To their credit of the director and producer, the staging here is magnificent, bringing out depths in the relationships and conflicts between the characters, particularly in the case of Alceste's transformation into a samurai warrior accompanied by the long black-haired ghostly form of Endo's butoh dancer representing her Jealousy.  The sight of Ercole (Hercules) as a sumo wrestler in a foam fat-suit may however take more getting used to.  The production is not without humour and may not be to a traditionalist's taste, but it never detracts from the drama or the characterisation.

Tim Mead is fine as Admeto, but more so than the two male altos, it's the female roles - Marie Arnot as Alceste and particularly Kirsten Blaise as Antigone - that have the chance here to show a greater emotional and vocal range, and the chance to put some strong acting behind their parts as well.  Using period instruments (happily resisting any urge to include traditional Japanese instrumentation), the Festspiel Orchester of Gttingen under the direction of Nicholas McGegan is also noteworthy.

The specifications of the Blu-ray are impressive - a 1080/60i, 16:9 encode, and a sparkling, vibrant DTS HD Master Audio 5.1 mix that far surpasses the limited distribution of the PCM 2.0 mix.  There is not a great deal of detail in the staging to benefit from the High Definition transfer, but the reproduction of the vivid and striking colour schemes is nothing short of stunning.  Subtitles are in a slightly small font (in Italian, English, German and French), and occasionally move to the top of the screen when necessary so as not to obscure the performers.  The BD comes with a thin booklet giving a synopsis and information on the production, but a 21-minute featurette presents this better in the form of interviews with all the performers and the production team.",1275868800,12,3771,5.400340715502556
8394341,5,B003COG18G,"I own many opera videos and this production of Handel's Admeto might be the most beautiful opera production I have ever seen.

The costumes, lighting, and makeup are all first rate.  This production combines opera with modern dance to present a sensual rendition of a 300 year old opera.

Although Handel's opera takes place in Greece and the production takes place in Japan, I was not bothered since it still did a fine job of telling the story.  The production did a good job of making the characters and story come to life.

If you love Handel, you need to see this video.",1486944000,,575,4.543689320388349
8394342,4,B003COG18G,"The orchestral playing and solo singing in the musical side of this production from the Internationale Handel-Festspiele Gottingen, from May of 2009, is under the capable direction of Nicholas McGegan. It's great to see him wedged sideways with his Festspiel Orchestra into the tiny pit of the Deutsches Theater; you have complete confidence that he'll keep things moving in a Historically Informed and dramatically appropriate way. Even though this is 7 years old now, the C Major Blu-ray is from a very fine HD source, and the surround sound is outstanding.

But it's naturally the theatrical concept of Doris Dorrie that causes the most discussion, since it adds an additional layer of abstraction to the already formalized conventions of Baroque opera. This layer, the transposition of the ancient Greek source materials from 18th century Europe to the Samurai culture - also 18th century - of Japan, didn't convince me at first. But then a set-piece of outstanding beauty justified the entire project for me, Ercole the Hero dressed as a Sumo wrestler included. This was Alceste's recitative 'Non lagrimate, o miei seguaci' and her aria 'Faro cosi piu bella', in which the heroine tells her entourage that she plans to kill herself to save her husband Admeto. Beginning as shadows behind a screen - another layer of abstraction - Alceste and her maids form a tableau vivante, and though they emerge in three dimensions, the formalized beauty remains and they seem no more flesh and blood than before. Indeed, with their pastel robes and faces painted white, they're more like faded early Renaissance frescoes than actual people. When Alceste returns behind the screen and the deed is done, again in a scene that could be a painting, it's sad, but sadder still because all the time Alceste (Marie Arnet) is singing an aria of exquisite beauty.

There are other highlights in the staging, and each is lamp-shaded to ensure we're very much aware of the conventions being flouted and new conventions being inserted. This is the very acme of self-aware stage-craft. The talented members of the Mamu Dance Theatre are variously ghosts, sheep, demons and deer, each time in set-pieces that I'm sure are no more artificial than the original ballets from Handel's time. This is highly imaginative stage-craft, nearly as imaginative as Handel's music. What it isn't is subtle, and of course Handel is a master of subtle effects, musical and dramatic.

Singing honours go to Marie Arnet, of course, but also to Tim Mead as Admeto and to Kirsten Blaise as Antigona. All are fine actors as well as excellent singers, and remind us of the humanity underneath the 18th century European and Japanese conventions and the 21st century International operatic emphasis on whimsy, irony and self-reference. The more opera tries to subvert itself, the more like traditional opera it seems, and that's largely to the good, when musicianship and stagecraft and technology together can create something as beautiful as this.",1470960000,,3004,5.089249492900609
8394343,2,B003COG18G,"As I understand Robert Greenbergs lectures the great purpose in the original rise of opera was to recapture the lost art of the Ancient Greek Theater.  Though the composers, librettists and producers understood that music and dance played an integral role they had no means of accessing these lost arts.  They had to try to reconstruct the performance of Greek plays and mythical stories as best as possible using the technology, talent and knowledge of their day.

We are not faced with such obstacles when trying to produce even early opera.  Scores survive as well as other historical documents that permit us to understand the composers work and intent.  In modern times we have audio and now digital video recordings of performances.  While making art available to a wider audience and preserving the performance for posterity, the technology comes with a responsibility to do justice and honor the composers work.

The simple fact is that folks such as myself may never see a performance of Admeto.

The opera concerns Greek myth and the Japanese setting is quite awkward and, frankly misses the mark by about 6000 miles.  Having Japanese people calling out to Greek gods is strange to say the least.  The producer had the potential to stage this in a traditional Greek setting rather than impose upon a pseudo-Japanese setting a story, culture and ideas that are radically foreign to it.  While the Japanese setting permits some creativity it wears thin after the first scene.

I was disappointed by some of the singing and especially the acting.  When the producer chooses abstraction often it is at the expense of intense acting.  The audience is distracted by the colors and strangeness of the production and acting takes a second seat (BTW  many of the colors clash and the set is hard on the eyes). An alternative conclusion would be that the requisite talent and skills in acting and directing are lacking.

The choreography was very strange and resembled a post-modern zombie apocalypse, drawing on the use of nudity and strange costuming to engage the audience.  Again a major distraction.

I put forward a recent production of Handels Hercules as an example of Baroque opera done both modern and well.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Haendel-Hercules-Blu-ray/dp/B01BMPJ3G8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Haendel: Hercules [Blu-ray</a>]  I am afraid the current effort fails and dishonors Handel and his work.

Ancient Greek civilization left us jewels that were lost after the fall of Rome and the decline of Europe into the dark ages.  Let us not lose our great artistic works to the darkness of post-modernism with its peccadillos incurvatus in se.  This is a work that highlights the self-centeredness of Doris Dorrie rather than the art of G. F. Handel.  Fie!

Would someone please produce and perform these operas as intended!  It would be a truly great and joyous achievement blessing generations upon generations of future opera lovers.",1470441600,,2992,5.235294117647059
8394344,5,B003COG18G,"The integration of staging, lighting, costuming, movement, and dance to enhance the outstanding singing and music and the impeccable video and audio recording on this DVD of this production is equal to any early opera I've come across. The setting in 18th century Japan never stopped being strange to me, still it worked. Even though the setting and costuming is the single most striking element, that really isn't the focus of the production. That is, all the other elements, including the Butoh dance, would work as well with the setting changed to 18th century Europe or classical Greece.",1380240000,,591,5.040816326530612
8394345,3,B003COG18G,"I don't get the point! I'm an old traditionalist (Kerstin Flagstaf, Eleanor Steber, Jan Peerce, Lily Pons) and when faced with a new eccentric production of an old master, I usually recoil. This rendering of Handel's beauiful Admeto is a case in point. I have played it several times over a long period of time and like it less each time. It's like a topical joke, once you've heard it, it isn't funny any more. The male singers (except for the Prince who cannot hold a pitch) are fine excellent performers. The two women (M. Arnot & K. Blaise) are even better. Both beautifully portrayed their parts and effortlessly handled the runs and trills and brought dramatic intensity where needed. The sheep were cute but the rest was pointless. Was anything gained by costuming this as a mock Japanese drama? There is nothing remotely Japanese in story, legend or music. I must say that after three times viewing it became irritating. The only effect that I still consider relavant and enhancing is the figure of Alecto (jealousy) that followed Alceste around for awhile. Yes, I'm sure this production will be an asset to Doris Dorrie's career in the eyes of the avant guard. But Handel doesn't need or deserve this kind of hacking about to make it palatable. This is one of Handel's most beautiful scores; beautiful aria after beautiful aria. As one friend said it's like eating a whole jar of honey. Handel's opera can hold their own with minimal amount of production effects and the beauty of the music will shine through.",1331769600,6,1519,4.757575757575758
8394346,5,B003COG18G,"I saw Admeto on the Major bluray excerpts section. I bought it because I loved Dorrie's traditional Japanese staging,which fits the fixed conventions of baroque opera. The tonal values of the various backgrounds and Womens attire, are very much like those of the early 20th century artist Marie Laurencin,a friend of Apollinaire. Dorrie certainly has an understanding of lighting and colour. The sheep are a fine touch. Wrestlers and large linen Japanese masks make for an interesting experience. The Gottingen orchestra is conducted by Nick McGegan. The dance is in the hands of Tadashi Endo and his Ten-man Mamu dance Theatre. Mead as Admeto is good in his part as are the other singers,Alceste, Marie Arnet Antigona-Kirsten Blaise. The cast are young. Does one of Handels popular operas work in this format? Yes. A must for Handel Fans.",1323907200,3,839,5.086956521739131
8394347,5,B003COG18G,Admeto is a 2010 C Major Entertainment production set in the stylishly ritualized world of Samurai Japan. Doris Drrie is responsible for this setting and the minimalist stage production. Could this work with a Handel opera one could ask oneself. The answer is yes. Tim Mead is tremendous in his role as Admeto. Nicholas McGegan leads the Festspielorchester Gttingen. The pace is right on the mark and I have a feeling that McGegan truly understands the spirit of Handel. The sound quality is astounding. Eva Zllner has written the music notes. Translated into English by Stewart Spencer. Truly an amazing production. I very much enjoyed it. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.,1319760000,2,672,5.118181818181818
8394348,2,B003COG18G,"The music, voices, dancing, and costumes are ideal, but getting the English subtitles to appear is very difficult as is getting the actual opera (after the video introduction sequence) to start.

The Japanese setting works very well.  The score brings The Water Music to mind.

However, I recommend it only to those who have the patience to work through the tech problems.",1284681600,3,372,4.967741935483871
8394349,5,B003COG18G,"Admeto, re di Tessaglia (1727) by Georg Friedrich H&auml;ndel is the most romantic opera that I have heard and watched by the composer from Halle. It`s a rejoice to see the old japanese imperial ambience created for this opera.

Tim Mead, in the role of the King Admeto sounds great and sad in the begin of the opera because of his fatal illness, but shines of Joy in the aria Cangi&oacute; d`aspetto il crudo fato, that in my opinion is the best happy aria from an opera by H&auml;ndel. Mead dances and waves his arm of rejoice. It`s a great view!

Lady Arnet, in the role of Alceste seems a real Queen. Her best aria is, in my opinion Quanto godr&aacute;, allor che mi vedr&aacute; that would make any man fall in love if a woman sang it to him. Besides she is a very beautiful woman.

Lady Blaise, in the role of Antigona sounds wonderful, too and would break your heart to see her sing.

William Berger as Ercole plays in a heroic way. His costume like a Sumo Warrior seems to me creative and funny at the same time, but without to lose his heroic role.

David Bates sounds great in the role of Trasimede and sings with many feelings the aria Da te piu tosto, partir vogl`io, the most romantic aria of this opera in my opinion. Almost that made me to weep. It`s full of tenderness.

Mr. Radley, in the role of Orindo is very tender and funny in the aria Bella, non t` adirar. It`s funny but full of sincere feelings for a woman. Mr Friedrich is also very protector and faithful as Meraspe.

I recommend this DVD SET. If you want to experience romantic feelings with your wife or girl friend, buy it! I made it!",1283731200,7,1614,4.324503311258278
8394350,5,B003COG18G,"I'm just an amateur audience.  I very much enjoyed this production.

I have quite a few of these Handel operas.  It does seem to me that this opera needs the kind of treatment they gave it.  The music is a bit boring, ; i didn't notice anything remarkable or exciting about Handel's music; sorry.  So they have to load up everything else with color, astonishment, drama, sexiness, beauty, art, unusual art forms, and comedy, which miraculously worked.  They really understand theatre.

It was so kinky that it could never have been done at the Metropolitan Opera, because the Met takes operas seriously, don't they?  This had just the right amount of silliness for a modern audience watching an outmoded 18th century drama. I was amazed that a performance of this high caliber would be found at this Staatsoper.",1281830400,3,811,4.826086956521739
