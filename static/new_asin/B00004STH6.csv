Captain Tylor, a man so complacent he'd give granite a run for his money, has through a unique set of circumstances been given control of the space ship Soyokaze in a time of war. With an enemy that hates him, a crew that hates him, and a command staff that hates him you would come to think his time would be short and you'd be wrong too!  This anime is full of wonderful characters with actual personalities like Lt. Yamamoto who struggles with the notion of telling the higher ups that Tylor is a fake, Lt. Commander Yuriko Star who is irritated by everything Tylor does, Kojiro the ensign with a fear of girls, a nurse who's a spy, a marine in a hockey mask, and best of all Tylor who just wanted a free ride...poor guy. Fans of anime or not you'll love all 26 episodes of a truly great anime with a great ending! 5 stars +! Enjoy!",991872000,,977,4.33879781420765
7921961,5,B00004STH6,"This is one anime series that does not disappoint. Most viewers would probably love this series because it contains all the aspects that one looks for when judging a film. First of all, there is the plot. The main  plot is very easy to understand, and all the pieces of the story fit  together quite nicely. The character developement is by far the best  accomplishment of this series. Aside from the amusing Captain Tylor  himself, all of the other characters are very distinct as well. With  characters like Kajiro, the young pilot with a big ego and a fear of girls,  to characters like Jason, a phsycotic, chainsaw toating marine, Tylor's  crew is the craziest bunch of subordinates in space. The animation is done  fairly well along with the arrangement of the many space battles that take  place throughout the series. Overall, Tylor has something for everyone. A  great buy for anyone who loves clever and creative films.",960940800,,928,4.8164556962025316
