8428407,5,B004FXS6X6,I like Mark's approach to his lessons. I also use the handbook very frequently. So I appreciate the extra effort that Mark goes to in his explanations. I've seen other video series that the speaker flies through the material. Mark speaks at a normal person's speed. I'd recommend this to anyone with a Master's or Journeyman's license looking to round off any week points in their NEC code knowledge.,1343088000,,400,4.811594202898551
