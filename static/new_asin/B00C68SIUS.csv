It gave a good personal experience account of what occurred on the home front and how difficult it was for those left behind.  I especially like that the young girl was portrayed as more mature beyond her years and what she did served to soften the blow to her mother when the father was killed.

The costume changes didn't reflect the reality of 1864-1865 southern life, they were all too clean, and looked fresh off the rack.

girl character who is wise beyond her years. Not until the completion of the story will
you realize just how much so! Everything seems very authentic--clothes, uniforms,

5691207,5,B00C68SIUS,"A great movie for the whole family! The child actor is adorable and adds much to this touching story!
I thought the brief battle scenes enhanced the drama and were very well done, including the well-portrayed
emotion shown when one soldier had to make the choice between safety and his personal devotion to the cause.
His decision proves to have an interesting outcome.

But because this movie basically shows what one woman and her daughter had to go through,
the viewer will get a good, accurate picture of what life  was like for many on the home front--loneliness,
uncertainty, not knowing whom to trust and wondering where your next meal might be coming from.
The mother character also has to make a life-changing choice. This is where the two segments of the story intertwine.

Appreciated, also,was the way faith or the lack thereof is well brought out! And when you see the surprise ending
 you will say, ""Oh, for the faith and wisdom of a child!""

Also, the authentic use of uniforms, other clothing and the setting itself adds much
 to the reality of this fine presentation!",1439683200,2,1084,4.770053475935829

5691218,4,B00C68SIUS,"It's been about a month from when i watched this. But wanted to give it,it's credit. In a nut shell. A southern mother and daughter,are propelled into the middle of Civil War. When there farm.becomes a battlefield .The mother is loyal to the south,but when she finds a wounded yank in her basement. She can't turn him away or kill him. For sake of the story-she slowly falls in love with the man..while trying to hold onto being a devoted wife. Her daughter also warms up too the injured man. If you want a action based Civil War movie don't get this(maybe tops 15 mins of conflict).If you want a heart felt drama. About a lone mother , trying to do whats right,and wondering if her husband will have a farm to come home too. This might be for you. And,although it is not presented as such,there is a ghost element too. Ricci +Civil War back drop+ low price on amz(at time).Made this a good choice and its effort put in made it.

5691225,5,B00C68SIUS,"I really enjoyed this movie.  Christina Ricci & Jason Gedrick worked well together.  Always liked both of them.  The child actor in this movie was amazing as well and so adorable.  The story line was solid & characters well developed.  All in all a great movie, though very sad at times.  The ending really shocked me.  Don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet, so I won't elaborate. Glad I purchased it.  I know I'll watch it again in the future.",1376870400,16,463,4.364705882352941
5691226,3,B00C68SIUS,"A bit strange and melodramatic, it feels like a Hallmark made for TV movie but harsher; yet, I found it watchable and waited to see the outcome of it's characters.

Christina Ricci plays a war weary Southern woman who along with her wise, ever hopeful 7 year old daughter(amazingly well acted by Gabrielle Popa), wait for the uncertain return of their soldier husband and father from the Civil War.  The war is nearing it's end; A Union captain(Gedrick) is wounded and nursed back to life by Ricci's character while his father(Berenger), a general, searches for him.

The war rages around the young woman's home as she struggles to survive against thieves, a near rapist, skirmishes on her front lawn, starvation and the growing fear that her husband's not returning.  She runs out of options and would most likely give up except for the persistent spirit of her daughter.

The staged battle scenes are set-ups to show the horrors that inflict on the common folk stuck in the middle of a nightmare and also, to act as the backdrop for a budding romance as the woman cares for and hides an enemy soldier(also see ""Civil Love"").

These are good actors in a budget, B-type film that really wants to be more than it is.  It had limited filming time, and there is weakness in the script, e.g., they don't develop the romance, it just kind of happens quickly; however, I still appreciate the work they do with what they have.

*SPOILER ALERT*  They put in a good but tragic twist near the end that caught me unawares, but the story ends on a positive note with a hopeful future for mother and daughter.  After so much trauma, I needed that ending. *END ALERT*

PG-13, some blood, lots of threatening situations, but no nudity or language, not for kids.  The extras feature an interview with Tom Berenger.",1375660800,7,1798,4.673015873015873
5691227,2,B00C68SIUS,"Imagine my surprise when out of the blue this movie showed up this weekend at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati without any pre-release fanfare or advertizing. I didn't know much about the movie, but the premise sounded possibly intruiging and the cast gave me some confidence too.

""War Flowers"" (2013 release; 100 min.) brings the story of Sarabeth (played by Christina Ricci) and her young daughter Melody somewhere in the South during the Civil War. As the movie opens, we get thrown right away in the thick of a major battle between North and South. After that, we see Sarabeth and Melody anxiously awaiting news from Sarabeth's husband, who is fighting for the Confederate Army. When finally a letter arrives, it is from Sarabeth's brother, informing her that he has not seen or heard anything about her husband. Meanwhile, we also get to know Louis McIntire (played by Jason Gedrick), an officer in the Union Army, and his dad Gen. McIntire (played by Tom Berenger). Louis has already lost 2 brothers in the war, and his dad, in keeping a promise to his wife/Louis' mother, has decided to send Louis back home to Philadelphia. Louis reluctantly agrees, but at the last minute (just as the train is about to leave), he disobeys his dad and returns to the battlefield, with disastrous results as he gets hurt badly, is left behind for dead and is found by Sarabeth. At this point, we are a good 35-40 min. into the movie. Will Sarabeth's husband return home? What will Sarabeth do with Louis? To tell you more would ruin the plot for you.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, as well intented as the movie seems to be, it was pretty painful to watch, to be honest. The overall feeling I got while watching this in the theatre is that this was some medicore made-for-TV movie, with subpar writing (Gen. McIntire to his son: ""You will live, I command it!""), subpar acting (my oh my, whas has become of Christina Ricci?), and subpar production (in the battle scenes, you see soldiers flying through the air when ""hit"" by a cannon shot, they sure didn't miss their trampoline jump-off!), etc. The acting performances left me most bewildered of all, as surely Ricci and Berenger have talent but it is nowhere to be seen in this movie. Bottom line, in all honesty I simply cannot recommend this movie. Viewer beware.",1373673600,21,2331,4.724815724815725

8577568,5,B00C68SIUS,"Excellent Civil War story with a very surprising twist at the end. The main female character seems meek and genteel, but she is a force with which to be reckoned! And the little 7-year-old girl is really the driving force in the movie, wise way beyond her years. Very entertaining but meaningful film.",1524614400,,301,4.69811320754717

8577577,3,B00C68SIUS,"Good acting from Tom Berenger, Jason Gedrick and Christina Ricci but badly produced and edited and the use of other newbie actors and it shows.. I can give it more stars for the performances. Tom Berenger, who use to be a decent looking guy has really aged in this film, but it works because he's General and Father of a 3 sons with only one left fighting a war. This film could and should have been better. I don't know who was directing, but it almost feels like a first sloppy attempt.",1497744000,4,488,4.315217391304348
