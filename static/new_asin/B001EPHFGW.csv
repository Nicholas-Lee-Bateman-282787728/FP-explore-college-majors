8299260,3,B001EPHFGW,"This video is great if you are going to do an installation exactly like the one in the video or if you want to have slightly more than basic knowledge of duct installation. The video falls short in that it does not cover how to decide what your duct sizes should be and what your options are when selecting your trunk and duct fittings. How exactly are you going to do that without knowing the proper or trade names of the equipment? Are you going to do a RETURN AIR BOX, INSULATED FURNACE BOX,INSULATED FURNACE SUPPORT BOX, or a COLD AIR RETURN BOOT/ SHOE type installation? How do you know which one is best suited for your system? Choosing the wrong design base can lead to mistakes in ordering duct and can greatly increase the cost of your DIY installation.  The other major failing is that the video neglects to mention that to design your system you must have all your units measurements plus the measurements of your fittings before you can come close to getting started. Unfortunately the video also does not deal with the real issue of getting someone to come behind you and do the rest of the install. Depending on your market installers will either refuse to do the work or charge you almost as much as you would have paid them to do the complete install. If your system needs to be inspected small things can cause your system to fail. Because building codes are different from state to state you may run into major problems and that adds more to the cost of the install.  The company that sells this video sells systems and parts but I was unable to get any response from them. That said the video is not bad and worth the $24 but understand you need to know a lot more to be able to install your own systems ductwork and set your unit correctly",1338076800,8,1759,4.409230769230769
8299261,5,B001EPHFGW,I replaced my furnace about 18 months ago. I am a mechanical engineer and wanted the experience of replacing my furnace and A-coil.  I wanted the finished product to look perfect.  This video taught me how to do the ductwork. The professional HVAC person I hired to provide the refrigerant charge was amazed by the high quality of my ductwork.  He asked if I wanted to work as an HVAC installer.,1315008000,6,395,4.535211267605634
8299262,5,B001EPHFGW,"I really liked this CD. To me it was well presented; with actual how to video shots, and not just before and after pictures. One thing a person needs to realize with this CD, is that it uses premade duct. It does not go into manufacturing duct from sheets, nor does it cover specialized duct construction or difficulties. All in all a good CD in my opinion!",1245110400,12,357,4.343283582089552
