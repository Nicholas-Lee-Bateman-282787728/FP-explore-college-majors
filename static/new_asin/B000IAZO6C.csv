8158952,1,B000IAZO6C,"In short, this concept needed a lot of work. Even if they had managed to put it together properly, they would have needed amazing actors to carry it off.",1393977600,,153,4.310344827586207
8158953,1,B000IAZO6C,"After 15 minutes of listening to what sounded like a teenage girl's idea of Marie Antoinette's innermost thoughts while she waited to die (scripted in treacly, rhyming verse!), I threw in the towel.  Glimpses of her putative present day counterpart's mundane activities is not exactly what I'd call a ""parallel life,"" spanning the centuries.

If I were sure that no stars at all would be plugged into Amazon's average, I wouldn't have given it one.",1369440000,2,448,4.96
8158954,1,B000IAZO6C,I hate to say anything negative here but to be fair this needed a lot of work. The idea was promising but the execution fell short.,1347840000,,131,4.076923076923077
8158955,5,B000IAZO6C,"This is a poem, told not in lines of iambic pentameter but instead in frames of a movie.  As with other worthwhile poems, it takes you on a flight of fantasy which should and does proceed without bumps of harsh story pockets.  Understanding the pain of being Marie Antoinette is well beyond my strongest surge of empathy, but coupling her loss with the gain of her modern counterpart takes a step along that pathway.

I was caught up in the film, enough so that I became separated from my situation long enough to feel rewarded.  That was as much as I could have asked.",1165536000,7,569,4.4423076923076925
