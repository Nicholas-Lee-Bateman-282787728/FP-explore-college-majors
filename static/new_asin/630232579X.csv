She truly shines (as does Hackett and Coco) in this Neil Simon work.  It is one of  those movies that if you are channel surfing for something to watch and you  come across it, it will grab you, no matter what scene you're at, and keep  you until the end!

Firstly, it is simply the 'television' square-box version with the tops and bottoms cut off to simulate letterbox. Secondly, it doesn't bother with a disc-menu (my first experience of this ever).

452809,5,630232579X,"I have a special place in my heart for Neil Simon. He always wrote such wonderful, witty, snappy, fast-paced dialogue. Marsha Mason was always a natural at delivering his words to the screen. She was never better than she is in ""Only When I Laugh."" This time around Simon delivered a piece that was more on the dramatic, somber side. His signature one liners are on full display, but the subject matter dealing with alcoholism brings a certain maturity level to his writing. I have always loved the film versions of his plays, but ""Only When I Laugh"" has always stuck in my mind as one of his best...and Marsha Mason delivers an incredibly powerful, tragic yet humorous portrayal to her character Georgia. I find that all the characters have insecurities in their lives and are all frightened of rejection in some form. Each of them have ""crutches"" that help them get through.  James Coco has his eating/weight issues, Joan Hackett has her dependence on make-up and expensive clothes to help her hang onto her youth and aging beauty, Georgia's daughter (played by Kristy McNichol) just wants her mother in her life has a hidden anger towards her mother, Marsha Mason has cigarettes and liquor. All the actors are first-rate with their performances, but Mason steals the show. Every scene she is in, every word she speaks, every movement of her body, every emotion on her face, all feel real. She gives a towering performance that hits all the right notes. She makes you love her one minute and then turns around and makes you hate her and get angry. But she makes sure you never lose empathy with the character. You become her cheerleader, wanting her to succeed with her choices. She falls down quite a bit throughout the film, but always manages to get back up and keep moving forward with her life and her recovery from alcohol dependence. I saw this film in the movie theater with my mother when it first opened in 1981. We both loved it...and now many years later I have viewed the film numerous times and I am always moved. Touched with laughter and tears. How great to revisit a Neil Simon film that is character driven, with smart dialogue and performances of quality. These kind of films are too rare these days. We must cherish them...",1490486400,4,2245,4.6835443037974684

As an adult, I was able to appreciate the alcoholism angle much more, and Marsha Mason just nails it as the post rehab alcoholic trying to survive day to day.  There is not a false note here by her.  I felt she deserved the Oscar that year.  The film makes me miss seeing Kristy McNicol, she was such a natural.

452849,5,630232579X,"I gave this movie a 5 star rating as I am studying clinical counseling psychology and it requires that we analyze a move that deals with substance abuse. However from a life perspective it's extremely accurate in the difficulties that many individuals struggle with when dealing with the most difficult addiction of alcoholism. Carl Jung referred to alcoholism as a stranglehold, which I believe is probably the closest to being able to define the overwhelming struggle that addiction presents itself.

But now, just as Georgia is about to star in a play, Polly decides she's going to move in with her chronic alcoholic mother, but things only continue to go from bad to worse from there on forward.

This comedy/drama flick takes me back to memory lane to when I was 9 years old in the 3rd grade during its theatrical release in the Fall of 1981 when Ronald Reagan was the President and we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1981-1982.",1393977600,,654,4.404958677685951

Only When I Laugh (1981) ** / 4
D: Glenn Jordan
C: Marsha Mason, Kristy McNichol, James Coco, Joan Hackett, David Dukes, Kevin Bacon
P: Adaptation of Neil Simon's play, The Gingerbread Lady, (written by Simon) about a Broadway actress as she struggles to stay sober after a stint in rehab and to repair her fractured relationship with her daughter.

There's no denying that Neil Simon is a gifted writer. This is the man that brought us The Odd Couple & Barefoot in the Park. With Only When I Laugh, Simon seems handicapped by his own success. Instead of giving us a meaningful glimpse into a woman who has to come to terms with her alcoholism and to make amends with her daughter, Simon gives one emotionally implausible scene after another in which the characters sometimes talk about their struggles, they laugh, they cry and then everything is all right again as though nothing happened. Simon dodges the big questions and goes for the easy answers all in an effort to create a feel good dramedy.

Only When I Laugh is partially redeemed by the performances of its lead actors. Mason provides a solid foundation for the film. Hackett takes a character who could have came across as very one dimensional and manages to turn her into a flawed human being who has to reexamine her life. Coco is earnest and appealing, but isn't given much to work with.

However, it's McNichol who really shines. She manages to capture all the angst, all the torment that her character has faced at witnessing her mom become an alcoholic over the years. In one particularly hard hitting scene, McNichol finally confronts her mom. McNichol, who was either 18 or 19 when this was filmed, proves that she is an emotionally rich actress whose range was far beyond her years. A better movie would have been told from McNichol's point of view.

Watching Only When I Laugh, all I could think about was how this could have been a timeless story, an important story, something that could resonate with several different generations, the type of story that needs to be told. All I could think was What If? There's a good film in there somewhere. Too bad the film shoots itself in the foot, because Simon lacked the conviction to follow through with the subject matter at hand. [R] 120 mins.",1389312000,,2360,4.732360097323601
452852,5,630232579X,I've always loved this movie.  Now I can watch it whenever I want.  Christie McNichol has always been a favorite of mine.,1386720000,2,121,4.454545454545454
452863,4,630232579X,"""Only When I Laugh"" which opened in September 1981 was actually a cinematic revision by Neil Simon of his dark tragicomedy ""The Gingerbread Lady"".  Originally it opened on Broadway in December 1970 with a Tony winning performance by Maureen Stapleton, and several years later Elaine Stritch played it to similar acclaim in London.  Simon in reworking his play made the screenplay more upbeat and optimistically hopeful, and tailored the leading role to the talents of his then wife Marsha Mason.

 As the film begins Georgia Hines (Marsha Mason) an actress who also happens to be a recovering alcoholic, has just been released from a rehabilitation center in Long Island.  One of her best friends the wealthy, narcissistic beauty Toby Landau (Joan Hackett) drives Georgia back to her Manhattan apartment.  Georgia's other best friend Jimmy Perrino (James Coco) an aging, struggling actor waits there to welcome her back into the world with a feast of bagels, smoked salmon and diet soda.  Although Georgia is delighted with her reunion with both, and that she is officially ""rehabilitated"", she is shaky and uncertain as she tries to reestablish her life. Her bright teenage daughter Polly (Kristy McNichol) who has been living with her father, Georgia's ex-husband, wants to move in with her.  Georgia although she loves Polly, isn't sure she's up to the responsibility.  To further complicate matters, Georgia's ex-lover writer David Lowe (David Dukes) has written a play about their stormy relationship and asks Georgia to portray herself in a Broadway bound production.  Georgia accepts, but finds juggling motherhood, play rehearsals, and the demands of her friendship with Toby and Jimmy are overwhelming at times, particularly since old romantic feelings are reemerging for David.

In reshaping and adapting his play ""The Gingerbread Lady"" into a screenplay Neil Simon transformed its heroine a small time nightclub singer Evy Meara into the younger stage actress Georgia Hines.  The changes in the character and the play were only for the better, I think having read the play and seen the film.  Georgia is not as world weary and self-destructive as Evy who also could be classified as a potential nymphomaniac, her wit and humor while sharp and self-deprecating is not as bitterly lacerating as Evy's.  Overall, most of the changes are improvements, although there is one archly cute sequence that could make you squirm when two college boys (one is Kevin Bacon in an early role) try to pick up Polly and Georgia and believe that Georgia is a college student.

Marsha Mason had played several roles written for her by husband Neil Simon, ""Chapter Two"", ""The Goodbye Girl"", ""Max Dugan Returns"", but this was her richest, most heartfelt performance.  She doesn't shrink from Georgia's less attractive qualities, warts and all are revealed, at times her selfish behavior may be off putting to the viewer, but she still makes you care for her.  Mason has a way with the Simon one-liners; she brings out Georgia's humor that remains with her even in her blackest moments and sustains her.  At the end, she has class and gallantry as she finally takes a very hard, but positive step in her life.  She earns and deserves her Best Actress Oscar nomination, and probably should have won over Katharine Hepburn in ""On Golden Pond"".  Her co-stars Joan Hackett and James Coco both received Oscar nominations as well in the supporting categories.  Hackett is especially good as Toby Landau, the trophy wife who has always gotten by on her good looks, but has very little to fall back upon as she reaches forty and desperately tries to stop the march of time.  The final scene between Georgia and Toby on Toby's balcony is particularly fine, where Toby reads the riot act to Georgia while admitting the truth about herself.  Coco's Jimmy Perrino is wryly comic as the middle aged actor who is getting nowhere, but yet can't move on to something else.  Georgia, Toby, and Jimmy are three incomplete flawed individuals who are all in their own way dependent on one another to make each other whole and survive in a cold world. Both Toby and Jimmy are both enablers of Georgia's bad behavior, and although Toby finally comes to the realization and puts a stop to it, Jimmy is still continuing at the film's conclusion.  Kristy McNichol as Polly gives what is probably her best performance in her limited career, a caring daughter who finally is wearied of playing the parent to an irresponsible mother, yet can't help loving her.

Since I grew up on Long Island, and worked in and knew New York City quite well I'm partial to films that are shot in and around Manhattan, and this one doesn't disappoint.  Although most of the movie was shot in the studio in Hollywood, there are snapshots of the Upper West Side, the Theatre District, and the East Side of New York City circa 1980.  I particularly liked the final scene set in the now sadly defunct NY landmark the restaurant ""Tavern on the Green"", when the camera pans back and we have a view of the Central Park foliage in its entire golden autumnal splendor.

This is one of those forgotten films that are worth a second look and reevaluation, and considering some of the trash that is brought out on DVD/Blueray, absolutely deserves to be brought out in the same formats, ideally with a commentary by Marsha Mason and Kristy McNichol since sadly Joan Hackett and James Coco are long gone.",1372550400,5,5434,4.908196721311476

One small quibble that I have always had with the script is that Georgia never goes to an A.A. meeting when she gets out of rehab, which I only realized years later from seeing loved ones is a necessary part of staying sober (not everything in movies can be entirely reality based).

Marsha Mason shines as the actress who struggles with alcohol dependency and sabotages her long-awaited reunion with her teenage daughter (played by Kristy McNichol) by relapsing in a very public, humiliating way.

Warmth and humor are the constants in what could otherwise be a very depressing film.  But Marsha Mason and Kristy McNichol can be counted on to bring us these elements.

Once again, Ms. Mason outdoes herself in this ""dramedy"" about sordid lives, real addictions and mother-daughter dilemmas handled with craft and skill by Neil Simon.  Not only does she deliver the goods here, Mason is supported by some real pros including James Coco and Joan Hackett as friends who adore Georgia but have their own hang-ups & dramas to deal with.  I feel Kristy McNichol is a bit miscast in this film as Georgia's confused teenage daughter, but does her best with the material at hand.  ONLY WHEN I LAUGH is pure entertainment filled with some biting dialogue and dramatic touches bringing it to a nice simmer.  At the height of her career, Ms. Mason's stunning performance as a formerly overweight, down-on-her-luck stage actress with an unquenchable thirst proves she's go what it takes to make you laugh, cry and relate to her character on many levels.

452899,4,630232579X,"Another classic Neil Simon-Marsha Mason collaboration (when they were married), ""Only When I Laugh"" is aptly-titled: as Mason's character explains, she laughs only when her heart is pierced. In her case here, that happens a lot and is masterfully crafted by Simon's bittersweet perspective of his lead character's life, and Mason's flawless delivery. Her character is a recovering alcoholic, and it is her rocky road to recovery that is the benchmark of this film. On the surface, it's much too easy to assess the film as a story about alcoholism. Actually, it's about recovery. And, as most recovering addicts do (God bless 'em), Mason's character finds that life even without chemicals isn't always a bed of roses. As Mason's daughter, Kristy McNichol is the poster child for Al-Anon, and she is awesome as the child of a recovering addict. Sadly, the two strongest supporting performers aren't with us anymore, but Joan Hackett and James Coca are truly magnificent as the friends who carry Mason through the harshness of recovery and, all too commonly, her ""slip."" It's a timeless message about recovery, and it's a jewel made all the more remarkable by Simon's obvious knowledge about his subject.",1037145600,27,1201,5.101522842639594
452900,5,630232579X,"This is a terrific movie. Marsha Mason is wonderfully funny and touching as ""Georgia"", the recently re-habbed actress. Written by her then husband, Neil Simon, and taken from his original stage play, ""The Gingerbread Lady"", it is full of witty New York theater repartee, as only Simon could write, incomprabley delivered by Marsha Mason. It starts with ""Georgia's"" somewhat premature (fresh out of rehab) re-immersion into the world of theater via the starring role in a somewhat biographical play, written by her former lover , with whom she had the turbulent relationship that preceded her breakdown. Through the emotion of that experience, and her relapse, she is accompanied by her two best friends, also wonderfully played by James Coco and Joan Hackett. Their 3 way friendship would be called co-dependent nowadays, then...it was just being a supportive good friend. (I think we were better off without the present definition.) You will want these kooky, dear, flawed people as your friends. Kristy McNichol projects just the right quality as the on-the-ball off-spring. Georgias attempts to re-establish a relationship and trust with her previously somewhat ignored daughter are very funny and very touching, with McNichol often ending up as the parental figure. This is just a wonderful, under-rated little gem of a movie, a sweet story in which Marsha Mason gives one of the best performances I've seen. I consider her a terrific actress, and it's a shame that, for whatever reason, she is not creating more wonderful roles. She takes a good story and makes it great. A lovely, funny film about friendship, human frailties, perseverence, and the resilience of the human spirit. LOVE it !",1026172800,37,1696,5.170909090909091

7824255,5,630232579X,"Kristy McNichol, the most versatile & multi-talented actress, costars with the magnificent Marsha Mason in this tender, funny & tear jerking drama.  The late Joan Hackett (from the suspense thriller Five Desperate Woman) seasons this drama with gut popping humor.  Kristy first garnered attention from her three After School Specials in the 1970's continuing to stretch into all facets of entertainment like recording a disco/pop LP with her brother Jimmy as well as a the shocking TV drama Blinded By The Light about dangerous cults which was way ahead of its time for content.  One of her latest films is the cult horror classic The Forgotten One (with Terry O'Quinn from The X-Files, Harsh Realm & Millenium Series) proving she can excel in all genres.  Since Kristy's departure from acting in the early 90's this film is now a cherish gem for Kristy McNichol fans!",1502236800,,868,4.9655172413793105
