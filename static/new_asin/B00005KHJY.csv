1620025,5,B00005KHJY,"This is fascinating, harrowing stuff -- I remain haunted by these men, these door-to-door Bible salesmen, peddling their wares, themselves, their humanity.  It's after ""Death of a Salesman,"" but plenty of Willy Loman stuff going on here, and obviously a wellspring of material for David Mamet, for Barry Levinson's ""Tin Men,"" for so many other tales of salesmen.
This is written pre-release, but I'm sure that the folks at Criterion will do an extraordinary job with this.",991872000,20,472,5.12987012987013

1620047,4,B00005KHJY,"Having worked in sales for a short period of time, I can understand the frustration that many salesmen go through. There are many moments in this film that highlight these challenges, including when you hear no multiple times from a customer. ""Salesman"" has moments of comic humor, moments of sadness, and moments that capture the reality of the profession. The movie is difficult to follow though because the audio isn't very good, it was hard to hear the subjects from time to time.",1435881600,,484,4.843373493975903
1620048,5,B00005KHJY,"I'd always wanted to see this Maysles Brothers masterpiece, especially after I'd learned the last part was filmed in Opa-Locka, Florida, where I lived from 1959-64 before going off to college. (Loyola in New Orleans.)  I finally got the chance last year when the film appeared on one of the premium cable stations. It was every bit as good as advertised.

The opening scene grabs you as salesman Paul Brennan - the 'Irish star' - opens his hyper-elaborate $49.95 Bible (laden with images) to a prospective buyer. Brennan uses a lot of schmaltz and small talk as his comrades do as well, who go by assorted nicknames, including ""the Bull"" and ""the rabbit"". (Brennan is ""the Badger""). No one seems to realize that the price of $49.95, in today's dollars and adjusting for inflation,  would be $200.(The dollar was worth four times more in 1968-69). Now, I ask, who today would be prepared to shell out two hundred bucks for a bible?

Yet the Mid-American Bible Company - for which the four featured guys worked - seemed convinced Americans at the lower end of the economic totem pole could afford to do it!

The guys are all Boston-based and the early scenes are there. They then attend a sales seminar in Chicago - where they're given a pep talk to be ""about their Father's business"" - before heading down to Opa-Locka, Florida - where things really get interesting.

In one of the early scenes, we behold Paul, aka ""the badger"",  somehow driving around lost seeing streets like Ali Baba Avenue, Sheherazad Blvd. and other Arabic names, but looking for 118th St.  The poor guy didn't know, or no one told him, that the Arabic bldgs. and street names were all assigned for Opa-Locka proper, which included City Hall. But greater Opa-Locka had spread out from there to include parts of what was originally called Carol City (now Miami Gardens)  which lay beyond the Palmetto Expressway, north. A pity poor Paul didn't realize - neither did his company - that most middle class homes were in that area and not Opa-Locka proper or central!  He might have had better success.

Meanwhile, we see 'the Rabbit'  seated in a Cuban woman's home and making a pitch to purchase the overpriced Bible,  despite the fact she can barely  understand a word of English. In his Bostonian accent he keeps saying the word ""Od- ah"" (referring the order of a missal for Mass) but the Cuban lady has no idea what the heck he's saying.

Later, we see ""the Bull"" - clearly the top producer of the four, trying to buttonhole a young woman on an Opa -Locka street to buy a Bible. She is emphatic, however, in informing him ""I can't even afford a dollar a month"". In another foray, he drags out a four pound Bible from his car, asking a woman to buy it, and her first question (to his chagrin) is ""What's the cheapest?"" Not the way you want to go!

Their pitch in some cases, going door to door, is really noisome and untruthful. At least two salesmen bark out ""I'm from the Church!"" on reaching the prospective mark's doorstep. Not likely! Once inside,  the sales pitch begins and in most cases it's fairly cringe worthy. (In one instance the salesman suggests to a woman who's short of money that she can ""borrow"" it from friends.)  In Brennan's case one almost feels sorry for him - compared with the others' potential to 'go for the jugular'  and override every hesitation.

The general route for purchase is either C.O.D. , or more often monthly payments of up to $5. Which again, was a lot in those days, and at least Brennan is told by one she ""can't even afford the rent"".  This no doubt leads to his negative (but realistic) conclusion that he sees a lot of ""delinquent accounts ahead"".

Above all, the movie delivers the flavor and atmosphere of the late 1960s,  and big time - from an era where house wives were still largely the norm, even answering the door in curlers and robes, to the gas guzzling cars, and then the scenes at the cheap motel (in Opa-Locka) and the seminars, where just about everyone puffs nonstop. It also affords a remorseless view of the cut throat sales world of the 1960s and the heavy-handed tactics characterizing the time.

If you're looking for a brutally honest film that really portrays the era the way it was, don't miss 'Salesman'. I've already watched it four times - after taping it - and still find new aspects that fascinate. Especially, the scenes in and around Opa-Locka and Paul's long rant to his mates in the motel room about all the ""Muslim names"" in central Opa-Locka and being told to ""jag off to 118the Street"" by one person he asked for directions, when he was actually told ""jog off"".",1418688000,3,4615,4.6068376068376065

1620050,5,B00005KHJY,"I like getting DVD's from Criterion.  I knew about them years ago but they where very expensive.  Their prices are now reasonable enough to buy them.

The features part of the DVD is why l bought this title.

I saw the Documentary years ago and I always wondered what happened to those bible salesmen?

The documentary is the first by the Maysles brothers.  You might remember them for the rock doc Woodstock or others.

The camera follows these four door to door bible salesman on their sales routes.

The documentary captures in vivid detail the bygone era of the door to door salesman.",1408838400,,588,4.640776699029126
1620051,5,B00005KHJY,"Salesman, the first film by the Mayles brothers,  in 1968, created a genre, but their unique style has never, I feel, been surpassed.  The men, Bible Salesmen, are each such unique individals, the wonderful attention to all the details of their jobs, the conditions they had to work in, the very poor customers they had to cajole into buying these huge, utterly useless Bibles, using all sorts of questionable tactics, including the help of the Catholic Church, (I'd love to know what that cost them) and all the mind boggling sales meetings and settings...where they are solemnly told, by the President of the Co. or some such, a Mr. Feldman(?) not sure name, but don't think it's Catholic..that they are doing ""his"" (God's) work...it's just a great, funny, and depressing movie.  so Glad Criterion picked this up. The Special Features are a wonderfful addition to this film.  My only complaint :  It would really benefit from subtitles. The hand recorded sound at the customer's homes is often very hard to understand, as many have heavy accents. I bought it, hoping I could talk some people into watching it...but not many real film fanatics around anymore...(in my life) too bad. it's a movie to share.",1396483200,3,1206,4.892156862745098

1620053,5,B00005KHJY,"After reading about this film for decades, I finally got to see it recently. I wasn't disappointed. It depicts an America 45 years ago that looks very different in some ways, but really isn't. The sadness and absurdity of men wearing themselves out lugging around expensive Bibles trying to sell them to people who can't afford them is obviously experienced by many working people today. I was reminded of Scott Sandage's book ""Born Losers: A History of Failure in America"" as I watched it. There are moments of humor, but mostly one is struck by the images of tired, burned-out people who look older than their years.",1386979200,3,618,4.785046728971962
1620054,5,B00005KHJY,"As shattering and insightful as Arthur Miller's drama,
this film takes you inside the soul of the salesman.  Timeless
masterpiece by the masters of the genre.",1379289600,2,158,5.076923076923077
1620055,5,B00005KHJY,"If you like Errol Morris, or if you've seen Grey Gardens, then you need to see this!  Great flick by some true masters of the documentary genre - must see!",1374537600,,155,4.166666666666667
1620076,4,B00005KHJY,"In 1966, filmmakers Albert Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin hit the road with a group of traveling Bible salesmen. The four salesman went by nicknames that fit their personalities: the Badger, the Bull, the Rabbit, and the Gipper. The film focuses on the Badger - a Boston Irishman whose sales have dried up; gradually, the viewer learns of the Badger's weariness and resignation. The setup may sound unpromising, but the resulting documentary - Salesman -  is an amazing study of quiet desperation.

Directors Maysles and Zwerin present the film in the cinema verite style: that is, they attempt to show the salesman in ""real"" situations. Though the salesman and their prospects knew that they were being filmed, their actions appear to be natural - the viewer sees many behaviors that cast the salesmen in a negative light. The salesmen focus their high-pressure sales efforts on blue-collar customers who can ill afford their expensive ($50) Bibles. The film makes it clear, however, that the salesman are also under enormous pressure by their boorish boss.

At the risk of sounding like a film snob, I think that Salesman's black-and-white colors are stark and beautiful. The images are sharp and black-and-white film also helps create the film's bleak mood. Some of the scenes that were filmed in snow up north are especially memorable. As with many documentaries, the dialogue can be difficult to hear, so I advise turning on the captions.

One of the ""side benefits"" of viewing this film is watching a bygone America. In 1966, so many things were different; seeing this lost time on film provokes many philosophical thoughts.

Salesman is cynical and there are no happy endings, but it's also a brilliant film that will keep coming back to viewers long after they finish watching.",1287187200,8,1783,5.030508474576271
1620077,5,B00005KHJY,"Some will recognize the words in quote marks as Linda's plea to her sons in ""Death of a Salesman"" to have compassion for their father, Willie, whose dream of greatness has been tarnished to the point of incurable, suicidal depression.  Paul Brennan, the main character in this groundbreaking American documentary film about four door-to-door Bible salesmen, has never suffered from Willie's dreams of grandiosity and is only nibbling at the edges of depression at the film's end.  Moreover, the movie documents a period and a practice that, even at the time of the film's release, must have seemed curiously dated.  It may strike some viewers as tedious and irrelevant, yet for those willing to live some of the desperate hours with Paul and his three companions--not simply in the living rooms of potential customers but on the road, in motel rooms, at the rallies--it's a sharply observed little film that delineates its characters with telling precision, producing not merely sympathy but a certain amusement and amazement over our present-day illusions about a supposedly better America in the ""good old days.""  It's still a film that deserves the  viewer's attention: ultimately Paul Brennan provokes not only sympathy but takes on some recognizable features of the man in the mirror.

What's surprising is what the film is not.  Given the merging of big business and religion, the huge corporate industries that run giant pyramid schemes fueled by arena pep rallies centered on corporate heads who act like evangelical stars whiplashing and inspiring the myriad troops to action, the viewer of this film might expect a similar emphasis.  But the film is surprisingly low-key about the religious connections (these guys could be selling encyclopedias or dishware); it doesn't go out of its way to find ""villains"" for the spectator to feel indignation towards; it's not afraid to show us a prosaic world of motel rooms, traveling scenes, sales meetings, futile (some successful) sales pitches--all in black-and-white clarity yet suffused through a continual cloud of smoke from the chain-smoking that becomes a measure of the characters' empty lives  (T. S. Eliot's ""I have measured out my life in coffee spoons"" metamorphosed cinematically from coffee spoons to cigarettes).

It's also significant that these four aren't selling insurance (those insistent salesmen who plagued me from the early '60s into the late '80s because, like the prospective customers in the film, I was fearful of being rude and denying them a visit, until my wife grabbed the phone and mercifully spared all of us the agony).  They're pitching forty-dollar Bibles on a dollar-a-week plan to customers who, we honestly began to believe, can't afford even that small an amount (perhaps their only cigarette money).

The viewer can become engaged by numerous hidden themes in the film--the silent rivalry among the mutually supportive four, the dubious matter of whether the guy who makes the most sales is any more of a ""winner"" than the one who doesn't, the use of the ""church"" (who's exploiting whom?), the attitude toward the product (it would appear to be indifference punctuated by occasional glimmers of their belief in the actual value (""utility,"" Paul calls it) of their Bibles, and last but not least our speculations about the camera's effect on the performances we are witnessing.

On a personal level, I was reminded of my mom trying to put my sister and me through college by going door-to-door selling magazines--during the ""happy days"" of the 1950s.  And I was reminded of the relief I felt when an elderly salesman came to my door in the late '70s selling not insurance policies but music encyclopedias (little did he know that he'd made his sale even before starting his pitch) and, about the same time, a door-to-door shoe salesman (again I was a push-over).  Such moments of sympathy have a double meaning: they reflect our desire to help out the Paul Brennans, and they reflect our gratitude at sensing: there but for the grace of God go I.  Paul is the brightest, the most verbal, the most experienced of the foursome.  ""Be liked, and ye shall never want"" is Willie Loman's motto.  Paul is the most likable--to us--but apparently not to his clients.  He blinks.  As a result, he loses the sale.  In other words, he's begun to show the telling marks of inner stress and strain despite his attempts to bluster his way through the rough periods (he frequently impersonates his customers in private).  I suspect that many of us are too honest for our own good: we blink, too. As we get older, we wise up; we begin to know the score, regardless of what we tell ourselves about the validity, or rightness, of the cause, however small. If you can no longer sell yourself on the illusion, forget about selling the public.

""Death of a Salesman"" gives young people a chance to identify with the ""tell it like it is,"" illusion-hating older son, Biff, who says of his father: ""The man had the wrong dream. He didn't know who he was.""  But it's the neighbor Charlie's eulogy that proves the enduring word for the play--and it serves equally well for this film (as the last shot shows us an anguished, perplexed and disheartened Paul Brennan literally being squeezed out at the margins of the frame). As Arthur Miller's Charlie says in defense of Willy following the bitter words of Biff:  ""For a salesman, there is no rock bottom to the life. He's a man way out there in the blue, riding on a smile and a shoeshine. And when they start not smiling back -- that's an earthquake. And then you get yourself a couple of spots on your hat, and you're finished. Nobody dast blame this man.  A salesman has got to dream, boy.  It comes with the territory.""

If there's a flaw in this film, it's the absence of one.  We can't even blame the realist Paul for having the wrong dream.  There's no outlet for our discomfort.  No clear epiphany and certainly no catharsis.  We simply feel bad for Paul and those we know who are like him.  It's a depressing film that's still worth watching.",1283558400,17,6065,4.874391431353457
1620078,5,B00005KHJY,"I love this movie. First it is a time capsule that really takes me back to when I was a kid in the late 60's. Secondly, I sold insurance door to door for a year and worked other sales jobs and this movie is dead on. The character study is fantastic and I just enjoyed every minute of it. It holds up to any fictional movie. Great stuff.",1255564800,4,336,3.9558823529411766

1620081,5,B00005KHJY,"With grainy photography and no fancy frills, the Maysles brothers present the story of several traveling Bible salesman who target mostly those who cannot afford the $50 price tag for a new Bible.  One man in particular thinks he can sell, sell, sell, if he just works hard enough.  But this just isn't always true, as he discovers to his dismay and disappointment late in the film.  It's too bad he believed the old adage about hard work always bringing rewards and riches.  This is something that viewers would do well to remember.",1221523200,3,533,4.698924731182796
1620082,5,B00005KHJY,"Yessir folks, a fine show, rush out and get your dickbeaters on this'n. For four easy payments of $8.99 this dvd can be added to your collection, via the Amazon credit card. I am seriously considering dropping the loot for it tho, I readily admit. The thing sells itself you know.
 I was thoroughly amused by the plight of these four hapless gents, peddlin' Bibles looked like it had to have been the bombiggity back then!
 The joyful glee these beasts portray as they play their desperate, scheming games, is poetic beauty in its' stark contrast to the ideals admonished within the pages of their merchandise.
 There's ""The Gipper"" who's slicker'n snot on a doorknob. ""The Bull"" is ruthless, and you can probably guess about Jimmy ""The Rabbit"" Baker. Although, they mighta named him ""The Rat"", or ""The Weasel"", just as well, given his features, mannerisms, and slight speech impediment.
 Then there's our hero, Paul ""The Badger"" Brennan, the most desperate, a clearly stressed beast, gone stark raving mad. Cracking under the enormous spiritual torture predicated by life as a salesman. His frail, twisted psyche is complete with a vocal disdain for the ""guineas"" and ""micks"" he solicits. The demons rattling in his soul are given voice through various self-addressed diatribes, countless piss'n'moan sessions with his fellow salesmen, and the absent-minded humming of an old Irish hymn or the ""I wish I was a rich man"" refrain from ""The Fiddler on the Roof"". The Badger pursues the daily grind of his profession with the same tortured despair of an old scabby heroin-addict peddling his flesh for one last fix, in the red-light district.
 We are witness to a few priceless pep talks during team meetings and business award ceremonies, the salesmen are no doubt required to attend, meant to bolster up their spirits and fire up their zeal for the job.
 The Head Honcho is a savage and driven beast, thick of neck and skull, a cro-magnon with a penchant for poker and gin rummy, who is consumed with the desire to meet out heavy-handed discipline on the malcontents among them.
 ""I want to go on record, and I want to tell you all, the next man who get's off base with me, I'm gonna tag him out. The ball game's over."" he tells the boys, who cheer him wildly, in dedicated fear.
 One speaker tells them with righteous conviction, ""There are many people who know the Bible. There are many people who can quote from the Bible. But you are different. You know the business."" He goes on to equate ""Bible-peddling"" to ""The Father's Business"".
Lost souls selling the message FOR lost souls.
 There was the standard reserved jubilation in personal success and the failures of others which you are apt to see in the competitive sales game.
 ""How'd you like the sales meeting, yes men?"" asks the Head Honcho of his subserviants. ""Tahmarrow Fluriduh boys.""
 Too-ah-loo-ah-loo-ah-loo it's off to do some sightseeing with the Badger. A salesman with a hard-on for the job, a beautiful beast indeed. Getting lost in Little Iraq. Ali Babba and the Forty Thieves, Aesop's Fables and other deranged analogies.
 ""Boy, you eat like you're successful."" I laughed 'til I sh** at the scene where the Head Honcho breaks the Bull's brass balls the next morning at breakfast. Just as the Bull is ramming a whopping bite of breaky down his throat, the Honch whallops him on the back, thee ol' ""Atta boy!"" manuever, which in this context meant, ""Who's the bit** now?"" Apparently no love lost there.
 ""99% perspiration..."" Working poor folks over with coniving desperation. Make that about 110% it appears, Badger. 58 alternative rhetorics to combat the grim excuses caused by poverty. The ""Don't have a pot ta poo in, or a winda' ta throw it through, how's I'm gonna buy yer fancy Cath'lic bible, mister?"" type of cop-outs.
 Smelling blood in the water, the Badger romances a homeland girl, flirtacious handshakes prickling the ire of her husband. ""He g'wonna wear that hand out..."" hhhahhuhha A thinly veiled threat to any man who would cross the line with his Betty. A sale made and something about how the Bible's been blessed, ""...'cuz if it's not blessed you won't be gettin' the full benefits out of it."" the Badger lays the Cath'lic smack down on his way out.
 The Badger; chuckling goon, purveyor of doom, litterer of flat tires, homesick, ruthless talking monkey.
 Probably the most disturbing scene is the one where the Badger hustles a poor, nit-witted housewife for her last few shekels. A true-blue whoring shill, a poster-beast for the genre.
 The soul-wrenching agony of a ruptured sale. ""Much easier sellin' to mick Cath'lics.""
 A driven salesman will talk over his marks, cut them off mid-sentence, humiliate them in their own homes. Perhaps more subtle in approach, the cycle continues today. The poor are still targeted and victimized through their own ignorance and the greedy designs of evil beasts.
 The Badger's roadside rant to the Rabbit, ""I might as well be shootin' myself in the sun."" Amen.
 Kept on the dangle. Pressure pulling both ways.
 A skinny man in open rebellion against his ""hooked-on-religion"" wife, puts on a phonograph record containing a freakish, classical rendition of the Beatles ""Yesterday"", turning up the volume in an effort to drown out the unholy desacration happening on his couch. The Bull is closing the deal on this poor bastard's wife. ""F*** the bit**!"" screams the thin man, on the inside, grinning deviously over a smoldering cigarette.
 Returning to their lair that night, clearly rattled, one can sense that the Bull wants Paul to shut his whimpering hole, he is dragging him down.
 Paul needs a spark.
 The Gipper takes him along on the next mission. ""Sometimes it isn't a spark you need, it's an explosion."" more desperate chuckling.
 ""That's Life.""
 ""Join tha Fahss an gitta pinchion."" Paul saws on the collective's last thread of unity and sanity.
 Big ups to Albert and David Maysles, who give us this rich glimpse of Americana, long forgotten, but the spirit of which, still drives the Beast and its' Machine.",1192492800,10,6048,4.886608015640274
1620083,5,B00005KHJY,"I've been in outside sales for 9 years and this is without doubt as accurate as you can get to the pain of sales as we follow these door to door bible salesman.

I also find it interesting how natural directors Albert Maysles, David Maysles, and Charlotte Zwerin made this look, it's as if the cameras are not there at all, the first time i viewed this several years ago I didn't realize it was a documentary at first but a movie.

1620084,5,B00005KHJY,"This film is about the trials and tribulations of four door-to-door Bible salesmen in 1968, on the eve of when their occupation was about to become extinct. Of course, the filmmakers could not know that at the time, but this fact is what adds to the sadness of this film today. The salesmen are four New Englanders named Paul ""The Badger"" Brennan, James ""The Rabbit"" Baker, ""The Bull"" and ""The Gipper"", their nicknames being derived from their individual sales tactics. Despite the holiness of their products, this really is a cutthroat business, as is made evident in some of the sales meetings that are shown. The main character, ""The Badger"", reminds me of Jack Lemmon's character in Glengarry Glen Ross. Life - and his profession - have beaten him down, and none of his sales pitches are working as he talks to one indifferent potential customer after another. These guys are always looking for a new angle to make the sale, but usually just about everything they come up with is not successful. Remember, this was in the days when people were unafraid to open their doors to strangers, and equally unafraid to be rude to them. The film not only makes you feel what these unsuccessful salesmen are feeling, it a time capsule for the end of the '60s, and a portrait of an occupation that doesn't really exist anymore due to telemarketing, Internet sales, two-income families meaning nobody is home during the day, and finally the fact that adult strangers on your doorstep are assumed to be potential criminals.

Paul Brennan really seems to have the saddest story of the four. His sales are dwindling, and he is really too old to start over in another occupation. Paul's sales become so poor that at one point that he is partnered with a more aggressive salesman so Paul can observe his technique in the hope that something will rub off on Paul. This younger, sharper salesman, who obviously has not yet developed a tolerance for human frailty, is constantly snapping at Paul for his poor technique and unenthusiastic delivery. If you're an older person who has ever worked for a younger one, you know what I'm talking about. As sorry as you may feel for him though, when we see Paul using the possibly superstitious beliefs of his customers to get them to buy products they may not be able to afford, you have mixed feelings about the man. Is Paul purely being manipulative, or is he resorting to desperate means to survive? Probably a little bit of both is true. Paul realizes that his time as a salesman is coming to a close, and it's not like he has a big bank account to fall back on. Such career struggles are expected when you are in your 20's, but by the time you are Paul's age you are expecting something more...more job stability, more respect, more financial security.

The film does add some humor throughout the film to keep the viewing experience from being too much like a funeral for both Paul's career and the profession of door-to-door salesman itself. Sometimes the salesmen lighten up and even have some comradery in their conversations. Sometimes there is a funny remark from the ""no sale"" Boston housewives the salesmen encounter, and sometimes there are even funnier remarks from the salesmen as they leave a house where they've been refused. There's also an episode in a hotel pool in the middle of the night that is rather humorous.

I'd say that even though the film has a very dated look to it, you should watch it because what it has to say about the human spirit, aging ungracefully, choosing the wrong career, and then failing at that career is timeless.",1166140800,7,3589,4.702702702702703
1620085,5,B00005KHJY,"I saw this movie a few years ago and need to rent it again soon because I have nothing but fond memories of it.  Anyone who has ever had any dealings at all with a salesman will love it - I promise.  Watch as one salesman asks a woman who can't afford a bible for $50 if she could afford $2.50 a week for twenty weeks.  Watch as he asks her if she thinks her home would be better if she had this bible in her house.  These are the same kind of questions you are asked when looking for a car but the way it is shot in the ""you are almost there"" style makes many of the scenes heartbreakingly real.  There is sadness all around in the faces of the salesman and there potential customers.  One cannot help but feel moved by the plight of the salesman and the customers.  It is amazing how the sales pitches of the salesman have not changed much in the past 40 years!  Anyone who likes Errol Morris or John Cassavettes needs to see this film as soon as possible if not sooner.",1146182400,10,972,4.052356020942408
1620116,5,B00005KHJY,"The price on this is a bit steep, especially since the bonus materials are limited (though enjoyable). Nonetheless, I didn't regret spending the money. The Maysles brothers were such amazing and groundbreaking documentarians that anything of theirs that you can get your hands on is worth it. This film follows four very ordinary bible salesmen in the late 1960's as they ply their trade in the cold and snow of New England and then in the sunshine of Florida. The Maysles' focus in particular on one gentleman who clearly is not cut out for this work and is slowly but surely headed for the scrap pile. Despite the relative mundanity of the events, you find yourself transfixed as these men endure the high-powered mindwashing of their superiors and struggle to survive in a dying industry. Few films have ever so poignantly made the point that, though God may be good box office, no one really seems to give a damn about who buys or sells the tickets to the show.",1136332800,7,965,4.682352941176471

1620118,5,B00005KHJY,"Easily one of the most powerful and effective documentaries ever made, this film follows (fly on the wall style) three Bible salesmen in their efforts to fulfill the American dream. Anyone, it is said, can make it big, if they just work hard and work smart.  Some can.  But there are others who, through no fault of their own, just can't do it.  This film is primarily a portrait of a man who is a hard worker, who is passionate about what he is selling, and nevertheless can't seem to make it happen for himself.  It is heartbreaking to watch him, even on the days he has a few sales and is riding high, because you know it won't last.

It can't last because the main character is unable and unwilling to pull out all the stops.  It becomes clear that in order to succeed in sales -- and I know this from personal experience as an occasional salesman for various goods throughout college -- you have to pull out all the stops.  You can't let a sale go.  Even when it becomes clear that the client cannot afford and doesn't really need the product you are selling -- and what is so heartbreaking in this film are the moments when the lead pushes his product even on such persons, knowingly, but in such despair about his own inability to sell the product that he has lost the conscience that on other occasions lets him know when to stop.

A remarkable film.  Highly recommended.",1118016000,3,1379,4.393700787401575
1620119,5,B00005KHJY,"Perhaps the best (along with ""Don't Look Back""), documentary film of the 1960's.  The Maysles boys coined the term ""direct filmmaking"", and this portrayal could not be more direct in its tone, tenor, and pathos.  The camera captures a group of salesmen who try to convince the working poor to part with thier hard earned cash for a fancy, engraved bible.  If they can't pay for it all at once there is the ""Catholic Honor Plan"".  The camera is as harsh as it is forgiving.  Everyone is a hero in this film, everyone perhaps except the supervising salesman who seems to enjoy humiliating the very men he is suppose to encourage.  A real slice of Americana.  A time gone by.  I can understand D.A. Pennebaker wanting to film Dylan on his 1965 English tour, or Errol Morris doing a story about Randall Dale Adams, but only a genius could think that doing a feature length movie about a bunch of burnt out salesmen could be a worthy experience.  Indeed, filmmaking at its best and most brutal.",1104710400,8,989,4.573863636363637

1620121,5,B00005KHJY,"The Maysles Bros. did a wonderful job with this film. The b/w photography is sharp and smartly orchestrated making _Salesman_ a must see in my book. Shot with a custom made handheld camera and portable boom mic, _Salesman_ is the story of four door-to-door bible salesmen in the late sixties. The film falls in to the documentary category, though the Maysles have coined their own term for their style of filming: direct cinema.
The ""salesmen"" themselves are unforgetable; their performances in the homes of anyone who will let them get a foot in the door are fascinating and nerve wracking as you find yourself sympathizing both with the salesmen and the prospective buyers at the same time. It's this dynamic tension that gives the film some real drama. Better than what could have been scripted.
I never saw this film on video so I can't comment on any improvements in quality. But I will say this: the film looks and sounds beautiful on DVD. Also, with the DVD is an interview (mostly pretentious banter revolving around the distinction of ""direct cinema""), commentary with the Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin (editor) and film trailers.",1018137600,31,1138,4.932291666666667

This is pure Americana--it follows a group of bible salesman starting in Boston and ending in the Miami area.  (You will see how much times have changed by the amount of smoking everyone in this film does from start to finish.)  Although I never liked door to door salesman, you begin to appreciate the frustrations they encounter on a daily basis as well as their devotion to their craft.  I don't think fellows like this exist anymore--they are from a time long gone.  It might be an interesting film for students to watch and see a snapshot of America as seen through the eyes of these salesmen.",1009756800,12,693,4.512
1620123,5,B00005KHJY,"A few months ago I rented the Criterion edition of Gimme Shelter. The DVD included a fascinating preview for another film by the Maysles brothers called SALESMAN. I had never heard of the film but after seeing the preview I had to see it. Much to my dismay SALESMAN was not available, nor does it appear to have ever had an official release on video. Thankfully, Criterion has seen fit to release this long lost American masterpiece. I was completely won over by this tragic but hysterical documentary about door-to-door Bible salesmen. The Maysles brothers focus most of the film on Paul Brennan aka The Badger. Brennan appears to be the the main inspiration for Gil, the unlucky salesman on The Simpsons. Brennan rarely scores a sale and when he doesn't his fellow (and more successful) salesmen have to endure his bizarre Irish rants and mumbled complaints. SALESMAN is full of strange lingo, strong Irish accents, and tons of smoking. I don't smoke but by the end of the film I felt in need of a light. Most of the banter between the Bible sellers and their prospective buyers is very funny. One woman declared that she was the ""literal"" person of the household. Criterion's presentation is excellent. The disc includes an interview with the two brothers by Jack Kroll. Kroll's interviewing skills are terrible at best. More than once he cuts off the two filmmakers to plunge the shallow depths of his scary thoughts. Even worse he goes on to tell them what they mean to say. The commentary track by Albert Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin is interesting and informative. Highly Recommended.",1000512000,53,1591,4.831501831501831
1620124,4,B00005KHJY,"Albert and David Maysles' verite documentary Salesman is one of the most interesting documentaries that I've seen. I definitely prefer it to their Grey Gardens which seemed somewhat exploitative to me. Here, they don't seem to be condescending to their subject (a downtrodden Bible salesman) much. The film feels like a real-life Paper Moon, in that the whole setup feels like a scam. You get the impression that the housewives buy the Bibles that are sold out of a sense of guilt or good manners. Still, it's a very interesting film, and it hasn't dated much at all.",1000339200,6,567,4.795918367346939

7943365,3,B00005KHJY,"""Salesman"" ostensibly is a documentary about the down-in-the-dirt life of four or five men selling outrageously priced bibles in 1967. Dig deeper and it is more about the almost sociopathic quest for gain depicted in movies like ""Boiler Room"". The salesmen in each will say just about anything to close the deal on an obscenely priced bible ($40.00 in 1967 equates to $293 today--about a week's pay for the average family 50 years ago.) Not surprisingly, they attempt to place these ornate bibles in homes by hammering away at people for whom even $1.00 a week ($7.34 today or almost $30.00 a month is an additional expense they can't afford to run their households.)

One salesman, in particular, is constantly astonished that low-income families cannot manage to squeeze the extra dollar out of the family budget.
In one particularly predatory attempt, when every payment option is exhausted, a salesman asks a potential customer if he can borrow the money.

This is a painful documentary to watch because it portrays men--and there are millions out there--hawking overpriced products to the person who cannot afford it but who will eventually cave after failing in a contest of wills.

It does point out the power of the word ""No."" when unambiguously used two, three, or four times when presented with a proposition that does not appeal to one. Even the slickest, most persistent salesperson (or anyone who wants something from you that you do not wish to give) will wilt when the word is said often enough.",1515196800,,1510,4.937007874015748
