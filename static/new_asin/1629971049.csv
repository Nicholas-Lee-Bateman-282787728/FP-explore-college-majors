7800652,5,1629971049,It was a Christmas gift for my husband and he really liked it  Is just about done reading it.,1484611200,,93,3.8947368421052633
7800653,1,1629971049,"I got it on a lightning deal. Glad of that, because it is not worth full price. The instructor likes to use examples, but they are all from the same three or four books. If you have read any other book on writing a novel, you are not going to learn anything new here. And you are not going to get any practical advice. The instructor tells you what you need to do, but not how to do it. For him, the how is locked up in a mysterious cave, that you must discover for yourself.
After I purchased this, The Great Courses became an add-on channel to Amazon Prime. I tried it for two months, taking the photography course for my new camera purchase. The photo course was shot on the same set, as was a philosophy, and a history course. A cooking course was in the kitchen, and the most practical. All of them were little more than college lectures, with very little in presentation material. Dull, lifeless, material presented by experts as dull and lifeless as the material.
Note: Everything in the handbook is in the videos.
Overall Conclusion: The Great Courses are waste of money. You can find more engaging material elsewhere.",1480636800,7,1126,4.470873786407767
