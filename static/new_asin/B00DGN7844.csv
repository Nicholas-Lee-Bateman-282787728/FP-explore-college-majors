8592977,5,B00DGN7844,"Hope's Peak Academy is an elite private school that only accepts the best. Makoto Naegi is one such ""lucky"" guy that is accepted to the school along with fourteen other students. However, he soon realizes that the school's administrator is a sadistic bear called Monobear. The bear declares the students are trapped in the school for all eternity unless they murder a fellow student without getting caught. After every murder will follow a trial. If the true murderer is caught, that person is sentenced to death. If the students fail to pick the true murderer, everybody else besides the true killer, is murdered. The students work hard to get out alive, some give into despair, and others try to uncover the many secrets Monobear is hiding from them.

Danganronpa (the whole anime) was so interesting, creative, exciting, and a bit creepy. I don't think there was ever a dull moment. It's like a murder mystery tugging back and forth between despair and hope. The show pulled me in and kept me guessing what would happen next through the whole anime. The characters had some unique, strange personalities and hairstyles to match too. I would give this unique anime a try.

(I hope Amazon comes out with the DVD version that works on U.S. DVD players soon. Until then it's on HuluPlus.)",1384646400,4,1287,4.819004524886878
