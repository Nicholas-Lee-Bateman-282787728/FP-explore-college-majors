8223414,2,B000WH9BYC,Odd DVD that is very superficial and just strange. I expected a more in depth and fun DVD..BOOOOO - you can do better,1386633600,,117,4.130434782608695
8223415,4,B000WH9BYC,"Excellent video of an amazing ""moto-cultural"" event- U.S. flat track motorcycle racing. A true ""insiders"" look at dirt and clay track racing as generations of Americans have enjoyed.  This DVD offers a good look at how races are run by the sanctioning body, AMA, and how they are won on by riders on single and twin-cylinder bikes. The fierce competiton on the track is balanced by off-track fun with riders, family and friends. This would be a FIVE STAR video if a bit more time had been devoted to the technology of the bikes. Heartily recommended!",1260230400,,550,4.729166666666667
