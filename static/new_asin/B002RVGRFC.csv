8601450,3,B002RVGRFC,"In a nutshell, ""Many Kisses Later"" (its original title ""Ex"") is an Italian version of ""Love Actually."" Starting with sketches of couples passionately in love, a 2009 Italian-French romantic comedy follows loosely interconnected stories of men and women, whose love and marriage are tested for various reasons.

The film is basically a series of intertwined vignettes following people in various social settings and locations, and their romances, misunderstandings, shenanigans and regrets. Eliza (Claudia Gerini) is reunited with her ex-boyfriend after nine years, who has become a priest of her upcoming wedding. A philandering college professor Luca (Silvio Orlando) starts living with his estranged daughters after the death of his ex-wife. Office worker Marc (Malik Zidi) is forced into a long-distance relationship when his girlfriend Giulia (Cristiana Capotondi) gets a new job in New Zealand.

All these episodes (and there is more) are predictable, told with sentimental, but not sappy, overtones. The optimistic film is free from cynicism, often funny with characters finding themselves in silly and embarrassing situations, but they ultimately discover what they want. This is nothing groundbreaking, but still entertaining.",1359676800,,1234,5.774725274725275

8601453,5,B002RVGRFC,"Just saw this movie Saturday night at the Italian film festival. It came out in Feb. 2009 and was nominated for and won several awards. There are numerous interwoven stories, with a talented cast of veteran actors who are perfectly chosen for their parts. Filled with episodes of both roll-on-the-floor hilarity and tears-in-the-eyes poignancy. Best movie of any kind, in any language, that we've seen in the last couple of years. If only it were easier to rent (from Netflix, Blockbuster, etc.) or in general distribution in U.S. theaters! The only way to get a copy that I could find is here on Amazon, at $30+ for Region 2 (Europe) DVD.",1272240000,3,639,4.7657657657657655
