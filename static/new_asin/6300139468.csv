The acting is excellent and there are quite a few humorous set pieces in this story of a woman what lives with two men.",1364083200,,165,4.258064516129032
7802982,4,6300139468,"George Lautner's French film ""My Other Husband"" (original title ""Attention, une femme peut en cacher une autre"") hits a comedic bull's eye. This French style charming comedy depicts a spirited nurse (a surgeon's assistant in Paris, nicely played by Miou-Miou) who leads two lives. One is with her significant other in the countryside of Normandy, and the other is with her estranged husband in Paris.  In Paris, the nurse, surgeon, husband and child all lead the life of sophisticates. Alice, the nurse, has been traveling to Normandy, where for four days every week she works at a salt water cure, and shares her life with Vincent, a teacher, and his two children.  After a decade of separation, she is by chance reunited in Paris with her husband, Philippe, and her 10 year old son, Simon. She then carries on a double life since she has not divorced the husband and thus is not free to marry Vincent. The two ""husbands"" and families do not know of each other until a chance meeting, which provokes periods of much rivalry, jealousy, hurt and laughter. The French public's longstanding desire to lead two different lives, one Parisian and one provincial, is well displayed and satirized in this comedy. Lautner's film is hilarilously funny and would be enjoyed by everyone interested in different cultures and countries, plus nurses, of course. This 1986 film is rated PG-13, but has a fun French sexiness throughout.",1018828800,8,1419,4.933054393305439
