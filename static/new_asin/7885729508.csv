7900470,5,7885729508,"Queen Christina opposes her advisors, who relish war and want to choose her husband. She flees the royal life, is mistaken as a man and falls in love with a fellow traveller. Conflict ensues when she returns to the palace. [Because Garbos persona in real life exhibited both masculine and feminine characteristics, this mistaken perception was believable.] I appreciate Greta Garbo in her silent films, and in those films she is marvelous. Queen Christina is considered by many to be her best film. In her talking pictures Garbos voice is low, and she speaks with an accent. Her acting is also, at times, stiff and unnatural. She has, though, some very powerful moments as an actress in this film. The film is very good, Garbo is beautiful and spellbinding, and one who appreciates film should see it. View, as well, Garbo at her best in such films as Romance, Susan Lenox, and Grand Hotel.",1467849600,,890,4.785714285714286
