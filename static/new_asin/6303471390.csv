665297,5,6303471390,"This film is really suspenseful. Its title becomes clear only at the end of the film. it concerns Angie Dickinson who is an oversexed nymphomaniac who we see at the onset of the film showering, playing with herself, and having an orgasm. It is pure pornography. We see everything. Then she has sex with her husband who does what he does and gets up leaving her unsatisfied, although during the short-time sex, she enjoyed it immensely. She then goes to a museum and picks up a man, goes to his apartment and has very enjoyable sex, and even leaves him a note saying this. She is treated by a psychiatrist. Michael Cane, and had propositioned him before going to the museum. Cane turned her down saying that he recognizes that she is beautiful and very attractive, but he is married and does not want to destroy his marriage.
When Angie leaves the apartment of the man she picked up, she is murdered by a woman who later leaves a message on Caine's machine saying she is angry at him because he is against her sex change. She also says that she took his razor blade. It is this razor blade that is used to kill Angie.
A prostitute sees the murder happen and is later pursued by the woman. The prostitute, Angies son, a police officer, and Caine try to discover what exactly happened, who is the woman who killed Angie, and why. Brian De Palma wrote and directed the film and did a great job in doing so. It is very exciting.",1508112000,,1423,4.414448669201521

I have a Samsung Upscaling 4K player and it literally upscales ALL Blurays and some DVDs to 2160.
I have always liked this movie along with ""BLOW OUT"", another DePalma movie starring the incredible Nancy Allen. You don't get to see her nude in that one like DRESSED TO KILL, though! There are scenes in this UNRATED edition I have never seen before and it was fabulous to see it all the way through.

A knockoff of ""Psycho"" and/or ""Vertigo""?  Not exactly.  I would say more of an homage to Hitch.  Listen for the lines from his films in this one.  This film uses much of De Palma's standard camera work to enhance the shock value.  Thriller, Suspense, Psychological, Scary - all describe the content of this one.

665669,4,6303471390,"While the climactic summary scene inside of the police station is so obviously lifted from the ending of Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" that it makes a film aesthete wonder aloud ""seriously?"", the beginning scenes and the characterizations are intriguing enough and even somewhat original in their framing that it is possible to give De Palma a fair hearing for this one I think. Be warned that the Blu Ray is the ""Unrated"" cut, which means that all of the filth that had been included in De Palma's original dialogue is now restored in this print--if you watch ""Pulp Fiction"" a lot, you won't even notice it, but some of the language is still pretty strong even for today. I did enjoy Angie Dickinson's performance (and yes, they used a double for those opening shots in the shower!), and while she is obviously a Marion Crane-type of character device used for the plotting, she adds a layer of subtlety to her performance that is actually quite good. And Michael Caine has finally met a director who understands how to use him properly on camera--in the past, I've always found Caine to be an annoying presence whenever he tries to carry the entire film himself, but in ""Dressed to Kill"" his performance is more mannerism than talk, and he delivers a far more subdued level of skill than I recall seeing from him before. Nancy Allen, though, proves to be the real knockout here (check out that black lingerie!), and her acting shows considerable strengths (even though De Palma had personal reasons for being skeptical of her casting). The quality of the Blu Ray presentation is detailed by other reviewers on here, so I will only add that the picture and sound are quite astonishing considering the age of this negative, with the sound coming through as being particularly lush. ""Dressed to Kill"" may not be the paradigm of screen originality (even its title is overly used!), but for suspense fans and fans of Brian De Palma, it is difficult to overlook even so. While ""Blow Out"" may be De Palma's major classic (John Lithgow made an even more intimidating villain figure in that one), ""Dressed to Kill"" is exciting in a visual way, with a camera that is ever seeking but never coming to the full knowledge of the narrative, with a deceptively perverted but still enjoyable aesthetic concerning the women in danger genre (that is still thought by many to be so disreputable). Feminists really hated men again after this one came out (the liberal press darling Harlan Ellison acted particularly babyish when writing his put-down about this fantasy-like film), but today De Palma's shocker looks almost classy in comparison to other horror films, and a lot more polished than it needed to be.
Extras here are quite good for a film that may be more inconsequential to historical appreciation than most film collectors realize. The ""Slashing Dressed to Kill"" extra goes in depth about the conception, casting, producing, and marketing of the eventual film. Dickinson and Allen are both interviewed here extensively, as is De Palma, and he goes on to discuss his ongoing battle with the censorship board about the extreme content in his films. The theatrical trailer is good, and it is included here. The neatest, if not the most enjoyable, extra is the one that compares the TV cuts and the original R-rated submission footage to that of the newly remastered, unrated cut. You can really get an education in how timid--but sometimes also how right--that the ratings board is in choosing which little bits get cut out of our entertainment movies. I wonder if Pauline Kael got to see the original version or a watered down R-rated print? In any case, the extra punch added to the dialogue makes it all the more sinister for the not-all-that-shocking conclusion (although I believe that ""Dressed to Kill"" was considered pretty frightening in its day). If the ending offends you--and maybe you didn't like ""Carrie all that much--just know that De Palma uses film as a kind of wavering light that never really achieves separation between dreams and reality (and to me, it's not always a ""cop out"" to use such techniques as long as the movie is not a complete waste of time in itself). While this film does not reach the hysterical heights of satire that pushed both ""Sisters"" and ""Scarface"" into the five-star region for me personally, it is nonetheless an enjoyable--if pretty light--suspense genre entry.
A word must also be added about Pino Donaggio's beautiful music score, which is really what makes the Blu Ray transfer worth owning. This title is also available on DVD in the exact same special edition (and with the same content) as the new Blu Ray--I suppose I'm wondering why these weren't included in a combo pack for fans but, ah, the mysteries of the universe...",1428624000,,4760,4.8417177914110425

one of my favourite Brian De Palma films
much better than the old DVD release
the picture quality has been given a new HD master transfer which looks amazing, much better than the DVD release
and the Audio has been boosted up aswell, the cover art is better than the old MGM release aswell.
MGM did a fantastic Job to give this classic thriller the respect it deserves on blu-ray

special features
all the extras from the old MGM dvd release are on this blu-ray
the making of Documentary and all the featurettes are on this blu-ray
unfortunately there is no new exclusive extras at all
just the old extras from the special edition dvd release
only one thing is not on this blu-ray version, the Theatrical version
MGM decided just to release the UNRATED version on this blu-ray
which is fine with me the UNRATED version is much better than the Theatrical version
more violence,swearing and sex in the UNRATED cut
the old dvd release had both versions
so the UNRATED version is what Brian De palma wanted to release back in 1980 anyway.
this is his prefered version
so this UNRATED version gets the HD treatment actually which is beautiful.

so for all fans of this film, sell the old MGM dvd release and get this all new blu-ray release
it is Definitely time for an upgrade for sure

I remember watching this movie many times on cable TV in the earlys eighties.  It stars Angie Dickinson and Michael Caine.  This is a good thriller directed by Brian De Palma.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat much of the time.  The movie is brutal and suspenseful.  De Palma is a huge Hitchcock fan, and if you watch this movie you'll definitely see a huge Hitchcockian influence in many scenes, as you will in many of De Palma's other movies.  I don't want to give away what those scenes are, you'll have to watch to find out.

The musical score by Pino Donaggio is good.  De Palma used him in Carrie (1976) as well.

If you want to see a good thriller, then I do recommend Dressed To Kill.",1383868800,,804,4.293333333333333

While taking a shower, Kate Miller, a middle-aged, sexually frustrated New York housewife, has a rape fantasy while her husband stands at the sink shaving. Later that day, after complaining to her psychiatrist Dr. Robert Elliott about her husband's pathetic performance in bed, she meets a strange man at a museum and returns to his apartment where they continue an adulterous encounter that began in the taxicab. Before she leaves his apartment, she finds papers which certify that the man has a venereal disease. Panicked, Kate rushes into the elevator, but has to return to his apartment when she realizes she's forgotten her wedding ring. When the elevator doors open, she's brutally slashed to death by a tall blonde woman wearing dark glasses. Liz Blake, a high-priced call girl, is the only witness to the murder and she becomes the prime suspect and the murderess's next target. Liz is rescued from being killed by Kate's son Peter, who enlists the help of Liz to catch his mother's killer.

666093,4,6303471390,"Many years since I last saw this film!  I had forgotten how well De Palma handled suspense.  Was less impressed by Michael Caine than I was by Nancy Allen, who at the time was outstanding at playing ""one of the boys"" who nevertheless retained her femininity.  Keith Gordon also played well.  The real surprise was Angie Dickinson who was acting without dialogue for an extended period and did a great job.  Typical of the period in which all violence (and virtually all relationships) is sexual, it is still a strong tale well told, even if we're a little more evolved now when it comes to sexual identity.  If you like Hitchcockian suspense or stylized 70's/80's violence De Palma proved his mastery with this film.  The only reason I don't go five stars is that characters of the era were frequently characterizations.  Today's filmmakers do better at making ordinary people more, well, ordinary.  Case in point is Dennis Franz, who is a fine actor, but in those days cop roles were always trying to out Popeye Hackman.  All cops have to be rugged individualist authoritarians who reject authority, all hookers are smarter than the johns and have a heart of gold, and all psychiatrists have a smug superiority.  (Wait, that last one is true.)  A little better writing the characters and De Palma would have an all time classic rather than a merely excellent film.",1373760000,,1365,4.786324786324786

666207,4,6303471390,"Ah, Brian De Palma..
The director of such classics as 'Sisters' and 'Carrie' delves into 'Psycho' territory with 'Dressed To Kill'. Yes, it's no secret that Brian De Palma's films have been hugely influenced by Hitchcock. But in an age where most filmmakers are inspired by others why not celebrate this as something of a tribute. Like the saying goes: Imitation is the highest form of flattery.

Angie Dickinson plays Kate, a bored middle aged housewife who spends her days fantasizing about strange men ravishing her in the shower and spilling her guts to her therapist Dr. Elliot played by Michael Caine. In her sessions she talks about how her husband isn't tending to her needs sexually. Her son Peter seems to be the only person who doesn't make her life miserable but is too busy with his mathematical machines to even notice anything. This all changes when Kate shares a connection with a stranger in a Museum. The two of them play this kind of cat and mouse where she chases him and he chases her. They eventually end up outside the Museum where the strange man coaxes her into a taxi and the two of them ride off to his apartment for a sexual affair. Afterwards Kate awakes only to find evidence that the man she has slept with may have sexually transmitted disease. Kate scrambles quickly out the apartment horrified and ashamed. She reaches the elevator and is suddenly greeted by a woman who slices her to death with a razor. Witnessing the crime is a hooker named Liz, played by Nancy Allen, who then teams up with Kate's son to track down the deranged killer.

The film is a very exciting thriller. Brian De Palma once again showcases his great use of camerawork as well as a story with enough sex and violence to keep anyone happy. This MGM Blu Ray release treats the film very well, keeping the aesthetic of it's age and letting the screen pop with color. The special features on the disc are also enough to satisfy any fan of De Palma including a making-of as well as a couple of featurettes. In all if you're a fan of the film, the director, or new to the film all together this is one Blu Ray that doesn't disappoint.",1363219200,,2137,4.533678756476684

666303,1,6303471390,"There is nothing I hate more than a review on Amazon that does not, in fact, review the film, but rather, gives a film a one star rating for something outside the film/filmmaker's control. This is one of those reviews.

Dressed to kill was originally shot on Panavision anamorphic lenses. The original aspect ratio is 2.39:1. This aspect ratio is listed in the description for the DVD and BluRay, leading me to believe the Amazon Instant ratio would be the same, considering there is no aspect ratio descriptor anywhere on Instant. So I bought it, started streaming, and found the old VHS pan-and-scan 4:3 version staring me in the face. More than 2/3 of the picture had been cut away without warning.

So, I requested a refund. The Amazon worker I chatted with was very helpful and polite. However, he/she did inform me that this would be a one-time thing, as refunds are not normally given for digital copies. Considering the aspect ratio is completely different from what's listed on Amazon, I think this is really lame.

I then asked if there was a place where I could submit a complaint about Amazon's policy regarding aspect ratio and charging for movies that are not properly labeled (which I consider just this side of defrauding). I was told to leave a review on the movie, which is what I'm doing now.

For years, I've been angry with people who leave one-star reviews for DVDs because a feature is missing, or the quality is bad, or Amazon didn't deliver on time, because this brought down the rating of an otherwise fine film. Now I know: this is the only way to let anyone know. You can't complain to Amazon, you can't just put up a warning that, ""HEY! This is a DIFFERENT VERSION and contains DIFFERENT STUFF!""

It would be really nice if, when reading a review on Amazon, I could actually read a review of what I'm purchasing, not a review of a release copy from 18 years ago. It would also be nice if all of the pertinent information for a release was actually reported on the release, because if I purchase something expecting one thing (that is clearly written in the description) and get another, I would like to not be charged for it.

That being said, I like Amazon. I just wish they'd fix their effed up review system and release version descriptors.

So, Amazon, this rating of 1 star is for your release of Dressed to Kill on Instant at an incorrect aspect ratio. I'm also giving 1 star to your crappy review system.

And yet, Dressed to Kill, the film, will take the hit. Too bad, it's an all right movie. At least three stars, I would think.",1347753600,18,2567,4.541125541125541

666307,3,6303471390,"When I first saw ""Dressed to Kill"" during its initial theatrical release, I loved it. Upon viewing the film on blue-ray disc my opinion has changed. For one thing, some the acting is laughably bad, particularly by Nancy Allen and Dennis Franz. It's most apparent in the scene in the police station when Franz interrogates Allen and Michael Caine. The poorly written dialogue is partly to blame. It made me actually cringe a few times. Another problem with the film is the long drawn out ending. DePalma tries to redo the shock ending he used in ""Carrie"" but this time he fails miserably. The slow motion becomes tedious and and goes on and on and on. What starts out as tension-filled soon turns to boring as we think when will this get over already? The similarities to ""Psycho"" are very apparent to the point of imbarrasing. I'll list some of them at the end of the review so the full review can be read before reading any spoiler alerts. The good points of ""Dressed to Kill"" are Angie Dickinson and Michael Caine. In spite of the aforementioned poorly written script, they both make the best of it. Also, there is a modicum of suspense, especially in the art museum scene and the series of annoying problems that confront Dickinson's character after that (medical discovery, the wedding ring). Overall, the film is watchable, but don't expect Hitchcock. Similarities to ""Psycho"": *SPOILER ALERT* 1.) The star is a blond woman who gets killed halfway into the film.(Dickinson, Janet Leigh); 2.) The victim has a relative who gets involved.(DTK-mother/son, Psycho-sisters). 3.) The murder takes place in a no-escape location.(DTK-elevator, Psycho-shower). 4.) The murderer is a man who dresses in a woman's clothes. 5.)Two unrelated people meet because of the murder, the man saves the woman from the murderer, and they end up together.(Nancy Allen/Keith Gordon, Vera Miles/John Gavin). 6.) The victim is involved in shady behavior that is not related to the murder.(DTK-adultery, Psycho-stealing). 7.) The victim and the murderer had established a trusting relationship beforehand.(DTK-Pshchiatrist/patient,Psycho-motel proprieter/customer sharing dinner,chat). 8.)

666422,4,6303471390,"This 1980 erotic crime thriller horror flick written and directed by master of the macabre(Brian DePalma)centers on the murder of a sexually frustrated housewife Kate Miller(Angie Dickenson)and a homicide investigation witnessed by a young prostitute Liz Blake(Nancy Allen), and Kate's orphaned teenaged electronic son Peter Miller(Keith Gordon)who eventually joins forces with Liz to find the killer Dr. Robert Elliott(Michael Caine)after the bitter New York police Det. Marino(Dennis Franz)is quite skeptical about Liz's side of the story until Dr. Elliott is finally caught in the act for attempted murder at the conclusion of this movie as his transvestite character(Bobbi)and then put in a nut-house with psychatrist Dr. Levy(David Margulies)explaining how Dr. Elliott wanted to be a woman, but that his male side wouldn't allow him to go through with a sex-change.

DRESSED TO KILL is also a tad similar to De Palma's 1976 thriller CARRIE at the beginning & the end of this horror film since DRESSED TO KILL had a lot of graphic nudity by starting out deliciously nasty at the very beginning with Angie Dickenson showering in full-frontal nudity like a bitch-in-heat just like CARRIE starts out with an opening sequence of a bunch of sexy naked teenage girls in a high school lockerroom showing off their Womanhood from head to toe, especially Nancy Allen who also co-starred in that movie as the unruly popular bitch(Christine Hargenson)whom was also married to Brian De Palma from 1979-84.

DRESSED TO KILL also has a shocking heart-stopping moment at the very end like CARRIE does when Liz wakes up from a nightmare about Dr. Elliott escaping from the asylum and stalks her to her house in a bloody act of vengence while showering nude & defenseless before she wakes up screaming, realizing that it was just a bad dream as Peter runs to her bed to comfort her kind of like Carrie White(Sissy Spacek)reaches out from her bloody grave and snatches Sue Snell(Amy Irving) when she goes to visit her grave just before she wakes up frantic & crying as Mrs. Snell (Priscilla Pointer)comes to console her.",1321315200,,2106,5.101449275362318

The picture quality is excellent! No noise or scratches, particularly during the dark scenes, and the image quality is razor sharp even in the dream sequences and foggy shower scenes.

And the movie still holds up after all these years. It's still a fascinating thriller and I'm always finding new images and hints throughout the movie on repeated viewings, especially on this new Blu-Ray transfer, that I didn't notice on the DVD. Did you know that Bobbi makes an appearance long before the elevator scene?

Anyway, if you're undecided on whether or not the BR version of DRESSED TO KILL is worth it, I'd say yes with a few caveats.

First off, all of the special features that were on the DVD were carried over to the BR except for the ""Advertising Photo Gallery"" that showed film posters and lobby cards. I don't know why they got rid of this featurette because I really enjoy looking at the various film posters and concept art for them.

Also, the mini-pamphlet that was included with the DVD is not available here. Because of these omissions, I had to deduct one-star.

Another reason for the deduction is that the menu layout is a little confusing when you get to the extra features, and you're not able to bookmark the timeline. Maybe this was an issue with my PS3, but I was not able to put a placeholder, when I had to stop the playback, and it didn't resume playback when I came back to watch the movie, so it was a little annoying to have to start all the way back from the beginning -- including disclaimer titles -- to get to the scene selection menu and find my way back to where I'd left off.

Here's a run down of the goodies on the Blu-Ray:

*****  SPECIAL FEATURES  *****

* The Making Of Dressed To Kill * = 43:51-minutes
Featurette from 2001 with De Palma, stars Nancy Allen (Liz Blake), Angie Dickinson (Kate Miller), Keith Gordon (Peter Miller), Dennis Franz (Detective Marino), producer George Litto, and editor Jerry Greenberg, discussing the making of the movie from start to finish.

* Film Comparison * = 05:14-minutes
Comparison between the Unrated, R-rated, and Network versions of the movie including the shower, elevator, psychiatrist office, and nightmare scenes.

* Slashing Dressed To Kill * = 09:50-minutes
Featurette discussing how challenging it was to get past the censors and how many scenes had to be altered. It's a good thing that De Palma shot and preserved the movie as is, which is how we get the ""unrated"" version today.

* Appreciation By Keith Gordon * = 06:06-minutes
The actor who plays ""Peter Miller,"" Angie Dickinson's son in the movie, critically discusses the genius of De Palma's filming techniques. This was interesting to watch because if gives you little nuggets of things to watch for in the movie.

So, if you're a fan of DRESSED TO KILL, I highly recommend the Blu-Ray version for the pristine picture quality on HD. If high definition isn't that much of a factor for you and you own the DVD then I'd say you don't really need to upgrade it. Again, there's nothing extra on the Blu-Ray that isn't on the DVD, in fact, you'll get one less feature.",1320192000,4,3646,5.041597337770383

This story takes place in New York city. A married woman, Kate Miller, visits her psychiatrist to discuss her emotional problems. [Sinful desires?] Later she visits a museum. She sees a man with her lost gloves in a taxi, and joins him. Later she finds his health report of contagious diseases. [Didn't he commit a crime?] Upon her return home, a strange tall woman enters her elevator and waves a razor. A young woman sees the body! The police later call on Dr. Elliott. Miss Liz Blake is questioned by the police, they don't believe her story. Kate Miller's son plays detective in keeping watch on the patients at Dr. Elliott's office. Miss Blake sees that tall blonde woman watching her as she leaves. Blake runs into the subway. An attack on her is foiled by Kate Miller's son Peter! [Believable?] The son used a hidden camera to take pictures of Dr. Elliott's patients. Liz Blake visits Dr. Elliott to get emotional help. She takes off her coat (she is dressed for warm weather). Outside Peter sees that tall blonde woman and tries to warn Miss Blake! Can she be saved? Yes; and we learn what was going on from the police detective.

Dr. Levy explains the reason for the crimes: psychosexual conflicts. What will happen to this psycho killer? We are told. Liz Blake speaks to Peter Miller, she wants a vacation. Will there be a surprise at the end? Yes! Will it remind you of that shower scene in the 1959 movie ""Psycho""? Will this nightmare ever end?

Brian de Palma has been accused (or credited) with imitating the style and movies of Alfred Hitchcock. Copying from a master is surely good training for anyone. ""Dressed to Kill"" seems to be based on ""Psycho"" but with many changes or improvements. It is not a dull or boring story.

Famous examples of his work are Carrie (1976), Scarface (1983), The Untouchables (1987), and Carlito's Way (1993). ""Dressed to Kill"" is a remarkable mixture of suspense and sensuality, and it has never look greater than in its new, unrated Blu-ray edition.

The film stars Angie Dickinson as Kate Miller, a sexually unsatisfied wife who needs excitement in her life. She unsuccessfully tries to seduce her psychiatrist (Michael Caine), and eventually gets what she wants while visiting a museum, in what turns out to be one long, elaborated, suspenseful scene a la Alfred Hitchcock, whose influence we see in De Palma's work. Unfortunately for Kate, she is brutally murdered, and the killing is witnessed by Liz Blake (Nancy Allen).The assassin noticed that Liz saw him (or her?) committing the crime, and he/she then tries to kill her, too. However, Liz looks for protection and assistance, which is provided by tough cop Detective Marino (Dennis Franz) and Kate's son, Peter (Keith Gordon), who is a technical wizard.

""Dressed to Kill"" begins just like De Palma's ""Carrie"", with a nice, but sexually charged, shower scene, and, if you happen to like naked women, it will hook you immediately. However, what follows is absorbing and intriguing, De Palma's way, and keeps you glued to the very end.

666489,4,6303471390,"No one could think this is simply a murder mystery. Brian De Palma's film, of course, revolves around a killing and the efforts of several characters to uncover the culprit. Nevertheless, ""Dressed to Kill"" is actually a complex metaphor on law and sexuality.

What does law have to do with sexuality? It won't be necessary to observe the obvious legal nature surrounding certain sexual plateaus, id est, prostitution or sexual reassignment surgery. No. What matters the most is the foundation of society itself which relies heavily on heterosexual normativity. As Judith Butler elucidates in ""Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of Sex"", the law not only forbids and restricts, but also forces sexuality in a given direction.

Traditional psychoanalysis has often interpreted the male homosexual as a `feminized fag' while the female homosexual was a `phallicized lesbian'. This simplistic division has proven useful when degrading homosexuals or simply accusing them of indulging in the vilest crime a man could commit: refusing masculinity. That's why homosexuality represented, and perhaps to this day still does, the `abject' in the minds of many.

In ""Dressed to Kill"" an elegant woman is murdered in a building; later the only witness of the crime (a high-class prostitute) describes to the police what she saw: a blonde woman with big sun glasses and rough features. Although it's not made evident one can easily assume the murderer is, in fact, a transvestite. The identity or the motives behind the crime, however, will be revealed as the film progresses.

Police officers at first apparently include the prostitute in the list of suspects. But also Michael Caine's character, a prestigious shrink, raises a few doubts. And why wouldn't he? After Hannibal Lecter films, one can only grow uncomfortable around such shrinks. No one else has seen this mysterious women with sun glasses, which some might consider a leitmotiv in De Palma's work (let's remember the disguised woman at the beginning of ""Snake Eyes"", blonde wig and sun glasses). Although police investigators point out that one of Cain's patients could be the killer, and indeed that's the most probable alternative. But what about the man who had just engaged in sexual intercourse with the victim?

Sex and law seem to be rather present in the film. If the social rule is to forbid homosexuality, what happens when the forbidden becomes eroticized? After all, a taboo is always highly erotic whereas that which is common and normal can only get boring after a while. For Jacques Lacan homosexuality was the interdict, was it simply because anything that would defy heterosexuality could revoke the social contract (the same one that appears on the good book: be fruitful and multiply)? In what conditions and according to what rules is homosexuality the living perspective of death? Since the beginning, the viewer might suspect that the not so sassy transvestite will at the very least get the capital sentence. Even more so if one remembers that this is not a regular criminal, but it's also an individual that threatens the very heterosexual normativity, which after all can be even more sacred than life and death.

Judith Butler also helps us define performativity. The reiteration of hegemonic norms can only be possible if someone ""performs"". What are laws? Are they mere words written on documents? No. absolutely not. The law is the exercise of the law: the law doesn't ""exist"", it ""happens"". When a judge stands in court, law is happening. When the law sits restful on the penal code it doesn't exist. The court of law is important as an institution because it brings about the actual practice of law. However, the judge doesn't create the law, he quotes it. And by quoting it the judge reinterprets it: A long time ago, the law would claim that every citizen could vote. Of course, only white men would vote as only they were considered citizens. As time went on, through the performativity of law, judges reinterpreted the legal codes until black men could vote too; and after some time, they would reinterpret the law so that women could also vote. Did the law change? Not really, it had always been said that every citizen could vote, what changed was who could be considered a citizen, and this was only possibly throughout what Butler calls performativity. It's this same performativity which will allow in the future gay marriages and other civil rights long time overdue.

As usual, authority is invested upon a certain individual. That's what the prostitute learns when she's attacked by a group of petty delinquents. When she encounters a cop all threat vanishes at once. She demands the police officer to be present at all times, or else no one will uphold the law. Nonetheless, law can also be subverted through performativity. And that's what being a transvestite is all about: first the heterosexual normativity is quoted, in the same manner the judge would read a legal document, and then the transvestite reinterprets the rules. In this case, if it's mandatory for a man to love women exclusively, then the transvestite places himself as the woman. Thus the `code' remains intact but everything else has changed. In De Palma's film, the transvestite is an exscinded subject, he is a man but he is obsessed with transforming into a woman. By wearing women clothes and a wig, he becomes that which nullifies his masculinity: a woman. Except he's not really a woman, he's the transfixed metaphor of sexual interdiction and subversion. Once again, everything about sex is about law.",1317686400,,5585,5.0313513513513515

DePalma's film is equal parts thriller and adroit self reflective humor playing with the audience's expectations and the knowledge that it is a film.

""Dressed to Kill"" continues to demonstrate DePalma's often perverse sense of humor that he first put on display with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sisters-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00004W3HG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sisters (The Criterion Collection)</a>.

When a transsexual patient of Doctor Robert Elliot (Michael Caine) goes on a serial killing spree, a hooker Liz Blake(Nancy Allen)finds herself both one of the prime suspects AND the potential victim. She works with the son (Keith Gordon) of a victim in trying to find the real killer and not be murdered in the process.

The MGM Blu-ray transfer is an improvement over the original DVD and while I wouldn't call it perfect, it's quite a bit better than some folks have complained; viewers need to keep in mind that this was made in 1980 when there was a major shift in the type of film stocks (and shooting styles)being used and ""Dressed to Kill"" although looking quite nice on Blu-ray is VERY much reflecting of the decade it was shot in.

Although it isn't quite as good as the recent transfer of DePalma's ""Blow Up"" done by Criterion (a later film which shares many of the characteristics in terms of the ""look"" of the film), the images for ""DtK"" are sharper, there's better depth although certain shots have an inherent softness that was intentional from the beginning by the cinematographer Ralf Bode (""Coalminer's Daughter"")and director DePalma.

The audio sounds quite good but, again, keep in mind when it was made--1980--prior to the introduction of Surround Sound and when many films were still being exhibited in mono. The 5.1 mix sounds pretty good for it's time improving on the previous DVD version although the film could probably due with a proper restoration with a contemporary mix to 5.1, it's unlikely to happen. Pino Donaggio's score sounds quite nice in its presentation here.

Although this is a recent release you wouldn't know it from the way the menu is designed; it features a poorly designed interface and when you pop the film in it just starts. The special features which were ported over from the 2001 DVD (and, I suspect, this might be an older high def transfer of the film as well)are quite good giving some insight into DePalma's intent and what atttracted the actors to the material. It's a pity that Michael Caine wasn't interviewed for this reissue.

We get an interesting film comparison between the theatrical/unrated/tv versions of the film which is quite interesting particularly if you weren't aware of the censorship that occurred at the time as film directors were increasingly pushing the barrier of what was acceptable.

The 45 minute making-of film provides us with interviews of Dickenson, DePalma, Gordon and Allen discussing the making of the film, it's reception and their take on it today. It's got some amusing stories about the making of the film as well.

The appreciation by actor/director Keith Gordon is particularly interesting; Gordon's perspective as a film director himself allows for a meaningful take on why the film still works so well. We also get the original theatrical trailer as well as a photo gallery and a featurette on what was edited out of the film to maintain an ""R"" rating at the time.

Although few would argue that ""Dressed to Kill"" broke any ground as a thriller, DePalma's film pushes the boundaries of what the audience wanted to see in a thriller in some unique, sometimes humorous ways creating a film that this is as much about the process of the audience watching a film as it is about the story we see on screen.

666492,5,6303471390,"It's very exciting to see DRESSED TO KILL on blu ray and for all fans the question when a blu ray of an older film already owned on dvd comes to blu ray is - how does it look?  Is it worth it to double or even triple dip?  The answer here is a resounding YES - the film looks and sounds great on blu ray and is a must have.  There has always been much controversy over how good a film DRESSED TO KILL is and as to how original director Brian De Palma actually is.  Many critics considered this a Hitchcock rip-off and others thought De Palma used his same standard directiorial mechanics here to results similar to his other films.  I myself love this film and like to think any Hitchcockian comparisons are actually done in a respectful bow to Hitchcock.  And though I did find some scenes similar to those in De Palma's CARRIE, this film stands on its own as an excellent scary and suspenseful film with a very original story line.  We know De Palma loves his shower scenes here and the shots with Angie Dickinson (and the body double for close ups) are legendary.

But what about the bu ray.  This is a film from 1980 and overall the video presentation here is superb.  Though the picture isn't always fully sharp the clarity is excellent.  Close ups are crystal clear with flesh tones very realistic.  Colors are vivid and pop.  The black/white ratio is overall excellent.  Sometimes blacks come across a little shadowy but this most likely has to do with the original film source.  There is some graininess but it is again part of the intentional viewing experince.  With the blu ray you get an overall clear, exciting and vivid picture with clarity that pulls you in.  And the audio is amazing.  The DTS HD Master 5.1 track provided has dialogue strong throughout with all the surround speakers used to full effect.  In the shower scenes you will hear water from all your speakers.  Background noise and the ever effective musical score that highlight this film come out strong and sure from all speakers as well.  This film is one that will scare you.  From the click of Angie Dickinson's shoes as she walks thru the museum to the swipe of the blade the sounds are all strong and realistic.  And the true scare moments - just let me say the excellent audio here will have you jumping out of your skin.

Debates aside this film is excellent and definitely a standout thriller from the 80s.  The plot is also above your regular thriller.  From the opening shower scene with Angie to the film end every scene has a purpose in the plot.  This is an adult thriller and I highly recommend the superb blu ray transfer.  It will be like watching the film for the first time.",1316390400,56,2673,4.444444444444445
666493,5,6303471390,"This is one of my favorite De Palma films, next to Blow Out. I absolutely adore his early work (Sisters, Obsession, The Fury, Dressed to Kill, Blow Out, Body Double), I don't think his thrillers have been matched in style and tension. This is an extremely solid film for it's genre and time. I feel it holds up well. Brief Synopsis to avoid spoilers: A psychiatrist has women patients being stalked and attacked. The son of one of the victims goes into his own investigation to find out who the killer is as well. I know this description is arbitrary...but for other De Palma fans who've seen this, the fun is discovering this film as blindly as possible. Pino Donnagio's music, De Palma's cinematography (the museum scenes anyone?), and his pacing is absolutely seemless and beautiful. It's hard to deny this is an inspired homage to Hitchcock's films, in a great way though.

My gripe with this release? Shame on MGM for releasing such a sub par disc on this beautiful film. The transfer is an improvement, some what. The sound, not so much. There isn't even a menu and the special features are the same features you can see from the DVD release of 2001. Why bother? Understandably...they went all out on the new Scarface release, but why not show the same appreciation and effort to introduce this film to a completely different audience? MGM shouldve sold the rights to Criterion Collection. Criterion wouldve treated this film the way it truly shouldve been. Watch this film! Enjoy...just be aware...it's the lesser of two evils buying this ridiculous excuse for a release. You can buy this at a normal price...or spend an arm and a leg from some turd that knows the DVD is out of print, and is milking it.",1316044800,8,1711,4.6843853820598005
666494,5,6303471390,"First,about the blu ray. It has an improved picture. Noticeable, especially at the end of the museum scene where there used to be a glitch on the negative on the 2001 dvd. It was filmed in 2:35 widescreen aspect ratio so there will be black bars on your t.v.  The DTS sound is great you can hear the music better. It was smart of them to keep the special features from the 2001 dvd. They were well done. Wish the same had been done for the blu ray of ""Carrie""('76). I am very pleased with this blu ray and certainly hope they use the special features from the special edition dvd's of ""The Fog""('80), ""The Howling""('81), and eventually ""Carrie""('76).
  This original thriller has Hitchcockian touches, but is its own film. Very artistically done with excellent camera work, such as the framing of the shots, use of split screen and split diopter for scenes. Great costumes by Ann Roth and a fine score by Pino Donaggio. It was modern for its time and still is in a lot of ways as far as the look of the film and its complicated adult themes.",1315958400,13,1041,4.411458333333333
666495,4,6303471390,"Dressed to Kill , a great Brian DePalma has finally gotten a BluRay release. While I personally haven't waited all that long I know that legions of its fans have waited a long time for it to be released.
For those that have not seen it, Dressed to Kill is an erotic murder mystery - with Kate Miller (Angie Dickinson) as a sex starved lady who is killed by a mysterious person - a lady with dark sunglasses- witnessed by by escort Liz Blake (Nancy Allen).
Michael Caine also stars in what I felt was an incredible role for him. While this mystery unfolds we get plenty of nudity, some gore and a few tongue in cheek moments with Detective Marino (Dennis Franz)
I highly recommend this movie because of its great suspenseful moments. If you liked Psycho, which inspired this ( and countless others) movie.
About the disc - to be honest upon a second review, this is a good, but not huge improvement over the 2001 release in terms of print quality , I don't see all too much of a difference. It is not enhanced for 16 x 9 televisions meaning you get the black bars on the top and bottom. To be honest, I recently went HD and Blu so you won't see much in the way of terminology :)
What I can say is that the 1080i may make the image better/brighter but I just didn't see anything overwhelming about it
As for the disc, the movie just plays without menus, and when it ends, the movie starts again, and furthermore when I try to access the bonus features ( same as the 2001 release) I had to hit ""Top Menu Pop Up"" or the arrow pointing upward to see them and every bonus feature I tried to access would cause my player to freeze
The screen goes black and all I see is ""Play 0:00 > "" and nothing. Total freeze up...which I have now fixed and can access all of the great features, including the R rated version, comparisons of the versions, making of Dressed to Kill, etc..
I first assumed it was a defective disc but thanks to DVD forums and such - BluRay players are similar to software on your PC where you need to update it from time to time via flash drive or discs from the manufacturer or download to disc to use on your player.
UPDATE - Just to confirm -as of this writing my new copy came in and I have now learned today about Firmware - which is an update that you download from your BluRay players manufacturer's website to either a disc or flash drive which you insert into your BluRay player. This update helps you view the movie or supplements that could cause your player to freeze if you don't update - It was not the disc, it was my player needing an upgrade so YES if you want to get this DVD , go for it , but make sure your firmware is up to date for those do not have the highest end latest greatest BluRay players.",1315526400,6,2729,4.2

666572,5,6303471390,"1980 was a very good year for some groundbreaking films in different genres that completely reshaped and redefined the genre they represented, ranging from Stanley Kubrick's haunting psychological ghost story horror film ""The Shining"" to Brian De Palma's erotic psychological mystery thriller ""Dressed To Kill"".

Written & directed by De Palma, this chiller did for elevators what Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" did for showers two generations before it, and still has people squeamish of elevators; and for good reason. This is a darkly satiric film about voyeurism, paranoia, erotica, sexual perversion, sexual deviancy, sexual identity, psychological fear, sexual escapades, and murder, which tells a story of a sexually frustrated housewife who is only trying to find sexual satisfaction and has a one night stand, then gets sliced the f**k up in an elevator by a transsexual with a sexual identity crisis, starring Angie Dickinson, Nancy Allen, Michael Caine, and Dennis Franz.

The film starts with, not one, but two back-to-back erotic sex scenes, the first as the film opens and Kate Miller (Dickinson) is in the shower, soaping herself in a very erotic way as her husband is shaving right outside the shower curtain, when a strange man appears and proceeds to rape her from behind, only for her to awaken in bed while having sex with her husband. De Palma bookends the film with dream sequences, beginning the film with Angie Dickinson, and the last one with Nancy Allen's character Liz Blake, in the shower, and they're both very erotic yet suspenseful scenes in one sense or another.

Produced by De Palma's friend, George Litto, who had produced ""Obsession"", and ""Blow Out"" after this one, this is an excursion into psychological erotic madness that is as grotesque, gory, twisted, perverted, demented, deranged, horrifying, spellbinding, sensual, elegant, thrilling, bloody, and scary as anything anyone that likes this genre of film would ever want in a film. De Palma uses pretty much all of his trademark techniques here, split-screen, split dioptor, great tracking shots, crane shots, etc, to tell an awesome story that excels in some of the best scenes of visual storytelling ever committed to film.

This is the film that got women's groups calling De Palma 'mysoginistic', saying he was too violent towards women in his films all because he filmed one woman (maybe two???) getting murdered in a very classy manner, yet there were all of these cheesy slasher flicks having women running around as naked as the day they were born, making them act like airhead bimbo's, getting cut all up like spaghetti, but that seemed to be OK; but they wanted to pick on De Palma for this classic masterpiece??? HUH??? REALLY???

This was also the first film that De Palma had to duke it out with the MPAA over ratings (they wanted to give it an X), so he cut it into an R-rated version (which I, personally prefer), but the DVD features both, the R and the Unrated (X) versions of the film. And, this is loaded with a lot of great special bonus features!

HIGHLY recommended! Two Thumbs And A Big Toe!!
Thank you! :>)

PS: A bit of film trivia: De Palma used a 'body double' for Angie Dickinson's nude shower scene, which in turn inspired his 1984 classic ""Body Double"", which was his cinematic 'answer' to critics who wanted to bash him, reproaching his decision for using a body double in this film.",1305072000,10,3396,4.947368421052632

666575,4,6303471390,"When Dressed to Kill came out a lot of people were furious. Some thought it was a rip off of Psycho and Vertigo. Some thought it was woman hating becuase the heroines are an adulteress and a hooker and the villain only attacks women who are not virtuous. People acted like Brian DePalma was film enemy number one. Years have passed and the critics looks silly. Dressed to Kill was a brilliant homage to Hitchcock's body of work. It was both a riddle and a campfire scary tale brought to life on film. Angie Dickensen as Kate, plays a woman who's frustrated and suddenly in an extraordinary sequence gets a chance to make her fantasies come true. Pale, ice blonde and dressed in ladylike white she goes to an art gallery and meets a tall, dark man and falls into his arms, car and bed. Dreamy, right? Yes, but since this is a Hitchcockian movie, poor Kate wakes up to a nightmare. Mr. Tall, Dark and Sexy has a venereal disease and deliberately exposed her to it. DePalma doesn't tell us which one. AIDS was unknown back then but everyone was talking about Herpes which had and still doesn't have a cure. VD was terrifying. All of a sudden Kate's boring life and boring husband don't seem so bad. She tries to go home but runs into someone much, much worse than Mr. Tall Dark and Nasty.

A brassy haired woman in a trench-coat, sunglasses and a big ole knife catches Kate on the elevator and stabs her to death. Just as the audience is going ""Hey, they killed, Angie!"" a new heroine appears. Nancy Allen, who was no Kim Novak but not as bad as the critics said back then, plays a cheerful prostitute who is just leaving a client when she comes sees Kate being attacked. The killer gets a good look at her and the chase is on.

The crazy woman with the knife turns out to be someone who's been hidden in plain sight to the audience all along and it's shocking when the truth comes out. The ending is violent and a real kick in the gut. It's not a happy ending. The killer is caught but the survivors are left with scars that DePalma seems to hint, won't ever go away. Dressed to Kill stands up well after all these years. It's a wry commentary that says some dreams shouldn't come true and there are times when it's better not to know what's  behind a man's mask.",1267920000,3,2261,4.340425531914893

Before she leaves his apartment, she finds papers which certify that the man has a venereal disease. Panicked, Kate rushes into the elevator, but has to return to his apartment when she realizes she's forgotten her wedding ring. When the elevator doors open, she's brutally slashed to death by a tall blonde woman wearing dark glasses. Liz Blake, a high-priced call girl, is the only witness to the murder and she becomes the prime suspect and the murderess's next target. Liz is rescued from being killed by Kate's son Peter, who enlists the help of Liz to catch his mother's killer as Detective Marino who's in charge of the case is uncooperative in the investigation. This is pure Hitchcock with an 80's dash of lurid perversion, an affectionately told tale of lust and murder with plenty of twists, huge helpings of style, a stunning Pino Donaggio score, and a trashy, giallo-inspired plot.

666661,5,6303471390,"Fashionable Manhattan therapist Dr. Robert Elliott (Michael Caine) faces the most terrifying moment of his life, when a psychotic killer begins attacking the women such as the sexually frustrated housewife Kate Miller(Angie Dickinson) and the slutty call girl Liz Blake(Nancy Allen) in his life-- with a straight razor stolen from his office.

Desperate to find the murderer before anyone else is hurt, Elliott is soon drawn into a dark and disturbing world of chilling desires and as the doctor edges closer to the terrible truth, he finds himself lost in a provocative and deadly maze of obsession, deviance and deceit-- where the most harmless erotic fantasies...can become the most deadly sexual nightmares!

This horror flick also starts out with a skintastic nude scene just like Bryan De Palma's CARRIE did along with the fact that director(Bryan De Palma)was married to Nancy Allen at the time since DePalma and Allen were married from 1979-84.

Additionally, DRESSED TO KILL has a shocking heart-pounding ending to the movie, just like De Palma did at the end of the movie CARRIE when Liz wakes up from a nightmare about Dr. Elliott stalking her to Liz's house trying to kill her while she's taking a shower in her bathroom nude and defenseless which was a tad similar similar to what De Palma did at the end of the movie CARRIE when Sue Snell(Amy Irving)wakes up from a nightmare about the unpopular friendless Carrie White(Sissy Spacek) reaching out of the ground from her grave trying to pull Sue down into the ground with her just before Mrs. Snell comes to comfort her from the ugly dream, just like Kate's computer whiz son Peter Miller(Keith Gordon)comes in to console Liz after waking up from a nasty dream about Dr. Elliott escaping from the mental intitution and slashing her throat to death in Elliott's act of vengence.

Additionally, I also liked watching Nancy Allen, Angie Dickerson, and Michael Caine talking about their experiences in the movie DRESSED TO KILL while looking back on it before and during it's theatrical release in the Summer of 1980 as well along with the fact that Nancy Allen is still looking pretty after all these years, just like she did in the movie CARRIE and DRESSED TO KILL, plus Nancy Allen and Bryan De Palma had explained that they were married at the time DRESSED TO KILL was made and released back then too.

It was also interesting seeing Dennis Franz from NYPD BLUE & HILL STREET BLUES playing the bitter homicide dick(Det. Marino) investigating the murder of Angie Dickenson, even though Dennis Franz didn't seem to be much help to the murder investigation, since Dennis Franz always seems to play the guy you love to hate in just about every role he plays in a movie or a TV show, even when Dennis Franz plays a good guy.

This movie also takes me all the way back to memory lane to when I was 7 years old and still living in the Imperial Valley since I was living in my hometown(El Centro, CA) at the time when DRESSED TO KILL was released in the theatres in the Summer of 1980 and when I saw this movie for the very first time on HBO in April of 1981 along with the fact that DRESSED TO KILL was quite a deliciously nasty movie with plenty of graphic nudity as well as a gory one.",1218585600,2,3243,4.670753064798599

666664,5,6303471390,"1980 was a very good year for some groundbreaking films in different genres that completely reshaped and redefined the genre they represented. Ridley Scott's sci-fi noir thriller ""Blade Runner"", Stanley Kubrick's haunting psychological ghost story horror film ""The Shining"", and Brian DePalma's erotic psycological slasher thriller ""Dressed To Kill"".
Written & directed by DePalma, this chiller did for elevators what Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" did for showers two generations before it, and still has people sqeamish of elevators; and for good reason.
This is a film about voyuerism, paranoia, erotica, sexual perversion, sexual deviancy, sexual identity, psychology, fear, sexual escapades, and murder. Starring Angie Dickinson (tv's ""Police Woman""), Nancy Allen (DePalma's ""Carrie"", ""Home Movies"", and ""Blow Out, plus being DePalma's wife), Micheal Caine, Dennis Franz (DePalma's ""The Fury"", ""Blow Out"", and ""Body Double"", plus tv's ""Hill Street Blues"" & ""NYPD Blue""), and Keith Gordon (DePalma's ""Home Movies"" and Carpenter's ""Christine""), DePalma tells a story of a sexually frustrated housewife who is only trying to find sexual satisfaction and has a one night stand, then gets sliced the f**k up in an elevator by a transexual with a sexual identity crisis.
The film starts with, not one, but two back-to-back erotic sex scenes, the first as the film opens and Kate Miller (Dickinson) is in the shower, soaping herself in a very erotic way as her husband is shaving right outside the shower curtain. Then a man starts raping her from behind and she starts screaming, only to come to reality where she is lying in bed with her husband doing his 'business' on top of her, and she is faking the entire time, then he's done, and rolls over and goes to sleep.
She checks in on her son, Peter Miller (Gordon, playing a character that DePalma has said was based on himself at that age, a nerdy science geek with a computer, well, a machine that he built, called a differential analyzer), then she goes to see her therapist, Dr. Robert Elliott (Caine), and proceeds to tell him about her sexual frustration with her husband, flirting a bit with Dr. Elliott. She then visits a museum in one of the films many highlights of great visual storytelling, with over a twenty minute long take with hardly any dialogue at all. She meets a man, then a cool/frustrating game of cat-and-mouse begins, and the museum is like a maze, and DePalma uses this set piece to his best benefit, swirling the camera this way and that, and starting what will become a sucession of awesome flashbacks, shown in dual optor projection, so you see the present along with the flashback all in one scene.
After losing one glove behind, Kate leaves the museum in frustration, only to see the man awaiting her in a nearby cab, his arm extended, waving the missing glove (this is right after she takes off her OTHER glove and tosses it down), and she heads for the cab. Look close and you'll see a very quick glimpse of 'Bobbi', the killer, in this scene, once as the camera is slowly turning to show the cab, then after Kate gets in the cab, a gloved hand reaches out and picks Kate's glove up.?.?.
The cab scequence is VERY erotic, almost ""Basic Instinct"" erotic, but so much more tastefully done, as the guy proceeds to go down, if you get the idea. Kates screams her head off with pleasure!
Later that night, she awakens in the hotel room and starts gathering her things, proceeding to get dressed and leave. She remembers her panties were left in the cab (in another split dioptor scene). Oh, no!! She then stops at a desk in the room to write a 'thank you & goodbye' message to the guy, and discovers papers inside the desk from the local health department disclaiming that ""you have contracted a venereal disease"", which of coarse means chances are that Kate now has contracted the same disease as well...Oh, the horrors!!
She gets on the elevator (again, there is a quick shot of 'Bobbi' hiding behind an emergency door as Kate is awaiting the elevator). Kate remembers she left her wedding ring in the hotel room (in yet another brilliant split dioptor shot)...Oh, NO!! So, she has to go back up and retrieve it. When the doors open, there stands 'Bobbi' and 'her' straight razor (who we find out later she stole from Dr. Elliott), and is, yes, 'dressed to kill'! This slasher moment puts any and/or all other slasher films to shame (except ""Halloween"" and ""Psycho"") in just one scene! And, this is where DePalma splits the story from being Kate's to now being Liz Blake's (Allen), as he cuts to her and her 'john' (she's a professional call girl) waiting for the elevator a floor below. As the doors open, there is a moment where the two women's eyes meet in the elevator mirror, then the gleaming razor blade catches Liz's attention, and she see's the killer, all filmed in glorious slow motion, with an awesome score by Pino Donnagio. Liz grabs the razor blade after 'Bobbi' drops it, the elevator doors close, and now Liz is a murder suspect.
This is where the film turns into an awesome cop procedural, with a very hard-a** detective Marino (Franz), whose questions to Liz are fast, rapid, rabid, vile, and hilarious all at the same time. Yes, this is also satire, for DePalma puts irony and satire in all of his films. And, at the police station, DePalma makes use of another great set piece to show one person listening to another, as another listens to yet another, making it a game of who's listening in on who.?.?. And, the way he filters all of these transactions through pane glass brilliantly mirrors his split dioptor effect already used, and an upcoming split screen that he will eventually use.
Peter and Liz meet, and Peter and Dr. Elliott meet, and Peter takes it upon himself to investigate the doctor, believing his mother may have been killed by one of his patients; as does Detective Marino. But, he also suspects Liz, maybe not of murder, but of something. Meanwhile, Liz is spied upon by 'Bobbi', and Dr. Elliott is getting wierd messages on his answering machine from 'Bobbi' hinting at the crime 'she' just committed, even admitting to stealing the doctor's straight razor. In a split screen shot that lasts for a very good time, Liz is on the phone with her 'boss' trying to get the phone number of the man who was with her when the elevator doors opened, for he was a witness as well, but he took off running, and Liz has no success finding him. On the other side of the screen, 'Bobbi' is seen standing outside Liz's apartment building with binoculars, spying on her, as Liz, on the other side of the split screen is shown making more phone calls, talking to her 'boss' again, trying to line up a 'dinner and date' for the next evening. Then it shows Dr. Elliot on the other side of the screen listening to his answering machine, and checking and noticing his straight razor IS missing. Meanwhile, both sides have an episoed of tv's ""Phil Donahue"" playing in the background, and it is dealing with Phil talking to a transexual who has had the final operation; and, as both characters, Liz and Dr. Elliott continue going about their business, oblivious to the tv screen, still shown in brilliant split screen, the tv show starts getting larger and larger on both sides of the film as the subject of transexuality is being discussed. And, then the film goes back to 'normal', cutting to Liz going out for the evening, being followed by a blonde woman, maybe the very same blonde woman she saw in the elevator, and that killed Kate Miller. She sweet talks the young cabbie into running a red light, leaving the blonde woman behind, but when she arrives at the subway station, there is 'Bobbi' awaiting her, thus leading on an extremely breathless/breathtaking subway ride, with her running from 'Bobbi' the whole ride. I won't spoil the outcome of this scene for anything.
Peter has developed the film he has filmed of patients coming and going outside Dr. Elliots office, and he shows it to Liz, and she goes to Detective Marino, who acts as if he still doesn't believe her, but hints that maybe she could break into Dr. Elliot's office and steal his patient list, so she does.
And, this is one of the most memorable erotic scenes in film history!
Decked out in a raincoat with black under garments underneath, Liz proceeds to talk to Dr. Elliot about fictional (though she tells him they are real) erotic dreams she's been having, meanwhile flirting with the good doctor the entire time, and undressing as she talks about the dream. Matter of fact, the whole set up of telling him the dream s**t is supposed to get him aroused so she can seduce him then try and either get him to tell her about the patient that may have killed Kate, and/or sneak and steal his patient list like Dectective Marino advised. Meanwhile, it is dark, raining, and storming outside the office, making it even more erotic than imaginable. And, even more terrorfying!
Peter is outside the office, wiping rain from his face as he tries to watch from afar through a window that Liz has opened the blinds on for him to be able to see in. Again, it's a matter of who's watching who, like the police station when it was a matter of who's listening to/spying on who. The pacing is dynamic in this scene, tension building up so great, it could make a person have a stroke wanting for it to climax already; but, DePalma, the ultimate Master Of Suspense, isn't about to let up until it's time to let up!
Again, I'm not gonna go any further, for I don't wanna give away anything to anyone who's maybe never seen this classic masterpiece, except to say 'Bobbi' is caught, a great exposition scene is done, explaining who 'Bobbi' REALLY is and why the murder happened, and what will become of 'Bobbi'.
But, I will add that the film then proceeds into a dream sequence of 'Bobbi' killing a nurse and escaping the mental institution, and going straight for Liz. The way DePalma films a mental institution (like he did in ""Sisters"") is out of this world, for he makes you feel as if you are right there inside a very REAL madhouse, with inmates that look just like anything you could ever imagine ever seeing in an insane asylum.
Many people rag on the dream sequence, saying that it is too much like the ending of ""Carrie"", but they are wrong...It is the final scene in which the character(s) having the dream awaken(s) that is a bit too close to ""Carrie"". The dream sequence is possibly the best part of the film, and that's saying a LOT, because this film is loaded with awesome scenes every which way you look at it. Plus, I think it is extremely brilliant the way DePalma book-ends this film with dream sequences, the first one with Kate in the shower, and the last one with Liz in the shower, and they're both very suspenseful scenes in one sense or another.
Produced by DePalma's friend, George Litto, who had produced ""Obsession"", and ""Blow Out"" after this one, this is an excursion into psychological erotic madness that is as grotesque, gory, twisted, perverted, demented, deranged, horrorfying, spellbinding, sensual, elegant, thrilling, bloody, and scary as anything anyone that likes this genre of film would ever want in a film.
This is the film that got women's groups calling DePalma 'mysoginistic', saying he was too violent towards women in his films all because he filmed one woman (maybe two???) getting murdered in a very classy manner, yet there were all of these cheesy slasher flicks having women running around as naked as the day they were born, making them act like airhead bimbo's, getting cut all up like spaghetti, but that seemed to be OK; but they wanted to pick on DePalma for this classic masterpiece??? HUH??? REALLY???
This was also the first film that Depalma had to duke it out with the MPAA over ratings (they wanted to give it an X), so he cut it into an R-rated version (which I, personally prefer), but the DVD features both, the R and the Unrated (X) versions of the film, and they're on the same side of the disc, so you don't have to flip it over. And, this is loaded with a lot of great special bonus features!
HIGHLY  recommended! Two Thumbs And A Big Toe!!
Thank you & happy Halloween! ;-)
PS: A bit of film trivia: DePalma used a 'body double' for Angie Dickinson's nude shower scene, which in turn inspired his 1984 classic ""Body Double"", which was his cinematic 'answer' to critics who wanted to bash him, reproaching his decision for using a body double in this film.",1193702400,6,12477,4.684282460136674
666665,4,6303471390,"A great classic in the genre of the compulsive killer. It is well done though definitely easy. In many ways it is a remake of Hitchcock's Psycho, yet it is pure New York and it has some kind of a flavor, that of the modern cop-film. The cop is both arrogant and negligent and he runs risks via other people. He goes to  a football game or some sports event with his children while someone is running the risk of being killed, and he knows it. So we have the inventiveness of a teenager and the tenacity of a hooker and they both manage to find the killer and even more or less trap him, though they could have been killed in doing so. The final touch though, the punch line of the film is a real twist in the fabric of logical thrilling. And what about having had it wrong all along? Entertaining indeed.

666753,4,6303471390,"Alfred Hitchcock's style of filmmaking is the one that has probably been the most copied of any filmmaker ever in Hollywood, for the simple reason that he perfected the art of cinematic suspense.  And perhaps no director has been more accused of allegedly blatantly imitating the Master than Brian DePalma.  Such accusations are not completely accurate, however, and they don't tell the whole story.  The film in DePalma's canon that is so often cited by critics as his being so blatantly imitative of the portly Englishman is the 1980 thriller DRESSED TO KILL.

The film places the great Angie Dickinson in the role of a frustrated single mother with sexual desires that she confides in to her psychiatrist (Michael Caine), desires that include one nightmarish sequence of her being strangled in her shower.  She follows a mysterious man through a Manhattan art gallery; but when she returns home, a blonde psychopath brutally slashes her to death in her apartment complex's elevator.

In the interim, the police, including a very profane detective (Dennis Franz, of ""NYPD Blue"" fame), are looking into the crime and have somehow managed to finger a blonde hooker (Nancy Allen) who had been seen around Dickinson's residence.  The problem is, however, that she isn't the real perpetrator (a very tried-and-true Hitchcock conceit, an innocent person accused of a crime they didn't commit); and she teams up with Dickinson's whiz-kid son (Keith Gordon) to find who really did it.  All the evidence seems to point to another patient of Caine's with some sexual issues.  The end results are positively spine-chilling.

By any stretch of the imagination, DRESSED TO KILL is quite obviously inspired by Hitchcock's PSYCHO, although there are also significant references to the Master's earlier classics VERTIGO and REAR WINDOW as well.  The big difference, of course, is that, whereas Hitchcock was largely limited in what he could show onscreen because of the censorship restrictions in place prior to 1968 (which worked wonders in PSYCHO), DePalma didn't have those limitations, and was allowed to show more direct sex and violence, though it never really came all that close to pornography or the overblown blood-and-guts horrors of FRIDAY THE 13TH, which was also released in 1980.  Dickinson is quite good in what was an atypical kind of film for her; and Caine, one of the great actors of our time, is equally fine.  Pino Donnagio's score, not surprisingly, is very close in feel to what Bernard Herrmann provided for Hitchcock's masterworks.

Despite a somewhat cliched trick ending (repeating in some ways what DePalma did at the end of CARRIE, and John Boorman at the end of DELIVERANCE) and a very hammy acting job by Franz, DRESSED TO KILL is a very strong psychological horror/suspense film at a time when blood and guts were starting to flood the horror genre (though the year 1980 also gave us Kubrick's masterpiece THE SHINING, too).  Films like this are even rarer nowadays in Hollywood than they were back then, and they need to be treasured.",1162512000,2,3054,5.043737574552684

This movie is from one of my favorite directors, Brian De Palma, and I have done many other reviews of his movies.  But this movie stands out as my favorite by this director.

His use of the camera, though criticized in other attempts at art in his other movies, rings true, in this attempt.  He really is a genius, with the movie camera.

I would recommend watching this, snuggled up, with a significant other, and be prepared for shockwaves.  It will blow your mind with its outrageous cinematography.

666755,5,6303471390,"Dressed to Kill is one of the quintessential thrillers of the 1980s.  De Palma's ode to Hitchcock becomes completely successful and believable totally independent of whatever source material it was derived from.

Kate Miller (Angie Dickinson) is in a troubled marriage.  She has no spark with her husband anymore, but she does have a genius son that she truly loves.  To try to keep the marriage together, Kate goes to see a psychiatrist (Michael Caine) who, as most doctors do, suggests that she just talk out her problems with her husband.  We, the viewers, know it won't be that simple, though. From the doctor's office, Kate goes to an art gallery, and engages in a flirty game of cat-and-mouse with a fellow observer.  This sequence is classic De Palma, and it ends with the two strangers making love in the back of a taxi cab, and later at the man's apartment.  Everything appears to be going swimmingly until Kate gets in the elevator to leave in the middle of the night.  From this point the movie turns exquisitely violent, with a murder scene that will stay with you for quite a while (at least it did with me).  After the murder has taken place, the viewer is left to decipher who the murderer is and what the motive was.

Just like all De Palma films, Dressed to Kill features some absolutely brilliant sequences (elevator, train station) dispersed throughout a rather clumsy plot.  But hey, who cares right?  You definitely enjoy the ride.  Also, Dressed to Kill's ending is right up there with De Palma's best.",1156550400,,1524,4.70566037735849

The downside of the movie, at least to anyone that has some kind of moral standard, is the general sleaziness of all the characters, including the policeman played by a pre-NYPD Dennis Franz (who has hair here!).

The opening scene is still shocking with a fairly long shower scene of Angie Dickinson that is quite explicit, even 25 years after its release. The film has several erotic scenes in it as Dickinson (if that is really her on the closeups) and Nancy Allen are not shy about showing their bodies.

There is not much dialog in the first 20 minutes and no bad language until Franz enters the picture after the murder.

Such is the scene that starts in the museum with Angie Dickinson being cruised, then cruising, then being picked up and taken away. She wakens in the morning, finds out a secret, leaves and is then killed horribly. It is rare that you will see all that take place and not a word is spoken by any of the principal actors.

The movie shifts gears after that and the cat is after the mouse.

Technology that was available at the time is brought into use. DePalma's use of split screens and camera angels keeps the movie going along. Nancy Allen plays a role she plays well... a hooker. But one of the principal actors here.

I would say that this is DePalma's second best movie. His best is without a doubt 'Body Double'.

Sure, they're both a lot like hitchcock. But that's okay. I liked hitchcock and I'm glad to see somebody making films so close to his you sometimes cannot tell the difference.

Speaking of body double, I understand that the making of that film was as a result of the criticism that DePalma and Dickinson recieved for the use of a body double in this movie. Interesting.",1125705600,12,1211,4.4324324324324325
666881,5,6303471390,"If we drew a straight line between Hitchcock and his most remarkable followers two names: Claude Chabrol in France and Brian de Palma and weaving finer we should agree that Dressed is the best and most mature film of De Palma.

Evidently there are more than happy coincidence respect top previous Hitchcock entries. First at all Angie Dickinson has committed an unforgettable sin, she has infringed adultery and now like Leigh in Psycho she will have the weight of the guilt with her early death, curiously by the same sin.

The first part of the film concludes with her murderer, brilliantly made with a superb slow motion and astonishing handle camera.

The psychopath is a twist of  Norman Bates. Two crossed and antagonist personalities living in the same body. Opposite sides of the same coin facing one each other and trying to maintain a fragile equilibrium, as we will see.

In the other hand we have a Peeping Tom but smartly embodied by a nerd: a brilliant electronic student who will become eventually in the target of funny double jokes.

But the main character is Nancy Allen that made an accurate role ( the best in her career) as charismatic and sympathetic pros who will be the hook and future victim of her dangerous game in her particular search of the assassin.

The script is smart and in despite of the fact more than twenty have elapsed, the movie maintains its febrile tension.

An undeniable triumph of de Palma, without forgetting obviously the fantastic performance of Michael Caine who lived his Golden Decade in the eighties: Educating Rita, Hanna and her sisters,

Mona Lisa and this one. He had to win at least another additional Award with Mona Lisa, too.

666882,4,6303471390,"There are sequences in DRESSED TO KILL that may be as formally accomplished as any film sequences ever made. The scene in the police station, with multiple framings and glass partitions mirroring De Palma's use of the split screen in other sequences (and with the characters secretly eavesdropping and spying on one another while being oblivious to how they are being spied on by others) is a virtuoso example, but the most stunning--and the most famous--may be Angie Dickinson's cruising sequence in the museum, with Dickinson lured and teased by a mysterious man with whom she's flirting. Although this was a big hit when released, DRESSED TO KILL has not sustained its reputation quite so much over the years as much as other De Palma films have, such as CARRIE and THE UNTOUCHABLES and even SISTERS. In part this may be because the homages to Hitchcock in this film are a bit TOO over the top, even for De Palma. (The dream sequence at the end, as beautifully accomplished as it is, was a mistake to include after the similar dream sequence ending CARRIE.) It's also hurt by the feeble acting of Nancy Allen, De Palma's Tippi Hedren and wife at the time: although memorable as the spoiled beauty queen in CARRIE, Allen just didn't have the chops to compete onscreen with Michael Caine or, particularly, the astonishing Dickinson, who gives a superbly nuanced and sympathetic performance as the lonely aging beauty despite the fact that she has so few lines in the first half of the film. But the great technical virtuosity of this film carries all before it: no one can play with multiple points of view like De Palma can, and his very jokey script allows him numerous opportunities to play hilariously mean pranks on his characters.

This edition of the film comes with a fine featurette with Keith Gordon, who plays the teenage hero of the film, analyzing De Palma's techniques in this film with genuien insight; it also has another featurette that seems like a real mistake about the controversies surrounding the film's release, with De Palma still bitterly whining about accusations at the time of the film's putative misogyny and sensationalism (given his spectacular subsequent career in Hollywood, and the film's financial success when it was released, his grousing seems churlish).",1122940800,11,2294,4.927648578811369

Annihoo, here's another 'seminal' and 'classic' and 'cult' de Palma thriller from the golden-age of Hollywood Nudity. Isn't it amazing what a dull filter and a body-double can do for middle-aged Angie Dickinson's nipples, ladies and gentlemen?

Grrr.

Tawdry faded-star vehicle for Dickinson, vacation-from-taste for Michael Caine, aspirationally good for hapless Nancy Allen, 'Dressed to Kill' is one of those so-called classics that time and technology has been very unkind to. Lacking almost any tension in its predictability (though there are two worthwhile 'jump' moments'), de Palma's trademark extreme suspense is also negated here thanks to lousy performances from Allen and Dickinson, and Caine just looks bored. Glossy and over-awed, the movie goes from bad to worse with the gift of retrospect - the 'crazy transsexual' motif having been done far better many times both before and after this release.

Lurid and voyeuristic (but not in a good, thought-provoking way a la 'Psycho' or 'Pulp Fiction'), 'Dressed to Kill' isn't interesting or fun to watch anymore, and can only be recommended to the most undemanding of film fans.

After awaking in his apartment she is brutally slashed to death in the elevator. Now it's up to the only witness--a high-paid hooker (Allen)--the victim's therapist (Caine, in a duo role) and Dickenson's computer junkie son to discover what this deranged, razor-weilding, wig-adorning, cross-dressing psychopath is truly after.

Sounds corny, but DePalma has an expertise with such stories, as with ""Sisters"" or ""Obsession."" The acting quality is debatably well, especially on Dickenson's part, but the thrill-ride of screams and gore is sure to keep the viewer interested untill the last wrenching scene.

Pino Donnagio's score suits the film fantastically, and one wonders why DePalma was his only employer. The museum sequence is a perfect example of how music and camera use can speak for the story.

The films of Brian DePalma have often been critiqued as Hitchcock rip-offs, except for taking the shock elements a leap further. Well, the camerawork is certainly Hitchcockian, as is the scoring--but to say that it's a rip-off, is a lie. With all due respect, it takes a certain taste to appreciate a DePalma film, and many critics do not have it.

The elevator scene--the uncut version you CAN see on the Specian Edition DVD--is pure cinematic genius. And if the techniques used in the Museum chase don't remind you of Vertigo, I don't know what will.

This film is DePalma at the top of his game, and is a MUST see for DePalma and Hitchcock fanatics alike.

666946,3,6303471390,"Brian de Palma knew his 1970s audience. When choosing what film to see at the cinema (if you had a choice in those days), it was difficult for many men to persuade their girlfriends to choose an out-and-out erotic movie. (The cinema scene in 'Carry On Camping' gives you some idea of the prevailing attitudes.) So, much like the Hammer movies, de Palma wrapped up the sex in a glossy horror thriller coating. Bizarrely, girls found it much easier to tell their mums that they'd be going to see 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' than 'Swedish Nurses Get Hot', or whatever.
But watching this movie with 25 years of hindsight, when people tend to be more open about sex, you have to wonder what was the point of this film, and what was an actor as good as Michael Caine doing in it. Angie Dickinson, another highly paid actress of the era, is also in it, but frankly her death is so badly acted that you could fairly say she deserved this film.
De Palma is a great user of that ""Actually it was all a dream"" device that we're warned to avoid in creative writing classes. So we get two dream sequences -- each with a central shower scene -- which are both flimsy excuses to get the clothes off his leading ladies (Dickinson and Nancy Allen). Despite the partial use of a body-double for Dickinson, these are attractive, gripping scenes, and probably the highlights of the movie.
The less said about the geekish son and the police detective, the better. Allen's redemption from NY hooker to sleep-alone companion (in chintz night attire!) to the son is also less than convincing.",1089676800,3,1570,4.590747330960854
666947,4,6303471390,"DRESSED TO KILL is very much like ""Psycho"" in its opening segments.  Here we meet the lovely Angie Dickinson who feeling sexually unsatisfied engages in a cat and mouse game with a stranger in a museum.  She ends up having wild sex with him in a cab and then off to his apartment for an afternoon of fun.  That fun turns sour however when she finds a doctor's report that is disturbing in itself, and then she forgets her wedding band and so after intending to leave, she goes back up and meets..well...it's just like Janet Leigh in Psycho.  Your heroine is offed in the first thirty minutes.  The killing scene in the elevator is extremely disturbing and brutal, and made even more so in the  unrated version.
DePalma has often been accused or ripping off Hitchcock, but I don't think that's the case.  Always using an imaginative twist as his fulcrum, DePalma gave us some really intense, chilling thrillers, heavy at times on sex and violence, but nonetheless, hypnotic and mesmerizing.
The cast performs adequately, although Caine seems a little disinterested and Dennis Franz plays his crude cop for the hundredth time.  Nancy Allen and Keith Gordon are fine, but Angie really steals the film, even if only briefly.  Without any dialogue, she shows how lonely and ""hungry"" she is while chasing this stud around the museum.  And as with Leigh, one can't help but feel sorry for their untimely demise.
Not one of DePalma's best, but still a deserving thriller.",1087689600,4,1463,4.76984126984127
666948,5,6303471390,"One of my top ten favorite movies along with Carrie also by Depalma. i won't say too much about the story without giving too much away. basically it is about a mother, her son,a hooker,  a psychiatrist, and a woman in sunglasses. These people all get caught up in a murder mystery where all is not as it seems. several scenes will have you leaping from your seat. it is interesting that in this movie and carrie depalma closes with a dream sequence. and both movies have beautiful music as well. Angie Dickenson, Nancy allen, Michael CAine all do a great job here. highly recommended. and i am not kidding that  sometimes when i get on elevators i get a chill thinking about this movie. im sure i am not the only one.",1083974400,5,717,4.383458646616542
666949,3,6303471390,"This is an obscure little film that is both a fraud and a gem. Dressed to Kill is a blatant imitation that rips everything from Hitchcock's Psycho, right down to the final last act of a psychiatrist explaining the serial killer's psychological problems in its mystery stage theatre grass roots sort of way. It is still a wonder why De Palma made this because he really didn't have too and certainly the motivation came from the profit spinners in the higher echelons of the industry who knew they could do it all again and make another buck. The strange thing is that this film manages to still pull off a great twist, even though the viewers has seen this thing one hundred times before - which really makes you feel dumb more than anything else, but you still have to give credit to the fact that De Palma manages to do it to you.
The premise is simple. Woman in black coat and dark sun glasses slashes up a female patient that belongs to Michael Caine and the proceeds to hunt down a witness to the murder who happens to be a prostitute. This has all the flair you will expect from De Palma and his style is all over the place here. However the film is flawed and does not make any sense, especially on repeat viewings, but this does not detract from the fact that there is still lots of trademark De Palma camera shots and suspense work. So it is a little bit like a De Palma movie without the brains, but all the De Palma suspense. If you are still asking ""Well what exactly is a De Palma movie like without the brains but all the suspense?"" then you will probably have to see it to understand what I mean.
Originally this movie was cut but has been restored to its full uncut version. In the opening shower sequence, the following changes were made to avoid an X rating in the USA release. Two close-ups of Kate's fingers caressing her pubic hair were replaced with one shot of her caressing her belly, and the other shot being her breast. Two shots of the man raping Kate, showing the two bodies around the waist moving, were cut. A shot of the man's hand covering Kate's own hand over her pubic area was also cut. These have been restored here. In the scene where Kate is brutally slashed to death with a straight razor by Bobbi in the elevator, the scene was also ""cut"" to meet with the MPAA's requirements. In the original version, there were 2 extreme close-ups showing the razor slashing Kate on her right cheek and then gashing her neck. These shots were substituted with long shots of the killer assaulting Kate and one quick close up of her neck, immediately followed by another long shot, in order to avoid an X rating. These have been restored. In the last scene of the film, where Bobbi slashes Liz's throat with a razor was cut, but also has been restored here. Some of the sexual dialogue had also been changed but is restored here but not entirely. There is still some dialogue that remains cut or changed, but this probably doesn't worry anyone much because the acting at times is quite dismal in this little slasher flick. Overall the cuts have mostly been restored here with a few still missing but this is not really that much of an issue because its not a great film anyway and certainly the restored cuts do not really add anything new accept maybe a tiny bit more sexual and violent content that does not increase or reduce the films impact. With or without the cuts it is still the same vehicle which is not really something you can say about all cut films.
Truth be told, I have seen it more than once and maybe you will too. The only problem is that it is not original and the acting can be more than a little bad even at the best of times. Still an enjoyable old romp in a popcorn fodder sort of way, but that is about it.",1073520000,5,3754,4.356633380884451
666950,5,6303471390,"DRESSED TO KILL (1980) is definetly one of Brian De Palma's masterpieces (the other is CARRIE) for sure! As much as this movie is compared to the great Alfred Hitchcock's best movies (PSYCHO, VERTIGO), this movie also reminds me of Dario Argento's DEEP RED and Mario Bava's BLOOD AND BLACK LACE! The visual style is just awesome with its camerawork, especially in the museum scene and the subway chase! The music by Pino Donnagio (THE HOWLING, TWO EVIL EYES) is perfect and creates the appropriate atmosphere, especially during the elevator scene! But the acting by all involved, especially Michael Caine, Nancy Allen, Angie Dickinson (brilliantly playing against type), Dennis Franz, and Keith Gordon, is truly what makes this film so much fun! A real standout in the slasher wave of 1980!
MGM truly gave us the definitive release of DRESSED TO KILL on DVD! First off, you get the option of watching it in the theatrical version or the UNRATED version, both in 16x9 widescreen and looking fabulous (I saw the unrated version, which is what I always vouch for)! Secondly, there are some great documentaries on the making of this movie, including the way it was censored to earn theatrical release; they even go as far as to compare scenes from the theatrical, unrated and the NETWORK TELEVISION versions! There's also an animated photo gallery with the music from the museum scene in the background and an enlightening advertising gallery. Note that I haven't summarized this movie because DRESSED TO KILL is that good; you simply have to see it for yourself if you haven't seen it already! Make sure you see it unrated, and tell 'em Bobbi sent ya!",1073347200,4,1648,4.868327402135232

I really really liked DTK....it had something more. It feels like atmospere but most likely it's because of the story line. It may feel like a nasty rip-off od PSYCHO but in fact, it's much more. You see, in PSYCHO there is the whole backstory told at the end. But in DTK the story is told little by little until the last scene...

666953,4,6303471390,"The master of the psych-erotic thriller, Brian De Palma, truly came into his own with this provocative piece of filmmaking. He does something unique, however, that sets him apart from other writer/directors, and that is he creates a work of pastiche, lovingly imitating and paying tribute to past masters of the genre, i.e., Hitchcock et al, though stamps his own inimitable signature, enabling anyone viewing the film to know without a shadow of a doubt that it is a Brian De Palma film. De Palma loves mixing dream sequences with reality. He uses this technique to shock, surprise and frighten the audience, and it works every time. In the opening scene of ~Dressed to Kill~, for example, Angie Dickenson is in the shower watching her husband shave through the glass. The eroticism begins slowly, the music is easy listening, lulling us into a sense of relaxation, while Angie starts to reach the inevitable conclusion from her actions, suddenly the woman is attacked from inside the shower, her husband oblivious to her screams for help. This technique pulls us into the film, keeping us on our toes at all times, because we never know what to expect next. Even though I have seen this film several times, this high suspense has not diminished in the slightest, because I still jump from my seat every time the killer appears from the shadows or is seen through the glass in the door.
Michael Caine plays the young psychiatrist, who discovers that one of his patients has been brutally murdered, slashed to death from a razor, and the perpetrator could well be one of his other patients. A beautiful prostitute, (Nancy Allen) witnesses part of the crime and sees the slasher in the mirror of the elevator. She herself becomes a suspect and finds herself followed by the killer. The ending is very clever and quite surprising because, as with all horror films, when you think it's over and can finally sit back and relax, it isn't over al all...
If you haven't had the opportunity to see this picture before, and you're in the mood for some erotic, psycho/slasher fun, by all means do so...and if you've seen it before, see it again, for the years have not lessened its impact in any way. Excellent viewing.",1067126400,2,2209,4.7702349869451695

It certainly proves that though it may be imitation, it certainly is flattering.  For fans of the film this DVD is a must own.",1060473600,,415,4.269230769230769
667054,3,6303471390,"Although dated in it's appearance, ""Dressed to Kill"" is an impressive film and worth owning for lovers of the thriller/suspense genre. It doesn't take long though to figure out who the killer is, but some twists along the way help keep the suspense going.

DVD SUMMARY:
The DVD is quite impressive to say the least.  All three versions of the film are included, plus some featurettes.

667056,5,6303471390,"Brian De Palma's 1980 thriller Dressed To Kill, in my opinion, ranks among his best films. It's a suspenseful murder mystery that plays in Hitchcock's territory. It seems very much like a Hitchcock movie, only with graphic violence and nudity. There are traces of Psycho, Vertigo, Rear Window, Shadow of a Doubt and many others. I'm not sure if De Palma was intentionally referencing Hitchcock or these aspects just came out sort of subconsciously in his script. I don't think that De Palma was ""ripping off"" Hitchcock in any sense with this movie. I don't think it's really possible for anyone to make a movie in the suspense genre nowadays without having some elements of Hitchcock's work come out. There are indeed some close similarities to Psycho, in particular, but I think De Palma is really just paying homage to the master. His earlier film Obsession (1976) paid homage to Vertigo, now with Dressed To Kill, he sets his sights on Psycho.
The film has a good enough story, but the style is really the star here. Everything from the cinematography to the editing to the use of clever, subtle touches (such as Michael Caine looking in the mirror in several scenes). There's the whole museum sequence, brilliantly shot and acted (without dialogue), the elevator murder scene, and a couple of dream sequences. It's incredibly well crafted altogether, but the film is not just an excuse for nice camera work. There's an incredible amount of suspense and terror. There are many wonderful suspenseful scenes, such as the Nancy Allen shower scene at the end. And of course, great performances from Michael Caine, Angie Dickinson, Nancy Allen, and Dennis Franz.
Dressed To Kill is a must-see for anyone who likes Brian De Palma or just likes suspenseful murder mysteries. It's probably one of the best suspense films of the past 20 years. Accordingly, it has a great DVD edition which presents the proper widescreen 2.35:1 aspect ratio and gives the choice of R-rated or unrated versions. Some trims had to be made to the film for theatrical release. The film is pretty much the same (and still great) in either version, but the unrated version is more explicit. There are also some good supplemental materials including a documentary on the making of the film and several shorter featurettes (including comparisons of the R-rated, unrated and network TV versions of the film). Unfortunately, Brian De Palma has not recorded an audio commentary for the film. This is a DVD that can be had pretty [reasonablel priced], so De Palma fans or suspense thriller fans are strongly advised to pick this one up.",1051056000,7,2601,4.913636363636364
667057,3,6303471390,"Now this is DePalma at the top of his game. It's a superb suspence thriller copmbining sex, fear, a transsexual killer, and one of the best actress around-Nancy Allen, who is always awesome and I think is underrated as a actress. DePalma move the story along with suspence and kept me guessing at what would happen next. A interesting film combining hitchcockian techniques, it can be seen as something similar but what I love about DePalma is that he takes something and makes it his own. Anyone that hasn't seen the film- see it. And the extras are informative. A great buy for the fans.",1045958400,2,589,4.619047619047619
667058,4,6303471390,"But I still like it. To condemn Dressed to Kill as a Hitchcock rip-off is to miss the sheer enjoyment of this good horror/thriller movie. It plays out like a suspense film, but there is enough scare factor in to make it a horror film. This isn't for everyone though, especially NOT for Scream fans, because this film is just to intense for them. It's smothered in thickly atmospheric obsessions with sex, dread, paranoia, and voyeurism, not to mention a heavy dose of Psycho-like psychobabble about a wannabe transsexual who's compelled to slash up any attractive female who reminds him--the horror! That he's still very much a man and not a woman. Yes there is a guy wearing womens clothing in this. It's dark, and cool, so I'd get out there and buy this now! WATCH IT ALONE IN THE DARK!",1043280000,,788,4.595744680851064
667059,4,6303471390,"Kate Miller (Angie Dickinson) has an unsatisfactory relationship with her bland husband.  So she needs therapy.  While flirting with her therapist (Michael Caine), he remains (somewhat) true to his ethics and basically tells her to go out and indulge herself.  She then goes to the museum and, while pondering the paintings and patrons, meets a mysterious man and ends up getting a quicky in the backseat of a taxi.  They drive back to his apartment for some more hanky-panky and after he's fallen asleep she leaves the apartment.  While taking the elevator down a razor-wielding hooded psycho woman jumps in and dices her up.
Thus begins the story of De Palma's 1980 thriller.  In an unusual move, the star Angie Dickinson lasts only about 30 minutes.  The rest is about the search for the killer by Kate's teenager-son Peter (Keith Gordon), the police department's Detective Marino (Dennis Franz), and the murder's sole witness, a prostitute named Liz Blake (Nancy Allen).  De Palma created a captivating thriller.  It's full of crude talk, razor-induced gore, sex, and suspense.  Pretty saucy stuff for its time.  It may lack some of its original punch, but it's still effective.
I haven't seen all of De Palma's films, but none of his other films match the style in this one.  His use of building scenes together visually with windows, mirrors, binoculars, cameras, and glass doors is nowhere more evident than this film.  Everything is about visual perception here and he's a master of the camera.
Concerning the DVD.  While the picture looks great, with good colors and crisp detail, there remains remnants of scratches from the film transfer.  The sound is good and the movie has a good score.  The extras are above average with a nice informative documentary.  There is an option to watch the movie in R-rated or un-rated mode.  Choose the un-rated.  The R-rated is a bit cheesy and nowhere as effective.
Must-have for De Palma fans.  Definately worth renting for everyone else.",1038960000,3,1986,4.960606060606061
667060,4,6303471390,"The year is 1980.  Your name is Brian DePalma.  You've already directed at least one great film under your belt (1976's ""Carrie"").  Now, you're inspired to create a film called ""Psycho.""  The problem?  It had already been done 20 years ago.  So, what's a director to do?  Make ""Dressed to Kill.""  The similarities between this film and Hitchcock's 1960 masterpiece are so striking that you'd think the estate of Hitch would be dialing their lawyers for plagarism.  But for all that's derivative, ""Dressed to Kill"" is a stylishly crafted thriller that plays like an honest tribute instead of a cheap rip-off.  Angie Dickinson is a well-to-do Manhattan mother who's stuck in an unfulfilling relationship, has a good-hearted teenage son (Keith Gordon) and vents her frustrations at her therapist (Michael Caine).  Meanwhile, a graphic murder takes place, and the only witness is a call girl (Nancy Allen, then DePalma's wife) who gets caught in a tangled mess as she tries to identify the killer.  That's as much as I can say without revealing spoilers, but I will mention that ""Dressed to Kill,"" even after 20-plus years, holds up respectably as a decent thriller.  Pino Donaggio's Herrmann-esque music underscores the film's dramatic tension, while many Hitchcockian elements and references surface.  DePalma was hardly a feminist's darling, and the film's viewpoint of women (they're either hookers or victims here), may turn off some and reinforce his long-standing reputation as a misogynist (in one of the documentaries, DePalma addresses these charges).  This DVD contains both the theatrical version as well as the unrated version; needless to say the latter is much more graphic.  While we don't get a commentary, we do get a few retrospective documentaries with interviews from the whole cast of main characters (except for Caine).  At such a reasonable pricetag, ""Dressed to Kill"" is a solid value for those who want a snapshot of the best of DePalma's work.",1036540800,,1966,5.132075471698113

667062,5,6303471390,"Director Brian DePalma really hit it in some of his films that were a homage to the late Alfred Hitchcock.  This is one of them.  For those of us really missing Hitchcock, this film was a welcome breath of thriller fresh air.  While employing a more flamboyant style than Hitchcock and at times straying ""over the top,"" DePalma nevertheless solidly holds his own in delivering a screen thriller.  I've seen it several times and always enjoyed it. Who is murdering women is the question?  And who will he murder in this film?

We start off with Angie Dickinson as the killer's target and that entire sequence is bravura film making of the most exuberant order.  Then we segue into examining Dickinson's psychiatrist, played by Michael Caine, through the sleuthing of Nancy Allen and Dickinson's son.  If you want to compare this film to a Hitchcock film, I think it most resembles ""Frenzy"" about the London necktie murderer of women.  I also really like ""Blow Out"" which I see ... is selling in tandem with this one as a special.  You would do well to get both.  You will be hugely entertained.

(USA - 1980)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

Brian De Palma's superb thriller borrows the plot structure of PSYCHO (1960) to tell a completely original story in a manner which Hitchcock would surely have admired. The 'Pure Cinema' approach deployed here also evokes the best work of Dario Argento, though De Palma clearly has his own agenda. His script attends the fall-out from a terrifying attack on a frustrated housewife (Angie Dickinson) by a razor-wielding maniac who then turns his/her attentions to the sole witness, a streetwise hooker (Nancy Allen) who teams up with Dickinson's teenage son (Keith Gordon) when she becomes a suspect in the case.

A masterful example of visual storytelling, DRESSED TO KILL employs constantly roving camerawork to propel complex characters through a series of bravura set-pieces (the museum, the elevator, the subway, etc.), filmed in breathtaking Panavision by the late cinematographer Ralf Bode. At a time when most current scope movies are designed primarily for TV - which rather defeats the whole purpose of scope photography! - it's a revelation to see the entire width of the 2.39:1 frame being used to define characters and advance the plot through an accumulation of visual tricks and counterpoints. Pino Donaggio's memorable score provides an often thunderous accompaniment to the on-screen horrors, and it's refreshing to find a grown-up cast (including a restrained Michael Caine) making the most of a scenario which addresses mature themes in an intelligent manner. This intense thriller refuses to sacrifice integrity for the sake of cheap shocks, but it still manages to scale the dizzying heights of genuine horror.

De Palma and the film's principal contributors charted the film's production in a number of documentary extras included on the original US DVD edition, and while some of their comments may have seemed a little too self-congratulatory at the time, they also provided fascinating insights into De Palma's working methods and the motivation behind some of the devices employed by the director to tell his story. In a special section detailing his collision with the MPAA, De Palma wearily defends the film from charges of misogyny and explicit violence, and his views are supported by the likes of Angie Dickinson, amongst others. Besides, anyone who thinks THIS is misogynist obviously hasn't seen the likes of THE NEW YORK RIPPER (1982), RED TO KILL (1994), or some of the more squalid dregs from the Japanese sex-and-torture subgenre. Now THERE'S misogyny for you!!",1002067200,33,2590,5.291970802919708

The movie is obviously the work of a film maker brimming with ideas (most of them visual) who loves to make movies.  MGM does the movie proud with an excellent DVD loaded with genuinely interesting features.  I especially liked seeing all the various ""Dressed to Kill"" movie posters used around the world to promote the movie.  To conclude on a slightly downer note, one could quibble that a better print of the film should have been used to produce this DVD, as minor flaws and scratches occasionally pop up, including one nasty slash across the image during the museum sequence. But as the print is not ridiculously bad, I don't think a letter-writing campaign or anything of that nature is in order.

Liz, having seemingly escaped Bobbie the transexual killer, finds ""her"" once more shadowing her(Liz's) apartment. A head shot of the two women looking at some pointless street noise shows us Liz visually doubling the killer in a manner impossible to see in standard formats, which clearly evokes the underlying point to this giggly and jittery movie. The making of documentary, though entertaining, does not give us a forthright Mr Depalma discussing what he wished to convey in this work's strict structural symetries and various inter-echoes.

A sexually frustrated housewife is seeing a psychiatrist and is murdered after a one-night stand with a stranger.  Her prodigy son and a knowing prostitute join forces in order to find the murderer.
With the possible exception of ""Carrie,"" ""Dressed To Kill"" is Brian DePalma's greatest thriller.  ""Dressed To Kill"" is a truly dazzling and fast-paced murder mystery.  DePalma cleverly borrows from his own super-thriller ""Sisters"" and Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho.""  He also makes excellent use of a great cast.  Michael Caine gives an outstanding performance as a doctor with his own share of problems.  Angie Dickinson perhaps gives the finest performance of her career.  Dickinson is one of cinema's more underrated beauties and I am only sorry that she never became a superstar.  DePalma also deserves praise for an excellent screenplay; the dialogue between the characters is utterly realistic and convincing.  After ""DTK,"" Brian DePalma hasn't made one fully satisfying film.  DePalma used to have a unique talent for not only scaring but also morally troubling his viewers.  In such films as ""Carrie"" and ""DTK,"" he forces his audience to deeply empathize with the intense torment and anguish of the characters on the screen.  In recent years, DePalma has sadly lost this special gift.

667275,5,6303471390,"Love it or hate it Brian DePalma's DRESSED TO KILL has proven to be one of the first classics of the modern suspense genre, the sexual thriller. Although it owes much to Hitchcock's PSYCHO, DRESSED TO KILL turns up the volume for the modern audience, taking an unflinching view of murder and perversion that many film goers simply were not prepared for at the time.
Released in 1980, D2K, shocked just about everyone who saw it. The stylized direction and brilliant editing made it one of the most effective thrillers to come out of Hollywood ever. The first murder in the film was so horrific it earned the film an X-rating and gave director DePalma an undeserved reputation as a misogynistic exploitation film maker. There were actual protests in the streets over the film.
Viewers of this new DVD version are treated not only to a beautifully mastered release of the film, but enough background information (in the form of behind the scenes documentaries, with interviews of all the key creators) that one can truly appreciate D2K as the ground braking classic it is. There's even a shot by shot comparison of the X-rated version vs the R-rated.
If you've never seen the film, you must and judge for yourself. If it's an old favorite the DVD will really give you something to sink your teeth into. While many DVD extras turn out to be little more than filler the extras here fully compliment the movie and taken as a whole The Dressed To Kill Special Edition actually is special.",999388800,5,1482,4.703846153846154

It was great. If you love scary or suspensful movies this is a must see. Yeah, it may be dated as far as clothes and hairstyles, but so what? If it's well written and acted it's worth watching, and this film definately is.
This is one of Brian DePalma's best films, next to ""Carrie"" and ""Sisters"". It was completely unpredictable and frightening.
The story concerns a middle aged woman(Angie Dickinson, in her best film), unhappily married to a man who ""stinks in bed"". She sees a psychiatrist(Michael Caine) to deal with her passionless marriage. Sexually frustrated, she decides to have an affair, which leads to a horrifying discovery AND THEN an unexpected, gruesome surprise for her. Nancy Allen plays a high priced call girl who witnesses ""a tall, blonde woman wearing dark glasses"" in the aftermath of a murder and Keith Gordon plays Angie Dickinson's son who, in cahoots with Nancy Allen's character sets about discovering the identity of ""the blonde woman"" before Nancy Allen's character is charged with the murder.

Director Brian De Palma employs the entire screen to tell his lurid, scary, and often amusing tale of sex and slashers in Manhattan, using many almost subliminal images of menace as well as some humorous sight gags that were completely lost in the pan and scan version. Thus viewing this movie in wide-screen is essential for getting the full effect of a visually dazzling thriller, especially during the museum and subway cat-and-mouse sequences, several split-screen moments, the final restaurant scene, and, of course, the infamous elevator ride (DTK does for elevators what 'Psycho' did for showers).

This movie embodies all the elements of a great thriller ... * A taut script * Well Developed Characters * Hard hitting acting. The story begins with Angie Dickinson, a bored housewife largely unsatisfied with her husband who yearns for more. On one of her visits to the museum she befriends a strange man and has an affair with him. She enjoys her time spent with the stranger realising how much she was missing when she is with her husband and on one such occassion while returning home she is brutally murdered in an elevator. A young lady (Nancy Allen) catches a glimpse of the murderer and she initially becomes a suspect and later a prime witness. Giving away any more of the story would be a crime as the several twists and turns this movie takes are what make it so engrossing. A tad slow moving at times the movie picks up the pace almost immediately before the viewer realises with some finely nuanced performances by Michael Caine,Angie Dickinson,Nancy Allen and Dennis Franz among others. The suspense is maintained throughout the film and makes you want to watch it again and again.

A prostitute (Nancy Allen)sees  the woman dying and as result starts to track down the killer with the help of the victim's son only to be then pursued by the killer also. The film features great performances in particular from Michael Caine who plays the psychiatrist of the victim and from Angie Dickinson who though does not talk in the majority of the time she is in the film manages to convey a mix of emotions in a subtle and affecting way. It also features great camera work from DePalma who is able to use the camera to create a lot of suspense by use of double screens, close-ups and slow motion. The film is not concerned with the details of the story, it only cares about affecting you right down to your gut. It succeeds brilliantly! The ending is not a huge surprise but it's not a letdown.

667304,2,6303471390,"Due to the many reviews I read about this film, I had very high hopes. Maybe that is why I was so disappointed. From the pointless pornographic opening scene, I began to realize that maybe I had made a mistake. Another fifteen minutes in, I was sure of it. Finally, 25 minutes in, the movie provided it's first suspenseful and important scene. The annoying porn had ended and a truly shocking and suspenseful scene took place. The next hour wasn't so bad, a definite improvement over the opening 30 mins. There were some scenes of suspense and some great directing techniques, such as the split screen, which was done with some style. I thought maybe the film wasn't so bad after all. Than, the killer was revealed. The box promised a truly shocking revelation, so my disappointment was evident. I knew the killer when he was first introduced and I'm sure most people feel the same way. It was a nice conclusion, but too obvious. WAY TOO OBVIOUS. Instead of shock, I just mumbled ""I knew it"". Maybe, just maybe, if the film ended there, after the motive was explained, it would have been given one more star. But the film just kept going on and on. The killer was revealed, his motive was explained, so why continue? It was very pointless, because it just wasn't needed. The story was over. Why bore the audience for another 11 minutes? This film has many flaws, true, but one thing I like is the director's style. It was unique, but often annoying. Overall, the film wasn't bad, but very predictable and too long.

667305,5,6303471390,"Everytime I see another DePalma atrocity and am tempted to write him off  completely, I have to remind myself that he directed DRESSED TO KILL in  1980.  This film is such a wonderful grab-bag of things lyrical, ecstatic,  kitsch, obscene, comic, puerile, and surreal, not to mention that it fuses  so much cinematic grammar into one long piece of sustained music.  Not to  downplay DePalma's expertise at montage, but much of this film's tension  and charisma come from Venetian Pino Donaggio's score - driving, pulsing,  lush and always over the top (inarguably the composer's best moment  alongside his score for ""Don't Look Now"" in 1973).
Contributing  to this waltz of mayhem is Nancy Allen and Dennis Franz' in-your-face  repartee, the Hardy Boys bond between Allen and Gordon, and moreover, Angie  Dickinson's  sublime portrayal of a middle-aged woman looking for that one  good sexual release, only to be mocked horribly, then wasted by a sinister  cross-dresser(!).  Film and film culture exist within our bigger, even  cosmic, politic, and it's fitting that DRESSED TO KILL - in the summer of  1980 - blended techno-phobia (Dickinson's dismissal of her son's computer  named 'Peter' right before she goes out looking for some good extramarital  sex), a p.o.'d transexual, and the spectre of killer STDs coming back to  haunt, then kill the leading lady!  Mind you this was all on the eve of the  computer explosion while HIV was secretly spinning its lethal web in urban  areas, and Reaganitis was everywhere.
One must mention the film's  humor, dark and ofttimes adolescent as it is (with dialogue like  ""Don't make me be a bad girl"" delivered by a cross-dresser).  As  Dickinson lolls about in the museum, cruising a handsome stranger straight  out of an Armani ad circa 1980, she is confronted with a wallsized canvas  of a gorilla, also lolling about and staring back at her. Then she  scribbles ""banana"" on her list of Things to Do (ha!), and in  three beats, she's winding her way back and forth through the museum on the  tail of that cute phallic object wearing Armani! Moreover, we get to be  cine-sadists as the music AND the stranger toy with her emotions (will she  get picked up or just toyed with and humiliated?). Donnagio's music leads  us through all of her hopes and fears as the Steadicam tracks her through  room after room of paintings in search of Mr. Right.  It's a wonderful,  naughty sequence, with another wicked piece of lyrical business ready to  follow when she finally makes it to her new lover's two-toned Manhattan  budoir.
What's truly Hitchcockian is how DePalma places most of the  villains in the garb of caretakers: psychiatrists and nurses morph into  highly eroticized killing machines; cops have a view of human nature so  jaundiced one wonders why they bother to save anyone; and matronly moms  just want a good afternoon of sex between designer sheets.  Amidst it all,  only a stock-market savvy prostitute hanging out with an asexual  techno-snoop (who weeps over his dead mother for, like, five minutes,  max!!) can save the day! What a fitting comic, capsule of the Reagan-Era  Spirit that was to come!
DRESSED TO KILL is a giddy, sinister, utterly  delightful brew of cinematic hocus-pocus that never loses it magic,  especially on widescreen.  One wishes DePalma could hit this stride again.  Follow-ups like BODY DOUBLE and RAISING CAIN are only echoes of this  pop-trash masterwork.  Crank up the soundtrack and enjoy these 90 minutes  of gothic dementia.
And heed dePalma's wacky warning: Don't ever get in  the way of anyone who wants their own pair of high heels; they might get  medieval on you.",968889600,3,3658,4.938943894389439

Many criticize De Palma for this, but I think he did a pretty good  job!  The elevator scene is so incredibly creepy that it gives me chills  just thinking about it.  Bobbi is one of the most unique (and scariest)  killers ever in movie history.  This is not a slasher film, if that is what  you are expecting.  If you liked ""Psycho"", then you'll love this.

667307,5,6303471390,"Brian De Palma is a director praised for his visual style and originality.  Unfortunately, his style rarely has had the chance to mix with a great script (the major exception is The Untouchables).  He's been on a slump  recently, as he just came out with the critically drubbed Mission to Mars  and the absolutely atrocious Snake Eyes.  Though if one wants to see  exactly how fine a director he is, you should check out his films in the  80's, which was definitely the time of his heyday.  De Palma is particlarly  good at crafting suspense, as I noticed when I watched Body Double, his  last erotic thriller.  That was a seriously underrated film and it made me  want to watch some more of his suspense/thrillers.  Dressed to Kill seem to  have the most resemblance to Body Double so I chose to watch that film.  Now, I didn't think Dressed to Kill could possibly match Body Double's  suspense but to my surprise, Dressed to Kill is just as great a film, as  it's suspense is, to some regard, even more unnerving.
The film begins  surrealistically as we see a woman taking a shower.  She runs her hands  over body sensuously and the expression on her face is obviously one of  pleasure.  The score that runs in the background at the time is a pleasant  one, but this sensuous bubble is burst when a man steps behind this woman,  grabs her, and begins to rape her in the shower, and the scene makes a  sudden change as we see a man having sex with the same woman on a bed.  We  find out the woman's name is Kate Miller (Angie Dickinson) and that she has  marital troubles.  She sees a psychiatrist named Dr. Elliott (Michael  Caine) about these problems.  In a session early in the film, she tells him  that she no longer enjoys sex with her husband.  Afterward, she goes to an  art museum where she meets a man she feels attracted to. In true De Palma  fashion, the camera pans around the entire museum as we see Kate playing a  game of cat-and-mouse with this man.  When Kate believes she's lost him,  the man appears in a taxi, and Kate enters inside, to which they then have  a sexual tryst inside.  Later, she awakens inside his apartment, apparently  having the spent the whole afternoon with this stranger.  As she is putting  her clothing back on (the stranger is asleep) she finds a health report  inside a drawer stating that he has contracted a venereal disease.  Shocked  and scared, Kate leaves the apartment and heads for the elevator.  In what  is one of the film's most suspenseful and shocking sequences, Kate realizes  she has left her wedding ring in the apartment and heads up through the  elevator again.  As the door opens, a blonde woman with a razor creeps in  and slashes her to death.  It's a shocking scene as the audience begins to  believe that Kate is the film's protagonist, until she is killed just a  half hour into the film.  Her murder is witnessed by a prostitute named Liz  Blake (Nancy Allen) and her life is now in obvious danger from this blonde  woman known only as Bobbi.  With the help of Kate's brilliant son Peter  (Keith Gordon), Liz attempts to find the killer and her identity.
After a  slow first 25 minutes, Dressed to Kill is filled with unbearable suspense  for the next 75 minutes.  The last 3 minutes of the film are particularly  nerve wracking.  There are so many great suspense sequences that work  throughout the entire film, all the way from the elevator scene to a chase  into the subway.  Those scenes should give any viewer a good scare.  It's  certainly what one would describe as edge-of-your seat suspense.  I know  those sequences freaked me out, and those last few minutes in the film is a  true heart-pounding nerve jangler.  This is what De Palma is good at and  he should make more films like this.
The film's acting is also quite  good.  The film's main protagonists, played by Nancy Allen and Keith  Gordon, are likeable characters and there's a certain romantic tension that  develops between them.  The chemistry between both characters works well.  Michael Caine also delivers a good performance as the psychiatrist who  begins to suspece a patient of his as the murderer.  Fun to watch is an  early role for Dennis Franz as the detective on the case.  Angie Dickinson,  though only in the film for a short time, develops her character into a  sympathetic one, despite her adulterous behavior.
From the plot  description above, it may seem like the film has a lot of nudity, and in  truth, there is.  But it never gets too explicit and it's place in the film  is appropriate and it works well.  Is this an erotic thriller?  Well, it is  somewhat like one but it doesn't really rely on a lot of sex to maintain  the viewer's attention (there's really only one sex scene in the movie)  such as a movie like Basic Instinct.  Instead, the film is more of a  psychological thriller, as it relies more on suggestion than explicit  detail to scare the viewer.
Is Dressed to Kill De Palma's best  suspense/thriller?  Well, it's at the very least as good as Body Double.  Both films have certain similarities and similar tones.  There are certain  aspects that work better in one film than another.  For one example, the  sex and nudity in Body Double does get a little gratuitous and sleazy in  the second half (There's even nudity in the closing credits) while it never  gets that way in Dressed to Kill.  Body Double has a more ominous and  creepy musical score and a very interesting protagonist (that's not to say  the protagonists of Dressed to Kill aren't interesting because they are).  Double's plot twists are also extremely unpredictable while one of Dressed  to Kill's twists becomes obvious at least half way through the film (though  I didn't think that hurt the movie).  But it's really not fair to compare  those two.  They're separate films and should be considered on what each  has to offer.
I would very much highly recommend you watch both movies,  definitely late at night and with no more than one other person.",959212800,20,6001,4.592205323193916

The only drawback to the VHS edition is the presentation in  pan and scan rather than widescreen -- this is the ONLY reason I did not  give this video 5 stars.",954288000,2,604,4.766990291262136
