8364361,2,B002CRTKSC,"A few years back when I first started studying about trading, I took this course. At the time, I was very impressed. It all seemed so complex and esoteric. But, by golly, she got the ball rolling with me to get engaged about learning about options trading. Now, years later, I have worked very hard on getting educated about trading, and have finally learned to trade. Don't let anyone tell you that trading is easy. It takes a lot of time and work to learn.
  Okay, so what do I think about this course? Recently, I went back and listened to this. Wow, I would never trade like this course describes. It's only my opinion, but I find some of the information to be misleading, naive, and downright irresponsible to teach people. There are so many nuances about options that can blow up somebody's account in a minute. This is only my opinion, but if you want to trade options, please go find some good education, and make sure you know what you're doing. Really, Please!",1391904000,2,970,4.505681818181818
8364362,5,B002CRTKSC,"I think Darlene Nelson Powell is the end all in options, as a teacher and as aspiration.  I've never been able to duplicate her huge wins, her clever strategies, but if you want a thrill, watch all of her tapes on the QQQ's and L.E.A.Ps.  I guarantee you'll love the experience.  And I watched her tapes early in my training,so perhaps I could go back now and replicate some of her trades, but I just love this woman's approach, her cheerful and intelligent teachings.",1357603200,3,468,4.5476190476190474
