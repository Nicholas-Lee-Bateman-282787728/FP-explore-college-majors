8447327,5,B004XQO8IC,"This is a sensitive drama about two children played by Robert Young and Margaret Perry who rebel against the conservative values of their parents.  The son wants to move to Paris to become a painter, instead of helping with the family business of designing wallpaper, and the daughter has an affair with a married man whose wife does not let him go. The conservative parents worry about the rebellious nature of their kids, and eventually the father (Lewis Stone) dies and then the son goes to Paris. At the end the mother also dies and the daughter gets to marry her man after his divorce. This is not an unusual story for pre-code era since much more controversial movies were made at that time. The story also takes a crack at the lives of rich and famous at the height of Great Depression. Hollywood made many successful movies in this regard well after the William Hays (Czar of motion pictures) office came into existence to rehabilitate Hollywood's image. It is very touching to see the passing of their father and the mother, and the kids move on with their lives.

John Druten brought his book, ""After All"" to the screen with a new title called ""New morals for the old."" This is beautifully directed by Charles Brabin and is well supported by Robert Young, Myrna Loy, Lewis Stone, Jean Hersholt and Donald Cook. Producer Irving Thalberg invited celebrated playwrights from the other side of the Atlantic when the MGM's money machine starting pouring in dollars for his futuristic projects. This is one of the less successful movies of 1932 compared to other MGM's box office hits that year, which included ""Grand Hotel,"" ""Tarzan and the ape man,"" ""Red dust,"" ""Red headed woman,"" ""Rasputin and the emperor."" MGM made a total of 34 movies in 1932 but this movie did modestly.

8447328,4,B004XQO8IC,"An older film in style, but not old in viewpoint. I ran New Morals For Old several times -- each time the film became more and more alive. A worthwhile experience full of hope and a realistic attitude regarding love. Romantic, familial and self.",1389225600,,245,4.590909090909091
8447329,3,B004XQO8IC,"This is a very ordinary precode involving the wealthy Thomases. The parents (Lewis Stone and Laura Hope Crews) are worried about their two grown children. Son Ralph (Robert Young) as well as daughter Phyl (Margaret Perry) are taken to partying every night and sleeping until noon. Ralph's individual demon is that he fancies himself more than a designer of wallpaper at the family business - he wants to go to France and become a great artist. Phyl's problem is that she is in love with a married man (David Newell as Duf) whose wife won't let him go. Both kids wind up doing what they want to do in spite of their parents' objections. Ralph does go to France to study art. Phyl sets up house with Duf with no hope of marriage in sight. So far this is an extraordinarily ordinary precode. So what makes it worthwhile? For one, one kid winds up with their hopes dashed the other gets their wish. Which one triumphs and which one does not and how this happens is the unexpected part. Also very interesting is a tryst Ralph has with a French neighbor when he is in Paris. That neighbor happens to be played by Myrna Loy and the nature of the tryst is what is so unexpected. In one scene she is complaining about the noise Ralph is making. In the next scene it is the next morning and she and Ralph are bouncing around in their pajamas! What's more we never see the French girl again in Ralph's life. How realistic that not every sexual encounter leads to either tragedy or the altar, which is something that would never be allowed in the production code era.

The ending is warm although abrupt as the kids grow a few years older and seem to be gradually becoming their parents. Plus both kids grow a genuine appreciation for Aunty Doe (Elizabeth Patterson), someone they ridiculed just a few years before as silly and out of touch.

This one is an OK time passer, but there really is nothing out of the ordinary to distinguish it from other precodes of the era other than the chance to see two stars just starting out - Myrna Loy and Robert Young - and one star of the stage making a rare film appearance - Margaret Perry.

The DVD transfer looks very good. It looks better than I've ever seen it on Turner Classic Movies. The audio is also very crisp and clear.",1368230400,,2260,4.414868105515588
