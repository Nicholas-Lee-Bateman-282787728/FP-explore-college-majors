8383050,3,B002WG8U02,"Bought this at Wal-You know what store, for five bucks, and I've bought bad stuff before, but this one is put together with cut short films and documentaries variously, except for some of the movies and documentaries, which outshine all the screw ups for the rest of the double sided two disc set.  High compresssion beyond acceptible on some those, along with those that did not have an ending.  Go for broke is missing the last fourth of the movie, I Gung Ho is missing that last fourth too, so highly pixelated, and really un-american to treat that movie this way but somebody didn't care(Gung Ho is THE benchmark for WW2 made pro american movies), some documentaries as well bad and cut short, but not most of what I've viewed.
Here are some great points, I decided to give a whopping three stars, I would have gone 2.5 starts, but here it is, I was impressed with ""Hell in Normandy"", a foreign film from Italy using alot of real WW2 german weapons, likely uniforms too, a kubelwagon car, and what looked like real Normandy concrete bunkers, a real bang up good job, not a great movie, but one with a good plot and okay and never seen before, I go for authenticity. I've watcehd Nuramberg trials, very good, never seen it before, even seen the executed bodies of the condemned Nazi mass murderers.  Such like battle of new britain, battle for Tarawa pull this up from put out garbage to okay cause it had a few good ones.  Haven't viewed all of them, sure there are some bummers of incompletes and over compressed, just make sure not to spend a fortune, there are some gems in here.  I, like the other poster, first made a real damning review for this especially since Go for Broke was incomplete, oh well, its coming in the mail on a 50 combat classics set complete I hope, so I made sure to review more of the documentaries.
I don't know why a company like pacific entertainment would put out product with incomplete material here and there, this has scared me from purchasing anything else outright for awhile made by them, but I'll maybe do it with some of their titles I see if I want to take a gamble on half of the 25's being complete or viewable.  By the way, this had Desert Victory, but very badly over compressed, a ww2 North African documentary, but I have a much better copy on ""6 Films World War II Collectors Set"", a set I used to say also had alot of overcompression, but nothing compared to some on this set.  Some aren't over compressed or over pixelated on this 25 movie/documentary set at all. I'll grudgingly say this set was worth about five bucks, but if these were not all screwed up, pacific entertainment could have commanded about ten bucks for this set, maybe more, some of the documentaries are ww2 grade color and not colorized, like battle for tarawa.",1302652800,3,2786,4.5049504950495045
8383051,1,B002WG8U02,Movies are cut short.  No endings.  There is no way all of these movies can be on the disks.  Couldn't see the end of them.  Waste.,1293840000,,131,3.923076923076923
