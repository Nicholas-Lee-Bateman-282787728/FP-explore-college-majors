1400968,3,B000056VOZ,"This movie was not a box office hit when it was released just a few months ago, but dreams do sometimes come true.
Starting in New Jersey in 1968, we follow the lives of four 'has-been' gangsters.  Now retired and living peaceably in The Raj Mahal in Miami Beach, they attempt to make one last heist.  So as not to be evicted (who wants to be homeless?) from this run-down hotel, they plot a way to save their special home.  Look for the pink ostrich.
Burt Reynolds looks good as an old man and is funny like in those 'Bandit' movies.  Richard Dreyfuss who won an Academy Award for his role in THE GOODBYE GIRL and was great in MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS (I loved that music!) showed his winning style.  Seymour Cassel who was in Bill Murray's RUSHMORE and Dan Hedaya (Detective Jack in SHAFT), round out the foursome.
When you need a laugh, rent this one from the local video store (better yet, buy it here at Amazon.com), sit back and enjoy.  If you liked GRUMPY OLD MEN, you'll love these ""grandfatherly gangsters"" who are not quite 'over the hill' yet.  Stephen Iervolino compared this film ro 'GoodFellas' in LAUNCH.  This parody is better than either or both/and in a class all its own.",1084147200,5,1184,4.474418604651163
1400969,4,B000056VOZ,Just sit back and enjoy this flick. It's not going to win any awards but it is good lighthearted fun.,1075075200,3,101,4.1
1400970,3,B000056VOZ,"and thats why it gets three stars,for entertaining without being foul-mouthed or violent. I mean, I love violent, foul-mouthed movies as much as the next guy or gal, but rarely do you see a movie marketed to adults as mild as this. Its as toothless as some of its extras. The only prurient element in the movie is Jennifer Tilly's stripper character, who is busting (oh, look, I made a pun) out of a sequined bikini most of the movie. Aging mobsters try to feel young again by making some trouble. Fugheddaboutit if you don't have a family, but rent it for your own crew if you have one.",1019001600,,587,4.394495412844036
1400971,3,B000056VOZ,"Very lightweight comedy ""The Crew"" was about four ex-gangsters now living in Miami, where they try to scheme with a shotgun like old days; only this time for escaping eviction notice.  And it worked ... at first.
The good part of the film is its male cast (Dreyfuss, Hedaya, Reynolds, Cassel: plus good female players, especially ""The Matrix""'s Moss, who again gives a toe kick to her ex-boyfriend  (short scene, don't miss it).  To be honest, the story is weak, and the script tends to lose its focus, but just watching these guys and ladies almost compensates.  The film gradually improves as it goes on, so wait for a while until Dreyfuss's slightly annoying narration vanishes.  The film is co-produced by Barry Sonnenfeld (of ""MIB""), so if he had directed, the result might have been different.
By the way, of the four gangsters, Dreyfuss is the youngest (b. 1947); next, Hedaya (b. 1940); Reynolds (b. 1936), and Cassel (b. 1935).",1010966400,2,936,4.825
1400972,5,B000056VOZ,"""The Crew"" is comprised of Richard Dreyfuss (Bobby), the brains of the outfit, Burt Reynolds (Bats), the hot-tempered muscle, Seymour Cassel (Mouth), the quiet ladies man and Dan Hedaya, who plays ""The Brick.""  He's not stupid but, as Dan says in his interview segment, ""I guess his thought process is a little different from most people.""  The movie starts out with a flashback of them as four young wiseguys pulling a job, then flashes forward to them as four old men sitting on a porch.  Bat turns to Bobby and complains, ""You said the good times were gonna last forever.""  Bobby replies, ""I thought we'd be dead by now!""  The story concerns them trying to save their rundown, Miami Beach apartment house (the Raj Mahal) from going condo.  Each of their schemes backfires and gets them further into trouble with the local drug lord and the police.  The plot twists hold one's interest throughout the film, but the quirky lead characters really carry this picture.  ""The Crew"" is a movie that proves that Mafioso are people too!",1004400000,14,1030,4.779661016949152
1400973,4,B000056VOZ,"From some of the reviews I've read, you'd think that Barry Sonnenberg was expecting The Crew to compete for an Oscar. The lack of special effects and stretches of credibility should be the tipoff, folks. This was strictly a fun ""throw in a little schtick and some sight gags and keep the actors busy while awaiting their next serious role"" kind of film. Hell, the explosives and ammo budget probably could have been handled out of petty cash.
Even Beethoven wrote a few pieces that he called ""bagatelles"" on occasion. This flick is very good for its genre. In the category of lighthearted, low-budget comedy it excelled. And I'll bet ten dollars to your Aunt Minnie's used teabag that that's all it was meant to do!
Richard Dreyfuss, and Burt Reynolds were clearly on cruise control for this picture. It also says much for their talents that they could turn out a quality performance while coasting along. Dan Hedaya and Miguel Sandoval did their usual great character bits. Seymour Cassel was a new face to me, which just goes to show that I don't spend all of my spare time watching the tube (i.e., I got a life.) It even kept my father chuckling throughout the whole show. This is a pretty good accomplishment for a man 75 years old who tends to nod off now and again. All in all, a good bet if you want to kick back and have a few laughs between life's little booby traps.",996883200,3,1376,4.508
1400974,5,B000056VOZ,"I think this is a real come back for both Dreyfuss, and Reynolds. Hands down this is one of the best comady's of the year. I'll just say it's a must see movie...",990921600,,161,3.909090909090909
1400975,3,B000056VOZ,"""The Crew"" is a comedy that attempts to be ""Goodfellas"" plus forty years.  Four aging wiseguys have retired to Florida and they spend most of their time reminiscing about the glory days.  Eager for some action, they cook up a number of bumbling schemes that make them feel like they are back in the rackets.  The screenplay is mildly droll, but lacks anything that might be considered hilarious.  It is a bit more entertaining if you happen to have grown up in any metro New York Italian neighborhood, since the actors do a good job of capturing the colloquialisms and attitudes one might have found there.
The film has a TV feel about it, which is not surprising given the fact that the writer is Barry Fanaro (""Benson"", ""Golden Girls"", ""Archie Bunker's Place"") and the director is Michael Dinner (""The Wonder Years"", ""Chicago Hope"", ""The Street"").  Also working against the premise is the fact that we have been inundated with Mafia humor (""Analyze This"", ""Mickey Blue Eyes"", etc.) lately and the novelty is wearing off.
The acting is okay, but not great.  Richard Dreyfuss is reasonably good as the narrator and leader of the motley crew.  Dan Hedaya and Seymour Cassell are also wryly humorous as his henchmen.  Burt Reynolds is probably the weak link here.  Carrie-Anne Moss has a minor role that doesn't give us much by which to judge her talents.  The best performance is probably by Jennifer Tilly, who plays her standard airhead sex-bomb character, which says a lot about the general mediocrity of the film.
This occasionally amusing dark comedy has a veteran cast but fails to elevate itself above sitcom class humor.  I rated it 5/10.  Add a point or two if you like mob humor or grew up in New Jersey in the sixties.",986688000,3,1728,4.723333333333334
1400976,5,B000056VOZ,"This is a very amusing film about four mobsters who end up in a Florida retirement home but find it boring so they set out to find jobs, fun and women.  It is very slapstick at times, often rude, sometimes violent but always funny.  Dreyfuss is great as the Hit-Man with a heart who watches his now grown daughter from afar as she strives to make it as a cop in the big bad world and Burt Reynolds is a hoot as the man who is always having to be resuscitated after nearly drowning, one time in a toilet, courtesy of Dreyfuss.  It is slow moving film at first but it picks up its pace fairly quickly and you will laugh and chortle at all the ridiculous capers the four men get up to, including driving a South American Drug Lord nuts as they accidentally get in his way whilst he is trying to organize a big delivery of Class A drugs.  The final action scene is hilarious when Dreyfuss and two of his companions call in their old Wise-Guy comrades who have all retired (one is even in a wheelchair and on oxygen!) to go to the rescue of their fourth friend, along with Dreyfus's daughter, his girlfriend and her stepmother.  Well worth watching despite what other critics say to the contrary!",982713600,10,1191,4.322869955156951
1400977,2,B000056VOZ,"I didn't think so much about this movie.  I thought it was going to be such a stupid excuse for a movie.  But it actually turned out to be one that I enjoyed.  Richard Dreyfuss heads an all-star cast along with Seymour Cassell, Dan Hedeya, Burt Reynolds, and Carrie Anne-Moss.  The story follows the four main characters from their time as mob hit-men to their time in a retirement home in Florida.  They're fired from every job possible, trying to survive the now envaded Florida scenery.  They yet again turn to crime to make everything ok again.  Packed with good comedy and great actors, the Crew is not to be missed.",980899200,2,621,4.54054054054054

1401072,4,B000056VOZ,"Mobster comedy THE CREW (2000) isn't popular with IMDb voters (currently it's 5.6 out of 10 stars),
and that's probably because of the picture's blatant ripoff of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GOODFELLAS/dp/B000P0J09M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GOODFELLAS</a>&nbsp;(1990)
concept of a narrated story about friends who beconme a mob crew. Despite many exact
references, like opening with a guy in the car trunk, and such monologue thoughts as
""All we ever wanted to be was gangsters,"" the film quickly leaves their early days
behind and becomes the story of four buddies, survivors of the 1978 Lufthansa heist
and other smaller organized thefts, who are now well past 60. They're unhappily retired
and living in the same Miami Beach hotel, just watching the old die off and the young
coming in. Low pay jobs insult their dignity, and all the kids invading their building
bug hell out of them, so they hatch one final scheme that will both satisfy their cravings to
be Wiseguys again AND get rid of the unwanted tattooed underwear ad types who now
surround them.

They take advantage of a rare occurrence, the body of an elderly man that's found on the beach.
After shotgunning the stiff's face into mush, a note is left on the remains that threatens
more murders. But it turns out the deceased is a Drug Lord's papa, and now he's after blood!

Great cast here, starting with the ""crew"" of (narrator) Richard Dreyfuss, Burt Reynolds,
Dan Hedaya and Seymour Cassell, whose character mostly never talks.

Supporting players include Jennifer Tilly, Lainie Kazan, Miguel Sandoval (as the drug lord),
Jeremy Piven (as a meathead police detective), Casey Siezmaszko and Jos Ziga.
Fyvush Finkel has a small role and even GOODFELLAS' Frank Vincent, the REAL body in the car,
appears briefly.

Even if the jokes are obvious and a bit weak, I like the spirit of this movie and its central idea
of long-shelved thugs having one last go at crime, and when Mis Tilly hires the boys to whack
her own stepmom it really starts to become fun. As we learn, there's always two sides to every
situation.",1433030400,2,2130,5.112068965517241

1401092,2,B000056VOZ,"Based on the line up, and caliber of actors, I was expecting a much better movie. I would have given it a 2 and a half stars, but truthfully it isn't worth 3.  I always had the impression that most of the main characters, with the exception of Dan Hedaya (who seemed like the only natural comedic one in the ensemble) were just trying way too hard to be funny, especially Dreyfus and Reynolds. For me, this made the flow of the comedy lacking a natural pulse or life.  And the script was just so-so at best.

Carrie Ann Moss comes off cold and wooden, and Jeremy Piven, while always delightful is under utilized and just typical of his second bananna days.  Watch it if it's on TV and you have nothing better to watch, otherwise pass.  ""Analysis This,"" with Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal is a much better film and comedy, but in a similar vein.

1401185,5,B000056VOZ,"This gem is a must for those 60-plus years old (or within a decade of it).  It's a sobering comedic look at the way it is...the way it was...and the way you'd still like it to be...through the script and antics much like a ""Three Stooges"" segment.  What a wonderful and pure comedy.  Great performances by Richard Dreyfuss, Burt Reynolds, Dan Hedaya and Seymour Cassel.  Every twist and turn...these lifelong buddies continue to goof it up only to make it all come together again.  Don't miss it.  It's a comedy that will stick with me forever.",1299196800,,544,4.614583333333333

1401190,4,B000056VOZ,"An action film in which old timers, ex baby boomers and other senior citizens who are more or less trying to live in various varicose-infected institutions can project themselves and identify with the main heroes who are just the same as them, old timers who are more or less trying to survive and have some fun in a fun-less varicose-cursed institution in Florida. A touch of Jewish-ness, a dose of sexual fascination, a couple of pairs of boobs, a lot of denuded breasts and chests, but no more than that, a little star of a dumb drug lord who is trying to shine in a world where all the sunshine has retired, and you have it. A funny film for an afternoon of enjoyment at the old people's home as an alternative to checkers or bridge. It is true there are some funny elements, like the arsonist rat or the real true skeleton of the lady next door burned in the arson of her house and that carries the dog tag of her little identity, made in Taiwan. Enjoy it and don't expect to remember it one hour later, except if you already have Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. Then the recollection would come from the back of your brain.

No drugs, no blood & guts, no sex - great for most of the family to watch & have a few laughs.",1168041600,2,254,4.3125
1401193,3,B000056VOZ,"Having read some very good reviews about this movie. I decided to purchase a copy! O-K we have moved on & times change, however the plot is a good one the players just do not perform to the script. Not least the main players are supported by the supporting cast to such a degree that it is they who make the script work. O-K I am English but I have a sense of humour unlike this movie Sorry!!!",1167782400,,393,4.051282051282051
1401194,4,B000056VOZ,"You'll find The Crew sitting outside of a rundown beachfront hotel, complaining about all of the young folks increasingly taking over their new territory.  Old age has not been kind to Joey ""Bats"" Pistella (Burt Reynolds), Mike ""The Brick"" Donatelli (Dan Hedaya), Tony ""Mouth"" Donato (Seymour Cassel), and Bobby Bartellemeo (Richard Dreyfuss), especially Bats, who has a habit of getting so upset that his pacemaker starts having conniptions.  He has his best ideas when he's unconscious, though - which is how the guys come up with their plan to scare off some of the younger folks who are threatening to displace them.  There's nothing like an old dude with his head blown off in a hotel lobby to keep the old rent down.  The guys don't kill anybody, though - they just abscond with a dead body and use it for their purposes.  Unfortunately, the stiff turns out to be the old man of local druglord Raul Ventana (Miguel Sandoval), who vows revenge on the perpetrators.  Even more unfortunately, Mouth (who never says anything) talks like Joan Rivers on a caffeine high after spending some quality time with his favorite stripper (Jennifer Tilly).  She, in turn, threatens to blab on the guys unless they kill her step-mother (Lainie Kazan), and that's when things really start to tumble out of control.  Did I mention that the detective investigating the case turns out to be Bobby's long-lost daughter?

Lest you wonder, The Crew is pure comedy which viewers of most ages can enjoy (parents may not want little Johnny to see Jennifer Tilly threatening to burst out of her skimpy outfits at any given time).  Don't make the mistake of looking at this as a true gangster film, as the limited violence is of the 3 Stooges variety, there's a minimum of cursing, and Joe Pesci is nowhere to be seen (although he does perform one of the songs accompanying the end credits).  The plot's somewhat circuitous yet pretty easy to follow - although you have to jump a number of plot holes along the way and the ending is quite implausible.  None of that really matters, though, because this is all about enjoying the ride as these seemingly washed-up old guys rediscover the bravado and swagger that made them big shots back in the day.  By the time all is said and done, The Crew is a veritable celebration of the elderly fighting back against the youthful society threatening to marginalize them.  This is one crew I would gladly ride with any day of the week (as long as the car hasn't been hotwired by the Brick).",1164499200,,2507,4.720183486238532

7932816,5,B000056VOZ,One of the funniest movies we've seen in a long while! We no longer get the STARS channel so we bought this DVD! It was that good! We rarely buy DVDs any more! This is nothing at all like Goodfellows! This is strictly comedy and the bad lauguage is really not that bad....its pristine compared to Goodfellows!!! All the actors were great! The story line was great and the laughs were almost non stop! I know we've seen this at least 8 times and will see it even more now! Some of the lines & come back lines are a total riot! It's not dirty in any way. The language isn't so bad that I wouldn't let a child watch it...over the age of 10 or 12 because most under that age won't get it at all. We're so happy this is out on DVD so we can enjoy it often!,1507507200,,751,3.980132450331126

7932819,3,B000056VOZ,"The plot was interesting and kept you guessing.  Richard Dreyfuss and Bert Reynolds were very funny with their lines but the other 2 actors kept up the fun part of the plot.  I enjoyed seeing Florida and not at it's best, but a good back drop.  The actress who played Richard Dreyfuss' daughter was very good and the going back to her childhood and the relationship she had with her father, were very nice to see.  The comedy has some dramatic moments but they all contribute to the plot and keep you guessing.  If you want to watch a film, see the past stars and have laughs and enjoy the ride, sad moments and a little mystery, this is for you.",1495929600,,646,4.305785123966942
