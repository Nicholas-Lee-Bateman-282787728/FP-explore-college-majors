8086746,5,B000BHB60A,I love this DVD. I do it a few times a week!,1454025600,,44,2.75
8086747,3,B000BHB60A,"I have mixed feelings about this video. They asked if this meets my expectations. No. It didn't. I mean, first of all, the title; ""Beth Shaw's YogaButt"". I thought we would get to see her yogabutt but no. She wears black pants (capri pants?) However, she does wear a short top that shows her finely tuned midriff. Obviously her exercise routine is working for her.
 Is this yoga? Some of it is. It is a mixture of aerobics, strength, and yoga. It begins with her telling you to put a yogabutt ball between your thighs. Then you do some postures beginning with a bridge pose while trying to hold the ball. It is very fast paced for the first 30 minutes like an aerobics session using yoga postures, then it ends with a 10 minute more traditional type yoga session. I was sweating after the first 17 minutes.  I could not perform all the challenges she presented.  She said, ""challenge yourself"" but she also said it was okay it stop and rest if necessary. For me it was necessary from time to time. She moved from pose to pose very rapidly. She gave no instruction, just called out what pose to do next. So you had better be very familiar with yoga before attempting to try this workout. I didn't think there was enough time between her calling the pose and moving on to the next one. Very fast paced. The intention is to make you sweat. It does, but I have other videos that do that just as well that are not so fast paced.
In the beginning she says to use a ""yoga butt ball"" between your thighs....hum. Well, I'm not buying a yoga ""butt ball"" so I can use this video. I guess my thighs are too skinny because the ball I used (about the size of a softball) kept falling out. Maybe I shoulda used a football.
 And that brings my final thought. There are videos as good as this and even better than this one for less money. At $22 this was a lot of money for one 40 minute routine.(In my opinion) For that price she should have included her ""butt ball"". (in my opinion) And autographed it too. lol
I noticed that Amazon no longer carries this video so you have to find it elsewhere at a better price.",1385251200,2,2098,4.290404040404041
8086748,5,B000BHB60A,I bought her video after giving birth to my 2nd child 6 years ago. It's the only video that I actually look forward to using. I was able to get rid of the butt cheeks under my butt cheeks if you know what I mean! It's easy to do yet you feel the burn every time. Her voice is soft and after I got used to the routines I just muted it and played music. I worked out 3 to 4 times a week for 30 to 45 minutes at a time and had noticable results in less than 2 weeks. Perfect for getting ready for those bikinis for sure.,1304553600,7,517,3.709090909090909
8086749,1,B000BHB60A,"I bought this DVD to shake up my workout since I am going to Costa Rica and wanted to look good in a bathing suit.  Not only does the DVD not give you a good workout but it DOES have a creepy, porn flick kind of ambiance.  Strange.  A better buy (also on Amazon) is Killer Butt with Dolores Munoz - it will make you sore (and lift your behind at the same time).  It worked after I did it for about 6 weeks every other day.  It's a little hard on the knees, by the way, so I've had to modify it, but she will work you hard.",1267833600,4,522,3.7522935779816513
8086750,4,B000BHB60A,"This is for you.  I'm unfamiliar with Beth Shaw's other creations but I felt that this was a decent dvd.  If you can handle the soft tone of her voice and that at times creepy almost porn flick feel, then get this.  I learned new moves that i can probably do alone, sans Beth so it was worth the price for sure.",1254182400,4,311,3.9838709677419355
