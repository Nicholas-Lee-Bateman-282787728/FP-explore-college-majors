Going to School in India is an interesting short documentary about children attending schools in different regions in India. It is fascinating to see kids going to school in the Salt Lake, Kashmir; a school operating in a bus in Mumbai, kids in tribal areas of Andhra Pradesh attending school in a boat.

Watching the video with my American-Indian preschooler, I was reflecting on the irony: we were using digital media to understand how those less privileged around the world are learning to thrive in the global village.

Use of clay dough, not play-doh, to make a simple abacus and learn math is ingenious indeed! Kids really seem to be enjoying simple pleasures of life,  while learning; isn't this what education all about?!

Must see video for those interested experiencing what it is like to go to school in rural India",1381968000,,1091,4.781914893617022
8180822,5,B000NQRWL6,"This DVD was truly fascinating!  There are nine different ""videos"" on the DVD, each portraying a different school in a different part of India.  The sections include: Going to School in the Lake, Going to School on a Bus, Going to School in a Mud Desert, Going to School on a Boat, Going to School on a Mountaintop, Going to School in a Tribe, Going to School in the Dark, Going to School on Wheels, and Going to School in a Monastery.  It is really amazing to see how the various schools are adapted to their local climates and lifestyles!  For instance, the school on the lake focuses a lot on the flora and fauna of the lake itself.

Like Families of India, this DVD is narrated by the children showcased in each section.  We see many of their homes, watch them travel to school, and learn a little bit about what they study there.  It is a great way to see the differences and similarities between people living in different regions of the country.  Also, many of these children are probably more representative of the general wealth level of the majority of India's residents (than those in Families of India).

This was a really fun and enlightening DVD!

8180824,5,B000NQRWL6,"Young children speak through child-interpreters about what makes their locale special, what they do with their friends, how they play, what they learn. The cinematography represents well the student's environment, be it on a houseboat or in a wheelchair, in grand mountains or dry mud flats. It's so good for me to see young children happy in school, despite the various derelict human conditions in some cases.",1200528000,3,411,5.149253731343284
8180825,5,B000NQRWL6,"A wonderfully intimate look at the lives of children a world away- yet at the same so very much like our own children. One sees children going to school in the middle of a mud desert, on a city bus, in the middle of the forest, and in the middle of the night in the desert. India is trying to keep its promise of providing an education to all its children. The children envelops one in their dreams and lives.",1181174400,4,409,4.125
