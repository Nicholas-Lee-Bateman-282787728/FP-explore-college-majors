4712845,4,B005JJCMPI,I like Girl form UNCLE. I heard alot of bad about it but its a fun show but not good as Man from UNCLE. If it has started out like man's first season it probably would have lasted a bit longer. But if you like the campy 60's Batman as I do you will enjoy Girl from UNCLE!!!,1332720000,,273,3.7241379310344827
4712846,4,B005JJCMPI,"THis collection is great. It takes me back in time. The action is great. Stepanie Powers did a good job of acting. Her male counter part is good too. She would later star in Hart To Hart,also a good series. The quality of the DVD picture on the screen is excellent. My score is 4 out of 5. Not bad at all .Ithink you will like it also.",1329004800,4,335,3.9411764705882355
4712847,5,B005JJCMPI,"yes, i wanted to be april dancer when i was a kid and first saw this show. it might be campy and some of the episodes are downright silly, but stefanie powers is still cool and a true role model for young girls. she was appealing and attractive but never trashy in u.n.c.l.e. she was also smart and could take care of herself while still showing a vulnerable side. she was never walked on but showed respect for mr. waverly and mark slade. what more does a kid need in a role model? i highly recommend that all members of the united network command for law enforcement purchase this dvd!",1321315200,15,587,4.345454545454546
4712848,4,B005JJCMPI,"Norman Felton, the co-creator of The Man From U.N.C.L.E. (1964-68), wanted to capitalize on the phenomenal popularity of the TV series, by spinning off another spy adventure series featuring a woman as the lead.  The result was The Girl From U.N.C.L.E. (1966-67), which lasted just a single season, and featured Stephanie Powers as agent April Dancer, and Noel Harrison as her partner Mark Slate.  Like their fellow U.N.C.L.E. agents Napoleon Solo (Robert Vaughn) and Illya Kuryakin (David McCallum), Dancer and Slate received their assignments from Mr. Waverly (Leo G. Carroll).

The first appearance of the characters April Dancer and Mark Slate, was in the second season of The Man From U.N.C.L.E., in an episode called The Moonglow Affair (Episode #52, 1966).  Interestingly different actors were cast in both roles, with Mary Ann Mobley appearing as April Dancer, and Norman Fell as Mark State.  The episode has a different tone and dynamic between Dancer and Slate, than would later be seen in the series.  Rather than being equals, Dancer is inexperienced in the field, while State is much older, a little out of shape, and definitely an American.

The creators retooled and recast the series, and went with a more hip, cool, and irreverent tone.  The agents became closer in age and experience, and Slate became British.  Mary Ann Mobley, a former Miss America, was replaced with the beautiful and athletic Stephanie Powers, who was a textbook example of a southern California girl.  Powers looked great in casual attire, outrageous contemporary fashions, or spectacular in formal attire.  Sexy, but with a sassiness and edge, Powers was no pushover, and had goods to tackle playing the lead in the spy spoof.  The son of actor Rex Harrison (Dr. Doolittle), Noel Harrison at about 30 years of age, already had an impressive resume.  A past member of the British Olympic skiing team, Harrison was also an accomplished singer, musician and actor.  Being British, and in very good physical condition, the dashing Harrison was obviously a big change from Norman Fell.  Together, Powers and Harrison make a solid and attractive team, in the battle against the dreaded forces of THRUSH.

By its third season (1966-67), The Man From U.N.C.L.E. had evolved to feature a less serious, more comedic approach to espionage.  The Girl From U.N.C.L.E. also adopted a similar approach, stressing humor and some wacky plots, over more serious stories grounded in reality.  While the series initially found some success in the ratings, the program finished the season ranked near the bottom, and was cancelled.  With the 60's spy craze winding down, the same fate also befell  The Man From U.N.C.L.E., as it was cancelled midway through its fourth season.

Notable guest stars appearing in The Girl From U.N.C.L.E. included Bernard Fox, Casare Danova, Kurt Kaznar, Peggy Lee, Wally Cox, Boris Karloff, Fernando Lamas, Shelly Berman, Nanette Fabray, Dom LeLuise, Leslie Uggams, Edward Mulhare, Lucianna Paluzzi, Lloyd Bochner, Joyce Jameson, Broderick Crawford, Sabrina Scharf, Victor Buono, Yvonne DeCarlo, and Vito Scotti.

The 29 episodes of The Girl From U.N.C.L.E. are broken up into two sets, each with four discs, currently selling for $44.95 each.  At about $90 for the season, that averages to around $3.10 per episode, which is a little steep.  Compare this to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-from-U-N-C-L-E-The-Complete-Series/dp/B00005JM5Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man from U.N.C.L.E.: The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;which once sold for $250, and has now dropped to about $130, and contains all four seasons of the program, totaling 105 episodes, on 41 discs.  The average cost per episode, is about $1.21.  This fantastic set is highly recommended, and often goes on sale at Amazon.  While The Girl From U.N.C.L.E. is a fun series, unless you are a really dedicated fan, you might want to wait until the price drops a bit, which it inevitably will.",1316217600,6,4006,5.347687400318979
4712849,5,B005JJCMPI,"What a long awaited treat! The successful The Man From U.N.C.L.E. had one very unsuccessful spin off- the one hour show- The Girl From U.N.C.L.E.. This obscure spin off lasted a very short one season. During The Man From U.N.C.L.E., two new characters were brought into the episode, THE MOONGLOW AFFAIR which filmed in December of 1965. The characters were April Dancer played by former Miss America Mary Ann Mobley and Mark Slate played by Norman Fell (Mr. Roper from Three's Company). These two characters would go on to do their own series, The Girl From U.N.C.L.E., in the next year in 1966. The producers found the inexperienced Mobley and the ordinary Norman Fell to be less exciting than the pair they wanted to portray in the new Girl From U.N.C.L.E. series. They found a much more hip and mod couple in a 23 year old Stephanie Powers, who spoke several languages fluently, which was an asset to the accents she would need working in all the foreign countries in the episodes, and a 32 year old very British Noel Harrison (Noel is the son of Rex Harrison). Added to the couple of April Dancer (Powers) and Mark Slate (Harrison) was the U.N.C.L.E. boss himself -Alexander Waverly played by Leo G. Carroll.

Although the stories were pure camp, the first two episodes did well in the Nielsen ratings at #24, followed by #30 for the next two episodes. By the 5th episode, the show plummeted down into the bottom numbers, which led to it's cancellation for a second season. Stephanie Powers was always blamed for it's cancellation, as she never made good comments for the press and was not thrilled with the show's crazy, silly unbelievable stories and campiness. Even in the successful first episode-The Dog-Gone Affair, THRUSH develops a drug that causes people to move in slow motion and the anecdote that April must bring is on a flea that is on a dog.

Aside from the campy silly stories, the show spared no expenses with many great guest stars and a $1,000.00 per episode wardrobe budget for Miss Powers. Stephanie Powers mod wardrobe came directly from Carnaby Street in London and she had gorgeous costumes for all the characters she had to play like a daughter of a sheik, a belly dancer or a stewardess. One thing that April Dancer lacked was the ability to get the bad guys. April always played the bait for THRUSH agents, she had compacts and earrings with sleeping gas-  but all the fighting was done by her partner Mark Slate. The Avengers Emma Peele did all her own fighting, where April Dancer was always a damsel in distress, making her a weak personality for the already weak story lines. Audiences saw the direct copying off the successful Batman Show, with it's cartoony characters and silly plots, which just didn't work in a spy-fi series as it did for Batman, which was based on a cartoon.

As campy as this show was, it will be great to see Stephanie Powers and Noel Harrison up against the bad guys again and all the THRUSH agents. In the third episode, The Mother Muffin Affair, you'll see Powers teamed up with U.N.C.L.E.'s Robert Vaughn to battle Mother Muffin- Boris Karloff in drag! From only one short year of filming, you'll be treated to a guest star list that is quite incredible, as these episodes included: Edward Asner, Joan Blondell, Tom Bosley, John Carradine, Jack Cassidy, Ellen Corby, Wally Cox, Dom DeLuise, Boris Karloff, Peggy Lee, Fernando Lamas, Gena Rowlands, Ann Sothern, Leslie Uggams, Robert Vaughn, Carol Wayne, Michael Wilding, Yvonne DeCarlo and more.

Warner Brothers is producing this one year Series in a two part disc set. They have divided the series in half and are making the set available together or separately. The Warner Brothers website is selling them together, where Amazon is selling them separately, and the TCM website is selling them together. The prices are all different, so you'll have to shop around. Each half set includes 4 discs, which is 8 discs total. The episodes are made on demand, which means they will only make them as they are ordered and not in mass quantities. These type of sets are always difficult to find in the future, so if you are interested in The Girl From U.N.C.L.E., don't miss out now, as it will be short lived, just as it was in 1966-1967. Warner Brothers website has a sample of the video quality of this show, if you want to see it before you order. Warner Brothers has made this show from the best quality video masters they could find, but it is not restored or remastered, so view before you buy. I looked at the sample and it looks great!

I have waited to see this wonderful campy show for decades and I can't wait to see all the great guest stars along with Noel Harrison and a very young Stephanie Powers with her fabulous mod Carnaby Street wardrobe. A huge Thank You to Warner Brothers for bringing back this fun show!

Meanwhile, I can only echo others who have said ""It's About Time.""  Now, when will we see official releases for some of the other classic series that have been totally ignored or have seen partial release (""The Paper Chase"" comes to mind) with no future releases planned?

The only complaint that I have is that the series should have been offered in one set instead of splitting it in two because the series itself only lasted for one season. I suspect that this was done to be able to get more money from those of us who are interested in seeing the classic television shows of the '60's that are in many cases a far sight better than a lot of the trash that crosses our television screens presently....,1483142400,5,561,4.252336448598131
