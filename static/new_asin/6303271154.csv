1175003,3,6303271154,"Since everyone else has already written about how they thought much of the film was formulaic, which it was, or how Kitano transcends the cliches, which he does, I'll just say that, despite some faltering performances by a few of the American actors, the film is very identifiable and enjoyable as a ""Kitano"" film.  What you should know is that the disc contains a ""cleaned-up"" version of the film in which many scenes containing violent content have been cropped or had gore digitally removed for U.S. release.  I don't believe it affects the running time much, but it is different from the Japanese release.  Also, if the subtitles (English or otherwise) are enabled, they run on all dialogue throughout the movie.  A selection were only the non-English dialogue is subtitled would have been appreciated.  I watch many subtitled films, but it felt distracting here.",1009929600,4,867,4.993055555555555
1175004,2,6303271154,"The most interesting thing about this film was the costumes by Yohji Yamamoto. The characterisations were flat, with a complete lack of apparent motives, and the plot development struck me as more than a little far-fetched.
Aniki is a man with no purpose, no feeling, no desire to stay alive, no anything. All he knows is that he is a Yakuza, and that is the life he must live. On the other hand, he isn't stupid, and doesn't seem particularly eager for death. So why does he so easily aquiesce when Shirase decides to take on the Mafia, a move he knows will bring certain death to his brothers? Perhaps it's because his girlfriend is dead and nothing matters anymore.
Uhhh... yeah... Maybe I could believe that if the relationship between Aniki and his girlfriend was developed to any significant extent, or even if Aniki showed any warmth or hapiness when around her. But he seemed to care for her as little as he did for the other things in his life, so this explanation just doesn't wash.
Maybe Aniki just doesn't care about anything. But we see that he does care for Denny, and earlier in the film he has shown that as an Aniki his first duty is towards his brothers. While he is not afraid to dies for them, and he will prevent them from dihonouring his gang, he also realises that alliances and compromises are sometimes necessary. As is all to often the case in this film, I just don't understand what the motivation behind this character is, and why we are suposed to believe in what he does.
See the film if you live in the sticks and don't get to see much of Yohji's extraordinary clothes. Otherwise you may be better off seeing another Takeshi film such as Fireworks. A harsh review perhaps, but I saw this film hard on the heels of Mulholland Drive, and I really don't think anything can compare well to that magnificent film.",1003968000,,1839,4.508982035928144
1175005,5,6303271154,"I meant to see this in the cinema with a friend but we never got round to it so as soon as it came out on DVD I had already planned an evening in.
To give a bit of background, Kitano plays Aniki Yamamoto, a Japanese gangster forced to leave Japan for Los Angeles.  In a place where he doesn't understand a word of language he finds his younger brother Ken.  Within moments Aniki is up to his usual antics - starting gang wars and turns his brother and his drug dealing side-kicks into a prominent yakuza force in LA.
I loved this movie so much.  Yes it's violent but Kitano never directs the movie as to glorify it.
It's not the violent moments that make the film but the more quieter moments where the friendship of Yamamoto and his new-found friends grow, blossom and fade all too quickly.
Omar Epps is sublime as Denny, whom Kitano's character forms an unlikely friendship and the two actors play off one another superbly.
Make no mistake, this is a violent film but Kitano still manages to inject some moments of hilarity.  The board meeting with the Mexican crime lords had my sides splitting where Ken has to translate for his older brother, Aniki.
This is a beautiful, thinking man's gangster film - so unlike a lot of the tripe you see today.  There's beauty, happiness, tradgedy and action all flowing from one superbly shot Kitano scene to the next.  It has to be said also that Joe Hisashi's score and soundtrack are wonderful to behold.
If you're a Kitano fan then this is a must-see and it's also worthwhile if you've never seen a Kitano film and are looking for something refreshing in the action-gangster genre.
In my opinion Kitano's style will never appeal to the mainstream western cinema but this fantastic effort ensures that his fan-base and credibility in the west is surely justified and he can probably add some new fans after this one as well.

1175006,4,6303271154,"Of all the directors who have plundered the legacy of Jean-Pierre Melville for superficial treasure, Takeshi Kitano has always been the most intelligent, the most alert to the Frenchman's metaphysical drive.  'Brother', Kitano's mostly marvellous new feature, is imbued with all things Melville, from the opening silent wandering of yakuza hero Yamomoto, like Jef Costello in 'Le Samourai', and his Alain Delon-lookalike sidekick, to the muted blue color palette, the faceless glass buildings and grey ritual beach from 'Dirty Money'.
Most pertinent, however, is Melville's under-rated 'Two men in Manhattan' (1959).  That was Melville's first American film; this is Takeshi's; both directors' first cultural work in the country whose major urban genre they had made their own.  And like Melville, instead of dealing with this new country and its customs, Kitano seems to have become more obsessively Japanese, even more interested in ritual, stylisation, nation, philosophy.  In other words, Kitano has taken foreign money to make an uncompromisingly personal film which, like 'Boiling Point' and 'Kids' Return', turns the gangster film into a perverse rites-of-passage.",996105600,,1171,5.674285714285714
1175007,4,6303271154,"I saw this film at this year's Sundance Film Festival and loved it. I do think however that most of the American characters in the film are unbelievable characters. The Japanese gangsters are great, while the American gangsters seem like they are off a really bad soap opera. Kitano is much better at creating Japanese characters. A Japanese audience would most likely not pick up on this, so I really tried to look at this movie in that context. I really liked all the action and yakuza scenes however. Defiantly worth seeing! totemo omoshirokata",993859200,2,547,4.829787234042553
1175008,4,6303271154,"I have a sort of love/hate relationship with Takeshi Kitano. I think he's got a HUGE ego, likes to put his own image on screen far too much, can overindulge in sentimentality, and occasionally offers filmic messages which border on being fascist. At  his worst, his films are extremely hostile towards people who look or behave outside the norm -- see the scene in FIREWORKS where, disguised as a cop, Takeshi pretends to shoot a long haired kid from his car window; it's EASY RIDER from the point of view of the rednecks in the pickup. He seems to advocate a shoot-first-ask-questions-later defense of the family, the home, etc., which seems to identify him with the more conservative or right-leaning aspects of Japanese society, which leaves me (and some more progressive Japanese) with misgivings about his work. His movies also are brutally violent -- there's a scene in BROTHER where my hands leapt to my face and I cried out involuntarily, which I just don't DO in movies.  All that said, I rather enjoyed this film. It's a relatively simple tale of loyalty and friendship among mobsters. Takeshi is a Yakuza who goes looking for his brother in LA, and ends up working with his brother's gang to take over drug distribution in their neighborhood, going to war with other gangs to do so. Some of the violence here doesn't seem to have much to do with the story -- there are scenes of finger-cuttings and hara-kiri that aren't really that justified in terms of the narrative -- and as I say, there is some very extreme brutality from time to time -- but if you don't mind violent cinema, are interested in the Yakuza, like gangster movies, or just like to watch smartly-made films, BROTHER is ultimately rewarding and enjoyable. It doesn't break much new ground, but it kept my interest up. The supporting cast, by the way, are quite good; Takeshi seems as able to direct in English as in Japanese. As far as I know, this is his first film since JOHNNY MNEMONIC (which he merely acted in) that has a substantially English-speaking cast....",991526400,3,2044,4.722689075630252

1175036,3,6303271154,"While in no way Takeshi Kitano's best film, it is definitely an entertaining one. Kitano plays a Yakuza gangster forced to leave Japan for the U.S., where he unleashes just as much carnage as he did in his own homeland.

The acting on the end of the Japanese actors is great on all counts. The English speaking actors don't fare as well and I don't think it could be attributed to inexperience as much as it would the language barrier. Still, it's definitely worth watching as it is pretty violent and hypnotic in an odd way.

The DVD for this film is lacking in so many ways that it's not even funny. The film has a great video transfer that is pretty crisp and clean. Kitano is no slouch with the visuals and he manages to capture the elegance of Japan and Los Angeles with great shot composition and interesting angles.

The 5.1 Dolby Digital is eye opening, to say the least. The dialogue is recorded low but whenever there's violence, it's LOUD. The first gunshot in the film nearly made me leap under my couch.

The surround channels are used effectively and the score by Joe Hisaishi is enhanced greatly by this. That's one thing I have to say about this film: the score is absolutely amazing. Most of Kitano's movies are complimented by Hisaishi's music and this one is just as good as any of the others.

This disc has no extras to speak of and frankly, I'm hoping to see a better disc come along for this film in the near future. An interview, a commentary track.... you will find none of these here. Not to mention that there are trailers for a couple of different films and none of them are for Brother itself.

It's hard to recommend this disc due to the lack of features but at the very least, they did a good job with the sound and picture.",1156291200,,1755,4.384615384615385
1175037,3,6303271154,"Its hard to put a finger on exactly what went wrong with ""Brother.""  Takeshi Kitano is an immensely talented film director and actor, but i suppose even he has to miss the mark sometimes.

The story has potential.  An exiled yakuza goes to his half-brother in Los Angeles after finding himself on the wrong side of a gang war in Japan.  There, he does what he knows best and begins forging a rag-tag collection of petty thugs and drug dealers into a professional gang, finally feeling big enough to challenge the Italian Mafia for control of the area.

However, in going to the US Takeshi left his area of expertise, and it shows.  I once read an interview with him, regarding his American debut in ""Johnny Mnemonic,"" where he said that the American director didn't really understand what a yakuza was.  Unfortunately, the same thing is true here.  Takeshi doesn't really understand the Los Angeles gangs, and the whole thing seems fake.  What works in Japan doesn't necessarily work in the US, and Takeshi doesn't explore these differences.  He just has everyone instantly fall in line with the Japanese Way.  He also has trouble directing the English speaking actors, and their dialog falls flat.

There are some good bits here.  Takeshi's character, Yamamoto, is an interesting figure, quite and soft-spoken but every bit a hard-core villain.  His first entry into the US, not understanding the English and customs around him, is a fascinating study of cultural isolation.  Another favorite scene is when he has a gang members pinkie cut off when he fails, although no one else around him understands why.  They don't get the yakuza expression of penance.

This was meant to be Takeshi's transition film for US audiences, and he hoped that the Los Angeles setting would provide a familiar door for viewers.  He also mines freely from some of his older flicks, especially ""Sonatine"" which has a similar theme of a gangster in exile.  Plenty of yakuza and ""Japanese"" stereotypes and pitched in for the Americans as well, things that would never normally appear in a Takeshi flick.  Trying to bridge both worlds meant that he ultimately failed to do either. The Japanese world that he knows so well gets mixed into the unfamiliar American gangland, and both suffer.

""Brother"" is not a terrible film by any means.  He is still Takeshi Kitano, and even his worse flick is still worthwhile.  But it just doesn't achieve any of the greatness that we have come to expect.",1149724800,3,2467,4.835322195704057
1175038,4,6303271154,"Brother (Takeshi Kitano, 2000)

When I see a film that has both the names Ren Osugi and Ryo Ishibashi in the credits at the video store, I know I'm in for a good time. Brother did not disappoint.

Kitano does what so few foreign directors manage to do: come to Hollywood and make a good movie despite having to work within the strictures of the MPAA. That said, the DVD release is, of course, unrated; it makes me wonder what on earth the MPAA found so objectionable that the film would have required an NC-17 rating had it not been cut. (One note on IMDB mentions that not only was the movie cut, but cut heavily.) Just another confusing moment trying to figure out the MPAA.

Brother may not be Takeshi Kitano's best film, but it's still a lot of fun. Aniki, a yakuza (Takeshi) displaced by the merging of his former family into that of their rival is marked for death, and his best friends are ordered to perform the hit as a test of their loyalty. Instead, they allow him to escape to America, where he goes into hiding with his younger brother, Ken (Beat's Claude Maki), and Ken's band of small-time dope dealers. Well, yakuza-born, yakuza-bred; Aniki sees an opportunity to build an empire from scratch, and he takes it.

Rather than attempting to work out how to take a story conceived in his native land and adapt it to an American treatment, Takeshi comes up with an idea (or, perhaps, managed to put himself in a position where he could make a movie he'd been thinking about already in the best way possible) that blends the two cultures, and turns the movie, at least in part, onto a meditation between the differences between the two.

That, however, is not what you will notice while watching the movie; what you'll notice is the movie itself. That's part of the magic of films like this; things are moving so fast that you don't really have time to look at the deeper aspects until later, but those deeper aspects will be easily found with a few moments of reflection. While you're watching the film, though, you're far more likely to notice the acting (Takeshi himself simply exudes cool, and even House star Omar Epps manages to use a few expressions that have not crossed his face on a screen before), the camerawork, and the violence. Maybe I'm used to Takashi Miike movies, but to me, the violence in Brother seemed almost understated much of the time; while the movie's body count is admittedly high, those who have seen Ichi or the Dead or Alive trilogy will certainly find nothing here nearly as ostentatious.

Fun, fun movie. If you missed it the first time around, now's a good time to catch up. *** ",1141171200,,2624,4.534883720930233

Kitano plays a disgraced Yakuza foot soldier whose extreme behaviour sees him exiled in the US, where his younger brother lives. Kitano starts his new life exactly where his old life left of - with extreme violence.

This is Kitano at the height of his self-destructive performances. Separated from his ""family"", adrift in a banal culture, with little understanding of the language, his fast and fiery rise to power is bested only by his rapid decline.

One gripe: when are we going to see more features - particularly commentaries - on Kitano DVDs. Even ZATOICHI is barren of such DVD basics.",1123632000,,770,4.907692307692308

The basic plot has Takeshi playing a yakuza forced to leave Japan upon the death of his boss.  He finds his half brother in LA pushing drugs rather than attending school.  Takeshi violently turns the small time crew into a major crime cartel.

Yakuza themes of loyalty to family and honor over life pervade the movie.  The omnipresent violence somehow avoids being gratuitous, perhaps because one realizes how more graphic it could have been.

It is about an exiled Yakuza that goes to america to live with his brother that he sent to college only to find out that his brother is a street thug drug pusher. The movie then follows along how the exiled Yakuza moves his useless brother and worthless friends up in the ranks of the underworld Yakuza style and their eventual fall in a very realistic way. People are saying that the movie is boring but i think they were expecting the wrong things from it. This movie is not really an action movie anyway. It is very real in the sense of the route some people take and the way they end up because of it. I would say rent it and not buy it although it is a very good movie see it for yourself then decide. Yes the movie is not totally action packed and yes it moves along a slower pace but that realism is actually enjoyable to me rather than seeing constant gun battles for no reason or very stupid fight scenes like the crazy 88's in Kill Bill as another reviewer mentioned.,1098489600,4,1109,4.162790697674419

Another scene is when they go to attack the mafia, all you see is flashes of gunfire while this young boy is dead in the car. This is a moving film, asides the infruequent gore, You feel a great sympathy for the characters.
Kill bill has no technique at all especially when she is fighting the crazy 88 or whatever. I have seen more technique in Iron Monkey (an old skool martial arts film)The awkward ending leaves you distraught with no hope, but that is the point of the film and 'Beat' portays it that way.",1086739200,6,879,4.333333333333333
1175043,2,6303271154,"Brother may seem like a whole lot of meaningless gore, and in fact I don't think it was a particularly well-made or enjoyable movie, but it provides valuable insight into the Japanese perception of their place in the world. I'm not sure this was intended by the director, but it makes a very interesting contrast to, for example, ""Rising Sun"", another fairly average movie (can't comment on the book, haven't read it), which showed a very American perspective of the Japanese.
Whereas in Rising Sun, we saw the Japanese as sneaky little yellow men hiding their prejudices, corruption and kinky sex behind polite smiles and a facade of high culture, here Kitano portrays them (or at least the Yakuza) as noble, loyal, selfless, brave warriors, willing to sacrifice all to protect their honour. Quite a contrast!
Rising Sun showed Westerners (represented by the US alone, as usual) as passionate but ultimately rational, independent-minded for the better, and, for the most part at least, genuine (in a ""what you see is what you get"" sense). Kyoudai (incidentally, the title refers not to any blood relationship between the two main characters - there was none!, but to the ""brotherhood"" of the Yakuza) shows Westerners as emotionally out-of-control, intellectually lacking, hopelessly disorganised and incapable of any subtlety or restraint. From considerable experience in Japan I can assure you that this is an accurate representation of the stereotype held by many Japanese.
Another (I think) accurate representation of the Japanese mindset in this film lies in the ease with which the Japanese muscle-in on the US underworld. With their diligence, their capacity for cooperation and self-sacrifice towards long-term, collective goals, how could they possibly fail against this disorganised rabble of Westerners?! - this is the attitude presented, and mostly validated in this film. It's very interesting, then, that the ""brotherhood"" are ultimately unsuccessful in their power-bid. Is this a symbolic recognition that the US has remained militarily and economically supreme? At the least, I feel that the way in which Kitano's character dies again reflects an important facet of the Japanese mindset, being the attitude that there is only ever a choice of complete victory or total failure, conquering the whole of Asia or being stripped of all military power, scoring highly in the University entrance exams or dropping out of the academic world completely - there is absolutely no room for compromise or mediocrity, and thus a willingness follows to sacrifice everything in the bid for that absolute, and possibly elusive, victory. Of course, this has alarming implications for Japan's potential return to military and/or economic power.
But if you want, you can forget my interpretations and just see this movie as a whole lot of meaningless gore.",1083715200,6,2853,5.2725274725274724
1175044,5,6303271154,"To describe ""Brother"" as Takeshi Kitano's American directorial debut is like saying Lost in Translation is a Japanese movie.  The speaker would be missing the boat totally.  In ""Brother"" we see Japan and America coming to a cataclysmic impact as Yamamoto (Kitano), a Yakuza mobster, is exiled from Japan and forced to live in America with his half-brother.  When Kitano finds out that his brother is a small time drug dealer, Kitano takes his brother (as well as his gang) under his wing and turns them into a crime organization to be reckoned with.  They take on a mexican cartel and italian mafia alike.  However, we see the theme of brotherhood become more of a theme when he and Denny (played by Omar Epps), another small time drug dealer, create a bond that was never attained by his blood brother.
Kitano uses light and shadow to punctuate the drama, but the most awe inspiring element to his cinematic vision is the use of silence and stillness.  When Kitano is on the screen, sometimes he stands like a statue.  The silence in his films are deafening (for a remarkable example of this, I refer to the film ""Violent Cop"").
With the use of Japanese and English language, we are thrust among the cultural barrier of the gang.  However, they are able to circumvent this and become true brothers.",1079481600,3,1299,4.691629955947136

Not exactly a masterpiece, or the best movie he has done, but it gave a great insight into the Yakuza lifestyle rarely known outside of Japan. But on this DVD, the lackluster treatment of this movie is unforgivable.
If some of the story was a little on the unexplained side, maybe it's because the US version is 30 minutes shorter than the Japanese original. Most of the Japanese sequences were cut, so Americans won't have to read too many subtitles. Great move(?). The DTS audio option was thrown out for some reason, thinking people who might like this movie will not have a DTS decoder. Sony, get with the times!
The biggest problem I had with this DVD was that there were no English subtitles! It is listed as `English SubtitlesEbut in fact, it's English Closed Captions, so even when they are speaking English, the captions appear. Luckily I understand both languages, but for anyone else, they would be a headache to sit through.
Extras are very minimal, only trailers for completely unrelated Chinese movies? For a list price so high, it just seems smarter to get the fully loaded Region 2 Japanese release. Believe me the story makes a LOT more sense.
Also, the character that Tetsuya Watari plays is such a minor role in the US version, it was a shame that his name appears in the credits.

Swimming pools, movie stars, and Yakuza hitmen fighting for control of the streets with Chicano druglords and African-American gangstas. Just another typical day in sunny SoCal, according to Japanese cult director ""Beat"" Takeshi Kitano, in his first U.S.-released film.  Kitano directs himself as the ""marked"" Yakuza who flees to the States, hooks up with his ""adopted"" brother (a low-level L.A. drug dealer) and his pals, then becomes Crimelord of Los Angeles in what appears to be a period of only a month or two. Action fans will probably be somewhat sated just by the sheer number of killings (I stopped counting after the first 2 dozen) yet turned off by the deliberate pacing and long, static takes. Arthouse fans will admire the deft cinematic touches and hip music score, but will probably find the frequent shootings and self-mutilations a bit overboard. Kitano the actor (an acquired taste) is in top form; Kitano the director seems less confident than usual, as if he was deliberately ""dumbing down"" for U.S. audiences (and can anyone who has viewed a Vin Diesel movie blame him?). Best enjoyed if you don't think about it too much; genre fans might detect similarities to the existential 60's Yakuza cult classic ""Tokyo Drifter"".",1048032000,2,1284,5.056603773584905
1175050,5,6303271154,"Takeshi Kitano is a respected Japanese film director.  His films are brutal dramas of life in the Japanese mafia, not action thrillers, but slowly paced and carefully constructed commentary on the meaning of violence, honor, and even love.  He uses long stretches of silence, and shots in which very little movement takes place.  These serve to give the film a pensive atmosphere, and contrast with bursts of violence coming out of nowhere, with no warning and no stylistic embellishment.  Kitano stabs a man with the exact same level of intensity as he turns on a light switch.  Gunfights in Kitano's movies are often nothing more than two combatants standing in a room firing bullet after bullet into each other until only the one with the most willpower is left standing.  The standard Kitano ""hero"" is doomed from the start, as are basically all the other characters.  The background of mafia violence is not the focus of the film, but is used to intensify its message.  Kitano's philosophy is that in order to show the greatest of one thing, you must show it's opposite.  In order to show the greatest love, and the greatest peace, one must show the strongest hatred and violence.  The experience of watching one of his films is unique.  They are quite powerful, unlike anything else being made today.
That said, 'Brother' is not as good as most Kitano films.  It doesn't seem to have that much original to say.  What is does do well is transplant perfectly Kitano's style from Japan to the United States.  As a fan I enjoyed the film and am sure other Kitano fans will as well.
Newcomers to Kitano's films may expect this to be an action movie.  They will be disappointed.  This movie needs to be watched and judged it for what it is, a piece of art first and entertainment second.",1042502400,,1787,4.67948717948718

I'm really stunned by some other reviews saying things like ""Japanese version of The Godfather"" and ""accurate portrayal of the Yakuza"". The only Godfather this might compare to, on rating alone, would be Godfather III which was a bomb. And this is a valid portrayal of Yakuza gansters only if your average Yakuza is a suicidal halfwit with the emotions and intellect of a delinquent street urchin.
""Brother"" has a stylish light-jazz soundtrack, very hip art direction and a cool aesthetic look which are enough to make you want to like the film.
Unfortunately, that's a tall order. The dialogue is juvenile (at least the english subtitling anyway), perhaps the Japanese language is better. The characters are plastic and one dimensional. The script is ludicrous, not the slightest grasp on reality of gangster society. Law enforcement is virtually non-existent in this movie since the gangster can slaughter each other in non-stop extravagant violence and almost never encounter the police. Killing is wanton and practically without any character motivation or response much of the time ... you're just left wondering. Compared to other gangster flics, there is almost no credibility in any part of this story.
This movie is optimized aesthetic silliness, with mindless two-second murders by the dozen, all committed to a jazzy sax soundtrack. At the midpoint, I was pondering whether to continue watching as the movie descended into the abyss. I only persisted to the end in order to see how low would actually sink.
This movie is as bad as ""Knock Off"", ""The Negotiator"", and ""Showdown in Little Tokyo"", probably worse.
If you really want to see an ultra-hip, stylized, aesthetics-over-plot film, try ""The Odd One Dies"" (Hong Kong, 1997) or ""Fallen Angels"" (1995), both with Takeshi Kaneshiro. Or an equally obtuse and bizarre film, but nonetheless very stylized action pulp noire, try Seijun Suzuki's classic ""Branded To Kill"" (1967). Or better yet, try ""The Big Hit"" (1998) with mark Wahlberg and Lou Diamond Phillips, which is another mindless but entertaining killing spree which doesn't take itself too seriously.
""Brother"" is a disappointment. It is very nicely art-directed, and not much else. This is not the ""Godfather"" of the Yakuza genre. I am not flying solo in my critical view, the 69 reviews on RT have it at 51% thumbs down. One reviewer summed up my feelings well in his comment: ""Rarely has such an artful aesthetic been used to craft such sadistically violent junk.""...",1036972800,2,2696,5.08803611738149

the UK R2 version is apparently the best, but for US buyers the fact that it is in PAL format is a major problem, unless you happen to have a television that can playback in PAL or your DVD player converts it for you. Simply dezoning the player is not sufficient. You won't get any picture.
the Japan and Hong Kong R3 versions I believe are both in NTSC. The Japan version might be anamorphic (like the UK version) but the Hong Kong version is non-anamorphic. These are both in DTS. The Hong Kong version might be the best bet for US buyers as the menus are in English. It is often on ebay.
The Australian R4 version is 'rental only' but can be found in second hand shops. Big problems: it is in pan&scan (4:3). It is uncut, however, and the colours are the original muted palette.
I went for the UK R2 version and I'd urge all non-US English language buyers to do the same.
P.S. Another issue with the R3 Hong Kong version -- the English subtitles appear during all the dialogue, whereas in the R2 UK version the subtitles appear only when characters are speaking in non-English languages.

1175060,5,6303271154,"Acclaimed director Takeshi Kitano -winner of the Golden Lion in Venice '97 for his film ""Fireworks""- is again behind the camera directing Brother, his ninth film to date. Kitano also plays the role of the main character as he has done in most of his films.
The movie tells us the story of Yamamoto, a member of the Yakuza -the Japanese Mob-, who is expelled from the brotherhood he belongs to due to the betrayal of several members of his clan. He's given up for dead and moves from Tokyo to Los Angeles where he has a younger brother who survives as a modest drug dealer. Then, they begin to wipe out their opponents and thanks to Yamamoto's courage and insight they will become a powerful clan that controls several city areas. However, on their way to seize power, they meet their match and things will begin to go downhill. I won't spoil the ending but I must say that it's a thrilling and emotive one.
Kitano offers to the audience an electrifying portrayal of the Yakuza, its motivations and, most of all, its code of honor. The film can also be described as a tragedy because there's a sense of fatality which indicates that everything in the movie moves toward their end. The film depicts the state of mind of a man(Yamamoto)who has lost everything in which he believed and who has become a stateless person, an uprooted drifter shunned from his cultural environment with a ticket of no return.
As in other previous films by this director, deadpan humor is also present but perhaps not so constant as in other movies. There's also an underlying parody of the genre of action and noir films in the realistic and, at the same time, exaggerated way that Kitano describes violence.
Another remarkable aspect is the marvellous soundtrack composed by Kitano's longtime collaborator, Joe Hisaishi. A tranquil and melodic score that apparently contrasts with the violence that surrounds the film and which features orchestral and minimal music accompanied by free jazz and rock with absolute perfection in an unparalled exercise of emotional intensity.
To finish I'll just say that, in my humble opinion, Brother is an exciting film that is worth seeing and which proves, one more time, that Takeshi Kitano is one of the most talented and distinctive filmmakers of our days.",1017187200,9,2274,4.803571428571429
1175061,4,6303271154,"There is such a paucity of good movies out these days that when a decent, worthwhile effort such as this appears one is tempted to rate it higher than it deserves.
While Hollywood continues to churn out the usual stuff and sequels to try and maintain the revenue momentum, along comes the odd foreign movie to jolt the system a little.
Contrast the violent portrayal of gangster life against the latest Arnie movie. I am sure that there will be uproar in some quarters not only against the viciousness of it but also against the graphic nature. The broader view is the use of the violence to highlight a code of honour to which the Japanese gangsters adhere.
The film contrasts the use of violence in gangster societies, pitting the somewhat ethical stance of the Japanese against the money orientated Mafia and the utter ruthlessness to which they will resort.
A peculiar feature of the movie is the central character who speaks fewer words than in the entire screenplay for 2001. The camera follows his arrival in Los Angeles, his recollection of how he came to America, through his growing success in the drug trade until his ultimate demise. Throughout this journey homage is paid to American mob movies, in particular the Godfather. In one particular scene a meeting is planned whereby the other side are to be taken out by the use of weaponry hidden in the bathroom. When the moment comes, the weapons cannot be accessed due to the bathroom being occupied. The penultimate scene too is a genuflection to the scene in the Godfather where Sonny is killed by the massed ranks of machine gun toting, nicely dressed hoods.
But in the end the Yakuza is found to be a decent chap as he repays his long time associate for an earlier misdeed he committed against him and provides the wherewithal for a new start, presumably on the right side of the law.
There are some great scenes in this movie, some of which are referred to in other reviews. The scenes are sharp and bright and the camerawork is excellent establishing a high sense of realism.

Here the Brother organised his friends into a clan and started a cruel war on local mafia families to win a space.  The newcomer is cruel and does not think twice before killing his rivals.  However, what makes this movie worth watching is natural looking Darwinist style violence and relationships within his band beautifully played by Kitano and his actors.
What always appealed me in Kitano's films is human interaction between central characters including the most negative ones.  The Brother is cruel, strong, and a good marksman.  He is not a kind of person you ordinarily would like to meet on a street.  However, he ultimately sacrifices his life to save Danny, his black companion, from the band of Italians.  But in the beginning of the movie those two characters had very few if any reasons to like each other after the Brother pokes Danny in the eye with a broken bottle, then cheats him in a game.

Colors are not to be changed, they are to be left to their original tint or brightness.
Today I bought Brother at Best Buy. I was happy to find that I got the last copy from the 2 shelves that
  held them. I was surprised that it was there, so I bought it. When I got to opening it, there was some
  nice cover art on the disc, and no  collecter's booklet like on most Sony discs. I popped the disc
  in to my new Panasonic RP56 and set down to watch on my Phillips 16:9 HDTV. Never have I seen a film
  murdered in front of my eyes.
  Aniki's(main character) world is not thrilling but grim. It is somewhat gloomy. There is an occasional color
  flair(rare) to hint at a character's personality. Blacks are deep and accurate. There is tons of gray. Blue is
  on the dark side, green is in some scenes dark and other scenes light, finally red is crimson, and
  sometimes darker. All of this is represented accurately on the two DVD's I have previously watched(UK
  and Japan) and seen in a THX certified theater. The theater I saw the movie was dead on colorwise, and
  the picture quality was unbeatable.
  The above is thrown out the window in the Sony Pictures Classics version. Gray is subdued and no longer
  prevalent. Blacks are ruined. This killed quite a number of scenes. Blue is no longer dark or a little dark,
  it's just plain blue. Green is a neon green in some scenes and now is a bright. Red is pushed, but just
  enough that the color is a bit lighter.
  The beginning scene is tarnished by the Sony version. Takeshi Kitano is standing waiting for a cab. In the
  scene, Takeshi Kitano is supposed to stick out, and the background is covered with a thin gray, to make
  him prevalent. Instead the Sony Pictures Classic version completely takes out the gray, and the scene is
  then butchered. The scene where Kitano murders the Latino drug dealer the blacks are deep, the colors
  subdued. The Sony Pictures Classic version, pushes the flesh tones until the point of absurdity. The
  blacks are off, and the green door to the left of Claude Maki is now a bright neon green, whereas the
  other versions had the door dark green or a light pine green.
  There also to seems to be a fairly large quantity of edge enhancement, which is absent on the 3 other
  sources. Everything is made vibrant, which makes no sense considering this is a very dark movie.
  What doesn't help the Sony Pictures Classics version is that its edited. The movie begins with a Sony
  Pictures Classics label pasted over the Kitano label, with the background music still there. This tells you
  that, you are about to view an inferior version. There are various edits to the movie digitally. Such as
  painting over brain matter on walls from gun shot's, and time and gore edits. The stark emotion of the
  Hagakure scene is also killed by the editing.
  The features? Just some stupid trailers for some movies that remind me of the word... The

1175068,5,6303271154,"Though it lacks the subtle emotional resonance of Fireworks (Hana-Bi), Brother is nevertheless one of Takeshi Kitano's best films. It is certainly the most briskly paced, one of the best acted, and one of the most violent films in this master's oeuvre.
Kitano's brilliance lies in showing you things in unexpected ways, often by means of excluding parts of the action that would be considered essential in conventional editing. But the boldness of his choices, the stunning photography, and the sure-handed editing all combine so that his unusual shot selection seems perfectly natural, a result of economy and artistic conviction, rather than unnecessary quirk or a desire to show off. His is one of the most distinctive narrative voices in cinema today.
Kitano remains the perfect actor for his own directing and scripting. In Brother, as in Boiling Point, Kitano often takes the story away from his own character to explore supporting characters. But unlike in Boiling Point, here we have a supporting cast (headed by Omar Epps, who adapts into the Kitano style of comedy fluidly) thoroughly capable of holding our gaze, honororary mention going to Kuroudo Maki for his doggedly persistent portrayal of Yamamoto's younger half-brother Ken, Susumu Terajima as loyal (but also very funny) lieutenant Kato, and Masaya Kato as psychotic henchman Shirase.
The title Brother has a broader application in this film. The Epps-Kitano chemistry is enormous, surprising because it usually consists of only a couple of small gestures and a few lines of deadpan dialogue. Given its meaning in both Japanese gangster-speak (""aniki"") and American vernacular, it's a brilliant choice for a title. And Kitano shows that he can make a film with American actors without sacrificing any of his distinctive style. A must-see for Kitano fans, to be sure, but also crucial viewing for all cinema lovers who relish seeing a master at his peak.",1010102400,2,1922,5.183279742765273
