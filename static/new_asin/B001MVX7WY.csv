8322065,4,B001MVX7WY,"While I found ""The Hard Way"" entertaining, I couldn't help comparing Mcgoohan's acting with his superb series, ""Danger Man"" and ""Secret Agent.""  The former was a half hour show in the early sixties, enlarged to an hour in ""Secret Agent.""  In ""The Hard Way,"" Mcgoohan plays a worn out assassin called upon by Lee Van Cleef for another assassination.  Mcgoohan at first refuses, then relents when Van Cleef means to harm Mcgoohan's wife if he doesn't ""do this one last job.""  I highly recommend ""Danger Man"" and ""Secret Agent"" as vehicles for Mcgoohan's terrific acting range.",1472083200,,574,4.947916666666667
