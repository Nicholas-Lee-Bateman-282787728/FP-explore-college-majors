8383048,5,B002WG8UBG,"I used to rush home from work every afternoon to watch this guy.  Great stress relief via simple comedy.  This was supposed to be a kid's TV show, but so many of the jokes had double meanings that it was enjoyable for adults too.  Stupid sometimes, silly sometimes, off the wall sometimes, but the show had it's appeal. And hey, there's a kid in each one of us.  Good pie-in-the-face humor that is impossible to find today.",1334448000,4,423,4.454545454545454
