748842,5,6303961703,"I'm very surprised this movie hasn't been release on dvd.  Many of the reviews already written do a good job of explaining the movie.  I would only add that to me the movie is about two lonely people each with their own illusions, about themselves and the other, which are shattered within the small confines of a dimly lit studio apartment.",1134000000,3,341,4.573770491803279
748843,5,6303961703,"Noonan and Sillas, pushing mid-life and on a first date, are so real, it's painful to watch. But if you appreciate excellent acting and character-driven drama, this movie is a must-see.

Someone, please, release this film on DVD so it doesn't disappear to tape rot! Forget the bells and whistles, the extra features - just put this on DVD, please.",1120003200,17,347,4.783333333333333
748844,5,6303961703,"Jackie and Michael are on a first date.  Jackie is a secretary in a law firm and Michael works as a paralegal in the same firm.  The entire film takes place in Jackie's Manhattan apartment.
There is never a ""true"" comfortable moment on this date.  These are two people who haven't dated in awhile and the discomfort is evident on their faces, in their body language, and in some of the bizarre comments that come out of their mouths.
Michael seems to feel the need to say things that demonstrate his superiority over Jackie.  Jackie has mistakenly perceived Michael to be confident and is certain that he is in the process of writing a book -- she sees him take notes at work and he even pulls out a little notebook and takes a note during their date.  She likes who she thinks he is but Michael isn't one to believe, easily, that he is liked.
The film feels almost like a play -- with the added benefit of closeups of their facial expressions.  So much more of the drama occurs there than in their words (at least, until the end).  The colors in the film are rich, dark -- solid, primary colors -- mainly blues and reds that soften a bit in intensity as the emotion increases.
Their conversation often takes opposite directions from each other -- Michael saying goofy, offbeat things (some are lies in an attempt to live up to Jackie's errant perception of him) -- and Jackie saying things and moving in ways intended to ""seduce"" (though awkwardly).  And the conversation threads through a meal that Jackie has prepared and the consumption of one bottle after another of increasingly potent drinks.  Jackie's comment near the beginning of the date, ""I don't drink that much, you know, just sometimes at night -- sometimes on the weekends"", makes me laugh (basically, just not when she's at work, I guess).  Not that she comes off as an alcoholic -- it's just a funny line.  But this is not a comedy.
There are moments in this film that are truly creepy:  an eerie scene where Jackie is reading Michael a story that she has written -- almost unbelievable that she would read it to him, considering its content; an apartment across from Jackie's where a man is watching bizarre and racy films; the interior of Jackie's apartment -- almost suffocating in its primary colors, though roomy (too roomy for a secretary living in Manhattan), and she has ""secret"" rooms hidden behind gauzy drapes . . .
Their conversation rides the waves of innuendo, misunderstanding, defensiveness, Michael hiding behind Jackie's belief that many of his bizarre comments are just jokes, Jackie continually offering Michael more grace in the conversation than he deserves, Michael pretending he doesn't notice Jackie's advances, Jackie expressing herself in more ""simple"" terms than Michael's, Jackie revealing more and more about herself, and Michael folding deeper into Jackie's false perception of him . . . on and on until the emotion runs too high for one of them and results in a piercing honesty that feels like a ""halt"".
If your tastes run to ""action"" in films, this one will not fulfill you.  But if you like to watch people, if you enjoy seeing into others' lives, if you think you're the only one who is awkward and uncomfortable . . . if you've forgotten how to connect with others now that you're older . . .
This film is one of my top 20 favorite films.  I don't think it had a very wide run in the theatres but I remember seeing it reviewed by Siskel and Ebert and wanting to see it as soon as it was either at the theatre or on video in my town.  I'm one of those older people who has forgotten how to ""connect"" (at least, with men).  These two make me feel better.",997142400,26,3657,4.577335375191424
7857892,5,6303961703,"This movie was hard to find, but it was well worth the effort. While Tom Noonan made his character a little too awkward to be credible, Karen Sillas turned in a superb performance. All in all, the film is affecting and bears a second viewing.",1516838400,,242,4.4

7857894,4,6303961703,"Saw this when it first hit rental VHS... Even better this time. Creepy and touching at the same time.

Unfortunately, the SD video rental quality was like watching a VHS... poor quality... shadows... distracting.",1455926400,,212,5.235294117647059
7857895,5,6303961703,I was fortunate to see this in a theater when it came out and recimmended it frequently when I wirked at a video store through the 90s. If this is even released in DVD or Bluray I'll snap it ip immediately.,1452902400,,206,4.048780487804878

7857897,5,6303961703,"This is my single, all-time favorite movie. I've had to buy it twice now on VHS since unfortunately it was never released on DVD. Originally written as a play and later adapted for the film the writing, direction and acting is peerless. Tom Noonan and Karen Sillas are amazing and deliver their characters with incredible subtlety.",1433721600,3,331,4.928571428571429
7857898,4,6303961703,"A daring, minimilist indie that's exceptionally well-written, masterfully acted and just disturbing enough to make it a really lousy date night movie.",1415404800,,150,5.863636363636363

7857900,5,6303961703,"I first saw this film at the 92Y Tribeca theater in New York City, and following the screening there was a Q&A with Tom Noonan.  The film never saw a wide release, but fortunately it is now available on Amazon and Netflix.

Just watched it again and I found it even more impressive.  Karen Sillas's performance is stunning.  The cinematography is brilliant, and the script is exceptional.

Despite the bleakness of the setting and the existential lonliness of the characters, this is essentially an optimistic film, unfolding in real time, about two people who find a way to connect.",1346198400,3,583,4.848484848484849
7857901,5,6303961703,"...any scene in the movie resembling Karen Sillas' depiction on the slipcover (too dang bad!)
...an indication from Amazon.com or the vendor that the VHS tape I received would be a screening copy, not supposed to be for sale (subtitled to that effect several times during playback).

What Happened Was...
...a first date between two introverts, socially deviant in angular dichotomy.
...awkwardness, tension and angst.
...wonderful acting by Karen and Tom Noonan (also director).",1250899200,2,479,5.472972972972973
