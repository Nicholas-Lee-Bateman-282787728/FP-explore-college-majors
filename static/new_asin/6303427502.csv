640736,3,6303427502,"Though not quite as good as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wild-Horse-Mesa/dp/B000F0UUM8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wild Horse Mesa</a>, which was the only previous example of this series that I had seen, this low-rent BW Western has its points.  Gary Cooper, then 30 and still more or less confined to B-pictures, plays Clint Belmet, a young frontiersman who, with the Civil War raging back East, signs on, along with his mentors Bill Jackson (Ernest Torrance) and Jim Bridger (Tully Marshall), to guide a wagon train to the Coast.  The army is being withdrawn from the Western posts, making the trip doubly hazardous, and a spirited young woman named Felice (Lily Damita), granddaughter of one of Lafayette's officers, who is bound and determined she'll make it to California without any male help, complicates the picture still more when she helps Jackson and Bridger extract Clint from the clutches of a Missouri lawman (Charles Winninger).  The hard hand of nature is also against the wagoners as they struggle over rivers and mountains (internal hints suggest that they're taking a southern route, probably the old Santa Fe Trail).  Meanwhile Clint, uncomfortable with the concept of owing his precious liberty to a woman, is trying to strike a balance between his attraction and gratitude to Felice and his obligations to the two old men who've raised him.

Cooper here is clearly establishing the laconic, woman-shy persona he would bring to the screen in many films to come, while Damita (who, like Cooper, had begun in silents, mostly German and French ones, and ten years hence would become the mother of Errol Flynn's son Sean) plays off him well as a brave spitfire in love.  The movie also has the great advantage of having been filmed at a time when there were still many technical advisors around who had actually known the Old West, or at least heard of it from those who had; the wagons particularly are very authentic.  Perhaps the most enjoyable aspects are Torrance as the shambling Scotsman Jackson and Marshall as Bridger--they provide not only some good comic scenes but a certain pathos as representatives of a class of frontiersman quickly growing obsolete, yet well aware that without them the newly developing West could never have existed.",1299801600,5,2312,5.266304347826087
640737,2,6303427502,"This VCR movie was a disappointment to me.  I have the Zane Grey book this movie was made from, and Clint is entirely different from the way he was represented.  The storyline followed the book very loosely, and what was left out was important.  I feel sad if this is the only movie of that great book.",1297468800,,302,4.2631578947368425
640738,3,6303427502,"It would be unfair of me to be too critical of this 1931 movie which appeared early into the 'talkie' era of movies. And based on a Zane Grey novel of the late 1920s the fictional background is somewhat sound. That said, however, the major point of the scout becoming outdated by the railroad just is not true.  The railroads were not connected until four years after the Civil War in 1869 at Provo, Utah, but the era of the frontier scout continued up to and a little past 1890 at Wounded Knee in the Dakotas.

I have the latest 2 disc copy of The Big Trail so I am not unaware of that movie, but I see little resemblance between these two films, though the directors could not have been unaware of either Zane Grey's book or each other's movies.

For me the scenes of this movie are not tied together well and the resultant condition seems somewhat ragged, with Cooper being off screen almost as much as he is on.  Leaving his two scout mentors soaking up a lot of time on screen. And though the movie has its action moments, much of the time very little is really happening. One standout in the movie is Lili Damita, her role and her acting cannot be understated. Cooper is young without his later varnish, but much of what he will later become does show through. While Lili Damita is very accomplished and holds her own with all the actors.

I must attest also that I have several movies from the early and mid-1930s, 24 Hopalong Cassidy movies especially, and any of those are much better in their clarity and storyline. I also treasure the early John Wayne movies (20) that are in many places really not much above 'silent movies' with only music playing as the horses clamber over the plains. So it is just not the fact of this movie having a 1931 date that is uncomfortable to me, it is really the lack of cohesion and smoothness. Even the early Gene Autry movies are much more accomplished.

I read westerns as well as enjoy western movies, but I cannot give this effort more than 3 stars. It may just be my copy of the movie on DVD, but unless some scenes have been excised or edited out, for me the movie remains very uneven. It is a movie to see if you are at all interested in westerns or if you have an interest in early Hollywood black and white movies, or even early Gary Cooper. But for the general viewer I don't think this movie will afford them that much enjoyment.

640739,3,6303427502,"This film, Originally titled BLAZING ARROWS, is the first of several based upon a Zane Grey novel published only two years prior, and the version that is most faithful to the book, while being one of the largest budgeted Westerns of the early sound era, with the viewer advised to remember that the period of the narrative (1862) antedated its audience only to the extent that the Great Depression does to spectators today. The story tells of a caravan of freight wagons journeying from Independence, Missouri, to the West Coast during a pre-railroad time, with settlers accompanying, and the procession's four month struggle with hostile Indians, very harsh winter weather, forbidding terrain and renegade betrayal, and is particularly full of interesting detail as to the methods of the freightmen and their metier. Gary Cooper portrays Clint Belmet, a Missouri guide who has been reared and trained as a member of a successive generation of scouts and trappers by two veterans of the breed, Bill Jackson (Ernest Torrence) and Jim Bridger (Tully Marshall), who are unaware that their way of life is to be ended by an advancing intracontinental rail system, only temporarily slowed by the War Between the States. Because of plot circumstances, Belmet must pretend to be married to a lone traveller, Felice (Lily Damita), and their seesaw relationship provides one of the main themes of a wideranging scenario, with Belmet and his mentors trumpeting of the glories of their fading way of life while Felice seeks to inculcate within her swain a sense of domestic virtue. The cinematography of Lee Garmes is very effective with its images of the travails of the wagon train and his work is not compromised by the editing which is crisp and appropriate for a film as episodic as is this one. The work's most serious failing is a lack of a consistent point of view, as it is essentially a comedy, due largely to a highly effectual performance from Torrence, here permitted to utilize his native Scottish burr to its fullest, and is somewhat reduced in impact during scenes of action and romance as a result of only cursory emphasis upon each.",1187913600,,2138,4.941666666666666
640740,4,6303427502,"A semi-clone of ""The Big Trail"", Cooper takes over the spot DUKE played, as a frontiersman/guide for a wagon train.
While ""Fighting Caravans"" is not as expansive as ""The Big Trail"", and while the young Gary Cooper is no young John Wayne, this early western is pretty entertaining.
In the story, Cooper helps the wagon train fend off Indians and evil traders, while his two crusty companions try and save him from falling in love.
There's plenty of action, and there's even a hint of pre-code Hollywood, as Cooper's character practically attempts to blackmail his new sweetheart into fooling around with him.
Laserlight/Delta found a pretty fair print, but there are several missing frames. The image will occasionally ""black out"", but while annoying, does not interfere with viewing. Originally 92 minutes, this print seems to be more or less intact, missing perhaps two or three minutes.
The story moves along well, and the opening credits alone are pretty snazzy for 1931.
The film has much to recommend it, and while ""The Big Trail"" is superior, this early Cooper vehicle is worth adding to your western DVD collection. Especially for the low price the disc is being offered at, you should definitely pick this one up.
Film fans should look (or listen!), for Eugene Pallette, of ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" fame. He's here in a minor supporting role some seven years before he played Friar Tuck.",992131200,24,1401,4.940677966101695

640924,1,6303427502,Bearing little or no resemblance to Zane Grey's book. Video and sound quality were what you would expect from a film this old. In the book it follows the adventure of Clint Belmet from his teens to his late 20's. Gary Cooper is much too old for the part. The female part was not a French woman but a young girl from Clint's first wagon train trip. Kit Carson has been replaced by Jim Bridger etc. etc.  Having just finished reading the novel for my 4th or 5th time I was deeply disappointed.

641037,4,6303427502,"Gary Cooper, as a young scout-in-training with two crusty old mountain men as his mentors, falls for a lone woman (Lili Damita) driving a wagon on a massive caravan headed through treacherous terrain and Indian country to California but resists getting tied down. The romantic comedy elements are at odds with the epic action-adventure of the wagon train saga, all shot on location with dozens of wagons and horses and a large cast, but it's a curiously endearing film, enlivened by the antics of the bantering, hard-drinking, wise-cracking mountain men played by Ernest Torrence and Tully Marshall and the sincerity, spunk and determination of the French leading lady. It's fun to watch Cooper as a gangly, awkward, lovestruck youth before his screen persona had become hardened. Not for all tastes, but if you're a western fan, it's definitely an unusual experience and should prove quite rewarding.",1461024000,4,901,5.178082191780822

7846111,4,6303427502,"Never been a big fan of Zane Grey and I'm not sure how faithful this movie is to his original story but the plot of this movie is quite good. Not earth-shattering or anything, just very enjoyable and real. It both transcends its setting (the theme of change is applicable to every era) but is also grounded in the setting (the change is being caused by the railroads) to avoid being mercenary in its genre usage (i.e. it's not a parable disguised as a western, it is a western). In a small way, I felt like was watching a Shakespeare play set the Old West, especially where the characters are concerned (the two scouts especially felt like some Shakespearean duo).
On a technical level, I will forgo passing judgment on film quality as I understand the prints for this movie have had a rough journey. I would love to see a restored (and even colorized) edition come out. Some of the technical issues, however, are not the result of bad prints. I felt the actual battle was lacking in some ways, with the settlers and the Indians basically never sharing the screen together. Because the quality is so obviously different in the film, it takes a heap of believin' to imagine there is an actual battle. The only visual continuity is the renegade who betrays the wagon train.
I also found the score inconsistent in quality, though overall underwhelming. Granted, this was 1931 but then again for two decades silent films had some of the greatest film scores ever made (e.g. Metropolis [1927]) because the music was an essential part of the movies. If the movie is ever digitally restored, an improved soundtrack (in the spirit of the era) would be a nice addition.",1524268800,,1660,4.649659863945578

Also run closed captioning as two scouts that are Gary Cooper's guardians are not understandable otherwise.  There are three reasons to watch this film which is why I gave it three stars.  First, Gary Cooper's early films were more energetic and comical.  Second is the tension between him and Lita Davita, in her best of the few films she starred in.  And third:  the wagon scenes here show how the wagon trains really were like.  Double and triple wagons, ten to twenty mules to haul the heavy wagons.  And one of the rare early westerns NOT to have the wagons in a circle and the Natives riding around them which is just another Hollywood legend.  The movie follows a train leaving for Califonia but exactly which year is not stated.  Lincoln's call up of all western Cavalry was in 1861, Grant at Vicksburg 1863, and the railroads at civil war's end.  But the train has all the look of something in the early 1850's.
