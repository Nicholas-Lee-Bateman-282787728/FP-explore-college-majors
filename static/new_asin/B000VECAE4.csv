2939309,5,B000VECAE4,"If you're even looking at this, you're a fan of the show, so the fact that it's a hilarious show is out of the way. Let's talk about the set - it's perfect. The IPS truck design is great; you 'unload' the discs from the back, and the episode guide is under the hood in the front. Each season has a fold out CD-like case and they all fit in the back of the truck. It's seriously beautiful for fans of the show. Must buy if you don't own any of the seasons!",1195689600,32,455,3.903225806451613
2939310,5,B000VECAE4,"I own the entire collection, 1 thru 9. I am extremely disappointed however that none of the Season Sets come with any bloopers or outtakes. Kevin James is so funny, I would LOVE to see the bloopers. My question is, do I HAVE to buy the NEW box set for $200 in order to get the bonus blooper DVD, or will it become available to purchase seperately??? I would really love to add this to my collection. I've easily spent $180 collected the nine seasons. I doesn't seem right that the only way to get the blooper/outtake DVD is to spend an additional $200.",1194739200,10,552,4.3173076923076925

I like the way it cooks with very low water and anybody who is having any health problems should definitely use this kind of cookware. It is a good investment. I enjoy them.

2939425,3,B000VECAE4,"As far as the show goes... It's hilarious! As for the actual product... I personally hated the case and ended up buying a 32 disc CD zipper case to put all of them into. The case is pretty much 2 pegs that all the discs are stacked onto, kinda like when you buy a bunch of blank discs. I opened the box for the first time and like 6 discs just fell out onto the floor! They still work fine though. I also don't like the audio on this series.. I don't know if it's just mine, but several of the discs have very quiet sound, much quieter than other discs. I have found about 6 discs that have to be turned up more than twice as loud as other discs. I guess I would say for the price, it's all just fine. I wish they would have just put each season in its own case like most TV seasons come. It's a great TV show and I'm glad I have it, but the packaging and the audio are a let down.",1510358400,,881,3.8461538461538463

And then forces him to let her crazy-ass dad move in after he burns down his house, instead of committing him to a rest home.  He already caused his poor wife to drop dead from a heart attack.

Overshadowed, I guess by Everybody Loves Raymond and Seinfeld, but in my opinion much better.  Jerry Stiller's demented Arthur Spooner much much better and more well acted than his Frank Costanza, and he was in most episodes, unlike Seinfeld.  I can't believe this never won any awards.  Kevin James is hilarious, the camera work, shots and angles creative and the supporting cast truly unique.  Leah Remini can really act and she and Kevin are completely believable  as married to each other.",1486771200,2,633,5.1568627450980395

2939562,5,B000VECAE4,"I love this series and have been patiently waiting for it to be available to watch in HD. While it appears this is not going happen I did find the 'The King of Queens: The Complete Series HD ed Superbox"" which is essentially the HD version in German. First off, this is not an American region disc which means you will not be able to watch it on a standard American blu-ray player. Basically, I used a free software called MakeMKV to make a copy of each blu-ray disc and saved the files to my computer. Each disc is over 35 gigabytes large so if you want to make the files smaller you will have to use another free software like Handbrake which will essentially compress the files. After creating the video files on my computer I can either watch the files directly on my computer using the VideoLan VLC media player free software or play the files on my Roku using Plex. This was all a lot of work but very worth it for me. Keep in mind to copy the files from the blu-ray disc you must have drive that plays blu-ray on your computer (not necessarily a blu-ray writer, but that would work as well). You could also buy a region free blu-ray player and avoid all this work but my method worked best for my application. Other highlights of this product from my perspective include:

- Discs can be played in English. I believe it is Dolby 2.0. There are NOT any English subtitles though but if you are using Plex it would be easy to find some that are already out there.
- All discs, including Season 1, are 100% full screen 16:9 aspect ratio. The picture is really good for a series that started in 1998. There is some grain but its exponentially better than DVD box set that I had before that had the standard definition 4:3 aspect ratio.

I usually don't write reviews but I really love this series and wanted to share my solution to be able to enjoy the series in high definition.",1485907200,6,1881,4.325779036827195

When we are done, watching one DVD, we get the box, get out a new one, put the other one back and the box goes back on the shelf. What else would I do with it, so that the DVDs would fly around and get scratches?
It arrived with all DVDs in place and they do not fall out, when I handle the box in my hands. I think that 30 Dollars for the entire series is a great deal and the packaging is just fine!",1485302400,,478,3.8877551020408165

I didn't give 5 stars only because of the way the discs are stored in the case. You know how when you buy a bunch of blank discs they're on a peg and can slide up and down?

The design of the packaging kills me though. It's such a bad packaging design. All the DVD's sit on top of each other on a spindle. You have to take them all out to get to any of them and when you set it upright, they tend fall out. Terrible. Other than that, the series is worth the headache of the packaging.

I caught a couple of random episodes over the years and never really got into till recently. I went ahead and bought all the seasons. So funny and really care about the characters. I watched the last episode today. I'm glad I bought this TV show because it's one of the best and sad that it only had 8 and a half season. I know it has 9 seasons, I just don't consider 12 episodes a true american season. I would of liked KoQs to get a couple more years on air. Yes the video quality is a bit grainy and the sound is fine.",1472428800,2,640,3.856060606060606
2939668,3,B000VECAE4,"I can only give this DVD set 3 stars because the video (transfer) quality is quite lacking. Although the coloring looks fine, there is a definite blur/grainy picture. Also, not having CC is cut-rate at best or just insensitive to those who are hearing impaired. [For those who may not know: Subtitles are accessible/available through composite/component connections.]

Anyway, as for the series, I always enjoyed the laughs (a strong 4+ stars) and now I can watch a few episodes here and there for a good laugh and more.

So, although I give this DVD set only 3 stars for its overall features and quality, I think The King of Queens is a great sitcom and worth the low cost especially if you like the show and haven't really seen all the episodes.",1472256000,3,747,4.651515151515151

All the characters that were so quirky in the beginning become caricatures of their worst qualities. Can't believe this show stayed on the air for so long! I think the only reason it did is because it was the last of it's kind, a supposedly family sitcom. Everybody Loves Raymond is much better done for all 9 seasons.

2939698,3,B000VECAE4,"If Seinfeld was all about Manhattan, TKOQ takes Funny to the 'burbs. This show had its own identity and, like Seinfeld, though shot primarily in Cali, its flavor was uniquely New York. Also like Seinfeld it featured the comic genius of Jerry Stiller, who was worth his weight in hilarious outtakes. The packaging coulda/shoulda been better. Nine seasons stacked together like Doug's pancakes. And nowhere on the packaging is there a photo of Victor Williams who played Doug's best friend, Deacon. Every other main actor is there: Spence and Danny... even a shot of the house. But no Deacon. To a fan, that's an unforgivable omission. I can't imagine a DVD package of Jackie Gleason's The Honeymooners without a mention of Art Carney. Granted, the show is very funny at times. You can't fake the Funny, and it's timeless. But by skipping over Victor Williams' contribution, for me, it says a lot about the producers of TKOQ. If they re-assembled this package to only include episodes without Deacon, the pack would be reduced to 2 or 3 shows. That's the importance of Mr. Williams.",1468627200,4,1080,4.875
2939699,5,B000VECAE4,"King of Queens is my all time favorite go-to sitcom.  I could watch this show over and over again.  The story follows Doug & Carrie Heffernan from Queens, NY.  Doug, an ""IPS"" (think UPS) driver and Carrie a legal secretary own a home which also includes Carrie's father, Arthur, who lives in their basement.  Notable guests include ""Ray Barone"" (Ray Romano, Everybody Loves Raymond), ""Marie Barone"" (Doris Roberts, Everybody Loves Raymond) and ""Tim Sacksky"" (Bryan Cranston who played Walter White on Breaking Bad) just to name a few.",1468627200,,534,5.034090909090909

2939702,5,B000VECAE4,"One of my favorite sitcoms. We have the channels that have the reruns on them, but they play them out of order, even out of season. I knew ahead of time that there was the other edition of this set, but I mainly buy these sitcom sets as something to watch when we are sitting around as a family. Our kids, now 12 and 14, still go around singing the ""Doug and Carrie"" song. I wouldn't know if all episodes are included, but will say, if you watch it all the way through, you can see/feel the series losing its steam by the last two seasons. I've always wondered if the show would have been better with a different Carrie. The actress that plays Carrie (Leah Remini), was pregnant in real-life during some of the later episodes and she seems to struggle with it. To put it mildly, I think she's annoying in those later seasons. Her Jersey girl attitude is usually annoying, but funny, kind of cute even, but in those later seasons, it just comes off wrong. Kevin James is good throughout the series as is Jerry Stiller (Arthur), the rest of the cast does a good job of making the main characters better. Overall, it's one of the better sitcoms of the last 20 years.",1468368000,6,1163,4.339449541284404
2939703,5,B000VECAE4,"Great investment!

Product Description: Comes with 27-discs Seasons 1-9 complete (4555 minutes = 76 hrs). (Review for DVD set not Blue ray). Comes in box set  8""h x 5.5""w x 3"" depth
Case folds out and has 2 separate dvd holders that hold all discs tightly together. Not the best quality for long term but if they are sitting on a shelf and not getting moved much they will be ok.

Price: I bought this for $24.99. Following this product's price since 2011 is $46.23 and lowest was 17.99 for a day. The average price is $32. This product value isn't much over $30 so anything under that is a great deal worth buying.

Quality: For the die hard fans this is a great show that started airing on CBS in the late 90s and ran until 2007. So for millenials you have to remember this show was as new as dial up so don't be surprised when show references and video quality are worse then your iphone. Its great to watch the evolution of cinematography and progression of quality (as well as show jokes) over the 9 seasons.

Usability: Personally I took all the discs and put them on one side of the case and as I watch them I flip them over to the other side of the case. Im sure by the time I finish this series DVDs will be obsolete (which I fully support - I like the digital copies I just hate all the proprietary software around it)

Im a fan of the show and it's wonderful to not have to watch it with all the commercials. Great product! Great buy under $30 especially for 76 hours of Doug and Carrie Heffernan",1468281600,29,1507,4.2334494773519165

With some series, there may be a season or two, where filler takes over and it seems like the writers were out to lunch. But, now this one! King of Queens is definitely on the top 10 list, of not the top 5!

Whereas, this is most definitely true, it did not interfere with my viewing experience, nor did it make me regret my purchase.

For the whiners that gave negative reviews on this product- I understand your dilemma, but there is truly nothing to complain about. Sound is good, the picture is good (I got the DVD, not the bluray), it all comes in one box set, and the price was unsurpassed!

Ten years ago, this show was going for 20 bucks a season (with 4-5 seasons under my belt). In the here and now, I got my set for 25.oo total! And it was here in 2 days!

Was looking forward to the BD collection of The King of Queens after watching my DVD collection for so many years. Popped in a Season 9 disc and I immediately noticed that the audio/video was sped up from what I was used to. I compared it to the same episode from my DVD collection and the BD version is definitely sped up 3-5%. For me it was too distracting because it just seemed to be moving too fast now and everyone's voices were slightly higher now. Thing is that the episodes on Season 1 and 2 of this BD set were at the correct speed. So not sure why in the production of these discs that later seasons were sped up slightly. Picture quality was definitely better but also seemed a little more grainy than i'm used to for a BD release. Overall I was sadly disappointed by the quality and had to return them.

I put the cases on display but keep my discs tucked away.. safer that way as well.. I don't know if buying this set is necessary. I would have had it been out when I was looking..

The box set is basically made of two spindles that hold all the discs. Not the best way to package an entire 9 season tv series. That's why I docked one star.

2939835,5,B000VECAE4,"I have watched and rewatched the $40 spindle set several times in the past 2+ years and never had a problem with how the discs are stored.  It's a little trouble to get to the discs further down, sure, but it's a great savings that's well worth the trouble, in my opinion.

The discs have never scratched (and I've moved the box around many times) because the cardboard pieces that fit on top of the discs (to keep them in place) has worked well in my experience.

When it arrived, one of the two plastic disc holders was loose from the cardboard but the other is still secure.  And the one that's loose isn't an issue for me, personally, because it never falls out of the cardboard container (and, actually, it's sometimes convenient to remove it when putting in or taking off a disc from the spindles).  Really, I have an easier time getting out the disc I want from this packaging than I do with a few other more ""well-designed"" and supposedly superior packaging of some other series.",1451606400,,987,4.4916201117318435
2939836,1,B000VECAE4,"I love the show, but this DVD set has problems. The box contains 27 DVDs on 2 spindles. Combine this with Amazon's irresponsible packing and you get a bunch of scratched DVDs. Amazon used a box that just barely fit the DVDs, but decided to stuff paper inside to where the box was swelled. After opening the box and pulling out the DVD case, you could hear the DVDs moving around inside. I immediately opened the case and began inspecting each DVD. There were a number of them with scratches, but some of them had deep scuffs on them, which made the DVDs unplayable. I've since gotten a refund.",1451520000,2,593,4.4495412844036695

Other than that it is a nice set and cute pictures on the box.",1450742400,,390,3.949367088607595
2939848,4,B000VECAE4,"I am a longtime fan of The King of Queens. In 2005, I popped in the Season 1 DVD that belonged to my parents, and the show quickly grew on me. The characters are almost always hilarious, and Carrie and Arthur are my favorites, although my family finds ourselves quoting Doug just as often (...""haven't we been needing a speedboat...??""). Nowadays, I consider it my #2 favorite show of all time (right behind Friends). My mom owns all nine seasons, but those DVDs have been lost in the move for a while, so last Christmas, seeing this set for around $20ish dollars was a great value. I'm old enough now to have my own set :p

The show is still as great as I remember. Now, I don't know how important it is to others, but the packaging of TV seasons on DVD is important when deciding if I buy. To me, the gold standard is the Friends model of the seasons that were released on DVD between 2002 and 2005. They had a great design, plus just enough information about the episodes, plus the air dates (very important for geeks like me). So this design was a slight letdown, largely because of how the discs are in two stacks that you have to carefully sift through in order to find the DVD you want (although the discs keep the same design as the season sets, which was a nice flashback for me). Like other reviewers, I strongly recommend refraining from throwing the piece of cardboard away that keeps the discs from falling out. This set has a list of all the episodes in all nine seasons, but the episode titles are incredibly vague (another reason I appreciated the episode descriptions booklet in the season sets), so you may have a hard time trying to find a certain episode if you don't already know the title.

I'm not a huge fan of the images throughout the set, but I suppose they get the job done. Some of them are clearly copied and pasted from the show on top of an ugly reddish-yellow backdrop, and I don't really like the image of the Heffernan household that you get when you open the set. Also, this may be nitpicky, but on the back of the box, you see three screencaps from the show, all from one of the later seasons. These are the same three images that they had on one of the season sets (I can't remember which), and because this is a ""complete series"" set, I wish they had chosen images that span the entire run of the show.

I know I have complained a lot about the packaging, so please don't think I'm hating on the show, because the show quality really holds up well. The picture isn't Blu-Ray clear, obviously, but it's more than sufficient. I am gonna dock one star for the sub-par packaging, though.",1450569600,,2622,4.368852459016393

2939852,5,B000VECAE4,"The King of Queens is one of my favorite comedy series ever! I just couldn't resist purchasing this when Amazon dropped the price to just above $22 to be able to re-live all the moments. That's about the price you would pay for a new movie released on physical copy! I just kind of wish there was a HD re-make of the series as nowadays as we live in the HD age of 1080P, huge flat screen televisions, and pushing towards 4k resolutions. But I'll deal with the standard resolution (1.33:1) for seasons 1-6 and (1.75:1) for seasons 7-9.

Also I would advise that you keep the cardboard cut-outs that are used to hold the discs down after you open up the set. :)",1450396800,,659,4.314516129032258

But that's not the problem Season 2 disc 1 has the same episodes on it so that means I have two of the same episodes.

2939900,2,B000VECAE4,"so i purchased this as a birthday present for my boyfriend, he's a giant fan of 'king of queens' right?
he opens it today and we find out that it's in GERMAN. :| i thought i had gone over this product and amazon page pretty thoroughly and nowhere on here did it say it would be or even hinted that german might be a possibility. i'm pretty disappointed but he thought it was hilarious and loved it still. he confirmed that the actual episodes are in english but the menus aren't.

i can only assume the bonus features will follow suit :\ which is why i can only give this 2 stars.

but aside from all that i have to say the packaging is quirky and clever (which was part of the reason why i chose it). the package arrived in a timely manner and in perfect condition, brand-spankin'-new lol. sooo it looks like either he'll embrace the german side of things or i'll be makin' an exchange in the near future lol.",1442880000,,910,4.254335260115607

The discs aren't organized in a convenient fashion (whole series is divided into two stacks of discs) but for the price and quality of the video material that's not worth complaining about.

If you're a fan of Doug, Carrie, Arthur, Deacon, Spence, and the rest of the gang, what are you waiting for? Sure, stations like TV Land & TBS often air the reruns of this masterfully crafted series, but for $32.99 there's nothing better than being able to watch anytime you'd like. If you're not a fan of the show or have never watched it before from start to finish, I'd seriously advice you make the purchase immediately. It'll be the best $32.99 you spend.

The fact that this series only sells for $32.99 is almost bananas in my book, but, I was more than happy to reap the benefits of the deal and make the purchase.",1440028800,,726,4.330882352941177

Why this isn't available for streaming is beyond me, but why you should oppose any organization ending in ""AA"" (RIAA, MPAA, etc). AA is for anti-artist. Some day, we will pay a fair price to view the shows we like. I don't have a problem with $25 for the entire KOQ series. I miss them, but enjoy Kevin's other work.

We bought this because we like to watch the reruns on TBS and TV Land but they don't show then entire episode.  They cut out 30 seconds to a minute of the show so they can add more commercials.  Plus, TV Land adds so many more commercials that a 23 minute episode takes 40 minutes to watch.

It definitely isn't the IPS truck set, which obviously looks much cooler, but if the show is all you want to see, you can't go wrong here! It would be awesome if they made King of Queens in Blu-Ray for Region 1 or one that wasn't region-free and $280+, but that doesn't relate here and is another discussion altogether.

A must have for fans of this Series and many more laughs to come even when viewing the same shows over and over.  It keeps getting better; especially when one can afford it.  Cannot go wrong.  Not at all.  A national chain sells this exact Series for sixty dollars.  For thirty dollars is a must have.,1426550400,,437,4.2560975609756095
2940131,4,B000VECAE4,Some of the discs had repeating shows. I was confused. I also did not like how all the discs just go in a pile in the case.

2940134,5,B000VECAE4,"Once in a while, a TV series will catch lightning in a bottle, with an interesting premise, intelligent writing, and a stellar cast. ""The King Of Queens"" was one of those series.  International Parcel Service delivery driver Doug Heffernan (Kevin James), and his wife Carrie (Leah Remini) are, in some ways, a modern version of Ralph and Alice Kramden from ""The Honeymooners.""  The main differences are with regards to Carrie, who works outside of the home, and clearly wears the pants in the family.  Living with them is Carrie's father Arthur Spooner, played by the brilliant comedic actor Jerry Stiller.  Another interesting character is Spence Olchin, played by stand-up comedian Patton Oswalt.  I was fortunate enough to see Patton perform live in Boston, and he was absolutely hilarious.  Jerry and Patton are great as second bananas in this series.  They could have easily been the lead characters in a spin-off show, which could have been called, ""I'm Spooner, He's Olchin.""  Other important cast members include Doug's best friend Deacon Palmer (Victor Williams), Doug's cousin Danny Heffernan (Gary Valentine), dog (and Arthur) walker Holly Shumpert (Nicole Sullivan), and hulking neighbor Lou Ferrigno.

My favorite episode is ""Life Sentence,"" from the fourth season.  In that episode, Arthur returns homes from the hospital, after having had an angioplasty.  Doug and Carrie install a nanny-cam in the basement, in order to keep an eye on Arthur.  Danny, Deacon and Spence are watching the television set in Doug's garage.  While changing channels, they see Arthur on television.  Enthralled, they end up watching Arthur all night long.  Meanwhile, Doug and Carrie are finalizing their life insurance plan.  Carrie decides that if she died, Arthur should still live with Doug.  Doug thinks that's a crazy idea.  Arguing over who will die first, Carrie smokes a cigarette, while Doug devours a spray can of whipped cream.  Arthur makes an impassioned speech about how happy he was to get out of the hospital, and move back home with them.  They all realize that, despite the constant arguing and craziness, they all really love each other.  They conclude with a group hug, which nearly brings Danny, Deacon and Spence to tears.  For me, that perfectly encapsulates the spirit of the show.

On the plus side, a disc of bonus features includes a"" Series Retrospective,"" ""Thanks To The Fans,"" a ""200th Episode Celebration,"" ""The Writers Of The King Of Queens,"" and ""Character Profiles.""  On the negative side, the fold-out box consists of two plastic spindles, with two rows of discs piled one on top of the other, without any protection.  I'm happy to report that none of the discs I played were scratched or defective in any way.  In addition, the audio and video qualities of the episodes were very good.  For the bargain price it's selling for, I definitely recommend buying the complete series box set of ""The King Of Queens.""",1425945600,2,2939,5.056133056133056

2940138,4,B000VECAE4,"I just got the set today and started ripping them to my video server. When I checked the Episode numbers, they were out of sequence. So far the errors are within the seasons. It's a great show and doesn't generally have a sequential story line so I guess that's not such a big deal. I guess you get what you pay for and these were a real bargain. Having to decode the Ep#s for each is kind of annoying since there seemed to be no logical reason to put stuff where they did.

As I do the transfer, I'm finding one extra item on each disk; disk one had a 30 minute cast interview, disk two had a camera following Kevin James as he was out and about promoting the second season and DVD for same.

That is counter to another reviewer who stated that there were no extras.",1425081600,,767,4.140939597315437

It would be a wise idea to keep the cardboard inserts if you plan to keep the dvds in the box. It helps hold them in place. Other than that it is the same hilarious comedy show.

About the packaging, they save a lot of space by having the discs loose, but it's not in a slide or a bag or anything, it's like a long plastic finger that goes thru all the discs and holds them in place, one on each side of the box that folds outwards. It's OK I guess, at least you can control if the discs come out scratched or not. You have no choice if it's one of those slip case deals you HAVE to slide the disc out and risk getting scratched on the cardboard. But the way ours was packed, is nice. Only thing is you have to pull out a whole bunch of discs and FIND the exact season and disc you want.

But the packaging isn't a drawback, for us anyway, at ALL. Kevin James at his prime is always fun, and we especially love the tie-in with Everybody Loves Raymond.",1412380800,,1020,4.044554455445544

Who would have thought that I would come to love his spinoff show even more?  The King of Queens is a riot.  I still have not gotten tired of watching it after all these years, even though I no longer watch Raymond.  He has the perfect cast with Leah Remini as his wife, Carrie and Jerry Stiller (yes, Ben's father) as his father-in-law, Arthur; all living together in a NY brownstone house.  Even Anne Meara (Jerry's longtime wife and Ben's mother) joins the cast in many episodes as a lonely widow with a very strange, quirky son; Patton Oswalt.  (Who could ever forget the comedy team of Stiller and Meara back in the day?)  I was happy to see Nicole Sullivan join the cast too as Arthur's 'walker'.  (I loved her on Mad TV.)  I have since become a big fan of James's and enjoy his movies.  This series is a 'must see'.",1409788800,,956,4.350282485875706

My solution, take all the disks off the spindles, put them in double-sided CD holders (I've got bunches of them all over the place!), remove the spindles and put the disks in the box.  Works for me as I bought this set for the show, not a cutesy truck box that probably won't fit well on any shelf.
 ..... Now to the series.  How can you not like watching these people with all their flaws and foibles?  They're hilarious.  I just wouldn't want them for neighbors, but isn't that the case with so many sit com families?  I'm glad I have this set and enjoy it.  Enough said.

Here's a tip though, the price on this item seems to fluctuate. We saw it at $25 and free super saver shipping, but when we were ready to buy it had gone up significantly. I waited and watched and eventually it came back down to 25 so I bought it. It was worth the wait because I really hate overpaying for things.",1405036800,2,433,4.166666666666667

This is a far cry from Blu Ray quality, but I can't see myself spending almost $300.00 for a German Blu Ray import.

Lots of people complain about the packaging, however that doesn't really bother me. What  bothers me is that I'm on season 4 and already, ive noticed some episodes being on here twice. The first one was when Carrie, gets her office/Doug staples himself. It was on season one, and then again in season two. And the theres the christmas episode where Doug give Carrie the Camera, and she receives a better one from work. First it was on season 2, and then again on season 4. Its ridiculous.

2940737,5,B000VECAE4,"There are few TV shows that I miss, but this is one. It has many of the same motifs as its contemporaries. Doug is the bumbling deliveryman that is the central comedian, Carrie is the abrasively loving wife, and Arthur is the peripheral father that lives in the basement and reveals his eccentricities. Also in the mix are lovable characters, notably their friend couple, Doug's cousin, and Arthur's walker.

What sets this series apart is the chemistry of the actors, specifically Doug and Carrie. You believe they could actually be a couple, supposing of course Carrie could get over Doug's eating. Each episode is enjoyable and, in the way of all sitcoms, are premised on real situations.

This is one of the few sets you should pick up. I worried that it wouldn't be like some of the major series such as the Sopranos, Friends, Simpsons, etc., that I'm confident will always be available in some format. For me it was worth the $40 to buy this used and have them to watch over and over.

It's a light-hearted comedy, and we can relate to it so much more than any other show out there (we are married with no kids).  Comedy sitcoms tend to be about a married couple with kids, or a group of twenty-somethings that hang out together and never seem to have to work.  This job is about a married couple with no kids, that deal with ordinary issues.  They might spend a Saturday night at home watching TV.  They both work, and the show incorporates this into the plot.  They have Carrie's dad living with them and have a few good friends.

2940768,4,B000VECAE4,"The show is wonderful. Kevin James is lovable, Leah Remini is sarcastic, and Jerry Stiller is downright hilarious. Similar to ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" (Ray and his family guest star in a few episodes).

For parents or those concerned about content, the show is, for the most part, clean. There are many sexual references and innuendoes, but they are mild and not as prominent as ""Friends"" or ""How I Met Your Mother,"" or even ""Cheers"" for that matter. Again, consider ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" as a reference. Language is mild. Almost no violence.

Now to the product itself. The discs work, but the packaging is terrible (not Amazon's fault). There are 2 ""stacks"" of discs, allowing them to rub up against each other. The cardboard and paper outer packaging is weak. The plastic ""stacking"" packages were lazily glued onto the box, and were unattached when I opened the product.

Worth the price if you enjoy the show. I recommend purchasing a sleeved dvd or cd case immediately upon arrival, so as not to destroy the discs.

Enjoy with caution.",1388620800,,1045,4.887005649717514

Since he is an UPS driver himself he can related to some of the on job obstacles Doug goes through on the job. So I knew this will be a great gift for him. The only reason I gave it 4 stars cause of the disc on top of each other but that is no biggie. You can't beat the price. I rather pay this price than $100 or more bucks and it's even more for Blu-ray Disc. He still gets to see the show just like the other disc just less money.

This was one of my favorite sitcoms and I now have the whole series.  Some of the scenes with Arthur turn out to steal the show,  Carrie with her sarcastic lines and ""don't take any crap"" attitude and Doug's antics make for a great show.  I look forward each night to getting a little free time to catch about 3 or 4 episodes.

2940794,5,B000VECAE4,"This series' reruns were moved to a graveyard timeslot on a local channel, so I got on Amazon to see what it would cost for the DVDs. I could not believe I could buy the ENTIRE series for less than $25.00!!! This a such a great sitcom, and the best part is the interaction between Doug and Carrie... Kevin James and Leah Remini are the best husband wife duo since the Honeymooners (and I really like them better than Ralph and Alice, and that's saying a lot)

And I confess, I am not the geekanerd type to get upset over packaging. I am not a collector, I just want to watch the show. If you are like me, the packaging will be discarded anyway and the DVDs put in a box, just safe enough to keep from being damaged, but not showy in the least.

So if you want to watch one of the funniest sitcoms of all time, but don't care about what they come in, you are in for a loooooong treat... nine seasons worth at a ridiculous price per episode. I just wish Remini and James would get together someday and revisit their fantasy lives as Doug and Carrie Heffernan. The two of them crack me up even in reruns I have seen several times.",1386979200,,1127,4.165137614678899
2940795,4,B000VECAE4,"If you love the show, this is by far the easiest and least expensive option.  The only downside is the way the discs are packaged. This is one large box that folds open in the middle.  On each side are a stack of discs representing about half the series. There is nothing separating the discs from one another.  Not only does it seem this could damage the discs over time, there is no convenient way to get to a disc in the middle of the pile. For instance, to get to the 2nd season, disc 3, you have to remove all the discs on top of it in the pile.  I've seriously considered putting all the discs in their own jewel cases.",1386979200,,625,4.098360655737705

2940797,4,B000VECAE4,This is my all time favorite sitcom. I feel it is very underrated. I bought the $25 package and for that price I still feel this is an amazing steal.

2940799,5,B000VECAE4,"I feel King of Queens is vastly underrated when it comes to naming some of the top comedy series of all-time. KoQ was an extremely funny series, with down-to-earth relatable and lovable characters. To deliver such high quality over nine seasons is quite an achievement. Many other comedy series would start running out of gas much earlier, but not KoQ. Kevin James, Leah Remini, and Jerry Stiller were one of those ""once-in-a-lifetime"" teamings and they never failed to deliver. To now have the complete nine seasons in one package for such a low price is deal that cannot be passed up.

Could the packaging have been better? Sure, but then you'd be paying a lot more. And this fuss over spindles? All the DVDs being on two spindles is not an issue if you take just the least amount of effort to be careful with them.

Overall, I couldn't be happier having this affordable package of all nine seasons of one of my all-time favorite shows.",1386547200,2,938,4.644578313253012

2940840,2,B000VECAE4,"ok first off, its not the sellers fault its a bad product so lets just get this out the way.
secondly the dvds were all jumbled up in to contanors... i checked online for other reviews and people seem to hate that too.
ok what you have actually purchased is a teleivison show about selfish people presented as a family comedy.
before i go in on it. i want to say that they hired GREAT ACTORS! but the actors can only read the script! the show is ridiculous and makes no sense. carrie has a sister who suddenly disappears and now all of the sudden she is the only child. i mean no creativity with the writing what so ever no say, ""oh the sister became a bug star and forgot about the family"" her sister was a striving actress.
doug and carrie take turns being the bad guy in this series. whihc is not cute at all. i bought this thinking the show was actually better than the few episodes i saw on television but it wasn't it was somewhat offensive!
if you are looking for the laughs season 3 4 and some of 5 are the funniest. but i will double check and update my review.
people proclaim this show is underrated, no its right where its supposed to be drifting off into oblivion!
there are so many typos in this series its not even funny. i could see a few mistakes but they did it so much half the time it felt like i was watching another show like""when did this happen"" ""i thought their neighbors moved. i thought they had a dog"" you know stupid stuff like that.
the episode that bothered me as a fan of the show was when carrie was being a complete idiot to the neighbors and the decided to bring a pool. so she used all of her legal knowledge to bully them into getting rifd of the pool. the scene where she is hot and takes a di[ in tier pool while they are not looking reminds me of a porno. she then of course after she is caught gives them their summons. i mean both doug AND carrie are bad people and thats really sad that shows like these are promoted and givin success. you can make good television with out doing that you know what i mean, but i don't believe in promoting selfish relationships bullies and bad friends ships. they are noesy people who cant mind their own business. i gues in some twisted way this may help a person who KNOWS people like that and can see ""well how can i get them to stop bothering me""? this show take you into the inside of what its like to be a spoiled bad person. and for educational purposes i would recommend this show.
otr than that i was very disappointed int he show.
the actors where great though and its really sad that these actors weren't given something better to act.
this dvd was somewhat cheaply made as i said two containers for the dvds? WTF! there are behind the scenes footages and that was really nice seeing the actors be them selves. but you cant change the terrible series finally!",1381708800,,2847,4.225688073394496
2940851,5,B000VECAE4,Non-stop humor and all packaged together at a good price. Go pick this up and start laughing immediately. Two thumbs up !!,1381622400,,122,4.590909090909091
2940852,5,B000VECAE4,This has to be one of my favorite shows of all time. I love that I have all the discs in one easy place! And the price was great!,1381449600,,129,3.4827586206896552
2940853,4,B000VECAE4,"When Amazon offered the complete King Of Queens DVD series for $30 dollars with free shipping it appeared to be a sweet deal so I took the bait. Even with free shipping I got my package within three days.

The DVD's are of adequate quality. If you ever played standard definition content on an HD television the results on screen can be somewhat substandard. But this is not the fault of the discs themselves. I was concerned at first because the opening montage made of outdoor shots looked particularly bad, however the episodes themselves look just fine for standard definition, perhaps helped out by on set lighting.

Thanks to some other reviews I was forewarned about the simplistic package design. All the DVD's are stacked on top of each other on two spindles. This could lead to scratches and possible disc damage if one is not careful. It is also a pain to rifle through the spindles if the disc you want is near the bottom of the stack.  But you get what you pay for.

I did find some bizarre issues regarding the content on some discs and the printed episode guide on the flaps of the cardboard fold out. Not all episodes are listed (though the set is complete) and some episodes are hidden!

Take season one disc 3. On the fold out the print material lists only 3 episodes on that disc. However I discovered if you go into menu and choose ""Special Features"" there are two ""Bonus"" episodes hidden within! How can there be bonus episodes if the package contains the ""complete"" series? You can't find these ""hidden"" episodes if you go into ""Episode Selections"" where you can choose which episode to watch. There are only three listed. ""Time Share"", ""Art House"", and ""Maybe Baby"".

To find the additional episodes neither listed in the print material or in ""Episode Selections"" you must go into ""Special Features"" and choose ""Bonus Episodes"". Here you will find ""Assaulted Nuts"" and ""Better Camera"".  Again I have no idea why these two episodes are not included in the ""Episode Selections"" or why they are not listed in the print material. Since this review is for the first three discs only,I don't know if there are other ""hidden"" episodes on other discs.

There's one feature I like. The opening theme song and montage plays only once per disc. If I am watching two, three or four episodes in one sitting I don't need to see the opening montage over and over again. (which is usually the case with episodic shows on disc) For King of Queens, the theme song and montage plays once then episodes play in a row uninterrupted.

The DVD's appear to play fine in a DVD player as well as on a Mac computer. I haven't tested them on a Blu Ray player yet. I give this four stars out of five because you get your bang for the buck. If you want better packaging buy the individual seasons. Over all I am very satisfied with the purchase.",1381104000,3,2838,4.5599214145383105
2940854,4,B000VECAE4,"OBVIOUSLY ITS THE FULL SERIES AND THE DVDS ARE IN GOOD CONDITION (ITS NEW) SO THEY SHOULD BE.

WE ARE GOING TO GET A DVD BINDER AND PUT THEM IN THERE SO THEY HAVE THEIR OWN SLOTS AND THEY DON'T GET SCRATCHED. BESIDES THAT, I WOULD RECOMMEND THESE TO ANYONE.

My only complaint is the spindle style packaging the collection came in. As you watch the dvd's, you have to take out the entire stack of DVD's you already viewed to get to the next one. I also have some concerns over whether the DVD's could become damaged from so much handling(taking them out of the package and putting them back in. Also they are stacked one on top of the other with nothing between the discs for protection). It seems like a poor design to me. Otherwise, the characters are interesting with lots of comedy and heartwarming moments. I am happy to own this collection.",1380672000,,705,4.515625

That is kind of a pain but no biggie. I got this for $28 for the whole set so I thought it was a deal! Came on time & just how described.,1380153600,,480,3.4128440366972477

One thing I don't really like about the show, though, is the way women get symbolized. Which goes to show it is mostly men that produced this TV show.

2940886,5,B000VECAE4,"Well, first off, let me just say that I've only watched the first two episodes from Season one, and (contrary to some of the negative reviews), the picture was fine! Mind you, it may not have been quite as sharp as some of the finest quality DVDs I have, but then again, I'm not so sure I would have even noticed any (slight) lack of quality, if I hadn't read those particular reviews!
But really, for $33.33 (when it's on sale here) for almost 76 hours of one of the funniest and wittiest comedies in television history, with decent video and sound quality- it's difficult to complain! But there is a solution to the one problem that pretty much everyone seems to agree on- the now infamous: 'two spindles'!
But before I forget, I also wanted to mention that every single disc is in great condition, and there are no duplicates, etc.
Now, about those 'spindles'.....
I can fully understand why people would be irked at having to constantly remove and replace several DVDs on two separate spindles (my plastic cases came unglued as soon as I opened the box, though, luckily, the discs stayed on the spindles!), just to search for one particular disc!
However, before even ordering this set, I remembered that I had bought a bulk package of thin, clear, double DVD slim cases years ago from Best Buy or somewhere for about $10, which I hadn't even opened! So, upon opening the box set, I started examining, then placing each disc in the cases (two discs per case). I managed to fit eleven of the slim double cases snuggly in the box, though ten is a little more comfortable, with the remaining four cases containing the remaining DVDs, outside, and beside the box. So there! No problem! Don't have to rummage through the two piles! Try Best Buy, or here on Amazon (just checked- they do have them), and get a package of slim DVD cases. You'll be glad you did!
P.S. I've included a photo of how nicely the discs fit into the original box, in the slim cases. (click on the customer image thumbnails, just beneath the picture of the DVD set)",1376352000,74,2037,4.538043478260869

2940888,5,B000VECAE4,"My guess is that the Leah Remini character said 'What are you talking about?' about a hundred times throughout this series to her husband played by Kevin James. Did it get old? No. It only got funnier.

I admit I bought this series mostly because it was for just $22.99 but what a bargain even at the normal price. I never once watched this series when it was on and now I'm sad I missed it. It is a genuinely laugh out loud comedy. It doesn't pretend to be anything deeper than that, even though at times it does go deeper and scores on drama. But, smartly, it never hangs out there very long. This is not MASH where the drama eventually overpowered the comedy and, to me, the entertainment value.

King of Queens goes for laughs and it succeeds. Kevin James is perfect as the everyman who says and does all the things we all wish we could. He loves his football, pizza and beer. His wife mostly plays the straight 'man' but Leah Remini is also outstanding throughout. She is an unusual mixture of model looks with a NY attitude.

The supporting cast is hit or miss for the first few seasons as they find their places later on but of course it was a stroke of genius to have Jerry Stiller cast as Leah Remini's father. He can make any line funny. I've never seen anyone like him.

I believe there are about twenty seven discs in all half stacked on the left and the other half on the right of this book like box that opens like a book.  I was not too sure about this set up when I was considering buying this box set but for the price I went ahead and made the purchase.  It really works for me as I have been traveling lately and I just grab the box and I am out he door.  Easy to carry around verses having to buy each season individually and having to decide which season to take with you on a trip.  I have really enjoyed this as I am a big fan of the show now but never watched before syndication.  I believe this is the way to go if you are considering the entire series.  I really LIKE IT and the price can't be beat.,1375142400,2,802,3.8834355828220857

2940912,4,B000VECAE4,"Sound quality was mediocre, too loud on the introductions and volume during conversations was too low.

The King of Queens series was a hilarious show.  I never viewed the series  when it was on TV so the whole volume  is great entertainment and commercial free.",1374019200,,262,4.7555555555555555
2940913,5,B000VECAE4,Great value - very happy.  The CD's are all packed together more or less so you have to be careful not to scratch them but it is worth it for the price.,1373932800,,152,3.75

2940917,3,B000VECAE4,"There are a few discs that have portions that ""stick"" which ruin the ""Play All"" option. When the disc freezes I have to eject them and then fast forward to get past the bad places. Sometimes it works and sometimes I just have to use the ""one at a time"" option. However, doing the best my PS3 can do, sometimes I just have to skip the rest of the episode or episodes. I am still looking but it is locally so I can take any bad series back for an exchange or refund. I know this was a new set and the seller didn't know about the freezing issues until they read this review, but it still renders some of this series unuseable. The S&H ws right on but I am disappointed with this purchase.",1373068800,3,686,4.088888888888889

2940920,5,B000VECAE4,"This has the entire series of one of my favorite shows finally affordable!  The only thing bad about it is that the DVD's are just stacked on top of each other so finding a certain episode is kind of a hassle and they quickly get out of order if you're not careful and may be more prone to scratches, however, for the price, it's worth it and it doesn't take up much space.",1372636800,,373,4.109589041095891
2940921,5,B000VECAE4,Wish they came out with a Blu-ray version. Amazing show. Always funny. Too bad they didn't continue making new episodes.,1372204800,,120,5.05
2940922,5,B000VECAE4,"PACKING: Let me start my saying I am OVERLY ANNOYED by the reviews on packaging. Yes, the discs are stacked on one another. Can you imagine how big and pricey packaging would be if there were 27 individually wrapped discs!? It's no different than buying a package of blank CD's that are stacked. If you place the discs back like they were packaged, you won't have a scratch!!!

DVD quality: Just fine to me, it's not in HD but the quality is the same as watching on TVLand.

SHOW: Now for the real review...great show and I watch KOQ every night anyway, why not in order? I wish the show was still running.

Shipping: I have Amazon Prime so that guarantees two-day shipping. I ordered 11pm the next morning it was on my doorstep!",1372118400,2,729,4.425373134328358

2940924,4,B000VECAE4,"Great price for 9 seasons of a TV classic! My problem with the packaging isn't the lack of quality, but the lack of Deacon! He was a big part of the show, being Doug's best friend and all. But his image isn't featured anywhere on the packaging! There's images of Doug, Carrie and Arthur of course.. even Spence and Danny... but no Deacon. As a matter of fact, the only place you can find his face is a small side profile background image on Season 6 disc 3! Maybe I'm being Mr. Sensitive, but it bothers me that the African American character, a main character at that, was omitted from the packaging.",1371081600,,601,4.375
2940925,5,B000VECAE4,"It took longer to ship than I would have cared for but once it shipped it was delivered in no time.

You really do get what you pay for.",1370563200,,309,4.081967213114754

2940927,5,B000VECAE4,This set comes with 27 DVD's. Because it isn't individually packaged and comes in 2 spindles ( still with sturdy great outer packaging) it is so much cheaper. You save so much and can afford to have every episode of the great series!,1370390400,,233,4.441860465116279
2940928,5,B000VECAE4,My family loves this show. The disks come in two spindles capped off with a piece of cardboard. I can see why it bothers some people but it doesn't bother me too much. We are on the second disc so far and loving it. The price is great for 29 dvds worth of content. No glitches or anything yet.,1370131200,,293,3.983050847457627
2940929,3,B000VECAE4,"This is a review for the complete series; not the truck packaging, but the other listed one.

I love the series, but I was rather surprised and disappointed with the packaging. It was a folding box inside of a protective carton, and when pulled out, open to reveal two spindle-type holders. The discs stacked on top of each other. To me, this is just as bad as cramming them inside of tight cardboard holders.

I give the series 5 stars, but only 3 for this packaging.",1369785600,,468,4.430232558139535

I read that some don't like the packaging---and yes, while it's not the greatest packaging out there, the DVD's are great quality and to me that's more imortant than fancy packaging, especially when the price was awesome!!

2940949,5,B000VECAE4,"I bought these only to find out - to my annoyance - that none of these DVDs have subtitles. Now this is a big deal in my house, because English is not my wife's first language. And I've come to love subititles, because they're great for watching stuff with volume low after kids have gone to bed. I'm so used to them now that shows and movies seem weird without them.

But not to worry, because they have Closed Captioning. At least, I thought they did. And they do, except that I discovered an uncomfortable truth: HDMI cables don't transmit Closed Captions.

It seems that there's no industry standard for HDMI to transmit Closed Captioning, so for the most part, CC doesn't work through HDMI. I tested this with my LG Blu-Ray player and HDTV, and found it to be true.

Undaunted, I dug through a bunch of old wires in my closet, rigged them up behind my TV, and found a solution. Here's what to do to get those pesky Captions to work:

1. Run old-school A/V cables (the red, white, and yellow) from your Blu-Ray player to your TV. I used an A/V switch as well, since I'm sharing that imput with a Wii.

2. Temporarily disconnect your HDMI cable from the Blu-Ray player, so the TV won't recognize that input.

3. On the TV, select A/V as the input. Then go into the settings and turn the captions on. And Voila! Closed Captions.

Then when you're ready to use the HDMI again, just plug the HDMI cable back into the blu-ray player, select that input, and you're good to go.

I was very happy to get those working again. The captions don't show the theme song though, so I'll just have to sing that out loud:

""My eyes are gettin' weary, my back is gettin' tight!...""

P.S. These do come in cheap packaging, stacked on spindles just like everybody says. If that bothers you, do like I did and buy a cheap CD/DVD case to put these in. Problem solved!",1366243200,2,1849,4.364431486880466

2940961,5,B000VECAE4,This is my favorite sow and now I can watch it whenever I want.  It makes me sad that this show is off the air but now I re-live all the funny over and over.  Definetely buy this box-set hillarious,1365897600,,197,3.9
2940962,3,B000VECAE4,"Me and my wife love this series, so when I saw the entire series on Amazon for $35 I had to get it. I'm completely satisfied with the discs themselves, you get the entire series plus the third bonus disc for the last season, basically the same as what you would get if you bought the seasons individually, but with less packaging. Speaking of the packaging, it's awful. The plastic spindle that holds the discs in place is made of plastic so thin that it just allows the discs to wobble around inside the container. There is a piece of cardboard to top both stacks of discs to keep them from falling out during shipping, and if you plan on buying this and using the included packaging I'd suggest you keep this piece of cardboard, as if it's not there, the discs tend to fall out as you're opening the package. What I did was purchase a package of ten DVD cases that hold 3 discs each for around $8 for the set, and I printed out some custom labels for them. Then I packaged the collection myself by season, and threw the original packaging in the garbage. They take up a little more room on my DVD shelf, but totally worth it to keep the discs adequately secure. Otherwise, I'm happy with the collection!",1365724800,7,1205,4.36
2940963,3,B000VECAE4,"If you are ok with a poorly designed set up to keep your discs in, this is a great deal.  The disc spindles came apart from the packaging the first time I tried to pull a disc out.  All the discs are fine, it is the box which they go in that stinks.  I would recommend it, but be prepared to have a few scratches on your discs because of the poor design.",1365033600,,354,3.8219178082191783

Occasionally, a joke misses the mark with me (I'm admittedly easily offended), but overall, this show is just fantastic. This set is great way to unwind after a long day. I was actually quite sad to see it end, but I know I can watch it again anytime. That's what's great about sets like this!",1363910400,,467,4.441860465116279

2941036,3,B000VECAE4,"So the way this box is set up is you unfold it and it has half the discs stacked on top of each other on one side and half on the other side. It has little cardboard piece holding them in place and if you don't keep them there the discs will move around and fall out. It also tells you what episodes are on each disc but no descriptions of them. It's a pain to have to sort through the all the discs to find a particular one and I'm always worried about them getting scratched. Personally I think I might just give this set to someone and buy each season individually, it bothers me that much.",1355875200,,593,4.033898305084746

2941046,1,B000VECAE4,"I must say that apart from the content, this is about the most disappointing TV Series on DVD I've ever seen (and we own quite a few!).
The packaging is absolutely the cheapest of the cheapest: two spindles in a card board box. The DVD menus is something that an intern would be ashamed of: the the selector boxes and arrows are completely unaligned with the choices. And of course: no subtitles.

2941047,5,B000VECAE4,"THE KING OF QUEENS-THE COMPLETE SERIES: Taking its cue from THE HONEYMOONERS, one of the most influential TV sitcoms ever, THE KING OF QUEENS features stand-up comic KEVIN JAMES as RALPH CRAMDEN-like lovable loser DOUG HEFFERNAN, only instead of a bus driving boob from the Bronx, he's a package delivery schlub from Queens. In the role of the smarter, wise-cracking spouse is LEAH REMINI, updated in this case to be as venomous as she is voluptuous. Astutely cast in the ""wacky neighbor"" role is the showbiz veteran's veteran JERRY STILLER, as Doug's cellar-dwelling father-in-law with a COSMO KRAMER-esque scheme for anybody who will lend an ear. Stiller's brilliantly wacked-out ARTHUR SPOONER is an even more twisted, indescribably annoying, (and even funnier) variation on his FRANK COSTANZA character from SEINFELD. JAMES lets the food/fat jokes fly with alarming regularity, CARRIE HEFFERNAN is the most despicable/lovable female creation since ELAINE BENNIS (Seinfeld again), and a book of Arthur's off the wall quotes would set the moral majority on its keister...with laughter, most likely. That's what great comedy is all about folks, and THE KING OF QUEENS is the best of its ilk since EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND...hell, maybe even since THE FLINTSTONES, no stranger to the influence of THE HONEYMOONERS itself.

2941048,5,B000VECAE4,I love the delivery truck in which all 9 seasons are held.  I also like the fact that the synopasises of the seasons are kept under the hood of the truck as well.  I'm enjoying watching all DVDs.  This show is hysterical.  Wish I had watched it when it first premiered.,1347926400,,269,4.215686274509804
2941049,4,B000VECAE4,"This was a great price for the complete King of Queens series.
The dvds came fast with no glitch and so far the ones I have seen have been good quality.
The only drawback is that I wish they would have put some kind of material between the dvds to prevent scratching. Even a thin slice of cardboard would be better.
I have put paper towels between the discs, but it makes the box thick.
I still would order these again, though and try to be creative in fixing the problem, when it keeps the price and quality so good!",1347840000,,517,4.18

Pros: Cheap
  Complete
  Great show

Cons: All DVD's come stacked on top of each other.  I just went out and bought a big three ring binder and those plastic cd holder pages and put all of these discs in that and it works fine.  That way the discs don't get to scratched up!",1345766400,2,484,4.173913043478261

DVDs are stacked one right on top of the other and you must save the spacer as this is the only way to keep the full set of DVDs from spinning around in the box.

it while growing up. The only defect I find with it is that the packaging sucks. I must warn
you if you are big on perfect packages avoid this set completely. It is 27 dvds and they come
in two slots. The manufacturers separated them in half and just piled all the dvds on top of
each other. I was afraid that some of them would be scratched but thankfully none of them were.
I immediately went to target and bought cd cases and a cd holder box and put all the dvds in it.
The dvds are not in its original packaging but they are safe and sound. I recommend everyone
to do this because the packaging is really terrible. Some people here have complained about
the quality of the picture and to me it wasn't that big of a deal so don't let it stop you.",1335484800,2,839,4.0
2941061,4,B000VECAE4,the only downside of this box set is that the case has no retention for the discs. since there is nothing to hold them in place they have a nasty tendancy to spill out when opening the flaps. other than that this has been a pretty good product.,1333152000,,244,4.104166666666667
2941062,5,B000VECAE4,"I love this collection. Containing every episode from every season, along with the special features included on the last disc of each season. It's a must-have for any King of Queens fans.

Only flaw is the design of the the case. Rather than having each disc in it's own ""slot"", they have two 'stacks' of discs.

I bought some 6-Disc DVD cases from Amazon though, and that cheap investment cleared up the potential for the discs being scratched.",1332979200,,445,4.6923076923076925

It was truly a family with such a great cast and wonderful crew. Roger Lundblade and I warmed up the audience who were always happy and upbeat to be there, which made our job much easier. What a great experience that I will treasure always. Now when is it going to be released in a box set of the entire series? I'm waiting to relive all those great shows in Hi Def !!!",1332892800,,492,4.030612244897959
2941064,5,B000VECAE4,"I thought this set was a great buy.  The aspect ratio is about 1.85:1, so the image completely fills my widescreen LCD.

But, recently I saw an episode on TV, that I didn't remember seeing on these DVDs.  Sure enough, I looked at all of the titles, and there is no ""Surprise Artie"" episode.  This is the episode where Carrie plans a surprise party for Arthur, and Doug takes Arthur to a buffet (Doug says he is taking him to buy an aquarium).  Meanwhile back at the party (Arthur never gets there), two older men (one of them is Mrs. McKlusky's husband on Desparate Housewifes) argue about who slept with one of the men's wifes.  They realize that it was Arthur who slept with the wife.

Anyway, this episode is not in this ""Complete"" set, unless it is under a different name.  I wonder if any other episodes are missing.

EDIT:  I was mistaken, ""Surprise Artie"" is included (thanks for pointing that out, someone).",1332633600,,915,4.524390243902439

I had been buying these on single seasons release but felt that this set will save me a lot of room for my other sets, plus I got mine for $21.99 for all nine seasons and I consider that a huge bargain.

My hubby and I decided to go ahead and purchase the entire series since we were recording the show every night on tvland and tbs. I'm happy overall, but the packaging (we got the cheaper version and not the one w/ the IPS truck packaging, which I hear is better) is sub par. I'm afraid that after several uses the dvds will scratch since they are stacked together in two different columns. I think my best bet is to individually store the dvds in holders.

Sometimes the father was annoying because his character here was basically the same one he played on ""Seinfeld"".

2941085,5,B000VECAE4,"Package? Let me start with the package. I hear people complain about the package. There isn't anything wrong having dvds on a spindle. I have a few hundred dvds on spindles and never had a scratch from it and they all work fine. I am not throwing the spindles around though. Just take reasonable care with the collection. And I have to say that EVERYONE REALLY SHOULD SAVE THE CARDBOARD INSERT THAT HOLDS THE DISCS DOWN IN THE SPINDLE. Don't throw that away. The cardboard insert holds the discs nice and tight so the discs won't rattle at all. Without the cardboard insert, the discs will rattle around. The package doesn't compare to the more expensive truck box collection but if it means that I am going to save +$60 for this collection, then the cost reducing package is a 5 out of 5.

Picture quality? Lets just say I have seen some amazing looking DVDs and this isn't the case here. It is fine with me but if you watch the syndicated series on TBS HD a lot like I do and expect something close to that, then you will notice a pretty big difference in picture quality and be somewhat disappointed. There are artifacts showing at times. I am a little more forgiving of the picture quality because this is a comedy series. If it was a special effect science fiction/action movie, then I would be disappointed. It is about 3 hours of show per disc which is too high considering I think these are regular 4.7GB discs. It is still good enough for me because the hilarious show makes me forget about some slight artifacts. If they made this in blu-ray or made it look somewhat like TBS HD, it would have been perfect. As for aspect ratio, I am actually a fan of keeping the original aspect ratio rather than zooming or stretching the picture. Good job there. I give the picture quality a 3.75 out of 5.

The King of Queens show? What can I say about The King of Queens show? It is one of the best comedies that I have ever seen. They have lots of funny plots and the entire cast is hilarious. We rarely see an entire cast all be funny but this is one of them. Doug, Carrie and Arthur are hilarious but then we see co-stars like Deacon, Spence, Holly, Danny Heffernan, Richie, etc. who can make me laugh just as much as the major characters. I put this show in my top 3 comedy shows of all-time. 5 out of 5!

Price? 9 seasons and 4,532 minutes of hilarious comedy is worth the bargain price. Definitely a 5 out of 5 there!",1322524800,89,2421,4.328193832599119
2941086,1,B000VECAE4,"This review only concerns itself with the quality of the dvds themselves.

The show is fine.

The dvds arrived within the time stated but...

the dvds arrived sitting upon one another in two portions of the box set, so that they may scratch AND the dvd quality is like the old LP or SLP versions of VHS.  For thos of you who are not familiar with the old VHS settings, LP and SLP are much lower resolution and quality.  These dvds are barely watchable.

Buyer beware however, the video quality is as good or worse as streaming the episodes from the web. No subtitles - not even in English. No deleted scenes. Simply put, Sony Pictures put absolutely no care in producing these DVDs.
Its really unfortunate after seeing that its partner series, Everybody Loves Raymond, got excellent treatment from HBO Home Video and each of its seasons came out on DVDs in superb picture quality.

Besides he doesn't have grandchildren in the show, remember that hilarious episode when he fakes piano classes for kids... Or the Tijuana Taxi dancing... Oh my god, kids (or grown kids like me) love him!

It was almost to good to be true. You can purchase the old packaging but for 100+ dollars. This packaging in this current form basically piles all the DVDs in two deep pockets. There are no separate cases for each season. So you have to be very careful not scratch the discs. I think that because of new digital download erra is upon us, that companies don't care how the deliver there dvd content any more.  They lower the price and make it seem like the best thing ever, and now you are stuck with a cheep box and a pile of discs with no cases. So if you must own this product at the price of $40.00 and don't care about having your DVD cases nice and protected, go for it. If not, i would spend the extra money to get the nicer packaging.

The characters all work well together and during the course of the series' run, every cast member was giving a chance to shine. Of course what really makes the show work are the two leads Kevin James and Leah Remini.  On paper there is no plausible way that Doug and Carrie would be together, but the two leads mesh so well and seamlessly, that it totally works.

Shows like, According to Jim, Everyone Loves Raymond, Home Improvement, and all the way back to the Honeymooners. Smart, pretty, intelligent wife has to suffer with her idiot, blue collar, poorly educated husband. If that is not tiresome enough add the fat husband angle.

2941122,3,B000VECAE4,I got the product as a gift. We love the show but the quality of the discs were not up to par. Most of the discs have scratches on them and one cd will not even play in the DVD player. Some shows skip.,1267315200,,201,3.590909090909091
2941123,5,B000VECAE4,"Boy do I miss this show! It had the best cast and writers since 'Seinfeld'.  It's just as good a show and started just as Seinfeld ended. I wanted this set ever since it came out, and in the special-edition ""IPS"" truck case.  But it cost over $200.00!  I really didn't think I'd ever get that edition of this series because I never saw it in stores again.  But guess what!  One day my email from Amazon told me that it was on sale, and at under $100.00! The email must have been based on my viewing it before. Normally this type of marketing annoys me, but not when it's from Amazon, because they have Amazing prices here.

So, even though I recently lost my job, I couldn't pass up an opportunity like this on practically my favorite show. Besides, when you are out of work and realize how bleak your future is, you need something to make you laugh!  This is just the thing!  If you have never watched the show, you are missing out on some great comedians in a perfect situation comedy for them, including Kevin James, Jerry Stiller, Patten Oswalt, and others.
The set includes 207 episodes on 26 DVDs which aired in it's 9-year run on CBS, a 90-page episode guide, and a bonus disc of special features.  Of course I haven't watched it all yet, but I can tell you it's GREAT! The case is practically a living-room decoration and doesn't take that much space.  If you have some Amazon $$ or a DVD budget, GET IT!!!",1266969600,,1414,4.342205323193916
2941124,4,B000VECAE4,So the reason I'm giving this 4 stars and not 5 is because of the box and other details of it's packaging not because of the show itself. I love and have loved this show for years so when I finally decided to buy it i was excited because the price really couldn't be beat on amazon. When I got the package and itook it out of the protective box it came in i was disappointed when I saw how flimsy the actual box (which come in the shape of an IPS delivery truck) was. When I opened the box the back came off right away and when I looked at it it was very loosly glued on there so it was no surprise that it came off. Well I let that go and started to watch it from the begining since I knew I had missed a lot of the episodes when they aired years ago. Well I've noticed that some seasons have the DVDs out order in the booklet. Not a big deal just the first time I saw this in a boxed set. Also I've had trouble with some of the DVD skipping. I've tried them on multiple DVD players new and older models and it happen every so often but when I take it out there are no scratches or dirt so I just wipe it with a soft cloth just in case pop it back in and it's fine. I've had to do it more than once ad make sure the DVD player  is clean too for it to work again. That part can get annoying especially when I want to watch a full DVD. Also there are no subtitles or captions which annoyed me too. So all in all for the price I don't  mind just be aware you might get some glitches in some of the DVDs. Still no matter what it's a great show.,1265760000,10,1541,3.782608695652174
2941125,3,B000VECAE4,"I love the series ""King of Queens""!  I just bought the complete series with the cute delivery truck packaging and couldn't wait to start watching them.  We pop the First Season DVD in and the first episode looked terrible (quality). Hey, it must be because it was the first one, right?  No HD yet?  Second Episode a little better but not much. The rest of the episodes in the First Season also did not have ""great quality"" and that's using a ""upconverting dvd player"" and then a ""Blu-ray player"" both connected through HDMI, not sure if that would really help these DVDs but it has with other DVDs.

We finally get to the Second Season and here is where it gets a little mixed up. It turns out that the dvd labeled ""Season 2 DVD 1"" is actually ""Season 2 DVD 3"" and DVD 3 is DVD 1 . . . very confusing and strange. We are still watching Season 2 so we do not know if the rest of the Seasons are okay.  I don't have the Individual Season DVDs so I don't know if the quality/resolution of those DVDs are better than the Complete Series.  The Complete Series has three DVDs per season except for the Ninth Season (2 DVS and a bonus DVD). Does anyone who bought the Individual Seasons have the same situation?  Poor quality DVDs?  Mixed up DVD labels?

Overall, I love the series, Kevin James, Leah Remini & Jerry Stiller!  One of the best sitcoms!  5 Stars for the Series & packaging, 3 Stars for the DVDs (the re-runs on TV look much better!)",1265587200,4,1439,4.288888888888889
2941126,2,B000VECAE4,This is one of my favorite shows of all times. I thought I would get a complete series of all the seasons ...as it states...but a few of the CD's have duplicate episodes on them...and the series doesn't follow the episodes in a correct order.,1265068800,5,242,4.4
2941127,5,B000VECAE4,I bought this for $89.99 on a one day sale on Amazon.com in December and I'm very happy with it.  I think it's one of the funniest shows ever and will watch the episodes for years to come.  It's pretty cool that the DVD cases come in a cardboard IPS truck and it has a list of all the episodes from each season (details on what each episode is about also),1264377600,,355,3.9859154929577465
2941128,5,B000VECAE4,Great product for any King of Queens lover. Relive the entire series from beginning to end with every season on disc all in a neat little delivery truck.,1264291200,,153,4.5
2941129,5,B000VECAE4,"I purchased this as a gift for Christmas, and I have to say it is really tremendous.  It comes packed in a neat little box shaped like an IPS truck, has literature on all the episodes and an entire collection of DVDs with scenes you have never seen. It is the funniest show since Seinfeld!!!",1264291200,,291,4.290909090909091
2941130,5,B000VECAE4,I got this for my wife's birthday and she has been watching it ever since. Probably one of the best gifts I have ever given her...lol. This show is hilarious!!!,1264291200,,160,4.366666666666666
2941131,5,B000VECAE4,"Although I'd only seen a dozen or so episodes on TV, that was enough to convince me that The King of Queens was a must-have collection, and that I had to see it all, right from the very beginning.

The show must have been great fun to write and film, because the high standard of each episode's story-line, the excellent chemistry between the talented actors, and the lively vibe that the show exudes, is so infectious.

Along with the Everybody Loves Raymond, and 'Till Death series, I just love the clever and insightful comedy that is contained within the nuances, and the highs and lows of grown-up human inter-relationships.

This show delivers a truckload of laughs!",1264291200,,672,4.775862068965517
2941132,4,B000VECAE4,"I watched the first DVD yesterday and it was hilarious!  I've only caught a few episodes on tv and wondered why Carrie's dad was living down in the basement.  But what caught me by surprise was the letterbox format.  I played it on my PS3 and I have two black bars on the sides of my 1080i screen.  It's a little annoying.  But other than that, the packaging is kinda neat.  The episode guide is under the hood and the back of the truck opens up to get at the DVDs.  I'm ready to pop in the next disc for more laughs!",1264204800,,517,4.009803921568627
2941133,5,B000VECAE4,"I receieved this box set as a Christmas gift last year.  My husband and I enjoy watching TV on DVD at night and this was a perfect show for the both of us.  We both could relate with the characters and laughed through the entire thing.  Doug's green truck is really cool too, the seasons fit nicely in the back of it and the information cards are under the hood.  This set is so thoughtfully put together and a much better price as a unit since there are so many seasons.",1261526400,,471,4.142857142857143

2941135,5,B000VECAE4,The collection came quickly but the box the dvd's are in was damaged! I wasn't too happy about that but I've yet to have time watch the dvd's but they looked ok in the box. It did arrive quickly!!,1261180800,,196,4.051282051282051

2941137,5,B000VECAE4,this is a great comedy series!!!  im not gonna give an entire story synopsis like some other reviewers :D  but its a great series.  the packaging is clever but is a little on the low quality side; cardboard can only do so much lol.  but overall it was a great buy!,1257638400,,264,4.117647058823529

2941139,5,B000VECAE4,"When I brought this item from amazon it was the gold deal of the day, and for $93 dollars I didn't think I could go wrong. While its never got as big, as say Everybody loves Raymond, I feel in a lot of ways this series was superior. I'm giving this a 5 Star rating based on the quality of the series and the price I brought it for. I wouldn't pay full price for it, but its hard to refuse this when its under $100",1255305600,,413,3.813953488372093
2941140,5,B000VECAE4,I love the show and reccomend it... Funny to the last episode... then ur lost and ask where you go from there... i still pop a disk in every now and then and still laugh at it...,1254960000,,178,3.8378378378378377
2941141,3,B000VECAE4,"Like the reviewer before me, I have to say that the quality of the DVD's in this set is sub-par. (The content, as any fan of the show already knows, is fine.)

The DVD's exhibit artifacts and jerky motion despite my having an excellent Sony upconverting DVD player and 40"" Sony Bravia LCD connected via HDMI.

None of my other DVD's have these issues...whether my 50 or so movies or the half dozen or so series (Sopranos, The Wire, Seinfeld etc.)

This is not in any way to say the shows are unwatchable or unenjoyable. It is merely an observation that the quality of the engineering etc. leaves much to be desired.

I don't think these are knock-offs as they were purchased directly from amazon.com...however, had they not been on sale for $94 (and had I not had a gift certificate to further lower the price) I'd have returned the set to amazon.  I only decided to hold on to it as my wife is a big fan and doesn't mind the minor glitches (which I find somewhat annoying and distracting).",1253664000,2,990,4.447513812154696
2941142,5,B000VECAE4,I am so pleased with my collection.  I have seen most of the shows before I purchased my collection but there are so many I still had yet to see.  I love Kevin James - he is so funny.  Each episode is different and full of laughter.,1253404800,,232,3.893617021276596
2941143,5,B000VECAE4,"This show is brilliant.  Perfect casting.  KJ was never better.  Leah is perfection and the meaner she got as the series continued, the louder we laughed.  Jerry brings even more brilliance.
No complaints about this show.  I miss it.  It is a modern classic.

p.s. - Not so big on these fancy box sets.  What a waste of space and paper!  Wish they had created something compact and shelf-able (is that a word?).  I just want to watch this show, I don't want to display it like a home accent.  I get it - it's cute and all but damn, there needs to be a version for people who just want what's important - the SHOW!

2941147,5,B000VECAE4,"I just love this show and I never get tired of the reruns. It would have been nice if they had made it in wide screen which is how they show it on TBS, but that's nothing, just a little suggestion. I love the chemistry between DOUG and CARRIE and are glad they kept the same characters throughout the show!(excluding Deacons kids) I bet that anyone checking this box set out has seen a few episodes before and let me guess, you like it, well this is what you need to get! I always hated not finding anything good on tv and The King Of Queens wasn't on either and wanted to see an episode, but after I found this little set, I can now watch it anytime which is the beauty of tv on dvd, you can watch it whenever. I also have a portable dvd player and when I'm not driving, that's my go-to selection. The great thing about this show is that it's so modest, so true to life, which is the reason why I, like so many others love it so much. It's funny to think that this kind of guy and this beautiful woman could have a chance, especially when they have their disagreements, but when they make up and have their loving moments, you know their meant for each other. Oh, don't even get me started on Carrie's father, Arthur. I don't think Iv'e ever seen that quite of a unique and hilarious relationship/situation between a young couple and the wife's crazy father living together. CLASSIC! I also don't think Iv'e ever seen such great chemistry between actors in a sitcom like these three together, and in every episode which is the mark of brilliancy. These guys deserve so much credit for bringing their A-game every single episode. BRILLIANT!! I just wish that it never got cancelled, this show could've gone on for 20 years!!! I would've loved the aspect of Doug and Carrie having a kid for the last few seasons, imagine Arthur as a grandpa, HA!!!

  Now onto the box set. It's made very nicely and is also very cleverly made, top of the line. The set is an IPS truck with Doug, Carrie and Arthur pictured in the ""cockpit"". The DVDS are located in the back of the truck, and you lift the door like a real delivery truck to pull them out. There are nine cases of dvds for the shows nine seasons with 3 dvds per case and the cases are made very nicely unlike some other complete series sets. Under the hood are nine ""index card sized"" cards for the nine seasons describing every episode!

A GREAT VALUE AND A GREAT SHOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1246492800,4,2431,4.348017621145375

Amazon shipped this out fast, just like almost everything else I've bought from them. But what impressed me was the packaging... As you can see from the photos the IPS truck box set is not symentrical, it has angles and 2 flaps that open. It arrived with shrink wrap attaching it securely onto a larger piece of cardboard inside the larger outer box, plus air bags all around it. That meant that no sides ever touched the shipping box.

Doug (Kevin James) is great and definetly represents most married men in my opinion.  In short, you can't go wrong with this box set.",1232668800,,416,4.036585365853658

Yes, it is a great ensemble cast, but I think that Kevin James is the one that holds it all together.  (Gary Valentine (Danny) is his real brother.)

I have seen the same episodes on cable again and again and this show has yet to lose its appeal for me.  Somehow you feel like you are right in the Heffernan living room, and although you might not want to live there, it's an awfully fun place to visit.

I watched Hitch strictly on account of Kevin James.  He probably has some sort of a future in feature films, but I hope he creates another episodic niche such as KoQ.  When he is in his sitcom zone, he is a tough act to follow.",1225152000,,860,4.0773809523809526

It's a deal for the regular Amazon price, and for $105 it's a can't pass up addition to anyone's DVD collection.",1212624000,,274,4.230769230769231

2941176,3,B000VECAE4,"Please note: If I were rating the show itself I would give it 5 stars. The show itself is hilarious. The interplay between Kevin James, Leah Remini, and Jerry Stiller is fantastic. But, if you are reading this you probably already know that.
 I give the box set release 3 stars because there are no deleted scenes, bloopers, or show commentaries. I've seen all the episodes. I was hoping for the same kind of extras that Seinfeld, Everybody Loves Raymond, and The Office put into their season DVD releases. The extra 'bonus' disc with this set is pretty worthless.
 If you don't care about bonus features, then by all means, buy this set. The show looks good, sounds good, and the truck is pretty cool.",1211241600,38,702,4.608
2941177,5,B000VECAE4,"My favorite show. I own every season! I've watched them over and over!

Doug Heffernan (Kevin James) and Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller, yes, Ben's dad) are hilarious! Patton Oswald is also at his best in this show. Saturday Night Live's Rachael Dratch is also funny.

The things Doug gets into on this show, make me laugh so hard. Arthur is so annoying, yet you cant help but love him.

Amazing show, amazing cast, 9 wonderful seasons!

I love ""King of Queens""!!",1211068800,,462,4.666666666666667
2941178,4,B000VECAE4,"No complaints about the show itself. Laughs, laughs and more laughs (with the exception of very few episodes). The only reason I believe this release does not deserve a 5 star are the dissapointing special features. I expected more special features in 9 seasons and in a special collector's box. Most of them are not even interesting. Not much behind-the-scene stuff, bloopers etc. Just few interviews and compilations from the show itself!",1210723200,,440,5.125
2941179,5,B000VECAE4,"Now this what I call a sitcom! King Of Queens is in my opinion the greatest television comedy of all time, that is correct the greatest of all time.

 Set in Queens, NY is an all star cast featuring Kevin James as Doug Heffernan, an overweight IPS driver, that is pretty much the all american fat guy. He eats alot, drinks, is obsessed with sports, watches alot of tv, makes farting noises with his hand, and oh did I mention he eats alot. Also starring Leah Remini as Carrie Heffernan, the outspoken, strong, and alot of times mean, beautiful wife of Doug. And last but not least Jerry Stiller as Arthur Spooner, the outrageous father-in-law that lives in Doug and Carries basement after setting fire to his house, trying to cook on an old hot plate. The three of these actors are a dynamic trio, that without anyone of these characters the show would not have turned out as funny as it did. I have to say that every character created in King Of Queens is funny, I have tried to think of one that maybe I did not quite like, but after thinking long and hard I love them all, from the quirky dog walker starring Nicole Sullivan as Holly Shumpert that Doug and Carrie hire to walk their father, to the mean waitress Doug almost fought with but ends up trying to run away scared. I have watched alot of sitcoms, and have yet to find one that comes close to the King Of Queens. I now use the ignorant word ""Shutty"" instead of shut up or be quite. I feel that it's nicer than using ""shut up"", and not quite as nice as ""be quite"". Even after watching each episode atleast five times, they are all still as funny as the first time I watched them.

 This is for anyone who loves over the top funny comedy. That can appreciate the greatness tv sometimes has to offer. Although all the episodes are hilarious, it also brings us back to reality with some very powerful and meaningful moments. The very last episode had me cracking up, but also in tears. That's what great tv is all about.",1209859200,95,1978,4.35230352303523

2941188,4,B000VECAE4,"There are lots of boxed sets of various television series out there but this one stands head and shoulders above them all by virtue of its amazing packaging.  The set comes in an IPS delivery truck designed as a cue to the truck in the TV series.  The hood opens up and this is where the liner notes about the program is found. At the other end of the vehicle is a door which, when opened, reveals a stack of DVD ""packages"" sitting on top of a little miniature pallet.

If you care about such things, I think the packaging even has won some awards.

Oh yeah, and the series itself is pretty good :-)",1202774400,59,599,4.182608695652174

2941197,4,B000VECAE4,"Honestly, I can't explain what I like about King of Queens. I find the show hilarious despite the fact that I rarely watch sitcoms on television. Perhaps I'm seeing something in my life portrayed in the antics of Doug, his wife Carrie, and Carrie's father Arthur. Whatever the reason, I find King of Queens to be a real gem in this modern world where ""reality TV"" shows are the norm. It is refreshing to sit down and have an honest, laugh out loud comedy based on a married couple trying to make it in life.

One of my favorite episodes was when Doug rented an apartment without Carrie's knowledge. By the very end, I'm wiping away tears from laughing so hard. My stomach started to hurt, actually.

If I had to say one bad thing about the show, it would have to be the fact that in nearly every episode takes place in Doug and Carrie's house. A large percentage of episodes take place in either their kitchen, living room, or garage. It's a minor flaw to the show since even though the scenery differs slightly every episode is full of value and laughter. Also, another slight annoyance is the outside shot of the house. The exterior shot of the house is inconsistence with the interior shot. A good example is the location of the living room - the interior shows it to be on the right of the front door, whereas on the exterior it shows that to the right, there is nothing.

I do not own individual seasons of the show. I received all nine seasons as a gift. I was surprised by the packaging though. All of the seasons are packed in a unique box to appear like an IPS delivery truck - a fictional delivery company where Doug is employed. I am pleased with the dvds. I am happy that the show was made into dvds. I must say that based on the cost of individual seasons, I recommend buying the entire box set to save some cash. One minor complaint about the dvds is the windows installer they pack on some seasons. If you like watching dvds on your computer, you might find it a bit annoying that the autorun asks you for installers (I noticed this on season two or three, I forgot which one). I find it annoying that I have to manually open my dvd application in order to view the show and close the popup for the installer. Most of them are pure dvds, so popping them on the computer will not ask you install a dvd player.",1200009600,6,2323,4.311212814645309

2941199,5,B000VECAE4,"Like the topic says, I love King Of Queens. And thanks to the US Amazon Shop and the fast and cheap international shipping, I can enjoy now the whole series at home in Germany during the Christmas Holiday's. And now a few informations about the Box. The Box looks like an IPS Truck and it is made of paperboard, but it still looks not cheap or that it can break in half when you touch it. Second it got two really cool features, when you open the hood you will find indexcards with informations (title and a short summary) about every episode. And when you open the luggage compartment door you will find 9 paperboard digipacks with plastic disc holders. So the DVD's are well protected and they don't get scratches on the surface that easily. Overall it's a great box and definitly worth the money. 5 Stars for Sony Pictures and the King Of Queens Boxset.
