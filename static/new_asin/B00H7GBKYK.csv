6136779,4,B00H7GBKYK,"If there's a Spanish equivalent to the films of Richard Linklater they would be Cedric Klapisch's 'Spanish Apartment' series- 2002's L'Auberge Espagnole and 2005's Russian Dolls. Equal parts charming and infuriatingly madcap, they nonetheless are impossible to resist because, darnit they are just so darn cute, earnest, and Euro in their explorations of hipster romance and professional aimlessness. Thankfully, Klapisch doesn't screw with the formula in the breezy and jazzy Chinese Puzzle, a fitting good-bye to the characters whose lives we've been following for years.

Or perhaps it's not so much a good-bye as a ""see you later""? Like Linklater's Before Sunrise trilogy, there's an enduring quality to the romantic entanglements of professional adolescent Xavier (Roman Duris), who has settled into his novelist career. His love life has only gotten more complicated as he approaches midlife crisis age, and Xavier continues to excel at making things worse despite well-meaning intentions. In an effort to stay a part of his kids' lives he up and moves from Paris to New York after his wife (the returning Kelly Reilly) relocates. Culture shock abounds but Xavier gets plenty of help from a few familiar faces. Klapisch has wisely paired down the overly large cast of the prior movies to focus on a small group of favorites, and one of those coming back is Xavier's lesbian best friend, Isabelle (Cecile de France). She's shacked up with a beautiful American (the gorgeous Sandrine Holt) and they desperately want Xavier to help them have a child. Things only get more difficult when Xavier's former flame Martine (Audrey Tautou, last seen with Duris in Mood Indigo) arrives in town with her kids and old passions are rekindled, although neither cares to admit it.

Most of the humor is basic fish-out-of-water stuff as Xavier deals with the high cost of living in the big city, encounters with unfamiliar ethnicities, and women of course. The ladies in Xavier's life, of which there are many, pull him in many different directions but we also see how screwed he would be without any of them. They make him a better man, and it's a pleasure to see a film that doesn't marginalize the female characters in the least. Between Xavier's novel, imaginary conversations with long dead German philosophers, and an impromptu marriage for American citizenship, there's a lot to contend with and Klapisch sometimes gets lost in the subplots. But even if Chinese Puzzle is a little bit messy it's pretty much what these moves were always meant to be and why many will be hoping Xavier's misadventures in love aren't over yet.",1412899200,4,2620,5.0625

6136782,4,B00H7GBKYK,"""Chinese Puzzle"" (2013 release from France; 117 min.; original title ""Casse-tte chinois"") brings the ongoing story of Xavier, now a 40 old father of 2 small kids, and his never-ending struggles with life in general, and women in particular. When we last saw Xavier, almost 10 years ago, he ended up happily in the arms of Wendy, the British woman he first met in Barcelona now almost 15 years ago. As ""Chinese Puzzle"" opens, we learn that Xavier is now in New York, trying to write a new novel about the complexities in life. Then in flashbacks we find out that a year earlier, he and his wife of 10 years (!) Wendy break up, in part because she met someone in New York, in part because he decides to donate sperm to a lesbian couple, of which Isabelle is a long-time friend. When Wendy announces that she is moving to New York and taking the kids with her, Xavier feels he has no choice but to also move to New York, so that he can remain close to his 2 kids. Will Wendy and Xavier find each other again in New York? What will happen to pregnant Isabelle? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the third movie from writer-director Cdric Klapisch bringing us the chronicles of Xavier, following ""L'auberge espagnol"" (""The Spanish Apartment"") in 2002 and ""Les poupes russes"" (""Russian Dolls"") in 2005. The comparisons with the ""Before"" franchise starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are obvious. What surprised me (in the best possible way) is how, despite all of the commotion going on, Xavier remains level-headed (for most of the time). No bitterness about what unexpected turns life has in store for him (compare that to the growing bitterness of the Julie Delpy character in the ""Before"" franchise). The movie spends a fair amount of time focusing on the difficult adjustment to life in New York, where Xavier at first is a fish out of water (check out the hilarious scene when Xavier decides to hire a lawyer to represent him in his custody battle with Wendy). There are a couple of side  stories that really don't add much to the movie (Isabelle's affair with the Belgian babysitter being the chief one). Most importantly, though, is the winning performance from Romain Duris as Xavier. He simply oozes charm from start to finish and carries the movie on his shoulders. What resonates perhaps most for me in the movie is the tender look at Xavier's relationship with his 2 young children now that he is a divorced dad. Bottom line: this is a long overdue and welcome addition to the story of Xavier and the people around him, and I enjoyed this from start to finish. For those who have not seen the earlier movies: it is NOT ""required"" that you have seen the earlier movies, although it certainly adds to the enjoyment. For those who have seen the first two movies: ""Chinese Puzzle"" may be the most satisfying of the three, but I encourage you to check this out for yourself and draw your own conclusions.

""Chinese Puzzle"" opened recently at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati and I couldn't wait to see it. The matinee performance where I saw this at was decently well attended but it wasn't packed or anywhere close to a sell-out (the movie left only after 1 week). No matter. ""Chinese Puzzle"" is a winning movie, and then some. If you are in the mood for something that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Chinese Puzzle"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1403568000,8,3514,4.6192

The Big Apple offers the Parisian plenty of surprises, many of those quite shocking. Among other women in his life is a former flame, now divorced with children ( Audrey Tautou). The film has the usual Gallic charm, presenting situations that might have been a a full-blown drama in an American movie, or a deep introvert tragedy in a Russian one, as a light comedy. Both Duris and Tautou are funny and charming, but the movie, despite many quite funny moments, is fragmented by the superhuman efforts of  Cdric Klapisch (screenplay and direction) to make it funnier than it is and fill it with a plot that it mostly misses. The faces that Duris makes trying to oblige in a fertility/artificial insemination clinic, the groping in bed, the lesbian relatioship cum betrayal, etc. -have little to do with the plot.

6136789,5,B00H7GBKYK,"This is the last movie in a trilogy focused on the life of Romain Duris's character, Xavier. The movies were filmed over a long period of time, over a decade, I believe, and so the actors age with their characters. All of these movies strike a balance between realism and feel-good plot lines that make them engaging and enjoyable to watch, in a light-hearted way. Because the characters come from several countries, the dialog moves among several languages in ways that are not typical of movies set in the US. (This movies takes place primarily in NYC.) If you aren't a polyglot and you don't like subtitles, this is probably not a movie you'll enjoy. If that doesn't put you off, you might find this a highly entertaining movie, with nuanced looks at the lives of immigrants in New York, well-acted and fairly realistic characters, and a happy ending. This film includes heterosexual and homosexual encounters, though the sex acts themselves are not explicit. However, some of the relations might be described as casual. To me, this adds realism, but some friends would find it distasteful.",1446249600,,1093,4.881720430107527
6136790,3,B00H7GBKYK,"Apparently this movie is the third and ends the trilogy by director Cedric Klapisch, who directed the other two called LAuberge Espagnole ( The Spanish Apartment) and Russian Dolls.
The Chinese Puzzle ( CASSE-TTE CHINOIS )  follows the same people through their misadventures and confusion in life and middle age. I haven't see the other two films but this final installment can be safely watched on its own without having to see the others..
Xavier is 40 and now finds himself in New York City to be closer to his kids following his separation from Wendy ( Kelly Reilly). On his route to get his residency in the states,  we follow his adventures as the guy who helps a lesbian friend get pregnant, save a taxi driver and getting married to his niece to become a US citizen. Everything and all the characters are complicated but in a fun way...while we are not pondering about the characters and their tangled lives we also come to know the harshness of life in New York city such as the search for an apartment for unprepared folks especially those who are over 40. A mixture of french romance, philosophy and lessons of love, marriage and children. I enjoyed it.",1445385600,,1165,4.650485436893204
6136791,5,B00H7GBKYK,"The third installment in Cdric Klapisch's prominent trilogy, ""Chinese Puzzle"" considers the web of no less than ten Parisian lives relocated to the other end of the pond. The film is spent dissecting the residual of a cross-oceanic move, and ruminating on whether such a move is the source for a series of complications, or whether life is still simple despite it.

Xavier's ex-wife, Wendy (of ""Spanish Pudding"" and ""Russian Dolls"" fame), has just informed him that she is moving to New York and taking their children with her. Is this the evil of a pure antagonist, or do we just side with Xavier since he is the central figure and narrator of the trilogy?

Meanwhile, Xavier's reputation as a writer has grown, and his popularity in Paris has surged tremendously. But, since he cares enough to be by his kids, he must forego his celebrity life in Paris and settle in New York, where he is just as unknown as any newly arrived dreamer wanting to bite a piece of the Big Apple. Immigration issues ensue, as do some fierce episodes only cultivable in New York City. But the modern conveniences of MacBook Pros, Skype, on-the-spot air travel, and cell phones make the world smaller; as such, the move is not quite as drastic for Xavier as it would have been several decades ago.

Nevertheless, as with its prequels, ""Chinese Puzzle"" does not shy away from examining cultural differences. One memorable instance is Xavier's recollection of a dialogue with a native New Yorker (whose information I will not herein disclose out of fear of producing a spoiler alert): Xavier recounts that the character stoops down to Xavier's level of English (I think the narration also incorporates some synonym of 'intelligence'), slows down his tempo of speaking, and treats Xavier like a time traveller from the Old World. The irony here, at least for me, is I've heard many a U.S. visitor to France experiencing the very same phenomenon while attempting to speak French. So, is Klapisch postulating that this concept is a two-sided street, happening to transoceanic U.S. and French citizens alike?

Meticulous details abound: Xavier's flight to NYC takes off into a very cloudy sky, one that reflects the over-complicated nature of his life; 1st Avenue is mistaken for Avenue A--groundwork, yet again, that is meant to be simple, but perceived as confusing; and, perhaps given this is the third installment, so too do the characteristics Xavier seeks in one being, break down into three separate entities (a concept to be understood only at the end of the film).

A leitmotif of adventure from ""Spanish Pudding"" comes creeping back in ""Chinese Puzzle,"" making for a closing all too fun, wistful, absurd, and touching--all at once. I highly recommend the film, though only if you have already watched the first two in the series.",1443916800,,2812,4.9115789473684215

Amazingly, cheaters get away with it, the INS is fooled (unlike in the other French tim ""Green Crad"" in which Gerard Depardieu's character confesses and gets deported from the US - Xavier gets away with it). Shockingly, Wendy is fed up with Xavier's refusal to grow up, shave, accept life and stop looking like a slob, so she dumps him for a large American guy who is apparently well off, shaves and bathes. Annoyingly, Martine (Audrey Tautou) one again reappears to bug the living hell out of Xavier, and manages to have sex with him a few times.  Long gone are Wendy's brother, his Russian wife, the Spanish girl from the first movie, and the German and Italian guys. Belgian lesbian Isabelle cheats on her Chinese-American partner Ju with another Belgian girl of the same name. Gets artificially inseminated with Xavier's ""mojo"".

6136804,3,B00H7GBKYK,"Cdric Klapischs romantic comedy Chinese Puzzle (Casse-tte chinois) is the third of the series about Xavier Rousseau (Romain Duris), a French writer now turning 40 years old. We first met him in The Spanish Apartment (2002) and then Russian Dolls. (2005)

Those who have not seen these movies can enjoy the third and (and probably the last) entry of the trilogy as a stand-alone film, but perhaps you can enjoy it more with some knowledge about the main characters stories so far.

In the new film, Xaviers happy ten-year marriage ends suddenly, with his wife Wendy (Kelly Reilly) and two children flying to New York. Xavier follows them and decides to settle there, even though he has no proper documentation. Troubles ensue, with incredibly chaotic situations involving an immigration officer, a Chinese taxi driver and Xaviers old and new friends.

Its good to see Audrey Tautou again as Xaviers ex-girlfriend. Brief as her screen time is, her character Martine is more charming and convincing than the rest of the film, which looks too convenient to me, even though the protagonist seems to think differently.

After all, this is a Klapisch film, a series of light-hearted and occasionally insightful vignette about life as he sees it.",1421020800,,1238,5.024390243902439

Well realising he can not live without them - he packs up and moves to the Big Apple too. Only thing is he is not exactly loaded and is not exactly American and so has no automatic right to stay or work - hence the Green Card reference. He then gets a break and an apartment in China Town and his fight to save his family and start a new life all begin.

This is a comedy that has its heart in the right place, it is warm and caring and very inclusive. We have issues of race, country, language, same sex couples etc all being dealt with in a way that brings things and people together.

The humour is light touch, with no one bursting blood vessels laughing at this, but it is just so nice that you won't care. In French and English and coming in at just under two hours this is one to watch when you need something light and life affirming.",1419897600,4,1249,4.028225806451613

6136812,5,B00H7GBKYK,"I was waiting for this movie to come out in theaters since early 2014 (for other L'auberge espagnole fans, you know the release date was pushed back several times for US distribution).  However, it finally came out on DVD (!) and I have to say, the wait was worth it.

First, this film jumps ahead several years from where the last one left off - specifically, the ending of the last film was when Wendy and Xavier have just begun courting each other, and in the opening of this film we see that they have been together for 10 years, have had 2 kids, and are now splitting up.  This all happens fairly quickly within the first ten minutes, and while it sounds like the makings for a really drab, depressing film, it actually kicks off a rather interesting series of events, the most striking of which is Xavier's move to New York City.

I won't give away too much more for fear of spoiling the film,  but I found it to be an interesting exploration of several topics: first, Xavier's forthcoming novel meditates on the idea that life is complicated, and that the more one tries to solve things, the more complicated it gets - like a Chinese puzzle - and that when one stops rationalizing and acts on intuition, things are actually quite simple.  The second was the subject of being a foreigner, particularly in America, and as the spouse of a European person, I found it to be a quite relatable depiction.  The other was the idea of growing up, coming of age - in this film, Xavier surprisingly comes off as the most mature and stable compared to his pals, even though from an outsider's view it appears that his life is the one falling apart.

I thought this was a great movie - it brought closure to the trilogy, and the filmmaking style, as always, was vibrant - and made even better by having NYC as a backdrop.  One biking scene in particular, where Xavier is biking along the bridge, was particularly delightful.  This film was definitely worth the wait!",1416787200,,1960,4.495774647887324
