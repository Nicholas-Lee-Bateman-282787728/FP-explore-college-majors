1172788,2,9089700072,"Very disappointed in this dvd.  It looks like all the scenes were filmed at the same cove, just shot at different angles. Someone set up a camera and turned it on.  Absolutely no imagination at all.  I didn't find this dvd at all relaxing, just boring at staring at the same cove over and over.  Skip this one.",1370908800,4,310,4.293103448275862
1172789,5,9089700072,"Gorgeous, amazing quality scenes. So tranquil and hypnotizing. I would highly recommend this to others! It makes you want to go on vacation!",1351728000,,140,5.130434782608695
1172790,5,9089700072,"I have about 15 - 20 beach/ocean/wave dvds, blu-ray and regular dvds.  By far - like miles and miles ahead - in terms of the color, the translucence of the water, the highlights sparkling on the top of the waves, the light filtering through the waves, the transparency of the waves, the sound of the waves - there is no other dvd that comes even remotely close to this dvd by Tony Helsoot.
I just wish it was on blu- ray.
Ocean Tranquility has 3 scenes, but the only one I like is simply waves coming up to the shore - it is looped for 10 mintues - and called ""paradise Beach"". It is beautiful and mesmerizing - easy to slip into a deep meditative state without even realizing it is happening. I thank Amazon for having this available to be purchased. Tony Helsoot/Isis if you are reading this - please release this in Blu-ray - I know you already use special cameras so I know you can get this done on blu-ray!
I have a magnavox blu ray player and with the 1080p ""upscaling"" (the Magnavox's upscaling capability is really amazing)it still looks grainy on my 37"" LCD. Much better on my old CRT 27"" TV - here it looks spectacular.
So - if you plan to just zone out and meditate - you can get this dvd - and I still watch it in in all its graininess and pixelization on my 37"" LCD just because it is still worlds better than anything else I own or have seen for relaxation. In fact, since I got this dvd, I have not watched any other waves/ocean dvd - blu ray or regular.",1280361600,11,1469,4.190812720848056
7901393,5,9089700072,"Very relaxing ocean with relaxing music, suitable for playing all night while sleeping.  There are six different ocean recordings.  You can set it to play all six and it will repeat continuously.",1524873600,,195,5.0625
7901394,4,9089700072,This is a very nice dvd of beaches. The only thing I wish it had was the option to turn the music off and just listen to the ocean. That's why I gave it 4 stars. This is the 2nd beaches dvd I have purchased in the ambient collection. I use them when I work out.,1500249600,,261,3.6785714285714284

7901396,5,9089700072,Me and my wife love watching this DVD it's beautiful and relaxing. We like to have it on in the background when we have company over. Definitely worth buying.,1494201600,,158,4.482758620689655

7901398,5,9089700072,"This is yet another of the beautiful, relaxing videos from Tony Helsloot. I have Ocean Serenity too, but this one has more differences in the colors, While it too has the sunset colors, the brilliant turquoise colors are just amazing. It's so beautiful to watch and I really liked the music too, which is not really something I'm looking for in an ambient video. I mostly concentrate on the views and ocean sounds. Another peaceful addition to my collection.",1422144000,3,458,4.810126582278481
7901399,5,9089700072,You will enjoy the ocean scenes in this DVD. It has great quality filming. It will make you want to go to the beach for vacation. A must have to add to your ambient collection. Very relaxing and beautiful.,1415232000,,205,4.282051282051282
7901400,5,9089700072,So beautiful!  I love the ocean.  This DVD gives relaxing views and soothing music.  The additional tracks have natural sounds.  They are all quite eye catching and peaceful.,1414108800,,174,5.107142857142857
7901401,5,9089700072,All other Ocean DVDs I have seen featured crashing surf.  This DVD shows a different gentle side to the ocean and transports you to a place of deep peace and tenderness.  I never tire of watching it.,1392336000,,199,4.351351351351352
7901402,3,9089700072,"The scenery is nice and relaxing but I was hoping for more waves crashing into the beach, the water is mostly flat and smooth, pretty but not what I was looking for. I am ordering the Waves DVD maybe it will actually have some waves.",1389225600,3,233,4.2
