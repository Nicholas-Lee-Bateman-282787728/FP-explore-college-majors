8752567,2,B01C9GNRHU,"One woman has multiple nude scenes. She is topless a couple times and she has two pubic area scenes. One scene is in the dark and you can barely make anything out. The other is a good scene . It is not an up  close view but you get to see the gorgeous hair between her legs, but her legs stay closed.  I gave it a lower rating only because of the subtitles. I despise  have to read what's being said during a movie. Gladly give me a dubbed movie.",1527724800,,446,3.933333333333333

8752572,4,B01C9GNRHU,"I couldn't resist a film with the title of Beethoven's great opera.  Beethoven's only opera tells the story of a wife's faithfulness and courage as the heroine,Leonore, assumes the name and identity of a man, Fidelio, to rescue her husband from a long political imprisonment. In the movie, the old seagoing freighter on which most of the action takes place is named Fidelio.  And the story tells of a conflicted struggle towards faithfulness. The other two words of the film's title have strong allusions as well.  ""Odyssey"" refers to Homer's poem of wandering at sea and return while ""Alice"" , the name of the main character, refers to the wandering young girl of Lewis Carroll's tale. But the strongest allusion is to ""Fidelio"".  The film has an entertaining pop film score but no quotations from Beethoven's opera.

This 2014 French film received several international nominations and prizes, particularly for Ariane Labed's portrayal of Alice, the primary character.  Alice, 30, is a ship engineer who has sailed all over the world and who boasts about the number of men she has bedded along the way.
Her fianc&eacute; is a young Norwegian graphic artist, Felix, (Anders Ganderson Lie), a somewhat conventional young man who stays on land and at home. Alice's work keeps the couple separated for long periods of time but doesn't interfere with her sexual needs. While on the Fidelio, she begins an affair with her former mentor, the ship's captain, Gael, (Melvin Poupaud).

The film includes many steamy sex scenes as Alice struggles internally to know her own mind and heart. Her self-reflections are enhanced when she finds the diary of her predecessor engineer on the ship, who has died under mysterious circumstances, which gives a record of his lonely life.  The film shows Alice's competence and ability to get along with her fellow sailors in an almost exclusively male environment; (She is the only woman on board.) but feminist themes are not obtrusive.  The movie offers good portraits of the crew and their interactions and of life at sea.  The cinematography is highly effective in its portrayal of the Fidelio, the ocean, the ports, and the dives which the crew frequents when on shore in the way of sailors of all places and times.

This is a lovely film in the way it shows the protagonist accepting and enjoying her own sexuality while trying to work through her relationship with the man she loves.  Although it is slow and wandering in places, like an old meandering tramp freighter, this film is thoughtful, enjoyable and well worth seeing.  It is directed by Lucie Borleteau in her first ,and highly promising, effort. The film is in French with clear English subtitles. It is a pleasure to see independent, creative films, such as ""Fidelio"" which don't receive a great deal of attention here in the United States.  The film is distributed by First Run Features, which specializes in quality independent film.  First Run Features kindly sent me a copy to review.

Total Time: 97 minutes

8752573,4,B01C9GNRHU,"Alice (Ariane Labed The Lobster) is an engineer on a cargo ship. She has a handsome and doting boyfriend who is Norwegian  Felix (Andres Danielsen Lie Oslo 31 August) and after returning from a voyage she hops into the sack with him before going off to replace a dead engineer on the Fedelio. Only this is a ship which has been renamed and is actually the ship she apprenticed on, and worse still the sultry captain with matinee idol good looks who was her first love is now her boss and married.

Well soon they are all at sea  in more ways than one and she reveals that as a woman she has needs and knows how to fulfil them. So begins her odyssey. She also indulges in the belongings of the dead engineer piecing together his wayfaring life through diary entries and pictures. However what this really develops into is a voyage of self discovery.

Now this has a lot of bedroom gymnastics in it and to put it mildly she arrives faster than an Uber cab. Now I am all fine with that sort of thing but the story  like the journey  meanders in places and at times it is hard to know why a scene was included. That too is fine as the relevance of all reveals itself in the final denouement. All in all a very accomplished film but not one that is an entry to French films but more for those who really like a bit of Gallic difference.",1459036800,4,1331,4.2204724409448815
