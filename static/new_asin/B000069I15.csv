7965949,5,B000069I15,An entertaining film.  Worth watching more than once (so I bought it).,1461628800,,70,4.833333333333333
7965950,5,B000069I15,"I first saw this film when it came out in our small local theater back in 96. The director even introduced it. The film moves along well. The story and characters have a certain charm that pulls you in and gets you pulling for them. For a lower budget film, the acting is well done, especially from Joe & Joe (Sean Patrick Brennan & David Wysocki, Oh and we cant forget that Ghost, I won't spoil it with a name). I was very glad to find it on DVD to watch it again. The last time I saw it was on PBS probably 10 years ago. If you enjoy this film, you should also peek at Noelle. David Wall's 2nd movie. It goes by that title for the DVD, but was originally titled Mrs. Worthingtons Party when I had the priviledge to see that film in the same local theater.",1374019200,,757,4.053333333333334

7965952,3,B000069I15,this is a gem of a movie cute characters and mildly scary ghost but in a hot sort of way always wondered why dead people have clothes.,1361836800,,134,4.0
7965953,5,B000069I15,Try it you'll like it. No name actors doing a great job with a fun story about two regulars Joe's just trying their best.,1331769600,,121,4.083333333333333
7965954,4,B000069I15,"If you have come this far, you probably already know about this great little film, but if not read on...  I first saw this movie on Sundance channel years ago.  I taped it and loaned the tape to someone whom I probably will never get it back from.  I really love this film and was surprised as hell to find it available on DVD.  It is a simple story, the characters are well defined and it is hard not to be taken in by them.  This is a film that bucks the trends of recent movies, it depends on well written dialogue and is shot beautifully.  It has some great jokes and gags in it, but they are not of the over top variety.  I find myself still smiling thinking about this movie.  I highyly recommend.",1083283200,6,703,4.117647058823529
