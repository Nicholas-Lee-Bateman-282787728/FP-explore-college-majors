5234163,5,B00915G6WQ,"Note: There may be some SPOILERS here according to some commentors

Difficult to believe that this series is able to maintain a high level of good writing and ideas and character development on such a morbid theme as Dexter, but here we are with season 7's first episode - and we're off an running, literally.  The opening of the season picks up where season 6 ended - same room, with Dexter just having murdered Travis - while his sister Debra (now a lieutenant in the police force) watching. Dexter tells her ""I snapped,"" blaming Rita's death. She asks about him being wrapped in plastic and he says it is just ""second nature not to leave a trace."" When Debra tries to call the station he stops her, pointing out how weird everything looks. He points out that even if it is ruled self-defense he'd lose his job and his son. He suggests getting rid of the body, but she doesn't go for it. Dexter then thinks they could make it look like a suicide, including setting the church on fire. The plan involves gasoline and Debra says she'll go get a few gallons. Dexter flashes back to childhood and Harry wanting to get rid of a dog that Debra likes. Dexter thinks he needs to keep Debra from the ""whole truth."" Dexter takes down all of his kill stuff. Dexter is forced to attempt a cover-up, which works for a while until Debra uncovers enough evidence to as Dexter is he is indeed a serial killer.  It looks as though the season will play on this strange predicament with every episode, but meanwhile there is an added murder with grand implications that sets the team, including Dexter, into action to uncover the killer.  The entire cast returns for this season - Michael C. Hall as the blood spatter expert Dexter Morgan, Jennifer Carpenter as Debra Morgan, C.S. Lee as Vince Masuka, Lauren Vlez as Lt. Maria LaGuerta, David Zayas as Angel Batista, James Remar as Harry Morgan and Desmond Harrington as Joey Quinn.  Grady Harp, October 12",1349049600,26,1939,4.576368876080692

5234819,5,B00915G6WQ,"Dexter Season Seven elevates and accelerates the characters and the story to a dark sad conclusion.  In this season Sergeant Batista buys a restaurant, Batista's enters a relationship with Quinn, and Dexter gets into a relationship with another serial killer, Hannah McKay (Yvonne Strahovski) which causes complications between Dexter and Debbie.

The series starts exactly where series six ends and it adds a complication in that Lieutenant LaGuerta discovers a Bay Harbor Butcher blood slide.  This discovery allows LaGuerta's character to be further fleshed out, and it brings some interesting flashbacks with Sergeant Doakes.

There is no one supervillian in this series, instead there are a mix of several, all of whom are sympathetic characters Isaak Sirko (Ray Stephenson) is particularly excellent.

The season is excellent like no other in that all of the characters have troubles in some way equal to Dexter.",1431907200,,918,5.391608391608392
5234850,5,B00915G6WQ,"The single most intense season of Dexter they ever had so far for seven seasons.  Reason being someone figures out Dexter's secret but not saying who and particular character closes in on Dexter and it's survival of the fittest season final.  One of best parts of this season was how tense all of characters were to one another and the mutiple twist and turns even I didn't even see coming and been watching since the beginning of the series.  I am so looking forward to watching the last season, season eight since just finish season seven.  So if your as big as a fan as me for the Dexter series then buy this season and prepare to be amaze by the gasp and eyes widen in so many episodes of current season.

I pretty much watch whatever she wants to watch and acclimate myself to the show. Well we started watching the first episode and I was horrified and was just hoping that she would feel the same. No such luck, we kept watching and soon found that the plot was a big surprise and an enjoyable one. How can someone be on a serial killers side? Watch Dexter and you will get past the violence and blood scenes and find a real good series worthy of your time. I do think that they jumped the shark in the last season though, I guess that is why it ended.",1426204800,,675,4.082706766917293

5235115,1,B00915G6WQ,"I couldn't be more disappointed in the way the Dexter series has dwindled below mediocrity. This show hit rock bottom in Season 7. To be honest, the series should have ended after Season 4 with the Trinity Killer, because every season since has been worse than the previous. The show is just not believable. Everything seems forced, including the acting. The plots and storylines are so unreal it hurts to watch. I would have considered this show one of my favorites, right up with Breaking Bad, until Season 5. This show lasted 4 seasons too long.",1420675200,,548,4.71875

The show is witty, good writing in the scripts, and the acting is top notch. You will love how the characters develop and be left on the edge of your seat as Dexter lives his life as our avenger while at the same time satisfying his serial killer instincts. You will not waste your time with this show. My only disappointment was the end of the season 7. I won't spoil it for you more than that. Be your own judge.",1402185600,,569,4.04424778761062

Season 6 was a bit deceiving with the somewhat predictable plot. But toward the finale, it grips you and seems to say ""don't go so fast."" It sets the stage very well for a deeper level. So far, season 7 is the darkest, with many ethical, and philosophical subtexts.",1401926400,,389,4.416666666666667

He had accidently killed a couple of innocents before, but tried to rectify his mistakes. Now he aids a serial killer to escape, and kills a person deliberately who is outside the guidelines of the code, but probably deserves it. Then sets out to kill another person completely outside the code to protect himself.",1398038400,,469,4.802469135802469

Since most of it is filmed in the ""DARK"" you cannot see anything but the whites of their eyes--I love this series but had to move 2 years ago and had to buy tapes to keep up, and last year I was desperate and kept it and watched it, but didn't get much out of it since most of what you get to see is the colorful action.

Hannah McKay, a lady with a ""checkered past"" who arrives to help Miami Metro Homicide revive an old murder case out of joint benefit, and becomes Dexter's love interest. The season has its flaws as Quinns side story is so sublime. Dexters sister Deb now knows about her brothers predilections and the way her character tries to deal with the conflict within her is good television.

5236178,2,B00915G6WQ,"I have loved watching Dexter from the beginning, but this season kind of annoyed me.  I found the Hannah character morally repugnant and really could not find Dexter's feelings for her at all plausible.  They struck me as evidence of a clear and certain moral turpitude in Dexter that moved the series out of a region of moral ambiguity I could find interesting.  Some time after season 4 or 5 Dexter stopped being someone I could hope to find redemption in, and in season 7 it actually became hard to watch.  Most painful was Deb' s loss of vitality.  Throughout season 7 her character was tragic and lost.  I don't plan to watch season 8.

NEXT DAY:  okay well I decided since I wasn't going to buy Season 8 I might as well read ahead about what happens in it.  Having done that, I realized that the series is for the most part a tragedy, particularly for the character Deb Morgan.  Rather than rooting for Dexter Morgan, I am now rooting against him, and have decided to watch Season 8.  I might or might not feel moved to change my review on Season 7 after I've finished Season 8.",1384819200,3,1084,4.396984924623116

This show has always been about how Dexter maintains that balance between good guy and bad guy WITHOUT getting caught, and this season continued along those veins.

I love the books this tv series is loosely based on, but this tv series does justice to the character all on its own. It is like watching a different direction taken by the character. Dexter stays true to the main character in the books, but goes down a different path in the series. I just think this is a great show but not for under 15. Even older teens should have an adult with them while they watch.",1381622400,,509,4.1

The characters are new but this is more about a psychopath who develops a sense of love which is basically the polar opposite of this personality trait.  Granted, loving the actor who is Dexter's counterpart is easy if you are heterosexual, the storyline grows a bit thin.  There are some good moments as we see the end is beginning for the 8th and final season.  If you bought 1-6, surely you need to add this.  If you are a newbie, season 7 would be the LAST place to begin.",1381449600,,547,4.323529411764706

5236329,5,B00915G6WQ,"I bought these DVDs and finished the season in three days. What I like most about season 7 was definitely Deb's development into a more complex character, as well as her relationship with Dexter. Their interactions are really the high point of the season. We also see how Dexter evolves and, for me, he does so in a believable way.

After the way season 6 ended, Deb's character has more on her plate this season. She shows us that she has just as much depth and internal conflict as Dexter, it had just been harder for her to show us other sides of her in the past because the story didn't give her as much to work with as Dexter. This season, Deb shows us her different faces, surprises us with the way she reacts and because of how she chooses to continue, we like her even more.

There are new characters similar but different to previous villains we have seen. Their performances are as good as previous killers in the other seasons but at this point, the new types of criminals/killers do not thrill me as much as they once did. It's not the story's fault but after six seasons, we get the routine. This is why I liked the way season 7 shook things up and while there were still semi-predictable villains, what these characters really help to accomplish is helping Dexter understand himself better and push Dexter and Deb's relationship to the limit.",1380326400,,1356,4.508130081300813

5236428,3,B00915G6WQ,"""Dexter: The Seventh Season""
(HBO, 2013)
NOTE: There might be small spoilers below. don't kill me.

. . .

Sigh. My wife and I have been big ""Dexter"" fans for several years, but Season Seven was really a chore to get through. The stories and character motivations seem strained, the plot devices spawned many unlikely, impractical scenarios, and numerous characters (not just Dexter) pursued courses of action that seemed improbable and ill-advised. Deb, in particular. The emergence of yet another love interest for Dexter held its share of tedium, as well as potential psychological angles that could have been better explored... Numerous supporting characters were thrust into situations that weren't that involving and in general the show seems to be going through the motions, occasionally peppering the landscape with HBO-style sex and gore to keep viewers titillated. Or so they think: it's starting to get old.

One bright spot, and I mean a HUGE positive for this season was Irish actor Ray Stevenson who was AMAZING as the bad guy Isaak Sirko.  Stevenson, who previously played the soldier Titus Pullo in HBO's ""Rome,"" is intensely magnetic and subtle, and steals every scene he's in. Our recommendation: cast this guy as James Bond. Immediately. In the meantime, this was a great performance, and one of the only real highlights to what was otherwise a rather sluggish, repetitive season of ""Dexter."" I guess Season Eight is the series finale... hopefully they are renewing their creative juices to make that final season a real winner. (Axton)",1378944000,4,1555,5.134387351778656

5236545,5,B00915G6WQ,"Dramatic fun a la film noir:

The series takes on so much depth in just 12 episodes in the 7th season.  While it still has its cheesy melodramatic moments (let's face it - we like it for those reasons as well), the characters become much more 3-dimensional, thereby leaving the viewer w/out a clear hero or anti-hero, as the case may be, to route for.  The moral dilemmas it raises are obviously thought-provoking & disturbing, while the twists & turns leave you on the edge of your seat wondering who'll end up next on Dexter's table.",1377993600,,535,4.552083333333333

There's certainly nothing wrong with this plot, and it has some fine lines and a few particularly affecting scenes, but it's nothing to get to overly worked up over.

Fascinating on so many levels, it is the story of a young boy who's childhood trauma is so extreme that he loses his humanity and develops sociopathic tendencies.  But the most compelling part of the story to me is the ongoing process he is involved in in trying to understand, and mimic what the behaviors of normal people are in, what appears to be an attempt to restore his humanity and live a normal life. This show gets all the stars for its compelling premise, the incredible acting, and complex storylines.",1377734400,2,690,4.655737704918033

BUT Debra Morgan's histrionics are getting extremely tiresome and boring. Jennifer Carpenter tries to give her character more importance than she deserves and by over-acting she makes her character not only overwhelmingly prosaic but unbearably annoying. If I could edit out all of Debra, the show would be perfect. Maybe she can go the way of Rita. Thank GOD they got rid of Rita. She was a dullard.",1377129600,,505,4.685393258426966

Bold and wonderful.",1376611200,,306,4.666666666666667
5236756,5,B00915G6WQ,Awesome show. I love it. I still think season 1 and 2 were the best but dexter is a 5 star show. His kid playes almost no part so it makes me wonder why he is in it but not a complaint just saying,1376611200,,196,3.477272727272727

5236761,5,B00915G6WQ,The best writers appear to have gravitated to TV.  Gutsy producers have committed capital.  Aspiring actors and actresses are discovered by and are remaining with the small screen.  Dexter is one of the best series to arise from this sea change.,1376524800,,245,4.926829268292683
5236762,4,B00915G6WQ,i usually can wait for things to come out on the net or telly so it is no problem for the season to complete and then have a marathon watching them all over the week end.  It is Less Expensive this way also than spending 3 months paying for showtime.  Don't care for HBO showtime or the others because they show too many ones that I have already seen or reruns. Or just OLD movies.  The only time I do any of the movie channels is when they give away free 3 months or have a holiday special. I am a baby boomer and do not need that immediate gratification.,1376524800,,556,4.036363636363636

5236796,4,B00915G6WQ,I enjoyed all the episodes. I kind of don't like when Dexter finds a new love interest. They all have been annoying women. Luckily he did kill the pyro she was the worse. I am interested in seeing how they are going to end this series. I'll be sad this will end but it is probably time to end. I couldn't wait for each episode and I would have a mini marathon or 2/3 episodes per night. It was like an addiction.,1376352000,,412,4.036585365853658

5236801,5,B00915G6WQ,This season was every bit as good as every season of Dexter.  I won't spoil it for you but be prepared for a real cliff hanger in the last episode of this season.

5236826,3,B00915G6WQ,"The central premise is a really cool idea.  Debra and Dexter are well-developed.  Nemesis and adversaries leave something to be desired.  Characters that have been on the show for years and get lots of screen time - La Guerta, Batista, Quinn, Jaime, Matthews, Astor, Cody - are not quite Star Trek red shirts, but they really could be more complicated, more engaging, and more dynamic.  The writing invests a lot of time and energy into some sub-plots that conclude in  anti-climactic, convoluted ways.  How often are we going to re-use the plot lines ""law enforcement gets too close to the truth about Dexter"" (Dokes, Lundy, Prado, and two or three in Season 7) and ""romance complicates Dexter's life"" (Rita, Lila, Lumen, again once or twice in this season).  The show has such a strong skeleton, some quick reflexes, and some artful style (opening credits) - it could do so much more with fewer characters and fewer sub-plots.",1376006400,3,928,4.872611464968153

5236873,3,B00915G6WQ,"Somewhat slow to get started, the 7th season of Dexter deals with plot points only barely hinted at in previous episodes and unfolds many of the questions that series fans have had very successfully. The psychopathic Dexter Morgan is all but gone but the portrayal has become more interesting and complex. Season 7 also clearly illustrates the divergence of the character as portrayed in the cable series from the Dexter that is portrayed in the books. It almost seems that season 7 is a prelude to the final season of Dexter.

Missing from this set are any DVD extras. So if you have any questions about intent of plot lines or production choices, you won't get any answers here.  Too bad. It is why I can only rate this season 3 stars instead of 4 stars.",1375660800,,756,4.551470588235294

I don't subscribe to Showtime, so I have to wait for the dvd.  I have to agree with other reviewers regarding the promos on the dvd.  You are forced to watch the promos for at least two minutes and you're not allow to skip ahead.  Other than that, it's a great addition to any dvd collection.

5237146,5,B00915G6WQ,Season 7 of Dexter is still just as twisted and fun as the seasons before it. Michael C Hall is still so charismatic and amkes you root for the serial killer (ie-him). Can't wait to watch the final season and see how it is all wrapped up.,1373500800,,238,4.085106382978723

Why do we root for such a vile, evil and remorseless character? Because we secretly wish we could take matters in our own hands sometimes, don't we? Dexter is a fascinating character and the story line is as well.",1373414400,,348,5.017241379310345
5237149,3,B00915G6WQ,"Dexter has generated so much good will during its first five seasons, that it's easy to overlook the shortcomings of last season as well as this most recent one since we're so invested in how things are going to end for everyone's favorite serial killer.  And let's face it, season 7 has a lion's share of flaws to forgive.  The writing is inconsistent and lazy at times, there are too many uninvolving plot lines, way too much padding in terms of the story lines of the supporting players and the whole season feels like it is about twice as long as it needs to be.  Thankfully Michael C. Hall and Jennifer Carpenter continue to give excellent performances in this penultimate season.

The action picks up following the bombshell that ended season 6.  Debra witnessed Dexter murdering one of his victims thus opening up a fascinating new venues for the series to explore.  Unfortunately, not enough time is devoted to the quandry of how Dexter and Debra can reconcile the dark passenger with their complicated relationship.  The best moments of season 7 focus on Debra's conflict over her response to Dexter's secret and the residual effects it has on her physically and emotionally.  The rest of the time the show spins its wheels with underwhelming storylines such as the romance between Dexter and a fellow murderer, Quinn's involvement with a stripper, Bautista's retirement, and a serial killer who hunts down his victims in homemade mazes.  One saving grace is the dynamic that is explored between Dexter and a Ukranian mob boss who start out as enemies but come to respect and understand one another.

Thankfully, the season ends with a bang and puts things in motion for the eight and final season which will ultimately reveal Dexter's fate.  Will his humanity win out over his dark passenger?  Can he ever be forgiven for his actions?  Should he be?  Will he lose everything that he holds dear?  These are the fascinating questions that I'm look forward to mulling over and they are what make the show worth sticking with until the end.",1373414400,6,2046,4.805714285714286

Michael C. Hall continues his award-winning portrayal. This season all regular cast are excellent with especially good story line for Jennifer Carpenter and Lauren Vlez. David Zayas, C.S Lee, James Reader, Desmond Harrington and Aimee Garcia give performances true to character. One season guests: Yvonne Strahovski, Ray Stevenson, Jason Gedrick all portray their characters excellently. A few James Dokes scenes get replayed.",1373155200,,777,5.0310077519379846

But somehow the writers of this show managed to let us know how much pain/anger Dexter feels with his ""Dark Passenger"" and how hard it is for Dexter to try to fit in with normal people. He thinks buying donuts should solve his problem. He suffers, that's why we allow ourselves to watch him every week.  I'm sorry that this will be the last season.  I am recording all episodes and plan to have a farewell to Dexter watching fest. I sincerely hope they don't kill off Dexter.

Season 7 is simply a continuation of the series with Dexter getting ever ""sloppier"" in carrying out his murderous actions.

In prior seasons, he would seem to lose control but not quite.  This season he did lose control.  At times he seemed to abdicate his responsibility to those around him and do stupid things for someone trying to hide this significant a secret.

The only character I didn't like was Hanna McKay.

There are some great characters introduced in this season that really reflect different parts of Dexter's character.  I feel like this season's cliff hanger is pretty bad, and didn't seem to make a lot of sense.  I hope that they can wrap this up pretty well in the coming season.

I won't tell you what it is, you'll have to watch it for yourself.  I hated to see Monk end after ""only"" eight seasons but I think they did the right thing in pulling the plug before it jumped the shark, maybe the folks at Dester should consider ending it in one, or two at the most, more seasons.

Also, is it me or suddenly everyone (starting during season 6) knows that the Ice Truck killer was Dexter's brother? When was that ever revealed? I remember Dexter going to great lengths to hide that relationship. Did the writer just skip the revelation, thinking that by Season 7 the audience wouldn't realize that what everyone in the story knows was in fact never discovered?",1371686400,,595,4.8431372549019605

5237479,3,B00915G6WQ,"Season 1 of Dexter was ""edgy"", unique. The story lines were full of suspense, and conflicts reached right down to the emotional level. We were along on Dexter's journey to ""discover himself"" and navigate life in a world that was morally confusing and ambiguous.

Season 2 stayed edgy, and when season 3 started to ""lose the edge"", Season 4 came along to become one of the greatest Season's of any show in television history, thanks to an excellent John Lithgow villain, incredible tension and writing, and the culmination of Dexter's emotional Journey.

Then the descent into mediocrity began again in earnest. Season 5 picked up where season 3 left off, and the show, while entertaining, was no longer very creative or edgy. Season 6 was downright terrible, and season 7 does little to improve upon season 6. The sophisticated and thoughtful way in which Dexter rationalizes his world of darkness and light, and moral ambiguity is replaced by a feeling that Dexter is like a child with a dark side who is unable to cope. He is lost with his ""dark passenger"", his sexual urges, and his relationships with others. Also gone is the prevalent feeling that you were experiencing a little piece of Miami with every episode, the suspense, and the interesting character conflicts.

If you like a mediocre soap opera about a childish serial killer who only kills bad guys, watch the show.",1371254400,3,1380,4.863829787234042

5237513,5,B00915G6WQ,I am an avid Dexter fan so you won't hear any complaints here except I wish the show wasn't ending after this next season (#8).,1371168000,,127,4.12
5237514,4,B00915G6WQ,"This season takes Deb down into the deepest layers of hell. It starts with Deb falling upon Dexter's killing a Christian serial killer in his church and it ends with an even grosser and more deliriously crazy crime. Dexter used to be more or less manipulated by his Dark Passenger, by a need he had to satisfy, an impulse he had to follow, but little by little he realizes that there is no dark passenger and that he is entirely responsible for his crimes and that leads to the idea that he is killing to survive, and eventually to avenge the killing of his mother.

As soon as this idea that survival is the main objective Dexter becomes a plain ordinary simple and banal serial killer. He does not kill dangerous people, I mean dangerous for society because they are serial killers themselves, but he kills because he feels menaced. His killing is no longer an act of vigilante justice but an act of pure fear, the fear to be taken, and when his sister is totally involved, the fear she might get caught or that she might become the target of some other criminal, and little by little of the police itself. It is no longer awesome but it has become awful.

The psychological level of the characters, Dexter among them, then loses a lot of its appeal. Dexter is a monster, a self-centered, egocentric, selfish monster. He has not one ounce of humanity left. He has become a danger for society by not being a scavenger that takes care of mental rubbish and social garbage. Then the suspense in the series is no longer only about when and how he is going to be caught but rather how he is going to get out of his mess by killing whom, when, where, how. Up to now there was an ethical dimension he called a code in that appeal. Now it is purely morbid and nothing but morbid.

The series uses some circumstantial subjects to build some kind of setting and environment to the predator's hunt. The Ukrainian mafia in Miami opens night clubs with Ukrainian dancers who are essentially strippers and pole dancers, in other words something close to prostitution that is more or less tolerated but the Ukrainian mafia uses that cover to import all kinds of highly profitable drugs. This clandestine commerce then comes to a direct clash with the Colombian drug mafia that tries to defend their territory. But that transforms the series again into a simple criminal action film like so many others.

The series tries to widen Dexter's scope by making him fall in love with another criminal who has killed exclusively to protect herself from all kinds of ills, a father first who was brutal, a gambler, a child molester, etc, and then juvenile institutions and then the serial killer she makes an escape at 15 with and whose crimes she shares, apparently with a lot of zeal but her lawyer manages to get her some immunity for these crimes because she was considered to be a hostage more than an accomplice. She knows what killing means, and she is in poison, and she understands Dexter and Dexter understands her. They fall in love, real love, not some social convenient arrangement like with Rita. But she menaces Deb who is trying to step between her and Dexter. Then Dexter has to get her in prison for one crime he had covered up.

But she escapes. Food for the next season.

Then this season revives Maria La Guardia, the Captain, and her love affair with Dokes, a Haitian sergeant who hated Dexter and had seen him through, and her obsession, in continuation of Dokes's own obsession, against Dexter and she brings back out of the boxes the case of the Bay Harbor Butcher, but things have become tricky and since Dexter promised Deb not to compete with the police any more, he has to find other solutions than killing people and he becomes very good at framing them. He thus frames Maria who has tried and is trying to frame him. These two framers and their accomplices are like writing the new constitution of the Crime Republic, but that is easy, that is not even respectable, nor believable. And the framers lose their frames in the mean time and have to come back to the radical solution: dispose of the menace.

I am afraid I have to say this season is packed with action and dynamic intrigue, but the main and most successful actor has become the mosquito in the very opening credit sequence, even if its nlife is very short-lived. Even the love of Deb for Dexter is turned into something perverse and sickening. Crime corrupts and absolute crime corrupts absolutely.

5237518,4,B00915G6WQ,"In the Season 6 finale of DEXTER, it's clear that Dexter's world will never be the same. Deb witnessed Dexter's killing of Travis Marshall, the Doomsday Killer. His sister now knows she has to deal with his disturbing secret. She can arrest him or cover up his crimes. Her choices become the meat of Season 7.

The writers dig deep into Dexter's psyche and what makes him tick. This season has many plot twists and a jaw-opening finale that will leave fans stunned. All rules of love, honesty and decency are broken in Season 7. Dexter is wavering from the clear ""Code"" that his adoptive father created for him...a code that lets a serial killer keep murdering but with his conscience intact. Harry is long dead but he appears at Dexter's side as his conscience and voice of reason. Now that Deb knows that her dear, sweet brother is a killer, nothing can be the same. How will they protect their secret?

New and fascinating characters are added this season. Ray Stevenson guest stars as Isaac Sirko - the head of a Ukrainian mob running drugs out of a strip club in Miami.  Stevenson is perfect as the ruggedly handsome and diabolically ruthless Sirko. Soon Sirko is out to kill Dexter who is out to kill Sirko before Sirko and Dexter join forces. Sound confusing? Just follow along. Somehow the writers make it all work.  The writers turn murderous Sirko becomes almost a sympathetic and likeable character when the tables are turned and his life is in danger. Let's not forget to mention that sleazy Detective Quinn falls for one the Russian strippers working in the club.

Added to the mix, is the gorgeous Yvonne Strahovski as Hannah McKay. As a teenager, she was involved with a serial killer, but she was just an innocent victim....or was she? Dexter is faced with a moral dilemma as he falls deeply in love with the only person who can truly understand him. Strahovski is an absolute knock-out in both looks and deception. What a perfect match for Dexter. He uncovers her secrets and she knows only Hannah will ever truly understand them. Two twisted minds are bound by some unseen force and both Dexter and Hannah know there can be no happily ever after to their story.

Things are worse than ever at Miami Metro. Items disappear from the evidence room and killers go free. Investigations that are getting to close to the truth are quelched. Are there any honest cops in Miami Metro? Someone is going to pay a price for all these unsavory shenanigans. LaGuerta finally comes to bat as revealing evidence comes her way. She closes in on Dexter. She's sure the Bay Harbor Killer is still alive and that detective Doakes was framed all those years ago. The question that begs an answer is why does LaGuerta keep the evidence to herself and only tells Debra?

Jennifer Carpenter as foul-mouthed Debra Morgan has plugged along through the years as the annoying police officer turned lieutenant who now has the power to quelch investigations that could jeopardize Dexter's secret. Her character has grown and expanded and is much more pivotal than ever before. She has to protect Dexter from the police and from his new love Hannah. Carpenter's emotional scene in the finale is heart-wrenching and so believable that there is no better acting on TV. Kudos to Jennifer Carpenter for finally being able to delve into her character.

In a nutshell, Season 7 of DEXTER is like no other. Dexter seems to go deeper and deeper into his madness. His rigid code is going be broken. He is willing to plant evidence to frame innocent people. The code is expanded to allow for the killing of anyone, no matter how innocent, if they stand in the way of Dexter, Debra or Hannah's safety. Anyone is free game now. All of this leads to the most shocking and unnerving cliff-hanger finale. Dexter and Debra's worlds are spiraling out of control. Can the final Season 8 put all the pieces together?",1371081600,,3884,4.693098384728341

5237547,4,B00915G6WQ,"So, I've been a faithful Dexter fan for a while. Picked up seasons 1-6 on DVD. FINALLY got Dexter season 7 on Blu-Ray, but I'm disappointed in this release for several reasons.

1) Lack of special features.

A) Previous seasons have had at least SOME special features, if not a few. Usually interviews / commentaries. This one seems to have none.
B) This season seems to mark a turning point in the show. Dexter's relationship with his sister, the unraveling of Dexter's methodical, uhh, methods for reamining undetected, signals of the beginning of the end. I'd have expected the cast & crew and script writers to have plenty to say about this season in particular. The silence is deafening.

For both reasons I'm disappointed.

-----

2) The deceptive use of UV Digital Copy on this release.

Yes, it comes with a UV redemption code. But it blows for two reasons:

A) The code is not for what you'd expect it to be for. You DO NOT get a copy of the series on UV. Nope. So why bother adding UV anything at all?
B) The code is for only the pilot of a completely different show. Rob something-or-other-I-really-don't-care. Yes, it says what you get on the top of the sticker in ""fine print,"" but does anyone ever actually read the stickers? No, we assume when we buy the thing that if we buy Hotel Transylvania with UV, we get Hotel Transylvania with a UV copy *OF* Hotel Transylvania, not a UV copy of something completely different and barely if at all related.

It's both a slap in the face and deceptive packaging. Any reasonable person would expect that if there's a UV sticker on the front of the thing, it means you're getting a UV copy of the title you're buying. That's what UV is for. It's not for advertising some product OTHER than the title in question.

If I'm buying Dexter, I don't want a copy of Mama's Family or Carebears, or the pilot episode of Zombieland. I want DEXTER. That was what I was expecting. Not until I got home and opened the package did I begin to suspect that the code was not for the title I purchased, but something else. At first I thought, okay, I get Dexter AND a pilot episode of something else. NOPE! JUST the pilot episode of something else. NO DEXTER on UV.

Add this to my irritation at the deceptively packaged&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breaking-Bad-The-Fifth-Season/dp/B0060MYL3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breaking Bad - The Fifth Season</a>&nbsp;(which is not ""The Fifth Season"" bu the FIRST HALF of the season, which is nowhere mentioned in any obvious way).

So, basically, this season is a barebones release and you don't get what you'd assume you're getting based on the UV sticker. To me, that's bait & switch. Feel free to vote with your $$ and hope they remedy this problem. Though, I'm not expecting much.

Otherwise, the show is still great, picture quality is good, etc. I'm just irritated with the lack of features (especially given there's SOME stuff on SHO's web site relating to this season; would it have killed them to include THAT?) and the lack of a UV copy of the title purchased, despite the UV sticker (which implies, even if it actually states otherwise, that you should be getting a copy of the title you just purchased not what amounts to advertising for something completely different; I didn't intentionally pay to be advertised to, and had I realized the deception I might have reconsidered my purchase).",1370908800,2,3428,4.8013582342954155

5237616,5,B00915G6WQ,"Dexter is a show that certainly has had its ups and downs.  Very much of it is implausible, and it definitely takes a lot of suspension of disbelief.  But this season really began to focus on what has really always been the question.  What would happen if the wrong person found out about Dexter.  Granted yes, others have found out that he is a serial killer, and he has always been able to end up with the upper hand.  Yet, the one person he will not kill had never found out about him.  That changed this season (actually at the very end of last season), and the storyline dealing with that fallout was great.

Another wonderful addition to the season was Yvonne Strahovski, as a true love interest.  As anyone who watched Chuck knows, she is a very talented actress beyond being drop dead gorgeous, and she played the character as cunning, vulnerable, dangerous and loving.  Unlike any of the other love interests she was not blind to what Dexter is, over the top crazy, or damaged.  Yet the character is crazy and damaged but in different ways than Lila and Lumen.

The other story of the season was Dexter as a target of a Ukrainian mobster.  It is in a lot of ways the filler story of the season, but even so has its own little twists and turns and basically gives Dexter something to deal with while trying to keep even more people from finding out his secret.  Sgt. Doakes returns via flashbacks in the final episode of the season and the season ends on a more shocking moment than last season did.

Dexter is not a show that will appeal to everyone, given the subject matter and the style of the show.  If you have been a fan of the series though, you will definitely like this season.  Even if your interest in the show has been waning, I think it lays a good foundation going into the final season for ending the story.",1370476800,,1831,4.388724035608309

But the pleasure has been voyeuristic--we've observed from the sidelines.  By starting off with Deborah's witnessing the master in action, suddenly we (the audience) are openly complicit and have to deal with our own enthusiasm--our own thrill (and guilt about that thrill) come into question.  It is interesting that as Dexter has moved towards being ""more human,"" perhaps we as viewers have moved more and more towards meeting him halfway.  And then there's Hannah, who accepts him as he is--even though her parameters are definitely skewed.  Just when you'd think we might be tired of the game, the emotional stakes have been skillfully ratcheted up.  On a show where no one is pure--the fascination of those wanting to do the right thing and yet falling prey to internal demons--we the audience are no longer left on our own laurels.

5237679,4,B00915G6WQ,"CONTAINS SPOILERS, ASSUMES YOU HAVE SEEN SEASONS 1-6, IS A LITTLE LONG, AND DISSES CSI!

Well, we recently watched S7 over the course of 3 nights.....we don't know about most viewers but Dexter is one of only a few shows that we simply cannot watch 'old school' (ie. 1 episode per week!?  Just can't do it!!).  After what was easily the worst season last season, despite the excellent cliffhanger and the regrettably brief period Mos Def was a part of the show, we had fears that Dexter may be sputtering to its close in season 8.  Thankfully, S7 is probably our favourite since the first 2 and may be a contender for best season to date.  Many reviewers seem to have been disappointed with S5 (some specifically negative of Julia Stiles; not quite sure what the problem was there, she was great).  What WAS an issue in S5 & 6 was the writing that tended to treat the fans like cretins (something we refer to as CSI writing; when something is needlessly explained multiple times in case you were too dim to get it the first time!).  This is fine for mediocre shows like CSI, NCIS, and the rest (and if you think those shows are well written then a level of contempt is probably justified), but this is not good for a supposedly intelligent show like Dexter (eg. a character refers to Rudy and then another character says the ice truck killer or Dexter's internal monologue says 'my brother'.  We are fans of the show.....we KNOW Rudy is the ice truck killer and is Dexter's brother......please stop treating us like morons.....there are plenty of shows that do that already.  S7 is almost completely devoid of this and we are forever grateful.

We always knew that if this show lasted a number of seasons that eventually the story line would turn to the prospect of Dexter being in a situation that he will kill (or contemplate killing) an innocent, either by mistake or to protect himself (and by doing this you risk alienating the core reason for why this show is so special....you're rooting for the serial killer!  But how can you continue to do so if he kills the innocent!?).  This prospect isn't new to the show as it happened with Doakes in the first 2 seasons but with S7 it went to a place that will make it impossible for the show to have a happy ending.....and if the writers are true to the Deb character.....it's an act that she would never forgive herself for.  As much as we want to see the last season.....we also don't!

The significant pro's for S7 were the introduction of the Stevenson and Strahovski characters (not bad considering Ray's acting is generally a little stiff and we're not big fans) but with even more focus on the 2 main characters of Dexter & Deb it is no surprise that this was a much improved season.  As good as Michael is as Dexter, Jennifer is absolutely astonishing; and their performances and chemistry are the shows greatest strength....and is there an actress in TV today that can do 'emotion' better than Jennifer!?

Possible story developments for the last season?  Quinn getting set up for the murder of Maria (assuming Maria IS dead) since he's a dodgy cop anyway and did have it out for Dexter at one point; Sonya comes back? (unlikely, but we always thought the Irish nanny was too good to be true and was going to be a problem for Dexter); the best season yet for Angel Batista?  Hasn't had a lot to do over the last couple of seasons, was looking like getting written out for season 8 but now has almost been given the greatest reason to be a focal point of the last season.....delay retirement to hunt for Maria's killer (assuming Maria IS dead....sorry for CSI-ing that!); Strahovski's gotta be a big part of it you'd think.

Dexter is truly a wonderful show with a great cast of almost universally likeable characters and isn't that what brings you back for more!?......Boardwalk Empire is likely a better show (technically) but who do you care about or root for!?  Here's to a final season that will leave fans satisfied although those expecting a happy finale are gonna be outta luck we think.

Can't wait for 8.....and please don't CSI the writing......and thanks to everyone involved with bringing the show to the screen and for the fans big enough in number to allow it to run for as long as it has.....it is very much appreciated.

Happy viewing!

Often dismissed as too ""campy"" or ""nerdy"" by serious television critics, the show has been hiding in the relative anonymity of Showtime for seven seasons.  And, following an excellent Season 4 marked by John Lithgow's chilling performance and a stunning death in the final episode, even the diehard Comic-Con fans would admit that Seasons 5 and 6 were not all that strong.  Season 5 explored Dexter's insecurities about being a single father, only to more or less abandon that plot by bringing on a scantily-clad Aimee Garcia as Harrison's full-time babysitter and de-facto-mother.  Season 6 had some moments (and big payoff in the final scene), but the writing of Colin Hanks' character made him into a flimsy and ridiculous adversary.

(SPOILERS follow this portion of the review - you shouldn't be reading here anyway if you don't want to be spoiled :)

Season 7 opens where Season 6 closed - Deb has gone to the church to confess her real, not-so-brotherly love for Dexter, and instead walks in on him performing a ritualized murder.  I appreciated that they only spent one episode with Deb coming to the full realization that Dexter is a serial killer, and undoubtedly, the most prolific serial killer in American history.

Jennifer Carpenter's performance as ""Deb"" has always been a high point of the show, but she OWNS this season.  Frankly, as much as we've seen Dexter grown and change over six years, there's only so much mileage to be had out of his redundant monologues.  The fact that Deb now knows what Dexter is, what she chooses to do with that information, and the way it destroys her emotionally is very intriguing new element to the show, and one that will undoubtedly continue into the 8th and final season.

Yvonne Strahovski's role as ""Hannah McKay"" was another good addition to the show.  While her character was not always interesting, she provided the most interesting romantic partner for Dexter since Rita, and possibly ever.  It was also a role that got better as the season went on as we got to see more of Hannah's dark side, and her character became less one-dimensional.

Some fans might lament the absence of a true ""Big Bad"" from start to finish, but the Ukrainian mob angle set the tone for much of the season, and it could be argued that Laguerta's investigation of Dexter and Deb made her the ""Big Bad"" for Season 7.  There were still the usual shortcuts in logic, and lazily constructed plotlines, but this is not a police procedural, a la ""The Wire"".  Season 7 was excellent, and opens the door for a fantastic finale to what I have always found to be a clever, thrilling, and innovative show.",1370217600,,2694,4.798701298701299

The only thing that gripes me about this product is that it is advertised as having CC - Closed captions. However they are 'special' captions where your player and TV has special technology to display them. Unfortunately, being in Australia, we don't have this facility.

Most other US titles that advertise CC or Subtitles that are switched on/off via the DVD menu.

5237712,5,B00915G6WQ,When I first heard about Dexter I was appalled by a tv show that glorifies a serial killer and never had any intention of watching it. I saw an episode at a family members house and was instantly hooked. Good acting and suspense. My wife and I just finished season 7 in four nights. I'm going through Dexter withdrawals. Can't wait for season 8.,1370044800,,345,4.40625
5237713,5,B00915G6WQ,"I am a sucker for Dexter and I am impressed that not only did the show press forward with Deb being aware of the ""real"" Dexter, it also makes numerous attempts to portray the turmoil Deb thrashes around in due to her little world being upended by the the one constant in her life--her murderous unrepentant brother.

I like Hannah as a romantic interest for Dexter (I don't say love).
I also felt uncomfortable as Dexer tries a hand at killing ""outside the code."" Which means they're doing a good job.
Although as far as his killings went, this season was the least disturbing in that aspect.
So if that is the aspect you really enjoy (which I did), this season is going to seem kind of slow.
A lot more focus on Dexter's personal problems and relationships.
Part of me wishes the show would simply go on, year after year, with methodical Dexter simply killing the people he kills, with more focus being on his hunting procedures and why he's killing who he's killing. The inter-relational focus has left Dexter in a corner, trapped, and dealing with Deb, and not doing his 'other job.'

I am a bit bummed that the next season is the last. I have no idea, but I'm guessing Dexter is going to off himself. I assume Deb survives the show, because there was spinoff talk about her.",1370044800,,1278,4.48068669527897

5237742,5,B00915G6WQ,"Season six is undeniably lacklustre, especially compared to the first five seasons of tension, suspense and riveting viewing.

After Deb discovers Dexter's secret (which was almost exposed at season 5's climax), things unravel for both of them. Dexter gets caught up in a Ukrainian mob war, LaGuerta closes in upon her quarry, and Quinn and Angel move forwards with their lives and careers. Finally, FINALLY they begin to pull their act together. They're not the inebriated winos used for cheap laughs. More flashbacks into Dexter's past deepen the bonds between step-brother and step-sister. Nothing is out of character and every action makes sense, both individually and as part of the whole.

The primary villains (Isaak Sirko and Hannah McKay) aren't just evil villains who want to torture their prey or destroy society. They're well-rounded, developed and almost four-dimensional. And all the better, because at least some of them will be surviving until the show's final season.

Because of the nature of the plot and character development, this is best watched after re-watching the first two seasons.",1369958400,,1108,5.284090909090909

I know it's a one hour show that has to wrap things up before the night is out, but still, it's getting too incredible.

I have many other TV series on Blu Ray such as Fringe and True Blood, just to name a few, that are loaded with extras. When you buy this season know that all you get are the episodes and thats it.

5237905,4,B00915G6WQ,"Watching all of season 7 of Dexter, and then trying to summarize my reaction, has left me feeling as confused and conflicted as any of the main series characters as  portrayed by Michael C. Hall and company.  On the positive side - and there are plenty of positives this season - the plot arc is chockablock with all sorts of entanglements in terms of romance and relationships ranging from excellent (Dexter and the female serial killer Hannah) to interesting (the continuing semi-incestuous fascination of Deb for Dexter as well as the romantic obsession of the gay Ukrainian mobster played by the always-excellent Ray Stevenson) to clunky and generally awful (Quinn's involvement with the Ukrainian stripper.)  In a voiceover that's insightful and almost sweet, if you're open to a ""Serial Killers in Love"" kind of vibe, Dexter analyzes his dark side and his past relationships with women in earlier seasons along the lines of `Lila was drawn to my darkness.  Rita was blind to it.  Lumen needed it.  But Hannah is able to see both sides of me and to like both sides."" Of course, ultimately, none of the relationships that are so central to Season 7 survive anywhere near to being intact.  In a whole variety of ways,  Dexter Season 7 mirrors  what the late movie critic Roger Ebert concluded about the Michelle Williams/Jason Segal film Take This Waltz: ""The wounding power of love, its essential asymmetry and unfairness, permeates (this film).  The one thing you know for sure is that someone - maybe everyone - is going to get hurt.""
Coupled with all of the generally appealing exploration of interpersonal stuff there are some relatively interesting villains (which in and of itself puts this season far out in front of the disappointing season six) as well as some tricky plot twists which are generally successful in helping further the whole `will he or won't he finally be caught' thread that underlies the whole series.  A particularly clever ploy by Captain LaGuerta at the end of the penultimate episode worked well for me despite the fact that the whole premise was - on reflection - fairly implausible. (Spoiler alert: La Guerta - suspicious of Dexter - arranges for the aged mobster who had Dexter's mother killed to be released from prison in order to monitor his movements on the outside and try to trap Dexter in a murder attempt.)  Likewise, there is a totally ambiguous cliffhanger element in one episode - `would Deb go so far as to drug herself and crash her car to throw suspicion onto Dexter's girlfriend and get her out of the way so Deb can have Dexter all to herself'- that is a lot of fun  to contemplate until it gets resolved in the next episode.
All of those positive things aside, the season simultaneously manages to be hugely frustrating in the sense that the writers seem to have been so concerned with all of character analysis and exploration that they phoned in a lot of the writing in terms of the ""Dexter and his dark passenger"" narrative.  The net result was a plethora of WTF moments where logic and forensic reality (as well as what we know about the characters in the past) just seem to have been cast aside due to an excess of laziness.  (Second spoiler alert:  Toward the end of the series a key plot point involves a car crash in which Deb has been injured after presumably drinking water that has been spiked with Xanax.  The writers just glossed over the fact that Xanax in tablet form is virtually insoluble in water and that the tablets Deb had a prescription for as well as the less-likely Xanax drops BOTH would have had a disgustingly noticeable flavor - apparently niggling little details clearly deemed too inconsequential relative to the demands of the plot.  Likewise, Dexter makes a point of giving Deb a pen that has been tipped with the drug aconite supposedly as a way to establish the guilt of his serial killer paramour Hannah in the death of a true-crime writer, even though the viewer is totally aware that the tox screen done on the victim specifically focused on plant poisons such as aconite and none was found.  Duh.)
Bottom line: This season is far superior to season six and I'll certainly plan on sticking around for the next - and final - season that's upcoming.  My hope, however, is that having plumbed the depths of the main characters' emotions and motivations the writers will avoid going too much more overboard with that sort of thing (cf avoid the mistake that has made Bones such an unrewarding televisional experience lately) and will get back to focusing on the primary premise of Dexter and the thing that made it such a breath of fresh air when it first appeared.",1369094400,,4653,4.735148514851486

5237910,2,B00915G6WQ,"I own every season of Dexter and couldn't wait for season 7.  Ive felt that the show has been going down hill for some time now sadly as it became more and more unlikely, less about the psychology of what is happening, and frankly, increasingly more boring.  As slow and dull as season 6 was, it at least still had some great, taut, suspenseful parts to it as well as some truly horrific imagery.  It also ended with a huge bang.  For season 7, they really didn't bother.

**SPOILERS**

!. They completely forgot to add any suspense to the entire season.  I mean not one ounce

2. One of the main things has always been Dexter trying to hide his big secret, his dark passenger if you must. Is it just me, or was there no secret to hide this time around? Deb knew, the new girlfriend Hanna knew, hell Laguerda knew. Granted the captain was trying to get Dexter, but was there ever even a moment in which you ever felt she might?

3. In the final episode at the end, Deb shows up at the container and draws her gun. Was there even a fraction of a second in which you weren't absolutely certain shed kill Laguerta? How much more predictable and one dimensional could this season have been?

4. Was there ever really even a bad guy, an arch nemesis this time around? Sure, you had Isaak Sirko play the enemy for a couple of episodes, but pretty soon even hes just another friend that also knows the big secret and keeps it to himself, then dies anyway.

5. Where was the creepy? Where was the mystery? Where was the WTF? Not one moment of any of the episodes ever had you guessing, shocked, confused or even on the edge of your chair for even 2 minutes.

I believe the 8th season coming up may be the final one.  It really needs to be if this was indicative of all the show makers have left.",1369008000,9,1787,4.2514792899408285

5237913,5,B00915G6WQ,"I only watch two shows on TV, Dexter and the few episodes of Sherlock Holmes (British version) so maybe my exposure to shows is minimal, but I love Dexter.  This season has been great, though there are a few things I think could have been done better.  Without any spoilers, I think they are rotating some characters through this season much more than previous seasons.  They introduce what seem to be longer-term characters and suddenly the characters stop being a part of the story.

The other glaring issue is that I am not as convinced about some of the methods being used to hide Dexter's secret life from the authorities.  The Miami Metro police seem to solve really tough crimes in the show but bumble any time they get something that could expose Dexter because of some simple little diversion that was used.

In a similar vein, the side story with Quinn is also a bit tough to believe that he would get away with his dealings.

Despite a few complaints (which I could come up with for every season and every other show on TV), I still love this show and season 7 doesn't disappoint.",1369008000,,1091,4.535714285714286

5237937,5,B00915G6WQ,"DEXTER's seventh season may be considered the season of mistakes of which Dex certainly makes; the season of revelations; the season of female adversaries in conflict with our serial killing hero.  After a somewhat disappointing 6th season, the writers pull out all the stops in a sometimes hard to believe plot twists script.  But in spite of its weaknesses, I found myself riveted and involved and glad I wait on the DVD to avoid waiting week to week.  I watched all 12 episodes in three nights!
It's well known that Season 8 is the last so its direction can pretty much go anywhere.  The acting is generally flawless---Michael C. Hall is brilliant in his gradual progression to an even more sinister character.  Are the writers preparing us to see Dexter in a darker light?  Jennifer Carpenter acts up a storm as Deb faces an inconceivable truth about her brother.  The remaining regular cast especially David Zayas, Lauren Valez and CS Lee are great.  Desmond Harrington and his Quinn foul-up Quinn have become tiresome and superfluous.
Yvonne Strahovski as the deadly Hannah is remarkably effective, possibly more frightening soulmate for Dexter.  Ray Stevenson brings a cruel detachment as Izaak and Jason Gedrick seems to relish his role as heartless George. Dexter's runinations with Daddy James Remar are becoming redundant as well.
I have enjoyed the ride with the Dark Passenger but I agree with the decision to go out while the series is still strong.  And how about that dynamite season 7 finale!!!!",1368921600,,1512,4.964285714285714

5237974,3,B00915G6WQ,"Seasons 1 through 5 of Dexter are exceptional television.  Season one we set the stage, kill the brother.  Season two is the Dokes resolution.  Then its Jimmy Smits, Trinity, and Lumen.  All amazing, all different, all focused on a killer v. killer plot line, dangerous for Dexter, growth in an outside of normal reality way.  Then we got season six, which was almost a total waste of time, now seven tries to recapture the old magic, but fails.  There are too many little plot lines, and the big plot line is Deb v. Deb.

It has always been problematical for viewers to believe that Dexter could be so careful and so careless at the same time.  For example, he never has his apartment alarmed, yet he always keeps incriminating evidence there.  He grabs people in public places, etc.  This season is the worst in that regard, beginning with his carelessness is letting Deb see him.

The interplay with the Ukranians should have been the central plot, but it is resolved too quickly and too easily.  I love Yvonne Strahovski, but I don't think she's used to her best here.  The whole can two killers date should have been more than just a tease for us, and she's too smart to go after Deb in a way she had to know Dexter would figure out.

Season eight is going to be the end, and that's a good idea.  I think the creators ran out of great ideas when Lumen rode away, and we've spent two years frustrated by seeing what could have been, rather than what is.  The ending was terrible, made me wish they had followed the books and LaGuerta was already dead years ago.

5238006,2,B00915G6WQ,"The overall theme of the disappointing season seven of ""Dexter"" can be summed up in a quote from one of the producers; ""People have to remember that Dexter is not a superhero. He's a bad guy; a serial killer"".
""Dexter"" was one of the few programs left on TV that I would actually set time aside to watch. The writing was intelligent, it had a strange and engaging sense of humor and had a mostly superb cast. What season seven managed to do was lose the fine line of good taste that made the show such a joy to watch.
For some reason it was felt that Deborah need to develop an incestuous desire for Dexter. There were six seasons ahead of this establishing Deb's sense of family loyalty, they did not need to fly off in this uncharacteristic line to establish her motives for the final episode. Her conflict over this felt contrived and forced.
There have been complaints over the killing of Maria but considering the inconsistency of the character I personally felt she should have gone long ago. She's a selfish, amoral, bask stabbing political animal; no, wait, she has a deeply motivating love of community - oops, um, no - it's her sense of duty that drives her. It really seemed that during several seasons they had no idea of what to do with her so they pulled some story line out of the air to accommodate keeping the character on the air. This, however, is not the reason why the killed of Maria; they needed a lynch pin to drive season eight and that was it.
Even more problematic for season seven was their inability to maintain the sense of humor. The attempt was there but the execution left much to be desired. Whether it was in the editing or the script is hard to tell, but Dexter's funny little internal observations come off as morbid and angry. All through this season he keeps telling Deborah that this is his territory, he's used to problem solving in this atmosphere. The funny little observations he would make over his irritations are now ruthless and devoid of wit.
I will purchase this season but I will wait until it is drastically reduced in price. That purchase is more about my ""OCD"" sense of continuity in that I have all the prior seasons. If you're a casual fan and don't have the other DVD sets then rent ""Dexter"" season seven or borrow a friend's.

5238009,4,B00915G6WQ,"Dexter gets no respect. Showtime has continued to offer little to nothing in the way of ""special features"" for the series. While that might not be a big deal for some, it is, for others, one of the reasons that they buy a DVD or Blu-ray. In this instance, the DVD has better ""special features"" because you get access to the episode from other Showtime series (""The Borgias: Season Two-episodes 1 & 2 and the pilot for the series ""Ray Donovan"", biographies--something that was out of date a decade ago). Blu-ray buyers get only the pilot for ""Ray Donovan"". Oh, and to add insult to injury the pilot episode is only available as a Ultra Violet Download.

Four stars for the season, no stars for the special features.

I digress.

The seventh season proved that there was still some life in ""Dexter"". The previous season showed promise but it fully flowers here on the seventh.

SPOILERS:

Dexter is caught just after a kill by his sister Debra. She becomes complicit in Dexter's activities because she chooses not to turn him in. She also believes that she can help Dexter control his impulses. Dexter himself becomes involved with a woman who went on a killing spree as a teenager and now quietly runs her own gardening business--except she hasn't exactly given up killing.

She suggests that Dexter doesn't have a Dark Passenger at all--that it's all part of HIM which forces Dexter to re-evaluate who he is.

END OF SPOILERS:

The Blu-ray for Dexter looks exceptionally good. The early Blu-rays released by CBS for Showtime were a mixed bag with nice detail but had issues with noise. ""Dexter: The Seventh Season"" looks darn near perfect with skin tones spot on, solid blacks and exceptional detail.

The lossless 5.1 mix sounds marvelous as well with excellent use of the format to immerse you in the action. It's an amazingly detailed soundtrack with sounds everywhere. There's also the option for 2.0 surround as well as 5.1 French and Spanish audio tracks.

Unfortunately, subtitles are ONLY provided in English which, given that this also has French & Spanish 5.1 mixes available is an odd choice, indeed.

We spoke about special features earlier. This continues to be a failing for ""Dexter"". Curiously, Jennifer Carpenter tweeted earlier this year that she had completed a commentary track for the seventh season which begs the question--where is it? My guess is that once the show wraps up, CBS will release a boxed set complete with commentary tracks and other special features forcing the hardcore ""Dexter"" fans to pony up yet again for something they may have already purchase. If that IS the case, shame on CBS/Paramount/Showtime.

We get the pilot for ""Ray Donovan"" but that's all folks. It's somewhat embarrassing that what used to be Showtime's flagship series (winner of multiple awards)is treated so shoddily on Blu-ray and DVD.

 For those fans who watched the original run on Showtime and want to own this on Blu-ray, the only advantage is that this looks better here than the compressed high def version that ran on Showtime. Aside from that't there's not much else to entice fans.",1368489600,4,3101,4.859582542694497

5238085,5,B00915G6WQ,"So much has happened this season and it brought me back into the show as far is feeling all the ups and downs, characters that have been sort of had been 'robots' the last few seasons without the attachment I felt to most of them since the beginning. It was nice to see them as ""human"" with their own demons and conflicts, which made me feel angry,sad,happy,conflicted..I was invested once again.
With that said I know the end is near, I see so many plot lines for season 8 as I feel some foreshadowing was exposed in the finale. Hannah saying she always thought it would be Dex going to jail or killed first. Do you think she may be the end of Dex? His first love, her grasp on him with her knowing it is dangerous, as she may be the survivor of the fittest which was talked about at the end with the ""grim reaper"" who decided the snitch had to die ( Dex's mom).
I know that the scene was meant to be speaking of Dex's conflict on killing Laguirta (Dex's snitch-the one who found him out) but I believe it could apply to Hannah also,as Dex was the snitch-to keep his sister safe,it also shows me Hannah's love for Dexter is not truly love,for she wouldn't harm someone so important to him, whatever the cost maybe,you don't do something that drastic if you TRULY love the person (example)Deb and Dex,it may not be a sexual relationship but it is love at its purest form,the kind that is equal in what they would do for each other and not what is best for themselves-as Hannah only cares for what she wants. That again could very well be seen differently also, as do these killers really ""love' and their 'love'is most likely not something I would relate to as I am not a killer and fortunately don't have a clue as to what 'feelings' they have,but they are defiantly not the norm. These writers are clever and that foreshadowing (if it is) can very well been a set up for next season without us truly realizing it with such an emotional ending that had me focused entirely on the events unfolding and the end of Laguirta's story,Debs conflict,emotions, Dex's undeniable loyalty to his sister as her to him was just a rollercoaster and reality check for me as a viewer. How they pulled me in was great to experience again with the show. It was after watching again and knowing the outcome, I picked up clues (or a vivid imagination ;) ) but so many scenes had double meaning to me. Did anyone else see any bits that make you question exactly what words applied to not just this episode but also planting seeds and perhaps showing seeds planted years ago, with the inclusion of Doakes flashbacks as another example.
I truly hope Hannah isn't the end of Dexter, with one season of her character (but significant in being the ""one"" love for Dex) but not significant enough as me the viewer to be powerful enough for any conclusion in the series as she isn't someone I feel invested in after many years of watching the show, and this is just my opinions, me maybe reading to much into the episode that i'm playing detective, so please feel free to tell me I'm nuts (kindly i hope) but I would like to know if others have insights also, and what they may be.
I feel Batista will be involved and not retired next season, I also think Quinn will be a player/for Dex, as he knows their is something up with Dex, and with his own demons I feel he will be helpful in someway to Dex in season 8.
Deb I am at a lost for where this character is going, she could also be the one to end the madness, if so, I think it may include the end for her as well. I don't think she can go on doing what she does to save her brother, but I don't think she can go on without Dexter. If she is the one to stop things, I think she will take her life as well.
I hope I am writing this in the correct area, as I did review some of this episode, but speculating quite a bit on next season, but that is coming from what I observed from this episode and season in general. So I apologize if I went off topic here (new to reviewing) and just want to share and hear what others have to say.
I will end here,I'm sure I have more to say on this subject as it digests some more, but thank you all to have read this long review and now I will put out of your misery ;) if I have made no sense.
Great episode, season and can't wait til next season starts!
Take care all :)

5238086,5,B00915G6WQ,"all these seasons in and instead of my interest waning, i am instead front and center every time in the late summer enthralled by dexter.  season seven was no exception.  when the last scene unrolled and this season was concluded, i was engulfed by questions i'd never had about dexter before this.  i seem to be the only one here who had this response to this season.  but here goes:

why have i been assuming that Harry, dexter's father, is exactly what he seems to be, a great cop looking out for his serial killer son (who indeed is probably his own as dexter's late mother was his informant)? why have i been assuming that Harry, his wife and daughter are pure as the driven snow and dexter is the only psychopath in the family? why?  because Harry tells me so every time his ghost is on screen. there is so much else going on this season that i don't know why this question started plaguing me now but it did.

as for the season itself, one deft touch is to have miami's worst police detective, the Latina spitfire LaGuarda  hot on Dexter's trail as a serial killer. she's right but she stumbles all over trying to catch him.  i just loved this aspect.

then we have a gay russian mobster hot on dexter's trail for killing his lover. as he becomes more and more unhinged over his lover's death, dexter becomes the least of his problems--remember these three words which do not exist in the russian vocabulary together as far as the other russian mobsters are concerned--""gay russian mobster"".

we also have a female serial killer with whom dexter falls in love.  deb goes berserko over this development.

great season which you must watch!!!!!

When the Box Set comes out after Season 8 ends... They have to have the Box Set be a wooden box like Dexter's blood slides. How awesome would that be! It would open up the same way and everything! They could split all eight seasons into their own sleeves(so like 16-24 or so discs) and have them be like his blood slides. SHOWTIME PEOPLE PLEASE DO THIS.",1365811200,2,512,4.288659793814433

Dexter isn't following his code much anymore, turning him into an unlikable typical serial killer
Some great acting by Jennifer Carpenter though especially in the finale( and the final climactic scene)

IM hoping the next seasons redeems itself

Alas, season 8 will be it's farewell season, and I cannot describe how missed it will be. It still stands, in my mind, as the best written and acted stories I've seen put to television. Some seasons have had its slow runs (3, 6, sometimes 5) but this show never ceases to amaze. And now we are at the brink; Season 7 proved to be every bit as good as seasons 1,2 and 4...And to be honest, I have no idea how Deb and Dexter are going to get out of this one.

5238127,5,B00915G6WQ,"My son introduced my wife and I to Dexter with a Christmas present of the first two seasons on DVD a couple of years ago.  Up till then I only recall hearing about the series from the nominations it received and won for various awards.  To say we were blown away by the series is an understatement.  To me this is one of the most original shows ever produced for TV.  The premise is genius - a serial killer hunting other killers.  Try to think of another TV show with a truly original idea.  It's all pretty much been done to death for most formats.  Same old same old.

The ensemble cast on Dexter is superb - one and all.  Michael C. Hall is simply amazing and continues to evolve season over season as does Jennifer Carpenter.  Unlike some other who have said they tired of the show during certain seasons I have never lost interest and don't think I ever would.  But, sadly, that is not to be tested as season 8 will be the final for the series. I will miss it immensely but understand the desire by Showtime and the producers to take the show out on a high note.

So, season 7?  A great year for the series. It picks up right where season 6 ends - with Deb discovering Dexter is not who she thought he was.  Great villains in this season with two parallel story lines leading up to an surprise climax.  I anxiously await season 8 yet dread what the series finale might hold for Dexter and Deb.  We'll know soon as the final season begins 6/30/13.

As others have noted, you should watch this series from the beginning to truly understand and appreciate it.  In fact, I have just gone through seasons 1-6 again and found them as enjoyable as the first time I watched them.  Jumping into the series in the middle would be pretty confusing and I think other reviewers have said as much.

The writers do a fine job with this new brother/sister conflict that has emerged. There are bits of seasons 1 - 6 that are tied into this season very accurately. Remember the ""Ice Truck Killer"" and ""Bay Harbor Butcher""? The beautiful Aimee Garcia is superb as Dexter's new love interest. I believe I had never seen her acting before and she is great here. Very real and convincing! A fine, fine season indeed! Season 8 cannot start soon enough. The cliff hanger to end this season was shocking and I can't wait for more!",1359676800,,654,4.368852459016393

Besides, you get to see two of the most beautiful women on television (Carpenter and Strahovski).  I am still reeling by the season finale. It was unexpected, suspenseful and extremely well written.

5238154,5,B00915G6WQ,"I have to admit I almost lost interest in the show after Season 5.  Season 6 was pretty good I thought (Edward James Olmos in a villainous role was kind of fun and I thought he did a good job).  But Season 7 has just been great and for so many reasons.  First of all there are lots of very poignant jewels of wisdom in Dexter's reflections on life and these ring true even for those who are not serial killers.  Second, they shifted the plot up in season 7 - it's not just Dexter against some new psycho, but rather Dexter in love with the new psycho, not to mention other interesting subplots, including one that develops in a big way and will lead us with great anticipation into the next season.  This anticipation for the next season was something I didn't experience after season 5.  But it's here in spades at the end of season 7!  OK, and finally, the last reason I like this show is that it's often darkly humorous.  Among other things, it's kind of funny bringing Sgt Doakes back into the picture - every time Doakes comes into the picture I just gotta laugh.. He's like a smaller version or Mr T, but on steroids!!!  I really started enjoying this show once I accepted it for what it is - a show!!  I don't demand perfect logic or beleivability in every scene, though I appreciate them when they're there.. but rather I am happy to enjoy the show in the same way I might enjoy a comic book.  It has that quality about it, and it doesn't make it any the less enjoyable.  Great screenplay writing in this season - very imaginative and creative and good on many levels.

After last year's somewhat abysmal season and painfully unfair cliffhanger finale, season 7 (the one before the last!) really picks up.  There's a lot of good 'ol fashioned Dexter drama, and while there was plenty of over attention to guest star storylines while neglecting the main cast (like always!), the best part of this season is how the relationship between Dexter and Debra is really explored.  Debra has to deal with a LOT of emotions from what she witnessed in the season six finale, and this season is very Jennifer Carpenter and Michael C. Hall focused (Debra and Dexter Morgan), which is a GREAT thing for this show.

DEBRA/DEXTER - hands down, the interactions between the two are the best moments of the season.  They're better than all of the other interactions and character development combined by far, and Hall and Carpenter are such amazing actors that other actors at times have difficulty keeping up with them in terms of skill (Velez as Laguerta is a good example).  Carpenter is definitely one of the most underrated actresses on television.  While I know Dexter may not be the best show of all time, Carpenter could literally be given the worst script ever and turn it into gold.  Carpenter is really what makes this season shine to its fullest, and it's really a travesty that she wasn't nominated for a Golden Globe!  And her performance in the finale was really heart-wrenching and beautifully done.

Oh, and no, and the show didn't forget about Debra realizing she's in love with her brother.

LAGUERTA - Laguerta finds a blood slide in the first episode at Travis' murder scene and starts to do some serious investigation into whether or not the Bay Harbor Butcher is still alive and well.  This causes a lot of drama and confusion for Laguerta, who becomes increasingly more prevalent as the season progresses.  Matthews also comes back, and he's just as big of a jerk as ever.

JOEY QUINN - eh.  Definitely one of the worst storylines of the season.  Something about him and a stripper and some guy is mad about....I don't know.  It was so boring I literally already forgot about it.

BATISTA - Batista is also incredibly pointless this season.  He has dreams to open some lame restaurant and retire.  I don't know.  Dexter tends to value its guest stars a lot more than its core cast.

Speaking of....GUEST STARS -

HANNAH - Hannah McKay was the accomplice of a serial killer as a teen, and ended up being let go for a variety of factors.  Hannah and Dexter have great on-screen chemistry when they talk to each other, and there's something hauntingly ominous in her eyes that reminds Dexter of himself.  They have secrets to share.  And she becomes a huge part of the storyline as the season progresses, including a couple very vicious verbal run-ins between her and Debra.  A bad character?  No.  But the way her storyline turned out toward the end of the season really leaves me scratching my head in confusion.

SIRKO - Issak Sirko is the boss of a Ukrainian criminal organization called Koshka (which means little kitty cat in Russian...very scary) and played by the amazing Ray Stevenson (Titus in HBO's Rome).  Unfortunately, as much as I love Stevenson, his storyline was one of the biggest bombs of the season.  While I'm glad they decided to use Hannah and Sirko as guest stars this season instead of one big, bad menacing evil person, Sirko fell flat because he seemed to be nothing short of a cartoonish villain.  I never found him to be particularly interesting or scary, and it's comparable to Quinn in the terms that it's so bad that I'm almost blocking it out of memory.

FUN - this season is fun because with a couple of exceptions, it wasn't trying to be bigger than it's supposed to be.  Dexter always thrives when it tries to be more classic fun and thrilling rather than thought-provoking and touching.  While it doesn't always fail at that, I do feel the writers have difficulties at times when trying to make their characters too deep.  Without spoiling anything, there's a certain scene later in the episode where Dexter has some kind of daydreams (or maybe they were dreams) of what his future could be like, and it just felt cheesy, out of place, and even spoiled the ending of the episode if you really paid attention.

However, there's not a whole lot of that this season, and the finale is one of the best I may have ever seen on Dexter.  It wasn't a disgusting cheap cliffhanger like last season; it wrapped things up nicely for the season that just finished while still leaving plenty of loose ends.  It sets a darker, ominous tone that we've ever felt on Dexter before.  And with next season being the last (most likely), expect for the traditional Dexter formulae to change dramatically...there really is no telling what will happen next!

What is truly worth watching it though?  Even if every other storyline *was* terrible this season?  The interactions between Dexter and Debra.  Not only are the acting performances amazing, but Debra is so well-written and completely believable in every difficult line she delivers.  Debra has been a very consistent character along with Dexter since the beginning of the series, so seeing the two develop their relationship between each other so much is really a treat to watch.",1356048000,2,5299,4.760964912280702

There are definitely some things about this season that bug me, involving too much suspension of disbelief even for television, but I am willing to look past all that because the good stuff about this season was just THAT good. If I had to sum it up, I'd say that Season 7 really focuses on personal relationships, especially those between Dexter and his sister, Deb, and Dexter and Hannah, a new face who connects with Dexter in an unexpectedly intense way. A lot goes down in Season 7, and the season finale will shock you just as much as the Season 6 finale did. This show has spun off in an even darker, more complicated direction than ever before, and it will be great to see what happens in Season 8. I can't wait!",1355702400,7,887,4.317365269461078

The season finales ending stumped me. What happened? There's a huge gap at the end.

5238184,5,B00915G6WQ,"I loved the first four seasons but the fifth and sixth seasons, especially six, were sub par at best. It lost so much of it's edge and originality that made this show so special. But season seven has just saved it. I heard that eight might be the last, if so I will be saddened. The season actually has about 4 major plot lines. The first is Debra's realization of Dexter's alter ego, The Bay Harbor Butcher and how she must deal with and eventually accept it. Especially since she just discovered she's in love with him. The second is Isaak, a Ukrainian mob boss whose gay lover just happened to land on Dexter's table, enter serial killer #1. The third plot line is Hanna, a poisoner who becomes Dexter's first true love. And the final major plot is LaGuerta putting the pieces together and too realizing that Dexter's the real Butcher not Doakes. I just finished the last episode and the final five minutes kept me on my toes. When she pulled the trigger, I damn near fell out of of my chair. This is what the die-hard viewers have been looking forward to for three years. I would suggest you go for the Blu-ray.

Dexter falls in love with a poisonist who he ends up saving from criminal charges on a few occassions- even going as far to kill the woman's father. I mean what is this- this show is just sick now.

5238188,3,B00915G6WQ,"It hurts me to give Dexter less than Five stars, and the show itself deserves five stars. This season is fantastic too.  What I am commenting on  here is the poor dvd sets Showtime produces. The Dexter DVD sets have no, or next to no, extras on them that actually relate to the show. Instead, they make you go online to find any extras. Then they load the set you are actually paying for down with single episodes of other Showtime series they want to try and get you to buy, most of which you will have no interest in at all. Then, for the past two seasons, they have put ads for their other shows, several minutes worth, at the start of every disk in the set,and engineered it so you cannot skip or fast forward though the ads to get to the menu. This means that forever, every time you load a disk, you will have to sit through the ads with no way to avoid them. It really shows Showtime's total disrespect and distain for their customers. I would advise waiting on ordering this set and see if Showtime is going to pull  the same shoddy tricks with their viewers and customers they have pulled on the last two DVD sets. At that point decide if you are willing to put up with Showtime's dirty tricks. Will I still end up buying this set? Probably,since I love the show and this season. But by not preordering so far in advance I hope a message is sent to Showtime that they are abusing their customer loyalty and to let them know that their tricks are alienating their customers. I for one will never by a Showtime dvd set other than Dexter, that is for sure. Showtime cannot be trusted.

Adding this to my entry here on 04-19-2013: I just learned that there will be no Dexter extras other than the biographies of the actors again. What is being put on the disks are as follows:

Special Features:

Ray Donovan (Pilot Episode) on Disc 4 on DVD; via UltraViolet on Blu-ray
First two episodes of the Second Season of The Borgias (DVD only)
First two episodes of the First Season of House of Lies (via E-Bridge Technology on DVD)
Biographies (DVD only)

As far as I am concerned, these are not ""Special Features"".  They are advertising to try and get you to buy their other series as well as Dexter. Special Features, in my opinion, are extras that relate to the show you are buying. Since this follows their same pattern as the previous couple of years releases for Dexter, I fear they will also treat their customers and fans as idiots and include the forced advertising at the start of every disk as well. At the price they are asking, I for one am going to hold off buying this season of Dexter for a year and see if the price drops to something more reasonable for a bare bones release loaded with annoying forced ads and unrelated episodes of other shows.",1353369600,61,2761,4.357976653696498
5238189,5,B00915G6WQ,"I began watching the 7th Season with low expectations.  I became disappointed with Dexter after Season 4 as some of the murders became inplausable and I thought the series lacked the creativity and suspense of the first two seasons.  The show's pattern of watching Dexter stalk other serial killers became too familiar with less attention focused on character development.  In my experience, it is *character development* that makes a series like this so watchable.  With Season 7, the show has restored itself to a level of viewership found in earlier seasons.

In Season 7, while Dexter's character continues to evolve, the show focuses more on Deb's character.  Watching Deb and Dexter interact is fascinating - they both evolve in their relationship as each learns more about one another.  As Deb learns more about Dexter, we watch with anticipation how she reacts as she battles her own demons.  The evolution of Deb's character takes center stage in this season, a break in the series.  Dexter's new nemesis - the head of a crime family played with charm and great intensity by Ray Stevenson - is far more complex than the killer in Season 6.

Yvonne Strahovski does a terrific job playing Hannah McKay - a mysterious and cunning character who has the rare opportunity of getting close enough to Dexter to earn some of his trust.  One of the more philosophical questions this season poses is the cost/benefit of making yourself vulnerable in relationships.  And Erik King makes a welcome and sometimes humorous return playing Doakes during flashbacks - the only person who was on to Dexter from the beginning.

A great show like Dexter takes the audience to a place it's never been before.  In season 1, we had a glimpse for the very first time how a serial killer might think and feel on an intimate level.  In Season 7, the audience is taken to another place we can only try to imagine: what would it be like to learn your brother was a serial killer?  How would you feel?  And what would you do if your job was to protect the public from the very kind of person your brother had become?  Watching someone work through the complexity of these emotions makes great television.  To keep this series fresh after 6 seasons, the show had to do more than its already done.

The producers have made wise decisions by taking the audience back into new territory.  So if you've watched the other 6 seasons and are thinking of quitting, give this season a chance.",1351728000,194,2461,4.730046948356808
