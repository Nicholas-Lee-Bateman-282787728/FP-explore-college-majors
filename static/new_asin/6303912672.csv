7855266,3,6303912672,"In ""Lucy Goes to Mexico"" (Aired: October 6, 1958), the sixth episode of ""The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour,"" The Ricardos and the Mertzes are in San Diego, where Ricky is rehearsing with Maurice Chevalier (you can never have too many foreign accents) for a show they will be doing for the Navy on the aircraft carrier, the U.S.S. ""Yorktown.""  Meanwhile, Lucy and Ethel head for Tijuana, bent on finding bargains and souvenirs galore, with Fred tagging along to try and head off disaster.  Surprisingly things go okay, until they try crossing the border back to the U.S. and the Customs officer (Charles Lane) discovers a young Mexican boy (Alan Costello) in the trunk of the car: he wants to see the aircraft carrier Senora Ricardo has told him about.  The good news is that Ricky and Chevalier show up to bail everybody out of jail.  The bad news is that since Chevalier is a French citizen, he cannot get back into the United States (pretend this makes sense and remember the comic value of people speaking English, Spanish and French at high speed at the same time).  Obviously, since the U.S. Customs can spot a grown man in a trunk as easily as a small boy, there is only one solution to this problem, and that is for Lucy to end up fighting a bull in a bull ring as Max the matador.
Given that the bull fighting bit is less than inspired, the best part of ""Lucy Goes to Mexico"" turns out to be the singing, with Arnaz and Chevalier (together and separately) singing ""Something's Gotta Give,"" ""Louise,"" ""La Cucaracha,"" ""Valentine,"" ""Mimi,"" ""Yankee Doodle Dandy.""  ""The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour"" was not so much a television series as a series of full-hour specials.  After the 1956-57 season of ""I Love Lucy"" the cast decided they wanted to experiment with the hour-long format.  The idea was that the Ricardos and the Mertzes would travel to different locations and be involved with various guest stars.  Actually, the episodes originally ran under the title of ""The Lucille Ball-Desir Arnaz Shows,"" and the abbreviated title was used when these specials were aired on CBS as summer series for five years (1962-67).  This particular endeavor is just not that special.",1071273600,,2162,4.75668449197861
