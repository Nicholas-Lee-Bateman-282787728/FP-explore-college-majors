1848679,5,B00008K77T,"When the dean of architectural historians, H. Allen Brooks, sits in the freshly restored, second floor dining room of the Arthur Heurtley House and demonstrates Wright's masterful manipulation of space, vista, repose and simplicity with perfect examples surrounding him, you know you are in good company. Never has Wright's genius with space been so clearly demonstrated. Wright was the first to say that his architecture could not be experienced fully except through personal on-site experience. Fallingwater is more serene, more spiritual, than the famous soaring balcony view indicates; the Johnson Wax workroom's top-lit tranquilty defies representation.
This video is rich with archival photographs juxtaposed with richly detailed and colored contemporary equivalents. There is a detective-story quality to many of the fortuitous finds: the buried urn fragments in the back yard, the china cupboard doors, with original glass intact, discovered in the basement, the shadow of a long-missing inglenook found on the fireplace bricks. And, one is treated to a very up-close and personal tour of one of Wright's early masterpieces. The Heurtley House now joins the Dana, May and Boynton Houses as the most perfect extant examples of the Prairie genre.
With all its wonderful visual and historical qualities and the very special presence of Dr. Brooks, it is to the project manager that I give highest praise. His commentary as the camera enters the house and slowly climbs the stairs to the second-storey living room is the most succinct, accurate and elegantly simple capturing in words and two dimensional images of Wright's space and procession genius ever seen away from the work in question. One moves from dimness to light, from narrow to expansive, from compression to an explosion of space- part reality - part illusion. All magic.
This video is the next best thing to an actual visit to the house. This video is about architecture at its best, whereas the PBS specials are about sensation with architecture as a backdrop.",1050883200,3,2031,5.291021671826625
1848680,5,B00008K77T,"The film is stylish and informative, bringing to life the fascinating process of discovery and restoration carried out on on of the jewels in the crown of America's prince of architects. A friend of mine passed on an advance copy of this video to me, as I work in the restoration of Victorian homes in the U.K.  I was exceedingly pleased with this documentary.  The filmmaker pays careful attention to the kind of meticulous details of the restoration process which interest a practitioner like myself.  Yet even my wife, whose tastes in telly and film are diametrically opposed to my own, was drawn by the elegant treatment of this exquisite subject.  We both give the video five stars!",1045872000,,687,4.796610169491525

7984815,4,B00008K77T,An interesting account of a challenging restoration. We owe a great deal to enthusiasts who spend their own resources to maintain these vulnerable elements of the architectural heritage.,1467590400,,186,5.678571428571429
7984816,4,B00008K77T,"I loved the film. The process of the renovation was detailed and the Chicago accents were very sweet.
The thing is that I am so passionate and admiring of the resurrection of these houses that I can't get enough.
Would have loved this to be a six part series so I could bathe in even more extensive detail.
Thank you to the new owners and the incredible craft persons who made this possible.

7984817,5,B00008K77T,"The historical photography helped give an appreciation of just how much was done in the restoration. The details of the research into original condition showed the level of care, and the pictures of the processes involved made clear the fact that no expense was spared in the process of arriving at the ideal solution.",1384041600,,318,4.907407407407407
7984818,5,B00008K77T,"It's hard to find anything 'new' about the great American architect Frank Lloyd Wright as it seems I have just about every book, video and audio book, and audio interviews there is. This was an eye-opener and very informative regarding the work that went into restoring this wonderful home by Wright. The work that went into planning, reproducing, repairing the Heurtley house is astonishing. So much care and planning and budgeting by so many wonderful craftsmen is amazing! A must see video on just one home by this greatest architect of the 20th century. Thank you so much for producing this masterpiece!",1380672000,,607,4.96078431372549
7984819,4,B00008K77T,"The run time of this film is 52 minutes, including the credits, not 92 minutes as stated under Product Details.  Extra features, such as ""Meet the Owners"" and photos of the house before, during, and after restoration, are about another 5 minutes each.  It's a well done film that will be of interest to Wright fans, especially restoration architects, but it is not 92 minutes long.",1324944000,2,381,4.757575757575758
7984820,5,B00008K77T,"Excellent documentary hosted by architectural historian H. Allen Brooks. The colors and music are fantastic.  Gives more insight as to hat Wright was accomplished in the original ""Prairie style ""design and how they could recapture the design and still incorporate today's technology.",1277424000,2,283,5.738095238095238

7984823,5,B00008K77T,"We just saw the house as part of the 2007 Wright Plus Tour and this program gave us a chance to revisit this now privately owned home.  This home may not be open to the public again for some time and this program is an indepth visit that can be enjoyed over and over again.

The painstaking effort revealed in this documentary is an inspiration for anyone who is contemplating or in the middle of a restoration project.  The many experts interviews from a variety of disciplines shows what a group effort this was.  Seeing the walls and ceiling striped down and learning how they overcame huge problems like the sagging ceiling in the play room (the lowest level) was exciting.  Just hearing the process of determining what to restore and what to remove was instructional.  So glad the restoration was so carefully documented.",1180915200,,826,4.701388888888889
