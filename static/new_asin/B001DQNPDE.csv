3536969,5,B001DQNPDE,"This is a great dvd to wake up to in the morning --better than coffee (and I love a latte!).  Its segments make it the perfect practice before work. On weekdays I practice the mat sequence, which is really effective at strengthening and toning core and limbs.  On weekends I attempt the wall poses, which are challenging.  Sadie is very encouraging, and with her positive approach and insightful experience, I've been able to advance far.  A really great way to start the day and make home practice a habit.",1223942400,3,507,4.662921348314606
3536970,5,B001DQNPDE,"I bought this DVD after waching the free videos accessible through Sadies website. I've been practicing yoga from dvd's for just over a year. This dvd gives me everything I want from my practice- poses that are challenging but do-able (still breathing but definitely feeling like your getting a workout), narrators voice is easy to listen to (doesnt become annoying after 10 or more times watching). I used the beginners commentary the first time and found the advice useful. I'll be honest and say that I'm pretty comfortable with the first 40 minutes but I have to work up a little courage for the wall section- but I'm confident I'll get there in the end and Im happy there's something here that pushes the boundaries a bit more! I have been trying to convince my less yoga minded family to give this a go because I think they'd enjoy it without getting bored. Well worth the money- i feel fitter and stronger.",1223942400,13,913,4.6419753086419755
3536971,5,B001DQNPDE,"I was first introduced to Sadie Nardini via her excellent youtube yoga videos. She has a phenomenal teaching style and her youtube videos were always excellent and extremely thorough. I always wondered why she didn't have a DVD out and then I found her Core Strength Vinyasa Yoga Power Hour! It was just released this year and I have to say, it is excellent!!! I think this is appropriate for beginners, intermediate or advanced yoga students. It really concentrates on and builds your core which is very important in yoga (and one of the areas where I am still a little weak). I can really feel my abs working during the DVD and definitely the next day! It moves at a nice pace, not too slow and not too fast. I am dripping in sweat after 60 minutes and I've been doing yoga for 2 years! It's a great workout!",1223251200,25,810,4.406666666666666
3536972,5,B001DQNPDE,"I'm a yoga audio and video junkie.  I've done, watched and listened to many, many, many over the years.
About my yoga likes:  My first yoga love is Ashtanga but I love a power vinyasa practice.  I love to move and I love an instructor with great verbal cues, a strong but calming voice and great body control.  Sadie Nardini fits the bill.  I love the flow in this class.  Her cues are impeccable and her use of her own body to demonstrate placement is something I've never really seen.  It helps that she uses a voice-over technique because her demonstration of poses and movement is outstanding.  The music is fun.  Oh, and the core work is hard!
Buy this DVD - it really is different from the others and it's really enjoyable and a great workout.",1221609600,6,749,4.408759124087592
3536973,5,B001DQNPDE,"Sadie Nardini is one of the best yoga instructors I've encountered in my 28 years of practice.  She's powerful, attractive and has an exuberant personality that lifts your confidence and spirit.  In her DVD she guides you through a dynamic 60 minute power hour that strengthens your entire body as you gain greater flexibility.  Ms. Nardini focuses on the proper alignment of each pose and the importance of strengthening your core muscles.  This DVD also contains three 20-minute bonus segments that help tone your abdominals and sculpt your entire body.

Sadie Nardini is an incomparable yoga instructor, her Core Strength Vinyasa Yoga DVD is a must have in your collection.",1221436800,3,676,5.109090909090909
3536974,5,B001DQNPDE,"I have been back out on the road for the past year and a half, and it's not easy to find yoga classes that fit into a daily production schedule, even on days off. As a result I've often had to practice to dvd's in locker rooms of arenas, or my hotel room.
What I've discovered is that most of the dvd's I've used haven't exactly hit the mark for me. Either the workout's been a little low key, or unchallenging, or the presentation may have been ""all too wonderful / new agey"".  Sometimes the music was so lame it was distracting.
Until NOW.
Sadie's dvd is direct, challenging, but spiritually connected without feeling ""cheesy"".
I highly recommend this dvd. It will be my ""personal yoga teacher"" on the next leg of the tour.
Thank You Sadie. I'm looking forward to your next one.

3536975,5,B001DQNPDE,"Sadie was my first yoga teacher in New York, and she's the one I go to over and over.  Sadie's grace and humor are palpable, and her strength as a teacher is immense.  In her classes, you draw into your core before expressing into the pose, so every single moment of class, you are creating strength and stoking your inner fires.  This dvd is an amazing alternative to taking one of Sadie's overflowing classes in NYC.  You will work, you will tone, and you will stretch, and you will have fun.  This is a transformative workout, and your yoga practice will never be the same.",1218844800,7,576,4.447619047619048
3536976,5,B001DQNPDE,"This DVD makes Sadie Nardini's Core Strength Vinyasa yoga available to all!  You DON'T have to be in NYC to benefit from studying with this remarkable teacher, who welcomes students at all levels, and who will guide you to take your practice to exciting new places.  Sadie Nardini's new DVD really stands out as an opportunity to watch, listen and learn with a superb teacher as you set your intention, strengthen your core and build confidence to achieve your goal.",1218326400,3,466,4.8125
3536977,5,B001DQNPDE,"I've been a student of Sadie's for over 3 years and she is a truly transformational teacher. Physically and mentally i feel amazing after her classes. This DVD is a great way to have more time with her. i love doing it every morning, it's a challenging workout that really kick starts my day.",1217894400,3,292,4.425925925925926
3536978,4,B001DQNPDE,"I rented this video and have done it twice so far.  The first time through I had a hard time with her cues, but the second time it got a little easier, though I still think she's kind of confusing if you aren't completely knowledgeable when it comes to yoga terms.  The workout itself is great and she does a nice variety of moves, so you don't get bored doing sun salutations over and over.  Be aware that there is a lot of core work, which is vital to success in yoga, but not everyone's favorite.  I really enjoyed that she throws in some ""adventure"" poses and introduces you to inversions.  Overall, I really like this video and will probably end up buying it.  I consider myself a beginner yogi with about a year's worth of light flow practice behind me and I do a lot of HIIT/weight lifting and this was definitely challenging.",1390780800,,833,4.376623376623376
3536979,1,B001DQNPDE,"I thought that I was buying a
DVD for my daughter as a gift.  In stead I ended up with a 'down-load, which is useless to me.....I am 79 years old and have health problems",1386115200,,170,3.857142857142857
3536980,2,B001DQNPDE,"I've been doing yoga for several years and in various disciplines. Bottom line was this just didn't work for me. The guidance and changes were too abrupt even for someone who knows the language. The program seemed to struggle with flow and rhythm at times. I'm sure this is a great fit to many. It was certainly challenging at points but not always in ways I felt it needed to be.

Clearly the instructor is talented and the audio-visual quality is pleasing and well done. The instructors voice is also pleasant.",1384560000,,512,4.626373626373627
3536981,3,B001DQNPDE,"I wanted to be guided through a yoga practice and instead I got a new age exercise routine. It's a good workout.  It starts with a pilates core series on the floor rather than the typical vinyasa tadasana/uttanasana/chatturanga/up dog/downdog series.  Every pose is turned into an exercise, as opposed to pausing and working in the pose.  I often don't do the internal movements she describes and stay in the initial pose.
She uses phrases like 'offer your heart"" instead of ""open your chest"", and 'wave"" instead of ""push back"", so I had to keep looking to see what she meant.
But despite the language, it's not spiritual; there's no meditation, no shivasana, no dharma. No inversions, or very mild ones, because inversions require not moving, so they don't contribute to the exercise function. Also not alot of work leading up to poses (the best yoga classes I take work on triangle, say,  for about 10 minutes, using different small variations in the exercise to deepen the twist, open the shoulder, activate that standing leg, etc.). She starts handstand with the jump practice, when a half handstand with feet on the wall is a much better way to start to build the shoulder, arm and core strength you need.
I'd characterize this as an intermediate to advanced level core workout---it's fast, and assumes flexibility and some experience with yoga. If you are looking to strengthen your core and get a pretty good workout in an hour, do it! If you want help building a home yoga practice, probably not for you.",1381622400,4,1512,4.803846153846154
3536982,5,B001DQNPDE,I am new to Yoga and I was looking for something that easy to follow instructions wile at the same time building strength. Sadie Nardini did all that and more. I would definitely recommend this training video.,1380412800,,209,4.675675675675675
3536983,2,B001DQNPDE,"Allow me to preface by saying that the vinyasa was interrupted by streaming/buffering issues, so it may have some influence on my perception.

I found the video to be somewhat tedious and difficult, leaving my low back, wrists, and shoulders aching.  There seemed to be more than average amount of repetition.  Honestly, I may just be leaning toward a flow that is paced with a slower breath.  I found myself having to flow through poses faster than felt natural for me.  In the end, the workout was more stressful than grounding.

That said, there were a few sequences that would help me build strength and balance for poses I find more difficult today.  I may do it again, but not at the end of the day.  Chances are I'll skip it for something that leaves me feeling a little more centered.",1378684800,2,792,4.567375886524823
3536984,3,B001DQNPDE,"Overall, this could be a wonderful addition to someone's yoga collection.  It is challenging and you will work up a sweat.  However, it is a continuous movement program and could behard to follow along and do the poses correctly as there is very little catch up time. It is repetitive and that is helpful, but I felt like I would need to just sit and watch once or twice to really participate and not feel frustrated.",1377216000,,417,4.473684210526316
3536985,4,B001DQNPDE,"Easy to follow, works every part of body. Challenging moves and I didn't get bored. It did fall a little short for me on the wall moves.. but that is when I started using the time to do crunches. All in all, I was satisfied.",1376438400,,224,4.0
3536986,5,B001DQNPDE,"Very systematic workout in the Vinyasa style with Sadie's unique approach to yoga.  Very good teacher, inspiring and aware how to pace a class.  This routine is not for beginners and will help those who have experience to build core strength, stamina in the context of maintaining flexibility.",1373846400,,293,5.083333333333333
3536987,5,B001DQNPDE,"Sadie Nardini is wonderful. I own 2 of her videos and have been using them for the last two years. You feel results pretty immediately, and it's a bit more aerobic than some would typically associate with yoga. If you're on the fence, check out some of her youtube videos- that's how I found her and that's what inspired me to purchase the DVDs.",1372291200,,345,4.40625

3536989,3,B001DQNPDE,"This is a good workout session for someone who is really in good shape and strives to work hard.  I do a vinyasa style yoga and consider myself in pretty good shape.  This tape is for the yoga practitioner who is focused and works out daily.  My focus is on staying healthy at 50+, being supple and having lots of energy.",1368576000,,321,4.229508196721311
3536990,5,B001DQNPDE,"I don't recommend this video for newbies to yoga, but as a long, long time intermediate level yoga, I really like her flow. Its a little unusual, but the instruction is very good, and its a nice change up. Very good for the core.",1361318400,,229,4.2272727272727275
3536991,2,B001DQNPDE,"i've read so much about sadie nardini and couldn't wait to try this. i'm a solid intermediate yogi, and the 1st 5-10 minutes had my lower back hurting. i didn't even bother finishing it. i just couldn't get into it, but maybe it's just me, because i've seen some great reviews for all of her videos. i much prefer Adi Amar and Oliver Reinsch's style. they both just have a much better flow to their yoga instruction that feels less forceful in my opinion.",1358208000,,455,4.428571428571429
3536992,4,B001DQNPDE,Core strength yes. It really activated and lengthened your waist area. It was a string practice but I did not sweat. So...not exactly what I would call a power class. Certainly one for an experienced yoga student though,1356825600,,219,4.7894736842105265
3536993,5,B001DQNPDE,"LOVE THIS!!! Sadie narrates movements over the video. Shot in a white room with big windows: no fuss, no muss, so you can concentrate on her and the moves.  After 40 minutes, section on shoulder and handstands helps unite core and arm/shoulder strength.",1354233600,,253,4.883720930232558
3536994,2,B001DQNPDE,"While out of practice but definetly not new to yoga I found this video very difficult to follow.  The voice over did not match the moves and I found myself plaing catch up the whole workout.  There was little stretchng until the end of the workout.  The only positive I can say was that it was a challenging workout, though definetely for a seasoned yogi's.",1350086400,3,357,4.461538461538462
3536995,5,B001DQNPDE,"The first time I did this video, it seemed way too difficult for me even though I've been doing yoga for years.  I gave it another try a few days later and it didn't seem quite as intimidating. It's definitely a challenging yoga video; but very rewarding and a great way to gain flexibility and strength.  The inverted poses at the end seemed too dangerous to even try; but maybe that's just me.  I loved this video overall.  I do wish it was a bit shorter.  I seem to never make it all the way to the end.",1349913600,,506,4.122448979591836
3536996,4,B001DQNPDE,This is a great video to watch. It's not really instructional and is  pretty fast pace so some experience is helpful. Really keeps your focus and burns calories once you get into the flow.,1346889600,,188,4.529411764705882
3536997,5,B001DQNPDE,I really enjoyed it. There was no fanfare to start which was surprising but fairly awesome after having rented a gaiam yoga video with rodney lee that took forever to get started. This was challenging and fun. I really enjoyed that there were handstands included. It moved quickly and I definitely broke a sweat. I am definitely considering buying this and not just renting it.,1341964800,,377,4.815384615384615
3536998,3,B001DQNPDE,"I am really searching for a new yoga DVD that delivers a thorough practice and results and doesn't make me really hope no one is watching. This one has a lot of advanced elements, which i think is great, and yet is do-able for intermediates and possibly beginners.  I know it's vinyasa, but it's a VERY flowy/dancing sort of yoga that I personally cannot embrace. (Think dancers at Burning Man) If you like that, then this is your video.  If you are looking for a more traditional practice, look elsewhere.  I am glad I experienced it for experiences sake though.",1334275200,,563,4.61
3536999,4,B001DQNPDE,"Being relatively new to yoga with my prior experience being years ago, I found this to be entirely too fast paced for my level - which is not the videos fault. Unfortunately, however, her words frequently don't line up with her movements and you're playing catch up most of the time which makes it hard to find a good rhythm. Not to mention that frequently when she's saying ""Exhale"" the movement she's doing on the screen is for ""Inhale"" and visa versa which makes it frustrating to try and follow especially if you're new like I am. It was good, but could be a lot smoother. I'm sure more advanced people will not have the same frustrations that I did from the videos inconsistencies. I will probably continue to use this video as I become more advanced.",1327795200,7,756,4.525547445255475
3537000,5,B001DQNPDE,"If you are looking for a great yoga video that cuts to the chase and will get you ""cut"", then look no further.  This video focuses on core strength and conditioning.  Reminds me of some of the yoga in P90X: not for sissies or weaklings who just want to use yoga to relax. This lady will work you hard if you follow along! Although she starts you off in lotus with some breathing exercises, she then transitions into challenging movements and poses which are also fast-paced and will lead to a significant burn.  Overall...LOVE this!!!!",1321315200,3,535,4.610526315789474
3537001,4,B001DQNPDE,"Having just completed 15 yoga classes, I'm not a total beginner.  Found this to be in another category.  Certain it is great for more advanced practices, but suggest that the description reveal that this is not ""simple.""  It features many advanced poses which makes it more difficult to follow if you are in a ""still learning"" category.",1316476800,,336,4.859649122807017
3537002,3,B001DQNPDE,"I was looking for something since Netflix took ""Long and Lean Yoga"" by Baron Baptiste off of Netflix streaming.

I'm ecstatic that I found this practice-it challenges me and it's definitely not geared towards a ""please everyone"" mindset.  This isn't a beginner's video-however, it should be doable for a person of moderate flexibility and some prior yoga experience.

I will definitely purchase this (after having just rented).  I'm sure it will be my go to practice as I find myself with no sitter and a desire to deepen my practice in a very real way.",1299715200,12,571,4.568627450980392

So far neither the tapes or the class made a Yoga fan out of me and I thought I am just not a ""yoga chick"".
Then I stumbled on Sadie's free yoga clips on YouTube and followed them diligently for a couple of weeks.
I even started looking forward of completing the routines.
 I was getting tired of having to interrupt the Yoga flow by standing up all the time to click on the next clip on You Tube and decided to order her two CD's.
 I am so happy I did and do the"" Power Hour ""at least every second day.
"" Total Body Transformation and Weight Loss "" is a longer tape, just as fun and I always do it when I have more time on hands.

It was shot in a very bare and stark room; the quality was poor; and the selection of routines on the main menu was limited to two.  I did not have the three 20-minute sections mentioned on the back of the DVD cover, nor did I have the access to the new triple screen format mentioned.

At the same time, I enjoyed the yoga routine on this DVD - it was varied, energetic and included a large amount of abdominal work.",1273968000,3,467,4.224719101123595

So I wanted to support her efforts and bought both dvd's. This is a great workout! A ton of breathing and core strengthening. It's great because you can do as much as you can for that day and come back another day and try it again. She has an excellent and personable attitude and I can't wait to take a class from her in person some day! If you are looking to learn new ways to get in shape and amp up your practice this is an excellent choice. She also gives you beginner alternatives which really helps the newbies and gives you a goal to motivate you!,1258416000,,682,4.174242424242424

I thought what she did show was difficult, but could easily be modified for beginners. However, after looking at the format and reviews of her other DVD (total body transformation for weight loss) I feel ripped off.  This DVD is only 1 hour of material.  I know it is called power hour - but not two many different poses were fit into that hour.

You definitely feel that your core is being addressed, but you are  not suffering in the process.  My only critique is that the voice-over is a bit out of sync with the visuals and it might throw off newer students, regarding when to breath in or out.  It is the kind of video class that you look forward to doing again.  It hits the spot if you can't get to a vinyasa-flow class and is great to keep a home practice going.",1251504000,,527,4.1683168316831685

The problem came when they weren't being offered at the local JC for a time that I could attend (I work during the day) so I decided to try out some DVDs so I could do it at home. I went through all of the reviews for various DVDs and this one was highly recommended. I must say this is one of the best Yoga DVDs I've owned thus far.

Not only do you really have a really good flow, but this is the only DVD that has left me drenched in sweat. Not a bad sweat, but whenever I finish I feel much better than before I had started. I highly recommend this to anyone who's already familiar with Yoga since I think someone who's never tried Yoga may have a hard time keeping up.

3537019,5,B001DQNPDE,"Sadie's CorePower DVD is awesome!  It has a flow that leaves you feeling not only energized but grounded when you are done.  Constant reminders to activate the core have me doing it even as I sit here.  It becomes a mantra to keep in mind through all movement.  Her waterfall warrior and fists of fire, for example, I haven't seen in any other video or class, and they add so much to the poses they are incorporated into.  And my gosh, the workout!  It really targets areas that you forgot you owned, if you choose to go to your own edge.  She does offer alternatives for the difficult moves so you can choose your own workout level as you go.  Thanks for the inspiration! :)

3537020,5,B001DQNPDE,"I purchased 2 yoga dvds at the same time and this one by far is superior.  Sadie does a wonderful job of cueing the body and the yoga is flowing, your heart rate is up within a short time and you really can create a sweat. She does a great job of allowing the body to cool while incorporating some core work.  Your abs will feel this one.  The wall work is a little more challenging with the inversions, but only a few of the poses require working up to.  Great modifications within! Just doing the matwork you get your money worth, wall work is a bonus! Excellent!",1236211200,,565,4.203703703703703
3537021,5,B001DQNPDE,"Excellent workout and you really sweat as well as work your muscles. However, if you are a beginner, this is not for you. This is a lot like yogarobics and not your calm relaxing kind of yoga. If you want to sweat and is still new to yoga, I recommend SELF - Ultimate De-stress Yoga.",1233705600,,283,4.163636363636364
3537022,5,B001DQNPDE,"Sadie is a knowledgeable, creative and sensitive yoga teacher.  This is a wonderful yoga practice which centers around core strength, her specialty.  It is a no nonsense, no frills practice with a teacher who truly embodies the heart and soul of yoga.  This practice is suited for all levels because she explains and demonstrates modifications.  I love Sadie's youtube videos as well.  Can't wait for the second video to be released soon.  A worthy and smart purchase for teachers and students alike.  Go Sadie.......we love you!!!!!",1233532800,,533,5.127906976744186
3537023,5,B001DQNPDE,"Sadie Nardini's videos are perfect for me. Her voice is soothing and interesting, the sets are uncluttered and serene, the sequences are smooth and challenging. She has inspired me to try new poses by breaking them down into smaller steps and suggesting prerequisites. And she seems to be having an enjoyable yoga session herself which encourages me. I recommend the Core Strength Vinyasa Yoga Power Hour to beginners and beyond beginners who want a fast-moving, powerful yoga guide.",1230940800,,483,5.205128205128205
3537024,5,B001DQNPDE,"This product is well worth the money spent. For me, the explicit instruction in exactly how to transition between poses and how to enhance the effect of these transitions was priceless, something that I haven't seen elsewhere.

In addition, I had a question about the product and emailed Sadie directly, I had a response within three hours. Customer support after a sale is made is nice surprise these days. I highly recommend the product and the instructor.",1229731200,,458,4.9480519480519485
3537025,4,B001DQNPDE,"I just finished doing this dvd this morning.  My first impression is that this a hard workout and the physical benefits are worth the effort. However since, power yoga is not my normal practice, I felt like I was missing something.  Perhaps the spiritual aspect of the yoga.  That aside, this a great yoga class to get you into shape.  Lots of planks and up dogs AND lots, I mean lots of ab work.

Setting:  Bare studio with concrete looking floors.  Sadie is set up in front of a window with a heating vent beneath it.  Very stark.  She is on a black mat and is wearing black.  When the camera pulls back, it is hard to distinguish her body from the mat.

Production quality:  I read the back of the dvd cover and it said that you can pick from 2 views, one normal and one 3D where you can see the poses from different angles???? I didn't see that option on my dvd??  The camera was to the side of her throughout most of the class.  Also when I first watched the dvd, I chose the beginners option.  About 5 minutes into that I realized that there was absolutely no cuing, just wah wah wah commentary.  I thought, oh no , another dvd to return to amazon!  Something told me to go back to the menu and just press play.  Aha, cuing, such as it is.  Her cuing is often late and doesn't match the movement.  I don't know how these dvds are made,but I am assuming the audio is added after the video while watching it.  How hard is it to match up the instructions to the movement?  Several times I had to crane my neck to see what was going on only to realize that she had moved on to another pose.

Wow factor:  As I said physically, this was challenging. If you are a beginner as I am when it comes to vinyasa yoga, you will not be able to keep up.  I wasn't able to.  As such, I didn't feel really good after the practice, not like I did after Jennifer Lynn's flow yoga dvd.  It moves really fast and is over in 60 minutes (gratefully!)  Will do it again, only because I am trying to get back in shape and power yoga beats lifting weights any day of the week.

Simple suggestions:  I know she is producing another dvd due out in February (checked out her website).  A couple of suggestions.  Pretty up the space a little.  Cover up the air vent.  Black clothes, different color mat, or vice versa.  Fix the cuing.  This is so important on yoga dvds.  Try different camera angles on poses, it helps, alot.
To me these type of classes are always better when there is more than one person in the class.  Perhaps someone who is less flexible with a diffeent body type.  Just my suggestions for whatever they're worth :)

Overall good dvd. Good class. UPDATE: I returned the dvd.  I went to her website and saw a video clip of her upcoming dvd.  It looks much better and more comprehensive than this one.  I couldn't see owning them both.",1228694400,71,2830,4.2209737827715355
3537026,5,B001DQNPDE,"I am very excited to finally be able to take Sadie's amazing yoga classes with me where ever I go.  She is the very best kind of yoga teacher: one that combines clear, direct instruction with a powerful, centering flow practice and at the same time brings to the program a grace, gentleness and spiritual grounding that exemplifies what yoga is all about: balance, strength, and love.

As someone who has bought a bunch of yoga DVD's over the years, and practiced with innumerable teachers, I can honestly say that I think Sadie, and this DVD, is the best of the best.  For me personally, the best yoga practice is one where I can combine aspects of a meditation/centering practice with a good, old-fashioned workout.

What makes Sadie's DVD--and her approach to yoga--special, is that even though she makes you work hard--building fire and fierceness (as she would say)--she doesn't forget the essential purpose of yoga: to get centered, grounded, and peaceful.  With this DVD, I can bring the joy and sweat of an in-person session with Sadie to my hotel room, my friend's house...everywhere!  Yeah, Sadie, you rock!

Oh...and to the woman who was having difficulty with finding the different short cuts on the DVD, make sure you learn how to use your DVD remote/buttons properly before you give up on the DVD. I've struggled a bit with other yoga DVD's in the same way, but found that it was usually my ineptitude with the remote/DVD player that was the problem, not the yoga. Sometimes DVD players are the culprit!",1226707200,2,1517,4.789272030651341
3537027,5,B001DQNPDE,"Taking Sadie's classes in New York is one of my key tools in navigating a very high pressure life.  What I have always appreciated about her teachings is her cool blend of physiological athleticism and grace in presentation.  This DVD is the next best thing to being there.  Sadie's elegant combinations of poses and movements are in a format that is smooth and easy to follow.  I feel like I get a great workout and as at the last OM in her classes, you feel a sense of accomplishment and a strong belief in your own ability to move through, beyond and conquer anything.",1226448000,4,571,4.461538461538462
8294571,3,B001DQNPDE,"Too much wall work to get into handstand.  I wanted Sadie's signature core vinyasa style, not the stop and go, getting into a handstand.  I KNOW inversions require good ccore strength, but as a teacher, I need stuff that's practical to bring to an all-levels class.  Why does everyone think you have to do a handstand to call it a complete class?  Not all people care about doing handstands.  I'm still a Sadie fan,",1491350400,,415,4.554054054054054

8294574,3,B001DQNPDE,"I wouldn't suggest this video if you are interested in practicing yoga. There is almost no attempt to focus mind to breath (or really relaxing the mind at all). There is no way you could do these poses at this speed if you are moving with your breath unless you are hyperventilating. It is challenging, but it is more of a workout video using yoga poses instead of a yoga (excercising the body and mind and breath) video. If you would like to de-stress by practicing yoga, avoid this video.",1447459200,,490,4.455555555555556

8294577,2,B001DQNPDE,"There are not enough cues to learn anything so you'd better be experienced and flexible with many poses before doing this video.  Plus, you'd better be used to moving through poses quickly.  Sadie assumes much with this video, namely the intermediate-plus level of her students and familiarity with her jargon.  You must have enough wall space where you work out in order to do wall poses.  In my living room filled with furniture and wall hangings I don't and feel cheated because I couldn't even attempt many poses. For the price the video quality is fair even with children playing in the background in one section.  I expect much more for $20.  I am so glad I only rented it.",1410134400,2,679,4.616666666666666
