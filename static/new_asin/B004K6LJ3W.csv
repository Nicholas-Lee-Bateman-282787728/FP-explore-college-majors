4395827,5,B004K6LJ3W,"If you like the Sy-Fy version, you will love the BBC. It's the original and far superior show. The production is better than most American shows past or present. Well worth the price. They just finished the series with season 5, so you may want to try to get a box set with all 5 or just get this then the 5th (as the 5th just finished in mid March 2013).",1365033600,7,355,4.014084507042254
4395828,4,B004K6LJ3W,"Season 1 - Very inventive series, which morphs somewhat along the way during it's first 6 episode season.
A vampire. a werewolf and a ghost all share a small house in England. They desperately want to simply fit
in, be accepted and not hurt anyone. It's got a lot of dry wit and some real emotions as well, with strong
performances throughout. Someone remarked it's like `Seinfeld' with undead characters, and that is part
of the appeal early on, seeing these characters more in human, often humorous ways than in scary supernatural
ones. But over the course of the season, the supernatural and darker tones become more and more prominent.
This leads to some confusion in tone at times, along with some messiness as to just what the rules of the game
are for these creatures. There's also a few hard to take leaps of faith (e.g. a human character who hardly seems
fazed when he leans the true identity of our three leads.). When it first turned from `dramedy' to drama, and
the supernatural elements began to grow stronger I was very disappointed, as it seemed like the show was losing
what made it unique, but then it regained it's balance by amping up the emotions along with the other-worldly,
and making the characters' pain at being trapped between worlds, and their love for each other moving and real,
while avoiding (mostly) clichs or the familiar. I'll be very curious to see where it goes from here.

Season 2 - While still uneven at times, with it's goofy moments of humor not always meshing smoothly with it's darker
and more emotional sides, the series has grown a bit in it's 2nd season. While still not (for me) up with the all time great
series like The Wire or Mad Men or Breaking Bad, at it's best, it's an amazingly potent mix of heartrending drama, dark,
off-beat humor and some effective horror as well. But this is horror with all the rules reversed, with the `monsters' being
the human race, and the heroes our vampire werewolf and ghost who simply want to live like other people. At times, in
an odd way it reminded me of ""Dexter"", the outsider with scary possibilities, who wants to fit in. But whereas Dexter
is all about emotions repressed, here the emotions are on the sleeve (occasionally a bit too much, and there are a few
soapy moments).

Much like the first season this starts strong, seems to lose its way a bit in the middle, with some forced humor, and
repetitive moments but finishes with such a kick that its easy to forgive any lapses. The acting is on a very high level,
the writing is witty and human, and the direction and camerawork can be very effective at creating mood and scares
on a TV budget. Not perfect perhaps, but it's a rare TV show that can make me think, laugh, cry, and send a shiver
down my spine all in one episode. Some great use of rock tunes to set the mood tops it off.

Season 3 - I seem to be in the minority, but for me season 3 represented a bit of frustrating fall off from the preceding years,
although it still has it's share of strong moments, and the last 2 episodes are very powerful. But some of the earlier weaknesses
have gotten more prevalent; twists that seem a bit arbitrary, rules of its world that seem to shift to fit story convenience, story
lines that get dropped, character choices and complex morality that aren't really explored or are over-simplified, episodes that
seem a bit disconnected from the others.

And some of the strengths are less played too; fewer ironic or emotional uses of rock music, fewer visually inventive scenes,
and most importantly, less genuine emotion, and more slightly histrionic soapy-ness. (Suddenly the characters seem to
cry in every episode, which starts to make those powerful moments lose their impact). And the questions of 'what are good
and evil in a complex world' seem to be less deeply explored than before.  (There's tremendous room to explore 'what is guilt'
'what is mercy' and 'what is evil' in this particular season, and in the end the answers given seem a bit too neat.)

There are also episodes in the middle that feel a bit dull, as if treading water. Perhaps this season would have been stronger
as 5 or 6 episodes.

Certainly good television, and worth watching, but for the first time I found myself less emotionally moved, and more apt to
find my mind wandering. The climax (which in some ways feels like a natural ending to the series) certainly makes up for a
lot of that, but not all of it.",1356998400,3,4434,4.576826196473552

4395835,5,B004K6LJ3W,"In my opinion, this UK series is one of the best, if not the very best, ever made.  After getting the introduction in S1E1, it is very hard to quit watching.  The cast was great and the writers did a super great job keeping the story interesting and unpredictable.",1450828800,2,264,4.36734693877551
4395836,5,B004K6LJ3W,"I've been fascinated with this series since I saw it on BBC America starting in 2009. At the time, I DVR'd it, and I've watched it probably once a year since. When I saw this bundle at an attractive price ($40), I jumped at it, and I'm glad I did. If you like supernatural dramas, you'll watch this set again and again.

For those who don't know the story: A vampire, a ghost, and a werewolf share a house in Bristol. They are conflicted about their conditions, and want to live as much as possible like humans. As you might expect, there are lots of forces acting against this. The struggle provides both drama and occasional moments of comic relief.  The writing sparkles, and the characters play off of each other very well.

Of the four main actors, three left at the end of season 3, and the fourth at the end of season 4. New characters were created, in a way that fitted the story. Wisely, the showrunners made the new vampire, ghost, and werewolf quite different personalities from the earlier ones, so this wasn't like the two Darrins on /Bewitched/ or the two Beckys on /Roseanne/. The new actors didn't try to imitate the old ones, but brought their own gifts for drama and comedy to the mix.

Pros: Crisp and clear picture. Very good sound, AND subtitles. Terrific stories. Very good acting and very attractive actors, let it be said. Sets and camerawork that look like something from a show with a much bigger budget. Full-length episodes, almost an hour each. (When I saw the BBC America broadcasts, I didn't know they had chopped out about ten minutes from each episode so they could put in lots of commercials.) Tons of extras -- by my count, 38 deleted scenes and 39 other features including cast and crew interviews, various behind-the-scenes features, and an alternate ending for the last episode.

Some other points, for those who may be wondering:

*  This isn't a box set: they just stacked the five season sets and shrink-wrapped the stack. On the plus side, the two or three discs per season are securely held in plastic cases, so they don't get scratched.

* Don't let young kids watch this until you've watched it first. As you might expect when vampires and werewolves are involved, there's a significant amount of violence, and some sex, and use of the F and S words where an adult would naturally use them. None of it was pandering, but you do see blood sprays and you do see naked bodies connecting (though no genitals).

Overall: A very strong recommendation.",1450569600,,2490,4.615384615384615

4395856,5,B004K6LJ3W,"I've seen reviews saying these blu-rays are not Region Free/won't play on Region 1 players. All I can think of is that they were purchased through the Marketplace, because this box set does play on Region 1 (US) players (and it looks great).

As for the show itself, it's one of the best supernatural dramas ever made, if not the best. The characters -- ghosts, vampires, and werewolves -- struggle through the day-to-day world, make mistakes, and face consequences as they try to find some normalcy and maybe even happiness within the walls of their haunted home. It's a smart and subversive take on the genre, and while it's often funny enough to classify it as comedy, don't expect a lighthearted, Munsters-esque romp. It's a dark show that faces the tragedies of the characters' conditions -- it's not about being special. There are almost no upsides to being supernatural, other than it led to them finding each other.

There are two different main vamp/ghost/wolf families in the complete series, with Series 4 transitioning to a complete cast change for Series 5. Though, IMO, the show was never quite as edgy again after the climactic Series 3, the cast of characters in the last 2 series include some of the most memorable, with notable appearances by Mark Gatiss, Mark Williams, Julian Barratt, and Amanda Abbington (to name a few). Even if you're attached to the original quartet or you can't imagine a time before the trinity, the entire run is worth having. Lots of great extras, too!",1396396800,5,1497,4.84375
4395857,5,B004K6LJ3W,"I gave this set 5 stars, even though I haven't watched the discs yet.  I have seen the series on Amazon Instant Video, and I like it a lot. When I ordered the Blu Rays, I was really only interested in Series 1-3, since Aidan Turner got dusted at the end of Series 3 to go to New Zealand and do The Hobbit.  I ordered this set--Series 1-4--because it was Blu Ray, because it doesn't hurt to have the 4th series, and because it was cheaper than buying the 3 series individually or the 5 series set that is offered first.  Because of warnings posted in other reviews about Regions, I looked carefully to make certain that it would be watchable in the US.  It arrived today, and it does, as advertised, play on my Blu Ray player.  But I also got a big surprise.  The order form says Series 1-4, the price says Series 1-4, but the box says ""The Complete Collection.""  And it is, indeed, all 5 series, giving me outstanding value for my money.  I will at some point watch Series 4 and 5, and I will update this review to include them.  I can't compare it to the US series; because I haven't watched it, either.

As far as an actual review of the series itself, I would have to rate it somewhat lower, but only for personal reasons.  It is well acted, well scripted, and well filmed.  I just don't care for the fact that things keep getting more and more bleak as the years go on.  I like my entertainment with a large dose of humor and hope, and it's kind of hard to find those in this series.  It seems like they stumble from one crisis to the next, always worse than the last.  Despite the fact that I knew that Mitchell had to leave the series, seeing George stake him--because he loved him--put the cap on it for me.  I couldn't watch any longer.

Oh how I wish they had stayed with that formula!!! They DID NOT.  It turned very dark.  The filthy profanity got worse and worse as the show progressed and in Season 2 they were so insulting to those of faith.  Here they get you loving these main characters and who do they then make the bad guy fighting to hurt and destroy them?  Religious people.  People truly filled with the love of Christ wouldn't have been cruel like they made their villains.  The evil priest stereotype is pretty offensive as well.  They had the main character that we love (Mitchell) call God a bas*&%* and said he was cruel and spiteful.  No words for that unbelievable dialogue!  I'm sorry, story or no story, there are some places YOU DON'T GO and this show had no such boudaries!!  I should have turned it off right then in Season 2 but something in me just wanted the show to redeem itself and turn back to the lighter version that I first liked (it didn't).  Honestly the stories were interesting,  great casting, characters and acting but it just got WAY too dark, the profanity was thick and constant, a lot of nudity and simulated sex acts and honestly, it just leaves you feeling disturbed, dirty and gross. Just a really sinful production.  I'm going back to comedies after this and screening for something cleaner.  You are supposed to walk away from entertainment feeling better, not worse.  If any of these things I mentioned concern you, then this show isn't for you. I should have turned it off way sooner than I did.  They just got me cheering for Aiden Turners character and I kept watching wanting things to work out for him. Spoiler, it doesn't, which is depressing.
