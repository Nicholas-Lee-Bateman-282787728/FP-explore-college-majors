(6.2) Saint Joan (USA/UK-1957) - Jean Seburg/Richard Widmark/Richard Todd/John Gielgud/Finlay Currie (uncredited: David Hemmings)",1268352000,3,591,5.450549450549451
570019,5,6303118127,"Saint Joan premiered in London on May 26, 1924.  Written by Irish playwright, George Bernard Shaw, Saint Joan was adapted to film by Graham Greene.  Otto Preminger directed and produced this film in 1957.  Saint Joan was actress Jean Seberg's first movie; she was 17 years old then probably the same age as Jeanne D'arc herself when her unpaid career began in the French military.
Joan of Arc died in Rouen, France in Normandy on May 30, 1431.  She was burned at the stake.
This movie is one of my all time favorite Christian flicks.  I'm no movie critic; I just love good stories and look more for content/value than anything else.  This movie is incredible, makes me want to reread Dickens's Tale of Two Cities. I prefer this version of Joan of Arc over any others out there.  Bernard Shaw's play by itself is a classic.  It's a story that left me pondering over the involvement of various churches and governments in war, particularly, in this tale, the Catholic church and English government.  The impoverished, over-taxed French peasant class rallied round Joan at the siege of Orleans, her ill-clad compatriots scrambling over walls and ditches to fight the English.  Makes me wonder why the church or state sometimes creates the conditions, e.g. oppression and poverty, which lead to war in the first place.  It's definitely something to think about this Easter season, not to mention in an election year.",1080518400,16,1412,4.841666666666667
570020,3,6303118127,"Director Otto Preminger's stab at the George Bernard Shaw play was pilloried for the miscasting of Jean Seberg in the title role, but she's hardly the sole reason why this well-intentioned film version doesn't work. Richard Widmark gives one of his silliest screen performances as the Dauphin, and many of the smaller roles are quite hammily portrayed as well.
Still, this VHS version does include a very well-made behind-the-scenes featurette (for once, you don't have to have a DVD player to enjoy this sort of extra). SAINT JOAN is still worth seeing, if only to appreciate how much more confident an actress Seberg would become in BONJOUR TRISTESSE (also directed by Preminger) and, of course, in Godard's BREATHLESS.

570282,3,6303118127,"The performances aren't universally good, but this is the only cinematic treatment of one of Shaw's most engaging plays and so is worth the time spent.  The adaption  is often perceptive and witty, with some genuine poignancy that cuts through Seberg's rather dull reading of France's most heroic and famous saint and martyr and Widmark's seriously campy Dauphin.  The staging is very static and those looking for battle spectacle or any portrayal of Joan's  very real military exploits will be  disappointed.  It is Shaw's apt observations on the human condition, put into the mouths of characters like Joan, Charles, and Warwick, that shine most brilliantly in Saint Joan.

One note on the DVD edition that might surprise others -- this disc leaves out the contemporary ""Making Of"" feature that was included as a bonus on the VHS version released long ago.  It's a shame this was not included on the DVD -- there are no bonus features, in fact, not even subtitles.

And afterward Preminger was quoted as saying the film was a failure due to the inexperience of newcomer J San S e b e r g. A flawed production, no doubt, mostly due to the unusual casting if Richard Widmark as the future king of France in the early 15th century, but after seeing this film for the first time, I have to say the film's beautiful moments were due to the enigmatic Jean S e b e r g 's portrayal of Joan of Arc.

Preminger tends to emphasize the political dimension of Joan's life rather than the religious, but he respectfully attends to both. Preminger takes great liberty making King Charles VII out to be a clown. The film passes as a good comedy due to Charles' histrionics. There are several very funny scenes throughout the movie, but it becomes very grave from Joan's trial onward. If not for Jean's warm disposition, this film would rate no better than a 3 star. Jean Seberg is very lovable. She passes as a saint: someone who might share some qualities of Saint Joan.",1384387200,3,718,4.991666666666666

570409,4,6303118127,"There have been many adaptations of the story of Joan Of Arc in film thru out the years from the sublime (Carl Dreyer's PASSIONE DE JEANNE D'ARC) to the ridiculous (Luc Besson's THE MESSENGER). Otto Preminger's film of the George Bernard Shaw play doesn't attempt to expand or rejuvenate or take a revisionist view of the historic Joan as we know her. Shaw's play suggests that Joan's trial was more political than religious (not exactly an earth shattering theory) and Preminger's narrative follows, like the play, a straight forward line with very few concessions to cinema. Poor Jean Seberg whose performance as Joan as been much maligned and truth to tell, one can see her struggling terribly with the part which is beyond her abilities but she brings a genuine (meaning unactressy) simplicity to the part that is refreshing enough that you find yourself rooting for her. A horribly miscast Richard Widmark gives what may be his one bad performance but the other actors are quite good: John Gielgud, Richard Todd, Anton Walbrook, Harry Andrews and Felix Aylmer. There's a moving underscore courtesy of Mischa Spoliansky.

The Warners Archive MOD is a good looking wide screen (1.85) transfer",1316390400,6,1195,5.0353535353535355
570410,2,6303118127,"There have been many films about Joan of Arc starting as early as 1899 by pioneer film inventor George Melies and including the silent film ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" (1928) by the great Danish film director Carl Theodor Dreyer, and the Ingrid Bergman 1948 film ""Joan of Arc"". ""Saint Joan"" (1957) followed, and then ""The Trail of Joan of Arc"" (1962), Luc Besson's ""The Messenger"" (1999), and a 1999 TV movie.

This film was based on George Bernard Shaw's 1924 play of the same name, inspired by the Catholic Church's canonization of Joan as a Saint. Jeanne d'Arc (1412-31) was a peasant girl who claimed divine guidance and led the French army to several victories in the 100 Years War, then was burned at the stake as a witch.

Jean Seberg (1938-79) plays Joan in this film. Joan has been played by action star Milla Jovovich (1999), Helen Hunt lookalike Leelee Sobieski (1999), and Ingrid Bergman (1948). Bergman was 33 years old when she played the 17 year old maid. Jovovich was 24 and Leelee Sobieski was only 17. Seberg was 19.

This was Seberg's film debut. She followed it with ""Bonjour Tristesse"" (1958) and ""Breathless"" (1960) and went on to make almost 40 films, the most famous of which was ""Paint Your Wagon"" (1969).

Rugged Richard Widmark (1914-2008) was an excellent actor, nominated for an Oscar and winner of a Golden Globe for his debut film (""Kiss of Death"", 1947) and also nominated for an Emmy for ""Vanished"" (1971). Widmark appeared in more than 50 films, initially as a villain but increasing as a hero. He was a staple in Westerns - ""The Last Wagon"" (1956), ""Warlock"" (1959), ""Two Rode Together"" (1961), ""Cheyenne Autumn"" (1964), ""Death of a Gunfighter"" (1969), and ""Once Upon a Texas Train"" (1988). In this film he takes on a completely different persona as The Dauphin, and does quite well.

John Gielgud (1904-2000) is one of the finest British actors and one of the few actors to win an Oscar (""Arthur"", 1918), Emmy (""Ages of Man"", 1966), Grammy (""Ages of Man"", 1979), and Tony (""Importance of Being Earnest"", 1948). Gielgud plays the Earl of Warwick.

Handsome Richard Todd (1919-2009) was nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe for ""The Hasty Heart"" (1949) but he's probably better known for his roles as Robin Hood (1952) and Rob Roy (1953). He plays the Bastard of Orleans.

The ever popular Harry Andrews (1911-89) appeared in more than 100 films often playing a British role. He's best remembered for his role opposite Sean Connery in ""The Hill"" (1965) that earned him a BAFTA Best Actor nomination, but he also gave us great performances as Bramante in ""The Agony and the Ecstasy"" (1965), the 13th Earl in ""The Ruling Class"" (1972), and Mackintosh in ""The MacKintosh Man"" (1973). Andrews plays a priest.

The film was directed by Otto Preminger (1905-86). In a 5 decade career he made 41 films, was nominated for an Oscar 3 times (""Laura"", ""Anatomy of a Murder"", ""The Cardinal"") and a Palme d'Or 3 times (""Carmen Jones"", ""Tell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon"", ""Advise and Consent"").

Graham Greene (1904-91) was an English author who specialized in Catholic themes in films like ""Brighton Rock"" and ""The Power and the Glory"". His screenplays include ""The Third Man"" (1949), ""Our Man in Havana"" (1959), and ""The Comedians"" (1967). The film is based on his work.

The top grossing films in 1957 were ""Bridge on the River Kwai"", ""Peyton Place"", ""Sayonara"", ""Old Yeller"", and ""Raintree County"". The big Oscar winners were ""Kwai"" (Picture, Director, Actor) and ""Sayonara"" (Actor, Supporting Actress). Other notable films released that year include ""Three Faces of Eve"", ""Pal Joey"", ""Funny Face"", and ""Witness for the Prosecution"".

The NY Times called it a ""largely placid and undramatic theatrical exercise"". This is due in large part to trimming the 3+ hour Shaw play down to half its length. But it's also caused by the fact that plays do not necessarily translate that well to the big screen, and this is particularly true when we expect battle scenes. Moreover, the film is shot more like as TV movie than a film, with lots of heads shots and 2 shots and focus on talking heads.

FWIW - the burning scene at the end of the film went awry and Seberg actually got burned. So what you see here is not acting. Needless to say this is her best scene.

There really isn't much to see here unless you're a big fan of Shaw's plays, or unless the idea of seeing Richard Widmark as a faltering half wit intrigues you.",1312329600,,4449,4.732558139534884
570411,5,6303118127,"Otto Preminger's ""Saint Joan"" was based upon George Bernard Shaw's play and adapted by Graham Greene and is indeed flawed but must be remembered for the highlights it does hold.  His discovery after a much publicized search for a leading lady and the finding of Jean Seberg who is a stellar Joan.  Others in the cast, John Gielgud, Richard Todd, Anton Walbrook, Harry Andrews and Richard Widmark (the critical lambasting he received is less that it doesn't work as he is integral to Otto's movie version) are fine.  The times the movie seems inept (except for the costumes which look uncomfortable), the movie makes up for in genuinely rich vision.  Otto keeps his love for Shaw's play in earnest.  The fact that poor Jean Seberg was nearly seriously burnt when the initial igniting of the fires during her scene of being burned at the stake is again evidence of the hard work and impressive debut she gave. The music by Mischa Spoliansky is complementary and Saul Bass's titles are again a work of genius.  But Otto the showman, (producer and director) (as a director Otto was always efficient, usually bringing in his pictures nearly under budget) provides another classic to a career of consistently fine films.  It is my favorite depiction of St. Joan's story. (Mark Twain's ""Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc"" is another although unfilmed).  I wish Otto were alive and working still.

570412,4,6303118127,"When Jean Seberg starred in Saint Joan, her first movie, the critics gave her thoroughly negative reviews.  Being that this was her first movie and that Otto Preminger was a very demanding and harsh director to work with, I would have thought that the critics and the public would have been more sympathetic.  I decided to view this movie with curiosity and some trepidation.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I believe Ms. Seberg did a very good job, considering she had no experience in movies.  The fault I found with this picture was the script.  I found it to be rather silly and immature, considering the subject matter.

570414,4,6303118127,"Otto Preminger's stagy retelling of the Joan of Arc history/legend was pilloried on its release, and Jean Seberg's performance roasted (no pun intended). Seen today, the film is a stylized, often uneven, but worthwhile experience. Seberg is rough around the edges, but contrary to popular myth, isn't the shameful embarrassment critics made her out to be. Much worse is Richard Widmark's Dauphin, a cringe-worthy contribution to an otherwise stately, literate, and entertaining adaptation of the George Bernard Shaw play. The movie feels much like a television production from the same era: the crispness of the black and white images and the curiously flat nature of the settings and costumes mark it as something less than the typical fifties wide-screen epic, and something more than the typical ""Playhouse 90"" offerings of the period. Fans of Seberg will want to see the film: this edition is from the ""Warner Archive"" DVD releases, and as such is given the bare-bones treatment: no commentaries, no ""making of"" features, and a print that appears cropped from the original (Cinemascope?) version seen in theaters. I've had some playable issues with other Warner Archive editions: this DVD played well on three players, without skipping or stopping. No masterpiece, but time has been kind to the film, and to Seberg's contribution. Interesting to compare this version to the silent, Dreyer version, and the oddball Technicolor Victor Fleming film (1948), with a too-old Ingrid Bergman. Joan's story is filled with contradictions, betrayals, and turnabouts, and this film version recreates most of them in a compelling, stylized, and sometimes clumsy way. Should you buy the DVD? Well, not if you've been holding out for a special edition with commentaries and documentaries, but the print is clean, and this may be the only way to see Preminger's film for a while.",1276905600,17,1867,5.226666666666667

7838831,5,6303118127,"Of all of the cinamatic versions, even the early version of Joan, by Cart T. Dreyer, which, stands alone, due to its production during the silent era, does not display the feeling that Preminger attempted with such a young inexpericed actor he chose in Jean Seberg.
 Like Dreyer's over edited film, Preminger struggled to keep his film intact, yet the the version we have today is diminished by the studio complex over editing, due to unusual prejudice by critics at screenings.
 Still, if you watch Seberg closely, guided by Preminger, look at her eyes and brow, she truly tried to think and feel Joan.
  Preminger chose her out of hundreds, and he saw something past her angelic face.
  This film is rarely seen unfortunately, but if you're fascinated by the historical versions of Joan, and enjoy early cinema, keeping in mind the time when it was made, the film has acting moments that are amazing to see and well worth your time. Richard Widmark took quite a risk when he agreed to trust Preminger with his career change.
  Like, Grace Kelly, in Country Girl, for which she won an Oscar, it shares the fact that few people are aware of the film and the high quality of very young actresses completely immersing themselves in their role.  Unfortunately, unlike Kelly, Seberg was mercilessly, negatively criticized at the films initial release.
 I'm very grateful that Amazon has made it accessible.
 This version is digitally enhanced and for a neglected film, is very clear and free of most the poor older VHS versions.",1463097600,3,1524,4.823076923076923
7838832,3,6303118127,"Otto Preminger used a marketing ploy to ensure the success of ""Saint Joan"", which was to conduct a massive talent search for an unknown young actress to play the lead role.  Jean Seberg secured the part, then endured blistering tirades from Preminger as the movie was filmed.  She later said that she was scared out of her wits, like a rabbit in the cross-hairs.  When the movie failed to win good reviews, Seberg took the fall.

But, in truth, Seberg's performance isn't that bad, and is in fact commensurate with the spirit of Shaw's play, which emphasized Joan of Arc's youth and naivete'.  Seberg was a rather diminuitive girl, and if she had been 4 inches taller, and gifted with stronger vocal cords, she might have been a more convincing Joan.

Having said that, the only really convincing Joan of Arc was in Dreyer's classic ""La Passion de Jeanne d' Arc"",  and that was a Joan who didn't have to speak a word of dialogue.  Otto Preminger hewed fairly close to Shaw,  trying to make a sort of Brechtian play of ideas with characters who are somewhat symbolic.  Maybe Preminger was inspired by the success of Bergman's ""Seventh Seal"", which came about a year earlier.

But ""Saint Joan"" seems to be marred by bad performances, bad costumes, and (except for Seberg) bad hair cuts.  There are some impressive names here (John Gielgud, Richard Widmark),  but nobody really shines.  In fact, Widmark  is pretty bad playing a limp-wristed ""dauphin"".

The movie does have some good features, though.  Even though it is talky, the underlying themes about the church, heretics, and human nature are well observed.  It is also interesting in that it is an early (1958) feminist movie, and it launched Jean Seberg into a series of roles, of varying degrees of success, which seemed marked by a strong sense of feminism, right up to 1964's ""Lilith"".  For that alone, I still believe that Seberg is an actress worthy of rediscovery and critical rehabilitation.
