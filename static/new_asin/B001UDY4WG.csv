8654642,5,B001UDY4WG,"Infant communication through sign language is an amazing tool that encourages language skills in children too young to communicate through words. This DVD is a fun accessible way for your child to learn the signs. The songs presented will help you to remember and use the Signs with your children during every day tasks. As a teacher of many ages I have seen how the increased communication helps to alleviate the frustration that often causes infants and toddlers to have tantrums. Because of the increase in understanding communication the children often start using words at an earlier time as well. Signing Up's songs are so fun and easy for your kids to grab on to!

 I can't tell you how amazed I was when my 16 month old nephew brought me a box of crackers and showed me the sign for FOOD. I preceded to ask him ""what do you say"", he then showed me the sign for PLEASE. After giving him the crackers I asked him ""what do you say"" and he showed me the sign for THANK YOU.  Pretty Cool!

All of the signs used are practical and baby-friendly, and of course, being delivered to your child in song-form which is both fun and enriching!  This is my new go-to gift for all my friends who are soon-to-be-moms!!",1300924800,,274,4.48
8654644,5,B001UDY4WG,"My 13-month old son has the privilege of taking classes with Melissa, but for those who can't, this DVD is fantastic.  The songs are great--not annoying at all--and the participants signing along really engage the viewer. My son's face lights up when he hears the music begin, and then he watches the signing intently.  He can do some simple signs and I know that he'll pick up more as we continue to watch the DVD. There are loads of ""educational"" DVDs on the market, but this one is truly special.",1256256000,,499,4.533333333333333
8654645,5,B001UDY4WG,"This CD has taught my 20 month old to love to communicate through signs. He has even gotten his big sister who is 4 to love to sign along and sign with him. He asks for more, tells us he is hungry, wants a bottle and more! I think the song are terrific and we sing them all together as a family. This is a great gift for any young child and a terrific way to bring a new big brother or sister together with their younger sibling! LOVE it!",1239667200,,438,3.8777777777777778

The Boo Boo Song,""  but she does a great job imitating what she sees.  This is an awesome gift for any new parent, or any family looking for some educational bonding time!",1239494400,,295,4.290909090909091
