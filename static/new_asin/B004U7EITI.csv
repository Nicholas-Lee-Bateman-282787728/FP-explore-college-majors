8441265,2,B004U7EITI,"Terrance Stamp is miscast. The storyline does not exactly follow the book. If I hadn't read the book, I don't think I would have grasped what was going on.",1477180800,,155,4.379310344827586
8441266,3,B004U7EITI,"An interesting 1950's cold war drama of the British academics' seduction by the Soviet promise of a better economic future for the world, if their government shifted more towards communism.  No matter what one's educational background might be, everyone, at one time or another, gets duped into believing some con during their lives, either about love, money or politics, by people of devious intents.  It is all a function of our hopes for economic justice among ordinary citizens.",1461801600,,482,5.166666666666667
8441267,4,B004U7EITI,For an older espionage movie this is a good one.  Terrance Stamp is great but you need to see all three in this series - 1. Cold War Killers 2. The Alamut Ambush 3. Deadly Recurits.  Why they never packaged them as a series is crazy but they are a great find for those who like cold war espionage.,1359849600,,297,4.016949152542373
8441268,3,B004U7EITI,"I have tried desperately to obtain DVD's/Videos of 'Chessgame' starring Terrence Stamp, unsuccessfully until purchasing this DVD which was one programme from the series, for some reason the series does not appear to be available.
For those that do not know, the series was a sort of 70's version of Spooks.
The item arrived promptly, from the USA, well packed. Unfortunately the quality is not what we have become used to, with the sound slightly out of sync' and the video quality below par, but given the above I am satified it was value for money and was good to watch again.",1344297600,,578,4.676470588235294
8441269,2,B004U7EITI,"This is a thoroughly old-fashioned film derived from the Anthony Price novel of the same title, which was, goodness knows, complicated enough to sort out. The film does not entirely succeed in clarifying the plot, even with a good cast working hard at it. It would be an enjoyable experience nonetheless, were it not that the Osiris Entertainment copy is quite appalling. The visuals are garish, badly reproduced, the color sometimes going a liverish dark brown or pink and completely blotting out expressions on faces. As for the soundtrack, it is practically inaudible so that an already complex plot is made virtually incomprehensible by the low level audio. Swathes of low-key conversation are impossible to decipher. Avoid buying this product at all costs. The production is a disgrace.",1302912000,,791,5.1875
