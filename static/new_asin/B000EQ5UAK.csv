Bob Clark's Death Dream or Dead Of Night is a real chiller. Extremely creepy film. John Marley and the rest of the cast give fantastic performances . Great direction, great effects, beautiful music, this film's an absolute classic. It's also Tom Savini's first effects film. For fans of the classic horror films like Black Christmas this is definitely a must own dvd.

UNCLE SAM :
Bill Lustig's last movie is awesome. Not a scary movie, but definitely a fun movie. Great appearances from classic actors like Robert Forester , and Bo Hopkins . The list goes on. Great effects. This movie's almost like  a spoof of other horror films. It's really an awesome film and it's definitely worth checking out.

I also recommend Maniac. 1980, Maniac Cop. 1989, and Vigilante. 1983
