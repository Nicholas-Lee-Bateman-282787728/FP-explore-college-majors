627123,4,630334125X,"It took me two or three years to finally run across this video. It was said to be in good condition but, I feel it was in excellent condition. Which made me feel great because I had felt the price was far too high for a VHS tape in good condition no matter how rare. Vendor was great: packaged the product well to protect it and delivered in a prompt time frame. Neat movie with a familiar face and a couple I hadn't seen before. The premise is great but, there aren't too many special effects and the aliens were a little disappointing in their humanness. The sets are pretty good and so is the acting but, the story itself is what matters here. Yes, there are underground facilities where the US military industrial complex has black programs to study aliens, thier technology and to use both to our advantage. Of course there's much more to it so, check out this cool fictionalized UFO crash retrieval flick.",1297900800,,911,4.461077844311378
627124,5,630334125X,It is a great movie. It should be made available for sale in DVD format.,1270080000,2,72,3.8666666666666667
627125,5,630334125X,"I did some research and found out this movie is said to be really close to the truth of an actual situation with the gov and aliens. I would say it's really a super movie. It does not have all the hype and bull and sensationalism and touches on eeriness, or the scary part quite well. Watch out for aliens and hurting them it can kill you just to think about it in some cases if their survival is in jeopardy. I don't know how they got captured and held while they were so powerful of beings but....since this is based on a true story I highly recommend it. If not please let me know on my site [...]  I'm very picky and don't go in for science fiction that drives us crazy with sensationalism and things that we just don't need to wonder about, this movie shows that it's required to live and let live and how these aliens are far more advanced and all communicate telepathically. It doesn't appear they are interested in learning the language in many cases.  I didn't see this stuff years ago because I didn't believe it. I thought they made it up and I'm really sorry now that no one bothered to tell us.",1243468800,,1107,4.241706161137441
627126,3,630334125X,"A young girl is lured to the Hollywood Hills by eerie whale like sounds that resonate inside her head.
These ""signals""  are coming from six stories below the earth, underneath the Hollywood Hills, inside a hidden air force base originally  designed for  nuclear fusion experiments. Now it  holds  3 childlike aliens who have crashed landed to earth. There they lay inside cylindrical tombs while scientist conduct experiments that are unsuccessful  in proving how they think or even if they are alive. That is until the young girl and her boyfriend break in. Compelled by her uncanny ability to pick up the  telepathic signals from these aliens.  Aided by an ole miner who originally worked on the construction of the underground fortress and still lives as a hobo near one of the unknown ventilation shafts that lead inside.
Now inside, the couple comes face to face with alien beings. She hears their thoughts, she knows what they want, the  officers of the military fortress want these answers. But they are not prepared for what they find out.  They decide to seal the fate of  the aliens and  the intrusive couple, then abandon their post before its too late.

As on3/09 this film not available on DVD. When buying the VHS make sure you don't get the EP mode cheap vers. You want the High End SP mode Release -sideshowvideo",1238112000,,1328,4.771929824561403
627127,5,630334125X,"I always think of this movie in terms of being a gentle sci fi movie.  When I first saw it (in 1983) I remember that the acting seemed very natural and though it was obvious that the aliens were portrayed by children, well, that was okay, too.  The music is the best, and not just the stuff by Tangerine Dream; there was a great song being played in the bar where Bobby and Iris first meet (""No More Lonely Days"" was the title), and the snippets that Robert Carradine played were also fun to listen to.  I'll always own a copy.",1182470400,,527,4.198019801980198
627128,4,630334125X,"The two lead characters, assisted by Keenan Wynn, manage to get a group of aliens out of the Los Angeles area to a remote desert location.

Along the way, the aliens see the earthly sights before finally leaving Earth.

Overall the music is excellent, the writing is fairly decent, and the acting, especially by Keenan, is terrific.

Not your typical alien movie but a good movie neverless.",1156118400,6,390,4.791044776119403
627129,3,630334125X,"Coincidentally I rented ""Wavelength"" and I purchased ""Six-String Samurai"" during the same week. Both movies featured lots of scenery from Death Valley and surrounding areas. While ""Wavelength"" emphasized Panamint Valley, ""Six-String Samurai"" contained many scenes that were filmed in Searles Valley. Both valleys are near Death Valley. Another interesting coincidence is that both movies feature somewhat unusual soundtracks. The soundtrack for ""Wavelength"" was created by Tangerine Dream and ""Six-String Samurai"" featured lots of surf guitar songs. I'll admit that I wasn't crazy about either soundtrack, but atleast they weren't normal, boring, typical soundtracks either. Both movies were a little quirky and both seemed to have low budgets, or atleast not the greatest production quality. On the otherhand, both movies were interesting to watch and somewhat enjoyable, but I'm not sure if I would have found them so interesting if I wasn't preoccupied with identifying the locations where various scenes were shot. So, if you enjoy interesting desert scenery, I'd recommend both movies. The last third of ""Wavelength"" featured lots of scenes shot in Panamint Valley and the other movie had nice shots of the Trona Pinnacles. From a plot and character perspective, I'd say that ""Wavelength"" was the better of the two movies although the first two-thirds of the movie was a little tedious (they should have gotten to the desert a little sooner in the movie).",1152230400,3,1460,5.436123348017621
627130,4,630334125X,"Of the few reviews when this movie came out, most concluded Wavelength was better than the cute E.T.  I completely agree, and wonder why this movie hasn't been released on DVD.  The ending, most often written about reminds us of ""Starman"", but that's missing the point of this movie that's really about us!",1114646400,7,306,4.754716981132075
7843902,5,630334125X,"I first owned this classic sci-fi film on Laser disc. Quality was OK (good at the time) but still did not look great as one might expect a new film to look from a good print...always looked like a cheap transfer. That said, I always expected this cool little underrated gem to make a better appearance in DVD format, and yet it never happened. Only bootlegs. Now that Blu Ray has become popular, and everything ever made including low budget sci-fi is now being produced in Blu Ray format, I had hoped to see it finally given the treatment it deserves...but again..I am still waiting and hearing nothing about any such release. Anybody else like to see this on Blu Ray?",1494374400,,669,4.537190082644628

Anyway...I highly recommend this film to any sci-fi movie fans, or even just fans of Tangerine Dream, as the soundtrack is awesome in itself.",1322179200,2,359,4.028169014084507
7843911,4,630334125X,In the vein of ET and Starman and somewhat of an inbetween this movie has 80s type script with the expected traditional 80s feel good ending. Worth a watch though PG-13 in the middle with some of the military scenes.,1320969600,,216,4.425
