2655744,5,B000IHYBT6,A must watch. I love this show. It is cheesy but very entertaining. Who doesn't love Heath Ledger?,1520380800,,98,4.5
2655745,5,B000IHYBT6,"I have watched this movie many times over the years and I know many of the lines and I hate the silly trivia nonsense that continually pops up on my chromebook screen. Most of the info. offered is irrelevant to me and adds nothing to the story. And  at that they missed some relevant anomalies: e.g that Jeffrey Chaucer was not yet born during the time frame of the story. The opening scene was in 1187 and he did not appear until 1343. Give or take a few years.
I have seen the movie many times and every time it brings tears to my eyes. True, the modern rock music is out of place and the comments on oppression of the masses of commoners by the uncaring rich and powerful, who while away their time in mindless pursuit of useless things would - I believe - never have happened. I mean the starving serfs would not have the energy to think - never mind talk about - the injustice of the system that has rich people spending more money on their frivolous jewelry and horses and armor and talking about honor while they cheat and lie - but I digress. Yet, it all fits together - the music and Chaucer's bold speeches to the peasants and the dancing to rock music , Ledger's own stumbling efforts to appear to be a nobleman and the supporting characters' expressing their own anger and love and devotion - higher emotions, fit for a knight - to make a wonderful story of triumph of the human spirit over adversity - though, of course it could never have happened.
I don't like the way that they cut out scenes - arbitrarily, it seems - to shorten this version of the story.  The dialogue at the first banquet when Ledger angrily tells Ademar that that there will always be poor people - because their poverty is the only thing that the rich will  not take from them. A powerful statement that always  sets me to thinking that it is a profound truth - but Amazon cut it out and it takes away from the movie. And after that the ""Foxie Lady"" says that the poor may marry for love and the rich may not. An important and insightful comment that speaks to an important theme in the movie - and to the life that you and I are living in - but perhaps the Amazon accountants are not. That was bad.
The casting was marvelous. I marveled at it again this time: the actors and the characters they portray constitute a team that fits just right.
Wat showing the poetry in his soul when he shares that he misses the love of his life - peasant girl that she was - ""like the flowers miss the sun.""
Yes, that hurt me. And it got to the lady's heart. And of course the feminist blacksmith - another anomaly - so proud and so competent and, at the scene with Ledger in the stocks, ready to face the angry mob for Ledger, along with Ledger's other supporting servants.
A story of courage and love: themes that are timeless. But, of course in the Reality that we must live through everyday it is the Ademar's that win, by cheating and threatening and bribing and Love does not conquer all. We all know this.
But after watching ""A Knight's Tale"" I always feel so uplifted that I pause to think that maybe it is true: maybe a man - with dedication and devotion and courage and boundless love - really can ""Change his Stars.""",1520035200,,3200,4.293046357615894

2655747,4,B000IHYBT6,"Enjoyed re-watching this movie after all these years.  Height Ledger was such a talented actor for being so young and I thought no had he lived in real life, that he would be in such a demand.  This is a comedy...what it would probably would happen had the story been real...minus the 80's music and weird-ass'd hairstyles of The main supporting Actress.",1519516800,,354,4.693548387096774

2655751,4,B000IHYBT6,"Heath Ledger, the definition of charisma. He is very well missed.

It's a fun movie with a clear hero, and a clear villain, a maiden in peril, what's not to like?",1514678400,,162,4.225806451612903
2655752,3,B000IHYBT6,"A Very Entertaining Film with a Good Deal of Replay Value!
The Most Unique thing about ""A Knight's Tale"" is the interspersement of Modern Music, Fashion, and other Cultural Elements.

It doesn't go as far as being a Completely Modern setting, by any means.
It's still based in the Medieval Period, but they sneak Modern Culture in, here and there.

It works, much of the time, but when it doesn't, well, it's enough of a reason to knock this movie down a star.
Sometimes they totally miss the mark.

The Hero's Love Interest, for example, gets way too Modern and Diva'ish, from time-to-time, and it can be a real buzzkill.
Another thing that bothered me is the Actor Choice for the Villain.

Not to say that, that guy is not a worthy choice for a Villain, because he definitely fits the part.
I just think that, that guy always gets put in Villain Roles that are way too big, and powerful, for his cast-type.

He is always cast as way more power, and foreboding, than he really is, and in pretty much every movie he's in, he gets away with way too much.
He also never seems to get smacked-down, properly, so that's annoying.

That also segways into some major plot-holes.
I mean, this peasant-knight wins several tournaments, and makes a ton of money, and risks EVERYTHING just because he's fussy about not beating one dude.

Seriously, get some perspective.
That's a major plot-hole, and there are at least several other instances where they make terrible choices after everything goes right for them.

It all turned out better, in the end, but the risk was the WORST idea possible, and it makes no sense that they would do that.
There are various other issues with the logic of the plot, but all that aside, it's still a very amusing, and touching at times, film that is very much worth seeing.

A Modern Day Classic!",1514505600,,1819,4.589506172839506
2655753,2,B000IHYBT6,Sorry - I could not get past the first 2 minutes of the modern music and dancing. It might have some good jousting but I will never know...,1514246400,,139,4.0
2655754,5,B000IHYBT6,This is such a great movie. I love the humor that this movie brings,1513728000,,67,3.857142857142857
2655755,5,B000IHYBT6,"This was MUCH better than I thought it would be. It's not a docudrama with medieval realism by any stretch of the imagination. It's a good old fashioned predictable action comedy!

I love the way the movie integrates modern rock and roll into the sound track. And not in a forced way either. They make it work with the film.

It's very well made. The Costumes and set design look authentic. (Granted I'm not an expert in this time period) It's got big budget visuals.

The story is the predictable part. Shocker....things work out for the hero. (If that's a spoiler to you for a film like this you've literally never watched a single movie ever) But that's fine. Sometimes that's what you're looking for.

It pulls you into the story like you are a spectator at a jousting tournament the same way Major League has you rooting for the Indians or The Replacements makes you feel like a Sentinals fan. It's basically a sports movie when you boil it down, just with a sport that lost popularity a few hundred years ago.

I had never seen this before but always wanted to. Saw it on Prime last night and took a shot. I was thoroughly entertained for 2 hours.",1513728000,,1153,4.4714285714285715
2655756,4,B000IHYBT6,Very good and yes I will watch it again. A little cheesy at the start but once it gets rolling well worth watching.,1513382400,,115,4.043478260869565

2655760,5,B000IHYBT6,"I love this movie. I have seen it many times and it never gets old. Rufus Sewell is fabulous as the evil count, and Heath Ledger and crew wonderful as peasants made good. One of the best!",1512691200,,187,4.081081081081081
2655761,5,B000IHYBT6,"The goals for people when watching films varies.  But I think everyone wants to be rewarded with some feel-good.  This film has a few feel-good moments.

About me.  I have watched so many films to where I consider myself a film buff.  If a film doesn't have any creativity or originality, I typically won't like it.  One example is runaway train with denzel.  I thought it was so predictable that it was horrible.  I'm drawn to A Knight's Tale because it's different.  Maybe as you watch it becomes predictable, but it has many moments that I look forward to.  I don't think it's fair that I have to hold back spoilers for people who haven't seen a film that was released 16 years ago, so I'm going to say, there's a moment when William jousts with a Prince when he knows his identity ahead of time.  That was a good moment.  The Prince even calls it Knightly later on.  And in that same moment - later on - he also stood up for William when everyone had turned on him for hiding his identity.  And that's what the Prince had done in order to compete in the games.

Colville.

The bottom line is if you're coming into this film with expectations of getting a history lesson, or don't like a film that tries to be cute and different, then you'll not like this.  There's a dance scene when they start playing David Bowie and I thought it was classic.  A sort of modern history if you will.  That was cute.  Others will say ridiculous, but you have to realize this whole film is more-so a spoof than it is to be taken seriously.  It's more like spaceballs than it is star wars, for analogy's sake.

We all have our own thoughts and it's all subjective.  What I like, you may not.  But if you're curious, just don't go into this film with any serious expectations.  If you're hoping for David Lynch suspense, go watch Mulholland Drive, not this.  If you want a history lesson, go elsewhere.  If you're the type of person who will agree with those who gave this 1-star ratings, then please pass right on by.

Last thing I want to say is I got this for a friend who had it on her ""stocking stuffer"" list years ago.  I hadn't heard of it, but you bet I watched it.  I'm the type of person who wishes everyone would write a memoir of your favorite movies and books, then when you pass away, that memoir should be public record.  I will read up on your favorite films and watch any I haven't seen.  I have found many of my favorite films to be others' favorites that I'd never heard of.  The first time I saw A Knight's Tale, I thought it a bit cheesy, but it made me feel good.  Today I watched this for the 57th time (give or take) and I still laughed and still felt good.",1512518400,,2665,4.253493013972056

Note to all those uptight historians blasting A Knight's Tale for it's lack of historical accuracy - Uhm, no, this is not a realistic presentation of life in the Middle Ages. Nope, it's not that at all. If you want a grim medieval docudrama, go elsewhere. This one is a playful riff on reaching from the mud to the stars. It's a tale of manifold love - between a boy and a girl, between a father and a son, among friends who care for each other.

2655796,5,B000IHYBT6,"This movie has gradually become one of my favorites over the years. A very few years ago it did a several month stretch on the movie channels when it seemed to be on several times a week. It wasn't unusual during that period for my wife and I to catch it every couple of weeks or so.

Heath Ledger is perfect as the squire masquerading as a knight, and Rufus Sewell portrays a villain with an unexpected depth of character.

Many parts are just as funny to me every time I watch it (in many ways like a lot of scenes in Tootsie). We always enjoy the sequence where Heath is perfecting his skills at jousting.

The film is very unique in that it consistently breaks with the 'period', yet seems to portray it in a believable way anyhow. I think the reason for this is that the anachronisms serve to involve us in the events in the same way behavior of the time would have drawn those living several hundred years ago ... but we wouldn't fully understand or appreciate those same behaviors now. So the modern behaviors help to involve us in the same way that those of the period might have felt. That sounded convoluted as I wrote it, I hope people get it. LOL The film is also a beautiful piece of cinematography if you see it well presented. This is a movie that I first saw on cable, many times (and before we had HD). I have since bought it twice. Once to see the original wide-screen format, and again on Blu-ray.

The Blu ray presentation is gorgeous. Visually, the heart of the movie are the jousting scenes, with beautiful horses and gleaming armor. The Blu ray doesn't disappoint, looking far better than even the HD presentation on movie channels.",1508976000,,1655,4.416393442622951

2655824,5,B000IHYBT6,"I first stumbled across this film when channel surfing. Initially skeptical given the modern music in the film but it works. I was hooked! Fantastic performances from the excellent cast, and the songs they chose were great. (Modern music was used, I read, so viewers would feel what people of the time felt when they listened to music, music which sounds archaic to us or is labeled as classical & gives us a different emotional experience. Was surprised to learn that there was a serious reason for the choice.) Despite the music, the competition & romance are very serious like other films about knights, so you get a lot out of one film. A must see in my book.",1501545600,,663,4.579831932773109

2655851,5,B000IHYBT6,"I love campy 80's medieval movies and this one isn't one of those, it is a campy 90's medieval movie and has all the wonderful and Clichy things I love in pseudo fantasy. There are horses, swords and men in armor that is all over the place for its time in history. There are crowds of ""peasants"" that know Queen and their music, lyrics and beat and can do it in a style that rivals any free concert in the park. There are many beautiful people far to clean for any station their character might have held, so much clean hair and make up that it just about takes you out of the story, that is if you are watching for that sort of thing.
I however see it as a game, like an RPG akin to D&D played with your junior high buddies where the DM is trying to add a political element to it and they keep goofing around and wondering why there isn't a mage class. Though the guy playing the bard steals the show, his scenes far out weigh those of the others. The female smithy is ahead of her time, by quite a bit, but maybe the person playing her is a sister of the others, you know how that goes. Once I got this thought in my head every jousting scene was, ""Ok, how many hit points do have left and can I make a charisma check towards the girl in the audience?""",1497916800,,1254,4.040160642570281

Just one thing, if breaking a lance scores you points why not just get a crappy lance, you'd win every joust? For my taste the movie tries too hard to inject modern sensibilities into everything; although, it makes no claims to be historically accurate. Fun largely mindless entertainment and should be enjoyed as such. With a good rock 'n' roll soundtrack The Blu-ray has good picture and even better sound quality.

Most interesting, to me anyway, is the unusual combination of modern colloquial speech and 1979's rock anthems, with the visuals of noble knights jousting, and lords and ladies dancing. It was a very interesting choice by the director, and one which really adds to the atmosphere. Hearing, ""We Will Rock You"" at the start of a joust, or ""We Are the Champions"", following one such tilt, lets you know that the movie doesn't take itself too seriously.

Bottom line is, this is a movie you can turn on, dive into, and enjoy. I would recommend it to anyone.",1477353600,,831,4.763888888888889

The jousting is spectacular and seems to fit the profile of a 'chick flick' and a guy film.  !00% encourage you to try it out.",1433289600,,397,4.171052631578948

There are SO many scenes, which make the entire movie better e.g. Geoffrey's address to the mob attacking William was both heartfelt & wonderful.

(I read a review from a history buff who missed the point of this movie.) I am a retired teacher (I am somewhat an authority on Anne Boleyn and any Tudor history. I loved this sub and  I have taught history for many years. Getting students to like history is a very difficult endeavor. Most teachers just suck the life out of this subject when honestly....it should be a fun one. What this movie does....is add a modern twist to an old tale. It gets people 'interested"" in history. Once you open the door....to some people..... and show them how interesting history is....many walk right through. What I try to convey to my students,regarding history....is this simple caveat: While the backdrop of history is happening...children are born....grow up...fall in love...have children of their own...raise them and watch the cycle repeat itself until they die. It is the universal ""thing"" that we share with people within history. This movie....while having fun with history...does just that and doesn't take itself seriously.",1423612800,,1186,4.98989898989899

Love the music & we can almost recite the movie word for word!  Anyway,  kids home from college & we all watch movie & go to find extras and... None!  So disappointed I got rid of my DVD version.  Hopefully next year when it is the tenth anniversary,  they will release an anniversary edition with the old extras & some new ones.

2656774,4,B000IHYBT6,"To get the most enjoyment out of A KNIGHT'S TALE (2001), you probably need to put on a strong pair of suspenders ... to help you ""suspend your disbelief."" This joyful comedy, set in Europe in the year 1370, is brimming over with hundreds of deliberate anachronisms, large and small, that will add to your amusement and enjoyment once you get accustomed to them.

The hero of this romantic comedy (or adventure comedy ... or comic romantic adventure) is William Thatcher (whose father literally was a roof thatcher), a peasant-squire played by the late Heath Ledger. When his master, Sir Ector, dies, William, with the help of his friends, puts on Sir Ector's armor and enters a large number of tournaments ... and is a huge success! He and Lady Jocelyn (a noble-woman played by Shannyn Sossamon) soon notice each other and begin feeling a strong mutual attraction. However, a suave, unscrupulous villain named Count Adhemar (played wonderfully by Rufus Sewell) has his own sights set on Lady Jocelyn and is determined to crush William by any means necessary.

A large part of the humor derives from the score of this film, which is made up of a large array of 1970s rock hits ... such as Queen's ""We Will Rock You"" and David Bowie's ""Golden Years."" Additional humor is found in the antics and dialogue of William's helpers: Roland, a chubby squire (Mark Addy), Wat, a red-haired squire (Alan Tudyk), and Chaucer, a down-on-his-luck poet who has unsurpassed skill with words and will eventually become famous for THE CANTERBURY TALES (Paul Bettany is a standout in this role). Further assisting William, mainly with his armor, and adding sweetness and charm to the mix, is Kate-the-blacksmith (Laura Fraser). Yes, a female blacksmith! And not only that: she is the inventor of a totally new special kind of steel that is far stronger AND of far lighter weight than that of any other blacksmith in Europe!

NOT A SPOILER: As all viewers will predict, Count Rufus of Sewell will almost certainly interfere with the romance between Sir Heath of Ledger and Lady Jocelyn ... and with Sir Heath's success in tournaments. And all viewers will guess that Count Rufus, in order to get his way, will fight VERY dirty both on and off the so-called Field of Honor. And, whatever victories Count Rufus may have, the comic tone of this film will lead all viewers to predict the plot's final outcome correctly ... at least in a general way.

Overall, the soundtrack, the costumes, the acting, the comic timing, the visual effects (especially during dozens of jousts), and the plot are extremely pleasing. My only two quibbles are with the film's two main female roles. On the one hand, I felt that Kate-the-blacksmith, a very likable character, needed at least one additional scene in which we get to see that she will be much better off than she was at the start (it could be, for instance, her being respected by the male blacksmiths who had previously mocked her). On the other hand, I felt that Lady Jocelyn, despite being a proto-feminist a few times, came across as a person fully aware she was born into privilege ... and that she occasionally acted like a spoiled brat just because she could. I could not really warm up to her for that reason, and I felt that Sir Heath was being foolish to encourage her in such behavior.

In my judgment, if I were giving this film a letter grade, it deserves a strong ""B+"".",1416009600,,3401,4.728499156829679

If they hadn't used the names of actual historic figures, I would have rated this movie alot higher as I don't have as much of an issue with the rock music used or the jousting/dancing inaccuracies depicted in the movies.  But to make Edward, the Black Prince something that he was not, is a travesty as children and young adults will believe these depictions to be historically correct, or at least implant in peoples subconscious that he was a good guy.  He was not.  He hated the lower class, he imposed excessively high taxes on his subjects, he did not necessarily believe in chivalry or follow it's rules, he razed (burned and pillaged) villages in warfare, he did all of those things that the movie attributes to someone else.  It portrays him as almost saintly.  They should have created names that are in no way tied to any historical person or event (ie. Battle of Poitiers), then go ahead and take creative license in portraying jousting events as some kind of modern era NFL game with rock music and disco dancing.
There will be people that will love this movie, as the basic plot is universally accepted, but to ignore the errors in the portrayal of actual historical figures is irresponsible and misleading to future generations and does not outweigh the entertaining qualities of the movie.
With changes to these errors, I would have rated this with 4 stars.",1407715200,,1483,4.7734375

2656833,1,B000IHYBT6,"I'm one of those historical jerks who likes authenticity, and hearing gen-X rock musical homages in this film because some corporate marketer said it was a good idea to sell more tickets, really angers me. Allegedly the director and producer state on the DVD that they thought it was a good idea to include modern music to show the audience that music then had the same thrust as it did now, but that's a lie.

Music then was generated to adorn song which is part of how news was spread. And the crowds at tournaments were more lawless than any American football fan or Scottish or British soccer hooligan. Open nudity, peasants wrestling for money and fighting dirty, the occasional open faced debauchery in public, and so forth, as well as murders and thieving, were part of what being at a medieval tournament were all about. Yet here it's turned into a well organized sporting event. The only thing missing is the giant medieval jumbo-tron.

This is a dumb movie. It's an idiotic movie. It's not only detached from reality by several degrees, but the social message isn't even that inventive; i.e. it's okay for guys and girls of different social backgrounds to date and fall in love with one another. Oh gee ... really? Gosh, I guess it's okay for me to think about a variety of women in a variety of erotic situations, which I did already before this piece of garbage was put forth.

I'm sorry the late Heath Ledger did this flick, but, well, he did, and I'm sorry it's going to be forever on his resume of films, for in time I think people will come to half heatedly dislike it and acknowledge the garbage that it might have been, but the otherwise luke warm period piece that it is.

The one thing that I really applaud the film for is the art direction. The acting, script, and music aside, the film makers did partially capture the era with the sets and costumes. It's too bad there wasn't a better movie to wear the clothes that is the backdrop created by both budget and director.

2656851,4,B000IHYBT6,"While I consider myself to have a broad range of tastes when it comes to movies, I admit that I don't like most historical films.  They tend to be boring, full of stilted dialogue, and oftentimes pretentious.  I watch movies to have fun, not to watch an overwrought spectacle that takes itself far too seriously and, more often than not, seems to be fishing for an Oscar rather than trying to be entertaining.  Call me a schlub or an uncultured heathen, but that's simply my feelings on the subject.  So I avoided ""A Knight's Tale"" for awhile, simply because I assumed it was another drab medieval film.  But then I read a review, discovered the decidedly modern bent of the film (which the reviewer hated), and immediately decided that any film that managed to combine jousting knights with the music of Queen, AC/DC, War, and Bachman-Turner Overdrive had to be worth a look.

If you're expecting a serious historical film, or even one that's historically accurate, look elsewhere.  But if you're wanting a fun medieval romp that makes no pretense at taking itself seriously, you're well on your way to enjoying this film.

Young squire William Thatcher aspires to someday become a knight and to compete in the jousting tournaments, despite being a peasant's son and having no noble blood.  He gets his chance at stardom when, upon the death of his master, he's forced to disguise himself and take his place in a tournament.  With the aid of his fellow squires, sensible Roland and snarky Wat, and a wandering writer by the name of Geoffrey Chaucer, he takes on the persona of a fictional knight, Ulric von Liechtenstein, to continue to compete.  Along the way he brazenly courts the semi-rebellious noblewoman Joselyn, receives aid from a female blacksmith, makes a powerful enemy in rival jouster Count Adhemar, and ends up taking the jousting world by storm while valiantly trying to cover up his true identity.  And his rags-to-riches story is accompanied not by music of the era or an orchestral score, but by classic rock of the '70s.

This movie takes quite a bit of liberty with historical facts, and doesn't try to hide that it's putting entertainment over accuracy.  In my mind, the film is all the better for it.  If one is able to accept that the film is going more for entertainment than accuracy, they're able to more fully enjoy the story and characters.  That way, when anachronisms do rear their heads, one isn't jarred completely out of the film by them.  (Though it's worth noting that more than one source has pointed out that, for all its rock songs and Joselyn's decidedly modern-looking dresses, ""A Knight's Tale"" is still more historically accurate than many of the so-called ""serious"" medieval epics out there.  For one thing, female blacksmiths DID exist -- though it's highly unlikely that they put the Nike swoosh on the armor they forged...)

The story is one that's been told multiple times -- an underdog takes on the big dogs in a favorite sport and comes out on top -- but the medieval bent to it gives it a new twist.  It's actually pretty fun to see a sports story set in another time period, and to see that for all the obvious differences between our time and theirs, some things never did change.  We still obsess over sports figures and favorite pastimes, and it's still satisfying to see the little guy score a victory.  And the characters are a delightful bunch, still managing to be snarky, witty, and playful even when they're using the dialogue and slang of the day.  (Though the term ""foxy lady"" does come up once in the movie -- and somehow Heath Ledger manages to make it work in context.)

If you're willing to suspend your disbelief, this is a fun movie, with a great soundtrack, fun characters, and plenty of humor to make up for the predictable story.  Destined to become a cult classic.",1397088000,,3839,4.719640179910045

True love is discovered in a most unusual way, as Jocelyn challenges ""Sir Ulrich"" to behave contrary to nature...

Will ""Ulrich"" rise to Jocelyn's challenge? Will he be able to escape Adhemar's treachery? Will Jeffery Chaucer ever recover his clothes? (My kids say it should have been called, ""The Writer's Tail""...)  Trudging.  (You will only understand if you watch it.)

The movie is well rounded with excitement, comedy, great characters, and romance. The secondary theme, the love story, is touching.

But Casablanca is dated and still enjoyed immensely.  The '70's rock and the costumes can be a little disconcerting but the salvation of the movie comes in the courage and joy of life of the characters.  It also comes from Heath Ledger's smile. When he smiles you smile.  It's based on the old, expected themes of what constitutes real nobility and justice delayed but there's a strong character to root for and a strong reason to root for him.  There is also the theme music to mention, if that's what it's called.  There is a theme that runs throughout the movie that touches the heart, and no, it's not rock n roll. I saw it for the first time at the theatre.  I wish everyone could.  You don't get the power of the jousts from the dvd but the director uses the sound of the horses hooves and snorting which is very powerful with dolby or whatever theatres use to amplify sound that gives an added excitement.  There is a dinner scene with Ledger and his love that is the most beautiful love scene in movie history.  You would hardly expect to find it in this kind of movie but there it is.  My best advice is don't be a snob about it.  It won't let you down.",1391644800,,1340,4.308

Too bad about Heath Ledger not making it much further than this flick - he was a great little actor and very cute.  (and old lady can dream can't she???)",1386201600,,469,4.63855421686747

It's a fun movie that is just trying to tell an engaging story and does so rather well. Of particular note is the dance after Sir Ulrich's first tournament set to ""Golden Years.""

2656926,5,B000IHYBT6,"A Knight's Tale is a classic rags-to-riches plus hero-and-villain tale set in medieval France and England.  The predictable plot is balanced well by tongue-in-cheek dialog, good action scenes and a healthy irreverence for pretty much everything.  Add in a rock and roll music score and crowds behaving more like modern day soccer fans than 17th century peasants and you have a movie that's fun all around.

There's no foul language, frontal nudity or gore.  This makes A Knight's Tale a movie that appeals to the whole family with enough slap-stick for the under-ten crowd, sword-play for the tweens and younger teens, and clever humor that's over the kids' heads' to keep older teens and adults well entertained.",1380067200,,713,5.068376068376068

2656930,5,B000IHYBT6,"The early  years of Heath Ledger prove the great acting/character
portraying abilities. I thought that I had acquired all of his films until
I saw an incomplete version on late TV shown on 'BBC-America'
ergo, I contacted my faithful 'Amazon' and as hoped... they delivered.
In this day and age, where the lowest form of morals are thrown in
your face and sex appears equal to violence in EVERY picture made,
it is most enjoyable to watch an story told,where one may use their
own imagination to fill-in the grey areas.  Great adventure, intrigue,
and a love story.  Excellent cinematography!",1378857600,,591,4.89

2656965,5,B000IHYBT6,"This is a movie that does not take itself too seriously.  That is evident from the opening scene where a medieval jousting match is set to We Will Rock you.  In fact there are rock songs from the  1970s and 1980s all throughout the movie.  The story is pretty basic, a peasant pretends to be a noble so he can enter tournament games.  He falls in love with a fair maiden, has an adversary to deal with and risks being found out all along the way.

The strength of the movie is the cast.  If the Joker in Dark Knight ended up being Heath Ledger's signature role, this is the one that established him as having Hollywood lead potential.  His character William was a blend of heroic, prideful, stubborn, and naive and he pulled them off very well.  As well as adding an element of humor.  The supporting cast was also great.  Paul Bettany was the standout as Geoffrey Chaucer (who announced William's matches.  Mark Addy,  Alan Tudyk (who any fan of Joss Whedon's recent TV series will recognize) and Laura Fraser all did great in their respective roles as William's crew.  I also thought Shannyn Sossamon did a fair job as the love interest, although her performance was nothing to write home about.  It was one of her first movie roles and she was relatively green.  The role called more for her to look pretty than it did for and academy award winning acting performance.

Ultimately the movie is not going to appeal to everyone.  It does not even really attempt to be a very serious or overly dramatic movie.  Certainly not a historically accurate period piece.  It was meant to be a fun, even silly at times movie that blended action and comedy.  To that end it pulled it off well.  And if you are a fan of those kinds of movies or any of the actors involved it is a fine way to spend a couple hours.",1376611200,,1802,4.3969696969696965

He was accompanied by a truly great cast of actors that gained their own recognition in this movie as well. The movie may seem a bit quirky with the introduction of more modern music by Queen, David Bowie, & several other artists, but it fits in place like a piece of puzzle & completes the chemistry of the movie. Although Heath Ledger is more noted for his role as the Joker, I think the role as a knight was better suited for him. The movie has all the elements that will keep the viewer interested: love, romance, tragedy, betrayal, & plenty of humor. This is a delightful & uplifting movie that you will not regret purchasing.

2656999,3,B000IHYBT6,"I can appreciate putting modern-day music, speech, and girl-power attitudes in a story that takes place centuries ago. Sort of. It's creative, after all. The thing I'm not really sure about, however, is WHY they needed to mix the two eras. Was it to make an older story appealing to a younger, modern audience? Could be, because I know plenty of people my age (33), or even older, and definitely younger, who seem to think movies from the 80s are old! Please people, moving pictures have existed since the late 1800s.

Anyway, I liked the movie. It kept me entertained and of course the music was good. Like I said, I always appreciate creativity. But a princess (or whatever her classification was) with a sloppy hairdo sticking out in all directions, and a see-through dress just distracts me. Sorry!",1374451200,,802,4.76978417266187

2657103,5,B000IHYBT6,"I have read a large chunk of the negative reviews for this movie and I have to say ""Relax ya SNOBS!"" Its a fun take on a genre which has become tired and stale. The medieval genre had its peak back in the late 80's/early 90's with such movies as Excalibur and Dragon Slayer. Since then its gotten a slew of hack flicks like First Knight to represent it as well as the 94 different versions of Robyn Hood themed movies. Into this walks A Knight's Tale. It's fresh, funny, daring enough to stray from the same tired old tales and breath some life back into a genre I love. I can't rave about it enough.

Granted, true traditionalist purists will scoff at the introduction of modern music, often citing the opening ""We Will Rock You"" tune of Queen fame as their first nose wrinkling moment of disdain for the picture. I found it well thought out and appropriate. You must remember, knights on the jousting field were the NFL superstars of the day. They risked life and limb in the pursuit of victory on the field. They were the ones children dreamed of becoming and ladies swooned at the sight of. I found the juxtaposition of this particular song over the images of ye olde jousting field quite interesting and a prelude of the fun yet to come!

I think the underlying theme of honor being a value that everyone should aspire to achieve and cling to once attained regardless of station in life is uplifting and wonderful. A poor child from cheapside longs to become a Knight and participate in the joust. His father, a lowly thatcher love his child so much that he cuts a deal to send him off and squire for a low level knight. His parting words ""Change your stars and live a better life than I have."" The sentiment is touching to say the least. Through a series of outrageous gambles and circumstance our lowly thatchers son gets his chance to ""become"" a knight. He ""changes his stars"" as the movie puts it. He embraces the role so wholeheartedly that when faced with finishing an injured opponent or agreeing to a draw to let the man keep his honor, our knight agrees to the draw. We learn later that the knight he spared is actually the Black Prince of England, and its a kindness that does not go unforgotten by the Prince.

The knight returns to his home of London and ultimately to his father, now much older and blind yet still trying to ply his trade. And at this point our hero's masquerade is exposed by his only nemesis. Captured and tortured our hero is strung up to a pillary in the towns square. One by one HIS squires, his friends come to stand before him to protect him. As the crowd begins to pelt the group with garbage and rotten veggies the stars do actually change for our hero. From out of the crowd the Prince emerges.

""What a pair we make, huh? Both trying to hide who we are, both unable to do so. Your men love you. If I knew nothing else about you, that would be enough. But you also tilt when you should withdraw... and that is knightly, too.""

The movie has romance, action, humor (buddy humor ABOUNDS), interesting characters (yes, despite the fact that history shows some of them could not have met but then again, if you want historical accuracy, watch documentaries), and just enough cheese to keep it lighthearted and fun. It also has some GREAT classic rock which pops out at interesting times to create a very neat feeling.

Above all, the movie tells us that we can cling to a dream, we can reach for more than life lays at our feet and if we stay true to that we can prevail... and have a lot of fun along the way.",1365033600,,3551,4.380880121396054

2657121,5,B000IHYBT6,"What a Fantastic movie! It had everything that I wanted when I originally saw it in the theatres and now that I have it on DVD I couldn't be more pleased. First of all, I want to inform you that I'm the 256th Five Star reviewer and the 525th person overall to review this magnificent movie.

William Thatcher (Descendant Of Margaret Thatcher?) is a squire who takes advantage of a situation that presents itself to him. When his lord dies of a heart attack he decides to use his armor and cop his Identity in a jousting tournament. He wins the tournament and with the prize money decides with his friends to continue jousting in the guise of Ulrich von Liechenstein. Along the way he encounters Jeffrey Chaucer, a writer and poet who is able to create the forged documents that legitimize his identity. They meet an ironsmith named Kate Farris, a woman who is the best at her trade yet is discriminated against because of her gender. Along with Roland and Wat (The Original Squires), they form a companionship that endures through good times and bad times.

I liked the themes of this movie (Not The Song Thems Though). A humble man who rises above his station and defeats the wealthy arrogant noble while along the way becomes friends with men in high places and meets and charms a beautiful woman who in turn loves him through thick and thin! This is every guys dream.

A Knight's tale has it all. Adventure, excitement, locales galore in the beautiful Czech Republic and of course more beautiful women! Heath Ledger hwas remarkable in this film. I can honestly say it is one of his four or five best movies Ledger ever did. Now let me say that I did not like the thematic music. Rock music from the 1970s has no place in a period piece set in the Middle-ages. Although I did like the incidental music, which was more in tune with the time period; it was the unrealistic thematic music that irked me. Still, this movie is a Four and a Half Star movie and if you buy it on DVD you will not be disappointed.

This is my 175th review for Amazon!

2657122,4,B000IHYBT6,"...make this film. I am not ""into"" medievil films exactly, so I'm no purist regarding the particulars I read in the negative reviews of the movie. I began watching it without any preconceived notions and took it at face value. Tudyk and Bettany's characters (and wonderful acting) are entertaining enough to carry the film regardless of anyone's tastes or preferences in genre. If you want to watch a light-hearted movie that will entertain (without getting angry that they dared to put ""that"" kind of music with ""this"" kind of movie) you'll most likely enjoy it as much as I did.

Rotten Tomatoes critics gave it 58%, audiences 80%. The negative consensus seems to be that the haters detested the idea of mixing modern with medievil.  It seems to me that the fun in a lot of movies is the idea that you can say, ""What if this happened..."" and not really have to be technical about it all. If you're making a documentary, I agree, you should be as specific and correct about factual things as possible. But, if you're just having fun and asking the audience to imagine along with you, what's the harm?

If you want to watch a more serious-minded adventure set in medievil times, do not watch this movie. It will only make you mad.  If you're just in the mood to forget about your worries, stresses, and all the bad news we're bombarded with in daily life, give it a try.

Movies I loved (to give you an idea of what I think is good): Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, Avatar, Groundhog Day, Matrix, Big Fish, Catch Me if You Can, O Brother Where Art Thou, The Color Purple, Planes, Trains & Automobiles, Pride & Prejudice, Sling Blade, True Grit, Shallow Hal, Uncle Buck, Inception, et. al.

I will recommend an early HEATH LEDGER movie I really like. TWO HANDS. It's Australian, as is Heath. The story is GREAT, INVENTIVE, FUNNY and all the actors are great. Even though TWO HAND is HUMOROUS, it's not really a comedy. It's a gangster movie. I love Australian cinema and TWO HANDS is very representative of that genre.",1353715200,,575,4.433962264150943

The film effectively merges multiple genres, and in turn audiences are treated to a wonderfully witty, rock-god-esque romp through time, with a dash of medieval chivalry thrown in for good measure. Heath Ledger shines as William, as does Paul Bettany as Chaucer, and you really do fall in love with the characters. Just sit back, relax, don't think too much about the historical inaccuracies, and let Queen's ""We will rock you"" transport you into this tale.",1340668800,,601,4.844660194174757

However, Heath Ledger did a good job and was convincing as the knight/thatcher. The pairing of rock'n'roll music to the film was somewhat strange, I wasn't sure whether it was distracting - drawing my attention away from the plot since the music was so outrageously incompatible, or did it serve to wake me up every once in awhile with it's outlandishness?

2657189,5,B000IHYBT6,"I have to admit that when I first started showing this video to my 12th graders, it was as a reward for first reading and analyzing parts of Chaucer's ""Canterbury Tales"" in class.  Besides just enjoying this highly entertaining film though, they were instructed to take notes on the things the filmmakers got right about what we know about the Middle Ages and the things that were obviously anachronistic.  I also had them evaluate the way the character of Chaucer is portrayed and if they thought he mirrored what we knew about the historical figure and his worldview.
As a bonus, I have discovered that much of the back-and-forth between the lovers ties in well with the lessons in The Wife of Bath's Tale as do the arguments the character Chaucer makes in his wonderfully persuasive speech to the mob while William is in the stocks. Since I also teach rhetorical techniques, it makes a good example of the use of pathos.

2657195,5,B000IHYBT6,"Few films fill me with the same amount of joy that `A Knights Tale' pulls out of me each and every time I watch it.  It just seems to have everything going for it, and so it easily rises in the ranks for me as one of the finest films of its particular breed.

It's fun, fresh and heartwarming.

`A Knights Tale' begins with an accidental discovery of talent that launches a young peasant named William into unfamiliar territory as he forges his identity in order to joust.  Along the way he picks up cohorts that help him advance in the medieval tournaments and even help him sway the heart of a young maiden named Jocelyn, who has also fallen under the eye of Count Adhemar, a selfish and malicious man intent of having what he wants and squashing William in the process.

The wonderful thing about `A Knights Tale' is that it takes an age-old canvas and completely reinvents it, while maintaining a watchful eye of naysayers who would be quick to dismiss it as a joke.  It modernizes and embellishes the beautiful aspects of the genre while understanding the importance to respect the roots that make this genre so beloved.  While nowhere near as extreme as Baz Luhrmann's take on the musical that very same year (ala `Moulin Rouge!'), `A Knights Tale' uses rock anthems and new world gags to give this film set so far in the past some edge and fresh appeal.  From the set pieces to the costumes (complete with Nike logo) to the oft stunning cinematography and breakneck editing, `A Knights Tale' just gets it.

And then there is Heath Ledger.  What a marvelous talent lost to the world, and it is films like this that remind us of his range and the fact that he is so dearly missed.  The way that Ledger layers young William is superb.  He really took the time to create someone guarded yet charismatic (something of a signature for Ledger), while never forgetting those tender touches that elevated his every movement.  The moment where he reunites with his father is especially effective.

The rest of the cast is also very good, especially Mark Addy (just love that teddybear), Paul Bettany (this guy needs a better career) and the STUNNING Shannon Sossamon who just yanks your eyeballs out of your skull and conceals them in her dress.

Fun, witty, charming and exciting to the very end; `A Knights Tale' is a tale to be told and remembered.",1310688000,,2348,4.583732057416268

The actors all seem to have been having a heck of a good time, and their fun is infectious. I've heard some write this off as historically inaccurate (to which I say: so are most Hollywood historicals), while others have dismissed it as a by-the-numbers sports-genre movie, only with jousting. Maybe. But if so, it's also an inaccurate genre picture with a wonderful sense of humor, a charismatic lead in Ledger, and a scene-stealing performance by Paul Bettany as a silver tongued version of Geoffrey Chaucer who is possessed by a talent for ringside announcing. Anachronistic? You bet - but that anachronistic quality is deliberate, and if you can get past that and just roll with the filmmakers' sense of whimsy, you'll have a blast.",1310169600,,1034,4.8474576271186445

2657199,3,B000IHYBT6,"A Knight's Tale, written and produced by Brian Helgeland is the story of a meager peasant (William Thatcher) who attempts to ""change his stars"" and joust as a knight. Taking place in the 1370's, though spiced up with modern 1970's music, hairstyles and crowd behaviors; this story is filled with medieval themes, and conflicts, but is also laced with more relatable conflicts. Released on May 11, 2001, it was mostly well received by the public, though heavily critiqued for its retro throw-backs. It was produced by Columbia Pictures.
 William Thatcher is a poor peasant who has a burning desire to become a knight and joust--a desire he has had since he was a small boy. With the help of his squire friends, Roland and Wat, who are argumentative and against the idea at first, he achieves this dream. The love of his life, Jocelyn, a beautiful noble lady who prefers to wear rather colorful, eccentric attire, is met later in the story. Arduous challenges are met on the way, such as Count Adhemar, a spoiled count who mistreats other people and has also taken a rather lecherous interest in William's Jocelyn. Big-headed and eloquent is Chaucer, the writer of William's patents of nobility and his announcer at the jousts. Proud and hard-working is Kate, the blacksmith who makes William's jousting armor.
When the knight William is serving (Sir Ector) dies he spontaneously decides to take his armor and use this tragic event to achieve his dream to become a knight. His squire friends are skeptical at first but decide to help him in the end. Endless training and a few patents get them into the arena, but more trouble awaits them there. After winning several jousts and becoming generally well liked by the crowd, William is confronted with Count Adhemar, a nasty spoiled man who is determined to win the tournament. The remainder of the story revolves around this William-Adhemar conflict.
Because of the mixed elements from the 1370's and the 1970's this story has many interesting themes. ""Never give up"" seems to be a prevalent theme, a theme which is most evident in the moment when William decides to tie his lance to his arm rather than forfeit the match. Another is ""A man can change the stars"" which means that if you desire something badly enough, you can have it--you just have to work for it. Intriguingly this theme is presented in multiple forms, for not only does William work to become a knight and win the jousting tournament, he also works to win the heart of his love--Jocelyn--and rightfully earns both in the end. From this story, the greatest thing we can learn, however, is that we shouldn't let other's opinions of us prevent us from following out dream.
In my opinion, A Knight's Tale was an enjoyable movie. It was not my favorite, nor was it a magnificent work of art like Inception, and I probably wouldn't want to watch it again. However, that does not mean that I didn't like the movie. As I said before it was enjoyable, it was funny, it was even slightly historical, but I honestly don't have time in my busy life to watch it again--I only re-watch movies that are absolutely brilliant.",1308528000,,3125,4.755064456721915

2657206,5,B000IHYBT6,"A fun movie with great soundtrack.  The actors were perfect for their roles; the actresses weren't as appealing, but it was a fun few hours.",1287532800,,140,4.6
2657207,4,B000IHYBT6,"This film was suppose to take place in 14th-century Europe (More about that later), and a Knight, Sir Ector, while being escorted by his very faithful squires from tournament to tournament, suddenly and unexpectedly falls dead (while sleeping under a tree).

His squires played by Heath Ledger, Mark Addy and Alan Tudyk are at a loss as to what to do as Sir Ector's death has suddenly left them unemployed and more or less up the creek. Out of desperation, William (played by Heath Ledger) takes over the role of Sir Ector and accompanied by the two other remaining squires continues on their quest to win tournaments, ergo make a living for themselves.

On the road to the next challenge of arms they run into a naked guy walking down the road who turns out to be no other than the young Geoffrey Chaucer (Paul Bettany). Geoffrey seems to have a gambling problem and lost all. The trio allow him to accompany them as he, Geoffrey, has the ability to forge the proper documents to show that Charles is a true knight...all this is quite illegal of course.

The story is a story of the little guy making good. It is the adventure of these three men as they go from tournament to tournament, surprisingly winning them as they go! Of course there is a love interest for William, and an evil enemy. The plot is pretty loose but this is not a movie you go to in order to bask I a great plot line; nor should I mention, expect historical accuracy...far, far from it. But this is actually part of the charm of this movie. It has some truly hilarious parts in it and if you watch very closely, the makers of this film have slipped all kinds of treats in here and there.

As an example, first you have to remember that this is supposed to be 14th-century Europe. Right from the start you will find the peasants rocking out and singing ""We Will Rock You"" and ""Golden Years."" This is an absolute hoot. If you look closer, you will find such things as the Nike symbol on armor, contemporary clothing on some of the women; which include styles from the 1930s and 1940s, hair styles that simply are not old European. Accents from today are mingled with those of yesterday as well as attitudes toward just about everything.

One of the high spots of this picture was Paul Bettany's portrayal of Geoffrey Chaucer. He had this part nailed and actually stole the show. He would introduce his Knight (William) before every jousting match like an announcer at a professional wrestling match...lines like ""I'd like to send a shout out to Sir William, show him some love!"" were priceless.

This show was meant to be enjoyed for what it was...a comedy romp, a bit of poking fun here and there. It had flaws of course, but the solid acting, visual gags and silliness well made up for what may have been lacking.

This is simply a funny and enjoyable tale.

It was shipped early and I was surprised not only with how quick I received it, but the DVD was as advertised- that has not been the case with all my purchases.  Thank you for exceeding my expectations- I appreciate you!",1284940800,,322,4.35
2657209,5,B000IHYBT6,"This is my favorite Heath Ledger movie he ever did.  It is similar to a standard fantasy tale involving a boy growing up poor, and dreaming big -- until they turn things on their head every now and then (but not in a Mel Brooks sort of way).  For instance, having the herald leading the crowd at the joust in a rousing rendition of Queen's ""We Will Rock You"" was just inspired genius.  They don't break the fantasy illusion too much, and they don't break the 4th wall (as Mel Brooks likes to do), they just sprinkle in a bit of surreal every now and then, to keep you surprised.

The basic story is based loosely on ""The Canterbury Tales,"" and ""the story of Ulrich von Lichtenstein"" (according to IMDB).  In it, William (Heath), a poor thatcher's son whose father sacrificed as much as he could to get his son apprenticed to a knight as a squire, in the hopes that the boy could rise above the station he was born into and ""change his stars."" William, unfortunately faces the death of his knight in the middle of a tournament, which means the end of his days pursuing higher station, respect, money and glory.  He decides to impersonate his dead master at the first event -- and he wins.  He then convinces his friends to help him continue to compete.  To do so, he creates a false identity for subsequent events (to prove he is a noble, since only nobles are allowed to compete), with the help of the charming (and often nude due to literally losing everything gambling) Chaucer, played by Paul Bettany (yes, THAT Chaucer is implied who he is).  With the help of his female friend who wants to be taken as a serious blacksmith (Laura Fraser as Kate) and his fellow squires who are in on the deal, Roland (Mark Addy) and Wat (Alan Tudyk), they end up going on a grand adventure.

Rufus Sewell plays a delicious bad guy by the name of Count Adhemar whom we love to hate, and Shannyn Sossamon plays a believable love interest for William named Jocelyn.  Her interactions with Wat are comedy gold, as well.  Spawning such famous lines as, ""it's called a lance, hellooooo"" and, ""betray us, and I will fong you, until your insides are out, your outsides are in, your entrails will become your entrails I will w-rip... all the p... ung. Pain, lots of pain. "" (quotes from IMDB)

The ending is poignant and moving with the Black Prince Edward helping to set the stage for the final showdown between William and Count Adhemar.  Watch it.  You'll like it if you like good movies.",1282089600,,2470,4.4699331848552335

2657212,4,B000IHYBT6,"This 2001 film is just plain fun.  Filmed in the Czech Republic, the story is set in the 1400s in England.  Heath Ledger is cast as low-born serf who impersonates a knight and wins jousting matches, eventually winning over the villain and getting the beautiful noble-born woman.  This is not a film to take seriously, especially since the sound track includes a whole bunch of modern rock pieces - ""We are the Champions:"", ""We Will Rock You"", ""Taking Care of Business"", etc.  I sometimes laughed out loud at this silly film but I must say I enjoyed it.

All the actors did a good job, playing their roles with a sense of whimsy. Paul Bethany is cast in the role of Chaucer and the whole film is based very very loosely on one of his Canterbury Tales. I particularly thought that Rufus Sewell, cast in the role of the villain nobleman was excellent as well as James Purfoy who I remembered from his role as Brutus in the TV series ""Rome"".  Both of these gentleman seemed more like real men than the blond haired slim Heath Ledger but I think the casting was perfect.

2657214,4,B000IHYBT6,"I won't go into great detail about how the movie mixes anachronistic elements into medieval times (most notably the modern day music), except to say that the creators of the movie did these things for deliberate effect.  Even knowing it was deliberately done for a logical reason doesn't mean that the movie would necessarily turn out to be good... yet it is very good.

The story is pretty basic and there really are absolutely no surprises in the plot along the way.  What saves it from being boring is a great cast, good pacing, some very clever banter, exciting joust scenes and some genuinely emotional scenes near the end.

The one element that drags the movie down a touch for me is the love sub-plot.  I definitely think the film creators should have gone against convention and had William and Kate get together instead as the scenes between William and Jocelyn seemed to have little chemistry and generally had me waiting for the next scene to begin.

However, this movie is one which I almost invariably set on my 'favorites' channel list if I see it on, to switch to during commercials of anything else I'm watching, or sometimes just to watch straight through, for no other reason than it's FUN.

There are some truly excellently shot and acted scenes, a few of which I'll mention below (spoilers!!!!)

- Geoffrey's nude scene after literally losing his shirt in gambling, and relying on William to bail him out.  The expressions of terrified hope, resignment and relief on Geoffrey's face are perfect.

- Any scene with Prince Edward in it.  I really liked the aftermath of the joust between William and Edward and their discussion, plus the whole scene where Edward 'rescues' William later.

- The scenes between William and his father, particularly the reunion... even the subtle thing of William looking at the stairs he hadn't seen since he was a child was very well done and somehow immediately made me realize what I think the film creators wanted the audience to feel.

- The thin, grey haired noble in the opening 'musical' scene mouthing 'Rock You...'.

- The shot of William in the final joust, armor-less, white shirted, lance lashed to his arm is simply one of the most breathtaking images in film.",1262736000,,2224,4.772845953002611

Of course, he turned out to be much more than a handsome face and if I'd bothered to see this film I would have known it then.  Not only does he give a charismatic and compelling early performance, the film itself is a lot of fun: a very clever and entertaining update of the old knight in shining armor swashbuckling saga, that turns it into a comical version of the classic sports success story, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocky/dp/B0006GAO5Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocky</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Karate-Kid/dp/B0008JIJ2E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Karate Kid</a>.

2657220,4,B000IHYBT6,"As always, Ledger shines. He plays the role of William Thatcher; a peasant who earns the title of a Knight.  Subtlety disguised amidst all the semi funny movie scenes, is a message of love, friendship and loyalty. Today, as rarely as these values are displayed, it is satisfyingly refreshing to at least dream of them.
In one of the final scenes, Thatcher says: ""My pride is the only thing that they can't take from me"", which most of us can relate to. It turns out that he has true, loyal friends, and true love, which is an anachronism in today's world, but why not dream?

So much powerful armor they wear all over their bodies, so awesome.

I like simple, honest movies such as these.  The movie is about the dangerous sport of jousting, and mostly takes place around the arena, near castles, and sometimes in the woods.  I like these kind of settings because it allows you to appreciate small and simple surroundings.

There were a few hard to understand moments in the film when the English slang became an issue.  I had trouble understanding a lot of things the characters were saying to each other.  I couldn't make out the words.

Still, I easily got the point of the movie.

Movies like A Knight's Tale last a lifetime to be honest.  Seriously, a movie like this holds up exceptionally well over the years.  Incredible acting skills by ALL the characters, I highly recommend this one.

The one thing that confused me above everything else though, is WHY in the world were classic rock songs by artists such as Queen, David Bowie, War, and Bachman Turner Overdrive playing?  I'm pretty sure people in England weren't speeding down the road years ago cranking up and partying to BTO classics!  Rock on baby.

Oh... AHEM, where was I?  Oh yes, A Knight's Tale is a classic movie and perfect entertainment for just about everyone.  A simple concept delivers and the movie is phenomenal as a result.",1250640000,,1578,4.714285714285714
2657224,3,B000IHYBT6,"This movie now takes on a little more importance as it is another reminder of the late Heath Ledger, who stars in it.

 It's a story about jousting but this old knight's tale is anything but old because it mixes in satire of today's modern sports-audience age with some funny comedy  bits. Those include the overly dramatic public address announcer (boy, that's even more so since this film came out), rock music blaring out as the contestants do battle, the ""wave,""  etc.

The main characters are nicely varied with distinct personalities. Shannon Sossamon, however, was not quite up to leading-lady status and hasn't had a choice role like this since, either. I would have rather seen her ""assistant"" in this film, or the blacksmith woman, be the lead. Anyway, even though it's a bit long at 132 minutes, it's still entertaining most of the way and it's just as much a romance as a comedy.",1246752000,,891,4.72258064516129

2657235,1,B000IHYBT6,"In ""A Knight's Tale"" (2001) director Brian Helgeland has attempted to transport the Medieval world of jousting into a modernized context that a 21st century audience will recognize and understand.  For a post-literate, modern Western culture the complexities of Western medieval society and culture and, more specifically, the joust, make Helgeland's efforts daring, almost fool-hardy.  Yet, initially, Helgeland appears up to the mark.  He appropriately portrays jousting as the sporting event of Western medieval society.  Not that there were not other equally popular sports (e.g. hunting; wrestling and boxing; horse racing; football (soccer); lacrosse and hockey; tennis), but there are few correlations between 21st century Western sporting events and the panoply of the medieval joust.  Attempting to bridge the historical gap between that world and modern society, Helgeland adopted the symbolism of the modern-day arena.  Fans are boistrous, beer guzzlers, with an exuberant few foregoing shirts and painting their faces.  Instead of the medieval fanfare with its archaic styles and melodies, Helgeland supplies a more comforting musical style for his audience - 20th century rock music - which sets the stage for the mock-combat about to take place.  Modern catcalls and insults used by the secondary cast put the screen-side audience at ease, supplanting the foreign gestures and period insults that would likely only confuse viewers.  Finally, the complexities of the joust are conveniently minimized to the requirement to be a noble-born knight and the scoring of points by either breaking a lance or unhorsing an opponent.  Helgeland arguably does a good job of trying to modernize the jousting tourney to modern sensibilities; however, his modern tale fails in several ways.

Following the all-too-familiar Hollywood model, Helgeland's medieval Church is portrayed as greedy, oppressive, insensitive, manipulative, and power-crazed.  Priests are caricatured as either benign fools or malignant misers.  In the film the Church plays no important role in the cause of the protagonist, except as a critic of his behavior (e.g. when the protagonist brings his horse into the sanctuary; when he interrupts a worship service with his conversations).  Further, the Church has no important role in the spiritual guidance of the protagonist - or anyone else for that matter.  Finally, the desecration of Church property and disturbance of clerical services are not viewed with an understanding of the higher principles of property ownership, divine authority, and worship, but are awkwardly used to humiliate the protagonist, browbeat the clergy, and vilify the antagonist.

Another victim of Helgeland's plot is the Bible.  Biblical accounts are typecast as weird tales, whose meaning is - at best - cryptic.  In order to handle the unexplained meaning of biblical passages, the protagonist chooses to make up his own ""better"" story that simply spirals into a meaningless spiritualism as a way to woo a woman to bed.  To make matters worse, the Biblical passages that are used are historical and taken completely out of context, so that the protagonist can butcher and force them into his horrible love poetry.  This is quite sad given that actual, quite racy, love poetry abounds in the Song of Solomon.

A third casualty in Helgeland's film is Christian chivalry.  Historically, chivalry was a moral virtue taught by the patriarchal leadership of Western feudal society and the Church.  The Church passed many laws that encouraged chivalric behavior and that defined chivalry as a Christian virtue.  Thus, to be chivalrous meant one was a Christian knight.  In the film, however, Helgeland has created a moral training vacuum through the combined emasculation of the protagonist's father and the Church and the removal of the protagonist's liege.  This vacuum forced Helgeland to invent his own code of conduct for his protagonist.  Helgeland's ""chivalry"" begins in the spirit of the 19th and 20th century romantic novel, where martial skills and ability, in this case skill with a lance, proves more important than chivalric virtue and the purity of Christian knighthood.  As the film progresses, this romantic machismo is eventually replaced by a modern feminism that denies the need for chivalric knights, while at the same time, demands that knights somehow be good.  As a result, Christianity and knighthood are falsely portrayed as opposites in the story, and chivalry is torn from its historical foundation and twisted into a revisionist mold that distorts and nullifies its meaning and value.

Finally, Feudalistic society as a whole is viewed through a distorted modernist lens.  Lords are categorically attacked for levying harsh taxes and are criticized for have a lifestyle of oppressive opulence.  In contrast, commoners are praised for being hard workers who - anachronistically - pursue the American Dream, whereby anyone can change his destiny.  Patriarchal leadership, an important feature of Western feudal society, is seen as unimportant and an obstacle for the youth who seeks success.  Likewise, marriage for love is given heavy countenance instead of the more period-correct parental-approved or arranged marriages.  By their sheer absence, these parental-condoned covenants are silently attacked as being loveless arrangements that promote male dominance and are an anathema to a productive Western society.

Thus, despite his best efforts, Helgeland's ""A Knight's Tale"" proves to be a failure.  Rather than the Middle Ages being transported into a modern-day context, Helgeland's 21st century convictions only allow him to present a story that has far more in common with ""The Fast and the Furious"" (2001) than it does with the medieval Christian knight.  Those with an interest in medieval Christian chivalry and the world of jousting should consider the following:

2657242,4,B000IHYBT6,"""A Knight's Tale"" was delightful to me when I saw it in the theatre.  I recently started thinking about how much I liked it and then saw a copy @ a bargain price.  Heath Ledger never seems light, even when in a frothy bit of romantic comedy from the middle ages.  There is a fierce intensity to his work.  His one Oscar nomination came for Best Actor for ""Brokeback Mountain"" in 2005, a film for which he won similar awards from critics' associations in Las Vegas, New York, Phoenix, San Francisco & St. Louis.  As William Thatcher, he is a joy to watch as the servant who dreamed he could become a knight.

Director Brian Helgeland won an Oscar for screenwriting for ""L.A. Confidential"" in 1997 & was similarly nominated for ""Mystic River.""  I found the DVD extras interesting as his explanation of why the rock music that is clearly out of period was used.  His concept tried to make the period easy to relate to for modern audiences and show the energy from those times as if they were happening today.  The dance sequence is still amazing.

Alan Tudyk's flaming red hair looks great on the DVD.  Tudyk came to the screen with ""Patch Adams,"" ""The Wonder Boys"" & with Sandra Bullock in ""28 Days.""  As Wat, he lends great comic timing.  Some of the deleted scenes are priceless as he mugs wildly.  His sidekick Mark Addy who played with Ledger in ""The Order"" as well as his breakout role in ""The Full Monty"" does a good job as the rotund Roland who eagerly helps William in hopes that he will get to see his family again.

Paul Bettany came to the fore in ""A Beautiful Mind"" & as the flagellating albino priest in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Da-Vinci-Code-Widescreen-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00005JOC9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Da Vinci Code (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, but I particularly liked him as a romantic lead in what was a critically slammed film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wimbledon/dp/B0006A9FIM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wimbledon</a>.  As Geoffrey Chaucer, Bettany bares his behind to show the wordsmith with a gambling addiction.  The deleted scene where William, Wat & Roland follow a naked Chaucer only to meet his wife is hilarious.

Shannyn Sossamon was discovered for this role when she was spinning discs for a party.  I've enjoyed her work on TV's ""Moonlight,"" the vampire series.  As Jocelyn, she is lovely and brings kind of a romantic wisdom to the part.  While I've read she's compared frequently to Angelina Jolie, I kept thinking of Keira Knightly as I watched this DVD.  The scene where William follows her on horseback into a church put a smile on my face.

Rufus Sewell is another intense actor.  He had a supporting part in the Jude Law-Cameron Diaz film I liked,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Holiday/dp/B000MQC9H4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Holiday</a>, as well as a major part in the excellent film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Illusionist-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000K7VHQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Illusionist (Widescreen Edition)</a>.  As Count Adehmar, he is as ruthless as he is good looking.  The strength of his arrogance contributes strongly to the making Thatcher such a sympathetic character.

Christopher Cazenove who was in one of my favorite films, ""Eye of the Needle"" from 1981, plays William's father.  The scene is touching where the blind father sits in the stadium as his son knocks Adehmar to his just deserts.  James Purefoy who plays Edward, the Black Prince of Wales, also has an excellent cameo appearance where he rescues William from the stocks.

2657244,2,B000IHYBT6,"For very little kids, or young girls who want to look at Heath Ledger. He died but that didn't improve the film.

History is so boring. It needs to be jazzed up?",1220313600,,161,4.03125
2657245,5,B000IHYBT6,"Sometime in the early 1370s, six months in the life of English writer Geoffrey Chaucer went unaccounted. A KNIGHT'S TALE - an earnest, historical epic movie (okay, not really) - ventures a tongue-in-cheek answer to that mild conundrum. But, firstly, the film gravitates towards the young peasant squire, William Thatcher, who fears of wasting his life away as a humble nothing. When his knight is fatally injured during a joust, William seizes an opening for self-betterment. With the help of his reluctant fellow squires, he passes himself off as a nobleman, intending to compete in knightly tournaments. But William must first qualify by presenting patents of nobility, which list his noble lineage.

Which is where Geoffrey Chaucer comes in, naked in bodily form but not in spirits. Chaucer gets William, now callling himself Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein of Gelderland, that much closer to achieving his objective, being able to forge the necessary patents and acting as Sir Ulrich's herald. As tournament follows tournament, Sir Ulrich proves to be mighty in prowess and very popular with the masses. But he may have set too lofty a goal when he dares to fall in love with the nobleman's high-spirited, beauteous daughter, Lady Jocelyn. And, ultimately, Sir Ulrich's dreams of love and a better life may rest on his ability to best the grim and haughty Count Adhemar, he of the black heart and baleful gaze, who is a tournament champion and a rival for Jocelyn's fancy...

This film is definitely a far cry from one of those tired medieval epics. A KNIGHT'S TALE is a rousing, high spirited adventure, bolstered by a perfect cast, an immensely relatable underdog story, a sexy romance, and friggin' classic rock music. As director Brian Helgeland confesses facetiously in his audio commentary with Paul Bettany, he was not aware that rock & roll did not exist back in the 1370s. But, believe or no, this anachronism serves the movie well. One of the early scenes involves the tournament crowd getting amped up with Queen's ""We Will Rock You."" This right away lends an amazing energy to the screen and gives notice to the movie audience that this one film isn't quite like any other. Other classic rock tunes pepper the film, with David Bowie's ""Golden Years"" being seamlessly cued in the dance sequence; there's a sense of exhilaration and sensuality to Jocelyn and Sir Ulrich getting jiggy on the floor. What the music does, other than setting a desired mood, is lend a refreshing contemporary feel to the film. I really dug those moments, historical inaccuracies be damned.

Speaking of historical inaccuracies, you don't really think this is where the Nike swooosh logo originated, do you? Or sports fan face painting?

""I give to you the seeker of serenity, the protector of Italian virginity, and the enforcer of Our Lord God, the one, the only - Sir Uuullrich von Lichtenstein!!"" I have to admit that my favorite actor here is Paul Bettany, who plays Geoffrey Chaucer. From the moment Bettany makes his very startling onscreen appearance, he begins to steal scenes left and right. He's even more brilliant when he takes on the role of Sir Ulrich's herald and begins to rev up the tournament crowds with his ringing, bombastic introductions of his liege. I'm such a big fan of this dude.

Not to neglect the rest of the cast. The lead is the late, very much missed Heath Ledger and, at this stage in his career, he was well on his way to attaining bankable leading man status. His very engaging performance in A KNIGHT'S TALE definitely put him on that level. William Thatcher, handsome and bold, appeals to every gent with ambition and, I'm guessing, to every girl out there who has the ability to swoon. His retinue of friends and ""servants"" are perfect, simply perfect: Mark Addy, the calm and sense in the maelstrom; Alan Tudyk, fiery tempered and eager to administer vicious fongings (to fong = to kick); Laura Fraser as the lovely and spunky Kate the farrier; and, of course, the golden-voiced Paul Bettany.

Shannyn Sossamon makes her promising big screen debut and is luminous as the moon, unveiling a hint of sass and more than a hint of the sexy. Her chemistry with Ledger is a smoldering thing. The sad thing for her career is that not in any of her following films has she been as good as she was here. Maybe that'll change. And what's an adventure movie without a good adversary? Rufus Sewell as Count Adhemar oozes priveleged arrogance, dark jealousy and sinister thoughts. Is there any doubt that the dastardly Count Adhemar wouldn't hesitate to get medieval on William's, er, backside (but not in the same way as in PULP FICTION)? He surely deserves his flustered herald's awkward introduction of him.

Do yourself a favor and also check out the juuuust a bit tongue-in-cheek audio commentary by director Brian Helgeland and Paul Bettany. They'll fill you in on trivia such as which actor was voted sexiest by the females of the cast and crew, how Bettany managed to not show the fella when in *that* scene, which actor is projected by the commentators to be the next James Bond, which actor's parties have become the stuff of legends during the filming, and who ended up purchasing Sir Ulrich's Kate-created armor.

I've seen A KNIGHT'S TALE a busload of times, and it's yet to wane in appeal and watchability. You wouldn't think that a collision of Queen and Chaucer (to quote Helgeland) would work. But it does, and tremendously, thanks to the actors who create and inhabit fully realized characters. The sheer exuberance of this film blows me away, and the underdog premise makes me root for William's motley crew time and again. If you haven't seen A KNIGHT'S TALE yet, well, frankly, I'm a bit envious. But what are you waiting for? A fonging?",1218931200,,5773,4.8419452887537995

2657247,5,B000IHYBT6,"Well ... a good seven years has now passed since this film was in the theatres and it holds up just as fine as it did the very first time I saw it.

The Reception ...

The first and most striking aspect of this film was the amount of antipathy that was generated by Carter Burwell's insightful use of modern music in a period comedy /drama. Unfortunately this created so much backlash, and so much hatred amongst the viewers that hordes of haters flocked to the internet to post hundreds of pages of comments on IMDb, and post an unflattering number of continuous negative reviews on Amazon for years to come with a long sea of comments regarding the `egregiousness' of what this film did to the period. None of the `paid, real-life' Reviewers were any kinder to writer / director Brian Helgeland as well and just about every reviewer couldn't tolerate the opening of peasants drumming away and singing `We Will Rock You' or Heath Ledger practicing his technique to War's `Lowrider'. So many viewers would have a better understanding and greater perspective on stuff like this if they would just acquaint themselves with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/work/dp/B000777I88/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">work</a>&nbsp;of Tom Stoppard. His work in the field of Victorian and Middle-age shenanigans has made absurdist theatre what it is today and has shaped a lot of modern film.

""It's called a lance, hello ...""

The Controversy ...

Some people may remember that the negative reviews were so many, that some bright spark over at Sony Pictures decided to start fabricating positive reviews and using quotes for those fake reviews to advertise the film. Well, someone noticed and caught them with their proverbial hand in the cookie jar. Yes, there was a lawsuit and someone got paid. Whoever that was, is beyond me because I never saw a dime of that money and I saw it twice in the theatre and I've purchased both versions available on DVD.

For almost five years, someone also hosted a phony website that was made to emulate an Anchorage area High School up in Alaska, which regarded a supposed Musical adaptation of `A Knights Tale', replete with fake newspaper reviews, fake still photographs and other phony productions also complete with posters, banners and photographs. The website was taken down in 2006 after it was finally discovered by Sony Pictures and they didn't find the joke very funny at all.

The Writer / Director and Shannyn Sossamon ...

A lot of people, who were in charge of production and had financially backed the picture were ecstatic to be working with prolific Writer / Director Brian Helgeland, who had previously had much success with the magnificent film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/L-A-Confidential/dp/0790734850/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">L.A. Confidential</a>. Whether one likes that movie or not, it surely is a screenplay to rival all others in scope and skill. No dailies were made available during filming as principal photography took place in the Czech Republic, but nobody seemed to mind as they were all fully behind Helgeland's ""period epic"" that would be a sort-of screen adaptation of Geoffrey Chaucer's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Canterbury-Tales/dp/0140424385/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Canterbury Tales</a>. There must have been an incredible silence during the first few screenings when they finally got to see the finished product. The problem was that even though the marketing campaign for the film was vast and appropriate, too much negative banter behind the scenes got the ball rolling on all the bad reviews. But in truth, it still did pretty good in the theatres and very well once released on DVD, both times. To this day, a lot of people adore this film and it's quickly becoming a real cult-classic and not the kind of cult-classic that Studios likes to advertise their poorly made films like Superbad as. A Knights Tale really is a cult-classic, that status is not something placed upon it by the Studios, but attributed to it by the fans and the continued viewership.

Unfortunately though for Helgeland, his career as a director hasn't ever really improved, has it? He's seemingly stuck forever with his Cirque du Freak vampire movie that no one has yet seen a frame of. His writing though hasn't suffered as he's penned numerous hits that have been critically acclaimed such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mystic-River/dp/B0001ZX0OW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mystic River</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Man-on-Fire/dp/B00005JN0W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Man on Fire</a>. He was also a guest commentator on the recent DVD re-release of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Omen/dp/B000HCO86I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Omen</a>&nbsp;alongside Richard Donner.

And then there was Shannyn Sossamon. A nice young girl who went out for general auditions for this film, and who at the time was working as a (gasp!) Stripper in a Los Angeles area all-nude Strip Club. I promise you this ... I never met her. In the commentary, Helgeland makes mention of this and jokes that he intentionally put her name in the opening credits superimposed over a young-girl dancing because of that fact. It was a bit harsh, I thought and I couldn't help but detect some jilted emotion in his voice as well. She also shows up as the object of the writer's affection in the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Order/dp/B0000TPA0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Order</a>, with a few other members of this cast in a story that is just overwrought with the pangs of deprized love and has a serious undercurrent of a Sossamon infatuation.

So I guess, Helgeland truly has been weighed, measured and found wanting as a director. The future is all his though. Hopefully, whatever he does next will be openly accepted, even if it is another&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Knight-s-Tale/dp/B00000F4ZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Knight's Tale</a>.

Heath Ledger ...

For years on Amazon, the bulk of recent reviews for A Knights Tale were all negative as I stated before, and there was a lot of conversation about the historical accuracy. Now that Heath has passed, I guess it's only appropriate that all that is now in the past and people now post reviews saying how much they loved him and what an impact as an actor he made on film and their lives. It's fine and probably well-deserved. He was taken too early through working himself into an exhaustion and getting caught in a spiraling set of circumstances that went out of control.

I probably owe Heath a debt of gratitude as for a period of time, I was often mistaken for him in public. Being a Los Angeles area resident, it did get me a few girls during the late night outings. But trust me, no one ever believed fully that I was him. The timing was good too, as it was a dark period for me and I needed everything I could get back then just to keep going. So, posthumously ... thanks, Heath. I owe ya one, mate.

His performance in this film quite good, and full of life and hopefully this is how people will remember him as I feel it was one of his most enjoyable roles in film. The Joker will probably be seen as equally good even though the polar opposite in emotion and intensity.

Alan Tudyk and the rest of cast ...

It was this film that introduced me to the American Actor Alan Tudyk. A native of Plano, Texas whose acting is so good, could get himself cast in a film with a fake accent and do a more than passable job as an Englishman named Wot Falhurst. Great name, by the way.

A story about `Geoff' Chaucer is intriguing enough by itself.

""I will eviscerate you in fiction. I was naked for a day, you will be naked for eternity.""

A much-overlooked, but incredibly well-written piece of cinema. Anyone who could write something like that, does not need a lecture on historical accuracy. Lots of films and movies are made about historical figures, but the most shameful thing that is too-often done -- is the dialogue that is placed in their mouths. It is often out-of-place, inaccurate, buffoonish and abysmal. Helgeland wrote so many incredibly moving, witty and interesting lines for Geoffrey Chaucer that would make one think that he will one day revisit the character and give him the honor of a feature length film, or at least a screenplay. Paul Bettany's performance with the line ...

""Lillium Interspinus ... the Lilly among the thorns.""

Is a fantastic piece of impromptu acting and a great introduction during the film.

As for Rufus Sewell, a lot of people used to associate him with the cult sci-fi masterpiece Dark City, now I can't look at him without thinking of his role as Adhemar of Anjou and that scowling cock-eyed look of his. You'd be cock-eyed too, if you boozed it up and partied as heavily and heartily as this guy did. My God, he was a Hollywood legend for years at after parties, wrap-parties, clubs, you name it. His reputation as an animal far outweighed his reputation as an actor.

A historical note ...

Yeah, too many other reviewers make mention of the dates, the Black Prince, the real Ulrich of Gelderland and on and on. A long list of accusations is still up for the reading over at IMDb if anyone is interested. If you're really interested in why a lot of this was done, then just listen to the commentary on the DVD with Paul Bettany and Brian Helgeland and you learn more about this film, and be the better for it.

2657253,5,B000IHYBT6,"I was there when this movie came out and I vividly remember being in an empty theater. This movie was an instant cult classic same as the 13th Warrior and the 9th Gate. But I disagree on an earlier comment that the extended DVD is not worth it, untrue. Just my 2 cents.

I also recall watching this movie many times when I was feeling down. It was like going on an adventure and the extended edition only made that adventure last that much longer. In the movie the Patriot with Mel Gibson, Heath was excellent but then again, I also loved him in Roar. He was a star from the get go and was probably heading for even greater stardom as the older action stars are slowly exiting stage left, the newer guys are and were moving up, like Heath. It is sad what happened to him. I guess he didn't know himself and his body as well as he thought he did. Drinking, getting high, has it's limits and when you reach those limits, something in you knows exactly what you're doing. In the end, some people cross that line and some don't. I only wish someone was with him and that he wasn't alone, perhaps then he might have been with us today.
I personally will continue to watch A Knights Tale until I too exit this great planet. There's nothing to be gained from this except pure enjoyment.
**//** - UPDATE:
And now Charlton Heston has left us. These are truly sad times as we've lost a great resource, period. It's also sadly a reminder of our own mortality. I mean Heath was not a natural thing and so is treated differently but Charlton lived a long and fruitful life and died of old age with complications. Time goes by so fast. I wish the younger crowd took this into consideration every time they go out partying like it's 1999.
God bless you Heath and Charlton, may you both rest in peace.",1207785600,,1785,4.3125
2657254,4,B000IHYBT6,"Yes, it's really strange that Heath is gone - such a talent and his best work was ahead of him. In A Knights Tale some of his talent will remain for people to see infinitely.
 First off, this isn't one of the better looking bluray transfers. Part of the reason is because it's not exactly a ""new"" movie. Don't get me wrong, it looks good. It's bluray. I'm just saying it doesn't hold up when compared to a newer bluray movie.
 It's a great comedy that modernizes one of the old English Canterburry Tales. There were several of these short stories compiled into one. This is just one of those tales. It's a great flick with talent pouring out over the sides. There are some recognizable faces throughout. It's just one of those good heartfelt movies that makes your heart swell. A great family movie. It holds up with the whole ""I laughed, I cried"" banner. It's got everything.
 Now, to talk about the dissapointment: NO SPECIAL FEATURES!!!
Yep, that's right. They couldn't even throw in one measly special feature!
And there is plenty of special features on the standard def version of the film, so why no love for bluray? I am a little steamed about this considering that the SD and bluray editions look exactly the same. It's the same edition only you get more on SD.
 So, I kind of have to recommend the SD version because this bluray movie doesn't look spectacular. I mean, buying this movie won't justify your bluray player. But, if you are like me and now want everything on bluray then this is for you. Plus, who says you can't own both?",1207699200,,1544,4.503571428571429

2657265,4,B000IHYBT6,"It's not irony, that just tonight I was going to do a review on A Knight's Tale. It saddens me that so many movie goers never really got his films, or often talked about them as trivial and unimportant. I found his roles ripe, fresh and full of vigor and controversy. Roles that spanned the epic The Patriot, to Lords of Dogtown and The Ten Things I hate about you; as well as the endearing and touching Brokeback Mountain. We were just getting a soft whisper of a voice yet unheard, that was only beginning to shout to the world how a champion would be born.

What could have been, like River, we shall never know, but I think I speak for a majority of movie lovers, who will appreciate his work until our own passing, and give condolences to his family, his friends, his daughter, and the countless lives he touched with his amazing and powerful roles, and the jaded ways of our world, and our lives in it, and why and how a young life can be so suddently taken from us, before it has a chance to really shine and set afire the world of cinema.

His wit and charm and smiles in A Knight's Tale, made it easy to like him, and root him on. Its hard to do a period piece, with humor and sincerity, while rocking a music selection that others would find abruptly unsuitable. But it worked for moi.

Rest In Peace Young Man.

2657267,3,B000IHYBT6,"Overall not that bad of a flick, but to me, as with others, the intrusion of the modern music really hurt this film. Still it's nice to see an American movie from this current decade set in the past, and the scene in which the camera flew over a panoramic fourteenth-century London was worth an Amazon star in and of itself. Heath Ledger is likable here as everywhere, and the sub-story of Geoffrey Chaucer's pseudo-inspiration for his own Knight's Tale added some much needed grounding to what might otherwise have been way too free-flying a production.",1198972800,,554,4.78125
2657268,3,B000IHYBT6,"Recently, I purchased the Special Edition of this DVD.  I saw the film at a friend's house several years ago and enjoyed it.  If you are like me, you will enjoy good dialogue and lines that come back from a previous reference to have some relevance at the end of the film.

Earlier in the film, Adhemar (William's foil) says something after defeating William in a jousting match.  In the version I saw with my friend, a variation of that line is repeated at the end of the film -- to me it was the payoff line or lines.  It helped wrap us the film nicely.

However, in the version I purchased (the special edition), that line was NOT there.  I also have seen this film several times on television and the line is also missing from the broadcast version.

If you have never seen the film, you probably wouldn't mind this deletion -- however, if you are like me, and enjoy great lines -- this will be a major disappointment.

Overall, as others have stated, it is fun film to watch, some good laughs, and some anachronistic music and mannerisms.

It's a bit of a stretch that William and his companions serendipitously end up in the company of one Geoffrey Chaucer, who forges documents and acts as William's herald; but this part is done well.  The real treat of the film however, is to see the talented James Purefoy as Edward, the Black Prince, who has also been hiding the origins of his birth to compete in the exciting jousting tournaments.

The actors display human foibles and strengths, such as poor choices and loyalty, all truthfully.

2657278,4,B000IHYBT6,"Here is my disclaimer - DON'T TAKE THIS MOVIE SERIOUSLY.  I have to admit, when I first saw A Knight's Tale, at first I was a bit put off by the glaring historical inaccuracies and rock music.  That is I was until I saw the scene where the herald, Geoffrey Chaucer (Paul Bettany), is getting the crowd fired up prior to a match and it all made perfect sense - Jousting as PRO WRESTLING!  What the director and writers have done is a satire, putting the features and passion of pro wrestling (and other fan favorite sports like football) into a medieval setting.

Not to completely rehash the plot, the story is a basic, Horatio Alger rags to riches story.  William (Hugh Ledger) is a commoner serving as page for Sir Hector, an aging knight who dies of a heart attack during the course of a tournament.  Out of funds, William dons Sir Hector's armor and finishes the tournament.  This victory inspires William to try to make a living impersonating a knight.  He convinces Sir Hector's other pages, Roland (Mark Addy) and Wat (Alan Tudyk), to join him and with practice, they become successful on the ""Jousting circuit"" with William creation, ""Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein.""  Along the way, William defeats the heavy, Count Adhemar (Rufus Sewell), gets the girl (Jocelyn - played by Shannyn Sossamon), and wins the Jousting Championship.

The dialogue is average (although Bellamy shines in the role of the herald) and the directing is adequate (I did like the shots of the jousting) but the real fun in this film is the satire and the music.  The musical selection, such as ""Golden Years"" by David Bowie for the dancing scene or the choice of ""The Boys are Back in Town"" by (Irish) band ""Thin Lizzy"" for the return to London scene really capture the spirit of the action on the screen.  Other details such as the Nike ""Swoosh"" on the armor just add to the ""don't take this too seriously"" tone.

I suppose from looking at what others have written, this is a love it or hate it film.  I think I got the joke and once I started looking at it from that perspective, found the movie very entertaining.",1182556800,,2095,4.581769436997319

2657294,4,B000IHYBT6,"This highly enjoyable, fairy tale of a film revolves around the efforts of William, a tanner's son, trying to change his destiny. His father gave him up into servitude to a knight, when William was a slip of a lad, in hopes of his having a better future. When he grows up, William, remembering his father's advice, reaches for the stars in an effort to become what he has always dreamed of being, a knight in shining armor.

Played to perfection by the very hunky and charismatic Heath Ledger, William gets his big break when the knight, whom he serves, dies during a jousting competition. Donning his knight's armor and substituting secretly for the knight, he handily, though clumsily, wins the competition and its purse. He persuades Roland and Wat, the other two vassals who also served the now dead knight, to assist him in his efforts to continue competing. They reluctantly agree and begin helping him train for future jousting competitions. William, however, needs credentials establishing his knighthood in order to compete, as mere peasants are prohibited to do so. He has the good fortune to run into a man of letters, Geoffrey Chaucer, who happens to be a bit down on his luck. Chaucer agrees to provide him with forged patents in order to enter tournaments.

William, playing the role of a knight named Ulric Von Lichtenstein, becomes a force with which to be reckoned on the playing field. This does not pass unnoticed by an evil knight, Count Adhemar, played with deliciously wicked malice by Rufus Sewell, who does not hesitate to play dirty on and off the field, if necessary, in order to win. William, however, plays his role most honorably and nobly.

William falls in love with the Lady Jocelyn, whom Sewell also covets and intends to marry, but Lady Jocelyn, played by lovely newcomer, Shannyn Sossamon, may be falling for our erstwhile hero. This turn of events makes Count Adhemar all the more determined to win on and off the field. When a jousting competition brings them all to William's hometown, Adhemar pulls out all the stops in an effort to settle the matter once and for all.

This is truly a fun film. The viewer can't help but love the ever so earnest William, played by the simpatico and romantically handsome Heath Ledger. Paul Bettany, as the insouciant and scampish Chaucer, very nearly steals the film, so terrific is he in his role. Rufus Sewell is both sexy and ruthless as the unprincipled and haughty Count Adhemar. The rest of the supporting cast is likewise superb, with the exception of Shannyn Sossamon who does not seem fit the role of one to the manor born.

While the plot seems somewhat formulaic, it is made new by the interjection of modern day music and customs. Watch as the crowd gathered for the jousting competition stomps, claps, and does the ""wave"" in time to Queen's rousing song, ""We Will Rock You"". See Chaucer act as a modern day huckster for his knight, working the crowd to a fever pitch. Look to the dance led by William at a post jousting reception at the local castle. Likewise, Jocelyn's costumes, at times, resemble haute couture. These modern day interjections that occur throughout the film, though jarring, keep this age old story fresh and funny.

He travels with friends -- two fellow squires, a woman blacksmith, and ""Chaucer"".  He falls in love with a noble young woman and has a nasty adversary who wants to skewer him.  The choice of music [rock and roll] is a bit jarring when first encountered and some of the costumes etc are definitely out of period, but you'll get over that.  Listening to the commentary will help you understand why various choices were made to use modern vs old, if you find it troublesome.

The story itself is a classic, definitely medieval, but the hero's troubles are fully comprehensible and relevant to modern audiences.  The tournament sequences are great.  Unlike so many films in which knights wear ""armor"" that is obviously for decoration only, the knights in this film race actual horses at each other across a field and get whacked with actual lances.  So the armor does take a real thump.  It and the jousting technique are pretty much accurate to period.  The jousting is very well filmed and totally believable - a great combination of scary and wonderful.  The dialogue is generally well written and well acted, the characters are all well developed and multi-dimensional.  This film has under-appreciated early performances by Heath Ledger, Paul Bettany, and good work by everyone else.

When their boss dies unexpectedly William and his two friends who also worked for the knight find themselves with no money and at first they do not know what do to. Then William comes up with an interesting idea. He would pretend to be a noble (Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein of Gelderland) and with the help of Geoffrey Chaucer played hilariously by Paul Bettany he would become a Knight.

William learns how to be a knight and slowly but surly he starts winning. During the rounds of jousting he meets Lady Jocelyn and they fall in love. Unfortunately a man named Count Adhemar tries to find out who Sir Ulrich really is.

2657309,4,B000IHYBT6,"What happens when you cross a medieval story, with a few historical characters, and modern day rock songs?  Well, who knows what you'll get everytime, but I do know that in this instance you are treated to the stylish, exciting, fun-loving action adventurer ""A Knight's Tale"".  Featuring some of Hollywood's hottest new talents, such as, Heath Ledger (""The Patriot"" and ""The Order""), Paul Bettany (""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""Firewall""), Shannyn Sossamon (""The Order"" and ""Rules of Attraction""), and the always evil and engaging Rufus Sewell (""Dark City"" and ""The Legend of Zorro""), this movie, though met with much skepticism due to its blending of things old and new, when handled by such an acclaimed director, Brian Helgeland (""Payback"") was guaranteed to at least be entertaining, if not a sure fire hit.

""A Knight's Tale"" is the story of young William Thatcher (Heath Ledger), a peasant squire who breaks a long-standing tradition when he passes himself off as a noble in order to joust.  With the help of his friends, and a loud-mouthed announcer named Chaucer (Paul Bettany), William is determined to prove to the world that you don't have to come from nobility to achieve greatness.  As he climbs the ranks of the jousting world, one man stands in William's way of achieving his goal, that man is Count Adhemar (Rufus Sewell).  Not only is Count Adhemar the best jouster, and one that is determined to do whatever it takes to win, but he also has set his sights on William's new girlfriend (Shannyn Sossamon).  With the world on his shoulders, Williams must go head-to-head in a no-holds-barred joust with his arch-rival to see who will be the world champion jouster, and to prove to all, that any man can have what it takes to be a knight.

The story of ""A Knight's Tale"" may sound like a standard run of the mill action/adventure movie, except set in medieval times, but the well-written characters being fleshed out by the terrific actors brings the entire proceeding up to a much higher level.  I must admit that the prospect of mixing modern day anthemic rock ballads with jousting didn't seem like a great fit, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised and hearing Queen's timeless classic `We Will Rock You' during a joust, makes you want to join in with the cheering crowds.  The jousting scenes are truly exciting to watch, and the witty, hilarious introductions by Paul Bettany's character Chaucer (supposedly the famous writer) are perfect lead-ins for getting both the crowd on film and the movie-going audience charged up and ready to go.  All of these elements are pieced together perfectly by director Brian Helgeland, who balances his previous work on ""Payback"" with Mel Gibson, a film that was extremely dark and violent, with this more upbeat, family-oriented action/adventure.

The film never lets up on the excitement level, though I don't mean to make the movie sound like it's one big action sequence, it has plenty of dramatic moments that propel the storyline, yet even in these quieter moments there is still a sense of drive and excitement for the audience and the characters to feed off of.  Though the movie is unorthodox in its blending of time periods, it is still a movie that is a must-see!

""A Knight's Tale"" is rated PG-13 for violence, brief language, and sensuality.",1140739200,,3311,4.868327402135232
2657310,5,B000IHYBT6,"My 78 year old father who has quite the gentle, romantic side but is also a WWII paratrooper absolutely raves about this movie to anyone who will listen. It's filled with danger, chivalry, romance, sacrifice, loyalty against all odds, and much good vs. bad/knights- in-shining-armor action.  Highly enjoyable story of a small town boy overcomming the odds with courage, integrity, a never-say-die spirit, and the help of some very loyal friends.",1140652800,,445,5.267605633802817
2657311,4,B000IHYBT6,"From the blurb I read, the director visualized clashing knights while listening to classic rock. It's at least possible that jousting was to the middle ages what car racing is to us, and rock music might provide an adrenalin pumping soundtrack as a parallel experience. Regardless, it de-fossilizes the medieval period while making it viscerally (or maybe vicariously) present for mainstream audiences.

But the real surprise is the character of Geoffrey Chaucer, author of Canterbury Tales, who in this version has a gambling problem. Thus our intrepid would-be knights find him naked on the road, having lost his clothes to his addiction. Writers in movies are usually what Dostoevsky in Notes from Underground called ""Men of Consciousness"" not ""Men of Action"". Chaucer is a man of action (as he perhaps was in his own time), and essential to the plot and story. He is done down by a Pardoner, and the joke is that he'll get revenge in the ""Pardoner's tale"" in The Canterbury Tales (which he plans to write in the movie). This film is not the only piece of art to take its inspiration from Chaucer. The other is the rock song by Procul Harem, ""Whiter Shade of Pale"" which plays off of the ""Miller's Tale,"" the bawdiest of the stories in The Canterbury Tales.

Notwithstanding Hollywood's period sense that makes everyone in any epoch appear as if they've just left the dentist office or the barber shop, this is still far above the usual tinseltown doldrums endlessly cranked out with the same predictable story lines and the same hot buttons of violence and sex. Against all odds, style and substance get equal billing in A Knight's Tale.",1140566400,,1641,4.857142857142857

2657313,4,B000IHYBT6,"To tell you right off the bat, this is not a historically accurate medieval movie, so if that is what you looking for, I would not suggest this movie. What this movie is though, is a  lot of fun. It is medieval with a modern twist. This movie is set in 14th century France/London. This movie is over all very well done. The characters are great, especially the character of Geoffery Chaucer, though not very historically accurate in presentation ( He would still in his teenage years when this movie was set), but  he is deffinatly funny and quirky and unexpected. The costumes in this movie, though not historically accurate, are a lot of fun.

 One of the only characters that irked me was Rufus Sewell's character. He's such a great actor especially in movie like Dangerous Beauty and Cold Confort Farm, but I don't think he was right for the role of the villian, he's trying hard to be evil and mean. The other character that irked me slightly was Heath Ledgers love interest. She's far to stuck up and snobby for my taste. I much prefered Laura Frazier's character.  She is more real to me.

Over all I very much recommend this movie, it is very funny and enjoyable.",1136764800,,1171,4.5260663507109005
2657314,4,B000IHYBT6,"This is a fun movie. I enjoyed it a lot, laughed at it, found it well filmed. Bettany and Purefoy steal the scenes they're in and Ledger does fine work. I saw it in the theater and then again on DVD.

Heath Ledger appears as the handsome leading man he is, with a strong sense of comedy, and is able to work the scenes well, which is good, because as a successful screenwriter (Brian Hedgeland) the scenes don't hang together, are not seamless, are choppy, don't fit either the scene before or the scene after, and on occasion leave you with that uncertain feeling of 'that doesn't make sense.'

William Thatcher is given a chance by his commoner father to ""follow his star"" and become the Squire to a Knight of the Realm. Good stuff and not uncommon to that age. Could have used a little explanation. The age is about the 10th or 11th century so we're in heady company here with Arthur, Modred, Excalibur, that whole Camelot charade, of course Chaucer, and the importance of the class system and nobility.

Here's where the script starts to slip. Some time should have been spent on why noble birth became an issue. Because that's what happens at the end and why William gets (OK, sorry to do this) unseated.

Secondly, Chaucer. This has got nothing to do with the Canterbury Tales. I took a course on them at Fordham College a thousand years ago. It should be noted in the opening credits as one of those movies with a quasi-disclaimer ""from an idea by."" Here it would say ""from an idea, that we think, had he been alive today and really high, Geoffrey Chaucer might have kidded about.""

So then there's Shannyn, with 2 n's and a y . . . no, I've said enough.

And Edward, the Black Prince of Wales (James Purefoy) who is brilliant in a small role, could have been given the words to explain to us why he couldn't get a match (""I coulda been somebody"" - Terry Malloy) and why he honors William at the end.

All in all, as a comedy with a touch of evil, a teary reunion with Dad, a sexy interlude with Lady Jocelyn, and great special effects, it's a fun, visually rewarding movie. No problems with the anachronisms and Freddy Mercury and Bowie aside, well placed and fun.

And Paul Bettany's impersonation of Michael Buffer is great. Still, it's chopped up. 4 stars. Larry Scantlebury",1136505600,,2285,4.475961538461538

2657326,4,B000IHYBT6,"In the opening scenes of this film, at a middle ages joust, Queen's We Will Rock You lets all the viewers know they are in for a witty, clever bundle of anachronisms that continually entertain throughout the film. The rock songs are not just overlaid on the story line, they are integrated.

The scenes were shot in Prague and retain a real feel of the middle ages in Paris and London. Art direction was very good, especially in the subtle, beautful and wacky costumes. Notice the subtle jewel-like colors in the dance scenes within the palace after William comes in second in his first tournament. Notice the geometric patterns on the costumes. Notice the wonderful choice of gauzy, transparent materials for both actors and actresses to contrast against the armor. The film should have won the Oscar for best costumes in 2001.

The acting is very good with Paul Bettany (playing Geoffrey Chaucer), and Mark Addy and Alan Tudyk playing William Thatcher's side kick, Roland and Wat, carrying a considerable load of the comic aspects of the film. Paul Bettany, playing a Chaucer you will never see in an English classroom, was super as a reckless gambling addict, huckster, public relations manager, and promoter. Paul Bettany should have won the Oscar for best supporting actor for his role in this film. He is able to play handsome and edgy while being bright and sarcastic.

The use of rock music throughout the film causes you to smile each time it starts. It continues to remind us that times may change but basic human nature remains the same.  It is the details in this film that reveal considerable wit to the careful viewer. For example, watch the crowd reaction when a knight's helmet is knocked off and the men in the stands fight for it like it was a football or baseball. Or, in the opening We Will Rock You scenes, watch the peasants in the stands making a wave before a joust. The insult fest between English and French in a pub prior to a tournament was certainly contemporary in its display of national tensios. Paul Bettany sounds like a professional wrestling promoter as he introduces William before each joust.

Don't expect historical accuracy, just sit back and be entertained.

The story line is fairly traditional in that William demonstrates that it is strength of character that is the basis for nobility, not birth-rights. Another story line within the film is that demonstrating love is easy so long as it does not challenge your self concept and social structural concepts, but when we are required to demonstrate love by contradicting our self constructs and social constructs, then we are really demonstrating our committment.  Thus William passes the tests set by Lady Joslin as well as the tests set by the evil Count Adhemar.

2657332,4,B000IHYBT6,"This highly enjoyable, fairy tale of a film revolves around the efforts of William, a tanner's son, trying to change his destiny. His father gave him up into servitude to a knight, when William was a slip of a lad, in hopes of his having a better future. When he grows up, William, remembering his father's advice, reaches for the stars in an effort to become what he has always dreamed of being, a knight in shining armor.

Played to perfection by the very hunky and charismatic Heath Ledger, William gets his big break when the knight, whom he serves, dies during a jousting competition. Donning his knight's armor and substituting secretly for the knight, he handily, though clumsily, wins the competition and its purse. He persuades Roland and Wat, the other two vassals who also served the now dead knight, to assist him in his efforts to continue competing. They reluctantly agree and begin helping him train for future jousting competitions. William, however, needs credentials establishing his knighthood in order to compete, as mere peasants are prohibited to do so. He has the good fortune to run into a man of letters, Geoffrey Chaucer, who happens to be a bit down on his luck. Chaucer agrees to provide him with forged patents in order to enter tournaments.

William, playing the role of a knight named Ulric Von Lichtenstein, becomes a force with which to be reckoned on the playing field. This does not pass unnoticed by an evil knight, Count Adhemar, played with deliciously wicked malice by Rufus Sewell, who does not hesitate to play dirty on and off the field, if necessary, in order to win. William, however, plays his role most honorably and nobly.

William falls in love with the Lady Jocelyn, whom Sewell also covets and intends to marry, but Lady Jocelyn, played by lovely newcomer, Shannyn Sossamon, may be falling for our erstwhile hero. This turn of events makes Count Adhemar all the more determined to win on and off the field. When a jousting competition brings them all to William's hometown, Adhemar pulls out all the stops in an effort to settle the matter once and for all.

2657334,5,B000IHYBT6,"I have to say, I LOVED this movie. I thought it was brilliant and witty and funny and stirring, even after I watched it for a second, third and fourth time...if anything, it actually got better with each repeat viewing.

As a general rule, I love knights and castles and medieval weapons. In fact, there's a special place in my heart for all things medieval--except for the black plague of course! Sadly, though, I find that most movies about knights and medieval times are actually rather pathetic. Not so in this case, though. This movie really worked!

Yes, as many reviewers have pointed out, this movie has a contemporary soundtrack, not an authentic medieval one. But personally, I liked that. It reminded me that even though this movie is set in olden times, the kids back then were the same as they are today--they wanted to go out dancing to hip tunes and get into fights and fall in love and become heroes and live their dreams and make a better life for themselves. The lifestyle might have been different back then, but the people were basically the same as they are now. Plus, the songs in the soundtrack were classics, and I was glad of any excuse to hear them! I wanted to play the air guitar along with them...although, in the interests of medieval authenticity, I had to make do with an air gittern.

I'm not going to rehash the plot of this movie for you, as every other reviewer here has pretty much done that already. But I will tell you a few things that I think you ought to know.

Firstly, when you watch this movie, do NOT turn it off when you get to the final credits, because after the credits there's a brilliantly funny bonus scene. Unfortunately, many people miss seeing this scene because they switch off too early, and that's a shame. Watch it. You'll cack yourself laughing.

Secondly, here's an interesting historical fact that you won't find out in this movie: the 'fictional' persona that the hero of this story adopts, that of Count Ulrich Von Lichtenstein (I hope I spelt that right!) really did exist. Only, the real Ulrich was actually a bit of a weirdo. You see, back in those days, the jousts were a bit like pro-wrestling is today. Fighters used to dress up and take on 'characters'. As I understand it, Ulrich actually spent an entire tournament season dressed up as a woman. And apparently, that wasn't the strangest outfit he ever wore! Also, Ulrich was so over the top, he once cut off his finger and sent it to a lady to prove his devotion to her.

2657335,2,B000IHYBT6,"William Thatcher (Heath Ledger) is the aide to a well-known knight. On the verge of winning a tournament, the knight dies, leaving William and the knight's other assistants, Roland (Mark Addy) and Wat (Alan Tudyk) desperate. They haven't eaten in three days and need the prize money to fill their stomachs. Will takes the knight's place and wins the tournament. They decide that Will should pose as a knight and compete in other tournaments. Only noblemen are allowed to complete and Will is anything but noble. Along the way, they run across Geoffrey Chaucer (Paul Bettany), who then tags along for the ride. Geoff, as his friends call him, becomes a sort of ringside announcer, revving the crowd up for each of William's appearances.

""A Knight's Tale"" is an interesting mess from writer- director Brian Helgeland. The success of just about every movie relies on the ability of the audience to suspend a certain amount of disbelief. In order for that to happen, the film has to have a certain amount of reality. ""A Knight's Tale"" has little, if any, basis in reality. I didn't buy it.

The first joust is preceded by every one in the audience stamping their fists and singing along to Robbie Williams and Queen singing ""We Will Rock You"". It was an interesting idea, in the trailers and commercials, but to have 14th century people singing along to a rock song is just stupid. Throughout the rest of the film, the 20th century music is played in the background to little effect.

We have all heard of films based in the past in which their were historical inaccuracies. Cowboys wearing wrist watches, roman soldiers wearing tennis shoes, etc. There have even been modern day reinterpretations of stories set in the past. Baz Luhrman's 'Romeo+Juliet' is a good example. ""A Knight's Tale"" does neither, falling somewhere in between. Frequently, the characters spout 20th century jargon, yet also continue to speak in a style that most people would buy as 14th century England. Why bother with the antiquated speech at all? If you want to have someone say 'Hello, it's called a lance' in the way that people do, to indicate something should be obvious, or to say 'Yes', in a way to indicate that they are pleased, why bother trying to make the characters seem as though they have walked out of a Shakespeare play. It is inconsistent and dumb.

Geoff Chaucer becomes a sort of ancient WWF ringside announcer. Dumb.

Jocelyn, played by Shannyn Sossamon, seems to be a sort of jousting groupie. Her role at these events is never really explained. Why is she popping up at these events? Will, of course, sets his eyes on her, and she returns the favors.

The jousting scenes are interesting, but the characters lack believability and interest, causing us to find nothing to identify with.

Ultimately, the film plays like a live-action version of the classic Bugs Bunny cartoon 'Knighty Night Bugs'. Bugs is having his ears done and gets hit on the head by an apple, transporting him back to Medieval times. There, he has trouble blending in, using 20th century phrases, until he realizes that he should start using phrases like 'Here sooth'. Ultimately, he jousts the Black Knight (sounds very familiar). After he talks about his friends including  the 'Count of Basie'. He is hit on the head again and returns to the present day.

I felt like I was hit on the head by an apple.",1113264000,,3374,4.773584905660377

But the over-all movie is to root for the underdog and come out smiling.  This movie is personally one of my favorite Heath Ledger movies.

Heath plays William who is a peasant squire and  ends up passing himself off for a knight and ends up jousting his way up!  Makes for an amazing story.  He has a rival that will do anything to stop him in his tracks...and when it comes to the scene against one another you will be on the edge of you set rooting for one and hating the other.  You will be riding along with each one, laughing at all the jokes and so forth if you go in not wanting this movie to be serious!

I did not watch this film in it's entirity. 57 minutes into my descent toward death I managed to drag myself from the room by my left index finger, -the only part of my body able to survive the overwhelming physical depression. As I lay in the hallway willing my body back into action, I considered the possible motives anyone would have for inflicting this monstrosity upon the world. I came up with nothing, save the notion that some idiot somewhere thought that a bit of slow-motion jousting was a good enough premise for an entire film.

This film isn't just bad, it's debilitatingly naff. You won't laugh, you won't cry, you won't be scared, you'll just be perpetualy bewildered for many weeks to come. I still wake up at night asking ""why?""

The first time I saw this movie, I was screaming in disbelieving horror throughout.  However, my sons loved it and it was on HBO, so the second time they watched it, I could see some merit.  By the third time, I was forced to agree with the reviewer who said Chaucer would've loved this.  He would have.  The commoner rising up on his own (basically) honest merits comes straight from Chaucer.  Yes, some of the dialogue is cliched, the Black Prince was not noted for progressiveness, but the cast makes it rise up above such picayune things.  Ledger is great, and Jocelyn actually has a mind of her own.  See it with an open mind and see for yourself.  One other note - mute the volume during Robbie Williams attempt at Queen (final song).

Which horrible flaw to start with...ah yes the terrible script.  What is not cliche is schmaltzy crap not even worthy of a soap opera script.  I believe I could have written a better movie at the age of seven.  The entire plot was so predictable this is possibly the most unoriginal movie I have ever seen.  Lifeless scenes are confusing with little to no adaquete transitions.  Characters are shallow and thinnly developed.  The historical innacuracies make one want to weep.  A peasant would never be able to rise to knighthood and the fact that he fools everybody throughout most of the film is questionable at best.  The rock music, though enjoyable, makes you question how seriously you should be taking this movie.  The disco dancing was completely distracting and did not fit at all with the rest of the movie.  The anachronisms were so sporadic they made the rest of the movie seem ludicrous even when it was trying to be taken seriously.  That was a huge tone problem.  And lastly, what the heck is up with the heroine's hair?  The hairstyles are so utterly ridiculous that after a certain point laughing at them was the only entertainment in this movie.  This is definitely two hours and ten minutes of my life I want back, so anyone claiming that young impressionable women like this film are disgustingly sexist.",1099094400,,1477,4.688715953307393

My only beef with the movie was the love triangle that wasn't.  It's sooo stereotypical for the knight to fall for the fair lady.  I'd rather the fair lady have been stuck up, and William ran away with Kate (whose character is much more developed in the film), but other than that, it was thoroughly enjoyable.",1099094400,,729,4.584615384615384

Despite the fact that William ended up with Jocelyn instead of Kate, the movie still works. Reviewer Octavius needs to lighten up. A film is meant to be taken for what it is, not what it isn't.

It is an honorable tale, has good acting, humor, action, good supporting roles, decent pace, good camera work (it does not detract from the story).  It is not entirely predictable in specific events but the story is a standard epic.  The feel is authentic, people actually get hurt and not everything works out perfect.

2657350,4,B000IHYBT6,"A Knight's Tale is what you get when you cross underdog sports drama, comedy, medieval knights, and a healthy dose of Gen X attitude. William Thatcher is a nobody, son of a peasant, fascinated with knights. When the knight he's serving dies before the final round of a joust, William takes a chance and assumes his identity.
The show wastes no time whatsoever getting straight to the fun stuff. The above paragraph is the very first thing you'll see in the movie, and the very next is the movie's first joust set to Queen's We Will Rock You. The twist here isn't just a cheap soundtrack, but the fact that it's interwoven into the movie itself. The jousting audience is more of a football crowd, clapping along to the legendary beat and having fun. The herald trumpet players are even shown to belt a few notes, while the guards step along.
The best example I can think of this previously is Robin Hood: Men in Tights. A Knight's Tale takes it one step farther however by taking it all very seriously. By the end of the show you could almost believe it. Heralds that sound more like boxing announcers, armor with famous looking logos, ultra modern hair and outfits, and even an amazing dance sequence that blends classical with modern set to David Bowie. It's a highlight of the movie and worth watching just for that scene alone.
The best thing I can say about A Knight's Tale is how real it all is, despite it's theme. The modern aspects are blended into the events with real tact, the comedy is honestly funny, and the drama is in no way cheapened by the lightheartedness. It's not exactly Oscar material, but the show has a few honestly dramatic and heart touching moments that are go over extremely well to anyone but scoffing critics.
If you've ever had even a slight fascination with Knights and the joust, give this a watch. It's a great movie filled with all the fun and wit one could ask for. The Gen X attitude may seem like a gimmick, but if you're as tired as I am of lame actors speaking in extremely poor old English, this movie is for you.",1088553600,,2055,4.482666666666667

The primary reviewer here said: ""Upon witnessing a crowd of peasants at a jousting match, singing and clapping to the beat of Queen's ""We Will Rock You,"" you're either going to love this movie or dismiss it altogether.""  I was one who dismissed it at that point.  The ""jarring anachronisms"" were not only out of place, but they were unneeded and did nothing to benefit the film.  The rock music is fine in itself, but did they really have to simulate the crowd dancing to it?  Perhaps if they had just had a more ""tongue in cheek"" approach to this... witness Moulin Rouge and how they played up their use of modern song and dance in the late 1800's.  But here the production seems to imply either one of 2 things:  you the viewer are either so savvy about historical details that the anachronisms add a light-hearted comic touch, or the producers do not care a whit about how historical details may be judged by the viewer.

Heath Ledger exudes an earthy manliness and a boyish naievete well; Rufus Sewell continues to play the villain with a cold aplomb; Mark Addy as Roland is also great; Shannon Sossamyn and James Purefoy (as Jocelyn and Edward the Black) also lend supreme support.  But inevitably the movie falls into the hammish hands of Paul Bettany as the herald, Geoffrey Chaucer.  Bettany is brilliant as the hawkster who is always losing his clothes to gambling debts and as the wordsmith who eloquently introduces his fair knight.

Writer, producer and director Brian Helgeland has taken his vision of medevial times and melded it perfectly with the music of today. The first time I viewed this mixture it was a little jarring, but on second viewing it seemed to go together perfectly.
Heath Ledger takes the starring role of William Thatcher a peasant who is determined to change his future and makes it his own, although I still think he's a little over the top, but he has some blockbusters lined up in his future.
My biggest surprise after watching it for the second time recently was a couple of faces in this largely unknown (to me) cast who have become very familiar to me in the last couple of years. They are Heath Ledger's squires Alan Tudyk (from Joss Whedon's great ""Firefly"") and Mark Addy (from ""The Full Monty"" and CBS's ""Still Standing"").

Other than that, I find little, if any fault in the movie.  As one who is a fan, and attendee of many Renaissance festivals and who has seen Jousting combat first hand, I can say that this is superbly well done.

2657358,3,B000IHYBT6,"Yes, our young hero trains to be a great jousting knight to the sounds of ""Takin' Care of Business"" in ""A Knight's Tale.""  That scene, along with the ""We Will Rock You"" opening, among others, definitely sets this period piece apart from the pack.
""A Knight's Tale"" is fun.  It has that ""poor kid does good"" theme running throughout and can be very heroic and sentimental at times.  But don't expect this flick to blow you away.  It is very good, and quite unique, but the overall story is rather standard as far as knight stories go.
Heath Ledger is perfect as the young hero of this tale.  He has a group of bumbling sidekicks, including Geoffrey Chaucer, that support him throughout the movie.  There's a love interest, who I really never felt fit the rest of the cast.  Then, of course, there's a great villain, who I felt was only there to fill the need of having a villain.
The real story is about Ledger's character becoming something he isn't allowed to be by the standards of the day.  It shows how a hero is measured not by his nobility or rank, but by his heart.  Along the way, Ledger's sidekicks provide comic relief and the action in the jousting competitions is great.
Overall, a solid movie that only has a couple of holes in it.  The villain isn't really that necessary, and the love interest, Joycelyn, is out of whack with the overall feel of this movie.

Sure it's predictable and there are plenty of cliched lines, but the film absolutely succeeds in what it set out to do.  It plays very well by its own rules.  And it is surprisingly moving at times.  When the film could have sunk to schmaltz, it holds its own with good acting and sturdy writing.
What could have been another stupid teen movie actually has legs and a soul.
I'm amazed the number of people who fault it for its inventive style in incorporating contemporary music with the medieval milieu, when these same people loved Shrek for doing exactly the same thing.
I applaud the risks the film takes and how well it succeeds when it takes them.  In the end, isn't Pro Wrestling or boxing the modern day equivalent of the joust?  In spirit and appeal, at least, if not in grace or sophistication.

2657361,4,B000IHYBT6,"As another user commented, this film is incredibly ridiculous. As the film starts, you hear ""We Will Rock You"" playing in the background. Okay, I thought, they took modern music and set it to the movie. Pretty absurd, but it might be cool. Then as they showed the audience and I thought it couldn't get any crazier, I noticed they were actually singing it! This film doesn't simply try to modernize itself by throwing in twentieth century pop-culture, it actually incorporates it. At one point, someone says ""Can I get a shout-out for London!"" About the only thing they didn't do in this film was have anyone ""raise the roof!"" Yet surprisingly enough, all of this campiness works and provides for a fun and entertaining movie.
After about 20 minutes, you begin to accept the campiness of the film and enjoy it. You realize how absurd it is, but just don't care. The director took a huge gamble with these ideas, but I think it pays off well. You just need to get over the historical inacuracies and corniness of a Knight's Tale and enjoy. Most people in the theater were laughing with the film, not at it.
While not the greatest film ever made, it certainly is a successful one, and provides for an entertaining picture that many should enjoy. If you're considering paying an extra $8 for the ""Superbit"" eidtion, I would advise just to get the regular edition.

2657363,5,B000IHYBT6,"Okay, like some others here let me stress...THIS IS NOT MEANT TO BE A HISTORICALLY ACCURATE MOVIE.
After reading the first 80 reviews I feel compelled to add my own 2 cents.  We rented this and I have to agree that in the first few minutes I was revolted by the rock music, being a big fan of historical pieces set in the middle ages.  Despite my initial feelings, I stuck it out.  Too soon I found myself again annoyed by the styles worn by the Lady Jocelyn.  Yuck!  ""What is going on"", I wondered.  But already I was finding myself involved in the story line and enjoying the humor, especially the interactions among the main characters.  By the end I was willing to admit I'd been entertained and I was in love with all the characters with the possible exception of Jocelyn.
Then we watched all the extra bonus material and I was amazed at the thought and work that went into this movie.  I just had to watch it again, having gained a new perspective on WHY things were done the way they were.  What I discovered was an extremely entertaining romp.
For those of you who only saw the theatre version or are concerned about the rock and roll references in these reviews, try to see the director's point of view.  Throughout history parents have strived to understand their youngsters.  Or do we assume that the generations have always perfectly understood one another until it came to the 20th century?  Language, music, clothes...isn't it likely that different generations differed as much in opinions then as now?  If not then how did the culture ever evolve into something completely different?  Notice that I have avoided the term ""teens"".  Well, face it, back then the teens WERE adults.  But there must still have been generational gaps.  Did they say ""wow"" in historical times?  No.  But it's probable that there was a word that conveyed a similar meaning from a ""slang"" perspective.  Language is not static, it is ever-changing.  What we speak today would not even be understood by those who lived in England almost 700 years ago, so how can anyone complain about accents and language?  Do they really think that anybody from England today would have been understood back then? Please.
Music....hello?  Orchestral is better for periodic pieces why?  As another reviewer mentioned...it's no more periodic than rock.  The director was wanting to portray a fresh perspective and succeeded hugely.  I'm sorry but when you're trying to convey a sense of excitement such as one feels at a football game (yes, that's the analogy used to try bringing jousting to a more modern perspective), chamber music isn't likely to get anyone in today's world fired-up.
And folks, that's a big part of what this whole movie is all about. Jousting was a major sporting event that was very exciting to the people of the time.  How does one convey that excitement to a modern audience?  The drama is easily done...but the intense emotion, the exhilaration we associate with a favorite sport?  I feel that the director found an exciting new way to bring the medieval world alive for modern viewers.
As to Jocelyn.  She's a bit shallow and the costumes are starting to bother me less.  But her character (or lack thereof), allows for some very comedic lines that I think add to the overall fun of the movie.
I could go on but other reviewers have hit most of the other key points.  The bottom line is: if you've seen it once...try it again...and watch the extra stuff.  If you haven't, then get it...rent it first if you must but watch this movie.  It is now one of our favorite movies and just the other night we watched it again with tremendous enjoyment and I wanted to see each and every single extra feature again.  It's family-friendly and a romantic comedy that you won't mind at all having the teens and youngsters watch.
As one reviewer said, ""suspend your belief from the start""...and then settle down to enjoy this story.  It's fun, it still portrays a medieval ""flavour"", and the music ROCKS!",1067299200,,3989,4.689208633093525

Ledger seems a decent actor but here he was trying to hold this abomination together almost single-handed and failed miserably. As I mentioned, the plot was so obvious, I felt like maybe they producers had stumbled across one of my 4th grade essays and cribbed the movie from that.

2657367,3,B000IHYBT6,"It's the middle of the Fourteenth Century; the tail end of the middle ages, and jousting (a violent sport, that basically involves two men trying to skewer each other with huge poles, while on horseback) is the equivalent of football.
Will Thatcher (Heath Ledger) and his friends Roland and Watt are servants to a knight who regularly competes in these competitions. However, in the first scene of the movie Will and Roland find him dead under a tree. Desperate for the money their knight's win would have provided them, the three young men decide that Will will compete under the dead knight's name (which is risky because if he were found out, the consequences would be serious). However, Will wins and the friends decide to spend their money, training Will to joust, the goal being Will eventually competing in a tournament.
Will goes to the first tournament under a false name, impersonating a nobleman with the help of Geoffrey Chaucer (yes, the same Geoffrey Chaucer who wrote `The Canterbury Tales'). He soon meets the beautiful Jocelyn who is unrealistically played by Shannyn Sossamon. Although pretty in modern times, anyone as dark-skinned and anemic looking as Sossamon not have been considered worth a second glance in the 14th century, and she wears ridiculously modern clothes on top of that.
Will also makes an enemy of Count Adhemar of Anjou, played with convincing arrogance by Rufus Sewell. Adhemar, who never accepts less than the best for himself, has set his sights both on winning every tournament and marrying Jocelyn. As Will is his only competition in both arenas, their dislike for each other is mutual.
For what it is, this movie is pretty good. I could have done without all the classic rock in medieval England, but it was an original choice of music all the same.
Ledger is one of the actors who is never outstandingly good or egregiously bad, so there isn't much to be said either way for his performance - except that it was in no way a stretch for him. Sossomon wasn't terrible in a technical sense, but something about the way she portrayed a character, who was a tad annoying anyway, drove me up the wall. The best performances were definitely those of Rufus Sewell and Paul Bettany, but they also had the most interesting characters. Sewell (who I had never seen in a movie before) was excellent as an infuriatingly overconfident and sadistic nobleman, and Bettany (whose character was an interesting inclusion in the gauntlet of types of medieval people) was realistic as a zealous and crowd-pleasing speaker.
I give it three stars, because although it lacked quite a bit, it was entertaining and somehow hard not to like.",1059177600,,2660,4.861233480176211
2657368,5,B000IHYBT6,"You'll hear a hundred complaints about different historical flaws throughout this movie. Let me point out: the film opens with trumpets blasting out the sound of electric guitars. DU!!! This wasn't created to be historically correct. This is a contemporary, action, adventure, comedy, and romance (coincidentally set in the Mediaeval world.) Now let's look at the film from some of the angles it was intended to be seen from. The Joust: The production crew spent months trying to invent different ways to fake jousting for the filming; but they couldn't do it. So they shot it FOR REAL!! Folks film just doesn't look better than this. Next the characters: The name of the story: ""A Knight's Tale"" refers to the knight; but the story really revolves around him and his four companions. This five-some is brilliant. A crazy literary and linguistic genius with a gambling problem, a hulking conservative right-wing Catholic, a crazy red headed bean pole who never has control of his temper and loves to eat-beyond him, a female black smith (who has no romantic entanglements with any character outside her widower husband.) And lastly the Knight. These characters were all so brilliant and so well casted that we will all believe in their existence (implicitly) not by the end of the film; but by the first few minutes. Beyond that the photography of the movie was brilliant. Often instead of having the camera make one face fill the whole screen, we're allowed to watch the whole group as they interact which makes the film so rich; even it's dialogue can be watched and re-watched many times (seeing a new thing every time). (Trust me, I've already done it.) Beyond that the music for this movie was absolutely perfect. Think Knights on horses bashing each other around what is the only type of music appropriate for that? The Best of 70's Rock. (Watch it, you'll see and hear.) Finally for the historians, don't tell me the movie should have been orchestral because they didn't have 70's rock back in the mediaeval era; you know what? They didn't have orchestral music either go check it out; that's history.)",1058400000,,2109,4.8774373259052926

The joy that's evident onscreen, however, raises it levels above other films like this (Hearts & Armor, for example).",1058313600,,405,4.315789473684211

The knights are making their way onto the field, riding high on top of their steeds, looking at the arena full of people, both peasants and royalty, singing and clapping their hands to Queen's ""We Will Rock You.""
Say what??????????
For most people, they will either love or hate this movie based on the first ten minutes, which contains the aformentioned rock anthem. If you do decide to brave this weirdness, you will be treated to a movie that is much better than the burning that many critics gave it.
Heath Ledger stars as William Thatcher, a peasant whose dreams are much, much bigger than he is. But Williams won't let that stop him. The first chance he gets, he impersonates a knight by pretending that he is descended from royalty. Since peasants are not allowed to joust, he must continue his act no matter what. Even if that means lying to the one he loves.
The casting of this movie was brillant, but none more so than casting Paul Bettany as Geoffrey Chaucer (see one of the extras on the history behind bringing this real life writer into the movie as one of the characters). Shannyn Sossamon, making her acting debut as Jocelyn, the object of Thatcher's love, makes her presence known with every move, word, and stare. You will quickly see why Thatcher is in love with her.

Heath Ledger gives a good performance, and Rufus Sewell is the knight you'll love to hate.  Everyone in the supporting cast does a superb job as well, and they were really a good match for each other.  ""A Knight's Tale"" has a great soundtrack (that's more than a little out of time) and spectacular jousting matches, but also is a wonderful story.  The movie really has it all:  humor, romance, battle (jousting anyway), beautiful scenery, excellent camera work, and hot tunes.

The movie is about a young squire from old England named William.  The knight that he and his friends have been following most of their lives dies during a jousting competition, and in order to win the trophy (so they can eat), William dons the armor and mask (thus breaking the rule of only the nobility may joust) and wins the match.  Charged by this victory, the trio elects to continue the charade and William becomes Sir Ulrich.  Now they must travel and compete, all the while trying to conceal the truth as Ulrich vies to win the heart of his sweet Jocelyn (who his nemesis Count Adhemar vows to steal from him).

The DVD features are excellent also, if that's something you're interested in.  The commentary is done by Brian Helgeland (director) and Paul Bettany (Geoff) and I do recommend listening to it at least once.  Some deleted scenes are included, although they're not of high quality as far as the actual picture-quality goes.  Also included are a few ""making of"" featurettes that are worth watching if you care at all about cinematic production or if you just want to know how they did all that jousting without getting killed.

  No.  Don't get your hopes too high.  The very very beginning had me cracking up with laughter (especially when the king? tapped his hand along to the beat!)and i thought this is definitely going to be a favorite film!  Well, it's not.  I mean, Heath Ledger was good, Rufus Sewell bad, and the Chaucer guy amusing. There are some really good and funny scenes.  The script wasn't that great, but neither was it that bad either.
  Except for one thing. The girl character really ruined it for me.  She was dull, boring, ridiculous, weird and petty. I don't think her role, character or acting fit. They should've used someone who looked more the part historically if she was going to speak modern or they could've left her modernly bizarre with impeccable speech or something.  Any sort of change would have done.  Even different facial expressions.  Though personally i think they might as well have cut her charactor out of the movie.  She just pulled it down. (oh, and that whole jousting scene really bugs me - like yeah, to prove your love let some guy beat you up with brass knuckles or something)
  The redeeming thing for me?  THe Black Prince!!  I totally flipped out when i realized he was in the movie - nearly moved to tears (hey, i'm a hist. buff and see him as a sort of romantic figure).  For those who don't know, the Black Prince is (English) King Edward III's son. Not much is known of him (we're not even sure why he's the BLACK prince) and he died before he could ascend the throne. I always love looking up books about him and this is the first time i've seen him fictionalized (in book or film).  So I was thrilled.  Definitely added points to the movie.

2657377,3,B000IHYBT6,"This is a fun 2-hour pile of raucous fluff. Heath Ledger is great as William Thatcher (aka, Ulrich von Lichtenstein, a very eccentric knight in history who did not behave like Thatcher at all), and his compatriots (including a nifty, scoundrelish Geoffrey Chaucer) are fun. The jousting scenes and costuming are enjoyable; much has been made of the use of classic rocks tunes with the soundtrack, but it works well enough, given the light-hearted tone that dominates through the majority of the movie.
Rufus Sewell is good (though underused) as the villainous Count Adhemar, though the attempt to portray him as the aristocratic past (constrasting him with Ledger as the egalitarian future) didn't quite gel with the overall tone of the movie. The appearance of Edward ""The Black Prince"" was nice, although I could see early on that he was ending up a plot device to bail out Thatcher.
My biggest problem with this movie is the casting of Shannyn Sossamon (aka, Angelina Jolie LITE), who doesn't work at all, except as eye candy. I think the writer/director/producer must have been in love with her, because her role as Jocelyn seemed crafted as a star vehicle for her, showcasing her within the story without making her a real part of it. The costuming and hairstyles they did for her are jarringly out of step with everybody else around her, and I found them very distracting. Yes, she's pretty, but I found her painfully anachronistic -- is she an Asian princess? A French merchant daughter? A Jewess (ala Ivanhoe)? It's unclear and is never explained. Her dad is mentioned as wanting her to marry the Count, and I can't fathom any medieval father wanting his seemingly well-born daughter to love a commoner (even a recently knighted one as Thatcher is). After watching it, I laughed that after the ""Thatcher wins the girl"" ending kiss, she leaves him behind and marries the Count, knowing where her interests lie.
I had hoped Thatcher would end up with Kate, the cheeky (and striking) armorer who does more for Thatcher than Jocelyn ever does by crafting him a great suit of armor that makes his career possible. But she's only played in a minor role -- I was envisioning a medieval ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" situation with Kate and William, but they didn't do that. The linear love story (William loves Jocelyn, Jocelyn loves William) is sadly lacking any real bumps (they have one minor bump, and it's clear that the Count will have no chance with her). Let's make them work for their unlikely love, yes?
Another thing I didn't like was that William's knightly activities are confined solely to the jousting lists -- I had hoped he'd have his mettle (and metal!) tested in actual war. The cameos by the Black Prince made me think William might actually see what true knighthood entailed in warfare, but that doesn't happen, either. So, it's all ultimately a game for William.
This is a fun movie, despite itself; it could have been an excellent one, if the writer/director/producer had worked through several more revisions and tightened up the story and made Jocelyn fit in more with the world she was in, instead of making her look like a smug refugee from a Star Trek set.",1041811200,,3180,4.794171220400728

2657384,4,B000IHYBT6,"A KNIGHT'S TALE is a light-hearted, romantic comedy set in the mid-14th century and centered around the sport of jousting.
Heath Ledger plays one of three servants of a knight who has the misfortune to fall from his horse and die immediately before his scheduled appearance in a tournament. Since his servants don't eat if their man doesn't compete and win, they find themselves up against it. Ledger, as Will Thatcher, has the daring idea of donning his dead master's armor and competing under his identity. As luck would have it, he wins. Afterwards, he convinces his buddies, Roland and Wat (Mark Addy and Alan Tudyk), to invest the prize money (15 silver pieces) into the equipment needed to prepare and train for the next tournament, then the next. The ultimate goal is the World Championship of Jousting to be held in London.
As Will trains in the forest away from prying eyes, he and his two pals provide slapstick comedy reminiscent of the Three Stooges. However, Thatcher perseveres. Finally, the only problem left is to acquire knighthood, since jousting is reserved for the nobility. Our boys soon encounter a naked man walking down the road, who turns out to be the young writer Geoffrey Chaucer (Paul Bettany), fleeced of all his possessions by a gambling loss. In exchange for clothes and food, Chaucer forges the appropriate documents that give Will an impressive upper class lineage as Sir Ulrich of Liechtenstein, and afterwards serves as Ulrich's herald.
All characters in this delightful film are attractive and well-played, even that of Count Adhemar (Rufus Sewell), the treacherous (but extremely capable) fighter who is Will's greatest obstacle to the Big Prize Money. And, since every gallant knight needs a Babe to provide some silky underthing as a token to fight under, we have Shannyn Sossamon as Lady Jocelyn. Sossaman has strong-featured good looks that are sometime spoiled, in my opinion, by coiffures that might be considered bizarre in this day and age, much less the Middle Ages. And Jocelyn's costuming is occasionally tongue-in-cheek humorous. At one point, she wears a hat that brings to mind Audrey Hepburn's Holly Golightly persona in BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S. (My wife, whose one-time hobby was making medieval costumes, chortled at the incongruity of some of Jocelyn's outfits.) Another character that attaches to Sir Ulrich's entourage is the blacksmithess Kate (Laura Fraser). Young and very pretty, one would have expected Kate to provide a love interest for somebody, but disappointingly never does. She serves principally as a foil for the boy-will-be-boys shenanigans of her traveling companions.
One of the more quirky elements of A KNIGHT'S TALE is the contemporary classic rock soundtrack. When a disguised Will enters the arena to compete for the first time, the spectators  belt out a rendition of ""We Will Rock You"". Later, as the World Championship contestants ride into London, the crowd sings ""The Boys Are Back In Town"". While seeming absurd at first, it grows on you.

The first and most annoying of these two points is the need for QUEEN to be included in this movie.  Now I love Queen, Fred and Co. left a lasting impression on music in general however I find it awfully hard to be convinced that they would be providing the mood music for a medieval jousting tournament
The seound point is that the producers just HAD to ham this movie up.  Now when I say ""ham"" I mean when you take a perfectly good movie and try to inject said movie with a sense of justice or some sort of moral.  The moral in this case is the need for the young knight(played by Ledger) to ""Change his stars""(by which he means getting out of his generally [bad] peasant life.)

No performances leap out as great, with the exception of Paul Bettany (the saving grace of A Beautiful Mind), who played Chaucer. That was a great touch.

2657394,4,B000IHYBT6,"I've seen A Knight's Tale a few times, and I must admit, the more times I've watched it, the more I've come to like this film. A Knight's Tale is nothing deep, it's a fun, innovative movie about incorporating rock music into a different era altogether. I'm not a great fan of Heath Ledger, but the supporting cast was great. Particularly outstanding was Paul Bettany as Chaucer, he brought humor and vibrancy to his character. Jocelyn was not much more than eye candy, but she is quite pretty. And William's (Ledger's) friends are also hilarious in their actions. I really had great time watching this film, it's definitely more fun when you're watching it with other people. One of the best scenes of the film, which just made the whole movie for me was when William and Jocelyn danced at the feast, to David Bowie's Golden Years.

2657395,2,B000IHYBT6,"There's a scene in The Big Chill where William Hurt turns to Jeff Goldblum and says ""You're so analytical.  Sometimes you just have to let art flow over you.""  While watching A Knight's Tale my friend  turned to me and said ""The art flows over me...and right on down into the sewer.""  I wouldn't go so far as to say that the movie was excrement.  However, I would say that the tonal inconsistencies of this film are so extreme that I was never able to enter the story.  I spent the entire movie in a state of awe that so much money and so many people would be involved in producing such a specimen of utter confusion.
A Knight's Tale is Blazing Saddles meets Excalibur meets Shakespeare in Love.  Underneath all of the wild production choices is a fairly good script.  Young peasant William [Heath Ledger] disguises himself as a knight to win jousting tournaments, trying to win enough money to-as he puts it-""change my stars."" The movie was well-cast and the acting was good.  Mark Addy (who played Dave in the Full Monty) was particularly believable as Roland, the earnest and loyal sidekick. With a team of companions and a beautiful love interest and a villain who threatens to bring the whole enterprise down, it could have worked.
Where it falls apart is in the anachronistic production choices.  As young William approaches the first jousting field, onlookers clap in rhythm to Queen's anthem ""We Will Rock You.""  As the crane shot moves closer to specific extras, you see them rocking out, dancing disco, singing along with the soundtrack.  It's a very Mel Brooks moment, and so you settle in and laugh a little and think ""ah, Space Balls Middle Ages.  I get it.""
And then the film gets serious.  Twenty minutes later all the anachronisms are gone, but you've been unsettled enough by them that you're looking for satire throughout the film.  Scenes which could have been touching are ruined.  Occasionally you hear a half-familiar line, or see a half-familiar camera shot, and you think you're watching a very subtle satire, perhaps a send-up of the whole movie industry.  But you never can quite put your finger on what it is they're trying to satirize.  So-if you're me and you've spent the whole movie wondering ""what the heck was Brian Helgeland thinking?!?""-you go to the director's commentary on the DVD expecting some answers.
The only answer I got from the first ten minutes of the commentary was:  he wasn't.  The director's commentary sounds more like two old college buddies rehashing old times about people you never knew than any serious reflection on the approach to production.  In retrospect, A Knight's Tale seemed like 100 scenes in search of a movie, and I feel generous giving it two stars.",1028419200,,2719,4.754797441364605

2657398,5,B000IHYBT6,"All right. First things first. To get the most out of this film DO NOT even TRY to compare it to Excalibur, Gladiator, or any other big epic film set in times of yore. This is a comedy with some drama in it that manages to poke great fun at the genre. It willingly makes spectacle of itself. It does it so well that it's like watching an old medieval court jester at his best. This will make you laugh, if you let yourself have fun.

 Okay. Characters. What a bunch we have. William: our usual boy oof common birth but with a grand heart who aspires to be a knight. Lady Jocelyn: The princess that William aspires to woo and win the heart of. Roland and Wat: His two childhood buddies . A pair pair of loveable, loyal and good-humored goofballs. Kate: The pretty but fiesty blacksmith with a good heart and a steel backbone. Geoffrey Chaucer: A hapless wandering writer, acting as a sort of support and hereald for William. As an announcer Geoffrey could give Michael Buffer a run for his money, for sheer passion and theatrics. Quite the character this man Geoffrey Chaucer. Then of course we have Count Adhemar, the villian who thinks only of ""himself, and his own honor"" A perfectly dastardly chap is our Adhemar.
 Music. What can I say. This is is NOT Medieval period music obviously. Not most of it any way. Most is 70's rock tunes but they appropriately emphasize the comedic nature of this picture to give the the scenes where they are played a little more of humorous punch. In places orchestral music is used, and where that is the case the music is suitably rousing and dramaatic, giving the sceenes where they use it addition tension and a sense of readiness for a big moment to come.

 Before you start thinking this movie is all laughs, I must say to you that there are several genuinely touching moments in it, like William's reunion with his father after years away and several more I will not mention for fear of spoiling the movie for you. Also the love story in this I found touching as well. Stilted, maybe but heartwarming and certainly poetic in a very real sense.
 All in all this to me is great family entertainment. Lots of action. Plenty of humor, with touches of tenderness too. If you want a movie that you can just kick back and have fun with it, give this one a try. I loved it and I think you can enjoy it too. The key is relax and have fun with the film. It certainly has a lot of fun with itself. Peace, and God bless you.",1027468800,,2454,4.358862144420131

But then I realized that I can be a real jerk sometimes.  This movie is fun-- the non-period elements are part of the charm.  When the characters all do a semi-medieval dance to a David Bowie song, it's really a good moment.  It's funny, it doesn't take itself too seriously (unlike me sometimes) and it is an entertaining look at class warfare, how we can sometimes get so caught up in what is the ""norm"" that we forget what really should be.
The scene where Chaucer promises his revenge on the evil summoner & pardoner is something that makes anyone who has read the Canterbury Tales (especially the naughty stories they don't always teach in high school) laugh out loud.  Granted, this is not Great Literature (with a capital GL).  But I horrify myself when I catch me being an elitist English major-- have fun with this movie, watch it with a kid who has no concept that ""some things just aren't done"" then read the Canterbury Tales & figure out ways of making history & your own life as interesting and ""norm breaking"" as it can be.",1026691200,,1304,4.531914893617022

Fortunately, the sight of peasants clapping, stomping and singing along to Queen's ""We Will Rock You"" in the opening scene immediately sets the tone. The rest of the film is a fast, fun and occasionally moving joyride, borrowing the structure of every loser-sports-team-makes-good comedy you've ever seen and overlaying it with the requisite teen romance and even a tearjerker father-son-reunion scene. Heath Ledger is appealing as Sir William, and Rufus Sewell manages to stifle a laugh long enough to make Count Adhemar threatening. But it's Paul Bettany as Chaucer, and Mark Addy and Alan Tudyk as Sir William's harried offsiders, Roland and Wat, who steal the show. This isn't a serious period piece, and it isn't meant to be.

2657407,4,B000IHYBT6,"A Knight's Tale is the inspiring story of a young squire's dream of becoming more than he was born into. As a boy, William's father, a humble Thatcher, brought his boy to Sir Ector, a knight who could provide the child with a better, or at least more interesting life. Years later, on their way to a jousting tournament, Sir Ector dies, leaving William and his partners, Roland and Wat, without a provider. Knowing there will be money and food waiting for them at the tournament, the starving group decides to go anyway, with William disguising himself as Sir Ector. But they are soon surprised to find that William has a talent for jousting, and there's much money to be had in the sport. Along the road they meet the one and only Chaucer, who agrees to act as Herald for the would-be knight, William. Together, the gang sweeps the Jousting tournaments, and William, competing under a pseudonym since he is not of noble birth and therefore breaking the law by competing, becomes a famous sports hero. He continues to make friends and enemies along the way, particularly a sassy, young noble woman (though I thought the blacksmith girl who joined his band was more attractive and had a better personality), and a mean-spirited, arrogant bully of a knight who also has his sights set on the lady. With the help of his friends, William must  win the heart of his dream-girl, deal with his competition, and somehow win the Grand Championship without getting busted for pretending to be a real knight.
  A Knight's Tale is a great story and great fun, but makes a less than successful attempt at times to be Disney's Hercules. Most of the film is just a great, inspirational, historical tale, but there are times when the film tries to be modern, with the characters singing along to classic rock, and dancing in modern styles. Had this been something that was carried on throughout the film, it might have worked, but since it only happened a few times, it just seemed so odd and out of place. The theme of having classic rock running throughout the film worked fine as background music, it's when the characters seem aware of the ""modern"" music that it throws off the viewer. This was a wonderful film, and I'm sorry to say that the couple of times that they took this approach I became a bit embarrassed to be watching it. It's still well worth owning, it's just a shame that they couldn't decide what sort of movie they wanted to be with the 20th century mixings.",1026086400,,2463,4.6187214611872145

It has the trailer, lots of good deleted scenes, and best of all, the commentary with Paul Bettany (Chaucer) and Brian Helgeland (Writer, Producer, and Director). That commentary is absolutely hilarious! Those guys are really funny. They are very tongue-in-cheek about their own movie. It really gives you a new understanding of the movie to listen to these guys bash it like they do. It really offsets all the negative reviews on this post.

There are some great lines in the commentary. They explain to us what ""I will FONG you"" means. It is also hilarious to hear about ""Paul's Pimp Jacket"" and the explanation behind his nakedness at the beginning. Plus all the other interesting information they give. It is really good.
Now, about the EXTRA SCENE. This is so hilarious, I had to stop the movie and just laugh out loud for a while! It was so funny, because it was totally unexpected. After you watch the commentary, let the movie keep playing. Let it go all the way past the credits.

  1.  They combined hard rock.  C'mone, QUEEN PLAYING WE WILL ROCK YOU IN MEDIEVIL DAYS?!?!?! ARE THESE PEOPLE INSANE?!?!?!
  2.  The hairstyles, (Such as the queen whatever her name is) Had a weird style which could ONLY BE DONE WITH HAIRSPRAY OR MOOSE! They didn't have that back in the old days.
  3.  The actors were horrible.  I think all of them were each talentless.
  4.  Everybody was clean shaven.  Oh yeah, a lot of people were clean shaven back in those days.  I'm being sarcastic here.  Nobody was clean shaven in those days.
  5.  The blacksmith created a Nike symbol.  Oh yeah, nike.  Listen, Nike was considered a god in the mythological days, and the swoosh symbol of Nike was in there too.  Then, the shoe company took up the symbol and the name and the shoes became a bestseller.  No blacksmith created the nike symbol.
  6.  The characters were so unrealistic that It's unbelievable.
  7.  The main actor, Keith whatever, is no talent and he is a pretty boy.  He has no acting skills and the parts where he's trying to be dramatic is just laughable!
  8.  The story was predictable, and not to mention shallow.
  9.  I think that whoever made this movie, what company or what not, was probably just desperate for money.  The props were cheap and the acters were horrible, the story was, by all means, easy to reject and to hate.
  10.  The chances of seeing this movie? NEVER.  It was boring beyond belief.
  11.  It's a movie that's really embarrasing to own, I'm sure, and I'm thankful I don't have it.
  12.  The parts that are supposed to be comedic are just dull and not in any way laughable.
  13.  This is not a good romantic swashbuckling adventure.  I expected some good stuff in a fantasy, much like the old conan movies with Arnold.  They didn't do that, cuz whoever wrote the script can't write for dirt and plus the entire movie was just horrible.

2657411,2,B000IHYBT6,"This is a movie that could have been extremely entertaining, but all its potential is totally destroyed by the lousy choice of female actors. No, let me rephrase: by the choice of Shannyn Sossamon as Lady Jocelyn. Whoever it was who cast her--be it the director or producer or some moronic professional casting person--should be put into stocks and pelted with vegetables. Why would any audience in their right mind cheer for her when all she does is wax poetical, go through several costume changes, and be generally snotty? Especially when her own maid and the hero's personal blacksmith are both: a) Prettier, and b) Nicer? The character of Lady Jocelyn gets zero character treatment, resulting in a totally insincere, ridiculous love affair. And the film is sooooo overlong... *yawn*.
Another sticking point: shaky accents. Both hero and his love interest have glaringly fake, shabby accents. Shame, shame!
Now to the movie's redeeming factors, the Things That Earned It Its Two Measly Stars: Two things: 1. Cute historical and literary jokes and the odd odd mix of medieval and modern reality. 2. Great secondary characters. Take away Geoffrey Chaucer and the Prince of Wales, and this movie would've stunk. Take away the cute female blacksmith, the carrot-topped sidekick and Rufus Sewell, and it would've stunk even more. The rest of the cast were totally disposable. Heck, even Heath Ledger's cute little grin wouldn't have saved him.
The Verdict: It has its nice little moments and is generally watchable, but what an awful pity that Lady Jocelyn spoils everything. She makes the audience realize how much nicer it would be if our Hero got with her maid or his blacksmith, and it also makes them wonder about his judgement and clarity of thought.

I think the music and the dialogue were so universal that they transcended time yet were able grasp the viewer by the emotional jugular. This is a fantastic, magical and uplifting film. It teaches us all a thing or two about friendship, loyalty and perseverance and the honor one can gain by never quitting when the odds are against you.

My suspicions were confirmed in the first five minutes as not only the music but also the speech and mannerisms were anachronistic.
It seems to me, however, that as filming progressed the actors and directors became more serious about the film and its subject matter, and the anachronisms and cheesiness, though still present, were more subtle and ceased to detract from the film.  Instead, a rich emotional landscape emerged, and the characters became increasingly real and human.  The themes and characters were clearly intended to appeal to a modern audience, but they did an excellent job of it and I was on the brink of tears at a couple of touching scenes.  But, as other reviewers have pointed out, the comedy and anachronism separates it from other recent epics such as Gladiator and Braveheart.

Putting them together in this modestly serious movie is, however, just plain goofy and seriously adolescent.  I'd suggest that whoever came up with that idea not be rehired after he/she gets out of the stocks/dunking stool.
Otherwise it's an entirely enjoyable flick, and I've already run it through several times.  Actually I rented it the first time and liked so much, I ordered my own copy.  The depiction of Chaucer as someone a tad less elite than my English Lit professor portrayed was entertaining and refreshing.  And the whimsical notion of a commoner being knighted, although quite rare, isn't altogether untrue.  Enjoyable story with a more emotional bend as (Sir) William's conquests and travels bring him back home.  The jousts certainly looked real enough - how do you say Crunch!
An altogether pleasant medley of good guys and bad guys, the nobility and the common, as well as I tinge of less than earth-shattering romance, which flusters the hero now and again.

2657427,3,B000IHYBT6,"""A Knight's Tale"" was one of those movies that I wasn't too excited about seeing.  I dunno, I just wasn't looking forward to a film that I thought would be chock full of historical inaccuracies punctuated by knights calling each other ""dude"" all set to Queen power ballads.  There was no ""dude"" speak in the film (thank God for that, another ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"" we need not) but the ""rock and or roll"" was plentiful and surprisingly complementary.  I have to admit, I did find it a little strange in the first instance--the spectators at the jousting tournament doing the whole ""We will, we will, rock you"" thing.  But once I got used to the fact that this was part of the movie and the director was trying to be innovative I let it go.  ""A Knight's Tale"" is supposed to be a light-hearted adventure not a documentary on medieval knights after all.
  Anyhoo, the basic premise is about a peasant boy who wants to be a knight-- anyone who's seen the preview can tell you that.  Getting into a little more detail, the story begins with Will (Ledger), Roland (Addy), and Wat (Tudyk) who are introduced as three poor squires to a recently deceased knight who has been competing in a jousting tournament (and must only win one final match to win the tournament).  Caught in this situation, Will convinces Roland and Wat that he can impersonate the knight and complete the tournament in place of the dead knight.  Will wins the match (and the tournament) without being discovered (it is against the law for peasants to compete in the tournaments) and all three squires get a taste of the wealth that can be made by impersonating the knight and set off to the next tournament.
  Along the way they run into a naked Geoffrey Chaucer (Bettany) who teams up with them and becomes their promoter, a medieval version of Don King.  Chaucer is definitely the best character in the movie and provides a lot of wit and laughs.  The boys team up with a chick blacksmith too...she was a pretty shallow character (like most of the others now that I think about it) but there was only one major thing that bothered me about her.  She made some special armor for Will and she added her own little logo to it, for people to identify her work.....it was two Nike ""swooshes"".  I just thought that was a little ridiculous...but whatever.  Anyway, a little love story goes on between Will and some princess (Princess Jocelyn played by Sossamon) and a little unfriendly competition with (the token bad guy) Count Adhemar (Sewell) results.  But who will win the World Jousting Championship and Princess Jocelyn's heart?  And will Will be found out???  Tune in next week....I mean, see the movie to find out!
  Recommendation:  This is a fun, fun, fun film.  Shakespeare it ain't but to some people that may be a good thing.  The plot is acceptable, the characters are amusing (except for the Princess-I thought she was annoying), and the jousting action is definitely a large part of the film.  You'll laugh, you may even cry, but you'll definitely be entertained.  It's a good action/adventure movie with a good retro rock `n roll soundtrack.  Better than ""The Mummy Returns"" but not half as good as ""Gladiator"" (but what is?).",1020124800,,3217,4.6761565836298935

Other reviewers have commented about the anachronistic soundtrack and how delightful they found it, but it only annoyed me. Silly me (and sis) had come to see an authentic treatment of knights and pageants and got this unholy mess instead. Sis was particularly incensed at the buffoonish portrayal of Geoffrey Chaucer served up. That didn't have quite the resonance for me, but everyone has their issues, I guess. I was more ticked off at the stupid love interest woman who clearly thought she was ""all that"", and like all who entertain such ideas about themselves, she really wasn't. Why didn't they have Heath get together with the woman smithy who was making his groovy armor? They could've saved a salary and done something with the one truly interesting character at the same time.

The rock music set to the medieval setting was good and the Chaucer character was a very good one and interesting to watch (a supporting role).  Rufus Sewell also made an interesting villain.

2657430,3,B000IHYBT6,"A Knight's Tale is a tale of perseverance and courage, a rousing tale of romance and adventure, and is a film worth seeing. In spite of the film's negative aspects, seeing it is not a waste of time. A Knight's Tale is a film that successfully combines adventure, romance, drama, and comedy in a way that keeps you on the edge of your seat, wondering what will happen next
The flaws in this film are somewhat obvious. First and foremost, it is not authentic. The storyline is set in medieval 13th century England. In the beginning of the film there is a jousting tournament, and the spectators are actually singing the words to ""We Will Rock You"". That is not what I call authentic to a medieval 13th century England setting. Also, some of the dialogue is peppered with anachronistic idioms, and it seems that some of the characters are not as developed as others.
It is still my opinion, however, that this film is very exciting to watch. Personally, I would classify it as a thriller, and the way in which the storyline blends adventure, romance, drama, and comedy makes up for the flaws. A Knight's Tale is worth the purchase price, and although in my opinion, it doesn't climb to the level of a masterpiece, it is still a film not to be missed by anyone who loves adventure, romance, drama, and comedy.",1019260800,,1305,4.5574468085106385

2657436,5,B000IHYBT6,"So I had the chance to see two movies last Friday--the Mummy Returns and A Knight's Tale.  I chose the latter because I love watching movies set in that time period along with those set in the Renaissance and Regency periods, too, and lemme tell ya', i did not leave the theater disappointed.  It started out a little slow with the scene where William and his two friends are poking at a dead knight, but soon the audience was humorously greeted by the idle and stark naked wanderings of Geoffery Chaucer (suitably portrayed by Paul Bettany), who claims to be a writer.  And a few scenes later in the movie, his claims were rightly justified as he spurted out an invigorating,  impassioned, and slightly exaggerated speech (exaggerated in content, not quality) when announcing William (Heath Ledger) or rather Sir Ulrich von Liechenstein to the segregated crowd of aristocrats and paupers.  They could not have picked a better person to play the part of poet/orator Geoffery Chaucer.  He was entertaining and captivating to watch in a way that only the British accent could make possible.

Coming into the theater, I had the expectation that the movie would start out with a young Heath Ledger, as one would automatically assume from previews.  But as the first scene open, i saw Heath Ledger with a scraggly beard and long dirty blond hair, almost resembling the image Mel Gibson had presented in the phenomenal film ""Braveheart"", and i thought perhaps that they were showing an older, aged Heath, who, after years and years of distinguished fighting, was now a legend.  Of course my assumption was wrong, for Ledger was only a twenty-something young man with an overgrown beard. And then i thought to myself, well if he's already a grown man at the beginning of the film (not the 8-yr old boy i expected him to be) and if he's already doing a fight scene in the first fifteen minutes of it, then wat kind of intensified episodes will they be able to pull off when building up to the climax of the film (and with 2 more hours to go)?  the answer to that question was: as many as they pleased.  And they did it all with action-packed, fun-filled, falling-out-of-ur-seats-with-laughter class.
The movie was great.  The cast was great.  (Paul Bettany especially stood out.) The romance was sweet and comical (tho, i was kinda rooting for Heath to fall in love with the spunky female blacksmith--whose beauty was hidden under black ashes and brown shoot).  And the touch of adding dynamic 20th century music to the orthodox 14th century medieval period may at first seem way out of place and tacky, but once u see the peasants and the nobles alike grooving to the Queens' tunes u may begin to wonder if the director was trying to make a statement by bringing some subtle hints of class integration into the film, or if he just brought in ""We Will Rock You"" to attract youthful audiences.
But either way, he appealed to audiences of all genders and of all generations.  While A Knight's Tale may not be the greatest medieval movie ever made, it's definitely one worth watching.  (and i wouldn't mind a sequel--hint, hint) =P.",1016323200,,3121,4.730627306273063
2657437,3,B000IHYBT6,"Since you presumambly read the synopsis and the other reviews you know by now what this movie is about and will not be surprised by the modern music, dancing and occasionally costumes.

The acting and the characters (except for Jocelyn, the heroine) are unexpectedly good and very funny, and you can even forgive the totally forgettable and childish lines like ""he's blond, he's tanned, he comes from Gelderland"" and the like, which might amuse more a 10-year old. So, everything OK this far.
But Jocelyn... I wanted to shoot her during the entire movie. She always has the same expression on her face and is supposed to be smart and witty like the true ladies of the Middle Age, but she talks only charades at our poor hero and toys with him all the time: win this tournament for love, loose it for love etc. She just doesn't fit the role... imagine Helena Bonham Carter for such a role, she has the grace and dignity to do it. If a more likable actress would have been cast in this role, perhaps I could overlook all this, but she totally and completely annoyed me.

2657438,4,B000IHYBT6,"Director Brian Helgeland achieves what he set out to do:  to create a medieval tale that people of today--particularly young people of today--could relate to.  The driving pop music score, the language, the action, the dancing--all constructed to recreate the level of excitement that people must have felt during these tournaments in a way that makes sense to a 21st-century audience.
Apart from that, the film is, simply, a knight's tale, filled to overflowing with all that that implies:  action, romance, humor, villainy, pathos, tragedy, triumph.  It's Helgeland's unique vision that makes this film truly special.
The disc is loaded with wonderful extras--a dozen-or-so deleted/alternate scenes, several mini-documentaries on characters and effects and music and more, wonderful commentary tracks, and even a Queen (with Robbie Williams) music video.
Leave your prejudices at the door and see the film for what Helgeland intended it to be.  Smartly paced, snappy dialogue, fine performances--Paul Bettany as Chaucer and Mark Addy as Roland will have you smiling throughout, and you can't help but hiss at Rufus Sewell's Count Adhemar--a driving soundtrack and so much romance you'll wonder why Meg Ryan's not in it.

2657439,4,B000IHYBT6,"Mixing in a rock and roll soundtrack with a tale about the medieval sport of jousting may sound like a recipe for disaster, but A Knight's Tale manages to beat the odds and provide us with some tasty entertainment. Purists may argue that it grossly distorts history. There's really no argument because it does. The truth is that the movies have always done this. With few exceptions, historical epics have never reflected the values of the times they were set in. They've reflected modern values. As for the music they use, sweeping orchestral scores may feel more appropriate, but for any movie set more than four hundred years ago, these are almost as anachronistic as rock and roll. One could even argue that rock music is more in attuned to the bawdy tavern songs of the 14th Century, when A Knight's Tale takes place, than is classical fare.
William, Roland and Wat [Heath Ledger, Mark Addy and Alan Tudyk] are three peasants in service to an old knight who competes in jousts, which were popular games in England and France in the Middle Ages. Two knights in armor would charge each other on horseback and try knock each other to the ground with their lances. This was a dangerous game, but it was not a blood sport. Everyone was welcome to witness these events, but only noblemen could compete.
One morning, William and the others discover that their knight has died in his sleep. They can either let William take the knight's place in the game and try to fool the lords or they can starve to death. They chose the deception, and William wins the joust. Heady with victory, they begin to practice in earnest. The problem remains that William is not a knight, but in their travels they meet up with Chaucer [Paul Bettany], who later would become a very famous writer. Chaucer expertly forges papers that say William is royalty and then joins the trio as they travel around to various tournaments. Along the way, William falls for a beautiful noblewoman [Shannyn Sossaman]. He also makes an enemy of the evil Count Adhemer [Rufus Sewell], who vows revenge at any cost
The movie is an odd mixture of comedy, adventure, period history and parody, but it works. An early tournament starts out seriously, but then the crowd breaks out into The Wave. We see spectators with their faces painted as if they were pro football fanatics. A lovely female armorer, who wouldn't have existed back then, makes a new metal suit for our hero and engraves it with her trademark, which just happens to be the Nike logo. When William first dances with his lady love, rock music suddenly breaks out, and it looks like these long ago revelers are at a disco. If there is a fault with all this, it is that there isn't quite enough of it. Towards the end, the movie tends to become a more standard adventure, as if its makers were a bit uncertain of their own creation.
Heath Ledger is fine as William. This young Australian has a bright future in movies. In some scenes he looks eerily like Errol Flynn. Rufus Sewell is a lot of fun as the pompous villain. It is Paul Bettany's Chaucer, however, who virtually steals the movie.
I suspect director Brian Helgeland succeeded partly because he is blithely ignorant of many aspects of history. In an interview he said he thought kids in 14th Century had music that was not their parents' music just like kids today. That simply isn't true. Ironically, much of the rock music used in A Knight's Tale, such as Rock On and Golden Years, is the music of today's kids' parents. Fortunately for Helgeland, his limited view of history is irrelevant because the movie works. It isn't history. It's entertainment.",1015891200,,3633,4.669266770670827

Years later, William and his friends, Roland and Wat, discover the knight dead. Willing to take his place, William poses as the knight and wins. This sparks a growing interest in his mind, and William convinces his buddies to join him on his quest to become a champion jouster. Along the way, they encounter Geoffrey Chaucer, their match announcer, and Kate, a female blacksmith. William also begins to fall in love with the fair Jocelyn, hoping to win her heart. The only problem is is that he is not a noble knight, so he must continue this charade, until...
The story is set to rock music, such as Queen's ""We Will Rock You"" and dancing to David Bowie's ""Golden Years."" I think this accurately sets the mood and I can't help but smile every time the peasants clap at the jousting tournaments in unison.
Characters are nicely acted. The supporting characters had a lot of chemistry with each other, especially between Geoffrey and Wat (ok, not really). Shannyn Sossamon, who is a newcomer, did a nice job playing Jocelyn. The only thing that I did not enjoy watching in the film were the dramatic scenes. They didn't seem right and it seemed as if they were trying to slow the momentum.
All in all, 'A Knight's Tale' is something you can enjoy watching if you don't want something to sentimental or full of perverse jokes. It's a rollicking ride.",1013904000,,1838,4.5225225225225225

At the first opening scene I was SHOCKED and laughed histerically because it was hard for me to understand why they would combine modern elements to a specific place in time; but as I continued to watch it I understood the ENERGY the movie was trying to capture. It is very different so traditionalists beware. I would definitely recommend this to those who have more of an ""open mind"".

2657451,2,B000IHYBT6,"How could a movie with a brilliant cast, a great soundtrack, beautiful scenery and exciting action end up being quite dissapointing.  Easy.  I don't know whose fault it is, but this movie can never decide if it wants to be a comedy or a drama and therefore fails at being both.
The movie begins with Heath Ledger taking the place of a knight in a joust.  The crowd begins chanting ""We will Rock You"", and instantly you know this is going to be a different kind of movie.
I'm now prepared for a comedy, a different take on movies such as Gladiator and Robin Hood.  Heath Ledger's friends (including a young Geoffrey Chaucer) provide a lot of the humor and keep the laughs coming.
Then the standard plot takes over with Ledger battling another knight for the affections of a girl (who is supposed to be some sort of royalty.)  The girl ends up attending all of the jousts and Ledger wins her over.  But the other knight is still his main rival and the movie concludes with them jousting to see who will win.
This part of the movie turns into a drama.  Ledger returns to London to find his father and then people discover he isn't a knight.  Nothing is played for laughs here, and the sentimentality goes overboard.
Then the final jousting scene occurs and it is nothing like the many scenes early in the movie.  Nothing is done for laughs and there are no rousing intros by Chauser or crowds chanting modern day rock songs.  Instead the focus is between Ledger and his rival Knight.
Somewhere about two thirds through the movie, it quit being funny and started being serious.  The movie lost me there because I didn't want it to be serious.  I wanted it to be clever and funny like the first parts of the movie.",1013126400,,1709,4.4423076923076925

2657453,2,B000IHYBT6,"This is a rather pleasant film set in a non existant fairy tale world. It features the Black Prince and Chaucer as characters but has nothing to do with history as we know it. The action takes place around jousting tournaments which give out large prizes. It is a sporting story transposed back into an ancient time.
Our hero is a peasant who after the unexpected death of his boss a real knight dons his armour to win a tournament. He decides to try to make a living out of it. He runs into Geoffery Chaucer who he pays to fake a aristocrat background. (Only the nobs can compete)
The main plot of the film is based around a rivalry between the hero played by Heath Ledger and a villian with a German name. Bound up in the rivalary over who is the best at jousting is a desire to wed the female lead.
The film is strange the way it interweaves pop music and jousting performances and the female lead who dresses in contempory clothing. Still the themes of the film, a work ethic is more important than where you are born, and its good to be loyal to family are harmless enough.
But its hard to take that a woman could be a blacksmith in the time period suggested or that the heroine would be allowed the indepandance that she is in this film.",1012003200,,1243,4.271186440677966

2657459,4,B000IHYBT6,"Apparently audiences couldn't quite figure out A Knight's Tale when it had its theatrical release last year. This was in all likelihood due to the combination of rock music in ancient times clashing with our knowledge of history and our delicate sensibilities. However, having both seen this at the cinema and owning it on DVD, I would like to hope that this movie will be given a second chance to win new viewers as it really is a good film and great fun!
Heath Ledger (The Patriot) displaying great charm and a winning smile throughout, plays William Thatcher, squire to a washed up champion jouster, who dies during a competition, leaving William to masquerade as his master in order to collect their winnings. Aided by his initially less than enthusiatic pals Roland (Mark Addy from Full Monty) and Wat (Alan Tudyk, 28 Days) William fakes nobility to illegally enter competitions. On their travels they encounter a naked wanderer, the future famed author, Geoffrey Chaucer (Paul Bettany) who joins their `crusade' and helps to forge William's ancestral lineage, so that he can take part in the noblemen only games. Whilst competing (according to my wife who seems to like every Australian film star) the very handsome William catches the eye of a lady, Jocelyn (the very beautiful Shannyn Sossamon), and sets out to win her heart. However, standing between William and his two goals of winning the World Championships and winning the hand of Lady Jocelyn stands the dastardly Count Adhemar (brilliantly played by Rufus Sewell, Dark City).
This is a surprising change of direction for writer/Director Brian Helgelend (LA Confidential). This movie is great fun and the mixture of rock music (they sing, clap and stamp Queen's We Will Rock You before each joust) and medieval times works surprisingly well, adding to the excitement and atmosphere of each competition. Both Heath Ledger and Shannyn Sossamon shine in their lead roles and share excellent on-screen sexual chemistry. However, it is Paul Bettany who steals most scenes as the occasionally naked, always in trouble, lyrical Geoffrey Chaucer. Also watch out for James Purefoy in a relatively small role (but tipped for greater things)!
Extra features on the DVD include a light-hearted commentary from Brian Helgeland and Paul Bettany, where they reveal some of the FX tricks of the trade and hear Helgeland feign ignorance of the fact that they didn't dance to David Bowie in 1366 or play Queen's ""We Will Rock You"" at jousting tournaments. There is also a passable documentary and some excellent deleted scenes and a music video where Britains most popular of current musical stars Robbie Williams performs Queen's ""We Are the Champions"" with all the pomp and grandiosity of Freddie Mercury, outlining why he is considered natural heir to Mercury's throne as Britains Greatest Showman.
Four stars for the movie (five stars are far too often and easily dispensed), four stars for the extras. Well worth checking out.",1009756800,,2979,5.069246435845214
2657460,3,B000IHYBT6,"***1/2 It seems that every few years or so Hollywood attempts to revive a moribund genre by coming up with a film that blends traditional elements with those of modern teen movies.  This principle is based on the assumption that, since adolescents provide the source of most of the box office revenue for the industry's few yearly mega-blockbusters, all a studio need do is craft its films in any given genre to reflect that key demographic's interests and it will come up with a winner.  This has been tried, with varying degrees of success, with the western (""Young Guns"") and the swashbuckler (""The Three Musketeers""), to name but a few, and now we have the same principle being applied to the medieval romance in Brian Helgeland's 2001 film, ""A Knight's Tale.""
I must confess that I wasn't exactly bowled over by this film in its first hour.  It wasn't that I objected to the filmmakers' use of popular music from the 1970's and `80's as a background for the 14th Century action.  In fact, I rather liked the fact that the film found a unique and interesting way to employ anachronism in a time when audiences seem incapable of identifying with people of the past if they don't speak, act or behave exactly as we do.  No, what I mostly objected to was the fact that the film didn't really seem to know what to do with its concept and that, by the sixth scene of knights jousting, I was pretty much ready to pack up and go home.  Yet, slowly but surely, the film finds both its tone and its footing and becomes an extremely likable romantic tale, overflowing with charm, sentiment and an air of goodwill that becomes quite irresistible.
Despite the modern touches around its edges, ""A Knight's Tale"" has solid old-fashioned values at its core.  Heath Ledger stars as William Thatcher, a lowly knight errant who, upon the unexpected death of his master, decides he wants to be a knight himself, even though the law forbids all but nobility and royalty from assuming that title.  Armed with his own band of bumbling, good-natured merry men, Thatcher strikes out to make a name for himself on the jousting circuit, winning the love of the beautiful Jocelyn in the process.  As in most traditional medieval romances, we have blonde, blue-eyed virtue embodied by Thatcher doing battle against dark-haired villainy in the form of the evil Count Adhemar (Rufus Sewell) - all for the love of a fair lady.
""A Knight's Tale"" works because it never takes itself too seriously.  It would be hard for any film to take itself too seriously when it has medieval peasants rocking out to Queen's stadium classic ""We Will Rock You"" at the start of a tournament, elite nobles dancing to David Bowie's ""Golden Years"" at a formal ball, and our heroes re-entering the city of London to the antic strains of Thin Lizzy's ""The Boys are Back in Town"" on the eve of a great jousting contest.  By calling such obvious attention to its anachronisms, the film manages to sustain its youthful, playful spirit throughout.  Even the emphasis on modernistic feminist ideals seems less forced than it otherwise might in a film with a different, more serious tone.  Yet, the film takes its romance very seriously, as evidenced by the fact that the courtship between Thatcher and Jocelyn is played out with an air of genuine affection and sweetness.  Moreover, Roland, Wat, Kate and even Geoffrey Chaucer (yes, THAT Geoffrey Chaucer) serve as wonderful and endearing sidekicks for the intrepid hero.
""A Knight's Tale"" is a film that takes a bit of getting used to.  But if you stick with it like I did, I think you will be pleasantly surprised and rewarded.",1009670400,,3624,4.72107765451664
2657461,3,B000IHYBT6,"First and foremost, this film is not trying to grab an Oscar; it is not trying to be deemed the most historically accurate film of all time; it is merely trying to entertain (think MTV, think Jim Carrey comedy, think Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie). So, this is a ""flick,"" not a film by any means. How does it rate there?
The film opens with ""We Will Rock You,"" which may jarr a few audience members. This is a conglomeration of the old and the new: costumes, language, and people will be painfully anachronous. Acceptable? Unforgivable? It depends on how badly one needs to relax and just enjoy some mindless fun. No summary will be given here, as there are plenty contained in previous reviews.
The it-listed Heath Ledger plays William Thatcher, a role that does not demand much acting muscle; however, Ledger does his job well playing an ambitious young pauper-turned-hero. Newcomer Shannyn Sossamon plays his romantic interest, Jocelyn, with more frigidity than expected. She has obvious charisma and charm, but it would have been the film's benefit if she had played the role with a little more warmth rather than her adoption of the archetypal cold princess persona. The real stars are the actors who portray Geoffrey Chaucer (Paul Bettany) and Count Adhemar (Rufus Sewell). The virtually unknown Bettany shows his acting chops in this film, stealing the show with his vibrancy. The talented Sewell could have played the humdrum villainous without any spark, but he manages to bring sympathy to the role.
Is this another manufactured flick that follows the 1-2-3 formula? Yes, but the key word here is ""energy."" A tedious medieval dance that segues into David Bowie's ""Golden Years"" only invites audience glee. As for the negatives: Thatcher's childhood scenes are plopped down in inappropriate places, which screams director Brian Helgeland's attempt for a saccharine moment (""Now, everyone, this is where you 'aww' and shed a little tear, okay?""). The only positive arising from this is Christopher Cazenove's genuine performance as John Thatcher, William's father. Someone cast this man in a serious and dramatic film.
The jousting scenes, intially thrilling, quickly become tiring and repetitive - how many times can a person see splinters a-flying in slow motion? In addition, the fact that a month is enough time for an unpolished knight wannabe to become an unbeatable knight is somewhat eyebrow-lifting, but then again, this is a movie.
The verdict: the characters are fun, the love story somewhat interesting, and the lines are sometimes funny. However, ultimately the anachronistic music hurts the film, as it brings the film from the ""just good fun"" level to the ""man, this is really ridiculous"" level. The film is energetic and fun without the ""aid"" of Queen, thank you very much. This is a good flick - a great film? The absolute best? No, not by a long shot.

2657465,1,B000IHYBT6,"This is a movie that disappoints.  The ...reviewer incomprehensibly refers to director Brian Helgeland's first movie (Payback w/ Mel Gibson) as bad compared with this.  Payback isn't a four star movie by any means, but it was at least clever and original.  This movie is utterly predictable at every turn.  Every character is one-dimensional and entirely unbelievable.  The biggest twist in the movie comes at the end when it is revealed that the main character's lifelong friends don't care whether he dies.
""Oh, you wan't to joust without armor?  Okay.  Go ahead.  I see no reason to argue.  I mean what possible harm could a staff do if it is thrust into your chest or head by somebody who has it anchored to a horse in a full run?  Yes, well, go ahead then.""
First Ledger's character is described as having no technique (at jousting) and then, maybe a month later, is described as absolutely unbeatable.  Bear in mind he is jousting in the world championship with people that have trained their whole lives to do nothing but joust professionally.
Speaking of the jousts -- this is a movie about jousting.  The audience gets the chance to watch about 45 minutes worth of virtually identical runs down a center divide on a horse with people getting hit with sticks.  We also get to watch white flags be put up over and over again.  I cannot stress enough how little variety can be added to jousting matches to make them watchable on screen over and over and over, etc...
The love story is ridiculous and never once conveys any true feelings.  Heath sees the pretty girl.  Heath's charms begin to win girl.  Heath, for no reason ever even hinted at in the movie, begins yelling multiple insults at point-blank range to the girl he has been absolutely infatuated with since he first saw her and she storms away crying.
Now the movie is set up for Heath to win her back.  This is where the film get's romantic.  The girl asks Heath to sit on his horse and do nothing while one after another javelin are rammed into his chest by charging knights on horses.  Heath is nearly killed while the girl watches-cringing/grinning the whole time.  He is in such bad shape after doing as he is asked by his love interest that when she sees him she thinks he is in danger of dying, then he makes love to her.

Heath Ledger is a peasant who worms his way into the knight class and is suddenly an unstoppable jouster after practicing really hard for only a month. By beating everyone who comes in his path he is sure to make his mark in the tournament championship.
The jousting scenes are nicely done and shot, but there's an endless amount of them! One after another after another. A third of the film's running time would be cut out if they only gave us a streamlined version. It gets tiring seeing the same joust situation over and over again.
Another gripe of mine is that I thought this movie was supposed to have a level of campy humor. It might have, but I didn't see it. There are as many ""funny"" lines as I have fingers on my hands. There's too few lines of humor to make it campy so it's pulled back into a mediocre drama.
The characters aren't much to care for either, especially Heath Ledger's romantic interest. She's royalty and thus is to wrapped up in herself. She's too cold for the audience to like.
There might be some entertainment for some groups in this. A positive to this movie is in the skill the jousts are executed, but besides a swordfight, those are the only action scenes in the movie and they get old real fast.

Then you are on the edge of your seat with the action scenes. You find yourself rooting for the underdog and cheering when he defeats his opponents with class.  Health Ledger portrays this young man with such grace and innocence. His sidekicks are relentless in their support for him despite their lack of optomism. The love story within is sweet and at the same time the writers throw in some new age/rock edge.  The dance scene to David Bowie is none surpased.  Dirty Dancing Renasaince style.

2657484,4,B000IHYBT6,"As others have already said, this movie is a lot of fun. Here's the surprise - Heath Ledger (William) can act. (sorry for the prejudice against his pretty face...I just assumed that's the reason he got the role.) He's got a spark that you can't deny and he's got some beautiful, honest moments. (SPOILER: Look for an amazing reaction at the end of the film when the prince speaks to him. You'll know what I mean when you see it. So honest. Gorgeous. I watched it over and over.)
Paul Bettany as Chaucer - brilliant. Be sure to watch the deleted scenes so you can hear more of his monologues. I'd see anything this man was in. Also, watch for Adhemar's herald. His character is influenced by Chaucer throughout the film. Really good stuff. For the best of this herald, watch the deleted scenes.
The rest of William's group (Kate, Roland and Wat) is delightful as well. I liked them and found myself cheering for them.
Two things didn't work for me - the villain (played by Rufus Sewell) is, well, too villainous. I think it was written that way and not Sewell's doing. The ladylove of William (Jocelyn, played by Shannyn Sossamon) is dreadful. But the Heath is so good that I found myself able to look past her acting and see Jocelyn through William's eyes.",1005091200,,1256,4.537444933920705

2657486,5,B000IHYBT6,"Movie Summary: William Thatcher is a squire. He is part of the ""pit crew"" for a knight. They make enough money to eat by winning at jousting tournaments. When William's knight dies right before his last run in a tournament leaving him and the other two squires with nothing but the promise of empty bellies, William takes his place in order to feed them. He succeeds and it goes to his head. He convinces the other two squires to continue the charade. From tournament to tournament they go pretending that William is of noble birth so that he can compete. Along the way they make friends as well as enemies. In the end they all learn that nobility isn't found on a piece of paper but is instead found in the heart.
My Opinion: I found this movie to be awesome! For reasons which I will try to relate, I just love it. The movie opens with an eye rolling scene in which the peasant fans at a jousting match are singing and clapping along to the Queen classic ""We will rock you"". I thought I was in for a stinker at this point, but the movie hit its stride instantly after this. Two of the great things about A Knight's Tale are the characters and their relationships. The three main characters William, Roland, and Wat are very likable and their relationship is great. The friendship that they have is very cool and their interaction is very entertaining. When Geoffrey Chaucer is added to make it a foursome, it only gets better. Chaucer is played perfectly by Paul Bettany. He is instantly likable and adds color to every scene he is in. Next we get Kate, the female blacksmith trying to make it in a male dominated profession and world. She adds depth to the group of friends. The camaraderie between this team spilled off the screen and infected me. As for the bad guy, he's just bad enough. This may sound simple, but it's so often mishandled. He's not a buffoon, and he's not so evil that it throws the entire balance of the movie off. He's well done.  The plot is also something that is very easy to screw up. In A Knight's Tale, the plot is also well done. There is a well defined conflict, and goal. The story steadily moves forward toward the goal and a resolution of the conflict. Nothing too bad happens to the heroes and the villain doesn't get the upper hand for too long. All this sounds simple, but any one of them can ruin a movie. Here they all serve to make it better. Finally, and probably most importantly, it's entertaining. It grabbed a hold of me and didn't let go. I went right out and bought the DVD after watching the rental one because I had to have it in my collection.
DVD Quality: Widescreen Anamorphic 1.85:1 with excellent video quality, Sound is DD5.1. Extras include deleted scenes which fill out a couple of areas of the plot, trailer, production notes, making of featurettes, music video, and commentary. The menus are cool making the entire DVD a really great release.
What You Should Do:  See this movie. The DVD is awesome and well worth the price, so don't hesitate to buy it.

So I bought it on DVD, and boy was I in for a surprise! I loved this movie from the start, it reminded me of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and I loved it so much, I think I've watched it 5 times in the past week alone! I am really gald that I have seen it now, and I was also pleasantly surprised to find a cerain family member's music video on the DVD too.

2657488,4,B000IHYBT6,"Writer director Brian Helgelenad delivers a wonderful, anachronistic fable about determining your own destiny in ""A KNIGHT'S TALE"" (Columbia Tristar...). This rousing and often very funny medieval tale with contemporary attitudes and 70s music really works as a satisfying action adventure.  Heath ledger is fine as determined William Thatcher, the peasant squire who assumes a nobleman's identity to compete in the jousting world, achieve knighthood  and win the hand of a maiden (newcomer Shannyn Sossamon).  Rufus Sewell is the serious and intimidating bad knight and jousting champion to beat, Alan Tudy and Mark Addy are terrific as Thatcher's sidekicks. Paul Bettany stands out as a mostly naked and road weary Geoffrey Chaucer.  If you waited to see this on DVD, turn up the volume and sit back because the 14th century rocks.  A plethora of bonus material includes deleted scenes, commentary from Helgeland and Bettany, a music video, making-of special and 11 behind the scenes featurettes (watch a gap toothed Helegeland explain how Ledger knocked his tooth out while practicing a jousting move with a broomhandle.)",1004832000,,1124,5.363636363636363
2657489,4,B000IHYBT6,"If you're a stickler for historical accuracy, a lot of things about A Knights Tale will annoy you.  I am normally one of those people - but I really liked this film.  It's major redeeming feature is the jousting.  The jousting action is worth the watch and then some.  This film takes you further into the sport of the joust than any other period piece.  It lets you in and opens your eyes to the fact there was more to jousting than most people ever thought.
The 70's rock soundtrack at first may seem silly.  But surprisingly, after a while, it works - and it even seems to fit with the story - like the knights arriving back in London to Thin Lizzy's ""The Boys Are Back In Town"".  You will even find yourself thinking its not that out-of-place after all.
Some of the ""modern touches"" are over the top, though, and don't seem to belong at all (airhorns and Nike swooshes are only the beginning).  Foremost of these is the wardrobe of the herione, Jocelyn.  All other characters are dressed to fit the period, which makes her outrageous medieval/Versace creations and punk hairdos harder to accept.  In one scene, the hair makes her look more like a papillon dog than a woman.  Her costumes go from mildly modern in the beginning scenes, and get more and more outlandish as the movie progresses.
Heath Ledger, for a young up-and-comer, is marvelous in the lead role of William.  He fits the role perfectly.  I can't think of another young actor who could have done this with the same flair and style, yet with a serious,historical bent. A first-rate performance.
Some of the more incongruous modern touches notwithstanding, this movie, as its tag line proclaims, will rock you.",1004659200,,1678,4.628378378378378

However, the DVD added that much more to my enjoyment of the movie. Learning about the complexities and the time it took to do the jousting scenes really made me appreciate the effort put in to this great movie. This movie is one of those that come along only every once in a while and the DVD will add greatly to your experience. Make this part of your DVD collection now, because in ten years, it will truly be a classic.",1004572800,,591,4.333333333333333
2657500,5,B000IHYBT6,"I initially saw this movie simply because I love the medieval era and nearly everything associated with it.  I wasn't too sure whether the 80's soundtrack would work well with this type of movie, however I was soon convinced of the pure genius of it.  It is basically a Cinderella story of a poor boy who becomes a knight.  What surprised me was how humor was woven into the movie and how it's scenes were phenomenal (although that may be just because I love the medieval era).  This movie did have one area which I actually hated.  It took place at a dance where our hero is put on the spot to dance.  He begins dancing with our fair lady and the music is of that age, but then, of all times to switch it to another style of music, it switches to some horrible 80's song and all the dancers begin to do modern dances.  I feel that the modern dancing in a movie such as this ruined that particular scene.  Otherwise, the humor is wonderful, the storyline better, and the ending is of course well worth it.  Other than that one bad scene, it's definitely worth the buy.  I haven't bought it yet, (due to budget constraints), but it's on my personal to-do list.",1004227200,,1159,4.324074074074074
2657501,3,B000IHYBT6,"The one thing I can say for this film is that it didn't stick to the rules. The writers and producers thought they would just go for it, pretty much ignoring every rule of filmaking there is. The 3 act structure, blatant anachronisms...who cares? However, the movie's best function is to remind us of why we DO have rules, because in several areas the film fell flat. We basically saw the ending ""climax"" of the film actually happen twice - once 20 minutes in and once at the alleged ""climax,"" which is why the 3-act structure really does work better than whatever this film tried to do. And also because of the strange structure of the film and because of basically poor writing, me and the 2 other people I was with were able to precisely predict *exactly* what the ending of this film would be, only 30 minutes into it.
In addition, and this is a matter of opinion only, I did not particularly enjoy watching medieval peasants dance and clap along to ""We Will Rock You"" and ""The Boys Are Back in Town.: To use those songs in a film of this type is daring enough, but to actually involve the characters in the songs was distracting. And the costumes were somewhat bizarre too. The female lead usually looked like she was wearing something out of a 1987 Liz Claiborne factory store, and her hair? Well, I was reminded of my high school posters of Alyssa Milano.
I don't know. People seem to like the film but in my opinion it failed in many respects.",1004227200,,1451,4.438202247191011
2657502,4,B000IHYBT6,"There's nothing particularly deep about this movie.  No profound messages about exploring the darker side of the human soul, or any of that gobbledygook.  Oh sure, there's a little socio-political jab at the idea of class distinctions and social elitism, but that's as serious as it gets.  The rest of the movie is just plain fun.
The story centers around William Thatcher, a young peasant-born squire who has a natural talent for jousting and a dream to rise above his humble circumstances.  With the aid of a small band of trusty friends, including the inimitable Geoffrey Chaucer, our young hero sets off to make his mark on a noble man's world. And what a mark he makes!
Of course, there's the obligatory girl to be won, and the dashingly handsome but utterly ruthless rival to compete with for her hand.  The action scenes are well done if somewhat repetitive (there are only so many ways to depict a joust), but of course the focus is on the final meeting between the good guy and the bad guy.  The plot is not particularly complicated, although there is one neat twist toward the end of the movie that makes you cheer for ""our side.""  Some of the characters are extremely funny, and provide great comic relief throughout.
By the way, this one's suitable for the whole family.  No strong language or blood-n-guts, but there are a couple brief scenes with some backside nudity.  Overall, though, it's just good clean fun and extremely entertaining.  It won't appeal to the deep intellectual or the movie critic in you, but who cares?",1004140800,,1538,4.726591760299626
2657503,1,B000IHYBT6,"What was Heath Ledger thinking when he decided to participate in this movie?  Was Rufus Sewall perhaps high when he read this script?  I'll put aside most of my objections too the extreme historical inaccuracies in this movie because they were clearly intentional.  Afterall one cannot accidentally have a scene in medieval France where the spectators sing ""we will rock you"".  You have to be going for a certain style, no matter how painful that style happens to be.
The costumes and makeup seemed really excellent and accurate next Shannyn Sossamon's stiff and extremely unsympathetic potrayal of William Thatcher's love interest Jocelyn.  Jocelyn is herself sadistic, annoying, a bad dresser, and just not that pretty.  In every scene her clothing gets more bizarre and increasingly becomes something that no one, in any era, would or should wear.  In my opinion, anyone with any pretention to taste would have dumped Jocelyn by the wayside for the much more interesting Kate or even Jocelyn's servant/messanger girl.  Why waste your time on a girl with no good qualities?
Every scene involving William's father is cheap, each one more pathetic than the last.  William's father sends young William away so he can fufill his dream of becoming a knight.  When he returns home he finds his loving father blind and alone.  Finally father comes just in time to support his dear son during Will's most important match.  God, can't you just see the tears welling up in my eyes.
If this movie has any redeeming qualities, and all movies do, it's Paul Bettany's fun portrayal of Jeffrey Chaucer.  This Chaucer is a compulsive gambler as well as a writer and WWF style announcer.  He gets maximum points for clever banter while completely naked.
All around, A Knight's Tale is an extremely hurtful movie with occasional bright spots.  Please skip it no matter how much you like Heath Ledger.",1003708800,,1884,4.955414012738854
2657504,1,B000IHYBT6,"I am absolutely amazed at people who think this is a great movie, or even a good movie, or even an entertaining somewhat fun movie. What really scares me is that some who see this movie may think its an accurate depiction of the middle ages. I can see if it were supposed to be a farce, a spoof on the time period--but even then the story was bland. But there was no historical accuracy at all, save for maybe the jousting scenes. And we certainly were treated to enough of those. The language, clothing (loved the see through dress on the princess--I'm sure that was the rage in medieval France), mannerisms and especially, the place of women. Yes, princesses and upper class women just roamed the streets unescorted, traveled all over the country and beyond, had strange men bringing them notes in their bedroom and had sex whenever they wanted. In reality, Ulrich/William wouldn't have been able to get near that woman, and in fact, probably never would've even laid eyes on her because she wouldn't have been out on the street! I don't understand the reason for this movie--why make it take place in the middle ages if nothing at all is accurate? It reminded me of a bunch of people just dressing up for a costume party on a Hollywood set. There is no feeling at all that you are in another place and time.
Aside from that, the acting is pretty bland and the character lukewarm. Especially unappealing is Jocelyn, who is so moronic and dull, and not particularly good looking. It really pushes the imagination as to why William would be so enthralled with her. His groupie Kate the blacksmith was far more attractive and interesting, although I tend to doubt there were any female blacksmiths at the time. Her clothes and hairdo reminded one more of a women from the American wild west, several centuries later. All in all, an awful movie. We fast forwarded it after a while, just to get to the final scene and hoping beyond hope, that he'd get rid of Jocelyn and get it on with Kate.",1003708800,,1988,4.555865921787709

If you're looking for a couple of hours of mindless frivolity, this is the place. The cast looks as though they are having the time of their lives.",1003708800,,424,4.51948051948052
2657506,4,B000IHYBT6,"This highly enjoyable, fairy tale of a film revolves around the efforts of William, a tanner's son, trying to change his destiny. His father gave him up into servitude to a knight, when William was a slip of a lad, in hopes of his having a better future. When he grows up, William, remembering his father's advice, reaches for the stars in an effort to become what he has always dreamed of being, a knight in shining armor.

Played to perfection by the very hunky and charismatic Heath Ledger, William gets his big break when the knight, whom he serves, dies during a jousting competition. Donning his knight's armor and substituting secretly for the knight, he handily, though clumsily, wins the competition and its purse. He persuades Roland and Wat, the other two vassals who also served the now dead knight, to assist him in his efforts to continue competing. They reluctantly agree and begin helping him train for future jousting competitions. William, however, needs credentials establishing his knighthood in order to compete, as mere peasants are prohibited to do so. He has the good fortune to run into a man of letters, Geoffrey Chaucer, who happens to be a bit down on his luck. Chaucer agrees to provide him with forged patents in order to enter tournaments.

William, playing the role of a knight named Ulric Von Lichtenstein, becomes a force with which to be reckoned on the playing field. This does not pass unnoticed by an evil knight, Count Adhemar, played with deliciously wicked malice by Rufus Sewell, who does not hesitate to play dirty on and off the field, if necessary, in order to win. William, however, plays his role most honorably and nobly.

William falls in love with the Lady Jocelyn, whom Sewell also covets and intends to marry, but Lady Jocelyn, played by lovely newcomer, Shannyn Sossamon, may be falling for our erstwhile hero. This turn of events makes Count Adhemar all the more determined to win on and off the field. When a jousting competition brings them all to William's hometown, Adhemar pulls out all the stops in an effort to settle the matter once and for all.

This is truly a fun film. The viewer can't help but love the ever so earnest William, played by the simpatico and romantically handsome Heath Ledger. Paul Bettany, as the insouciant and scampish Chaucer, very nearly steals the film, so terrific is he in his role. Rufus Sewell is both sexy and ruthless as the unprincipled and haughty Count Adhemar. The rest of the supporting cast is likewise superb, with the exception of Shannyn Sossamon who does not seem to fit the role of one to the manor born.

While the plot seems somewhat formulaic, it is made new by the interjection of modern day music and customs. Watch as the crowd gathered for the jousting competition stomps, claps, and does the ""wave"" in time to Queen's rousing song, ""We Will Rock You"". See Chaucer act as a modern day huckster for his knight, working the crowd to a fever pitch. Look to the dance led by William at a post jousting reception at the local castle. Likewise, Jocelyn's costumes, at times, resemble haute couture. These modern day interjections that occur throughout the film, though jarring, keep this age old story fresh and funny. It is difficult not to enjoy this film, as it is infectious in its charm.",1003622400,,3298,4.7486910994764395

2657509,5,B000IHYBT6,"""A Knight's Tale"" is among the better films to come out in 2001, and certainly the highlight of the year's summer lineup. It is an irreverent take on Medeival jousting (and the Canterbury Tales) that is at once hilarious and inspirational. I have never seen a film that can juggle Python-esque humor and Gladiator-esque emotion so well - nor have I seen a film that has even attempted it, let alone met with success!
Heath Ledger plays William Thatcher, a churl who disguises himself that he might enter the jousting championships and ""change his stars"" (for only those of noble birth are permitted to compete). He is joined by a wonderful cast of characters, including ""Jeff"" Chaucer, his ""squires,"" and a female blacksmith. Other principle characters include William's noble love interest and the wicked Count who is his rival for her affections. Rarely does a film offer so many colorful players.
Purists, of course, will not care much for a Knight's Tale given its incorporation of classic rock-and-roll music, but to everyone else, it will most likely be a welcome addition. Given the tone of the film, it does not seem at all out of place - not even when things take a turn for the dramatic.

Never taking itself too seriously ""A Knight's Tale"" manages to pull off a presentation which is lighthearted, exciting and also amusing.  I particularly enjoyed the inclusion of Geoffrey Chaucer, roving poet and wit, who finds himself employed as Herald to our hero Knight with amusing effect.  The film moves along at a fair pace and keeps the level of action and interest high as well as bringing in a frisson of romance.

2657512,2,B000IHYBT6,"""A Knight's Tale"" is reasonably entertaining as a pseudo-postmodern story, but it never overcomes its main problem.
The movie tells us that William wants to become something other than a peasant (and inherent in the class system is the assumption that if he isn't a peasant or artisan then he must be a noble), but it apparently hasn't occurred to anyone (writer, director, producer, etc.) that he doesn't actually want to become a *knight* -- knights rode off on Crusades and died in battle and were responsible for the oversight and taxation of people like William and his friends. What William wants to achieve has nothing to do with honor.
No, William wants to be a star.
Wrap a thick layer of honor-speak around this and it becomes a bit much.
The music is fun. The anachronisms are fun. Watching Chaucer introduce Sir Ulrich as though he were WWF fodder is fun.
But in the end, there just isn't enough fun to hide the empty core of the film.
When his squires rouse William's ire against an opponent by mentioning the opponent's excesses and crimes against the peasantry, William knocks the man from his horse. Go William! That'll show him to be fair to his servants!
Inexplicably, William turns his righteous anger against Jocelyn and her lifestyle while still unable to see the hypocrisy of his own choices. Her riposte is memorable, almost as if the screenwriter was letting us in on what he was unconsciously thinking about the story.

Language used, music, and dances from both the present and the past combine to give this movie an edgy and sort of magical feel. The sets and extras are equally stunning. With the extras fully costumed and sets like the times, one watching might feel like they are right there in the jousting arena. Heath Ledger gives such a confident and remarkable performance, I would watch it just to see him act! The rest of the cast features old and new faces that help this movie become better and better. Although the actress who plays William's(Heath Ledger) love is dreadfully disappointing, the ""comic releifs"" are very amusing. This movie may have little suspense and is fairly predictable, but I think that anyone who watches it will smile at least 2 or 3 times and admit that they enjoyed it. But enough reading.

The pity is that the story had possibilities.  A squire seizes upon the opportune death of his knight to enter a jousting competition and ultimately, albeit illegitimately, establish himself as a top competitor.  William/Ulrich (Heath Ledger) begins the film with no skills whatever and with the help of his hapless lads, miraculously is transformed into a lean mean jousting machine.  He is then thunderstruck by the utterly bland Jocelyn (Shannyn Sossamon) and spends the rest of the film trying to win her love.  Meanwhile Kate (Laura Fraser), the only interesting female character, with excellent potential for an intriguing romantic entanglement, is relegated to becoming Williams groupie.
Despite good potential for a serious medieval drama, Helgeland decides that it should follow a rutted and unimaginative formula so that it will appeal to all those millions who have loved this same story in different forms countless times before.  As if that isn't enough, he further debases it by filling it with anachronistic contemporary dialogue (Oh Wow, Helllllloooo, Foxy Lady, etc.) and rock music to which all the medieval peasants join in to sing along and boogie.  This wouldnt be so bad if the film was constructed to be a spoof, but after each of these absurd digressions, Helgeland switches back into drama mode, asking us once again to take his characters seriously.
Helgeland cant seem to decide whether he wants this to be a farce, a send up, or a serious drama.  It is all out of sync.  The film is funny when it is trying to be serious and dull when it is trying to be funny.  I don't even want to get into how historically unrealistic his depiction of medieval Europe is.  The only redeeming quality of Helgelands direction is the stunt work on the jousting scenes.  The jousting is brilliantly done and (of course) unabashedly overused.  After a couple of dozen broken lances, it is hard to get up for the final match between William and the evil Count Adhemar as all the spectacle has been wrung out.  It would be like having 25 chariot races in Ben-Hur and asking us to be excited about the 26th race against Messala.
Heath Ledger is airy and adorable as William, qualities I know I always associate with medieval knights (sarcasm intended).  Ledger plays the part with such lack of force that it is difficult to believe the rushing wind didn't knock him off his horse long before the opponents lance hit the mark.  Shannyn Sossamon is pretty, but equally mind-numbing.  Their romance has all the heft of balsa wood and all the maturity of a date to the Junior Prom.
Paul Bettany steals what is left of the show with his spirited portrayal of Chaucer.  Bettany provides us with a most remarkable interpretation of the celebrated author, whipping the crowds into frenzy with his commanding introductions.  Rufus Sewell is a passable villain, but comes across more obnoxious than despicable.
Overall, this film is so utterly insubstantial and obsequious to the masses that it had to be a hit.  This is another typical Hollywood cotton candy film, sweet with no substance.  It is charming, light, and predicable, giving everyone exactly what they want and expect.  I rated it a 4/10 including a point for the great stunt work.  Serious filmgoers are cautioned to lower their expectations.",1002672000,,3633,5.0183333333333335
2657517,3,B000IHYBT6,"""A Knight's Tale"" is a silly little movie that has a rock and roll heart and soundtrack.  It's a bit offbeat in that sense.  Hearing ""We will Rock you"" in a knight movie seemed a bit strange to me at first, but I just decided to try and enjoy this movie for what it was...a somewhat laid back attempt at a fairy tale romance involving a jousting knight and the beautiful girl he falls for.  It had a few laughs and the actors were all fine.  It isn't meant to be taken too seriously, it's just a fun  movie that happens to have Heath ledger as it's main character.  He is certainly as good an actor as he is good looking.  FOR YOU DIE HARD HEATH FANS: this is a must see!!
he is perfectly charming as ""William"", who wants to be a Knight, fight the bad guy, and win the girl.

I was sure it would be a bad teen flick with a few decent action scenes, and frankly, wasn't even going to rent it...what a pleasant surprise.
I haven't smiled so much in a movie in a long time. Wonderful acting, directing, dialog...and the story moves along nicely but never bogs down or tries to be anything other than what it is...a FUN movie(with some nice emotional moments as well). Sure, you might say it has cliche's and such(the music blends in nicely btw), but the film is so entertaining and hits all the right notes that you won't care if you've 'seen it before'...and I can assure you, you have NEVER seen jousting like what's pulled off in this film.
Heath Ledger is as likable and capable an actor as your gonna find for this type of film, and he does a great job, as do the others, but Paul Bettany almost steals the film with his hilarious and shameless portrayal of Chaucer. I challenge anyone to sit through most of his scenes without a smile plastered across his/her face. I truely hope he gets nominated for an award(the deleted scene he has when he's pleading with the mob is really something to see as well).

You will meet ""Jeff Chaucer"" the best storyteller of the entire realm. His flamboyant introductions to Ulrich are priceless. The camaraderie and friendships these characters develop among themselves makes you want them to do well. You too will encourage Ulrich and his compatriots in their ""knightly"" endeavors.

2657550,4,B000IHYBT6,"The younger crowd will definitely enjoy this crowd-pleasing mediaevel comedy, but don't let that turn the adults away: this one's got something for everyone. Heath Ledger plays William, a Knight's servant who decides upon his master's death to take up the lance and take his place in a jousting tournament. The success of his first attempt gives him the confidence to keep on competing under an assumed name, exasperating his two humourous friends (Mark Addy, Alan Tudyk) who are terrified because any revelation of William's humble origins will get them all executed. Soon William finds himself a top knight, competing with the evil villain in black (Rufus Sewell) and trying to win the heart of the lovely Lady Jocelyn (Shannyn Sossamon, a club DJ making a very fine acting debut). The film's best asset is its cheeky use of anachronims: crowds that sing the music of Queen, medieaval dances that blend into David Bowie, Nike symbols on the armour, and its very lively performances give it much more life than it necessarily deserves for a story so routine. Laura Fraser is exceptional as a trailblazing blacksmith, and Paul Bettany steals the show as the very humourous Geoffrey Chaucer, upon whose stories the plot is very loosely based.",1001894400,,1241,5.0

It's not every medievil film where a knight is treated more like a jock and at parties dance to David Bowie, lol. It's pretty clever and original actually even if it may seem corny to some.  Plus Heath Ledger proves that he's more than ready to be a leading man. Rufas Sewell (Dark City) is excellent as Ledger's rival. Mark Addy (The Full Monty) is good as his loyal friend as well.

2657553,5,B000IHYBT6,"Peasants chanting Queen's ""We Will Rock You?"" A medieval royal ball gone disco? You may think it's silly, and you'd be right: it's absolutely ridiculous. But ""A Knight's Tale"" dares to walk the tightrope of placing the old with the new, incorporating modern songs and phrases into an era gone by, and it succeeds in doing so. The perfect mix of grandeur, passion, and exciting action, director Brian Helgeland tells a likeable tale that, for me, is a real triumph of a film.
From the beginning, the movie puts forth its own set of rules, as peasants sing ""We Will Rock You"" during a jousting match; at this point, you either accept the movie's machinations, or turn away in contempt. At the center of the excitement is William Thatcher (Heath Ledger), a squire whose master has just taken part in his last match. Desperately in need of money for food, he and his partners Roland and Wat (Mark Addy and Alan Tudyk) decide to finish the match themselves, and William dons the armor and takes the arena by storm, giving new meaning to the phrase ""natural born.""
But that isn't enough for the ambitious lad, whose life-long dream of becoming a knight stems from his father's instillation of hope in him. After encountering Geoffrey Chaucer (Paul Bettany) and striking a deal with him to concoct a fictitious family history for William, they make their way to several jousting matches, where William takes a new identity, a new love interest in Lady Jocelyn (Shannyn Sossamon), and a new rival in Count Adhemar (Rufus Sewell), whose jealousy over William's fame and popularity stir his devious mind.
A somewhat formulaic plot, you might say, but when you're having so much fun in a film such as this, does it really matter? There is such a high spirit to the movie, an energy so exciting and full of joy that any inhibitions you originally had will be swept aside once the movie invites you on its trek.
Much of this enjoyment is due to the cast, which is stellar in all fields. Ledger is the ideal embodiment of a hero, and his character's mission becomes one of hope and strength through his forthright acting. He and newcomer Sossamon share a warm chemistry, one that is as vibrant as a medieval tapestry. Addy, Tudyk, and Bettany are riotous as William's cohorts, each of them possessing a warm spirit that makes this supporting cast one of the year's best. The rival Adhemar is played exquisitely by Sewell, who even has that cunning look and characteristic about him.
Director Helgeland, who also wrote the film, brings an upbeat feel to the movie, even in its more emotional scenes. His portrayal of a medieval setting is less articulate than something along the lines of, say, ""Excalibur,"" but it's nonetheless breathtaking, if not exquisite. Helgeland also instills a high energy into the jousting matches, giving us many different points of view, and charging each scene with fast-paced editing and the roar of cheering audiences in the arena.
The movie's true high point is the comic relief, stemming from the mix of 14th century settings with post-modern culture. The ""We Will Rock You"" sequence is bursting with laughs and upbeat charisma, a successful opener to the film. A medieval ball that begins with harmonic melodies resonates into David Bowie's ""Golden Years,"" and the scene practically takes flight. Some may sneer at the mixture, but it is purely nothing more than good-natured fun, and I fully recommend it.
While scenarios such as this are nothing new, they are rarely done so well, and that's what makes ""A Knight's Tale"" such a special movie. It's got everything you could ask for in a movie: genuine comedy, a believable love story, likeable characters, and a plot that never stops moving. It's brilliant combination of eras and culture is nonetheless upbeat and inspired, and I enjoyed every minute of it. One of the best films of the year.",1001548800,,3864,4.820783132530121

The sets and period costumes are wonderful, and they let you imagine what it would have been like to actually be there. Heath Ledger gives a strong performance, equally adept at comedy as he is at drama. Some of the best performances in the movie are from the actors who play his friends. Mark Addy is absolutely perfect as Geoffrey Chaucer, and his character is especially fun if you know his history before you see the movie. There's great chemistry between Ledger and his friends, but one of the film's problems is a bit of an occasional lack of chemistry between Ledger and Shannyn Sossamon, who gives an otherwise good, funny performance as Jocelyn.

Where this DVD shines is the production featurettes and the inclusion of deleted scenes. Instead of one long making-of feature (which is also included!) this disk has many short and very watchable featurettes, each one on a different aspect of the film's production.
The deleted scenes are a terrific addition. Included are several more of Paul Bettany's marvelous speeches that had to be cut to tighten up the film. There is also an option to see intros to each deleted scene where the director and editor explain why the scene had to be cut.

The movie is modern in every sense of the word and that is it's greatest failing. As much as I like the music on it's own it fails to inspire in a story about jousting. There is an MTV mentality that prevails throughout the film. It is a big disappointment. It's strongest element is the characters as most are likeable and interesting.

2657558,3,B000IHYBT6,"I'm a big Heath Ledger fan, and his performance in this movie is above reproach. Also good are Edward and the Kate, the blacksmith. But even from the outset, the movie struck me as needing just one more rewrite.
  I won't complain about the music or the anachronisms, and the role of Chaucer was clever and fun, if somewhat unusual in a teen-directed movie. I was actually quite impressed by the authentic way in which the movie resolved the difficulty for a peasant trying to compete on a level playing field, so to speak, with nobles. William's father is excellent and Edward an excellently played complex character that makes Adhemar even more one-dimensional by comparison. But honestly, how many ways are there to do a villain?
 The problem lies entirely in the relationship between Ledger's William Thatcher and Shannyn Sossamon's Jocelyn. In her opening scene, Jocelyn shows potential to be an actual character, but even at her best, she is not as much fun as Kate. WARNING-STOP HERE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW HOW THIS ENDS.
  Every single teen I've spoken to who saw the movie expected William to realize that Jocelyn was a spoiled rich girl and go to Kate, with whom he had actual chemistry. Unfortunately, the movie took a Bond spin and stuck with the babe in the transparent shirt. This was not only unsatisfying for the audience (let's face it, one thing we've come to expect from movies is that the beautiful, shallow, nasty girl should lose the boy to the less glamorous but feistier, smarter girl), but it left Kate's character dangling. Some might say it's progress to have a strong female character who doesn't have to be a romantic interest. Probably so. But it is definitely not progress to have the guy go for the glamour and ignore the girl with personality.
  Ordinarily, a movie like this would be great for an evening with your girlfriends, but the ending kept this from being the feel-good fun movie it almost was. I wouldn't see it again.",1001289600,,1964,4.7251461988304095

Heath Ledger (after the great  movie, The Patriot), holds his own, as a ""wanna-be"" knight. Since he has no royal blood, only the passion and determination to be a great knight, he creates a fake persona in order to enter the local knight's games. Needless to say, after several convincing wins, his popularity in the kingdom soars, and he quickly becomes a favorite, until...you'll just have to watch the movie.
I did not care for Romeo + Juliet, Great Expectations, or the other ""modernized"" rewrites of classic literature, but as A Knight's Tale does not take itself so seriously, it was quite enjoyable. There is a lot of humor, without the crude junk that's so overused in movies today.

2657573,4,B000IHYBT6,"A Knight's Tale is far more entertaining than most of this summer's bloated blockbusters. Being a medieval history buff, I made myself close eyes on numerous colossal absurdities (costumes with sewed in sleeves, cowboy-style breeches, a woman-armorer and dozens, dozens of more) and enjoyed this witty, well-directed, well-acted spectacle. What more do you need in a movies where courage, generosity and friendship win over wickedness and intrigues, bringing knightly virtues ""to the masses""?
Although as if set in France and England of the 14th century, it's a fairytale world that merely looks a bit like medieval Europe. A world where clear-skinned babes in fantastically un-medieval costumes can be sarcastic to clergymen, where a lance striking in the chest squarely for countless times merely chafes inconsequently, where a young ruffian (H. Ledger) can train himself to be a knight over two weeks, enter the world of beautiful maidens (who are being tanned and hazel-eyed deviate far from the beauty standards of those times), contests with a ruthless count (R. Sewell) raised on combat, wins tournament after tournament, finds glory, riches and receives his knighthood from the tip of the sword of the Crown Prince.
The cast owes to 2/3 of the flick's success: HL, young, burly, righteous and purposeful, infects the viewer with his ardent zeal ""to change his own stars""; RS is perfect in his brooding dark looks as a stunning arrogant villain (whose role is dramatically underwritten, unfortunately); P. Bettany as J. Chaucer is dissolute and roguish, the supporting cast of W Thatcher's best buddies - one silent and reserved, the other - cock-sure and quick-tempered - give you many funny moments. Add up great decorations (although wattle and daub), indeed transferring you to the grandeur of festivities, pure enjoyment of the physicality and force of knights' jousts, some soft rock accompanying the chain of events, and pack away a very good entertaining movie.
Although the pathetic blind father of the main character brought in in the end, as well as pampered Jocelyn, the love interest, ready to elope with HL and ""live together with the pigs"" undermined my impression and made me take one star down, I'll buy it when it's out, nonetheless.

Additionally, the intergration of modern music is superb, helping to create what is an extremely funny, interesting and lovely piece, which innovatively captures an old story in a 14th century setting with humour, wit and Queen.",999907200,,735,4.935483870967742

2657590,4,B000IHYBT6,"While it's certainly not going to reach the standards of last year's brilliant Gladiator, A Knight's Tale remains an action-packed adventure with plenty of drama and romance mixed into an easy to understand script with some corny lines. There are a couple of flaws in this medieval tale including the start, which was a bit of a bore. It's also a bit hard to take 14th-15th Century men and women chanting Queen's ""We Will Rock You"" in a stadium before a swordfight or something seriously; but, when it comes down to the action, the suspense, the adventure, the lances and the sword-fights, can you really resist this cool flick? It's bound to be a hit with the boys and the romance will break the girl's hearts. Plus Heath Ledger, ladies, he's one to look out for. His acting is talented and I loved his character determination. The script surprised me too. Although some corny lines kinda take over in some scenes, I thought - and don't kick me for this - that A Knight's Tale was refreshingly clever and had some fantastic ideas which it uses with imagination and detail. A Knight's Tale is a groovy, crowdpleasing and fun movie that kicks off easily and proceeds to be one of the neatest medieval adventures of the year 2001.

When was the last time the royals danced to David Bowie?  When was the last time you saw a movie so fun, refreshing, meaningful, and funny as the movie 'A Knight's Tale'?
During 'A Knight's Tale' you will laugh, cry, and cheer (for the knights!).  The acting is great, I was very impressed with Heath Ledger and newcomer Shannyn Sossamon.  The battles manage to be extremely exciting and fun to watch without all the blood and gore you usually see.  The costumes and music are great!  Most people think that a movie set in medieval times with modern music will be stupid or cheesy. I thought this myself when I first saw it, but the music works itself into the movie surprisingly well!
I liked how the main character (Heath Ledger) was a really honest and kind man who had good morals.  You really don't see that too much in heros nowadays.  This movie also has a great message.  I've seen 'A Knight's Tale' twice already in theaters and I can't wait until it comes out on DVD!",998438400,,1153,4.421800947867299

It just really grew on me...I wasn't entirely sure that I would like it and I really had no idea what to expect, however I was glad for the nice little surprise. I have purchased the dvd and was also happy to see all the ""extras"" added to it. I went to see it primarily because of Heath Ledger (of course), but was equally delighted with the glorious scene-stealing Paul Bettany (Chaucer). I ended up having as much fun (or more) watching Bettany than my original focus intended. Also, it took me a while to get to accustomed to it, but I did like the tongue-in-cheek quality of the rock-anthem music.

The story was solid, the acting great.  What a wonderful supporting cast, and as usual, Heath Ledger keeps up his run of great performances in this movie.  The only thing I did not like was the love interest -- although certainly through no fault of the actress who played her, who did the best she could with what she was given, the character annoyed me tremendously and I did not find her to be a very likeable in the slightest.  I actually was hoping Heath's character would end up with the other featured female character in the movie, who was far more spunky and interesting.  The way the story between Heath's character the the love interest progressed, it seemed as if the writers were also heading in that direction and it was a bit disappointing to me when he ended up with the less-likeable female character.
Like I said, a minor quibble.  A fun movie, great costumes, and the music is not all that intrusive.",992736000,,981,4.519774011299435

It had all of the components one needs for an enjoyable film:  action, romance, drama(and not to mention extremely good looking guys)  I loved the seventies music mixed with a medievel setting(some people say that that's what ruined the movie for them, but I though it worked)  Basically the movie is about a young man(Heath Ledger, gorgeous!) who is a peasant, but dreams about changin his stars.  His opportunity comes about when his master dies at a jousting tournament and he has to fill in for him.  He meets a writer along the way, none other than Geoffrey Chaucer(played by a hilarious Paul Bettany) who agrees to forge his...papers(I can't remember what they're called), anyway, he enters in a jousting tournament, and what do you know, turns out to be a natural.  However, he must compete with Count Adhemar(Rufus Sewell, who is just as gorgeous as Heath and boy, can he play a spectacular villain) for the title and for the princess(played by a stiff as a board Shannon Sossomon)  Yeah, yeah, good guy defeats bad guy and gets girl.  So it's a little cliche, but it's pure fun.  I though the suporrting cast was excellent also.  I was rather hoping that Heath would fall for the female blacksmith rather than the haughty princess, but I suppose the masses wouldn't like that as much.  Also, James Purefoy who plays the Black Prince is extremely good looking also.  There's pleny of eye candy for the girls, and plenty of action for the guys.",992304000,,1491,4.732558139534884

Geoffrey Chaucer must be spinning in his fancy, Westminster Abbey sarcophagus - or maybe not, his Canterbury tales aren't exactly noted for historical accuracy or logical consistancy either. This movie is eye candy for the ladies: the hero is blond and gorgeous; the villain dark, sinister and gorgeous; the humorous sidekicks are cute and cuddly and the gallant Black Prince noble and beautiful. 'Lady Jocelyn' isn't bad either, and her costumes get progressively more outrageous as the movie goes on.

The acting of these people is fantastic, particularly Heath Ledger. It has both action, comedy, and some very emotional scenes. (The gambler loses all his clothes twice, the character reunites with his father, the peasant is knighted.) True it is a long one but the time flies by. Plus it is a fun movie for the family.

It loses a star because the plot is a little tired. Peasant falls in love with rich girl, must fight rich brat for her, girl loves the peasant, peasant becomes the hero, wins the respect of all his peers, rich guy loses everything, everyone lives happily ever after.

I really thought I was in a copy of ""Robin Hood - Men In Tights"", but that changed. Anyways, I simply loved ""A Knight's Tale"".

I must say that it was excellent, for what it was. If you take it with the same departure from reality that you would for a musical, then First Knight becomes a refreshing new approach. The application of modern music and language is reserved, well applied and applicable to bringing out the characters and the story-line. Otherwise, the world they create is quite good. My teenagers were on the edge of their seats; they loved it. On another good note, no sexual based nudity (only a males rear end walking on the road), sexual situations were at a minimum and the offensive language was also kept to a minimum.

There should surely be a rule about using 70s rock anthems in movies about jousting that are set before 1970, or for any movies about jousting.  I now understand why there have been so few jousting movies out, because it's boring.  Once you see one person get knocked off their horse, you've seen it all.

It's a pity, because it could have been a really good movie. I don't buy the idea that a basically untutored peasant could consistently defeat knights with years of training. And I don't buy the idea that a couple of other peasants could train him to fight effectively - especially not after a single month of training. Sure, maybe he might win one or two bouts, but to be basically undefeated? Puh-leeeze!
The worst flaw, though, was the ending. Consider. This dude has just taken a lance point in the shoulder. His arm is so weak that he has to have his lance strapped to his hand for the final pass. Then, after he unhorses his opponent (predictably), he lightly vaults over a fence and hugs his lady - I guess defeating his arch-rival healed his shoulder?
Save your money! Heath Ledger may be a hunk - I'm no judge of male pulchritude - but he showed no talent for acting in this piece of dross.",990144000,,1141,4.516908212560386
2657679,3,B000IHYBT6,"This movie had an interesting flip to it that took me by surprise.  I was expecting a more authentic medieval time period movie, and found it to be more of a comedy.  So, I am not sure if I was disappointed at first or not.  Perhaps, if I had read beforehand what to expect, I may have liked it better than I did.  I found myself groaning about the 70's pop and rock music used throughout the soundtrack.  Were they trying to save money by not formulating fresh and new music? (which could have been awesome), or were they trying to be funny and different??  I am not sure.  The costumes were not time period authentic either, but did that matter?  I suppose not.  HOWEVER, The storyline was fun and had the things I like in a movie...some romance, some action, a good looking main man (and woman...for the guys)...and to my surprise alot of unexpected humor.  I enjoyed the characters, and thought they worked well together.  I liked the action scenes, they were not ""bloody"" graphic, but they still packed a punch.  I liked the cleanliness of the language, (a welcome change to some of today's movies, which can go overboard with vulgar language).  Just so you know what to expect for your kidsake, there was a few ""bare butt"" scenes, by one of the men (not Heath's).  OKAY, So I groaned in disbelief a few times as to the direction they went on some things, I did get a few good laughs and of course some fun entertainment for my money.  I just wouldn't say it was the best film I have ever seen, just a fun movie.

2657684,4,B000IHYBT6,"So I had the chance to see two movies last Friday--the Mummy Returns and A Knight's Tale.  I chose the latter because I love watching movies set in that time period along with those set in the Renaissance and Regency periods, too, and lemme tell ya', i did not leave the theater disappointed.  It started out a little slow with the scene where William and his two friends are poking at a dead knight, but soon the audience was humorously greeted by the idle and stark naked wanderings of Geoffery Chaucer (suitably portrayed by Paul Bettany), who claims to be a writer.  And a few scenes later in the movie, his claims were rightly justified as he spurted out an invigorating,  impassioned, and slightly exaggerated speech (exaggerated in content, not quality) when announcing William (Heath Ledger) or rather Sir Orich von Liechenstein to the segregated crowd of aristocrats and paupers.  They could not have picked a better person to play the part of poet/orator Geoffery Chaucer.  He was entertaining and captivating to watch in a way that only the British accent could make possible.
 Coming into the theater, i had the expectation that the movie would start out with a young Heath Ledger, as one would automatically assume from previews.  But as the first scene opened, i saw Heath Ledger with a scraggly beard and long dirty blond hair, immediately reminding me of the image Mel Gibson had presented in the phenomenal film ""Braveheart"", and i thought perhaps that they were showing an older, aged Heath, who, after years and years of distinguished fighting, was now a noble legend.  Of course my assumption was wrong, for Ledger was only a twenty-something young man with an overgrown bread.  And then i thought to myself, well if he's already a grown man at the beginning of the film (not the 8-yr old boy i expected him to be) and if he's already doing a fight scene in the first fifteen minutes of it, then wat kind of intensified episodes will they be able to pull off when building up to the climax of the film (and with 2 more hours to go)?  the answer to that question was: as many as they pleased.  And they did it all in with action-packed, fun-filled, falling-out-of-ur-seats-with-laughter class.
The movie was great.  The cast was great.  The romance was sweet and comical (tho, i was kinda rooting for Heath to fall in love with the spunky female blacksmith--whose beauty was hidden under black and brown ashes).  And the touch of adding dynamic 20th century music to the orthodox 14th century medieval period may at first seem way out of place and tacky, but once u see the peasants and the nobles alike grooving to the Queens' tunes u may begin to wonder if the director was trying to make a statement by bringing some subtle hints of class integration into the film,  or if he just brought in ""We Will Rock You"" to attract youthful audiences.  But either way, he appealed to audiences of all genders and of all generations.  And while A Knight's Tale may not be the greatest medieval movie ever made,  it's definitely one worth watching (and i wouldn't mind a sequel--hint, hint) hehe =P.",989971200,,3109,4.702952029520295
2657685,5,B000IHYBT6,"The movie was spectacular. It was romantic, dramatic, poignant, and absolutely hillarious at the same time.

Heath Ledger brings an ambience to the movie that makes it perfect.  I havn't yet encountered a movie that kept me so happy while viewing it, and so satisfied after I left.

2657697,2,B000IHYBT6,"Some folks will try just about anything to get people to come to the movies.  ""A Knight's Tale"" is a case in point.  In this latest attempt to fill seats and make money, a Medieval setting featuring several jousting tournaments (including the world championship) is accented by a soundtrack that mixes an original Medieval-type score with, of all things, classic rock.  To some, that may seem like a fresh and exciting twist, but to me at least, it only serves to bury this already-laughable flick even deeper.  In my opinion, the movie itself wasn't even all that great; the plot is pretty much as simple as it gets (the whole story's in the trailers!), the dialogue was pretty much ripped from an episode of ""Xena"", the action was bordering on just plain goofy (although I did actually flinch at several of the lance shots these guys were taking), and, of course, the soundtrack (don't even get me started).  Strangely, though, it seemed that every time this flick fell on its face, something would happen that almost redeemed it.  It was pretty much a rollercoaster for the emotions, actually; I groaned, I laughed, I flinched...all told, though, the groans were more frequent than anything else, and between that and looking at my watch at least twice during the movie, it makes a good summary for how it turned out.  Medieval ""purists"" will probably be insulted by this flick, but a few action fans might get a kick out of it.  Far as me, it was definitely not the best eight bucks I ever spent.  I might as well have stopped at the trailer.",989625600,,1546,4.654411764705882
2657698,4,B000IHYBT6,"A suprisingly entertaining spectacle. 'A Knight's Tale' marks Heath Ledger's coming out party. The young Aussie star is in fine form as a poor boy seeking to become a knight. The lancing tournaments are dazzling, and the comic relief is frequent. In addition, call this movie the 'un-period piece.' While the film is set in medieval times, several scenes blatantly and intentionally fuse history with present popular culture. For instance, Ledger and another knight meet in the arena as the crowd claps to Queen's 'We Will Rock You.' Later, Ledger and a young maiden dance disco-style in a medieval hall. It's a bizarre mixture that gives the movie a hip, refreshing edge. I was dragged kicking-and-screaming to this one. But I came out a fan.",989625600,,743,4.952
2657699,5,B000IHYBT6,"I absolutely loved this movie.  Heath Ledger is such a great actor, and he is soooo handsome.  He plays a peasant who masquerades as a knight, so that he can joust, after his master, who also jousts, dies.  The cast of characters that surround Ledger are absolutely fabulous.  I love it that they have Geoffrey Chaucer in his group of friends.  The actor who plays him is very handsome and the character is hilarious.  Chaucer has a gambling problem, and that causes some problems, but he also plays Ledger's announcer--he is the one who introduces Ledger at the beginning of the jousting matches--and he really hams it up, which is very funny.  I like the female blacksmith who makes Ledger's armor, she puts Nike logos on it as her trademark, and joins Ledger's entourage.
Of course, Ledger takes the jousting tournament season by storm, and he becomes extremely popular.  He and the villain (whose name I cannot remember), the only knight that he cannot defeat at jousting, are both vying for the hand of the same woman, of course Ledger wins her heart, but the villain causes problems for their relationship towards the end of the movie.  The romantic aspect of this movie is the only one that I did not thoroughly love.
Everything comes to a head at the Jousting World Championships in London.  At this point I want to mention the character of Prince Edward of England, he and Ledger meet in a jousting match during the season.  Ledger makes quite an impression on the prince when he is the only knight who has the guts to actually compete against him. (The villain has a chance to joust against the Prince, but he withdraws from the match to avoid having to joust against his Prince.)  Anyway, the Prince plays an essential role in the way the movie ends, and I really liked the way he was portrayed.
This was just a wonderfully funny and good movie and I would recommend it to anyone.",989625600,,1891,4.611940298507463

Yes, the plot is thin, the costumes are non historical, the music unconventional to the era, and I am sure the ""Modern Knights"" who reenact jousts are moaning loudly (especially during the London tournament scene). However, the casting was a stroke of genius. Every character plays beautifully off the other. The dialog a symphony of words with no sour notes!
Although smattered with unrealistic scenarios the storylines' saving grace is its refreshing morality. A Knight's Tale replaces gratuitous sex with romantic love, gruesome violence with glory and honor, obscenities with wit and humor. It's a tale of good over evil, of knightly comradery, of believing in yourself against all odds; knowing you can ""change your stars.""",989625600,,821,5.044117647058823

2657703,5,B000IHYBT6,"Let me begin by saying that this film is not what most people expect it to be.  Rather than being a typical medieval hack and slash movie, A Knight's Tale is actually a sports movie with a lot of comedy, action, and a bit of romance.
Confused?  Well, considering that jousting was probably the sport of choice in the movie's time setting, this makes perfect sense.  Still confused?  You'll understand when you watch the opening scene with the spectators at a joust singing ""We Will Rock You"" by Queen.  Sound bizarre?  I thought so, too, but then it all made perfect sense as I sat and watched.
Basically a tale of a rookie new to the sport and his struggle to the top, this film is now one of my favorites up there with Gladiator and Braveheart.  Just like those two movies, Knight's Tale is one of those films that sucks you right in with gorgeous sets, detailed costumes, and great characterization.  However, the main difference is that the tone of this movie is rather comical.  Actually, I laughed more during A Knight's Tale than I remember laughing during most comedies.  This isn't to say that the movie lacks any seriousness.  Competition is what jousting is all about, and this film gets you pretty pumped up even without having any battle scenes.
I highly recommend this movie to everyone, and I can't wait for it to come out on DVD.  Make sure you don't get to the theater late so you don't miss the ""We Will Rock You"" opening sequence, and check out Geoffrey Chaucer, one of the major characters.
