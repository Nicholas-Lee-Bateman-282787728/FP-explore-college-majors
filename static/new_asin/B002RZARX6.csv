3977753,5,B002RZARX6,"I don't really like movies and I don't watch them a lot. And after seeing Troubled Water I know why. The simple reason is that very few movies are as good as this one. This is definitely not one of those sad Hollywood monstrosities that aim to prevent you from having a single thought by any means possible. This film does not attempt to benumb the spectators by an endless assault of noises, colors, flashes, explosions, colorful images, etc. It actually leaves the viewers some space to think, analyze, and simply to exist. Troubled Water does not attempt to rob me of my humanity and my human agency, unlike the stupid Hollywood productions.

This is the kind of film that works through powerful acting and great directing. There are no cheap thrills in Troubled Water. No special effects, no monsters or vampires, no explosions, 3D effects, unrealistic car chases, etc. There is just life, human existence, normal people trying to figure out important stuff.

Instead of silicone-inflated cyborg-like individuals who pass for actors in Hollywood, this film has actors who actually look like real, normal people. We are so used to the assembly-line faces and bodies of Hollywood characters, that the actors in Troubled Water look refreshingly attractive. As attractive as only real human beings can be. And these actors even know how to act.

I'm not going to retell the plot of the movie here. Because great art is not about the plot. The story is never as important as the artistic means employed to transmit it. I will only say that Troubled Water is a film that makes you want to come back to it over and over.",1275696000,42,1617,4.767857142857143

3977756,5,B002RZARX6,"(special thanks to Film Movement for providing me a screener!)

Troubled Water is a masterpiece of sad, vaguely depressing, film making where in the end there's no real uplifting message and not a lot of resolution and very few answers. Will it surprise you if I tell you it's a Scandinavian movie?

The movie tells the tale of Jan Thomas Hansen, recently released from prison after being convicted of the murder of a young boy. He's always maintained his innocence and blamed a cohort, of whom we see basically nothing.

Out of prison he gets a job working as an organist at a church. He's quite good and starts a shy, tentative relationship with Anna, the church priest. He also becomes quite fond of her young son, Jens and starts spending time around him...

Meanwhile, Agnes, the mother of the murdered boy, has a parallel story where we see her and her husband and two adopted daughters getting ready to move to Denmark. She's on what appears to be a school field trip to a church and while there notices a suspiciously familiar organist.

Soon all her memories of the events surrounding the death of her child come up to the front of her mind (""I can't drink hot chocolate anymore,"" she confesses at one point, remembering that she'd been buying hot chocolate for her son when the boy was taken). Initially she just notices the man, makes some vague platitudes about him and wants to move on, but quickly becomes obsessed, especially once she seems him hanging around a young boy...

The movie is about several things. It's about crime and punishment. It's about guilt and how it can consume you from within. It's about a lonely woman and a shy man finding each other. It's about shattered parents trying to move on.

It's also about forgiveness, and how you should forgive people who have wronged you not for their sake, but for your own, so that you can move on with your life.

It's also a movie that is, at times, quite literally soaked in symbolism. Baptism, rivers, swimming pools and all things wet play a huge role in the film (ironically as I type that, I'm being spattered with water from a leak in the roof).

Certain plot elements of the movie were predictable, but the events that followed after took some directions I didn't expect, and at no point did the film feel forced or unreal. It pulls at the heartstrings, true, but it earns those pulls and does not get them through cheap manipulation, and that's a mark of a good film.

== SHORT SUBJECT ==

This month's short subject is The Kolaborator, a jolly romp through recent Serbian/Bosnian history. It centers around Goran, a soccer player who winds up being on a Serbian death squad, traveling the countryside, helping to murder innocent civilians, including children. As he goes about his missions he eventually runs into the soccer coach and things get a little tense.

The movie is nicely filmed, though the washed out colors in the murder scenes are a bit schmaltzy. Also, there doesn't seem to be much the movie is saying other than, ""Genocide! Boy, that sucks, eh?"" Still, it was interesting and worth seeing.",1265500800,31,3090,4.670349907918968

I'd say the say thing to the filmmaker.  He's told a story in a most powerful way, drawing upon his unique skills as a filmmaker to convey age old themes in a highly original manner.  The structure alone hammers home how two people in particular, Thomas and the mother of the boy he killed, cannot move on from their trauma and demonstrate how that inability to confess and forgive can damage those around them. For the writer to make Thomas a heavenly organist whose playing sends people into rapture is just the most magnificent irony, with the centerpiece being the mother realizing who this amazing organist is.  That scene alone deserved every award.  This is no film crafted from a template.

The film chronicles Jan/Tomas's continuing journey to shed the chains of his past and make a better future.

If you need a tight plot that doesn't challenge you, or a story that ends tidily so that you don't have to think about it afterwards, you should obviously watch a different film.

This is spiritual film without sentimentality or easy answers, disguised as a crime film, that investigates the nature of evil, of grace and forgiveness.

3977783,5,B002RZARX6,"There have been many reviews written about this movie, some of which have described the storyline very well, to which I will only add that the movie is broken down into two distinct parts:  the sequence of events from the viewpoint of Tomas, who committed the crime, the other from the viewpoint of Agnes, the mother of the kidnapped, missing dead child.  The philosophical question asked by this film is:  in the case of Tomas, how does one take responsibility for and, more importantly, atone for an unspeakable crime.  In the case of Agnes, how does one arrive at acceptance of such a terrible loss, and forgiveness for this man who killed her son.  Watching each of them struggle toward redemption is agonizing, especially for viewers like me who have lost a child ourselves.

There are so many fascinating things about this movie, I have watched it at least 4 times and see something new with each viewing.

3977788,2,B002RZARX6,"DeUsynlige (Troubled Water) (Erik Poppe, 2008)

Troubled Water is a very pretty, very well-acted, quite compelling movie that has just one flaw. Unfortunately, that flaw is a fatal one indeed, and if you notice it, it is liable to poison the entire movie for you. It's not a spoilerthe movie goes into this territory pretty early onbut since it is the kind of thing that is likely to poison the entire film, I will mark it as a spoiler when we get there (the third paragraph of this review), and if you are so inclined and have not seen the movie, you should probably stop reading there. I'll tell you right now it's not a recommend, thougheven given this fatal flawonly by the barest of margins; the movie's strong points are almost enough to overcome this. Given how well the movie has been received, either they do overcome it for many people, or that same many people just don't recognize that the flaw exists; to be fair, you have to be in a certain position in your life to recognize it. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

Jan Thomas (Max Manus: Man of War's Pal Sverre Valhein Hagen) has recently been paroled from prison. He was sent there for killing a child, and since his arrest he has maintained that the child's death was an accident. He finds himself a job as the organist at a church headed by Anna (King of Devil's Island's Ellen Dorrit Peterson), who has a son, Jens (Into the Dark's Fredrik Grondahl in his screen debut) about the same age as Isak (Jon Vagenes Erikson), the boy who died all those years (ten? fifteen?) ago. Jan Thomas is initially reluctant to interact with Jens, but eventually he and Anna's attraction for one another wins out, and Jan Thomas and Jens start bonding. All goes smoothly until Agnes (Festen's Trine Dyrholm), Isak's mother, discovers Jan Thomas is out of prison and begins stalking him, trying to make him admit to a murder he continues to assert never occurred.

As promised, here's the big SPOILER ALERT warning. Here's the main thing that blew the movie for me: if a child dies on your watch, and it doesn't matter one bit if that death was intentional or not, there is no way in ever-living hell that you are going to treat another child on your watch with the casual air with which Jan Thomas treats Jens once the two of them start becoming friends. Which would normally be a minor annoyance, but that casuality is the mechanism upon which the entire second half of the movie turns; Harald Rosenlow-Eeg (Hawaii, Oslo)'s script turns on this device, pushing it into a far more important place than it should have. Thus, without this particularly choice piece of stupidity... we wouldn't have a movie. There are other, far more minor, pieces of silliness that do rate as minor annoyances in comparison (why the hell, in the flashback scenes, is Agnes pushing Isak, who's supposedly four and definitely very large for his age, around in a stroller? And even if you can justify that, why a stroller that's at least two sizes too small for him? It becomes obvious in the flashbacks pertaining to his death that the boy is perfectly capable of walking on his own), but none of them achieve the magnitude, or the ineptitude, of this one. If you can get past that, it's quite a nice little film, perhaps a little Lifetine Original Movie-esque in the romance angles (both the germination of the relationship between Jan Thomas and Anna and the strained relationship between Agnes and her husband, whose marriage is on the verge of disintegration throughout the film), but compelling enough for all that. If Rosenlow-Eeg had treated the relationship between Jan Thomas and Jens with the intelligence it deserved, and then by default not attempted to make this into the thriller it never becomes, it would have been a very different and, I think, much more compelling film. **",1361059200,,3821,4.674591381872214

3977791,5,B002RZARX6,"I stumbled onto `Troubled Water' quite by accident.  I had never heard of the film or the actors or the director before and so it was a film that was not on my radar whatsoever.  But, I happened to come across it while channel surfing and finding one of those amazing `foreign language film stations' (Link) and I had to give it a try.

This film is perfection.

`Troubled Water' will crush you emotionally, so be prepared for that.  The story here is one that is built to give the audience an influx of emotions.  It will make you angry, it will make you sad, it will make you frustrated, it will make you smile.  The smiling is a mere reflection of the film's central embodiment of hope in redemption, but for the most part you'll have chills as you watch this tale unfold.  Without giving too much away, the film centers on a young man named Jan Thomas who has just been released from prison after killing a young boy in a garish theft gone very wrong.  He gets a job playing the organ at a local church, a skill he developed while behind bars.  He strikes up an unlikely relationship with the churches female pastor, Anna, who has a young son herself.  Jan seems to be working towards normalcy and obvious redemption until Agnes, the mother of the young boy he murdered, notices him at the church.  Agnes is still convinced that Jan is a danger and so she begins fraying at the edges, seeking for a way to destroy what he has started to create.

Told in two parts, each part focusing on different aspects of the unfolding tragedy, `Troubled Water' is a stunning character study that fleshes out the purest feelings of guilt, remorse, anger and grief.  The way that Harold Rosenlow-Eeg fleshes out this story and the way that Erik Poppe directed each moment is flawless.  I can't think of another film that really embellishes those feelings of grief quite as effectively as this one, outside of `In the Bedroom'.  Some have complained that it doesn't give us many `answers' but that isn't the point of the story.  This isn't a story about `what happened' or `what will happen' as much as it's a story about the purgatory state of `what happens when we try to move on'.

The entire cast is stunning here, but Pal Sverre Valheim Hagen, Trine Dyrholm and Ellen Dorrit Petersen are all exceptionally effective in this film.  Dyrholm has a difficult task of unearthing her character's pain and fury without going overboard and feeling like a caricature.  She manages marvelously, and her final confrontation with her oppressor of sorts is a stunning splice of film acting.

3977793,5,B002RZARX6,"On a flight from New York to Helsinki, Finland, the people sitting close enough to see, and even possibly the staff, might have thought I was having a personal ""episode"" of some kind, because while watching this film, I not only teared up but I actually cried some minutes during one of the crucial scenes.

I've had dreams about my son being kidnapped before, scarily vivid and heart pounding, as I knew I couldn't reach and rescue him in time before he was whisked away in a dark car by the perpetrators. The helpless, the scream of loss, the terrible realization someone else has your child for whatever reason, at their total control. Rather than deal with the crime itself, DeUsynlige expounds upon the emotions and long-reaching effects the event has not only on the relatives of the victim, but on the murderer as well.

As you can read in the description, its a fairly straightforward premise, and from the details anyone might imagine some of the emotions that might be presented: guilt, rage, grief and love, but the acting is so superb, the direction so subtle yet powerful, the score brilliant, that the sum total makes for an unforgettable, moving film.

Some have complained of it being disjointed, as it is not necessarily presented in sequential order, yet I found the style to be particularly effective for the storyline as any event, especially a crime, can be remembered in different ways depending on your perspective. Certainly the recently released and willing to talk parolee had more knowledge of the actual events than was ever presented in the courtroom. Having lived with the rage, grief and guilt for many years, the grieving parents have filled in pieces of the puzzle to help assuage their own agony, and to try to make some sense of a senseless crime.

We are first introduced to the young man Jan, a teen murderer now a free man in his late twenties or early thirties. After showing a brief vignette of the crime, we see that even then he was an individual too receptive to suggestion and cajoled into serious deeds. Now as a grown man he is ultimately likeable, even gentle and very much sorry for his part in the young child's death. He's given release having served his time, and obtains a position as an organ player, the instrument he's learned to play beautifully. Through his eyes we experience the simple joy of having his own apartment, riding his bicycle along the street, or the shy pleasure of the caring young minister and mother of a small boy, becoming interested in him. Then a problem presents itself, inexplicable events happen, someone gives warnings about him yet how could they know his closed past?

Tormented through the years, second guessing herself, the young mother whose child was kidnapped and killed is now middle-aged with two adopted daughters whom she loves dearly; has a protective, adoring husband, and fulfilling job, yet of course she cannot forget the loss of her son. When she sees a man she believes to be the murderer, her life and emotions are thrown into a swirl of troubled waters, just like the waters her son was drowned in, the place where the parolee's mind also frequently drifts.

The mysterious events are eventually explained as the two have crossed paths a number of times, all unknown to Jan, for the mother seeks to protect the minister's son from the fate she's convinced Jan intends for him. The climax is breathtaking and it's made known that these two are forever linked to each other by the former crime, and they cannot in any way be made whole until they face the memories together.

In Norwegian with English subtitles, don't let the need to read them put you off this film. It will flow, for the actors abilities transcend the language differences. You'll see what I mean. Trine Dyrholm, who played the grieving mother was magnificent. Winner of four awards, with five other nominations, and well deserved.",1310601600,7,3902,4.7804154302670625

I could ramble quite a lot over how impressed I was with this film's story and acting ... and its wondrous music, which is such an important part of the story and the emotions. But instead I'd just like to recommend it strongly to those unfamiliar with it. So many movies come and go, and seem disposable, but once in a while a rich and powerful one stands out; this was moving, poignant, deep, and engaging. Anyone who enjoys a strong drama would benefit from experiencing this movie. It's totally worth one's time and attention. (Note: people who don't care for quiet and thought-provoking movies, and for subtitles, should avoid this gem at all costs.)",1304467200,,666,4.6923076923076925
3977795,2,B002RZARX6,"This film reminded me of another Norwegian film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hawaii-Oslo/dp/B000EGZ7WG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hawaii, Oslo</a>, and I discovered the director, Eric Poppe, is the same.  Although I did not care for Hawaii Oslo, my feelings lightened up for Troubled Water.  But both films were too long, too bizarre, and structured in a confusing manner.

The film is structured in two parts, rather two voices; and if you don't pay strict attention, you may get confused.  A young man, Jan, spent time in prison for the alleged murder of a young boy.  The story begins after the prison release, where Jan, gets a job as a church organist.  Then, we learn what happened to this young boy in a stroller, taken from where a woman left him outside while she cleaned up inside a restroom.

First of all, why is this kid, about 5 years old in a baby stroller?  Looks too big for that.  Then, this ""baby"" in a stroller jumps and runs into the river....little cheesy here!

Then, the film shifts to the view of the mother whose kid was stolen and murdered.  When she discovers Jan was at her home talking with her husband, she goes ballistic trying to prevent Jan from doing so to another child and her neurosis triggers and she attempts to confront or expose him.  In the same meantime, her view of how the murder happened is revealed.

Confused enough?  It's like a story after the story of the story.  What made this film confusing is the split structure.  First half is Jan's story, next is the mother's story.  But with the present intertwined with the past, it can get confusing.

The film is about prison reform, atonement, forgiveness, there are too many unanswered questions.  Like I said, Director's other film, Hawaii Oslo is worse.  ....Rizzo",1300838400,,1812,4.996655518394649
3977796,4,B002RZARX6,"This outstanding Norwegian film had me riveted to my seat from beginning to end.  I am hard pressed to find higher production values in any other movie I've seen.  The acting, directing, editing, & cinematography are all superlative.  And let's not forget the musical score, from delicate strains of orchestral music to an incredible duo of organ and cello.  The English title of the film seems to derive from a brief organ rendition of Simon & Garfunkle's Bridge Over Trouble Waters, about a quarter way into the move, though I'm not sure if the Norwegian title, De Usynlige, translates thus.  On top of all this, I found the characters to be so real, it's easy to feel for them all, to fall in love with them and yearn for their future.  My only constructive criticism lies with the ending of the story, slightly muddled perhaps.  Was redemption accomplished or only partially? I'm not exactly sure what the movie is telling me at the end (I welcome other reviewers' comments here).  One note of caution, the subject matter deals with the abduction and death of a child, and though handled with great skill in the filmmakers' hands, it is rather brutal nonetheless.  I'm adding this dvd to my collection of all time favorite movies.",1298592000,,1234,4.755868544600939
3977797,4,B002RZARX6,"""Troubled Water"" (116 min,; originally released in 2008) is another recent (2010) release in the excellent and on-going series of Film Movement DVDs. This movie out of Norway brings the story of a guy recently released from prison after having done time for a child kdnapping that had ended in the child's death (but did he really commit the crime?). Now going under his middle name Thomas, he finds a position as an organist in a church, and before we know it, he falls for Anna, the pastor who has a 6 yr. old boy, Jens. THings are going well for Thomas, Anna and Jens. Then one day Thomas leaves Jens alone for a few minutes to retrieve something from the class room and when Thomas returns, Jens has disappeared... This event comes about half-way in the movie and from that moment on we see most of the movie again, from another character's perspective, and it all comes together in the last 15 min. of the movie.

I thought the movie was riveting from start to finish. If there was one aspect that I didn't quite like that much, it is that quite a few scenes play out in very poorly lit settings for some reason, making it at time hard to even see what is happening. That aside, the performances in the movie, including in particular Pl Sverre Valheim Hagen as Thomas, are outstanding. Also noteworthy is the critical role that music is given in the movie. Several scenes feature extensive and massive church organ-playing, just beautiful. As an aside, I cannot emphasize enough how highly I think of the Film Movement releases. I've now seen maybe 10 or so, and haven't had a single bad experience yet. Meanwhile ""Troubled Water"" is highly recommended!",1295740800,,1658,4.620338983050847

8378958,5,B002RZARX6,"I originally watched part of this movie in 2008 when it first came out. Because the narrative is so important to this film, it is imperative to watch it from beginning to end for a better understanding of the film, especially if Norwegian is not your first language. The plot, while it may have some holes, is simple but powerful. I believe the title ""Troubled Water"" comes from the famous song ""Bridge over Troubled Water,"" which may in itself be symbolic to the entire storyline. I won't spoil you, though. It is a must see foreign language film! I would definitely buy this feature film!",1498521600,,590,4.628571428571429

8378960,5,B002RZARX6,"Although ""Trouble Water"" delves into the rage and confusion caused by a crime--the victim's mother comes unhinged--it treats the themes of condemnation and punishment as something we work through as we move toward salvation and a second chance for a young wrong-doer.  The overall message is one of our common humanity, in a society with a mature outlook.  Yes, the movie does go backward and forward in time, but it isn't difficult to follow--these are important flashbacks showing the two main characters' memories of the unfortunate day--no artsy mind-games here.

Is there anyone out there who doesn't need a second chance in life, and a third, and a fourth...?  Interestingly, however, there is an ""evil"" character in the movie (an incidental figure) whom the director seems to treat as being beyond redemption.  See what you think!",1492905600,2,837,5.125

8378965,4,B002RZARX6,"Few movies are as gripping as Troubled Water. And few are as well acted. The organ music alone is worth seeing this film for. The plot is extraordinary, but it contains some dark, not thoroughly explained spots.
Spoiler Alert: Jan Thomas, the protagonist, offers a confession toward the end of the movie. Exactly why he acted the way he did according to this confession is surprising and inexplicable, as is the motive behind it. Did he, so late in the game, become afraid that the child would identify him if he lived? But if he were saved by Jan Thomas, the whole ""kidnapping"" would have been no more punishable than a tasteless, dangerous prank committed by two young boys. Be that as it may, this movie is truly worth seeing. 4 1/2 stars",1475798400,,741,4.578947368421052
