8134304,5,B000GRUVVU,Very informative video.,1509667200,,23,7.0
8134305,3,B000GRUVVU,A really nice guy. Mainly open G tuning and some in E. It's really the basics as far as a tutorial. Several outros of just the band playing. I recently watched Legendary Licks with Johnny Winter which was more of what I was looking for. Actually showed you breakdowns of nearly every lick he performed which was very helpful.,1464998400,,325,4.52542372881356
8134306,4,B000GRUVVU,"just for the person who mentioned that there are no references to open D tuning. Its the same as open E, just a whole tone down.

so all the licks used for open E work in open D.",1388102400,4,178,3.6842105263157894
8134307,5,B000GRUVVU,"Lee Roy is a charming individual and that helps make learning easier. You get how much he loves the slide
guitar instantly. Just learn his left hand damping technique and you're more than half way home.",1384387200,,202,4.638888888888889
8134308,3,B000GRUVVU,"I got this because I wanted to really explore Open D tuning and it turns out that one isn't mentioned at all.

Pros: Lee Roy is very entertaining and personable. Fabulous player. He breaks down each lesson very well and explains the ""why"" as well as the ""what"". Including his band to show the featured lick is a very nice touch because there are lot of extra licks to make the user back up and study over and over again.

Cons: I really hoped he was going to work more with Open D or DADGAD tuning.

Summary: It's a good tutorial for the money and made me a big fan of Lee Roy Parnell.",1373068800,,585,4.114035087719298
8134309,5,B000GRUVVU,"I had the privilege of watching Lee Roy numerous times in Houston. He was ready for the big time then, and this video is wonderful to watch. Even if I can't play like Lee Roy, I can dream.
Lee Roy, WHO?",1323302400,,202,3.951219512195122
