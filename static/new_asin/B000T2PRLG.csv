2893652,5,B000T2PRLG,"I've been doing yoga for several years and have never gotten the full grasp of what Ujjayi breathing was.  I also have asthma and have always struggled to get full breaths.  I watched and did the breathing exercises in this dvd the other night and was AMAZED at the difference in my breathing the next morning in my yoga practice.  I finally was able to breath with the same sounds I've heard for so long on dvds and in class.

I have continued to practice the breathing here and there while driving the car, going through my daily activities and feel so refreshed and in command of my breathing.  I highly recommend this!",1193788800,48,622,4.469026548672566

2893655,5,B000T2PRLG,Wow. I felt like I was on a different planet after doing this dvd. It relaxes you and takes you to another space.,1439683200,,113,3.9565217391304346
2893656,5,B000T2PRLG,Max Strom has created a simple and relatable guide for better breathing and learning to use the breath to experience healing and balance. His gentle and strong nature will leave you feelings confident that you are in good hands.,1428710400,2,228,4.871794871794871
2893657,4,B000T2PRLG,"I bought this dvd as a complement to a few books I have read on breathing. I enjoyed the dvd because it's a great starting point for people just learning how to breathe. However, eventually you will want to move beyond this to something more. When you are ready there are some excellent books to read.

I would recommend the following:

Carola Speads Ways to Better Breathing

The Art of Breathing by Nancy Zi

Free Your Breath, Free Your Life by Dennis Lewis

The one, by Carola Speads is my favorite and is also a testament to how her life benefited from proper breathing. She outlived her husband by many years and died at the age of 92. None of the other authors, including Mr. Strom, have reached that age so that is why her book is the first one recommended. In fact, Dennis Lewis, who is in the third place on my list, even references Carola in his introduction for pointing him to some information he wasn't aware of.

Anyway, do not let my comments about other books chase you away. This is a great dvd and you will get a lot out of it. However, it's not a complete system and certainly not Pranayama, as another reviewer mentioned. It's a perfect start that, with a hunger for more would eventually lead you to the three books I've mentioned.",1414108800,6,1252,4.421739130434783
2893658,5,B000T2PRLG,He is an awesome teacher.,1412812800,,25,4.2
2893659,5,B000T2PRLG,"What a breakthrough - as a PTSD survivor, I finally came to the realization that a lifetime's worth of trauma resulted in a lifetime's worth of nervous, shallow breathing. It's been keeping my nervous system in varying degrees of ""fight-or-flight"" hypervigilence, which is extremely detrimental to physical and mental health.

Remaining locked in that toxic style of breathing keeps me in a perpetual state of fear.  Nervous/shallow breathing was actually affecting my ability to relax, enjoy my life and relate to others effectively (how can I if my body's locked in fear as an innate protective measure?)

Max Strom's ""Learn To Breathe"" provides extremely helpful exercises to actually retrain myself from that automatic breathing pattern. It is a MUST for Trauma/PTSD/Domestic Violence/Rape/Depression survivors.

The exercises look deceptively simple, but actually are not - they are skills that survivors must use on a daily basis to avoid slipping back into unhealthy breathing patterns.  I also highly recommend Strom's books ""A Life Worth Breathing"" and ""There Is No App For Happiness"".

To every survivor out there...please know that you really deserve to take care of yourself and end the defensive breathing patterns that are keeping you in a perpetual state of unease/fear/nervousness/depression. Incorporating these daily breathing exercises will change the quality of your life. You deserve to take every breath in peace, not fear.",1410739200,15,1445,5.486486486486487

2893662,3,B000T2PRLG,"The techniques given are pretty basic but done in a good flowing manner.
Did not like the packaging at all (the digipack) as all my other DVDs are in DVD box pack - trying to file, locate and unloading it from the digipack is somewhat awkward.",1396569600,,243,4.304347826086956

2893667,2,B000T2PRLG,"perhaps ok for total beginners to the importance of breathing

but no real pranayama - none !

First a lot of really basic talk ... then,

just 5 simple exercises repeated over and over by 4 women and one guy all dressed in white trying to keep expressionless faces, as the camera zooms in on seemingly a more attractive female,
while Max (off camera) tells them over and over to make sure their palms are still facing up, unbelievable.

For real in depth serious information on pranayama

these are excellent books

2893668,5,B000T2PRLG,"goes to the core of breathing exercises, not a lot of unnecessary talking very easy for anyone to do, 5-10 minutes daily doing these exercises can make a huge difference throughout your day, better able to deal with stress and emotions in general.  I know it has for me.",1349481600,,270,4.510204081632653
2893669,5,B000T2PRLG,"I'm just searching for alternatives... I'm a scuba diver, one day I met a woman, she told me that divers are always happy for the way they breathe. After a dive we are always happy, that's true I thought, it was for the nitrogen effects... So I started to search for alternatives... My rule is: ""Do not trust what the system tells you, just find your answers  inside of you, never stop searching"". So, alternatives.
I saw the photo of him and I realized there was something especial in his smile.
I bought the Dvd and it's great!
Easy to practice, easily explained, gives you emotions.
Wonderful for beginners...",1331424000,,612,4.614678899082569
2893670,5,B000T2PRLG,The breathing exercises in this DVD are simple yet effective.  Opening up the heart/chest are will surely release everything that has been stored within.,1326758400,,153,5.375
2893671,5,B000T2PRLG,"I only just purchased this DVD and started using it, but already I've noticed a difference in my breathing.  As someone who smoked for 12 years and developed asthma, I just tried my yoga routine for the first time since practicing the breathing exercises on this DVD.  Wow!  What a difference.  I always felt like I couldn't get a deep breath when I was supposed to in yoga, but after doing these exercises my ability to inhale deeply has greatly increased...in only 5 days.  According to the DVD, I believe he says it will take approximately two years to maximize breathing, so I'm more than happy that the exercises have worked this well and I'm excited about what benefit I will get from it over time.",1325635200,3,704,4.555555555555555
2893672,5,B000T2PRLG,"I purchased this DVD awhile ago and didn't get around to viewing it until now. My intuition has been leading me to more breathwork lately so I am interested in breathing/pranayama techniques. I don't believe in complicated and frankly if it is too complicated I probably won't use it. Max Strom is commanding in an easy, peaceful manner. I saw a clip of this DVD on YouTube so you can view a sample there before purchasing. Strom demonstrates his breathing techniques and explains them well and since it is easy to do you won't be struggling with it. His techniques seem to be based partially on Qi Gong/martial arts techniques or stances. There is a group demonstrating the breathing techniques you can practice with on the DVD and the setting is pleasant and peaceful. He doesn't do belly breathing, it is lung breathing and expansion which he explains helps release emotions and tension, the chest areas being the ""shield"" that prevents us from opening emotionally/spiritually. He explains the benefits of breathing techniques and his is manner is gracious so he makes you want to try the techniques. I found his ocean breath so easy and relaxing I do it for a few minutes when I take breaks during the day. Recommended!",1319587200,10,1223,4.800947867298579
2893673,5,B000T2PRLG,"Max is a calm and balanced human.
He leads you into just a couple of breathing practices that will carry you into your days and keep you balanced no matter what happens.
But you must do the proper breathing that is instructed from Max.
Give yourself the gift of this dvd or better yet someone else.",1286755200,2,298,4.339285714285714
2893674,5,B000T2PRLG,"I LOVE what Max has done on this DVD!  It is a useful tool for any and everyone. It is a resource I implement personally and recommend regularly to friends, family and clients to calm the mind, open the heart and energize and heal the body.  Max's instruction is clear, concise and is easy to follow and use by people of all ages and physical abilities. You will not be disappointed.",1280880000,,383,4.380281690140845
2893675,5,B000T2PRLG,"Having practiced yoga over 3 decades, and qi gong the past 6 years, I own wide collection of yoga practice videos.  Max Strom's ""Learn to Breathe"" is far and away unique from the rest.  The video is beautifully done, and the practice is deceptively easy to do, yet the results are phenomenal.  Following Max's breathing practice I better handle whatever comes my way thruout my day.  Do yourself a favor and buy this DVD.  You won't be disappointed.",1229731200,27,449,4.705128205128205
2893676,5,B000T2PRLG,"I was lucky enough to be a beginner studying with Max, and I have to say that his emphasis on breathing is what makes his yoga practice.  Drawing from all his teachings on breathing over the years of teaching, he's made a perfectly simple, elegant, and instructive DVD which will teach you all the basics of breathing and how central it is to all our life, not just our yoga practice.
  There's nothing esoteric about it, no strange jargon, just some simple lessons about our breath and beginning exercises that easily incorporate into your practice.  It is suitable for all ages, conditions of health, and even locations... you'll find yourself practicing these techniques in your most uncomfortable situations.  I would say this video is a great addition to one's yoga practice, but I wonder if anybody really has a yoga practice without such an understanding of breath.",1205539200,8,872,4.904761904761905

2893678,5,B000T2PRLG,"Max Strom is a gifted teacher who in his new DVD exposes us to different forms of breathwork, or pranayama.  Pranayama is a tool that has been used for thousands of years to calm the body and mind or achieve sprirtual transformation.  This DVD is simple to use and easy to understand.  Max has a calm, gentle energy that ties the whole DVD together.  Highly recomended.",1203033600,12,369,4.545454545454546
2893679,5,B000T2PRLG,"Beautiful. Inspiring. Life Changing.
Mr. Strom's latest DVD is another example of his profound and accessible style of teaching. I write this review out of deep respect for his work.
If you are looking for tools to lift your health and well being to another level you found a good one.
Whether you decide to integrate the breath work taught on this DVD into your yoga practice or into your daily life, you will notice tremendous changes. Expansion, deep peace and happiness are just some of the side effects you might experience.
As someone who has taken many of Mr. Strom's workshops and as the manager of a large yoga center in the San Francisco Bay Area I do recommend his teachings highly and on a daily basis. It is an honor to spread the word about the gifts he brings into this world. He is a heart-centered, intelligent, and  innovative teacher. Someone you trust from the bottom of your heart. Check his website [...] - if you ever have the opportunity to experience him in person, don't let it pass. He teaches around the world and yet, he remains humble, sweet, and accessible. You will love him.",1202947200,40,1107,4.590909090909091
2893680,5,B000T2PRLG,"I have had allergy based asthma for over 40 years.  As a 9 year old child I was at a residential asthma center in Colorado while my family continued to live in Missouri.  The asthma center is the first place that taught me how to breath to facilitate the opening of the bronchials and to increase the capacity of the lungs.  After traditional and alternative medicine as well as a lot of work within myself, my asthma is almost gone.  I continue to look within myself as well as for excercises, meditations etc. that will facilitate the release of the remaining asthma.

Max Strom's Learn to Breathe DVD has provided me with what I believe is one of the final pieces in my quest for an asthma free life.  I enjoy all of the excercises.  My personal favorite is what I call the 3 minute breath in which one breaths as slowly as possible for 3 minutes.  At the end of the 3 minutes you note how many breaths you have taken (an inhale and exhale count as one breath).  It is still amazing to me the watch the process and the progress that happens with this simple excercise.

In addition to the excercises I appreciate Max's explanation of how our busy lives affect our breathing.

My only wish is that it was possible to do all of the breathing lessions consecutively without stopping between each one.

Buy this breath DVD as it will change your life (asthma or not).",1202515200,32,1366,4.42
2893681,4,B000T2PRLG,"Max Strom is a wonderful teacher... the breathing techniques taught in this DVD are very calming, which was my main goal to achieve.  My only wish is that the DVD was longer.  I recommend this item to those who are intersted in using breathing techniques to calm the mind and body... but I also recommend buying it on sale for less than $15.",1198627200,16,341,4.396825396825397
2893682,5,B000T2PRLG,"Wonderful DVD that focuses on something so central to our existence and quality of life. I was introduced to pranayama breathing through yoga, but clearly, not to this extent. Max Strom does a thorough job detailing the benefits of proper breathing, providing helpful practice sessions, and offering thought-provoking insight that guides one to a new perception.

I've watched parts of this video repeatedly already, and I get something each time. It's educational (amazing how much I didn't realize about something so elemental as breathing), and it's a great reminder that we all possess this ability, this inherent tool, when harnessed properly, that can be so impactful to our relationships and the way we live with one another. Breathing [properly] should not be overlooked or taken for granted, and neither should this DVD.",1194998400,52,829,5.28030303030303

8207570,4,B000T2PRLG,"I recently picked up this DVD at a used book sale.  As a yoga practitioner/new yoga instructor, I was familiar with Max Strom, the instructor on this video, and I knew that his DVDs were well-regarded.  I thought that his breath instruction might be beneficial for my own teaching.

The Main Menu includes segments for Talk on Breathing - Learning & Practicing - Practice Only.  In the talk (just over 7 mins), Strom provides a discussion of why the breath is important and how it affects us.  The Learning & Practicing section contains five separate breath segments.  In each, Strom first introduces the breath technique and explains how to perform it, and this is followed by a group of students practicing for several minutes based on Strom's voiceover.  I have broken these segments down further below, including offering times.

OCEAN BREATHING (5:07 mins)
This breath is very similar to the ujjayi breath in yoga, except that Strom takes audible breaths in and out through an open mouth.  He stands in horse stance to perform this breath, but for the group practice, an alternative is shown in a chair.

OPENING THE RIBCAGE (5:00 mins)
This is a four-part lateral breath that adds a slight breath retention.  Again, Strom performs the breath standing, but a seated alternate is demonstrated in the group session.

RISING & FALLING (6:02 mins)
Here Strorm begins by practicing the Ocean breath, but on the out breath, he adds a wide-legged forward bend from the hips.  Several modifications are shown in the group practice, including being seated and using blocks.

THE FOUNTAIN BREATH (5:37 mins)
Strom states that this is his favorite breath.  It involves breathing in as the hands rise to the heart and then exhaling forceful as the hands burst overhead, like a fountain.  Strom gives a bit more lecture at the start of this segment, stressing the importance of ""affecting"" versus ""infecting"" others.  The group practice again shows a chair option.

THE MIND MEETS BREATH (7:47 mins)
For this practice, Storm is seated with a straight spine.  The instruction is simply to take deep breaths for a timed (three-minute) period and to count the number of breaths during this interval.  The goal is that over time, the breaths will deepen, and there will be a lower number of total breaths per period.

This is a well-done DVD, although as someone experienced in yoga, there wasn't much here that was new to me.  I did like the Opening the Ribcage segment and will probably try to incorporate this into my classes.  Otherwise, I think this DVD would be best suited either to those who are very new to yoga or those who are not interested in yoga at all but who still want to derive the benefit of breathing strategies.",1464998400,6,2721,4.816810344827586
8207571,2,B000T2PRLG,I didn't like this DVD. It has few breathing exercises but very boring.,1446681600,,71,4.538461538461538
8207572,5,B000T2PRLG,"Really great DVD! Got it on Netflix and decided it was something I wanted to have on hand, proper breathing really makes you feel better.",1446076800,2,137,4.52
