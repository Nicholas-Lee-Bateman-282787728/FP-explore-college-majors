8397257,5,B003I2KQ1K,I love this show. I've heard the subtitles aren't great but I haven't watched with them yet.  I'm glad to find this show available on DVD as it's impossible to find in the States.,1489881600,,179,4.264705882352941

8397259,3,B003I2KQ1K,"I love the series and originally viewed it on Crunchyroll but the subtitles on this set are truly crap - incomplete sentences and total gibberish at times.  Very, very disappointing.",1473638400,,182,5.066666666666666
8397260,3,B003I2KQ1K,"The show is wonderful, but the English subtitles are poorly translated.  These are not just idiomatic errors, but fundamental ones.  He, she, you, I, are indiscriminately interchanged, as are can and cannot.  Also, names of the characters are presented differently, erroneously, throughout. Results in very difficult and frustrating time trying to follow the story. Without having seen a better translated version, and knowing a little Japanese myself, I would have been completely lost. The show, however, and its characters are adorable.",1426118400,,539,5.62962962962963

8397263,5,B003I2KQ1K,"I got hooked on this with the first volume, and just had to finish it.  You are rooting for Nodame to win the guy, but she is kind of clueless.  It has a happy ending, which I liked.",1376611200,,182,3.763157894736842

8397265,5,B003I2KQ1K,"About the translation, Chinese is better than English. And ppl who doesn't know JP culture at all might be confused a little(for my friend). That doesn't matter, it is still a funny and interesting story though!",1326240000,2,211,4.888888888888889
