8015752,3,B0001OGVGW,"I did like it because I do like Ronin Warriors/Samurai Troopers, but the storyline wasn't as good as the series was. Mostly, it was flashbacks. Still, an okay DVD.",1383264000,,163,4.655172413793103
8015753,5,B0001OGVGW,I love ronin warriors it's a great cartoon series an entertaining trip from the real world with something for every person/kid. This cartoon should definately be checked out by everyone you won't find yourself dissapointed.,1261526400,,223,5.4
8015754,4,B0001OGVGW,"With this being an OVA, and the Dynasty King defeated, the warriors find themselves facing a new threat. The story is different, and not as exciting as the original series, but it's still good. The voice acting is decent, better subbed than dubbed (my personal opinion though).",1202860800,,277,4.914893617021277
8015755,2,B0001OGVGW,Disappointing storyline. This was not what I expected from a Ronin Warriors/Samurai Troopers story. There was some nice anime though. I just wish the story had lived up to the original series.,1183680000,,192,5.03125
8015756,1,B0001OGVGW,"I wasn't impressed. Sage's voice wasn't at all the same, the story was retarded, nothing at all like the original series. I was disappointed.",1153094400,,141,4.916666666666667
