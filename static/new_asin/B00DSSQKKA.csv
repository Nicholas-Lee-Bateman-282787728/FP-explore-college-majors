8597301,5,B00DSSQKKA,"I love this film so much.  In 48 years, it hasn't lost anything at all.  Funny as anything, I'm sure it will appeal to almost everybody.  Language tracks are available for Russian, English, and French, with subtitles in those three, plus Spanish and German.  I especially love   (Natal'ya Varley), who is so pretty and expressive.  She keeps me in stitches with the hundreds of silly looks she puts on her face.  She's an extremely good actress and beloved by the Russians.  Please check this out; you won't regret it!",1391385600,,518,4.730337078651686
