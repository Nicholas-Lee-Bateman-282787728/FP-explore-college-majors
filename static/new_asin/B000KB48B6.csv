2687308,3,B000KB48B6,"With film number 27 in Sid's October HorrorGreatSuccess we landed on a lesser known straight to video film called Wilderness. It came on one of the movie channels late last night and made it's way on the list since it fit into the British horror genre, which we had yet to do in our film fest. With past films like The Descent and Dog soldiers we figured we'd be in for a nice treat coupled with the well liked British accents. It turned out to be pretty middle of the road in our opinion but still was really well done.

Wilderness revolves around of group of delinquent inmates who can't be controlled in the normal prison system. Because of this they're brought out into the harsh wilderness to learn how to work together in hopes they won't wind up on a future episode of cops. As they attempt to start on their mission they come to discover someone with a pack of insane wolf dogs is on a quest to finish them. Now there focus is strictly staying alive which is quite a feat considering they're in the middle of nowhere.

Wilderness turned out to be a solid flick with some great atmosphere going for it. It proved yet again that British horror conjures up some fine pieces of work in a sometimes mundane film world. The film does get a slight bit dull at certain points, but it earned itself a four star rating thanks to a really good twist at the end. One that you may not see coming. So we certainly can recommend Wilderness as a flick worth checking out if your a fan of the outdoor manhunt genre, which obviously you know we are. With predecessors like Death Ring, Surviving the Game, and Death Hunt, Wilderness fit's somewhere in on the totem pole but in a very different way.",1256688000,,1687,4.386581469648562

2687310,4,B000KB48B6,"I had to mention that because there are a couple of times in this movie when the killer camouflages himself as turf and when the soon to be victims walk away, the shrubbery slithers off in the opposite direction. This sounds absurd but in this movie it is effective...but funny. There's nothing funny when the slaughter starts and it can be startling and very brutal.  A group of young male delinquents are brought to a now deserted island wilderness to try and see if these somewhat nasty misfits can straighten themselves out by camping and learning to survive the wilderness and each other. They meet up with their female counterparts-but the bad boys and girls are the usual assortment-the bully, the coward, the wimp, the misunderstood one and of course a traitor.  One of the males at the young juvenile offenders facility had recently committed suicide and the killer is the shrubbery, i mean the boys' father.  This is not a spoiler since the killers identity is known pretty quick.

The movie is well-made and directed and has genuine suspense and the killings are brutal, raw and very very gory including someone being devoured by a pack of dogs.  The biggest surprise of the movie is the killer has ""inside"" help.

If you like seeing thuggish brats being picked off one by one this is a movie I would recommend.

This is indeed a spoiler alert but someone made a big mistake when they show a knife fight between a British commando and a youth and the youth wins. If you can ignore this supreme piece of silliness-the movie on the whole is a keeper. BOOYAH!  That booyah was for my friend Jason.",1250380800,,1605,4.646643109540636
2687311,5,B000KB48B6,"I thought that this movie was going to be really terrible, but I actually enjoyed it. It was my first time seeing actor Toby Kebbell, who may I say is amazing.  It also opened my eyes to other british films.  Definitely would recommend!",1239148800,,236,4.465116279069767
2687312,4,B000KB48B6,"Sometimes I like my horror faire served up nice and rare, with plenty of blood left in it to gush out each time you bite in to it.  Wilderness is sort of like that, taking a cast of pretty unlikable characters, throwing them in a desperate situation in an isolated environment, and letting the blood flow wherever it may.  Admittedly, it can be hard to win me over with a team of bullies and whiners, but director Michael J. Basset proved himself well up to the challenge.  Wilderness won't find itself a spot on my list of favorite horror movies, but it does its whole survival horror thing quite well indeed.

The Wilderness of this film's title refers to a rugged, uninhabited island that used to be used for soldier survival training but now offers itself as an ideal place for troubled young people to get a pungent taste of reality and hopefully learn to work together rather than continue in their juvenile delinquent ways.  Our gang of misfits land themselves a week's stay there following the most unfortunate death of one of their own.  It turns out that they are far from alone there, however.  Meeting up with a small, similar group of juvenile delinquent girls doesn't bother anyone, apart from the two group leaders, but finding themselves hunted by a mad killer (and his ferocious dogs) is generally looked upon as bad news all the way around.  There isn't a lot of suspense built around the killer's identity, as that is revealed pretty early on.  The focus is more on the teens' interaction as their numbers dwindle and the psychotic thought processes that landed them all in a Young Offenders Institution to begin with rear their ugly and increasingly violent heads.  Can these malcontents somehow work together as a team in order to survive?  Uh, no.

There's not an excessive amount of gore by any means, but Wilderness does deliver a few impressive little scenes.  Don't expect a lot of character development here, though.  The only potentially interesting character is Callum (Toby Kebbell), the new guy, but the air of mystery he brings with him never amounts to anything.  Even though he's the only one with enough gumption to stand up to the bully Steve (Steve Wight), he never manages to distinguish himself from the others.  As much as I hated the little runt, I have to say that the character of Steve pretty much made the movie for me.  The killer ultimately provides little in the way of satisfaction, and not just because we know his identity so early on.  Steve makes sure we don't get bored.

Wilderness may not have a lot in the way of originality to offer, but it is a pretty taut thriller that throws us gorehounds a few juicy little bones along the way.  Don't expect the psychological undertones of a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lord-of-the-Flies-Penguin-Great-Books-of-the-20th-Century/dp/0140283331/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lord of the Flies (Penguin Great Books of the 20th Century)</a>&nbsp;or the good vs. evil dichotomy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Most-Dangerous-Game-Criterion-Collection/dp/0780022114/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Most Dangerous Game - Criterion Collection</a>, though.  This film is too raw and primal to play any of those psychological games.  I found it pretty much impossible to like any of these characters; heck, I didn't even like the dogs, and I'm the biggest animal lover you're likely to find.  It says something for Michael J. Basset's directorial skills that I liked this film as much as I did - it can't be easy to make a good movie when none of your characters has any redeeming qualities whatsoever.",1217030400,5,3681,5.2016949152542376

It's hard to feel sorry for the brats doing time, but a few personalities do emerge that you can feel sympathy for...eventually.  Troubled teens are taken to a wooded island in hopes of teaching them some life lessons. The only lesson that seems to get taught is how crazy some people are when it comes to revenge!

2687317,4,B000KB48B6,"Surprisingly effective and sometimes terrifying British horror thriller.  Takes a standard horror movie premise and ups the anti with some unpredictable twists and turns.  The plot is simple and straightforward, the locale atmospheric, and the direction taut.  I had never heard of this film so was immediately surprised by the strong performances and gut wrenching action.  A good hybrid between the interesting horror movie ""American Gothic"" and the action classic ""Deliverance"".  This one goes straight for the throat and is pretty unrelenting as far as violence; so not for the faint of heart.  This is a wild ride and I'm wildly enthusiastic about recommending.

2687329,5,B000KB48B6,"Looking to support British horror efforts as much as I can, I bought a film that seems to have escaped my attention. Wilderness is a 2006 British horror film directed by Michael J. Bassett (Solomon Kane, Deathwatch, Silent Hill: Revelations 3D) and with a script by Dario Poloni (Black Death).

Wilderness stars Alex Reid (The Descent, Arachnid), Toby Kebbell (Dead Man's Shoes, RocknRolla) , Stephen Wright (Highlander: The Source) and Adam Deacon (Jack Falls, Dead Set) and horror regular Sean Pertwee (The Descent, Dog Soldiers, The 4th Reich, Doomsday) and comes with the following synopsis:
""Sent away on a military boot camp, a group of young offenders arrive on an uninhabited island only to find they are not alone. A psychopathic hunter lies in wait, snaring his victims with imaginative booby traps, ravenous dogs & some truly deadly weaponry.
From the director of Deathwatch, horror and violence bursts onto the screen in this masterfully choreographed survival thriller.""

I've mentioned it numerous times before but to my mind, stories of hunting humans have been a horror staple on the screen for as long as there have been movies. The film adaptation of Richard Connell's Hounds of Zaroff, which was turned into The Most Dangerous Game in 1932 could be seen as the granddaddy of them all, spawning numerous imitators from the poor (Steve Austin's The Condemned) to one of my personal favourites, Predator, going via Van Damme's Hard Target and to the box office record breaker The Hunger Games, based on the books by Suzanne Collins.
Wilderness has been described as ""Scum meets Battle Royale"" but I don't think that's quite accurate...
The film's initial opening does not betray the horror that is to come later and sets the scene nicely, establishing the hierarchy among the group and allowing the viewer to gain insight into the relationships and background to the characters.
The characters themselves are quite unique and most certainly not your usual bunch of spoilt rich teens that seem to populate every other movie in the genre and once on the island and things start to go wrong, the dynamics of their interaction with each other is a little reminiscent of Lord of the Flies. Stephen Wight's character is particularly loathesome and I for one spent the film waiting for his demise.

I have no idea how Wilderness managed to get a 15 certificate from the BBFC. There are scenes of dismemberment, throats being cut, disembowelment and other assorted nastiness that will keep gorehounds happy. In particular, Sean Pertwee's death scene as he is ripped apart by dogs is particularly brutal... and I am ruining nothing by saying this since a picture of it is on the back of the DVD cover and so, it comes as no surprise!

On that note, the special effects are largely practical and quite satisfying to see them done very well. In particular, I was impressed by the use of real dogs whenever possible. All of that said, some may feel that this is not horror but I would suggest that Wilderness with its level of gore, brutality and a psychopathic killer taking out the group one at a time allows the film to sit comfortably in the survival horror subgenre.

Critically, I felt little sympathy for the young offenders. It could be argued that some of them were victims of circumstance but for the majority of them, I felt no pity when they met their respective ends at the hands of the man stalking them. On that note, I feel it is worthy to mention that the antagonist of the piece made me think that this would be what would happen if Rambo decided to target a specific group and exact his own particular brand of brutal retribution.

The reveal of the stalker's motives, although I feel it came to early in proceedings, is quite satisfying and leads to a suitable culmination for proceedings; and even if the ending is a little twee, it does not detract from how much I genuinely enjoyed watching Wilderness. This film won't tax your brains too much but it didn't fail to entertain.",1355616000,,4003,4.819505094614265
2687330,3,B000KB48B6,"Wilderness is a thrilling action/horror film. Several juveniles are sent to a deserted island to rehabilitate and learn team work; they are soon attacked by an unknown person and chased through the island. It has a lot of thrills, but also has many flaws.

What did I like? As I previously stated, Wilderness is thrilling; the dog chasing scenes are epic. It also has some decent effects for gore fans. You'll see everything from faces being torn off to bodies being burned. The acting ranged from decent to bad.

What did I dislike? Some of the acting was bad. Also, some off tge dialogue seemed off and forced. I ended disliking most of the characters. It doesn't really build the characters either; we never find out what most of them did to get there. And the ending was decent, but also slightly generic.

Overall, Wilderness is the definition of a time killer. Although the story, and some of the acting, is bad, it is also very fun and thrilling. I recommend watching Wilderness. If you're interested, Wilderness is available on Netflix Streaming and Amazon Prime if you want to save money.

Wilderness has excessive scenes of violence and gore, plenty of strong language, and a sex scene (no nudity, only some motion can be seen in the dark and some noises can be heard).",1341446400,,1279,4.696428571428571

2687334,4,B000KB48B6,"Shot in Northern Ireland, Wilderness (2006) is a gritty and gory thriller, centered on the adventures of a group of inmates from a boy's juvenile prison, who face unexpected danger, while serving disciplinary punishment on a remote island.  Although the synopsis on the DVD makes it sounds like all male struggle for survival, that is not the case.

When an bullied inmate at Moorgate Young Offenders Institute commits suicide by cutting his wrists, the members of the dead boy's dorm are sent to a remote (and quite large) island for some disciplinary action.  The group of six lads under the supervision of prison official Jed Wyler (Sean Pertwee), soon discover that they are not alone on the island.  Mandy (Lenora Crichlow) and Jo (Karly Greene), two inmates from a girl's detention facility are there with Louise (Alex Reid) their supervisor.

The two groups come together, after a tramp living on the island is found dead with his throat ripped open.  Callum (Toby Kebbell) a newcomer, is suspected of the crime.  One of the boys disappears as a prelude to the group being viciously attacked, by a hail of deadly arrows, and a pack of wild dogs.  The assault leaves the shaken group without any supervision, and they struggle to establish some kind of order, and find a way to survive against a ruthless and well-prepared opponent.

The story that could have taken the all male Lord of the Flies route, instead is another routine teenagers in distress in the woods tale.  Instead of being violent hardcases, the boys are mostly passive, except for Steve (Stephen Wight) who exhibits resentment for authority.  Steve's buddy Lewis (Luke Neal) is the most physically imposing, but is pretty passive after hooking up with Jo.  Lindsay (Ben McKay), is the weak sniveling type.

The lads soon figure out why they are being attacked, but aside from a knife, they have no weapons, and lack the unity and skills which to fight back.  The mysterious killer (Stephen Don) remains hidden, using his pack of dogs to terrorize the befuddled teens, who fall victim to various traps he has setup.  With possession of the knife, Callum has a leadership role, searching for a way off the island.  Eventually the pressure finally brings Steve's dark side out, but he can't match the killer's deadly skills.

Featuring some tense well executed action sequences and some cruel kills, director Michael J. Bassett delivers some gruesome cringeworthy moments and shocking visuals.  Introducing the females, keeps the film from quite living up to its potential, but Wilderness is still a taught entertaining thriller, with a British flavor.  Strongly recommended.",1286236800,,2646,5.0137299771167045
2687335,3,B000KB48B6,"A bunch of British misfits from juvenile hall are brought to a ""deserted"" island to become rehabilitated after one of their fellow inmates commits suicide.  Sean Pertwee (of ""Dog Soldiers,"" ""Doomsday,"" ""Equilibrium"" and ""Mutant Chronicles"" fame) is the warden who's in charge of the boys.  As with many a horror movie on a deserted island, the tension builds before the body count suddenly increases in a variety of novel ways, the best of which involves a bear trap.

While ""Wilderness"" is certainly worth seeing, it does plod along at times when, perhaps, it should not.  Even though all that might be due to the killer taking his time to eliminate the island's visitors, it nevertheless gives the movie a detrimental and uneven pace.

Not quite as good as ""Deathwatch,"" which shares the same director.",1283385600,,804,4.970149253731344
2687336,5,B000KB48B6,"Before hack master Michael Bay remakes this classic, you owe it to yourself to take two hours out of your daily routine and give this 2006 suspense gem a chance.

The plot is simple: a group of young thugs in a juvenile detention center in England are sent to an island to build up their minds and bodies. To their surprise, the island is not deserted but already has a killer waiting for them, a pathetic recluse who is murdered and a group of women camping out.

The bad boys are totally believable and do major stuff--like two of the worst murdering the innocent recluse.  One of them proves to be a heroic figure and when the savage murders begin, he fights back.

The killings are shocking because you aren't expecting them and the mysterious slasher sets fatal traps all over the island that kills both girls add guys with gusto.

One minor complaint is that sometimes the thick Irish and British accents are hard to understand. Also, when the killer is finally unmssked, it took me several moments before I could place him.
