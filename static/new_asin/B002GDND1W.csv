8542260,5,B002GDND1W,"This is a great DVD by Dale Degroff, who is probably the greatest bartender/mixologist of all time. You can use this video as a 101 intro DVD to train bartenders, particularly the beginning where he talks about professionalism and the tools of the trade.... all the way to bartenders keeping their fingernails clean and polished. His books are great also. Buy this now.",1383264000,,369,4.873015873015873
