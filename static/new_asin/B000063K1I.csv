7959921,3,B000063K1I,"Scream of the Demon Lover (Blood Castle) (Ivanna)
Not awful but not great early 70's Italian/Spanish-made, English-dubbed horror flick.  At the turn of the century an emancipated female doctor is hired to help a research chemist experiment on who-knows-what.  She arrives to find hostile villagers, a chilly chauvinistic welcome at the castle, jealous female servants, and a creepy nighttime visitor.  The visitor turns out to be the family secret; a mad, disfigured brother who is offing the local females.  That explains the hostile locals.  The quality of the DVD is not terrible but the film needs re-mastering.  At 93 minutes this DVD is not complete.  The film is also known as Blood Castle and Ivanna.  Recommended for fans of the genre.
Hatchet for the Honeymoon
An early 70's Italian-made, English-dubbed horror film.  A rich, badly married wedding dress designer goes nutso when he becomes attracted to models wearing his designs.  I think he's in the wrong profession.  He kills his wife, then her ghost comes back to nag him.  The film was made by Mario Bava, which is a recommendation all by itself.  The quality of the DVD is OK but this film is available by itself from Kino Lorber and THAT ONE is the one to get.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1451692800,3,1264,4.845794392523365

""Scream of the Demon Lover"" is an atmospheric Spanish/Italian with a unique, quirky appeal.  It's very different in mood and approach from its contemporaries, so don't expect this to feel like ""Kill Baby, Kill"" or ""Something Creeping in the Dark.""  The film has a certain humor to it.  Most of this is in the form of the female lead's jaw-dropping rudeness to her titled employer.  This was filmed during the height of the wretched women's lib movement and so her constant back-talking and insubordination probably seemed socially relevent at the time.  However, if a woman (or a man, for that matter) had ever been this disrespectful and obnoxious to a European Count or Baron, they'd probably have been condemned to the the family dungeon...or at least roughed up a bit.

The makeup effects are quite good and this appears to have been mastered from a vintage American TV print.  All the smut scenes have been censored out of this print.  Also, a few words spoken at the film's climax have been stripped out.  Shame...

Bava fans have probably all heard about ""Hatchet for the Honeymoon.""  I know I had and was interested in finally seeing the film.  It was filmed in 1969 and as evidenced in so many other films from the period, the infectious (and ugly) post-summer of love fashions did nothing for the people wearing them.  Consequently, the film lacks the good looks of say, ""Blood and Black Lace"" or ""Black Sunday.""

Still, if you're willing to make a go of it, the film does have its moments.  It's very offbeat and the music isn't bad, especially the theme song.  The plot does keep you guessing until the end and the supernatural element is played for both humor and irony to good effect.

All in all, a fun movie evening for a bargain price...you'll enjoy them.",1382918400,2,1848,4.721875
7959923,3,B000063K1I,"This is a fun collection of two weird little films and a classic radio show - which is missing from the product description, something Triton Media usually included as an extra.

HATCHET FOR THE HONEYMOON is a good thriller by legendary Italian director Mario Bava.  There are some supernatural elements but the film is more a very stylized murder mystery.  The print used here is somewhat widescreen but there is still information missing on the edges.  The colors seem a bit off as well, with many people having a green pallor to their skin (not intentional, I assure you).

SCREAM OF THE DEMON LOVER is an odd duck.  There is a disfigured killer loose in a small village, and a beautiful scientist has nightmares that she's being attacked.  Something has been trimmed in this print because there are a couple abrupt jumps in the action.  This one runs just over 94 minutes and not the 96 listed on the box.  However it's still a fun film even in this version.

The other extra here is a 1932 radio adaptation of FRANKENSTEIN.  It's a thirteen episode production based on the original Mary Shelly novel that runs 3 hours.  Although a little creaky for today's youth, it's a good listen to have on while you're doing things in the house.

For the price this isn't a shabby set to get if you're in the right frame of mind.",1271376000,4,1322,4.5508474576271185
