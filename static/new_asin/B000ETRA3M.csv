2534152,5,B000ETRA3M,"I have been a big fan of David Hobson, one of my favorite tenors of all time, since when I first saw him in Baz Luhrmann's production of La Boheme.  This amazing Australian opera singer has a wonderfully rich quality in his voice and it is showcased in all his performances.  This 1993 production of Orphee et Eurydice is just as beautiful, with Hobson as Orpheus, the faithful husband who descends into the fiery depths of Hades to rescue his beloved Eurydice (Amanda Thane).  He makes an agreement with the gods that he will not gaze upon his wife until he has rescued her.  Will he keep his promise?

Though, this story is poignant, the beautiful music (composed by Gluck) lifts you away with its gorgeous melodies.  Also, Hobson is a beautiful and convincing actor, as is all of the cast.  I definitely reccomend this.",1172361600,7,822,4.627586206896551
2534153,3,B000ETRA3M,"German composer Christoph Willibald Gluck hit his musical high watermark with this renowned 1762 opera, famous for bringing a far greater sense of dramatic structure to opera seria than previous Italianate works. Twelve years after its debut, Gluck revised the work to suit French tastes in the 1774 Paris Opera production by adjusting the male lead role from a castrato to a high tenor and adding dance sequences. Stefanos Lazaridis' 1993 Opera Australia production adapts that Paris Opera production and further adds decidedly contemporary elements by staging it on a modern minimalist set. Now finally on DVD in 2006, the result is arresting to the eye and often to the ear, though casting poses some problems for the surging melodrama of this relatively brief opera.

Despite the co-billing of the title, it is really Orphe that dominates as he has the lion's share of the arias in the work. Australian tenor David Hobson is something of a pop icon in his native country thanks to his performance as Rodolfo in Baz Luhrmann's colorful 1990 production of ""La Bohme"". Although he often sings meltingly and has the requisite good looks, he lends a too-callow and often wooden presence as the desperately grieving widower, and the depth of the character's despair appears to escape him. This vacuity extends to some of his arias which are sung in a rather monochromatic manner and shallow timbre unsuitable for such a dramatic piece. On the other hand, soprano Amanda Thane certainly lends vocal power to Eurydice, even though her impressive singing is mainly relegated to the third act. The challenge is that she and Hobson have very little chemistry as she often moves rather awkwardly onstage when she needs to come across as ethereal.

Fellow soprano Miriam Gormley has a smooth voice and lends a becalming though unrelenting presence in the small mythic role of Amore. She at least manages a fierceness of intent when she removes a knife from the suicidal Orphe, a dramatically urgent moment in a production with precious few of them. A major plus is the seamless melding of the Australian Opera Chorus and Meryl Tankard's dance troupe as the Furies, whether providing the mournful chorus to Orphe's grieving in the first act or writhing in erotically charged torment on a seemingly insurmountable wall in Hades in the ""Dance of the Furies"". The striking use of color is most effective in the depiction of the underworld, and the massive Plexiglas cube against a silvery landscape makes for a powerful image of the Elysian Fields.

Conductor Marco Guidarini does a solid job leading the opera orchestra, although the recording quality on the Kultur DVD can be rather lacking at times. Regardless of the creative staging, the area most lacking for me in this production is how the principals fail to pull off the combustible intensity necessary to make the overall dramatic situation palpable. As a point of comparison, I was fortunate enough to see Robert Carsen's stripped-down production of the original 1762 opera this past spring at the Chicago Lyric Opera with countertenor David Daniels and soprano Isabel Bayrakdarian in the title roles. Both are such charismatic performers that it mattered little that they were performing on what seemed to be a rocky moonscape. The intractable need the characters have for each other is what fails to convince in the Opera Australia production.",1159142400,21,3393,5.044563279857398
2534154,5,B000ETRA3M,It really is difficult to find ANY fault with this production AND - let us remember that we are watching something other than the production as seen by people in the opera house - with this television/DVD version. As good as it gets. I agree with everything the other commentators have written - especially with the obsevation that this disc is a splendid way to introduce people to opera!  Bravi to all concerned.,1153612800,9,414,4.671232876712328
2534155,5,B000ETRA3M,"If you think Orpheus in Gluck's opera ""Orphee et Eurydice"" as in Grecian tunic, crowned with a laurel wreath, posing melancholy with lyre in his hand - image usually seen on every other Orphee album cover... well, think NOT for this Australian Opera's 1993 production of Gluck's 1774 Paris version ""Orphee et Eurydice"". This production takes a creative path in transforming the Greek myth into modern era, while not diluting the classical baroque opera with its avant-garde novelties. Australian tenor David Hobson, shortly after his sensational portrayal of Rodolfo in ""La Boheme"", made another sensational performance as Orphee. Ambitiously, he sang Orphee in full score, and in the original key with modern pitch. Although lacking the vocal element of a haute-contre (the type of voice the tenor role of Orphee was originally written for), Hobson's vocal is well in tune with this modern production and the aura it created on stage.

Numerous moments in the opera would make one's hair stand on end: ""L'espoir renait dans mon amen"", a vocally demanding aria Gluck wrote just for tenor Orphee, which Hobson delivered with grace and fire despite of some flaws; ""Laissez-vous toucher par mes pleurs"", Orphee's heartbreaking plead to the Furies, where the emotion reached its peak by a thrilling high D; ""Dances of the Furies"", interpreted through a blood-stirring, edgy, modern dance of the furies; and of course, Orphee's last aria, ""J'ai perdu mon Eurydice"", which Hobson sang with ultimate desolation and desperation...

The production is cleverly designed, and well acted, particularly, Orphee, in which Hobson gives a rendering that is quite different from his famous role, Rodolfo. Character Orphee comes out directly through his singing, and as a result one may very well find oneself satisfied in just listening to the soundtrack. Miriam Gormley's L'Amour, dressed like a street boy, is superb. Whether in L'Amour's haunting vocals, or when acrobatically floating in and out on a swing, or in the little dance solo at the end of the Act III, she is a deft little spirit on stage. Marco Guidarini conducts the music with faster tempo that rightfully energizes the music. Under Guidarini's baton, `Dances of the Furies', with the perfect tempo and sharpness, is the best version I've ever heard.",1147737600,30,2301,5.182795698924731
2534156,5,B000ETRA3M,"This is an excellent performance of the less well known French version of Gluck's Orphee et Eurydice. The cast is excellent and it is amazing to hear a high tenor perform the role of Orphee as orignally written, instead of a contralto. The performance is not so much a modern update as a more naturalistic performance. The colour and movement of this production is both exciting and daring (trying hanging on to a swinging wall!!!) This is an excellent introduction to opera, as well as an essential disc is any collector's library.",1146268800,12,532,4.793478260869565
8114181,5,B000ETRA3M,"Amazing opera with beautiful orchestration.  One of the best I've heard. If you enjoyed The Magic Flute, you will love this, not for the deep story, but the beauty of e music and some of the best vocalists around.

Honestly, I can lose interest in a boring or poorly orchestrated opera quickly.  I like an opera to lift me out of reality for a few hours.  I enjoy pieces written in a key of major, which brings forth feelings of fulfillment and happiness, and when the composer hits you with a good dramatic piece in the key of minor, it makes you sit up, alert.

This opera is one for your ears and mind.  I really can't praise Gluck enough on this one.  Soo beautiful.",1416009600,,670,4.312
8114182,5,B000ETRA3M,"I have many recordings of David Hobson (CD, DVD, BluRay), and I'd rate Orpheus as his best. Young Miriam also does very well. As far as the production is concerned, that is superb, but I have to say it has to be seen as on par with the Festival of Peralada version with Anita Rashvelishvila (?) .",1399075200,,296,4.2105263157894735
8114183,5,B000ETRA3M,"This is a perfect edition in every way.  The subtitles are clear and move smoothly with the voices.
I highly recommend it.  Opera friends of mine were delighted with it also.",1382832000,,174,4.580645161290323
8114184,5,B000ETRA3M,anyone who doesn't appreciate David Hobson's talent is too jaded to give opinions.  He is so talented and gifted...I only wish he could do more things like orphee...no one could do it any better...I'm sure he has learned to use his gift even better since the 90's.  any one who loves opera will love this dvd.,1380931200,,309,4.5
8114185,4,B000ETRA3M,"David Hobson is outstanding.  The whole cast is good and the music is beautiful.  This production has a more modern setting, but it works as well as any other.",1376524800,,159,4.448275862068965
8114186,5,B000ETRA3M,"The performers are Australian, and David Hobson is a favourite, which makes this DVD special for me. It arrived about 3 weeks before your estimated date of June 6. It's a delight to watch, that is if you don't mind being taken to hell and back, and I thank you for the opportunity of buying it.",1306368000,,294,4.267857142857143
8114187,4,B000ETRA3M,"It took considerable courage for Australian Opera to mount the French version of Gluck's masterpiece. For one thing it isn't done all that often and although a lot of the music that Gluck wrote for this ""version"" has been co-opted for performances of the Italian vesion, it is rare to hear what Gluck rewrote for France. I am not a scholar so it is very interesting to read Max Loppert in Opera on Record I on the subject. He points out that no two sets of the recorded versions are alike .

There have only been three recordings of the French version: one from Soviet Russia: and two from France: Nicolai Gedda and Leopold Simomeau, the former on EMI and the latter Philips. Neither tenor attmpt the bravura aria that concludes the first act. Having said that Simoneau truly trumps the field as regards interpretation. First of the voice is extremely beautiful and his sense of the style unasailable. And of course the text is enuciated by Francophone singers, a rareity in these days.

The Australian production credits a French coach, Marie-Claire; and in truth David Hobson does make an attempt. However, the chorus is only occasionally successful. Neither the Amour or Eurydice are particularly successful but historically both these roles are not easy to pull off as recorded history proves. The problem lies in the composer himself. What is required is passion within the restraints of the classical style. Simoneau and Gedda have some success here, and in the Italisn versions, Marylin Horne and Shirley Verret have been successful in varying degrees. I am not familiar with other DVD's of the opera and on paper they look variable. To get at the heart of Passion within Restraint I would suggest listening to Callas' recording of J'ai perdu. She alone in modern recording has captured the essence by virture of enuciating the text and marrying it to the vocal line. Yes, her voice is in ruins, coming apart at the seams as it were, but hers is a triumph of artistry over diminishing vocal resources.

Obviously David Hobson cannot bring to the table what Callas did, but male singers have other virtues. What he has made is a valiant attempt and frequently he succeeds; the voice is not a beautiful one and his technique is only barely up to the difficult aria that ends the first act. That he has given some thought is obvvious, but in one crucial area the performance is scuppered by its unfamiliarity with the language. This is not to say one shouldn't bother owning it, since a newer recording (DVD, that is) is unlikely to pop up in the near future. I suspect there are not too many French operas in the rep of Australian Opera. That they chose this is admirable.

What is needed is a DVD of the Berlioz adaptation as well. Forlane issued a CD a number of years ago with Podlesh. Her French is surpringly good (as I recall) but it is too late for a DVD. The great mezzo, Rita Gorr should have been given the chance to record it complete, but she did record a highlights LP. Gluck is a tough nut to crack and if we don't have many true Verdi singers around it is even even more obvious that we don't have singers (especially from France) to master the necessities to pull off Gluck.",1246665600,3,3195,4.62962962962963
8114188,5,B000ETRA3M,"The DVD of this production, which I was privileged to have seen live in Melbourne, Australia, is truly beautiful. The quality of singing by a true high tenor, two excellent sopranos and an extraordinary chorus and ballet, was magical and inspiring. The production was brilliant. I will never get tired of watching and listening to this enchanting Gluck opera recording.",1233532800,,369,5.166666666666667
8114189,5,B000ETRA3M,"Orphee et Eurydice by Gluck is one of the lesser known operas.  However, David Hobson who sings the title role, has the most beautiful expressive tenor voice I have ever heard. He is on stage for most of the opera, and the story demands exceptionally gruelling singing and acting, which David does effortlessly.
To watch him express the deepest grief over the death of his beloved wife Eurydice, is an operatic triumph.  One can almost feel the pain his is experiencing in every breath.  His effortless, controlled phrasing has to be seen to be believed.  It is simply thrilling to watch him in the role of Orphee.
Opera Australia are known for their excellent attention to the highest standards in the staging of world class opera.  They may be 'down under', but they are 'on top' of my list, when it comes to presenting musical theatre.
Even if you are sceptical about watching opera, I urge you to give this DVD a try.  The music is beautiful in its self, but turn on the subtitles and be overwhelmed by the beauty of Gluck.",1232496000,5,1027,4.584699453551913
8114190,5,B000ETRA3M,"One of my favourites from our Sydney opera. Though not usually sung by a tenor, I like David Hobson's version as well as the rather unusual choreography. The music is lovely, Mozart admired it and learned a lot from it. Miriam Gormley also does a very good job (I believe her sister is with the New York opera) and while Amanda Thane has a lovely voice,perharps she may be a little too cuddly for some.",1202947200,,402,4.373333333333333
