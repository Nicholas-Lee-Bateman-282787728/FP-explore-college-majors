8494216,5,B0000D0YTO,"All of these episodes hold a bit of tragedy in them, showing us Carmen's depressing past.  But the ways in which they do this is illuminating!

The so-so episodes are about Malcom Avalon, who is a millionaire, but he may be Carmen's father!  The end of this two-parter is tragic yes, but it ends as in a bad soap opera.

The next theme is Carmen having a trip down Memory Lane, and this is the best episode dealing with a ""The Wizard of Oz"" theme.  We discover many amazing things in this episode.

The Bonus Episode, Follow My Footprints doesn't relate to Carmen's past, but she ""mysteriously"" dies while commiting a crime, so Zack & Ivy have to stop VILE from continuing with a new leader.  This shows how much Carmen means to everyone.

Overall, I would watch the single episodes first and then the two-parter as to not destroy your taste in Carmen Sandiego for good.",1134864000,7,870,4.496815286624204
