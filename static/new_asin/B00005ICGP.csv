7938496,4,B00005ICGP,"The skating and music are simply awesome.  The focus is mainly on street with a little bit of vert in the montage sections.  Excellent performances throughout, but Daewon Song and Diego Bucchieri really stand out.  Daewon demonstrates his ability to skate roof-gaps and picnic tables in ""weird configurations.""  Diego shows a lot of speed and guts when it comes to stairs and ledges.  The encounters with authority figures are equally entertaining and disturbing.  An extra special montage of injuries is included for your horrific pleasure.
There are no extras or bonus material, not even a menu.  You just load the DVD and it plays from start to finish without chapter breaks; kinda annoying if you want to get to a particular section right away.  At least it's not like VHS, where repeated playback will cause diminished video quality, and you'll probably be playing this one a lot!  The audio dynamics are a bit muffled.  This problem can be compensated (somewhat) by turning up the treble.
Overall, a very magical and hypnotic viewing experience that will leave you reminiscing about those crazy summer days of yore.  I highly recommend.",1024358400,3,1142,5.0212765957446805

7938498,4,B00005ICGP,"I would have given this video five stars, but this is a horrible dvd. Skating is top notch in this video, but the picture quality is just the same as vhs, which is lame. Plus, you can't even skip to people's parts. There is no bonus footage, no menu, nothing special. This is a great skate flick with great music from people like Built to Spill, The Sea and Cake, and Mr. Dibbs and is definitely worth viewing, but don't get it expecting a lot from it since it is a dvd like I did. Redline Action Sports who put this video on dvd obviously just wanted to cash in on skateboarding's current popularity and didn't really wan't to make a high quality dvd for skateboarders to enjoy.",992995200,12,679,4.3125
