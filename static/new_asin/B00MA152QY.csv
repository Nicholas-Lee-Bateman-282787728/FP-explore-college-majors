6565476,5,B00MA152QY,GREAT DVD!!! EVERYONE SHOULD OWN IT!!!  REST IN PEACE JOHNNY THUNDERS...YOU ARE MISSED,1414454400,,86,5.615384615384615
6565477,3,B00MA152QY,"Good documentary, but they had Spanish subtitles that were very distracting, and made me rather dislike this film.  For instance, when Sylvain Sylvain was talking about the topic, and his name was written across the bottom of the picture, there were Spanish subtitles covering the name.  I mention Sylvain, because I KNOW who he is, but many of the more obscure people who were commenting were impossible to identify, because of the subtitles.  Since I don't know who they were, I could not get the full picture, if that makes any sense.  The subtitle kerfuffle really ruined this for me.  I generally watch documentaries several times to be sure I didn't miss anything, but this one.....well forget it.  Too aggravating.
Content was pretty good though...Thinking it thru more, I am still glad I saw this, so I guess it must not have been THAT bad...still got enough info to be worth it",1414195200,3,886,4.796052631578948
6565478,1,B00MA152QY,"Perhaps it's the perfect film for Johnny Thunders, because like the man himself this is a mess.  Way way WAY tooooo long.  It's sort of like the the filmmakers threw in every piece of footage they got in no comprehensible order.  It's just so badly edited that after a while you just stop caring.

6565480,5,B00MA152QY,"I picked this up for my wife she is a fan of Johnny thunders...  This is what she wrote about the DVD and movie...

Hello all...
I wanted to share my views on ""Looking for johnny"" DVD
I watched it last night.. I must say
what a breath of fresh air ... to see such true and very positive story on this man and well deserved at that..being of what others have wrote and told about Johnny this is a true credit of a film and the people involved should be very proud of doing such a great job in giving Johnny`s fans a real story of him .. you did an awesome job!!
As a fan of Johnny`s but myself being way too young when he was performing and not really knowing what he had done even ""before"" The Dolls It was really great feeling and a treat to find out he had done so much more..
and YES I feel he was way more of a great guitar player then what he gave out to his public...being in his later state of mind he had such a great heart and was a passionate person This to me was great to learn as well...and it all comes down to one thing..He was a human being and had feelings just like we do .. I am proud to own this DVD and watch it with pride not like the others I have seen.. This one is THE BEST.. Thank you Phyllis and all who have put their heart and soul into letting us learn the better side of Johnny..
And the bonus section is awesome as well...
Stevie`s song ""Looking for Johnny"" is awesome .. Kudos to you !!
God bless..",1413936000,22,1431,3.9140893470790377

6565493,4,B00MA152QY,"I've been a Johnny Thunder's fan for a long time (I named my cat after him,)  but Johnny Thunder's life is a cautionary tale of how drugs can damage a truly talented entertainer.  This documentary explores the bad --- drug abuse, wife-beating, and double crossing his friends --- and the good ---- his under rated song writing abilities, unique guitar playing and his sense of humor.  Until  I saw this documentary, it had been a while since I had played his music, however, I was reminded how much he influenced the punk movement and future guitar players, like Greg Ginn of Black Flag --- Johnny Thunders speeded up.  I was also amazed of all the video and film footage there is of Johnny Thunders and they are put to go use here.  The interviews were excellent, especially Sylvain Sylvain, Walter Lure, and Richard Lloyd, and they were essential in the telling of Johnny Thunder's life.  As with most documentaries there seem to be individuals missing, for one reason or the other, that could have made this documentary even better, and in this case those individuals were David Johansen, and Richard Hell.  Overall this is a good account of the
tragic life of Johnny Thunders.  He was a true rock and roll believer and that's how his legacy be remembered.",1433030400,,1259,4.712328767123288

6565502,3,B00MA152QY,"I got more excited for this than I probably should have.  I'm certainly no Nina Antonia, but I've read / watched / heard pretty much everything that's out there about JT / Dolls, and this really brought nothing new to the story.  Like most JT fanatics, I could recognize most of the source material for the bulk of the non-interview clips.

That being said: the filmmaker(s) were very shrewd to get Jungle Records involved, and as a result the film an excellent, period-consistent soundtrack throughout.  They also did a good job of tracking down important players in  JT history, including some people I was excited to get perspective from (Barry Jones, Alison Gordy, and especially Lee Black Childers).  Even better, the interviews were for the most part well-lit, well-placed, and sounded good - which was refreshing after watching a cascade of awful-looking rock docs like ""American Hardcore"" where (among other inexcusable technical gaffes), HR is interviewed in a park next to the 5 freeway and a water fountain.  If you're going to take on the challenge of documenting something important, at least have enough respect for the topic (and your talent as a filmmaker) to make it look & sound as good as it deserves to.

Also to the filmmaker(s) credit, they made excellent use of stills - there didn't seem to be any repeats, and they didn't over-animate them or throw a bunch of cheap, basic effects all over them in an attempt to cover up for otherwise shoddy filmmaking.  There was also an excellent re-cut of clips from ""Mona et Moi"" that created the perfect montage to illustrate the hazy, ad hoc hustle of JT's early 80s career.  But ultimately, the filmmaker(s) go back to the ""Mona et Moi"" well too many times, using them to cover big stretches of content where a photo or even an interview would've worked fine.  Case in point: a shot of Walter picking up a pay phone that's L cut over his interview about being pressed back into service for the brief tour that led to the Heartbreakers ""Live at the Lyceum"" material stands out as being too cute, as well as an example of the filmmaker(s) trying too hard to employ a ""say dog - see dog"" style.  That's a tough approach for a documentary where going into it the makers had to know there was going to be a limited amount of material, including some essential (and fairly well-known) items and interviews that were sorely missing.

And that's really my biggest disappointment about ""Looking For Johnny"" - that there are so many glaring omissions of things that you really need in there to present a full picture of who Johnny Thunders was and why he's important to musical history.  I'm sure there were plenty of people who said no to interviews (Christopher Gierke?) or to licensing footage (Lech Kowalski?), but knowing those people and things are out there makes me miss their inclusion and perspective even more.

Finally (and this is kind of nit-picky) I've got some issue with the film's title, which implies we're going on a journey to discover what Johnny Thunders was all about, and what makes him such a fascinating and vital part of music history nearly 25 years after his death.  Instead we get a fairly basic bio and some surface observations about how he ""just wanted to be loved.""  Sadly, perhaps the most earnest insights in the film come from Bob Gruen and Syl Sylvain, who clearly enjoyed Johnny's work and friendship, but who ultimately saw him as a junkie who got what was very predictably his due.  If the film's goal was to present JT as a tragic figure stuck on a rock & roll kamikaze mission, they needed to state that goal and their conclusion more clearly.

All in all, this film didn't live up to my (admittedly high) expectations, but its certainly something I'm glad to have on my shelf.  Most importantly, it led to the FANTASTIC soundtrack, which does a great job of compiling high-quality versions of various JT classics into a single well-curated and carefully sequenced package.  If only the film was as essential as the soundtrack...",1424476800,,4029,4.743553008595988
6565503,5,B00MA152QY,"I am a long time fan of JT. I had LAMF tattooed on my arm when he died. I came across this on amazon and was surprised as I had never heard of it. That is because it is new. It was made by the same guy who did The Rise and Fall of the Clash documentary which is also well done.

Johnny had his demons everyone knows that but he was also a brilliant songwriter and that is what this movie tries to make clear. I really enjoyed all the old footage and interviews. It is sad that so many of his fellow musicians from those days are also gone...Walter Lure, Billy Rath, Stiv Bators, Dee Dee, Killer Kane...so many greats from the punk era are gone but they would be proud that their music lives on.

It would have been cool if a few more of those who are still alive would have put their egos away and said a few words for this film. It was great to see and hear Slyvain but nothing from Johanson or Richard Hell. Neither were among Johnny's biggest fans but it would be nice to hear at least their side as they were,a large art of his life and career.

We can't put our arms around him but we can still listen to his music.",1423958400,3,1120,3.9910714285714284

I will check this out again after I purchase a few albums I overlooked, like ""Hurt Me"".

I was there for the Dolls and Heartbreakers and Johnny was all that and more.  An original, he generated a pretty large body of work, great songs, for someone who was supposed to be high all the time.  In fact, I could live without all the drug references, but much better here than in a previously attempted documentary.  No annoying Bonos or young musicians saying what a hero JT was to them, just contemporaries telling us what they know.  The director did not put too much music footage in because he felt there was enough of that out there already.  I want an extra of everything Sylvain Sylvain said.",1415577600,,764,4.453237410071942
6565528,4,B00MA152QY,"Screened this tonight, plus most of the extras.  I didn't think the film was too long,
if anything it was all too brief!!  And sadly, although I'm sure due to a scarcity of footage,
one wishes for more interview time with Johnny himself, on his own.  However, the film
we do get is a pretty bracing, well-rounded, highly entertaining and informative history
of Thunders and his life and career(s), issues and all, and generally the commentators
are all cogent and well worth paying attention to.  In one sense, despite all his flaws
and problems, Johnny's interview statement at one point that his shows ""hopefully provide
these people/kids (etc.) 2 hrs. or so to come and enjoy themselves and forget
about their troubles, and that's all that really matters to me.""  Not that that comment
was any surprise, but emotionally, it just floored me.  Personally, I was always
into the sex and rock and roll parts of the trilogy, but never, ever into the drugs.  So, to me, this
comment of Johnny's is what it ALWAYS was about, and always should be about.
Then again, I wasn't around for the scene in the 70s and barely for the 80s, as a kid, etc.
In a way I'm glad cause I get to enjoy the music and such later (and nowadays) and had
I been around for the early scenes, somehow I doubt I'd even be alive right now. By the time
I got to the Ritz in the late 80s NYC had already long started mutating well away from the
truly dangerous and grotty 1970s-1981 version.

I was pretty heavy into the new wave punk goth etc. dance club and concert scene in the late 80s to
1990s and for me it was about going out and having a few drinks and getting your
dance on and shaking it up and indeed, ALL ABOUT THE MUSIC and losing oneself
in it, forgetting about your problems for a few hours
with friends, etc.  Or seeing a great show. I utterly missed Maxs, barely caught late CBGBs,
and never even got to go to the Peppermint Lounge, alas.  I never saw why one would need drugs to enjoy
any of that.  Of course, alcohol is a drug let's not forget.  But I gave that up for Jewish
Lent a long long time ago.  But I can't comment on Johnny's issues and have no intention
of doing so.  I've been a major fan of the Dolls, Johnny's solo works, the Heartbreakers, his collaborations,
and Walter Lure's The Waldos, for at least 20 years and that's where I'm coming from.
Good to see Lee Black Childers, Alan Vega and Marty Thau commenting although sadly two
of them are no longer with us by this year.  Alan been there done that even before the Dolls,
so he of all people is the most eminently qualified to tell us how it allll began.  And how it all
went wrong (or, right), as Captain Beefheart might have sang.  When I saw the Waldos
once at CBs in the mid 1990s or so I felt I got at least the barest glimpse of what seeing
the Heartbreakers might have been like.  And that was good enough for me since I recall
it being a bracing, sweaty, energetic show.

Sadly, of course, a lot of people are no longer with us who might've commented further, and I don't know about Johnny's
family, but I imagine they are reticent to go on camera for all sorts of reasons,
and if so, I certainly would never blame them.  Great to see Howie Pyro (in the deleted scenes section)
tell his hilarious ""punch up with Thunders over the Mod watch"" story which is one I'd never heard before,
even having met Howie many times when he was still based in NYC.  I was far too young to have gotten into the Dolls or
the Heartbreakers or any of that music until at least the late 80s and early 1990s, chiefly
through friends and going to parties in NYC like the ones that Howie in fact used to DJ,
The GreenDoorNYC, Jesse Malin, and Co. and clubs like Coney Island High
and Don Hills.

Otherwise I might have remained not so blissfully ignorant.  Lenny Kaye and Bob Gruen, as always, provide essential
and thoughtful and in most cases, first-person reportage and stories of how the
scene was and what Johnny Thunders, the Dolls, the Mercer Arts Center scene, etc.,
was really like.  I really do pine still for more info. on his family and early life growing up in Queens, I myself having
been born in Queens and having lived there for many years early on as a young
tyke, and also much later on.  Live From Jamaica Avenue!  We've all heard all those tales
of Johnny walking around Jackson Heights with his empty guitar case or whatnot, but
I would love to hear many more of those and others. I'm sure Andy Shernoff
must have many more of those to tell, himself. I had no idea Johnny was almost a
young baseball farm and/or little league or high school ""pick"" which was pretty insane to hear.

In any case, though there is clearly more of the man to search for,
I thoroughly enjoyed Looking For Johnny and if anyone needs ancillary
documentation there's clearly plenty available online and YouTube, etc., as with
the New York Dolls as well.  And now we're all looking for Patti Palladin cause
she's not in this film!  That could be another film entirely.... ""well she's good/bad
but she ain't evil!""  But where is she....Patti, come back to us!",1415404800,11,5093,4.3872340425531915

It tells the truth about Johnny Thunders, who was a charismatic entertainer, but a destructive junkie who hurt a lot of people. He beat his wife and cheated his closest musical partners for drug money. The film gives him credit where deserved without being obsequious. I won't give it away here, but the film reveals the traumatic childhood event that probably predisposed him to become a junkie. The film quotes Bob Dylan as saying he wished he'd written Thunders' song ""You Can't Put Your Arms Around a Memory."" I couldn't find a published source for this on the internet, but perhaps some fact checker will prove it is more than just urban legend.",1414627200,2,782,4.673913043478261

As a side note, check out the footage on Gruen's DVD-""Chatterbox"" form Club 82 will blow you away and also ""Lookin for a kiss""-you can't take your eyes off the guy.

8671037,1,B00MA152QY,"There's nothing in this film that was new, and I had really, REALLY hoped for a film that finally introduced us to Johnny, the MUSICIAN, the way ""It Might Get Loud"" showed us Edge and Jack White. As an artist Johnny Thunders deserves that. Johnny may have behaved in a way that turned some people off, but there was genius in him, and we have to acknowledge that. There are reasons to dislike Dali, Celine, and Chet Baker also, but we still respect them as artists, admire Dali's paintings, read Celine's novels, listen to Baker's trumpet. To this day the way I personally play guitar is still affected by Johnny's playing, and there are scores of others who can say the same. Someone needs to make a film about THAT! After all, it IS the reason we ought to be paying any attention to JT in the first place. He was the Mick Taylor of the punk generation...so soulful and expressive. But we hardly hear his guitar in the film at all. Like Lech Kowalski already did with ""Born To Lose"" what we got instead was another ""Johnny The Junkie"" movie, a story we've all heard before a million times.

I saw the premier of Looking For Johnny at The Anthology in New York. There was a LOT of preaching to the converted; half of the people on the screen were in the audience. Some of us don't think JT deserves to have a film made about him, some do.  My point is that if one DOES choose to make a film about him, make it about the guitar player...tell us why so many have tried to copy his sound! Hell, tell us what his sound IS!! As I've said, if you didn't know walking into the film what JT sounded like, you still did not know at the end of the film. A bass player friend of mine brought his girlfriend to the film. She's in her twenties and she did not know Johnny's music. And at the end of the movie she asked, ""well, what did he actually sound like""? In my eyes that's where the film fails. There are no real clips of his guitar playing. He's referred to as the ""Chuck Berry of his generation"", but we never actually HEAR it in the film! His great songwriting is mentioned, but we don't actually hear ANY complete songs, not even the fabled ""Can't Put Your Arms Around A Memory""! If there IS to be a Johnny Thunders documentary, it ought to be about THAT. Just as with Keith Richards, the heroin is BESIDES the point.  The tragedy of Johnny's life to me is that he's still known more as a notorious junkie than for his guitar sound. I was hoping that this film would finally be the one to change that, but alas, it is not. Chet Baker was just as bad a junkie as John, and he also died at a hotel under questionable circumstances. But today he's known mostly for his contributions to jazz, the west coast sound and so on. And although the film about him, ""Let's Get Lost"", and more recently Born to Be Blue clues us in as to his troubles, it doesn't forget to show us the musician.

Also, Johnny's greatest achievement was probably his first solo album ""So Alone"" which was produced by the great Steve Lillywhite, who went on to work with the likes of U2, Peter Gabriel, et al. The album also featured guest appearances by Phil Lynott, Steve Jones, Paul Cook, Peter Perrett and Steve Marriot, legends all, yet the album was barely mentioned in the film...and with all of the talking heads that we see onscreen one after another, why on earth wasn't Steve Lillywhite interviewed? Surely input from him would have been truly interesting.

The point of a documentary is to enlighten people who DON'T know about the subject. The only way that one could possibly know what Johnny Thunders, THE MUSICIAN, sounded like after seeing ""Looking For Johnny"" would be if one already knew BEFORE seeing the film.",1524441600,2,3694,4.394736842105263

8671039,5,B00MA152QY,"Those were the days! My band and the Heartbreakers were booked at Max's simultaneously, just by coincidence, quite a few times. Johnny always seemed very quiet to me, very shy, but he had this killer look about him. I could just stare at him endlessly, whether he was playing guitar or just hanging around upstairs in the dressing rooms at Max's, just because he had such charisma. He had that intangible...thing...that all real stars have. But you could also see this scared little kid inside, telling himself that he wasn't worthy, that he was a loser. It was such a stark contrast--the strength and the fragility at the same time. He was an incredibly gentle, talented, lovely man--only he didn't see it. In this film, you see him smile exactly twice. That's it. And that's how he was. Tortured, I think. Hence, the drugs and alcohol. It was great seeing this movie though, with all these people I knew, long, long ago. Many are dead now. But not Johnny. He lives on in all of us who knew him or in any of those who ever heard his music.  I hope you're enjoying your journey now, Johnny, wherever you are. :)",1520726400,,1111,4.527363184079602
8671040,4,B00MA152QY,"This was a great documentary that laid out the musical career and drug use of Johnny Thunders brilliantly.  The thing missing for me was more of the personal details about his upbringing and who he was as a human being - I would have liked more on what he was like, what motivated him.  Why was he such a junkie?  What was going on in his head?  I felt like this documentary left me thinking he was just a shallow drug user with no introspection.  Lizard brain?  Didn't he have any deep conversations with his friends, girlfriends?  Had to be more depth to a person who could write such brilliant songs/lyrics and play guitar.  Or, maybe not?",1519948800,,642,4.427350427350428

8671043,5,B00MA152QY,"Let face it, if the 2 New York Dolls studio LPs were the only recordings Johnny Thunders were involved with, he would still be legendary today. I was a stupid kid in those days, I had heard them, but wasn't impressed.

Jumping ahead to when the 1977 Punk Rock era was in full vortex (in other words, Never Mind The Bollocks had opened up my ears and made me curious), I ran across The Heartbreakers L.A.M.F. in it's original LP on Track Records. I lived in a small town without much access to culture, so although I didn't know who they were, I knew I might never see this record again. I didn't learn until later that most people couldn't get past the mix/production (or lack thereof), but I LOVED it. Being a a huge Rolling Stones fanatic, I felt the muddy production had the same effect as Exile On Main St.; it added to the mystique and sounded DURTY. Plus there was a GREAT straight-up ROCK and ROLL album in that murk, that in fact grew more prominent with every listen. Almost every song had a girl at it's core, and most of them clocked in at under the 3 minute range.

It was punk, but it was also classic rock and roll in the truest sense, albeit as delivered through the musicianship of a group of street-tough gentlemen of seasoned tastes and habits.

Then came Johnny's ""So Alone"" LP, and for me, the rest is a blur. The mileage I got from the investment of those 2 records is still providing me with enjoyment to this day. I almost do not have to listen to them, as they have been played so often I can hear them in my head (still better to plunk the needle down on the vinyl though; man these are powerful records). I sought out the Dolls' LPs after that and realized that as much as I loved the Sex Pistols LP (still do), their guitarist Steve Jones took the Johnny Thunders blueprint and ran with it.

I was fortunate enough to see Mr. Thunders on a pretty good night playing his heart out live, and never missed a chance to read about him in the fanzines/books issued before/after he sadly passed on, but there were huge gaps in knowledge about his history that I was unaware of before this excellent documentary was made available.

However you've come to this page in the Amazon Movie section, if you have any interest in the man at all, I highly recommend you see this studied collection of facts and reflections on Johnny Thunders. Like most artists, he had many sides, many of which the public persona did not reflect. There is a lot of ground covered here in a short time, but if it was a 5 hour documentary it would have been too short.

As Mr. Genzale/Volume/Thunders himself once summed up in song, ""I can count on diamonds, rubies as well, oh big deal baby, I still feel like hell"". We may never get enough of Johnny, but this is a good look into what made him so well loved by those who couldn't.",1503187200,2,2825,4.330812854442344
