938099,5,630492643X,"I must admit that the only reason I picked this book up was the film. I  saw ""Oscar and Lucinda"" and even before my eyes were dry, I was  in my car driving to the nearest bookstore. Imagine my delight when I  discovered the book to be even enjoyable. From the first few paragraphs,  the characters become important to the reader, both on intelluctual and  emotional levels. You experience Oscar's alienation from his father, his  struggle to find his true path, his guiless approach to life, his sweet  smile. And speaking as a woman, Lucinda's fight to be recognized as a  individual still rings true today. While the prose is very visual,  everything our characters see, feel and hear is explained in painstaking  detail, dialogue does not play second fiddle. Through his words, we are  privy to their thoughts, as if we are eaves dropping on private  conversations, never meant to be shared. Mr. Carey gives his people real  dreams, real ideas, real souls. And it is the clarity of his prose, the  purity of his characters that surround you as you read. Oscar and Lucinda  did, and do, exist. Mr. Carey weaves these two in an out, picking out  poinient moments in their lives, allowing us to travel down that slippery  slope of obsessive/complusive gambling with them, until he brings them  together on the boat to Australia and their first fateful cardgame.
Despite the book's rather depressing conclusion, this is what romance  novels should be. Not to say that ""Oscar and Lucinda"" can by  catagorized as a simple romance. It is much more. I guess you could say  that this book is a religious treatise, a travelogue, a history lesson, a  psychological study, and most definately, a love story all contained within  the same pages.  If you have begun to doubt that the human spirit can  triumph, that true love can be obtained, read ""Oscar and Lucinda""  and all your doubts will be laid to rest.

938181,3,630492643X,"Despite outstanding performances of leading characters Cate Blanchett, as eccentric heiress and businesswoman, and Ralph Fiennes as gambling priest and crusaders of a moral mission this movie misfires on a number of levels. Although this pair of misfits who meet by chance over a game of cards are enchanting and present as the prefect match they are too chaotic and nave to capitalise on their chance meeting. Instead they are doomed because of their obsession to gamble on cards, idealistic ventures and other fruitless wagers. This quirky Art-house piece failed to capitalise on its potential largely because it is overlong before closing with a blunt, dissatisfying and implausible ending. Other distractions such as Geoffrey Rush's narration only add to the list of draw backs that ensures that this film never really takes off. Highlights like the Historic Australian settings, sweeping landscapes and this part costume drama never really make up for the reality that this original and adventurous film is little more than a long yawn.",1474675200,,1041,5.27710843373494

Two eccentrics, one the rich owner of a glass-works (Cate Blanchette),and one an emotionally damaged and physically fragile young minister (Ralph Fiennes) are united in friendship, and eventually romance by their obsession with gambling.

Blanchette is luminous and wonderful. Fiennes pushes at times, going right up to the edge and occasionally over it with his tics and quirks, but he's ultimately very deeply effecting.

938285,4,630492643X,"Oscar and Lucinda is remarkable for early career performances by Ralph Fiennes and Cate Blanchett and lovely cinematography. The story, not so much. Based on a novel by Peter Carey, Oscar and Lucinda is the far-fetched tale of two compulsive gamblers, an ambitious Aussie woman who becomes a glass manufacturer and the repressed son of an austere fundamentalist minister in Britain. The two oddballs meet cute and spark over their gambling ways. Ultimately, they make a big wager that leads to a cross-country road trip from hell in which Oscar is determined both to win the bet and expiate his guilt over his sinful habit. The ending seemed over the top to me with heavy-handed symbolism and a quirky sense of both irony and wistfulness that kind of reflected the unevenness of the film.

I first saw Oscar and Lucinda in 1997 and will never forget walking out of the theater with a friend and saying Who WAS that woman?! With those gorgeous cheek bones and a smile that lit up the screen (it doesnt hurt that Lucindas character is a total charmer), it was pretty clear that Cate Blanchett was going to be a big movie star. Director Gillian Armstrong used the same cinematographer she did in her beautifully realized 1994 version of Little Women, Geoffrey Simpson.

938376,4,630492643X,"Anyone who has read Peter Carey's Oscar and Lucinda will know it's a fairly impossible task to film it. Gillian Armstrong took up the challenge, and the resulting film is a handsome, atmospheric attempt but overall doesn't work unless you have knowledge of the book to flesh out the characters and motivations. The production design is gorgeous - the recreations of an ascetic community in Cornwall and then the burgeoning colony of Victorian Australia are stunning, and the costuming is masterful. Better yet, the casting: Ralph Fiennes is a fantastic Oscar and Cate Blanchet (a new comer when she made this) is a breathy force of nature, just as Lucinda should be. Armstrong's films all hinge on the human inside the characters, often being held back by the environment they inhabit, so she is a natural fit for Carey's book. She understands Oscar and Lucinda and their human frailties and aspirations. The film, however, can't capture all of the nooks and crannies and observations of the novel, but it's hard to imagine any film maker could have managed that; this film is an earnest, loving attempt.",1374278400,,1104,4.940860215053763

SYNOPSIS--
In the mid-19th Century, an Anglican minister with a gambling addiction (Fiennes) emigrates from Britain to Australia. He meets fellow gambler Lucinda (Blanchett) on the boat. This liberated woman owns a glass factory in Sydney, and it's her dream to build a crystal cathedral, a pre-fab church made almost entirely of glass.

Lucinda wagers her inheritance that Oscar can't safely transport the church across the vast Aussie outback. He sets off with a number of crates on a memorable adventure that ends tragically, yet with a legacy.

938497,5,630492643X,"If you are a fan of Ralph Fiennes and have not seen this movie then you haven't seen what he can really do.  His characterization of the frail, nervous, minister's son, is one of the finest performances on film, and the one that made me a lifelong fan.  He never steps out of character, and it is amazing even seeing this a second time, how he perfected the spastic, hand movements, and the general ""twitchiness"" of the character, that implies some kind of neurological defect but never mentions it.  In spite of this, Oscar is a visionary, internally courageous, with dreams and ambitions, who sets out to realize his ambitions, in spite of his physical flaws.  Cate Blanchett is the perfect foil as a gutsy heiress determined to achieve something in life, and the two of them form a complete whole together.  While both are superlative, this is Fiennes' picture, probably his very best performance on film.  He has more ""acting"" to do here, and he wins over his audience early on, surviving his harsh upbringing, to find his way as a minister in a different religion than his father's.  You will be distracted by the magnificent cinematography and the leisurely, sybaritic pace of the film, but if you keep focusing on just what Fiennes is doing and how amazingly well he does it, you will shake your head in disbelief that his characterization is so perfect and so well delineated.  His performance elevates him into that exclusive pantheon of all-time greats where Olivier and Depardieu reside.  Long after you have forgotten about the plot, the abuse and the violence, you will remember that this was his finest work.",1264982400,5,1622,4.78494623655914

In my opinion his performance was better than Blanchett's though she was good also. The story is kind of deep with lots of different angles, the religious angle is both mystical and traditional/conventional.  Story takes place in the late 1800s in Australia, New South Wales - not surprisingly, the scenery is lush and beautiful.  But beyond scenery, there are some real sublime moments in the human drama as well.  Fiennes character is deeply religious and bases his communication with God almost on I Ching style divination tactics.  That is, heads or tails will help him determine what he beleives God wants him to do.

To come up with money to meet the basic necessities of living, he takes to betting on horse racing after a friend introduces him to the pastime.  He keeps what he needs and gives the rest to the poor.  His faith seems to keep him winning.  It starts to become a real issue for him though when he realizes he is no longer using the gambling simply as a means to an end, but that in fact he is enjoying the thrill of it as well.  There is a hilarious scene where, somehow by mistake Blanchett's character has come to him for confession and when she confesses that she loves to gamble, Fiennes character comes to the conclusion that gambling cannot really be a sin since to beleive in God already is the greatest gamble - those who beleive weigh the odds and are finally betting that He does exist.  Since this belief itself is the ultimate wager - how could God fault a person for wagers much smaller and of much less importance - dice or cards for example?

""Where is the sin? We bet. It is all in Pascal. We bet that there is a God.  We bet our lives on it. We calculate the odds and the return.. Our anxiety about our bet wakes us before dawn in a cold sweat.  And God sees us suffer.  I cannot beleive that such a God, whose fundamental requirement of us is that we gamble our souls - it's true, we stake everything on the fact of His existence -- I cannot beleive that such a God can look unkindly on a chap wagering a few quid on the likelihood of a dumb animal crossing the line first..... unless... unless it might be considered a blasphemy to apply to common pleasure that which is divine.""

Oscar is not without his personal demons, mostly in the form of ideals that he is constantly trying to live up to.  The ending of the movie was something of a shock, loaded with symbolic possibilities and plain poetry, in a word (see 'a glass church').

I saw an Australian version of this DVD.  The cover shows Oscar holding a 5 of diamonds, not a 5 of hearts.  I think I prefer the 5 of diamonds and the clear-eyed expression of the actors rather than the 'romantic' look of the Stateside version.  The movie is more than a romance - although it is a love story as tragic as any by Shakespeare.  This movie is not a high speed ride, but it is watchable all the same.",1242604800,3,3012,4.348837209302325

938502,4,630492643X,"What started as a religious tale rapidly disintegrated into sin of commission.  Filmed in the English countryside where the weather is infinitely damp and dreary.  Oscar Hopkins grows up into a tainted Anglican priest who met his fate on a floating church.  The rivers there are so narrow a healthy boy could jump from one bank to another.

Grown and in higher education, he became involved in gambling as an off-shoot of his wild influencial friends who enjoyed corrupting him, like Justin.  He became a pathological gambler.  Some of the tale was hard to understand as those Australians talk funnier than the British.  Cate Blanchett, an American, portrayed the grown Lucinda as an innocent manueverer who met Oscar on the boat and confessed to him as a priest, about her fascination to play dice and cards.  He understood her fascination as he too bet on the horses, like Mark.  Her love, another priest, does not believe in the virgin birth, nor do I.  It takes a man not a spirit.  He married someone else.

Lucinda's orange cat matched her hair color -- and Oscar's.  Fate and gambling brought them together in an uncouth and wild gambling hall.  Oscar was as mannerly and cautious as Mark.  ""She is my guest, Mrs. Journey.""  He even laughs like Mark.  ""You may leave the way you came.""  She follows after him and unashamedly pursues him with no let=up, even as he prays in church.  ""I gambled for a purpose -- there was no sin.  We have a history.""  She is heartless but playful, good for him as they laugh together.

He is fascinated and envisions a church made of glass.  ""I shall be here until the end; I have much to do.""  He is an extraordinary chap.  Back-biting by unscrupulous managers left him with Mark's tossled hair.  The floating church was a glory to behold.  And it ended up as a submerged tomb.",1222300800,2,1817,4.614420062695925

The technique of using a narrator does not always work but is it is most apt, and in particular at the end. One leaves after watching this film much as one does after a gourmet meal...extremely satisfied with what you have consumed but not wishing to eat another morsel and yet this continues over time so that you do not feel the need to return.

I was transfixed throughout by the ""action"" within the film. There is certainly much to think about or to delve into afterwards to get the entire picture. The story seems to be without any obvious flaws and the casting is superb with the main players clearly complemetary to each other and the cinematography is superb.

One thing that I had not paid too much attention to during my first viewing was the appalling and barbaric treatment of the indigenous population. Clearly the scene of the massacre is a solitary tale of man's inhumanity to man but the subsequent scene of the abuse of the aboriginal woman in the inn is a more subtle but nevertheless graphic reminder of the way in which settlers have behaved throughout the world. This point carries with it greater poignancy given the recent apology without compensation by the new Australian Prime Minister to the indigenous people for past abuses such as described above.

Part of the pleasure comes from the gorgeous actors (Cate Slanchett is a stunning brunette in this movie), costumes and scenery; the other part from the narrator's soothing voice, which takes the onus off the watcher and lays out details that a less gentle movie would make the watcher work for by inference.  Perhaps others may dislike the narration (akin to the children's movie ""Babe"" in its fairytale cadence);  I found that it brilliantly fleshed out the characters of Oscar and Lucinda so that by the time they meet, you know they are perfect for each other.  If you are familiar with Ralph Fiennes hunky ""English Patient"" character, you should be prepared that Oscar is quite whimpy in comparison; but I though it spoke to the actor's range that he was willing to play effeminate, physically weak and slightly creepy Oscar.

But something has happened to render the 'world' of the film oppressively neurotic and irrelevant. Do we live in a post-Christian world? If so, this may account for the desperate strangeness of the men of the cloth, who seem tortured and twisted and sick. They are either socially oppressive, trivial hypocrites, or tormented, lost souls, paralyzed by guilt and doubt or both. They all remind me of Flannery O'Connor's world of distorted freaks. The acting is superb, of course, but the tale is a total letdown, not so much depressing as just anti-climatic. It has none of the magnificence of ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God"", which it reminded me of. One problem is the character played to perfection by Ralph Fiennes. It is more than irritating is see a man play a worm. It is in the end painful to watch this man rubbing his hands together and crawling around on the ground. Call it what you will, this is not the kind of character one can relate to. Men and women in real life may want to care for him, but the audience loses interest.",1184976000,4,1149,4.450236966824645

If I was asked to give you a plot synopsis of this gorgeous film I would be hard pressed to say that OSCAR AND LUCINDA is about  anything for sure. This is positively the singlemost butchered screenplay I have ever sat through. Laura Jones has adapted Peter Carey's novel and Gillian Armstrong has turned out ""something"" that is so chopped up and nonsensical that, apart from from the very quick shots of New South Wales and a magnificent soundtrack by Thomas Newman,  I had to keep pausing the film to say,""WHAT???!!!""

This film is about everything and it is about nothing;it is about obsession and compulsion;it is about different religions;it is about chance and faith;it is about a father and son;it is about how a grandson came to be.........but it certainly IS NOT about two connected characters named Oscar and Lucinda. Each scene of this film is SO short and abrupt that the viewer never has any time to identify/sympathize/empathize with ANY of these extremely disconnected people and events. There are SO many plots and subplots and themes and subthemes and non essential material and characters that it is positively  annoying to see such squander of good source material in the wrong ,uncapable and un-understanding hands. It seems that trying to tell any of the heart and soul that is revealed in Peter Carey's novel in slightly more than two hours proved to be too much for those involved in this endeavour.

What a shock to see the immense talents of A -list actors such as Ralph Fiennes,Cate Blanchett,Ciaran Hinds and Tom Wilkinson literally wasted in 20 second scenes! Even the breathtaking land of the Australian outback is shown for five seconds at the most. AND THE ENDING!!!!!.....what in Heaven's name was that???Either most of this film is still on the cutting room floor( edited by the nefarious Nicholas Beauman of LITTLE WOMEN,COUNTRY LIFE,COSI) or Laura Jones and Gillian Armstrong just simply could not find any center and focus for this beautifully filmed ""butchered"" mess of a movie. 2 1/2 -3 stars  because the Thomas Newman soundtrack is so magnificent.(Buy the soundtrack!)",1175644800,5,2432,4.958230958230958

The fullness with which this is explored, in the complexity of family history, religious influence, the restraint of both social construct and insecurity, make this a remarkable gem that deserves the overwhelming word of mouth that this film has accumulated.

Ralph Fiennes, who was twice nominated for Oscars for ""Schindler's List"" in 1993 & ""The English Patient"" in 1996, does a marvelous job communicating the insecurity and wild love of gambling.  His giddy scene with Lucinda on the ship where his eyes light up and he says, ""Let's play!"" is pure delight.  His blazing red hair is an artistic achievement in and of itself.  Cate Blanchett that the film credits as ""introducing"" is a delight as the independent girl who loses her mother and is thrust into the world.  Blanchett won the Oscar in 2004 for ""The Aviator"" & was nominated for ""Elizabeth"" in 1998.  Her performance is nuanced and charming.  Ciaran Hinds who has been in films ""Miami Vice,"" ""Munich,"" & ""Veronica Guerin"" does a great job as the fluctuating Rev. Dennis Hasset.  Tom Wilkinson who was Oscar-nominated for ""In the Bedroom"" in 2001 does a good job as the Anglican preacher who receives Oscar upon his call to ministry and tries to learn Oscar's system of gambling.  Richard Roxburgh who appeared in ""Moulin Rouge"" & ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" plays Mr. Jeffris who leads the company overland and slaughters the natives.  He does a good job of presenting a variety of character levels in a limited number of scenes.  Josephine Byrnes who was also in ""Matrix Reloaded"" plays the mischievous Miriam Chadwick who eventually becomes mother to Oscar's child.  Gillian Armstrong who directed ""My Brilliant Career"" & ""Little Women"" didn't receive much recognition for this film, although the film did garner one Oscar nomination for Best Costume Design for Janet Patterson.  The acting, cinematography, set design (glass church), costumes and directing of this piece are first rate.

Rewarded with only one Academy Award nomination (Best Costume Design) despite deserving more, in the year when the whole world was obsessed with the much inferior ""Titanic,"" ""Oscar and Lucinda"" fell through the cracks playing mainly in independent movie houses and in those cineplexs that are not terrified of off center story telling and films made outside of Hollywood.

Ralph Fiennes and, in her leading role debut, the marvelous Cate Blanchett, lead an impressive cast in this beautifully shot movie (complete with a gorgeous Thomas Newman score) that tells the story of a love between two quirky misfits in 19th century society.

As part of its ""fallen through the cracks"" status, ""Oscar and Lucinda"" was released on VHS in mid 1997, a couple of years before DVD became the norm and has only in the past month finally been made available on this format.

OSCAR AND LUCINDA is, at the very least, one of my favorite movies of the '90s.  On its outer level, it is a very intimate, bittersweet love story.  But, dig just a little deeper and you find in every aspect of the movie (the plot, the cinematography, even the music) an illustration of what life really is.  Brief, painful, with a few, sometimes very brief and unfulfilled joys.  When I watch this movie, I get a very similar feeling as when I read the book of Ecclesiastes in the Bible.  ""And I set my mind to know wisdom and to know madness and folly; I realized that this also is striving after wind.  Because in much wisdom there is much grief, and increasing knowledge results in increasing pain.""  [Ecc. 1:17,18]  To me, that is the essence of this movie.
This same underlying theme is throughout Peter Carey's book, which Laura Jones did an excellent job rewriting for the screenplay.  I suppose some fans of the novel may be upset that the very ending was changed for the movie, and even though it does give a different twist, I think it works both ways.  Another masterful book-to-film undertaken by L. Jones was AN ANGEL AT MY TABLE, definitely recommended if you enjoyed this movie.
The R rating for this movie is a shame, since there's really only one scene warranting that rating.  Take that out, and you have, at the very most, a PG movie.  Just get ahold of this movie, sit back and enjoy the scenery, story, acting, and music.  Or, just watch a little closer, and enjoy it on a different level.

I would venture to say that her presence can elevate an otherwise mediocre film to being good. This is no easy feat. Oscar and Lucinda is a somewhat slow moving period picture, and while the subject matter is interesting, it will not engage the interest of every viewer. The movie could be well served with analysis of its complex elements, including its main characters' upbringings, the religious background of Ralph Fiennes's character, and the symbolic nature of the glass church the main characters build at the end. Blanchett is remarkable as the unconventional and gambling-addicted Miss Leplastrier, while the always brilliant Ralph Fiennes plays a tormented and equally gambling-addicted love interest who has been estranged from his deeply religious father. The characters are complex and rich, and the interaction between Blanchett and Fiennes' characters are deeply human and believable.

Not that they were without friends entirely, but the  characters were described as having such strange appearrances.  It's about  time!  But it's unfortunate that the film may have been ignored becase  Ralph Fiennes was perhaps not his characteristically debonair self (at  least on a superficial level), or because Cate Blanchett wore what looked  like skirts over pantaloons.
