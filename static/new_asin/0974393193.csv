7794576,5,0974393193,"Yet another historic ride.  The first 6th win in the Tour de France.  And it only took 101 years to get there.  When watching this, and all the others for that matter, remember...THIS IS LIVE TELEVISION.  You are watching the action as it happens.  They do not go back and digitally master the video afterwards.  That includes all the other Tour videos.  And yet, they are all worth buying.  Watching Lance is like watching poetry in motion.",1183852800,,441,4.636363636363637
7794577,3,0974393193,"From the likes of the (few) other reviews, my six-DVD set suffered from 3 technically-inferior discs. #2,4 and 6 all froze intermittently, usually at insignificant places, but unacceptable for $90. I don't own the other years, although friends have said great things about '01-03 especially. I'm returning this to Amazon for full refund, to my surprise since usually defective 'software' usually only merits a replacement. I'm disappointed with the product, but continue to be overwhelmingly impressed with Amazon, and they continue to warrant as much of my business as they earn.",1171670400,,580,5.384615384615385
7794578,4,0974393193,"Just another great year for Lance and the Tour.  The main reason I bought this DVD was for the Alp Dues (stage 16) which is where Lance dominates in an individual time trial.  They show most of the event, cutting out some early parts where the crowd was almost impossible to ride through.  Because of that it only got 4 stars instead of 5.  They cut out what has to be one of the hardest parts of an event like that... all the people in your way... moving at the last second.  The did show some of it, but not the whole thing to give you the real perspective on how crazy it was that day!",1125964800,4,588,4.0344827586206895
7794579,5,0974393193,"As with the previous Tours I've purchased, this one parallels the same basic format.  As some people think showing the mountain stages close to their entirety is a ""waste of DVD space"", I believe they do this specifically because these stages hold a higher interest to most people.  It is in the mountains where the tour is won and lost.  They show the highlights of the flat stages, and all of the sprint finishes, however the majority of the time is spent in the mountains.  Once again the commentary is done brilliantly by Phil and Paul.  If your a Tour fan, you'll definitly enjoy.

Thanks.",1114300800,22,594,4.609523809523809
7794580,3,0974393193,"This DVD set consists of 6 x 2-hour DVDs covering 21 stages of the 2004 Tour. I suspect the 4 hour version and this version have the same first DVD since it covers stages 1-10. I would have thought the extended version would devote more time to some of the earlier stages that were decisive, like the team time trial. Instead, the rest of the stages were spread out over the other five DVDs. Granted, the tour is won in the mountains, but the editors probably could have taken the time to devote a little more DVD space in the extended version to earlier stages that were also important to Lance's 6th.",1104969600,15,602,4.383928571428571
