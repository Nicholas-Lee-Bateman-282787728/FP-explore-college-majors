The ""feel"" of the DVD is like someone followed him around one day and just videoe the kind of training that they do in Gosoku Ryu Karate. I learned nothing from this DVD - sadly. Hardly does this qualify as being called the ""Ultimate Body Conditioning""! I was really hoping for more explanation, training , etc. Yes - I am disappointed but hey, everyone has their own standards, this one was not impressive whatsoever. There are way better karate training DVD's available out there. Start with Kenji Yamaki ""Full-Contact Karate"" DVD, you will like that one!",1517011200,,621,4.7592592592592595
