1899392,3,B0000A02VT,"Quite simply, a good way to kill an hour and 1/2 on a rainy day, otherwise not much to recommend it.  Just the usual one man against an army of evil guys, who has to run the gauntlet to save his beloved (a fine Torri Higginson), and gets a couple of folks who help him killed in he process.  Ho hum.  If you like Roddy Piper's pecs, add half a star.",1244332800,2,349,3.887323943661972
1899393,4,B0000A02VT,"Former WWF wrestling superstar turned B-movie actor Rowdy Roddy Piper leaps straight from the ring and right into the ""Jungleground"" for an all-out assault on a ruthless neighborhood street gang and their leader named Odin. For a low budget B-action movie starring Roddy Piper, ""Jungleground"" is a very entertaining action / thriller filled with lots of explosive action. Piper plays a police detective named Lt. Jake Cornel and he has been given the task of cleaning up the neighborhood and eliminating the threat by any means possible.

While undercover in the Jungleground things go horribly wrong for Cornel and he is caught by the gang. The leader of the gang decides to play a game and he issues a challenge to Cornel. The challenge is simple, escape the ""Jungleground"" and get back home before dawn and he'll be free to go, if not?  It seems that Odin has upped the stakes by taking a hostage. Cornels girlfriend is now being held by Odin and his gang. Can Jake Cornel navigate the gauntlet that is known as the Jungleground and get home in time to save his girlfriend? Does Cornel have a little surprise in store for Odin? Youll have to buy it to find out.

Platinum Disc Corporation has done a really good job with the audio and video transfer for this DVD release. The 2.0 sound is crisp and the video transfer is about the best version of ""Jungleground"" I've ever seen. Platinum Disc has also managed to do something the other studios couldn't; this version has the complete ending. I have purchased two inferior versions of this movie on DVD from other studios in the past and both have missing footage. The city streets have been turned into a ""Jungleground"" enter if you dare!

1899394,5,B0000A02VT,"This ingenious engrossing film is defective on the last chapter. Not to detract from this amazing film, but when you're watching something this crappy, it probably isn't that imporatant what the ending is. Maybe such an abrupt and unexpected cut adds character to this fine cinematic gem.",1157155200,3,288,5.148936170212766
1899395,1,B0000A02VT,"I found this movie to be enjoyable, UNTIL I got to the LAST CHAPTER: The movie STOPPED 3/4 of the way through the Last Chapter.

I sent the DVD back to Amazon, and promptly received another DVD.

The REPLACEMENT DVD was also DEFECTIVE, performing in the same manner.

Amazon should have some type of QUALITY CONTROL for their products.

I am VERY DISAPPOINTED !!!",1115164800,12,363,4.625
