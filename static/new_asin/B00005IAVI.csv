7938182,5,B00005IAVI,I just finished watching the entire series of Anne of Green Gables and I have to tell you it was the best I have ever seen. You watch her grow up and become a beautiful woman. I think the Contining Story portrayed the war... and the love a a wife... very well. She would stop at nothing to find the love of her life. I will watch these movies over and over and let my daughters watch them as well. I know they will love Anne Shirley as much as I do.,1006473600,2,449,3.891304347826087
7938183,5,B00005IAVI,Iam shocked that collen dewhusrt is dead i had no clue she did.  I think that is why the first two movies were better because she was in them and showed how strong she was. I would have liked to see her and Gilberts father get back together but that would have put an end to Girbert and Anne's marrige. I loved Collen Dewhurst in Murphy Brown playing her mother. I loved the way that she could portray a drunk (Termini Station also with Megan Follows) And a strong influence (Anne of green gables series) And a charming woman (Murphy Brown). As I have said I am surprised to find out that she is gone and hope that her movies will go down in history.,989280000,,650,4.2
7938184,3,B00005IAVI,"The main reason I gave the movie 3 stars was because it was about my favorite character Anne Shirley.  I guess the most disappointing thing about it was that it did not take place on Prince Edwards Island but in War torn Europe.  I would have preferred to see Anne and Gilbert finally in a real relationship.  Maybe focus on them after World WarI. Also the idea that Anne is no longer living in Green Gables is kind of sad.  I know Colleen Duhurst passed away a few years ago and so it made since to have her character pass away as well.  I was happy to see some of the old characters like Dianna Barry, Anne's best friend.  If you are new to Anne of Green Gables series and not completly enthralled with it I would say skip this movie.  But if you are like me die hard life long fan the see the movie, it will not be as enchanting as the first two but it will put closer on the series.",988675200,4,886,4.057471264367816
