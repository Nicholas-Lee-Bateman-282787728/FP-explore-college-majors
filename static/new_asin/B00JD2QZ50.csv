8649798,5,B00JD2QZ50,A very nice look at some of the folks and what motivates them in the living history world. Covers a broad scope of time periods from the Romans up to the WWII folks. It is not just about the military side of things as civilian living history is covered as well. The subjects being interview appear to be very comfortable in the interviews. Maurice does a great job in getting these folks to share what motivates them into doing this crazy and sometimes very expensive hobby of ours! Thanks for Maurices engaging style no matter the time period the passion which animates those being interviewed comes through!,1404518400,,609,4.700934579439252
8649799,4,B00JD2QZ50,"Whether you are historical re-enactor, or just interested in why anyone would want to dress up and play ""war"", this little independent film has something for everyone along the scale.  It covers a broad timeline that includes Roman centurians, The Napoleonic & War of 1812, American Civil War, and both WWI & WW II.  I found the section on the Roman centurians fascinating, as this is a group I am not as familiar with, as well as the WW I nurses.  It is intriguing to hear how someone fell into the game, and it's obvious in several segments there is a comfortable connection between the interviewer & his subjects--more like friends chatting than a formal interview. This second film is less dreamlike, but more cohesive, than the first.  We do see some of the same people, as a few years have elapsed between films--I particularly enjoyed the love stories that had developed in the interim .  Re-enacting isn't just about playing ""war"", and what film is considered complete without a hint of romance?",1402963200,,1003,4.77456647398844
8649800,5,B00JD2QZ50,"Very nice insite into living history, how people of different walks of life educate folks on their history by bring history alive, the real history not the Movie/TV or modern day school system history, from the clothing, uniforms, equipment, weapons, tools, and even vehicles of the past time. I recamend this video",1402790400,,315,5.076923076923077
8649801,2,B00JD2QZ50,Has somewhat more entertainment value and decent interviews than the first DVD of the series.  Basically interviews with reenactors delving into their reason for reenacting.,1401840000,,173,5.92
