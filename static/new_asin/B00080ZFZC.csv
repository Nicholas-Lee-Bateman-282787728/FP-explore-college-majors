2256300,4,B00080ZFZC,"Oh, those childhood memories.  Those very inaccurate history lessons, very bad puns, and cheezy animation.  No, I'm not talking about ""South Park.""  I'm referring to those Jay Ward shorts in the Rocky and Bullwinkle Show.  Still, this IS funny stuff.  Well worth owning.  Anyone interested in animation or those wacky 60s and 70s should make this required viewing.  The jokes are a little stale now, but were they ever that fresh anyway.  Who cares!!! It's Mr. Peabody and his boy Sherman.  Sit (way)back and enjoy.",1116720000,38,515,4.964705882352941
2256301,5,B00080ZFZC,"The Peabody & Sherman shorts just might get kids interested in learning history. No, the cartoons aren't terribly accurate, certainly aren't culturally sensitive, and are filled with silly puns, but they are still clean, funny, and watchable decades after their release. If they spark a young girl or boy's interest in the past, then bravo.",1459209600,,340,5.2

2256338,4,B00080ZFZC,"Though the animation is dated, the humor transcends it's time and makes the original episodes of ""Mr. Peabody & Sherman"" more worth watching than recent modern attempts to bring them back to audiences.

bad, the original is the best by far. The good thing is the original series holds up very well with the passage of time. I credit the excellent writing
and voices and of course the music for making the series a classic in every good sense of the word.
Watch this by yourself or with your kids. It is funny.",1444867200,,432,3.9770114942528734

If you're not fairly well educated, some of the quips at the end of the episodes might go right over your head, but stick with it.  Think of it as a brain game!

Now that I'm older, I am amazed at the highly intellectual and satirical writing of the Rocky & Bullwinkle episodes. I had fun with it in my youth and have even more fun with it now. Lots of good, clean, un-offensive fun.

Mr. Peabody's adventures in time (with his adopted boy, Sherman) were a popular feature of Ward's ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" show. These shorts gleefully butcher everything you ever learned about history, lampooning great discoveries and achievements from ancient Greece into the 19th century. Peabody's genius always saves the day, while the dimwitted Sherman sets up the inevitable bad pun to cap off the episode.

Rocky and Bullwinkle were big favorites of his.  Anyway, the series still works and is still fun to watch.  A perfect combination of both silly and sophisticated jokes, with some sweetness thrown in.  Fun for kids and adults alike, at least I hope so.

So while the humor and history in this is going to be appreciated by a 7yr or up, the animation style will appeal more to a 4-5 yr old.",1399766400,,293,4.232142857142857
2256670,5,B00080ZFZC,"The funny thing is that I didn't realize when I was a kid how crudely some of the characters are drawn, but that downtick does not affect my enjoyment.

(I assume the ""Wayback Machine"" that shows how web pages used to look years ago got its name from Mr. Peabody's invention.)

I especially love the puns at the end of each historical vignette, for example,

the sea explorer who was first to travel around the world being such a good poker player that he won 265 games in a row, all with the same type of hand. It's in the history books, the STRAIGHTS OF MAGELLAN.

or the famous author who got put in jail, he was BARRED IN AVON, but history changed it to BARD OF AVON.

I hope when I get done with the BEST OF, that I will find other examples. I'm watching it in small pieces so my enjoyment can stretch.

2256697,5,B00080ZFZC,"Oh, God. I've just let everybody know how old I am! Once upon a time, when the world made sense(at least to me) there was a cartoon called Rockey and Friends, featuring Rocket(hence Rocky) J. Squirrell and his best friend, Bullwinkle T. Moose. They  had an arch enemy named Boris Badenov and his girlfriend, Natasha. You younger pups may have seen an extremely forgettable movie featuring them. It was so bad and forgettable that, thankfully, I forgot the name of the movie. Rocky's friends included Dudley Doright of the Royal Canadian Mounties and his girlfriend Nell, Aesop's fables, Fractured Fairy Tales and our above featured duo, Mr. Peabody & Sherman. Mr. Peabody was obviously a dog, albeit a genius, who had adopted a young boy named Sherman from an orphange. As he put it, ""If every boy should have a dog, it was only logical that every dog should have a boy."" Mr. Peabody had invented the Wayback Machine which allowed he and Sherman to enter a date, step into the Wayback Machine, and immediately be transported back in time to that date. These trips usually came about because Sherman was a bright and inquisitive boy and wanted to know the story behind whatever had occured on that date. Nine times out of nine, Mr. Peabody had to intervene because somone was about to do something stupid, which would have altered what we now know was the course of history as it was supposed to have happened. At the end of every story, when Mr. Peabody had set the course of history straight, he offered up to Sherman an excellent lesson punctuated by an equally excellent pun. The show was great for many reasons, not the least of which was it taught kids history. The history may have been somewhat skewed in the telling but, in the end, it made history interesting for kids and also taught them the meaning of satire! You'll notice that Amazon also offers all of the affiliated Rocky shows in their catalog. If you enjoy this series, do yourself a favor and look up the Pogo series. Pogo was a possum in the swamps of the Okeefenokee and featured one of the most intriguing set of characters you will ever meet.  There was Howlan Owl, Albert the Alligator, Churchy LaFemme(get it?) the turtle, 'Lil Pup Dog, and many others. The strip was written by Walt Kelly, one of the greatest cartoonists and philosophers who ever lived. He was one of the first major cartoonists to lampoon public politicians, from George Wallace, J. Edgar Hoover, Spiro Agnew, Tricky Dick Nixon, and a host of others. He was fearless in his visual portrayals of them and his unabashed opinion of the cultural times. You will not only enjoy all of the shenanigans of the denizens of the swamp, but it's also a real hoot to try to recognize all the public figures. He took on the KKK, whom he referred to as the Kluck Klams, and no nut fringe group or individual was left unscathed. I know I say it a lot but, THANK YOU AMAZON for making these incredibly historical and important glimpses into another time available to us. I hope you enjoy all of these collections and take great personal pride that you can actually understand the difference between them and the garbage that our children watch today that are passed off as cartoons. I'm sorry, I forgot that what our kids watch today really ARE cartoons aimed at ""the great unwashed"" who wouldn't be able to comprehend the afore mentioned works of art. I wish I could take credit for the  term ""the great unwashed"", but I can't remember where I heard it, So instead of suing me for plagerism, take gratification in the fact that I liked it enough to steal it! I'll leave plagerism to a certain current politician(we all KNOW who you are!) At least, he doesn't mangle the language like another of his cohorts, W, did. THANKS- Tim Drain. You're all welcome to email me at william.t.drain@gmail.com if you like. I must caution you that I'm somewhat crazy, but you probably already know that.",1397260800,,3917,4.641210374639769

What interests me beyond the style of the shorts is that the cultural references that are the bases of the puns are nearly extinct themselves.

2256809,4,B00080ZFZC,"Before there was Dr. Who, before Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure,  there was the Rocky and Bullwinkle show, with many fast paced fractured tales of history and fairy tales.
As a regular staple of cartoon viewing in the early 1960s, Jay Ward's production stood out from the others with quick, sly wit, bad puns and fast pace.

This collection is a wonderful example of the style of his animation, starting from the very first Mr. Peabody and Sherman cartoon installment, setting up the series and explaining
just who they are and why they are together.  Bet you never heard that tale, did you?

This volume, billed ""The BEST of Mr. Peabody and Sherman Volume 1"" contains 15 of the roughly five minute features, with luminaries like, Napolean, Cleopatra, Ben Franklin, and others.  The puns come thick and fast, but the last bad pun for the closer is guaranteed to be a groaner.

This is a must see for the younger generation, to see what their parents and grandparents grew up on, long before Bart and Homer Simspson tried to corner the market on smart ass comments.

A reasonable value on it's own, an extra feature of the Bullwinkle live puppet intros that were featured during the first season are included.

Though this DVD doesn't show anything more than the basic Mr. Peabody and Sherman, it is a good item to have or share.  Perhaps another DVD that contains a sample complete show might give more of the overall flavor, but this isn't bad.

My kids were appalled, but sat through the entire DVD with mom and dad and we laughed again at the bad puns and simple animation. Don't miss this opportunity to share the laughs.",1314489600,3,1627,4.6573426573426575

ALL TV dogs, thanks to hanna-barbera are DUMB, STUPID, or COWARDS. (Scooby-Doo). It is refreshing to see a cartoon with SOME educational value and done with good wit.  I don't think there has been another SMART canine. The closest

Mr. Peabody adopts a boy, Sherman, and invents the WABAC (pronounced way back) machine to entertain and educate his young charge.

2256825,4,B00080ZFZC,Some of the pun references are so old that they would not be understood today.  And of course some of the characterizations might now be considered insensitive and politically incorrect.  In spite of all that Peabody is a very witty and funny know-it-all.

2256828,5,B00080ZFZC,I want to start off by saying that I am not a serious collector so my review will not be based on other products of this nature.  I simply bought the video to share with my children.  I wanted them to see what animation was like when I was little.  They couldn't believe we only watched cartoons on Saturday morning.  This was a great memory and we had a wonderful time watching Mr. Peabody and Sherman solve the historical mysteries.,1185235200,11,434,4.3875

2256830,4,B00080ZFZC,"Mr. Peabody is a TV talisman.  I always walk away from these cartoons feeling magically transformed and energized.

In the realm of vintage cartoons made on minimal budgets, Jay Ward rules!  Peabody & Sherman, along with Rocky & Bullwinkle, etc, were very much like sly, fast-talking radio plays staged by smartly stylized cartoon characters.  This DVD also contains rare Bullwinkle puppet segments that were used in the early broadcasts.  They too underline how WAY ahead of the curve Ward was in terms of getting sophisticated and sometimes subversive humor in under the radar.

By the way, Peabody's ""boy"" Sherman was voiced by a man in his 40's named Robert Tetley.  Amazing.",1118448000,37,679,5.063063063063063
