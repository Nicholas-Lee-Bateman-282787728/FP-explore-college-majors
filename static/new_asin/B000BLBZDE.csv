8430191,5,B000BLBZDE,"Zaman The Man from the Reeds starts off as a sort of 70's French documentary that almost looks like some dystopian sci-fi, indeed, it almost does foreshadow that the Reed people will be eradicated from Iraqi.

Later it ventures into pure naturalism. It involves a very simple man, Zaman, who lives his life as his ancestors have done for centuries. He has adopted a young boy whose parents were killed. Zaman prays each day, accepting his fate without critique. He learns that his wife is very sick and he must get her some medicine. In order to do so, he rows up the river in a simple canoe towards bigger cities. He finds new places and adventures, finally he must go to Baghdad. Baghdad seems like a very chaotic place, as the cars make a mess of everything and pollute the air, nearly run over people and make drivers hostile. Zaman gets around as best as he can. He finds a hospital but corrupt bureaucratic management prevents him from getting the medicine. A kind woman helps him.

Zaman The Man from the Reeds actually proved to be an enjoyable film. Not only is the setting very beautiful but the humanism of simple people can be powerful. If anything, the religious overtones aren't too strong or rigid. The acting is natural and the oncoming war of conquest by USA can be hinted at.",1389225600,,1293,4.568965517241379
8430192,4,B000BLBZDE,"Zaman lives in southern Iraq in the Tigris/Euphrates delta with his wife and adopted son.  Zaman's wife, Najma, becomes critically ill and he must travel to Baghdad to find the correct medicine and save her life.  What follows is the ups and downs of Zaman's journey to Baghdad.  We watch both Zaman's journey and his wife's concern, and come to understand the profound love that each has for the other.  Along the way there are some beautiful shots of the Tigris/Euphrates delta, and a small slice-of-life window into pre-invasion Iraq (both of the Marsh Arabs and big city life).  Zaman's obstacles are not huge or overly dramatic (i.e. he isn't trying to get to Baghdad during a war).  He faces pretty much the same problems that anyone would face traveling to a distant city to search for something (e.g. many of the pharmacies don't have the medicine, and when he finds a clinic/hospital that does, they won't give him the medicine without the proper documentation).  This film is set just before the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, but the invasion (or the events leading up to the invasion) plays almost no role in the film.  Beautiful cinematography and silently emotional.  The tragic ending is fairly predictable, but it is Zaman's adopted son who, by returning to a theme presented early in the film, puts everything in perspective for Zaman.  A low key film with a touching love affair that is definitely recommended if not uniquely outstanding.",1217721600,4,1454,4.850202429149798
