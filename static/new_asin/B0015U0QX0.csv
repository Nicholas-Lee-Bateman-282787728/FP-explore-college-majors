3147453,5,B0015U0QX0,I enjoyed this dvd! I already look forward to the series and enjoy it also. It's fun to dream about weddings like this.,1295308800,2,119,4.217391304347826
3147454,5,B0015U0QX0,"I agree this is nothing but ""omg look at my new wedding braclet that barely cost 3 million dollars"" kind of show. However, I am obsessed with shows like this. Platnium weddings, Super sweet 16, shows that most people crindge and spit over. Mostly because I am obsessed with my own wedding that I hope will happen in 5 years. Ya sure I get jealous, but It's a tiny subset to the excitment and joy it brings me to watch it. I like seeing what a crazy expensive weddings look like and watch other shows like Rich bride Poor Bride to compare and learn from their mistakes. Obviously there are no 'mistakes' in platnium weddings (as far as the viewrs know) but It's fun to see the process and plan to copy something you saw and liked that would only be a fraction of the cost. I am pretty sure you have to be amused as easily as a 5 year old to get as excited as me about this. I'm the only person I know who watches it religiously on tv lol.

What I'm saying is, that this show CAN be amazing if you are happy-jealous like myself. You watch it and say, ""SUPER COOL! I wish I could do something like that!""
If you just say, ""pft. wish I could afford something like that"" then this show is nothing special.",1246579200,4,1200,4.172413793103448
3147455,4,B0015U0QX0,I enjoy watching the show Platinum Weddings on wetv and although I can see why many people wouldn't want to watch it because of the green-eyed monster and some others might think that this show displays money slinging at its worst; they are both wrong. Most of the weddings featured show the bride and groom equally involved in planning and equally sharing the cost of the nuptials. This isn't just another show that parades obnoxious and spoiled daddy's girls getting their every desire met; it shows grown men and women who know what they want and can afford to have it all.,1218412800,6,576,4.6568627450980395

8259990,5,B0015U0QX0,"We really enjoyed watching these weddings. It showed us what a really elegant party takes in staff and money. It is something to see. A lot of ""Bridezilla"" cds are of people who simply have no idea how to entertain. They throw  thousands at all aspects of their dream and fall apart when they think everyone else is going to work and they are going to bask in Bridedom.
 This cd has the professionals working with the families and they are a wow. Money is no object. so this cd is for the enjoyment of the non envious.",1390867200,,518,4.275510204081633
