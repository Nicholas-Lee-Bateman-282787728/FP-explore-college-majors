8519480,5,B007M37IKI,Spinning Southward arrived in the mail yesterday and I watched it last night. This movie is inspirational and just what I needed to see. I really enjoyed the contrast of film and photo and also the interview based dialogue that shared the journey with everyone encountered. Well worth watching and supporting the National Brain Tumor Society makes the purchase well worthwhile. Enjoy!,1337644800,,384,5.209677419354839
