8102611,5,B000DLBC9Y,"Moving portrait of sibling rivalry, beautifully photographed.  Hugh Jackman's performance is compelling.  Interesting insight into Australian male pub culture. Doesn't play by the numbers, you have to hang in there to get the full reward.",1514764800,,238,5.771428571428571
8102612,4,B000DLBC9Y,"Moving story, well performed, particularly by Jackman.  Brought me to tears which is quite the feat.  Script reads almost like an indie play with the close up brooding raw emotion and long slow buildup which was a little hard to get through and why I am dropping a star.  The lead is a little flat as well-though that is part if the character profile.  All and all an interesting and deeply moving little 90's Aussie film and a must see as Jackman' s first movie and breakthrough role if you are a fan.",1508544000,,502,4.365591397849462
8102613,5,B000DLBC9Y,"Being a big fan of his and having met him on several occasions, I wanted to have all of his movies in a collection.  This is a good one.",1388448000,,136,3.689655172413793
8102614,4,B000DLBC9Y,"Living close to Erskineville, well a lot appears to have been shot around Newtown, Sydney, I picked this up at a flea market not expecting too much. But as said by another reviewer (whose star rating seems to have slipped if you look at its title), it is a rare film (and rarer in Aussie) about blokes dealing with those bloody awkward things of emotions, loss, grief and brotherly rivalry. What I liked about this film is the sizzling, bleached light quality of a lot of the shots. OK other than those dingy, faded, mothballing interior ones. I guess what I am at is that the cinematography kept pace with the story which turned out to be a cracker all round. Great acting, understated and then over big in drama as the boys manoeuvred their balls in and out of shot. It is not feel good cinema. Not rinky/dinky Aussie humour but Jackman as the tortured Wace, bless him, is exceptional. Marty Dennis as younger brother Barky is an impressive foil playing emotional catch up with you can't know what you were not told. This deserves a place in the same bracket as Ray Winstone in ""War Games"". Not for the faint of heart but worth the watch and absorb.",1369440000,,1151,4.485714285714286
8102615,1,B000DLBC9Y,"Beautifully heartbreaking backdrop but the unbelievably bad script made me cringe and spoilt the overall viewing experience.  How Marty Deniss got the 'lead' role I will never know...he was painful to watch - he lacked expression, emotion and showed no understanding of dramatic timing. Just as I was being drawn into the story his appaulling performance yanked me straight out again... Any of the Erskineville cast would have played a more convincing Barky.  In stark contrast, Jackman's screen debut was thrilling - a captivating performance - a believable, sexy and tortured portrayal of the guilt laden older brother, Wace.  Good music, but a little overpowering. Beautiful scenery, but overall a disappointing film.",1342483200,,720,5.410714285714286
8102616,5,B000DLBC9Y,"It's strange that this movie is incredibly underrated and people ""just"" rate it with 3 stars. I've watched it 3x in 2 days. What can I say, this only happens with good movies. They capable to draw you in and keep you interested every second. Very slow paced but full of tension. And all actors are brilliant. Not only Hugh Jackman. The way the movie is shot is like watching art. Moreover the score by Don Miller-Robinson is brillliant and haunting, and as good as scores by Ennio Morricone and Ry Cooder. All in All a movie to have in your collection.",1296518400,2,552,4.421568627450981
8102617,4,B000DLBC9Y,"One of the first big-screen movies of Hugh Jackman... Written for someone else, (Marty Deniss who plays Barky), this movie is totally full of Hugh's moving sadness and anger. He is supposed to play one of the secondary parts, the heroe's brother, but he can't help catching your eye, your heart, your full attention. They all look so colourless as soon as Wace shows up... Good story anyway, not for the youngest ones because of themes like abusing parents, drug use, etc... but definitly worth your money, and a ""must-have"" for all Hugh lovers !",1276128000,,546,4.757894736842105
8102618,3,B000DLBC9Y,"A very sense of a family story has been lost in swearing the characters instantly used to in between urinating and kicking at a toilet while a junior brother returned home after his dad passing away - to get his piece of assets, or?

A work is good for improving the Aussie accent mostly.",1274486400,,288,4.333333333333333
8102619,2,B000DLBC9Y,"Sad man, sad town, seeking friends and family, relooking and rethinking old memories and relationships.  Powerful portrait of the brother played by Hugh Jackman.  While I saw it on VHS and not DVD, this should apply.  There's a soundtrack CD also.",1180137600,5,247,4.975609756097561
