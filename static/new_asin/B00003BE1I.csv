7916986,1,B00003BE1I,Man from like the start of this movie it was just pure wack this movie wasent too much a gangster movie was just watching this cause I was bored but this movie wouldnt recommend somebody to buy it,1519084800,,196,4.184210526315789
7916987,1,B00003BE1I,I guess Ice T had nothing better to do with his money.,1493251200,,54,3.5833333333333335
7916988,2,B00003BE1I,"I am a BIG Ice-T fan, but even I have to admit, the only way to watch this movie is to watch the Ice-T commentary version.  It's an absolute scream! He obviously knows how poorly the film came out, and is not above telling us about it.  Ice-T is, well... Ice-T in his comments.  Be prepared.",1113177600,3,291,4.160714285714286
7916989,4,B00003BE1I,"this film is simply woeful.theres no other way to describe it.utterly devoid of acting,basic character development,and utterly no plot.i may slag certain films for poor dialogue or acting,but this doesnt contain ANY!!!!! the thing is,theres a certain enjoyment in watching something so pathetic that they seem ignorant to the fact its rubbish.it jerks and jumps and goes absolutely no where.there is no plot.no plot whatsoever.however,switch on the ice T commentary,and hey!!! its great!!!! this is possibly one of the best commentarys ever!!!! almost everything he says is hilarious!!! he basically admits the film is terrible and he was just having a laugh.he asks why silkk the shocker appeared in it.""he's rich i dunno why he agreed to it"".yeah,so do we. he goes on at length about how they didn't bother to film in new york,instead filming in a cheepo dump somewhere in eastern europe.theres so many quotes that ice T said that stick in my mind.for example,theres shots of new york when it switches from scene to scene.""look at this,this is what new york is...tenements,hills....."" wow thanks for that one.""if you hear any noises,i had taco bells before i came here"".""i don't know what the hell thats supposed to mean"".""that B**** keeps looking at the clock,i dunno what message that means though"".are brilliant!!!!!!! ice t is hillarious in this!!!!!! the guy has a great sense of humour,and i get the feeling what he does is meant to be taken slightly ironically.so,to summarise it; if you're looking for a film with action and thrills,look elsewhere.however,if you're looking for a rubbish film,and have someone make great comments about it,then look no further!!!!! id DEFINATELY recommend you buy this!!!!!!! i laughed pretty much the whole way through it. 4 outta 5",1074729600,,1776,5.170138888888889
7916990,1,B00003BE1I,"THIS IS ONE POOR EXCUSE FOR A GANGSTA MOVIE. A YOUNG THUG [SILKK THE SHOCKER] TRYS TO ESCAPE THE WRATH OF AN O.G. [ICE-T]. THIS HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE SHORTEST MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. COME ON, THIS MOVIE DIDN'T EVEN LAST AN HOUR! FILLED WITH ICE-T MUSIC FROM BEGINNING TO END. THIS MOVIE IS SERIOUSLY FLAWED. AS ALWAYS, IT'S FILMED ON A CHEAP BUDGET AND IT'S FILLED WITH BAD ACTING. THIS HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE MOST EMBARRASING MOVIES THAT ICE-T HAS EVER APPEARED IN. DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID. STAY AWAY FROM THIS TRASH AT ALL COSTS.",1069632000,,556,4.157407407407407
7916991,3,B00003BE1I,"Well, both movies are from trash-flick-director Albert Pyun, so that should be a warning enough to most of you, but ""Mean Guns"" really ist one of his best movies (stylishly filmed, with cool characters (Christopher Lambert is great in his role!) and dispite a stupid story good trashy fun)...
Now let's find some words about ""Corrupt"": ""Bad, stupid and cheap"" come to mind ... must I say more?
All in all I gave 3 stars: 4 for ""Mean Guns"", 1 for ""Corrupt"", 1/2 for the double-feature-DVD.
If you like Albert Pyun flicks, buy this edition, if you are not into trash-B-film - be warned...",1022284800,4,586,4.644230769230769
7916992,4,B00003BE1I,"this movie was real short but it was aight. i luv silkk the shocker so i watch it alot, but, if u just watched it 2 c silkk the shocker like i did,  he's not n it dat much. the movie is basically about how people can get  caught n situations even if there innocent.",966384000,,265,3.8
7916993,1,B00003BE1I,"This movie was garbage just like ""Urban Menace"" what in the world is Ice-T ,and Silkk the Shocker thinking about. This had the same actor's the same setting ,and more bad acting ,and bad editing as  ""Urban Menace"" Ice-T done lost his damn mind.",951696000,3,244,4.545454545454546
