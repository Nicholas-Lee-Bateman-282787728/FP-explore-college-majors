7816443,4,6301910915,"Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat,The British Bulldog and The Texas Tornado VS The Warlord and Power and Glory: Warlord looked kinda like Stone Cold but only bigger and Hercules looked like a shorter version of Jake Roberts. A good match and the last few minutes where chaos and the ending looked botched. Still, it was enjoyable.

Bret Hart VS Mr Perfect: An all time classic match. Both men put on a hell of a show and the ending was perfect. No pun intended.

Natural Disasters VS Bushwhackers: Why were the Bushwhackers so popular? This match sucked.

Virgil VS Ted DiBiase: Sigh. Ive watched mostly every WWF ppv from the 80's and 90's and still wonder why Million Dollar Man was never given a proper push. Losing to Virgil? Come on. I suppose it fit the feud and Virgil had probably his only good match of his career. Still, painful to watch DiBiase be nothing more then a jobber.

Bossman VS Mountine: A fun match. The next five minutes of the event would show Mountine going to jail and getting a cell with a gay guy. For a family friendly WWF event (at this point in time), there was alot of innuendos thru out the commentary during this event.

Nasty Boys VS LOD: After nearly five or more minutes of Mountine skits and lots of interviews, here comes anther classic match. A great match to watch and the ending was cool.

IRS VS Greg Valentine: This must have been around the time IRS debuted. The match was decent but the ending came off weak. Why did WWF put such crappy matches before the main event? Shouldn't you build the fans interest, unless you wanted them to have a bathroom break.

Match Made in Hell-Hogan and Warrior VS Sgt Slaughter, Col. Mustafa, and Gen. Adnan with Sid Justice as speical guest ref: This main event sucked. Slaughter and his team did a poor effort and Hogan did his best. I'd say it was one of the weaker Summerslam main events.

Macho Man's wedding is next. It basically sets up the feud with Jake Roberts.

Overall, a half and half ppv. Some classic matches and some bad matches. Well worth it for Perfect-Hart alone.",1237075200,,2057,4.537837837837838
7816444,4,6301910915,"This was the first SummerSlam I remember seeing (to the point that I still have the tape over 15 years later) and this was without one of the best SummerSlam's of all time to this day...which WWF (it sounds weird to say that these days).  It had it something for everyone here.

The Dragon (Ricky Steamboat), Texas Tornado (Kerry Von Erich), and British Bulldog (Davey Boy Smith) vs. Warlord and Power & Glory - This was just a good average opener to get the crowd warmed up.  Besides the fact that it was the first time I remember seeing these three legends team up along with the fact that this was Steamboat's only PPV appearence during his second run in WWF...nothing else really memorable here.

Intercontinental Champion Mr. Perfect vs. Bret Hart - This is a pure wrestling fans dream here and tons of credit here goes to Mr. Perfect for putting on this type of performance with a back injury that would keep him out of the ring for over a year.  This would be the match that put Bret Hart on the map as a solo star after being a tag team specialist for over 5 years.  This was also the debut of the Sharpshooter...that Bret admitted was taught to him by mexican superstar Konnan.  Match of the night & thank goodness that Bret picked this match for his DVD set.
(Also available on Bret Hart's ""Best There Is, Best There Was, Best There Ever Will Be"" DVD set)

Bushwackers vs. Natural Disasters - Besides the fact that this was Andre The Giant's last appearence on PPV before his passing, this was just a squash match to cool the crowd off before the next big match.

Million $ Champion Ted Dibiase vs. Virgil - Just like how Virgil was impressive at WrestleMania, he continued to impress here in this match.  Either that or Dibiase is a very underrated performer who can make his opposition look like a million bucks (no pun intended).  Either way, it was a match that was better than expected with Virgil finally getting the victory & redemption over his ex-boss at the time.

Jailhouse Match: Big Boss Man vs. Mountie - The match itself was short & sweet but also enjoyable but it was the skits they kept doing with the Mountie all night were so comedic that to this day, I still laugh everytime I see them.

Street Fight Match: Tag Team Champions Nasty Boys vs. Legion Of Doom - Another match that was short & sweet and enjoyable.  It wasn't a weapons spotfest but a big brawl that was very well planned out & giving us a historcal finish with the L.O.D./Road Warriors becoming the first & only team to hold all the championship of all the major fedeations at that time.
(Also avaiable on Road Warriors DVD)

Greg ""The Hammer"" Valentine vs. I.R.S. - Just a filler match, nothing memorable here.

Hulk Hogan & Ultimate Warrior vs. Sgt. Slaughter, Gen. Adnan, Col. Mustafa w/Sid Justice as the special referee - This was a fun match to watch as everyone's effort here put together a good matchup and the whole mystery surrounding what Sid would do added to the match as well.  However, this match will probably be more famous for what happened backstage between Warrior & Vince McMahon than the match itself which again, was a good fun match to watch.

The Wedding Of Ms. Elizabeth & ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage - Unlike all weddings in WWF/E today where they end up having a storyline twist to them, this didn't & came off very classy so that Savage & Elizabeth (who were married in real life) and now acknowledge in public that they are married.  This was one of the most (if not THE MOST) classiest moments in the history of the company.
However, the wedding reception (which was a home video exclusive) aftermath had Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts & Undertaker crash the party before being ran off by Sid Justice.

Overall, this again I'll say was one of the best SummerSlam's of all time as the pointless matches were really quick & the rest of the card had something for everyone: pure wrestling, brawls, entertainment, ect.  I recommend this tape.",1182038400,,3953,4.53943661971831
7816445,4,6301910915,"In August 1991, Summerslam's annual event occurred once more at Madison Square Garden.  Overall, it remains a solid WWF effort well worth viewing nearly fifteen years later.

The highlight reel:

1. Randy Savage and Elizabeth's wedding ceremony: 5 *****
Give the WWF some savvy credit for protecting Savage & Elizabeth's real-life privacy, as they already had been married for seven years at the time.  The pre-wedding nostalgic video montage of their best WWF moments and the ceremony itself is a poignant tribute to them.

2. Bret Hart vs. I-C Champion Curt ""Mr. Perfect"" Hennig: 5 *****
With his parents looking on from ringside, Hart finally gets his chance at solo stardom.  Despite Hennig's obvious discomfort (from real-life injuries), this legendary match really should have been this show's main event.

3. Road Warriors vs. WWF Tag Team Champions the Nasty Boys (no DQ): 4 ****
The Road Warriors become the only team to win all three major wrestling company tag titles (back when the NWA and AWA were still around).  This is arguably the Warriors' best WWF brawl!

4. Big Bossman vs. the Mountie (Jacques Rougeau) where the loser supposedly will spend a night in jail: 4 ****
Not a great match itself, but Rougeau makes the best of some so bad, it's funny type material in the post-match updates.

5. Virgil (cheered on by Roddy Piper) vs. Ted DiBiase (with Scary Sherri) for the ""million dollar belt"": 3 1/2 ***
It's much better than expected because you won't have to settle for a cheap finish.

6. Bobby Heenan ""confronts"" WWF Champion Hulk Hogan with Ric Flair's world championship belt.  This may have been the first  acknowledgement that Flair had just signed with the WWF after being terminated by the now-defunct WCW.
3 1/2 ***

7. Rick Steamboat, Kerry Von Erich, & Davey Boy Smith vs. Power & Glory, and the Warlord: 3 ***
The opener is nothing especially memorable.  Still, seeing some vintage Steamboat (saddled with a horrible circus ""fire-breathing"" gimmick), with solid back-up from Smith & Von Erich, certainly makes this six-man tag worth watching.

The lowlights:

1. Hulk Hogan & the Ultimate Warrior vs. Sgt. Slaughter, Iron Sheik, & General Adnan (with guest referee Sid Vicious): 1 1/2 *
One word sums it all up: awful!  This disappointing main event simply isn't worth waiting for, as it is just an excuse for Hogan and guest referee Sid Vicious to eventually team up for a pointless series of post-match flexes and poses for the fans.  Meanwhile, the Warrior disappears chasing off after the villains and doesn't return until the following April at Wrestlemania VIII!  He must have gotten lost finding his way out of the building.

2. Bushwhackers (w/ Andre at ringside) vs. the Natural Disasters: 1 *
Even the Road Warriors rescuing a crippled Andre at the match's end couldn't prevent this natural disaster.

3. Greg 'The Hammer' Valentine vs. Mike 'I.R.S.' Rotundo: 2 **
Both guys seem to know this boring match is just filler material, so Rotundo's win proves easily forgettable.  It is notable, however, that this is one of Valentine's rare appearances as the fan favorite.

In summary, despite an atrocious Warrior/Hogan tag team main event, Summerslam 1991 is still a worthy video investment and could easily rank as one of the best WWF pay-per-view events of the early 1990's.  I particularly recommend the event for all Savage & Elizabeth fans (as well as for the historic Hart vs. Hennig showdown).",1095724800,2,3442,4.934027777777778
