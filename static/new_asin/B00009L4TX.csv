7991203,4,B00009L4TX,"Wings Hauser is basically Arnold in Predator by way of Kurt Russell in Escape From New York in this movie. Wings is so awesome that he can handle the work loads of 2 A-List action heroes in one movie. He can also do it while being introduced wearing mom jeans. He keeps all the other important Wings trademarks too. Sure, he's been wrongly convicted of a crime he didn't commit like the A-Team and is dressed up like Arnold from the Predator fighting an alien in the jungle but nobody else does it with yelling with a vague country accent and increasingly wild hair that makes him look more deranged than heroic.

The movie itself is almost up to Wing's level. It's basically Predator mixed with Escape From NY. The Dean Koontz bits are tacked on and not over used sadly. Wings would actually be a great choice for a Dean Koontz film. He's got that ability to play anything straight faced while going over the top. It's not a great plot but it's fun and hits the right notes as necessary.

Gore is very present here. Watchers 3 actually has some great gore effects. It makes up for the less successful creature effects too.

Wings never got the fame he deserved. He's genuinely good here and commits in ways other b-actors never do. Unfortunately, I don't think in the current film climate a guy as singular and wild as him will get the respect he deserves. However, hopefully, he'll get his due some day and get placed up there with other wild man talents like Oliver Reed, Nicolas Cage, and really Matthew McConaughey.",1462147200,,1520,4.54014598540146
7991204,3,B00009L4TX,"This movie is a pure rip-off of Predator, but it's still somewhat enjoyable if you aren't looking for Oscar worthy material.",1455148800,,124,4.9523809523809526
7991205,2,B00009L4TX,"They resurrected the Rubbermaid creature and smart dog for another adventure in the words. A group of military ex-cons are allowed to fight ""The Outsider"" with the help of a boy and his dog. Pretty boring ""Predator"" type stuff with a moronically crafted monster (see cover). You did good if you made it through the first two of the series. Watch all the Predator films instead. Could have MST potential.

7991206,1,B00009L4TX,"After reading the awesome book ""Watchers"" I tried to order the original Watchers movie starring Corey Haim but found out it is somewhat hard to find and very pricy when you do. So I ordered this movie hoping it would be good. What a horrible piece of crap movie. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF JUNK.",1379203200,,309,4.254237288135593
7991207,4,B00009L4TX,"This is even more different from the Koontz novel, but fairly interesting. The ""creature"" in the book seemed to be a highly altered version of a baboon or mandril. This movie's creature was a bit closer thyan the one in the first two ""Watchers"" movies.",1369785600,2,252,4.622222222222222
7991208,5,B00009L4TX,I just cant get enough of Watchers. I have them all. Author Dean Koontz is the best. For all horror-levered lovers.,1353974400,,115,4.523809523809524
7991209,3,B00009L4TX,"When the first entry in the Watchers series--a series ever so loosely based on a Dean Koontz novel--offered up a teenage Corey Haim bantering with an intelligent dog named Einstein, I knew I had to sit up and take notice. Throw in a government weapons program gone horribly wrong, a flesh ripping monster run amok, and Michael Ironside in yet another turn as an evil dude--well, the bad movie lover in me began howling at the moon. Heck, the first film even had Jason Priestly torn to shreds by the aforementioned monster. What's not to love? Then came ""Watchers 2,"" a movie that once again introduced us to an intelligent dog and a monstrous entity, lots of cheesy kills, and the unforgettable sight of Marc Singer acting opposite the dog. Yay! Actually, the Beastmaster did a pretty good job keeping a straight face as the increasingly ridiculous plot unfolded. ""Watchers 3"" carries on this grand tradition of schlock by bringing in low budget megastar Wings Hauser to battle the fabled weapons project now run amok three times in a row. Incredibly, there is a ""Watchers 4"" I have yet to see. Rest assured I'll view that one as soon as possible.

""Watchers 3"" finds the satanic forces in the Pentagon up to their usual tricks. Not content with closing down a weapons program that resulted in untold deaths amongst the civilian population in the first two films, a gaggle of four star devils decides to reinitiate Project Aesop (as it's known in this film) in order to wreak havoc against a bunch of commie evildoers down in Central America. We see a bunch of Che Guevara wannabes sitting around a campfire sucking down a warm six pack of guava punch when a dog ambles into their midst. Awww! Isn't he a cute pooch! Even fellow travelers can't help but grin at the sight of a wagging tail. Unfortunately, this dog is the vanguard of Project Aesop, the smart dog that leads the deadly Outsider monster to its target. Sure enough, the grisly beast shows up a few minutes later and dispatches these Leninist stooges with extreme prejudice. The only survivors are the dog and a young boy (Ider Cifuentes Martin) who witnesses the horror but manages to not only hide but also keep the dog out of sight of the Outsider. You see, the Outsider follows the dog because his goal is to kill the dog and...oh, never mind. If you need an explanation just watch the first two movies. You're probably already familiar with the backstory if you're reading this review.

Anyway, the military wants Major Ferguson (Wings Hauser) to fly down to Central America and do something vaguely important...mop up operations or some such nonsense. Problem is, Ferguson is currently serving a stretch at Leavenworth and doesn't want to play nice. Predictably, the brass threatens him with an extended stay in the joint if he doesn't go. How he can refuse after that? Off goes Hauser with a team of ""Dirty Dozen"" type miscreants. There's obligatory black guy Nat (Daryl Roach), Vietnam veteran and all around jerk Bonetti (Gregory Scott Cummins), first to die MacCready (John K. Linton), and a curvy Latina guide named Gomez (Lolita Ronalds). The obvious group tensions pop up almost immediately, mostly bad tempers and endless hitting on Gomez, and then nothing much happens. These guys stomp around in the jungle for what feels like an eternity before stumbling over the boy and the smart dog. Ferguson, who was intimately involved in the Aesop project during one of its previous incarnations, immediately recognizes the pooch and just as immediately realizes the team is in real big trouble. The government has obviously set them up, and the rest of the film is a fight for survival against the relentless Outsider. Yawn.

""Watchers 3"" screams ""Predator"" ripoff. The Latina guide, a military team fighting a monstrous entity in the deep jungle--it's all here. Except for, of course, Arnie, a big budget, and any charm the original ""Predator"" had. This is cheap, straight to video schlock without an ounce of originality. Wings Hauser is probably the best thing the movie has going for it, outside of the charming dog, and even he often has a look in his eyes like he's wondering whether the paycheck cleared at the bank. The supporting cast appropriately supports Hauser and the dog with as much personality as the concrete pylons supporting a raised freeway. They're only in the picture to act as cannon fodder and to pick up an easy screen credit, and they know it. My biggest problem with ""Watchers 3"" wasn't the lousy special effects--you'll find yourself looking for the zipper on the Outsider creature--nor did it have anything to do with the gore (which is quite good). Nope, I had problems with the plot holes, holes that were so huge you could feel your body jounce as the movie rolled over them. For example, why send Ferguson and the team to fight the Outsider when all the brass wanted to do was rid themselves of the one man who knew about the project outside of themselves? Why not just stage a helicopter crash over the ocean and be done with it? For that matter, why not have someone stick a shiv into Ferguson in prison? Because the script said so.

From the trailers included on the DVD, I'm assuming ""Watchers 3"" came from the company owned by the venerable Roger Corman. Previews for ""Humanoids From the Deep,"" ""Watchers 3,"" ""The Unborn II,"" and ""Not of this Earth"" provide a welcome respite after suffering through this Predator knockoff. Seriously, if you like cheesy films you'll probably want to give this one a watch. Too, Wings Hauser completists (Is there such a thing?) will want to add this one to the stack.",1112140800,11,5611,4.769547325102881
