2054624,3,B0002234QI,"Clever use of ex-convict as main character trying to come up with a plan to squeak through a series of criminal misfortune.  Decent story line, good solid performance by the players, strong use of lesser known players to carry the flick.  I'd recommend it if you enjoy a good plot.",1103932800,3,281,4.6

8020121,3,B0002234QI,This movie is mainly a chararcter study but pushes the boundary on sexual material.  The movie is OK for a low budget film.,1367107200,,123,4.3478260869565215
8020122,5,B0002234QI,"This is underhanded meets underhanded. This movie has alot of twists and turns to it and the plot is solid. BTW, Dominic Purcell is a god. This guy is drop dead georgous and deserves to be watched in any movie that he is in. He spends alot of the movie without a shirt showing his nicely built chest. In this movie he plays a very innocent but underhanded guy that is very decieved by everyone in his life. When you watch this movie, you think that it is a ""run of the mill"" kidnapper movie. At the end, you are thinking...""wow...I thought I knew what this movie was about but I really didn't."" See this movie, you won't be disappointed. I hightly recommend it to anyone that is a Dominic Purcell fan and likes movies with alot of twists and turns.",1170547200,5,748,4.3120567375886525
8020123,5,B0002234QI,"Why people hate this movie so much, I will probably never figure out...But, really, it's pretty damn good. I'm a big ""Prison Break"" fan and this movie caught my attention because Dominic Purcell is on the cover and I decided to see what he's played outside of ""PB"". Turns out, he's virtually playing the same character pre-Prison, except you won't find Michael Scofield anywhere here. The movie is based on an old book that I've never read, so this review is based solely on the film and is not compared to anything. First of all, the title isn't referring to sex...It's referring to the deceit in the film that seems to go three ways (or more). Just to get that out there, anyways Purcell plays

Lew; After his wife leaves him for another man, Lew decides to kill her onboard her boat. He (apparently) decides not to and we flash forward to 8 months later. At this point, Lew is dating a girl named Rita (Joy Bryant, London) and works at making signs for various businesses. One night, he sees a car in a darkened area next to the highway...Out of curiosity, Lew investigates and overhears a conversation between Ralph (Desmond Harrington) and Isobel (Ali Larter, Final Destination). Ralph is planning on kidnapping his wife Florence (Gina Gershon), getting the reward money from her mother, killing Florence, and then spending time with Isobel. The ransom is one million dollars. As Lew investigates further and decides that he'll cut himself in things are looking good...And then things get complicated. A guy named Herbert Clarkson (Dwight Yoakam), the brother of Lew's ex-wifes lover shows up with Lew's gun (he left it at the boat) and demands that Lew show him where the body of his brother is. The movie takes a few twists & turns, which are pretty much simalar to ""Wild Things"" minus any lesbian pool kissing, and turns out to be a pretty entertaining and upredictable film. Everytime I thought I had it figured out, I didn't. Don't get me wrong, it's not a masterpiece and I should've seen the twists coming but every character in this film decieves or is decieved and at some point, even the audience is decieved. This movie deserves more credit than people place upon it and let's face it...Ali Larter is kind of hot. The cast is solid, the movie's entertaining in the same way ""Wild Things"" & ""Cruel Intentions"" was. It might not be Oscar worthy, but it's still worth checking out.

GRADE: A-",1148947200,13,2405,4.710213776722091
8020124,3,B0002234QI,"It's about 3 parties of people with agendas screwing each other over. There's a very Gratuitous Sex Scene, a kidnapping, a psycho, etc... but somehow it fails to gel. It's really not bad, it's just.... not good either. It tries very, very hard to be True Romance (with a smarter, tougher girl) but misses.

It's sort of sweet, but also sort of obvious. And I HATE the lame title.

Upside? Joy Bryant acts her socks (and pretty much every thing else, in the aforementioned GSS) off  - she's good. Dominic Purcel is as adorable as always. The two dumb kidnappers are excellent, the psycho is terrific, they're all pretty much brilliant. I wish I could put my finger on why this movie didn't do it for me. Oh well.",1147564800,10,711,4.496124031007752
8020125,1,B0002234QI,"I think this is the worst movie I have ever seen! And confusing too! The are a lot of bad flash backs, and fast-fast forward scenes of boats tied up in a dock, with the sun coming up or down.

Lew(Dominic Purcell) is laughable as a sign painter.

There is actually a scene where he is bent double hammering over his head on to a sign he's working on, that is down on the ground and half burried in the dusty dirt! You can tell he dosen't have a clue to what he is doing!

Then after he finds out about the planned kidnapping, he is supposly sneeking, and peeking around bushes. Like a man of Purcell's size(he's 6'1""or so, and wieghs about 200 pounds) can sneek around in someone's front yard and not be seen?  Come on! I kept waiting for someone to call 911 to report a peeking Tom!

I have to warn you that there are a lot of sex scenes!  Bad ones at that! I guess the director wanted to get them over with-real fast-to move on to the next badly written scene!

At least you get to see Dominic Purcells nude butt! Which maybe the only reason to see this movie, if you like that sort of thing!

And Purcell gets beaten up alot-by everyone in this movie. I kept thinking 'come on Purcell your a big guy, you can take that little guy!' And worse a woman beats him up too!

I saw this listed as a comedy, well maybe a comedy of errors!

While being intervied Dominic Purcell dosen't even mention this movie, when he lists all the movies that he has been-in.

And that should say something about this movie, if the guy who starred in it, would NOT even SAY he'd been in it!",1128124800,3,1570,4.148514851485149
8020126,1,B0002234QI,"I give 1 star for Ali Larter who always look very pretty, but she's far to be a good actress, she tries to be seductress but she doesn't get it. However she's worth a look in the movie. The movie it's really bad and you see they didn't had enough resources to make it good, the director uses many POV's of the characters. That makes things difficult to follow the story for the audience. They used many nudity in the movie so they can attract people, bad resource to attact the attention of the movie. Not the best movie I've ever seen.",1108771200,4,536,4.264705882352941
8020127,1,B0002234QI,"SO, here again!  This is just another Columbia Tristar's straght-to-video film, which, if you know what I mean, a pretty bad sign.  However, if you see such names as Gena Gershon and Dwight Yoakam, you might hope this is something better than usual trashes.  Sorry, '3 Way' is as bad as you can imagine, utterly thrill-free modern noir, which has no sense of suspence.  And Gena Gershon's role is a very small one!

The plot is based on one book of which title I forgot.  Anyway, it's about 'Lew' (Dominic Purcell), who happens to overhear the conversations about kidnap plans.  After identifying the would-be criminals, Lew thinks of intercepting all the money to himself.

Then, we are told that Lew has a girlfriend named Rita (Joy Bryant), who may or may not be a reliable partner in their own crime.  This not-so-exciting story gets more complicated by one quiet-mannered man Herbert, who thinks of different plans of getting easy money from Lew, whose unfaithful wife, I almost forgot to tell you, was supposed dead, or killed, which was shown in the pre-credit scenes.

Complicated, isn't it?  Or called it muddled if you like.  As this is a film noir, any complex plot can be excused as long as you get what you see in good noirs -- plots clever enough to be manipulating our (or the characters') minds, and convincing atomosphere.

But you get none of them.  For the film is hopelessly flat.  When the character finds out the owner of a car by stumbling upon the same bumper sticker at a shop (really), you should start to worry.  When the 'good memories about the life with my wife' are expressed with flashbacks showing a man and a woman running on the beach, both smiling and hugging each other, you better push the fast-forward button.

In addition to Purcell and Bryant, Ali Larter and Desmond Harrington appear, none of whom can save the mess.  And Ms. Gershon's role is so small that you might not notice that she is there.  And except Dwight Yoakam, who is a real professional and shows what a pro can do with cool, subdued performance, all the acting is what you can call blatantly mediocre, or simply bad.

My advice: don't watch.  Don't even think about renting either.",1104624000,5,2189,4.663185378590079
