8482532,5,B000006PRT,"This video is one of the more interesting films to be produced about the
Swiss rail lines. It shows one of the last Rhaetian Railway co. lines to
be built in southeast Switzerland, in the early 1900's. The video starts
with several sequences of ski competitions held annually in St. Moritz. Two of these are horse-drawn, no less. Later we see some of the early electric engines used on this line, as well as 2 1940's ""baby crocs"" that were used until recently. At one point a moderate amount of footage is shown of an early 1900's train, powered by a steam engine. This train
is still used on certain special occasions. One of the more interesting
sequences shows this steam engine being manually rotated on a turntable
by several men, as it weighs many tons. Another unique sequence shows the
current methods used in excavating a long tunnel, to be incorporated into
this line. The video ends with some footage of spas in the Scuol-Tarasp
area.",1237939200,,945,4.664670658682635
