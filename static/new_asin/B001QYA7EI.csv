8336855,4,B001QYA7EI,"My husband had recorded newscast from the moon landing as it happened. These are on reel to reel tape and no one has a player anymore. He will keep them, but can no longer play them. He was sad, until I mentioned that he could probably get copies of the newscast on DVD. He was very pleased with this set, which exceeded what he had originally had.",1402531200,,348,4.208955223880597
8336856,4,B001QYA7EI,"The main program (labelled as ""Apollo 11"" on the menu of disc one) includes excerpts from the news coverage of the Gemini and Apollo missions by Walter Cronkite/CBS.  The rest of disc one and almost all of disc two contains NASA films about the Gemini and Apollo missions.  On the whole, the two discs provided a nice overview of the manned exploration of the moon as well as of the Gemini flights which built up the spaceflight knowledge required to make it possible.  Walter Cronkite's enthusiasm for the subject matter is contagious!

CRITICISMS: The DVD set's main feature (the CBS coverage of the various space missions) could have been much longer and more in-depth.  Also, the transfers of the NASA films were a bit faded and muddy-looking (I cannot help but wonder whether or not there are better copies of those NASA films available).  Finally, my Samsung DVD player would not play disc one at all (I have owned that player since 2001; and, it plays virtually every other commercially-recorded DVD that I have purchased; so, not playing disc one of this DVD set was an unusual case.  Fortunately, I was able to play disc one on a Magnavox DVD player that I owned).

It would have been nice if the DVD set had included a disc containing an unedited recording of the live CBS coverage from the Apollo 11 mission..... everything from the launch to the walk on the lunar surface.  While the highlights on disc one were great, it would have been nice to have been able to relive parts of the Apollo 11 mission in real time, including all of Walter Cronkite's reactions to the various events.

If anyone is interested in seeing the Apollo 11 mission covered in more detail, I would strongly recommend the DVD,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apollo-11-A-Night-to-Remember/dp/B001O4C6K8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apollo 11: A Night to Remember</a>&nbsp;(this other DVD includes the BBC's news coverage of Apollo 11).

Some people criticized the inclusion of the old NASA films.  Personally, I found the NASA films enjoyable to watch.

On the whole, this is a nice DVD set, which is a ""must have"" for space enthusiasts.",1391040000,,2164,5.0790960451977405
8336857,5,B001QYA7EI,"This 40th anniversary, 2 disc, almost 5 hour compendium of the actual CBS TV Broadcasts (and other material) is a must for all who are interested in finding out about (or re-living) the early days of the space race and how it led us to be the first to get to the moon.  Some of the video was 'state of the art' for its time but, of course, it's not technically what we are used to today.  Even with the crude images, it's still easy to be thrilled seeing the now legendary astronauts  who had 'the right stuff' and who risked much to take NASA's  first steps in space exploration.  Walter Cronkite is on hand to guide the viewer through it all.  This set should be in the video collection of every home.",1355356800,,703,4.2481203007518795
8336858,2,B001QYA7EI,"I greatly enjoyed seeing again (actually reliving) the CBS videotapes covering the Apollo moon program of years ago, and especially the legendary Walter Cronkite as it happened.  But that is about where my enjoyment of this set ended.  All the rest of the first disk, and all of the second was poor transfers of umpteenth-generation NASA films of the manned space program from Apollo onward.  I've seen better transfers to regular DVD of regular 8-mm. movie film than these were.  For a consistently clear visual history of the entire manned space program, get the Discovery Channel set, ""When We Left Earth"" on Blu-Ray, if you have a Blu-Ray player.  The Al Reinert film, ""For All Mankind"" went back to the ORIGINAL NASA films kept in cold storage in Houston to be excellently transferred, and this is also on Blu-Ray.

For seeing the CBS material from the Gemini and Apollo space programs again, I give the first program on the first disk five stars.  All of the rest of the material I give one star (and would give less if I could).  Averages out to two stars.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Man-on-the-Moon-with-Walter-Cronkite-2-DVD-Set/dp/B001QYA7EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Man on the Moon with Walter Cronkite - 2 DVD Set</a>",1274918400,2,1273,5.36180904522613
8336859,5,B001QYA7EI,"These videos are of high caliber. First of all, having Walter Cronkite as the host already gives it credibility. This video will appeal not only to baby boomers, but it would be of interest to ypung people who were not around in 1969.",1252713600,,234,4.465116279069767
8336860,5,B001QYA7EI,"I can't stop crying actually tonight. I was outside just now, looking up into the sky, thinking about where I was 40 years ago as man set foot and America on our moon. Actually did this thing that seemed unfathomable.  My parents woke me up...to see the walk that was such a step for all of us. Why I'm crying, of course, is recalling Cronkite and his enthusiasm and warmth reporting with such sheer joy the technological and scientific work that NASA put into this amazing mission. Ok I'm crying because he died.
I'm going to break my vow to stop buying and get this for my family.
We just watched a program on TV tonight. More than just this story it told the life and work of Walter Cronkite. I am just shedding the tears for the days gone by. What an amazing time, and this set is something very special, I cannot wait. Sorry it's not a better review when it comes I'll rewatch all of it and put in all the things the show deserves..",1248048000,2,937,4.264044943820225
