4118498,5,B003FBO6N8,"I really enjoyed this video collection of  Muecas de la mafia Part 1, (El comienzo) and I have already ordered Part 2, ( El final). This soap opera is fast moving, the acting is very good and the filming very professional.  It helps to have a command of the  Spanish language and maybe some ""Paisa "" friends to help with some of the regionalisms due to the lack of subtitles (in the edition I purchased).  Unlike movies with poorly  translated English subtitles that cannot be disabled,  here there is no loss of linguistic realism of the Antioqueo drug culture being portrayed.",1301356800,2,578,4.673267326732673

4118504,5,B003FBO6N8,"A good series to watch and the story is very interesting because this really happened in real life that these Columbian drug lords had these beautiful women and that is why they made these series so entertaining for the public, like also El Cartel and El Cartel 2 as the seor de los cielos season 1 and season 2 and coming soon season3.",1427673600,,336,4.349206349206349

Unfortunately, this set is missing almost 10 episodes and basically gives you a recap of the ending. If you have never watched it, its ok because you won't know what other parts you are missing.",1409702400,,327,4.377049180327869

4118522,5,B003FBO6N8,"Someone needs to add English sub-titles to this and a little Paisa-English dictionary to increase sales -  Americans would love this show, but you have to really Speak Spanish / Paisa to absorb it all.  Colombia puts out another great show !",1391817600,,241,4.714285714285714

4118532,5,B003FBO6N8,"me encanta que no hay censura, no hay capitulos aburridos. y los discos vienen bien asegurados en el estuche, no como la temporada completa de King Of Queens, que vienen todos los discos amontonados y facilmente se pueden danar.",1361145600,2,228,4.871794871794871
4118533,5,B003FBO6N8,"I started watching this telenovela on Youtube but went on to get the DVDs to see all the action without connection issues. The story is similar to the Sopranos only in that it's a gangster drama. But, the Munecas de La Mafia (translation: Mafia Dolls) also has a lot of local Colombian color and flavor that makes it unique and hard to turn off. In some parts, the drama is so intense, I think I stopped breathing. The DVDs don't have subtitles and the actors have pronounced Colombian accents (some more than others), so if you don't at least understand some Spanish, the story may be hard to follow.",1357862400,,601,4.522935779816514
4118534,4,B003FBO6N8,"Me super encanta esta serie.  Lo unico malo de estos dvds esque no esta completa.

Asi que por eso esque no le pongo 5 estrellas porke no esta completa.",1343260800,3,285,3.9649122807017543

4118536,5,B003FBO6N8,"The Sopranos was great TV soap. This is a Spanish version in similarity through content. It is so true to life it's scary. The artistic quality of this Colombian effort is superb! I liked it more than the Sopranos, (although I'm a big time Soprano fan).",1335744000,,253,4.521739130434782
4118537,1,B003FBO6N8,I purchased this to try to learn spanish. I says it has subtitles and so did a review I read about it. But unfortunately there was no subtitles. I gave it 1 star because it was misleading.,1334534400,,188,4.108108108108108

4118539,5,B003FBO6N8,"This series has good acting, and the right mixture of humor, romance, and action. If you do not need subtitles, both disco collections of La muecas de la mafia, are worth purchasing.",1328054400,,182,4.71875
4118540,5,B003FBO6N8,Just as expected. Grate movie hard to find in other sites but nite here. Got movie sooner than expected. I was so happy.,1325462400,,120,4.260869565217392
4118541,5,B003FBO6N8,These women did an outstanding job in their field. Their acting was extraordinary. It left me with feelings of mixed emotions to what these women went thru. It was very interesting. This also showed the mistakes these young women made in their choices. Perhaps to all those young women out there even contemplating going this route will think  it over twice.,1308182400,,358,4.868852459016393
4118542,5,B003FBO6N8,"This dvd set (this part and part 2) are unusual, in that they present just about the entire telenovela, not just a heavily edited version that is usually sold for these stories.  I saw this novela when it originally aired, and I liked it even more the second time around, because 1) this version is uncensored making it more like PG-13 than the original highly censored version shown on TV, and 2) my Spanish is better now, so I understood almost everything (there are no subtitles).  The five young ladies who play the mafia ""dolls"" each have different personalites.  They're all gorgeous, of course, but they all want different things from life.  Some want money and power, some love, some just to survive.  Most of the druglords they encounter are cruel, macho types.  But none are cardboard characters.  Each of the druglords is different, too.  We also get to meet their families, making it a little bit like The Sopranos.  Without giving much away, you can imagine that the show doesn't end with a great big wedding, as do many telenovelas.  But this very difference makes it much deeper, more fascinating, more exciting.  If your Spanish is good, this is a fantastic set of discs (definitely get both parts).",1305072000,6,1215,4.76555023923445
