4893346,3,B005TZFZ5Q,"I knew something was odd when the rental download was completed and it registered just a bit over one hour in length. Had no idea this was a speciality production, created as part of an anthology that was viewable via the web. It plays however, much in the vein as a made-for-tv movie.

Not that that would be a deterrence, excellence in tv movies is not uncommon. Especially given that, in addition to taking on the lead role, this was also produced by Keifer.

However, that bona fides aside, 'Confession' is not a particularly novel idea. I've screened several productions over the years where the characters argue 'good' versus 'evil' and the true nature of humanity. And I've even seen it in this very configuration, utilizing an assassin and a priest.

But it's Keifer Sutherland wielding the weapon, and that carries a much greater impact, a depth of interest given his performance over the past decade as his tv alter-ego,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jack-Bauer/dp/B0044E9JU0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jack Bauer</a>.

The film opens as the assassin enters a confessional on Christmas Eve. He confronts the priest there, telling him that they are going to debate the qualities of God and man's inhumanity -or- someone will die that very night. He's deadly serious.

Again, I've seen this before and the plot is not particularly creative. But given the strong performances by both Sutherland and co-star John Hurt, it was engaging enough for the full hour.",1329004800,8,1511,5.331932773109243

4893368,1,B005TZFZ5Q,"Horrendous movie.  Keifer you rock in 24 but stick to TV okay?  Spoiler alert (or rental savings however you want to see it): Keifer's father is the priest who he goes to see in the confessional.  His father didn't treat him very well growing up so he goes in there with the intent to kill him if the priest doesn't give a hearty I'm sorry to Keifer.

Hey Keifer ever hear of something called forgiveness?  Odd that you're in a Catholic church confessional which is all about the penitent heart yet you brought a gun.  Way to go buddy.  Back to CCD class for you!

Get real.  And stop smearing the Catholic church.  There's an ocean's worth of guilt to go around in this world and the Catholic church is a part of that, not the sole purveyor of it.  The world is full of people who do/have done horrible things.",1406592000,,811,4.304635761589404

4893372,5,B005TZFZ5Q,"I am not a professional review writer by any means, but after watching The Confession, I feel like I have to write something.  The dialog alone grasped my attention from the get-go.  John Hurt and Kiefer Sutherland were amazing!!  I have seen a few of Kiefer's older movies, and of course Jack Bauer is my American Hero, but nothing I have seen compares to this.  My only complaint is that it is too short.  I could have listened to the dialog between these two for hours.  Kiefer has had roles stemming from the bad guy to downright evil, but this is a whole new level but I personally find this role to be a loveable ""bad"" guy.  Even from the beginning I was rooting for him.  I was clearly able to see his thought process in each scene, and Kiefer played it so well, that I was simply fascinated.  Amazing!!!",1403481600,,811,4.3533333333333335
4893373,5,B005TZFZ5Q,"This entire web series clocks in at just barely over an hour. By the end of that hour, I felt like I had just sat through an entire feature film and was clamouring for more. Sutherland and Hurt both turn in powerful performance as a hitman for hire and a Catholic Priest with his own closet of skeletons.

While the debate philosophical issues revolving around good and evil, the viewers get to see defining moments from Sutherland's past. While often quite visceral, there is no denying that very best scenes are those that take place inside the confessional with only Hurt, Sutherland and the divider. The dialogue is crisp and the emotional intensity is in overdrive.",1402185600,,670,4.775862068965517

4893387,5,B005TZFZ5Q,"An extremely well written and performed production. A ""whydoneit"" instead of a ""whodoneit."" Forces the thoughtful among us to do a morality check. Can wrong be right?? Why?",1391558400,,172,5.178571428571429
4893388,4,B005TZFZ5Q,"With a short running time that barely exceeds one hour, The Confession looks like a pilot episode of a cancelled TV show at first sight. The fact is that The Confession is a webseries, or mini-series exclusively made for the internet, that premiered online on March 28, 2011.

Kiefer Sutherland plays a mysterious visitor to a church, where he confesses that he has just killed a man. John Hurt is a priest who listens to the strangers confession. In flashbacks we see what Kiefer Sutherlands character did, and by the time the film ends, we also learn why the stranger insists that the priest should listen to his stories.

Because considerable portion of the story takes place in a confessional, where the two main characters exchange philosophical dialogue about morality, The Confession (divided into ten chapters) feels like watching a stage play.

Both leading stars turn in credible acting performance, but some may think 60 odd minutes are too short for us to get to know their characters, with a resolution that feels slightly incomplete. Maybe I felt so because I am too much accustomed to conventional film/TV format. Keep in mind that this is originally created for a new type of media, and you may enjoy it.",1391385600,,1220,4.855769230769231

4893400,5,B005TZFZ5Q,"I have watched The Confession several times and it is an equisite portrayal of the things that torment men's souls.  I do not want to give away the dramatic conclusion to the story, but this film shows how two lives come together and then are forever changed by life events.  One man struggles to understand the seeds of evil that have taken root and flourished in his soul and the other struggles to cast the seeds of evil from his life by embracing God.  If you ever enjoyed Keifer Sutherland in the hit TV show 24 you will understand how adept this actor is at showing the darker side of the human psyche.  Wow!!  This movie is like watching a train wreck in slow motion.  You know the crash is coming and that there will be vast destruction, but you just can't avert your eyes.  You are compelled to see the story through to its climatic end.  See this film.  It is one you will talk about for many weeks.  It is extremely thought provoking, and will spark many a discussion concerning good, evil, retribution, and restitution. Worth every penny!!",1349049600,5,1051,4.484210526315789

4893402,5,B005TZFZ5Q,"The confession will surprise you due its intense originality. Sutherland is a mercenary who suddenly decides to make a confession. A dark past, a serious religious conflict in which the free will is the common denominator, a suspenseful script will hold to your seat.

John Hurt as the Priest, is terrific too. Don't miss this one! Recommended.",1346198400,7,344,5.035087719298246
