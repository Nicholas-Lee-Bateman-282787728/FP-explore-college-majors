1849261,5,B00008K7AY,"Our three year old daughter adores Veggie Tales, so we were intrigued by one of the latest installments from the amazing team at Big Idea Productions.  After so many offerings, this presentation is a nice, lightweight change of pace - lots of silliness and music!  Hannah sits through the entire show, singing along at the top of her lungs!
There are some unique and comical interpretations on such classic children's tunes as ""Zaccheus"" and ""Hole in the Bottom of the Sea,"" and a kooky, breathless rendering of ""Modern Major General,"" made famous by Gilbert and Sullivan.  And for those who desire original tunes, Lisa Vischer's ""My Day,"" sung by Junior Asparagus, is a pure-hearted tribute to God's eternal love.
In between the songs, there are cartoon shorts such as ""Lunch"" and ""Binky the Opera Singer,"" and they are all just as entertaining as the musical numbers.
Once again, Veggie Tales has achieved the delicate balance of delivering the message of faith with a gentle touch.  ""The Wonderful World of Auto-tainment"" has proven that children's viewing can be both charming and edifying at the same time.",1058313600,6,1111,4.989189189189189
1849262,3,B00008K7AY,"So laments Bob the Tomato at one point in this dvd. The problem is that he's absolutely correct. Never before in the history of the Veggietales series have they produced a complete bomb...until now. There's no plot to speak of, most of the between-songs moments are just plain dumb, and the entirety of the Bible lesson normally so prevelant in other entries in the series is summed up in the final song. This is absolutely nothing like any of the other dvds in the series (with the possible exception of the Silly Songs one...and even that one had a lot of funny moments in it). The only redeeming thing in this dvd is the shorts shown during the show. The ""Lunch"" short and the aardvark singing opera were hilarious, and I would have loved to have seen more of them. Don't judge the whole series by this one episode. Hey, they've been doing this for 10 years...they're bound to get bored and want to try something new every now and then, right?",1055721600,12,946,4.505813953488372
1849263,4,B00008K7AY,"Larry is sure that he and Bob will soon be passed over as children's show hosts because they are too low tech.  So, he works to create the future of entertainment.  Looks like the future involves robots telling randomly generated jokes and punch lines and random characters singing songs on random subjects.  Throw in a couple of random animated shorts, and you've got a show.  But is the future really going to hold together the way that real hosts do?
Adult fans of the series will be disappointed with the video.  While some of the dialog is funny, the majority of the program is animated songs from several of the CD's that the veggies have released over the last year or so.  Kids, on the other hand, will love having another sing-a-long video with the vegetables they actually like.  The only funny thing is, if they were going to do a sing-a-long, why not include the words?  Of course, for most kids that won't be a problem after a few viewings.
Anyone with kids will want to get this fun DVD with familiar songs because their kids will enjoy it.  And they'll get a chuckle or two from it themselves.  Adult fans may want to rent or borrow it since it won't hold up to repeated viewings for them like other releases from Big Idea.",1054598400,8,1238,4.4622222222222225
1849264,4,B00008K7AY,"This DVD reminds me a lot of the Ultimate Silly Songs DVD -- there are a lot of great songs (and this time they're NEW), but not much in the way of a plot or a message. It starts with a silly (of course) view of the future, where Larry is convinced that randomly-generated programming is the wave of the future. So we get a randomly-selected Veggie singing a randomly-selected song topic in a randomly-selected genre. The results are...well...random, with some hits and some misses.
The song list includes:
There's a Hole in the Bottom of the Sea (French Peas)
Zacchaeus (Pa Grape)
Modern Major General (Archie)
You are My Sunshine (Larry)
Erie Canal (Pa Grape)
My Day (Junior)
Some of these aren't original...well, other than My Day, none of them are original (and My Day was on a VeggieTales CD last year -- Junior's Bedtime Songs). But they're well-executed, with visual and aural humor throughout. The between-songs shtick is a little annoying, but delights our girls (ages 3 and 1.5).
There aren't any Bible stories (though the Zacchaeus song is itself a short one), and not a huge message (My Day is what passes for that -- God loves us even when things go bad), and not even all the traditional trappings of a VeggieTale (no visit to QWERTY at the end). Still, it's cute -- and it's a lot better entertainment for kids than some of what's out there! The songs are memorable and fun to sing(though Modern Major General may be more for listening to than singing...but the tune is stuck in my head after hearing it just a couple times).
Not a bad purchase, all considered, but I wish they'd let themselves stick with the formula that worked. I'm sure they get bored with it, but the kids don't seem to!",1053561600,13,1706,4.5967213114754095

1849281,1,B00008K7AY,"This was awful. My baby boy loves Veggie Tales!  When I turned this on, he paid rapt attention...until two minutes in when Larry was still doing his ""chicken head"" antics.  Kid was bored!  The concept was o-kay...but it was so bizarre.  No storyline to follow.  The songs were okay but the silly songs with Larry from other episodes are much better.  It's tough for a small child to grasp the concept and, even though I get it, I still didn't think it was funny.  Kinda lame.  A rare miss for Veggie Tales.  I'm going to take it back and exchange it for a better DVD.",1331078400,,567,4.3238095238095235
1849282,1,B00008K7AY,"I bought this DVD back when it first came out. I was a Veggie Tales fan back in high school and had to buy the latest releases. This was the one that had me stop buying them for many years. This DVD was released after Big Idea had gone bankrupt and was purchased by another company. It was obvious that there was something different about this movie. It was terrible! There is no plot, no lesson, no moral, and barely any biblical references. The only good part about this video is the song ""My Day"" by Junior Asparagus. It is a wonderful, innocent song that mentions God and deals with prayer. Overall, I think this movie is terrible and I'm sure they regret ever making it.

I now have a two year old who loves Veggie Tales and so I am very happy that they are back on track making quality Christian entertainment!",1326240000,,816,4.333333333333333

1849303,1,B00008K7AY,"This was definitely the worst VeggieTales movie I've ever seen (and I've seen most of them).  It wasn't like any of the other episodes/movies which would have been okay if it was enjoyable, but it was just plain weird.  I couldn't watch it with my daughter as it jumped around a lot.  I probably only got 1/2 way through it, but if this one had the usual VeggieTales lesson, it must have not come up until the end because everything I saw was random, disjointed, and not really funny.  I never understand why people who have a great idea and a good format feel like they have to change it.",1283385600,,589,4.327272727272727

Larry ""Yeah, the future has been white since the 70's""

The above dialoge is the funniest joke on the whole video.  Ok, it sounds cuter when the veggies do it.

By far this is not the best of Veggie Tales nor is it the norm.  Nonetheless, it really does not deserve some of the bad reviews.  No, it is not a Bible story, it is a hodge podge of story lines & songs (most with cute lyrics that most younger kids will enjoy or like me relive your childhood).  But that is the point.  Our daily lives are a hodge podge most days. Things go rarely as we plan, but at the end of the day, God still loves us.

Veggie fans will want this in their library. If you are new to the Veggie Tales world, try some other videos first; Snoodle's Tale, Minnesota Cuke, Lord of the Beans, etc.",1275264000,,810,4.082278481012659
1849306,5,B00008K7AY,"This is the most random Veggietales yet!  Some of the songs are not as entertaining as others, but I got a big kick out of the French Pea's song.  The flashing of random pictures was just too funny.

The moral of the story is a great one.  No matter what happens, God loves you.  It doesn't matter if nothing goes according to plan, or if things are just crazy.  God still loves us.",1232668800,4,382,4.164383561643835

1849308,2,B00008K7AY,"This is the strangest VeggieTales episode out there.  There is virtually nothing that could be considered a plot, the concept is bizarre, and the whole thing comes across as being plain ol' weird.  It seems like this was an excuse to showcase songs, and that the whole ""animation"" and ""storyline"" parts were afterthoughts.  That this video is ""autotainment"" can't really be argued with, but I would really take issue with the ""wonderful"" part...thank goodness most VeggieTales episodes are nothing like this one.",1173744000,4,512,5.219512195121951
1849309,5,B00008K7AY,". . . addition to the VeggieTales family.

Nope -- this one is not a Bible story or a classic tale humorously re-told.  It's just fun!  With Mr. Lunt (the ""techo-gourd of the future"") running a random song generator (Pa Grape singing about Biblical Dwarves or Archibald Asparagus singing about Military Intelligence) and two silly robots attempting vaudeville -- this VeggieTales video is not what you would expect.

But my family sure has gotten a kick out of it -- from the babies, up to the teens (and, frankly, the adults).

All KINDS of fun!

Highly Recommended!",1170633600,8,567,4.793814432989691
1849310,2,B00008K7AY,"They must have come up against a creative wall to put this one out.  Although my 5 y.o. likes to watch it occasionally, it usually sits on the shelf.  There's not really a story or plot, it's supposed to be the future of entertainment - randomly selected by computers.  The jokes aren't funny, although they're not really supposed to be, there are a few cute songs, but there's no message, no plot, no point really.",1155168000,4,415,4.506666666666667
1849311,1,B00008K7AY,"This DVD is so far out on left field I am not sure what to say about it.

This seems to be a secular video with the Veggie Tales added for flavor.  No Biblical references, no moral to the story..... nothing.

Spiritually speaking, there is nothing to help nourish the mind of your child.  You could get more from WB animaniacs than this video.  If you have bought just about every video Big Idea has made, and just can't seem to keep yourself from buying it.....  then just consider it a small financial loss and one that should be put WAY up on the shelf.",1153785600,8,556,4.247619047619048
1849312,4,B00008K7AY,"No, it's not as good as ""Lyle,"" ""Rack, Shack and Benny,"" ""Little Joe"" or most of the other VeggieTale movies.  But, my three year old son asks for the ""VeggieTale robot movie"" (as he calls it) over and over again.  And while there is no plot to follow, it does have some fun little diddies in it.  I love the VT versions of  ""Major Modern General"" and ""Hole in the Sea"" and most especially ""You are my Sunshine.""  This shouldn't be your first or only VT movie, but is a nice addition to a VT library.",1145836800,2,500,4.166666666666667
1849313,3,B00008K7AY,"It's clear from most of the reviews that ""The Wonderful World of Auto-tainment"" is easily the least of the VeggieTales videos available.  Sadly, I must agree.  Yes, there is some mildly amusing material here, but it is intentionally different from the rest of the VT canon.  My almost 3-year-old son liked a couple of bits, but nothing like his excitement over, say, the dumbwaiter scene in ""The Star of Christmas.""

The problems with the show are easily explained if you are willing to listen to the audio commentary from the production crew.  For one, this video was produced in a very short period of time -- a total of 12 weeks from start to finish, which for this kind of show is insane.  Second, the intent was to animate some of the songs that had appeared exclusively on the VT soundtracks that had been produced over the years.  The plotline, as bizarre as it is, was created almost solely to link together random songs.  The creators admit this freely on the commentary, and it explains just why this one appears so disjointed.

What's interesting to me as a seminary student is that the ""world of the future"" and the randomness of it all seems in some way to be a jab at the whole postmodern movement that American Christianity is trying to embrace.  The show has virtually no Truth (with a capital T) on display until the last song when Bob takes over and has Junior sing a song where he talks over his day with God.  (It's actually a sweetly moving song nearly worth the cost just to see.)  The world of the future seems to have no point, no real truth but what we make of it...and it's seen as a pretty ridiculous place.  Is it a commentary on postmodernism and the church?  Unlikely, but it's certainly possible.

However, who's going to notice this concept?  Certainly not 3-year-olds, and almost certainly not their parents.  VeggieTales has never really been a commentary on society but a fun way for parents to introduce children to biblical stories.  This one has a little bit of fun once you get past its jarring nature, but nowhere near the message or goofy humor of ""Rack, Shack, and Benny"" or ""The Ballad of Little Joe.""",1139616000,2,2144,4.582677165354331
1849314,5,B00008K7AY,"A fun collection of songs as Larry attempts to bring the future into the world of show hosting. And in Larry's eyes the future is random, automated, and, er, white.

Each singing veggie is based off a song that was on an earlier audio CD but because we are dealing with Larry it gets different. However the songs are a good mix of silly, funny, and inspirational.

To the best of my knowledge the only song off this episode to appear in another DVD is the Erie Canal song which shows up in Veg-O-Rama.

The sound and video quality is very good and I don't think you can get this on VHS. You won't be disappointed you bought this one though.",1128470400,,640,4.2727272727272725
1849315,3,B00008K7AY,"As the other reviewers have said, this was different from the standard Veggie format.  There is a lot of singing from randomly selected characters, but the songs are more like silly songs than songs that have any lesson to them.  The movie was fun to watch, but not really a need-to-buy, as I can't imagine watching it over again.  The songs are fun though but a warning: they are catchy and tend to get stuck in my head!  If you go in watching this not expecting it to be a Veggietales story then it might be better.  Different isn't always bad, but it is well... different.",1121299200,,575,4.386792452830188
1849316,5,B00008K7AY,This is my son's (18 mos) favorite Veggie Tales video.  It is more of a musical video rather than a story telling video.  The songs are very catchy!  If you like music and Veggie tales you will like this video!,1117584000,,210,4.2
1849317,3,B00008K7AY,"""Eh, it coulda been woise.""  ""Larry's World of Auto-tainment"" is a different sort of a veggie-tales video.  It doesn't present a story, but rather an over-plot of Larry's view of the future, where humor is generated randomly for maximum suprise value (and minimum logic).  Being Larry's vision, it naturally goes screwy, with humorous results.
The main thrust of the show is songs done by ""randomly selected"" characters on ""randomly selected"" topics.  As a result, we get to hear the French peas singing ""There's a hole in the Bottom of the Sea,"" and Pa Grape singing, ""Erie Canal"" among others.  One gets the sense that the video was made purely for entertainment purposes.  Now, a veggie tales that just tries to entertain isn't necessarily a bad thing (my family has practically worn out our copy of ""Ultimate Silly Songs Countdown."")
Unfortunately, the writers try to stick in lessons that just don't work.  For example there is a short called ""Lunch"" that illustrates a lesson against greed in a way kids can relate to.  They also include a quote from ""John,"" the only scripture in the episode.  Unfortunately, ""Lunch"" is a silent short with non-veggie characters.  It seems so out of place it is jarring rather than enlightening.
At the end, Junior Asparagas sings a song about God loving him no matter what.  This is a good lesson, one that deserves to be the subject of a full video.  As it is in ""Auto-tainment,"" it feels tacked on as an afterthought.
In short, buy this video expecting to be entertained with a good presentation of kid songs.  There may not be a proper lesson to discuss with your kids, but hey, there are lots of veggie-tales videos that provide that.",1088208000,4,1679,4.788194444444445
1849318,3,B00008K7AY,"I'm glad to see that Big Idea was trying something new with the Veggies because it's good to expand. But, even though it is different, it just doesn't seem like Veggie Tales.

The little plot of the tale goes like this: Larry takes Bob into the future to show him what the future of entertainment is going to be like. It's a world where people watch auto-tainment, no thinking or feeling required. A couple of robots tell some jokes where the punch line doesn't match up and they pull a lever on a rotating machine that randomly selects a Veggie to sing a song. The sidekick robot starts to act strange and seems to start putting together non-random humor and possibly displays feelings. The tale ends with a message of love, how much God loves us. It's all about love.

Some of the songs were really entertaining. I also enjoyed the robot puppet idea. However, out of all the Veggie Tales, this is by far my least favorite. This tale is what happens when the Veggies try post-modernism and is a great example of all that's wrong in our post-modern society. In that sense, the tale is great. However, as a good old fashioned story with some fun songs, it just doesn't work because there really isn't much of a story. Also, where all the other Veggie Tales have been based on scripture (usually ending with a verse from Quirky), this one has no scripture.

Overall, an interesting attempt at something different and younger children will probably enjoy watching it. However, it's not as educational or entertaining as the other Veggie Tales and kids will probably become bored with it rather quickly. It's all auto-tainment.",1075939200,,1623,4.687719298245614
1849319,2,B00008K7AY,I was a bit disappointed with this episode.  It is just several music videos with Bob and Larry as M.C.'s presenting the videos.  Kids may like it though.,1065484800,3,154,4.464285714285714
1849320,5,B00008K7AY,"To a degree I can understand the ire of some of the reviewers' postings here.  This video is definitely a stylistic departure from the more story-driven VT productions.  It took me some getting used to (I'm slower to adapt than my twin three-year-olds, who requested it every night for a week), but I am glad I gave it a few views before making up my mind on it.  It has become one of my favorites.
Although the content draws less from biblical content than many VT videos, I think the headline lesson (unconditional love) warranted this approach.  I also found the satirical elements (lost on me in the first several viewings but more apparent thereafter) made this video stand up well to the kind of repetitive viewing my household demographic seems to demand.
I found the production quality of this video truly stunning;  all of the songs are also terrific.  Junior Asparagus' ""My Day"" alone is well worth the admission price.
I'm giving it 5 stars, and also recommending that you view it a couple of times before making up your mind on it.",1064361600,13,1043,4.641304347826087
1849321,2,B00008K7AY,"Short Take:
If you want an engaging, secular sing-along video, look over the various videos by The Wiggles. If you're looking for the usual Biblically-based stories and songs by Big Idea, try any of the other VeggieTales videos. This video gives the impression that Big Idea is trying to go more ""mainstream"" and it suffers badly for the effort. If you are already a VeggieTales fan, my recommendation is to avoid this video and rent it only if you must. If this would be your introduction to the VeggieTales characters, please seriously consider one of their other videos before this one.

In this hysterical production, Bob and Larry lead us on their quirky exploration of how to be entertaining, in a new, Modern Style.  Personally, I find it both amusing and comforting to see the struggles of many of our favorite, sweet Veggie Characters as they make valiant efforts to cope with some of the less than comfortable issues associated with Modernization.  And similarly, it seems somehow, both reassuring and just plain funny to observe the juxtaposition of ""familiar"" (mores--habits/morals/manners), with that which is ""distinctly bizarre.""

Ultimately, I expect to replay this DVD rather often because just below its surface -- a producer of belly-shaking laughter, there lies a rather thought-provoking layer of substance!  The writers and performers seem to be people I would welcome into my home for a dinner party.

All in all, I am exceedingly happy to have added ""THE WONDERFUL WORLD of AUTO-TAINMENT"" to my Home Video Library.  I expect to amaze and amuse not a few friends by screening this wonderfully wacky parody of ""those who are so very concerned with being up-to-the-minute/modern.""
