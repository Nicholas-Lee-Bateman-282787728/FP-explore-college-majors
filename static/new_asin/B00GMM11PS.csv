8624638,3,B00GMM11PS,"I very much enjoyed this video, the repertoire, and I enjoy watching Szell conduct.  However, like so many other classical DVDs, the soundtrack is noticeably out of synch with video.  I watched or rather listened to the whole thing first from beginning to end, not watching too closely because of the synch problem.

The next viewing I watched only the Mozart and carefully tweaked the delay box, finding the sound is approximately 260 milliseconds ahead of video.  I spot-checked the Walton and Bruckner and they do NOT appear to be the same.  I attribute this to possibly being from a different broadcast, or who knows, temperature of the room, or more likely the vagaries of the vagrants controlling the sound booth???

I shall update this review periodically in case anyone is interested in my readings on the other pieces as I get to them ...

Now, why such a high rating as three stars?  Why do I fuss with it at all, when sound and picture are out of synch?  Why don't I just return it with a few specially chosen expletives?  Well, I bought the sound delay box for a reason, it is for DVDs like this.  Sure, I could send it back.  But this one is worth tweaking if it can be tweaked.  I really like the repertoire, and I don't have a single decent DVD of Szell conducting.  Picture and sound quality are good also (I mean, as good as can be expected for TV broadcast of the era).

So it is recommended only if you have a digital sound delay box with increments down to 1 ms ......",1482883200,,1488,4.419117647058823
8624639,4,B00GMM11PS,"Szell was an outstanding Brucknerian, and sadly extant recordings of his Bruckner, studio-made or taken live at concerts, are of but a couple of the comploser's symphonies. As a colleague has commented sufficiently in this site on the Walton and Mozart works that fill up this dvd, I'll stick to the Bruckner.

Of course he recorded Bruckner's 3rd Symphony in the studio in Cleveland, but although his overall conception of the work seems not to vary signifficantly, there's an important difference in orchestral playing. By the mid-1960's orchestral playing styles still differed importantly, and Szell's Bruckner could sound quite differently when played by American or European orchestras. American orchestras, with their aim at virtuosity and brilliance, had a difficult time playing tenuto, which came as second nature to their viennese, german or dutch counterparts, to stick to the orchestras with which you may find cd's or dvd's of Bruckner's 3rd symphony conducted by Szell; recording location has little to do, the main difference is in the playing style and the sound that derived from it, even taking into consideration the european background of so many of the players still active by the 1960's in the orchestras of Cleveland, Chicago, New York City, Boston or Philadelphia. And that is why Szell's european recordings of Bruckner are significant, as over there he could get closer to this music's bones. Let's not forget he was Vienna-trained and worked closely with the Vienna Philharmonic before staying in the USA for good at the outbreak of the 1939 european war, it is safe to say this repertoire was in his dna.

In this concert Szell drew a fiery and dedicated playing from the Vienna Philharmonic that is less present in the studio recording the orchestra (and, one supposes, with largely the same players) made a handful of years later of the same work for Decca with Karl Bhm, another important brucknerian. So yes, the sound in this dvd may saturate in a few spots and could have been better (it is hard to know, though, whether the fault lies in the original video tape made by Austrian Radio & TV or in VAI's processing), but is it still in eminently decent and quite listeneable mono. You'll find this release noteworthy not only if you are a commited Szellian, or if you're interested in the history of conducting or in the history of orchestral styles and playing, you'll treasure this Bruckner 3rd if you like the work, plainly, as there a few performances that stand up and look at it in the eye.

So, why not five stars? Well, I reluctantly dropped it precisely because of the unremarkable mono sound.",1467504000,,2636,4.9324324324324325
8624640,5,B00GMM11PS,"While this DVD doe not fill in any holes in Szell's discography -- he recorded all of these pieces in studio with Cleveland -- it does provide a rare opportunity to watch Szell conduct, and conduct an orchestra that wasn't the Cleveland Orchestra.

It's also especially fitting the one of the performances captured on video is Walton's ""Hindemith Variations,"" and that Walton was present at this concert and called to stage to take a bow. The ""Variations"" was probably Szell's favorite contemporary piece of music. After he conducted it for the first time in Cleveland during the 62-63 season, he conducted it again in 4 out of the next 6 seasons. I doubt there are many other instances of a conductor programming a new piece of music season after season like it were a Beethoven symphony.

The interpretations of the three pieces on this DVD (also included are the Bruckner 3 and ""Eine Kleine Nachtmusik"") are not much different than the studio versions made with Cleveland (and they're a bit more polished thanks to being studio recordings).

Recorded sound is serviceable. The Walton and Mozart are from 12/68. While the sound is clear with a good bit of presence, there's a high pitched buzz throughout the performances. It's not that loud and becomes white noise after a little bit, but it is there. The Bruckner is from 6/66 and is coarser, with distortions -- most noticeable when the brass are playing loudly. The sound is unfortunately nowhere need as good as the quality of radio broadcast recordings from this era -- and ORF's tended to be pretty good.

In sum, this disc is for Szell fans -- they'll delight in getting to watch him conduct. For everyone else, stick with the Cleveland studio recordings of these pieces.",1388188800,9,1731,4.818181818181818
