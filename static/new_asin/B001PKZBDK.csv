8333642,5,B001PKZBDK,"This is a first-class film, deserving of 5 stars. See also Glawogger's films Workingman's Dead and Whore's Glory. I bought the DVD from this page, which is advertised as ""manufactured on demand"". That means it is actually a ""burned"" DVD-R rather than a ""factory-pressed"" DVD. A disturbing trend. But it was the cheapest way to get this film. I was disappointed to find no subtitles on the disc. The 12 stories in the film are in 4 different languages (Spanish, Russian, Hindi, English). It is worth seeing anyway, but there is no excuse for not including the subtitles when they were available from the source. The Amazon page for the European PAL DVD version indicates that it has English and German subtitles. I would have bought that one, if I had known this ""copy"" did not include the subtitles (also no menu or any other features). Note that most newer DVD players will play PAL as well as NTSC DVDs.",1408924800,,905,4.6625
8333643,1,B001PKZBDK,It appears to be in European format although I thought I selected otherwise.  Sadly I am unable to see what I purchased,1357171200,2,119,4.409090909090909
