The new 2014 re-issue of the Metropolitan Munich DVD set, previously issued as separate discs in 2013, now includes the important bonus film/interview from 2012 in which Barenboim explains in detail the concepts lying behind this entire presentation. This bonus film was previously only available on the Blu-ray set. The new re-issued DVD set therefore offers significantly more material on fewer discs and at a lower cost. It is therefore much better value than before and a closer match to the excellent, but more expensive, Blu-ray set.

The detailed review of the complete 2014 re-issued set can be read under the 2014 re-issue heading and replaces the previous review under this heading
