8085469,3,B000BD8PGC,"Wow! What a predictable story line.  A real yawner.  The acting was only mediocore.  If you're thinking of buying this movie because John Phillip Law is in it, don't bother.  He appears for about 60 seconds and that's it.  I wouldn't view this movie again.",1170028800,,256,4.6
