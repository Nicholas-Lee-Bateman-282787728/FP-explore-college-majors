8560846,5,B00B1HHLOE,"He does a good job in explaining what Gnosticism really is. And what is found in Dan Brown's book and movie isn't even close to what these people believed. Also, that  the Gnostics believed that Jesus was a type of god - not just a man - as Dan Brown says in his book. And that they thought he was a ""higher"" god than his father. He was an older more powerful god than Abba.",1509580800,,374,3.986666666666667

8560849,1,B00B1HHLOE,"Thank you for your comment. I was wondering if you could comment on Michael's general take that the original 4 gospels of the new testament predate & are referenced to by early scholars where the gnostic gospels are not and appear on the scene much later than the ""original"" four.
I would think that the reason for that would be simply because they were just that; discovered much later!
As well might a possible oral tradition have been in play?
Thank you !",1391385600,,458,4.530120481927711
8560850,1,B00B1HHLOE,"I returned this DVD because of the derisive, contemptuous discussion of what the narrator thinks is Gnosticism, a body of lore that warned in its own writings against taking sacred stories literally. It is impossible to declare that such people ""believe"" something  when they hold their own images as metaphoric.

There also some important inaccuracies. To mention just one, the narrator says that for the Gnostics, Eve had no spiritual spark and was therefore lower than Adam. However, in the ancient Gnostic text ""On the Origin of the World,"" Eve awakens Adam from his spiritual slumber. ""When he saw her, he said, 'You will be called 'the mother of the living,' because you are the one who gave me life.'"" In the ancient Gnostic ""Apocryphon of John,"" Eve tells him, ""I am the foreknowledge of pure light; I am the thought of the undefiled spirit...Arise and remember...and beware of the deep sleep."" The Gnostic texts refer to Eve as an emanation of aeons like Sophia and Barbelo, which means she is a direct bearer of spiritual light. The narrator makes no mention of any of this. The film is clearly meant as a disparagement of Gnosticism, as the remarks like ""I know this sounds weird"" indicate.",1387411200,4,1201,4.825242718446602
