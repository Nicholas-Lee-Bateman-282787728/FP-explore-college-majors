8457661,5,B00559ARHM,Just remember this movie will NOT play in a regular DVD player. A very interesting 'coming of age' movie,1466035200,,104,4.526315789473684
8457662,4,B00559ARHM,"I probably would have enjoyed the movie more if I were more familiar with the political and social background into which the movie is set. It is well directed and well acted, including the acting of the 12-year-old main character. The tension and air of mystery is well portrayed. The situations of the main characters are brutally honest and realistic as far as I can tell with my limited knowledge of the Catalan countryside in the postwar years.

This is a coming-of-age story for Andreu, but not from a sexual standpoint (although he does gain some sexual knowledge during the movie). Instead his coming-of-age is from the standpoint that he must mature and learn to accept reality for what it is and not rely on what he is told by his parents, relatives, teachers, and peers (which do not all agree with each other). In short he must learn to think for himself and standup for himself as the truth slowly comes out, and in this case truth includes, and is complicated by, deceit and conspiracy. And I might add that this truth goes far beyond the immediate problem of his father being accused of murder.

Since the movie follows Andreu and for the most part is seen from his prospective, the audience learns the truth and it complications along with Andreu.

As I mentioned in my heading the ""Extras"" on the disc do not have an English translation. I feel that this is especially unfortunate with respect to the ""Making of"" video. Watching it without understanding what is being said I am sure it would have been very interesting and informative if I had been able to understand it.

There is some brief nudity in the movie, a young man (probably in his early 20's) is seen running through the woods nude and then plainly while squatted and standing up by a stream. He is only seen clearly from the rear and side never from the front and the clear view lasts less than a minute. However there is another scene in which a man is held down and castrated, in this scene his genitals are clearly seen although the actual castration is not.

Also, very important, this DVD is in PAL format and therefore cannot be played on the standard U. S. DVD player, you must have a player which will play the PAL format.",1429574400,2,2209,4.554156171284634
8457663,3,B00559ARHM,a friend had recommended it. I thought it would be more directly about the Spanish Cvil War which it was not.,1395619200,,109,4.238095238095238
