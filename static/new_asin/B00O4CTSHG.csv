6708754,3,B00O4CTSHG,"Good fourth season but many scenes leave me wondering, that just doesn't make sense! Or asking myself; that wouldn't possibly happen in real life?
SPOILER ALERT! How probable is it for an Ex-CIA Director (Saul) to be in a hostile foreign country (Pakistan) where a CIA operative has savagely been beaten to death in Istanbul and yet moves about without a security detail? Which leads to his eventual unfortunate circumstance.
Or for Carrie who has been hiding her illness for years leaving her medication bottles out in plain view so that it readily can be found by anyone?
There are many other nonsensical twists and turns that I could site but I'll leave it up to you all to keep a watchful eye and question what where they thinking?",1420848000,32,735,4.705426356589148
6708755,1,B00O4CTSHG,"Great start but a very disappointing finish to the season.  Without giving anything away for those who have not yet watched it, this season focuses on American incompetence, Pakistani corruption and people making bad decisions under pressure.  It felt like a critique of America's policies in the Middle East and, as punishment, leaves the season on a low note without resolution and with the US having it's ass handed to it by the Taliban and Pakistani ISI.  Oh well, maybe next season we will see the bad guys get what they deserve.",1420156800,9,534,4.782608695652174

6708759,5,B00O4CTSHG,"I thought season 4 started off a little slow but by the third episode, I was hooked and can't wait for the next episode.  The ""in your face"" occurences just blow my mind.  After spending much time in the middle east and Afghanistan, I started reading up on Pakistan and the tightrope we walk to keep our access to the Kyber Pass.  Amazing, relevant, thought-provoking stuff and just great TV!",1418428800,56,392,4.571428571428571
6708760,4,B00O4CTSHG,"Great series, second or third only to Breaking Bad except for one thing that knocks it down several notches & cost it one star: I thought (along with many others I've spoken with) that Season 3 was REALLY poor. Whose brilliant idea was it to focus a plot thread on Brody's daughter and her lame misadventures?

And why did everyone throughout the series, including his wife, call him ""Brody"" instead of his first name, Nick? Very odd.

So I guess I'd say that Homeland is 75% great, because Season 4 rocks and it's almost making up for that raggedy-ass Season 3.

6708774,5,B00O4CTSHG,"I must say, this season took me by surprise. I was so bummed when Brody died in Season 3, however, I agree with all the other reviews that it would be hard to keep his character living without compromising the rawness of the show. Unlike other shows, what makes this show great is that you never know what will happen next and the writing is suspenseful and daring. If Brody did stay on, it would have lost it's edge. Carrie's character goes through so many transitions as do all the other characters.

6708799,4,B00O4CTSHG,"We began binge watching Homeland after someone recommended it to us.  It's the only show we have watched all summer!  We really enjoyed the first three seasons. The fourth is a little slower and the entire story line has changed. I am finding myself getting to know other characters - or should I say, trying to like other characters and missing some that are gone.  On the other hand, my husband is glad the old story line has changed and is ready for more plot twists and drama!  As many have said, the show is unrealistic, but it is tv.....so, I just go with it!  It's an easy watch and will keep you engaged. YES, it does support closed captioning. I saw another reviewer has said that it did not. It does.

6708816,3,B00O4CTSHG,"After the riveting first three seasons, I found this season disappointing and only watched 3 or 4 episodes. Carrie is just not fun to watch as a completely closed down ice queen. I don't find the political drama in Islamabad that interesting either. And as far as the personal stuff, I'm rather PO'd at Carrie's sister for laying such a guilt trip on her after it was she who practically insisted that Carrie have the baby she didn't want, saying she and their dad would take care of the baby. It also isn't true to character after being so caring and understanding previously. The writers left out any detailed negotiations about the future that the family might have had that would explain such a turnabout. But most of all, it's Carrie's total lack of emotion that is off-putting. Maybe she feels something further on in the season but I'm just not interested enough to slog through. I'm moving on to season 5, hoping there is a sea change.",1492128000,4,943,4.619047619047619

The only bad aspect of Homeland is that it accurately describes the evilness that motivates and accompanies this countrys ill-fated foreign policy.  Claire Danes is, as always, superb and is supported by an outstanding cast.  I am on my second viewing of the Homeland series to date and still find it as captivating as before.
LMW 3-24-17",1490313600,,384,4.984375
6708825,5,B00O4CTSHG,"I have to say right off that this show is one that can be easily criticized, but if you have been an avid watcher of the series since it's inception all suspensions of disbelief are overlooked without any hesitation. Carrie Mathison is a woman that has the weight of the world on her shoulders (often literally) at all times, works and breathes for the CIA, lives with Bipolar disorder and yet never gives less than 100% of herself if she can help it. Season 4 holds nothing back; there is personal drama, war zone havoc, character developments, character assassinations, breakdowns and a break of a breach so shocking you will be on the edge of your seat totally living for what happens next.
  I could not write this review of course without metioning and applauding Claire Danes immaculate performance of Carrie. Her acting is so subtle, so second-nature that it is at times frightening to consider the possibility that Carrie Mathison does not really exist. I am in awe of her talent, who Carrie has become because of her, and truly consider her to be one of the finest actors in the industry.
  This is a series that really expands the possibilities of a drama, opens your eyes to the harshness of the world, and is downright addictive at the end of the day. Every character in the show that is given the time of day I become invested in, and the writing for each one is never less than spectacular. Not for the faint of heart but quality television that I believe will stand the test of time for many years to come and that is just season 4!",1489449600,4,1547,4.514285714285714

6708874,5,B00O4CTSHG,"Even though we just recently ""discovered"" this series, my wife and I rate it as high as The Sopranos, Game of Thrones and gulp, even The Walking Dead. It has outstanding acting, tense non-stop action and incredibly EVERY single episode is exciting. We haven't found even ONE, what we refer to as ""filler"" episode in any of the first four seasons. That's 48 total episodes and not one that didn't have you on the edge of your seat. We just purchased the first 5 seasons and we will share our ""find"" by having our son and daughter-in-law catch up by watching each season. For those of you, who love tense drama, action, action, ACTION, and a small insight into how our CIA must work, this is a CAN'T MISS series. We have never had Showtime, but they certainly have a gem in this series to say the least.",1485561600,,801,4.418918918918919

Going into season 4 it just didn't capture my attention.  They tried to create the same level of suspense but it just didn't work for me.  I got a few episodes into the 4th season and just lost interest.

If you're considering this series I do highly recommend the first 3 seasons and if you stop there you have a satisfactory ending - no big cliff hangers to bring you back for the next season so you can avoid season 4 without suffering any angst.",1484784000,,583,4.178571428571429

We miss it & looking for another series to fall in love with as much as we did Homeland.
Claire Danes is a remarkable actress!

6708970,2,B00O4CTSHG,"Okay, I'm about half way through and I'm getting pretty disgusted. Oh yeah....*spolier alert*

Is this how the CIA operates? Have their female operatives be whores and sluts in order to gain the trust of a informant? I could understand falling for a returned marine because she liked him, but seducing a young boy (informant) and having sex with him is just getting out of hand. It reminded me of the scene from season one with her and Brody in the cabin. What the hell is the developers thinking with this trash? I'm thinking they want to make Claire Danes character a horny teenager looking to get her rocks off any chance she gets. I could see this coming when she was wearing that skimpy outfit and told Fara goodnight. Thank God Sauls character is more engaging and you can tell the developers actually want people to like him...

6709003,1,B00O4CTSHG,"The producers and writers of this ridiculous show have a clear agenda, and it's a liberal one. Show every fear, threat, actual danger but then show every hard hit back and assertive prevention as failure, misguided, a loss. And of course the Americans are constantly betraying each other or sleeping with the enemy. I almost choked to see who was in the car with Haqqani. Pathetic plotting. Add to that the Carrie freak show continues. How does she still have her job? This is such a stupid show.",1477699200,,496,4.6477272727272725

6709020,5,B00O4CTSHG,"This is a brilliant show with impeccable actors and story lines. I was actually a late watcher.  I just started watching it about 3 moths ago, but I serial watched it.  The stories are like an intricate spider web.  The acting... I would like to bow to Claire Danes I think she has hit yet another peak, she draws you deep inside her carefully built character with a curious back  story.  Mandy Patinkin has built a thrilling character.  Just when I think I have him figured out, he surprises me.  Damian Lewis and Clare put together was explosive had me yelling and laughing while also squeezing the nearest blanket. I was sorry to see him go, but on the other hand when they brought Rupert Grint on the show, I immediately saw sparks between him and Carries as well.  They are the doomed to be the ""romeo and juilet"" of the show.  I was rooting for them, but hey, where would the drama be?

To some it up, if you are into Thrillers, if you can sit down and really watch and hear everything about the characters and there doings.  You can see stories that aren't blatantly  put in the script, they are added little treasures.  I recommend the show all the time to friends and family.",1476662400,,1184,4.400921658986175

Who knows, how many pretend people have lost their imaginary lives, because of her. Still, she keeps her job.  She has known that Brody was a traitor since Season 1. Yet she falls in love with him, and has a baby with him? I'm pretty sure that makes her a traitor too. Isn't the idea of a honey pot, to just get the person to tell you stuff? Stupid.  Also, how did a bi-polar woman, who doesn't take her meds, and continuously has serious mental health problems, get hired with a government agency that requires carrying a gun? One episode, she chooses to have a LABOTAMY, like it is elective surgery (I'll have the nose job, oh and can you cut that little problematic bit out of my brain too?).

6709107,4,B00O4CTSHG,"I almost wrote this show off after the second season.  That season was horrible, especially the daughter's teenage angst story lines.  The third season was much better and I was actually pleased to have the Brodie storyline finally conclude so we could be done with him (and especially his family).  I wasn't sure where they'd take the show next and have to say that I enjoyed season 4 as much as the first season.  It felt like the show was re-inventing itself.  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 solely because the final episode of the season was weak.  Very weak actually.  No spoilers here but I'll just say that the tension was gone from the last episode and it felt like a filler episode.  Not all what a season finale should be.",1473206400,,732,4.41044776119403
6709108,3,B00O4CTSHG,"I know one has to suspend disbelief when watching a fictional series, but this season pushed me a little bit too far.  The overall story arch is so implausible.  I can't imagine any U.S. Government taking such a weak stance at the end, no reprisals, no consequences.  Fortunately, Season 5 is much better.",1473033600,,305,4.716981132075472

6709336,3,B00O4CTSHG,"I am only leaving a review to hopefully bring a little balance to some of the very generous reviews of the show. Suffice it to say this show is not a documentary and is a work of fiction, but the world of Homeland (in season 4) bears little resemblance to both the real world and the Homeland of the previous 3 seasons. While the first half of season 3 was meandering and pointless, the second half regained some of the show's momentum. That brings us to season 4 where the wheels completely come off the show. In an effort to avoid another first half slump, the show reboots itself as a quick-paced action series that borders on pure absurdity. The plot has always been on the bleeding edge when it comes to the suspension of disbelief, but season 4 is so removed from reality that it has more in common with Mission Impossible and the A-Team than a serious drama.

If you're a diehard Homeland fan (which I was until season 4), you'll probably watch this regardless. However, if you're buying multiple seasons for someone else as a gift, you may want to only purchase the first 3 seasons and allow the recipient to choose whether continue watching.",1466121600,,1150,4.528846153846154

6709388,5,B00O4CTSHG,"The geopolitics in Homeland, Season 4 is dead-right.  Peter Quinn in the fantasy special-forces witness telling it like it is to a conference of CIA desk jockeys, ""What strategy [in Syria.]?""  Station chief, Carrie, targeting terrorists with drones, placidly accepts huge collateral damage.  She is shown to be the most cold-blooded killer in the CIA.  I don't care about her lack of moral compass, because it is exhilarating to have a woman at the center of and in charge of the action; and, by today's standards, she is the picture of mental health, especially dry.  Compared to Zandra Rhimes' totally nuts heroines, she is Doris Day.  The verisimilitude achieved in the filming and the action is wonderful.

The embassy conflict set the stage for a complicated plot line that had many twists and turns. Carrie's family issues were handled well enough, and they seemed to be very much in line with what we'd expect from this character. I enjoyed the guest appearance by Damian Lewis, who I still miss.

There is a tendency in long series to peter out after the second season with subsequent seasons just getting out of control and intelligent suspense giving way to mindless violence.  A lot of series should end after the first or second season.  But not this one.  Here,  the writers, directors, producers, and actors. continue to keep things on an even keel.  I felt some of the situations were a little too contrived and unbelieveable.  But, hey, it' a movie.  The acting is great, especially Raines and Patinkin.  My recommendation:  I understand there is a Season 6 coming up, eventually.  Keep watching!",1463616000,,702,4.815126050420168

I fell asleep watching some nights, trying to see what happened next,  because I just couldn't keep my eyes open.  One of the greatest thrillers ever to hit TV.  The cast is superb, particularly Mandy Pantinkin, who is seen way too little on TV AND big screen; incredibly believable and powerful. He's today's Gene Hackman.

So I'm going to be frustrated and mad watching this till the end of the series. It seems like I'm just mad watching the whole show. Poorly written. Bad show,1458345600,,446,4.258823529411765

6709670,3,B00O4CTSHG,"Seasons three wrapped up the plot line with Damien Lewis as the ""manchurian candidate.""  The first two seasons had been very slow moving, more of a psychological drama without much action.  It was hard to believe that the people that made ""24"" were involved with this project, and I assume that the first two seasons were as slow as they were because they were staying closed to the Israeli show that ""Homeland"" was based upon.  Although, in fairness, season three amped up the action quite a bit.

Well season four was like a whole different show.  And, yes, the fourth season looked EXACTLY like something the ""24"" writers would have written.  Much sillier but much more action, and much faster moving.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd say the realism went from an 8 to about about a minus 5, but the action and entertainment value went from a 6 to a 15.  So I didn't mind the new ""format"" of the show.

SPOILER ALERT!!!!

But boy did I hate the ending.  The ending was a real bummer, as it essentially ended in episode 11, with no satisfaction, no justice, no dead bad guy, and total loss of Carrie and the Americans.  It was a loss of face and a substantive loss. Carrie actually prevents Quinn from killing the heavy.  Episode 12, the last episode of the season, was a complete non-sequitur, almost unrelated to the rest of the show.  James Rebhorn, who played Carrie's father, died of cancer in 2014, and so they wrote his death on the show as well.  So they bring in Carrie's mother (who had abandoned her as a teenager) apparently to be Carrie's parental figure and replace Rebhorn in that respect.  The whole episode was a soap opera yawner, and completely out of character with what had been an action-packed season up to that point. A complete let down and disappointment.",1456012800,3,1778,4.5266457680250785

6709811,3,B00O4CTSHG,"I have watched all the episodes to date.  I'm not sure why they decided to ""dumb down"" many of the main characters.  The characters from Season One would never have lived to Season four if they were this dumb.  Also, I absolutely hate ""Hollywood stereotypes"" of things that are only in producer's minds and have nothing to do with reality.  Episode 10 had to have had the absolutely worst depiction of opiate withdrawals that I have ever seen and is so far reality as to make my head spin...it was as bad as watching a baby born on screen and the obligatory slap on the bottom to get them to breath...It Never Happens In The Real World.  I can only hope they can return to the quality of writing that they had in the first season.",1449878400,,730,4.338235294117647

6709926,5,B00O4CTSHG,"This show is one of my favorites.

Although some people said Season 3 lost steam, I disagree. Without revealing any spoilers, they were able to change up the plotline and head in a different direction, even though the pacing might've been slower at times (which might've been one of the reasons people lost interest). I'm a huge fan of pretty much anything to do with the CIA, FBI, INTERPOL, etc also any kind of WAR DRAMAS (for example, I'm a big 24, Band of Brothers fan etc) so this seemed right up my ally. I own all seasons on DVD and have watched them more than once. The character development is incredibly strong, and even though it is a bit far-fetched at times, I thoroughly enjoy this show. There's always tension and the characters are incredibly intriguing. Big thumbs up :)",1447027200,,787,4.581560283687943

6709948,5,B00O4CTSHG,"I really didn't think this show could get any better after the first 3 seasons, especially after Brody was killed off at the end of Season 3.  I couldn't have been any more wrong.  Season 4 is easily the best yet, and the penultimate episode of this season was, to me anyway, the most powerful of the entire series.

Do some of the plot lines challenge the imagination?  Sure.  But so does the reality of the cesspool in the middle east.  Embrace the imaginative stories and enjoy it.  This is a wild ride from start to finish.  It becomes clear in Season 4 that Carrie was always the focus of the show, not Brody.  Clare Danes turns in yet another amazing performance in 4 that even further develops her character.  Peter Quinn emerges as the ultimate CIA badass, reminiscent of the Mitch Rapp character in the Vince Flynn novels.

No spoilers in this review.  Hats off to everyone involved in the production of ""Homeland"".  It is absolutely top notch in all departments from writing to filming to costuming to directing and acting.  I think it now rivals the Sopranos as possibly the best long term cable series of all time.  Can't wait for Season 5.",1446681600,3,1152,4.5512195121951216

6709970,5,B00O4CTSHG,"Season 4 of ""Homeland"" continues to deliver a gripping portrayal of our ongoing war on terrorism.  For viewers of seasons 1 through 3 who wondered how the series would fare without the Brody character, wonder no longer and know all's well.  This season takes place mostly in Pakistan though we start with Carrie (Claire Danes) as station chief in Kabul running operations and targeting drone strikes.  When normally reliable intel directs her to take out a farm house where a high value target turns out to be a wedding party with resultant high collateral damage problems begin.  Carrie is off to Islamabad where she's reunited with Peter Quinn (Rupert Friend) and things take off from there.  Without giving anything away the story involves former CIA director and Carrie's mentor Saul (Mandy Patinkin), duplicitous Pakistani intelligence operatives and double dealing diplomats, a traitor in the embassy and much more.  I thought the writing was compelling up to the last episode which was atypically dull and lacked the cliffhanger ending we've come to expect from this show.  Still, ""Homeland"" provides plenty of compelling story telling and I will be back for Season 5.",1446249600,,1175,5.12041884816754

6709980,4,B00O4CTSHG,"The first three seasons put you inside the mind of a ""patriot""(Brody) turned terrorist and explored the emotional conflict he faced when he fell in love with the CIA agent (Carrie) who is tasked with bring him down.  In Season 4, Carrie is outside of Brody's shadow as she pursues the reasons for an attack on the Pakistani CIA station chief.

There is a bit of deja vu when Carrie blurs the line between love and work when she recruits a Pakistani medical school student and gets him to reveal secrets about terror organizations operating in Pakistan.  Season 4 is gripping, but the emotional connections I enjoyed in the first three seasons (Carrie and Brody, Carrie and Saul, Carrie and Quinn)  are not as intense when the storyline shifts to Pakistan.  In the first three seasons (before Carrie gives birth to her first child), you never knew what Carrie would do to protect her country.",1445904000,,891,4.72258064516129

6709994,5,B00O4CTSHG,"++WARNING++ This will contain spoilers from the prior seasons, and hints, but no major giveaways from season 4.  If you have not seen the prior seasons, skip past the first paragraph.

The 4th season of the show starts off months after the events of season 3.  Carrie is still dealing with the death of Brody and being a mother.  Most of this season's story is set in Pakistan, and playing off the very real-world scenario of they do not trust us and we do not trust them, and mainly involves a Taliban leader's grab for power.  After the Pakistan CIA station chief is killed, Carrie ends up stepping in for him and begins making dubious decisions.

Quinn really steps up to the number two character this season.  Saul's role is somewhat reduced at times.  While he is still involved in major parts of the story (especially toward the middle-end of the season) but he is on the sidelines a lot, with Carrie calling the shots and Quinn sometimes helping her and sometimes on his own.  There is a very good story line within the season of Quinn trying to get out of the CIA completely, but finding himself drawn back.  Because of Brody's death we do not see any of his family this season.  Although they did find a way to get a nice Damien Lewis cameo in one of the episodes.

For those who get the discs, the show looks and sounds great on blu ray.  It thankfully plays in season mode so you can stop and pick up where you left off.  For extras there are deleted scenes for some episodes, a few script to screen features that detail specific scenes during the season and how they were done, and character profiles.  Good for what is there, but not extensive.",1445644800,,1657,4.440397350993377

6710033,4,B00O4CTSHG,"After a brilliant finale to season 3, I had pretty much decided that I wouldn't even bother with season 4. And for a long time, I didn't. It took me until 2 days ago to finally give it a chance and ended up binge-watching the entire 4th season. Like others have stated, the finale of Season 3 was, for me, the finale of the series. I couldn't picture where the show could go after killing off Brody and that entire story-line. After 3 seasons of Brody, how could the show possibly pick itself up and continue on?

Unbelievably, the creators - writers, directors, producers - managed to pull it off. As others have also said, Homeland reinvented itself. With an entirely new and different storyline, we now find the characters in the Middle East, actually fighting the ""bad guys"", as most of us expect the CIA to be doing. The first few episodes were slow, as the show struggled to find itself and pull the audience back in and along for the ride. By the 4th episode, I knew I had to stick with it to see where it ended up. I'm glad I did. Episodes 4 though 11 kept me on the edge of my seat. There were enough twists and turns to surprise me and keep me hooked.

I was truly disappointed with the final episode where most of the characters are back stateside, after action, struggling to figure out where they belonged. SPOILER ALERT: I still don't get why Carrie's mom shows up in the final episode. I can't remember her ever being mentioned in any of the previous episodes and her sudden appearance (along with learning that Carrie has a half brother), did nothing to advance the storyline. Even if they bring ""Mom"" back in the 5th season, I can't see where she would fit in with anything that's gone before. The other puzzling event at the end of episode 12, is Quinn jumping into a special ops team after first saying ""no"". Did I miss something? It wasn't apparent to me, why he would do this after his final phone conversation with Carrie, while she's off in Missouri meeting with her mom. The final episode didn't tie up any loose ends. As far as teasers for the 5th season, this episode seemed to fail. I didn't pick up anything compelling enough to make me wish season 5 were already available.

Other than the final episode, though, I would highly recommend this season. There's enough action, intrigue, and adventure to satisfy anyone who loves this particular genre.",1444867200,5,2377,4.510440835266821

6710059,5,B00O4CTSHG,"Despite its flaws, inconsistencies and improbabilities, HOMELAND is still one of the best dramas on TV. Its aesthetics and overall quality of production outshine even the highest budget Hollywood blockbuster. Each season, CIA Intelligence Office Carrie Mathison (the phenomenally talented Claire Danes) fights terrorism to protect the American way of life. Season 4 is no different though Mathison's love interest Nicholas Brody was heroically ""finished off"" in season 3.
Ever in search of redemption, Mathison passes up an assignment in ""safer"" Turkey to be CIA station chief in Kabul, Afghanistan. Of course, there would be no story if Mathison stayed in a more peaceful location. This time her terrorist target is Haissan Haqqani (Numan Acar made up to look particularly scary and ominous). Mathison makes a decision that results in the loss of dozens of civilian lives. The fight for her redemption suddenly becomes more imperative.
HOMELAND is an often overwhelming and confusing swirl of plot lines and characters. Season 4 often veers off course with irrelevant side stories or ones that have potential that is never fulfilled.  Rupert Quinn returns as Peter Quinn as Mathison's CIA black ops cohort.  His character and his devotion to Mathison are more clear in Season 4, Quinn, always the lady's man, begins a relationship with the gorgeous overweight manager of his apartment building.  Here is a lovely and tender story where the woman is not a ""traditional"" beauty but has an inner and outer beauty that lights up the screen. Then the subplot is over leaving us wanting more.
Several new characters are added this season and always expect the unexpected as to who will leave the series and who may or may not be the person they appear to be.  Mathison is ready to use her beauty and looks to seduce and possibly betray men who cross her path. And there is plenty of betrayal in Season 4. No one can be trusted.
Be prepared to accept story lines that are implausible and sometimes portray a whole nation in bad light. It seems like everyone in the Pakistani government is supporting terrorism except for one brave soul. HOMELAND doesn't always provide a balanced picture of good and bad and people just desperate to survive in unpleasant circumstances.
The story lines at time can be overwhelming. Just try to keep track of it all. Mathison leaves her infant daughter in the care of her long suffering sister and father.  A long missing relative turns up in another storyline that seems to be just filling up time and offering no substance. Mathison jumps from Afghanistan to Pakistan to various US locations and back again with the ease of a  trip to the local shopping mall. How does she find time for all of this.
In the end, few can disagree that this remarkable cast of actors is one of the best on TV. The settings and photography are wonderful. Despite all the flaws in the stories, HOMELAND is addictive and riveting. I can't wait for Season 5.",1444694400,,2963,4.880715705765407

I don't want to spoil anything in case you're like me and watch it after the dvd comes out BUT I watched Seasons 1-3 within a month of Season 4 coming out.

6710154,5,B00O4CTSHG,"I love this season  and as to prove how into I am , I couldn't tell you if  I thought season 3 moved faster or slower than 4 or vice versa. What makes it so unique for me  is that I can't figure out what is fact or fiction. Does this really happen in real life, could it happen in real life.is it happening now?.
There were many twists and turns in this season that I didn't see coming and I think more than that I just felt  totally surprised - like "" What??!!""  For instance Carrie sleeping with Ian in order to turn him  and then Haqqani shooting him point blank in the head after the endearing embrace ( I still don't know how Haqqani knew there was a drone??.)
 I felt that it might of been pushing the envelope to have Saul be in Pakistan unguarded as an ex-CIA- Director. Its no wonder really he was caught twice. Some aspects of the story had me wondering the next day for instance about  the  relationships  Carrie has Aasar Khan,  Fara, her sister, Saul, her baby and then you see all she can muster when hearing of her fathers death.  So complicated.
Carrie has an unusual personality, She is brilliant obviously , has deep connections with the people in her life and yet can trust no one,  has no time for shame, will do ANYTHING to get the bad guy , and in no way does she take things personally - even if she is at fault. Its not like she is in denial  she just doesn't let things land on her and stick. Its actually a very good strategy for someone who has the  kind of job she has and has to make the kind of decisions she does.
Cant wait for season 5!",1443225600,,1568,4.0950819672131145
6710155,4,B00O4CTSHG,"Homeland for me has never reached the heights that it promised , however  series 4  hit all the right spots for me , well after episode 3 anyway .

I was  so entralled at the series , then the last episode , it went flat

I was  not expecting some gung ho  action ending , bu for me when I watched the last  episide last night , I felt flat , dissapointed.

Hopefully the writers will have some ideas around the corner to spark my interest in Season 5

6710188,4,B00O4CTSHG,"It's still a fairly engrossing series, but the plot twists are getting a bit tired / predictable in the UNPREDICTABILITY.  The issue I have is that everyone always has 2 sides, nothing is ever as it seems, whatever you think is going to happen -- it will inevitably be reversed So, you end up watching it while saying to yourself ""OK, I know this plan / action / mission is NEVER going to actually work -- and that some completely unknowable twist is about to be introduced, which is the writers' mechanism to drive the story forward to the next episode.""

So, I think the mechanism is getting a little worn out.  The series ""24"" eventually fell to a similar fate, although in the early seasons of that they were not shy to kill off main characters.",1443139200,,749,4.452554744525547

But the writers/producers know what they are doing when crafting a show like this.  Rupert Friend is so good as the damaged (well, they all are) assassin wanting out.  I wish the directors would tone down Claire Danes acting a few notches.

Whose brilliant idea was it to focus a plot thread on Brody's daughter and her lame misadventures?

And why did everyone throughout the series, including his wife, call him ""Brody"" instead of his first name, Nick? Very odd.

So I guess I'd say that Homeland is 75% great, because Season 4 rocks and it's almost making up for that raggedy-ass Season 3.

When I went to resume play, I kept getting a message that the video could not be enabled.  I tried several troubleshooting techniques and finally called Amazon's support.  I spent over an hour on the phone, part of the time on hold, and was finally told that they really couldn't help me.  Via email I requested a refund and that was applied to my account.  I would certainly hesitate to rent another Amazon video again.  No service, no support.  I was extremely disappointed. We never have any trouble with other services such as Netflix and Vudu.

I was so mad about the season 3 finale that I boycotted Season 4 until now, out of boredom and curiosity, before Season 5.
Also the depiction of Bipolar Disorder in the main character and its impact on friends and family members is spot on

It was priced at $39.99 which I didn't have at the time so I didn't buy it. But then a week later I went back for it and noticed it had disappeared from the shelves. I literally had it in my hands the week before. I picked it up because I thought the cover was so interesting looking with Carrie in her red hijab surrounded by everyone else dressed in black.

6710259,5,B00O4CTSHG,"Starts a little slow but the pace picks up by episodes 3 and 4. Season 4 is a great study in how dysfunctional people thrive in modern bureaucracies. Carrie is neurotic, narcissistic and bipolar. She cannot attach to her child, nor can she form normal attachments with  friends or lovers. But she is a great CIA operative. In her work she does not have to form close attachments; everything is superficial and duplicitous. She is a loyal worker bee to the core. Her job is the only situation she can function in. Saul is Mr. Administrator. Basically a loser as a family man. The soulless bureaucracy is the only place he can function. Poor Quinn. He is the only one of the CIA group with a core. He realizes what a charade the work there is, and how the narcissistic politicians and career bureaucrats justify their pathetic work. The American family is portrayed as broken throughout in the series. The main characters are suckers for status and their jobs.

Dont losten to the negative reveiw. I heard one character actually complaining that this show makes america look incompetent,  i have a news flash for you as a vet if we were as intelligent as cable tv would perceive us then we wouldnt have been at war for over ten years!

I loved Raza Jaffrey's character and his relationship to Carrie and the female ISI agent Tasneem Qureshi, it exemplifies the real issues with Pakistan and the cultural complexities of their society. I found that very interesting.  Real Marines never would have left the Embassy unguarded the writers needed that to happen to forward the story. The writers deviated from how Marine operate at our embassies.

6710458,2,B00O4CTSHG,"Homeland Season 1 - Absolutely fantastic. Deserves all the accolade given. Season 2 kept up. Season 3 was meh. But when Brody died at the end of Season 3, they probably should have just ended the show there. Because it was the story of Brody that was the main plot. Season 4 - they did a reboot of sorts. First 2 episodes were interesting, but after that it was more of the same. Seen it all before in shows like 24. I don't need to see it on Homeland.

And what was the last episode all about? Just a set up of new characters for the next season. So slow. Seemed like watching a poor episode of the 80s show Dynasty. Time to end the show.",1423267200,7,639,4.071428571428571
6710459,5,B00O4CTSHG,"As a former senior counterterrorism intelligence officer who has worked for and/or with all the national intelligence offices (DIA, CIA, NSA, DHS, etc.) at one time or another (and who has actually, as a side note, written a short non-fiction book on some of this subject matter), I can't recommend this series highly enough.

My friends often ask me, based on my experiences, how realistic this show is, amidst all the other ""spy"" shows available on cable. I can say, since Season 1, Homeland has been amazingly accurate in many ways, from intelligence collection methods to interagency cooperation (and, notably, the lack thereof, even after 9/11). This is the one show I can point to and say: ""this is actually how it's done!""

Now, of course, it's a Hollywood drama, and not a documentary, and all that entails. But, of all the shows that have attempted to pull this off, Homeland has easily proven to be the most accurate.

I also, just from a personal entertainment perspective, find Homeland to be a must-see cable series, alongside Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad.",1422748800,62,1073,4.884615384615385
6710460,5,B00O4CTSHG,"I didn't expect to like this season but I did. I ruefully had to admit that much as I love Damian's Lewis's acting talent, his part on this series had gone as far as it could go. What we picked up with instead is Carrie actually stationed in the Middle East as a station boss. Firsthand we experience what a mess we've got on our hands over there.

The original ""Homeland"" was derived from an Israeli series as its source material. That Israeli series had dealt with POWs coming back to Israel after a hostage exchange. It never moved off of its focus on the hostages and the wars in the Middle East. This show, by contrast, has completely jettisoned the Brody hostage scenario and now is solely concerned with being CIA and stuck with and in the Middle East. Quinn now has a much bigger role as part of this. So Homeland became its own show in season 4 and no longer an offshoot of that Israeli series.  I like it better for that.

There are some truly startling moments in Homeland this season. I can't ruin it for you by telling you what they are but there is one towards the end that wlll have you on the edge of your seat for the remainder of this season.

Hats off to Claire Danes for delivering a truly complex character to series tv.",1421020800,138,1241,4.2905982905982905
8681970,3,B00O4CTSHG,"Watched 4 seasons so far. Season 4 is pretty lame. The show feels like a cheap knock off of 24 and the British show ""Spooks"". Spooks does the spy part much better, and 24 does the pacing part much better. I found myself fast forwarding a lot of the scenes that did not advance the plot, particularly in season 4 which I fast-forwarded half the season and didn't miss anything of consequence. Some parts were outright racist and really detracted from the realism of the show, like Saul screaming at Fara regarding her head scarf.",1531440000,,528,4.568421052631579
