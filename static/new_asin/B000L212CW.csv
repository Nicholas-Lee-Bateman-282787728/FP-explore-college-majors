This show is like Azumanga Daioh on crack. The best things about this anime are the animation and comedy. It's extremely strange, so don't try to understand it. Just get past the first 5 episodes and enjoy all of the goofiness that comes. If you can get a close up picture of the cover; then you can get a get a good idea of how Paniponi is drawn. The color shading and character designs are very unique and cool. There are also some pretty good voice talents in this one. It's not one of the better animes I've seen, but it's definitely funny and good mindless entertainment.",1354838400,,814,4.426666666666667
8159817,5,B000L212CW,"In the second volume of Pani Poni Dash it goes all weird. The sixth episode has Becky getting a research room that horribly fails. In the next episode Becky meets Ichijo's little sister and loses at rock paper scissors! Then Behoimi doesn't want to be a magical girl anymore. It gets crazier from there as one of Becky's old college professors calls her to come for an excavation on Okinodoku Island. Then he introduces Media, an assistant with disturbing moe overtones. In the tenth episode Media starts school and Behoimi and her find a bunch of bombs and make a creepy innuendo.

Amazon again failed to do a rating. I go with the same classification I did in my last review: 10-up for liberal, 13-up for conservative. The content: violence, some occult-ish black magic, language, and of course sexual content with weird  overtones.",1174435200,,834,4.825174825174825
8159818,5,B000L212CW,"The students return with more hyperbole behavior, this time we get to see some character development of that creepy Class Representative Miss Ichijo, more of the cute and playful teacher Becky, Suzune bullying the poor of Otome, a very special episode of that ""magical"" girl Behomi, also a reference of what is ""a three ( ... ) show"" and tons of replay value.

A new intro ( representing some of Picasso's work ) with cool music and new characters are introduced, like Miss Ichijo's younger sister, Behomi's alter ego & the professor's assistant Media, at some part of Media's episode she signs a scary family lullaby, and in the last episode she makes a  hilarious and disturbing sexual innuendo with Behoimi.

The series is known for parodies of blockbuster movies, other animes and old school video games, this time Super Mario Bros, Contra, Pinball, Fatal Frame, Castlevania, The Shining, Indiana Jones, Twilight Zone: The Movie, Jurassic park III, Nurse witch Komugi , Dragon Ball Z and many more jump into action.

If the first DVD was good for you then go and grab the second, you won't be disappointed, this ""IS"" if you really enjoy fine nonsense comedy.",1169510400,,1162,4.853535353535354
