8186350,4,B000OQF6O0,"Watching this performance of Aroldo, is very much like being fortunate enough to discover that the little town you are passing through has an opera house, and you are lucky enough to get a ticket: its a pleasant surprise, if not a life-changing experience.  Piacenza, a Northern Italian city of about 100,000 folks is home to the Teatro Municipale, a small but elegant opera house constructed in 1798.  This is not New York's Metropolitan House, with the ability to raise vast amounts of money for immense salaries, or room for elaborate sets, considerations when reviewing a provincial opera houses production of Verdis seldom seen Aroldo.
There are numerous positive reasons to watch this 2003 production, not the least of which is the performance by the rousing baritone, Franco Vassalo, who, as Egberto (not one of the most inspired names) completely takes command of Act III, delivering a double aria worth the price of the disc.  Each  of  major singers are dedicated and competent,  the orchestra provides  an engaging backup, and this is, after all, the only DVD of  another fascinating curio from the Verdi canon.  Viewed on its own terms this is a sincere and engaging production.  Whether or  not this opera, first performed in 1857 (between Simon Boccanegra and Un Ballo in Maschera) is a better work than its antecedent Stiffelio, seems to be a largely academic discussion--Aroldo can stand on its own, just as this relatively Spartan  production does, and is highly recommended for fans of  Verdi.",1436140800,,1511,5.020080321285141

Verdi-lovers would be pleased to have this.  Of course, it's not his greatest work, but it has plenty of good music, most of the singers are extremely good, none of the principles sing badly, and the sets are very tasteful.  The soprano and the baritone are extremely good and she also is a real treat for the eyes.  The tenor is enjoyable but not quite as good as the other two.  It's a good show with music you will probably give a listen too again and again.",1282003200,3,543,4.1923076923076925
8186352,5,B000OQF6O0,"The previous reviewer must have seen a different DVD from the one I just viewed!
I fell in love with this opera in the early 1980s when I purchased a CD of a live recording of a concert version of this opera at Carnegie Hall with Montserrat Caballe singing the role of Mina. Then in 1990 I read that the Sarasota Opera was presenting a full staged version of this opera for the first time ever in the United States ( I believe that to be true as of today) as part of their Verdi Cycle. I went and I was not diasapointed.
Now about this production: There is nothing provincial about it, the singers are young and unknown but they are quite good, in particular Adriana Damato,who sings well and can act. She was particulary moving in Act III. The orchestra and chorus are very good, the storm music in Act IV  are like a preview into the storm music of the opening of Otello, yet to come.
The updating of the plot to the 19th century at times seems at odds with the story of a crusader, but the production is visually stunning, the sets and custumes are great, the singers look good and look their parts.
If you like early Verdi, well if you just like Verdi (remember that although the original Stiffelio was written early, Verdi revised the score for Aroldo after Rigoletto, Trovatore and Traviata!)do not miss this production.",1182384000,17,1326,4.434426229508197
8186353,1,B000OQF6O0,"We are unlikely to see another DVD of this revision of Stiffelio, but this present version is barely acceptable. The singing is mediocre. Then they have updated the time to the 19th century. But that is all botched. The original Aroldo was a Scottish crusader. But the costumes here are Italian. How this fits with all the talk of Palestine who knows. However in the cemetary scene why is the tomb writing in English - ""Mother?"" Mother is right. Or better yet, Mamma mia!  And why doesn't Aroldo the soldier take killing his enemy into his own hands? Well here he is a cripple when they want him to be but not at other times. But this is also Verdi's fault changing from minister to crusader. The lightintg is such that in some scenes there is more light from the orchestra pit on stage than stage lights. A very parochial production. They should take poor Toscanini's name off the credits - he does not deserve this.  Thank goodness there is already one great Stiffelio with Carrerras and Malfitano available. Aroldo doesn't do much to improve on the original and this production does even less.",1177891200,15,1096,4.644329896907217
