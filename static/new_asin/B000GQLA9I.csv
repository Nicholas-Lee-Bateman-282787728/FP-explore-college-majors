8325131,4,B000GQLA9I,"This video is a hidden gem. It gives practical and balanced guidelines on healthy eating and proper techniques for exercises.  The video is 165 minutes long which includes an exercise routine.  The trainer encourages eating high quality nutritious foods in moderation, in the best combination and at the proper times.  It gives tips on how to overcome bad eating habits.  This is the best advice I have found thus far on making a lifestyle change instead of dieting.  The only con is the filming. The trainer was not directed to look at the camera at times.  She reads a cue card off to the side, which can be distracting to watch. Overall the content of the video is excellent.",1263427200,,678,4.65546218487395
