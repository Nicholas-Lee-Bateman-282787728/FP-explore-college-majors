8513174,2,B00284BVB8,"This video is horribly produced.  The quality of the video is on the par of a home video, with jumpy cameras and echoing sound.  There is no narration, just one interview after another, with nothing linking them together.  When the video displays a game with the person being interviewed talking about the game, the sound for the game itself is so loud that it drowns out the speaker.  Not worth the money.",1291939200,,406,4.597222222222222
