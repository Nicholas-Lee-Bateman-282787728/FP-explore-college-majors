  It moves a long at a good pace and it never seemed to get bogged down. As for myself I have seen tons of horror films and there were no jump scares in this film for me.
  If you are not sure about it just watch it via Prime as it is free for members. I have seen it twice now and its replay value was good.
  Some do not like subtitled movies and no matter how good this is you more than likely would not like this for that reason. Yet if you do not mind subtitled movies then this should be a good watch for any Horror fan.
  My 5 star rating is based on it being a foreign flick to some it might be a 3 or 4 star movie. Another good foreign film you might like is ""Along with the Gods""....not a horror film but it is an impressive Fantasy CG fueled movie.",1527811200,,1011,4.02
8760804,5,B01FHSU9OQ,"Had no idea what to expect here but I left this movie so incredibly impressed. The story is very, very strong, drawing from Taiwanese folklore and achieving incredibly creepy effects. The pacing of the movie is whats really brilliant though. You can hardly go very long without something horrific happening. But it all fits into the character development and story progression so it never felt superfluous. The one weak aspect on the movie was the CGI, it wasn't terrible, but at times it didn't look very good. But the design of the ghost was brilliant and there are other things in the mountains which were equally horrific. So many amazing visuals that the CGI didn't bother me that much. Very creative, incredibly unique, so bleak, atmospheric and creepy. This is easily now one of my favorite Asian horror movies.",1487289600,,818,4.892086330935252

This is a Taiwanese film with English subtitles. The film initially centers on Ho Chih Wei, a young man who lives with his grandma and sells real estate. He has a number of issues. His girlfriend of 5 years doesn't want to marry him. Aunt Shui has gone missing. Grandma has wandered off. A girl in a red dress from the mountains has been coming to the city and taking souls. And oh yes, he develops that possession thing and goes missing as the film now shifts gears into a real horror film and centers on the girlfriend Shen Yi-Chen. She gathers up a posse to go to the mountains. At an hour into the film it gets good as she strolls through the woods.

This was an okay horror film similar to Japanese horror films. There is an anti-abortion theme, perhaps aimed at the mainland. Not a good film for any woman who has recently had an abortion.

Guide: F-word (I can now swear in Mandarin, should prove interesting next time I order Chinese.) . No sex or nudity.  3 1/2 STARS",1464998400,,1035,4.319587628865979
