6486036,5,B00LGCPE3E,"I have now watched the 2nd of the 3 dvds available for season 1 of the Ghost and Mrs. Muir. And, I love this show! The chemistry between Hope Lange and Edward Mulhare is evident and truly makes the series so special! I am looking forward to the 3rd dvd of season one which I also purchased. I am hoping the 4th dvd will become available to complete the first season. And of course, I am also waiting for season 2!

This series is so entertaining as well as very well done! The picture and sound are great and we owe that to Amazon for manufacturing it b/c of the demand for this series to be released! Please add the 4th dvd to complete season one Amazon and of course release season 2 so we can complete our collection as well as enjoy watching this enchanting show!. Many of us are eagerly waiting for the above mentioned!

To any of the fans who are contemplating the purchase of this series. It is worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1410912000,4,927,4.32183908045977

6486043,2,B00LGCPE3E,"I have really looked forward to seeing this series on DVD, but there is no way I will pay over 50 dollars for one season of any show. I don't mind paying for what I get, but hate to be taken advantage of like this. Luckily, it is on in rerun form on our local station, so I will be satisfied with that. If the price was about 19.99 for a full season. I would have already purchased this. Also, I want to see all the episodes, some evidently have been deleted. I guess if they put those in, there would be 4 season one discs. Disgusting greed in my opinion.",1464220800,,556,4.018018018018018

6486046,4,B00LGCPE3E,"I love this show and have waited YEARS for a clear copy of the series  with quality image and sound. This DVD has the sound and image quality, it looks better than it did via ""rabbit ears"" when I was 8 years old! Everyone should buy this series, even if it is one DVD at a time.

But....WHERE ARE THE EIGHT MISSING EPISODES?! AMAZON, OR WHO EVER DECIDES THESE THINGS....MAKE THOSE 8 MISSING EPISIDES AVALABLE AND LETS FINALLY HAVE A COMPLETE SET OF THE GHOST AND MRS. MUIR!!!

6486049,3,B00LGCPE3E,"I'm a big fan of this tv show, the problem is with the DVDs which say USA on them but are indeed of a different region which means having to change the region on your laptop. If anyone is familiar with this process, it means you only have a total of five chances to change the region on your laptop if that's the device you wish to use to watch them. This means you can only watch it a minimal amount of times- especially if you want to watch other things in between - then the changing over each time uses up chances. It's extremely frustrating. Also, it's a shame Amazon does not have this show on  instant video- then we wouldn't have this issue at all.",1448323200,11,656,4.165354330708661

6486053,4,B00LGCPE3E,"So delighted that these are finally available! First show was visually like an old movie (lint & scratches). I realize that these have been salvaged and not cleaned up.  Whole series is a disappointment for my deaf husband, who needs captions.",1443398400,,243,4.926829268292683
6486054,5,B00LGCPE3E,"It was very nice to se that a lot of the episodes used parts of the movie for the topic. Like the ""monkey puzzle tree"" and the time Carolyn in-laws wanted her to move back. I cant say it enough, I love this series!",1436918400,,214,3.8863636363636362

6486072,5,B00LGCPE3E,"This is just an excellent series from the past.  Hope Lange & Edward Mulhare just shine in their parts.  Charles Nelson Reilly is hilarious as Captain Gregg's befuddled nephew.  The scripts were well thought out...very creative.  I highly recommend the purchase of this series.  My only complaint is the cover photo on the package.  To dark to see  Captain Gregg at the bottom with his telescope.  Otherwise, a great buy.",1416009600,3,421,4.914285714285715

6486075,5,B00LGCPE3E,I just ordered season 2 disc 1 of The Ghost and Mrs. Muir [the one I am reviewing] and know it will be the same quality as season 1. Amazon is doing a great job.

8665688,5,B00LGCPE3E,"This delightful series is an old favorite of mine, so please bear that in mind as I tell you about it. Far better than the movie it is based on,the stars, Hope Lange, Edward Mulhare, and Rita Shaw do fantastic jobs in the roles they play, and you will be pleased at all the adventures they get into and how the various problems are solved. Briefly, Ms Lang plays the widow Mrs. Muir, Mr Mulhare the ghost, and Ms Shaw the general house keeper. ( I should also mention Scuffy, their dog)  They live at Gull Cottage,the former home of Captain Grieg, an old sailor.  In time the family accepts that there is a ghost, and they get along perfectly. These DVDs  are very well done, But they are Fox releases, so Idon't see why it takes soo long for those guys to get on the bandwagon. Old TV series are valuable! Get them out of the vault!. For the rest of you enjoy this well done series.",1500422400,3,883,4.244047619047619

8665690,5,B00LGCPE3E,"Even though I did not purchase the DVD set from here, (I paid 3 times the amount.) I did purchase the region free DVD Samsung player for cheap. I love the series and the DVD player. I have made other DVD purchases that needed a region free player and it has worked out well. Thank you",1490918400,2,284,4.089285714285714
