3521820,5,B001D265RQ,"This series honestly puts most american television to shame. Intelligent, sometimes riveting plot devices and writing drive Ghost in the Shell at a consistent pace. Every episode tries to delve in different directions, reveal a bit more about The Major along with the other characters without revealing too much.

The writers know there's a certain 'unknown' and mystery to The Major and her prosthetic/cybernetic existence. They keep things fresh with what seems to be limitless plot twists and variations of the theme.

I loved the underlying, ever present scheme of the Laughing Man. They way his (or even her) story was very compelling and interesting.

Great work indeed.",1266192000,3,676,5.2407407407407405
3521821,5,B001D265RQ,"This was an outstanding buy for the money. Disks came in a very ingenious box that helps save space on my DVD rack. Fitting 7 DVDs in a double-size DVD case is great. The quality of the set is just top notch. Crisp video and audio. If you are a true GItS fan, this is a must have.",1264723200,7,280,3.8448275862068964
3521822,5,B001D265RQ,"This is one of my favorite anime series ever.  It involves political corruption at the highest levels of the Japanese government, and the terrible costs of trying to fight such corruption.

It introduces a new and extremely likable character to the Ghost in the Shell universe, and follows this characters involvement with Public Security Section 9.  Section 9 represents the honest cops working within a system that has been completely corrupted.

Well, it combines a nice detective story with one possible future for human technology, which is showcased in a very impressive and flashy way.

Anyway, I'm quite serious about my 5-start review, this series actually influenced the way I look at government and society.",1264204800,2,718,5.208695652173913
3521823,5,B001D265RQ,"I'm not a fan boy of anime, but this is one of the best anime series in terms of story, theme, characters, originality (it even has an episode centered around an internet chat room), and runs a gambit of emotions at time (funny/sad). It's also very accessible to Western audiences, being sort of like a Tom Clancy, and a mix of other thriller best-sellers. Highly recommended if you like ""24"", Tom Clancy, and cyberpunk.

Shame that it wasn't more popular.",1262131200,,456,4.7
3521824,5,B001D265RQ,"When I first saw Ghost In The Shell movie back on 1996 on HBO. (Yes, HBO), I instantly fell in love with the storyline and tha animation (the animation for God's sake), never had seen such great animation for that time. Well, following the item above, I think the series are well done, this first season is filled with some heavy philosophical script (as all GITS universe is) and the plot in my opinion is very interesting it self. The sound is avalaible in both english and japanese audio in dolby 5.1 or 2.0, you choose. In this set you get a well variaty of extras that includes some interviews with the director and production staff as well as the seiyus from the japanese audio. Also you fine the wierd but funny Tachikomatic Days shorts, where these little fellas try to understand the meaning of self thinking and morality and other stuff.

Great work from Bandai, as always.",1256774400,20,883,4.5886075949367084
3521825,5,B001D265RQ,"Ghost in the Shell is brilliant! Simply brilliant!

Make sure you watch the series before you watch the movies. I am not going to go into describing what it's about. This series is by far the smartest series that I've watched of ANY kind; animated and non-animated. I am not a fan of anime either. This is the second japanese animated series that I've watched since Robotech (which I also loved) and I'm hooked. I can't believe that only 2 seasons were made out of this. The depth of the characters, the ethical conflicts, the moral dilemmas... if you're a Star Trek Voyager fan, then Ghost in the Shell is for you.",1256515200,3,615,4.491071428571429
3521826,4,B001D265RQ,"First of all, I just want to mention that I was always interested in GITS SAC, but between the other expensive collection floating around and the fact that it only airs once a week at 4am, I've never really had the chance to take a closer look. That is, until this convenient, affordable set-up.

Well, anyway, GITS SAC revolves around the investigation of a cyber-terrorist known as the ""laughing man."" Throughout the series attempts are made to stop this heinous criminal only to reveal that the plot is much thicker and deeper than first imagined.

Along with the overlying plot, stand alone episodes act as avenues for character development, philosophical questioning as well as world building. Perhaps two of the better (or at least entertaining in my point of view) episodes consist of Batou's backstory while investigating a fighter and the tachikoma's consistent questioning of life and death.

Though these stand alone episodes offer much in the way of development, they have a habit of breaking the pace a little. If you are not intending to watch large chunks of the series at a time or in reasonable sucession, important details can easily be forgotten.

All and all, GITS SAC offers espionage, action, philosophical debate and characters that you can't help to feel for. Just remember one thing while diving through the GITS SAC world: Nothing is at it seems. And one other thing: it doesn't hurt to keep the remote in hand to rewind to what you missed.",1249171200,36,1466,4.875502008032129
3521827,5,B001D265RQ,"This anime is one of the most complex stories ever...
But if you listen closely and keep a watchful eye, it WILL all make sense in the very end!

I really can't explain too much of this story, without confusing, or giving away anything...

What I can say is if you like Cowboy Bebop's plot: Stand alone episodes combined with a subliminal plot then you will enjoy this.

I can also say that the theme about the series is: At point is a man a machine once he becomes a cyborg? At if a machine obtains individuality, is he/she/it human?

And lastly, if something occurs, that appears differently to others eyes, does it become what the others thought?

Philosophy, action, sci-fi, complexity, and excellence is what you will get with Ghost in the Shell.",1245888000,5,751,4.574626865671642
3521828,4,B001D265RQ,"I just bought this title (again) and it's really the way to go if you are into SAC. There is however a flaw with the set that has continued from the initial release of the limited edition disks. Specifiacally disk two. The limited edition releases came with two disks, a conventional disk and one coded for DTS. Volume two's disks were the only disks in the series that were silk screened in reverse so that the DTS disk was labled as if it were the standard version. This problem continues in this set. What this means is that a conventional DVD player will not give you any volume from the disk and you can tell on the main menu because it will read DTS disk in the right corner of the menu. Maybe Bandai will concede to replacing the erronious disk with one that will play on standard players but, I haven't gotten that far yet. That's the ONLY reason I can't give it a 5 star rating.",1229472000,76,887,4.285714285714286

3521889,5,B001D265RQ,"not much to say that legions of GiTS fans haven't already said.

Now one strange caveat, and Ive returned a set and the replacement does the same.

Recently replaced my entire AV set, from players to receiver to screen, all for UHD/4K native capability.

for some reason, in the first 4 discs, at the same points, (first incident is right as Aramaki walks in to the briefing room of the first episode) the video and audio blank out for a second. this occurs often enough to be jarring and unwatchable when on a Samsung 4K blu ray player.

Yet pop this disc into other players (PS4 Pro) and there's no problems. And into the Samsung, no other disc malfunctions (and the last two discs of this set also play perfectly as well).

Dunno if its a formatting thing or what. But Ive got a workaround so I'm happy. Binge watching this and the rest of the GiTS series and movies all week now :)",1490054400,,885,4.371951219512195

We are inexorably heading to a time where the issues raised in these episodes will be reality not fiction.  Personally I rank GitS right up with the work of Philip K Dick, Jules Verne, and Star Trek.  Stories that somehow saw the future and raised the questions we would need ask before adapting it, sometimes.  The rest of time is was just good fun.

I wonder if the stories themselves created the reality we now see.",1488499200,,578,4.355140186915888

This is a high-tech thriller with a complicated cast and compelling story line that will pull you deep into the plot and the world that contains it. I would recommend you look at a brief synopsis on IMDB. This show respects the viewer by throwing rather complicated plot lines in throughout, and will likely require you to pause and re-watch some segments if you aren't paying good enough attention to keep up. The other area where this show excels over competitors is the pacing. This is probably the first anime I have watched that always seemed to have the flow down right from start to finish.

3522061,4,B001D265RQ,"Point in fact, this series is actually made for young to mature 'adults'. Granted, the format regarding animation does set the characters with 'super-human' abilities regarding ""prosthetic-bodies"", ""artificial-limbs"" and ""cybernetic brains"". But the philosophy that pervades within this series does give it a lot of heft in regards to our ever changing technological future. (Certain episodes have so much weight, in fact. That it could be construed being as heavy as the ""cyborg"" bodies some of these characters inhabit.)

I won't go too much into what the story is. Other reviews within this page have already done that. What I will say is of all ""Anime"" series, this certain one literally shows that anime isn't just mere child's play. This is the first series of it's kind to actually show that Anime can be a top contender for drama and suspense while still highlighting the humanity that each of these characters have. The only drawback that I do have is the fact that the leading character Major Motoko Kusanagi is sometimes dressed as some hooker on certain episodes. But there are episodes where she's not so scandalous on the job. Which does help lend a grounded perspective when things get complicated.

Certain storylines are thought out and meticulous to detail. Especially when certain aspects regarding the philosophy of a changing society saturated by ever changing technology while each character tries to retain their sense of humanity. Only to end up questioning themselves and the choices left behind them. This is a series ""light years"" ahead of it's time. I can truly see why The Wachowski's were very much inspired by the original Ghost in the Shell film directed by Mamoru Oshii to create The Matrix. But, unlike the original film, this series helps flesh out the characters more by giving them a three dimensional scope to help us feel for these characters as if they were truly alive.

I'm not the type of person to actually give praise for a certain show. Especially in Anime. However, this certain series did hit me. And it hit me hard. The philosophy questioning our need for technology, how technology changes those within society certainly surprised me. Not because it was such a well-thought out storyline. But because it could literally mirror where today's society truly is at. That, in itself, is extremely note-worthy and very rare to find. Especially within Anime.",1382918400,3,2401,5.027638190954774

3522063,5,B001D265RQ,"Ghost in the Shell was always a fantastic anime movie when I was growing up, but its concepts and core philosophies seemed a bit beyond its own narrative. Now having seen the series, I know that's because it was indeed beyond itself: The concepts of Ghost in the Shell needed an entire show to explore the universe that it created (like Star Trek). Taking the time to understand the technology being presented, the moral and political implications that come with that technology, and asking us what's left of individuality and humanity once the majority of existence is synthetic, is so very worth it.

***PROS***

STORY
Stand Alone Complex is about Public Security Section 9. We observe their sleuthing skills in tracking down cyber-terrorists and their unique combat prowess when facing a variety of challenges that cyber-enhanced humanoids present. Some episodes stand alone, focusing on one case that usually deals us a moral/ethical dilemma or zeroing in on background information regarding the Section 9 characters that we follow. There is also an overarching theme the haunts the entire first season: the hunt for the cyber terrorist known as the ""laughing man."" The stories are intelligent and rewarding.  The replay value is high; a better understanding awaits with every viewing.

ANIMATION
No stills, three-frame choppy motions, or cheaply blocked fight sequences here. This is the good stuff. There's true cinematography at work. The battle animations are fluid and the choreography is sinister. But for fans of nonstop anime action (and I'm one of them): You won't find it here. If a battle can be handled in one quick move, than that's how it goes down. There's no excess, no wasteful flair. The action is always to the point.

CHARACTERS
Each member of Section 9 is an adult character. Keep an eye on all of them. Backstories are rare, but when they're provided, they reveal just enough information for you to draw your own conclusions. Viewers might emerge with their own takes on each character, so I won't bore you with mine. The Tachikomas are tanks-turned-helpers and their A.I.'s showcase a ""cute girl"" attitude that takes a while to get used to. I'm not sure if I'll ever truly embrace their grating cheerfulness, but it doesn't detract from the show in excess, and their roles are always interesting.

MUSIC
This is in my top 10 for best anime music. At times it's tech-infused and pumping, but avoids stomping over the sounds, themes and conversations; at other times it lifts with orchestral choirs. The opening title music is the best. Hands down, the best.

***CONS***

The Tachikomas worked my nerves a tad. Some of the themes presented are not explored fully (and you'll want them to be).

This is a series that deserves to be seven seasons long. I believe our interests in technology are pushing innovations inward, not outward. We are not developing a warp engine for space flight. Our consumer-driven economies are demanding smarter phones and better internet. We'll have internet access in our brains, sex mannequins, and A.I. tanks before we pursue space flight, renewable energy, and the eventual evolution past currency. This show is the perfect platform for telling stories in that not-far-off setting, and it tells them very well. More Ghost in the Shell, rather than an eighth season of Bleach (no offense).

I'm an animator and writer, so I'm constantly pouring through stacks of anime for inspiration. If you found this review helpful, or our tastes seem to align, follow along. I'll try to steer straight.",1380153600,11,3547,5.017006802721088

3522065,4,B001D265RQ,"Update 3/30/15: Still nothing on an all inclusive set. I did happen to stumble across a gem though. A Korean port has done this set justice by creating a BluRay set with all the bells and whistles (Region A, Japanese/English audio with Eng subs, full HD, 1/2 the cost, lovely UI and lovely packaging). Got season 1 and looks/works great. Speculated ~100 copies left as of 3/30/15 (mine was numbered 205/300) and Second Gig is avail for pre-order. While I can't link the URL, look into kimchidvd.

I want to relay to all potential buyers that this is for collectors. This Bluray (as the other reviews say) is only distro'ed in Japan, and simply is the price they charge Otaku's there; it boggles my mind but it's normal. You're gaining some extra video quality and zero extras that might warrant this purchase for non-diehard fans.

*THE KICKER*, This 1st of 4 parts is being consolidated into a all inclusive set (both seasons. and yes, bluray) for an amazing price! Well, for an Otaku, amazing; for a regular US consumer, still pretty steep ($400).

If you're debating this Bluray, wait for the next all-inclusive set.

*THE DOWNER* It is SUCH a shame that these Bluray sets (this set of 2, 2ng Gig's set of 2, and the upcoming set for both seasons) DO NOT include english subtitles. It does, however, include english dub. Comparatively, this wouldn't be a problem as McGlynn and the english cast are some of the best I've heard. It's just that as soon as someone deprives me from GitS in any way (no subs for the original, also awesome cast), it becomes a nagging sensation that I can't shake especially if I'm spending this kind of $$.

god this is one of the best  mix of Sci-fi , police action  , spices of drama & art visuals to boost it

the cast are really strong and each have a very distinct role

the main star "" The Major  ""  is a really one hell of a women  she is smart  , strong , cunning , agile ... .. and she is cute when she gets angry .

the chief  really amazes me  blows my mind on how smart he is  , and how he's decisions are critical and precise like a bullet  , I raise my hat to this character he is really solid to the core .

batu now I call this man the bulldozer he really likes to get into the heart of the action , funny thing is his looks reminded me of vashyron when I played RoF years back ( which I loved )

as well as all of the other members of section 9 look amazing and are worth the effort and time to the show

art style is just really good for its futuristic cyber punk feel it represents , with nice CGI for time to time when you give it you focus

the crimes that they solve are truly mind glowingly amazing  when try to peace it yourself , and the music beats makes you at your edge of your seat  most of the time if not the show it self well make you do that

this set is just worth it  I just feel grateful the got into GITS now , now that I saw the first manga movie 2.0  I cant wait  to get into 2nd gig in the future and see what more awaits me to see .

3522084,5,B001D265RQ,"There is a lot to like about the ambitious cyberpunk anime Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex. Based on the movie Ghost In The Shell, this series fleshes out some of the characters seen in the film, and adds a lot more. It has tons of stand alone episodes, but there is an overarching story about a mysterious hacker known only as the Laughing Man, the mystery of which is solved over the course of the 26 episodes.

While a lot of animes take a simple, and sometimes cliched approach to the story, this anime takes a very complex approach to each individual story told. Some aren't quite as hard to understand as others, but it's amazing look into a future not to far off is so full of techno-jargon and science that for some, it might be a little much. The individual story episodes can sometimes be rather bland, a few aren't too compelling compared to others leaving inconsistencies. I particularly disliked the fact that the overarching story wasn't all that long, and you were handed a ton of episodes that had nothing to do with anything. When I watch anime I enjoy the whole thing to be overarching or at least most of it. I don't even think Ghost In The Shell hits fifty-fifty. You can skip half the episodes of the series and get the main, most compelling story down. But it otherwise is a fantastic story, something that you would expect from a hardcore cyberpunk piece. I personally enjoyed almost every episode with the exception of a few containing the Tachikomas.

The series has amazing animation. The characters all look good, as well as the background, machines, and movements. Everything is fluid and lifelike. There are a few points where the animation degrades, especially when characters are further away. It's an otherwise very beautiful anime.

There is a great opening song as well as ending. All the voice actors do a good job with their roles and all sound very believable. The sound effects are superb.

I enjoyed almost every character. Each had little quirks, though none really showed any development over the course of the series. The only characters I dislike are the Tachikomas, annoying little tanks with the voices of prepubescenet girls that constantly talk and talk and talk. While their story of becoming sentient is interesting, there could have been a better, much more likeable approach than making them as annoying as they are.

While there are fallicies with characters and plot, everything else is superb. The series will maintain it's place as one of the greatest science fiction anime of all time, as well as one of the greatest examples of the cyberpunk genre. The thing about this anime is that it doesn't present itself as an anime quite as often as all other anime. The Tachikomas seem the only part of the whole show that is traditional anime (cute weapons of destruction).

This is an anime only for those into hardcore science fiction anime or science fiction. If it's your first foray into anime or sci-fi anime or you are looking for something immensely violent, then I would suggest looking elsewhere. While it does have some action, it's not the intesely gory and exciting action of a Shonen anime.

Overall, I give it a 9.2.",1372204800,4,3188,4.733333333333333

We can appreciate how one person who is a super hacker can create a lot of havoc in order to bring crimes to light of powerful people who would normally get away with their crimes due to high positions in society.

The characters are what drive the show; Section Nine as a whole work as a chohesive unit, nearly acting as a family when at work due to them all having cyber brains and being linked up. From Major Kusanagi's leadership, to Togusa's family man appeal, each character (with the exception of a few) are given good background and drive the stories of episodes, be it a seperate story (Stand Alone) or an arc story (Complex). The head of Section Nine, Chief Aramaki is a chessmaster, always thinking of ways to help those who ask him for it, or how to deal with situations that could have less then favourable results.

The second big aspect is the music. Yoko Kanno is one of the genuises of music for anime, she is  behind the music of this show, Cowboy Bebop, and many others. It could be a theme for the Unit, a small, sung piece of background music by Scott Matthews, or the heartbreaking piece Goodbye My Master for the Tachikomas.

Speaking of, the Tachikoma's are the main reason I see the show as philisophical. These weaponized 'robots' are constantly asking questions; What is ones existence? Is there truly a higher power? What does it mean to die? These are questions human beings ask every day, and so it amazes me that these machines think like us when others tell them they are mere weapons.

3522103,5,B001D265RQ,"Having been a big yet latent fan of Anime movies, I do to rate the Ghost in The Shell Movies very highly.
This TV series, though a little dated (according to my Japanese friends), gives the characters of Ghost in The Shell a chance to shine in their own terms.

There is many very 'human' elements and debates in this series which is essentially like an action packed cop drama set in the future. A future that when you think about it, is becoming very real in today's real world.
The stories are very slick and powerful with many 'over aching' story lines being played out throughout the series.
But it is not always a grimm 'Blade Runnerisc' world you enter, there are some light relief, particular with the Tachikomas and the other characters playing off with each other superbly.

This set is well concieved with an exting DVD menu and interactiveness. Extras are a bit few and far between, though the interviews with the voice actors give you a great insight of how you play a character that is drawn rather than acted.

A worthy inclusion to any anime collection.",1354579200,2,1069,4.5863874345549736
3522104,5,B001D265RQ,"It's a fantastic anime with a great English dub, good music, and a very engaging plot.  It's a very re-watchable show.  This set is inexpensive and comes with some cute extras.  I don't know what else to say.  Get it.",1353974400,,217,4.35
3522105,5,B001D265RQ,"What a great idea and believe me it's totally worth watching and also owning.  It's a must for anyone who loves science fiction and for all of those who have their own DVD library or collection.  The show centers around the secretive and illusive Section 9. The main character is being displayed upon the cover as none other than Major Kusanagi.  Together with the rest of the team, being led by Section 9 Chief Aramaki, they take down the criminals in this futuresque type of anime.
I love the entire idea of what Ghost in the Shell represents and is trying to show to us the viewer.  It's a sleek take on future crimes and a new type of crime fighting unit.  It also involves the robot/robots named Tachikoma, and provides the idea that these robots have been able to somewhat create thier own identity to that of a human soul.  Whatever your take on animated movies or tv series is; take my word on it, if you are hesitant, rent it, download if from netflix, or youtube and just sit down and enjoy it.  I promise you, you want regret it.",1346630400,,1040,4.385416666666667

3522117,5,B001D265RQ,"Possibly my favorite anime series to date, this is a futuristic cyberpunk anime that really defines the genre.

My one an only complaint is that the packaging for this product leaves a little to be desired. While completely functional some of the design and copy feels a little bit rushed, like the typo in the episode list and the inconsistent colors on the DVDs themselves. I can't discount it at all though because this is a wonderful little box for a great price.",1337904000,,467,4.626506024096385
3522118,5,B001D265RQ,"Every episode is golden--great dialogue, character development, and loved the Japanese voice actors.  Naturally, with longer development time, the characters get more time to grow and truly shine, which makes this series stand out over the movie for me.  If you're looking for a an intelligent sci-fi/action, look no further than here.  If you're like me, you'll watch it again and again.",1337040000,,388,5.225806451612903
3522119,5,B001D265RQ,One of the best animes the Japanese have ever made. If you haven't seen this before. You need to watch it!!!!!!! 100 out of a 100,1337040000,,129,4.0
3522120,5,B001D265RQ,"I bought this from a local store a few years ago and to this day it is still my favorite anime series and definitely worth watching more than once. The only thing about it that may give someone who has never watched anything Ghost in the Shell some pause is that, at least for me, when I originally watched it on TV for the first time it took me a long time to actually realize exactly what they were talking about with all their terms that you won't hear in the real world, but trust me, it's totally worth it and is in my opinion the best anime purchase I've ever made.
  The picture on this series it excellent as it the voice acting and it is probably one of the best looking DVD anime series out there, I just hope that someday they come out with it on Blu-Ray so I can see just how good it can look.",1335139200,,805,4.025
3522121,5,B001D265RQ,"Are you a Sci-fi fan? Are you a Anime fan? If so this one is just right for you.

This Series is based on the Anime Movies and Manga of the same titles.

You will be at the edge of your seat as you watch this Sci-fi Thriller, as ""Public Security Section 9"" attempts to find ""The laughing man"" and among other cases you will quickly want to watch the next episode. Each Character has there own personality and there own past. The animation is done realy well and the Series is complete but still leaves you wanting more.

Bottom line this is a great Scf-fi Thriller and you will enjoy each episode.

Note there is Violence, Language and brief nudity not recomended for children.",1324598400,,677,4.392

3522124,5,B001D265RQ,"GITS SAC presents a very sophisticated, intelligent anime. Although similar to police procedurals, GITS has an intelligence theme including complex bureaucracy, corrupt politics, and terrorism. With this basis, the anime is rich in background information, detail of weapons & tactics, complex investigations, and use of technology. Although fictional, the story's events, setting, and characters are very relevant and possible. For example, both protagonists and antagonists are present rational defense for their actions and idealism. Even the ""good guy"" can understand the reasoning behind ""bad guy."" Overall, Ghost in the Shell can challenge your viewing of anime so pay attention or you'll stand alone.",1316908800,4,706,5.864077669902913
3522125,4,B001D265RQ,Nice complex story.  I hate how the tachikomas got sent back and still sacrificed themselves for Batou.  Can't get enough of kusanagi's booty.,1314144000,,142,5.130434782608695
3522126,5,B001D265RQ,"After years of watching anime and hundreds of series I have plowed through, this series still takes the cake as one of my all time favorite anime.
For those of you who are not very well versed in anime, you should really take a look at this series, to give you an idea of how influential ""Ghost in the Shell"" is, Ghost in the Shell inspired the American movie series ""The Matrix"". ""The Matrix"" was basically an American play on ""GitS"" to a degree. also, a bit of a note, every single episode of this series got nearly a movie budget, so the animation quality is top notch and they really didn't seem to cut any corners in general, it's well thought out and does not have a rushed ending of any sorts.
It does an amazing job of portraying a very possible future, and if you are into computers and engineering, you will know that the future portrayed is frighteningly possible. Where the line between human and machine blur, and where the world is a very troubling place if you just poke a little under the surface. The series follows a cyborg woman named Motoko and her co-workers in the special police force named ""Section 9"" as they tackle the crimes of the future.
The good first large chunk of episodes are there to basically introduce you to the characters of Section 9 and to the world. Given that these are some pretty deep characters and a pretty complicated world, they do a good job in fleshing out the characters and giving you a feel for how the world is like in the future in preparation for the main story arc, ""The Laughing Man"". There may be a good amount of talking and explanation in the series compared to most others, but bear with it, the issues they talk about are very interesting and will do you allot of good to understand them since we will likely deal with them in the future within a couple decades or so.
If you like a deep story and look for more than just ""entertainment"" in anime when possible, then this should do the trick. It will give you an engaging story that is also enlightening to some extent.

about the actual physical product, the packaging is on the cheap side, but given how cheap it is when compared to the deluxe versions of the series, a good $45 is much better than paying a scary $200+ for individual cases. also, since they are cramming all the episodes into so few disks, don't expect much on the side of extras either, but given that you are looking at this particular release version, you likely only care about the actual episodes anyways. a good deal in my opinion for one of the best anime series out there.",1305504000,24,2564,4.409282700421941
3522137,3,B001D265RQ,"this is advertised as ""Ghost in the Shell: Complete Collection"" which to me means both movies and both seasons of the anime- but once I received it I see that it's only ""Season 1 Complete Collection"".  TOTALLY BUNK DUDE",1301356800,14,219,4.615384615384615
3522138,5,B001D265RQ,"This series is a wonderfully crafted anime show. The plot is intriguing, the characters are complex and the issues that are discussed are relevant in today's world of increased reliance on technology. A must-see!",1293926400,,212,5.264705882352941
3522139,5,B001D265RQ,"The original movie in '95 was good, but I'm glad that someone decided move the universe the original movie set forth outside of the self-contained storyline.  They then wrote an amazing series with the material, provided you don't mind a bit of monologue here and there.  The series deserves some special credit for not requiring total suspension of disbelief with regard to it's ""cyberized"" humans concept.  It's an excellent buy I recommend to everyone, fans of anime or not.",1288224000,,477,5.012658227848101
3522140,5,B001D265RQ,"I really liked this series.  All the discs worked on a standard dvd player and I got a great deal (7 discs for $25) and also the second season for $15.  The series starts off a bit slow but it improves steadily.  I watched the main story arc episodes first, which are labeled 'complex'.  It is a great detective mystery mixed with science fiction that keeps you thinking.  I haven't watched all the 'stand alone' episodes but I would reccomend this to anyone who is interested in S.F. or detective stories, or looking for something different and original.  The characters are likeable and stories are always thought provoking if you pay attention.  One thing that improves the series is if you watch parts that you didn't understand, twice.

It shows the animation medium can be on the same realistic level of live-action, but can surpass modern film limitations. For instance a director wants a camera angle, but it takes a few days to set it up, with animation, these ideas transfer quite easily.",1287446400,,998,4.728323699421965
3522141,4,B001D265RQ,"This is a great spy-thriller series with some excellent reflection on a very plausible world of future technology.  This series doesn't get weighed down by the ""philosophy of being"" and instead focuses on a few social philosophies and the impact technology has had on society.
This is very dialogue heavy and requires a fair amount of attention to what is going on.  If you miss something, there are frequent recaps about what is going on.  This season is more about development of the characters and the world.  If you like the story, you may want to check out the second season as well (that one is my favorite).

The only complaint I have about this season is that it has a fair amount of episodes that have VERY little to do with the main story (usually a whole episode for just a tiny detail).  I prefer to have animes that adhere closely to the story arc throughout (again, just personal preference).

Overall, an excellent season.",1287187200,10,937,4.642424242424243
3522142,5,B001D265RQ,"Ghost in the Shell: Season 1 is about Section 13, a division of cybernetic police officers in Tokyo. The first season episodes are self contained, though there is also a story arc that runs throughout the season -- the hunt for the elusive ""Laughing Man"".

It's serious anime; while the antics of the Tachikomas provide some mild comic relief, the show touches on philosophical matters as well as issues about identity and society's lust for technology.",1280361600,2,453,4.9605263157894735
3522143,4,B001D265RQ,"Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, is about a group better known as Section 9 who deals with taking down terrorists.  This episodes in this set deal with a terrorist better known as ""Laughing Man"" and Section 9 tries to uncover who this ""Laughing Man"" is as well as what his motives are.  Each episode I feel is well written and the animation is rather great for any anime that I've ever watched throughout the years.  While this is one of the first animes that I have a chance to watch in recent years but it's one of those that was able to pull me in with it's great storytelling through Season 1's great writing.  The writers of the show outdone themselves with this show.  I give Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Season 1, 4.5 stars out of 5.",1277856000,2,760,4.323943661971831
