This is ABC's complete telecast of the 2007 ROSE BOWL. Presented commercial free, an abbreviated pregame is given while halftime and postgame activities are not offered. Also, an occasional edited huddle is part of the production but by no means overbaringly so. The picture quality is excellent. Not high definition, as another reviewer has already vehemently pointed out, but still excellent for what it is.
2007 Rose Bowl. Good quality. Worth having.",1489363200,,634,5.105769230769231

8159478,3,B000KX0ILS,"The game was presented January 1st on ABC in HIGH DEFINITION. The aspect ratio was very likely 1.77. And so here it is, the dvd of the game is released in GLORIOUS....1.33??? Why on earth would the dvd be released in a standard format when the game was avaiable in both formats, SD and HD. It's not like HD has only been around a year or two. And yet, I've seen that virtually every, repeat EVERY, single DVD of a big game be it football or baseball or whatever is always presented in SD 1.33. It's utterly appalling and I can't imagine the reason for doing this. I understand that all programming will make the switch to HD in 2009 and I can only HOPE that DVD releases by then will be presented in 1.77-1.85 HD. I realize many people don't have HD- hell I didn't have it just a few months ago- but guess what, does that mean that those who DO have HD have to settle for a lesser product. I don't think so. It's unfair. These production companies better get their act together. It's been going on for more years than it should have been.",1196553600,6,1038,4.247474747474747
