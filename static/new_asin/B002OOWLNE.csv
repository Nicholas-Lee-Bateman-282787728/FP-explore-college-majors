8376292,5,B002OOWLNE,"This was THE BEST season of Kathys show,""My life on the D list."" All the big stars were on this year,Bette Midler(This first show was my favorite from Vegas,and Kathy being part of Midlers act)
I also enjoyed Lilly Tomlin,Paula Dean,Rosie,Paris Hilton,Suzann Summers,Barry Manilow,and the many phone calls Griffin made to big stars trying to get a grammy award,Liza Minnelli,Jane Fonda,Snoop Dog,and especially Stevie Nicks.
There's only a couple of shows I have to watch and tape each week,""My life on the D List"" is one of them. I can't wait for season 6.",1253404800,2,557,4.9361702127659575
