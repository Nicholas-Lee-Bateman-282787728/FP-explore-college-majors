8219182,2,B000VKL6U2,The DVD wasn't very entertaining for my 1 year old who loves Ella Jenkins' music.  I found the recording and production quality very poor.,1357084800,,138,4.75
8219183,5,B000VKL6U2,"This is one of the best children's-family concerts ever recorded. In a tribute to Ella Jenkins there is so much aliveness from truly high quality children's performers. A great mix of traditional, original, and multicultural songs, this is a rare treat.

I have personally worked with many of the artists who partcipated here (such as the magnificent Bill Harley), and studied under Cathy and Marcy.

Get out of the mainstream, commerical rut and give your child something grand and precious.",1265328000,,492,5.1375
