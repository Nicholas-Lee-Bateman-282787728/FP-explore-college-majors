2564633,5,B000FGG63Y,"Another reviewer mentioned that this was oversimplified, and, if you're looking for an in-depth, college level exploration of the food in modern Mexican culture, then that might be true.  If you're just looking to get to know about the connection between food and Mexico's Days of the Dead celebrations (as mentioned in the title), this video is excellent.  I teach middle school Foreign Language, and a large percentage of my students were born and attended some school in Mexico before moving to the U.S.  These students LOVED this video because they felt like it was an accurate protrayal of their heritage, while my non-Mexican students LOVED this video just because it is well made, interesting, and fun to watch (I will say that the ""fun to watch"" part did come after me cutting out a lot of what I showed them; it is a very long video, and I just showed them the things directly related to the Days of the Dead...it will get a little tedious for middle or high schoolers if you don't fast foward through certain parts of it).  They especially liked the sections about mole and grasshoppers. :)

So, if you're looking for something simple to introduce young people to the culinary traditions connected with the Days of the Dead, then this is a great video.  If you are looking for something more complex (say, college level), then, I would agree with the previous review and say, ""Keep looking"".",1272499200,20,1401,4.744855967078189
2564634,3,B000FGG63Y,"Interesting look at the role of food in Mexico, but it fails to address important issues such as hunger, malnutrition, and changing diets (fast food, industrial foods, and excess sugar and fat consumption) that are challenging these traditions.",1167782400,,244,5.447368421052632

8122181,5,B000FGG63Y,Interesting and to the point on culture of Mexico.,1457913600,,50,4.666666666666667
8122182,5,B000FGG63Y,"I love this movie for my classroom. I usually show this movie during Dia de Muertos.  Its not too long or too short, yet it gives my students the right amount of information in order for them to understand the meaning and significance of Dia de Muertos",1440892800,,252,4.361702127659575

8122185,2,B000FGG63Y,"It's always a gamble with PBS videos. Often times, they are fascinating, and I get drawn into the subject. Not this time. ""Food for the Ancestors,"" was informational, much like a corporate film. Unfortunately, it was a humorless, bland presentation. The narration was monotonous, the camera work was amateur, and many of the camera shots seemed pointless. It is, no doubt, informative. However, I did not find this entertaining at all.",1375488000,,435,5.140845070422535
8122186,5,B000FGG63Y,Top quality treatment of the material. Have used it in the class room with great success. I recommend the film!,1353456000,,111,4.6
8122187,4,B000FGG63Y,"This wasn't exactly what I was looking for as I was really wanting an in-depth look at just the traditions of Day of the Dead.  However, I bought a few videos on this subject from Amazon and THIS ONE was by far the most informative on Dia de los Muertos and general Mexican Culture.  It also was only 60 minutes, so I can see it being useful for classroom showing.

If Day of the Dead is the subject you're looking for, you'll have to suffer through the culinary approach they take (as the name of the movie implies)...meaning there are lots of scenes were the two guys are scorging the local markets and sampling local delicacies.  But it is interesting to see them eat from a century plant and I won't even mention the bugs.  haha!!!",1317686400,2,735,4.375
8122188,5,B000FGG63Y,I am a Spanish teacher and I have been looking for a good video on Day of the Dead this is the one. I purchased two or three others and this one is by far the best.,1289260800,7,164,3.4594594594594597
