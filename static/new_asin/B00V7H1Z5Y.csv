8709455,5,B00V7H1Z5Y,"When it comes to Internal Energy and Breathing Exercises in combat, Vadim Starov is one of my favorite teachers. Absolutely love his approach, all exercises are easy to follow and result comes after first time of practicing. As a martial artist with years of experience, I would say that concept of tension and relaxation in fighting is crucial. This is probably the most advance technique in combat - being relaxed during the fight and release your tension (inner power) at the last moment of the strike/punches. In this set you won't learn any fighting techniques, it's all about your awareness, your state of mind and your inner balance. Highly recommend to anyone, who wants to work on inner balance, learn different types of breathing and improve your health!!",1428796800,,765,4.984375

Those are extremely important things if you want to become good in self-defense. No matter which martial art style or combat system you are practicing, those Spetsnaz DVDs will only make it better. You do not need to give up on your style. Take the advantage of these DVDs and incorporate it into your style. You will notice the effect after 2 weeks of practice! These techniques are like the hidden gems for any Martial Artists. Do not think twice. Just get them and start practicing!",1427241600,,1005,6.984126984126984
8709457,5,B00V7H1Z5Y,"The First DVD is nice to follow and discover how your breath affects your body and find out that you may not be as relaxed as you thought. The second DVD is extremely useful!!! I'm free-diver doing pranayama and a lot of other breathing techniques, tai-chi, qui-gong... I have feeling that Vadim Starov really knows what he is talking about. He found the essential movements and breathing techniques which are not difficult to implement in ones everyday life. The Third DVD is probably my favorite!! I like it a lot! It is dense with information, every american guy would make at least 10 DVD+s from this stuff and sell it for big money.",1426809600,,637,4.646017699115045
