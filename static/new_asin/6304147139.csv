791784,5,6304147139,"Up Close and Personal does the impossible: it manages to jump from different settings within two hours and shift its plot while keeping the audience wanting more and more. Pfeiffer stars as a reporter, Tally, who  has always aspired to make it to the top in television news. Along the way,  she meets a veteran newsman, Warren Justice (Robert Redford), who gives her  a chance at a reporter. As she begins to mature in her stories and her  thirst for knowledge heightens, she begins to turn heads in the news  business, and ends up moving from a station in Miami to a station in  Philadelphia. All the while, Tally and Warren struggle to keep alive a  relationship that both know is inevitable. Performances from all actors are  very original and heartfelt, under Jon Avnet's wonderful direction. Thomas  Newman's score is brilliant, and fits in at every moment to add to the  emotional appeal of the movie. A storyline that never stops moving at times  keeps the energy alive, which makes this movie one that will please most  people.",954979200,39,1035,4.752808988764045

791788,1,6304147139,"There was a good story in this film, but unfortunately it nearly disappeared under the pygmalion/romance.  Redford's character is tough and determined, but also a man on the way down, because his commitment to truth  and journalism is no longer in vogue.  News has gone from fact-finding to  entertainment and even censorship. To follow his story would have been  magnificent, but they introduced a ditsy, male-dependent blonde (Pfieffer,  proving how poorly she can act) and an absurd story-line of a mature man  who should know better wanting a romance with an aggressive but altogether  mindless chick.  Too much Tally Atwater and her adventures in the  disneyland of modern journalism, too little Warren Justice (strange name)  and his struggles for an ethical standard that we see fading from all  sectors of our culture.  This picture had something to say but got totally  lost.  Redford does his best with a poor script and disinterested  direction.  But even his strong presence and bold presentation cannot make  this film worth viewing.",940809600,5,1046,5.161676646706587
791789,5,6304147139,"Up Close & Personal is a wonderful movie.  Robert Redford and Michelle Pfeiffer have incredible chemistry together. Ms. Pfeiffer plays Tally Atwater, a young woman who wants to be a news reporter.  Mr. Redford plays  Warren Justice, the man who teaches Tally all he knows about the business.  They realize their love when Tally starts to go places.
Tally sends her  resume to stations everywhere, but only WMIA-Miami responds.  Warren hires  her as his secretary, and finally lets her on-screen as the weather girl.  Of course, she fails, but Warren sees her potential.  All her hard work  pays off when she meets Bucky, an agent who sends her to Philadelphia.  Without Warren, though, she can't get the hang of big city news.  Bucky  talks to Warren about Tally, and he soon flies off to join her.
Tally  gets her big network break when she interviews inmates for a special report  on prisons.  While she is there, a jail break occurs.  She is forced to do  nation-wide live broadcasts, while Warren sits on the sides, sometimes able  to communicate with her and sometimes not.
After she goes to the major  network, Warren realizes he needs to get back into the swing of things.  He  decides to investigate how the people of Panama feel about gaining  possesion of the Canal in 1999.  What happens next is the real suprise, so  I'll let you watch to find out!",912038400,14,1360,4.685106382978724

791883,1,6304147139,"Review of Up Close & Personal
Hot Toasty Rag, September 26, 2017

How do you put Robert Redford and Michelle Pfeiffer in a movie together and make it terrible? By writing a God-awful story about a lousy weather girl who wants to be taken seriously as a journalist.

An older, experienced reporter takes her under his wing, and then they fall in love. Its not unbelievable that they fall in loveafter all, they're both beautiful peoplebut Michelle Pfeiffer as a career woman? Not the most credible casting in the world. The script is mediocre, the romance is boring, and the ending is terrible. Plus, youll have to sit through Michelle singing The Impossible Dream in the middle of an empty amphitheater. Singing in Grease 2 and The Fabulous Baker Boys is one thing, but Man of La Mancha is a little out of her talent bracket.",1506384000,,825,4.6438356164383565

I couldn't think she is and that really bothered me from concentrate in her roll.
But after that it was ok.
The two actors didn't connect that well, it was just my thought.
I always liked Michelle Pfeiffer. But not in this movie. It feels like she is doing her roll by pushed by someone.
Robert Redford was good. He is always good no matter what. But since the opposite actor is not, it's all in vain.
The ending came out from nowhere and the reacting for that, Michelle Pfeiffer did her best, but still, I didn't felt her pain that much.
Above all, I thought I wasted my 5$.",1451433600,,698,4.33587786259542

792604,2,6304147139,"I realize that this movie is more about showcasing the romance of the two appealing leads.  However, a more solid story line would have helped to make it a better movie.  The male lead, Warren Justice (Robert Redford), is initially portrayed as a competent, local TV newsman.  Tally Atwater (Michelle Pfeiffer) is his new love interest (who has no experience, just desire).  She skyrockets to the network level, in a very short period of time, after Warren Justice's tutelage and grooming.  Time passes, and she performs poorly at the network level.  Thus, the agent who got her the gig tells Warren that his new love is in trouble, and Warren needs to go help her.  So far, so good.  But then, the movie becomes pretty ridiculous.  Why?  Well, after Warren helps his protoge get back on track, and helps her become successful at the network level, he decides to relocate.  So, he leaves his local TV station in Florida and decides to set up shop in Philadelphia, where he can be near his love --- guiding her, stabilizing her, eventually marrying her, etc.  However, when HE (the experienced, competent, wiser, older) wants a job, no one will hire him!  You see, Mr. Justice used to be a network anchor, but he was known as a difficult maverick back in the day.  Thus, absolutely no one can think of any use for him.  The fact that his protoge surpasses him in ability, competence, and overall appeal is hard enough to swallow; the fact that the man was simply unemployable just wasn't believable... especially when it was clear to everyone (including the agent who asked him to rescue her!) that Warren Justice had given her good training, and that he continued to be of help to her.  Generally, I like romantic movies, but the story itself has to make sense.",1394841600,,1761,4.6688311688311686

I usually like Michele Pfeiffer but somehow she didn't seem right for this part and while she worked fairly well with the other actors, I was left with sort of a disinterested feeling about the movie as a whole. This is the story of a girl working in TV news who frankly, doesn't have a lot of natural talent. She latches on to a grizzled veteran of the TV world who has some issues from his past. As they work their way to the top, they fall in love. While the movie is serviceable, it just didn't quite hit the right tones for me.",1373068800,,653,4.317073170731708

792838,4,6304147139,"There is an advantage when the fare on television is so bland that the box of purchased DVDs comes out of the closet: some of those oldies are so good that they make the current crop of contemporary comedy/drama love stories inept.  Such is the case in viewing the very popular 1996 film UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL, a film whose nidus is Alanna Nash's expos&eacute;  book 'Golden Girl: The Story of Jessica Savitch' adapted and remolded for the screen by no less than Joan Didion and John Gregroy Dunne, under the careful and tidy direction of Jon Avnet,  and starring two of screen's most popular talents Robert Redford and Michelle Pfeiffer.

The film suggests the Jessica Savitch story, the newswoman who, in the 1970's, became the ""First Woman Anchor"". Sally/Tally Atwater (Michelle Pfeiffer) is from the other side of the tracks in Reno who is obsessed with becoming a news star.  She fakes her r&eacute;sum&eacute;, barges into an important television studio run by the indomitable Warren Justice, fakes is and fails as a weather forecaster, yet is so refreshingly purposeful that she is taken under the wing of Warren in a Miami newsroom, given not only a makeover in appearance, but also the chance to make a difference in a news story involving the sad plight of Cuban exiles swimming to freedom in Florida, and becomes a news star on TV. There is a chemistry between the two and despite Warren's tendency to marry and divorce frequently the two fall in love. Yet despite her love for Warren, she takes the big chance and moves on to Philadelphia, where he follows to rescue her faltering career at the cost of his own - as she rises he falls.  It is a love story and more - a Pygmalion reshaping of a true tale.

Both Redford and Pfeiffer look and act great and they are surrounded by a fine cast of extras - Stockard Channing, Kate Nelligan, Joe Mantegna, etc.  Nice to remember when love stories were not just about potty mouth derring-do, but instead were well written and well crafted little films.

792923,2,6304147139,"I see from some of these reviews that some people saw a wonderful love story in this film - I wish I did.  I saw it as very sappy with a storyline so old and overused that the mold could no longer grow on it.  Mentor gives a break to hungry ingenue outsider and falls in love with his creation.  This is the story.  And the pretty blonds that tell the story are R. Redford and Michelle Pfieffer.  End of story.

I was reading that this film is used in journalism ethics teaching because of the extremely false and questionable journalism ethics portrayed in it, in other words, giving journalism a bad name.  It distresses me that it was given even that much import, negative as it is.  When you sit down and watch this film, within the first five minutes you know that it's not going to have anything to do with reality and you either relax and accept that and watch the film, or you retch like I did.  I retched because on top of its' lack of grounding, there is a cutesiness to it that got on my nerves.  I'm not into cutesiness, which ruins a lot of cinema for me because these are the type of films that sell in the states, along with violent, hyper-macho vehicles.  I feel sorry for us people with taste - for us it has to either be the underground or the indies (who've lately been raided by the 'show-biz kids' and are showing signs of the injury) or the imports.

If you are looking for a way to kill 90 minutes and you can stomach this kind of film, go right ahead.  But I feel bad for you polluting your mind this way.",1187049600,3,1529,4.177474402730375

Why do the Oscar voters hate love so much? Is it because they're all shallow phonies out of touch with real human emotion? I think we all know the answer to those questions, right?

Heck, I don't go around calling people names and feeling good about it. But when a film of this caliber is called ""drivel"" by one critic and ""horse manure"" by another. It sort of gets my goat, you see where I'm going with this?

And another thing, just because something has a happy ending doesn't mean it's not an artistic success, understood? I could write all day about how real art needs to reflect life and be honest about the miserableness of life, but who wants to read realistic views like that, you follow?

793023,5,6304147139,"Robert Redford starred in one of the undisputed great romance films of all time, The Way We Were.  Up Close and Personal takes many aspects of this film plus many other great romance classics, like Pygmalion and A Star is Born.

Sally Atwater (Michelle Pfeiffer) is an ambitious woman who wants to break into the nightly news game.  She fakes an audition tape and sends it every news department.  She gets a bite from a small station in Miami.  Channel 9 news is headed by veteran Warren Justice (Redford).  He immediately sees through Sally's disguise but he sees something in her.

Sally keeps on trying and absorbing everything about the news.  And one day, the weatherman walks off and Warren puts Sally on (but changes her name to Tally.)  Tally is an unmitigated flop but according to Warren ""the camera eats her up.""  Warren takes her under his wing and turns her into a first rate journalist.  Eventually, she becomes an anchor.

During a sweeps story at a penitentiary, Tally gets caught up in a prison revolt.  But this gives her a unique opportunity, she is the only reporter on the inside.  Her coverage goes national and she becomes a media sensation.  It's not long before the networks come knocking on her door but Warren has escaped that rat race and is not interested in returning.

With Tally a star, Warren decides that it is time to get back into the game but on his own terms.

This is the return of Redford, the romantic actor.  He proves two decades later he still has it.  Pfeiffer, like her character, was coming still coming up and this helped prove she could handle a romantic lead.  This film also features two great supporting performances from Stockard Channing and Kate Nelligan as two of Warren's exes.

This is a great date film or to watch after a break-up.  And it has the only great Celine Dion song - Because You Love Me.

I love romance, and this movie is entertaining. The storyline kept my interest, and I cried EVERY time I watched it. Each time I watch the movie, I notice more details. When I went to see it at the movies, there wasn't a dry eye in the theater. It was wonderful to see Sally Atwater transform herself into Tally Atwater. She pulled herself up by her boot straps, with a strong, supportive partner by her side. Warren Justice was a strong journalist who refused to sacrifice his integrity or his principles for the network. I liked the way that a clip from one of Redford's movies back in his younger days was used to portray Justice in younger days. The plot and storyline were excellent. I only have one minor detail to speak of. I like Michelle Pfeiffer much better as a blonde. Towards the end of the movie, ""Tally"" had a makeover and became a brunette. Celine Dion's ""Because You Loved Me"" was the perfect theme song for the movie. I had never watched very many of Pfeiffer or Redford's movies before, but this definitely made me a fan. I am a journalist/ writer myself, and the movie was excellent. Stockard Channing was also very good in the supporting role. I definitely give this one five stars. I would highly recommend it to anyone.",1138147200,10,1407,4.565217391304348
793025,4,6304147139,"When the movie is viewed as a love story, it woks because of the oozing charisma of the two leads and also likable enough story albeit formulaic. But the problem is when we look at it as a movie about the news which is not even a problem because no one in the right mind thinks this is a movie about the news, this is not Broadcast News or Network, but the movie keeps on insisting that it is. It's either the director was delusional or in denial. That was probably because the movie was supposed to be darker in tone, that's the original concept because it was going to be based on a true story. But as the filming went along the production decided to lighten up the movie and veered from the original concept not realizing that this is no longer a movie about the news, it's  already a full fledge love story.

Anyway Pfeiffer was luminous. She is just one of the few actresses who continue to soar even with a mediocre material. She was really a delight to see, she is truly a screen goddess. Robert Redford seemed old for the role and it doesn't help that he acts as if he's still doing the prequel of Barefoot in the Park. The duo have great chemistry, and really carried the film together.

This is not a movie for everyone, some may find it really corny and sappy, but for those who are Pfeiffer and Redford fans this is definitely a film to watch, only because this is definitely a star vehicle kind of film. the two stars made the film. Since I am a huge Michelle Pfeiffer (I am under her spell) I really enjoyed this film.

I really want a DVD copy of this movie, because this is the type of movie that I'll never get tired of watching. They have great actors and actresses on the movie. Salute to the director and the main cast! =)",1101254400,7,305,3.857142857142857

793028,2,6304147139,"This movie was interesting enough to keep me watching to the end but I was disappointed. Maybe I missed the point, but it seemed to me that almost nothing about this movie was real. Robert Redford's character wore clothes and had furniture that seemed mostly lifted from the Sundance Catalog. Michelle Pfeiffer's character never seemed to be doing any research but rather staying late at work to play solitaire on her computer. And we later are expected to believe that she gets up from her wedding bed to work at her laptop on a news story. I found it a sad reflection on Hollywood's take on American values and an insult to the viewer's intelligence.",1031961600,3,652,4.678260869565217
793029,5,6304147139,"I honestly cannot see why so many people disliked this movie. It's about a girl who, instead of accepting the life fate has given her, is willing to so anything to make her dreams come true. She doesn't just sit around and dream about it, she gets off her butt and does it, which is probably more than of the reviewers who are dissing her character and calling her weak can say.
I also didn't think the acting was bad at all; it was really good actually. Most of my girlfriends liked this movie. It's kind of a chick flick though.",1031702400,7,530,4.257425742574258
793030,3,6304147139,"I recently happened to see (quite by accident, which I guess is what ""happened to"" implies) Up Close and Personal starring Robert Redford and Michelle Pfeiffer. I was completely against seeing it. It looked positively ridiculous and asinine from commercials, making it seem like a wholly sappy love story between an older man and an up and coming woman (who would of course be nowhere if it weren't for his benevolence and patience). Not to add the terrible Celine Dion theme song. After watching it, however, I realised that while it was not great by any means-a bit better than mediocre entertainment perhaps-it was much better than I expected. Much different from what I expected as well. It was entirely mismarketed. Not to add that STUPID title. Really should be seen to understand what I mean. I don't want to hash out all the plot details because it would just waste your time and mine when you could just watch the movie and find out for yourself. It does have a sad ending, which was also a pleasant surprise. You kind of expect a movie like this to end happily ever after.",1001548800,8,1082,4.640625
793031,5,6304147139,"This movie has two blonde people in it: Robert Redford and Michelle Pfeiffer. Pfeiffer, I think, was in Grease 2.
