2116631,1,B0002S93TO,"This film is so egregiously historically inacurrate. They have taken the world's greatest Roman and convoluted his history, and his dignitas. I am disgusted with the screenwriters. However, Hollywood will be Hollywood. The will continue to screw things up so bad just for the sake of entertainment. They nearly forty years of history and cram it all into a mere ten. They made an effort to make it look like Rome, but far too many things were off. The true story of Gaius Julius Caesar's rise to power and his assasination will take SIX films, all of which, two and half to three hours a piece. This is truly a piece of crap. For starters, Gauis Julius Caesar was blonde. If you can't get that right, why even try?",1123027200,12,714,4.542635658914729
2116632,4,B0002S93TO,"No one expects commercial films to portray ancient history accurately, and this is no exception. However, the film is largely true to the spirit of Rome at the end of the Republic, with outstanding sets and costumes.

As noted by other reviewers, much is condensed or omitted. The central figure of Crassus, whose patronage was essential to Caesar's rise, is entirely absent. In effect, Crassus is merged with Pompey in this film, and the triumvirate of Pompey/Crassus/Caesar is reduced to a partnership between Pompey and Caesar. Also omitted is any direct reference to Spartacus, and here his Slave Revolt is merged with Pompey's campaign to clear the Mediterranean of pirates. At a more personal level, the film omits all references to Caesar's philandering (which included the mother of Brutus) as well as his balding with advancing age. And in this film Caesar is murdered in the old Senate-house in the Forum, not the new complex built by Pompey outside the city walls.

On the positive side, Rome itself as depicted in the sets (mostly constructed in Malta, not digitally generated) is convincing: note that Rome in Caesar's time was largely built of brick and was not endowed with huge buildings or large open spaces. The military are also convincingly depicted, with the exception that the cavalry in the film use stirrups (but it is difficult today to find equestrian actors who can ride without stirrups). And there is much to please the sharp-eyed. For example, although the dialog does not mention Caesar's role as chief priest (Pontifex Maximus) and guardian of the Vestal Virgins, we see the Vestals officiating at his marriage to Calpurnia. And although the office of Consul is not really explained, we see the lectors and other paraphernalia in the background. Such details reward the careful observer.

I do not agree with other reviewers who have written that ancient Rome is better depicted in such blockbuster films as Ben Hur, Quo Vadis and Gladiator. All of these tend toward hyperbole in sets and spectacle. Gladiator is highly accurate in its recreation of the Coliseum, but not in the Forum and other oversized public buildings. Ben Hur and Quo Vadis exaggerate even more: in the time (mid first century CE) when these two films are set, almost none of the great public buildings whose ruins still stand in Rome had yet been constructed. The most accurate film portrayal of the heart of imperial Rome is in The Fall of the Roman Empire, which faithfully follows what we know of the layout of the Forum and the Capitol. But that was the city more than two centuries after Caesar. For a glimpse of the Rome of the first century BCE, I enjoyed this TNT film.",1122854400,10,2681,4.875
2116633,5,B0002S93TO,"I think this is a very wonderful movie. It recreated the story of Juluis Caesar very well. Although I would have chosen different actors, the ones that were used did a very good job. There were a few historical mistakes though. The leader of the Gauls was acctually strangeled, not stabbed. Caesar was killed on the steps of the senate, not inside.

I would have liked to see more on Caesar's love affair with Cleopatra.",1121040000,4,420,4.6
2116634,3,B0002S93TO,"Overall this is a good film. The potryal was wonderful.

What angered me the most was how they made Cleopatra! OMG! Could it be any more Hollywood?!?!?!?  She was GREEK first of all!  She would have NEVER dressed like that, unless it was at a ritual, or banquet.",1111536000,6,262,4.416666666666667
2116635,4,B0002S93TO,"This movie is a good partayal of the life of Caesar.  It is not as historically innaccurate as some may believe.

Caesar's early life is not well documented in history because he was not important.  Granted, his uncle was Marius, but Marius had no plans for Caesar.  Caesar's arrest and meeting with Sulla may not be recorded, but it is highly probable that it occurred.  His father-in-law fled Sulla's men in Rome and Caesar may have had something to do with it, therefore Sulla would want to know.  Crassus' absence is because he played no major role in Caesar's rise to power.  His own wealth was more important.  Crassus was commissioned to put down the slave revolt, but Pompey was called back anyway.  At the final defeat of Spartacus, Crassus had already won the battle when Pompey arrived and killed most of the remaining rebels.  He returned to Rome before Crassus, with prisoners, so there was no reason for anyone to beleive Crassus had really won the battle.  When Crassus went to conquer Parthia, he was given the Cavalry by Rome, not Caesar.

This movie is not overly violent, unlike most modern depictions of ancient warfare.  The filmakers choose to focus on the tactical expertise of Caesar, rather than his physical might.  The point is not that his men fought, but rather that he placed them well.  This movie portrays the battle order of the romans well.  It also shows the difference in the method of waging war between Rome and Gaul.  The Romans fight as a unit; well ordered and mobile.  The Gauls use the brute force of their men whom, once committed, will either win, or retreat in disorder.  This movie shows well the tactical difference between the Romans and Gauls.

The omission of the British campain is probably due to time constraints.  This was most likely the time when Caesar realised he could not conquer the known world, as he promised in Cornelia's eulogy, unless he had control of Rome.  The movie makes this turning point at Julia's death.

The filmakers did a good job melding the accounts of Plutarch, Caesar, and Shakespere, among others, to make this epic drama.  All accounts from this time have their own bias, so one must be prudent in whom one believes.  The use of extras to portray the two armies at Alesia is superb.  The performance of Christopher Walkin as Cato, the last Republican, is wonderful.  The speeches of Mark Antony and Caesar are both very well done.  The difference of style is well shown.  The deaths of Vercingetorix and Caesar have many historical grey areas, however, these are due to difference in accounts or lack thereof.

Overall this is a wonderful drama that none should miss!

If nothing else, this is Richard Harris' last film.  How can you miss it?",1110153600,7,2727,4.7239915074309975
2116636,5,B0002S93TO,"Jeremy Sisto gives the most compelling performance of his career. This movie was an excellent Roman epic and I enjoyed it tremendousley! Although much of the history was inaccurate and would be difficult for someone anal about that sort of thing to watch they should remember that its not a documentary but instead an excellent film on the life of Caesar. Sure in real history Cato hated Pompey and in the movie they appear to be friends, sure Crassus doesn't make an appearance, and Pompey's heroic son Sextus isn't even mentioned but the movie gets the character of Caesar right and Sisto gives an inspiring performance perhaps the best I've seen as Caesar! The siege of Alesia was also exceptionally depicted and the actor who played Marc Antony did excellent in his oratory not coming off cheesey which is a hard thing to do. I enjoyed this movie, and forget about historical accurateness its hollywood I'm happy they nailed the character of each man well especially Caesar.",1110153600,8,978,4.862275449101796
2116637,4,B0002S93TO,"Julius Caesar: His Time Has Come, brings to the screen the rise to power of one of the most well known historical figures.

It is a rather long movie, approximately 3 hours, but that is to be expected considering who the movie is about.

Overall, the acting is above average, with the highlights being Christopher Walken and Chris Noth portraying a Roman Senator and the Roman General Pompeii respectively.

The siege of Alesia and the subsequent battle were also very good as was the portrayal of the Gauls.

On the negative side and as other reviewers have also pointed out, the lead actor, Jeremy Sisto, was not really the best choice for Caesar, as was the case with Marc Anthony who was also a poor choice.

In addition, there are historic discrepancies such as the in case of the Gaul chieftain Vercingentorix who was reportedly strangled, and not stabbed as the movie would have it.

Furthermore, Julius Caesar is to have perished on the Senate steps, not while sitting inside the Senate.

Nevertheless, the setting, the dialogues and the costumes are all wonderful!

In a nutshell, though not a masterpiece, Julius Caesar: His Time Has Come will surely provide for an evening's entertainment.  It is a movie definitely worth watching, especially for those with a soft spot for History and all things Roman.",1105142400,47,1314,4.856502242152466
2116638,1,B0002S93TO,"Don't waste your time in this film, it is one of the most innacurate historical films I ever saw. Suffice to mention the fact that during his lifetime, Caesar's best friend was Crassus, the richest man in Rome, who was SO IMPORTANT that when Caesar had to share the supreme power, before going to Gaul, he formed a Triumvirate, composed of himself, Pompeii and Crassus. The latter also was Caesar's major financing means until Caesar got back from Gaul as a rich man. Well, this film just ""deletes"" Crassus from History, and he doesn't appear at all. The screenplay is so confused, trying for some reason to avoid mentioning Crassus, that when they show briefly the revolt of the slaves - led by Spartacus, but also no mention of Spartacus' name - the man who crushed the rebellion was...you guessed it, Crassus. During the campaign against Spartacus, one of Crassus' Legions fled scared from combat with Spartacus' troops, and he is one of the major examples of a Roman General who ""Decimated"" the Legion. The punishment of Decimare, or Decimate, in English, consisted in dividing the Legion in groups of ten men (Decimus=Ten in Latin) and in each group of ten one was randomly picked to be killed by the other nine. After Crassus did this, none of his legions ever again fled from combat, and he crushed the rebellion, and crucified all the survivors, planting the crosses along the 100 miles of the Via Apia, one cross every few feet, from Rome to Ostia.

  In this awful film, the victor of the rebellion of the slaves is shown to be Pompeii - who NEVER fought Spartacus.

  The old Dictator Sulla is shown as a half crazy old man, despotic,  having died during a bath, when in reality he was ruthless, yes, but not mad or power-crazy. In reality he made all the necessary changes in the Roman Senate and Government - during the process proscribing and allowing many people to be killed, yes, but then abdicated, returned to being a private citizen, retired to his villa away from Rome, where he enjoyed his last years among young boys and books, and died of old age.

  The film shows Caesar being arrested by Sulla, which NEVER happened. Romans had no prisons as punishment for crimes. Either they killed and crucified the culprit, or sent him for life away from Rome, or he was considered innocent.

  If you want to understand Sulla, Crassus, Pompeei, Caesar, Cleopatra, don't waste your time in this badly made film, better read the whole series of THE FIRST MAN IN ROME, by Coleen MacCoulough, which is the best series of historical novels I ever read",1101859200,25,2561,4.67706013363029
2116639,1,B0002S93TO,"Here's some good advice: don't waste your money on this DVD or VHS !!!

If you've read Plutarch or Caesar's military memoirs, you will be very gravely dissapointed at this film.  For some odd reason, Hollywood makes better ROMAN EMPIRE movies than they do make ROMAN REPUBLICAN movies even though there are great stories that occured during the times of the Republic: like stories concerning Judas Maccabeus in the Apocrypha or the war with Hannibal written in 10 books by Livy.

These four movies are unparalled for historical understanding and emotional detail: The Passion of the Christ (starring Jim Caviezel), Gladiator (starring Russel Crowe), and Attila (starring Gerard Butler).  And let's not forget Ben Hur (starring Charletan Heston)--although I didn't see this last movie yet, but I've heard that it is a first rate movie.  There is a great deal of historical drama in all of these wonderfully made movies; however, I strongly caution parents about letting their young children watching Gladiator and Attila--especially since the latter has quite a bit of lewd scenes in it.  Attila shows two large battle scenes that are better than anything in Julius Caesar or the new Spartacus film.  Attila is better than JC or Spartacus in terms of acting and scenery and action--it's seems so pointless that I wasted my time and money on Julius Caesar and the new Spartacus.

Although I don't want to overly criticize the performance of Jeremy Sisto, it takes more than a cool and determined looking demeanor to walk in the shoes of Julius Caesar, or atleast to put on a good show of trying to be like Caesar.  The battles in Gaul (if you call those battles) were basically a joke and a half.  If your looking for the real Julius Caesar in this film, you will be sadly let down.  It's better to just watch the four great movies on the Roman times that I have just mentioned above.  By the way, Powers Boothe makes a far better Roman general than Jeremy Sisto.",1100995200,9,1961,4.786350148367952
2116640,4,B0002S93TO,"This TNT production on the life of Julius Caesar is a well made attempt to historically portray the life of one of history's greatest leaders.  Starring Jeremy Sisto, it follows the life of the future Dictator of Rome from his relative obscurity to his death at the hands of his peers on the Senate floor on the Ides of March in 44BC.

The story covers the highlights of Caesar's life including his exile during the rule of the cruel dictator Sulla, his patronage under the capable General Pompey, his brutal but victorious campaigns against Vercingetorix and the Gauls, and his love affair with the beautiful and scheming Egytian queen Cleopatra.  Caesar's great ambition ultimately lead to his own murder by members of the Roman Senate who fear his ascendency, but ironically bring about the rise of the Empire.

There are many political complexities that are touched upon in this film that give a good idea of the kinds of power plays that lead to Caesear's rise and fall, many of them including betrayal and murder.  The film depicts the Gallic Wars in good detail and gives an understanding of the turmoil that faced the Roman Republic in its last years before the rise of the Empire.  Caesar is portrayed as a intelligent human figure who is struck down by tragedy and overcome with amibition which ultimately leads to his own death.  The irony of Caesar's murder is that it was ostensibly to preserve the Republic, but rather hastened the foundation of the Empire.  While not a great movie, it is entertaining and provides a good introduction to Roman history as well.",1099958400,108,1575,4.785977859778598

2116644,5,B0002S93TO,"Caesar is a television mini-series about the life of Julius Caesar. It is a dramatization of the life of Julius Caesar through 82 BC to his death in 44 BC. The film stars Jeremy Sisto in the title role of Caesar together with Richard Harris,Christopher Walken,Valeria Golino,Chris Noth and Pamela Bowen. It is mostly historically accurate and being one of the last two films of the legendary actor,Richard Harris being released in the year of his death. It was directed by Uli Edel, and written by Peter Pruce and Craig Warner.

Caesar is an ambitious, four-hour miniseries of TNT that tells the story of the Roman general-turned-emperor Julius Caesar. It traces his rise to prominence as a brilliant military tactician; his complex relationships with his mentor General Pompey and his second wife Calpurnia; his ideological battles with Senator Cato, who advocates democracy over Caesar's dictatorial ambitions; and his bloody and inevitable murder at the hands of former friends and allies. Taking some dramatic license with the facts, it is basically sympathetic to its subject, although Caesar is depicted as a flawed man, both physically and morally. Giving Caesar points for being fundamentally honorable, in full possession of his faculties, and possessing the ""common touch"" with the Roman citizenry, the TV movie does not shrink away from the man's violent epileptic seizures, his megalomania, his casually calculated cruelties, and his bigamous relationship with Egyptian queen Cleopatra. However, the miniseries downplays his notorious bisexuality.

Caesar is a delight from beginning to end. It tells one man's story with energy and vitality. Also,it was obviously a big budget TV production that the battle scenes were shot with remarkable accuracy. Aside from the scenes mentioned,the it tries to be accurate to detail as it covers many aspects in the life of the Roman dictator. The cast was also brilliant in this TV movie as well.

Overall,it was a pleasure to view Caesar as it was both entertaining and informative.",1418601600,,2034,5.252307692307692

2116653,3,B0002S93TO,"Ancient Rome was a model for civilization that cultures have followed ever since. It was also entirely brutal and pagan, but when the Roman Empire took over much of the world, it allowed Christianity to spread through a common speech. Seventy years before a significant baby was born in a manger, Julius Caesar became one of Rome's most influential figures and fought his way into the history books.

The law of Rome states that an army cannot march into the confines of the city. But the law means nothing to those with power. Lucius Sulla (Richard Harris) has just taken over the empire, marching his men into the senate and black listing all those who have opposed him in the past. Thousands are fleeing his heavy-handed regime, among them the father in law of Julius Caesar (Jeremy Sisto). In an attempt to save the man's life, Caesar is captured by Sulla's armies and imprisoned. Having heard of his legacy, Sulla has him brought in for trial. Liking the young man's impertinence, Sulla offers him the opportunity to live, if he will but divorce his ""tainted"" wife. Too passionately in love with his beloved to consider such a thing, Caesar adamantly refuses. Impressed by his frank adoration, Sulla allows him to go free, but then tells his general Pompey (Christopher North) to have Caesar assassinated in the morning.

Instead of carrying through his command, Pompey gives his signet ring to the young man and tells him to flee the province. Caesar does as he is told, and returns several years after Sulla's sudden death. Pompey is now the voice of reason and force in Rome, much to the disappointment of the senators, among them Marcus Cato (Christopher Walken) and other ""men of the common wealth."" Rome's empire is threatened from all sides and Pompey, now Consul, takes an army to victory on the battlefield. Returning bathed in glory, his romantic eye falls on Julia (Nicole Grimaudo), Caesar's beloved and beautiful daughter. Their friendship has grown strong in the passing years, and he is not opposed to the marriage, but desires to accumulate something from it. Wanting to prove himself in battle and earn honor through victory, Caesar allows Julia to be married to Pompey in exchange for the use of his armies in Gaul, where a revolution has been sparked.

While Caesar's name flows from every mouth in the empire, the senators are growing uneasy, knowing that he could easily overtake Rome and become the next dictator. Ultimately through loss, love, and triumph, Caesar will be turned against his dearest friend, betray his wife with a beautiful Egyptian temptress, and have his blood shed on the pages of history. This miniseries does an ample job of covering numerous years in the general's life. My only true complaint is that sometimes it can be confusing, since there's no direct implication of time passing, only mention of it in dialogue. One minute, Caesar is a bright-eyed youth, the next his hair is gray. It could have used a little polishing, but overall the production is very worthwhile, particularly if you want a crash course in Ancient History. It revolves around Caesar, which means that time spent with significant other individuals in the time period, such as Marc Anthony and Cleopatra, is limited, and leaves the audience hungering for something more.

I found this production highly entertaining, very informative about the era, and generally acceptable, if sometimes very rushed. I would have liked more character development in his relationship with Cleopatra and the social implications that followed. But as it stands, Julius Caesar is an interesting glimpse into a bygone society.",1332374400,2,3630,4.9752883031301485

Also, they will become more emotionally attached to Caesar with prior knowledge about his rise to power.

2116660,5,B0002S93TO,"The movie Caesar concluded a few years ago on TNT. It was a historical film documenting Julius Caesar's life and achievements. Besides Caesar the other key characters in the film are Pompeii, Sala, Cato, Brutus, Cassius, Cleopatra, Carnelia, Julia, Calpania, and Mark Anthony, all of whom played a significant role in Caesar's life. It weaves various stages of Caesar's meteoric rise and fall into a single exciting movie. At the same time the movie gives us an insight into the relationship of the Senate with the dictator of Rome. The strife-ridden Roman society and the paramount importance of a strong military at that time can be underscored. It highlights the threats posed to the Roman Empire from its neighbors and pirates at that time. The movie also dwells upon the intertwining of military and political power in the time of a fluid political situation in Rome and the people's desire for a stable government. It hints at the enormous size of the Roman Empire in Caesar's time. It gives us glimpses into the workings of Roman society as well as its economy and culture. It can be easily inferred that at that time trade was an intrinsic part of Roman economy. It gives us a peek about the status of women and the gullibility of the general populace in Roman society. Most of this historical movie makes the viewer participate in the history of the contemporary epoch by implicitly stating information.

The film captures the martial spirit and reckless plunder and conquest of the pre-Christian Roman Empire. The movie underlines the pivotal role of army commanders in Roman society in the times of Julius Caesar and prior to that. At this time Rome was ridden with friction with its neighbors. The pirates often captured Roman ships laden with grain and wealth. Rome in 82 B.C. was subjected to protracted warfare. Rome's boundaries were uncertain and constantly changing. Military generals of foreign countries plundered Rome with impunity and Roman citizens lived in a state of perpetual terror. Rome's wealth was frittered away in extravagant and destructive military purposes. Fratricidal skirmishes were common. Peace had become non-existent in Rome. Wealthy military despots and senators ruled Rome's commoners and slaves. The people were so-called indirectly represented by an elitist and selfish Senate that constantly bickered with the dictator and his armies. In reality the majority of the plebeian citizens had little say in the political process.

The movie opens by dwelling on Caesar's many trysts with danger to his life and how he overcame them. In doing so the film brilliantly portrays some of the important traits of Caesar's personality and character. The film starts by showing Caesar being blacklisted in 82 B.C. by the tyrant Sala for aiding his enemies. Nothing about his life before 82 B.C. is told in the film. Julius Caesar was a commoner. He was reverent towards his mother and doting towards his wife Carnelia and daughter Julia. His wife Carnelia had a lot of influence over his actions. Sala blacklisted him as he had sided with his enemies. Despite his humble origins he was proud of his ancestry and claimed to be of divine descent. He was bold, courageous and forthright in his beliefs. The film chronicles these traits of Caesar's personality when Caesar stood his ground firmly even in the face of grave danger. Despite Sala's ultimatum Caesar refused to divorce his wife. With the help of Pompeii, a Roman military general, and the urging of his wife Carnelia, Caesar finally escaped Rome and traveled abroad for many years. By the time Caesar returned, Pompeii had become the head of state.

Caesar had bought a slave called Apylonius during his journey in a province of the Roman Empire. The slave was an intellectual who was well read in Greek classics, literature, philosophy and politics. He had bought the slave to teach his daughter Julia. In telling this story the film throws light on Roman economy and society. The overwhelming majority of slaves and their labor was the bulwark of the Roman Empire. This was indubitable, as the tyrants of Rome had conquered many nationalities over a period of time and enslaved their citizens. The slaves were denied citizenship in the Roman Empire. They were denied the rights and privileges granted to the citizens of Rome. They were the workhorses of the Roman Empire. It is upon their backbreaking productive labor, and trade that Rome's military and legislative establishment and plebeian citizens enjoyed a parasitic existence. All necessities and luxuries were initially distributed among the upper crust of Roman society namely the military and political establishments before going to the citizens. Slaves were an indispensable part of the Roman economy. Slaves were intellectuals and some of them were kept in Roman households for educational purposes, thereby playing an important role in the education of its citizens. Women in Rome did not wear veil and attended parties and had social status but were denied access to political and military establishments. It was extremely difficult for the plebeian citizens to enter into politics. Rome's republican tradition and culture bore resemblances to the Greek civilization. It can be inferred that Roman society was highly stratified and the Roman economy epitomized inequality.

Upon Caesar's return to Rome he was greeted with misfortune in the family as his wife passed away moments after his arrival. His return would be the harbinger of momentous events in the history of Rome. The film also makes a telling commentary on the political ambitions of Caesar and how he realized them. Caesar understood that winning the support and hearts of the people was the sine qua non of political legitimacy. Caesar used the demise of his wife to win the affection of the people. He juxtaposed feelings of his heart, plainspoken oratory skills and tact to win over the hearts of the plebeian citizens of Rome. He gained access to politics with Pompeii's backing. He exerted his oratory influence on the Senate and persuaded the Senate to unite behind Pompeii and permit Pompeii and his army to launch an onslaught on the pirates who disrupted Roman trade and economy. He used his oratory skills to express his concern for Rome's welfare as well as further his political advancement. Subsequently Pompeii went off on a military mission but before leaving Rome he named Caesar as the stand-in-consul. During this period of Pompeii's long absence in politics Caesar wielded considerable power over matters of the state. Later in the movie Mark Anthony's address to the citizens vindicated Caesar's commitment to the people's welfare during the time he was the stand-in-consul. Caesar commissioned projects for public welfare in this time when he was the stand-in-consul and in doing so, often took decisions without ratification of the Senate. This revealed his independent-minded personality and his scant respect for the Senate. It is in this period that Caesar made many enemies amongst a large section of the Senate, which included influential Senators like Cato and Cassius.  In spite of his absolute authority Caesar never flinched in matters of honesty and integrity. He never aggrandized personal wealth from state revenue.  In the meantime Caesar had wedded Calpania and Julia had grown into a fine woman.

After Pompeii returned to Rome, Caesar arranged a marriage between his daughter Julia and Pompeii, who was smitten with love for Julia, in exchange for a large part of Pompeii's armies. Caesar and Julia shrewdly arranged this compromise to further Caesar's political ambitions of becoming head of state, as he knew that military glory was a passport to becoming dictator. The movie again showed Caesar's single-minded purpose of becoming the head of state and the lengths he would go to achieve his goal.

The next part of the movie typifies Caesar's brilliant military strategies. Caesar set out foot abroad to conquer new lands and defend Rome against its hostile enemies and pirates who would play havoc with Rome's peace and prosperity. Caesar proved to be the greatest military commander Rome ever witnessed. He surpassed Pompeii's magnificent generalship. He fought for many years against various peoples like the Gauls and others. This showed his perseverance and tenacity.  He stood out as an outstanding and tolerant general. He won wars through strategy when his army was outnumbered by the enemy and received little support from Rome. He conquered many nationalities and enlarged Rome's boundaries more than any dictator had ever done. He defeated belligerent opponents but made peace whenever possible. His share of misfortune increased in this period as his daughter and newborn grandchild passed away. However, he endured his share of tragedy.

The movie also portrayed the jealousies, anxieties and fears of Rome's political incumbents when they realized Caesar's successful conquests would culminate in Caesar becoming consul. Around this time Pompeii declared war on Caesar and Cato too adorned military garb to challenge Caesar's claim to consulship. However when they heard Caesar had crossed the Rubicon they refrained from warring with him and instead fled Rome to gain temporary refuge. Caesar got a grand reception from the plebeian citizens of Rome. This part of the film shows Caesar's closeness to the people and political astuteness. He became the head of state but refused the title of consul and preferred to be called Caesar. He knew he derived his power from the people and did not want to distance them from himself. He was the people's democratic dictator as opposed to the tyrants prior to his ascendancy to Rome's supreme seat. The film also depicts Caesar's mercifulness and compassion when he did not blacklist the senators who were rabidly against him becoming dictator. Caesar had brought peace and prosperity to the people of Rome by overwhelming Rome's enemies. He united the people of Rome. Rome was a wealthy Empire at the time of Caesar. There were also extensive education, religious and entertainment institutions created for the plebeian citizens of Rome due to Caesar's administrative and military efforts. However he had unquestioned and absolute authority in matters of state.

Caesar had to however settle issues with Pompeii who had fled Rome. Caesar named his lieutenant and second-in-command Mark Anthony as his stand-in replacement for the time he was tracking down Pompeii and fighting against him. Caesar marched again with his armies to fight his rivals. Caesar found Pompeii's camp where Brutus was in charge of a part of Pompeii's army, Caesar's nephew was in charge of Pompeii's camp as Pompeii had left for Egypt unarmed. Caesar spared Pompeii's army commanders and soldiers. The film again showed Caesar's compassionate nature. Another part of Pompeii's armies was with Cato. Caesar asked Brutus to head back to Rome and promote Caesar's image of a benevolent dictator. Caesar marched with his armies to Egypt to meet Pompeii. In the meantime Pompeii was murdered in Egypt. Caesar and his armies were welcomed in Egypt by power-wielding statesmen. Egypt's king had died suddenly around this time and Egypt's political and social situation was in flux. An adolescent boy and girl were jointly made king and queen but seasoned statesmen wielded power and the teenage monarchs were pawns in the sordid game of brinkmanship. This part of the film showcases Caesar as a shrewd statesman with a considerable foresight. Caesar was disappointed to find Pompeii murdered but granted Egypt the status of an independent country in return for monetary tribute to Rome and unwavering loyalty. Caesar intervened in the political instability of Egypt and restored power to the royal authority. Caesar strengthened his political situation and decided to keep power in the family by marrying the Egyptian Queen Cleopatra and begetting a son from her. Before returning to Rome Caesar overwhelmed Cato's armies. Cato had refused to recognize Caesar's dictatorship till the end. Cato could not bear the ignominy of defeat and the humiliation of surrendering to Caesar and to avoid shame committed suicide. The film also showed the cunning and persuasive influence of the Senate on Brutus. By the time Caesar had returned to Rome the Senate had poisoned the ears of Brutus by saying that Caesar was going to convert Rome to a monarchy. Brutus however was not convinced about Caesar's motives and demanded proof.

Rumors of Caesar's affair with Cleopatra were rife in Rome and had traumatized Calpania. Calpania did not give Caesar a warm welcome when he returned. She remained his wife but refused to have sexual relations with him. Caesar and Cleopatra received a grand reception from the plebeian citizens of Rome. On this occasion Caesar's and Cleopatra's infant son was revealed. This convinced Brutus that Caesar wanted to keep power in the family. Brutus was an idealist who thought that Caesar was going to violate the tradition and promise of a republic and decided that murdering Caesar would be the only solution to Rome remaining a republic.

The last part of the movie shows treachery and betrayal. Brutus decided to take the plunge to murder Caesar. He arrived at a plan to murder Caesar. He told the envious Senators about his plan to murder Caesar next morning where the Senators would form a ring in the Senate and stab Caesar once. Lest the conspiracy failed to materialize or was exposed each of the participants would stab themselves to death. On the next day before Caesar went to the Senate his wife Calpania warned him that she had a premonition about Caesar being slaughtered to death and urged him not to go. However Caesar was persuaded to go to the Senate by Brutus. Calpania's nightmare came true when many senators including Brutus murdered Caesar in the Senate. With the murder of Julius Caesar on the Ides of March the lives of one of the greatest generals and statesmen on earth came to an end.

The movie ends with the murder of Caesar. The movie was well made and captured the spirit, culture, economy, society, and politics of Republican Rome in its entire splendor. The actors have acted out their parts well. The setting and direction of the movie resembles the Roman Empire as told and visualized by historians and archaeologists. The costumes worn by the actors capture the fashion prevailing at that time. However, the movie suffers from lack of sufficient information, so vital in a historical movie to viewers who are not familiar to Roman history. Much of the movie expects the viewer to know and infer information. The movie makes no reference to Caesar's background and early life before 82 B.C.  The movie tells us nothing about Roman history prior to 82 B.C. No information is given about the origins of the Roman Empire. There is no geographical description in the movie describing the size of the Roman Empire and the nationalities, which it had engulfed within it. The movie does not say anything about the items of trade. The movie also gives scanty information about the enemies of Rome. The movie ends abruptly with the death of Caesar and makes no reference to the history of the Roman Empire after Julius Caesar and also the fact that Caesar became the title for Emperor on Julius Caesar's death. However, despite its shortcomings the movie was enjoyable.",1245369600,8,15410,5.095011876484561
2116661,4,B0002S93TO,"You know what? This movie actually works! No need to waste time on historical plot line, it is accurate as much as these things can be (many characters play diminished roles due to time constraints, its not an exhaustive history of the man, mind you). Other than Richard Harris' brief role the cast is questionable (at least the males) but the acting is there and competent. This isn't a masterpiece but a decent enough flick on the man. You see both sides of Caesar hopeful tyrant, brilliant tactician, man of integrity. But they do not allocate anytime towards political and social reform and progresses under his brief rule. If you like Roman histories watch this, destine the wow factor missing.

By the way, I perhaps should have `3 star' it, but couldn't. It seems as if 3 would have marked it as a bad movie, when it wasn't. There aren't happy mediums for some movies; Like Chinatown., either a 5 or a 1... so in that spirit I hope you know what I mean?",1243382400,3,960,4.517241379310345

As a lover of Rome, I found the story to be very historically accurate, which is always a nice thing for a history geek like me.  Furthermore, the script was so full of depth and heart that I actually found myself crying at Caesar's death.

2116667,3,B0002S93TO,"Recently I saw Jeremy Sisto in a film in the cinema, and as my movie-going friend and I were dissecting the film afterward, we both were impressed with Sisto's performance, and tried to recall what we'd seen him in before. I remembered this production of Julius Caesar, but only after a while - Sisto's role in the other film (a light drama with a comedic edge) is very different from the epic, super-serious Julius Caesar.

This production is a good one for a straight-to-television production. It is a four-hour miniseries (the television nomenclature equivalent for `epic'). It plays a bit loose with the historic progression, but keeps many of the broad strokes intact - Rome's trouble under Sulla, Caesar's early difficulties becoming established, his military alliance and familial partnership with Pompey, destined to falter; the conquest of Gaul and the march back to Rome, the fiery oratory of Cato, and the climactic death in the Senate.

Caesar is a complex character, one who defies encapsulation in so short a span as four hours. Given that Caesar was surrounded by many equally intriguing characters, it is little wonder that productions about Caesar often fall victim to a particular interpretation. Sisto's performance, and Edel's direction, makes Caesar in some ways a walking statue - and this is not a necessarily inappropriate style. Caesar was very conscious of appearances and public perceptions, and took great pains to always appear in a certain fashion that would enhance his power and reputation. Sisto's Caesar does show such some emotional range, but this is often mitigated by `events of state'.

Richard Harris, in one of his final performances as Sulla, puts in a much more dynamic performance, however brief; some may recall Harris as the wise emperor Marcus Aurelius in `Gladiator' a few years prior to this production, a very different role indeed from the ambitious, capricious and over-emotional Sulla. Christopher Walken as Cato also turns in an almost over-the-top performance (Cato and Cicero seem to be a combined character here, in some respects). Christopher Noth plays Pompey, but does so at extremes - he is either flat and ineffective, or overly emotional and ineffective. Noth has done good work elsewhere, but this is not one of his better pieces.

The female characters in this production are largely marginalized; even the famous Cleopatra/Caesar affair in minimized. While the role of Cleopatra is often overplayed in the Caesar story, it does have a decided role. Also, the role of Augustus is completely missing.

Filming was done in Malta and in Bulgaria, which brought in lots of locals into the production. A replica of the Roman Forum was constructed, which is an impressive piece of scenery. Also, the Gaul encampment, where Caesar overcomes Celtic warriors, is well constructed and visually powerful. German actor Heino Ferch plays the role of the Celtic leader with aplomb. In scenes where he appears, he steals the show so completely that no Caesar could resist.

It is interesting that the television series, `Rome', is currently enjoying a major success with essentially the same time period. This could have been a great epic / mini-series; instead, it is passing fair. Costumes are great, sets and location good. The story line is interesting, even if out of sync with actual history. The performances are spotty but occasionally effective. The writing takes the story along, but almost as if it were a rendering about Rome and Caesar than a piece for actors to perform in.

Those who like the `sword and sandals' kind of film will find this interesting. Others may find it tolerable. Those who are easily irritated at historical inaccuracies of detail may well find this film infuriating, as lots of bits are rearranged for dramatic effect. Even so, it is an epic that might be worth a rainy day or night's viewing.

There are no real DVD extras to speak of, at least not on the copy I have.",1181520000,19,3956,5.0198170731707314

2116669,5,B0002S93TO,"I, for one, found this movie to be an excellent sort of etertainment, both for the movie enthusiast as well as one interested in Roman History. I must admit, I was a bit worried being that it was a TV miniseries but I queued it up on Netflix regardless. About 14 minutes into the film, I realized what set this apart from other movies based on history or that attempt to portray historical situations. Julius Caesar is not an easy topic, despite the information we have on him, yet this series pulled it off with stars and stripes.

People have claimed, in these reviews, that Jeremy Sisto did not do that great of job. I believe I am a more critical...critic in that I had high expectations considering that I would never want to see him outside his role in Six Feet Under as the crazed Billy. Nonetheless, his performance grew from miniseries appropriate to bigscreen legend. In the beginning, Caesar is played as a humble man who gets in much trouble still trying to find out his destiny yet when he does find his destiny, Sisto conveys everything you'd hope: a passion for Rome and also some bit of grandeur for himself. I would give his performance 5 stars alone.

Not to mentioned Harris, Walken, and Noth who were all very shocking in the performance (in the good way). I had high expectations of all these but especially Noth who I had never imagined in a role other than that of our trusty detective in Law and Order. I was surprised with how well he played the role of Pompeyy.

The only problem I have with this is that there never go into any mention of Octavian (Augustus) as Julius' heir. They do mention him only once near the end of the film but nothing to do with adoption. I can see why this was so, as to not distract from Julius Caesar himself, but it would have been nice regardless.

I recommend to any of those who are interested in a surprisingly good film and who appreciate actors who are not known for their huge blockbuster films, yet still do a better job in some cases.",1173657600,7,1999,4.423913043478261

However, if you're not such a historical purist, if you're in it strictly for the entertainment value, I think you'll really enjoy this film.  Personally I think the historical critics so far have been unduly harsh with what is otherwise a very admirable production.

Jeremy Sisto was excellent as Caesar, and was very ably supported by Christopher Walken (Cato), Richard Harris (Sulla) and Chris Noth (Pompey).  The depiction of the siege of Alesia was very well done, in my opinion.  There were quite a few emotionally gripping scenes, not the least of which is the climactic assassination in the Senate.  If you don't get too hung up on the history, I think you'll agree that this movie is three hours well spent.",1171411200,7,871,4.851351351351352

With great cast and incredible scenery, it makes Julius Caesar must-see movie. And most incredible of everything is that is TV production.

2116672,5,B0002S93TO,"This is a remarkably good film about one of history's great men.  This film features above-average acting and a storyline that is reasonably true to history, rather than a Hollywood puff piece.  The film begins with Caesar's confrontation with the dictator Sulla, and ends of course, with his historic assassination in the Senate.

The thing I liked best about this film is that in my opinion it is a fairly realistic look at Julius Caesar.  It mostly does not try to glorify him (as did, for example, Colleen McCullough in her Masters of Rome series of books).  Nor does it demonize him.  The film shows that Caesar went to Gaul and provoked wars mainly for his own political purposes (to enhance his stature at home) and that when the Senate sought to call him to account, this is what motivated him to turn his army against Rome and essentially overthrow the Roman Republic.  These are not necessarily laudable acts, and the film does not gloss over these points.  The scenes of Caesar imperiously dictating harsh laws and proscriptions to the Senate show that by the time of his death, absolute power had indeed corrupted Caesar absolutely.

The film has a much better attention to detail concerning Roman parapernalia such as the lictors who attended the Roman Consul, and other similar details.  Purists will appreciate this.

Another excellent quality of this film is the casting and acting, both are excellent.  The acting is generally good.  Jeremy Sisto was criticized for his portrayal of Caesar, but I thought he did a reasonably good job.  Richard Harris absolutely nails the role of the Dictator, Lucius Cornelius Sulla.  Christopher Walken did fine as Cato, although this was not a major role in the film. Heino Ferch was a very convincing Vercingetorix (the King of the Gauls). I did not think that Jay Rodan was a convincing Mark Antony.  Overall, though, this film surprises with the performances that its generally excellent cast turns in.  This film is sufficiently good, in fact, that one why it was not a ""bigger"" film.  I have not enjoyed a film as much as this one in several years, causing it to merit 5 stars.

The sets, acting, and DVD reproduction of this film are all excellent.  This film will satisfy those of us who seek historical accuracy in a film about one of history's great figures, but the storyline will similarly engage those who simply are interested in  good dramatic entertainment.  This one is highly recommended.",1156291200,12,2458,4.844124700239808
2116673,4,B0002S93TO,"This is an entertaining film about Julius Caesar, one of the greatest men in history. The costumes were authentic and the speeches by Caesar and Marc Anthony were fantastic. There are some accounts that I found very interesting and generally accurate, such as the decisive battle of Alesia. The battle order of the Romans is well presented. The film managed to capture the atmosphere of the life during the period that Caesar lived.

The film gives an account of the early life of Caesar up to the time that he was appointed to a five year term as Proconsular Governor of Transalpine Gaul (current Southern France) and Illyria. Not content with an idle governorship, Caesar started the Gallic Wars (58 BC-49 BC) in which he conquered all of Gaul (the rest of current France, with most of Switzerland and Belgium, effectively western mainland Europe from the Atlantic to the Rhine) and parts of Germania and annexed them to Rome.

The film also shows the critical role played by Caesar in the transformation of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. His conquest of Gaul extended the Roman territory. Caesar was responsible for the first Roman invasion of Britannia in 55 BC. Caesar is undoubtedly one of the greatest military geniuses of all time, as well as an astute politician and one of the ancient world's strongest leaders. In 42 BC, two years after his assassination, the Roman Senate officially sanctified him as one of the Roman deities.

However, there are several instances of historical inaccuracies that have been well highlighted by several reviewers. Therefore, if you want to learn about Julius Caesar and are looking for an accurate historical account of his life and achievements, this is not the right film for you. After all, this is a Hollywood movie, with a commercial focus not historical interest.

As far as the acting is concerned, I think Jeremy Sisto did an above average performance, which is not good enough when telling the story of one of the most famous men in recorded history.

2116677,4,B0002S93TO,"All in all, this version of Julius Caesar's life is somewhat better than the others, once Caesar starts to begin his rise of power.  First off, the acting is extraordinary (Christopher Walken as Cato), and is carried through the entire movie, particulary with Chris Noth a Pompey (his look of uncertainty when presented with the command against Caesar is absolutely uncanny).

Likewise, the siege of Alesia in Gaul, Caesar's crowning achievement during the Gallic wars, is well done, though the troubles that Caesar's army faced were somewhat overblown.  Historically, Caesar's legions were fanatically loyal to him, chiefly because of his willingness to put himself on their level with daily assignments, so the scene where they are on the verge of mutiny demonstrates a lack of control that the historical Caesar rarely (perhaps twice - the mutiny of the tenth and his assassinaton) experienced.  However, chalk this up to poetic license.

There are, of course, some aspects that were a bit lacking: Caesar's travels to Bithinya, his crucifixion of the pirates, and his adulturies with his political enemies' wives are all aspects of his personality that would have enriched an understanding of what made him tick.

Likewise, the selection of Caesar's actions once he was made dictator could have used some work.  Too many people believe that Caesar was an opportunistic monster (when his actions condemning men that abused the law and his legislation in the plebeian assembly clearly demonstrate good sense rather than a quest for personal glory).  Some more of his political and legal acumen could have been incorporated.

However, all in all, the depection is a good one.  It Combines his clemency and compassion for Romans with his casual discarding of barbarians.  It shows his grief at Pompey's death in Egypt.  It also shows his daring military skill.  Each of these presents a picture of a Roman capable of seeking to preserve Rome's pre-eminence and law while simultaneously marching on the city and defeating fellow Romans.  If could use some work, but it treads a line between the silly ""Caesar was a villian"" view and the equally silly ""everything Caesar did was wonderful"" position.

Some of the reviewers who gave negative ratings need to remember that this is a movie, not a documentary. I'm sure that no matter how accurate producers, directors, actors, etc. try to make a historical movie, there will always be mistakes. After all, this all happened over 2,000 years ago and we don't exactly have newsreels of the events or t.v. interviews with the people.",1135641600,4,782,4.757352941176471

I also like the fact that they actually built all the sets and recreated ancient ROME, instead of using blue screen and CGI.

2116680,1,B0002S93TO,"... and I don't need shallow films regarding Caesar's facinating life to bring me nearer to him. TNT's production of this mini-series on the life of Julius Caesar leaves much to be desired. This movie is essentially nothing more than a quasi-fictional novela of Caesar and therefore has little substance or historical accuracy. In addition to a contrived screenplay, terrible script, and literally countless historical inaccuracies, the mediocre acting of Jeremy Sisto as Caesar leaves nothing of worth to watch other than good but sparing performances by Richard Harris as Sulla and Christopher Walken as Cato.

The character of Caesar is portrayed as oversympathetic because it ommits his lesser known actions that show how his sinister ambitions started at an early age.  The film portrays him as a blameless champion of the Roman proles when he was in fact, above all, a shameless opportunist and exhibitionist whose ancient noble family had lapsed into obscurity and poverty. An outcast in the patrician/noble circles, Caesar was anxious to attain political office by demaguoguery and populism if he had to.  He chose to affiliate himself with the popular but questionable politics of his uncle Marius and his father-in-law Cinna. Marius was a commoner and populist who had been exiled as a public enemy after attempting several violent but unsuccessful plebiscites in Rome. In an effort to recall Marius, Cinna attempted a failed coup d'etat in Rome and also fled as a public enemy. Cinna and Marius later joined in besieging Rome to overthrow the senatorial majority and so legitimize their impeachment of Sulla from his proconsular command in Asia Minor.  Having completed their siege, they proceeded to massacre their political opponents and fellow countrymen with impunity: killing the consul Octavius and placing his head on a pike on the Rostra. Undisturbed by the methods used by his relatives to attain political power, Caesar sought to profit from them instead by taking the office of High Priest made vacant by the suicide of its previous holder who wanted to avoid a sham trial. Julius Caesar was a shrude oppportunist who always appeared to be cordial and generous because it served his interests more than anything else. Despite being one of the greatest military geniuses in history as well as a generous patron to the poor, Caesar was a narcissist who loved to indulge himself in outrageous luxury. Caesar was also considered to be immorally promiscuous even by the Romans themselves  (i.e. Brutus' mother)! Caesar was known by his contemporaries for stooping to virtually any form of lechery to get what he wanted.  The kingdom of Bythnia was interestingly devised to Rome upon the death of Nicomedes who shortly before had enjoyed numerous and scandalous encounters with Caesar on various nights in his bed chambers.  Another example is him later preferring to continue collaborating with the sleazy tribune Publius Clodius Pulcher whom he knew to have been courting his second wife Pompeia.  He only divorced his wife to protect his public image with which he was even more obsessed than Pompey The Great. Both he and Pompey needed vast wealth as each loved to display great lavishness in order to surround himself with useful sycophants. Even Sulla himself was said to have read Caesar's dark motives early in 80 B.C. and to have been somewhat frightened of what he saw.  After Caesar daringly confronted him with grievences as to the political restrictions being imposed on him for his family's associations with the chief instigators of the civil war, Sulla was said to have exclaimed, ""Beware! I see the faces of one thousand Mariuses in this one boy!""  In short, Caesar was an overly ambitious political opportunist even by the liberal standards of his contemporaries who were intoxicated with political ambition already. He was a man who had few mores or ethics he was unwilling to part with if it could get him what he wanted even if the methods to be used were to the detriment of the--albeit imperfect--democratic institutions of his nation.

As for the supporting cast, Sulla played by Richard Harris was also falsely portrayed.  Although Sulla was the arch-enemy of Marius, his proconsular post in Asia Minor against Mithridates was illegally removed from him by Marius who coveted the command for himself despite his being old, decrepid, and senile. Sulla eventually returned with his own army and entered Rome to restore order: the supporters of Marius and Cinna were in turn proscribed. Unlike Caesar who eventually bribed his way to permanent dictatorship, Sulla was appointed dictator due to real emergencies that he didn't really bring about.  Caesar's relatives Cinna and Marius had clearly started and lost the civil war and died with most of their supporters in full flight, dead, or under siege.  Sulla reorganized Rome's political institutions along more conservative lines to prevent the demagoguery of populists like Marius and Cinna from occurring again.  He also undertook legal reforms to limit corruption and the power of the tribunes in carrying out plebiscites to circumvent the Senate. Sulla was not the mad dictator as shown in the film lusting only for power and he wasn't murdered by his opponents. Sulla honorably resigned his post as dictator after one year in 81 B.C.  and died in 77 B.C. from a terminal illess and a wound he received while killing one of his creditors. The funniest character distortion in this film is that of Cato played by Christopher Walken.  The film makes Cato Uticensis a major political player as early as Sulla's dictatorship and that is quite comical since, when Sulla returned to Rome in 82 B.C. , Cato would have been a very young and unusual member of the Senate at only 13 years of age and not even wearing his toga virilis! The real Cato only became a power in Rome and the Senate over twenty years later as an outspoken opponent of the First Triumvirate and Caesar. The film instead makes him an opponent to Sulla and later Caesar played by 60+ year old Christopher Walken who never seems to age one bit despite the passage of over 30 years until Cato's stoically defiant suicide in Utica.

One of the strangest choices in this film was to completely omit the existence of Marcus Licinius Crassus. This was unfortunate because Crassus' presence and eventual absence from Caesar's life is what brought him power and eventually forced him towards a final clash with Pompey and his supporters.  Crassus was the single biggest power broker in Rome who was continuously trying to outwit Pompey The Great's ambitions.  Caesar was a clever manipulator and often played Crassus against Pompey knowing of their animosities for one another.  Caesar was often the convenient mediator between the two and would help them make amends to suit his ends.  A good part of Caesar's safety and political advancements upon returning to Rome were due to Crassus probably even more than Pompey. Caesar was considered an enemy of the state after Sulla's dictatorship because of his family connections to Cinna and Marius and so most Roman aristocrats refused to associate with him or sponsor his political ambitions. Unlike Pompey whose recent noble lineage made him fear the scorn of the optimates and the nobility, Crassus was from the Licinii clan that had been well established since the Early Republic.  As with Pompey, Crassus had populist agendas opposed by the nobility's conservative elements but, unlike Pompey, he didn't fear the nobility's disapproval and backlash as much: he therefore had less problems than Pompey in parting with the optimates and supporting Caesar's populist agendas.  Crassus was indeed a huge political and financial backer for Caesar.  Plutarch notes that Caesar was about to find himself in dire straits with his creditors prior to going to his Spanish governorship and that it was Crassus who paid for a huge balance of 800 talents/19,200,000 sesterces. To put this amount into perspective, both Cicero and Caesar bought luxurious villas from Crassus on the Palantine (Rome's Beverly Hills so to speak) for no more than 2 million sesterces. Caeasar was in serious need of cash and would probably have been barred from his governorship if not his senatorial station had not Crassus quickly payed this vast sum.  Crassus had many mines and clients in Spain that seemed to be in jeopardy there due to Pompey having encroached himself there while fighting Sertorius.  Caesar needed cash that Crassus had conveniently available as he had problems in Spain where Caesar was to govern.  Caesar needed Crassus as a sponsor to appear more respectable in the Senate given his shady background.  Caesar's fortune was therefore really a product of his collaboration with Crassus more than anything else.  Caesar's importance in Roman affairs was rather minimal until Pompey and Crassus sponsored him.  It was primarily Crassus who was the power behind the First Triumvirate and it was mainly he who promoted Caesar's command in Gaul.  Both he and Crassus were the ones who sought to enfranchize Northern Italy. The film also attributes the victory against Spartacus to Pompey when it was unquestionably Crassus who ended the Slave Revolt: Pompey arrived with Lucullus at the last minute and did some mopping up. It was Crassus who had 6000 slaves from the revolt crucified from Capua to Rome along the Appian way and it was he who received an ovation for ending the Servile War, not Pompey: Pompey was simultaneously celebrating a full triumph for his defeat of Sertorius and Perperna in Spain which had nothing to do with the Servile War. Caesar later provided Crassus with over 4000 Gallic horsemen to help him in his disastrous Parthian campaign. Most important of all, the direct reason the Civil War erupted between the Pompeian and Caesarian factions was Crassus' untimely death in Parthia which completely dismantled his entire political clientelle and power base in Rome leaving a huge power vacuum in its mafiaesque republican system of clan patronage and syndication.  This is important because all classical sources on Crassus, even as negative as they are, agree that Crassus had by far the most influence and power in Rome even after Pompey and Caesar had surpassed him in actual liquidity. This means that Crassus had the vastest and most solid investments in the Republic and, most importantly, the most solid connections with persons of influence amongst the commercial equestrian and plebeian classes as well as the individually silent but politically numerous lower nobility in the Senate.  Upon his death, his youngest son Marcus was too young to take the reigns of his vast clientelle network and just fell in the ranks by joining Caesar along with most of his father's clients.  Had Crassus not died unexpectedly with his eldest son Publius at Carrhae, the radical political alignments by his dependents mainly to the Caesarian faction would probably not have happened and civil war with the Pompeians would have almost certainly been avoided.  The irony then of choosing to exclude Crassus as a character is that the film essentially shoots itself in the foot.  The film redacted the single most important cataclysm towards what amounts to be the climax of both the film and history: the clash between Caesar and Pompey's republican supporters.  What is comical is that the rushed and vacuous plot inserted in place of the history of Caesar and Crassus was not only historically ludicrous but was so poorly written that it simply failed to build up or accentuate any of the tensions it it had hoped to portray by making the redaction in the first place.

The true political intrigue between the shady Caesar and his fellow triumvirs along with the tragic consequences for each of them is interesting enough as it is to make a great movie: I don't see how some historically illiterate low-ranked Hollywood TV writer could make it more interesting than that.  A film that would truly capture the 'Spirit of Late Republican Rome' and Caesar as one previous reviewer commented would not have excluded Crassus, beautified Caesar's sinister character, or reduced Roman history to an infantile depiction showing purely the settling of a personal grudge between Pompey and Caesar.  The film wouldn't try to fit the characters of real and fascinating historical figures into trite 2-dimensional television characters that are crudely drafted to meet the limited needs of its infantile screenplay.  A true film on the subject would instead take the challenge of the real Caesar and, with some reasonable liberties permitted, make a film that is accurate, interesting, revealing, and moving to watch concerning the life of one of the single most important founders of modern Europe and Western civilization.  Boiling his character and deeds down to the form of a contrived and almost purely fictional novela is beyond my comprehension.  The only reason I can see for doing something so reductive is that it was done to match the talent collectively possessed by all of those who were involved in devising the screenplay and in charge of the direction in this film.  This movie drowns in its anachronisms and historical inaccuracies that are not merely pardonable omissions or alterations but simply absurd distortions in events, situations, and characters. Even the equally absurd distortions in Kubrick's 'Spartacus' are pardonable simply on the outstanding script, acting, and direction of which this film has none to boast of.  In terms of acting here, the only performances that stand out are those by Richard Harris as Sulla and Christopher Walken as Cato and their cameos are simply too brief to make a real positive impact on this worthless pile of reel. Jeremy Sisto seemed too uncertain and shy to come across as a Caesar. Sisto doesn't even look anything like Caesar anyway as Caesar was described by ancient sources as having blonde hair. Caesar was said to be of generally frail health and certainly not Herculean in physique but he wasn't the worn out coat depicted in this film either. For these reasons, I wouldn't recommend this mini-series for a good film on Caesar. This production is even less faithful to Roman history than Howard Fast's 'Spartacus' and that's pretty bad: at least Fast had enough literary acumen to properly include Crassus in his story even though, at least by the poor standards of the writers in this film, he didn't really have to either I suppose.",1127088000,32,14500,5.053182579564489

8031022,2,B0002S93TO,"This presents many of the basic facts, but this is a deeply flawed version of events.  Way too much happened between the time of Sulla and the assassination of Caesar to be covered in such a short series.  Not even the acting is very good.  But it is ridiculous historical inaccuracies that are most glaring.  Caesar is treated as if he were an amateur rather than the military genius that he had spent a life time developing and his complex political career is simply not covered.  Then there are unbelievably stupid scenes, like the one where Caesar consults with Vercingetorix about how he should lead the people. For all its flaws, the HBO series is infinitely superior, not just in terms of accuracy, but as a story you love to watch.

Also, and sadly, this movie is like most on ancient Rome. They show people riding horses with stirrups. No. Stirrups came after Rome fell. Caesar, and other great generals of antiquity (Hannibal, Alexander) had no knowledge of such matters....

At another level, the movie is pedestrian. Undoubtedly for budget reasons, there is relatively little war depicted. So there is sparse build up of suspense or drama. Like most biopics perhaps.

There is a great quote by Cleopatra - ""I am the daughter of Isis""",1469923200,,746,4.767441860465116
8031026,5,B0002S93TO,"Film starts with Sulla and his entry, with his legions, into Rome. This background crisis explains much of the drama thereafter.

Will Caesar become another Sulla? Why is Caesar conquering all Gaul, when he was not authorized?
Who will lead Rome, the Senate? Pompey? Caesar? Cato?

This drama presents the conflict within the changing Roman political system.

Does the Senate represent people (citizens not slaves) of Rome or the aristocracy? Can Caesar win control over the senate by bribing Rome with spoils from Gaul?

Uniting with Cleopatra, queen of Egypt, brings promise of grain. How can Caesar now be ignored?

Cato warns senate early. When Caesar and legions enter Rome, Pompey raises army to fight. He loses.

Caesar killed by senate.

I enjoyed the connection of the individual people, with their story, to the larger picture.

Apollonius, the intellectual slave, joins the revolt and refuses to leave it. He chooses crucifixion rather than return as a slave to Caesar's household. Well done.

The battle in Gaul, where Caesar builds two walls, inner and outer, was amazing.

Resisting Sulla face to face, facinating! Caesar broken-hearted at death of first wife, and then his start into politics with a stirring speech at her funeral.

Cato suiciding after losing battle to Caesar.

All carefully done.

Another interesting insight from this history, is the connection to Bible prophecy.

Daniel chapter seven describes a beast that was to represent a future kingdom, it ""was extraordinarily fearsome, with iron teeth and copper claws, and it was devouring and crushing, and trampling down what was left with its feet.""

Rome as depicted in this drama, fits this 'beast'.

Frank E. Manuel, in his scholarly book: ""The Shapes of Philosophical History"", explains that Daniel's prophesy influenced European thought for a millennium.

A few liberties with history, but nothing major.

 I think they used Shakespeare's lines with the old prophet warning about the ides of March and Calpurnia's dream. Is that history or Shakespeare?

8031027,4,B0002S93TO,"I've noticed that several teachers have made use of this film in their classrooms. Some have praised it while others have knocked it for it's historical inaccuracies. As a World History teacher myself (grade 7) I have shown portions of this film for over a decade and have found  it useful in helping students to visualize the latter days of the Roman Republic. Though there are clearly some historical flaws, this movie works well with Jr. High students if accompanied with the actual facts as comparison. I stick with the scenes related to Caesar's rise to popularity via the Gallic Wars and his subsequent decision to ""cross the Rubicon"" and march on Rome. I then fill in more historical info with my students about the dichotomy of good and bad in the character of Caesar and resume the film with Caesar's assassination. The students tend to eat this up with great enthusiasm.

If used piecemeal, this movie works exceptionally well. On the whole, the film is entertaining. It's not worth showing the entire movie to a Jr. High audience and is not really appropriate for them (a bit too much ""romance"" in some scenes). For those not using it as a teaching tool, it is a fun movie to watch. I would encourage everyone to learn more details about this fascinating historical figure. The film, while decent, doesn't do him justice. Of particular note on the film, the character of Cleopatra is severely minimized. Caesar's affair with her caused great panic in Rome for many feared Caesar may turn this foreigner into the queen of Rome and establish himself as king (a taboo in Rome since the time of the revolt against the Etruscans).

This entire era of the Roman Civil Wars is a fascinating subject. If ever history was like a tragic soap opera, it was during this time. Do yourself a favor and discover it.",1453248000,,1811,4.7066246056782335
