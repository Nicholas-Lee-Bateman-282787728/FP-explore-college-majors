2417115,5,B000BH4BRA,"What a wonderful reminder of the bond shared by food and art.  In fact, I have always been a believe that cooking is an art form as much as a craft.  Monet's Palate, A Gastronomic View from the Gardens of Giverny
with appearances from such great chefs interspersed with the special views of Giverny not often open to the public should be watched often and regularly prior to cooking for friends and family.",1306368000,,406,4.5479452054794525

2417118,5,B000BH4BRA,"I thought this was a lovely video and a lovely idea. The gardens of Giverny are given life with Meryl Streep's narration, and combining the gastronomy (whether real or imagined) of Claude Monet with his artwork and his gardens makes for an interesting DVD.",1306368000,,256,4.840909090909091
2417119,5,B000BH4BRA,"Watching this movie helps me better understand the world of Monet.  Whether it's a fork or paint brush, Monet delves into the subject matter.  The choice of colors in both venues are amazing.  The narrator (Meryl Streep) was excellent in her description of the Gardens.  Thanks for helping me understand the complex world (i.e. Carbohydrates) of Monet.",1306368000,,352,5.12280701754386
2417120,5,B000BH4BRA,"What a great film. Watched it twice and enjoyed it even more the second time. Meryl Streep was quite a suprise and the whole film makes me yearn for a more civilized time. If you love art, food and the delightful great chefs as I have never seen them before, this is for you.",1306281600,,275,4.111111111111111
2417121,5,B000BH4BRA,"MONET'S PALATE- A GASTRONOMIC VIEW FROM THE GARDENS OF GIVERNY- is a stunning and delicious view into the inner world of the world's most gifted and influential impressionist painters. The film is a personal exploration of his life and travels, his inspiration garnered from his exquisite surroundings which found their way to his exuberant canvases, visuals that burst with color,texture, and his  view of nature.
I was not surprised to discover that Monet was a gastronome; I imagined he would be a lover of all the seductive arts. As I watched and listened to this delightful and meditative film
I found myself transported to the gardens of Giverny; their lush and fragrant varietals abloom; I was hoping to be invited to lunch in the gentle air, dining on
French cherries,and apricots, peaches and nectarines, perhaps some melon, pear or plum sorbet. I've already selected the perfect garden hat. I adored Meryl Streep
as the narrator, she was an excellent choice to deliver this lovely message of a time and place worthy of being remembered and enjoyed forever. The chefs who participated are some of my favorites, and except for Anton and Remy, I have happily enjoyed their culinary talents, and have also been fortunate to have had Steve Wynn give me a personal tour of his art collection. The chefs clearly understand Claude Monet's passion; they too are influenced by all that surrounds them, the bounty of the earth; they have translated their immense passion to the plate and Claude interpreted his on his canvases. This film captures a beautiful balance and interplay of the palate to palette connection...many of my friends greatly enjoyed my gifting them with the DVD.",1306281600,,1682,5.007142857142857
2417122,5,B000BH4BRA,Monet's Palate is very entertaining and insightful film highlighting the Giverny home of Claude Monet I feel that this film can be enjoyed by art lovers and those interested in food a treat for all the senses,1306281600,5,208,4.648648648648648
2417123,3,B000BH4BRA,"While this makes for an interesting cooking how-to, I was hoping for a bit more historical fact and discussion/display of Monet's artistic masterpieces or actual photos of his gardens at Giverny.",1303948800,,195,5.32258064516129
2417124,3,B000BH4BRA,"Being an enormous admirer and lover of all things ""MONET"", I was so excited when I learned of this DVD.  I own quite a library of Monet's works including the magnificent 4 volume catalogue of his works, my walls are covered with nicely framed decent repros of a number of his works and my apartment dining room & furniture are an homage to his Giverny dining room.  If I could afford it, I'd have his formal (blue & yellow ochre) Limoge and ""every day"" Cherry Blossom Limoge, which as far as I know, is still being reproduced by Limoge (they had both patterns at Barney's NY a number of years ago...stunning!). I've made do with a nice set of blue & white Imari Garden that I got on sale from Neiman Marcus a number of years ago (I think Monsieur Monet would have approved).  So, call me a Money junkie or groupie. When I view the beautiful photos in the books about his home and garden and his cooking diary, which are in my library, I dream of what it must have been like to have lived like Monet and his family or to have been his friend and been invited for lunch, dinner or tea.
When I saw the release of this DVD I was so looking forward to it. I thought it would be of the quality (& content) of the fine PBS series ""THE IMPRESSIONISTS.""  All I can say is that what is on it is marvelous but not enough. It is an appetizer for the price of a full meal.  The price is a huge rip-off.  The DVD has no extras and not even a nice insert booklet. If I'd known I was getting only an appetizer and no entree, dessert or wine, I'd have waited for a lower price or cheaper second-hand copy.  I adore Ms. Streep but you don't even see her.  She speaks briefly at the beginning and that is it.  I'm sorry but this DVD does not merit the price tag. For the price, I don't expect a 7 course meal but at least 3 courses for the price tag.  This could have been done much better and more attractively.  How wonderful to have an extended intro or an ""extra"" with Ms. Streep taking us on a (even brief) tour of the Giverny house and gardens. I was delighted to see Alice Waters and Ann Willan but would that this had been made in the 90s with Julia Child participating.  I'd much rather have seen and heard commentary by Jaques Pepin than Daniel Boulud.  I've not looked at who the director and artistic director are for this amuse bouche, but they could have done a better job for end product price tag.  What is on it is decent, just not enough for the price.",1298419200,10,2451,4.165254237288136
2417125,5,B000BH4BRA,"Monet's Palate is a treat for the senses.  It is a very entertaining and insightful film highlighting the Giverny home of Claude Monet and how the foods and color palettes of his surroundings translated themselves onto his painted masterpieces.  I feel that this film can be enjoyed by both art lovers and those interested in food, particularly the French cuisine of Normandy.  The film is presented in a relaxed, friendly manner, with tours of Monet's kitchen and gardens along with demonstrations by famous chefs.  Also very enjoyable was the description of his day to day life, how he entertained, and his travels.  I watched Monet's Palate with my husband and we both enjoyed it.  I think that this film would also be a great learning tool for art and culinary students.",1296259200,10,774,4.870229007633588

8086676,3,B000BH4BRA,"Content great but viewing quality poor.

Despite major flurry of advertising lately for this on Facebook and other places, no one mentions that it actually was produced 10 years ago. Most unfortunately this classic video does not play with clarity on any newer device.

This was a gift and I think the person who got it for me responded to my feelings about Monet, France and cooking and missed that the reviews that come up are 10 years old, and the reviews you see are the same.",1451088000,,480,4.505747126436781
