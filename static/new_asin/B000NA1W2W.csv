2761963,1,B000NA1W2W,"After the first two minutes of the film I cut it off. The acting was substandard and the effects were a joke. I fast forwarded through it just to feel like I did not spend the money for nothing. However, I could have watched the whole thing to completion and still felt I was cheated. You would be better off watching an old fifties horror or sci-fi. Just another of those low budget deals you pick off the shelf at blockbuster and take a chance.  Save yourself the disappointment I took the chance for you.",1177113600,10,507,4.336842105263158
2761964,3,B000NA1W2W,"SUPERCROC ( theasylum.cc )

Starring; Kim Little & Marat Glaser.

The best of SC is the title and poster, WOW !

The acting is quite good whoever thought of making the bosse's wife the bad-guy was VERY comfortable with his job,LOL.

We thought the dialogue made sense and seemed what people would do in a similar situation.

Cynthia Rose Hall  has a lot of acting skill, Seemed to carry the film along at times.

Matthew Blashaw has that Gi-Joe jaw,That fans depend on for their heroes.

A missed opportunity is Marat Glaser(Who stole the scenes in 9/11 Commission report) as a government desk jockey,He deserves more to do .

The only bitching from me is ""Why"" cut away at violence, Every time,Unless this is basically A Sci-Fi channel Movie Of The Week ,in waiting.<",1176249600,3,768,4.6716417910447765

2762024,1,B000NA1W2W,"You know, I'm really starting to question this love affair I have with The Asylum's films.  There's certainly nothing glorious about the badness of Supercroc; it's just a cheap movie with terrible acting, the thinnest of plots, and laughable special effects.  The audio and video quality of the film leaves much to be desired as well.  Heck, even the editing is awful - either that or at least one character has the remarkable ability to transport herself several inches in space in the blink of an eye.  If that weren't bad enough (and it is), we don't even get the pleasure of seeing the film's most annoying character eaten alive at any time.  There just is no justice to be found in this sub-mediocre addition to the annals of giant monster films.

The action begins with the world's most unprofessional army squad stalking around a lake area some fifty or so miles north of Los Angeles.  What are they searching for?  No one's telling because they're too busy jabbering about the upcoming wedding of Private Perez (Cynthia Rose Hall) and her same-squad boyfriend.  The Sarge throws out a few weak hand signals, trying to look like he knows what he's doing, but his own ineptitude soon becomes wholly apparent when an impossibly huge crocodile sneaks up on him (in one of the most pathetic special effects moments in the history of film).  Unaware that they're dealing with a Supercroc some sixty feet in length and who knows how many tons in weight, the army keeps sending soldiers into the area.  That would be a mistake - especially since none of them share Pvt. Perez's unparalleled knowledge of crocodile behavior (she's from Florida, don't you know).  Fortunately, a forensic paleontologist (Kim Little) just happens to be in the command room to tell them what they are up against - a master predator with virtually invulnerable armor.  Hmmm - I wonder if some secret military project might be interested in finding out more about this creature?  This sounds like a job for a daisy cutter to me, but apparently the American military has only limited ammunition with which to protect the freaking west coast - and nothing they throw at the creature does anything more than just make it cranky.  The way things are going, Los Angeles is going to be toast.  And did I mention the hundred or so Supercroc eggs just waiting to be hatched?

I did learn a few things from Supercroc.  Up until now, I had no idea that forensic paleontologists could issue direct orders to American troops, nor did I know that Apache helicopters were never designed to be crocodile-proof.  I also had no idea that CGI effects could be implemented so badly by anyone with at least a high school education.  I'll admit I'm surprised and disappointed to learn that our military is utterly defenseless in the face of a crocodile attack, but who knew that we had the wherewithal to easily evacuate the population of Los Angeles in less than twenty minutes?

Really, though, this film is in dire need of a Tiffany and/or Debbie Gibson in the cast.  And an action scene.  Yes, you heard me right, not once in this entire movie do we actually get to see Supercroc actually attack someone; and, apart from one explosion off in the distance, there is not a single shot of any croc-targeted bomb actually going off.  Supercroc is an action movie with no action (or suspense or horror or anything else that might possibly translate into an iota of enjoyment for the viewer).  You know, the best way to survive a crocodile attack is to never go anywhere near the freaking thing to begin with; I suggest you apply that same logic to this film.",1303084800,,3613,4.696825396825397
2762025,1,B000NA1W2W,"THANK GOD for the Half Price Book store on 76th street.  That is where I bought this awful DVD.  The best part is that the store had a 20% sale on all items and I found this dreadful movie in the discount DVD section, it was priced at $2, which should have given me the first clue to stay away from it but than they took 20% off that price so I thought that even if it is was bad I would still be somewhat entertained.

The Croc scientific ""expert"" said it was virtually indestructible using modern day weapons but this movie was so bad that I didn't even watch to see how the Croc was killed; I'd rather just not know.  Without watching the end of this dreadful movie I can now fanaticize it making its way all the way to LA and destroying everything, I'm even thinking of expanding my fantasy to have the stolen eggs hatch and continue up the coast to eat everyone in San Francisco as well.

Now THAT would make a good ending.",1293494400,3,928,4.162011173184357
2762026,1,B000NA1W2W,"I have had the unfortunate instance of seeing this movie twice. It is actually worse the second time around and it was horrible the first time. There is literally nothing good I can say about this movie (well, not quite true, the croc looked realistic, despite it being clearly greenscreened into every scene). The acting is terrible, the special effects are worse, the direction is amateurish at best, the storyline is mindbogglingly stupid, and it is amazingly boring. The only reason I watched it twice was because the first time I couldn't stay awake and kept dozing off. I figured, maybe I was just tired and missed the good parts. But no, I actually saw the good parts the first time.

One thing another reviewer commented on, which I heartily agree, is that in giant crocodile movies, one expects to see people eaten by the giant crocodile. What we see here is a crocodile wandering around, soldiers shooting at something offscreen, and the croc is killed by an explosion OFFSCREEN. All we see is blood being splashed around a corner and a very poor shot of the aftermath that looks like a photoshopped image done by someone who was just learning how to do it.

I cannot critiize this movie enough. At my college, they have an annual contest for the film students, in which each group of students (generally 4-5) are given a genre, a few sentences of dialogue and 72 hours to write and produce a short film. What they come up with is consistently better than any ten minutes of this movie. Supercroc has made my top ten list of worst movies ever made (worst as in just plain awful, not so bad it is funny, just so bad that it is an irritant to watch).",1283904000,3,1658,4.54180602006689

2762029,1,B000NA1W2W,"I only watched the first 20 min of this movie (20 more than I should have), and it was TERRIBLE! The acting is bad, the croc is stupid looking, and the storyline deplorable. Don't waste your time watching this movie, trust me.",1225929600,7,226,4.404761904761905
2762030,1,B000NA1W2W,"Satellite imagery causes a furor in the military.  There is something moving up the coast.  A team is sent to investigate and it is learned there is a giant crocodile (100 feet long) on the loose.  It is quick and deadly.  It also seems to have armor tough enough to stop anything that can be thrown at it.  A rescue team is sent to extract the original team.  They discover that there seems to be a third party involved that is interested in the croc.  Then the croc begins moving closer to a population center.

The crocodile advances and the military tries to stop it.  Shadowy scientist have their own agenda.  Meanwhile the original survivors of the field team and rescue team take it upon themselves to try and stop the giant reptile.  Plans are made and carried out.  Some work and some do not.  The end is a little silly and the final teaser is predicable.

The staging really reminds me of The Thing Below.  The special effects are often deplorable.  Specifically the first appearance as the croc comes out of the water and a later shot where is goes into the water by fading into complete transparency (a rubber toy going in and out of the water would have looked better).  One of the main characters grew up in Florida and is therefore an expert on crocs (pity that Florida is alligator country).  I was also amazed at the stupidity of the scientists.  All in all a pretty laughable movie suited for late night and not much else.",1182038400,12,1440,4.469230769230769
2762031,5,B000NA1W2W,"In supercroc the army must stop a super huge crocodile about 50 feet long and 15 feet tall from terrorize the land. Can the army stop the crocodile and retrive or destroys its eggs before it crush or devours all those living in Los Angles. This movie has decent action seqeunces and phonimnal music. This movie should be fine for kids either age thirteen and up 13 or 17 and up do to strong creature violence and frequent use of profanity. Can the army save the city from total destruction. If  you like this I also recommend Alligator I and II in vhs and lake placid, blood surf, and crocoidle 1 and 2 in dvd format.",1178755200,2,617,4.318965517241379
8175857,1,B000NA1W2W,"This movie misses the mark in a only a few of the key elements for the genre.
A) It has a plot line -(not really, I'm lying)
B) The actors all took acting lessons (not really, I'm lying)
C) CGI or hand-puppet or whatever they used was soooooo relaistic.. (nah, I'm still lying.)
D) Worst of all was the lack of any discernible dialogue continuity. (nah, not even close, I'm still lying, that was not the worst part)
E) On the front end of this movie when the ""Supercroc"" goes back into Lake Castaic, it appeared to be first: Walking on the water, then; it looks more like it simply melted instead of entering the water.
F) The end of the movie was a total disconnect from everything else, sort of like it got spliced in from another crocodile movie by mistake.

I love the genre of poorly done monster/disaster movies, but this was really over the tp bad.",1520121600,,855,4.377358490566038
8175858,1,B000NA1W2W,"I have a habit of watching low-budget sci-fi movies, and this was the worst.  It was painful to watch, and I only finished it, so I could say that I did.  A  few of the many problems are:

*  They use stock video footage of military equipment.
*  The clocks in the control room are not synchronized to the minute hands.
*  The chronological timeline doesn't follow, and time reverses at one time, according to the control room clocks.
*  The soldiers go rogue, without any orders.  A private disobeys a captain, which wouldn't happen in real life.
*  The croc goes from the ocean, to a treed highway, back to the beach, and then is attacked on a treed highway in the hills.  When it comes to, it's right back at the beach.
*After swimming through the ocean, they talk about leading it to the ocean to attack it.  Ummm....it was just in the ocean.
*The sound quality is terrible, at times you cannot hear or understand the actors.
*  One of the guys in the control room (I'm not even sure if they say his name,)  says the croc weighs 10,000 tons....umm....20,000,000 lbs?  Larger than 40 Boeing 747s!

This movie is just the worst.  Even if you like low-budget sci-fi for it's camp value and for unintentional comedy....this is bad.

But if you're looking for laughs, this gets five stars. Great for parties, as you and your friends can use a spreadsheet to keep track of who swears, what they say, and how many times they say it. It seems that whenever the script starts to sag, or an actor gets frustrated (or has nothing else to do), one of them will drop the F bomb or a few SOBs, etc. Or keep track of how many minutes the blonde main character talks on her cell phone. Or keep track of all the great lines like, ""That's gonna work about as well as a stop sign in an avalanche."" Hahahahahaha....",1472774400,2,798,4.181818181818182
