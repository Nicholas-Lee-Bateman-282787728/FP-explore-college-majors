8504703,4,B006UTDFNY,"My mouth dropped open during the opening scene to this movie.  Even though the movie description tells you what it is about - from the beginning you are not quite sure what is really going on.  Despite the poor sound quality in some spots and a couple of stereotypes, the plot is compelling and the characters believable.  I have to say that there where enough twists and turns in the plot to keep me interested and things did not turn out the way I expected. I liked it!",1340496000,,471,4.329545454545454
