8449796,1,B004ZIEKRW,"NO NO NO!! You couldn't pay me enough to watch this again! I'm normally up for a good B rated horror movie or even a C rated one but this belongs in the NO WAY pile. The quality is okay a little grainy but that's fine, the acting is okay, the special effects aren't really that special and well it was just horribly done! I don't like movies that have a cliff hanger end: you don't find out who does this! That irked me LOTS! And while I appreciate the semi character building around the lunch table did it REALLY have to be WHILE they were eating?! That bothers me in life, WHY would I want to watch that in a movie! Not to mention it seems that's how they fill the silence, eating, drinking and dying.
It has great promise but was poorly executed",1496880000,,748,4.165517241379311

8449798,1,B004ZIEKRW,"Sam (Zachary Ryan Block) owns a web design company. Eddie (Ray Rozmiarek) helps out and Kate (Balbinka Korzeniowska) is the receptionist. Along with Sam's gf Lauren (Tamara de Kauwe) they head up to Bear Lake which has a slasher reputation. While there they play a drinking game, then suddenly, the girl you see get stabbed in the opening scene (Amanda Greig) comes crashing into their patio. THERE IS NO PHONE RECEPTION!!!! But their car starts, so it is not a problem.

The film is low budget and not very long. They fill much of the time with a time lapsed trip down the highway up to Bear Lake. There was really no need to see scenery whipping by to a lame sound track.

***Plot Spoiler?***
What the writer didn't realize is that most slasher films are watched by guys. Horror films do better if you don't kill off all the women first.

Extremely bad film, not worth a free view.

8449799,2,B004ZIEKRW,I appreciate any and all artistic attempts toward self-expression. So I don't like to give negative feedback or criticism to an artists work. But I couldn't help disliking this movie. I found myself fast forwarding through the whole thing.  The actors themselves were believable. But it didn't seem too believable especially at the end where it didn't seem to wrap up.  It had a -watch me make a movie with my camcorder and a few friends in the backyard- kinda feel to it. It wasn't scary at all or thrilling. So calling it horror or a thriller to me would be amiss. The cover led me to choose this since there was no preview option. I wish there would've been. I think I would've passed this one by.,1327622400,3,700,4.4609375

8449801,5,B004ZIEKRW,"not your run of the mill horror flick, more about how the characters react to something haunting them. definitely worth a watch.",1316649600,4,128,4.863636363636363
