7983100,1,B00008G8DP,Even if your are just an amateur DJ...This video is Garbage! LOL. Save your money and search DJ tutorials on sites such as YouTube!,1412208000,,131,4.5
7983101,4,B00008G8DP,"Its good, but not great.  It goes into pretty good detail on the basics of scratching and such, but there could be a bit more time spent on the actual cdj itself.  Not bad, but not great.",1343088000,,187,4.027027027027027
7983102,3,B00008G8DP,"I have 2 cdj 800mk2's and a djm 700. This dvd uses a lot of different equipment. They don't spend a lot of time on cdj 800's or cdj 1000's, which seem to be the 2 most popular cd turntables. Also it was made in 2003 and you can tell. They spend a lot of time on american dj software I have never heard of I believe is obsolete, which is a bummer for the 4 people who bought the american dj software. This dvd should be on the clearance rack for like $5.99 that would be a reasonable price since all the gear and software they use is obsolete.",1242950400,,542,3.9363636363636365
