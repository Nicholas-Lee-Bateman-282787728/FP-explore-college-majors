8494805,5,B000P2A5X0,"I'm a huge fan of What Not To Wear. With the show having gone off the air, I'm now monthly buying on Amazon episodes from the first four seasons that I've never seen (which means the show hasn't ended for me ... woot, woot!)
Anyone reading any WNTW review I do should know:
1) I'm only doing these reviews to give the ep 5 stars; I will give EVERY ep 5 stars as a nod to the general greatness of WNTW. I admit it, I'm biased. (But really, if the knowledge, fun, and drama aren't enough, the brilliance and wit of Stacy and Clinton push every ep to a 5 anyway.)
2) While I don't have time for big writeups on each DVD, a few observations: Enjoyed this ep, and not just because the contributor did such a nice job representing my beloved Red Sox in the heart of Yankees territory in 2005 (five up top, Amy!). Technically, it was interesting how she had three looks, tomboy, sports fanatic, and tart -- none of which was even remotely appropriate for her being a lawyer! Even I knew she just needed a few structured jackets and she'd be fine for the courtroom. And she was a textbook case of having a bigger top half and a smaller bottom half. Emotionally, this was an easy ep to get into. I liked Amy's big personality to begin with, and then to find out she had had a medical issue it made her easy to root for. I really felt for her when she teared up after finding a jacket she loved that didn't fit, so I was glad when she found another one that she loved, which she wore at the reveal. You could feel her confidence growing with each outfit she showed off. Comically, there was an absolutely classic staged Stacy eye roll at a Clinton ""brag"", and a cute bit in which Amy ""makes her peace"" with the 360 mirror. All that and more!
3) Oh yeah, the cost ... $19.95 per ep? WTF! I am a big enough fan of the show, and have the resources, to buy them. But do I see anybody else purchasing them? Probably not. Yet if you spring for this ep you certainly will enjoy it.
