8640096,5,B00I9FWL2I,I suggest everyone to purchase this DVD . There is so much important information that Ms. Laura Davis was  able to put together from her own spiritual experience with God . She did not gather this experience by herself but with the help by traveling to the holy land herself and experiencing her own spiritual experience she wanted to share and help others in this universe thanks Ms. Davis,1439510400,,390,4.6521739130434785
