6870795,1,B00QJ4KV50,"This item is good in terms of the video contents. However, I bought this (together with ""colors and more) so that while I am listening to music or radio in car while driving, my children can be watching the DVD and listening through their headset but I had a horrible experience. I ignored previous reviews with the hope and anticipation that the manufacturers have made the product better but boy was i wrong!?
The DVD will play a scene or so and stop. I have to keep pressing play for the next scene or chapter which 1, defeats the purpose of me listening to something else and 2, what even makes it worse is that sometimes when I hit the ""next chapter"" button, it goes right back to the beginning of the chapter that just ended. You would think that it will be better at home with a regular DVD or bluray play but that is not the case. You still have to keep pressing ""next/play next"" at the end of every chapter. REALLY FRUSTRATING. If you ask me, I wuld say don't buy this product unless you have the patience and time to keep pressing.",1446508800,,1041,4.316326530612245
6870796,5,B00QJ4KV50,"I know it's early, but my baby/toddler loves busy beavers! The songs are so fun, catchy, and include the lyrics to sing along! She gets so excited every time we play the DVD.",1439942400,,174,4.303030303030303
6870797,2,B00QJ4KV50,"I threw the disc in the bin after 4 days. the MAIN MENU drove me insane. Sure it says PLAY ALL, but when you select it, it does not allow you to play all of the video. Instead your only option is to select a new song / track after each 2minutes.. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!!
NOT USER FRIENDLY!! So every 2 minutes my daughter comes to me to play her another track!! Just stupid. Major fault. Do not buy unless you want to completely waste your time!",1435449600,,446,4.1976744186046515

8691455,1,B00QJ4KV50,"I LOVE the dvd, but mine arrived scratched. It was loose from the dvd case. My daughter loves them. I would give it a 4 star if it wasn't scratched. The only problem besides mine slipping is the play all selection. Of you hit play all, it will NOT. You have to hit stop 3 times, then hit play and it will play all.",1448064000,,314,3.921875
