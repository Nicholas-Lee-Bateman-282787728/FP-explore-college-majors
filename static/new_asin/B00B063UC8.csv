5540034,2,B00B063UC8,"Oh, ""Sadako 3D."" How unfulfilled I was left after watching you. I waited many months for a proper U.S. release and Well Go USA fulfilled my want. Unfortunately, my excitement was drowned out by an offensive mish mash of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge,"" ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors,"" and ""The Exorcist: The Version You've never Seen.""

A high school teacher named Akane (Satomi Ishihara) hears rumors of a cursed video clip circulating online. The clip is said to show a man, Kashiwada (Ysuke Yamamoto), commiting suicide. Supposedly, anyone who watches the video is driven to commit suicide themselves. Akane refuses to believe the rumors until one of her students mysteriously dies after viewing it.

Akane soon discovers that Kashiwada intends to use the clip to cause chaos and death, which will help the spirit of Sadako (Ai Hashimoto) find a host body for her to possess. Akane and her boyfriend (Kji Seto) must find a way to stop Kashiwada from accomplishing his terrifying goal.

I can't believe for one second that anything in the last act of this film is taken from the novel ""S,"" which it's based on. Judging from the other entries in the ""Ring"" series, writer Koji Suzuki seems way too sophisticated to stoop to the monster movie clichs we get in the ""climax"" of ""Sadako 3D."" I can believe the first and second acts of the film might be based on the actual source material. However, I can see producers and writers trying to up the scare ratio for audiences and completely ruining the film.

The general idea for ""Sadako 3D"" isn't the problem. The cursed video tape from ""Ring"" being converted into a file and uploaded to the internet is a natural progression that is very believable. The spirit of Sadako being able to manifest through any wireless device or computer hookup makes complete sense and is justifiably frightening. I just wish filmmakers would have spent a little extra time and money on CGI and practical effects to successfully convince me that what I was watching was authentic.

This is the perfect example of business executives and studio heads taking a simple, sacred, and tragic concept like the ghost of a vengeful girl and turning her into a monster movie icon the likes of Freddy, Jason, and Michael Myers. It's not enough that Sadako climbs out of TV or computer screens. Now she has the ability to extend her long black CGI hair and wrap people in it as she pulls them to their deaths. As if that's not ridiculous enough, she also causes her victims to turn into spiderlike creatures.

The video quality and 5.1 surround sound mix work for and against ""Sadako 3D."" The high definition transfer brings out the weaknesses in the CGI and 3D special effects. The movie was obviously made in 3D with no thought as to how artificial it would appear in 2D. However, the creepy sound effects used help to redeem the film to an extent. They give it an extra boost it so desperately needs. If much of the imagery in the film won't dredge up scares, maybe some extra bumps, booms, and gurgles will.

There are no extras to be found on the Blu-ray edition of ""Sadako 3D."" We get the 3D and 2D versions and a trailer for the movie. It would've been interesting to get a short featurette showing the making of the film.

""Sadako 3D"" does have a few chilling moments where we see traces of the main character we got to know in the first few films. Unfortunately, it's not enough to merit someone wasting their time on this. Do yourself a favor and re-watch ""Ring"" or ""Ring O: Birthday"" and witness Sadako the way she was originally conceived to be.",1369267200,,3609,4.654631083202512
5540035,3,B00B063UC8,"The ""Ringu"" franchise is a fascinating phenomenon. This latest chapter in the series is not a bad film. It has its creepy and shock moments. But it is a little over-the-top. The films may never have the impact of Hideo Nakata's original ""Ringu"" film. But nontheless, ""Sadako 3D"" is fun to watch on a Saturday night with it raining outside, the lights out and surround sound. The maniacal madman at the helm is a little bit much at times but the scares make for decent viewing. For me, this blu-ray was a day one purchase due to my love for Asian Horror Films with some of my favorites being ""Ringu"", ""Dark Water"", ""A Tale of Two Sisters"", ""The Eye"", ""Shutter"", ""Phone"", ""Alone"", ""The Eye 2"", ""One Missed Call"", ""Re-cycle"", ""Carved The Slit-Mouthed Woman"", ""The Red Shoes"", ""Dumplings"", ""The Cat"" aka ""Two Eyes That See Death"" and others. If you are a fan, give ""Sadako 3D"" a chance, you just might like it and the price is right. UPDATE: 2-D blu-ray quality is pretty decent with a nice blu-ray transfer and thunderous Japanese DTS-HD Master Audio; haven't watched the 3D version yet. Some of the CGI special effects are a bit hokey but the several Sadako attack moments and scares still suffice. Be prepared because the film goes into a completely different direction and changes into a monster movie going into the climax of the film; which is certainly not expected in the ""Ringu"" franchise even though Sadako was pretty monsterous in ""Ringu 0: Birthday"" but in a different, more ominous and disturbing way. It is going to be interesting to see where this franchise goes because this film is actually NOT the conclusion because ""Sadako 2 3D"" is releasing in theaters in Japan in August. Overall, a nice blu-ray to own if you enjoy J-Horror and the 3D gimmicks are there. Just don't go in expecting Hideo Nakata's ""Ringu"" and ""Dark Water"" or Takashi Shimizu's ""Ju-on 2"" and you'll be fine. But I enjoyed this film more than Takashi Shimizu's ""Shock Labyrinth 3D"" for sure. But ""Sadako 3D"" is no where near in the league of Shimizu's bizarre and unnerving ""Tormented 3D"" aka ""Rabbit Horror 3D"" which actually caught me by surprise. But this blu-ray is still recommended for the fun scares and it is something to put on a large screen HDTV in 1080p with surround sound for Halloween time.",1366761600,2,2288,4.708229426433915
5540036,3,B00B063UC8,"Historically, everything in the ""Ring"" media franchise has been pretty rock-solid. The main films are classics, and Koji Suzuki's original novel is on par with many things Stephen King has written. The various manga adaptations have also been entertaining, and from hearsay, the TV drama was solid. Heck, even the Dreamcast game, ""Ring: Terror's Realm"" is so bad that it's actually brilliant as a comedic experience.

So when somebody finally decided to update the infamous antagonist Sadako to be relevant to a modern audience (read: not in a videotape), I was reasonably excited. But while ""Sadako 3D"" does manage to succeed in being a relatively frightening horror flick with an interesting backstory, its confusing placement in the continuity and the lukewarm plot make it the weakest link of the series.

""Sadako"" follows a young school-teacher who is haunted by a traumatic childhood experience in which she was almost killed by a psychotic man wielding a knife. To save herself and her classmates, she let out a deafening scream which shattered glass and killed the attacker. She was then shunned by her peers, with the exception of one boy who ended up becoming her fiance. Fast forward to the present, where rumor has it that a mysterious video is circulating on the internet that acts as a virus of sorts, and forces people into suicide. When one of her students is afflicted, the teacher finds herself embroiled in the story of how the video virus came to be, and tries to stop it before it consumes the world by infecting the entire internet.

Kudos should be given to the concept of the film, directed by series newbie Tsutomu Hanabusa (who also wrote the script, along with veteran horror writer Yoshinobu Fujioka). While it was adapted from the newest Suzuki novel, ""S"", the fact remains that Sadako being a Trojan is a terrifying prospect. Throughout the film, we see her hand springing forth from a smartphone, and her hair raining down from a giant display on the side of a building in Tokyo. Even though the originals are terrifying, we need to face the facts: nobody's scared of VHS tapes anymore. By making this based upon a current technology, and referencing contemporary issues, the writers have successfully made this effective to a modern audience.

But is it actually scary? Honestly, the horror in this is a mixed bag, mainly comprised of cheap scare tactics. Some of the instances of Sadako appearing are genuinely frightening, and will make you jump out of your seat. But as the movie wears on, she loses her personal touch and becomes more of a force, simply appearing on the biggest screens possible. This is a perfect example of the phrase ""size doesn't matter, it's all in how you use it."" While seeing the ravenheaded and creepy cutie come out of aforementioned giant display is awe-inspiring, it's never really scary. Hanabusa ultimately fails at crafting a suspenseful atmosphere, and the thrills come from jump scares as oppose to actual suspense. Again, though, some of the instances of her appearing are pretty creepy (one scene of a hand springing forth from a smart phone sent chills down my spine), so people who are easily scared regardless might wanna look away for the first 30 minutes or so.

Unfortunately, the horror and plot both fall apart miserably in the latter quarter of the movie, as it devolves into a C-grade supernatural serial killer drama. While I won't spoil things, I will say that the reason for Sadako being resurrected is laughable, and the ""horror"" of a psychotic individual killing women and throwing them in a well to bring her back to life isn't terrifying, because we've seen it done before and done better. The fact of that there's a human antagonist makes the film significantly less mysterious. Not only that, the character himself is poorly acted and comes across as a prissy loser as opposed to a believable villain. Another thing fans might notice is that the latter half of the film severs continuity with the original films, making its billing of ""The Ring 3"" in other countries completely inaccurate. This should be treated as a side-story, or dare I say it, a reboot (ugh.)

But what really unravels the suspense is the supernatural threat itself. When we first get to see what we think is Sadako outside of the screen, she's unremarkable and contrived. Her legs are two or three times the size of her torso, and she runs around on all four limbs like a deranged insect, and can clone herself. Not only that, but she now has a giant mouth, roars, and drinks people's blood from their throats. Yes, Sadako, the prototypical ""creepy Japanese girl"" has ironically become a cliche Hollywood beast, devoid of any aura of mystery or terror. Even though you eventually find out that those are just monsters the real Sadako (who has a brilliant speaking role this time around) created, the fact remains that the filmmakers had to rely on CGI monsters to be scary, as opposed to actually BEING scary.

Oh, I might as well add that the ""video itself"" is utterly disappointing, nowhere nearly as creepy as the original footage we've seen in previous entries.

What makes the movie tolerable enough is the camerawork, which is surprisingly good, a shock considering how unfortunate the rest of the film is. There are distinct usages of colors to evoke moods during particular scenes, such as the blues and greens when the protagonist is running from the unremarkable ""Sadako"" clones. Pretty much everything in the movie is interesting to look at, and while the script does nothing to give off any atmosphere, the visuals are appealing enough to keep viewers engaged. Extra points go to the terse score and effective usage of sound effects.

If you're able to turn your brain off and just be engaged for the visual and auditory spectacle, you may have a good time. Just try to ignore the cheap, bad-CGI moments that blatantly try to ""come out of the screen"" at you.

Also good is the acting, the most strong performance of which comes from Satomi Ishihara in the lead role. As a victim of past trauma, braving her fears in order to save the man she loves, she's incredibly convincing and an absolute joy to watch. Her performance is incredibly nuanced, and saves the film from being entirely bad. Koji Seto is also a delight as her sweet-natured boyfriend, charming and adorable as he helps her through her various struggles. He's quite the believable character, and I think many men (and women, even) will be able to relate to him. Another great performance comes from Ryosei Tayama as a bumbling, but good-natured, detective who has a poor grasp on anything related to technology, providing some necessary comic relief.

Lastly, when you finally get to the ""true form"" of Sadako, played by the pretty Ai Hashimoto, you're treated to one of the most harrowing performances of a screen villain in recent memory. For the first time in the series, you see Sadako speak, and get a hint of her true motivations. It's truly a powerful moment, and makes you wonder why the idiotic serial killer subplot was even there in the first place. She's only on screen for a few moments, but Hashimoto is excellent, and I hope we see more of her in future entries.

It's good that most of the actors are strong, because one in particular is so unremarkable that he would drag the entire film down if he had even a few moments more of screen-time. This would be Yusuke Yamamoto, who plays the film's primary antagonist. His performance is incredibly poor, coming across like a cheap villain from a bad telenovela. From what I've read, Yamamoto is quite the charmer as a ""good boy"" type of character, and my advice to him would be to stick to that.

When we watch ""Sadako 3D"", what are we left with? Sadly, not enough. There are thrills to be had, and this is still better than most of the flicks that pass for ""horror"" these days. Strong performances, nice cinematography and a good score make a compelling argument for checking out this film. But that doesn't excuse a plot which becomes contrived halfway through, nor the awful performance of a key character who shouldn't exist, or the deceptive desecration of a legendary screen presence. Extra points should also be taken off for the lack of clarity in regards to where this exactly fits into the canon, if it even does at all, or if it's yet another reboot.

To modern audiences, this film will probably be passable and entertaining enough. But for people who know what the ""Ring"" series is truly capable of, and know that it can deliver excellent atmosphere and impeccable storytelling with a truly threatening menace, it will be a harsh disappointment. Ultimately, ""Sadako 3D"" is an acceptable thriller, but a tepid addition to such a great series.

5540037,5,B00B063UC8,"What a great follow-up! I love the Ringu series, so when I found out that this was availbale here on Amazon for US players, I jumped on the order! The movie is great as I expected. First hour starts out slow and creepy, then the last half hour goes an all-out fast paced Sadako rampage. A quick sypnosis, an online painter seeks revenge for being humiliated by reviving Sadako to destroy all humanity. Feeding the well of where Sadako was put in with hundreds of women to revive the mind of Sadako, then what looks like a suicide show is actually Sadako strangling him looking for the right body to complete her rebirth. All this causes a virus online as Sadako searches for the right one and making her victims appear like they commited suicide. I'm sure the US will eventually distribute this here for the states since the Ringu series is very succesful here, but I'm also sure it'll be another year or more when it does. So for any true Ringu fan, I wouldn't wait and just order what is available now. It is a Malaysian product but is playable on all US players with great picture and sound quality with english subtitles.",1359072000,,1125,4.492682926829269

This movie takes the extra step of not only being about a video that makes people want to kill themselves: it lets you know exactly how that would feel. Time warps are apparently now possible because this bluray turned 93 minutes into six excruciating hours.

The acting isn't to blame and the photographic 3D is good. Everything else, from the convoluted, canon-decimating plot to the ridiculous pace and headscratching dialog will make you rue the day you got sucked in to this hot pile of wasted opportunity with extra cheese.

The kills as such were really pathetic for the most and 3-D did not help.  The majority of the effects were CGI if not all and not done terribly well.

 Most of the kills are simply a poor looking CGI arm coming out of a computer screen and deaths that appear to be suicides... YAWN.

 Near the end when everything comes together, it picks up a bit and i like the creepy well monsters but it still leaves you unfulfilled in the end and not even worth an average rating.  This does not add at all to the Ring/Sadako story in any way and very likely will not be viewed a second time by me as it is nothing more than a cash-in on the name with no substance to add to the Sadako mythology.",1394841600,2,837,4.060975609756097

When you read the description and it sounds like a good movie that will follow the original movies, but it didn't; in fact the description sounds like how this movie should be.  the movie is about an artist that goes crazier than artists usually do and tries to ""revive"" Sadako, who has gone from killing people 7 days after they watch the tape to crawling around with weird frog legs.  The movie also has:  a techno savvy cop and his partner an old school cop whose computer knowledge is:  turn on computer, open word, write report, save, close word, turn off computer; an obsession with Luna Moths and insects in general; and nothing to do with the original movies at all.

5540046,3,B00B063UC8,"In Japan, similar to America, they have horror films that continue to be released every few years.

For Japan, one of those horror films that continue to be released are the ""Ring"" films, based on the novels by Koji Suzuki.  Films that have inspired American and Korean remakes and an visual image that remains a scary figure for people in Japan, to this day.

The antagonist for the films is an entity known as Sadako Yamamura and for each film, it appears the history of the long dark black haired woman (or in the novel's case, a hermaphrodite) wearing white, seems to be muddled.  A person with a ""Ring Virus"", a person that was born with psychic powers and in the past, she is able to kill people with a cursed tape which in the past had traveled a person's body and killing them.

Of course, things have changed a bit with Sadako's storyline and the same can be said about the fifth film titled ""Sadako 3D"", a film based on Koji Suzuki's novel ""S"" and is directed by Tsutomu Hanabusa.  It's also a chance for the film to bring Sadako to a modern era via attacking people through PC/cell phone technology and also using 3D technology to give audiences more of a frightening experience at the cinema.

VIDEO:

""Sadako 3D"" is presented in 1:85:1 aspect ratio and one disc comes with both the 3D and 2D version of the film.  First, let's discuss the 2D version of the film.  Shot digitally, picture quality is very good for ""Sadako 3D"".  Skin tones are natural, black levels are nice and deep.  I saw no artifacts or banding or any negative issues during my viewing of the film.  Good amount of detail during closeups and outdoor scenes are vibrant and colorful, while darker scenes are ominous and creepy.

As for the 3D presentation, there are many scenes where you see people falling towards you.  Glass shattering from a computer screen or window and the glass shards are coming towards you.  Even scenes where Sadako pops out of the screen and looks as she is going to strangle you.  The 3D is by no means the greatest, but it is effective when trying to get scare people or get them to jump out of their seats.

It's important that one owns a 3D-enabled Blu-ray player and television to play this film on 3D.  Otherwise, if you don't have  these devices, you can still watch the 2D version on Blu-ray.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Sadako 3D"" is presented in Japanese DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and Stereo.  I was impressed by the fact that there are scenes that tend to the utilize the surround and rear surround channels quite well.  From glass shattering to high pitch screams. The ambiance is also quite spooky at times and the sounds of Sadako or the monsters are creepy and makes the viewing experience quite creepy.  There are scenes with some LFE, especially during a low rumble during an earthquake but this is a film that utilizes ambiance and shock value to scare the audience, especially when Sadako jumps out of a screen.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""Sadako 3D"" comes with no special features.

EXTRAS:

""Sadako 3D"" comes with a lenticular slipcover.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When it comes to ""Sadako 3D"", I often think about the ""Friday the 13th"", ""Halloween"", ""Paranormal Activity"" films.  Many people feel the original are better and with each film churned out each year or every other year,, they seem to get worse and worse.

Yes, it's subjective to the viewer but when it comes to the ""Ring"" series, what made the original much more captivating is its deep storyline and its creepiness but also, the original ""Ring"" film had a pretty solid cast with popular actors Nanako Matsushima and Hiroyuki Sanada featured in the film.

While its counterpart ""Rasen"" (filmed at the same time and released on the same day back in January 1998) did miserably in the box office, a sequel was made the following year titled ""Ring 2 and a prequel titled ""Ring 0: Birthday"" which actually features Sadako Yamamura as the film's protagonist).

As the prequel was satisfying, it tinkered with the Sadako history of having two Sadako's.  With ""Sadako 3D"", takes the story into a whole new direction with a mad scientist known as Seiji Kashiwada experimenting on women in order to revive Sadako and so, she can find the ideal host and take over her.

While the concept makes me want to roll my eyes and shake my head of what has happened to the whole ""Ring"" film series and where it's headed, I also realize how popular the character of Sadako really is.  In Japan, there was a Sadako parade of long haired individuals wearing white to promote the film, a large Sadako with her hands reaching forward being driven throughout Tokyo.  And to this day, a good number of pranks are shown on television (and make it on YouTube).  For the most part, people can't get enough of Sadako because they love the scare factor.

So, while the films are not as deep as the original first film, they still provide that additional scare factor that Japanese want to see in horror films and what best than to take advantage of the situation by bringing Sadako to the modern age without VHS tapes but on computer screens and cell phones.  Making Sadako now being able to reach her victims through online video and now scaring people in 3D.

While ""Sadako 3D"" is a ""Ring"" film, aside from Sadako, there really is no major connection to past films aside that people are dying and there is an investigation of what is causing the deaths.

As a commercial 3D film, the film is effective when it uses 3D to scare people out of their seats.  While 3D effects show glass shards flowing towards you, it's Sadako jumping out of the screen that scares people.  Adding the creepy ambiance, ""Sadako 3D"" does have its creepy moments.  As a horror film, this is not one to scare you or sicken you.  There is little blood, there is violence via strangulation or people shooting themselves, getting hit by a car or falling off a building but other than that, this is not a film that even those who freak out during horror films will find themselves covering their eyes.

While the 3D film on Blu-ray is effective when it comes to 3D and lossless audio, it's lacking of any special features unfortunately.

Overall, ""Sadako 3D"" is definitely nowhere near the same fright factor or storyline of the original ""Ring"" film and truthfully none of the four films after the first film has lived up to the original and probably, never will.

But what makes ""Sadako 3D"" different than the other films is that Sadako now can scare you via 3D.  But is that enough to recommend?  For those wanting a horror film on Blu-ray 3D, maybe.",1372896000,2,6563,4.6129310344827585
5540047,1,B00B063UC8,"Ack!  This is horrible.  Familiar premise to Ring (Ringu) fans -- a cursed video claims lives mysteriously.  Unfortunately from the beginning this film has three strikes against it: 1.) everyone by now is at least passingly familiar with the cursed video concept; 2.) this movie does not make a convincing progression on this concept (a mad loner wants to strike back by harnessing the power of Sadako simply because his website got ""burned"" i.e. criticized?); 3.) the 3D gimmick and the CGI thrown in look like they were done on someone's home computer -- badly done and inserted randomly in the movie.  The actresses and actors are good enough, but due to the bad script, direction, and effects this movie is completely scare-free for me.  Out of desperation or lack of ideas the roughly last one third becomes something like a Universal monster movie (but making less sense); and then, worst of all, ... well, I'm not going to give out a spoiler but let's just say this movie does not end like the other Ringu movies. In fact, this movie has nothing to do with the other Ring movies -- not in terms of director, actors, or even storyline.  Give it a miss.",1372464000,7,1158,4.651960784313726

5540049,3,B00B063UC8,"The Ringu franchise gets a 21st century update in this fourth instalment of the classic horror series. Coming over a decade after Ring 0, Sadako 3D was a real chance to kickstart the ailing series and give renewed life to Koji Suzuki's classic story. Sadly, although the film starts well and manages to update key elements of the Sadako folklore, it is ultimately let down by a bizarre finale and its completely pointless use of 3D. We are left to wonder whether Sadako should have perhaps stayed down the well.

The film begins with the suicide of a disgraced artist, broadcast via webcam to a handful of people on a video sharing website. Although the video is promptly deleted, it soon becomes notorious throughout Japan as ""the cursed video"" after rumours emerge that all who watch it take their own lives shortly thereafter. The legend is particularly popular among teenagers, who scour the net 24/7 trying to find a working link among the `404 not found' error pages.

The film's protagonist, Akane, is a high school teacher drawn into the legend after one of her students apparently commits suicide while watching the clip. As more and more of her class expose themselves to the danger, Akane learns of a connection between the suicidal artist and the notorious Sadako legend from a decade earlier. Could Sadako be behind this latest cursed video? If so, what does she want this time? And how can she be stopped?

For fans of American horror, Sadako 3D is to Ringu what Scream 4 was to Scream: a reimagining of the original story, transferred to a modern setting with modern technology, and with characters who are aware of the previous films' events. Where Scream 4 failed was in trying to merge the original premise - of teenagers being isolated and stalked in a small town - with the modern setting, never really answering the question of how a 21st century teenager can ever be 'isolated' in an era of smartphones and mobile internet. By contrast, the writers of Sadako 3D recognise that the original film's premise would seem dated today, and use advances in technology to their advantage.

For starters, Sadako no longer needs a television set to wreak her revenge: the creepy long-haired girl appears from smartphones, laptops and even electronic advertising boards. It's a useful ploy that means characters are never really safe wherever they are, and it works well. What also succeeds is the uncertainty of the 'cursed video': instead of a tape that characters either watch (and be damned, exactly seven days later) or don't watch (and be safe), the video is an online stream that moves about the internet, appearing at random on computers or smartphones that have previously searched for it. This means you are never really sure when (or if) a character will be next, giving a breath of fresh air to what could have been considered, by now, a tired concept.

All of that, though, is completely undermined by the final act, where the director (for some inexplicable reason) decides to crossover a decent paranormal ghost story with a creature feature - with predictably terrible results. Without spoiling the full details in this review, nuances from the Sadako legend are reduced to Silent Hill-like zombie creatures, almost leaving the viewer unsure if they're still watching the same film. Of course, genre crossovers are popular in Asian cinema and can be done successfully (see, e.g., Spellbound), but this just fails miserably. Things do get back on track somewhat for the ultimate finale, which satisfies to a point, but the damage has already been done by that stage.

Mention must also be made of the 3D effects. Although often a gimmick at the best of times, the extra dimension serves no purpose whatsoever here, being restricted to shots of Sadako's hand emerging from screens of various sizes - and that's about it. Moreover, since most of the (modest) budget appears to have been spent on the 3D apparatus, the film looks decidedly low-budget when watched in 2D, with some truly laughable CGI effects. I appreciate that the 3D `gimmick' may have been required to get this film made at all, but I do wonder whether the final act would have strayed so far from the Ringu folklore had the director not being able to cheat his way out of proper storytelling with the cheap, gimmicky effect.

Ultimately, then, we are left with the feeling of what could have been. With its decent overall premise and its intelligent use of technology to update the original story, this could have been the refreshing reboot needed to kickstart the Ringu franchise. As it is, Sadako 3D is a mere curiosity; worth a watch (for the first hour at least) if you enjoy the original films, but more likely (in the final act) to alienate existing fans than win over new ones.

8560174,4,B00B063UC8,"I find the feigned resentment at Sadako ""becoming a monster in Sadako 3D"" to be really wholly misplaced.  Sadako is a monster, right from the start, especially in the book series.  For those who have even the slightest intention of reading the books, I suggest reading no further, because this discussion will be highly spoilerific.  In the first book, it is established that before Sadako died, she was not only psychotic, but a powerful psychokinetic, and after she died, her hate for her mother's detractors and her rapist/killer caused her psychoactive paranormal abilities to combine with the last known case of the smallpox virus to mutate into a supernatual interactive disease.  The cursed videotape, then, is a monster that relays Sadako's mutated vengeance like a virus.  In the second book, Spiral, the viral nature of the curse is made explicit, and as in the unfairly-maligned first movie sequel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rasen/dp/B000US7L7W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rasen</a>&nbsp;(Spiral), her replication begins to take over the world, especially since pregnant women exposed to the videotape produce clones of Sadako that mature supernaturally quickly.  In the third book, Loop, it is revealed that Sadako's viral scenario took place in a virtual world (predating The Matrix by a year), but that her curse was so powerful that it broke through into our world in a more malignant mutated form: a supremely powerful version of cancer that affects all animal and plant life and inexorably spreads from one organ to another until the host is dead.  To save life as we know it in our own reality, the solution lies in bringing the antidote to Sadako's reality.  So, is Sadako a monster?  Yes, Sadako is a monster -- not a ghost -- despite what every movie outside of the first two (Ringu and Rasen) might lead you to believe.

Things change in Sadako 3D in order to update from videotape to cyberspace (from psycho-biological virus to computer viral propagation), but in the first four books (since you have to include the fourth volume, Birthday, which -- like the movie Paranormal Activity 2 -- is both prequel and sequel), the curse progresses from audiotape to videotape to printed word to film, so it's only a logical progression.  Likewise, to have Sadako's vengeful spirit take a further mutated (spider-like) form due to further influences brought to bear upon the pre-existent malignant energies isn't really all that big of a stretch.  Sadako, if nothing else, is a monster born of a hate that pre-existed her human death.

The Ring movies I have issue with all contain the number two in their titles: the Japanese Ring 2, the American Ring 2, and Sadako 3D 2.  These are the three that I feel really reach and miss.  The Japanese Ring 2 existed just to milk the Sadako-as-ghost filmic construct, the American Ring 2 tries to shoehorn Dark Water into the mythos, and Sadako 3D 2 seems to ignore Spiral and Loop's viral explosion of humanoid Sadako clones and Sadako 3D's explosion of spider mutations in favor of trying to create an actual offspring.

Of all the Ring movies, I find Sadako 3D to be the most inherently cinematic, and it's the only film in the series that I feel is worthwhile enough to justify having on Blu-ray as well as on DVD.  Most of the films are something that should be experienced, but Sadako 3D should not be just experienced, but seen.  Sadako's spider-incarnations are plenty scary because they are extensions of a supernatural force that can't be killed.
