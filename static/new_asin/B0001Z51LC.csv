2044485,4,B0001Z51LC,"This Disney film, based on a true story of a young man's quest in the mid-1800's to conquer a mountain in the Swiss Alps that claimed the life of his father 16 years earlier is visually stunning, realistic, and an exciting story. For those of us who are Michael Rennie fans, we get very few films in which Rennie has a featured role. In this one, as famed British mountain climber John Winter, who takes a liking to the young man and who helps him (James MacArthur) to reach his goal, Rennie shines and makes this 1959 movie a must for his fans.

The combination of Rennie, a rollicking adventure story, and the location filming in the Swiss Alps make this film a treat all around.",1125878400,7,681,4.404761904761905
2044486,4,B0001Z51LC,"THE STORY : Basically, young Rudi is the son of the best climbing guide in his village, who died tragically climbing the yet unconquered Matterhorn, or as they call it ""the Citadel"". Rudi's mother refuses to let her son climb, and he is going crazy for it if it were not for the love and understanding of Lizbeth. He strongly believes his father had discovered a secret path to the mountaintop that has so far eluded all other climbers. Rudi is always in trouble for sneaking away to climb on his own, when he is supposed to be washing dishes at the hotel. But the village is concerned over losing their reputation with the other villages, since their guides have been afraid to climb the mountain in the 16 years since the tragedy. When a famous British climber arrives with a guide from a rival village to climb the Citadel and also wants to hire local guides, Rudi and the village get their big chance at redeeming their reputation. There is a good moral lesson about thinking of others first. A very enjoyable dramatic story, it is true Disney wholesome family fare.

BEHIND THE SCENES TRIVIA: The movie was filmed entirely on location in Switzerland. Helicopters and mule trains were used to get the gear to the filming spots. Disney arranged for the actors to actually learn to climb in order to make the scenes that involved the actors more realistic. The long shots were usually filmed with doubles, and close range shots involved the real actors. In the case of the close-up shots the crew used movie magic to make the actors to appear high off the ground when they were not. James MacArthur really enjoyed the climbing and disappeared without authorization from the set in order to do some real climbing, which panicked the crew as an accident would delay filming.

Ken Annakin directed, and was regrouped with some of the cast for his next Disney Studio project, ""Swiss Family Robinson"". The character of the 18 year old young man named Rudi is well played by young James MacArthur, the son of Helen Hayes. She has a cameo in the film if you look closely. James also appeared in Disney's films ""Kidnapped"", ""Swiss Family Robinson"", and ""The Light in the Forest"". The part of Lizbeth was played by cheery Janet Munro (who also appeared in ""Darby and the Little People"", ""Swiss Family Robinson"", & ""The Horsemasters""); and Michael Rennie as Captain Winter. The climbing scenes are very well done and scenic.
Walt Disney took his family on vacation to Switzerland, and fell in love with the mountain and the book the story is derived from, ""Banner in the Sky"" by James Ramsey Ullman. In fact the author has a brief cameo as an American tourist in one scene. The book is based on a true story, and was adapted into a screenplay by Eleanore Griffin. Walt personally made the decision to turn the book into a movie, and the film held a special place in his heart, as well as his budget since this was an expensive undertaking. The mountain left such a deep impression on him that he later recreated it in 1/100th scale at Disneyland with the Matterhorn Mountain and Bobsleds attraction. The film was released in theatres on November 10, 1959 at 107 minutes in length. The episode was re-edited for release as a two episode show on the Walt Disney's `Wonderful World of Color' television show in 1963. It was subsequently renamed after the original book, ""Banner in the Sky"". Each episode had its own title, the first being ""To Conquer the Mountain"", and the 2nd being ""The Killer Mountain"". It first aired on February 17, and 24, 1963. It re-aired on March 5, and 12, 1972. The theatrical edit of the film was first released on VHS in 1986 and DVD on September 7, 2004.

DVD QUALITY: Let me start off by saying that if you are looking to buy a copy to upgrade your old VHS copy of the same film, SAVE YOUR MONEY. Since they decided not to re-master the film and it has been poorly preserved, the 2004 DVD version of the film has scratches, poor sound, and bad color, and was in full screen rather than wide screen. No extras even though there are tons of footage that could have been used. I would have liked to see the trailer, footage of Walt talking about the film, and from his trip to Switzerland, the original 1955 Disney ""People and Places"" travelogue on Switzerland, and maybe a piece on the Matterhorn ride at Disneyland. So hold onto your VHS copy if you have one, or buy a used on here at Amazon rather than encourage Disney to keep up this butcher job on such great films.",1115596800,135,4489,4.566997518610422
2044487,2,B0001Z51LC,"Having read the cautionary reviews of my colleagues, regarding the quality of the dvd, I decided to purchase ""Third Man On The Mountain"" anyway. I, too, became enthralled with the story in grade school when I read Banner In The Sky and eagerly ran to the theater to see the story brought to life on film. You all know the tale, so I won't bore the reader by repeating it. The DVD transfer is a disgrace! Grainy, poor color correction; very painful to watch. I had hoped that the other reviewers were just being too technically critical, but they were spot on! If Disney is going to bring a film to DVD, it owes the consumer AND the filmmakers the courtesy of presenting the movie in the best possible manner! Disney failed us all miserably, and - because TMOTM is not a Disney ""classic"" it is likely we will never again see the pristine cinematography so lovingly shot back in the 50's. One other thing - could not determine if the film was ever shot in 'scope; was it just 1.33:1 aspect ratio originally?

My advice -don't buy the DVD unless you have no concern for quality. I returned mine and instead watch my old laserdisc (which was, in fact, a better transfer).",1106956800,51,1167,4.47887323943662
2044488,5,B0001Z51LC,"If you would like a great drama with awesome scenery. Get this . It's much better than many of the silly movies Disney's come up with that people rave over. It has substance to it. It has a really great moral lesson but it also holds your attention throughout. My children love it and have watched

 it 3 times in 10 days and I enjoy watching it just as much as they do. Too bad more of Disney's films weren't like this one.",1102032000,9,424,4.096385542168675
2044489,3,B0001Z51LC,"I love this movie and was delighted to see it appear at last on DVD.  That is until I watched it.  I was going to comment on the picture quality of this new DVD, but someone in New York beat me to it.  All I can do is agree with that individual.

I worked at the Disney Studios in the 1970's in 16mm film distribution (just prior to the coming of home video).  I distributed 16mm prints of this title.  A new 16mm print struck at that time had a much better picture quality than the element used to make this current DVD transfer.  The main problem is negative dirt.  It's like watching a film in a snow storm.  The N.Y. reviewer also correctly observed that the color correction was uneven.

Some audiences do not notice these technical flaws.  Yet those in the industry have spent decades trying to improve the quality of how to present film product.  DVDs are marketed on this very point.  After all, what else do studios have to offer but their inventories?  If all the Hollywood studios can agree to spend millions of dollars over the years investing in the latest technology, then they must care how to present their work in the best possible light.  Or not, apparently.

For over three decades, video equipment has existed that can electronically ""clean up"" much of the dirt and some of the scratches that show up on video from a poor original source.  The best way is to strike a new interpositive from the camera original negative (the original should first be chemically ""washed"").  You color correct when you make the digital transfer.  I have overseen this process many times during my years in the video trarnsfer business.  In this way, you will create the absolute best transfer possible.  Otherwise, why bother?

I must also observe that this problem exists with many new Disney DVD transfers, and from films far more recent than THIRD MAN.  Unfortunately, Disney isn't the only studio going ""on the cheap.""  I just saw a new DVD of MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS.  I think the print/negative they used must have first been run over BY the Orient Express.

This is now almost an exact science.  It also isn't that cost prohibitive when you consider the length of time a DVD will last.  Don't you want your name on the BEST quality product?  Poor workmanship shows.  I must say that this transfer does not show the pride the Disney people put into their work when I was at the Studio (in the pre-Eisner days).

On the plus side, the soundtrack is fairly clean, although here, too, great advances have been made in ""cleaning up"" and fully restoring audio elements.  Just having THIRD MAN ON THE MOUNTAIN available on video again isn't enough, especially when you don't care (and here I'll borrow a tag line) ""to send the very best.""",1096675200,107,2744,4.582304526748971
2044490,4,B0001Z51LC,"First, the good news: this is one of my favorite of all the live action Disney movies and it is wonderful to finally see it again. If you enjoy beautiful scenery, the mountain climbing sequences in here display some of the best (though admittedly, some scenes are clearly matte paintings - but who cares? They're still beautiful!). The story is essentially predictable, but that doesn't distract for the wonderful atmosphere created in this film. It is well worth watching.

Now, the bad news...and the reason I could not give this DVD a full five stars: the DVD transfer is poor. The film print they used is fine considering it's age and generally looks rather good. However, and I don't know this as fact, I strongly suspect that they did not do a new film transfer for this DVD release. I think they used an old 3/4"" tape - very likely the same source tape used when they released this film on VHS tape and laserdisc way back when. On the DVD, you can see very slight and subtle analog hits in the tape - the type that don't occur on digital source tapes. Not to mention, the color correction and brightness which someone did an atrocious job with - again, probably when trying to remaster the 3/4"" tape rather than a new pristine film transfer which is what should have been done. The color correction is not SO bad (though some of the skin tones look awful), but there are portions of peoples faces that are washed out in certain scenes due to someone incompetent being behind the brightness/contrast controls - did Disney use a summer intern to prepare this DVD release?

I think that someone just threw an old 3/4"" tape of this movie into a deck and badly tweaked the colors and brightness/contrast while it was running to DVD - that's it. Easy and cheap and a very sub-standard result.

So, major points to Disney for finally releasing this great movie, but major strikes against them for doing such a poor job on maintaining any standards in the DVD quality. They obviously cut some serious corners to save money and it definitely shows.

All that being said, I still love this movie and am thrilled to have it on DVD at all. Don't let my ranting fool you - for those who truly love it, it is still watchable and young children probably won't notice any difference. I'm not going to get rid of my copy, but let's hope that Disney gets their act together and releases this film in one of those Special Vault Disney editions....and that they go back to the original film rather than some aged 3/4"" tape.",1095292800,25,2510,4.5342163355408385
2044491,5,B0001Z51LC,"After reading Banner in the Sky as a boy of twelve, Third Man on the Mountain was released in Australia and it has captured my imagination ever since. The film is an exceptional adaptation of a fine novel and contains all the wonderful qualities of Disney live action films of that era.

  Shot on location in Switzerland, this film is one of the rare productions which conveys genuine atmosphere to the viewer. It never fails to give me the impression that everyone involved in the production is having a really great time.

  Of particular interest is the performance of Laurence Naismith as Teo Zurbriggen. He captures the character of the book perfectly. Another highlight for me is the way in which the background characters create realism and atmosphere in every scene.

  I have been searching for a copy of this title for more than twenty years as it has never been released in Australia. I'm excited!",1093824000,11,909,4.7756410256410255

This is one of Disney's finest and I hope you will get it and enjoy it as much as I have.  The mountain climbing scenes are really great...and of course it has James MacArthur Jr in it.

2044504,3,B0001Z51LC,This is one of a handful of great movies about mountain climbing ever made and it is based on true events.  The original movie was a triumph of film making given the huge size of professional camera equipment and the forbidding vertical rock faces.  The actors do a fine job and the period sets are true to the time.  Why then only three stars?  This is one of the worst transfers I have in my entire collection.  It is like they tossed dirt at a great painting and didn't bother to to clean it up before hanging it up on the wall.  There are bits of what can only be dirt and flecks of missing emulsion during the opening scenes and while it does get better it can only be discribed as pathetic.  The fine acting and great story manages to overcome most of the image issues which makes this worth buying while hoping that some day they will issue a blue ray disk worthy of the original movie.,1498694400,4,893,4.2485207100591715
2044505,3,B0001Z51LC,"This is a great movie, but it only gets 3 stars due to the shoddy print used for this DVD. Definitely one of the poorer Disney efforts as far as picture quality -- lots of dirt specks and color is lacking. I DVR'ed this film off of TCM a few years ago and the picture quality was immaculate. Definitely not the case with this DVD. Also no bonus material whatsoever. TCM aired a Disney documentary about the making of this film on location in the Swiss Alps which would have been a perfect addition to this DVD. This film deserves much better treatment from Disney.",1497312000,4,564,4.380952380952381

2044511,5,B0001Z51LC,"While 3rd Man.. is a not widely known today, it's a EPIC MASTERPIECE by Walt Disney.  The movie was made by Disney in 1959 in the Golden Era of Disney Live Action movies.  Some of the best came out of this era, movies like Davy Crocket, Ol Yeller, and The Shaggy Dog.  You've probably heard of those movies, but for some reason 3rd Man isn't recognized.  I think it's mainly because Disney hasn't distributed this movie like it has the other movies.

Why the Movie is a Disney MasterPiece:
1.  The Story: This movie is based on a book called ""Banner in the Sky"" which won a Newbery Honor when published.  So Disney had a great foundation to make the movie.  The dialogue is clever and the story moves along at a good pace and keeps your attention throughout the picture.

2. The Director Ken Annakin:  Annakin was one of the first Live Action Directors that Disney used.  This was his third Disney movie, the other two Sword and the Rose, and Robin Hood are unknown to American Audiences but familiar to the English Audience.  His work on this movie is wonderful from how he utilizes the setting to points of view especially in tight spaces is very well done.

3.  The Cast:  There are several familiar faces in this movie.  You have supporting actors like James Donald, most famous to me for his role in the WWII epic, The Great Escape, Michael Rennie, famous for the Day the Earth Stood Still, and Herbert Lom from the Pink Panther series.

The two lead actors are from the Disney Stable, the lead actor is James MacArthur.  MacArthur played in several other Disney films most notably The Swiss Family Robinson.  He is also famous for the TV series, Hawaii Five-O.  MacArthur does a great job in the role and should be credited for the physical demands of the character.

The other lead is Janet Munro.  Munro also played in several other Disney Films including Swiss Family Robinson.  This, I believe, is her best role of any Disney Movie she was in.  Her joyful personality is really displayed in this movie.

4.  The Setting:  The Matterhorn is breathtaking, and the valleys around it and the town Zermatt where the movie was filmed are so beautiful I want to go there and see it for myself.  The mountain really is the star of the show.

The ride at Disneyland, the Matterhorn, is based on this movie.

This movie is takes a big subject and does it justice.  I would put it in with the other masterpieces like Swiss Family Robinson, Parent Trap, and 20,000 Leagues under the Sea.

ps. There are some bad reviews on here, but many are old and reflect the DVD and not the movie.  I bought this to watch on Amazon Video, and found no problems with the quality of the picture.",1487116800,8,2678,4.4896265560165975

2044582,5,B0001Z51LC,"What a pleasure this movie gives.  The movie was filmed at Zermatt, Switzerland which is at the base of the Matterhorn, and on the Matterhorn itself.  Walt Disney's favorite British director, Ken Annakin, directed it.  James MacArthur stars, and Janet Munro is his girlfriend.  They would collaborate again with Annakin on Swiss Family Robinson.  This is a story about teamwork and getting second chances.  The young man played by James MacArthur is named Rudi Matt.  Rudi's father was killed climbing a mountain called the Citadel, and Rudi has a passion to climb it himself to the top.  No one has yet conquered the mountain.  The townspeople are petty about people from other villages wanting to climb ""their"" mountain, but Rudi's family resists letting him try, even though he's the only one in town who is eager to.  Captain John Winter is an Englishman who is on good terms with everyone, an internationally renowned mountain climber, and he wants Rudi to have the opportunity, but a guide with Cpt. Winter named Emil Saxo, who's from another village, resents Rudi for this, and the authorities in Rudi's family are not supportive.  His employer and girlfriend and Cpt. Winter are, however.  The relationships are quite interesting and complex, and the emotional elements such as suspense, wonder, and romance are well-balanced.  The subtitle option on the DVD is very helpful, as they often don't articulate clearly and the introduction of several characters would've otherwise really confused me.  I think it's a really nice movie, containing that blend of excitingness but tameness (suitable for even young children) which Walt Disney knew how to do with his live-action movies.  It also has a good moral that others are more important than accomplishment.",1427414400,,1765,5.1223776223776225

James MacArthur plays Rudi Matt, a dishwasher by trade, who wants more than anything to be a guide like his father, who died on the Citadel.  Encouraging him in this enterprise is his father's former partner Teo Zurbriggen (Laurence Naismith) and Rudi's girlfriend Lizbeth (Janet Munro).  Soon enough, another ally appears, Michael Rennie as Captain John Winter, a renowned climber who very much admired Rudi's father.  Beholden to Rudi for saving his life, the experienced climber Winter does everything he can to support Rudi's dream.  Getting past his tyrannical uncle (James Donald as Franz Lerner) is quite another matter.

This film has more than its share of drama and spectacle (which is all but lost with a mediocre transfer).  Still, it's a good film about overcoming obstacles whether they are mountains or mothers.

The story revolves around a young man and the precious family hes working for as a dishwasher in a Switzerland restaurant. Hes looking out the window dreaming of climbing a particular dangerous mountain to put his fathers shirt wrapped around his climbing tool as a marker to his fathers death, who lost his life trying to climb that very mountain.

The music and scenes of the country of Switzerland and the accompanying mountains are awesome and inspiring and contribute to the unfolding drama.

The actors chosen to portray their roles are perfectly cast. The young man is played by James Macarthur and the lovely and exceptional, vivacious young girl, is played by Janet Munro. The supporting actors are Michael Rennie and James Donald.

Not that either are particularly complex: James MacArthur is the son of a legendary guide who died trying to save a climber on the deadly Citadel, the only mountain in the area that has never been climbed and which kills most of those who make the attempt. Dreaming of becoming a guide himself, he's relegated to the kitchen of the local hotel that has done very nicely out of the fame his father's death has brought the village, his uncle (James Donald) determined to keep firmly down on the ground for his mother's sake while girlfriend Janet Munro and former guide Laurence Naismith know that's not going to happen. Things start looking up when he saves the life of Michael Rennie's legendary climber, who's planning his own assault on the Citadel, but none of the town's guides will go with him...

It's the kind of well-crafted old-fashioned storytelling that still holds up very well indeed, with an appealing cast, some gorgeous Technicolor photography of some stunning Swiss locations and some impressive footage on the mountains themselves that isn't over-reliant on Peter Ellenshaw's occasional matte painting. There are plenty of familiar faces in the cast, from Herbert Lom's reliably bad tempered guide from a rival village, locals Ferdy Mayne and a very recognisable but unbilled Roger Delgado (the Master from Doctor Who) and even an unbilled cameo for MacArthur's mother Helen Hayes. Only the usually reliable James Donald, who specialised in playing the understated voice of reason in tales of obsession like Bridge on the River Kwai, is a bit more awkward playing outside his comfort zone as the stern, occasionally belligerent uncle, but it's more a performance that occasionally wavers in the wrong direction before righting itself than one that hurts the picture. It's still hugely entertaining, so it's little surprise that Disney would reunite MacArthur, Munro and Annakin for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Swiss-Family-Robinson-Vault-Disney-Collection/dp/B00005RRG7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Swiss Family Robinson (Vault Disney Collection)</a>&nbsp;the following year.

The opening shots have the potential to be SO beautiful, but are marred by grainy, dirty prints that seem to constantly have the color fluttering. After the establishing shots, though, it does get somewhat better. Certainly it's easily watchable, but I was just left with the feeling that it could have been so much more. Oh, how I'd love to see that scenery (and Janet Munro) in high def!

As to the movie, it's been discussed in other reviews. Overall I very much enjoyed it. It's a little slow at times, but it kept my interest, and had a good, though slightly unexpected ending.

The interesting part is that years later as an adult, I met Jim MacArthur on a flight to Honolulu, HI May 18th 1985.  The reason I remember the date so well, is that it was my Fathers birthday and my first trip to the island.  I ended up sitting next to Jim and he invited me to a dinner.  Well, one thing led to another and I ended up staying at his condo on Kalakaua Ave for the rest of my vacation.  After which time, we parted and I thought I would never see him again.  I was mistaken...we met again and again and again..Jim was a gem to be around. Fun, generous and a happy-go-lucky personality who loved to travel and show me things.  Our time spent together has left an imprint on my heart forever.  He ended up marrying another woman, as I found out later he had a child with her.  We spoke a few times after that..When I heard that he had passed away about 1.5 years ago. I stopped on the way home from work and had a ""gin and tonic"" in his honor.  I know he would have liked that.  He will always be missed forever.  I truly loved that man, but it was just not meant to be.",1336176000,,1351,3.9925373134328357

I have always been of fan of Disney movies, ever since I was a child, and ""Third Man on the Mountain"" doesn't disappoint the viewer. There are many beautiful scenes that make me wish that I could visit the Alps, but there are times when you can tell that they are not on location. Of course, considering the decade that the movie was made, it is well done.

I was lucky enough to work in Germany for more than 20 years so the trip to Switzerland was the matter of less than 3 hours on the autobahn.  I used to spend at least a week every year in Zermatt and all the peaks shown so well in the film became like old friends which you could recognize from any angle. One small nit I would pick with the film was the way they kept showing the mountains around Chamonix when all the climbing was supposed to be in Switzerland near Zermatt. I also wonder why they thought they had to change the name on the Monte Rosa hotel and even the name of the Mattertal.  I made only one serious attempt to climb the Matterhorn but was turned back by storms on top.  By the way, the guided fee for that hill is now over $1,200 as of this August.  I used to scan the TV guide each week hoping to see this film being broadcast so I could tape it but never did see it listed until it was shown on one of the HD channels just a few weeks ago from which I then found the CD on Amazon.

Young Rudi Matt (James MacArthur) wants desperately to be a famous climbing guide like his late father and finally gets the chance to accompany an English climber (Michael Rennie) on a trek up the never-before-scaled mountain.

If you like mountain climbing, you'll love this movie which was beautifully filmed on location in Zermatt and the Matterhorn.  The story is pure Disney with an idealist hero, his spunky girl friend (Janet Munroe), and lot of loveable villagers looking after them.  MacArthur is sweet and boyish and contrasts well with Rennie's sophisticated gentleman.  The first half of the movie was more interesting for me than the anti-climatic ascent (with Herbert Lom as a grumpy villain), but it's a feel-good movie all the same.

I particularly enjoyed this movie for its excellent scenery, the precarious climbing scenes, the energy of the climbers, not forgetting the actors themselves, and the promotion of good family values vs self-preservation.

Watching this movie is like a breath of fresh mint.  The presence of Michael Rennie lends credence to the story, it is like watching Sir Edmund Hillary make his unforgettable Everest attempt.  Watch out for James MacArthur's mother and fiance who had a bit part in the village scene.  Janet Munro also impressed as James MacArthur's girl friend.",1230336000,3,925,5.174496644295302
2044736,5,B0001Z51LC,"Third Man on the Mountain is, without question, one of the finest movies that Disney turned out in the late 50's.  I saw this movie as an 11 year old and was captivated immediately.  Comparing Third Man to some of the Disney product today will tell you just how far that company as slipped in the effort to make a profit, and more broadly, how much our society has changed.

With a cast of first rate actors that include Michael Rennie (Capt. John Winter), James MacArthur (Rudi Matt), Janet Munro (Lizbeth Hempel, Rudi's love interest) who sadly, died in 1972, Herbert Lom, a wonderful character actor (Emil Saxo), and James Donald (Franz Lerner, Rudi's stepfather) and then a wonderful director in Ken Annakin, Third Man on the Mountain is certainly a worthwhile movie to watch.  I agree with another reviewer that today's children may not sit for the long wind-up to the movies climatic ending, and that is a shame.

Filmed on location in the area surrounding the Matterhorn and with many scenes shot from the side of a mountain, the cinematography is first rate, though the print that made the DVD copy certainly wasn't up to par.  The DVD product also lacks many of the extra features we've become so accustomed to, but other reviewers have discussed these facts.  This should not keep you from purchasing this wonderful movie, however.

Rudi's father, a climbing guide, was killed while climbing the Matterhorn when Rudi was a small child because he refused to leave an injured climber.  Rudi, knowing the story, is very much caught up, not only in adoring his father's memory, but in wanting to conquer the mountain that took his father's life.  Constantly testing and developing his climbing skills on smaller peaks in the area, he works as a dishwasher in the local hotel; not the life the son of a famous climber should be living.  On one of these outings he finds Capt. Winters trapped in a crevasse and manages to single-handedly save this world famous climber.  Having been befriended by Capt. Winter, Rudi's taste for climbing only grows stronger.  Acting against his stepfathers orders, he ends up on the Matterhorn, with Winters, and others and in the end history repeats itself.

Full of adventure, suspense, and nail biting drama, Third Man is a terrific children's movie and though lacking any hint of off color humor, should appeal to certain adults as well.

I strongly recommend.",1217808000,11,2401,4.836185819070905
2044737,5,B0001Z51LC,"This movie inspired me to become a mountain climber, scaling the second highest mountain in California at the age of 11.  Fourteen years later (1977) I spent 10 days at the base of the Matterhorn (German words Matte, meaning meadow, and Horn, which means peak) hoping to scale the mountain of my dreams and that inspired me to climb mountains.  Much to my disappointment, due to extremely hot weather causing numerous avalanches, the Matterhorn never reopened for climbing; and I never got to scale the ""Citadel.""  As compensation,  I had skied the slopes of the Matterhorn in 1975 and 1976!  But in those 10 days I hiked all around the area, recognizing and enjoying even more the beauty of the Zermatt region, before hiking down river to cross over the pass used by Hannibal to cross the Alps with his elephants.  Moreover, during the three years I was stationed in Germany, I managed to climb three Alps in Germany, two in Switzerland, and one in Austria--all because of ""Third Man on the Mountain.""

The spectacular scenery and wonderful photography of climbing and living in that scenery, are not the only wonders of this daring film.  ""Third Man on the Mountain"" is, perhaps more so than of mountain climbing, a story about friendship, duty, honor, and self-sacrifice--all values that I assimilated into my own belief system that has guided my life.  It demonstrates the codes and necessary attributes of being a mountain climber; be it professional guide or capable enthusiast.  In deed, I wish more--if not most--climbers I have encountered in my life would watch and heed the morals of ""Third Man on the Mountain.""

It is from this value system that the movie derives the name ""Third Man on the Mountain.""  Michael Rennie as Captain John Winter, lead by Herbert Lom as Emil Saxo--a guide from another village--and accompanied by James MacArthur as Rudi Matt and James Donald as Franz Lerner, are encamped below the final ascent, and Emil Saxo attempts to convince Franz Lerner to leave the injured Captain John Winter and climb to the top to claim the ""glory"" of being the first to ""conquer"" the mountain.  But Franz will have nothing to do with it, so early the next morning Emil takes off on his own; but Rudi Matt hears him leave and follows him--also alone.  Emile falls, is injured, and cynically tells Rudi to go and be the hero.  But Rudi's value system prevails and he helps Emil back to the base camp.  While preparing Emil for the ordeal, Franz and Captain Winter unwittingly pass by--as they cannot see Rudi and Emil below them--and successfully ascend to the top.  There Captain Winter in true companionship ties a red ""banner"" at the peak in memory of Rudi's father and Rudi himself; for if Rudi had gone back, instead of staying with the injured Emil, Rudi would have in fact been the ""Third Man on the Mountain.""  It is Rudi's duty, honor, and self-sacrifice, that prevent him from vanity and glory, but earn him true friends and a reputation as a true mountain climber and guide.

""Third Man on the Mountain"" is the epitome of ""wholesome family movies"" that Walt Disney strove to make.  But, please do not let this prevent you from deciding to buy/watch ""Third Man on the Mountain.""  Please watch it because it is a wonderfully engaging movie; it is a tour of the Alps; it is about man's desire to go where others/few dare to go; it is about mountain climbing; and it is a quick glance into the culture of 1800s Switzerland and the Alps.  Watch ""Third Man on the Mountain"" to see a movie that deserves far more attention than it gets--especially in light of all the complaints about the DVD itself.  On the other hand, I must also state that in this era of high tech and fast past living, many--especially younger children--may find the pace too slow: ""Third Man on the Mountain"" is a movie you enjoy and enter into, not a movie that ""stimulates"" or ""thrills"" rather than engaging.

As for the ""technical"" complaints about the poor quality of the film in DVD format, the full screen format, and the lack of supplemental features, I can say that they are all true.  But for such a great film, I can only say that it is a fool who lets that get in the way.  In deed, for many of us old enough to remember, the film quality is nothing new: I have seen such ""dirty"" films in theaters and on television!

For a good ""historical"" note about the Matterhorn I recommend you look at Wickipedia to learn more about the various attempts to scale the mountain.

This movie is based on the true story of Rudi Matt and his famous mountain climb. It was shot with great cinematography in Zermatt, Switzerland.

This  is a great family film. I am a fan of classic 50 and 60's disney, they don't make them as good  today as did then. Today, most Disney films are played for laughes. They don't make films like this anymore

 The cast of James MacArthur, Janet Munro, Micheal Rennie and a Pre Pink Panther-ed Herbert Lom mesh in this high adventure mountain climbing drama. Look for a Cameo  by Helen Hayes (MacArthur's mom).

This film is a simple adventure  tale that Disney film told in the late 1950-1960's. These sorta alive action pictures were run as second features to the Disney cartoons when they were released to theaters. Later they were run as a feature on Wonderful World of Disney TV show

You can see the great hand of Walt himself at work. This simple tale has no special effects..just the effects of the human condition and the scenic views of the swiss alps that nature blessed us with. This type of a motion picture is  a story a family can watch together. I wish there were more of these type of classic film chestnuts from Disney library available on DVD to watch today to share with the younger people

2044743,4,B0001Z51LC,"As put very well before by other reviews, this is a poor quality DVD. We all obviously bought it because we love the movie. No denying it is one of Disney's best. It is appalling to think they could not spend a little money to clean up the quality of the picture. The sound seemed okay, but could use some improvement. The picture and color was spotted and slightly grainy especially at the beginning of the movie. I had read reviews here and knew it wasn't going to be good but I bought it anyway because I am hoping that when Disney has seen the interest in their old movies they may go back and clean them up and make better releases. Most of the older Disney movies have been restored or reprinted from better copies. Two movies, ""The Journey of Natty Gann"" and this one are very poor quality transfers. Unless you don't have a copy on VHS or you just want even a poor quality picture of this movie you may want to wait. Personally I did not want to wait since it may be years before Disney studios come to their senses and restore all their classic live action movies before putting them on DVD. This DVD does not include any extras either.

The story is a good one with a great cast, camera work, and music. When a young man dreams about climbing mountains like his father, he finds it tough to prove himself. Our hero Rudi's father was killed on the mountain by an avalanche while guiding another climber. The whole towns guides have not climbed ""The Citadel"" for fifteen years since. When Rudi convinces his Uncle to let him climb as a porter, his chances of proving himself improve. Unfortunately he put his own wants above the climbing party and it almost leads to disaster. When he later puts the welfare of another guide over his dreams of reaching the top, he truly proves how worthy he has become. I would have given this movie five stars but I took one star off for Disney being so inconsiderate and not restoring this fine movie. If you are willing to suffer the poor picture quality, it is a great mountain climbing movie. If you liked ""The Mountain"" with Spencer Tracy and Robert Wagner, you will probably enjoy this one too. One can only hope they reproduce this after restoring it and even include some interviews or even a documentary about the mountains climbing history.
