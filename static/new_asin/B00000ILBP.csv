1222695,4,B00000ILBP,"A tank driver, an actor, a big buff fighter and elves that have to be stripped.
This ranges from painfully funny to deadly serious.
If you liked Slayers you'll more than likely enjoy this.",1006041600,6,188,4.5588235294117645
1222696,5,B00000ILBP,"'Those Who Hunt Elves' is a wonderfully written series, while not on the serious side, this Anime focuses mainly on humor. Only in Those Who Hunt Elves, would people get teleported to another world with a Tank in tow. Another rare quality is that the anime is actually well dubbed! Although as most dubbing, the side characters don't have the best voices, but the main character's english voices are enjoyable to hear, and act thier emotions exceptionally well. If you're searching for a lot of laughs, this DVD is definately the key. Keep an eye out for the next DVD release, because after you see the first half, you definately will want the rest.",1005091200,5,649,4.701754385964913
1222697,5,B00000ILBP,"While the title may brand it a bit risque, this anime is actually pretty tame.  Well tame in the sense there aren't really a bunch of naked elves running around.  This series' wit and humor make it a classic and a must own for anyone who truely enjoys both anime and a good laugh.  Between a bigheaded fighter, a militant teenager, an actress who is almost too smart, and an elven leader forced to live out the series in the body of a dog you really can't go wrong.  And the whole stripping every elf they come across thing helps too.  So pick it up and remember that there is a Those Who Hunt Elves 2 that will be released as well.",1003017600,10,632,4.147540983606557
1222698,5,B00000ILBP,Despite a few misgivings about the idea (two girls and a guy and their tank wandering around a fantasy universe stripping pretty elf girls)I was actually surprised to find that 'Those who hunt Elves' was actually quite funny. The very absurdity of the situation is amusing and the use of modern technology is well handled. Also a mention must go to the supremely vain Elf Priestess Celcia who managed to cause all the trouble in the first place and get trapped in the body of a little dog. Things really go wrong for her in a big way... Basically 'Those who hunt Elves' is a funny show and because there's no nudity - the humour is about embarrassment its suitable for just about anyone who has a dislike of all those stuck-up elves in Dungeons and Dragons.,996710400,,757,4.532846715328467
1222699,4,B00000ILBP,"Though the first tape seems to start off right in the middle of the story, you quickly find out this isn't a problem.  Three people from the future, a martial artist, a movie star, and a gun crazy schoolgirl, need to strip as many attrative female elves as necessary to find the tatooed pieces of a spell which can return them to their proper time.
The humor is wierd and the characters ammusing. It reminds me alot of Ranma 1/2 in both of these aspects too, and I think any fan of Ranma should love this series as well.",994550400,,520,4.252525252525253
1222700,5,B00000ILBP,"This anime is incredibly funny and WILL BE COMING TO DVD SOON accord to the publisher.  Also there is a ""Those Who Hunt Elves 2"" and it will also be released on DVD.  Yes I mean they will be released here, as in the US.  Speaking for myself I can't wait.  If you want a series to pass the time try Martian Successor Nadesico.  Its funny and have a decent plot with good character development.",991785600,,392,4.173333333333333
1222701,5,B00000ILBP,"This is another of Go Nagai's just-for-fun wonders. Combininghis typical great storyline, better-than-usual (for him) animation,... , it holds true to form, but improves on other Go Nagai releases.
The basis of the plot, as with most Go Nagai work, is a little zany. All right, a LOT zany. In fact, the story seems to begin somewhere in the middle! The three heroes - a martial arts master, a Hollywood star, and a schoolgirl who can shoot a fly at 100 yards and ask as to which eye to hit - are stranded in the elf-world, a sort of counter-Earth where elves and magic rule. How our heroes arrived in the world with their Army tank (yep, Army tank, complete with Very Large Gun) and what they actually did to earn the gratitude of the population seems to be largely left out, although a glimpse here and there occurs from time to time. Actually, that might make yet another story, a prequel, if you wish.
Our heroes are stranded because the martial arts guy bothered an elf mage at the wrong moment in her spell casting and the spell - which was to transport our heroes back to our world - exploded into five parts and scattered all over the world, imprinting itself on the flesh of five female elves who must now be tracked down, ... , and the spell parts removed by the original caster. Of course, no one knows just WHICH female elves have the spell parts, hence the necessity of chasing, ... , and examining hoards of ... elves! (What a clever man Go Nagai is! ... .
In the process of doing so our heroes battle a hetrogenous bunch of baddies including fish-pirates and a cat-spirit that possess the tank! And good fun is had by all, except maybe the female elves!",971913600,,1667,4.4332247557003255
1222702,5,B00000ILBP,Those Who Hunt Elves is one of the best Fantasy animes out there.  As  you've read from other reviewers the characters in the show go around and  strip elves to find the piece of a spell fragment that got accidently put  on 5 other elves.  Although this does sound a little bit perverted no  nudity is really shown.  Parents should shy off showing their children the  first episode (not the first tape just the first episode on the first tape)  because it contains harsh language...but thats really the only problem for  children.  For anyone else its one of the best fantasy animes. Also they  have a tank in this series.  Yes a tank. It goes around well basically  blowing stuff up in a fantasy anime.  Which alone makes the series a  billion times better.  The tank is a T-74 and whats scary is that its drawn  correctly and works accurately to real tanks. It does not unseat Slayers as  the crown for the best fantasy anime but it comes very very close.,962323200,3,957,4.459302325581396
1222703,2,B00000ILBP,"""Those Who Hunt Elves"" is the perfect Japanese anime equivalent of an American sitcom -- while it's funny at times, most of the time it's just boring and disinteresting.
The premise itself is amusing, in a  sophomoric kind of way. The parts of a spell have been scattered and are  now on the bodies of elves across the planet.
You can see where this is  heading, right?
Hunt for elf, find elf, strip elf. Yep, that's about the  size of it. Sure, it seems as though there might be hope on the horizon,  but the premise itself, along with simplistic animation and  less-than-interesting stories give one little reason to dish out the cash  for the second tape when the first one was so lackluster.
Put simply,  ""Those Who Hunt Elves"" is for a specific kind of audience only.  Everyone else need not apply.",956620800,,803,4.559440559440559
7910744,5,B00000ILBP,"Well, tell you the truth I was very surprised. I bought the full series at once and WOW, I laughed so much it hurt. This is a great series. The first DVD starts off kinda slow, but after that it's just non-stop humour. You start developing a love for each character's personalities and quirkes. I'm sincerelly glad that I bought this series. It makes my anime collection all that much more complete.",1102032000,4,399,4.555555555555555
7910745,2,B00000ILBP,"I have to wonder if the reviewers that gave this DVD a good rating saw the same one I did. The animation is cheesy, the comedy is beyond lame, and the characters are downright annoying. The basic idea is great and it's a shame it was handled so poorly. The shows look like half the scenes were chopped out and what remained was cut to the bare bone. I'd have given it one star except that I reserve that rating for truly horrendous examples of defective wares foisted on an unsuspecting public. My advice? Spend your money elsewhere.",1097712000,6,533,4.448979591836735
7910746,4,B00000ILBP,"Okay, first off - if you're looking for anime that makes you think, stop here.  Go hunt down ""Gasaraki"" or ""Ghost in the Shell"".  This is just good, not-so-clean humour in the best Japanese fashion.  It's a little crude (Language and near-nudity), but it's all done in a good humoured fashion.  Almost suitable for the kids if they've heard the language.

All the other reviews mention the characters, but the tank iss probably the most amusing of them.  How many other people would have put the mind of a kitten in a Russian tank?

Watch it, enjoy yourself, but don't think it's going to change the way you think, unless you are way too serious for everyone's good.",1091750400,7,666,4.593220338983051
7910747,4,B00000ILBP,"One of the most humorous anime series I've come across yet!  The subtitle is a bit misleading, though, this is in now way one of those ""x"" rated anime series.  A 6-time martial arts champion, and oscar award winning Hollywood actriss, a tom-boy wepons expert and a T-74 tank are transported to a sword and sourcery world.  The head Elven priestess tries to preform a spell to send them back (the whole hellarious plot unwinds in the second episode), but something goes wrong, and the spell is quinsected, and imprinted on the skin of 5 unknown elves.  The only way the trio can get home to Japan is to scour the land, stripping every female elf to look for the 5 lost pieces of the spell.  As I said, this does not turn into an ""X"" rated feature, but much of the humor occurs in both the journey and the Elf stripping!  Increadably, the English language version turns out to be more crude than the original Japanese script.
Be sure to by both disks (only 12 episodes in the original): the funniest episodes are 7-9, and the entire plot is explained in the last two episodes.  I'm looking forward to Those Who Hunt Elves II!  A difinate buy for the anime fan (well written, but the animation is average to T.V. anime).",1061251200,5,1217,4.45045045045045
7910748,5,B00000ILBP,"Now, as there are already more than enough reviews, let me just add something.  This anime is very funny, with hints and suggestions of naughtly, kinky fun, but like 'The Benny Hill Show' you won't really SEE anything.  I would even suggest that older kids could watch it without a problem.
Frankly, a T-74 tank taken over by the spirit of a kitten seems very cute to me.  You have to watch the episodes to get it.  The good thing is the DVD holds 6 episodes!
This is one of a two DVD set that makes up the first series and 'Those Who Hunt Elves II' should become DVDs sooner or later.",1049068800,6,585,4.196428571428571
7910749,4,B00000ILBP,"I bought this set with no idea what to expect.  I have watched a little bit of Anime before, but I wasn't ever really impressed.  Needless to say, this one definitely got me hooked.  The story line is somewhat out of the ordinary...and the humor is great!  I totally love Junpei!  He is hilarious!!
The only reason this one got 4 stars instead of five is the opening song/music.  It is repeated throughout the DVD (particularly at the main title and at the beginning and end of every episode).  I fell asleep watching the DVD one day and woke up with that annoying little tune in my head all day.
...but other than the opening song, I would recommend this set to all my family and friends.  Sure, there is talk of stripping of elves, but there isn't any real nudity basically meaning you can't see anything you would see with clothes on.
Bottom line...get the set.  You won't be sorry.",1038355200,,885,4.447204968944099
7910750,3,B00000ILBP,"To tell you the truth, I enjoyed most of Those who hunt elves.  I was looking at the title, and wondered about it while I was shopping, and thought..elves?  okay, and gave it the benefit of the doubt.  It is a good start, but what it lacks, is a background information.  Which should have been in the beginning, not a retelling of what had transpired in episode 6.
Other than that, it is a fairly well done anime.  But it is more of a ponder and look through kinda anime.",1037059200,,471,4.188888888888889
7910751,5,B00000ILBP,"Let me start out by saying that I love watching my anime DVDs with other people. True, some of those people don't exactly jump up and down when I tell them that we get to watch my anime DVD collection. Two of those people are my younger sisters. To date, they each only like two anime series. Fushigi Yugi and Card Captor Sakura. Imagine my surprise when I bought the first DVD of Those Who Hunt Elves and watched it with my sisters...and they ENJOYED it. They want me to get the next DVD! Needless to say, I was in shock.
But I do recommend this series to anyone who loves humor. The title puts a lot of people off, but it isn't as risque as it seems.  Everyone that has watched this (either voluntarily or by having me duct tape them to a chair) has enjoyed it and fallen in love with it.
So, as they say, don't judge a book by its cover. Or, in this case, don't judge a DVD by its title! ^_^
Trust me on this, you'll love this series. If my two younger sisters could love this series, then definitely so could you. Miracles do happen, after all...",1029888000,9,1050,4.147058823529412
7910752,4,B00000ILBP,"Unlike Sorcerer Hunters where the humor plays around the edges of the plot, this one seems like the gags were dreamed up first. My almost 12-yr-old wanted this one for months before I bought it. There's a lot of familiar voice actors(ADV studio-Andrew Klimko/Sorcerer Hunters-Gateau) & Kelly Manison/S.H.-Big Mama, Martian Successor Nadesico-Haruka, Excel-Great Will of the Macroverse. Japanese actors Tomokazu Seki/M.S.Nadesico-Gai Daigoji, Card Captor Sakura-Toya, X-Kamui & Kotono Mitsushi/Sailor Moon-Usagi, Excel Saga-Excel, Blue Seed-Kome. They even got DBZ's Bulma-Hiromi Tsuru on ep 12) so the whole thing comes off pretty well. I found the plot a bit thin--or maybe just a poor excuse to strip characters' clothes off almost every ep, but I did laugh quite a bit.",1027123200,,772,5.5508474576271185
7910753,5,B00000ILBP,"I will start my review by fully admitting my bias toward elves, and more particularly, naked elves.  While there is not actual nudity in the series, naked elves are implied, and that's close enough for me!
This series is great.  When you watch it, you need to keep in mind that it's 1/2 comedy 1/2 ... other stuff.  Animation is decent, though I've seen better.
The characters are what really stands out about this series.  Each of them, even the insignificant characters you only see in one episode then never see again are all very detailed and have their own story and unique personality.
NOTICE (to people who plan to watch this on their Computer as opposed to a standalone DVD player): The interface is kind of flawed.  I tried running it with PowerDVD, and only got the opening FBI warning/adv intro.  When you switch it to file mode and play the files directly, you can only listen to the dubbed version (dub-overs suck bad in this anime).  I had to resort to InterActual player to get this to work.  I hate having to use InterActual because there's no volume control.
