7427046,5,B0152AW0DM,We love Mia and Me but it's so hard to find in English. And even harder to find at a descent price. This was a great price in English and came with a puzzle. This is a great buy.,1455062400,4,178,3.58974358974359
7427047,4,B0152AW0DM,"I bought this Mia and Me DVD at Toys R Us yesterday and it comes with a free bonus puzzle where it's shown double sealed over the front cover of the packaging. On this release, it has episodes 10 and 11 from the first season (The Blossom Tree, All That Glitters), but let's stop right here.

Episode 7~9 uncut is currently not available in any of the Region 1 DVDs of the Mia and Me franchise, and why PBS skipped those episodes for this release is beyond me. Let's just consider this is technically Season 1 Volume 4 of Mia and Me.
Speaking of Mia and Me DVDs, let's review the audio quality. Just like with the previous region 1 releases, the audio quality isn't as good as the PAL DVDs from France because of the echoing even on Stereo. Last time I checked, one of my Mia and Me DVDs from France had amazing audio quality when I'm watching the English version presented in Stereo or 5.1 surround with my daughters.",1454803200,10,917,4.3313953488372094
