8117467,2,B000F4RHLG,"I loved In the Shadow of the Moon and When We Left Earth, and Apollo 13 (both the movie and the documentary), so it's not the subject matter that's the problem for me, but it's like they just threw all the footage (most of it grainy, low-res footage at that) they had on this thing without any editing whatsoever. Literally every moment of the countdown, launch, spacewalk, etc. They could have cut out so much where nothing is happening and just kept the more exciting stuff. About as exciting as watching ice melt. It does come in a nice stamped metal box though. At least mine did.",1343779200,,584,4.4672897196261685

8117469,3,B000F4RHLG,"This product is basically NASA's post mission briefing video of the July 2005 STS-114 mission of Space Shuttle Discovery, broken up over three DVDs with some additional material inserted in the disks dealing with the Apollo-Soyuz Mission/The Hubble Telescope/and the International Space Station. If you understand this, then you will be fine with it, but I would not expect great things from this video collection.",1244505600,,414,5.384615384615385
8117470,5,B000F4RHLG,"The July 2005 mission of space shuttle Discovery was one of the most widely covered in NASA history. Only two years earlier, sister ship Columbia exploded during re-entry due to the loss of some insulating foam. Discovery, America's return to space following that tragedy, also lost insulation, this time during take-off, so a good deal of the crew's efforts were devoted to spacewalks for damage repairs. The scheduled delivery of supplies to the International Space Station was accomplished, as well. Discovery's successful return landing received much media coverage.
