8620526,3,B004JOBTSK,"This DVD is decent and I say decent because you only learn from it if you're an advanced guitar player to by which you'd probably already know how to perform most of these or not need them at all by that point. You can also see these lessons for free as well on youtube which is were I discovered them only after I had already purchased the DVD from a local music store. Mostly what you get is a guy playing the strings out for you then showing you what he's doing, then explaining the origins of the play style and then moving on to the next riff in the series. It's not something that's exactly a learning experience because it's not broken down enough. It might be helpful for those already quite familiar with the guitar to get some new playing ideas however.",1350604800,4,763,4.305555555555555
