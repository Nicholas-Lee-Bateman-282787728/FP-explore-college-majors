3526215,1,B001D68NAE,I fell asleep on this movie. I love Katt Williams. This movie was not good at all.,1234224000,2,82,3.8823529411764706
3526216,2,B001D68NAE,"it was low budget and very corny, but it had a couple of laughs here and there. Master P still doing the same ole same type of film that he has pretty much always done. another low budget film, but it's a bargin.",1232928000,,212,3.953488372093023
3526217,1,B001D68NAE,"Someone did a great job with the DVD Cover by marketing this ""movie"" as a product of funny-man Katt Williams.  However, the harsh reality is that this is a Master P production, so you know it's guaranteed to be a low-budget, B-rated movie at BEST - with bad script-writing, poor acting and weak directing.  On a somewhat brighter note, Master P's movie called ""Repos"" was tolerable and at least funny, starring many of the same actors in ""Internet Dating"".  Nevertheless, ""Internet Dating"" is perhaps his worse (if that's possible) film to date!

Considering Katt Williams and Clifton Powell accepted these pathetic roles, I doubt if any fans of these two will forgive them any time soon for ""ripping us off"" (of our valuable TIME and cash) with this Master P ""con-job"" portraying a comedy.  This ""mess-of-a-movie"" was actually beyond bad, so spending your TIME painting a neighbor's ceiling and watching it dry is a better choice instead of watching this one! Oh yeah, and if you haven't figured this out yet, spending MONEY on this one is DEFINITELY A NO-NO!!!",1232668800,,1062,4.877777777777778
3526218,1,B001D68NAE,"I can't even believe this crap is in stores. My homegirl rented it and it put me to sleep, and when I woke up, I didn't feel lost on the ""plot"" because the whole thing was just plain dumb. I was so mad she made me sit and watch the whole movie like it was gonna get any better.  I expected more out of Katt because I love his stand-up but this and It's Pimpin Pimpin are HUGE disappointments.",1232496000,2,392,3.962025316455696
3526219,1,B001D68NAE,"THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE, KATT WILLIAMS AND MASTER P ARE WRONG FOR MAKING THIS MOVIE.  IM A FAN OF LOW BUDGET MOVIE, BUT THIS MOVIE WAS JUST DUMB.  IT WAS NOT FUNNY AT ALL.  IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A FUNNY MOVIE ABOUT INTERNET DATING, LOOK FOR THE DVD CHAT ROOM, ITS WAY MORE FUNNIER THAN THIS MOVIE.",1231459200,3,294,4.12280701754386
3526220,1,B001D68NAE,"The worst movie I have seen in a long time. I am gonna give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe the cast and crew did not watch the movie before they released it. There is no way they watched it and thought or said ""this is gonna be a hit"". Keep searching and spend your money on another movie.",1231372800,,295,3.933333333333333
3526221,1,B001D68NAE,"Do not watch this movie under any circumstances, I like Kat Williams, but this may possibly be the worse movie ever made.",1231113600,,121,4.545454545454546
3526222,1,B001D68NAE,man this movie isn't worth even watching for free! i didn't even buy it but instead watched one of my homegirl's copy and was still upset. i agree with the first reviewer completely it is enough of these low budget movies with notable actors with bad script writing. come on master p at least foolish was a real movie with at least a desent plot. cmon katt this is really bad i mean he aint even that funny in here! the only thing good in the movie are those two bad brauds that work for master p and that chick that works at the sub store.,1231027200,,540,4.10377358490566
3526223,1,B001D68NAE,"This movie shows that as long as a check will cash, work will be done.
A cast of actors doing a low budget movie in 2008? Come on Master P I haven't seen this type of low quality filming since I'm bout it, bout it....and that was how many years ago? Master P did Eddie Griffen more justice than this. This film shows that some people with money making movies should seekout more than just the actors. Money to produce a decent cast but not enough creativity to make a good story. Written by Romeo Miller. Master P's son. Not knocking the effort but some tweaking on the script and more quality filming would've probably helped. If you're going to spend money making a movie, make people happy. Hopefully this movie will not hurt Katt Williams movie career. With a few funny moments and a few familiar faces this movie may be worth it for late,late night viewing with a few alcoholic beverages and maybe some hemp fans may enjoy the movie but other than that, stray away. If you're a big Katt Williams fan you may be disappointed. Truth be told I could've added flavor to this movie from the directors chair and up the sales to this movie. Rent before buying! Nuff said.",1230681600,7,1169,4.441860465116279
3526252,2,B001D68NAE,"This movie was so bad, no plot, What was Katt thinking when he did this one, stick to stand up comedy Katt",1364774400,,106,3.8636363636363638
3526253,1,B001D68NAE,"It'd be a huge waste of time to go into detail as to why this movie is terrible, but it is. Lousy acting, terrible story, and mindless premise. Save yourself the time that you would waste watching this...you'll lose more by watching it than actually paying for it.",1364601600,,264,4.520833333333333
3526254,2,B001D68NAE,"The plot of this movie did not make sense in the least, the acting was horrible, and the low budget showed in every possible way. However, I laughed out loud throughout the film, and often because of how bad the movie was. This IS a terrible film, but if you are a fan of movies that are so awful that they actually become funny, I think you might enjoy this one. I wouldn't  recommend purchasing it, though.",1347408000,,408,4.298701298701299
3526255,1,B001D68NAE,All that can be said about this money rent before buying my brother rented it before buying and it wasn't even worth the money paid to rent it if you like low budget money this is it. Money not worth buying if really wanting to see this one rent first then buy if still wanting to purchase. Not that you will want to!!!,1340150400,,319,4.079365079365079
3526256,3,B001D68NAE,One of those  camcorder type movies Cant Believe kat williams did  this movie does not comb his hair lol in movie,1272672000,,113,4.333333333333333
3526257,2,B001D68NAE,"I did not purchase this on Amazon so I cannot rate their shipping time. I was actually lucky enough to watch this ""film"" online so, I was not out of any money by purchasing or renting this ""film"". The cast of characters included Master P., Katt Williams and that old comedian named Red (he was very tacky and not funny in the least!). The ""film"" (mainly because I don't know what else to call it) was seriously low budget; it looked as if it was recorded with a camcorder in someone's basement with a budget of $50.00. It's about Katt Williams character who is working in Mr. B's (Red)sandwich shop and his desire to meet someone online. After he goes through several encounters, he finds ""love"" in the last place he thought he would. The ""film"" did have some funny parts, which is what made me decide to give it two stars. Overall, Katt Williams is a funny comedian and the ""film"" did provide me with a chuckle here and there. If you like Katt Williams or any of the other characters in the movie, and you have an hour and a half of time to waste, this could be the movie for you. As always... YMMV. NEOSOUL",1272240000,,1108,4.331730769230769
3526258,1,B001D68NAE,"Like so many comics before him, Katt Williams shows fantastic promise while on the stage, while showing little talent as an actor.  On top of this, the movie feels so low-budget that you feel as if you could potentially get your home video camera and make a film with a few friends that could be sold in stores nationwide.  Imagine how you would have felt about Clerks if you never laughed once.  That's Internet Dating.",1257811200,,420,4.573333333333333
3526259,5,B001D68NAE,"THIS PURCHASE WAS A GIFT, HOWEVER, THE RECEIVER WAS HIGHLY SATISFIED WITH THE CONDITION (AND CONTENT OF COURSE, LOL)  OF THE DVD.

THE TIMELINESS FOR RECEIPT OF THIS ORDER WAS EXCEPTIONAL, WHICH WAS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT WAS A BIRTHDAY GIFT.",1248998400,,245,4.951219512195122
3526260,2,B001D68NAE,Interner Dating was a very low budget movie. The  movie was confusing and it didn't flow correctly. His stand up's are way better. You will laugh not at the movie but the poor quality.,1235865600,,184,4.411764705882353
3526261,1,B001D68NAE,"This movie doesn't even deserve a star rating. Quite possible one of the worst films ever. There are a few chuckles here and there from Katt Willaims, but the movie is just plain bad. The audio is so bad you can hear the voices echo off the wall. At times you can see the crew walking around from the reflections on objects. The cast talks way too low, they talk over each other and they talk under thier breath way too much. Though the title and summary seems interesting, don't be fooled! It is just ridiculous how bad this movie is.",1235260800,4,535,4.306930693069307
