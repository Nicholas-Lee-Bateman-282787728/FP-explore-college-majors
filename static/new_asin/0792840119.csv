143368,4,0792840119,"Scream Factory keeps the forgotten hits of yesteryear coming with 1998s thriller Disturbing Behavior. The surprisingly effective film was directed by David Nutter (Game of Thrones, The X-Files) from a story by Scott Rosenberg (Con Air, Tales from the Crypt). Katie Holmes headlines the cast made up of James Marsden (X-Men, Enchanted), and Nick Stahl (Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, Sin City) at a time when she was in the spotlight thanks to the success of Dawsons Creek.

Steve Clark (James Marsden) is a newcomer in the town of Cradle Bay, and he quickly realizes that there's something odd about his high school classmates. The clique known as the ""Blue Ribbons"" are the eerie embodiment of academic excellence and clean living. But, like the rest of the town, they're a little too perfect. When Steve's rebellious friend Gavin (Nick Stahl) mysteriously joins their ranks, Steve searches for the truth with fellow misfit Rachel (Katie Holmes) in ""Disturbing Behavior.""

Katie Holmes takes on the role of rebellious Goth teen Rachel Wagner in ""Disturbing Behavior."" She was doing her best at the time to break free of her good-girl typecast in Dawsons Creek where she played near-perfect Joey. What that means is she grimaces a lot and dresses up in half-shirts and rocker boots.

Disturbing Behavior has all the tropes you could ever want in a genre film from the late 1990s. You get over-the-top performances and bad acting mixed with hints of tell-tale talent. A melodramatic electronic soundtrack is mixed well with an alternative rock soundtrack and clothing styles that defined the decade.

The lesson to be found in Disturbing Behavior is that you must fight for your identity and individuality. Dont run with the crowd just to be accepted. Theres a lot more social commentary here than what you would expect from a Hollywood teen flick.

The HD transfer for Disturbing Behavior is a bit dirty and grainy. The clarity doesnt help when green screen is used. The visual effect used to show the brainwashing really ages the movie as well. They're a sort of fractal imagery that would have looked advanced in a Pre-CGI world, but comes across as hokey today.

Bonus material for Disturbing Behaviors Blu-ray debut is rather sparse. We get deleted scenes and an alternate ending with optional commentary from Director David Nutter. A theatrical trailer is included as well. Im surprised they couldn't come up with at least a vintage special feature for the release.

The movie is rated R for strong violence, sexuality, language, and drug content. Theres nudity in a couple of parts and one definite scene suggesting something is going on out of frame. As usual, its really all needless and might have been the reason the movie wasn't as successful as it couldve been were it accessible to a PG-13 crowd.

Disturbing Behavior manages to provide some great thrills and chills. The best way to describe it is as a sort of teen slasher mixed with The Stepford Wives and A Clockwork Orange. The ending seems rushed and comes with some cheesy one-line and a tacked - on finale that would lead you to believe they're might be a sequel in the works. Unfortunately, the movie didn't make enough money at the box office to merit such a thing.",1460073600,,3243,4.894353369763206
143369,5,0792840119,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The acting is spot on, This has an awesome story and awesome, unforgettable characters and you Know it.
I rate this a 5* because it is 100% worthy.

It is a sinister movie and it is evil in a way,  so if you don't like that kind of thing, (and there is violence) then don't watch it, simple as that.

The main character nails his role and so does everyone including even the non characters the background characters. If the critics weren't so Idiotic and douche like, and judgmental, and losers, then there would have probably been a part 2.
The music score is,  well let's just say it has a score album. It's that good. I saw this movie and shared it with others and they all loved it and it's suspense. Dmmit they don't make movies like this anymore.

Cradle bay is the town it takes place in, and Nick Stahl is one of the actors,  he is spot on and his friend UV. which is albino. Beautiful movie with lot of twists and turns...

I can't see how any person could rate this as bad, they just have Horrible taste and have a miserable life. Either that or they were tormented in high school and this movie brings back memories.

143398,4,0792840119,"Steve Clark is your average high school senior, moving with his family from Chicago to Cradle Bay, a charming coastal town in Washington state's Puget Sound. It's nearly been a year since Steve's older brother, Allen, committed suicide which left his family completely traumatized. Steve's family hopes that moving to another state and town will give them a fresh start in their lives.

On his first day at the stereotypical school, he almost immediately befriends 3 outcast students at lunch; the rebellious Gavin Strick, drug addict U.V., and the quiet, soft-spoken, Rachel Wagner. Out of all the school's stereotypical cliques, the one Gavin warns Steve about is the Blue Ribbons; a group of smug, arrogant, jock-like students who supposedly rule the school, yet live by overbearingly clean and wholesome morals. Their ""goody goody two shoes"" activities include bake sales, car washes, and after school snacks at the Yogurt Shop. Gavin believes there's something eerily evil about the group but can't quite figure it out.

When Gavin shows up to school one day suddenly joining the Blue Ribbons without reason, Steve tries to intervene but he's mugged by Gavin and the rest of the Blue Ribbons in a beat down. With Gavin's sudden defection to the Blue Ribbons, Steve tags along with Rachel. Together they work together to discover the true source behind the mysterious Blue Ribbons and save the lives of everyone else in the school before this creepy, clean gang's influence rubs off anyone else

Overall: What can I say about Disturbing Behavior? It's become one of my favorite sci-fi thrillers that had potential, but lost its footing along the way. The first 30 minutes or so of the film starts off on the right track with an intense story of whodunnit? In a curious case to discover who or what is responsible for the mystical and perplexing clique that is the Blue Ribbons. Unfortunately after those 30 minutes are up, the movie seems to get rushed to the ending as they had no shame in quickening up the story telling to a slight twist of an end. The film's pace moves so fast, there's not enough time to truly process and digest any concern to the situation at hand. It's unfortunate really because like I said, I love Disturbing Behavior and it disappoints me that they didn't smooth things out and take their time with this. On to other things; I loved how this movie paints the high school jocks in a different light. How many movies since maybe the 80s has their been where the high school jocks were portrayed as smug, mealy mouth punks who bully others, drink alcohol, and have sex? Disturbing Behavior paints its own brand of the high school jock as smug, mealy mouth kids who occasionally bully others but carry clean, self-righteous characteristics. The soundtrack is off the charts! We get some nice tunes stuffed in there as well a mellow, blissful theme during the opening minutes of the film. The ladies get to witness James Marsden put up an admirable performance as the charming protagonist, Steve Clark; while guys get to witness a young decently cute Katie Holmes give an equally admirable performance as the quiet, goth, Rachel. Nick Stahl shows a substantial presentation as the rebellious misfit, Gavin. We get some blood here and there but it's nothing over the top. Just slight cuts. This movie has often been compared to The Faculty, which came out months after this with a similar plot--which I have also reviewed. The 2 really do have striking similarities. Overall, Disturbing Behavior is a favorite for me. I recommend getting the DVD mainly for the extras it has to offer as well as a good movie. I'd say this is worthy for movie night, just prepare to be disappointed at how fast it goes after the first 30-35 minutes.",1447027200,,3757,4.830745341614906

143401,4,0792840119,"When I think about when this movie first hit theaters I always remember a little funny scenario involving a few friends and I, it was late one night and we were leaving out of a restaurant or something, and we pasted a movie theater (now long closed down) that was playing the movie ""Disturbing Behavior."" As we passed by the theater one of my friends read aloud the movies playing at the theater, when getting to ""Disturbing Behavior"" saying the title he said ""I know some people suffering from that!"" To this day I always laugh to myself when I think about that. Anyway, I actually never saw
this movie on the big screen, rather when it first came out on DVD, and when I finally did see it, it didn't disappoint.

The story (and forgive me if I'm a little fuzzy on the details, as I literally haven't seen this movie in probably more than ten years) surrounds a family consisting of the standard Mother, Father, and kids - of which are teenagers played
by a pre X-men James Marsden and a pre Gingersnaps Katherine Issabelle.

The family moves to a new town and if memory severs me right (correct me if I'm wrong) I do believe there is a subplot involving an older brother to the teenagers that may have died under some mysterious circumstances.

No sooner than the family moves to a new town the protagonist (James Marsden) notices a strange perfectness to the teenagers in town. Along the way he tends to lean towards the outcast kids, one played by a pre T3 Nick Stahl, a pale-faced kid named ""U.V."" and of coarse what would a horror movie be without a hot chick, in this case played by a Katie Holmes.

As the movie moves along, Nick Stahl's character seems to be the only one that seems the be convinced that the town elders are experimenting on the teenagers, turning them into perfect obedient apt pupils.

The main reason this movie works isn't that it presents scenarios we haven't seen before, (we have seen this kind of thing before, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Stephard Wives) it's that it didn't try to be just another post Scream who's the killer kind of film. You have to take in the context and era in which in was released.

As in everything in Hollywood, if one unique movie comes along and is a hit (in this case Scream) rip it off! (I know what you did last summer, Urban Legend, Valentine) and like most ripoffs they pale in comparison to the original-enter
Disturbing Behavior.
This film right out the gate gets points for NOT going the ""who's the killer route"" and trying to be it's own thing, aside from that, it just delivers with good acting, sharp direction, adequate writing, and several memorable set pieces,
one memorable one you may remember involving a topless hot chick, James Marsden and a vanity mirror. IT'S GOOD STUFF!

It also manages to surprise you every now and then with certain plot-points, resulting in the viewer having that ""I didn't see that one coming,"" reaction. Even the haunting musical score delivers, not to mention the cue of getting veteran character actor William Sadler to play the creepy janitor, who may not be so creepy after all.

This is simply good film making, unfortunately, the movie, for some unknown reasons I don't understand, is all but extinct, as they never tend to show it on television, the DVD is pretty scarce (I've only come across it here lately on amazon) and I'm not sure how many VOD services carry it, as that is not my territory, hec, they didn't even make ONE sequel! That truly is rare, especially in regards to a teen\horror film. (They usually do a million sequels.)

I am keeping my fingers crossed that possibly in the next year or two scream factory will get their hands on it and breath much needed new life into it with a new S.E. DVD. True, scream factory usually sticks with the more obscure 70's and 80's films, but here lately they have been branching off into the 90's area, yet still having not cracked the mid-nineties, who's the killer era.
So, if you haven't seen this film check it out! You won't be disappointed!

P. S. If you're a diehard horror movie fan don't forget to checkout a teenage Katherine Issabelle playing Marsden's little sister. She looks about fourteen, or fifteen at the time, which I was the same age about the time this movie came out. I guess she was a budding scream queen from the beginning!",1436745600,,4326,4.555984555984556

I did find some on ebay somewhere used which I don't mind but they wanted $50 which is ridiculous and then some people have a brand new in the package for $100 is the same thing here with Amazon anything that's out of print in a brand new package is usually $99.99. But after waiting patiently I finally sound this that someone listed and I got it used for a decent price and it also happened with another movie called Shag from 1980's era about the 4 girls including Phoebe Cates going to Fort Sumpter/Myrtle Beach. on here and there were 7 available brand new in the package and they ran from $99.99 up to $150 I contacted the movie places they said it would not be reproduced again.

I know a lot of people didn't like it, but I wanted to try it.

143422,3,0792840119,"""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", which spawned three sequels, is a great formula for a movie, and can be fitted to a number of socio-political situations. Too bad these guys screwed up the formula.

Here's the scoop. Steve Clark (James Marsden) and his family are from Chicago. They move to Washington state to start a new life after Steve's brother committed suicide. Once there, Steve is befriended by Gavin Strick (Nick Stahl) who proceeds to give him the lay of the land as far as the high school is concerned. His big concern is that the more independent kids in the school are being turned into ""good"" kids by some procedure unknown. Of course Steve thinks he's paranoid but evidence begins to add up showing that Gavin might be right on.

Where to begin. In the ""invasion"" movies and ""John Carpenter's the Thing"" the situations start out vague and the pieces begin to come together and form a whole. Then everybody signs on and works out a strategy to deal with it. Here, the viewer sees, in the opening scene, what's going on. So how is the paranoia machine supposed to ramp up? This is a fundamental screw-up in the script. So this then comes more down to details on how the kids are being turned. Who's doing it, and what are our heroes going to do about it. And what are they trying to say? Turn all kids good? Or, as the final scene suggests, is it an indictment on our trying to standardize learning throughout the U.S.? Then there's Nick Stahl's character Gavin. Yes, I guess he's a clever chap but his patter is a bit too clever. I liked it at first but it wore thin really quick. And what about Katie Holmes' character Rachel? She's not a troublemaker like the other targets but she's definitely left of center. They just didn't draw her very well and they didn't give her and Steve enough time to build up the sizzle. A big surprise was the William Sadler character Dorian. He was better than he had to be for this role.

There are some good scenes here which kept me in the game. But the overall stupidity dragged the whole thing down.",1380844800,,2054,4.4866310160427805

It emerghes that the town of Cradle Bay has a psychiatric hospital whose chief psychiatrist, Dr Edgar Caldicott (Bruce Greenwood) is now the school councillor at Cradle Bay High School. With drugs and hypnosis he now has many of the pupils and staff under his control in the pursuit of evil. Among the last to succumb are Gavin Strick (Nick Stahl) and school newcomer from Chicago Steven Clark (James Marsden).

But before he could try to stop the evil doctor, Nick gets caught by the blue ribbons and placed under mind control, but not before he warns Mardsen of the danger. Marsden teams up with love interest Holmes to stop Dr. Caldicott before it's too late.

What would have made it better is if they had taken the alternate ending, and allowed you to view that ending in the movie instead along with the other cut features that actually in some places would have made the movie make a lot more sense.

The local high school is populated by picture perfect teens who, despite their wholesome love of yogurt, tend to get a little trigger happy when the hormones start flying. When the new kid in town (Jason Marsden) stumbles upon a dark secret, it's up to him and a few other mistfits (Nick Stahl, Katie Holmes) to shut down the powers that be.

There's loads of potential in this film that is, unfortunately, never capitalized upon. You can thank the editing department for that one. If the deleted scenes are any evidence, this movie was trimmed and dumbed down to the point of no recognition. While the uninterrupted flow makes for an easy, breezy viewing, the overall story lacks substance and coherence. Its 84 minute running time, in turn, is a redeeming feature.

The director, David Nutter, spends much of the film building up ample amounts of atmosphere and is aided wonderfully by a brilliant score by fellow ""X-Files"" alumnus Mark Snow as well as some striking scenery thanks to it's Vancouver location. So, the film isn't a complete waste. You'll get some kicks out of the dialog and while Katie Holmes in particular isn't given much to do, she at least looks good in skimpy outfits while doing so. Also, it's hard to hate on a movie that is of a more intelligent cut than the other teen-geared fare being produced in its time. The movie at least aims high, and even when it doesn't quite reach, it never bores.

Far from it really (unless a psychotic kid with a magical power to toss all his classmates around a supermarket or lunch room in a fit of unexplainable rage qualifies as disturbing? Nah, it's just silly).

This is just another in a long line of late 90's low budget thrillers that tries to make itself look better than it really is. By that I mean, the writing, the acting skills by all the actors involved, and most importantly the storytelling is NOWHERE near as good as the film writers and producers tried making us believe. It's honestly not. That makes Disturbing Behavior a pretty overrated film that didn't age very well.

Honestly, back in the late 90's when Hollywood movies went through another change, I was certain a movie like this would age amazingly well, but now -12 years later- I have to wonder if a film such as Disturbing Behavior is really any better than any of those cheesy 80's horror/suspense flicks we all used to make fun of. I don't really think it is any better to be honest.

Because of that editing, ""Disturbing Behavior"" was cut down to about an hour and 20 minutes and the original ending was changed. When I saw the movie on VHS, I was so disappointed that a lot of important elements from the book were gone. I bought the DVD because it includes 11 deleted scenes and the original ending. Nutter said he tried to release a director's cut version but was shut down by the studio before he could finish it. I still love watching the film with the deleted scenes.

As he starts school, Steve finds the usual cliques, the strangest being a group called ""the Blue Ribbons;"" they're the handsomest jocks and most beautiful co-eds and seem perfect but have a bad habit of beating people up - and getting away with it.  Steve is befriended by a stoner (Nick Stahl) and a punk girl (Katie Holmes) who share his suspicions about the Blue Ribbons.  Can they solve the mystery - in time?!

First of all, James Marsden is way too good-looking, charming, and old to play the outsider teen.  He's extremely likeable and sincere, however, and was the only reason I kept watching to the end, hoping this confusing mess would make sense.  I guess it did have a plot, but it was so poorly written that it's pretty laughable.  There was nothing in the story that seemed believeable.  The teen and adult characters were all stereotypes, the Marsden and Holmes characters suddenly became brilliant detectives and figured out an evil plan to turn the student body into Stepford Teens, and zombies, it seems, are really dumb and apparently no one will notice if they all disappear.

143452,4,0792840119,"Disturbing Behavior is essentially an American adaptation of the classic A Clockwork Orange.  Where juvenile delinquints were targeted before, now it's every kid who doesn't exude the perfect behavior.

The movie begins with a teenage couple making out at an overlooking bluff.  When the girl gets a little too frisky, the young man tells her that he ""needs his fluids"".  When she doesn't follow his suggestion, his eyes glow slightly, and then he snaps her neck.  To make matters worse, the local police happen upon the scene, and at least one of the cops is complicit.  Unfortunately for them, this is all seen by a local kid named Gavin (Nick Stahl), who has an inexplicably verbose vocabulary for a high school student.

Meanwhile, the perfect WASP family is moving into quiet Cradle Bay, a community where the most happening place is a Yogurt Shoppe, and the most exciting news is usually related to a bake sale somewhere.  Steve (James Marsden) is the clean-cut, go-getter, and like the rest of his family, he is recently mourning the loss of his older brother.  At his new school, however, he'll soon be mourning the fact that the social divide is far beyond most high schools; it's the ""Greasers"" versus the ""Soc'ias"", but to the Nth degree.  In the new school, as explained by Gavin and an albino friend nicknamed UV, it's ""Motorheads"", ""Microgeeks"", ""Skaters"", and ""Blue Ribbons"", a group of school do-gooders, who are just a little too perfect, a little too 1950s.

Steve soon sees Rachel (Katie Holmes), a beautiful outcast who ridiculously insists on using the word ""razor"" as a slang term.  Katie Holmes may have never been better looking in a movie.  Soon enough he's distracted, however, by one of the Blue Ribbon kids going berzerk and beating two other high school kids, even ripping out a nose-ring, because his attraction to Rachel was too much to handle.  It seems that when Blue Ribbons have emotional or sexual attraction they're not quite up to Blue Ribbon standards.

Within two days, Steve notices that one of the rougher students, who recently got in a fight with one of the Blue Ribbons, has suddenly become a straight-laced Blue Ribbon.  It's just a bit too odd for Steve, or anyone else's tastes.  He hears about Gavin's theory that the kids at school are being brainwashed and/or lobotomized by the school therapist Dr. Caldicott, and he meets Mr. Newberry, an insane janitor at the school.

To prove his theories, Gavin sneaks into school with Steve one evening, and learns that Gavin's parents are planning on enrolling him into one of the weekend retreats that has helped, maybe even created, the rest of the Blue Ribbons.  What happens next shocks everyone.

As a result, Steve and Rachel realize they must fight the rest of the school, the growing school conspiracy, the Blue Ribbons, and what seems like the entire town in order to find out what has been happening.  It's a race to not only save themselves, but also friends and family who may be affected.

143464,5,0792840119,"High School! Yay! If you're like me, you loathe the very mention of ""High School"". The principal in charge of my school ran the place like a prison. No pop machines. No soft drinks or candy allowed. Need to use the bathroom? Tough. Go when you're walking to your next class. I won't even get into the fact that when I turned eighteen at the beginning of my last year I could legally smoke cigarettes yet for some reason wasn't allowed to even OUTSIDE of the building without receiving some sort of punishment. Of course, after the warden moved on a few years later, the kids there had pop machines, candy machines, and could leave for lunch whenever they felt like it. I'm not bitter about it, really. It's so far in the past that I laugh about my experiences there whenever anyone mentions high school. Which, fortunately, isn't often. My encounters with high school these days largely come to me through movies. It looks like kids today have to go through the same crud I endured years ago. I feel for them. My advice to these poor souls: gut it out. Life gets much, much better in a few years.

None of this nonsense has much to do about anything except to serve as a rather lame introduction to my review of David Nutter's 1998 film ""Disturbing Behavior"". The movie introduces us to Steve Clark (James Marsden), a young man moving into the small town of Cradle Bay and trying to navigate his way through the social hell that is high school. He quickly meets up with two important characters: Gavin Strick (Nick Stahl) and Rachel Wagner (Katie Holmes). These two kids definitely look the part of outsiders. Strick mumbles a lot and has that old soul look, and Wagner dresses in black and sulks all over the place. Still, the two provide our hero with plenty of information about the various goings on in Cradle Bay High School. In one scene early on in the movie, Strick sits with Clark in the cafeteria and provides a quick run down of the various social cliques. The stoners, car lovers, nerds...you get the idea, except he has different names for them. Gavin makes sure to point out one group in particular, a collection of neatly groomed youngsters he calls ""Blue Ribbons"". They're the upright, popular kids who also excel in school.

But something is horribly, terribly wrong with the members of the Blue Ribbon gang. Let's call them a cult, actually. As Steve Clark soon learns, the town fell under the sway of one Dr. Edgar Endicott (Bruce Greenwood). He developed a plan, a behavior modification plan, that promises to transform troubled kids into straight arrows. Sounds great, doesn't it? Most of the parents in Cradle Bay think so. The Blue Ribbon cult keeps getting bigger and bigger as more kids fall into the orbit of Endicott's program. There's just one LITTLE problem with the new in crowd. The members have a tendency to erupt into cyclones of violence at the drop of the hat, usually when something excites those darn teenage hormones. Witness the carnage that takes place in a supermarket in one scene, and I think you'll agree that something isn't right here. Clark launches an investigation, spurred on by Gavin's sudden conversion into a Blue Ribboner, and what he finds isn't pretty. Endicott, with the help of Officer Cox (Steve Railsback), is performing bizarre experiments in the field of neurology. I think it's safe to say that brain surgery, behavior modification, and raging hormones lead to one heck of a conclusion.

""Disturbing Behavior"" is a lot of fun. The movie achieves heights of ridiculousness, especially during the grand finale, but that didn't stop me from grabbing on to this sucker's horns and riding it until the gruesome end. Let's run over the positives real quick. One, Katie Holmes. She's smoking hot in this film. I've always had a soft spot in my heart for her, but she attains heights of foxiness here I never imagined. Simply gorgeous. It's painful to think she's glued to Mr. Xenu in real life. Two, Nick Stahl is a really good actor. He can take something as goofy as ""Disturbing Behavior"" and sell it to the audience. Third, what's up with Hollywood and janitors? Between the guy in ""The Breakfast Club"" and the janitor here that lends a helping hand to Steve and his buddies, Dorien Newberry (William Sadler), it's obvious Tinseltown has a love affair with those pursuing a career in the custodial arts (a nod to Bender there). Four, and finally, it's nice to see Ethan Embry and Katharine Isabelle in small supporting roles. Now let's peruse the negatives. There aren't any, really, unless you count the film's short runtime. ""Disturbing Behavior"" clocks in at a paltry eighty-four minutes, including credits. Ouch!

The ""Disturbing Behavior"" DVD contains mucho supplements. We get a music video from The Flys, a commentary track featuring director David Nutter, an alternate ending, and eleven deleted scenes. That's a lot of deleted scenes! They should've just plugged them back into the movie to up the runtime. Anyway, I enjoyed this movie immensely. I remember when it came out back in the late 1990s, and I remember it tanking fast, so I put off seeing it until now thinking that it must have really stunk. The returns were so low that David Nutter has done nothing but television work since the film came out. Well, the critics and theater audiences were wrong; it's a great, entertaining horror flick filled with violence and heavy-handed messages about social conformity. In other words, it's high school with Katie Holmes. By the way, did I mention Katie Holmes is smoking hot? Good. I give this movie five stars. I give Katie ten stars.

143468,5,0792840119,"Most people in these reviews(and everywhere else) bash this film on a level that should be reserved for the Hulk. They either fail to take into account or choose to ignore the fact that it is a rags to riches film in terms of coming from the shallowest, campiest and most cliched of genres(teen movies) to some of the best social commentary and overall psychological creepiness around. First off, the acting, for the lines, is great. Whatever bs the reviewers feed you, they did great with their lines, and this movie still lists on my top ten good bad movies of all time, if not #1.

The Bad Points:

cut a lot of stuff that added depth to the story, though some of it did hurt pacing a lot.

characters needed to be more fleshed out. This is the most common complaint, though it isn't really fair, since almost all movies except super duper high budget ones suffer from things like this, due to time limitations and such from their tight budget.

Campy as all hell, and i loved it. If you don't like campy movies, fine, but don't go in expecting a teen movie to be shakespeare and i won't cut off your breeding rights for the sake of humanity.

Over the top and cliched. The most valid complaint there is. It's really again a question of two things they didn't have: budget/filming time. If they had the budget of even a third of a LotR movie maybe this would have been movie of the year, instead of a campy teen flick. or maybe not. But anyways, it's like being given a broken erector set and doing the best with what you have.

And now the good:

soundtrack: awesome as hell, if you're into rock music at all. If not, the previews should have cued you in. Also totally appropriate to the scenes it plays in, outlining the already painful teen angst and whatnot. Also, the opening music is the most wondrous and at the same time creepy music i have heard and seen, when combined with the visuals of implanting an optic chip.

Social Commentary: stepford wives clone this is not, so please stfu and die. Yes, many of the same ideas, but in a much different direction, different audience, and im sure even that was far from the first in its genre, just the first people remember. It deals with the twisted ins and outs of high school cliques(and much later society, since practically every social power group tries to lord it over everyone else), and the parents obsession with MAKING their children perfect. And how it backfires on them. This really brings parallels to the sad, pathetic war on video games to divert attention from parental responsibility that is going on now.

Atmosphere: like all great horror flicks, whether awesome campy b movies like this one and say, in the mouth of madness, or grade a ones like event horizon, this movie consistently delivers several types of deliciously awesome atmosphere that just seeps into your pores. First off, there is the atmosphere of the outsider, which is what everyone except the shiny happy people have to live through in high school, dealing with being a social(and often literal) punching bag for the high school elite.

Then there is the creepiness, its like one of those great zombie or alien movies, invasion of the body snatchers maybe, when you never know if someone is going to become one until its too late.

Also is the underlying pain of change and such that teenagedom essentially IS, which is underscored by steve's brother, and by his moving to a new hope(cradle bay) only to find that it festers with more psychological rot than the one he left by a wide margin.

Writing: campy but good. Part Army of Darkness, especially in its funny moments, part dawson's creek, and part manchurian candidate, or something, its a great mix of all the manic moments you encounter in those years, from the disturbingly tragic to the funny as hell, but all with pain as the bedrock.

Characters: Awesome. For how cliched and stereotyped this movie can be if you look at it in a high acting style, they work amazingly well in this movie. The director talks about how they all hung out and bonded off screen onset, and i think it really shows in the chemistry they exude in many of the lines. Katie holmes is by far the best, though almost everyone does great here in their stereotypical roles, but especially the major supporting characters are also awesome, as is the main character.

Overall: this movie impacted me so greatly i became obsessive when i first saw it, though admittedly i was a confused teen at the time. My friend has often said that this and another of my favorites, Dark City, are two sides of the same social commentary, dark city being serious, and disturbing behavior being satire. I would say now, that disturbing behavior is that most disturbing of psychopaths, the satirically serious, much like the demon in fallen who sings rolling stones songs all the time. It is a great movie if you like fun, intense, thought provoking, campy or creepy movies like John Carpenter's older stuff, Dark City, Event Horizon, Manchurian Candidate, Cabin Fever, Phantoms, Army of Darkness, etc...",1133568000,7,5062,4.653975363941769

The movie has an X-Files touch to it since it was directed by David Nutter (a director for the show). Too bad Mulder and Scully didn't come down to teach these kids a lesson.

If you haven't seen this movie yet, see it on DVD; the deleted scenes are essential for all the apparent plot holes, for characterization, and for basic explanation. As far as I can tell, someone --probably the same someone who decided to cut and paste Flagpole Sita to suit their nonsensical whims-- went through with a pair of scissors and cut these scenes out, because they aren't just fun extras, they're important. Admittedly, the final confrontation is still a bit cheesy, even with the additional footage, but overall the movie is well worth watching. On DVD.",1029974400,2,797,4.867647058823529

The story begins late one night when true GenXer Gavin, played for reasons unknown by the brilliant young actor Nick Stahl, witnesses a bizarre double murder. The next time we see him is at school, where he seems a bit paranoid but has told no one what he has witnessed. We assume there must be some good reason why he has remained silent, but as the movie goes one, we discover that the script doesn't supply one. In fact, it provides few reasons why anything happens.
James Marsden, an actor who should either pick better parts or return to TV, plays Jimmy, whose family moves to a lush island off the coast of Washington after his brother commits suicide. Why? Who knows? Off he goes to the local school where something or someone is turning troubled, rebellious students into picture perfect middle American kids. Naturally, as in all mad scientist movie stories, they are not perfect at all.
Jimmy meets Rachel, the girl whose destined to become his prerequisite babe. Kate Holmes has a tough time with this role. Anyone would, because Rachel's personality switches towards the end of the movie. This is due to the dreadfully written script, not to science gone mad...
It is possible that, if Disturbing Behavior had been satire of today's fears and preoccupation, it may have been a lot better. A magic potion for turning our kids into a group sharing the same uptight values would appeal to the growing ultra right wing segment of the adult population. It would be a typically simplistic answer to a complex issue. We are bombarded with so many messages to save our kids that I wonder if the real fear is that we can't save ourselves from our kids.",1017187200,2,1819,4.7413249211356465

None of the performances stick out really, maybe except Nick Stahl's as the very literate over-paranoid Gavin who gives the audience a surprise at the end. The direction shines only in the scene of the psychiatric hospital, and the script is muddled with what its trying to achieve.

143514,4,0792840119,"DISTURBING BEHAVIOR by itself was a decent, slighly above average film that was marketed as teen horror, when it really is fueled by the same kind of paranoia that director David Nutter worked with on ""The X-File's"". Seeing it in the theatres, I was surprised by how little it relied on scares, and instead was a more plot-driven quirky sci-fi film. The big problem, however, was the lack of development for many of the character's (particularly William Sadler as the ""more-than-who-he-seems"" janitor). Therefore, the film was fun and original, but also nonsenical and abrupt. Well, thank god for DVD. DISTURBING BEHAVIOR ranks right with BRAZIL in my opinion as a film the studio did the best they could to commercialize and destroy it (in BRAZIL's case the director won). On DVD, eleven deleted scenes, all with optional commentary by David Nutter can be viewed, and every single one of them adds a great deal to the film. While the great tragedy of the package is that you can't view the film with all this footage added, watching each cut scene seperately reveals a great amount of debt that this film (originally) had. The best of these scenes is definitely an extended meeting between Sadler's janitor and the James Marsden character. In the film itself, this brief meeting shows that the janitor might be more than he seems, but is so brief as to be completely confusing. With the added footage, Sadler brings great poignancy to his character, gives some extremely valuable information on the beginning of the changes in the town, and delivers the (would be) film's best line: ""This town sucks for heroes; you looking to be the first?"" It's a tragedy that this scene was cut, and you can practically hear David Nutter weep over losing each one of these scenes. The alternate, much darker ending on the boat completely changes the tone of the film and adds a great sadness in its scope, which in my opinion could have gave the film the potential to at least be a solid piece of work, rather than a so-so hackjob.  Anyone truly interested in film and its development should consider this film essential (regardless of whether you actually like DISTURING BEHAVIOR or not). An example of how studios can ruin movies, watching this alongside the criterion DVD of BRAZIL shows the difference between what happens when the director wins, and what happens when the studio does. DISTURBING BEHAVIOR could have been, at the least, a good film, but it instead a curiosity. I only wish that one day they re-release this film WITH the added scenes (directors cut anyone?), because I have a feeling that we might have a cult favorite on our hands.",980121600,6,2640,4.802197802197802
143515,3,0792840119,"First of all let me say, this flick has one heck of a great soundtrack.  I'm not slighting that in any way.  A couple things though...
For one thing, I have a few issues with the scene where James Marsden is introduced to the cliques at Cradle Bay, by Nick Stahl.  Nick is terrific, don't get me wrong, but I just thought that the scene played up James Marsden's whole ""outsider"" thing a little too much.  Sure, there are dramatic reasons why that should be done, but does the director seriously expect us to swallow that James Marsden comes from somewhere where cliques like that don't exist?!!?  They're everywhere!  Face it.  They'll never go away.
My other problem was just that, well, it seems too bad to make such a big deal out of ""high school"" as an experience, in some ways.  It's dramatic enough when you're in the middle of it -- sometimes I wonder if movies like this do more harm than good.  When you're that age, you're probably better off trying to look beyond it, to your twenties, when whatever problems you might have, at least you have some choices about what you do everyday. Just a thought.
Beyond that, it's a fun movie.  It makes real statements -- not incredibly original ones, but real statements.  I can respect that.  Still, whoever reads this, please think about what I said above.  Just my two cents worth.",971222400,,1335,4.535564853556485

143517,3,0792840119,"DISTURBING BEHAVIOR got lost in the shuffle of teen horror movies and failed at the box office, but this one is actually very different from I  KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, URBAN LEGEND, and other entries into the  genre.  BEHAVIOR has more of a sci-fi than a horror edge, which is not  surprising because it was made by writers and directors of several  ""The X-Files"" episodes.  The teens in the movie have been  scientifically reprogrammed to be on their best behavior.  Of course, these  same teens occasionally snap and go on homicidal rampages...but nobody's  perfect, right?  However, the behavior I found to be most disturbing was  that of the people at MGM, who significantly trimmed down the movie in  spite of what was obviously David Nutter's intent.  Luckily these scenes  have been added on the DVD, which provide a lot of back story and  motivation for character's actions that is missing from the final film.  Apparently MGM thought that teens were too dumb and restless to sit through  actual characterization and cut out quite a bit of this.  But the film  suffers quite a bit from these missing scenes (except for an alternate  ending that was wisely replaced by the one in the film).  You can almost  hear Nutter weeping over each one in his commentary on those deleted  scenes.  The doctor played by Bruce Greenwood has a scene at a meeting  describing his daughter's success with his program (which it later turns  out is a bit exaggerated).  This certainly adds depth to a character who is  otherwise just An Evil Doctor with no real reason to perform experiments on  kids (another scene also reveals these motivations).  A tense little scene  between Steve and the police is also cut that explained a lot about the  town's secrecy, and an explanation of Steve's brother's suicide is also  cut.  (The story was a bit too Romeo and Juliet for my taste and seemed  quite out of place, but at least it explains what everybody is so upset  about throughout the film.)  And a scene between Steve and his father and  another where Steve's mom finds the gun should also have been left in the  final cut, which humanizes the parents and gives them reason for enlisting  Steve in the program.  The film as it is has no explanation for why the  characters do what they do: why do Steve's parents sign him up for the  program?  Why does Caldicott do what he does?  Why do the police cover up  for him?  There are a lot of actions in this movie that don't make sense  without some sort of back story.  That being said, there are a couple of  entertaining sequences, including a trip to Caldicott's former place of  employment (it really doesn't serve any purpose to the plot but is worth it  to see Caldicott's daughter screaming ""Meet the musical people who  hide among the flowers!"") and the seduction by Lorna, who, upon coming  on to Steve and then attacking him with a piece of glass, jumps up and  states that she has to go home for a ""big physics tests.""  I wish  MGM or David Nutter had at least included a bit of an explanation as to why  the kids go psycho or a bit more depth to it (the best scene depicting this  is Lorna's ""bad, wrong wrong, bad"").  A study of how teenagers  often struggle with being ""good"" and their natural desire to be  ""bad"" could have been interesting, but here it is no more than an  afterthought.  With a little extra work, DISTURBING BEHAVIOR could have  been one of the better teen movies, but as it is is only so-so.

The review...  this tries treading Stepford Wives/Lottery ground by being a chilling  picture of conformity & savagery.  It attempts to be scary, but seems  to rely a lot on this camera trick where eyes glow neon red.  It reminds me  of a sports drink commercial.  So if this kind of thing scares you, then  this also might.
Characters are badly written.  The janitor's supposed to  be a genius feigning retardation in order to study people closely, but he  seems to be inserted into the movie like a fish into a sandbox...you don't  rightly understand why he's there, but someone put him there for a reason.  Basically, he makes 'plot' advance & it's his only reason for being in  film.
Katie Holmes may not be the greatest thespian, but I couldn't rid  myself of the idea that all her 'bad girl 'tude' had more to do with a  contempt for herself for appearing in this film.  Really.  Contempt seemed  to ooze out of my tv screen and I almost got up to wipe it got so bad.  She  was either working so hard on getting this 'emotional tone' right or  betrayed that she, like the rest of us, had a cable bill to pay and this  lousy job would cover it.
The box cover betrays that this movie is  basically a series of situations that attractive people get into.  If  you're shopping for narrative, shop elsewhere.  If you want situations for  the sake of situations and shot without a lot of regard to logic, then  watch this movie.
Audio of poor quality and made dialogue hard to hear,  but considering the quality of what I DID hear, I didn't bother  rewinding.
Oh, someone quotes a Pink Floyd song in an odd moment &  this is good because it is unintentionally funny.
James Marsden's &  Katie Holmes' character don't seem to have much reason for falling in love  or whatever beyond the fact that they both have good cheekbones.

One of the main reasons that people are so  critical of this film seems to be that they think it is horror, or trying  to be of that genre. I would disagree, and suggest that it is simply an  attempt at a suspense film, and as a suspense film, it fared OK. I was not  really surprised at any point during the film, but some girls that I saw it  with were, proving that it is effective to those who don't follow the  genre.
Some positive aspects of the film were its scripting originality,  ending, cast, and from memory, sountrack. The ending is one everyone has  seen before, and will probably see again, but fairly well done, the  suspense scenes are fairly well constructed, although failing to really  deliver, and the cast, while mainly good for star attraction, managed their  roles fairly well.
Overall, this is a fairly good film, with nothing  really wrong, but there is no one aspect that makes it stand out above the  rest. For this reason, I rate it just above average.",962150400,3,1225,4.434977578475336

He directed some X-Files episodes, and you can see it. Everything  is very X-Files like.  When you watch the film it's like seeing a tv-movie  not a like a movie for screen. Most annoying is the score by Mark Snow,  there are very few moments in the movie without music and that annoys. Mark  Snows music for X-Files was great, his score for Disturbing Behavior is  aweful. The movie isn't very scary at all, the only scene that was scary is  the one when James Marsden and Katie Holmes are in the psychatry. Also the  performance of the actors, especially Nick Stahl, who was terrible, wasn't  very good. The only thing I really liked about this flick was this song by  the Flys called ""Got you where I want you, a great song. Rent it but  don't buy it! When you want to watch a great movie with Katie Holmes, then  watch ""Go"" or ""Teaching Mrs. Tingle"", or better watch  both.",956275200,,1028,4.375661375661376
143538,4,0792840119,I thought that this was a good movie that relied more on suspense than on gore- even though there was some of that to in the film.  I always wondered what made teenagers act the way they do and now I know- they have a mind  control chip planted in their eyes!  This film was an entertaining joyride  with a surprise ending.  I would have given this movie only 3 stars but  Katie Holmes' performance added another star.  I recommended this movie for  anyone who wants to see what can happen when good kids go bad.,954892800,,512,4.260416666666667
143539,3,0792840119,"...of what can happen when a movie is created in a studio conference room.  The sheer idiocy of what MGM did to director David Nutter's ""Disturbing Behavior"" is paralleled only by Miramax's hack job on  ""54"".  Good job, guys.  We really didn't need to know anything  about Steve's (James Marsden) brother's suicide did we?  Sure, it would  have given the film a whole new dimension, and would have made Steve's bond  with Gavin (Nick Stahl) maybe mean just a little bit more within the  context of the story. But, out it goes. And, hey, who needs that whole love  scene with Rachel (Katie Holmes), anyway?  We've already gotten the idea  that these two dig each other - let's get on with the show! And wait just a  gosh darned minute - do we really need anymore background on an important,  pivotal character like Newberry (William Sadler)who gives his life to save  the kids toward the end?  Nah!  And the ending - wouldn't it be so much  more profound to have Gavin just kind of show up in some inner-city  classroom with chip in his eye than for him to have the powerful final  confrontation with Steve on the ferry?  Absolutely! MGM screwed up royally  with the final cut of this film but, through the miracle of DVD, audiences  can now be treated to all of the above-mentioned deleted scenes (and  several more that are so riveting you wonder why in the heck...) plus a  fascinating audio commentary by David Nutter that gives us a new  appreciation for this flawed but intriguing little film.

Even though I work in a movie theater and had the advantage of seeing it for free, I was disturbed and disappointed by this  so-called horror film. Despite the fact that the acting was good, and it  starred the very easy-on-the-eyes Katie Holmes, I thought this 80-minute  opus left a lot to be desired. There were a few parts where I wondered what  was going to happen, but I think the filmmakers could have done a lot more  with the intriguing story line.

Disturbing Behavior is a sort of Clockwork Orange-y movie about a group of kids in high school that are nothing less than perfect. It's kind  of dull, and you never really find out why they're doing this to these  kids, but the colors in the movie are bright as hell and should grab your  attention. It's less than an hour and a half long so it shouldn't be too  hard to get through if you're totally not enjoying it. Katie Holmes was a  very VERY nice touch; that dance she does in the truck just makes you say,  ""Hey."" Not exactly the worse of the teen horror flick craze, but  it's definetely not the best.

 A really cool, atmospheric, unique movie that epitomises the sheer stupidity of the studio system.  These freaks thought they knew best, what the teen audience would want and in the process deprived them of a really promising film.
 Katie Holmes is, without a doubt the most beautiful, talented young actress working in film today.  She simply shone from the moment she emerged from that truck.  Nick Stahl and James Marsden both put in exceptional work too.  What was with Ethan Embry though?  The tiny snippets we got to see of him were electrifying, I wanted to know more!!!
 The atmosphere was intense, brilliantly shot by X-files dude David Nutter.  Gawwwddd, watching the studio cut makes me ill.  They trimmed it beyond belief.  Most teen movies are 1 hour, 40 nowadays, they could have left at least fifteen minutes of the deleted, yet totally important scenes in.  They filled in so many gaps, character motivations, histories.  I for one, wanted to know exactly how much pain Steve's brother was in, talk about vague.  Even with the extra stuff, there still wasn't enough Katie, her character needed more time on screen, we didn't get to know her as well as we should have. Okay, I've went on long enough and if you're still here, reading this, Disturbing Behavior is one of the best horror teen movies since Scream.",934416000,,1528,4.756653992395437

143559,3,0792840119,"Much has been said about this being a Scream ripoff.  Here's my verdict based on my horror-film experience and my observation on the technical execution of Disturbing Behavior:
From screenwriting, directing and  cinematographic points of view, Disturbing Behavior has NOTHING to do with  ANY of the Scream movies.
Scream and Scream 2 were self-referential  commentaries on the horror genre while frankly (and dare I say not very  effectively) using the conventions of slasher films for cheap thrills.  The  value of the Scream movies was in the comedic elements:  The wink-wink,  nudge-nudge to people who know slasher films well.  The impact of Scream,  if it has impact on you, is strictly personal, as are the relationships of  the characters.  (If anything, Urban Legend is an extension of this  approach).
Disturbing Behavior is on the opposite end of the spectrum.  Sociological in its impact and its intention, broad (and often sketchy) in  its character depictions, and completely uninterested in its own  genericism, Disturbing Behavior is a conventional suspense-action piece.  It doesn't rely on gore effects and slasher-film conventions; for example,  one of the most disturbing scenes in Behavior is the scene of near-seducton  that ends in masochism -- its impact comes not from physical danger (as in  Scream and the slasher-film tradition) but from the concept.  Same for the  rest of the story -- the question is not whether these kids will get their  heads chopped off; it's whether they can retain their own identity.  And  that is NOTHING that the slasher-film tradition offers because, as shown by  The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the forefather of all slashers, the slasher  film's chief weapon is simple, straight-forward physical danger.
The look  of Disturbing Behavior is more noir than slasher, and its storyline is a  dead-serious social commentary.  Kind of like a much less complicated  version of 1984, and limited to young people instead of the whole  society.
I actually liked Disturbing Behavior even if its faults are  legion -- Marsden's questionable acting, the lack of real depth of the  Katie Holmes character (though she tries for more), and a slipshod  narrative structure.  It's worth a look for writer Scott Rosenberg's bleak  view of the institution of education.
Disturbing Behavior is no classic.  But to lump it in with Scream (admittedly, the marketing campaign for  Disturbing Behavior *did* try to cash in on the horror audience rejuvenated  by Scream) is convenient, shallow, and an act of ignorance as to how the  two movies respectively work.",921715200,11,2592,5.221951219512195
143560,5,0792840119,"From the beginning to the end this movie is brilliantly written, directed, and acted. It is the only movie I have seen in years that didn't over do the action scenes or ending. With ""Titanic"" and other movies I  felt like the directors actually thought we were stupid to believe some of  the stunts that happened. With this movie I was blown away by everything! I  hope to see a sequel that is just as good and still keeps out the fake  scenes that over do it! I love this movie and I love ""Steve"" and  Katie Holmes. They are perfect.
