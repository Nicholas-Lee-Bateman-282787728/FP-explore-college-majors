1086285,2,6305892806,"Of al the recent adaptations of Jane Austen's works, this is the real disappointment. It lacks the integrity of Persuasion and the grand sweep of the BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. There is a sense of disjointedment....very uneven story telling. A big disappointment, since it had so much to work with and could have been so much better.",963619200,7,345,4.864406779661017
1086286,4,6305892806,"I highly recommend this new adaptation of Mansfield Park. I know many hardcore Jane Austen fans have complained about it bitterly, but I liked it. Fanny Price is not my favorite Austen heroine. She is so horribly shy  and shrinking that I keep fighting an impulse to throw down the novel and  shake some life into her. Director Patricia Rozema has given her some life.  I like this Fanny! The movie is beautifully shot and intelligently  scripted. My only complaint is Rozema's emphasis of the slavery issue. It  was so obviously a personal issue with the director that it feels  artificially imposed upon the story. The idea that Fanny would come across  drawings of her uncle raping slaves in Antigua is preposterous to say the  least. But, other than that, I was very pleasantly surprised at how much I  enjoyed this movie and it sits proudly beside the other recent Austen  adaptations on my movie shelf.",963446400,4,908,4.762820512820513
1086287,5,6305892806,"Since I was not fimilar with Jane Austin's books nor the films that were made based upon them. I really didn't expect much from this film. I did  although see Emma and sad to say, I hated it. So there was another item  that keept me from thinking that Masfield Park was going to be a dull and  boring peice of film. Ohhhhh but Manfield Park is anything but. I found it  very charming, amusing, and above all, very entertaining. I also found that  Fancis O'Conner and Jonny Lee Miller had excellent chemistry together.  There was also wonderful preformances from every cast member and the  picture and music were both beautiful. And if you're not a big fan of  English spoken films it's okay. I really wasn't either but I'm sure  Mansfield Park will change all that. I loved this film and I also loved the  way that Patricia Rozema wrote and shot the end sequence. It's perfect.
Overall, Mansfield Park is an excellent film that's romantic, dramatic,  witty, and everything else that makes up a good film.",963360000,3,1004,4.584269662921348
1086288,1,6305892806,"This movie does not do Jane Austen justice. Where is the traditional apology of the father after he finds out his charge was actually right all along? What have they done to the Antiguan subplot, and where did all this  comment on the Antiguan slave trade come from? What happened to the  layabout lifestyle of the eldest son, and why was he suddenly sent to  Antigua when in the book he was good for nothing?
This movie leaves so  many questions unanswered. The biggest one of all is why did the writers  even bother calling it Mansfield Park, when it evidently is not. Henry and  Mary Crawford's deception was never so obvious as in this movie. Their  countenance was revealed in more subtle ways - the product of bored sibling  minds. But what is this? Henry Crawford actually having sex with Mrs B? And  don't even start me on the basket of fireworks and doves. Jane Austen would  never have written such trite!
Any good fan of Jane Austen will tell you  that timing is everything in telling a story. Her novels are built to  careful meter, with rigorous and thorough treatment of every situation. The  movie however, manages to gloss over every intricate detail placed so  intelligently by Jane Austen in an attempt to provide a more fast-paced  account of sexual and mental betrayal. In fact, the movie tends to be  slower than the book, and certainly less detailed (I'm not even sure that  someone who hadn't read the book would understand what was going on half  the time). Some would argue that a movie is only two hours and one cannot  possibly cram a full book's worth of information into it. It would have  been nice, however, if they'd managed to include some of the plot.
As for  the ending....well what can I say. It could have turned out differently -  but it didn't.
The only saving grace of this movie are the well-cast  actors who play Edmund Bertrum and Fanny Price. The couple are adorable,  and I'm sure that if Edmund's nostrils stop quivering, he will make a good  actor some day.",963187200,10,2004,4.577464788732394
1086289,5,6305892806,"I, similar to other theatre goers, had heard varied reviews of this movie before viewing it myself.  It had been labled feminist and highly interpretive among other, less flattering comments, but upon seeing it  myself, I discovered the film to be innovative, clever, and over all  charming.  The director of the piece felt that Fanny, while being a very  strong character, could have been stronger without being vulgar.  Miss  Price played on the screen as a independent female figure, much to the  original intention of Ms. Austen.  I feel that the film is an accurate  depiction of what the author would have written if she were alive in this  day and age.  Over all, a beautiful movie and one well worth the time and  effort if not quite the one hundred and three dollars.",962064000,7,776,4.701492537313433
1086290,3,6305892806,"Mansfield Park is thought to have been written by Jane Austen when she was in her thirties and had seen something of life and it's misfortunes. (Her novels were not printed in the order she wrote them). Many scholars believe  it may have been her last complete novel. Her sister burned all her  correspondence when she died. She was a very private person, who did not  discuss her works and quickly covered her writing when anyone entered the  room. It is likely that all of her novels reflect aspects of her inner and  outer life at the time she wrote them. Since she never married, we might  assume she couldn't possibly have based the lives of her heroines on her  own life, but that is not so. While her heroines always get their man, they  also come very very close to losing them permanently. When I think of Ms.  Austen, I imagine she was like Elizabeth Bennet when she was younger and  Anne Elliot in ""Persuasion"" when she was older.
Jane Austin  had brothers who distinguished themselves in the British Navy. I beleive  one brother was with Nelson at Trafalgar. Ms Austin's father was a vicar,  and like her character Frank in Emma, one of her brothers was raised by a  wealthy family whose name he assumed.
As she lead a relatively cloistered  life with her mother and sisters (not unlike ""Sense and  Sensibility"") she used her knowledge of other's experiences in her  novels. One of her naval brothers (who rose to Admiral from the lowest  rank--like Hornblower) wrote long letters about his adventures, very much  like Fanny Price's brother in ""Mansefield Park."" Ms Austen  admired and loved what she knew from her brother's letters. Her sentiments  are reflected in ""Persuasion"" when one of her characters says  ""I do so admire these Navy men.""  In reality, navy life was  extremely difficult and mutinies were commonplace.
Mansefield Park is  the tale of Fanny Price, a poor little girl who is sent to live with her  relatives (shades of Jane Eyre written 30-40 years later). Fanny is not a  particularly physically attractive girl in the book or the BBC adaptation  done in the 1980s. In the film, however, Fanny is pretty and witty and  rather more like Elizabeth Bennet of ""Pride and Prejudice.""
Fanny's nemesis and ""friend"" is the decidedly beautiful and  sophisitcated Ms. Crawford (who knows a great deal about ""Vices and  Rears"" -- she's speaking of the navy of course). Ms. Austen delighted  in giving her characters defects. In the book, Mary Crawford is good  natured but not principled, and Fanny is not good natured but she is very  principled. (Is beauty external or internal?) The differences between the  two women provide quite a bit of amusement and discomfort in the book, but  since the ""film"" Fanny is already beautiful some of the edge is  gone. In both the book and the film, Fanny is a better person than Mary, as  she proves by the end of the story.
From my perspective, a major flaw of  this film is it's failure to develop Fanny's important relationships with  her Naval brother and sisters. Instead, the director INVENTED a subplot  about  slavery in the West Indies and connected it to Tom Bertram's illness  which seems to be the result of his witnessing a downright non-Austen scene  involving Mr. Bartram Sr. that could have been in ""The Wild Sargasso  Sea"" prequal to Jane Eyre.
Although the book briefly alludes in the  preface to the basis for the Bertram's wealth, it never elaborates and  ""rubbing slavery in the faces of the audience"" misses what Ms.  Austen is about and why people still read her books. Ms. Austen did not  write about the political issues of the 18th-19th centuries. She wrote  about relationships. Given women had few choices, no civil rights, no  opportunities to do anything other than marry and have children or be a  spinster like Miss Norris, Ms Austen found plenty of ""social  conscience"" stuff to write about.
I find it extremely irritating  that every time the topic of women's issues arises the discussion  invariably seems to turn to race and be trumped by it. Slavery was bad bad  bad thing that occurred to blacks AND WHITES (yes, there were white slaves  at this time), but Austen's books are about her observations in her own  life -- the disadvantage of and cruelty towards English men and women by  those who thought and still think they are better than others owing to  wealth and the priviliges associated with birth.
Ms. Austen was aware of  social class distinctions and she uses her knowledge to make witty  observations about pretentious and immorality. (She wrote during the  Regency Period when the aristocracy left much to be desired.)
The book  and movie use a device created by Shakespeare--the play within the play.  And Ms. Austin is making fun of this device. Whereas the play within the  play in Shakespere's Hamlet leads to discovery and resolution (Hamlet traps  his father's killer), Mansefield Park's play is a disaster that leads to  dissolution (Father traps children and puts them on probation).
One of  the fun things to do with Austen's books is to look for opposites and  recurring characterizations.  For example, foolish women who risk all for a  bad bad man and foppish fools with money who have their suits of marriage  taken seriously.
If you have read the book, you may be disappointed in  the film. I saw the film in the theater and I don't plan to buy the DVD.  Rent it before you buy it if you haven't already seen it.",959990400,27,5439,4.7502679528403

The whole point in the book was her steadfast refusal of him for marriage. That made her judgment seem so appropriate after his turnabout. Ugh. I can't say enough.

1086540,3,6305892806,"Terrible adaptation.  I feel like the screen writer exploited Austen to channel her politics.  The slavery story line was unnecessary.  If you want to make a movie about 19th Century British slave holdings, make one.  Leave Jane Austen alone.  I also think that they made Fanny's family overly impoverished in an attempt to serve the same politics.  They could have used all that time wasted on sticking to the book.",1515715200,,416,4.871428571428571
1086541,3,6305892806,"As many others have said, this version takes liberties with the original novel.  It is very good in its faithfulness to the setting and to many of the main characters, but as an adaptation it neglects some relationships from the novel that are most intriguing to me and it introduces a sensational but wholly original plot line (slavery).  For example, Mrs Norton's treatment of Fanny is, to me, an important part of the book, but is little developed here.  Fanny is a more vibrant character in the movie than in the book, and is given an inclination toward creative writing, but this development may be of some necessity in making a movie.

Henry's pursuit of Fanny is done well.  I have sympathy for him, and I think this is faithful to Ms Austen's character.  Except for his outburst at her final refusal.

The slavery and slave trade in Antigua aspect is jarringly unpleasant (and shades Sir Bertram's character indelibly).  That is not to say it was or is not an important issue, but I enjoy Ms Austen's works for their timeless authenticity to relationships, not for the advocacy of the advancement human rights, though they are, of course, of the highest consequence.

The ending is a bit strange.  Oh well.

The movie S&S takes liberties, too, but it is still an excellent adaptation that I feel is more faithful to the original work.",1515456000,4,1342,4.716738197424893

1086618,3,6305892806,"Mansfield Park is one of Austen's more complicated novels.  This makes it difficult to make a faithful adaptation in the time constraints of a movie. And it is a fair question - should a movie try to be a faithful adaptation of the work it is based off of, or should it simply stand alone on its own?  There are arguments  for both sides to be sure, but I think by taking the name of a famous work of fiction, there is an expectation that the movie will try to stay faithful to the spirit of the original work, otherwise it is like it is borrowing a famous name in order to sell more tickets.  And that is where I have a problem with this movie.  In the book, Fanny is an excessively timid and frail young woman.  She is passive to the point of being a bit irritating.  Frances O'Conner portrays her as a spirited and strong person, who spouts off her opinions in a way that is nearly anachronistic.  And Sir Thomas is a forbidding character in the book, but he is also a pious man with real values that he tries to live by.  He is out of touch with what is going on with his own family though, which allows his daughters to go astray.  In the movie he is coldly selfish, and doesn't seem like a good person at all.  The slave trade is mentioned in the book - but only once.  In the movie it is oddly a major plot point (many of the characters are practically abolitionists in the movie.  An admirable sentiment, but feels again like cramming modern sensibility on a period piece.) The Crawfords are incredibly charming in the book, and I have to admit I sort of root for them.  They are not bad people but are easily tempted by worldly things.  The movie did a decent job portraying them.  But I am rambling a bit  - The movie does try to capture what a dependent woman's plight was at the time, and has the obligatory Jane Austen happy marriage at the end.  It is not bad.  It is also not great, and strays far from the book in key points.  Admittedly I am biased, I am a Jane Austen fan and Mansfield Park is probably my favorite one of her novels.  I would like to see it portrayed on screen with more faithfulness to the original.",1509667200,9,2135,4.196560196560196

1086620,1,6305892806,"We hated Mansfield Park film.  We almost stopped the film 3 X, but I knew I was going to write a negative review on Amazon, so I decided to finish it! Ha!  I was so angry that they put the anti-slavery agenda as part of the film. There was NOTHING, not even a hint, of anything about slavery in the book. To make Sir Bertram an evil slave owner and rapist of slaves (the awful drawings shown) is just unconscionable in my book. Then to make the oldest son, Tom, a good guy and Sir Bertram the bad guy just is so irritating. In the book, Tom was a rake and a gambler - losing tons of money and the father would pay off his debts. The father got sick of this and insisted he come to Antigua with him on business (all that was said about the country).  Then to me the movie did not make clear at all the Henry had a bet with his sister Mary Crawford that he could get Fanny to love him, AFTER he had an inappropriate relationship with Moriah AND Julia during the ""play"" - that both were hurt by him and that is why Fanny didn't trust him.  He was not sincere at all, but you really can't see that in the movie. In the book Sir Bertram was considered gruff a bit, but a man of principle - he never made any suggestive or lewd comments to Fanny such as the one in the movie, he was truly appalled by the morals of his children, he had a true fatherly affection for Fanny.  Another thing that REALLY bugged me, is they made his wife addicted to opium and an alcoholic. In the book, NO such thing is even hinted at - it was a humorous diversion in the book that she was indolent, and shallow and just sat around doing embroidery - she was never made into such a character as the movie made her. It was made clear she truly loved her husband and Fanny. My question is WHY!! ??? Why add this horrible anti-slavery agenda and opium addiction to a JANE AUSTEN book????  I've seen many movies that changed details around, but it seemed not to ruin the main details of the book like this did!  One detail quite changed around was that Edward and/or Fanny did not ""catch"" Moriah and Henry in  bed together - they got together at the home of some friends in London or somewhere and ran off - I could live with a change like that because the end result was the same, but the other changes are just out of the pale of reasonable to me.

1086624,1,6305892806,"I love Jane Austen and many of the great film adaptations of her books but I couldn't get through this, mostly because of the highly politicized nature of the first 15 minutes alone. The young Fanny is CLEARLY not British. Couldn't they find a British girl anywhere in Britain to do that role? This young actress is obviously Syrian, Turkish, Pakistani or some other Middle Eastern persuasion.  It was awkward and almost laughable as this Middle Eastern girl said goodbye in the opening scenes to her OBVIOUSLY all-White family, as it's very clear in the book (and this movie) that Fanny is not an adopted child.  She was simply given to relatives to raise as she was the oldest, and there were too many other children in the family to care for. This improper cross-cultural casting was even more distracting after this Middle Eastern girl grew up into a White woman! Imagine that! Yes, a clearly British/White woman plays the adult Fanny, which makes the casting oddity of the non-White child even more strange and her transition to adulthood jarring for the viewer.  Multicultural and cross-racial casting in films today has become preposterous and now far exceeds the level of believability.

Adding to the heavy-handed political overtone, which was NOT part of the original Austen novel, was the slave ship seen on Fanny's trip to Mansfield Park and the remark made by the stagecoach driver. Someone just HAD to get the ""White people owned slaves"" guilt worked in their somehow. A very cheap and entirely unnecessary shot that had nothing to do with the story. Then why put it in at all? Aside from the non-White casting of young Fanny, and the slave ship nonsense, was the mention by the uncle to his daughters that Fanny (cast as a non-White girl) was NOT their equal. Nice way to bring racism and completely unnecessary controversy into what's supposed to be a classic 19th century romance, NOT a political debate. If young Fanny had been cast properly with a little British/White girl, the line about inequality from the uncle would have made no sense, which isn't in the book anyway. That's how it's clear the screenwriters and producers of this film have a political ax to grind, while corrupting a beautiful story of Austen's to do it. Just tell the story and leave politics out of it! I think I'll check out older film adaptations that are free of political agendas.",1505779200,3,2378,4.806845965770171

While several characters are spot on (Maria, Lady Bertram, Tom, Mr. Crawford and others), the heroine does not resemble Fanny Price at all.  Fanny, in this version, is a vivacious and outspoken girl who writes thrilling stories and has strong abolitionist sympathies.  That may be a winning formula for a protagonist, but it is nothing like Jane Austen's reserved, timid, sensible, and obedient Fanny Price.

The relationship between Edmund and Fanny is also unrecognizable.  They are raucous friends instead of a protector and his charge.  The complete lack of William Price leaves a gaping hole in the story, as he provides the only evidence of Mr. Crawford's potential for having good character.

If all the producers wanted to do was hack Jane Austin's story line, we could handle that, if it was done well. This DVD was incinerated along with other trash in the burner out back. Fortunately it was cheap.

1086807,3,6305892806,"Jane Austen's ""Mansfield Park"" is surely the most difficult of her novels to translate to the screen.  Her heroine, Fanny Price, is not a standard Jane Austen heroine, brave and self-assertive.  In the book, she is a shy and uneducated but dutiful girl with a strong moral sense.  Her blossoming into an attractive young woman is rightly a startling event in the story and the hook for a number of crucial plot points, embedded in the morality and manners of Jane Austen's era.

This 1999 film offers a very loosely translated version of the original story, one with very modern values.  ""Mansfield Park"" is strongly cast, with a young Johnny Lee Miller as Edmund and an engaging Frances O'Connor as Fanny, and well-executed from a purely cinematic point of view, with lots of wonderful period venues.  Those who watch it without having read the original novel are likely to find it an entertaining period piece drama.  Those devoted to the original Jane Austen story may find it cringe-worthy where it steps decidedly away from the original.  Fanny, for example, is invested with some of the character of author Jane Austen, while the subtle subtexts of sexuality and slavery in the original are much more prominent.  Very cautiously recommended.",1500249600,2,1247,4.956730769230769

I was wrong. I found the changes in the story line to range from very disappointing (the lack of William completely) to repulsive (Sir John's relationships with slaves). In addition, the portrayal of Fanny didn't at all resemble the character from the book and, after all, Fanny is the heart of the story. I won't be watching this one again.

Fanny, a highly principled, very restrained, gentle and deeply observant and loving person, was turned into a wishy washy, cynical feminist in this movie. The characters of Lord and Lady Bertram have nothing - at all - to do w/the characters they're 'adapted from'. Pretty much the same for the rest of the characters and plot.

She was the most human and best understood out of all, and possibly the least appreciated because she's so well reserved and knows herself better than many young people do at that age.

I was disappointed that Fanny's character gave in at one point, where in the book she held fast to her convictions, which is her greatest attribute- she knows what is right and follows through with it, even when it is difficult! I also have issue with how Mary Crawford was shown to be a bad person at heart. No, she wasn't perfect in the book, but her faults were more to blame on being taught poorly.",1456358400,,575,4.236363636363636

I have no problem with deviating from the source material (I gave Sense, Sensibility and Sea Monsters a go), but whoever wrote this screen play either never read or deeply hated the novel this is supposed to portray.
If you like Jane Austen's novel, DO NOT watch this movie, unless you want to razz it or have a drinking game based on how poorly done the majority of it is. There are far better adaptations than this one! Such a long and serious book is hard to translate into a movie or even a mini-series, but the gravity, the emotion and the growth of the characters and their connections to each other are all missing from this film.

1088578,3,6305892806,"Does not follow the book very closely -- but it would be impossible to make such a movie in modern times, for the book character of Fanny Price is not that appealing to the modern sensibility -- she is passive and silently judgmental.  For the movie, her character is remade to be more active and engaging.  If this change is accepted, the movie is fairly well-constructed.  The plot of the novel is Austen's most complicated, and had to be compressed seriously to fit into a 2 hour framework.  This compression loses a lot of the flavor of the conflict that Edmund faces over Mary (passively observed and mourned by Fanny), and so the movie falls flat.  In my heretical opinion, the movie should have startled the world by following the alternate ending outlined by Austen, and have Fanny marry Crawford after Edmund wed Mary, and then show them all in ordinary life years later -- not a happy ending, just a real ending.",1452902400,,922,4.631901840490798

1088710,4,6305892806,"This is a wonderful period movie loosely based on Jane Austen's book of the same name. That being said, if you have read Jane Austen's book and love the story AS IS, this is not the movie for you. However, I would keep in mind it would be almost impossible to adapt any of her books keeping all the characters and actions in tact. It was written for a different time period and the expectation of story pace was very different.

In regards to content, the movie's mentions/opinions of slavery at the time and the more ""realistic"" portrayals of life during the early 1800s was mentioned by many reviewers. Sometimes modern movie makers can't help but bring modern sensibilities to such loaded topics like slavery. Although there was speculation as to Jane Austen's personal beliefs, she did not write that into her books, and prevalent period of the time was very different than today. Also, some reviewers were not happy with Lady Bertram's liberal use of opium. Sorry, but there was much use of opium aka ""laudanum"" during that period. My personal quibble with the movie had to presenting Jane's family living in squalor. Which I do not remember from the book. Although the Price family poor, and no question maggots and roaches were part of every day life, it was unlikely they would be crawling along the dinner table.

Watch the movie for what it is, the acting is really quite good and the story is interesting. If you want a better representation of Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, I would strongly suggest one of the older BBC series like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mansfield-Park-BBC-1986/dp/B000244F8M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mansfield Park (BBC 1986)</a>&nbsp;which does better justice to the book.",1448755200,3,1757,5.226950354609929

1088910,3,6305892806,"Pros: The movie is beautifully shot, and money was obviously spent on the cinematography and set design. The plot brought in some historical trivia that played a subtext in the novel (such as slave revolts in Antigua). Fanny was true to the book in looks. They didn't cut out some characters such as Susie or Mr. Yates. Fanny's Portsmouth family is included in the story, as is her motivations against poverty to marry. Tom is played as the drunkest son to ever live, reminiscent of children today spiraling into drugs and alcoholism, and it makes sense why his father despairs of him. Mr. Crawford really goes all out in his courtship of Fanny, and is very well played as debonair and devoted. And finally, Hugh Bonneville (of Downton Abbey) plays a delightfully bumbling Mr. Rushworth. Those pretty much sum up the pros.

Cons: Fanny is not Fanny. Although she is spunkier, with more interests than book Fanny, she is not very true to the book. Fanny is a 'writer' in the story, and often speaks directly to the camera or narrates over stilted freeze frames of a scene. The worst thing about the adaptation is the grossly exaggerated plot twists. Mariah's infidelity is seen in a topless love scene which Fanny walks in on (honestly with far too much grunting to be heard up the stairs), Lord Bertram becomes a slave rapist/driver (yes, I'm serious) as faithfully transcribed by his son Tom, Edmund hardly has more personality than a brick and seems extremely wishy-washy (especially after the weird girl on girl seduction trick Mary Crawford uses to get him in the play), and the two aunts are barely characters. And finally, they cut the part of William Price altogether, blending him and Susie into one, so that Fanny is always writing to Susie. The seduction between Edmund and Fanny feels gross and incestuous because they set them up too well as brother and sister (and no William to stand in as an actual brother). There was also a confusing moment after Fanny walks in on Mr. Crawford banging Mariah in which Edmund decides to make his move on her while they hug apologetically. Talk about cringe-worthy timing.

Overall, it's as the stars indicate ""okay."" Better than some adaptations, but not if you're looking for classic Austen Fanny Price.",1447459200,,2254,4.806701030927835

1089095,1,6305892806,"Fanny, who is supposed to by shy in the book, is a vivacious gal who loves to write stories.

This movie throws in an entire section on slavery (screaming from the ships as Fanny drives off to Mansfield), including Fanny discovering a book of Tom's drawings featuring slave mutilation and sexual abuse in graphic detail.  (Committed by Mr. Bertram and Tom in Antigua!)  Mr. Bertram is an upstanding gentleman who, as far as Jane Austin is concerned, doesn't chop, hang and fornicate with slaves.

Fanny also walks in on Maria and Henry while they are in flagrante in the room next door to where Tom is recovering.  Later, Mary actually says the content of her private letter to Fanny concerning how to reintegrate Maria into society in front of the entire family!  Yes, she suggests in front of the father and mother that it would be great if Tom died so that Edmund could be rich and they could give parties and dinners.  Amazing.

Furthermore, the brother William is entirely left out of the movie.  In Portsmouth, Fanny actually accepts Henry's proposal, and then changes her mind the next day.  The whole point of Fanny is her constancy and strong morals.  She would NEVER do that.

Fortunately, you can by a very good version from WGBH Boston, starring Billie Piper and Blake Ritson.

Some of my favorite actors are in this film, including a young Hugh Bonneville as Mr. Rushworth, and I had really been looking forward to it.  I was very disappointed.",1445126400,,1457,4.707509881422925

1090172,3,6305892806,"This is really a 2 1/2 star review but I'm feeling generous. What I liked: the woman who plays Fanny is very appealing. While movie Fanny is much more feisty and outspoken than book Fanny, it works for me because I think a passive heroine is hard to portray in a film (though the 1995 Persuasion managed to do it). The visuals are beautiful and I like the way they contrast the lifestyle at Mansfield Park with Fanny's family home. The evil Crawford siblings are a lot of fun and easy on the eyes.

What I disliked (a lot): Johnny Lee Miller's Edmund comes across as weak and a bit feeble minded as he's manipulated by Mary Crawford. Part of this is textual but unfortunately it makes you wonder why Fanny is so desperately in love with him. Miller is very handsome but suffers from comparison with Alessandro Nivolo's Henry Crawford, who may be morally dissolute but is also dead sexy. Another big problem: the filmmaker flirts with a critique of slavery, including a scene where Fanny finds a book of drawings of whippings and rapes of slaves owned by her uncle. The scene is shocking and yet the subject of slavery barely comes up again in the movie, being dismissed at the end with a voiceover by Fanny explaining her uncle has sold his sugar plantation. It's tremendously icky and doesn't do anything for the story.

Overall, didn't mind wasting some time on this on a boring Sunday but wouldn't watch it again.",1437436800,,1416,4.570866141732283

1090349,1,6305892806,"I wish I had read the reviews first. So, understand this is a caution to Austen purists. I collect DVDs of any Austen books that I can find. I didn't even think anything about it because I've never had any problems before. I mean they are Austen books. I simply plugged it in and set back to enjoy my favorite story line. I was caught completely off guard by this film that is a sham of Mansfield Park. Austen would turn over in her grave if she knew what they've done to her story line. Fanny is supposed to be an innocent and in this film she is portrayed as a..temptress...a...I don't know what. Who is this person? Then, to be subjected to, albeit they were drawings/sketches of the atrocities of the workers/slaves at the hands of Sir Thomas was more than I could bear. I was horrified at the blatant use of nudity...yes the dear girl did leave her husband for Crawford...however, I didn't need to see their naked bodies. And in her father's house? Don't people lock doors? I destroyed the movie...the good parts went by way of the garbage with the garbage parts. Purchase with care.",1436745600,3,1088,4.472361809045226

1090351,3,6305892806,"As others have said, this version is not for the Austen purist.  As far as that goes, IMHO, the 1983 version with Sylvestra Touluza is better than this, even with all its stagey atmosphere, it is at least closer to the book.  The slave issue....well, even though Jane does not tell us what the issues are with Sir Thomas' interest in Antigua, in those times it very well could have been a slave issue.  But since that is NOT in the book, it should NOT have been assumed and put in this movie.  Bad.  Also, I always did wonder why the heck Lady Betram was portrayed as indolent and just bone idle lazy.  Maybe it was opium, in Janes mind.  But she never said in the book, so it shouldn't be here.  Bad.  After watching only the first 40 minutes, I felt this movie literally shoved hours and hours of reading from a book, into 20 minutes of film.  It was quite a bit into the book before the play was ever even attempted, but here, within 30 minutes the play is on and Sir Thomas has arrived home to break it up.  What happend to all the hullabuloo with the parts of the play being distributed?  What happened to the squabble between Maria and Julia over a particular part?  Also.....what the heck happened to Fanny's brother William that she was writing to constantly, not her sister.  Well anyway, set alone, this is a very good movie, and very watchable.  But for those of us who have read the book a multitude of times, and seen other adaptations, this one does fall a bit short.  But its not wholy bad, so I give it three stars.  For the Austen purist, do bother, it will only make you made and you'll come on here and flame up the comments.  Just move on.",1436745600,,1659,4.279742765273312
1090352,1,6305892806,"Note: I have not read the book. I am merely judging this film on it's own merits.

Mansfield Park starts out okay but quickly becomes a boring slog. Thirty minutes, forty minutes, fifty minutes, nothing of great significance was going on beyond the monotonous aristocratic jibber jabber and I asked myself ""Do I really want to see how it ends?"" The acting frankly isn't anything to write home about and the way the story unfolds is so trite and predictable you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that Fanny is going to wind up with Edmund and that Tom and Maria are no good from the get go even before the hokey pokey scene. The slavery elements just seem tacked on as an afterthought but even that goes nowhere.

1090601,4,6305892806,"To put it bluntly, this is not Jane Austen's Mansfield Park. Austen's novel is used as a template for a satire on the old English landed classes, including not at all subtle attacks on the manner in which some estates were supported and maintained. The moral degradation of the Bertram family in going this route is best reflected in the down-at-heel state of the interiors of the mansion playing Mansfield Park itself, even though James Purefoy's rarely seen dissipate Bertram scion Tom eventually gets to shove the situation in our faces. Be warned, there is breaking of the fourth wall on numerous occasions, especially when Fanny (Frances O'Connor) is reading off what's she writing to her sister (Sophia Myles). And can you imagine this Fanny Price retiring to a vicarage? Far more likely she'd motivate the reformation of the libertine Henry Crawford (Alessandro Nivola) and go off with him to see the world.

All the same this film, as satire, achieves an agreeable level of entertainment. In some ways it presages A Cock and Bull Story (also filmed at Kirby Hall) as a repurposing of a classic novel in order to derive something fresh from the material.",1435276800,,1161,4.893401015228426

In fact, Fanny's character is drawn almost verbatim from material lifted from Miss Austen's surviving correspondence with her sister Cassandra.  This version of Mansfield Park should have explicitly stated somewhere on it's packaging that it is VERY LOOSELY BASED UPON it's source material.

Jane Austen is one of my favorite authors. I've read all of her books, some several times. After watching this movie, I decided another read of the book was called for. I can't say I was happy with some of the changes. But neither am I outraged, as some reviewers seem to be. What works in a 19th century novel written by a woman who was relatively sheltered from the world, doesn't mean it works for a modern day American audience. I can only assume that some of the changes were an attempt to make the story more relatable  (fail). (Spoiler) The elimination of brother William makes sense. His character is not necessary to the plot. When condensing a book into a movie, this is important. What confused and annoyed me was the ADDITION of so much not found in the book. I am always against an attempt to rewrite history. The entire slavery plot line is ridiculous. Austen had one sentence in the book devoted to the topic. It is a casual mention with absolutely no evidence to support the idea that Tom Bertram quarreled with his father about having slaves on his plantation in Antigua. The only time Fanny asked a question about it, her lack of asking more questions about it (much to her uncle's disappointment) certainly doesn't indicate strong feelings on the subject. The realities of slavery are not something Miss Austen would have  knowledge and understanding to write about. I think the screenwriters made a huge mistake inserting this subject into the movie. Assigning modern day sensibilities to characters living in another time and culture is almost always a mistake. But forcing it into a story like Mansfield Park, took it from mistake to insult. I'm insulted on Jane Austen's behalf. It changed the characters, the plot and the whole point of the book! The liberties they took with Fanny's character! She was never fond of Mary Crawford, she would never have accepted Mr. Crawford. And if she had, she would be incapable of saying she changed her mind the next day. She is too well trained in giving trouble to no one.

Fanny Price is a dead bore. She can go on and on about pine trees and shrubbery. She is physically weak. She has no spine. Austen wrote her that way for a reason! Her Goodness is her saving grace. Patient, kind, loyal. These are her assets. The screenwriters didn't get it. And suddenly we are transported into Little Women, where Fanny is replaced by Jo, the would be writer.

I could go on, but I've more than made my point. As a stand-alone movie it could have been more enjoyable, but in the shadow of such a celebrated novel it simply doesn't deliver.",1427414400,,2623,4.644396551724138

1091928,1,6305892806,"How can truly excellent actors appear in such a bad movie?

The movie has the same name as an Austen novel. It has some characters with the same names. Not all of the characters in the novel appear in the movie. (Chief among the absentees is Fannie's brother William. Removing him and the  Fannie/William dynamic changes everything.) It borrows a few of the events in the novel's plot. That's the end of the resemblance. Now obviously when a novel is turned into a movie, some changes will be made. However, here the very characters of the key players are utterly changed. Fannie here is a wholly different person than the heroine of the Austen novel. She is a feisty young woman--not at all the shy self-effacing young woman of the novel. When THIS Fannie initially turns down Mr. Crawford's proposal it is not in the least surprising. When Sir Thomas says he had not thought THIS Fannie headstrong, you want to laugh out loud. Mrs. Rushmore becomes a woman who turns to adultery because she is trapped in an unhappy marriage with a man of limited intellect.

Moreover, even if one tries to think of this as an entirely different story that just happens to have the same title and names for the characters, it's a bad movie. There are so many things that happen in this movie that simply would not have happened at the time in which it is set. Even the costumes are wrong; some of the outfits would not have been worn at the time in which the movie is set. Mary Crawford wears a beautiful black dress; black would have been reserved for mourning and this particular dress would have been quite odd for mourning! .

As others have said, the abolitionist subplot here is created out of whole cloth; it's not in the book at all. It's more than a bit idiotic. Tom, the eldest son, draws pictures of the awful things done to slaves at jhis father's plantation in Antigua. His father appears in some of these drawings. When Sir Thomas discovers Fanny looking at him, he says ""My son is a madman,"" implying that the events depicted did not occur. To me, his reaction is not consistent with what a slave owner of that era would have said---certainly not a slave owner who was capable of doing the things depicted in the drawings.

All in all...just a dreadful mess.",1425427200,6,2258,4.538083538083538

1092673,3,6305892806,"You would think that slavery was still around from all the propaganda being constantly put out in the movies. In Mansfield park, it takes a prominent part, which was not the case in the book. Also, the head of the family is portrayed as a bit of a lecher, albeit in undertones and the mother as an addict, whereas the older son's dissolution is supposed to be disgust at the slave trade. Granted that some (minor) changes are allowed in film adaptations, this is jarring. One positive change is in Fanny's character; from my standpoint, it is a welcomed one. The book's Fanny was a characterless, insipid, cow. The film's Fanny is much better.

Another point: there were several subplots within the book that were interesting. These have been jettisoned in the movie. Instead, valuable time was wasted in the film with Fanny's inane writings to her sister.

Nonetheless, apart from these ""shortcomings,"" it is a good movie.",1416182400,,923,4.8354430379746836

1092741,1,6305892806,"If it had a different title, it would be an ok movie but still not very great. The story line is absolutely weak, depending on the slave trade for adding a little interest. As it has that title, it is absolutely ridiculous because it is not coming close to the book by half. The characters have different personalities - Mrs. Norris is a much weaker female and Fanny a much stronger female than in the book, the father of the house becomes a deep sinner compared to the honorable man who made one or two mistakes in raising his kids. Edmund seems to be much more critical and starched up.  Even though Fanny comes over as a strong character, she accepts Mr. Crawford's offer of marriage, wishing for a comfortable living (- of all things!) at some point only to change her mind later on. This is so not consistent: the stronger Fanny being weak in exactly that point that the original Fanny never wavers. It seems to me that someone wrote the screenplay after hearing about the story from a group of people in the pub, and trying to make sense of what he/she has heard... As I said, with a different title it might not have annoyed me so much, but I still would not see it a second time.",1415232000,3,1187,4.346846846846847

1092746,3,6305892806,"Mansfield Park is probably my favorite Austen novel.  This movie does not come close.  It is witty and entertaining, but does not, as other reviewers have mentioned, depict Fanny Price correctly.  The heroine's appeal in Mansfield Park is that she is soft-spoken, gentle, and uncomplaining, and that she asserts herself not through impetuosity but rather by steadfastly holding to her convictions despite being bullied and misjudged.  Fanny Price was no suffragette any more than Sir Thomas was a sadistic torturer of slaves.  I do not know why producers seem to feel that a movie will not ""sell"" unless it contains gratuitous material.  Aren't they skilled enough to bring out the best in a story without adding their own embellishments?  That said, it was amusing to have Austen's earlier letters and writings woven into the plot as having been penned by Fanny.  Personally, I would have considered a different heroine more suitable for the attribution of this literature--perhaps Elizabeth Bennett from Pride and Prejudice, who was known for her sharp sense of satirical humor.

I am sure many people will enjoy watching this movie, but anyone who knows anything about Jane Austen in general, and Mansfield Park in particular, will find it hard to reconcile the movie with the book.",1414800000,8,1285,5.110047846889952

1092826,5,6305892806,"The movie that made me an Austen fan. I had dismissed Jane Austen novels as some sort of historical chit lit with the same plot - a woman in need of a husband. After I saw this film, I was so impressed with the writing that I looked up the screenwriter - and discovered that most of the film was taken right from Austen's writings (not just ""Mansfield Park"" itself). Jane Austen was a wickedly sharp satirist, and, if you've never given her a chance, this film is a great introduction to her brilliance. Great performances all around and one of the best-cast films based on Austen's works that I've ever seen.",1414368000,,609,4.446428571428571

The whole plot of Mansfield Park is on the sweet and gentle goodie-goodie Fanny, and if she's not sweet and gentle... and in this movie, she's not...  the the book's plot doesn't work for the movie.  There were so many important plot devices in the book that, while they are presented (as if from a check-list) in the movie, they aren't connected in any way to anything, just sort of stuck there in the middle (my husband had no idea what was going on most of the time).  And then there are the added-in plot devices that are not related to the original book... which are also not connected to the story in this movie, so I'm left wondering what the point was.

1092830,4,6305892806,"Not Jane Austen's most notable book.  The heroine is a door mat.  But in this version, Frances O'Connor manages to illuminate the reasons why Fanny Price puts up with so much.  In fact, there is a line in the sand where she won't tread in spite of her family's best efforts.  Johnny Lee Miller is the typical Austen male.  But here too his motives and the influences on him are more understandable than in other versions of Mansfield Park that I've seen.

1092831,3,6305892806,"The movie mansfield park is an interesting period piece that shows both poor and semi-rich British lifestyles during the slave plantation period. The father and son would go to the plantation and the women would remain behind and lead a simple life. The manor was beautiful old home in the country. The lead female character moved there from the port town, because there were too many mouths to feed. Her mother's sister took her in to help do chores. She fell in love with her cousin, but a gentleman suitor tried in vain to win her over.

The movie developed several characters, including the poor mother, father, sister, three cousins, aunt and uncle and unrelated brother and sister. It was a little challenging to follow at times, and it did drag on a bit.

Overall, it is an interesting intellectual movie that is a good break from the violence of today's common movies. The only significant flaw for me was that although the lead character was shown to develop her literary talent through reading in the extensive library at mansfield park, it was always assumed that she somehow learned how to read and write at a young age in the poor port town where she was born. This does not fit with reality, because few ""commoners"" if any, of that period were schooled in reading and writing.",1414022400,,1290,4.6784140969163

However, the story never really seemed to find its feet.  The characters and the plot were an odd mishmash of stuff from the original text and stuff that was brand new, resulting in a feeling of inconsistency (for this viewer, at least).  Some things that were kept from the original text just didn't seem to make sense in the context of all the changes.  For the sake of coherence, it seems to me that the screenplay writer should have either committed to reimagining the story in a consistent way or chosen to stay roughly within the boundaries of Austen's book.

1093212,1,6305892806,"THIS REVIEW HAS SPOILERS, but obviously the best kind in that they will spare you seeing the movie.

This version features good enough and generally attractive actors, some nice scenery, and rank stupidity. I guess Jane Austen needed to be taught a lesson - by a female writer/director Patricia Rozema - no less. The credits say this is from the book and Austens early letters and journals, which is presumably where the drawing of a slave giving oral sex to Sir Thomas comes from because I don't remember that in the book, Mansfield Park. I think I probably would have.

The story: There were once three sisters. One was a great beauty and married Sir Thomas Bertram and then settled in for 30 years of heir-bearing and a slow downward spiral of poor understanding, absence of curiosity and pampering at the great country estate of Mansfield Park. One married a parson at Mansfield Park named Mr. Norris. They had no children and then Mr. Norris died leaving Mrs. Norris without much money and an obsession for hanging on to what she has. She ingratiates herself to her brother-in-law Sir Thomas, attends to Lady Bertram, and inserts herself into the rearing of their 4 children including 2 spoiled daughters. The third sister married for love way below her station to a poor lieutenant of marines named Price. The Prices now live in relative squalor in the port city of Portsmouth with a generally uncounted number of children, a dissolute servant, dirty dishes and Mr. Prices alcoholism and gout.
At some point Mrs. Norris and Lady Bertram prevail upon Lord Thomas to do something kind for their sister in taking her eldest daughter Fanny Price on as a ward, so to speak. Fanny arrives at Mansfield Park as a frightened and homesick self-possessed and obviously superior child, with unfinished manners. It is made clear within her first few hours that she will be treated with forbearance, but she will never be valued as highly as her cousins with whom she shares Mansfield Park. She is primarily there as a companion for Lady Bertram. Not a servant, but far from an equal. She leaves behind parents she doesnt care much about but also a beloved brother, William, who will show up later. (except he won't cuz this version is so screwed-up.)

Fanny's eldest cousin Tom, the heir to Mansfield Park, pays little attention to her; her two female cousins Maria (pronounced like Mariah Carey) and Julia are amused at her rough manners and apparent ignorance. Only her cousin Edmund treats her as a family member and friend.

It would be easy to dismiss complaints from Austen purists that this doesnt follow the book by saying the book is unfilmable and we have to cut out all the intricately dull parts for the advancement of the story. Fine, I agree, this isn't a book that demands careful preservation of every scene, but is it asking too much for at least some plot clarity or, say, character development? There is no effort to establish the characters or their flaws. Youre just supposed to know them because youve read the book. But then it strips characters of any rationale for their actions and so both reader and non-reader alike are left baffled by the characters actions. And if Jane Austen is robbed of the crystalline clarity of her portrayal of human subjects and plotlines, why not just call it a day and move on to Danielle Steele?

The cumulative effect is like having the story described to you by a 12 year-old breathlessly describing the behavioral high points, but always missing the main point.

Now that Fanny is about 18, you know that shes in love with her kindly cousin Edmund. There is nothing in the movie to tell us this, you're just sposed to know cuz you read the book, right? A laughably clumsy momentary insertion of slow motion horse riding clears things right up.

I have Adobe Premiere Elements, too. Maybe I should try that.

Later when Edmund loans the horse to a new romantic interest Fanny appears to be ambivalent about him but rather peeved about the horse.

Frances O'Connor is born to play any Austen heroine EXCEPT the halting, slightly wounded Fanny Price. The characters power lies in her silent observational skills and her fundamental decency, as well as the dramatic tug of war between her desires and her duties as a grateful poor relation. As part of Rozema's re-imagining she is converted into a poor man's Elizabeth Bennet with a permanently arched eyebrow, unearned wisdom and juvenile snottiness. The moral center of the story has become a drama queen with a Cinderella complex.

It gets worse. Sir Thomas must go to Antigua to deal with some business failures and will take his irresponsible gambling and alcohol addicted elder son Tom with him. Austens Tom was a pain because he was a spoiled older brother who didn't care about anyone but himself and couldn't hold a candle to sober and responsible younger brother Edmund. Rozemas Tom is a tortured artist who paints laughable self-portraits and is damaged by dark revelations of his fathers behavior.

And it is not enough that the two older men in Fannys life are either alcoholic layabouts or chilly autocrats as per Austen, they must in Rozemas world have an unhealthy leering attraction to their biological relation and hold their hugs just a little too long. At last, the greatest authoress in the English language has achieved relevance through the cutting-edge grad school project that is this movie.

We are briefly rescued by the arrival of the dangerous Crawfords; brother Henry and sister Mary. We never learn anything useful about their past or why they are dangerous  they just are, okay? Alessandro Nivola and Embeth Davidtz are perfectly fine, but Mary Crawford is one of Austens most finely shaded characters - which is saying something - but here shes all chopped to pieces and we don't know why Edmund gets all moist over her.

The elegant Justine Waddell is wasted as younger sister Julia Bertram.

And then Fanny equates her position to that of Sir Thomass female slaves. Seriously? With a bonus horse ride in the rain. With more ham-fisted slow-mo.

Thuggish playwright Harold Pinter is the thuggish Sir Thomas. Man, this reeks.

The abrupt and pointless ballroom scene is the silliest montage since Team America - World Police. Ive got a fever  and the only prescription is MORE SLOW MO!. I think they ran out of money for a choreographer so they just kinda twirled around for the close-ups.

Im not sure if the urge to vomit is from the all the twirling or just on general principle alone.

The last vestige of Austens meticulous character development circles the drain with a sucking sound by way of Henry Crawford. The book and even the other wobbly film versions have him manipulate the Prices poverty by stepping up and paying for Fannys beloved brother Williams commission as a lieutenant in the hierarchical cash-conscious Royal Navy. She is later horrified to discover it was all a ploy to set her up for a marriage proposal. But since this script has disappeared William like a South American dissident, Fanny rejects Henry without any of the disquieting guilt that her situation would otherwise require. Perhaps it was all to save valuable screen time but then we waste several minutes on another montage of Sir Thomas berating Fanny, complete with cross-fades, close-ups on his mouth, and echoey sound effects.

Fanny is sent back to her impoverished family in Portsmouth to jolt her into reality. There is an excruciating scene where Fanny is gifted fireworks and freed doves (slow mo!!) but finally there are a couple of non-Austen compliant but still very good scenes; the first with her mother advising her to consider creature comforts over true love  while her husband bellows for her attentions; and the other showing Henry Crawford fumbling his way to decency and elevated status in Fannys eyes. So she friend-zones him by making him share in her disappointment in cousin Edmunds burgeoning romance. How modern. Its also our first notion that shes in love with anyone. It would be a surprise to anyone who hasn't read the book.

But now we must come to the REAL reason cousin Tom is such a pain. While caring for him, Fanny stumbles across a book of his sketches filled with images of slavery, and Sir Thomas positioning a slaves head for oral pleasure. Ebert calls it a witty, entertaining film. About 5 minutes later Fanny catches Henry and her older cousin Maria naked in the sack and then she almost gets a wet one from Edmund.

Now its a race to the finish line as the family is scandalized by Maria running off with Henry Crawford, and Mary Crawford rather gauchely suggesting that Toms death might not be all bad if the inheritance were to come to Edmund, and Edmund, who somewhere along the line became a clergyman when we weren't looking, gives her the boot and quickly falls in love with Fanny. The End.

Its all in the book but here its done artlessly followed by a stupid epilogue.

Ebert also says, anyone who thinks it is not faithful to Austen doesn't know the author but only her plots. Actually the plot is ultimately faithful to Austen. Just crappy and slapdash in its presentation. Good thing I knew the plot.

My daughter warned me about this version. Shoulda listened. Misery of the acutest kind.

Let other pens dwell on guilt and misery. I quit such odious subjects as soon as I can, impatient to restore everybody, not greatly in fault themselves, to tolerable comfort, and to have done with all the rest.

Mansfield Park is not the best, but this version is the best I've seen & worth adding to any Jane Austen collection. Also recommend ""Austenland"" (comedy) with Kerri Russel if you love Jane Austen.",1405641600,,612,5.244897959183674

1093822,1,6305892806,"I really dislike this version as an adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. I understand (and agree) that Fanny Price is a tough character to show sympathetically in a film. But I feel that this adaptation didn't even try to work from Austen's written character and just recreated her as some modern-thinking, progressive feminist. That's not who Fanny is! In general, I felt like the filmmakers tried really hard to make their Mansfield Park racy, modern, and P.C.
But somewhere along the road, I felt they lost the heart of the novel. *Spoilers* Mansfield Park is about how the character (Fanny) with the purest heart, least worldly attractions, and the most long-suffering proves the glue that holds a home together and ultimately wins the hero's heart. Not by being witty, or spunky, or bright. But by being GOOD!",1402272000,,812,4.934306569343065

1094089,4,6305892806,"Enjoyable version of Mansfield Park.  The romanticized lives of Jane Austen characters once again brought to life on the big screen (in in the case of home, littler screen).  This version does have it's differences if you've seen the version with Billie Piper (2007).
This is the quintessential Miramax film of the 90's.
Young Fanny Price (the ""poor"" relative) is sent to live with her Aunt Mrs. Norris (a woman slightly snobbish for being a minister's wife) but as she arrives she's passed off to her mother's other sister Lady Bertram, a woman who is just as attached to her Pug as she is her morphine (or possibly Laudanum).
Even though not living in the same household Mrs. Norris finds it her business to always remind Fanny she's a burden on her relatives even going as far as not letting fanny have a fire in her room.  Lady Bertram has 4 children; Eldest son Tom, Edmond and two spoiled and vain daughters Maria and Julia.  Edmond is the only cousin to show Fanny a true kindness and help her with her education.
Franny gives us narration through the movie.  Some very funny.  Many in the tune of her writing her sister Susan.
Sir Thomas and Tom leave for the Antigua (The West Indies) for a year one to deal with issues at the plantation and hopes to straighten up Tom.  It only makes matters worse. Tom returns home early after some time drinking and gambling.
About the time of Franny's 18th year the household gets very wealthy, fashionable visitors siblings to the new parson's wife.  Henry and Mary Crawford.  Mary sets her sights on Tom since he is the eldest (she ends up meeting Edmond first since Tom was gone when they first arrived at Mansfield park) and heir to the families fortune but settles for Edmond even though she's disappointed he wants to be a clergymen.  She considers this dull and unfashionable.  She tries to convince Edmond that he should go into law or something a little less ""boring"".
Henry also makes a play for both of the sisters even though by now Maria is engaged to marry Mr. Rushworth a very rich young man.  Henry's affections toward both young ladies divides them apart and Maria starts to ignore Mr. Rushworth to show more affection to Mr. Crawford.  Fanny sits back and watches everything going on with very keen eyes and a new feeling that she didn't realize before.  She was becoming jealous of Edmond and Mary.
When Tom comes back home with his drinking and gambling companion they convince everyone they should through a play.  At first Edmond and Fanny protest that the idea would be something Sir Thomas would disapprove of but as time goes on Edmund caves in and takes a part in the play which has him playing the lover of the character Mary is playing.  Fanny continues to disapprove of the play and it's subject matter but she just sits back quietly and watches it all gone on around her like she's invisible.
Sir Thomas arrives home early and the play is then terminated.
Henry Crawford soon leaves leaving Maria heartbroken and even though she has no love for Mr. Rushworth she asks her father to allow her to marry in a fortnight.  They soon take off for their honeymoon and Maria takes Julia with her on her honeymoon to Brighton.
Fanny's improved appearance and gentle disposition endear her to Sir Thomas, who begins treating her a bit less distantly.  Mary Crawford Mary goes out of her way to befriend Fanny hoping it will endear her to Edmond and Sir Thomas.
Henry returns to Mansfield Park and decides to now set his sights on Franny.  This decision is mostly just to amuse himself.
Franny is harder to get affections out of then Henry ever expected and he tries all sorts of smooth moves including using his influence to get Franny's brother a commission as a naval lieutenant (this isn't really discussed in this movie compared to other versions).  Henry even proposes marriage but for the fact she watched everything he did to her two cousins she turns him down because she doesn't trust that he really loves her.  Sir Thomas is dumbfounded by Franny turning down such an advantageous marriage.  Sir Thomas believes Franny doesn't know her own feelings and persuades Henry to stay persistent.  To remind Franny of what her life could be like he sends her back home to her family in Portsmouth.  She's been away from home for about 8 years now and other then really enjoying seeing her younger sister who is now a beautiful young lady herself she really does discover the fear of living in filth and poverty and it starts to scare her.  Henry comes to Portsmouth and introduces himself to her family.  Attempts grand gestures to get Franny's attention and asks her again.  She accepts (possibly out of the fear of ending up as poor as her mother).  She wakes the next day to realize she's made a huge mistake and takes back her yes and an angry Henry storms off.  Soon Edmond shows up to bring Franny back to Mansfield Park as Tom has become deathly ill after basically drinking himself to a near death then being left my his ""friends"".  On the very long ride back to Mansfield some of those feelings between Franny and Edmond peak through.  The brush of a hand you can nearly sense the tension between the two.  Edmond falls asleep on Franny's chest as they ride together in the carriage through the night.  As Franny starts to actually get a sense of herself and the fact she is needed in this family she finally stands up to her mouthy and flippant aunt Mrs. Norris who is always putting Fanny down.  Henry and Mary come back to be near the family in their ""time of need"".
Franny hears a noise during the night and goes to check on Tom when she walks in on Henry and Maria in the throws of passion.  She is utterly stunned and Edmond coming to check on things goes into the room where Franny points to also discover his married sister in bed with a man other then her husband.
Stunned he to walks away.
The next morning bright and early Mr. Rushworth comes barging in with a ""newspaper"" man in the area to interview Mr. Rushworth on his new gardens.  Mr. Rushworth bounding through the house asking where everyone is and asking where his wife is is told she must be at the cottage (he states he already stopped there).  Continuing to look for Maria, Mr. Rushworth opens a door to discover an empty disheveled bed with two wine glasses on the floor.  He knows right away what has happened.  Maria runs off with Henry but is soon without a husband or a lover (he doesn't ask her to marry him).  Tom still ill the family is at it's wits end with how to handle everything and also deal with the embarrassment of Maria's affair and divorce.
Mary soon speaks up with her idea's how Sir Thomas should handle everything.  The family is so aghast with her blatant disregard for Tom's life and ease of dismissing Sir Thomas that Edmond finally stands up to her and tells her he doesn't know her and wants nothing further to do with her.  She slinks off.  Sir Thomas finally sees Franny's true value and self-worth and finally sees the fact that Edmond and Franny are in love.  The family is happy with the attachment at last.  Tom starts to slowly recover.  Franny's younger sister Susan comes to live at Mansfield Park and starts to become educated as Franny once was.  This time she's taken under Julia's wing.  We get a lovely narration at the end of the families current goings on...Maria and Aunt Norris' always makes me chuckle.",1399939200,,7398,4.564723694171082

1094376,5,6305892806,"As others have pointed out, this is far from a faithful adaptation of Austen's novel. Anyone looking for the character of Fanny Price will look in vain; the more recent version starring Billie Piper does a far better job of retelling the original tale.

That said, this movie deserves praise for its own unique merits, and some of the revisionist take on the story is inspired. Although this Fanny is much more in the witty, creative model of Jane Austen herself instead of the shy, virtuous original, she is nonetheless an appealing heroine, and Frances O'Connor gives an excellent performance. I also greatly appreciate the more in-depth consideration of what it means for the family wealth to come from slavery, which introduces a far darker tone, but an honest one; furthermore, it allows for a sympathetic and plausible characterization for Tom.

The cinematography is lovely, the wit razor-sharp and Jonny Lee Miller is marvelous (though his best performance as an Austen hero was, in my opinion, as Mr. Knightley in the Romola Garai ""Emma."")

To even say that the Fanny Price in this film represents the true character of Jane Austen is an absurdity. You get to know Jane Austen through reading her novels not watching films made from her books. Fanny is one of Austen's most complex heroines and Francis O'Conner did in no way captured Fanny or Jane Austen as the character of both was way off the mark in this film. A true Jane Austen fan wants a movie that has fidelity to the novel and can properly depict the characters. No one has yet to capture Fanny's character in all its complexity. That challenge is still out there for a brave writer, director and producer. You can't improve Jane Austen you can only properly write a screen rendition and choose the actors who can get inside the characters and play them properly.",1395446400,3,968,4.505681818181818

Some people found the odd bits of humor included in the movie nice, but with the lack of character development leaving you ""not knowing"" the characters, I found the humor tidbits distracting and confusing.

  The heroine of this story, Fanny Price, periodically speaks directly to the camera and the performers occasionally freeze their poses to emphasize statements made by Fanny's voice-over.  Although, these director's choices can be annoying, they are not insurmountable.
  Furthermore, if you are looking for a production that exactly reflects the story as written by Austin, this might be disappointing.  The subplot concerning Fanny's brother doesn't appear in the movie, which effects the texture of her relationship with the Crawfords.  Nevertheless, I found the additions and changes interesting, incorporating and reflecting some of the events and values of Austin's life.

Reflecting the Georgian ethics of her time, she nonetheless challenges the expectations of her century, but also the expectations of her modern readers. This is a film about rags to riches, about love and destiny, and about how ""what goes around, comes around."" Mansfield Park is a large manor that hides secrets. It is a place where the concept of ""family"" is stretched and twisted for some time. You get a feel for the era, but you also find in the words of the characters the feelings and thoughts of Jane Austen...she shines even through the screen play. There are several relationships that you will need to keep clear and navigate through, while finding yourself most involved with Frances O'Conner's character. So who are the bad guys and who are the good guys? It's not that easy. We see people being themselves, and even over the centuries, we still know these people...just look around.

1095537,1,6305892806,"Let me first admit that there are very few renditions of Mansfield Park that I think do justice to the highly difficult character of Fanny Price.  While she is likely more appealing to modern audiences in this rendition, it does not capture either her tremulously self-effacing shyness and deep modesty, or her strength of character.  One of the great paradoxes of Fanny is that she is both extraordinarily willing to sacrifice her own desires and inclinations to the demands of her family, and yet in the two great episodes in the book she can remain true to her guiding principles which are neither understood nor even acknowledged by this family.  That such a shy, retiring, feeling young girl could stand strong in the face of such opposition is something very hard to capture on screen and that is utterly failed of by Frances O'Connor.

In addition to this fatal flaw, the movie includes far too much gratuitous sensuality.  There is a very creepy scene between Fanny and Mary Crawford, where Miss Crawford takes indecent liberties when she is ""acting"" her part in Lover's Vows with Fanny to read her lover's lines.  Also, one gets a flash of Mariah in bed with Henry Crawford, and there is unabashed frontal nudity.

The last part of the movie that is hard for a Jane Austen aficionado to bear is the total want of propriety displayed by some of the characters.  Tom Bertram, while opposing his father's wishes, would never have shown something so graphic as those drawing to Fanny (which scene, by the way, is an entirely modern interposition of racial inequity practiced by Sir Thomas in Antigua; there were never such things alluded in the novel).  Mary Crawford, while harboring all the despicable sentiments she voices in the closing scene where Edmund throws her off, would never have voiced them even to Edmund, let alone in a conference in front of the whole family.  While she had no particular regard or respect for Sir Thomas, she certainly had enough propriety to refrain from that manner of affront to someone of such rank.

In short, the writers seem to wish only to ""update"" rather than faithfully present Miss Austen's story, and in doing so have lost the sense of the characters and the time.",1388102400,3,2216,4.79002624671916
1095641,4,6305892806,"I enjoyed this movie, though if you are a Jane Austen purist you might be disappointed.  I have enjoyed other films based upon her writing, but for me, this was such a refreshing change, as it was much lighter in spirit  That may not help you, but I can't think of a better way to describe it.  It doesn't have nearly as much angst and pain and, in the instance of Persuasion, as much self-sacrifice. Sometimes enough of that is enough!

I thought the acting was fine, and especially liked the lead - she seemed to play this role with just lightness without coming across as being flip.  Her character isn't shallow, though others around her are.

The sets are lovely, but I'd say that aren't comparable to the lush beauty and detail found in Downton Abbey,  Then again, what is?  Ditto the quality of the photography.  Maybe that comment would concern editing and lighting more than the actual photography, and had I not seen Downton and other shows/films of that caliber, I would've thought the sets were gorgeous.  I've been spoiled, what can I say....

I wouldn't buy the DVD but then I rarely do, and only for movies/shows that I really, really love.

1095872,2,6305892806,"If this was a movie independent of the Jane Austen title, I would have appreciated it more.  The movie is not bad; actually it is rather sweet.  The problem is that this is not Mansfield Park.  The quiet Fanny Park is nonexistent in the outspoken opinionated Fanny of this film.  Edmund is unaware of his feelings for Fanny the majority of the book, but in this movie his love is present from the beginning.  The largest change is the inclusion of slavery.  It is a topic that should never be forgotten, but is not even mentioned in Austen's novel.  Furthermore, I found the addition of slavery was only there to support the outspoken nature of Fanny.  Its inclusion didn't add to the film nor introduce an intriguing/new thought about the topic.  There are more inconsistencies, but these are the three that stand out most.

  If you have read and love the book, I would be cautious in choosing to watch this film. It takes far too many liberties with the story for those who expect a recreation on screen.  If you are up for something similar to an alternate reality version of Mansfield Park, then it might appeal to you.  If you haven't read the story, then I would go ahead and watch.

Her stoke of good luck. Sending their eldest daughter away was the opportunity for the young girl to not only become less of a burden on her family but altered her entire life forever.  It was an entrance into a better life of many more privileges than she would ever have had this not happened.

Perhaps Jane Austen was making a statement about how rare it is for someone's fortune to change so completely. Dickens orphans always met with strife, cruelty and horrible circumstances before much later in their lives being released from their bondage.

1096250,4,6305892806,"This novel provides the usual pleasures of reading Jane Austen: Elegant and incisive prose. I took particular pleasure in her long sentences, often with more than one dependent clause, and even dependent clauses within dependent clauses, which remain lucid and thus articulate the relationship between ideas. A plot that is the usual question of finding a husband for the heroine and for other important female characters, threaded among complex circles character conflict and family and class relationships. Leading characters that are thoroughly realized human beings. Jane Austen tends to keep her distance from her characters -; she presents them a little bit as if they were in a painting we all admire. This distance is more striking in this novel than in, say, Pride and Prejudice. Austin does not like all these people she has created, and freely spends the sharpness of her wit upon them.

The pater familias of this novel is Sir Thomas Bertram, baronet. His wife, Lady Bertram, is a woman so indolent as to be almost inanimate. Her younger sister had married below her class and had several children by a drunken sailor. The baronet takes one of these daughters into his household at age 8, the protagonist, Fanny Price. Lady Bertram has another sister who is part of the household by virtue of being married to the clergyman annexed to the baronet's estate, Mrs. Norris. Aunt Norris is not exactly a villainess, but she is so self-centered, self-deceiving, and power-hungry that she harms the lives of everyone around her especially Fanny. She never lets Fanny forget she is a poor relation although, or because, Mrs. Norris is in a similar position.

Two issues interested me in this rereading of the novel: the limitations of Fanny as a heroine, and telling rather than showing.

Fanny is no Elizabeth Bennett. Though she is smart and eventually grows up pretty, Fanny is a problematic because she is a boring little prig. I have heard her compared to the treacle-sweet heroine of Bleak House. There is considerable tension in this novel between what we might see as moderate sexual license versus an attitude of intense and fearful defense of an appearance of chastity and fidelity. All this in an society where the threat of scandal could quickly ruin a woman's life. For example, while the baronet is away tending to his estates in Antigua, the young people stage a somewhat flirtatious and suggestive theatrical. Fanny is stubbornly opposed to such goings-on, which earns her points with a clergyman cousin who is a potential suitor and with her uncle when he returns. But does it earn points with the author or the reader?

To put this in context, note that Jane Austen's family frequently put on theatricals, usually restoration comedies, when she was growing up in which she almost certainly performed. Bear in mind also the recent republication of Austin's early novel Lady Susan, in which the heroine is a sexual predator, and that Jane Austen's aunt almost certainly derived what little financial security she enjoyed from being the mistress of Warren Hastings.

Fanny has integrity, intelligence, and stubbornness and sticks to her guns when various family members put pressure on her to marry a man whom she perceives to be wrong for her. She also passingly brings up the morality of the slave trade with her uncle, albeit inconclusively. As far as I know that is the only mention of the slavery, a live issue at the time, in Austin's work.

In creative writing classes and stereotyped advice to writers you often hear the formula, ""show don't tell."" I note with interest that the final three chapters of Mansfield Park, which very successfully tie up numerous plot lines and consummate or foresee various marriages, are entirely told. Of course, we know all the characters pretty well by then so we don't need ""showing"" as an exposition of character. But still, it is a resounding example contrary to the ""show don't tell"" formula.",1383523200,,3957,4.96078431372549

1096256,3,6305892806,"OVERVIEW:  Loosely based on Jane Austen's novel, ""Mansfield Park,"" the 1999 film of the same name is a dramatic romantic-comedy directed and co-written by Patricia Rozema.  Despite the movie's considerable deviations from Austen's novel, it debuted with mostly favorable reception; ""Mansfield Park"" holds ratings of 76% and 71% from Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic, respectively.  As a fan of Jane Austen novels and their on-screen adaptations, I can say that I was initially disappointed to learn of the liberties taken by this screenplay; however, once I considered the number of films adapted from the original ""Mansfield Park"" novel, I began to appreciate the necessity of Rozema's plot and character changes.  Taken as a film and separate from the novel, I believe this is a fantastically written and acted screenplay--in this sense, I feel Rozema has successfully embodied the wit and emotional torment that underlies Austen's original plot, and far better so than is seen with other film versions of this novel--which may, after all, be the best way to pay homage to the influential writing of the great Jane Austen.

SPECIAL FEATURES:  (1-disc / PG-13 / Released 7-11-00 / 112 min. run-time)  includes Audio Commentary and Making Of ""Mansfield Park.""

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BOOK AND FILM:  An entertaining and intelligent film all-its-own, I think it's fair to note a few of the differences between ""Mansfield Park"" `the novel' and `the 1999 film' for prospective viewers.  The first variation occurs with the prominence of slavery as a theme; the issue, lightly touched upon in the book, gains a central role in the film.  Throughout the movie, Fanny's status as a poor female is compared to that of a slave, yet contrast occurs between their respective treatments.  Secondly, the film version incorporates events from the life of the real Jane Austen (in lieu of those about which she wrote), exemplified by the film's portrayal of Fanny's initial acceptance to Henry's proposal, which she later recants.  In addition, Fanny Price's character undergoes several fundamental changes, most noticeably that she is written as a much stronger person in the film version.  Most of the lesser variations can be summarized as changes to characters, timelines, and plot focus.

STARRING ROLES include:  Frances O'Connor as Fanny Price/Bertram, Alessandro Nevola as Henry Crawford, Harold Pinter as Sir Thomas Bertram, Lindsay Duncan as Lady Bertram/Mrs. Price, James Purefoy as Tom Bertram, Hugh Bonneville as Mr. Rushworth, Jonny Lee Miller as Edmund Bertram, Victoria Hamilton as Maria Bertram, Embeth Davidtz as Mary Crawford, Justine Waddell as Julia Bertram, Sophia Myles as Susan Price, Sheila Gish as Mrs. Norris, Hilton McRae as Mr. Price, Anna Popplewell as Betsey, and Hannah Taylor-Gordon as young Fanny Price.

SUMMARY:  Mrs. Price (sister of Lady Bertram and Mrs. Norris) married Mr. Price for love, not money.  The Price family's financial struggles are eased when their 10-year-old daughter, Fanny, is sent to live with her mother's wealthy relatives, the Bertrams, at Mansfield Park.  Aside from Edmund Bertram, one of her cousins, Fanny is treated more like a household servant than a family member.  Knowing she cannot return home to her own family, Fanny feels trapped, which often elicits comparison between Fanny and the numerous Bertram slaves to whom the family owes its wealth.

Eight years later, the issue of slavery comes under fire.  Fear the financial toll that abolition poses for the Bertram family, Sir Thomas and his son, Tom, make a trip to Antigua to see a stop to any rebellions.  During their absence, the young and worldly siblings, Henry and Mary Crawford, pay a visit to Mansfield Park.  Even though she is engaged to Mr. Rushworth, Maria salaciously competes with her sister, Julie, for Henry's attention; because Edmund focuses his attention on Mary, Fanny feels unwanted.

Upon his return to Mansfield Park, Tom is accompanied by a friend, Mr. Yates; together, the two young men insist on conducting a reenactment of the play ""Lovers' Vows,"" a welcomed excuse for the Bertrams and Crawfords to flirt with one another.  Just as Maria `pretends' to seduce Henry, Sir Thomas returns home and quickly puts a stop to the play.  Shortly thereafter, Maria weds Mr. Rushworth; she and Julia move to Brighton.  Henry, now bored at the loss of Maria's attention, sets his sights on Fanny (who does not return his favor).  Much to his surprise, Henry develops deep feelings for Fanny, leading to his request for Fanny's hand in marriage.  Repulsed by Henry's previous treatment of the Bertram girls, Fanny refuses the proposal.  Angered by the rejection of what he deems to be a ""generous"" offer, Sir Thomas sends Fanny back to live with the Price family.

Soon after Fanny's return home, Henry pays a visit to the Price family in hopes that he might convince Fanny to reconsider his proposal.  When Fanny receives a letter from Edmund, notifying her of his intentions with Mary, Fanny becomes open to ""settling"" for Henry--she quickly regains her senses and, once again, denies his offer.

Meanwhile, at Mansfield Park, Tom has fallen ill and requires Fanny's tender caretaking.  Edmond retrieves Fanny; on their way back to the Bertram home, tension between the two exposes their mutual feelings for one another.  Julia and the now-married Maria Rushworth return shortly thereafter.  When Fanny and Edmund discover Maria and Henry's affair, the two grow even closer, almost tempting Edmund to forsake his affections for Mary.  Once news of the adultery breaks, Mary attempts to patch the shame by suggesting Maria and Henry wed.  Fanny questions how the Crawfords can afford two weddings, leading Mary to give a cold-hearted response concerning the fortune Edmund will inherit upon Tom's death.  Edmund is disgusted by Mary's true intentions and denounces his attachment to Mary.... [The film ends with all loose ends tied up into a neat little bow].",1382918400,,5981,5.175675675675675

1096996,1,6305892806,"What a piece of trash. The writer or writers twisted her words to make ""Mansfield Park"" into a sordid R-rated soap opera. Naked bodies caught in the act in a bedroom, the father (can't remember names) a respectable gentleman became a leering dirty-old-man with sweaty forehead who used and owned slaves in Antigua. Fanny brought his opium addicted wife her daily potion of dope that put her into a bleary-eyed daze. Brother William was left out entirely and sweet little Fanny Price became a feisty in-you-face 20th-century feminist. Kind religious Edmund made excuses for his father using and owning slaves. The English love to distain Hollywood and these writers and producers and director have become what they ridicule, only worse. They should be ashamed of themselves, on a par with- Americans burning the flag.

I read an article in the 1950's about Vladimir Nabokov the author of ""Lolita"" who was from Poland and became a professor of English Literature in one of the Ivy League Women's colleges. He said he considered Jane Austen to be the best writer of English fiction he had ever read. How could he have imagined that ""Mansfield Park"" would be changed in character to resemble something he would have written himself.

1096997,1,6305892806,"What an absolute, sick piece of trash.  If Jane Austen had known this movie would be made, she would have burned her manuscript.

I'm a big girl.  I can deal with the fact that many movie characters behave very differently from the way they are depicted in books, and that compromises are often made to move a story along but BABY! First off, the nuance of the awful Aunt Norris -  a woman who is a manipulative, self-satisfied, mean and fascinating study in behavior & who shapes and molds the needy little Fanny - was just totally skipped.  It's just some disinterested and snotty Aunt. ""Oh well,"" I thought. ""I know how she really is.  Move on.""

Then the sad, shy, sickly little Fanny that we met in the book shows up in the movie a tough, confident, story writing chick  - and I thought, ""Wait.  Why did the director turn this into Little Women?  This chick is Jo!""  Except Jo never mouthed off to her elders.

Then we meet the new neighbors - and instead of sexual tension and flirtation between the boys and the girls, there is touching and caressing in a totally seductive way perpetrated by the female neighbor on Fanny. Who, as a tough girl, should have slapped her hands away and said, ""I can towel my breasts off by myself. Back off.""  Because of who these people are and their important relationship, that kind of behavior shouldn't have even been suggested.

Oh, but that's not all... turns out the Uncle has raped and tortured slaves while on his trip to Antigua.  And the way we find out?  Fanny finds (and we are treated to the scenes of) horrible, sick graphic pen and ink drawings that her cousin made of his father and the women and men as he violated them!  WHAAATTT?

At this point, my blood pressure was ramped up and I was angrily wondering why anybody would ruin a lovely, old fashioned, beloved Jane Austen story with implied lesbianism, rape and torture, when...

Fanny walks in on the guy who 'loves her' having bouncy, gasping sex with her married cousin Maria. Of course, the director has ruined the story already, so we can't just let them run off together like the boring old book. Nope. We get to witness bouncy breasts and loins and hear their ""passionate"" grunts and gasps.  Ugh.

At that point I turned the movie off.  Maybe if I'd stuck with it, I would have found out that the whole thing was one of  Steven King's bad dreams.

Johnny Lee Miller is fantastic in this adaptation and the inclusion of the moral conflict the family has with their ""holdings' in Antigua are awesome elucidation of what the financial issues the Bertram's have.  It never occurred to me when I was reading the story, got caught up in the romance.

1097104,1,6305892806,"I am not a screenwriter so i may not completely understand or fully appreciate the challenges writers face when adapting a classic like Mansfield Park to the big screen. When the allotted time 112 minutes, the writer has the delicate task of making the story more concise, and walking the fine line between  maintaining the character of the novel and  preserving the author's plot line.  I expect a bit of embellishment, a few subtle changes and perhaps a new character or two. Had i not read the book, i would have enjoyed this version thoroughly......unfortunately, i decided to watch this movie after i finished reading the book. As I watched the movie, i realized that i  could not relate what i was watching to what i had just read. The characters bear the same names as those in the book, but that is where the resemblance  ends. The film alters major elements of the story to make room for Austen's private letters which had nothing to do with the story or the book. Jane Austen has been criticized for her apathy towards slavery so to address this question, the producers decided to add a sub-plot to make sure that the viewer understood that Jane Austen abhorred slavery. Missing also  is Austen's satirical social commentary. If you are an Austen purist, you will hate this one....i will stick with BBC or A&E productions when it comes to beloved classics.",1378598400,9,1366,4.718487394957983

Neither my wife nor I have read the book so we were able to enjoy the story as-is.  My wife wanted to watch it again the next night - something she's never done in the past 30 years.  So 4.5 stars for the movie itself.

It was fun to see Blake Ritson (Edmund Bertram) from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ken-Follett-s-World-Without-End-Blu-ray/dp/B0099116J0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ken Follett's World Without End [Blu-ray</a>] in a more-likable role, and to see Hayley Atwell (Mary Crawford) from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ken-Follett-s-The-Pillars-of-the-Earth-Blu-ray/dp/B00429MLT8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ken Follett's The Pillars of the Earth [Blu-ray</a>].  (Those two movies were altered beyond belief; because of them, I decided that watching Mansfield Park BEFORE reading it would give me the best chance to enjoy both movie and book.)

I don't have enough interest to be a blu-ray connoisseur but this one has a problem that even I noticed.  In the dark scenes (usually indoors), it's as if the movie was digitized with only 16 bits of color: subtle tones in the actors' faces seem to be rounded up or down to the same color.  People old enough to remember when PC graphics cards were relatively new might remember how a picture of the ocean, for example, might contain only five different shades of blue and would look blotchy: a large patch of one blue dissolving into a large patch of a noticably different blue, and then dissolving into a large patch of another blue, etc.  This is how the actors' faces looked and it took me out of the movie several times.  Perhaps my copy is from a bad batch; I'll watch to see if others note this problem before exchanging mine.

With or without flaws though, I daresay we'll enjoy watching this movie quite a few more times.",1378512000,4,1945,5.45

1097109,1,6305892806,"Others have commented on just how greatly this deviates from Austen's 'Mansfield'. 'Mansfield Park' may be the most difficult of Austen's novels to adapt, but Rozema did not adapt it so much as hijack it as a pro-feminist, anti-slavery rant in Regency costume. Rozema indeed deviates by making deviates of several characters: Sir Thomas is a sadistic bully who verbally abuses Fanny and rapes his slaves, Lady Bertram is an opium addict,  and Mary Crawford borders on being a sexual predator who has no moral compass. Rozema's 'Fanny Price' is exactly the opposite of Austen's 'Fanny', and not in any way that improves upon JA's. Rozema's 'Fanny' is arrogant, smug,condescending, judgmental and more than a little conniving. Many have said JA's 'Fanny' is her most difficult character to like; I found Rozema's impossible to like. Hardest to stomach after the politicization is Fanny's contempt for her birth family during her enforced 'visit' to Portmouth. She looks down her nose at their struggle and poverty, and exudes an air of ""I'm just soooo above all this.""

Why watch it at all? The cinematography is lush and the costuming lovely. I watch this Henry Crawford and could believe he might just really love Fanny, not this Fanny but JA's Fanny.  Jonny Lee Miller's 'Edmund' is my favorite among 'Mansfield' adaptations, and in Frances Price (Fanny's mother) you see the beautiful woman who married for love and now regrets that childish decision. Unfortunately none of that helps 'Mansfield' rise above it's shortcomings as an adaptation.

As a period piece 'Mansfield Park' has a certain attraction, and can stand on its own rather well. It simply has little merit as an Austen adaptation.",1376870400,34,1697,5.07168458781362

The inclusion of the slave aspect was insufficient to do anything but cause us horror; Sir Thomas' repentance at the end was given little fathomable motivation... simple emotion, which is not lasting and not satisfactory.  Shoe-horning the whole story into a couple of hours resulted in losing the motivations for most of the characters' choices, giving us a story, but no plot.

Her love for Edmond has to be an example of patient desire even in spite of the attractions of Mary Crawford and the dastardly plans of Henry Crawford in securing her favor.  Austen's characters exhibit the many forms of human nature and she describes them to a ""T"" especially in this story.

The first part of the movie is so depressing that you just want to turn it off and go on to something more digestible.  After she goes to Mansfield Park it gets a lot more interesting and seems to progress nicely from there. Although this Fanny may not be exactly what Jane Austen presented I like her very much. All the characters are attractive. Even the man that Fannie refuses after leading around by the nose for a while seems to not be such a bad fellow - just unable to resist temptation after being disappointed in love. Question?  If he had been accepted by Fannie and was married to her would his behavior have been any different - probably not. The unbelievable part is that Fanny goes back to her horrible home and seems very content there - impossible and unbelievable. She only goes back to Mansfield Park when summoned.  Question? Is the father(Edward's father) a lecher who longs to get his own hands on Fanny? He seems to be two absolutely different people - confusing but interesting. Is Miss Crawford entirely too helpful to Fanny removing her wet clothing? There are several twists and turns in the story that keep one interested. I recommend it as a ""movie"" not necessarily a good adaptation of the Jane Austen story. The most moving thing in the whole movie is when Fanny's mother says ""I married for love"" and leaves Fanny to realize how badly that turned out which may influence her own decision.

1097770,3,6305892806,"Jane Austen's novel ""Mansfield Park"" emphasizes the interplay of character, with some criticism of ""society"" along the way. Adapting this for the screen requires the length of a mini-series, allowing the characters to be developed and their crises to unfold in full.

Alas, this adaptation is film length.  Things must be cut.  The movie feels as if the screenwriters forgot to cut things until halfway through, at which point the story rushes far too much.  Events get compressed to occur at the same time, even in the same room. The movie ends with insipid voiceovers just this side of ""they all lived happily ever after.""

More troublesome to many, the screenwriters decided to *add* things. There's a strong political critique of slavery and the slave trade, a critique of how society women are similarly ""bought and sold,"" and a case for the strengths of feminist literature. Quiet Fanny Price transmogrifies from silent observer to feminist hero, standing up to patriarchy and learning to exercise a sharp tongue. These are modern concerns, not Jane Austen's. I'm not averse to this kind of modernizing in principle, especially since literary critics of the novel have explored these themes.  It's weird to see the criticisms be absorbed into the plot, however, as if Jane Austen came back to life and decided, ""My critics are right, I needed to explore those issues more fully.""

With few exceptions, the acting excels. A special call-out to the late Harold Pinter, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, who plays the patriarch Lord Bertram in the most substantial screen role of his career. Unfortunately, Pinter and the other actors are not given the time to explore their characters fully because the plot must charge along to finish in time. It probably would have been wise to delete a few characters entirely.

That headlong rush ultimately makes the film unsatisfying. I don't mind modern adaptations, even if they do some violence to the author's original intent - they become the screenwriters' vision, which we can consider on its own terms. But such things still require that you take the time to do things right, or make some tougher decisions about what to eliminate.",1363996800,,2190,4.997252747252747

1097774,1,6305892806,"After I watched this movie I bought the book because this USA version of movie didn't fit with my concept of Jane Austen's novels in style or topics. She didn't deal with politic and only mentioned the plight of women in her  time in passing. When I read the book I was right the novel was set in 18th century England, Fanny Price the daughter of a poor sister was sent to live with her aunt & uncle Sir Thomas & Lady Bertram at Mansfield Park. There she was educated & brought up to be a ladies maid/companion to her Aunt who had 2 daughters & sons near Fanny's age. She was mild mannered & shy, intelligent but reserved & lived in the shadows of her husband hunting cousins. The book did mention her uncle & cousin, Tom Bertram, going off to the Indies but it didn't say if it was he West or East Indies. The novel never discussed politic of the day or slavery. Also while Fanny was relative she didn't have the same rights & privileges or flights of fancy as her cousins. Fanny would never have contradicted anything her uncle said or been involved in a discussions, let alone about politics. It simply wasn't done, not even Lady Bertram or her female cousins would have read about or been involved in political discussions in 18th century England. The only time Fanny refused to follow her uncles wishes was concerning accepting Henry Crawford's marriage proposal. Her refusal without explanation got her sent back to her parents as a reminder of where she came from, until she was needed again at Mansfield Park.
Mansfield Park the book is an 18th century love story between classes. This movie tries to make Fanny Price a late 19th century loud mouth American suffragette without class or reserve. Aside from the setting & the character's names it has little semblance to the novel. To me if you are going to make a movie using a book title and author as the movie title, the book should be recognizable in the movie.  The USA movie version of Mansfield Park does an injustice to Jane Austen and fans of her novels.
If you like Jane Austen novels I'd skip this movie and opt for one produced by the BBC. All of the BBC Jane Austen movies seem to be a more accurate representation of the novels.

Instead,it is a brilliant, creative amalgamation in which the priggish Fanny Price is turned into a lively hybrid - part Fanny Price (the preternaturally astute, but quite dull, judge of character) and part Jane Austen herself, as we know her from her letters. Austen was a sharp tongued genius, who loved only a few people, and thought well of even less - her words, not mine. She was an acute observer of people and had no illusions about human nature. Working on her ""two inches of ivory"" she created a panorama of personalities and had no compunctions about showing the seamy side of human nature.
Patricia Rozema, the writer/director, has produced a wonderful, lively script, and has a superb cast to carry it out.

There was too much profanity, too much sexuality, and definitely too much brutality to slaves as depicted in supposed drawings by Tom while he visited the West Indies.

There was no hint that audiences were about to view explicit sexually violent drawings of the slaves, and my 83 year old mother had never seen anything like it. She and I both were offended.

1098417,3,6305892806,"I've never read the book Mansfield Park so I can't really attest to the accuracy, but as a stand-alone Period Piece, I was less than impressed. I live for these kinds of films. For me, there is no greater perfection than Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility. I'm a big Jane Austen fan, but I just haven't gotten around to reading this particular novel of hers. However, I am just going to assume, that it was no way as risqu as this film! There are a few scenes here that left me bewildered and sort of stunned. Lewd stares and leers, artisitic depictions of rape and abuse, and a creepy uncle/niece vibe that I just couldn't shake.

So the story goes: A 10 year old, very poor girl named Fanny was somehow chosen to live with her incredibly wealthy relatives at Mansfield Park. She believes it is only temporary but she remains there for years, growing up, and doing...well, I'm not sure exactly what her role is supposed to be in the new household. Here is where I started losing interest, and it was only 10 minutes into the film... Is Fanny supposed to be a servant or helper? A ward? For someone who was brought up in such a poverty-stricken environment, she is incredibly bright and learned. Now obviously it appears her education was continued at the Park, but these are all assumptions. In once scene she is seen serving her aunts, and in another she is galloping away on a horse with Edmund, her Uncle's youngest son. She is clearly enjoying her time and life there. She writes(alot), horses around, and is usually in good-spirits. And then in another scene she is being dismissed by her aunt like a servant. It's somewhat confusing.

Frances O' Conner as Fanny is a decent choice, but a bit too old in my opinion. She is not entirely likable either. Her relationship with Edmund seems sincere and sweet, but then at other times she just seems out of character. She accepts and then(the next morning) rejects a proposal from a handsome, wealthy man for reasons she is only guessing at. She deems him untrustworthy and false, but she doesn't mind flirting with him regardless. Oh, and she practically throws herself at him when she first agrees to his proposal, sealing it with a brow-raising kiss.

I think the thing that really threw me off this film is, it just doesn't feel like a Jane Austen adaptation. The way the characters act and speak just feels innapropriate for the time period and just wrong for Austen. There are nice, bright moments here though that can't be denied, and once you get past the icky fact that Fanny and Edmund are (first) cousins, their relationship feels genuine and heart-felt.

Besides plot and characters, I love looking at all the different costumes that usually come with any period piece. Once again I was dissapointed. Nothing seemed up to par and frankly, everything was just kind of boring. This is one film that is practially SCREAMING for a remake. It's time for a fresh start because I really think great things can be done with the proper director and actors.",1351814400,,3007,4.6360225140712945

The novel has wonderful morals and ideals throughout it and unfortunately the director decided to cut it all out and turn it into crap.

That said, this might have been easier if it were written and not so in-your-face- visual with these liberties (money from the sugar plantations, upstairs/downstairs with servents, bundling together to sleep and, of course, men can sleep with whomever they like would all be touched on). I'm of the mind that even a touch of Austen can only improve and deepen something (i.e. Clueless) and this film takes this and moves in the right direction.

1098594,5,6305892806,"Complain, complain, complain:  Many people complain that this movie does NOT capture Fanny Price.  What they don't get is: this movie IN ALL WAYS captures Jane Austen at her acerbic best.  Rozema has given Fanny all the pointed commentary that in the book is voiced by Austen, in her role as narrator, or by another character ( ""marriage is a maneuvering business"", voiced in the movie by Fanny, in the book by Mary Crawford).

And Rozema has the religious background to depict Austen's attitudes towards adultery correctly:  AS A SIN.  AS AN EVIL. This is  made quite clear in the books last chapters, especially Edmund's description of his last interview with Mary Crawford.  Austen - and Edmund and  Fanny - do not share Mary Crawford's  more contemporary, modern attitude - that this may be folly, but it is not 'evil'.

While the slavery issue is not as explicit in Austen, political events never are, but they always form a background.  The 'Militia' in P&P, the 'Naval Officers' in Persuasion.

Here we have slavery obliquely mentioned in the text, Antigua explicitly mentioned.  It was widely known that Antigua grew sugar cane with slave labor, exported refined sugar to England. Indeed, there was no other industry.  Her brother, Frank, in the Navy, visited Antigua and deplored the conditions of the slaves in 1806, her father George Austen acted as a trustee for an estate ( a sugar plantation) in Antigua ( he was deceased at the time the book was written in 1813), the first slave revolt in Santa Domingo was in 1801, and in 1807 the British Parliament made trading in slaves a FELONY for any British subject, anywhere in the world.

While Rozema has expanded this storyline, it is inaccurate to whine that slavery is not mentioned in the text:  The only way you can get there is read the book with your eyes closed and in ignorance of a dozen years of crucial British history.

Finally, the performances in this movie are stunning:  Francis O'Connor as Fanny!!
Harold Pinter as Sir Thomas.  Embeth Davidtz, etc. etc.  Extremely strong cast.

1098596,3,6305892806,"It has been thirteen years since this adaptation of Jane Austen's novel MANSFIELD PARK was made and while it may not be the most successful of the renderings of the Austen story it continues to entertain, primarily because of the rather top-notch cast.  Patricia Rozema adapted the novel for the screen an din addition to supplying the dialogue and sequencing she also directed - and that is where the gap between true Austen sensibility and interpretation seems to meander.

The story is well known, but a capsule synopsis may help underline the attributes of this version. Young Fanny Price (Hannah Taylor- Gordon) is a poor relative who is sent to live with Sir Thomas Bertram (the now deceased Harold Pinter), the husband of her aunt. She is a typical Austen female - wise, clever, a fine writer - and bonds with Sir Thomas' youngest son Edmund (Philip Sarson). As the children move toward adulthood Fanny (now Frances O'Connor) gains beauty and is the ideal for a neighbor Henry Crawford (Alessandro Nivola). Sir Thomas promotes the match only to find that Fanny is a liberated woman with a mind of her own: Fanny, not wanting to be a passive girl, makes Henry prove himself a proper suitor. The mature Edmund (Jonny Lee Miller) is taken with Henry's sister (Embeth Davis).  The concept of New World slavery enters as the characters discover that Sir Thomas is financially involved with that trade and Sir Thomas's son Tom (James Purefoy) is obsessed with the concept. Of course, twists and turns abound and characters' true selves are revealed and the ending is a typical `all's well that end's well' dynamic.

The cast is large with some of the other roles well enacted by Victoria Hamilton, Hugh Bonneville, Justine Waddell, Shelia Gish, Amelia Warner and others. A fine cast, beautifully costumed, well photographed, but somehow it just doesn't seem like pure Jane Austen. Grady Harp, January 12",1325980800,,1904,4.922118380062305

I understand that some changes need to be made when transferring literature to the screen, but this was ludicrous.  Fanny Price is portrayed so far from the demure, quiet, undiscovered youth that she is hardly recognizable.  Just seeing her expression on the cover tells this is a newly created character bearing a very familiar name.  Liberties are taken with other characters as well.

There is absolutely no way that a 90 minute or so movie is going to be exactly like the book.  No way.  This is thoroughly charming movie, with characters I recognize, brought to life by actors who resonate with those Austen wrote about, with the only exception of Mrs. Norris, who should have been a skinny, grayish shrew.  My only beef is perhaps with the whole West Indies incident, but it does not jar with the story as portrayed.  Believe me, the opium situation is a great explanation for the completely insipid Lady Bertram, and the sexuality of the movie is completely in keeping with the implied scandal leading to Maria Bertram's fall from grace.  Fanny is drawn as a young woman with strong convictions, who is played much more vocally than in the book, but Fanny was adamant in her unwillingness to sacrifice her principals in any degree, so a forte performance in a movie seems to be a much better choice than implied suffering, in my opinion.  Frances O'Connor was an inspired choice for Fanny: lovely, but not too beautiful; eyes full of personality; and a sort of suppressed sexuality that has to be present for Henry Crawford to be at all attracted to.

On its own, it's a good enough film. The villains are very bad and the heroine is likable enough, even if she does seem almost bi-polar at times. It is no surprise that she is oddly written, what with the spunk put into a character that is not supposed to have any. Of course, the basic plot points don't work with this new-found backbone and so they go back to shy Fanny Price when needed. The Bertram household versus the Price household was well enough done to make us believe that Fanny might marry a man that she doesn't love, but the added slavery subplot is strange and unnecessary. The ending was not romantic enough to be satisfactory after all of the melodrama.

Perhaps I just have a ""thing"" for Frances O'Connor, but this film has many virtues beside her performance. The photography is beautiful, with several artful uses of slow motion. The dialogue is well-tuned and well-delivered. The plot is not confusing. There is subtlety, sensitivity, a hundred little finely-honed details. Above all, the movie ingratiates us to the main character, her spunk and her feelings of inadequacy, her sweetness. Those qualities carry us through the movie. This is a film I want to revisit because this is a character I'm endeared to.

Fanny's childhood years zoom by without ever laying a good foundation for the inequality she is subjected to at Mansfield Park. Without that, the rest of the story is meaningless. Why was she particularly drawn to Edmund? Because he's there, I guess. I certainly didn't get any more of a reason out of this movie. As well, there is heavy emphasis on Sir Thomas's slave trade when it was merely alluded to in the book. I think his characterization is all wrong. He comes across as just a cruel hard man, sort of disdainful of Fanny, while in the book he is not forthcoming with affection but at the same time has a genuine fondness for her. I actually couldn't stand the Fanny in the book because she was such a doormat, but at the same time I appreciated that she could very well have been a believable character in that era. The movie Fanny is nothing of this, which also ruins the dynamic of the plot. As for other characters, we don't see nearly enough of Tom to even get a feel for him. Same for Aunt Norris. The Miss Bertrams are almost superfluous here. I suppose the Crawfords are true enough. Perhaps it was too daunting a task to condense the entire novel into a single movie while staying true to the characters and plot, but this screenplay needed to be burned before it ever got put onto video. I could go on and on, but other reviewers have already spoken and I agree with them. The 1-star ratings, of course. Even if someone had never read ""Mansfield Park"" and watched this film, I'm not sure what they could make of it.

1098692,3,6305892806,"I just finished watching the movie Mansfield Park which debuted in 1999 and was directed by Patricia Rozema, and I am seeing for the first time; and it struck me for a couple of reasons, with some of the scenes sending my mind spinning. Although my review here is from a very narrow prism, I think it valid all the same and I am not willing to give it a pass. You may ask yourself how I can be so narrow, well, I do not look at movies just be to fun-entertained, I am very concerned with the message and construction of the story being told. For this review my focus is only going to deal with the issue of slavery and how it has been sanitized and trivialized in this movie.

Set in 1806 England, and although, one never actually see's any slaves, or a black person at all for that matter; they are the very foundation of the Bertram family's wealth. A family that is rich enough so that they can afford to take in a very poor 10 year old relation. Which brings me to the start of the movie and the first mention of slaves, as the coach is carrying the 10 year old girl Fanny Price to her rich relative's mansion.  They pass along a coast where a ship is anchored and the coachman stops to tend to the horses and Fanny leans out the window and asks, ""Do you hear that? It was the sound of wailing, the coachman explains to her that it was coming from the anchored ship in which slaves were confined. It struck me that the scene seemed to touch on a serious topic in a fairly casual manner. My immediate thought was, is this the new way the subject of slavery is going to be dealt with in films now?

 Then further along in this story, we come to find out how much the business of slaveholding and dealing in Antigua has aided and given this family respectability and standing in English society. The daughters and sons have all been given the best education; they are full of all the right social graces and good and witty converse. They have been introduced to polite society at the right moment, and have every expectation to aspire to the best financial matches for their future matrimonies, which will increase their fortunes, all thanks to the poor slaves being held in Antigua.

The next mention of the slaves in Antigua is when the Patriarch has to travel to Antigua to go over his holdings. Upon his return from Antigua there is a scene where the family is in the sitting room, and the Patriarch is talking about the physical attributes of the slaves he holds and how there is a girl he plans on bringing to England to work in the house, and Fanny Price mentions that she has read that if you bring a slave to England they would have to be granted freedom. Then, the Patriarch makes an ignorant comment about how two mulattoes could not have offspring, to which statement one of his son's who is studying to become a clergyman objects.

The fourth mention I noted is when Fanny Price who was accustomed to reading books in the great library of the mansion finds a book of sketches of slaves, and the daily tribulations they suffer, she is so overcome that she begins to cry as she turns the pages and finds one sketch after another more gruesome than the last. The patriarch walks up on her, and is angered that she has uncovered his book of ""slaveography"", after rudely sending her out of the library he is seen to be overcome with feelings of shame and starts to tear each page from the sketch book and throws it into the lit fireplace. Then he is seen to be in a state of remorse and guilt as the camera pans away from him sitting alone in the library.

The last scene to trivialize the unfortunate slaves in Antigua was towards the end, when Fanny Price is neatly putting in place the end of each character in the film for the sake of the viewer. She is telling how each one ended up, when she casually mentions that the Patriarch has now divested himself of the business of slave holding and trading and had found a new lucrative business concern which was tobacco, another slave related business!

""Djonga (Slavery)"", a song by Salifu Keita which shows up at the end as the credits are running is one of the brighter spots of this film.",1308441600,,4151,4.347096774193548

While I wouldn't recommend it for all audiences of the first two movies, it is still very lively, a very good story, good ending, and well played by all cast members. A brief spot of nudity and a glance at some shocking pencil drawings, might be off putting to some (especially if there are children watching). But overall I really liked it and would recommend it.

1098695,1,6305892806,"Just finished watching this movie and I wish I had the time back.  This was so not what I was expecting or hoping for in an adaptation of an Austen novel.  I've read the book and the characters are completely altered from the book that Jane Austen wrote; Lady Bertram is a junkie, Sir Thomas is disturbingly lecherous and there is no mention at all of William.  So many liberties were taken with the story that I found myself saying over and over again ""That wasn't in the book AT ALL"".  Fanny never accepted Crawford's proposal in the book, the whole outing to Mr. Rushford's estate was omitted from the film and the relationship between Fanny and her brother William is totally missing because I guess William doesn't exist in the movie.

I admit that Mansfield Park isn't my favorite of the Austen novels but it deserved a better treatment than it got in the movie.  At least I borrowed it from the library and I am not out any money.

If you loved or even tolerated the book, I believe you will be disappointed by this film version.  What a waste of time.",1304208000,6,1059,4.422680412371134

The characters have the same names, but sadly that's the only thing they seem to have in common with the originals.  Fannie is no longer abashed, timid, lacking in self-confidence.  She's snippy, physically attractive, and emphatic.  The depth of personality and motive of every character is completely absent, and the whole underplot of slavery is completely out of place and detracts from what should have been the point of the film.

If you're an Austen fan, and enjoy ""Mansfield Park"" in book form, stick with that.  This is probably the worst adaption I've ever seen, and that's saying quite a bit.",1299715200,9,734,4.926829268292683

While character development and plot were fine it seemed too modernized. While the lead female character (Fanny Price) is very strong and true to the way Jane Austen wrote her heroines, there were some rather risque scenes that Jane Austen would not have put in there. So bottom line- the movie was fine but not very true to the book I'm sure so therefore, I would not recommend this version of Mansfield Park.",1298592000,,544,4.618556701030927
1098779,2,6305892806,"I was sadly disappointed in this interpretation of the book. First of all, Fannie, both the young and older Fannie are not at all portrayed as they are in Jane's book. You expect her to be shy, timid, afraid and then grow stronger. She is never once portrayed as that, she cries a little bit as a child when she first gets there and once when Mrs. Norris sends her on an errand. Mrs. Norris who plays such an integral part in making Fannie unhappy in the book, is only displayed making comments to Fannie in one scene that causes her embarrassment, she is not a primary character at all. I was also disappointed that Mansfield was not shown as the luxurious home that Jane described it as, it is large, but very plain. Sir Thomas is portrayed as almost creepy with the portrayals of activities in Antigua portrayed in Tom's journal. Lady Bertram and Edmund I feel were correctly portrayed, I thought the character of Edmund was played beautifully and true to Jane's description.

On a more positive note, the sisters, Mary, and Henry were very acceptable, but taking the importance of William completely out of the story was a great loss because it was integral in portraying to Henry and Sir Thomas the side of Fannie they had never seen before. Mary was played beautifully and I believe quite the character Jane described.

All in all, I hope to someday find a portrayal of Mansfield Park that will satisfy Austen purists, but sadly this is not it.",1297987200,5,1450,4.594594594594595
1098780,2,6305892806,"I'm a huge fan of Jane Austen and I've seen most of the adaptations of her books that have been made into films.  This one is by far the least faithful to the novel.  In the movie, Fanny Price is a combination of the book character and Jane Austen herself.  Fanny is always writing and the writing is quoted from Jane Austen's Juvenalia.  If that weren't bad enough, Edmund is portrayed as weak-willed, Lady Betram is addicted to laudanum, and Sir Thomas Betram is a cruel slave owner.  Things only subtly hinted at in the orginal novel are exaggerated into graphic detail in the movie.  I can tolerate a few liberties with the original book but this is nowhere near it.  My husband who hasn't read the book says it's an OK period piece.  I can't stand it because although the plot is similar to the book, the characters bear almost no resemblence to their literal counterparts.  The actress playing Fanny is pretty but she's far too old to play a 17 or 18 year old girl.  Jonny Lee Miller, who makes a good Mr. Knightly in the latest version of Emma, is simply OK as Edmund in this.  If you want a decent version of Mansfield Park, I recommend the old BBC version with Sylvestra LaTouzel (hopefully spelling that right) as Fanny Price.  There is a newer version which is better than this but stars Billie Piper who is badly miscast as Fanny.",1296864000,6,1342,4.454918032786885

The notable exception would have been for O'connor to have copied Sylvestra Le Touzel's shy and humble Fanny. And for Lindsay Duncan to have copied Angela Pleasence's sleepy Lady Bertram instead of the director's choice of making her a drug addict. And of course the last (and perhaps worst problem) is that instead of telling Jane's Mansfield, the writer Roszema turns it in her political soap box with the political correct condemnation of slavery and also finishing out turning Fanny into a Jane wannabe writer... Maybe her dream (and failure), but not Fanny's (or Jane's for that matter).",1282003200,3,767,4.862595419847328

  Fannie price is supposed to be a quiet, mild mannered, sweet tempered young lady, she had opinion's but she didn't share them. I didn't care for the way Hollywood portrayed her character at all.
  Hollywood also got Sir Thomas's character wrong, they portray him as mean hearted and vile, while in Jane Austen's Novel he is quiet and distant but he loves his family and you get a clear sense of that...
  And where is William Price, Fannie's brother. He is such an important part of Fannie's life, and yet they dicided to cut the character from the movie....really!

1098786,2,6305892806,"This is, not only the worst adaptation of a Jane Austen novel I've ever seen, but the worst adaptation of any novel. Even if you view it as a stand-alone historical drama, it suffers from some very strange shifts in style and mood that make it feel cobbled together. Watching this film, I got the feeling that it had been done by a group of at least five different directors, working each from a different script, who took turns passing the camera back and forth. One scene is a whimsical comedy, the next a dark historical drama that wanders far from the text of the novel to explore England's part in the slave trade.

One or two scenes actually did seem to be based  on the original work, and these where a bit of a tease, because they where fairly well cast and well acted, but the story was always whisked off in some new and unexpected direction immediately afterward, there being a clear understanding between the makers of this film that there was no way Mansfield Park, (one of the only six completed novels given to the world by Jane Austen) could possibly stand on its own, without at least some gratuitous lesbianism thrown in.

A couple of the directions this movie tried to stumble in actually seemed really interesting; the added subplot of the slave plantation that the Bertram  family drew its income from put an entirely different spin on Tom Bertram's character, so that instead of being a worthless prodigal son he became a sensitive artist tormented by guilt. The problem was that this was far too serious a matter to be relegated to subplot and then forgotten when the movie took another turn for the whimsical. The different styles all crammed together in one movie just got in each others way and the scenes didn't seem to fit together in any logical way.

There was no general consensus on what the main character, Fanny Price, was supposed to be either, except (you need only look at the product description to surmise) that she not be allowed to be anything close the the character from the book. She seemed to divide her time between riding great black horses through rainstorms in order to proclaim her liberated womanliness, and quoting directly from the Juvenalia, Jane Austen's early works, in order to establish that she leads a rich inner life, I suppose.

If you've read the book you may be able to enjoy this movie in a MST3K kind of way. I'm curious to know if someone who hasn't read the book would be able to enjoy this movie, or if they would still find the shifts in style as jolting? One thing is certain though; if you haven't read it, and are trying to fake it, for the purposes of a book report, trying to impress someone at your book club, etc, you'd do much, much better with the clifnotes.",1266364800,9,2737,4.5528455284552845

Fanny is all wrong, Maria and Julia look like baboons, Sir Thomas is very evil and Tom driven to dissolution by the family's Antigua slaveholdings. This last is the most significant departure. While exploring how institutions like slavery morally bankrupted those who profited from it makes a worthy subject, Mansfield Park is not the venue. Especially as it is done with such a heavy touch.

Austen purists may well be appalled, but Frances O'Connor brings to life a heroine more in the classic Austen mode, more like Elizabeth Bennett or Marianne Dashwood. O'Connor's Fanny is clever and witty -- a vast improvement over the priggish milquetoast Fanny of the novel! The film is supplemented from Austen's own letters, making Fanny more representative of Austen herself than of the moralizing, nebbishy Fanny of the book.

Set in England in the early 1800's this is a story about a poor, but smart, young girl develops into a strong-willed woman who makes her own destiny.  She does not let others do it for her.

The opening scene shows a nine year old Fanny leaving Portsmith by stagecoach.  Her mother is sending Fanny to her wealthy sisters' home, Mansfield Park, to be given an education and raised in comfort.  We see her mother living in poverty with many children about two years apart.  Fannie is raised with her cousins, but not accepted as having the high status of the Mansfield Park family (The Bertrams).  She falls in love with her cousin, Edmond, however, he is conflicted during most of the movie and it is not clear he loves her.

Fanny keeps in touch with her family through letters to her sister.  She loves to read and write and her intelligence and wit shine through.

There is also soapbox drama when con-artists arrive to the estate.  Mary and Henry Crawford want to establish ties with the the Bertram's through marriages so they can inherit some of the fortune and estate.  Henry proposed to Fanny, she would not take up his offer.

At their core, Austen's novels are all ""cautionary tales that end happily for those who follow the rules [of an ordered world and polite society] and badly for those who don't.""  As in the book, the story is centered on Fanny Price, modest, reserved (except with her cousin Edmund) and courageously and steadfastly moral.  Yes, there are some added background stories, ""moods"" and character variations in this movie, but it is absolutely true to Austen's core theme.

Consider the added background story of slavery.  In Austen's England, slavery was a highly charged political issue and not universally considered a black and white moral issue.  Today, thank God, it is.  We know that Austen's novels didn't deal with political issues, but in today's world to watch a movie that blithely referred to, and in so doing condoned, Sir Thomas Bertram's business in the West Indies would have been a bit painful (even considering the morals of the period) when we now know that the West Indies were at the heart of the slave trade and rife with many of the most inhumane practices.  So the addition worked for me.  It felt consistent with the theme of condemning what is bad and upholding good.  Not very Austen in subject or mood, but entirely in theme.  What's more, few Austen movies do justice to Austen's wit.  The writing and directing of the last scene - sharing final glimpses of the lives of each of the characters - captured her wit perhaps better than any scene in any other Austen film I can think of.

The acting is uniformly excellent, but there are performances, such as Embeth Davidtz as Mary Crawford and Harold Pinter as Fanny's uncle, that are truly Oscar-worthy.  And there are scenes, such as when Mary Crawford fully reveals her flexible morals and Fanny's judgment is vindicated, that I could watch over and over, they are so perfectly constructed.

All the other one-star reviews are accurate, but here's a little more in case you're still not convinced: (Spoiler Alert) Mary Crawford actually stands up amidst the entire family and states (out loud) her wishes that Tom die so that Edmund can inherit the estate.  Fanny is strong willed throughout the movie (obviously unlike the book) but then she flip-flips on the only important decision she has to make through the entire course of the movie.

Edmund is enchanted with Mary Crawford, she is fashionable and by all appearances seems 'good' but is unsure of her true character. Henry Crawford is nothing but a player. He plays with the hearts of both Maria and Julia, then later on goes after Fanny! Fanny of course is smart and can see through him. Her heart is for someone else....
When her uncle forces her to marry Henry Crawford because he is rich and she refuses, she is sent home. Going from luxury to poverty makes her sad, but when she is there, Henry 'bothers' her again, and in the movie she gives in and says yes, she will marry him and then rejects him-which makes him do something stupid but predictable. Nevertheless the movie ends up good when Fanny lands the man of her dreams.
The book by Jane Austen is very different. In the movie, Fanny is a writer with a wild imagination. In the book, Fanny is very softspoken and very much a lady. When Henry Crawford does something 'stupid' to attempt to ruin their family, there was no reason. Which I liked. In real life some people have no reason for doing horrible things, they just do. In the movie, they gave a reason.(Fanny deciding not to marry him after she said she would)
So, all in all it was very entertaining. The only things that I did not like was Fanny getting weak and agreeing to marry Henry Crawford and making her character a 'wild' woman. Read the book for the true version of Mansfield Park. It's much better.",1246924800,3,2092,4.4934383202099735
1098970,4,6305892806,"CodeMaster Talon's spotlight review is perfect - describing the likability of the movie, differences between the adaptation and Austen's original work, and some of his problems with the characters.  Yes, I too was frustrated by Jonny Lee Miller's Edmund - he should have been adamantly beating the drums about his feelings towards Fanny.  Instead, he comes across as meek and unable to speak his mind.  Sure, this is #2 son in the face of a gale force of a father (awesome portrayal by a brilliant Harold Pinter), but as Edmund increasingly fails to state the obvious (that he loves Fanny ""as a man loves a woman"" - as he finally lets out), you wonder: why again is she attracted to this man?  Like most of Austen's work, you spend the entire movie wanting to conk together the heads of the two protagonists who are clearly destined to be together.

O'Connor's manner, her delicacy, sensibility, spirited autonomy despite the character's real destitution, are so effective that repeated viewings make this a richer experience rather than a tired one.  I love the post-colonial touch of acknowledging the slave trade and the probable abuses on Sir Thomas's Antigua property.

I can't recommend this film enough.

Her method is to be good and wait for good things to happen to her. Of course, ultimately they do when she captures the heart of her drippy cousin Edmund.
  This movie inserts a few little touches to ""bring it up to date,"" notably a few allusions to the evils of slavery upon which the Mansfield Park finances depend (there is a distant, unseen sugar plantation in Antigua) and also a slight hint of lesbianism which is enough to titillate the senses but no more.

If, however, you revel in period films done with good production values, intelligent writing and acting, and if you don't mind some nudity and shock value that moves the whole work out of the family-viewing arena, then this film has much to reccomend it.

I mostly appreciated the way that this director/writer effort managed to transport elements of Austen's novel onto the screen, although they often appear tranformed as well as transported. Though this film lacks the polite-society feel of Austen as we have come to expect it from previous film versions of her novels, in purely literary terms it remains true to much of the themes and motives of the original. This version of Mansfield merely expresses them a bit differently.

On the other hand, there are some aspects of this adaptation that stole the enjoyment for me. The infamous slave-drawings scene, for instance, while it helps sympathize Tom's character (you get why he's drowning his pain and moral confusion in alchohol), creates a huge dichotomy in my mind over Fanny's eventual reconciliation and respect for her uncle. How is it possible that such a thoughtful girl as Fanny can learn respect for the monstrous, evil-minded man her uncle is in this adaptation? In addition, that horrifying scene, with Fanny poring over the agonized drawings Tom made of his father engaging in acts of brutality with the family slaves, felt a bit too much like the director was expressing an agenda. I can deal with tough stuff in a movie, if it serves the story well, but this just didn't.

Also, cousin Edmund lacks the motivations that in the novel, render his behavior understandable. Here, he comes off as a wispy stick-figure kind of guy. One has to wonder what her attraction to him could be. Their eventually coming together feels a bit too much like the characters themselves had access to the script and no choice but to follow it.

For me, the main thing this movie lacked was any genuinely likeable characters other than Fanny, and perhaps her sister. That is a wearying thing in a feature-length film.",1230249600,,2215,4.805774278215223

It follows the main storyline fairly well, only getting a few things at the end rearranged. One thing that they brought into this movie which I wasn't sure belonged in a Jane Austen movie was a sort of abolitionist view point on Edmund, Fanny and Tom's part.

I will leave it to those in the know to make the final judgment of this movie as an accurate interpretation of the original. As a post-modern deconstruction, that is, as a director's version, if you will, of the original, it seems to me this can be evaluated on its own terms. Does it work? Is it entertaining? Is it enlightening? To these question, my answer is yes. I found the explicit references to the slave trade valid if not faithful to Austen. This is a 20th century artist's take on an injustice wrongly neglected. Tying the English country life to the source of its wealth strikes me as valid. Dramatically, it works as an explanation for the son's torment and for the father's guilt. Harold Pinter, by the way, is fantastic. The Nobel-winning playwright makes a rare appearance, offering a wonderful glimpse into this fine actor's talents. I found all of the performances convincing. I especially loved seeing Lindsey Duncan playing two roles, that of the wayward sister, strapped with a loser husband and a house full of crying babies and that of the aristocratic drug addict lying about the country house being waited on hand and foot.  No doubt there will be a better version one day, but this one does a fine job of drawing modern audiences to what must be the director's chief claim, which is that Austen is an exciting author worthy of multiple interpretations.",1222646400,2,1450,4.7312252964426875

Only the names of characters and a few turns of the plot have been kept, but not the essence of the book.  (The Austen book is not a comedy; Fanny Price can be a frustrating heroine for a modern reader because she would never dream of ""standing up for herself,"" such a concept would be unthinkable to a character like hers, which represents the ultimate victory of sheer goodness over the blandishments of personality, as represented by the opposing persona of Mary Crawford.)  This film's presentation of Fanny Price seems rather to be the director's/writer's supposition of what Jane Austen herself might have been like, but it's not even a fair representation of the voice of the narrator.  Filmmakers need far more insight into the premises, not merely of the 18th century in general, but more precisely of the Austen consciousness in particular, not overlooking what a profound place religion played in her heart, and that is what is needed in order to portray Mansfield Park the way it might have seemed to its creator. Of course, then it probaby wouldn't be nearly as popular. Remove the title to this film, and it has some merit on its own in terms of crafting, but -- but--.",1215129600,11,1296,4.725663716814159

If you are an Austen fan, this film might act as some sort of heretical treatise than an actual depiction of her vision of Mansfield Park, but for people like me, who know next-to-nothing about her work, I can say that the film was highly enjoyable.

PLOT: Fanny Price is sent to live with a very aristocratic family. It is here that she delves into the realm of flirting with simple head-nods and that magic twinkle in your eyes. Drama, untold buckets of drama, unfold, and Fanny learns that to find love through purity is often a very difficult thing. In the end, Fanny finds love, and millions of women once again will be swooning over 19th century romanticism, wishing to God that there were more men nowadays who thought like they did back then.

My chief complaint is the story is not as faithful to Jane Austen's work as it should be.  There are so many ways this film differs from Jane Austen's version.  Bluntly, it all comes down to the producer hammering watchers over the head with concepts such as slavery, infidelity, etc. that were touched on lightly in Austen's book.

I read the book, enjoyed it, and then came back to the movie.

There are a lot of adaptations whose main purpose is to put as much of the book on screen as possible, keeping everything in the same order, and being fiercely loyal to the author's vision. This is just one person's opinion, but I think that's the wrong way to go. When I want pure Jane Austen, I read.

I think that if a filmmaker goes to the time and effort to make a movie from a favorite book, they have the right to interpret and get creative. (If you disagree, you should probably just stay away from this movie.)

I thought that infusing Fanny with a little of Jane Austen's personality (through her letters and early writing) was a charming reinvention that didn't change Fanny in her essentials. She is still uncompromisingly moral and still trusts herself unflinchingly.

I appreciated the film's focus on the slave trade. It added a lot to the characters of Sir Thomas and Tom to contrast the world of manners with the barbaric ""interests in Antigua"" that make it all possible. The issues and the manner in which they were addressed were historical and they added to the plot. The rich had worse vices than bored housewives, after all.

Edward was not a very compelling romantic lead in this movie. I thought that was its weakest point. My only other criticism is that there were no front-hook corsets in this period -- but movies always ignore that. It's a tradition :) The costuming and the setting were beautiful. The music fit the mood of the film perfectly",1204243200,4,1771,4.570977917981073

Sir Thomas and his lady are both villified, especially the latter.  There is no excuse for the liberties taken.

1099207,4,6305892806,"I had no trouble enjoying MANSFIELD PARK because I had no comparison to make to the novel, which I never read. I saw nothing about it that made me think it was catering to 1999's sensibilities, despite the use of a scene where someone is caught in flagrante with another. Aside from that indiscretion, the dialog seemed like authentic Austen to me and the whole affair has been expertly photographed in England, of course, on lush locales that are breathtakingly gorgeous to look at. The swirling camera swerves often from the interior of a room to the vast horizons outside with the greatest of ease.

And, of course, the British cast cannot be praised highly enough. All of them perform to the manor born in the appropriate style. FRANCES O'CONNOR (who closely resembles a young Jennifer Jones) is Fanny Price, the poor girl sent to live with rich relatives at Mansfield Park, who becomes an elegant young woman and a writer. (Sounds suspiciously like the author herself inserting her character on this role).

And JONNY LEE MILLER is Edmund Bertram, a young man obviously smitten with her from the start. It takes the entire running time of the film for the young lovers to discover they always did love each other, but along the way we're treated to some interesting episodes of British class distinction amid the manners and mores of a bygone era, including some sharp bits of humor.

Interesting that after essaying this quiet, unassuming role, Jonny Lee Miller would next take on the fight against a vampire in Dracula 2000. So much for British dexterity and range.

Summing up: Some admirers of the novel seem to be put off by this one, but I have to admit I enjoyed it, even if I did find Fanny's inconsistent feelings about her suitor,Henry, and her inability to make up her mind, rather frustrating at times.

We don't even know what qualities in Fanny lend her to so ""good"" as we do in the book and the BBC version, nor would this character even qualify for those qualities.  The characters are, unfortunately current ""Hollywood"" style.

1099296,4,6305892806,"When you sit down to watch this film, I suggest you rename it in your head. Think of it as being entirely unrelated to the Jane Austen novel and you'll certainly enjoy it. What you absolutely must not do is look for a film that captures Austen's caustic sarcasm or, indeed, most of her novel ""Mansfield Park.""

Personally, I really do love this film, but only when I'm keeping it separate from Austen's masterpiece. The main problem with this film can be summed up in one person: writer/director Patricia Rozema. What she thought she was doing to the classic novel, I have no idea. She has changed the characters considerably: Fanny, who is shy and timid in the novel, becomes a courageous writer with a sarcastic wit; her uncle, Sir Thomas Bertram becomes an odious man with the intention of trading her off into marriage the same way he trades his slaves; her cousin Tom, rather than living unaware of the needs of anyone else, spends his time balancing between being in a drunken stupor and arguing with his father on behalf of their slaves; her aunt, Lady Bertram, is addictied to opium; and her Aunt Norris is not nearly so snide as in the book. Worst of all, I think, is the complete omission of William, fanny's brother and best friend. Rozema also has given the relationship between Fanny and Mary Crawford an air of lesbianism, which irritated me a great deal. (Rozema says in her commentary that the two scenes which give that feeling were born of Austen's comment on the ""fascination of their relationship,"" though, having read the novel, I can assure you that nothing of the sort is even slightly hinted at.)

The worst flaw in Rozema's film, though, is undoubtedly her commentary on slavery. The audience is basically force fed constant, and sometimes very graphic reminders of where the Bertram's wealth is coming from. The whole slavery subplot detracts from the main story and seems to be more of a shock tactic than anything else.

Luckily, the film has some redeeming qualities in its cast. Hugh Bonneville and Victoria Hamilton are perfect as the absurd Mr. Rushworth and the obnoxiously self-centered Maria. Frances O'Connor is a charming heroine, and the way in which Rozema utilized lines straight from Austen's letters and journals as Fanny's speech gives the audience a chance to place Jane Austen as the heroine of Mansfield Park, as well as granting us a rare chance to hear more examples of her sharp wit.

So, keep it separate from the book, try not to get lost by the slavery subplot, sit back and enjoy an otherwise beautiful film!",1199404800,4,2561,4.748314606741573

The biggest difference was in the character of Fanny Price.  No matter how badly we in the twenty-first century want to believe it, she was *not* a modern, outspoken, independent woman.  She was deeply conservative.  If the film makers disliked that aspect, why choose this book to film at all?

As a film, Patricia Rozema's adaptation of Jane Austen's MANSFIELD PARK stands on it's own as a stinging, satirical view of the life and times of one Fanny Price in 1806 England. All that is Austen,the ""advantageous alliances"" that are made through marriage, scandals that could kill a family's reputation, the pecking order of sons for inheritance, and the heart as the moral compass and guide are all here, and brought to the screen with great effect infused with a little bit of naughtiness and innuendo. This retelling of MANSFIELD PARK is so interesting and wonderfully reconceived that it far outweighs the BBC version for it's fresh and new characterizations of Fanny and the Bertrams and the Crawfords.

What I really like about this MANSFIELD PARK is Rozema's clever weaving of the English Slave Trade into the fiber of the film. No doubt this WAS THE hot topic of the time as in 1807 the trade of the Middle Passage WAS abolished in England.(See the current film AMAZING GRACE)Yes,people who sought their fortunes in it DID turn ""to tobacco"",which was the trade simply continued in America!!!

As far as performances...they are OUTSTANDING. Harold Pinter as Sir Thomas was played with great complexity and the late Sheila Gish as Fanny's Aunt is one of the best comedic turns yet for an Austen adaptation!

Lesley Barber's soundtrack is lush, romantic and also full of witty motifs to propel the action.

This MANSFIELD PARK is full of fine direction, sets, costumes and modern sensibility that makes the timeless Austen all the more compelling. The film never lags and is quite clever. 5******'s for Rozema's Austen!",1182038400,12,1790,5.057627118644068

This movie is a piece of art in its own right, and also should be seen as such. I enjoyed this film. And while it did take many liberties, I still feel it was a genuinely well done movie. I LOVE Jane Austen's novels, for she was a woman entrenched in her time but also ahead of her time. I don't think she would take her stories to be sacrosanct, as many of her admirers and critics do.

1099470,2,6305892806,"As soon as I read the above editorial, I knew that very little of the DVD could actually be an accurate representation of Austen's title. I mean, it says right there in the official Amazon description, ""Mansfield Park is an 'autobiographical novel'""---it is NOT! Of all the novels, MP is probably the LEAST so; and while Austen was very careful to put realistic life-experiences in her fiction, none of them can be said to be strongly autobiographical, no matter how much fans and critics want them to be.

As someone who completed his Master's thesis on Austen, I know whereof I speak! When Austen novels began to hit the screen back in the '90s, I remember telling a friend--""They'll never do Mansfield Park; or they'll transform Fanny completely---which changes the entire main point of the book. MP is supposed to emphasize Fanny's INNER qualities, so Austen had to nearly eliminate the exterior traits of the pretty, perky, outwardly appealing heroine."" Those, of course, went to Fanny's devious counter-part, Mary Crawford.

So, while it's a well-produced film, it's nowhere NEAR Austen's most controversial novel---controversial not because of the issue of slavery, but because most modern readers (along with a few of Austen's contemporaries) don't want a modest, retiring heroine. Which is fine; but then make another movie that doesn't pretend to be based on the book. It's like taking Dickens' Christmas Carol and making Scrooge kind-hearted but misunderstood.

One man's eyebrows, the suitor's, are altered like a woman's! No scenery or homes of interest, except a glance at the sailing ships in the harbor. Not a pleasant pace, without humor, without intrigue. A lesbian undertone in one scene.

The only positive thing I can think of is this good line of Jane Austen, quoted. Fanny sums up in one sentence, why she will not marry him. Women who have spent hours within romance in uncertainty, will wish to sum up their certainty with Ms. Austen's line: ""His sole interest is in being loved, not in loving"". This line is an exception to a lifeless script.

There, now you do not need to endure the painful movie. Here are two lines re-written by me: For the woman dealing with a trifling man: ""No man suffers pains of love on the stage."" For dealing with the infatuated man: ""You have wounded yourself, but not with love.""

This movie should be re-made by someone sharing the ideals of Jane Austen. There is plenty to be mined from the novel to create a pleasant film, humorous, with singing, with interest. A movie can take the best of the book, in the spirit of the book, which this movie did not carry, and make a movie better than the book. This movie is bad any which way.

She is not as assertive as she might be, it is true, but a realistic look at her background helps to account for this. She does, however, show the courage of her convictions by never stooping to the moral and intellectual levels of those around her, even when expedience demands it of her. She is a thinking individual; I'm convinced the author identified with her in many ways.

This film, in spite of what the previous reviewer wrote (Bea Bea must be great fun at a party) is not racy. It stays within the boundary of excellent taste throughout, and it is a tribute to the director and producer that they found a way to utilize the period homes of England to such great advantage-an intellectual and visual feast it is.

Finally, Frances O'Connor is terrific as Fanny. Her depiction of the integrity-driven Ms Price colored by a diffidence easily excused by her poverty tinted background is absolutely convincing. I can imagine no one else accomplishing as effective an interpretation. Nice job, Frances!

She is mentored by her uncle, the righteous and honorable [and I don't use the terms loosely] Sir Thomas Bertram. Somehow, the adaptation of this great novel has twisted Sir Thomas into a sadistic, sexual pervert. Moreover, Fanny is constantly babbling to us in Jane Austen quips that are not part of this novel. They simply missed the point of the book.

The acting is okay. The settings are okay. The directing is sad. But the sense of disappointment and betrayal by perverting the essential theme of the book has left a very sour taste.",1171843200,19,936,4.63855421686747
1099572,4,6305892806,"Patricia Rozema's 1999 screen adaptation of Mansfield Park caused nary a stir in the box office at the time of its release, but Janeites/Austenites and period film lovers (two groups that are by no means interchangeable) have for years internet-battled over whether the film is in fact faithful to Austen's novel. This review is my attempt to help bridge the gap between the two camps. My thesis: Rozema knows and respects the source novel so well that, through clever reconfiguration, she has paid Austen's work due tribute and captured the sprit of, while not Fanny herself, Mansfield Park and its other inhabitants.

Having read all of Jane Austen's major works and some of her juevenilia and letters, and having first read and re-read said works before viewing any screen adaptations of them, I am suitably acquainted with Austen and her milieu. However, I am not so Austen-centric as to consider myself a Janeite, and I am an all-around lover of the cinema; I thus fall as much as possible into the informed ""middle.""

Note: I will NOT be reviewing this movie's aesthetic and film merits, which are many. In particular, Lesley Barber's excellent piano-based score and Michael Coulter's deft cinematography are reason enough to see the film. Also, if you dismissed the ""slavery song"" over the credits (Salif Keita's ""Djonga"") as too postmodern or activist or anachronistic, don't overlook this song, which, from a musical perspective, stands on its own merits.

I first saw Rozema's film in the early 2000's. However, at that time, I had not (re)-read Mansfield Park in about ten years, so the book was not fresh in my mind, leading to my initial conclusion that the picture was indeed a very liberal (read: unsatisfactorily divergent) adaptation of Austen's work. But I have enjoyed the movie more and more over the years, and felt it was time to re-read MP with the film in mind.

Having just re-read MP this past week and re-screened the movie and its commentaries, I am happy to report that Rozema's Complete Divergences--that is, places in which she presents information or characters that appear either fabricated or directly at odds with Austen's own-- are in fact few, and less reprehensible than they may at first seem.

Here, as I see them, are the Complete Divergences:

1. *Fanny Price, external personality and employment*
Austen's novel: Fanny appears to be a physically fragile, perhaps overly-prudent young woman who is a bit too anxious to please and a bit too hasty to forgo the limelight, even when she is deserving of it. Fanny spends much of her time fetching tea and other things for her aunt Bertram; any stolen moments of freedom are employed in reading biographies, histories, and non-risque novels.
Rozema's external Fanny: a hardy and hale horse-racing lass who views herself primarily as a budding writer a la a young Jane Austen, penning letters, short stories, and biographies which she shares with a choice few. This Fanny, although still conscious of her low position in the family hierarchy, is more quick to speak up for herself and on behalf of others (slaves, for example).

2. *Susan and William Price, Fanny's siblings*
Austen's novel: William, a young naval recruit, is Fanny's beloved elder brother, to whom she writes often and who unwittingly figures into some plot points. Susan is the blunt-talking, assertive but amiable younger sister who becomes Fanny's protge.
Rozema: excises William and, likely for the sake of screenplay economy, folds him into Susan's character, producing one cherished sibling to whom Fanny writes. In the book, William is essentially a cipher for Fanny's feelings, so this works fine.

3. *Dr. And Mrs. Grant of the Parsonage at MP*
Rozema has also excised this pair of peripheral characters.

4. *Aunt Norris' Cheapness*
The delightfully mooching, liberal-with-everybody's-money-but- her-own Aunt Norris of Austen's novel has a reduced role in Roxema's picture, likely due to runtime concerns.

5. *Julia's Elopement*
Glossed over in Austen's book, this elopement was completely cut out of Rozema's screenplay.

6. *References to Slavery*
Again, glossed over in Austen's book: Fanny tells Edmund that she asked Sir Thomas about the slave trade (at that time, Britons were debating over the international abolishment of slavery) but we do not see her questioning him, and nobody issues an outright polemic against the institution. Thus, we know both Austen, her contemporary readers, and her MP characters are well aware of West Indies slavery and its likely relation to the Bertram family's estate in Antigua; however, we do not see inside any one's character head or hear their voices on the issue. Rozema, of course, has in her movie brought the issue front and just-peripheral-of-center.

7. *Adultery on MP premises*
The adultery scene onto which Rozema's heroine stumbles did not take place at Mansfield Park. In the novel, all of ""Mrs. R's and Mr. C's"" sexual liaison takes place off-scene in other parts of England, and is only reported on in a newspaper and by third parties.

8. *Henry's Wooing of Fanny*
Austen's Henry Crawford does not rejoice in the hasty betrothal acceptance proferred by Rozema's Fanny/Jane Austen alter-ego (Jane Austen once accepted and then refused a suitor in the same way). No starlings or other birds were sent to Fanny in Portsmouth (see below).

 Of the above changes, the most notable is Fanny Price's character. However, note that while Rozema has greatly altered the external Fanny (fragile tea-fetcher and put-upon Girl Friday), Frances O'Connor's portrayal of the inner Fanny--the passionate, sensitive young woman with a core of steel--nonetheless is spot-on in terms of Austen's characterization. Austen's heroine is a socially-skittish wallflower who, having allowed herself to be worn down and belittled by her wealthier, self-important relations, is all too happy to remain on the sidelines, where she feels deeply every slight, articulating to the reader her powerful emotions.  Yet Austen's Fanny finds the will and the strength to flat-out defy the threats, cajolements, and harangues of an imposing Uncle, meddling Aunt, and a smooth-talking brother-and-sister duo intent on Fanny's marriage to a man she neither loves nor trusts. Rozema and O'Connor faithfully bring to life this Fanny; witness O'Connor's shaky but defiant ""I will NOT"" to Harold Pinter's Sir Thomas.

The second most visible change is the emphasis on slavery which, again, was something Austen clearly--though briefly--referenced in her book. Rozema has probably erred in turning Sir Thomas into an unrepentant and brutal slavemaster who sexually abused his female slaves. THAT is, I will allow, a bit of a stretch, especially given the reconciliatory changes Austen confers on his character toward the end of the novel, and Fanny's growing respect and fondness for him. I think Rozema could have compromised by showing Fanny discovering a book of slave logs or receipts in Sir Thomas' study. Remember that the novel is all about captivity, and that the Bertram children and Fanny are all, in their own ways, like slaves, like starlings who ""can't get out"" from under their powerful father's expectations.

Speaking of starlings, let's talk about the numerous, delightful little ways in which Rozema culls bits and pieces from the novel and convincingly reworks them. For example, although Austen's Henry does not, like Rozema's,  read the starling-poem with Fanny--in fact, in the novel, it is Maria who invokes the bird imagery--Rozema recognizes that Fanny, like Austen's Maria, would also resonate with the idea of birds in captivity, and works that reference into Fanny's scenes instead. Yet Rozema does not strip the ascription from Maria, who in both the film and book outright states, ""I can't get out.""

In re-reading this book with the film in mind, I was astonished at how much of the screenplay is lifted wholesale from Austen's narrative, turned into dialogue, and assigned, appropriately, to characters. Returning to the movie Maria: her entire speech to her father, in which she resigns herself to a loveless marriage, is taken, verbatim, from several paragraphs in the novel revealing Sir Thomas' own thoughts. Similarly, in the novel, Mary Crawford writes a letter to Fanny in which she reveals her mercenary interest in Tom's death and Edmund's possible promotion to heir-apparent. Later in the novel, we learn from Edmund that Mary has revealed even more appalling bad taste by wishing marriage on the wayward adulterers and wanting to bring them back into the Mansfield fold. Rozema capitalizes on the dramatic potential of this letter and hearsay by giving us a scene in which Mary says all the exact same things, only to the Bertrams'--and the audience's--face.

Other little touches are simply Austen's characterizations exaggerated and magnified for the screen. Rozema, for example, takes the novel's unbelievably indolent and spacy and ""out-to-lunch"" Lady Betram and shows us her over-fondness for imbibements of the ""medicinal"" kind. I think this is a clever way to add to the characterization of a character that, in the novel, is not assigned sufficient causation  (Austen mentions in passing that both Lady Bertram and her sister Price are indolent and thoughtless ""by nature,"" while Aunt Norris just happens to be an industrious hyper-organizer).

Oh, and that horse Rozema's Fanny races? It's called Shakespeare, owing to novel-Fanny's love for the Bard, and how, in the novel, Edmund observes Fanny's pleasure in the recitation of Shakespeare's plays. The horse, like the gold chain that was not included in the movie, demonstrates Edmund's underlying regard for Fanny.

A multitude of other examples exists to convince the skeptical viewer that, in fact, Rozema's Mansfield Park is a more than acceptable version of Austen's--it is Austen's fictional world, condensed for the screen but conscientiously so, divergent in some details but not without due reason or inspiration, and yielding surprisingly successful results.

In short, even avowed Janeites owe it to Jane's novel and her characters--and yes, as Rozema points out, her life--to explore this movie and compare it side by side with the book. Don't do as I did and dismiss this picture as ""unfaithful"" without having read the book within a year of first screening the movie. In fact, I suggest watching the movie one weekend, and then picking up the novel (whether for the first time or, like me, for the fifth) and reading it with the movie still fresh in your mind. I think you will be pleasantly surprised,

Rozema not only clearly knows this novel inside and out, but she enjoys and admires it; I believe a director-screenwriter on less intimate terms with the book would have produced a movie perhaps more ""faithful"" to the surface actions of Austen's characters than to, like Rozema's Mansfield Park, their inner lives and emotional states.",1171843200,17,10937,5.178935447338619

Other than that, it could have been a different story. Fanny-in-the-movie is not the same person as Fanny-in-the-book - in this movie she's outgoing, rather obstinate, and strong willed. This isn't to say that this movie isn't enjoyable - I actually really enjoyed it once I made up my mind not to watch it as Mansfield Park, but as an unconnected story. I just wish they had called it something else, which I know is a silly sentiment but even so. :P

I also think that the oldest son's drunken behaviour, the adultary, and Fanny Price's morally upright character are played very well. The book of drawings of the slaves is a brilliant touch. I was little surprised to see nudity and actual sex in the movie though.  We get to see so little of the ""other side"" of Jane Austen society (the poor) in the novels that it is brilliant to see the Price family in this novel.  I think that the scenes depicting ""lovers vow"" are also good.  I did however miss seeing Fanny's eldest brother as a seaperson. I do not actually like this story all that much possibly because the slavery is so disturbing and I did not read the book all the way through until after watching the movie.",1169251200,4,912,4.536585365853658
1099578,1,6305892806,"The filmakers should have decided either to be true to Austen's original or to forget the book and make a good, solid movie.  In trying to do both, and without managing to reconcile these goals into any coherency, they have created something that is illogical and ridiculous.  A bad rendition of Jane Austen and a bad movie in it's own right.

""Mansfield Park"" not the easiest of Jane Austen's books to be made into a movie.  It's tone is far more melancholy than that of her other novels, and it involves two major problems for modern audiences:  the romance is between a pair of first cousins (not incestuous in Regency England), and the family that supports the main characters made its fortune in the slave trade (a fact which the book glosses over).  Combine all this with the fact that the painfully shy and endlessly patient Fanny Price is not exactly what a modern audience looks for in a heroine, and it becomes very understandable that the makers of this movie took several liberties in an attempt to modernize it.  The problem is not that the plot and characters were altered, but that those who did the altering made a horrendous job of it.

In attempting to update the character of Fanny Price, the filmakers made the interesting decision to combine the character's actions in the novel with biographical details from Austen's life.  Early in the movie, Fanny is portrayed writing wild and absurd stories in letters to her sister that sound suspiciously like Austen's unpublished childhood writings.  Later in the film, instead of rejecting an unworthy suitor outright, this Fanny accepts his proposal as a marraige of conveniance one day, only to take everything back the next morning when a good night's sleep has strengthened her conviction that marraige ought only be undertaken for love: a series of events that is nowhere in the book, but that Jane Austen herself actually did to one unfortunate gentlemen.  By the end of the movie, Fanny shows her new fiance a manuscript she has written that she hopes to get published.  Combining the life of Jane Austen with the life of one of her characters would have been an intriguing interpretation if it were not for the fact that the film-makers chose the character in all Jane Austen that is probably the least like the lady herself.

Fanny Price is a tender, subdued character who is so used to mistreatment by her adoptive family that she is actually moved to tears when her uncle allows her to keep a fire in the room where she spends most of the day.  Not much like the woman who penned the biting caricatural satires that Austen-fans know and love.  The inability to reconcile these two different characters into one creates a movie that is disjointed to the point of absurdity from beginning to end.  The character of Fanny Price is changed so much from book to movie that whenever Fanny does or says something actually taken from Austen's novel, it looks out of character.  This Fanny goes from bold and satirical to self-concious and frightened and then right back again so often and so suddenly that viewers trying to follow the story are likely to end up dizzy and confused.

If the bizarre changes of Fanny's character aren't enough, Edward (her cousin) is completely indecipherable.  The film suggests that he knew himself to be in love with Fanny from the beginning and never really felt much for Mary Crawford, making all of his decisions but especially his courtship of Mary and the length of time before he declares himself to Fanny completely mysterious.  There is also a bizarrely homoerotic interpretation of one of the scenes taken from the book between Fanny and Mary Crawford that comes out of nowhere and is never touched on again.  The entire film is a continuous non sequitur from beginning to end, from the first letter Fanny writes home to the bizarre tribal drum-beats that score the end credits for no apparent reason.

In the interest of fairness I will say that it is visually a very pretty movie with gorgeous lighting and that the actors seem very talented, leading one to believe that it might have been a decent movie if it had had an entirely different script and entirely different direction and if the people in charge had made entirely different decisions every step of the way.  But despite what I've seen in the other reviews (were we really watching the same movie?) and whether you're an Austen fan or not, the only reason to see this movie is to indulge in an MST3K-style mocking.",1169078400,15,4488,4.747747747747748

It's disappointing because most of the cast was great (Frances O'Connor was a little iffy for me as Fanny but the Fanny in this movie bears no resemblance to the book one so it doesn't matter, I guess).

Fanny here is a cross between Jane Austen (writing, and doing something Jane Austen did but book Fanny would NEVER do) and Lizzy Bennet (outspoken, strong, confident, etc.) Why did Rozema pick this story to film?

Yes, I mean the same Frances O'Connor who was so blank as the dream/mother in A.I.  Clearly the Director's fault however, as he lets her raise eyebrows in sexual knowing and all but have a lesbian moment with almost twin co-star Embeth Davidz.  It is really apalling for any Austen fan.
  The entire focus on slavery is not mentioned at ALL in the book, and is misplaced in Austen.  There is only one mention of business in the islands, and that could have been many many  things.  It is indicative of the film author's and Director's desire to focus on the most venal and debased part of human nature.  That too, is not Austen.
  So... what rates 2 stars?  The production values are wonderful.  Costumes, sets, but especially the cinematography is a high mark.  The spinning, soaring visual breaks set the mental set of a young girl who is literally made dizzy by the world she is ""out of place"" in.  Unfortunately, it is not carried through in the choice of actress or direction.
  A brilliant, memorable and completely right casting choice is the double-casting of Lindsay Duncan as both sisters, Fanny's Aunt and mother, Lady Bertram and Mrs. Price.  This is modernized Austen, and therefore, not Austen at all.  It holds it own just barely... but if you are going to update the mental set of a piece, you really need to set it in modern day.  Boo Hiss.

She sits, she observes, she pines for Edward, and she thinks. Occasionally she speaks. As a reader, you know her thoughts and emotions through Jane Austen's genius narration.

1099925,4,6305892806,"Unlike, say, 95% of the reviewers for this movie, I haven't read the book, and maybe that's why I'm giving it such high marks.

In the beginning of the movie, we meet Fanny who's the eldest daughter of an impoverished family (though the mother came from a middle class one) and she is being sent to live with her relatives. While she is kindly welcomed by the family, it's pretty clear that the differences in their social classes will always be evident, especially when it comes to her female cousins.

We later meet Edmund, her cousin and, in true 19th century British fashion, her love interest. Rather quickly, we're brought about ten years into the future where Fanny is around 20 years old and madly (though quietly) in love with Edmund and hopes that he'll realize he loves her, too.

With the entry of a well-to-do Henry and his sister, the comedy of errors is near complete. Henry is a playboy who, as Fanny realizes, craves attention and being loved. However much he flirts with her and her two cousins, she's still steadfast in her devotion to Edmund and refuses Henry's mulitiple offers of marriage--even when he follows her home from the Bertram's house to her family's dilapidated home on the docks.

While I'm somewhat familiar with other Austen works, it's clear that this movie has been shored up by vaguely modern characters, with modern viewpoints. In fact, I do find Fanny a bit more fiesty and steel-backed than is Austen's usual wont, but her moral fiber remains intact...even if the film's moral integrity seems a bit lacking.

The film blatantly points out the Bertram family's connection to the slave trade and we, quite shockingly, witness a nude scene (tame by modern standards) that Fanny takes quite well considering her gender and her time period.

Yet, despite the modern nuances evident in all aspects of the film, it's charm and Austen's wit are not to be overlooked. I like that there is dirt and grit in this film, unlike other squeaky-clean versions that would have us think this time period was nothing more than lilies and violet water.

The acting is solid and three-dimensional, the costuming and set design are authentic without being pretentious.

The only gripe that I have is that the romance between Edmund and Fanny is somewhat dull, though I have to admit, I find this in most adaptations of Austen's work (""Sense and Sensibility"" excluded). There's no spark between the two, in fact, the younger Edmund who meets Fanny as a child is more enthralling than the elder.

But still, Austen is read and loved for her witty intelligence as much as for the romance, so the film delivered in at least one aspect. Overall, it was an entertaining movie that I highly enjoyed, then again, I haven't read the book.",1136246400,8,2749,4.770526315789474
1099926,4,6305892806,"Mansfield Park is a terrific novel and, in this version, a terrific movie, even though i agree with other reviewers that the two are not telling the same story.  The movie is quite honest about saying, in the credits, that it is based on BOTH Mansfield Park and other early writings of Jane Austen.  The result is that the movie follows, for the most part, the story of ""Mansfield Park the novel"" except that the character of the novel's heroine Fanny has been replaced by a character more like (what the screenwriters imagine was) Jane Austen herself.  For instance, in the movie Fanny is a writer (she isn't one in the book), and she says lines that are actually from Austen's early History of England and Northanger Abbey.  Other than this massive change in Fanny, however, the plot and rest of the characters are fairly true to those in ""Mansfield Park the novel.""  Yes, Fanny's favorite brother has been replaced with a favorite sister, some lines are changed from the words of one character into the words of a different character, and (what is more unnerving) the unspoken possibility in the novel that Sir Thomas Bertram could own slaves in the West Indies is shouted from the rafters here.  Still, i can't help loving the movie's light touch and terrific performances every time i watch it, and I particularly think that the Crawfords are characterized to perfection.  The movie does a great job showing how the morally suspect Henry and Mary Crawford could nevertheless be attractive enough amid their faults to serve as temptations to Fanny and Edmund.

Now would it have been better if they had just let Fanny be the ""novel Fanny""?  It might have been a better adaptation, but I doubt it would be a better movie.  The struggles of ""novel Fanny"" are mostly private--she sits by suffering while everyone else in the book (except Edmund) practically ignores her.  The BBC movie version gets much closer to showing ""novel Fanny""--and the BBC version is nearly unwatchable.  I suspect the reason there's no true--and good--adaptation of ""Mansfield Park the novel"" is that the struggles of one girl's insides just can't be easily translated into the visual realm of film.",1135296000,9,2177,4.8382749326145555

Many events in the story as seen in this movie differ from those in the actual novel. The time line is manipulated to make the movie into a more Cinderella style, rather than the dark and more matured original version in the novel.  I did, however, like the fact that the movie emphasized on the then political problems such as slavery in Antigua.

Manipulation of Mary Crawford's character in the movie is misleading and hints on a cinderella style of the story, which is far off from the actual novel. Jane Austen has written a simple story of a simple girl, Fanny Price, who is neither tortured or harassed for most of her stay in the Mansfield Estate under the care of Lord Thomas Bertram.

Overall, the movie was made very well (cutting, color, long-short shots of camera work, choice of actors, etc.) but it lacked in substance.  The movie should have had more of the younger fanny rather than the older one.

It may be she glossed over some elements of this story, but that was surely the author's privelage.

 I just think if you want to tell another historical story then right your own. Fanny is simply wrong here, gutsy and self defensive. The way distasteful undertones to the story are headlined here and thrust upon us is crass and insulting, an intelligent film would build the tension and ask the viewer to draw their own conclusions, as Austen does in her much better novel. This way we would not have to be boldy told the awful family is a little more than a pack of slave abusers and we would not need Fanny to walk in on people having rampant sex in order to establish who would come good and who would come undone in the novels conclusion.

A movie SHOULD attempt to interpret a novel, not just offer moving pictures to go along with the texts. And the interpretation of this particular Jane Austen film is very much in the spirit of Austen herself.

I've read the novel(actually not one of my favorites either). And this film refuses to go for the easy target that we modern folks want these period pieces to do so often-envision this very idealistic time period that's full of rolling hills and romantic courtships. It really gets down to the gritty reality of a woman's status during this time period and how the family and the relationships within this unit are run like a corporation alot of the times.

Understanding how the social context affects how these various relationships in Austen novels interact in various ways is key to understanding Austen and her keen eye for social commentary. This director picked up on that importance, and made one of the best Austen film treatments to date as a result. She gets Austen's spirit, not just her plotpoints.",1095638400,8,1170,4.730392156862745

Unlike the book, the movie jumped from one scene to another without going into any real depth of human thoughts and emotions as expressed by Austin.  Fair enough the book is not as dynamic as Pride and Prejudice but in its own righs it is a good story with many subjects as subtext. Unfortunately the movie makers failed to focus on any of those. It also seemed like they changed the story line and decided to take some parts out altogether. There was no mention of Fanny's much loved brother to whom she writes while at Manafield Park.  Mrs Norris being one of the book's main characters was hardly part of the movie (an injustice to one of Austin's well written if not most liked characters). Fanny in the book is a church mouse with unexpressed opinions whereas in the movie she is shown to be  expressing herself without any hesitations and Edmund's influential skills have been missed out taking the life and soul out of his character.  Crawfords seem to appear out of thin air in the movie without any mention of the Grants.  It looks like that the director was in a real rush to get the jist of the movie across.  Some of the crucial scenes of attachment between Edmund and Mary have been avoided and it seems like they formed an attachment overnight for each other and seem can be said about Henry's affections towards Fanny.

Fanny Price's father's embarrassing (but to us highly amusing) vulgarity?  And am I the only one who noticed the slightly lesbian tones in Mary Crawford's attentions to Fanny, especially when Fanny has to take off her wet clothes?  Good grief!

Jane Austen must be turning in her grave.

Despite the slightly rushed pace, it has characters with some depth, a twisted coil of relationships and the lovely Frances O'Conner. However, if you have read the novel, this movie will be atrocious to watch. This director clearly had a certain agenda she wanted to push and Mansfield Park was the unfortunate story she picked to convey that.

She tries to make all the characters complex and well-rounded, with tangled emotions of real life. While admirable, the results are rather unbelievable in places and, for fans of the novel, completely ridiculous.  The characters of Tom, Mr. Bertram, Mr. Price and even the main character, Fanny Price, are unrecognizable!  Rather than the carefree, spendthrift Tom of the book, we're given a passionate, rebellious and very moralistic young man.  Worst however is the representation of Fanny.  No longer the unassuming and submissive girl Austen wrote of, she is now outspoken, bold and almost disrespectful, to the point where she is even told she has a tongue ""sharp as a guillotine"".

The director clearly had some social concerns she wanted addressed--namely slavery and the effects (both positive and negative) of education as well as the possibility of re-educating someone into an entirely different person, much like this movie which is quite different from the book.  Those are fine topics that are not a part of Mansfield Park. And while these are very serious topics, the pacing and tone of this movie is light and comedic which does away with much (if not all) of the necessary gravity.

That said, it is both sad and frustrating that a film such as this is made.  As many people have stated below, this film does not come close to representing the spirit of Jane Austen's work.  It would be fairer to say that this film accurately represents the spirit of Uncle Tom's Cabin or Nicholas Nickleby.  The people who will be inclined to like this film are the ones who enjoy spending money on movies that have plotlines which expose the evils and injustices of slavery and the class system - in a word, leftists.  I'm always amused when I listen to people as they try to explain their interest in such stories.  They use many of the same words and terms that the five star reviewers on this page use, such as: ambiguous; depth of character; character flaw; darker undercurrents; nuanced; socioeconomic; hollywood (as a pejorative description); cookie cutter; pablum; and of course, bourgeois.  If leftists want to make a movie about class struggle and the evils that white men have caused throughout history I think that's great.

Austen's caustic, yet ever so genteel commentaries on her society still resonate. Her use of language was superb. Yet, the writers of this screen play decided they could do better.

 They kept the title, the character names and the bare essentials of the plot. Then, the writers went off on their own tangents, including an angst filled side plot about slavery, complete with graphics of group rape, torture, etc.

 What on earth does any of that have to do with Austen's story? And why did they feel it was necessary to ignore Austen's witty dialogue and commentary? Instead, the writers substituted their own ""hilarious"" bits, including ""but it's 1806, things like that happen now!""

 This is an unwieldy film, full of anachronisms, as well as errors in costuming and behavior. You are constantly conscious that these are modern actors bringing early 21st century sensibilities and behaviors to 19th century characters. It doesn't work.

 Rent it before you spend the money to buy, and more importantly, give this shelf space. As an Austen scholar, I found this movie as jarring as nails screeching across a blackboard.",1090627200,34,1254,5.053398058252427
1100107,4,6305892806,"The first and foremost criticism you will hear for this film is that it does not slavishly follow Jane Austen's original novel. This is, in fact, true. For one, certain political issues (slavery) are brought to the forefront in a perhaps heavy-handed way that would constitute my only personal detraction from the film's worth. Certain plot elements are edited: in the novel, the preparations for the play that is abruptly cancelled take up a significant amount of text. And certain characters are much changed in manner and motivation, but more on that later.

 Despite these liberties taken with the original, ""Mansfield Park"" remains a superbly enjoyable film with the spirit of Austen intact, if not the letter or the law. Her heroine, Fanny Price, still has the same spirit and sensibilities that she was written to have, and her story -- that of a poor girl sent to live with her wealthy relatives, subsequently falling in love with her cousin Edmund -- is as fraught with emotion and upheaval as ever. A plot element I find especially keen is the downfall of Edmund's sister Mariah after her infidelity; Austen leaves no hope for Mariah's recovery here, whereas in ""Pride & Prejudice"", Lydia Bennett's living in sin with a dashing young officer who is forced to marry her is swept somewhat under the carpet. A side note, definitely, but an interesting contrast.

 Returning to ""Mansfield Park"", the character that undergoes the most startling transformation in this film adaptation is Henry Crawford, brother of Mary; both are enterprising and manipulative sophisticates intent on infiltrating the Betram family. In the novel, and in other previous film versions, Henry and Mary are an entirely matched pair -- both self-involved and self-serving. Here, Mary retains a black widow-type predatory slant, but Henry is given a new depth. He begins as the worst of playboys, chasing after Mariah Betram before (and after, as it turns out) her marriage, but here hsi pursuit of Fanny turns serious. He truly seems to fall in love with her, or at least in love with the man he could become if he were with her, which is in fact the most profound possibility of all. When Fanny briefly accepts his marriage proposal, we understand why, because his feelings do appear to be sincere; when she calls the engagement off, however, we see the inevitably of this decision, even barring her love for Edmund. Fanny might have ""been the making"" of this Henry, for there seems to be some hope for his sincerity. When he reverts to his immoral ways, however, after her rejection, we, along with Fanny, accept the sad truth that his transformation was only skin deep. This entire character exploration of Henry Crawford is not contained in the original novel, but (though many purist Austen fans will disagree) the film is the better for it.",1090454400,7,2828,4.922431865828092

I really don't think Alexandre Dumas would sue the recent movie portrayal of THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO (starring Jim Caviezel) which was almost completely opposite of his novel.  If movies were exactly like books, then I wouldn't really have a desire to see them.

The spirit Fanny posesses in the movie is more noticeable, and the issue of slavery is addressed at length - but not in the novel. Aside from the dissimilarites between the book and its film counterpart, Mansfield Park is a beautiful movie. The acting is exquisite, highlighting the sensual and angry undertones of the characters, and the themes of morality and virtue are expressed without having them shoved down your throat. True, the movie is not typical Austen - but it doesn't need to be. It is a passionate, free movie with romance and intrigue and a certain righteousness that I respect highly.

Also, when viewing a Jane Austen adaptation, one rarely expects to see frontal nudity, another misplaced and anachronistic piece that I found highly distasteful.  If you scorn the values and history of the society that Jane Austen expressed in her writing, you will love this movie.  Its goal is more mockery and disrespect than anything honoring Austen's work or ideas -- many have said that the screenwriter has a right to adapt how she wants to, but why make a movie off a book you so obviously dislike and want to completely change?  I can see only 3 reasons: 1) marketing to an audience on a false pretense, getting many viewers who would not normally pay to see the movie (though this will eventually breed more contempt for the movie, from misled viewers) 2) a cocky need to preach against the very values cherished by the fans of the original work, or 3) wanting to seem 'innovative' when the ideas you actually want to get across would be completely bland and trite in the modern slew of PC-movie-preaching.

The characters have little to do with her creations. The film simply throws Austen's Fanny Price out, and replaces her with a feminist changeling, who, however attractive in another film, is simply not what Austen meant at all. I think I see what the film makers were getting at. I don't, however, think they should have appended Jane Austen's name or the title of her novel to it.
If you are not a great lover of Jane Austen and her work, you might find the film interesting. If you are looking for a good and faithful adaptation of Mansfield Park, you will probably find the film intensely irritating, as I did.",1079913600,21,805,4.676056338028169
1100246,5,6305892806,"This film takes considerable licence with the original text, so if you are an Austen-purist, you may want to pass it by. On the other hand, Mansfield Park is not generally reckoned among Austen's best work, and in my opinion it benefits rather a lot from the extra dimensions, the darker undercurrents and the sheer zest added by the movie-script. As does the character of Fanny Price, who is transformed from the rather insipid victim and distant witness she is in the book, into a personality every bit as strong and outspoken as Elizabeth Bennet, making her the pivotal force in the drama. Her character is fleshed out further by turning her partly into Jane Austen herself: the delightfully whimsical correspondence with her sister in Portsmouth is all Austen's own. Thus reinforced, Fanny is well equipped to handle some very un-Austenlike situations; still, her walking in on Maria and Crawford ""in flagrante delicto"" may well give the authenticists a start. Henry Crawford is a rather more good-looking and charming character in the film than the book would have you expect (where Austen merely describes him as ""not handsome"", but in possession of ""an air and countenance""), which makes Fanny's doubts and vacillations more readily understandable. The slave-trade issue, only touched upon lightly in the book, is taken to the forefront of the story, culminating in Fanny's discovery of Tom Bertram's sketchbook, containing graphic depictions of the horrors going on at his father's Antiguan estate - throwing a very sinister light on Sir Thomas in the process.
Inevitably, the additions to the story, the profiling of the main protagonists, and the retelling of 350+ pages in just over 100 minutes, mean that other characters are reduced to vignettes, or completely left out. I did not find this at all disturbing - in fact the caricaturist treatment of Mrs. Norris or Lady Bertram adds a lot of the required ""comic relief"".  Also, there are some hilarious tongue-in-cheek moments, as when, at the beginning of her fatal speech on the possible rehabilitation of Maria and Henry, Mary Crawford exclaims, ""For heaven's sake, this is 1806!"" Again, purists may object against this scene: in the book Mary entrusts her scheme only to Edmund, and Fanny hears it from him second-hand; but in the film Mary shares it with the entire Bertram family including Fanny, and with the added cynicism of speculating openly on the financial benefits to be had from Tom's probable death. It is then not Edmund, but Fanny who challenges her. It is a very liberal solution, but dramatically it works perfectly, providing an intense climax through a head-on clash of ""good""  and ""evil"".
The cast is as good as that in any of the other high-quality Austen films we have had in recent years, but Frances O'Connor deserves to be singled out; she has tremendous charm and charisma, and is a presence powerful enough to carry the entire movie on her own. Jonny Lee-Miller, whom you might well associate with a rather different type of work, is a very convincing Edmund, and Harold Pinter gives us a suitably troubled and complex Thomas Bertram.
The entire film exudes an unsentimental, even cool atmosphere; in terms of cinematography, the eye can feast on many gorgeous images, at times Vermeer-like in their stark beauty. The choice to ""cast"" the fantastic ruins of Kirby Hall as Mansfield Park is a masterstroke, making it clear right from the start that all is not well with the Bertrams (why a completely different house is shown on the box cover is beyond me...).

For those who are familar with the book, in this movie,here are the following problems, (no spoilers here) Fanny is outspoken, sometimes loud and actually says ""yes"" to Mr. Crawford but later retracts it(this at Portsmouth). William is non-existent. Fanny is sent to Portsmouth as punishment for not accepting Crawford in the first place. Setherton is never visited, Maria is married after Fanny's ball, Crawford confronts Fanny about her love of Edmund and Maria runs off with Crawford after Fanny returns to Mansfield Park. The whole movie is choppy and does not flow as it does in the book. Plus additional scenes are inserted, (which are not in the book) about slavery that totally distorts the characters of Sir Thomas and son Tom. (In my opinion these scenes are not called for and destroys the characters and is opposed to what is in the book regarding them)
Granted it is and adaption of the book, and I am an open-minded person and have enjoyed the other movies related to Austin's works and would highly recommend them,(Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion, Emma-either version, and Sense and Sensibility) but I must say that this movie does a dis-service to Jane Austin and the characters of Mansfield Park.",1077494400,15,1531,4.847328244274809

The Crawfords, a brother and sister team of questionable morals, team up on our hero and heroine, Edmond and Franny.  The DVD touches on the evils of slavery, drugs, lust, and the ""selling"" off of young women into society.  I felt it should have carried a stronger story line into the slave trade and the goings-on in Antiqua, which obviously led to the moral break between Sir Thomas and his son Tom.

Actually, the film Fanny Price is much more likeable than Austen's character, who never could have carried a movie on her own, being too pious and self-effacing, and in my opinion, downright dull. ""Mansfield Park"" is obviously not my favorite Austen! However, the book deserved better than the socio-political tract that the director was determined to make it into, with historcially inaccurate references to slavery, and a hint of lesbianism. The book was set at a time in British history where the slave trade had been outlawed for several years, and so it would have been impossible for Fanny to have seen a slave ship discharging slaves off of the coast of England. There was nothing in ""Mansfield Park"", the book, to suggest in any way that Mary Crawford was bisexual, although I can accept a defense that the director was trying to portray her as an amoral woman who would try to seduce anyone just to see if she could do it.
To my way of thinking, the best part of the movie came when Fanny was ordered to return to her birth family by her uncle (a deliciously creepy turn by Harold Pinter). After living in the comparative luxury of Mansfield Park since she was a young girl, O'Connor's Fanny is repulsed by the squalid conditions she finds at her old home. Her father (who seems to take a more than slightly unfatherly interest in his lovely daughter)is a drunkard, and her mother is harried and slovenly. It was a stroke of brillance on the part of the director to have the same actress portray Fanny's mother and aunt, who were, after all, sisters.
Even though the movie is not Jane Austen, and the politics of the director are hardly subtle, I still think the movie is worth viewing, primarily for the performances of O'Connor and Pinter. I think if you just try to forget that it is an adaptation of a classic work of English literature you will find the movie to be much more enjoyable.",1072396800,14,2010,4.61731843575419

With a little research, I can even appreciate that the movie attempts to dramatize the VERY subtle points Austen made about the abolition of the English slave trade in her time.

This isn't an adaptation, however. It's a movie with a few elements borrowed from a classic book.  A different title would have made the movie okay--not great, but okay.

Using the book's title means I expected an adaptation of the novel. I couldn't overcome the bait-and-switch betrayal in order to enjoy this for what it is, a sweet movie based on somebody's idea of Jane Austen's personality in a comedy of manners with some spicy interactions.  The sets are lush, the wardrobe lovely, and the cast is brilliant. But it misses the actual Mansfield Park by a mile.

If you enjoy the kind of book that features Jane Austen as a detective, etc. this may be the movie for you.  I hate that kind of liberty.

I confess I can't abide the original novel's Fanny Price--a shy, mingy, diffident little whimp who falls in love with stuffy Edmund out of gratitude for his gentle attention and who recoils in horror at anything vaguely naughty.  The movie heroine is a writer--witty, fun, even gleeful, certainly not Fanny Price.

1100476,4,6305892806,"Mansfield Park is the least favorite of Jane Austen's novels for me.  I always got the feeling that she was warring with her own impulses and instincts to come up with its proper, rather formal ending.  It feels like an ugly duckling growing phase in her oeuvre, so now we come to this film of the book.  Evidently they had the same problems so many of us did with Fanny Price's 'passivity ', so they tried to make her into a more shrewdly observant commentator like her creator was, which was an interesting approach.  ( I had seen the BBC version by the way in which Fanny seemed like the little shocked mouse radiating potent disapproval on an entire household, psychically manipulating others or trying to in the name of prudent conduct.)  By making Fanny more like Jane, they tried to make her more approachable, admirable, but a little of the subtleties of the family's interactions was lost - due to time demands in that format, which were inescapable in the novel and BBC version.  I did not mind that approach, except that it made it even more excruciating when Henry Crawford ( Alessandro Nivola ) turns up, flirts shamelessly with the Bertram sisters, only to recognize something better or more compelling about Fanny Price and to court her instead.  Mr. Nivola really brings that charming scoundrel to life, so much so that it is torture to watch Fanny accept and then reject him.  You sympathize more for him and you suddenly see why he would act out the way he does after Fanny's treatment of him.  In this casting, the performance itself on Mr. Nivola's part, and the choices of the filmmaker, this film shines a harsh light on what seemed like an unsatisfactory choice that Jane Austen made.  The original ending seems like a clinical imposition and the film reminds one of the road not taken.  The character of Edmund was wonderfully cast too, but still, and no one seems to have brought this up even in the book reviews, Edmund and Fanny are FIRST COUSINS.  I mean...EWWW!  (It makes one wish for a time machine, so one could go back and have a little chat about genetics and social taboos with Jane Austen.)  If you loved the novel as it was, then you won't like this movie.  If you found Henry Crawford beguiling in the novel, this movie will be a wonderful torment, until it becomes frustrating when Jane Austen's plot goes it's inevitable way.",1055289600,4,2365,4.624401913875598

I applaud any director who will use their own creative and conceptual knowledge to bring out an interpretation that is also relevent with today's times - it is a dialogue between the book, its history and the movie medium [see Women in Love]. Any reader of any book has a subjective opinion. I've read all of Austen's books EXCEPT for Mansfield Park [i have to admit i avoided it because i didn't like the heroine's name] and now because of this movie I am compelled to read the book. That in itself is a good thing - most movie adaptations of books these days make people read less - this makes me want to read more. Most Austen movie adaptations are predictable and somewhat fluffy and I'd be hard-pressed to believe that Austen herself would discourage her work to be remade with another concept in mind.

1100483,3,6305892806,"I am a huge Jane Austen fan, and have read all her books at least ten times. This must be clearly understood, or nothing useful can come from this review. (To paraphrase Dickens.)
Mansfield Park is probably the least well-loved of Austen's novels in general, and this is partly because the book is far more serious in tone than her other, more famous works (Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, and Northanger Abbey). The heroine, Fanny Price, rather than being healthy, hearty, lively and witty, is a bit weak and sickly of body, serious and studious of mind, and, frankly, a bit of a tedious old stick sometimes. Of all Austen's other characters, Fanny Price most closely resembles Mary Bennet from Pride & Prejudice, who was ridiculed even within her own family for being so serious, so studious, and so completely plain.
Fanny is not an easy character to identify with, or to love, particularly in this day and age of self-help books, support groups, and psychotherapy (all of which she would most likely be involved in were she alive today). She is highly judgmental (or so I found her), for she has extremely high standards of behaviour that her family are all too likely to fail to live up to, and in the novel she seems to serve primarily as a moral compass for the reader. She is also, however, timid to a fault. When she speaks her mind in public, which she is seldom able to do, given how she is treated by most of her family, she often speaks so gently that those who would most benefit from her message never even hear her words.
Given this, the task of bringing Fanny to life on film, would be a daunting one indeed. How to write a screenplay starring a completely un-heroic heroine? The obvious answer - perhaps the only answer - is to change the character of Fanny, and this is what the screenwriter did. In this film, Fanny is everything she is not in the book - funny, lively, healthy, firm, decisive, active, and a writer. (In the book, she is a reader.) She is engaging and easy to identify with. We cheer for her and want her to come out on top, as in the end she must.
The story of Mansfield Park so hinges on Fanny being exactly as Austen wrote her that, after seeing the trailer for the film, I watched the movie more from curiosity than interest. As a film, it is entertaining enough. The story is similar enough to Austen's to satisfy anyone with a taste for the period but no extensive knowledge of the novel, and the casting and acting is good, as I remember. As an adaptation of the work of one of the greatest authors in English literature, however, it falls far short of expectations raised by the excellent recent versions of several other Austen works, Pride and Prejudice (BBC 1995), Emma (also BBC), and Sense and Sensibility (with Emma Thompson). It is no more faithful an adaptation than the 1940 version of Pride and Prejudice (starring Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson), whose Lady Catherine disappointed me by being nice at the end.
The most jarring difference between the book and the movie, for me, was the reference to slaves providing the family's income. The eldest son's (Tom's) discovery and knowledge of exactly what has provided him with his comfortable life, is one of the movie's most dramatic, and certainly its most brutal, moments. In the book, Austen makes no reference whatsoever to what provides the family's income. She was, after all, a (mostly) gentle satirist about society and manners, and although she likely knew about slavery, there could be no need to mention it in her works of fiction. Indeed, in the book the prolonged absence of Sir Thomas Bertram (the story's other moral compass) seems engineered solely to allow his family to behave very badly indeed, and get themselves into such situations as could never have arisen had he been around, for life was very dull and predictable when he was around. There was no especial need for the destination to be Antigua; anywhere some weeks' distance away would have done just as well.
The injection of the modern sensibility of abhorrence of slavery seemed to me to be gratuitous, and an indication that, although he had a flair for the dramatic, the screenwriter had no particular understanding of or love for the original work, nor the patience to work through Austen's own plotline to the end. We did get there eventually, but I found this movie much less satisfying than the book.",1043884800,54,4405,4.670527670527671

1100602,4,6305892806,"""Mansfield Park"" might have been part of the wave of adaptations of Jane Austen novels that made the long dead British novelist one of the hottest writers in Hollywood for a couple of years, but this is a different sort of Jane Austen, perhaps best represented by the brief nudity of a pivotal scene.  Of course, writer-director Patricia Rozema makes no claims to be providing a faithful version of the novel, choosing instead to offer a credit that declares the film to be based on the novel along with passages from Austen's journals, letters, and early writings.  Consequently, ""Mansfield Park"" is transformed from a novel centered on a most serious debate about religion and religious duty into a concerted attack upon the British upper class, laid out against the central character's prospects for finding a husband.
The central character in question is Fanny Price (Frances O'Connor), a self-effacing young woman with flashing eyes and strong opinions, which she might put down on paper but would never say out loud.  As a young girl Fanny is sent by her mother from the family's squalid city hovel to live with the Bertrams, rich cousins living in the country at the titular manor.  Fanny has formed a strong bond of friendship with the youngest Bertram son, Edmund (Jonny Lee Miller), but is being urged to marry the young rake, Henry Crawford (Alessandro Nivola), by Sir Thomas Bertram (Harold Pinter).  Separated from her beloved sister (there is always a beloved sister for an Austen heroine), save for their letters, Fanny becomes friends with Henry's sister Mary (Embeth Davidtz), who has her own eye on Edmund.  Consequently ""Mansfield Park"" offers the standard sort of mismatched affection that is always at the heart of an Austen novel.
The director commentary by Rozema was most insightful because time and time again she claimed that scenes I considered suspect were taken from the novel.  There is a decidedly modern sensibility to the way relationships are portrayed in this film.  At various times we become convinced that Sir Thomas and Mary are both interested in Fanny in a sexual way.  Lady Bertram (Lindsay Duncan) is constantly taking laudanum, the oldest son is a drunken sot, and the family fortune is earned by slave labor in Antigua.  Most importantly, there is sex in this film, not just the prospect of romance.
Of course, the chief enjoyment of any Austen film is in rooting on our heroine, and O'Connor shines as Fanny.  We suffer as we watch the facade she puts on in public, knowing we have seen the real Fanny when she reads to us what she has written, and we wait patiently for the man she loves to come to the inevitable conclusion that the intelligent and moral Fanny is the only woman at Mansfield Park worth taking as a wife.  Pinter's performance as Lord Bertram is perfectly marvelous and Davidtz as the cold blooded Mary, whose solution to the climatic family crisis makes it abundantly clear she is the antithesis of Fanny, provides the other standout acting job in the film.
In the final analysis, I am content with the inventions Rozema has brought to Austen's novel.  After all, these novels are no more sacred texts than the writings of any other great author that has been given the Hollywood treatment.  Certainly Rozema is to be commended for the consistent vision she provides with her novel approach to adapting the novel.  The integration of young Austen's early novels (juvenile efforts that were never published in her life time) fits perfectly into the film's narrative.  Some Austen fans may not be pleased by these changes, but they will have to admit Rozema created them as an appreciation of the author.",1041811200,10,3667,4.880837359098229
1100603,3,6305892806,"It is really infuriating that Jane Austen's most profound book has been turned into two very frustrating movies.  This most recent film version of ""Mansfield Park"" has Frances O'Connor playing Fanny Price as we perhaps wished Austen had presented her.  She has some spirit; she's able to stand up for herself; she's much more her own person than she was portrayed in the BBC version.  The only problem is, this is not Austen's Fanny Price.  (Fanny was portrayed in the other extreme in the BBC version by Sylvestra LeTouzel; she was so whiny, holier-than-thou, judgemental and obnoxious in that film that we were left wondering what anyone could find attractive in this person.)

Not only is O'Connor's characterization not Austen's Fanny Price, this movie is not Austen's ""Mansfield Park"".  Patricia Rozema took some appalling liberties with Austen's book; here we have Lady Bertram as an opium addict, which is supposed to explain her perpetual indolence; Sir Thomas is Simon Legree redux, and Edmund, who at least had some personality in the BBC version, albeit a moralizing, sanctimonious snob, is little more than a cypher in this film.  And Mary Crawford, depicted by Austen as a kind, generous, sympathetic character, is shown here as nothing more than a conniving little gold-digger.

Austen tiptoed around the fact that the Bertram family's fortune came from the blood and toil of the slaves on the family's plantation in Antigua; Rozema shoves it right in the viewer's face with graphic images of Sir Thomas raping and abusing the hapless slaves.  Austen was well aware that the slave trade was an abomination, but she didn't go into it in her book, and it doesn't belong in any movie that purports to be based on the book.

Taken on its own, the film is a fairly enjoyable period piece, and Frances O'Connor is a winning heroine; but no way in the world does this movie deserve the title of ""Mansfield Park"".

1100604,5,6305892806,"As a woman who loves Jane Austen films, I knew I was going to like this film. But I was wrong. I loved it and would definately put it at the top of the best Austen adaptations. I use the term adaptation loosely since the film isn't exactly the same as the novel. It's better to think that the film used the Austen novel as a springboard. The story itself involves Fanny Price who goes to live at her rich relative's home at a young age. She becomes close with their son Edmund Bertram, and eventually grows to love him. But the arrival of the Crawford family seems to have made quite a mess of it. Edmund begins courting Mary Crawford, the older, worldly sister. Her brother Henry is attracted to the engaged Mariah Bertram, but eventually falls in love with Fanny. However, Fanny does not trust him and still longs for Edmund to return her love. It sounds like a soap opera but rises above this level because of it's wit and tantalizing characters. Frances O'Connor ('A.I.') and Jonny Lee Miller ('Trainspotting', very handsome) as Fanny and Edmund, share a boiling chemistry. Embeth Davidtz as Mary plays the part with obvious joy and zest. Alessandra Nivola as Henry also has the perfect mix of charm and danger about him. The direction is also marvelous with great period touches. The gorgeous English countryside becomes another character. Overall, it's not a great adaptation, but if you're like me and love period romance films, especially those with wit and charm, then see it, definately.",1038700800,8,1497,4.717557251908397
1100605,1,6305892806,Jane Austin wrote about society in the Nepolianic era no more and no less. to polititisise her works is to do them no justice. I have enjoyed many a film that was loosly based on her novels and if this movie had been give any other name I would have given it a highter rating. This story was not and I repeat was not Mansfield Park! not as Jane Austin wrote it anyways. Sence and Sensabilities took liberties but this was a all out fraud. watch the BBC mini series its production value leaves a lot to be desired but the interpertation was excelent and I enjoyed it a great deal.,1037577600,7,579,4.225225225225225
1100606,5,6305892806,"MANSFIELD PARK is the third film adaptation, after PRIDE & PREJUDICE and SENSE & SENSIBILITY, of a Jane Austen novel that I've been entreated to see by female acquaintances. Perhaps they're trying to refine my boorish character. Actually, while I've not read any of the Austen novels (nor do I intend to), I've enjoyed all three screen versions. There's hope for me yet, even at this late date.
This time around, our plucky heroine is Fannie Price, who, at the film's beginning at age 10, is sent by her parents from their flea-infested quayside hovel in Portsmouth to live with a pair of maternal aunts, Lady Bertram (Lindsay Duncan) and Mrs. Norris (Sheila Gish), at MANSFIELD PARK. Lady Bertram is married to the lord of the manor, Sir Thomas Bertram (Harold Pinter), and Mrs. Norris seems to be an integral part of Housekeeping. Fannie is to ""better herself"" among the family at the Great House, which includes Bertram's sons, Edmund (Jonny Lee Miller) and Tom (James Purefoy) and daughters, Julia (Victoria Hamilton) and Maria (Justine Waddell). Very soon the script jumps forward several years to 1806, and Fannie is now a young woman (played by Frances O'Conner). By this time also, Maria is engaged to a dull but congenial local chap, Mr. Rushworth (Hugh Bonneville).
Fannie is pretty much unimpressed by her residence among the landed gentry, and her wit, which she sometimes addresses to the camera (a nice touch to the film), is sharp. As she says of living at MANSFIELD PARK, ""Life seems nothing more than a quick succession of busy nothings."" One day, these ""busy nothings"" turn steamier with the arrival of the Crawfords, a brother/sister act, Henry (Alessandro Nivola) and Mary (Embeth Davidtz), who are there to rent out a nearby cottage. The film's best scene is perhaps when the Crawfords are ushered into the parlor where Fannie and the Bertrams are gathered while Sir Thomas and Tom, Jr. are off on a jolly inspecting the family's plantation in Antigua. One could hear a pin drop as the lens focuses on the faces of Lady Bertram, Mrs. Norris, Julia and Maria as their eyes fasten on the Gorgeous Hunk Henry, and on Mary's as she scrutinizes young Edmund. The look each demonstrates is the same I might show when stumbling across an especially fine piece of steak at the meat counter. Very soon, emotions run high. Maria has the hots for Henry, but he's obsessed with Fannie, who continues in her long standing love of Edmund, who may or may not return the feeling but is momentarily distracted by the admiring flirtations of the alluring Mary. It's the usual Austen Regency soap opera with its attendant crises d'amour.
For me, the considerable appeal of MANSFIELD PARK lies somewhere between that of P&P and S&S, the former having the highest (because of a greater length that allowed for varied and fuller character development). The vulnerable yet strong-willed Price is wonderfully likable, especially when she (both as the 10-year old and the young adult) delivers her asides to the viewing audience with wry humor and a mischievous smile. And, unlike the other two Austen epics mentioned, MANSFIELD PARK has a truly sharp edge revolving around the enslaved Blacks on the Bertrams' Antiguan property. Fannie is cut by this one day when she discovers some eye-opening sketches made by the younger Tom of events back on the plantation. No scene of such intensity was ever part of the cinematic P&P or S&S, and it's startling because it's so unexpected. It's an effective counterpoint to the gentility of Fannie's present environment.
If I have it right, there are one or two more Austen novels on film, plus at least one by Charlotte Bront, that I'm being pressured to view. How much does a Neanderthal have to endure to evolve into a New Age Sensitive Fella?",1036540800,21,3782,4.865116279069768

I have watched it several times, and I never tire of it. Even though I know the ending, I still find myself waiting in suspense.
I love period movies, and this one is wonderful, full of subtilities and things implied but not necessarily spoken, much like it would have been in the ""proper"" times it is set. Even after many viewings I still find I pick up on things I missed before.

What made these Hollywood victims think their little dogmas and anachronisms were improvements on the incomparable genius of Austen's favourite (and possibly most profound) novel?
Missed the point entirely, omitting the highly significant symbolism (eg. Maria's scene at the garden gate).  Generally clueless, extraordinarily annoying, frustrating (such a lot of money down the drain, and we still don't have a decent MP adaption), and insulting.

1100609,5,6305892806,"Well, this movie, while not exactly like the book, does capture the essence of what I think Jane Austen wanted to convey.  I've read all of her books and there is always a little bit of cynicism and satire of the upper class society in them.  I think Fanny was well portrayed, though not entirely as like she was in the book.  I do think that it was a good move on the part of the screen writer to make her more confident as she matured though, that is usually how most people are anyway.  Bertram was portrayed rather well, as were most of the characters.  I think that a little more time should have been spent on Edward though, he was, after all, the love of Fanny's life.
As a portrayal of life at that time, I found it to be excellent.  It brought up many points in history that were issues at the time.
Overall, I'd have to say that I'd recommend the movie to anyone who loves Jane Austen.  One must be forgiving to screen writers when it comes to turning a book into a movie.  Some plots are just too intricate.  I think as long as the essence of what the author was trying to express is there, there's no harm is taking creative license.",1030320000,5,1145,4.191780821917808
1100610,4,6305892806,"While I felt Mansfield Park was not one of Jane Austen's best books, I felt that the movie was so different that many could be disappointed and insulted with it. I would have been thoroughly insulted as well, but I watched it as if it was just another movie. It was a very well done movie, better than most movies out there, however do not watch it if you think movies should not be changed at all or very much.
Pride and Prejudice (1995) was a six hour movie, but this was only 2 hours, and I understand the need to cut out several parts of the book. But parts such as the play were not included in the great detail it was in the book, because it happened to be a big part of the book.
Characters- Sir Thomas was not, in my opinion, a person who would think of incest towards his niece! In the movie she made it out that he was a villain but in the book when he noticed fanny's change, fanny had thought that she regretted not loving him enough and wishing him to not return home, he did not look at her in a way that was less than decent.
Fanny- way too confident, not weak enough, and while placing jane austen's juvenalia was an interesting concept it changed much of fanny's personality, making her much more opinionated.
Mary Crawford-in the movie she seemed to be bisexual and attracted to fanny, she was not at all like that in the book.
Edmund-ignored throughout the movie. I actually wanted Fanny to end up with crawford in the movie! And when she ended up with edmund I could hardly care less.
She also changed other characters but I'm sure other reviewers made comments about that already.
She never ever accepted the proposal! That's all I have to say.
The commentary is interesting however it confused my opinion on what I thought the book was. Reading other reviews I see that she misinterpreted the book heavily.

The movie is wonderfully done and highly entertaining, though it is not an exact representation of the novel.  I find the other reviews interesting.  It's true that Patricia Rozema took some liberties with this adaptation, but I certainly don't agree with some other reviewers that the only similarity between the book and the movie are the names of the characters.  It is the same story, though the screenplay's Fanny Price is based more on Rozema's interpretation of what Jane Austen herself may have been like.  She gives Fanny the thoughts, emotions and writings of Jane Austen herself.  If you have the time, watch the commentary by Rozema on the DVD.  It really explains her interpretation of the novel and includes many facts about Jane Austen's life.  The BBC's Pride & Prejudice, very true to the novel and very enjoyable for me, moves too slowly for the average moviegoer and is too long to watch at one sitting.

I could write many more things that I disliked about the movie, but it is not worth my time.  It is not worth the money to rent it, let alone buy it.

Since I know the book well, I could not really tell what the video would be like for someone unfamiliar with the story.  But it seemed to me that it must seem quite incoherent.  The Price character is certainly incoherent - one minute docile, the next impertinent, one minute cynical and the next ready with  a conservative moralism.  She is cold and cruel enough to sneer at her aunt's drug use, and to her younger sister (can you imagine such behavior in an Austen heroine!!!), and then we are to believe her the most virtuous and kind and of the tenderest conscience.
Unsatisfied with the staunch, consistent, quiet, gallant and unsensational courage of Austen's character, these folks had to make her cutely coy and clever and for good measure (in case anybody might get bored with English country manners I guess) had to throw in a subtheme of the evils of slavery.  Seldom have I seen so silly and useless a scene as the one where Fanny suddenly finds on her cousin's sickbed (where did it come from?) a large sketchbook full of scenes of slaves (her uncle's one presumes) being tortured and raped - by her uncle, amongst others.  And poor Cousin Tom, is transformed sentimentally into a gallant idealist emotionally crippled by his discovery of the source of Dad's evilly gained riches.  Oh please.  Austen was brilliant, this is rubbish.  Can people not tell, and refrain from trashing her?  Does the aunt have to be made an opium addict?  Yes, people abused it back then, just like people had slaves in the West Indies back then, but can't we do without drug abuse and gross violence for a couple of hours?
Get the BBC video starring Sylvestra Le Touzel, it is immeasureably better.  I found her characterization of Fanny Price faithful and yet never insipid, as her rather prudish moralizings risk seeming to people today.

Movies made from books are always an interpretation of the text. Mansfield Park was a lushious, emotional film that transports one into 19th century England and makes you long to be part of that world.
It is well acted and beautifully photographed. It provides us with what most of us are looking for in a good, dramatic film. A well crafted story with characters that we can truly care for.
It is a temptation to be an armchair critic and deride the film for its independance of the original story. But that defeats one of the primary purposes of film. A film such as this can make us forget our cinicism and take us on a journey (if we are willing to go along for the ride).

My biggest problem with the movie was that everyone's personality was so different from what was in writing. Fanny is definitely not at all like the Fanny Price of the novel. Instead of the quiet and shy woman you find in the novel, she's outspoken and bold and somewhat too headstrong and rebellious for my liking. Some people may find this version of Fanny more appealing, but I must admit that I love the sweet and shy Fanny from the novel so much better. I did not enjoy the movie's portrayals of Lord and Lady Bertram either; their respective vices and quirks were greatly exaggerated, leading to very hateable and annoying people. I also found the over-emphasis on the dealings in Antigua was very distracting and unnecessary in moving the movie along.

I will admit that there were some funny scenes in this version.  Likewise, I'll admit that the novel is a little slow.  However the few inventive scenes and the need to speed the story up for the screen don't excuse totally abandoning Jane Austen's novel.
Its hard for me to judge, but maybe, standing on its own and apart from Jane Austen's excellent book, this might be a good movie. However, it clearly was not designed to stand on its own.  It was designed to capitalize on Austen's popularity and reputation.
As for my specific problems.  After watching this version, I reread the book.  There is exactly 1 explicit reference to slavery.  Its not mentioned as a good thing or a bad thing.  We're simply told that Fanny asked her uncle a question about the slave trade.  That's it.  From that, the movie extrapolates an entire subplot.  Let me go on record now as saying that slavery was a horrible institution and a blight on the history of man.  It was not, however, an important part of Jane Austen's novels.  If you want to make an historical romance with a subplot condemning slavery, fine.  But don't pretend its the same story as an excellent Jane Austen novel that was unconcerned with slavery.
In the book, one of the defining elements of Fanny's character was her relationship with her brother William.  In this version, No William.  To be honest, this didn't bother me as much when I first watched the movie.  I then reread the book (twice) and realized just how much his absence costs the story.
Jane Austen's Fanny was a sweet, mild tempered girl with a strong sense of right and wrong.  However, she was also terribly shy and completely unaware of her own worth.  In this version, Fanny is a strong-willed, confident young woman unafraid to speak her mind.  As a heroine in a movie thats fine.  As Fanny Price, its terribly wrong.  In fact, after reading Jane Austen's brief history of england(by a partial, prejuciced, and ignorant historian) [sound familiar-if not, early in this movie Fanny writes a book by the same title] I got the distinct impression that the purpose of this movie was not to portray Fanny.  Instead, this story seems to be an attempt to take someone' idea of what Jane Austen was like and insert Jane, as a character, into one of her own stories.  I've heard of worse ideas for a movie then inserting an author into her own story, but again, that is not how this movie was portrayed, nor was it ever explicitly stated.
Many of the other characters also strayed from Jane Austen's form.  Perhaps, most notable, Sir Thomas.  Jane Austen's Sir Thomas, while somewhat cold and reserved, nonetheless was a kind man at heart who clearly cared for his children and Fanny. (And William as well.)  In this version, he is none of that.

This one, however, completely changes the dialog and personality of the main character (and other characters); it adds disturbing scenes of a sexual nature that are completely gratuitous; and the only relationship this movie has to the novel are the names of the characters, and possibly the setting.

This is an elitist view from a bunch of purists who don't have a grasp of what film making is supposed to be about.  In the beggining titles the movie blatantly states that the movie is based on the book ""Mansfield Park"" by Jane Austen as well as her own life.
 Mansfield Park is a story about a young girl Fanny Price who goes to live with her rich relatives.  But instead of being accepted by her relatives as one of their own.  She is mostly used as domestic help especially by her Aunt Norris (a character which JK Rowling borrowed in Harry Potter)whose only esteem in the entire movie comes from bullying poor Fanny.  The only person who is kind to Fanny is her cousin Edmund.  Fanny grows actually to fall in love with Edmond but can do nothing about it because they are out of each others social circle. During the course of the movie a diletante brother and sister moves into the neighborhood and have wide spread reprocussions on Fanny and Edmond. There is also a bit of social commentary on slavery and how the family supports iself. Tom's drawing of the treatment of the slaves are horrifying, but true to form. African slaves who were brought to the Americas were treated worse than animals, and it is remarkable how this has not been addressed yet.
  I really enjoyed this movie very much.  Not so much from the story itself but from the solid acting and the feelings that are shown.  I especially loved Francis O'Connor (Fanny) and Alexandro Nivola (Henry) I think that they had very strong chemistry and played well to each other.  The only problem I had was tha the ending was way too contrived, The makers seemed to give Henry a blatant flaw simply to throw Fanny and Edmond together.
If are looking for a dissertation on Mansfield Park then perhaps this movie is not for you. You might do much better taking an English Litterature class.  But on the other hand if you are looking for a good costume Drama with solid acting, then don't miss Mansfield Park.",1010534400,5,2079,4.5
1100893,2,6305892806,"It looked promising when it started. A little done-up, but promising. I was very curious to see how they would pull it off, considering when I read Mansfield Park it seemed to me to be the novel of Austen's least likely to become a movie. Silly me, the thought didn't even occur to me that they would completely change the characters and theme of the book. I could understand why they did what they did, making Fanny trendier and so ahead of her time (many people probably tricked themselves into thinking this was how she was really written originally) and some of the changes would have even worked, such as delicately omitting the fact that Fanny and Edmund are cousins (I can already hear the 'ewww!'s) and making Fanny's sister her distant beloved sibling instead of her brother. But the whole 'slavery is so bad' thing was the cherry on top. Of course it was terrible, but it was so obviously not a major aspect of the book and personally I don't think Fanny would have been terribly bothered by it. The thought of the sketches she found still makes me shake my head and sigh, and don't get me started on Mr. Crawford and Maria in bed...I almost turned it off. I have to go back to what I always say: If only Emma Thompson would write all of Austen's novels! Sense and Sensibility was just a bunch of people in drawing rooms and it was touching, romantic, funny and completely beautiful. It is the only good Austen film I've seen yet that did so well exactly what Austen is famous for doing so well: making one really care about the small problems of a few small people.

1100894,3,6305892806,"They say the great thing about Shakespeare's work is that it is so open to interpretation. Every director can bring his or her fresh eyes to a play and make it new. Even so, I think we are obliged to stay true to the basic tennents of the text. Are the works of Jane Austen as open to interpretation? Maybe, but I doubt it; Certainly not if MANSFIELD PARK is anything to go by.
MANSFIELD was always my favourite of Austen's six novels. Many modern critics, while not denying its basic greatness, have problems with the book. Many find FANNY PRICE unlikeable, many find her judgemental, and feel that her Stoic, Augustan approach is hard to relate to. Stand-by, do nothing, and eventually he'll see the error of his ways and come to love you. Not very modern, is it?
OK, so if you don't like the main character, if you don't like what she has to say, then what do you do? Look for other aspects of the story you can relate to. In recent years some critics have chosen to see MANSFIELD PARK in Post-Imperial terms, as a critique of Slavery. After all, the family's wealth is based on plantations in Antiga, which were run by slaves. Is that what the book's about? Is it? I don't know. I think the evidence is a little slim, but who am I to deny the possibility? Maybe it plays a part in the subtext of the novel.
So, I'm a modern script-writer who doesn't like the novel, it's pre-occupations or even Fanny Price. What do I do? I completely re-write the story to take a possible minor sub-text (slavery) and turn it in to the driving narrative force. I then take smart as a whippet, stubborn yet passive Fanny and turn her into a ballsy version of Bridget Jones. With an attitude. I then string together a couple of scenes from the book with a few invented bridging scenes to advance the romance. Et Voila! I have a completely different story!
I don't know what this film is, but it isn't Mansfield Park. Enjoy it on its own terms, but don't ever get the idea that your watching Austen on the screen. But, jeeze. I think that if you're going to adapt a novel for the screen, you ought to at least like the source material; Otherwise, what's the point? If you don't like the main character, you shouldn't be able to completely re-invent her. Or if you do, you should have the decency to be a little ashamed.",1009152000,53,2304,4.372960372960373

I liked Fanny Price because of her sharp wit and I remember this line from the video. Susie, Fanny's sister said that ""Your tongue is as sharp as a gullitine."" I agree, although I wish that Fanny would stand up more for herself because she was pushed around by Mrs. Norris.
It was sort of confusing and I got the characters mixed up, but other than that, I really enjoyed the video.

The references to the social situation and slavery are very well integrated and I think it's about time someone allowed this aspect to come out of these stories, since Jane Austen does give--albeit hidden--allusions to these issues in the parlor conversation. On the other hand, the excuses given to the oldest son of a spoiled aristocratic family are a bit much. In her books, Jane Austen doesn't judge her characters as much as the screenwriters appear to. In addition, I could not give it 5 stars because I don't completely believe in the actors -- that they really understand the period or even their parts. It is truly a modern re-telling that perhaps might have been better put into a modern setting. I'm keeping my BBC version for now (it's much more like the book).",1006992000,,1025,4.637362637362638
1100898,5,6305892806,"I've read some of the reviews here and I cannot believe how much people missed out on the point of the movie and became so nit picky. I believe that Rozema's point was to take Jane Austen's life and intermix it with the one novel that was close to her actual experiences. Yes, it does stray fromt the original novel, but I don not see why that has to be a bad thing.
 As for the slavery and adultery issues, some reviewers are talking as if it never happened back then. It did. Jane Austen just couldn't write about it as explicitly. I think it adds credibility to the times the story is told in, not leading people to believe that everything was light-hearted and romantic. These people did earn their living from slavery and Ms. Rozema did an admirable and brave thing to bring that up. No, it isn't resolved at the end completely, but then slavery wasn't abolished until after the time period of the movie, so it's not that big of a deal.
 Bottom Line: the movie was well done. Frances O'Connor, Jonny Lee Miller, and the rest of the cast do an outstanding job. The movie should be taken as being ""inspired"" by Jane Austen's ""Mansfield Park"", not as a page by page copy. A movie never beats reading the book, whether it does follow it strictly or not, so the two should be able to stand on their own.

Now, I must admit it has been far too many years since I read the novel to be able to determine how far it may stray from the original. To be sure, I do remember that there is an episode of adulterous behavior in the book, which is usually NOT what goes on in Austen! Austen typically is concerned with whether young ladies are being ""cut"" or not; that is, whether they are being snubbed by their social superiors. The slave trade aspect seems a little unlikely, though I'd have to re-read to state so more emphatically.
I will tell you that the single biggest surprise, and the part I personally enjoyed most, was the portrayal of Sir Thomas Bertram by the playwright Harold Pinter. What a masterful performance! He sweeps aside the other male characters and has incredible animal magnetism. I was quite disappointed that Pinter was not even nominated for an Oscar for this role; as far as I was concerned, he walked away with the picture.
That's not to say, though, that the other actors were not good. i thought that the double role of Aunt Lady Bertram/Mrs. Price was done very well, and that serpentine portrayal of Mary Campbell was ingeniously served--she reminded me very much of Kiri te Kanawa. I could have fallen in love myself with the fellow playing Henry Campbell, and I think I would have chosen him without having to go off to a sea-side pigsty to think it over, like our heroine.
Perhaps a bit heavy on the suggestion of lesbianism, however, which is also not very Austen-like either and not needed to create interest.

1100980,2,6305892806,"A bizarre reworking of Jane Austen's most carefully nuanced novel. Rozema's ""Mansfield Park"" is a wholly different work than its namesake.

Admittedly, Fanny Price has been a difficult character for many readers to admire, but Patricia Rozema goes so far in her hatred for Fanny that she has removed the poor thing from her own life story.

Austen's Mansfield Park is tale of Morality.  In a sense,  Rozema retains this focus, but has transposed the moral quandary into a kind of fancy-dress present day topicality, dropping the central dramatic moment of the novel, namely Fanny's redemption of the wavering Edmund.  If it were not for this redemption the novel truly would have been inexplicable, and so is Rozema's film inexplicable in consequence of ignoring it.

The screenplay of this ""Mansfield Park"" is self-evidently based, not on Austen's novel itself, but rather on essays >about< the novel from the 1998 Norton Critical Edition, most particularly upon Edward Said's ""Jane Austen and Empire"".  Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley's ""A Vindication of the Rights of Women"" is also collected in that volume.

The strange imposition of turgid images of the repression of a West Indian slave rebellion--sketched with Leonardo (DiCaprio)-esque skill -- by the now somehow damaged and misunderstood Tom Bertram, the selfish rake of the original; Sir Thomas's putative lechery toward his niece (this played with relish by a slobbering Harold Pinter); and Fanny's abrupt flowering, not as the anchor and conscience of the family, but as a sexy young authoress, are highlights of Rozema's unfortunately all-too-literal dramatization of these secondary sources.",997228800,9,1653,5.37984496124031

So far I've read and seen the most recent BBC version of ""Pride and Prejudice""--a bit of a slow start I'll admit lol I did get most of her books from the library though and am actually reading ""Mansfield Park"" right now. It's definitely slow compared to P & P, but good enough to keep reading. The movie is kind of chop-sockey, incorporating things from the book in random order with no real point, especially the whole slavery thing. In defense of the movie though, at least it moves a lot faster than the book and while I'm only half way through, it's amazing what Frances O'Connor has down with the character of Fanny Price. I actually liked the Fanny in the movie, the Fanny in the book on the other hand is such a simpering goody-goody moron I want to slap her. Sorry, but she feels evil about the stupidest things, and while those around her ARE corrupt at least they have fun. Example : When Edmund asks for her opinion on something, Fanny gasps and goes ""My opinion"" like it's the grandest honor next to being invited for tea with the queen. Must admit that my favorite character in the movie was Henry Crawford; I felt sorry when Fanny rejected him, and I'll probably hate her in the book for it, but in the movie I could see why she did it. She had no way of knowing whether his affections were truly sincere or would stay that way. Worth watching if you're an Austen fan and not nearly as boring as the book, but not great. I have no idea why Fanny Price was one of Jane Austen's favorite heroines though; Emma was a little irritating in her over-perfectness, but not nearly as annoying and Elizabeth Bennet is definitley my favorite thusfar. The whole reason her and Mr. Darcy were perfect for eachother was because they saw the superficialness in their society and what they said wasn't as important as the underlying meaning of their words. Fanny Price on the other hand would NEVER say or think anything bad against anyone without feeling that she should get down on her knees and pray intensely for forgiveness.",996364800,7,2127,4.498708010335918

1100984,1,6305892806,"How absurd that modern filmmakers feel that the public could not possibly understand the classics without their help. Austen is the ONLY classic author whose entire collection is still in full circulation - an indication that generations later, the audience still ""gets it"". Hollywood has endlessly held the notion that they have greater artistic and creative powers in their peabrains than the authors whose books have passed through millions of hands for decades.
This version of Mansfield Park is, for the time, the most bloodstirring adaptation in existence - due to the contraversial retelling. In my opinion, the only consistencies are the names and bits and pieces of the storylines. Frances O'Connor gives an amazing performance considering the fact that she has nothing to work with - she is the gem and only point that makes the film worth watching. However, Fanny is no longer Fanny at all - the director has completely reinvented her. The most appalling sequence was the one in which Fanny accepts Henry's proposal. The chances of this happening in the novel are so absolutely impossible that I thought that this was some sort of dream sequence. In the novel, Fanny (whom the director actually shows getting smashed at a party given to her by the Bertrams - imagine Lizzie Bennet, Emma, or any of her other noble creatures portrayed in this manner) knows intuitively from the beginning that Henry shows enormous lack of character and NEVER for a moment considers accepting any of his attentions. The fact that she does so in the film is an enormous flaw and shows the director's complete misunderstanding of Austen's heroine.
Also, the pivotal chapters in Mansfield surround the play and through it, our players true characters are revealed(Austen's own midsummer night if you will). Fanny is the innocent one - set apart during this whole section of the book by her wisdom and naivete. I was shocked when the film skimmed it for only a moment.
The ""sketch book scene"" was, without a doubt, too great a liberty to take with the work of a classic author, as is the entire storyline that corresponded with it. I'm sure we all understand the vulgarity of slavery without needing to see it graphically displayed in a format that Austen herself would refuse to watch. Austen understood something the director of this film does not: subtlety.
Finally, the most distressing scene to me was the moment after Henry and Mariah are discovered together. Rather than seeing our leading man and lady in a state of anger over what they've discovered, we see Fanny and Edmund aroused by the moment, grasping for each other and then ashamed by their own reaction. HELLLO! What is that?
And for anyone that didn't catch the sexual innuendo in the scene where Mary is helping Fanny out of her wet clothes - I have to ask what planet they're from. There was no Edmund standing nearby to arouse in that scene. Oh, and I almost forgot, the director adds such a nice touch to the character of Fanny's father by making him a pervert as well - clutching at his daughters in a way that makes your stomach turn.
Without a doubt, this film lacks Jane Austen's wit and wisdom. It disgusts me that it is considered some sort of tribute to her. Mansfield Park is considered by many to be Austen's greatest work - grand and subtle. Fanny's complex character is lost here, as well as everything that Austen was trying to say through her. This film has reduced this masterpiece to nothing more than the poor story of an unfortunate girl surrounded by perverts. But are we really shocked? Hollywood's idea to make anything better is - just add sex. From now on, I think I'll stick with the BBC.",993686400,39,3671,4.773584905660377
1100985,2,6305892806,"This movie SEEMS to be Mansfield Park.  The characters have all the right names, the action has a superficial resemblance to that of the novel, but there all similarities end!
This is a very modern Mansfield Park, regardless of the early 19th century setting.  Viewers are caught up in a tale of the evils of slavery and the value of women's scholarship.  Not exactly the focus of the novel!
There are some redeeming features.  The costuming is beautiful; Mr. Rushworth, Julia, and Maria are gratifyingly self-absorbed and absurd; the differences between the Price and Bertram households are well-drawn.  Austen fans will enjoy quotes from Fanny's writing:  they are taken from the early stories of Austen herself.
However, the makers of this movie have made Fanny Price a very different sort of creature from the novel.  Blooming and beautiful, sometimes sharp-tongued, she has little in common with the character in the novel.
The director has chosen to introduce elements not present in the novel.  Sir Thomas, for example, due to a family business in trading slaves (never mentioned in the original), has gone from a dignified, rather stuffy but honorable man in the novel, to a degraded and rather disturbing man in the film.  In the movie, he looks Fanny up and down as if she is a slave for sale, and arranges the famous ball of the novel as a way of ""selling"" her in marriage.  And having brought in the anti-slavery subplot, the director simply dismisses it at the end, saying ""Sir Thomas eventually gave up his interests in Antigua.""
Sharply lacking is any of the satiric eye Austen cast on society.  We are given the melodrama, but little of Austen's sharp wit.  Very few of Aunt Norris' snobby ways have made it into the movie; the great scenes involving the ""improvements"" at Sotherton are missing.  Fanny's brother William is missing entirely.
Why bother to even mention this is based on an Austen novel?  There is little enough resemblance.",993686400,412,1955,4.884848484848485
1100986,3,6305892806,"This is not really an adaptation of Jane Austen's novel, it's more along the lines of fan fiction; it has most of the original characters, but they've been down the rabbit hole, eaten a few mushrooms, and come out all bent out of their original shapes.
Fanny Price has been changed the most, and some will say that's a good thing.  In the novel, she's withdrawn and self-effacing, as you would expect, given her situation.  Having been separated from her family as a child, taken in by rich relatives as a charity case, and reminded daily of her inferiority by her mean-spirited Aunt and snooty female cousins, would she really have grown up to be the self-confident, assertive young woman we see in this adaptation?  I don't think it's very likely, and neither did Jane Austen.  Nevertheless, the new, ""improved"" Fanny plays better to a modern audience, so that's who we've got as our heroine -- but it wreaks havoc with the plot, doesn't it?  Would this Fanny be truly happy with the introspective, serious Edmund?  She almost seems a better match for the fractious Henry Crawford.
Not only the characters have changed; there's an addition to the plot as well.  The moral issue of slavery, not even addressed in the novel, is tossed in, seemingly on a whim.  I could almost give credit to the director for trying something daring and thought-provoking, if only it had been handled with a little more finesse, but this wasn't.  What's worse, the entire issue was left unresolved.  It felt as if the director merely added the slavery sub-plot to bring some excitement to an otherwise sedate story, then abandoned it.  I thought it was tacky, and couldn't see any real added value (aside from those lovely sketches - blechh).
In the end, I sort of enjoyed this movie... but only AFTER I'd given up comparing it to the book.  Important events seemed rushed, which you'd expect with only 2 hours to get things wrapped up, but the main points were touched on, and it all works out pretty much the same.  This is Mansfield Park as seen through Patricia Rozema's looking glass, and it's only a dim, wavy reflection of the real thing.",993686400,14,2127,4.7008086253369274
1100987,4,6305892806,"Austen purists will undoubtedly tsk-tsk away at Patricia Rozema's adaptation of this classic.  Well, let them.  It may not be exactly what Austen wrote, but it is still a very worthwhile film.
The somewhat heavy-handed treatment of slavery and frank portrayal of sexuality and infidelity may make some Austenites squirm, as these issues were really only hinted at in the novel.  In Austen's time, a mere mention that a family was involved in business in Bristol or had perplexing interests in Antigua was enough to indicate their involvement in the slave trade.
But modern audiences aren't always as acute to subtleties such as this.  Thus, Rozema's film practically hits you over the head with it, making sure you understand just how the Bertram family gets their money.
Then there's the issue of sex.  Miss Austen would never have been published had she revealed any sexual details, and Austen film adaptations have followed suit, rarely showing more than a chaste kiss.  Although the heroine's (Fanny Price) love affair remains pure, Rozema makes sure that the audience understands the illicit affair between Maria Bertram and Henry Crawford by having Fanny walk in on them in the act.
No, it's not the way Austen wrote it, but we aren't living in Austen's time.  And the film is not a complete perversion of the original work.
The formal diction and manners remain the same; the characters are, for the most part, very true to the novel, and the underlying themes still come through strongly.  This is what matters.
Furthermore, the acting is superior.  Frances O'Connor gives Fanny Price a much sharper tongue than the character in the novel, but she still portrays Fanny's extreme self-consciousness, honesty, and unworldliness.  Jonny Lee Miller's Edward Bertram is not as dashing as a Mr. Darcy, but neither is the character.  His Edward is honorable, sweet, shy, and discerning, and a perfect match for O'Connor's modest Fanny.  Lindsay Duncan is excellent in the dual roles of the wealthy opium-addict Lady Bertram and her poverty-stricken sister Mrs. Price, showing two extremes of female fate in Austen's time.
What this film shows is that Austen still can be adapted for a modern audience.  It attests to Austen's sustainability as a novelist (as if that was a point necessary to argue), that the story can be subjected to the indelicacies of a contemporary film and still make an impact with its themes and characters.",992822400,15,2432,5.019900497512438

I enjoyed this movie because it did not hide the ugliness of class prejudice and it had the courage to show that love can win in the end.  Very charming movie with much talent and beautiful scenery.

This movie is much different than the book, but still follows the same storyline and character relationships.  The main character, Fanny Price is much different than the book.  In the book she is quiet, polite, and shy.  In the movie she is strong, independent, and spiritied.  I personally think that the movie's personality for Fanny fits her better.
This movie is charming and elegant and still managed to throw in tons of humor!  I love it when a movie has the ability to do that!  This movie boasts a strong cast of young actors before they were well known including Frances O' Connor (Artificial Inteliigence), Alessandro Nivola (Jurassic Park III), and Jonny Lee Miller (Dracula 2000).

The director seemed to have a general lack of regard for the sensibilities of the period. The overall effect was the fractured feeling that the movie couldn't decide in which century it wanted to reside.

The director actually had the audacity to try to improve on Jane Austen, which just cannot be done.  The story line has been twisted, the costumes and hairstyles are mediocre at best (especially Edward's!), and the graphic sexual scene is completely uncalled for and inappropriate.  Jane Austens novels have a pervading modesty and the director just ignored that.  Also, the business about slavery was totally out of place.  Use your money on something else -- like the BBC's joint effort with A&E of ""Pride & Prejudice"", which is a truly wonderful film adaption of an Austen Novel.",987984000,12,675,4.87719298245614

Fanny Price in the novel was irritatingly vapid and by the end I didn't care one way or another what happened to her.  In my opinion what happened, bad or otherwise, was her own fault.  After reading it I was unimpressed by it, after ""Pride and Prejudice"" anyone would be.  So I'll rate this movie on its worth alone.  I believed the acting to be superb, the characters were relatively three dimensional and as in any good movie I started to feel for them.  Frances O'Connor as Franny, the soft-spoken, passionate heroin was perfect.  She gave the right amount of placity and sauciness to the character.  Johnny Lee Miller as Edmund was irresistable with the combination of shyness and passion hidden in his character.  I found I didn't have the heart to hate Alessandro Nivola as Mr. Crawford because he seemed so pitiful and forlorn.  Embeth Davitz brought a perfect amount of immorality to Mary Crawford and made her irritating but perfectly played.  Amoung the cast of relatively secondary characters were some hilarious and touching portrayals of the other inhabitants of the estate.  Sir Bertram's reformation is an example.  Fanny deserves to earn the admiration of Edmund and her secondary family and her morality makes her admirable, but it's morality to an extent and doesn't cross the line into being annoying and trying for the viewer.  It's true that the climax of Mary Crawford's defense of her brother isn't truly shocking, but it does bring a cruel depth to the character that's enough to change most previous opinions about her.  True, a few parts of the movie do make me want to fast-forward for a scene but the overall movie is an engrossing portrayal of another era long-gone.

1101083,1,6305892806,"- It is understood that a screenwriter must be allowed some lattitude in adapting an author's work, in order to accomodate the necessary differences between film and the printed page.  However, it is to be hoped that the rendition of a great classic will bear some resemblance to the original.  For Patricia Rozema, it would appear that it was sufficient to borrow some of the names of Austen's characters, and very little else.
Young student's hoping to utilize this film as an easy substitute for a book report will be quickly discovered, for Rozema has significantly altered the unfolding of events, and has omitted several important characters as well.
While Rozema's Miss Price is very appealing to modern tastes, she certainly does not suffer the painful shyness which pervades the very being of Austen's heroine, and thus we are denied the full impact of Fanny's eventual triumph.
Rozema has concocted her own version of the story which adds a social message about the evils of slavery.  What she has created is not without merit.  For those who have never read Austen, it makes for a very satisfying film, but Rozema should take full credit for it's authorship and thank Jane Austen only for her inspiration.
For those who wish to see something more closely in harmony with Austen's novel, the 1986 BBC version (currently available only in VHS) will prove far more satisfactory.  It is interesting that the more authentic version claims to be ""Based on the Novel by Jane Austen, Dramatized by Ken Taylor"" while the jacket of Rozema's DVD loudly proclaims that this is ""The Story Jane Austen Loved Best.""
Were this film to be judged solely on its own merit it should probably rate four stars, but for its pretense to claim Austen's authorship, I cannot give it more than one.",984268800,36,1782,4.848684210526316

O'Connor is a promising find, but she is unevenly directed here.  Alessandro Nivola, however, is the quintessential Henry Crawford: tortured by his first venture into a love of the heart.  Nivola flawlessly depicts a man who has never had to practice restraint, or hear the word ""No"" in response to anything he has truly desired.

However, if, like me, you don't like to miss out on ANY romantic period drama with a beautiful cast and costumes, then you may want to pick up this video.
PLUS POINTS of the movie as I see it:-
1) great chemistry between the heroine, Fanny Price and her 2  suitors i.e. Henry Crawford (or ""the rake"", as Fanny calls  him) and Edmund Bertram (the kind cousin whom Fanny secretly  loves). I personally enjoy the scenes involving Fanny and  Henry Crawford (rake or no rake) because he's truly in love  with her and tries so hard (and in so many romantic ways) to  win her heart.
2) gorgeous costumes, lavish balls, lovely music and romantic  waltzes.
3) brilliant acting all around and a beautiful cast (including  Frances  O'Connor's ""Fanny Price"", Jonny Lee Miller and  Justine Waddell).
The movie's not without its FLAWS, EVEN IGNORING the fact that the screenplay deviates quite heavily from the Austen novel:-
1) After watching the movie, I begin to see some of the other  reviewers' points of view on the total lack of neccessity in  introducing the subject of ""slavery"" into the story. This sub-  sub plot is very incoherent and jars terribly with the  overall story and also takes away some of the pleasures of  enjoying this supposedly light-hearted romance. Also, since  the ""issue"" is left ""hanging"" (unresolved) in the end after  its brutal introduction, what's the point of the director  introducing it in the first place?
2) The few scenes in which Fanny Price literally ""speaks""  to the camera is truly irritating and unreal. A voice-over  would've been preferred so that the effect is more believable  and doesn't seem as ""weird"".
3) I can't understand why the Fanny Price here (who's sweet-  natured, kindly and charming throughout the movie) all of a  sudden exhibits a Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde personality during the  LAST scene, when she LOOKS triumphantly (and with an almost  evil-like smile) into the camera while in the arms of the man  she finally secures. Weird.
This movie would've been perfect with such an able cast and a great Austen classic to adapt from, but under the direction of Patricia Rozema (who unfortunately also adapted the screenplay), the movie is reduced to just another average and unmemorable period piece which fails to soar.",978652800,,2388,4.878109452736318

As for me, I like my Austen a little grotty (my favorite Austen-flick being ""Persuarsion""), so the grim and disturbing looking characters at Mansfield Park as well as the Price residence are magic. The director's choice to place the story in socio-economic context (wealth earned through slave-powered plantations) as well as the author's gendered/economic context both works and fails.
Where the movie lets down is in the underplayed and jerky character development, which seems to be less the fault of the actors and more the result of scripting decisions. Most glaring is the rather sudden transformation of Embeth Davidtz character.

This is yet another in a good run of Austen movies.  Australian Frances O'Connor captures the warmth, humor, and goodness of the heroine, Fanny Price, who has been sent away from her own poverty-stricken family to live with wealthy relatives.  There is a lot of social commentary here--Fanny's family may be poor and desperate, but they are nowhere near as debauched or spiritless as her wealthy relations.
Fanny's elder female cousin, in particular, marries for money and then has an affair because she feels trapped in the loveless marriage.  Undoubtedly, one of Austen's favorite messages is that money matters less than love when it comes to marriage.  That is particularly well-portrayed here.
The acting is uniformly good, led by O'Connor with a performance that would make Austen proud.

The script is uneven, unbalanced and gives none of the talented performers a chance to shine.  Historically inaccurate, the costumes and the sets are a joke.  If someone could tell me why Mansfield Park looked like the aftermath of a bankruptcy sale, I'd be grateful.
Rozema reportedly disliked Austen, the novel and the character of Fanny Price as she was written.

I consider myself a diehard Jane Austen enthusiast and an avid supporter of the traditional Jane Austen movies. Even so, I feel that this film presents a likeable heroine in the revamped Fanny Price. She is bolder, more assertive, and her biting sense of humor makes her more like an Elizabeth Bennett than a Fanny Price. Those who resent this remolded character will undoubtedly be annoyed with the entire film. But why get bogged down in the traditionalist view? The new Fanny Price is endearing, the lesbian undertones perplexing, and the dark genocidal issues intriguing. The love story between Fanny and Edmund grabbed me from the very beginning.

Before I begin to go on about this film, it must be said that this book does not stay true to the book which, in the case of Mansfield Park, I do not consider flaw.  When one is attempting to create a film based on a beloved piece of ficton, there are always many obstacles to overcome--the main one being it's transformation to the screen.  One must remember, however, that often what makes a great work of fiction does not make a fine film.  Mansfield Park is just such a case. Ms. Rozema, however, does stay true to the nature of the Austin's work.  The characters are finely crafted and the supporting cast (not to mention the fine casting of Frances O'Connor as Fanny Price and Johnny Lee Miller as Edmund Bertrum) is tremendous.

The plot of the movie tends to flatten the rich characters portrayed in the book, as well as simplify story lines to fit a Hollywood mold.  Granted, in order to fit the book into a 2-hour format, some liberties must be taken.  But the director chose the most sensational parts of the story, much to the detriment of character development and nuance that makes the story such a classic.  I feel that the characters, especially Fanny, Mr. Bertram and Mary Crawford, were significantly flattened versions of their literary counterparts.  Also, having read the book, I could follow along with the story easily, but I am afraid that someone who hadn't read the book would find the story somewhat jumpy, and the motivation for certain actions and events to be left unexplained.

I could not find the good story.
Take away the film effects and costume/lighting and what do you have.  Characters that individually made the description pathetic an understatement, and collectively were over the top.  Not even Jerry Springer could not find so many dysfunctional people in one house.  Opium, slave rape, alcoholism, neglect, hatred, abandonment, rat infestation, etc.  I could just hear the moviemakers  deciding to throw it all in there, afraid people would think the original story is some insipid 18th century romance novel.
Which we know it is not. I fear that they may have created a 21st century insipid drama.
 I know that many people are critical of Jane Austen's Fanny as being too afraid, fanatically religious, and too goody-good. This Fanny was disappointing since she had no personality at all, and just stood and watched. She constantly looked at us as if to distance herself from the film.
Jane Austen is a tough story teller to compete with, but I can't escape getting the sense that the creators of this film are just a tad conceited at there own ability. All at Jane Austin's expense. It is always a controversy as to what plays to a contemporary crowd.  I am not blasting the writers/director's license to express their own creativity.

1101226,5,6305892806,"I am a great fan of Jane Austen's and I have enjoyed reading many of her  works, although I had never heard of this one before seeing this film.  Those who profess to be experts about such things say that this early work  was not one of her best.  However, I found the film to be delightful and  very much in keeping with Austen's penchant for conjuring up romantic  intrigue in 19th century English society.
This is the story of Fanny  Price (Frances O'Connor), who is taken out of poverty by her aunt and  benefactress to live in high society.  Though she is given every benefit  afforded her cousins, she is constantly reminded of her second-class status  in the household.  As the story revs up, we are treated to a typical Austen  maelstrom of misplaced romantic affections.  Mariah Bertram (Victoria  Hamilton) is engaged to Mr. Rushworth (Hugh Bonneville), but she is  infatuated with Henry Crawford (Allesandro Nivola) as is her sister Julia.  Though Henry enjoys flirting with Mariah, his true affections lie with  Fanny.  Fanny shuns his attentions because she loves her cousin Edmund  (Jonny Lee Miller) who is smitten by Henry's sister Mary (Embeth Davitz).  This is a classically delicious Austenian romantic conundrum.  The  remainder of the story goes about reconciling all the unrequited love with  more than a few interesting twists.
Patricia Rozema adapted and directed  this film, which was very nicely done.  The choice of locations was  excellent and she used the countryside effectively, giving us numerous  lovely outdoor scenes.  The period rendering was very good as well,  presenting very realistic 19th century sets and costumes.  There has been a  lot of controversy about Rozema's insertion of the slave issue, which was  notably absent from Austen's novel.  To a point, I have to defend Rozema,  but ultimately I felt she went too far.
A director has a responsibility  to make the film believable by providing details not in the script.  For  instance, Austen doesn't specifically describe the actual dress and  furniture of the time, so the director must find suitable props and  costumes of the period to give the film a genuine look and feel.  Slavery  was a dominant issue of the time and so the insertion of the topic was a  realistic detail, as long as it remained in the background.  However, the  introduction of the sketch pad (those who have seen the film will  understand) took slavery out of the background and made it a plot element.  This was tantamount to rewriting Austen's story, and I felt it was a  preachy and presumptuous abuse of artistic license.
Frances O'Connor was  outstanding as Fanny.  She was enchanting and effervescent and passed  credibly for a teenager despite being almost 30 years old.  Fanny was a  multifaceted character.  She was a combination of youthful ebullience,  fierce independence and stubborn determination.  O'Connor handled all these  aspects of her character like a pro.  Embeth Davitz was also excellent as  Henry's conniving sister.
This delightful and well-crafted film is very  entertaining and enjoyable.  I rated it 9/10.  With the possible exception  of the slavery issue, lovers of Jane Austen will not be disappointed.",968803200,14,3208,5.026819923371647

In none of  Austen's works would this be considered a polite thing to do, but  especially not here, where Fanny is supposed to be polite almost to a  fault. One could forgive this departure in trying to make the story more  appealing to modern audiences if the movie did not contain more serious  flaws.

When one decides to view a movie developed from Jane Austen's  work, one expects to be confronted with the petty foibles of humanity. What  one does not expect is that a major plot point will be the raping and  degradation of people in a subordinate culture.  It is true that such  terrible injustices occurred during this period of history; but it is much  too important a subject to be thrown haphazardly into a movie just to  create some dramatic tension.  To use it in this story is disrespectful not  only of Austen's work; it commits the far greater offense of disrespecting the unfortunate people who endured the  horrors of slavery.",966902400,15,1307,4.595652173913043
1101230,4,6305892806,"Here I be - oncemore reviewing a Jane Austen adaptation that is not quite true to the novel from which it is contrived.  And here oncemore do I  sanction one and give unto it my blessing.  (Sometimes I shock myself.)  Yet I cannot deny that I found this movie charming.  I must say that  Frances O'Connor gives a more openly formidable spirit in Fanny than the  subtle and silent brick wall of a spirit in the Fanny of the novel.  So,  here's the scoop:
Fanny, the oldest daughter in a near-impoverish family  of many children, goes to live with her mother's sister, Lady Bertram's,  family on a large estate.  Another aunt, Mrs. Norris, secures Fanny's  position in the family as a sort of servant to wait upon her aunt and act  as a sort of ""savage"" companion to Lady Bertram's daughters,  Maria and Julia.  Alone in her attic room with no fire, Fanny writes  incessantly clever little stories and letters to her family - and over the  years of her childhood and blooming womanhood develops a close friendship  with the Bertram's second son, Edmund.  Everything is quaint and peaceful  until a brother & sister, Henry and Mary Crawford, move into the  parsonage on the estate.  As the Bertram sisters, one of whom is engaged  and set to marry another man, flirt with and swoon over Henry, Edmund  determines to woo Mary, who welcomes it notwithstanding the fact that that  he is only the 2nd son and would not inherit the estate.  In the meantime,  Henry sets his sights intently on Fanny - who is by now in love with  Edmund.
So sets things into motion.  The movie differs from the book,  however, in not only several blatant characteristics in Fanny, but also  distinct differences in Edmund's feelings toward his little cousin.  The  source of the Bertram's wealth - only vaguely referenced in the novel -  provide in this movie a much darker view of humanity than I think Austen  would have even conceived. But forgiving all that, I'll happily admit I  shall - as with all the Jane Austen movie adaptations - watch this charmer  several times again!",966643200,5,2055,4.636871508379889
1101231,5,6305892806,"Rozema rejected a boring script because she did not want a literary adaptation.  Instead, she wrote her own in seven months...So, if you are simply looking for a  screen illustration of Austin's novel, this film may not please you.  The  film stands on its own for cinematic merits.  The script is well-written  and works for screen presentation.  It is funny as well as intellectually  critical of Jane Austen's world.  For this reason, the film is one rare  piece that is BETTER than the novel -- because it examines and makes fun of  the novel's fictional world.  Go for it if you want a good laugh and a  glimpse at human relationship of the 19th century with an aristically well  constructed period piece.",966556800,8,710,4.713114754098361
1101339,1,6305892806,"OK, I have to admit that I have not read the book, however, I disliked the movie for its own sake. The love interest had no personality (and was  slightly incestuous as well - blegh). No one's personality was well  developed and the plot was SLOW. In addition, they mention slavery but  really do not go into it. Fanny finds out that the Lord is an abuser of  slaves and then she just drops it! Is the older brother against slavery or  just a drunk? And why don't they ever show his face? The ending was weird  as well, like they ran out of money, just show 1 minute of people sitting  around while Fanny says ""It could have happened differently but it  didn't"" many times. Plus a movie about slavery without ANY slaves! I  didn't mind the lesbianism, I thought that it was the only interesting part  of the movie. Plus, there was a lot of talk of education, but no one  teaching - how did Fanny learn anything? so much wrong for a single movie.",966124800,6,945,4.2824858757062145
1101340,4,6305892806,"OK ! Let's get back to the classics. At least, you are sure that your ears won't be hurt by the today scatological vocabulary so praised by the new  generation of directors who thinks, by using the language of the streets,  that they are making modern films. How wrong ! The themes treated by Jane  Austen in MANSFIELD PARK are more actual and universal than the 90 % of the  Hollywood screenplays of the year 1999. And I'm still nice with the old  dream factory.
Jane Austen was a witty and sharp observer of the late  XVIII-early XIXth century period in England. She had the peculiar gift to  feel what was hidden behind the masks that society and the system of  classes gave to people at their birth. Her novels are little pearls of  psychology that until now have well stood the test of time. But what I  really appreciate in her books, it's the kind of black humor that reigns  through numerous pages of her work. Director Patricia Rozema has  particularly well translated in the cinema grammar this humor, specially in  the last 10 minutes of MANSFIELD PARK.
Three years after SENSE AND  SENSIBILITY with Emma Thompson, MANSFIELD PARK is another excellent  adaptation of a Jane Austen novel and can only arouse your envy to  rediscover the other novels of this writer.
A DVD for you and your  schoolteacher.",966124800,5,1313,4.639130434782609
1101341,4,6305892806,"Having failed to read Jane Austen's ""Mansfield Park"", I can't really compare the movie to it.  Nevertheless, I shouldn't have to, and the  movie should stand on its own feet.  The story of how young Fanny Price  escapes a crude life with her family in Portsmouth to become a servant in  the magnificent ""Mansfield Park"" manages to build up to soemthing  several times through the film, only give up.  Already intelligent and  imaginative when she first leaves home, Fanny grows into more intelligent  and beautiful young woman, more than Sir Thomas' daughters.  Yet the film  gives Fanny's wit little bite, and tool little of that is alotted to her  unwanted suitor.  Fanny much prefers sir Thomas' pious son, but that  romance seems inexplicably obstructed by his engagement to the slyly amoral  Mary Crawford.  Are we really to believe that Edmund, comntemplating the  life of a cleric, would propose to the seductive Crawford?  And why would  she accept, being openly contemptuous of a life that spurns materialism.  Edmund seems to much a cypher without Mary Crawford: he keeps Fanny  supplied with paper, quills and attention as Fanny grows into a young  woman, but he becomes all too serious as a young man, and it's hard to  visualize him growing up on Fanny's spicy prose.  Fanny's position seems  comfortably settled between servant and family, but she remains a servant,  a member of the lesser class, and the consequences of her refusal to marry  the conceited Mr. Crawford destroy the illusion...only for it to return  when Fanny is called back to Mansfield Park from exile.  Sir Thomas' other  son, the sole beneficiary - under primogeniture - of the elder Bertram's  fortune, is slowly going insane at the prospect of an inheritance that  includes a slave colony in Antigua.  Thomas' fevered sketches of Antigua  seem almost modeled after those taken of the European concentration camps  of the last world war.  Yet Thomas is barely a presence in the film and his  redemption, as well as both the elder Bertram's divestment from the slave  trade and the racist attitudes upon which he rationalizes it are all  cavalierly discarded by the end of the film, never tied to gether or  convincingly addressed.
Still, the actring is crisp and conveys what  viewers may not be able to get from the words themselves, and Mansfield  Park itself is the perfect setting.  Containing not rooms as much as  enclosed spaces as voluminous as caverns, it appears to open and  claustrophobic when the scene requires it.",965606400,3,2515,4.939903846153846
1101342,5,6305892806,"When I first saw this film, it bothered me a bit that it wasn't faithful to Jane Austen's original. But upon reflection and a few more viewings, I fell completely in love with it. Rozema has made a remarkable achievement,  seamlessly blending Austen's novel, letters and journals into a more  compelling story, while also adapting it for modern sensibilities. While I  love the novel, the film Mansfield Park tackles so much more than the  ""manuevering business"" of marriage and societal mores that  Austen's novels are singularly concerned with. It harshly examines the  strict limitations that women, especially poor women must endure and takes  a rare look at how slavery benefitted the British Empire.  All this serious  stuff aside, the film also has plenty of comedic moments. The dim Mr.  Rushworth and his bouffant provide some laughs, as does Fanny's attitude  toward courtship, balls and her money-grubbing cousins. And don't miss the  doped-up Lady Bertram. The entire cast is excellent, and Frances O'Connor  and Jonny Lee Miller make a sweet and aesthetically pleasing couple. For  all us girls, Miller and Alessandro Nivola make an already great film even  more of a pleasure to watch.  The only Austen film to which this measures  up is Sense and Sensibility (though I adore all the films, of course, being  an Austen buff). The costumes, the cinematography, the breathtaking shots  of the English countryside and of course the beautiful soundtrack round out  this rich confection of a movie. Watch it now!",965001600,23,1521,5.105691056910569
1101343,4,6305892806,"""Mansfield Park"" is probably my least favorite of Austen's novels, especially with its plain, dull heroine, Fanny Price.  I also watched the video series of it, made years earlier than this version, and  found that series very faithful to the novel. I found it hard to get beyond  the plainly unattractive, placid heroine. So I didn't like it very much  either.  This newest version is a more modern adaptation with a markedly  different heroine, one who resembles Elizabeth Bennett of ""Pride &  Prejudice"".  I liked this version much more than the novel or the  earlier video series.  However, it still comes in behind the newest  versions of ""Pride & Prejudice"" (Colin Firth) and ""Sense  and Sensibility"" (Emma Thompson).

I enjoyed the slave trade wealth of  the family being brought into this film as well as (cousin) Tom's stunning  drawings of the abuse of slaves, which Fanny discovers while he is ill. For  the first time, I found Fanny's love interest attractive.  This is her  cousin Edmund, a future clergyman, played by Johnny Lee Miller, who is  already a film heartthrob.  The romance of the piece is a lot more  believable with such attractive leads at the heart of it.  The father of  the family, acted by playwright Harold Pinter, is a much darker character  than he is in earlier versions.  This is a plus to this version as well.  Austen purists may have problems with this film version but everyone else  should give it a try.  My husband, who is not a Jane Austen fan, liked this  film better than the other film or video versions of Austen's works so he  would probably give it a 5.

1101344,5,6305892806,"After reading all of Austen's novels, I do consider myself a pretty ardent and faithful fan.  And of course I have long waited eager anticipation for Rozema's daring adaption of Austen's most controversial and complex novel.  I can assure you the after-taste of my fist viewing was quite nameless.  First of all, no film should be condemned for being discursive from the  book, and Rozema should definitely be applauded for what she attempted with  this classic. The original novel is the darkest in theme among Austen's  known works, and Rozema has a keen eye for the sparks lurking in the  darkness of Mansfield Park and she captures them well with her camera and  her dialogues. At times however, one feels the political aspect of slave  trade is rather too patent, yet the arguments do provide a fertile ground  for the character Fanny Price to blossom.  Frances O'Connor subtly takes  away the painfully shy, clumsy country girl and presents us a revolutionary  young woman of the new ages.  The rest of the cast is brilliant as well and  they fit nicely into the niches painted by Rozema.  Some say Austen would  be rolling in her grave for the bold liberty Rozema takes: Sir Bertram's  unexplored sexual exploits, virtue of wealth, and worth of love for  example; but all works out for modern viewers who are more or less tempted  by the same conceptual doubts, be it 2006 or 1806.  So don't call me an  infidel for giving this ""rebel"", brow-raiser 5 stars, only a true  admirer of Austen's spirit can probe to such depth and uncover the courage  of Fanny.  After all, Austen was a rebel for her age, and through Rozema's  witty script, superimposing Austen's own toiling youth against Fanny's  literary fancies, are we able to sigh in relieve and curtsey in response to  the towering strength of one woman.",964656000,10,1814,4.764516129032258
1101345,4,6305892806,"As an ardent Jane Austen fan, I approached my Mansfield Park viewing warily. I knew that it would be different from the book, but felt that since it was not one of my favorite Austen efforts I would be able to  survive the inaccuracies without exploding with indignation. Happily, my  concerns were unnecessary! I very much enjoyed the film. Fanny, who in the  novel is quite insipid, in the movie very much resembles her creator (Miss  Austen), and, in fact, much of the character's literary endeavors are taken  from Austen's juvenalia. Frances O'Connor does a great job of portraying a  woman who is happier in the background, yet fiercely resists being pushed  into actions that violate her inner values. Another underrated plus for  this film is Jonny Lee Miller's performance as Edmund. He is perfectly  restrained and yet affectionate! This movie's no Pride & Prejudice, but  it is a very rewarding experience.",964483200,27,917,4.973684210526316
1101346,3,6305892806,"Considering the fact that Jane Austen was not exactly the most prolific novelist of all time - she basically completed about half a dozen lengthy works in her short lifetime - it seems inconceivable that, after the recent  onslaught of films derived from her works, there remain any left available  for adaptation.  Yet, here is the latest, a film version of what many  consider to be one of her weaker efforts, ""Mansfield Park,"" a tale set,  like all her stories, in the pleasant countryside of early 19th Century  England.  Faced as they were with the obvious inferiority of the source  material and the prospect of building a film around what is universally  admitted to be one of Austen's drabbest heroines, the filmmakers obviously  decided to risk updating the material by bringing a more modern, socially  conscious sensibility to the proceedings.  Predictably, many Austen purists  have balked at the screenwriter's injection of so sanguinary a subject as  the slave trade into the author's carefully isolated and circumscribed  world of genteel manners and quaint social customs.  In addition, the film  even provides a glimpse of passionate lovemaking that, while insignificant  by today's filmic standards, may well jolt the true Austenphile into a  state of palpitating agitation if not downright apoplexy (pass the smelling  salts someone; I feel a case of the vapors coming on)!
Actually,  ""Mansfield Park"" emerges as a reasonably entertaining film, true to the  spirit of Austen in its sharp-witted dialogue and its exploration of  ever-shifting romantic relationships that are the staples of all the  author's works.  The protagonist, Fanny Price, sent off at a young age to  live as the ""poor relation"" at her relatives' estate in the country, has  been made less the passive observer she was in the novel and more a woman  of action and decision.  The film essentially concerns itself with the  romantic travails of this kindhearted, clear-eyed young woman as she copes  with the haughtiness, facades and deceptions of a number of the people  around her.  Even though the story seems at times a pale reiteration of  themes and plot devices developed to more effectiveness in the author's  ""Pride and Prejudice,"" the complexity of both the characters and the  storyline keep one intrigued for most of the film's running time.  As with  Elizabeth Bennet, Fanny discovers the realities of the true persona so  often hidden beneath deceptively simple surfaces and learns to accept a  world and the people living in that may not be quite in accordance with  one's stubbornly held pre-conceived notions.
As to the inclusion of the  issue of the uncle's involvement in the slave trade, it is not, in and of  itself, a matter for immediate dismissal.  Just because Austen never  included it in any of her works doesn't mean that it is necessarily  irrelevant in helping to fill in the social background of the era  presented.  The problem, though, is that the subject is dealt with in such  a superficial manner that it seems tacked on as a too-obvious attempt to  render the time period more in tune with modern standards of equanimity and  social justice - as if our liberal consciences could not indulge themselves  guilt-free in the seeming triviality of these characters' over-sheltered  lives if we were not forced to notice that such a lifestyle was possible  only on the broken backs of human workhorses.  (One wonders if, in a film  set in modern times, we will now be subjected to discussions of the cruelty  and inhumanity of the treatment of migrant farm workers every time a  character indulges himself in a piece of fruit.  It is always so much  easier to point the finger of wagging shame at the barbarity of cultures  long passed from the scene than at our own).
Luckily, writer/director  Patricia Rozema has been blessed with a first-rate cast of extraordinary  actors, including Embeth Davidtz as a fully fleshed-out version of Fanny,  and even playwright Harold Pinter, of all people, as Fanny's slave-owning  uncle.  Visually, the film is gorgeous, capturing the many-hued brilliance  of the tranquil English countryside and the dreary, somber grayness of  Fanny's impoverished seaside home with equal effectiveness.
""Mansfield  Park"" is nowhere near the sparkling delight that ""Emma"" was.  Still, it  provides riches aplenty for those with a fondness for this time period and  the uniquely special joys Jane Austen's works provide.",964310400,9,4462,5.090152565880722
1101347,3,6305892806,"This is a clever, boisterous, and cheeky film.  It is extremely well-photographed, and, for its purposes, well cast and well written.  The trouble is, it isn't Mansfield Park.  Fanny Price isn't Fanny Price, Sir  Thomas isn't Sir Thomas, and Jane Austen isn't Jane Austen.  The outline of  the plot is there, but it is an altogether different reading from the book.  Rozema has incorporated (or crammed) some of Austen's letters and  juvenilia into the character of Fanny, and has created a heroine who is  neither Fanny Price nor Jane Austen.  Throughout the film the viewer barely  gets a whiff of Jane Austen's wit and style.  What we see more often is  what may pass for the author's subtext, and still more often Rozema's  superimposed contemporary interpretation.  It amounts to a contemporary  study of Mansfield Park, and how much you like it will be largely  determined by how much you like contemporary values and mores; those in the  film are not those of Jane Austen.  If you like the movie, it doesn't  necessarily mean that you will like the book, or Jane Austen.  I think the  director/screenwriter is more fond of her own ideas about Jane Austen than  of Jane Austen herself.  Some have suggested that this is how Austen would  have written it if she lived in our day.  Quite frankly, Mansfield Park  (the book) could not have been written in our day by anybody.  I am sure  that Austen would not approve of her most moral novel being displayed in  such a comparatively raucous tone (more like the tone of the condemned  Lovers' Vows), nor would she wish it to be a vehicle for feminist themes.  By the time Miss Crawford's true character is revealed, so little attention  has been paid to morality that she does not sufficiently shock.  For my  part, the heroine constantly winking, as it were, at the audience, was  rather off-putting.  I saw it because my curiosity could not be satisfied  any other way.  It is, however, an interesting movie to see, but not before  you've read the book.",964224000,64,2007,4.72093023255814
1101348,3,6305892806,"If you happen to be a die-hard Jane Austin fan, please read as many reviews of this movie as you can before you watch it, but definitely watch it!  This movie shows just enough resemblance to the book to be able to  recognize Jane Austin as it's mother, but that's as far as it goes.  You  will not recognize Fanny Price.  They call her Fanny Price in the movie,  but her self-assured mannerisms and self-confidence bear no resemblance to  the book.  Fanny's older brother has been completely written out of the  movie.  And I can't quite put my finger on it, but there seems to be an  overall attempt to make all the characters seem black and white, good or  bad, which I found frustrating and annoying.  This black/white thing is  particularly annoying since Jane Austin had very few completely bad people  in her novels.  We, of course, interpret their actions as bad, but she  always suggested that there was something redeeming in everyone whether  they chose that path or not. I have a number of issues with this  interpretation, but if you approach it as just another period movie, it can  be quite enjoyable.  Nice cinematography, nice locations, the pacing is  good, and there are a handful of amusing conventions within it.  I usually  don't care for a movie whose characters talk directly to the viewers  (except, of course, for Woody Allen movies) because it tends to distroy the  viewers' suspension of disbelief, and that isn't a good way of presenting a  dramatic story line.  So, in summation, I was disappointed with this  adaptation.  I am one of those people who wish film makers could interpret  a book faithfully to the author's intent, instead of putting their own  interpretive mark on the project.  But, as long as you understand that this  movie will not actually be the Mansfield Park with which you are familiar,  it is an enjoyable experience.  As for the lesbian thing, I interpreted  that as another in the many little details that the director used to  attempt to make certain characters appear good, and others appear bad.  It's disappointing that this film maker chose to make a character look bad  by suggesting she might have lesbian tendancies (that sort of comment  doesn't help our society get beyond stereotypes).  She should have saved  her social commentary for her own material, instead of tacking it onto a  Jane Austin story!  For those of you who have not read any of Jane Austin's  writing, there are few references to sex, and none to lesbian  relationships.  Definitely rent it before you buy it!",963964800,5,2544,4.766743648960739
