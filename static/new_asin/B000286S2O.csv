8023508,4,B000286S2O,"Time is an important factor in this movie (known as On the Stroke of Nine in the UK).  An impossible murder takes place in a college bell tower.  There's no murder weapon and no means of escape for the killer.  Even more puzzling is the murder victim, an insignificant student named Mal Jennings.  Why was he killed and how was it done?  Charles Starrett plays Bill Bartlett an ace reporter in love with the prime suspect (Shirley Grey as Lillian Voyne).  He makes it his mission to find the real killer.  It doesn't help that Lillian is an accomplished liar and a suspicious character in her own right.  Her friend Ann has a gangster for a dad (Maurice Black as Blackie Atwater) and that too is troublesome.  With some careful investigation by Police Capt. Ed Kyne (J. Farrell MacDonald), the pieces begin to fall into place.  Unfortunately, more (seemingly unrelated) murders happen using the same gun.  Stumped, the ace reporter turns to his friend, amateur sleuth Professor C. Edson Hawley (Edward Van Sloan) for help.

I love old black and white movies and this one from 1934 proves an interesting enough mystery.  The transfer is par for the course, but considering the age of the source material, acceptable.  Loved the ending.",1434067200,,1234,4.786729857819905

Often, these transfers are of a quality similar to multi-film budget brands. The movies themselves are unrestored and rarely pristine yet still watchable (unless there's an inordinate number of repaired breaks). Extras are non-existent and inclusion of artwork or liner notes varies by manufacturer. These niche companies can provide a valuable outlet for movies unavailable anywhere else.

MURDER ON THE CAMPUS (1933) is a CHESTERFIELD Pictures whodunit that was adapted from the Whitman Chambers novel, THE CAMPANILE MURDERS. Stockton native Chambers' several hard-boiled news reporter mysteries were set in the San Francisco area.

Being studio-bound by a low budget, there's no inkling here of the titled college campus, or its location.

In the first scene critical to the story, it's a little after 9 PM. The university's carillon rings out with ""Joy to the World."" The music stops suddenly, then a gunshot is heard. Reporter Bill Bartlett (Charles Starrett), plus Police Capt. Ed Kyne (J. Farrell MacDonald) and burly Det. Sgt. Charlie Lorrimer (Dewey Robinson) ascend to the top of the chime tower where they find the body of failed track star (and carillon-ringer) Malcolm Jannings. He's dead from a single bullet.

It's already established that Malcolm was a friend of Lillian Voyne (Shirley Grey). Bill has expressed his displeasure that Lillian, a gal he's sweet on, would in any way associate with Jannings, an uncouth, lazy bum. And now Lillian is prime suspect in the athlete's murder. It's up to Bill to report on the story even as he tries to clear Lillian of the crime. A further complication: this will not be the only homicide, and again all signs point to Lillian as the perpetrator.

Also with Ruth Hall and Maurice Black as other likely suspects, and Edward Van Sloan as a university chemistry professor who later in the story volunteers help with Bill's investigation.

Director Richard Thorpe labored in relative Poverty Row anonymity until Louis B. Mayer noticed and signed him to an MGM contract. Over the years Thorpe directed (among others) BARNACLE BILL (1941), Tarzan and Thin Man movies,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-GREAT-CARUSO/dp/B00508W3FW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE GREAT CARUSO</a>&nbsp;(1951) with Mario Lanza,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/KNIGHTS-OF-THE-ROUND-TABLE/dp/B007XTDXF0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE</a>&nbsp;(1953), plus&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/JAILHOUSE-ROCK/dp/B000QUUD5G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">JAILHOUSE ROCK</a>&nbsp;(1957) and two other Elvis musicals.",1233446400,,2555,6.203389830508475
