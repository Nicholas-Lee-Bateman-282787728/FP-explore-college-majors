8042911,3,B0006SSQ4I,"This dvd was definitely done in the late 80s or very early 90s by looking at the garnish lighting, camerawork, makeup & clothing.

This is taught in about 50 min by a blonde, athletic, nicely spoken dancer with about 4 couples demonstrating the moves after every major point is taught. She teaches the basic step, lambada step, slide, turning & dipping.

It wasn't too boring, I definitely almost felt transported to a dance studio. The dance itself isn't hard to understand at all, an easy splice of merange, shuffling w/a lot of hip action & the man rubbing the woman's back instead of just holding it to make it look more complex then it is.

Becasue of it being old & production lightning is a little garnish (thouch can see everything) I took off a star. The teaching wasn't too slow & could have been a lot more cheesy & boring so I left most stars.",1156377600,6,855,4.467948717948718
