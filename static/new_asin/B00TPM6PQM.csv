7014836,5,B00TPM6PQM,"This documentary of the life of Kurt Cobain is extremely well done.  As a fan of Nirvana Ive seen numerous videos, read all books but this is a work of art.  My husband who never really ""got"" Nirvana found the documentary very interesting as well so its worth seeing for everyone.  Cobain was just a person, human.  Blessed or maybe cursed, with a very artistic and extremely sensitive soul.  For whatever reason Love had for releasing videos and information, I am grateful and enlightened.",1430784000,4,490,4.785714285714286
7014837,5,B00TPM6PQM,"It's very different but ""Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck"" is a wonderful documentary, it doesn't delve to much into his career but more into Kurt's mind and personal life with home videos, his drawings and even Kurt's audio diaries, it shows him as a man not a myth, it's nice to have been able to see this part of him",1430784000,5,315,4.266666666666667
7014838,4,B00TPM6PQM,"This HBO Documentary Film provides an unforgettable insight into Kurt Cobain as an artist and as a man. The film relies heavily on two major components: stunning, tragic, but ulimately remarkable archival footage, coupled with new interviews. I think this combination proves not a hindrance, but rather the most effective way to paint a palpable, painful, joyous biography of one of music's most unforgettable artists.

I don't pretend to have liked all of Nirvana's music, but, speaking for myself, this was the first band (followed closely by Soundgarden, lyrically speaking - and Guns-n-Roses, instrumentally speaking) that finally snapped me out of the quagmire and doldrums of ""popular"" music at the time all sounded the same to me. It was the first band in a long time that finally got me excited about music again. That was my own experience, anyway.

I found, too, this doco clearly went places that Nick Broomfield's ""Kurt & Courtney"" could not, due to legal issues with Courtney, so it was great to finally see something insightful that wasn't hindered by those inherently restrictive and inherently less informative constraints. Obviously, that Brett Morgan was able to get this kind of access makes this doco what it is.",1430265600,5,1232,5.124378109452737

I only enjoyed the music; the rest is intentionally making Kurt looking bad, satanic to explain his suicide. The movie also confirms that gold digger Courtney didn't love Kurt because she was cheating on him.. If he hooked with someone normal he would be alive today.

7014896,3,B00TPM6PQM,"As a huge Kurt Cobain fan, I could not wait for this film to come out. Given the fact that Frances Bean was one of the executive producers and that it was authorized by both his band and family, I felt that it would be a true glimpse into this grunge icon. Boy was I wrong. I have been to Aberdeen, WA (just a few years ago in fact) and loved the vintage clips of Aberdeen and his childhood. I enjoyed the interviews with his family, for the most part. But the film attempts to carry on this suicide narrative and shove it in our faces a little too much, yes we know what the ruling on his death was, but we fans don't have to believe everything we are told. I would have liked to have heard from Dave Grohl and Frances as well. The feel seems rehearsed at times and it seems that certain speakers were coached on what to say by someone else. The film also shows way too much of his personal life and journals, which I do not feel that he would have approved of us fans seeing. There are far better films about Kurt and I think this was propaganda to make money for the estate. The animation was exceptional, but did not always help the viewer in any way. I did not like some of the filler visual clips that were included and I felt that they brought nothing to the film. Brett Morgen could have done a much better job.",1465430400,3,1319,4.116279069767442

The biggest pile of crap was when his mom was telling a story of how kurt came downstairs and plugged in his demo tape for nevermind and she starts ""crying"" from fear because he's gonna be famous......That is ABSOLUTE CRAP. First off that is a dumb thing to say, if it even ever happened to begin with. Second, if it did happen, HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY know your son was gonna become a star overnight from this music she probably thought was crap anyway!!!??? She honestly probably said it was interesting or garbage. Not crying from how she knows how he'll be famous and can't take it.

7014918,5,B00TPM6PQM,"I was suprisingly very moved by this Documentary.  I watched it a few times when it was on HBO & each time I appreciated it more & more.  I had a visceral response which for me was suprising.  I appreciated the long & painstaking work & time that was put into this film by Brett Morgen.  I remember when Nirvana hit the big time in the early 90's I liked the music they created &  I appreciated their game changing brand of music.  I did not, however, become obsessed with the band itself.  I knew very little about Kurt Cobain & the frenzy he caused by expressing through his music, his clear contempt for anyone who did not get the message he was trying so strongly to convey.  Having said all of that, I was so taken by the man behind the curtain.  Who is by far more interesting then his iconic persona.  A plethora of emotional experiences was my take away.  Whether you were part of generation X or not it is very revealing and expose's his heart breaking vulnerability & his suprising, self deprecating sensitivity. Thank you Brett Morgen & Courtney Love & Cobain's family. for making this exceptional 'Rockumentary'.  Montage of Heck presents a 'fly on the wall'  insight. No documentary this far can compare to its barefaced, revealing, sometimes repulsive & often Heart wrenching vantage point that you'll not often experience about any other misunderstood life of a legendary Icon",1454976000,4,1391,4.651639344262295

7014940,4,B00TPM6PQM,I found this high profile Cobain documentary to be enjoyable and informative but not as good as it had been made out to be . In all it was a bit of a struggle to get through all of it in one sitting and it did get repetitive in places.,1454371200,,235,3.72

It gave both my friend and me an eye-opening look into what made Kurt the person and genius of a musician that he was.  The presentation of his private journal entries, drawings, and drafts of song lyrics display the raw emotion behind everything Kurt did, and bring much insight and understanding to his tragic end.  It is dark and at times painfully sad, but there are also beautiful moments of joy--such as the old home movies of Kurt as a child, and the videos of him interacting with his own daughter.  Montage of Heck may not be for everyone, some of it is graphic and could be disturbing or offensive to some, but it is a seemingly unfiltered look at what made Kurt Cobain who he was.",1454112000,11,1063,4.544502617801047

7014981,1,B00TPM6PQM,"Horrible documentary that exploits Kurt Cobain's personal journals. I'm a huge Nirvana/Kurt Cobain fan and I can say, Kurt Cobain would not want his personal journals to be exploited in a documentary nor home videos where he is high on heroin. Kurt Cobain loved playing music for his fans and was a very private person that didn't like his personal life displayed for everyone to see. I wish I would have never watched it. Soaked In Bleach is a five star documentary on him, even though it focuses on his death and Courtney Love having him murdered; it's still a positive movie about him & music.",1449792000,10,596,4.632075471698113

7014986,5,B00TPM6PQM,"There seems to be much controversy amongst particular fans and critics - most of which, from my understanding, is based upon either Courtney's input, or whether or not the film is too invasive. I suppose it's worth mentioning that I've read, seen, and listened to just about everything you'd expect from any of the most retardedly devoted Nirvana fanboys currently living. (I'm also obsessed with movies) Having said that - I gotta say - plenty of what is told here has already been available to anyone curious enough to come across it. I feel Brett Morgan chose to tell Kurt's story with a bold, ""warts and all"" fashion (as Bojack would say). And if Frances Bean (his daughter, executive producer of the film - no, Courtney was not a producer) approved of it, it's hard to have much of an issue with that. At least in my opinion. As for Courtney, the filmmaker chose to interview only the most essential ""characters"" in Cobain's life story. Undoubtedly, his wife is one of those people. Even if you hate her. I personally take anything she has to say with a grain of salt, as anyone who sees this should. Arguably anything told from memory is slightly dubious, I say let you're opinion of Courtney guide how you listen to what she has to say. It's no different from how I've approached interviews on Youtube in the past. Outside of the interviews, much of the film's runtime is comprised of home videos, rare footage, and montages of Kurt's art, journals, and so on. These sequences were f---ing bats---. If you like his work, I can't see a good reason to object to them (unless you're some kind of hipster dickars who hates ""Teen Spirit"" for its popularity). Way I see it, Montage of Heck is Kurt's story from eight sources: his mother, his father, his stepmother, his sister, his wife, his ex-girlfriend, his bass player, and himself. I could write endlessly about what is great about this documentary. Honestly, my only criticism of Montage of Heck would be that the animated portions portraying his youth could have had a less polished, naturalistic style. Otherwise, this is the very best account of Kurt Cobain's story across any medium. Considering its length, it's remarkably encompassing. Yes, there is a lot of s--- that isn't in here. But this is a film, in almost any case you got three hours at the most, if that. F---ing censorship.",1447372800,9,2347,4.7128953771289535

7015009,3,B00TPM6PQM,"This is the single most depressing music documentary ever made. I don't think it's the film makers fault especially. Kurt is just a seriously morose dude. His childhood is horrible and I have always suspected he was abused as well.
I would never call Nirvana a 'fun"" band but they were a seriously good one. That being said,stick to the music and try and look past how damaged Kurt really was. For a guy who got stoned so much,he never seems like he's having any fun at all.
The one thing I wish they had talked about in the film is,did the guy ever have any fun? Did he ever see a movie that made him laugh? Did he have any close friends,that he really got comfortable with?  Marrying Courtney and just getting in people's faces cause they could,probably wasn't as much fun as he thought it would be but then again,what is?
Had he given serious musicians more of a chance to help him they probably could have but it seems he wanted them too but would always pull back before they were able too. Neil Young,Michael Stipe,these guys were willing to help him! That would have been a huge advantage for most people but Kurt saw to it,that they weren't able too either. Kurt was so engulfed in guilt about being a junkie,he couldn't even enjoy heroin,a serious problem for a junkie. Most junkies start out having fun but I don't think he even had that. It just went from bad to worse.
Whatever made his burden so unbearable ,we'll never know. I get the felling some people know but they never helped him when he was alive ,so I get the feeling they're not going to step forward now either.  However,if you are one of those people who hurt him in life,go to your grave knowing what you've done and what you stole from the world.
For everybody else,watch this with extreme caution. The is ""The Deer Hunter"" of bio docs,I kid you not! ""The Deer Hunter"" is a great film but I have no intention of ever sitting through it again!",1445040000,6,1919,4.402816901408451
7015010,3,B00TPM6PQM,"Montage of Heck is a strong documentary that Nirvana fans will likely have a great time with, though it has some flaws which hold it back from greatness. I do love that Montage of Heck is made with a great deal of empathy and respect for Kurt Cobain and his life, while never feeling like a fanboy account; its willing to examine him, warts and all. At 132 minutes, though, the film runs a little long and could have been tighter; the first half is terrific, but there are many long stretches in the second half that focus on his relationship with Courtney Love and while the information is interesting, it grows a little repetitive and monotonous. In case you didn't realize that they both engaged in many unhealthy behaviors, don't worry: Montage of Heck will remind you again and again.

Additionally, the film is a little lopsided in what it chooses to focus on; Nirvanas Nevermind-era output is covered in great detail, but the treatment of In Utero and their MTV Unplugged set is very brief. The film also fails to have any interview footage with Dave Grohl, who is noticeably and curiously absent. On the other hand, the stylistic approach (a combination of interviews, journal entries, audio recordings, and animation) is terrific, and it never feels like style over substance; this eclectic approach seems to be in the service of understanding Kurt Cobain and his art instead of being a mere technical exercise.

I liked the film best when it focused on Kurt and his problems with fame; Nevermind was a huge and unexpected cultural phenomenon, but Kurts ambitions were simply to make great music. He hated giving interviews and being a celebrity; in the MTV culture he achieved fame in, he was turned into a kind of Mick Jagger or Bono for Generation X, which is something he never asked for and never felt comfortable with.

Kurt Cobain self-medicated his discomfort (and apparent stomach problems) with drugs and alcohol, and in one of the films most interesting sequences, hes asked if his stomach problems play a part in his artistic abilities; he mentions that his health problems probably helped his writing, but that he would give up everything for good health. One starts to realize that Cobain likely wanted to get clean and avoided it for many reasons: a very real addiction, a social network of people who enabled him, and a fear that cleanliness would kill his creative juices. Its a very sad, but revelatory part of the film, one of many moments that compensate for some of the shortcomings.

At its worst, Montage of Heck is a bloated film that skims over some very important things, despite its expansive running time; it could (and should) have been broader and leaner. At its best, though, its a creative and fascinating portrait of a depressed, unstable, and super miserable genius. Fans of Kurt Cobain should check it out; Montage of Heck is not perfect, but its a very entertaining and informative documentary about a beloved but reluctant cultural icon.",1444608000,20,2983,4.8203125
7015011,5,B00TPM6PQM,I disagree with the negative reviews that come before this one. I think the director chose to tell Kurt's story thru his Art and recorded home recordings and released material.

7015013,4,B00TPM6PQM,"I checked out this movie and it could have been constructed with a little more fortitude on Kurt's behalf but nowhere near as bad as some of these reviews have stated here. It's easy to bash Courtney Love but I don't think it was her intention to malign her husband in order to make money. I would like to know what these alleged mistruths that being told here. I don't know how it is possible for film footage, actual saved recording, pictures and writings could lie. I understand there are some die-hard KC fans and are sensitive to the issue but judgements shouldn't be made about this project after just one view of the movie. There are some very personal and also some very eerie moments never seen before; to me this was about sharing these moments with the fans and I'm sure in time this film will be more appreciated.

This was clearly Courtney Love's attempt at making Kurt Cobain look like he was totally tragic right from the beginning! Who even lets their daughter see her father high on heroin at all, let alone on her birthday or getting a haircut holding her? Someone trying to really nail it in that he was a tragic heroin addict, destined for suicide. Plus the story by Wendy OConnor should just have her shot! It's a total lie! Nobody knew that Nevermind was going to become famous, not even Buzz Osborne that knew Kurt well! Wendy admitted in 92' she never supported Kurt and he felt the same! Now that he's gone, she's been making money off him since! All she has to do is follow Courtney's breadcrumb trail. She's told lies to the media for 21 years and this movie was only made to outshine ""Soaked In Bleach"", which is a much better, honest movie!",1442016000,5,1018,4.508108108108108
7015015,5,B00TPM6PQM,"Clearly dating a psychopath has only turned you into a troll.

Just because you're a Nirvana superfan doesn't mean you know Sh*t about Heck.

Screenwriter: Brett Morgan

Cast: Kurt Cobain, Dave Grohl, Krist Novoselic, Courtney Love

After watching Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck, theres a sense of disillusionment left behind. Speculation on the tortured genius of Kurt Cobain has been a part of the zeitgeist since Cobains suicide in 1994. Films, books, and interviews have been levied by the dozen on this subject, and yet still theres an ominous curiosity surrounding the legacy of Kurt Cobain.

Filmmaker Brett Morgan (The Kid Stays in the Picture) looks to end that curiosity once and for all with a tremendously in-depth documentary composed of Cobains own journal writings, home video recordings, and media appearances sewn together and punctuated with animated reenactments of stories narrated by Cobain himself that were found on cassette tapes discovered by Morgan. As documentaries go, this is one of the most stylish and innovative examples the genre has ever seen. Morgan expertly designs his Rock Doc to be drenched in the art and music of its subject in some penetrating ways. And yet Morgans biggest success is also, perhaps the films greatest adversary: assuring the audience gets an authentic depiction of Cobain.

The film opens in traditional documentary fashion, shedding a light on Cobains upbringing, interviewing his family members, and showcasing through some wonderful home videos that Cobain was the typical suburban kid. However, the evolution of the Cobain we have come to revere is depicted to be a result of divorce, neglect, drugs, and irresponsibility. The boy we meet in the films opening scenes would go on to write I Hate Myself and Want to Die, but would likely not hate himself and want to die. Thus, as  Morgan does what good filmmakers do and lifts the veil on his subject, I admit I became more and more turned off.

That being said, the film is quite excellent regardless of what one thinks about its subject. While Morgan occasionally may go for style over substance, documentary films often thrive on revealing truth and allowing an audience to absorb and decide for themselves; Montage of Heck ultimately delivers in that area.  Furthermore, Nirvana fans will revel in some of the exceptional footage assembled here, but the films honesty is unnerving at times. Watching a heroin-soaked Cobain try to interact with his baby daughter disgusts me to a previously unknown level of disgust.

Overall, what Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck does well is cast an intimate depiction rarely seen on film. The method is remarkably effective, but if you are a fan of Cobains, be prepared for some of the mystique to ware off. B

Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck is not rated, but received a TV-MA for its television broadcast. It has a running time of 2 hours and 15 minutes.",1439769600,,2781,5.0130151843817785
7015041,3,B00TPM6PQM,"I don't think that the subject of this documentary, Mr. Kurt Cobain, needs any introduction or explanation of his story within this review. What I will be illuminating for you is my impression of the plot, the animation, the direction, and the interviews. First things first I will explain the sequence of events of the movie:

PLOT: The movie starts off with interviews from Cobain's family members (Mom, Dad, Step-Mom, Sister) with them portraying Cobain as an excitable and artistically inclined child. Then it moves on to Cobain's teenage years which is surprisingly narrated by Cobain himself coupled with some impressive and powerful animation of the events he's describing. It is during his teenage years that Cobain ends up discovering punk rock music which lays the foundation of his musical career and contributes to his perspective of the world. We are shown the formation of Nirvana and the subsequent worldwide success of their landmark album Nevermind and how this sudden unexpected ascent to fame shocked the system of a man who for most of his life had been a loner. It is during all this fame commotion that an infamous article leaks out to Vanity Fair magazine alleging that Courtney Love had done heroin while pregnant with their daughter Frances Bean Cobain. After this event we are shown the weight it had on Cobain's psyche through his journal entries which display pages scribbled with words such as ""suicide"" ""violated"" ""kill yourself"" amongst other self-disparaging imagery. From there on there isn't much more than witnessing the descent into drug addicted suicidal depression and we're left off abruptly with Morgan not going into detail about the events of Cobain's death.

ANIMATION: Perhaps the most riveting part of this documentary is the animation sequences that portray Cobain's adolescence, adult years, and making the sketches and doodles in his journals come to life in animated form. In particular the animation sequences depicting Aberdeen Washington where Cobain grew up are remarkable in their tone and style capturing the damp somber atmosphere of suburban Washington in the early 1980's. Whether or not you find the content of the documentary intrusive or inaccurate the animation will likely remain a high point for you after leaving this movie.

DIRECTION: While I find Morgan's directing admirable in some respects I found that the viewer is prodded into a biased interpretation of the life of Kurt Cobain. I believe that the influence of people such as Courtney Love in regards to the progression of the story was far too strong to be taken objectively. Towards the end she is guiding the story pointing you in the direction of her ""recollection"" of the events and I have difficulty taking anything that woman says with any kind of validity.

INTERVIEWS: The assembling of a cast of figures who played a vital parts of Cobain's life was impressive with one individual, Cobain's father, being present which to my knowledge is a rare appearance for the elder Cobain. In the beginning the story is led mainly by his mother, sister, and somewhat by his father. While I did find Cobain's mothers version of events interesting I would have liked to have heard more about Cobain's father. Although Cobain and his father were often at odds and estranged his presence in this documentary is more of an afterthought when there was probably more that Morgan could have uncovered from his version of the events of Cobain's life. The same goes for Krist Novoselic and his role in the storytelling which seemed noticeably minimal when he was outside Cobain's family members (not including Love) the one who knew him the longest. Dave Grohl is absent from the film though Morgan did conduct interviews with him that will hopefully be released as extended footage because Grohl's perspective of Cobain and the events that happened would be interesting to hear more of. Despite coming into the story later on, Grohl did live with Cobain for several months and was Nirvana's longest drummer which makes Morgan's decision to exclude him from the final cut a little disappointing. One member of Cobain's history, perhaps one of the most crucial to Nirvana's success, Buzz Osborne of the Melvins absence, excluding a small soundbyte interview, is one that really should not have been overlooked. Cobain idolized the Melvin's before Nirvana's formation and was a groupee then later driver for the group. It is also worth mentioning that Cobain and Osborne both lived in Aberdeen and went to the same school together. Osborne was also the one who helped bridge the connection of Cobain and Novoselic and later to Grohl. Coincidentally, Osborne has come out and claimed that 90% of the film is ""bullsh_t"" and that many of the events are fabricated by Love and even by Cobain himself when describing his first attempt at losing his virginity.

OVERALL IMPRESSION: I have watched the movie numerous times now and I did enjoy the presentation of the events of Cobain's life. Seeing home videos of Cobain without the stresses of the media and biz and just in his natural environment was entertaining and enlightening on the life of a man whose had a great influence on both my life and the lives of many others. However, it is this footage that makes me feel guilty and disrespectful in some ways. There is plenty of footage and information within this movie that would probably mortify Cobain if he were alive to see it. Morgan and Frances Bean (who is an executive producer of the film) have said that the film was intended to ""humanize the myth"" of Kurt Cobain. Yes, Cobain's story has become mythologized with Cobain reaching near apotheosis status, I have to ask, why? Is it humanizing a person presenting sensitive personal thoughts and feelings to a mass audience of people who never knew nor will ever know this man? Does showing Cobain strung out on heroin during his daughters first hair cut or him discussing how he tried to lose his virginity really necessary to explain to fans that he was not a god but a person like the rest of us? In my opinion, no, and while my opinion is only my opinion, this movie didn't really affect my view of Kurt but rather his daughter for permitting this movie to be made. This isn't a humbling film of Cobain it's a humiliating exhibition of a man who only wanted privacy and his family but was blocked off from that by a depression disorder and drug addiction. It is the equivalent of ridiculing the mentally handicapped for being mentally handicapped.

But, the movie like his journals is out in the public consciousness, and unless it's a matter of principle your viewing won't change that. The film is good because of Cobain but its construction was permitted by horrible people, sadly similar to how Cobain's life was at the end.",1439683200,7,6798,4.917247386759582
7015042,1,B00TPM6PQM,"A sad exploitation of a talented man. As a film sanctioned by his estate, it was clear this was only part of the story and only the part that they wanted to put the spin on. What a disgrace to paint Kurt Cobain as nothing but suicidal long before the success of Nirvana. The 2 1/2 hour documentary is tolerable for only about the first hour. After that, the backstory of Kurt Cobain is polluted by the relationship choice he made and a highly biased or third-party influenced (or paid for?) fallacy that this young man, despite having fulfilled his goal of being a recognized musician and having the possibly unexpected pleasure of being a father, wanted nothing more than to die. The snippets from his journals seem taken very much out of context, again to push the idea this man was suicidal for years, and the Pink Floyd ""The Wall""-esque animations are cheesy and make this overly-long film a burden to continue to watch until the end. The saddest part for me was watching Kurt Cobain's mother and father, who both rejected him and would not allow him to live with him while he was a teenager, snivel about their loss. You didn't want him then, but you want him now? Many authoritative sources have debunked some of his mother's statements in this film. Very sad. Others who knew him personally adamantly have denied events portrayed in the film, even as the words came from Kurt himself, the sources noting that Kurt was quick to embellish or make up stories to cause subterfuge in the rampant media coverage at the time of his popularity. Also very telling is that Krist Novelic was interviewed for the film but not Dave Grohl due to ""scheduling conflicts."" In other words, he did not want or was not invited to participate and some PR firm concocted a reason for his absence that some may choose to believe. Watch the first hour to see some precious moments of Kurt as a youngster, skip the last 90 minutes unless you enjoy being manipulated.",1439337600,12,1948,4.600574712643678
7015043,4,B00TPM6PQM,"It's the best film out there on Kurt, but still its not great - his mother takes up far too much time and is irritating throughout, and lets be honest Kris is no raconteur, so while his contribution is interesting its so dry you feel like giving the guy a shake to wake him up.
Good footage though.",1439078400,,298,4.155172413793103
7015044,1,B00TPM6PQM,"In this movie, Botox-casualty Courtney Love would have you believe Kurt Cobain attempted suicide in Italy because she was about to break up with him. Or at least thinking about it. Or at least merely a mind-cross about it.

 If you believe that for five seconds, you have never dated a psychopath. I have. This is a classic example of what they do.

To have this particular psychopath pass this off as fact, at the tail end of a movie full of ridiculous non-facts similar to this, puts this squarely in comedy category. This movie is an unintentional comedy.

To have this psychopath sit back while unsuspecting fans click away contributing to her future rhinoplasty and facial implants, is an insult to one of the most creative songwriters in my lifetime.",1438819200,18,756,4.748091603053435
7015045,1,B00TPM6PQM,Like the other reviewers I felt this film dwelled on negative and force feed slander with Miss Love holding the spoon. More money for her and  how many times can she rape this man of his dignity?  I am ashamed of their daughter who appantly has inherited her mothers sociopathic behaviour. Morgen is a sycophant for Love and opportunist to get money and make miss hole happy to fabricate Cobians lack of balls persona. What an abusive woman. His mother seems like a narcsstic know it all who does look like her daughter in law. Weird!  Same clips of concert footage. Other stuff is voyeuristic for sadistic folk. Not me.,1436486400,13,620,4.618181818181818
7015046,2,B00TPM6PQM,"The book ""Heavier than Heaven"" is a Cobain biography that was supposedly unique in the fact that author Charles Cross was given, ""exclusive and unprecedented access to Cobain's journals and personal effects by Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, which the author poured over for years to create an intimate portrait of Kurt Cobain, the man, through his own words"", sound familiar?

This is just more propaganda spun by people bent on putting out stories that benefit themselves. There is no objectivity as can be seen in the limited and often poorly chosen interview subjects, the highlight being when a ""friend from school"" tears up over his last personal memory of Kurt being hearing Nirvana on the radio while pumping gas. Really, Brett Morgan?

Buzz Osborne called this documentary ""90% Bull..."" and thought I cannot speak with the same authority as he, I absolutely agree.

Very disappointed in Brett Morgan. I LOVED ""The Kid Stays in the Picture"", and this documentary like the latter is well made, but that old saying ""garbage in, garbage out"" rings true- even through all the cool animations and slick stylized editing. I don't want to blame the filmmaker, when Courtney Love gives you a pile of crap to make a movie out of, he did an impressive job making a movie out of a pile of crap, but at the end of the day he put his name on it as a documentary filmmaker and it's inexcusable when clearly the end result is so majorly slanted and rebuked by those who knew him well.

If there is any truth to the PR that this film is how Frances has come to truly know her father, then he should be doubly ashamed.",1436486400,6,1608,4.631578947368421
7015047,1,B00TPM6PQM,"I am giving this particular DVD 1 star because I haven't seen it yet, because I bought it from Germany and was unaware that there are different region codes for different parts of the world, and that if your DVD player is not set with the right region code, you cannot play any kind of foreign DVD in it.

7015048,1,B00TPM6PQM,"This manipulative movie tries very hard to maintain the suicide narrative  -and who could blame them for still trying when the public has already been falling for the suicide lie for 21+ years now?

In contrast with the indisputable hard evidence presented in the Soaked in Bleach movie, this movie fails miserably. For instance, it would have us believe the would've-been-ex-wife's version that he attempted suicide in Rome due to her merely ""thinking"" about cheating on him. Yet, in the Soaked in Bleach you can actually hear a recording of her explaining that she burned the Rome ""suicide note"" on the advice of a Seattle cop who told her it wouldn't do her any good because the note specifically stated he wanted a divorce.  Not to mention the audio recordings of their personal lawyer stating that his last request was to have Ms. ""Hole"" removed from his will... etc.  The cognitive dissonance of those who deny such hard evidence like this is amazing to behold.

*** The most interesting freudian slip of this movie though, is the part about his repeated nightmares of fighting for his life against people close to him and unknown people trying to kill him.  Apparently it was so frightening for him that he would've tried professional counseling for it but couldn't afford it.  Hmmm... ***

... Not to mention the forensics data, from all over the world, conclusively proving that EVEN FOR THE MOST HARDCORE HEROIN ADDICTS THERE IS A THRESHOLD, a dosage which no hardcore heroin addict can survive -and he had 3 times that amount in his body!! Yet still, the Seattle PD still maintains that despite his already being dead from the heroin, some supernatural power allowed him to die again from a ""self-inflicted"" shotgun wound to the head?

The bigger the lie the more likely it will be believed, and Kurt Cobain's worthless suicide-theorist ""fans"" are the shining example of how that works!  Simply put, once you rule out suicide, there is no other explanation for his death than murder.",1436140800,15,1994,4.855457227138643
7015079,4,B00TPM6PQM,"An uncomfortably close look at the private life of Kurt Cobain, short-term rock superstar and unwilling voice of a disgruntled generation. In the decades since his untimely suicide, Cobain's become an almost mythical figure, which isn't to say he was anything less at the height of his mid-90s popularity. To that end, it can be useful to ground his legacy in this way: intimate home video footage shows him unguarded behind closed doors, but also captures his steady state of mental decay. Where there's a gap in his video history between childhood (and it's heartbreaking to watch this happy little boy, knowing what tragedies his life held in store) and early adulthood, journal entries, artwork and beautiful animated segments keep the narrative moving. Clearly he was hanging on by a thread for longer than most could manage, pushed into a pit of despair by a bleak combination of abandonment, physical frailty, intense media scrutiny and constant, desperate drug abuse. It's not the Cobain many of us might want to see, or to believe in, but it feels so close to the truth that I could almost feel his breath on me. As an extreme close-up on one of my era's biggest names it's significant, with a killer soundtrack of course, and unexpectedly real. It frequently feels invasive, though, especially in the interviews with his parents (his stepmother's continuous, awkward smile is particularly unnerving) and I'm not sure I'm totally okay with the way it made me feel.

7015080,2,B00TPM6PQM,"The film was worth watching, but there are some major short-comings.  First of all, I think it was pretty biased and not really an objective ""documentary.""  The home videos were fascinating, but there was a definite angle (to show him as suicidal and on drugs the whole time).

I kind of wish they would've NOT interviewed Courtney for this film... her testimony ruined it for me!  The early videos of here were fine, but her present day interviews are complete B.S.  The things she said go against documented reality... she comes across (yet again) as a sociopath who lies to get fame, money & power.  She paints herself as the good guy in the relationship (she wasn't that into drugs!) and said Kurt was upset because she merely thought about cheating on him.  Kim Gordon from Sonic Youth (and others) have confirmed she was cheating on him with Billy Corgan.  No surprise.  Overall, the film seemed like pro-Courtney propaganda.

They also left out his life leading up to his death... I think many fans would have been interested in that.

7015085,1,B00TPM6PQM,"A Courtney Love approved movie and book that is an insult to the memory of Kurt Cobain.  This simpleton film which has been called the definitive biography on Cobain is anything but.  Both the film and book are no where near definitive look at this man's brief life.

Morgen spent little time describing his childhood, adolescence and Cobain's creative development not to mention the important influences that made him the creative force that he became. What he does focus on is painting him as a person bent on committing suicide from his early childhood. Large tracts of his early development are completely missing.  We hear his mother, who bizarrely has morphed into a Courtney look a like, and who threw her child out of her home on countless occasions sits in an easy chair reminiscing about the love she has for her lost son. Both parents contributed to the feelings of abandonment and low self esteem this man ultimately felt. Kurt Cobain was very vocal about this in countless interviews.

The only family member he had any respect for was his aunt Marie who is a musician and who turned him on to music and encouraged him to pursue this as his passion for it grew.  Again Cobain acknowledged this many times, yet Morgen fails to include her in the film or any mention of her.

The thing Morgan liked to talk about in promoting his travesty is the accessibility he was the first person/biographer/documentarian, you choose, granted permission and allowed to rummage through the Cobain storage facility. This is clearly not the case and an outright lie and he knows that.  His statement is contradicted in the very opening passages of the first chapter of Charles Cross's COBAIN UNSEEN.  Mr. Cross, who I am no fan of states univocally that he spend a great deal of time in the facility and to prove it his book is filled with charming artifacts from virtually every part of Cobain's 27 years.

This includes, artwork, a pair of converse sneakers, tee shirts Cobain collected over the years, childhood memories and the actually many more things than Mr. Morgan has shown his audience in Montage of Heck. Cross also has a much more interesting overall story to tell weaving interesting antidotes from friends and family that he clearly has thoroughly researched.  It has the detail any passing fan would appreciate and after reviewing it I thought perhaps Mr. Cross should have taken a stab at directing a film on Cobain's life because one seriously gets a better overall idea of Mr. Cobain's life, good and bad by reading this book rather than viewing Morgan's idiot's guide to Kurt Cobain's life.

Perhaps he didn't think his audience would be sophisticated enough to be able to handle a serious biography based on facts and not the video filler material, scenes that have nothing at all to do with the life of Kurt Cobain, included also was all the previously seen concert footage from MTV and concerts overseas, and animation that took liberties with Cobain's artwork in his journals, which have also been seen as they were sold a few years back when Love needed some fast cash.

Morgen choose to focus on the worst parts of Cobain's life from the very beginning, just look at the picture on the cover of the DVD box, charming!  The editing of this film paints a portrait biased and more than likely directed by his widow, even though Mr. Morgan would deny this, he is fooling no one when one views the film.  He choose these depressing snapshots carefully to illustrate the downward spiral beginning in his early childhood. Cobain was known to exaggerate and embellish stories about his youth and growing up, but Morgen took all of these and transformed them into the truth. I don't believe for one second Cobain lay on a train track with boulders on his chest only to find when the train came it was on the other track. Never happened, just like never lived under the bridge in Aberdeen.  Novoselic has gone on record stating that Cobain never slept there, they all hung out there but none slept there the tides would not have permitted it!

You cannot make a biography, definitive or not without explaining some these key incidents in Cobain's life.  All of these things would have proven difficult for anyone, i.e. his parents divorce, finding a friends body hanging from a tree in the woods, being tossed around his entire life from one home to the next, the feelings of abandonment and alienation this kid must have felt are all significant developmental issues that contributed to the artist we came to know as Kurt Cobain and all left out by Morgen.  This is not just taking journalistic license it is outright character assassination. Morgen should be ashamed of himself for leaving these things out.

Nick Broomfield in his film Kurt & Courtney was so much better at helping his audience understand who this man was and what his overall life was like.
Morgen during the promotion of this film stated that Broomfield should have served time for acknowledging and reporting the strange circumstances and the even stranger inconsistencies that surfaced following his demise.

There are many that strongly feel it was not suicide and there are outstanding  questions that have never been answered by Love or the Seattle Police Department that have only proven to fuel the flames of discussion over the possibility that Cobain was murdered and did not take his own life.  This would certainly make this film very important to Love as it paints her husband at every possible opportunity as a depressed suicidal drug addict. There are many who knew Cobain and the moods he was in at the time that would claim he was no such thing.

Then there is the issue of leaving out a key member of NIRVANA and close friend of Cobain's, Dave Grohl.  I have heard at least two deferent versions of why he was interviewed and then not included in the final version.

This is another reason I personally believe that his widow was calling the shots from behind the scenes.  It's no secret that she had for decades been feuding with both members of the band over financial matters.  She is on record ranting and raging like a psychotic sociopath in YouTube footage over how much money Dave Growl makes on a concert and that he has a platinum NIRVANA American express card while she does not.  I suppose she has forgotten that she was not a member of the band and that he was!  Then there was the incident where she accused him of trying to seduce her daughter.  Frances stepped in and put a stop to this indicating that she knew her mother had some issues and that the very thought of this was just ridicules!  I could go one but I think the point is clear that Ms. Love has proven herself on countless occasions to be mentally unstable. And who I their right mind would think that this person who has fought for control of Cobain at every possible opportunity would all of a sudden give this up to anyone let alone Brett Morgen who proceeded to do a quick hack job on the life of Kurt Cobain.",1433030400,17,6991,4.686274509803922

I don't believe for one second Cobain lay on a train track with boulders on his chest only to find when the train came it was on the other track. Never happened, just like never lived under the bridge in Aberdeen.  Novoselic has gone on record stating that Cobain never slept there, they all hung out there but none slept there the tides would not have permitted it!

You cannot make a biography, definitive or not without explaining some these key incidents in Cobain's life.  All of these things would have proven difficult for anyone, i.e. his parents divorce, finding a friends body hanging from a tree in the woods, being tossed around his entire life from one home to the next, the feelings of abandonment and alienation this kid must have felt are all significant developmental issues that contributed to the artist we came to know as Kurt Cobain and all left out by Morgen.  This is not just taking journalistic license it is outright character assassination. Morgen should be ashamed of himself for leaving these things out.

Nick Broomfield in his film Kurt & Courtney was so much better at helping his audience understand who this man was and what his overall life was like.
Morgen during the promotion of this film stated that Broomfield should have served time for acknowledging and reporting the strange circumstances and the even stranger inconsistencies that surfaced following his demise.

There are many that strongly feel it was not suicide and there are outstanding  questions that have never been answered by Love or the Seattle Police Department that have only proven to fuel the flames of discussion over the possibility that Cobain was murdered and did not take his own life.  This would certainly make this film very important to Love as it paints her husband at every possible opportunity as a depressed suicidal drug addict. There are many who knew Cobain and the moods he was in at the time that would claim he was no such thing.

Then there is the issue of leaving out a key member of NIRVANA and close friend of Cobain's, Dave Grohl.  I have heard at least two deferent versions of why he was interviewed and then not included in the final version.

This is another reason I personally believe that his widow was calling the shots from behind the scenes.  It's no secret that she had for decades been feuding with both members of the band over financial matters.  She is on record ranting and raging like a psychotic sociopath in YouTube footage over how much money Dave Growl makes on a concert and that he has a platinum NIRVANA American express card while she does not.  I suppose she has forgotten that she was not a member of the band and that he was!  Then there was the incident where she accused him of trying to seduce her daughter.  Frances stepped in and put a stop to this indicating that she knew her mother had some issues and that the very thought of this was just ridicules!  I could go one but I think the point is clear that Ms. Love has proven herself on countless occasions to be mentally unstable. And who I their right mind would think that this person who has fought for control of Cobain at every possible opportunity would all of a sudden give this up to anyone let alone Brett Morgen who proceeded to do a quick hack job on the life of Kurt Cobain.",1433030400,60,6991,4.686274509803922

7015088,4,B00TPM6PQM,"Documentarian, director and writer Brett Morgan (""Chicago 10"") takes a detailed look into Cobain's rise and fall and ultimate death at the tender age of 27.  With some interesting interviews with Cobain's parents, step-mother, sister, wife and Nirvana's bassist interspersed with non-stop computer graphics, we can see that Cobain predicted his demise at an early age.  He even dodged a bullet tying himself to train tracks as a teenager.

Unfortunately, the trouble teen managed to graduate to heroin while starting his band.  To some degree this may have heightened his creative juices, but in the end helped to destroy him.  Perhaps the most interested moments are with the home videos, especially those shot after Kurt married Courtney Love who was already a heroin addict.  No punches are pulled as there are numerous inclusions of Courtney's proud display of her breasts not to mention their decision to have a baby, all while strung out.  Love even admits to taking drugs while pregnant.  I really started squirming with the scenes of a skinny Cobain handling the baby when he could barely sit up straight.

Surprisingly absent from the documentary is an interview with band drummer, Dave Grohl.  Morgan digs deep finding pages of Cobain's, sometimes incoherent, writings which he sets to a backdrop of Nirvana songs, cartoons and other graphic art.  However, I don't think I ever heard the interviewer ask Love (now sober?) why they would want to have a baby while strung out on heroin.  The film is often uncomfortable to watch, but provides insight as to why the musical genius crashed and burned.",1432857600,4,1607,5.045454545454546

It's difficult not to be disgusted by Cobain and the knuckleheads in his inner circle.  You would expect a bunch of people this successful to be a little more composed and coherent.  Bassist Krist is particularly embarrassing in his youth. Cobain is mostly sullen and negative.  When Courtney Love's home video's are introduced, it's hard to stop yourself from trying to reach into the screen to save their baby from such horrible parents.",1432598400,2,542,4.923076923076923

Screenwriter: Brett Morgan

Cast: Kurt Cobain, Dave Grohl, Krist Novoselic, Courtney Love

After watching Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck, theres a sense of disillusionment left behind. Speculation on the tortured genius of Kurt Cobain has been a part of the zeitgeist since Cobains suicide in 1994. Films, books, and interviews have been levied by the dozen on this subject, and yet still theres an ominous curiosity surrounding the legacy of Kurt Cobain.

Filmmaker Brett Morgan (The Kid Stays in the Picture) looks to end that curiosity once and for all with a tremendously in-depth documentary composed of Cobains own journal writings, home video recordings, and media appearances sewn together and punctuated with animated reenactments of stories narrated by Cobain himself that were found on cassette tapes discovered by Morgan. As documentaries go, this is one of the most stylish and innovative examples the genre has ever seen. Morgan expertly designs his Rock Doc to be drenched in the art and music of its subject in some penetrating ways. And yet Morgans biggest success is also, perhaps the films greatest adversary: assuring the audience gets an authentic depiction of Cobain.

The film opens in traditional documentary fashion, shedding a light on Cobains upbringing, interviewing his family members, and showcasing through some wonderful home videos that Cobain was the typical suburban kid. However, the evolution of the Cobain we have come to revere is depicted to be a result of divorce, neglect, drugs, and irresponsibility. The boy we meet in the films opening scenes doubtless would go on to write I Hate Myself and Want to Die, but would likely not hate himself and want to die. Thus, as  Morgan does what good filmmakers do and lift the veil on his subject, I admit I became more and more turned off.

That being said, the film is quite excellent regardless of what one thinks about its subject. While Morgan occasionally may go for style over substance, documentary films often thrive on revealing truth and allowing an audience to absorb and decide for themselves; Montage of Heck ultimately delivers in that area.  Furthermore, Nirvana fans will revel in some of the exceptional footage assembled here, but the films honesty is unnerving at times. Watching a heroin-soaked Cobain try to interact with his baby daughter disgusts me to a previously unknown level of disgust.

Overall, what Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck does well is cast an intimate depiction rarely seen on film. The method is remarkably effective, but if you are a fan of Cobains, be prepared for some of the mystique to ware off. B

Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck is not rated, but received a TV-MA for its television broadcast. It has a running time of 2 hours and 15 minutes.",1431820800,11,2790,5.01948051948052
7015102,5,B00TPM6PQM,"I saw this was coming on and decided to record it. It was one of the most interesting things I've ever seen.

So, it starts with a young boy. One who seems to have a good, normal life. Things happen later on and the teenager seems to feel distant and alone. He really has no friends. He finds a friend. The friend is drugs. As a teen, the person makes many bad choices. Seems like they had no guidance.

The teen becomes a man. The man is still alone. He does find someone, but things do not work out. The man likes art, music and drugs. He is not bad at the art thing. The music is only worth anything because he is also a poet. Simple guitar parts with deep poetic lyrics make the man and his band stars. The man, who has not had much attention in a long time, knows not how to handle the fame. The man finds another lady. They create life. Watching the videos of him, his wife and child, looked so much like the videos of him as a child. Before everything seemed to loose control. The man and his wife seem so, so happy. They are a family. The man is no longer alone.

All that is great. But, there is a friend of that mans who will not go away. It is drugs. On top of that, mentally, the man seems to not be all-together. He thinks the only way to stop the pain, after his friend drugs stop working, is to take his own life. Now, at first, I thought, maybe if he had quit the music thing, his life would not have ended the way it did. But, he did not start out as a musician, just a troubled human. Suicide, I don't think, can just happen, depending on a job, partner, money or anything of that. It is something mental. A disease. If only the man had found the proper help, he may have been alive today.

They way they did this movie. It was amazing. It had him talking. Showed his art and his writing and it all worked perfectly. It was as if he were telling his story as a spirit.

I kind of regretted watching this at first. Only for one reason, seeing how happy his daughter was around him, the only thing I could think about was if she wondered where he was? Did she wait for him to come back? Made me so sad.

I will have to buy this movie as well as all of their music. I believe I got the unplugged DVD when I was in like 7th grade. I may also have a CDS of theirs. But I need them all.

Also, there was something about his wife. I just, got a bad feeling about her. I don't know what it was. She just, I don't know. Some leave you with a bad feeling. I think it was the way she answered the questions.

Something else. This guy does not seem to be like many think he was. He seems to have been a nerd who was afraid of many things and with a feeling a being alone and worthless. I just want to hug him and be his friend. It is such an odd feeling. I just feel so bad that his life ended the way that it did and that things happened to make him think that was the only way that it could. I truly hope he is finally at peace.",1431820800,5,2936,3.922689075630252
7015103,4,B00TPM6PQM,"This is a very well done documentary using a lot of Kurt's own narration and thoughts. That is until Courtney Love enters the scene. Right from the start she appears as a wanna be poser who latched on to Kurt's fame and talent. She is such a despicable person, it's almost painful to watch. It's shocking to realize that someone like Kurt who strove for perfection but shunned fame would end up with someone who used her relationship with him to grab the spotlight every chance she had. Not to mention, she could have been a positive force in his life and steered him away from suicidal thoughts. Instead she fed his angst with drugs and an empty head. Thanks Courtney.",1431388800,9,669,4.537190082644628
7015104,5,B00TPM6PQM,"This is the best Kurt documentary I've seen.  Unlike the others it has covered his LIFE and not just his death.  It actually didn't go into his death at all, which made it stand out even more.  Brett Morgen had access to Kurt's personal diaries (audio and video), art, home videos, and interviewed family members who had not yet ever been willing to be interviewed before.  It was very entertaining and informative, I was glued to the screen the entire time.  I'll be buying this when it comes out.",1431216000,6,498,4.550561797752809

7015106,5,B00TPM6PQM,"People are free to love him or hate him, or anything that falls in between those ends of the spectrum, but it can't be denied that Kurt Cobain had a profound and lasting influence on music and our culture in general (at least for the couple of generations that merged around that period in the early to mid 1990s).
Watching Montage of Heck served to take me back, in a sense, to the adolescent and teenage kid I was back then, listening to a cassette of Nevermind on a Walkman during the long bus rides to and from school...hoping that my batteries wouldn't die because I didn't want to have to listen to the kids around me, or god forbid be forced to interact with them.
This is a documentary that people should watch even if they hated Nirvana or felt that Cobain was junkie trash...because it gives us a glimpse into the life and the mind of a man who really was an artist, regardless of what you personally think of his talent or lack thereof...that's the thing about art, it's subjective and you don't have to like the art someone produces to recognize them for what they are and respect at least that aspect of the person.
The animated segments voiced over by Cobain's words were interesting, the old home video footage from his childhood was actually quite touching, the additional home video footage from the pre-success Nirvana performances were a nice addition as well, and the interviews from family, Krist Novoselic, and friends fleshed the rest out in such a way as to make this one of the most well-crafted documentaries I've seen.
I could be biased though, because I have loved Nirvana since the first time I heard them, and never stopped enjoying the music...and I won't forget the sense of shock I felt, being at track practice when the announcement came over the radio that he had killed himself. I never knew the man, though I would have loved to have met him when I was younger, but he did play a part in shaping me during those years.",1430956800,14,1955,4.52542372881356
7015107,1,B00TPM6PQM,"The few highlights of the movie are hearing Cobains own words, which I found to be the most most moving dialogue of the film. However, I had already heard similar dialogues in Azerrad's Documentary About a Son. Further, MOH claims to ""demystify"" KC, while I find, it does just the opposite. It reinforces the stereotypes I have already read about him, reinforcing the story of the fairy-tailish childhood, broken and shattered by divorce, forcing him into a drug addled adolescence, using art as an outlet, then into a media phobic, over sensitive artistic genius. Also, Love's interviews and home video tape seem to reinforce her own public stereotypes...drug addled, bully in the past, to a current plastic, image creating, propagandist. Probably very unfair to Love who maybe should have had more in-put. Even Tracy Marander's interview was not surprising, having seen and heard clips of interviews with her before. Of the few people interviewed, maybe with the exception of Kurt's father, she seems the most genuine and sincere. And why so few people interviewed?? Morgen claims we get to know Cobain through his art. I wonder what we would have thought of Van Gogh if we had only analyzed his life through his art? Morgen keeps claiming it was his unfettered access to the storage locker of Kurt and Courtney's life story that helped create this Doc. Sadly, many of the critics seem to think it is Golden. But I say, sorry Morgen, I think it turns out to be a Golden Egg, shiny and shallow with little added value to the Bio of Kurt Cobain.",1430956800,13,1545,4.81203007518797
