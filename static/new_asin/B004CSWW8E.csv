8463183,5,B004CSWW8E,I spent hours trying to install a new front door and get it to close correctly. More to it than what you may think. I looked to youtube for some help and ran across a video he had posted. I was impressed so bought the dvd and learned how to correct my problems and more. Money well spent,1481587200,,287,3.9655172413793105
8463184,1,B004CSWW8E,I would not buy this again.  I also bought suggested tools on DVD which I will never use for hanging a door.  Says nothing about build-up on door and used the door jam as the six food level he said was necessary.  Also says/shows nothing on tear out and replace.,1478908800,,262,4.2
