1047190,5,630553764X,"Welcome to Holly Springs... home of murder, mayhem and catfish enchiladas.""
A friend and I decided to watch a movie late last night on Netflix and I grudgingly settled on Cookie's Fortune. I didn't expect to have loved it as much as I do now. I laughed so hard, I cried.

We first notice Willis (Charles S. Dutton) stealing some alcohol from a bar and sneaking past some cops more interested in talking about fishing than patrolling, passing a church sign whose 'Thought of the Day' reads: ""Pride and Pretense are the Jookeys of Misfortune."" That should be a hint about what this film is about. Not only is the sign misspelled, but the idea of The First Presbyterian Church putting on a play about Salome for Easter Sunday is a bit off.
Cast of characters included the director, Camille Dixon (Glenn Close) who is a pushy mean lady always putting down her younger sister Cora (Julianne Moore) who seems to be a bit slow. Then there's Emma (Liv Tyler) Cora's daughter who just came back to town who's in a yo-yo relationship with Jason (Chris O'Donnell) the jailor.

When Jewel Mae, a.k.a ""Cookie"" (Patricia Neal) ends up dead the whole community of Holly Springs is thrown into a whirl trying to figure out who would kill her. Of course all evidence points to Willis, but the community knows better then to suspect him, (he was her best friend after all..) but when an investigator from a nearby town comes, they have to detain Willis on suspicion of murder.

It's definitely a Southern Gothic dark comedy. The ending was unexpected and pure irony, eerie really (""I did good, didn't I?"") but I loved that it's a movie that focused on the town as a whole and not really a certain individual. Not only that, I felt like I knew all these characters, and there were some characters I wanted to know more about. For example, Jack Palmer (Donald Mofatt) the one lawyer in Holly Springs, who rides around town on a bicycle with a bow-tie or Mr. Johnson (Rufus Thomas) the local bar owner (""Took it. Took it. That's what I said. Took it."") who is hilarious without trying to be. Even when they are unlovable they are comedic. It's a story about strong friendships and community, and most importantly dysfunctional family. I highly recommend it.",1319932800,,2236,4.641414141414141
1047191,1,630553764X,This DVD did NOT work at all. It would not play in any DVD player. I was very disappointed. Do not buy this product,1311724800,,115,3.8333333333333335

1047193,5,630553764X,"OK, I am an Altman fan who has always wanted to see this.  In my viewing, it is a complete success for all the reasons I like Altman:  the plot is almost secondary to the development of the characters, who are extremely quirky in a banal yet exotic environment.  The acting is superb, but none of the characters is what you would expect the same actors to be from the personas one knows from their other work.  Liv Tyler is a bit of a bimbo from a chaotic family who now leads a disorganized life.  Moore is her ""mother"", the really dumb pillar in her crazy manipulative sister's life (Close).  O'Donnell is a bumbling youngster cop, also very dumb.  Dutton, who is an excellent character actor as a handy man and good all round guy, is the star.

The actors really display a wonderful chemistry onscreen, from the comedy of errors that Close unleashes to the family love that Tyler feels for Dutton.  It makes the story hold together tightly.  However, as always with ALtman, it is the detail that really makes this memorable:  in every scene there was something that made me chuckle, some subtlety that is the unique synergy between directions and allowing actors to be creative that is an Altman hallmark.

Warmly recommended.

Unfortunately, the formatting of the DVD was lousy, on one of those framed screens.  I wish I knew how to screen for such things!",1305417600,,1360,4.6125

1047197,5,630553764X,"I saw this movie in the theater 10 years ago, and not since (though I recently purchased it). What I remember is that from the very start, I was predicting turns in the movie that never happened:

1. Charles Dutton's character Willis is drunk and stumbling down the street in a small southern town and two white cops see him. I expect an immediate arrest. It doesn't happen.

2. I believe Willis steals a fifth from the liquor store so I expect an arrest. It doesn't happen.

3. Willis breaks into the kitchen of a home. I expect trouble and an arrest. It doesn't happen.

4. I expect a scene between Willis and ""Miz"" Cookie when she comes down from her room in her pajamas and robe. It doesn't happen. He calls her ""Cookie"" first of all, and she's offers to make him coffee.

5. When Willis gets arrested for Cookie's murder, I expect the sheriff to be the stereotypical pot-bellied ""boy""-calling sheriff. He isn't. He doesn't even lock Willis' cell.

And the stereotypes get knocked down one after the other. Glen Close's church isn't southern Baptist. Cookie's granddaughter comes to share an unlocked cell with Willis (I believe she gets ""locked up"" with him).

Lots of nice surprises in this unusual flick. As you can see, I remember it most for what it turned out NOT to be than what it was. Loved it for that.",1260230400,3,1316,4.527426160337553

I like Altman a lot on occasion (Player, Nashville, a few others), and not so much at times, like here. This could have been tighter, and despite nice turns from Close, Tyler et al, it's too stagey, and too close to its theatrical source to be a great movie.
It got boring enough by halfway that I turned it off and watched the rest later.
Altman is trying to be Faulkneresque but never quite gets there. This is the South via Hollywood, and misses the real grit and nastiness behind the lace curtains.
Nice try, though.",1196467200,,531,4.418367346938775
1047259,1,630553764X,"Meandering,lazy loafing screenplays with eccentric characters of which I am given no reason to care about or identify with put COOKIE'S FORTUNE, for my second lifetime viewing since 1999,nearly at the top of my  (very small I might add) all-time most disliked films.

I can understand that certain people will like this film-especially those who enjoy small town ""crazies"" and director Robert Altman devotees. There is nothing wrong with that. I have enjoyed both small town ""eccentrics"" like in CRIMES OF THE HEART and loved Altman's GOSFORD PARK (one of my favorites).

So why did I truly hate this film? For me, eccentric characters still need to have some kind of human quality that causes me to either identify with or like or dislike. They need to have some ""Raison d'etre"" or ""je ne sais quoi"".This film had not one character that I believed for a minute. They all seemed to me to be mere caricatures. As much as I love Glenn Close and Julianne Moore, their characters I could not buy. I could have slapped Charles Dutton,Lyle Lovett,Patricia Neal,Chris O'Donnell and Liv Tyler. The whole story is so outlandish that there is nothing about it that I could begin to remotely take seriously. Even the most outlandish ""Southern"" screenplays that I can think of still had some character that was an anchor. This film was cut loose and set adrift into a land where lobotomies seemed to be the norm! If that was the point,then Altman succeed and it was wasted on me.

As far as giving god-like attributes to everything that any director does,Altman included, I have to say that this film had me uneasily squirming and sighing within minutes of the opening,which concluded only minutes before the climax, which I found cleverly ironic,but not enough to atone for the 100 minutes that preceded it. I am far from an ""action"" film afficienado. I enjoy slower-paced films. But a snails-paced screenplay with unlikeable characters who undergo no change (and throw in a lazy harmonica and strummed banjo and guitar occasionally) is just pure mayhem, and whatever Altman intended to convey here was a waste of time and film stock in my estimation.

I hated it in 1999 and I still hate it in 2007. No more viewings necessary.",1194739200,,2217,4.823684210526316
1047260,3,630553764X,"Southern gothic is a pretty tough genre to tackle, especially in movies.

But Robert Altman gave it his best with ""Cookie's Fortune,"" a little black comedy taking place over the Easter weekend. He crammed it with eccentricity, odd twists and likably atypical characters, but the second half gets a bit carried away by self-consciousness weirdess and melodrama.

It's the day before Easter in the Southern town of Holly Springs. Pushy, self-righteous spinster Camille Dixon (Glenn Close) and her mentally challenged sister Cora (Julianne Moore) are rehearsing the Easter play, ""Salome."" Cora's rebellious daughter Emma (Liv Tyler) has just come back to town, as her naive boyfriend (Chris O'Donnell) has become a cop.

Meanwhile, eccenric matriarch Cookie Orcutt (Patricia Neal) has become obsessed with joining her dead hubby, Buck. So she shoots herself, minutes before her Camille arrives. Fearful of the scandal a suicide would cause (""Suicide is a disgrace! Only crazy people commit suicide!""), Camille fakes a robbery and murder scene.

There's only really one suspect: Willis (Charles S. Dutton), Cookie's handyman/cook/best pal, who lives on the premises and was polishing the guns the night before. As Camille revels in her presumed inheritance, Willis and Emma help piece together the evidence left behind -- and unwittingly unearth some peculiar family secrets.

""Cookie's Fortune"" isn't a typical murder mystery. Sure, the cops are ferreting out clues and motives, but Robert Altman creates a town that basically moves along at a steady, languid pace, and nobody really gets worked up -- even a murder doesn't ruffle them enough to make them lock the cells.

And Altman stirs up plenty of black comedy and amusing dialogue (""A condition under which, in times of extreme stress, her blood will not clot properly. You ever seen her suffer from this condition?"" ""Unfortunately not""). He even manages to weave in some subtle commentary on family and hypocrisy as well as some racism -- nothing explicit, but you can sense it in the way Camille treats Willis.

The problem? At times Altman tries to be melodramatic, but only ends up seeming overwrought. And similarly, he piles on the down-home quirkiness too thickly at times, such as a sheriff announcing that he knows Willis is innocent ""'cause... I've fished with him!""

Dutton is the heart and soul of this movie, as the lovable, friendly Willis, who finds himself arrested for a crime he didn't commit just because nobody can think of another suspect. Patricia Neal and Julianne Moore turn in solid performances as the crabby matriarch and the backward Cora (who isn't as ""dumb"" as she appears). Liv Tyler's performance is a bit stilted, but she evens out by the last half.

""Cookie's Fortune"" is one of those movies that is enjoyable despite its flaws. It's too self-consciously quirky at times, but still amusing and well-written.",1177200000,2,2894,5.166666666666667
1047261,5,630553764X,"Dear reader,
Please see this movie.
It glows with human warmth and sympathetic humor.
It will definitely touch your heart if you will let it.
I was raised in the south and this movie makes me weep with appreciation.
...Grew up surrounded by the wise innocence, requisite tolerance  and careful humor ,that strange small town eccentrics require of others.
It is touching to see how big city values and expectations are out of place in a small town where everyone knows everyone else quite well.
There is  wry depiction of the role of a certain brand of Southern Protestantism as an acceptable, necessary, but rather shallow and ridiculous source of moral values.
Altman shows there is virtue in the lives of those who just live respectfully -while actually bewildered , affectionately loyal, and playful  with those  they  find around them.
It is about my favorite movie, along with LOCAL HERO.

note:
There was a non-racist south that is seldom talked about and largely unknown to the outside.
They were not the intellectual and moral heroes
who served the underground railroad to help slaves escape.
That of course was noble and great.
There was also the texture of small rural outback communities where there was interbreeding of Native Americans and Afro-Americans with the
various Europeans. A mutual understanding , shared passages, and live- and -let- live, was more the character of this phenomena.
It is good to see an understated honoring of this historical fact.

Okay. Thanks for listening.",1171584000,2,1501,5.028225806451613

No one today can handle an ensemble cast of pros and make each one look like a star. Who else could've gotten old-pro Patricia Neal out of retirement? If you don't like Altman, you're obviously missing something that the rest of us already know...he's smart! It's no secret that Mr. Altman hates pretense. ""MASH"", ""The Player"", ""Gosford Park"", ""Nashville"" and on & on...the man has fun poking fun at phonies. ""Cookie's Fortune"" is no different. Almost exclusively working with original screenplays, he can play his game and say his piece. Anne Rapp's screenplay must've put him in director heaven. Glenn Close is pretty much the centerpiece here, a woman sure of her position and unwilling to bend. She's marvelous and totally unlikeable. The great Ms. Neal is on screen, alas, too short a time. Like an older version of her Oscar-winning role in ""Hud"", she's tougher than nails, and wonderful. Julianne Moore ditches the glamour, appearing mostly without make-up, belying her well-known beauty. Charles S. Dutton is customarily confident and endearing, as are Liv Tyler & Chris O'Donnell (though a previous reviewer didn't think so). Altman likes using Lyle Lovett, and he's reliable here in a small role. Ned Beatty and, especially, the great Courtney B. Vance fill out the big name cast effectively. Like all Altman films, one must pay attention to the script, because, though leisurely paced, the dialogue flies by. To reiterate the plot would be senseless, but one of my favorite lines was, in reference to the crime scene, they said Close's character has ""negative blood""; when Beatty is asked why he's so sure Dutton didn't do it, he, matter-of-factly says ""I fish with him!"". (This is almost a running gag...I love running gags). Again, I must say, Altman is wonderful when he works with dozens of people at once, because he gives each one a distinct character and motivation, not to take away from the screenwriter, though Altman is also known for improv. ""Cookie's Fortune"" is subtly funny and endearing; the craziness of human nature is given full reign. This film was recognized by the Independent Film Awards, but the Academy somehow overlooked it, released too early in the year. (Most of those old geezers don't think that far back...) Glenn Close was deserving of a nomination, as was Altman. Attention to detail is an Altman trait, too, and he doesn't disappoint.

Some reviewers have taken this film as a slur on Southerners, but I don't take the characters in ""Cookie's Fortune"" as real Southerners. They're characters of classic farce, with the central character a bossy, self-dramatizing  fussbudget who tries to control everyone's life and ends up paying the piper for her presumption. Not for nothing is she named Camille! Camille, played by Glenn Close, starts the whole plot going by trying to cover up her aunt's suicide, thinking it shameful that anyone in HER family would dare to show such weakness. Her actions in turn uncover a whole raft of small-town secrets, including one of her own. Close is hilariously over the top as Camille, and the rest of the huge, illustrious cast matches her. It's lovely to see Patricia Neal, who plays the Cookie of the title, again after so many years, and Charles S. Dutton is a total delight as Willis, Cookie's caretaker/best friend.

1047283,4,630553764X,"There seems to be only two legendary directors that most actors are dying to work with. One is Woody Allen. The other is Robert Altman, who made Cookie's Fortune. Both men's careers have run along parallel lines. Each enjoyed huge commercial success from the late 1960s through the 1970s [Altman directed M.A.S.H. and Nashville], after which both went out of fashion. In the late 1980s, they regained some, but not all, of their former glory. Allen sticks to the neurosis of New Yorkers, while Altman prefers to show the madness and eccentricities of people in many different regions. In Cookie's Fortune, he gives us a loving look at the rather unique behavior of some Southern characters.
It is nearly Easter in Holly Springs, Mississippi. Camille Orcutt [Glenn Close] is directing the annual Easter play at a local church. Her sister, Cora Duvall [Julianne Moore], has the lead role in it. Meanwhile, Cora's daughter, Emma [Liv Tyler], is back in town. She is living in the back of a van and working at the local fish market. Her old flame, Jason [Chris O'Donnell], has become a town policeman and soon finds out she has returned. Lester Boyle [Ned Beatty], a much older cop, goes fishing at every opportunity. Willy Richland [Charles Dutton] cheerfully goes about his business of taking care of the elderly Jewel Mae ""Cookie"" Orcutt [Patricia Neal], who is Camille and Cora's aunt.
Life goes on apace in Holly Springs until the afternoon of Good Friday, when Camille goes over to Cookie's and finds her dead of a gunshot wound. It looks like sweet, harmless old Cookie may have been murdered. The discovery sets in motion the charming comedy that is Cookie's Fortune, the best movie about the South so far this year.
I think the reason so many performers like to work with Altman is that he, by his own admission, trusts their instincts as actors. He doesn't dictate to them. This method does not work for less secure directors, but for Altman, it creates some of the best work we can hope to see. So strong is the acting in this film that we tend not to notice some parts of the story that don't work very well. Charles Dutton and Julianne Moore are especially strong. It is always a treat to see Pat Neal, who would have dominated the picture, if her character hadn't been bumped off a third of the way through. [For young viewers, Neal was a great film star, whose career reached its peak in Hud with Paul Newman in 1963. A couple of years later, she suffered a series of devastating strokes and had to learn how to talk and to walk all over again.]
Altman gently but firmly shows is some of the ways of true Southerners - the need to put appearances over truth, the love of the theatrical, the willingness to bend the rules when it comes to being neighborly. Best of all, we see how that Old South graciousness is often a mask for all sorts of devious tricks. Everyone is wise to these, but often falls for them nonetheless. I have often thought that these methods were refined back in the dreadful days following the Civil War - a way of getting things done under the eyes of unruly and unrefined Yankees!
Altman is far less satirical here than usual here, and this decision may have lessened the impact of the movie. Still, it's a great treat for those who like their humor dry and their characters rich.",1016755200,,3314,4.6091370558375635

1047330,4,630553764X,"Cookie's Fortune is about a murder, the investigation that ensues and the long covert secrets that are revealed. The setting is Mississippi, where everybody knows everybody else, and more often then not, everybody is everybody else's cousin. It's the same place where Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe once hunted down some inbred racist good ol' boys and the ku kux klan in Alan Parker's Mississippi Burning. Even if a black man is taken in for the murder of his white landlady/friend/confidant (or is she?), Altman's peculiar little slice of some very distinct lives is as far away as you can get from that sensationalist film. For starters, the old lady, Cookie Orcutt (Patricia Neal) has, quiet happily, committed suicide to join her departed husband. There has been no murder. The ""investigation"" involves friendly chats with the local witnesses where the police clerk, a cute wide eyed young woman ponders complex questions in the vein of ""How can I strike Eddie's statement from the record. I'm recording this, not writing it"". Meanwhile, the ""suspect"", the immensely amiable Willis (Charles Dutton) sits in an open cell, playing scrabble with the police chief Lester Boyle, who believes Willis to be innocent because he has ""fished with him"". The suspect's stay is so relaxed that he complains that he may die from the lavish prison food, incidentally cooked by the Police chief's wife, before he gets anywhere near an electric chair.
In an Altman film, the setting is almost as important as his numerous characters. In this case, it is Holly Springs, with its staples and archetypes. The camera wonders around town, lazily observing them, slowly revealing the plot, which is obvious and serves only to highlight those archetypes. The story, which, despite a couple of twists near the end is just an excuse to observe this inbred, particular architecture of inter-locking relationships. There is Camille (Glen Close), Cookie's niece who discovers Cookie's body and eats the suicide note because ""no one commits suicide in this family"". This is her contribution to the plot, more important to Altman is the fact that she is a pompous, elitist eccentric who is currently directing a ""revised"" Oscar Wilde's version of Salome for which she shares a writing credit. Her sister, a ravishing moron, Cora(Julianne Moore)is the star who could hypnotize a bull in heat with her ""performance"". Cora's daughter is Emma (Liv Tyler), a free spirit who rejects her family, and is in love with a local doofus cop, Jason Brown (Chris O'Donnell) who in turn is acting her deranged aunt's play. And so goes the circle.
The town of course is comically under prepared for a murder investigation. Much of the humor comes from the way these people's child-like reactions to what other more cynical movie characters would react with requisite formality. In truth the film is difficult to classify. Partly a comedy of manners or a gentle farce or a tour of a deep fried utopia even a tale of one man's camaraderie with his town. It has a lightness of touch, that would make those frenzied, desperate young directors jealous. After the useless, Grishamed, plot-driven Gingerbread Man, I think the best classification for this little gem would simply be ""A Robert Altman film"".",977875200,,3255,5.029629629629629

1047333,2,630553764X,"I will be the first to admit that, when it comes to evaluating the films of Robert Altman, I seem to suffer from some sort of critical blind spot. No director has seemed to me so critically overrated, yet, because of his  obvious qualities of innovation and originality, one feels guilty being so  negative. Certainly, the one thing no one can ever accuse Altman of doing  is playing it safe, of selling out to the principles of commercial  moviemaking. His works have always remained almost doggedly original in  both form and content despite the inevitable temptation to compromise in  the name of box office success. Admirably, Altman has tenaciously insisted  on remaining his own man, even at the expense of gleaning financial failure  after financial failure. He certainly has his avid admirers, who worship  him even more for this streak of defiant iconoclasm particularly in the  face of an industry whose very life's blood is found in the celebration of  the almighty buck and in which praise and recognition are often determined  by how many tickets a director is able to sell. Yet, ironically - and even  acknowledging the validity of all those previous statements - in my  opinion, Altman hit his artistic peak all the way back in 1970 with `MASH,'  his one certifiable box-office smash. His career has consisted of a  steadily careening slide downhill ever since, despite the fact that most  major critics, especially through the 1970's, managed to elevate his  reputation to near-mythical proportions, enshrining him as a paragon among  American filmmakers. Admittedly, Altman practically pioneered the  multi-character format so often employed by independent filmmakers today.  The irony is that their films are often more interesting and engaging than  Altman's own.
All this is preparatory to discussing Altman's latest film,  `Cookie's Fortune,' a generally entertaining, offbeat comedy that again  falls far short of greatness. At least, this latest work boasts an  intriguing plot line that helps to sustain our interest - and, it must be  stated right at the outset, that the second half of the film is far more  engaging than the first, partly because of the intricacy of the story. Set  in a small, sleepy Southern town, the narrative revolves around the  complications resulting from the unexpected death of an aging matriarch  named Cookie. We, in the audience, know the demise is the product of a  suicide but, thanks to the machinations of a bitter, deceitful niece of the  woman, Camille Dickson, who fears that suicide will be seen as too great a  cause for scandal, the town's members are led to believe the death is the  result of murder. When suspicion falls on Willie, an innocent black friend,  the only person in fact still loyal to Cookie in her old age, Camille  remains determined not only to stay closemouthed about the truth, but also  to do all in her power to see this guiltless man tried and condemned for  the murder. The film is at its most enjoyable near the end, as we watch,  with undisguised glee, the ironic hand of fate inexorably closing in on  this despicable comic villainess.
So far so good. Somehow, though we  suspect that the narrative is supposed to be of secondary importance to the  gallery of eccentric characters Altman and writer, Anne Rapp, have  assembled for us. Unfortunately, with few exceptions, the people in the  story never get much beyond their one-note stereotypical nature. Cookie  (embodied by the legendary and magnificent Patricia Neal) is essentially  the typical crusty old family matriarch, straight talking and no-nonsense,  who loves her devoted caretaker far more than her conniving kinsmen. Her  niece, Camilla Dickson (Glenn Close), emerges as that great old Southern  stereotype: the appearance-conscious, misanthropic moral gargoyle who will  stop at nothing to retain the family dignity and honor in the face of a  less-than-palatable reality. Camilla's sister, Cora (Julianne Moore),  though she does get the satisfaction of exacting worm-turning vengeance at  the end (albeit it comes through a change in character quite unprepared for  in the screenplay), basically comes across as a gaping-mouthed simpleton  who inexplicably allows her more dominant sister to manipulate her every  move. The remaining characters are equally shallow and two-dimensional:  Emma, the sassy young rebel of the family who stands for truth and justice  in the face of her family's seeming madness; Willis, the innocent harmless  black man who loves Cookie far more than the members of her own  self-absorbed family; and, most drearily of all perhaps, the dimwitted  young deputy who serves as a constant source of exasperation for the other,  more seasoned officers in his department.
The comic level of the film  seems, at times, distressingly low. We are supposed to derive humor from  the slipshod antics of the investigative authorities on the case, from the  fact that the prisoner is allowed to sleep in a wide open jail cell and  from the sight of the jailers and their prisoner playing a friendly game of  scrabble together. In fact, for the first 45 minutes or so, the film seems  to wander aimlessly, searching for a purpose, plot and tone. Luckily, after  the suicide, Altman and Rapp pick up the pace and engage us enough in the  story to make us eager for its eventual resolution. The actors generally  perform their roles admirably, saddled as they are with the fact that the  authors have provided very little room for them to explore their characters  in much detail or depth.
I can't say, based on my overall track record  with Altman films, that I was expecting a lot from `Cookie's Fortune.' But,  given its extraordinary number of positive reviews and the never-dying  quality of hope that comes with eternal optimism, I sure wish it had been  better.",964742400,2,5844,5.0588235294117645
1047334,4,630553764X,"When a friend first told me about this movie when it came out, I got the feeling it was Tennesse Williams on acid, and therefore didn't risk the seven dollars (not including popcorn- and that's not New York).  But when  another friend who has completely different tastes told me about it a month  ago, I had to see it.
This movie is so elegantly crafted via Patricia  Neal, Glenn Close, and Charles S. Dutto that it is certainly worth seeing  twice, as I did, and owning.  The first time I didi myself and the movie a  disservice by being a little drowsy while seeing it.  That has the same  effect of being a little drowsy while going to the museum.  And yet, the  treasures of writing, character play, plot etc. asre so powerful, elgant  and vivid in this movie you will not miss the best parts, and love the  while at the end, as you laugh from the heart.
Worth seeing.  Give it a  chance, and youl will wenjoy it.",962323200,4,917,4.311764705882353
1047335,2,630553764X,"Well, here's another movie that makes  (good-natured?)  fun of Southern folks.  *Cookie's Fortune*  takes place during Easter, a time for egg-hunts and -- apparently -- a production of  *Salome*  at the local church.  Meanwhile, an old lady, sick of the indignities of old age, cheerfully  commits suicide, only to be discovered by her greedy niece who might  benefit financially if she can paint the suicide as a  ""murder"".  There's also a fun-loving alcoholic  (Charles Dutton)  who never drinks  before the evening news and charmingly returns  ""borrowed""  bottles of bourbon from the local bar.  Believe it or not, he's important  to the denouement.  However, the romance between a young cop and a local  girl irritates -- it's one of those Altman  ""flourishes""  that  typically clog up his movies.  In fact, the entire police investigation is  like a hardened artery -- sluggish.  We couldn't care less because we know  from the get-go not only what really happened but even how it will all turn  out;  therefore we have to focus on the characterizations. . . .
I  suppose I can really get on Glenn Close's and  (the usually faultless)  Julianne Moore's cases for their dreadful overacting, but that wouldn't be  fair -- as a long-time  ""auteur"", Altman must shoulder the blame  for his vision.  Making the sisters into cartoons was unnecessary, and  typifies the contempt intellectuals like Altman have for the South.  (But  of course SOUTHERN intellectuals have contempt for the South.)  But this  still doesn't exonerate Ms. Close completely, an actress well-known for  tearing scenery with bared fangs.  Charles Dutton was the best thing in the  movie;  it would seem he's the hero, but Altman isn't very interested in  him for some reason -- a shame, considering our choices herein.  Oh, and it  was wonderful to see Patricia Neal again, however briefly.  Welcome back to  you, ma'am.
At any rate, I could only recommend this movie to someone  with a personal interest.  It's beginning to look like  *The Player*  was  Mr. Altman's last hurrah -- he's not made a really good movie since then.  Ah well. . . .",960163200,4,2117,4.925287356321839
1047336,4,630553764X,"Altman is typically praised for his rambling concept films, like Nashville, but his point is usually to capture a sense of place. Sometimes he's able to do it and get across the characters and have a catchy plot.  The Player was the priemier example of that, and this is in that vein. What  I remember best is the corrigated barn wall lit by a flourescent light, in  the rain. I'm not sure how well it comes across on the little screen, but  you'll like this small gem.",953251200,,469,4.35632183908046
1047337,4,630553764X,"After watching Cookie's Fortune I didn't really know what to think! I liked it....it was funny...but at the same time it was a very sad story...and that left me...well, in a state of confusion! Camille Dixon is  definitely the most fetching character. She is utterly irritating, but  still very amusing.... Glenn Close is wonderful....what more is there to  say!",951868800,,362,5.101694915254237
1047338,2,630553764X,"I know a lot of people will think I didn't like this movie because I didn't ""get it,"" but I'm of the opinion that there's not much to get.  I like quirky characters, unusual plots, offbeat humor, etc., but  none of the above were particularly outstanding in this film.  I didn't  empathize with any of the characters.  In fact, I think I wanted to slap  nearly every one of them by the time the film was over.  What a waste of my  time.  Avoid this one, it's a stinker.",949104000,,469,4.179775280898877
7891400,5,630553764X,"A brilliant dark comedy set in the late Twentieth Century Deep South. It's one of Altman's best, to my mind. He captures the incongruity of racism existing alongside close inter-racial relationships of many years. The only slight weakness is Glynn Close's not-quite-convincing Mississippi accent. I've watched it at least five times and will keep watching my DVD copy.",1517788800,,368,5.362068965517241
7891401,1,630553764X,Loved the movie when I saw it before. But sending this copy back because it has very distracting foreign subtitles that take up a good part of the screen. It is supposed to be for USA audience which means if there are foreign subtitles you should be able to delete them. Will keep looking for correct copy.,1514332800,,306,4.385964912280702

7891403,5,630553764X,"Robert Altman belonged to that reduced of directors who can dive in different issues without any problem (Think about in John Huston or Billy Wilder, for instance).

And this film is not the exception. He gathered a formidable crew headed by the wonderful performance of Charles Dutton, Glenn Close, Patricia Neal, Julianne Moore, Liv Tyler and Ned Beaty plus the original plot (close to a certain surrealistic inspiration) lead to a very amusing film with well known Altman's proneness to acidic comment here and there about the social corpus.
