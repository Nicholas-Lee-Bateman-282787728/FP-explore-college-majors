8196516,1,B000QJ3QMY,"THIS IS A PIRATED, UNAUTHORIZED COPY OF LUCY NEATBYS DVD !!!
DO NOT BUY IT! Lucy Neatby is aware of these pirated copies, by the way. This is breaking copyright law.",1429315200,6,165,4.354838709677419
8196517,5,B000QJ3QMY,"Lucy is the master of double knitting. She manages to bring out the fun in a technique that seems tedious and time consuming to most knitters.  Her approach is clear, concise and inspiring.

There has been some confusion about whether the DVDs being sold are pirated.  Lucy has confirmed that they are NOT.  There are, however, copies of these videos being sold as digital downloads.  They are described as ""apps.""  The only legitimate place to purchase and download digital versions of her DVDS is at her web site, lucyneatby.com.",1429228800,,531,4.910112359550562
8196518,5,B000QJ3QMY,"I'm only half way through this but so far, it makes sense to me and I am actually doing it.  The color is great, you can see exactly what she is doing and I love learning new things on DVD.  Won't be disappointed and well worth the money!",1387411200,4,238,3.9375
8196519,5,B000QJ3QMY,I finally made the decision to purchase the DVD and it exceeded my expectations.  I watched it all the way through 1st and then watched in segments.  It's almost like Lucy is sitting next to you and helping you along.  Would recommend this to any one wanting to learn a new technique.,1364428800,8,284,4.423076923076923
8196520,5,B000QJ3QMY,"First chapter, first lesson, double knitting, cast on, knit, slip, knit, slip, how much easier could it be and so well shown and described.

Learn how to avoid using 4 or 5 double point needles to make an open or closed tube.  Useful for socks, fingers, stuffed animals, pocket, and of course double knitting a design.  Learn that magic Loop method isn't the only way to do easy.  Easier than magic loop.

Open up a whole new avenue of thought about knitting and how to do things.

How I watch instructional knitting DVDs is I knit something I know how to do and watch the DVD on my computer...  it's like everyone does, knit and watch tv..  only I am learning..  First time I watch the DVD wets my appetite to try something I see.  Second time I start the DVD I have yarn, needles and I follow along knitting what they are showing.  I pause to catch up.  Pause to answer the phone.  Some DVDs are good watching but not doing.  Tips, Essentials, guides.  Double Knitting is a do as you go..  I saw a scarf at a local yarn shop that is blue and white, one side blue with white 6"" snowflake, the other side white with 6"" blue snowflake..  they offer a class for $40. buy your yarn there, 4 weeks one lesson a week.  So I saw the Lucy Neatby DVD on double knitting for less than $40. free prime shipping Amazon.. decided having the info on DVD where I could watch, learn, watch again months later etc. a good purchase instead of the class.

I have received the DVD and watched the first chapter and I'm knitting along, totally pleased and feel accomplished.  I've sent the info along to 3 other knitters and recommended they purchase the DVD...  Also worth noting is I already had Lucy's 2 entrelac DVDs and have never gotten around to watching them.  Boy I'm excited to rekindle my interest in entrelac.  But for now I want to get back to my new DVD, double knitting.  I think double knitting is going to be the rage..  I just purchased a pattern for Extreme Double Knitting of a hat.  Good to have a DVD by Lucy that will teach me how to double knit.

I'm a 2 year knitter..  consider myself not a beginner, seem to be able to pick out patterns just above my ability ...  learn the stitch and pattern..  and now I'm thinking I'm getting to be intermediate..  Knitting is fun...  this DVD is fun...  exciting..",1341619200,10,2308,4.330210772833723
8196521,5,B000QJ3QMY,Excellent presentation of double knitting techniques.  Lucy covers both the basics and advanced topics.  The only problem with Lucy's DVDs is that there is so much information in them that I rarely watch from beginning to end.  Either I use the index to find specific information I need for a project or watch just short portions.,1266537600,18,330,4.857142857142857
