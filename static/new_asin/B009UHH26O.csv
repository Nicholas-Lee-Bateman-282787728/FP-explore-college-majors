5368897,4,B009UHH26O,"The quality of the packaging is professional, more so than I had expected or could hope for.
The quality of the DVD is good, entirely adequate. So far I've encountered only one glitch, a slight pause on disc 2, episode 1. Don't know if it was dust so I'll update if I encounter any more.
The quality of the video is great. This isn't a recording off of someone's VCR. It's grainy as expected for TV at the time and not from poor transfer.

The content is great. This was one of my all time favorite TV shows at the time and if you can get over the repetitive intro, it's a brilliant slice into technology and life as viewed in that era.

In the first episode, automan came out right off the bat with the swipe-gesture. Talking to your computer via phone lines was the norm. The show has a decent story line supported by pretty cools special effects (for its time). The stunts of the time are amazing. I need to remember that these are real people and not cgi. In the second episode, a man's leg is caught on the helicopter as it takes off, and later, falls from the helicopter into the pool below (3 feet from the edge!) This was crazy stuff compared with safety standards of today.

I'm still only on the second disc, (I can only watch one episode at time to make those 12 episodes last). But every episode sparks lively conversations about the past, where we are now and what a distant world that was not so long ago.

Word of warning, this is region 2 so get yourself an OPPO dvd player while you're at it.",1363996800,30,1509,4.265734265734266
5368898,3,B009UHH26O,"Love this series. I watched as a kid and had great memories, when I saw that it was available in DVD, I had to get it. It didn't disappoint me at all, it is still very good despite the blatant computer related mistakes, it is a great fun to watch.
However, the media is pretty bad, I couldn't watch two episodes, and I see in other reviews that others have the same problem in different episodes. Basically it looks like a very low quality DVD production. I even tried to watch on the computer where usually those reading errors are more forgiving, but no luck. Also tried on multiple blu-ray players, so it is 100% the media, not the readers.
Only giving the 3 stars because of the series itself.",1508544000,,697,4.369230769230769

5368906,3,B009UHH26O,"This short-lived Science-Fiction drama that ran on ABC for 4 months about an expertise computer programmer, unparalleled who creates a special program, ""Automan, "", an artificially intelligent computer hologram that looks real, sounds real and given enough power can physically exist in the real world. Together, Walter and Automan along with Cursor, a small floating droid that creates any object Automan needs to, battle crime on the city streets.

Unfortunately, this futuristic drama bit the dust in the Spring of 1984, due to weak ratings since AUTOMAN's 8PM  time-slot on ABC conflicted with MAGNUM's on CBS and GIMME A BREAK's on NBC every Thursday night after it's debut on ABC in the late Fall of 1983, which inclined ABC to move it to Monday nights, but then AUTOMAN's time-slot conflicted with ALL NEW BLOOPERS & PRACTICAL JOKES time-slot on NBC, and SCARECROW & MRS.

Packaging good, holds the discs individually in positions where they should not scratch each other, and not that paper sleeve garbage that guarantees scratches with use.  DVDs are single-sided.",1486598400,,452,4.8441558441558445

The effects are still cool but a bit dated and the 3 minute intro to each episode becomes tedious but once you get past that each one is a fun comic book style adventure come to life.

 I think if they didn't beat the viewer over the head with the long intro recapping Automan's origin in crazy detail after the initial opening credits it might have fared much better in the ratings when it aired. So once you see it in the first episode just skip it for the rest of the episodes and you'll love it.",1486166400,,605,4.298245614035087

To feel like a kid again with happiness while watching this show. They aren't writing anything close to this anymore and I truly miss that.

Kind of like that but in our world and not theirs.  Chuck Wagner is the computer construct and Desi Arnaz Jr. is the police tech that invents Automan in his spare time.  Like all superheroes our guy needs a weakness.  His is available power.  Not enough power or if he zaps someone, he will fade out and leave little Desi's character in trouble.

5368935,3,B009UHH26O,"BOTTOM LINE: AUTOMAN is a fun show but this release has problems. I recommend only buying it used to save yourself some money. I doubt we'll ever see this rare, 1-season TV show get another home release, so this set is probably our only option. If you really want it then just be aware that there are issues with the video portion of the transfer. 5 STARS for the show, minus 2 STARS for the troublesome picture issues.

THE STORY: Computer nerd Walter Nebicher works for the L.A. Police as a programmer in their new computer division. The old school cops (Walter's boss among them) see this new technology as a waste of time & money. After all, real cops ride in squad cars or walk a beat, they don't sit at desks tapping on keyboards! Walter longs to be one of those ""real"" cops himself, but he's stuck in front of a monitor all day. Then one evening Walter perfects a holographic program he's been developing that he calls ""Automan"" which, given enough power, can actually project itself into the real world! Automan, with the help of his little sidekick, Cursor, has an arsenal of electronic tricks up his sleeve, including a sleek sportscar, a helicopter, a stealthy plane, clothing & disguises... any number of items he might need in the fight against crime. The downside is that Automan can only operate at night when the city's power consumption is reduced. Once daybreak arrives and people begin turning on their coffee pots, microwaves, TVs, radios and other electronic devices, Auto fades away.

THOUGHTS: A cool show from the early 1980's, AUTOMAN was, at the time, on the cusp of cutting edge technology. Looking back now, it's amusing to see all the ways in which computers have slowly invaded most every aspect of our daily lives. AUTOMAN predicted this and more. Desi Arnaz Jr., makes for an engaging lead, while Chuck Wagner, as AUTOMAN, is properly heroic though amusingly clueless about many things, despite having literally every scrap of knowledge in the world at his disposal. The attitude and feel of the show is adventurous fun, and not too threatening. It's perfect for younger kids, though they will have a hard time identifying the huge bulky boxes with the clunky plug-in modems as being the same computers that they now carry in the palms of their hands. LOL. There are plenty of nifty visual effects on display; Automan himself is just a stone's throw away from Disney's TRON. (Many of the same creative personnel were behind both, so that's no surprise.) I still love the boxy but badass Lamborghini Countach that was adapted as Auto's prime method of transportation. The effects for it, while simple, are still fun to watch. And for some reason I never fail to laugh at Walter being slammed against the passenger door window whenever Auto makes a turn, as his car was programmed to respond like a video game, making 90 degree turns - an electronic maneuver which doesn't agree too well with Walter's flesh & blood body.

THE DVD SET: The good news is that we finally have this odd, one-season wonder on home video in one complete collection. The bad news is that this 4-disc set has some MAJOR pixelation issues. I don't know whether the problems lies in the low bitrate or the remastering process, courtesy of a company that calls itself Fabulous Films. Regardless, every single episode is plagued by pixelation and a maddening strobing / ghosting effect whenever characters or the camera moves quickly, which will surely tax your patience. You sort of get used to it, but it's still frustrating. If I didn't love this rare show as much as I do, I would not have bought this set. It's a safe bet that if wiser heads had prevailed, the episodes would have sported beefier bitrates and been spread across 6 discs instead of 4, which would have helped eliminate the optical troubles. Shout! Factory brought this to the U.S. but it's certainly not one of their stronger efforts. I understand that Fabulous Films is also responsible for overseeing the release of AIRWOLF and the super rare (and super-silly) MANIMAL boxsets as well. Given the lowball quality of AUTOMAN's transfer, I will regrettably be passing on both of those other releases from Fabulous Films.",1468886400,13,4192,4.779310344827586

5368954,5,B009UHH26O,"The LAPD's first computer tech is viewed with suspicion and kept in a room apart from the rest of the precinct. Since the powers that be aren't keen on computers, he's not really called on to do much work so a lot of his day is spent designed computer games. A result of his work on computer games is Automan - 'an artificially intelligent computer hologram looks, sounds reals real and, given enough power, can physically exist in the real world.'

Together, computer wiz Walter Nebicher and Automan get out of the precinct and solve crimes with the help of cursor - a small floating 3D version of a computer cursor that can create stuff (costumes, vehicles, weapons).

Desi Arnaz J.R. is Walter; Chuck Wagner is Automan. Their boss, Capt. E.G. Boyd (Gerald S. O'Loughlin) and co-workers Lt. Jack Curtis (Robert Lansing) and Roxanne Caldwell (Heather McNair) come to value Walter's skills, but Automan is kept a secret from the Captain.

Another Glen A. Larson series, Automan was a digital story - inspired by Tron and told with analog effects. Again, the show received mixed reviews but the critics that loved it really loved it - and the show's fans were as hardcore as Trekkers. Unfortunately, like Larson's Battlestar Galactica, Automan was terribly expensive for the time and even decent to great ratings simply weren't enough to keep it on the air.

Frankly, Automan holds up even better than Manimal, which hit shelves the same day (and which I also loved). The effects are amazing enough that they really look digital even now.

Bonus features include: a four-page episode guide (taglines only, so no spoilers); Calling Automan - The Auto Feature (hosted by Wagner, who really knows his stuff); The Story of Automan; Feature Story; Original Cast & Crew Bios; Collectibles Gallery; Stills Gallery.",1453334400,9,1806,4.927631578947368

The story line is about a police officer Walter  (Desi Arnaz Jr.)who did not do a great job on the street. But he was a genius with computers. His boss kept sending him back to the computer room. Where it was just him and the computer. Yes the computer  was dated. It looked like something just after the commodore  64. If you don't know what that is ask your grandfather. And before Apple 2. He created a 3d hologram Automan. To help him solve crimes. Automan could do about anything. . .  Very good story line. The picture and was better than the vhs tapes I used to record the show off tv.
The cliff hanger was where Auto man became dirty Harry. Dirty Auto. Then show was canceled.
When the box was opened everything was just loose inside box. Thought 1 of the 3 discs was missing. No it was behind information pages. The center piece that holds discs on was broken on all of them. That is why I gave it 4 stars and not 5

When I opened dvd box everything was loose in box. The center piece that holds discs in was broken. I thought it was one disc short",1451088000,4,1084,4.167464114832536

5368963,3,B009UHH26O,"Remember watching this back in the 80's and enjoying it.  Now, not so much.  The special effects, while good for the time, are repeated over and over, and some times differ in how they ""transition"".  The stories, though, are really bad.  Comparable to an episode of Scooby Doo, but with more plot holes.  Now, all these years later, it's easy to see why this show was never picked up past its mid-season replacement status.",1449964800,,423,4.662162162162162

8544433,1,B009UHH26O,"The series is undoubtedly cheesy, there's no escaping that.  But my low review is because of the quality of the DVD.  We were sitting here watching the first episode and the motion was awful and stilted, then a little blurry and pixelated.  At first I didn't think too much of it because we've been watching old episodes of Knight Rider and that sometimes happens - and then I remembered - hey, I'm not streaming this, it's a DVD!  There's no reason why the picture quality should be so messed up.  But we limped through the episode until the final five minutes the sound started cutting in and out so bad it was impossible to tell what anyone was saying.  And I can't return it, because I bought it a couple of months ago as a birthday present, so we didn't start watching it until he opened it.  Ah well.",1522108800,,806,4.369127516778524
