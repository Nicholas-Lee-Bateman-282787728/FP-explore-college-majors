3892954,4,B002B9IPIW,son requested it for Christmas; wanted to find one he hadn't seen before but Amazon's selection was limited for a decent price. the teacher edition is okay but young child can't do a lot with it,1357776000,,194,4.416666666666667
3892955,5,B002B9IPIW,My sweetheart is a science teacher in a local high school.  Her kids love this series so when I discovered they had this classroom version with teacher resources it was just a natural.  She loves them for those days when the material ran out before the session or when she needs to leave something unexpectedly for a sub (teacher know what I mean).  Keeps a couple set up with quiz copies and everything ready to go - just in case.  Great,1326931200,8,438,4.37037037037037
3892956,5,B002B9IPIW,Excellent teaching resource for science and specifically cell and DNA information. It is done in a very motivational format for 4th to 7th grade interest level and Special Education (when grade level of Video or DVD viewed is lower than their actual grade level). For all Bill Nye DVD/Videos there are either 1-2 levels teacher-written worksheets/quizzes(high school/elementary-middle school)on [...],1268352000,,400,5.796610169491525

3892959,5,B002B9IPIW,"My son loves this show and he is learning/asking more questions about the world around him because of what he learns. Bare in mind, he is 6. My nephew loved this show as well and he is 12. I wouldn't think it would keep the attention of kids older than 14. I like how they repeat definitions in a fun so the kids will remember it. Great educational series that breakdowns the basics for kids.",1416096000,,392,4.24

3892963,5,B002B9IPIW,This video was used to give and overview of the cell unit and gave clear information to my students in 7th grade science,1393632000,,120,4.260869565217392
3892964,3,B002B9IPIW,"I had hoped there was more depth to this video, but I think it could be used as an into to cell biology. I also was a little disappointed that several of the extras were just clips of the video itself. The scene seletor was a bit convoluted. I watched the video, then had to go back through the scene path to figure out how to select what I wanted to emphasize. I loved the interactive glossary. Way cool.",1376956800,,405,4.139240506329114
3892965,2,B002B9IPIW,"It is all in the presentation.  It is Disney entertainment instead of more indepth science.  This would be alright for introducing a term to an elementary school class.  It has no depth of topic.  For the prices these videos sell for, there should be more science involved, more explanation...",1369353600,8,293,4.918367346938775
3892966,5,B002B9IPIW,I can't say enough about these great videos! Bill Nye IS the science guy. My fifth graders love to watch these. A supplemental notes as the movie plays is even more powerful.,1369008000,,174,4.46875

8360900,1,B002B9IPIW,"NEVER BUY!!!  WASTE OF MONEY Poor Quality DVD's. I bought at least 30 Bill Nye DVD's from Amazon. Each have been watched only 1 or 2 times. I played each DVD after purchasing and only one was bad. Amazon promptly replaced that DVD. Now many are not working. I love the Bill Nye science movies but unless you are OK with watching only one or two times before they don't work, don't buy. The DVD's have always been kept in a file cabinet in an air conditioned room. No children have ever touched the DVD's. I put the DVD's in the player for them. It is not the DVD player since all my DVD's play except Bill Nye. I am in the process of viewing every one and making a list of each one that does not work. I have spent hundreds of dollars. I will be putting a complaint into Amazon after I check all of the DVD's to see which still works. BUYER BEWARE. I DO NOT KNOW WHY THE DVD'S JUST STOP WORKING - NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH ANY OTHER DVD'S.",1454457600,,938,4.07027027027027
