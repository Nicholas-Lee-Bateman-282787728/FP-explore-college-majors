8729957,2,B0146TSQ5Q,"Very disappointing.
Pro:
-- Scenes are single views of a location without camera panning or zooming in or out. Steady recording is useful for projecting onto a wall for room ambience.
Cons:
-- The locations given are odd choices, even at times unattractive (although I realize this is subject to opinion).
-- There are humans in several scenes. Although they appear in the distance, this robs you of the sensation of enjoying nature in solitude.
-- The scene of the moss-covered wooded area (a swamp?) has so little movement of fauna or flora, you'd swear it was a still photograph.
-- Each scene contains a subtitle revealing where the scene was recorded. This cannot be turned off, so it appears with every repeat of each chapter. This should have been an optional feature. By the way, while the locations are in Australia and New Zealand, none of them reveal the unique beauty or locations of those countries. The scenes could just as well have been shot in North America, since the foliage seems very similar.
-- The chapters are very short, so if you use your DVD player to loop a certain chapter, the loop becomes quickly obvious (again, especially since the name of the location pops up at the same place).
-- The resolution is very low, even for DVD. It's just barely above VHS, if that.

I have many ambient DVDs.  But unfortunately this one is not a keeper.  :^(",1517356800,,1372,4.661157024793388
