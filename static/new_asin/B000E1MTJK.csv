8103895,2,B000E1MTJK,"The film is basically footage of ""Dr Christina"" walking around Paris with three sex scenes shot in California spliced in. No sync-sound; just a female narrator and some jazz music endlessly repeated. Thankfully, the Uschi Digart footage seens new(and not lifted from Roxanna or Pleasures Of A Woman,as I thought might be the case) Two other women who MAY be Jane Sentas and Donna Young appear as well. No trailers are included, despite the claim on the package. The 2nd feature? An ultra-cheap hardcore short with no recognizable faces. But hey, it had actual sound!",1142553600,22,566,4.968421052631579
