8132465,3,B000GI3RYM,Appreciated Walk to Remember but the other two movies were assigned to the garbage because of offensive language. A package of DVDs should be of equal language rating as well as moral rating when they come together. Acting wasn't  equal quality.,1397606400,,245,4.975609756097561

8132470,5,B000GI3RYM,"I cant believe that I still cry when I watch these movies.... I love this box set. YAYA is a fun movie with the tear jerking when we find out about Sidalees mothers first love. A WALK TO REMEMBER is definately a great movie. That is definately a tear jerker. Message IN A BOTTLE is also good. I must admit that I had not seen it before I bought this set and I cried... thank goodness I can watch these at home ... lol
My husband and I liked this set so much that he got a set for his mother...",1311552000,,493,3.891089108910891
