8257629,5,B00156PAFS,"It's not easy being a Takakura Ken fan who doesn't speak Japanese - apart from his few US pictures (The Yakuza, Too Late the Hero, Black Rain, Mr Baseball) most of his films are only available in unsubtitled Japanese. Even this multiple award winner from 1998 is only available in China, which is a pity as it's a beautiful mood piece. Osato has spent his life working for the railroad, first as an engineer and now as a stationmaster in a dying boomtown at the end of a branch line that runs only now-empty trains that were once, long ago state of the art, passionately believing that the railroad holds the key to rebuilding Japan after the war. Faced with impending retirement and both the closure of the line and the death of the town, he finds himself reflecting on a life where he has put his duty to the railroad before his family at every turn - even the death of his wife and child could not take him away from the station. Much loved and respected by his co-workers, he refuses to plan for a future but looks back to the past.

Not much in the way of plot, it's true, but it's a beautiful character piece about changing times, obsolete people and missed chances, and acted with beautiful restraint (although I could have done with less of the admittedly beautiful score, which is used too frequently in some of the quieter dramatic scenes that are effective enough to not need underscoring). Set in remote snowbound backwaters, it's frequently beautiful to look at, with a warm colour scheme for the modern day sequences alternating with muted tones for the flashbacks.

Some Japanese friends have complained that the film offers a right wing agenda hearkening back to the blind obedience of the bad old days, but the film's got a more complicated view than that. Osato realises that the town will disappear as if it - and he - had never been there and is clearly in denial. Even the one positive result of his life's work, ensuring that the town's children were able to go to school elsewhere to find opportunities outside the town (relayed in a moving phone call), is difficult for him to accept, so he hides behind duty and regulations. The resolution that takes the movie into a different, more Dickensian genre can be seen coming a mile off, but it's still remarkably affecting, as indeed is the entire film - if you do get the chance to see this one, bring a box of hankies: a big box. Quietly simply wonderful.",1232236800,9,2427,4.551487414187643
