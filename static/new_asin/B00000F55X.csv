1202401,5,B00000F55X,"It only took a decade.  My Brilliant Career is FINALLY on DVD!!!  It is a quiet tour de force of good acting, beautiful art direction and cinematography, a wonderful story about a writer coming out of girlish egotism to join a larger world and form a vision, and an intriguing picture of Victorian Australia among the immigrant society.  Judy Davis is sparkle and tang playing the volatile Sybilla, very molten as she fires, cools and then erupts like any young adult.  Sam Neill, aside from being very effective eyedrops that reminds you of Gary Cooper or Alan Bates, swaggers and holds fast as her suitor, being a willing foil to unpredictability.  There are accomplished supporting performances that paint her story with pathos, a lot of humor with the steady understanding of the importance of family love.  In the spirit of a time when passions were to be restrained and redirected into more interesting pursuits, My Brilliant Career stays in character in this modern visual medium by presenting passion in the guise of mischievous boat rides and a pillow fight for the ages.  You'll feel the panic of dust blowing mercilessly through the windows, parental anxiety, teenage anxiety, affection in the muddiest and wealthier places, and the frustration of love.  It is edifying enough to glimpse into that time as a history or anthropology lesson, or you can just sit back and let it entertain.

I first saw this movie on double bill following Night of the Shooting Stars (by the Taviani brothers) at a movie theater in Washington, D.C.  It was like eating really good lasagna with a really good apple pie.  You have to really focus on each film and not think about them together.  A better partner to My Brilliant Career would be Pricilla, Queen of the Desert, Man from Snowy River, or Lantana.  You could also have a Judy Davis film festival by watching it with Husbands and Wives, Impromptu, or that film she did about Judy Garland.  For a Sam Neill film fest, watch the Reilly Ace of Spies series, The Piano, Plenty, or Cry in the Dark.  Or, you can watch it by itself, like a piece of really good apple pie.",1087776000,36,2115,4.724795640326976

1202479,4,B00000F55X,"When I first watched this film in my teens, I thought Sybylla was the most awesome character ever, even a role model, especially for the time and location depicted - fiery, independent, modern.  Someone who didn't want to be pigeon-holed and would bravely pursue her own way on her own terms.  So I recently purchased the blu-ray based upon these fond memories and what do I think now?

Well, Sybylla was not as likable.  Her behavior and methods didn't seem as high-minded as I had thought when I was younger.  Sybylla was still a sympathetic character, either to be trapped in the boondocks with little chance to break out of the rut of never-ending farm life, or be expected to make a good marriage.  No other 'acceptable-for-a-woman' choices were available.  Sybylla was a non-conformist, even a radical for the times, which was admirable.  She admits to her egotistical nature from the jump.  However, in my latest viewing her selfishness seemed more pronounced and damaging to even the most well-meaning of her circle.  I felt a wee bit more sympathy for her mother exasperated by a daughter who seemed to prefer to sit and dream of artistic greatness - in what field she didn't know really, although she did demonstrate talent - rather than help about the house. I thought her suitors (even the one who was a confirmed a$$) could be forgiven for believing their efforts were welcome.  One opinion didn't change - her choice in the end was the best one and made for the most authentic ending.  Oh, and the pillow fight was still hot.

Sybylla remains interesting, and watching her slow maturation was better appreciated this time around.  The performances by all of the actors, the direction, and the blu-ray quality are fine.",1388620800,4,1732,4.8074324324324325

1202520,4,B00000F55X,"This movie takes us to the Outback in the late 1880's and beyond.  Based on the actual life experiences of Miles Franklin, this is an adaptation of her autobiography.  In the story, her character is called Sybylla Melvyn.

Sybylla is a rather plain, young woman with few options available to her but to marry.  Her outspoken and lively behavior makes her less than a prime candidate to marry a man of stature in the Victorian Era.  Having grown-up living on a lonely farm with few pleasures and few friends, her parents are rather poor farmers.  When her family makes arrangements for her to marry she refuses.  Due to her being ""past"" her prime (late teens?), she is sent away to live with her wealthy grandmother because her family can't maintain her basic needs (and she needs a stronger disciplinary force to make her presentable to ""society"").  Her desire to become a writer is strongly discouraged to the point that she might have well said she wanted to be a servant or worse.  Women were made to marry and have babies!

Though she is considered unattractive, the man she rejected continues his pursuit (more out of outrage at her refusal?), meanwhile, she meets a handsome, successful man, whom all the women in the region lust.  Her playful, carefree nature makes her unique and piquant. They seek the each others' company.  Business takes him to other regions for a long while; then her parent's indenture her for a two year period working as a governess to the family from the backside of Hades educating seven (7) unruly, dirty and undisciplined young children.  As she copes and observes, her future becomes so much clearer to her.  Though these absences and other circumstances create confusion between the two and fear of love lost; eventually, they discover that their feelings remain.  When he proposes, things don't end as expected.

The acting was superb and the storyline interesting.  The script was real and the dialogue honest.  There were more than a few chuckles along the way and it was inspirational particularly for the era.

How refreshing to have a story sans blood, violence, perversion and lewd sex scenes.  This film demonstrates that a truly good story doesn't need such ""additions"" to keep an audience entertained.",1387843200,,2249,4.883905013192612
1202521,5,B00000F55X,"First off, Hollywood; it is Sybylla NOT Sybilla - you folks are too arrogant and don't know squat!  For someone who really didn't want the role and didn't like her performance, Judy Davis does an incredible job; she is totally natural and MOST believable.  She portrays a young girl who has her own mind and is NOT going to be swayed by 1897 British (her Grandmother) mores - she is a girl ahead of her time.  Sybylla has a LOT of spunk and is not the least bit afraid to show it.  She is a very likable character and played to the hilt by Judy Davis.  My Bride and I have seen a good number of Australian movies and we have the highest regard for our 'Down Under' cousins; Hollywood has MUCH to learn from them - not all of the sex, violence, blow up things, and swearing!!!  These settings are REAL!  We highly recommend the movie.  The entire movie is very believable! The setting for this (1897 - 1900) is some very beautiful countryside in New South Wales, both near Canberra and further west (~415 km) near Hay.  Enjoy!!

at your own risk!

A lovely, beautifully acted first feature that launched both Judy
Davis, who is amazing in this, and director Gillian Armstrong.

Its lost a little something revisiting it after all these years. While
it's feminist ideals are inspiring and handled with complexity, there's
a certain lack of emotion to it. We don't really get the complex, deep
bitter-sweetness of choosing loneliness over loss of self.

Also, that the film forces that choice at all seems a bit disingenuous.
Nothing about Sam Neil's character suggests he would repress our
heroine - indeed he clearly loves her for the free spirit she is. To
really have her need to make an either/or decision 'work' we'd need to
go further into their relationship and her psychology.

Last, a number of the supporting roles tend towards clichs about both
the upper and lower class. And that oversimplifying takes something
away from the complex character Davis builds.

But all that said, there are beautiful images and magical moments. It
just didn't quite hold up to my memories of first seeing it 30 years
ago. But if you've never seen it, you still certainly should.",1302480000,,1204,4.9405940594059405
1202526,5,B00000F55X,"An Australian film with a young Judy Davis and a young Sam Neil. Both went on to  ""Brilliant Careers"" themselves.

I give ""My Brilliant Career"" 1 star because it was based on a real book written by a teenager for the amusement of her friends. On the screen the young woman comes off as an ambitionless, vulgar, egotistical dreamer. There is no heroine here, no endearing soul to root for or identify with. It's a terrible adaption.

1202528,3,B00000F55X,"Hmmm. I am not sure what I want to say about this film. I am not sure that I knew what I was getting ready to watch when I read the description and I am a bit torn over the heroine's decisions. Sybylla (Judy Davis) is hoydenish, wild, independent and free spirited in a time where the ideal woman was the complete opposite. And yet she is able to get wealthy, mannered men to fall in love with her. She grew up poor on a small farm in the Australian outback, but she had huge dreams of creating a brilliant career. With a father who spent more time drunk than sober and large family, Sybylla's mother was forced to break the news to her eldest daughter that they could not longer afford to feed her and that she needed to start working. As a servant. Sybylla is horrified and refuses to work as a servant, but has few options open to her. Then her grandmother miraculously offers to have Sybylla stay with her so that she has the opportunity to make a good match and secure a future for herself. Her grandmother is quite wealthy and has the reputation and the means to find Sybylla a good husband, but, of course, Sybylla is having nothing of it. Sybylla takes polish well and it was fun to see her transformation, but I could clearly see forks in the road of her life and I am not sure that she always took the right one.

I rarely discuss the endings of movies I watch as I don't don't want to spoil the end of the movie for you if you don't want to know, but I am going to discuss it this time. Fair warning, stop reading now if you don't want to know. Still with me? Okay, here we go. I am in my early 30s and work full time and provide for myself. I have a career, not an illustrious career, not even a particularly well-paying career, but I am independent and provide for myself. I have never had a serious relationship and never had to decide whether to accept a marriage proposal so I am not sure what I would have done. I do feel that this character, Sybylla, made a wrong choice. She turned down 2 marriage proposals -- 1 that was a joke, really -- but 1 was serious and he did believe that he loved Sybylla. And Sybylla led him on. There is just no other way to put it. She asked Harry (Sam Neill) to wait for her for 2 years to give her a chance to live and when he returns for her, she feeds him some lame line about how they would make each other miserable and she has to write and so she has to make it on her own. Okay, so how are you making it on your own when you still live in your parents' home? Can you not be married to a wealthy man and continue your writing? Is this beneath you? I get frustrated with characters like hers, which is based on a true story because she thinks she is getting what she wants, but I don't think she knows. I think she will have regrets and it will be too late to do anything about it. And why do men always fall for women like this? I guess I just don't get it.

I enjoyed this film for the historical feel, the beautiful costumes, the old-time manners in police society, the tough farm women who battled against the wilderness everyday and I particularly enjoyed the music and the scenery. The music ranges from beautiful orchestral arrangements to Australian ditties that would have been sung in bars and shanties -- songs women in polite society shouldn't know. And I always find Australian scenery beautiful. It is so varied and visually stunning that it makes the movie worth watching for the vistas alone. The movie is also well acted and thoughtfully presented.

If you are a looking for a historical film that branches out from the typical British romances, give this one a try. Brace yourself for a few twists and turns along the way as Sybylla is anything but a typical romance heroine, but it is a refreshing change from more by-the-book formulaic period romance pieces.",1274745600,4,3833,4.262362637362638
1202586,5,B00000F55X,"This isn't my review, it's from NPR.  But it's right on the mark.  I saw this movie when it first came out and thought it was brilliant.

""This year is the 30th anniversary of My Brilliant Craeer's release. And after watching the gorgeous new version on Blu-ray, I can confidently say that this tale of a young woman's self-creation seems even better now than it did in 1979, not least because our current movies have virtually no interest in women.

My Brilliant Career is based on a 1901 novel by a teenage girl who wrote under the name of Miles Franklin. The time is the late 19th Century, the place rural New South Wales, and the heroine Sybylla Melvyn, a willfully, conflictedly headstrong young woman thrillingly played by Judy Davis. A born romantic, Sybylla dreams of being a writer. But everything is against it -- her family's poverty, her need to work as a servant, provincial society's hostility to her seemingly ""unwomanly"" ways.

Then she meets a wealthy landowner named Harry Beecham. That's a young Sam Neil -- who's never been so wolfishly charming. The two fall in love. But nothing is ever simple with Sybylla, and even as she leads Harry on, she also fends him off, actually slapping him with a riding crop the night he proposes marriage.

When My Brilliant Career first came out in the U.S., it deservedly became a hit. Still, many critics wrote it off as merely another of the feminist fantasies common in the nineteen seventies.

It is that, but it's also something more. You see, most of the women's empowerment films of that era centered on women who were dumping a creep of a husband, sometimes swapping that creep for a sensitive artist. Here, it's Sybylla who wants to be the artist, and what makes it tricky is that she loves a food who loves her precisely for her imagination and independence. The question is, can she have this love and achieve the brilliant writing career that she sees as her true destiny?

As it happens, My Brilliant Career was itself destined to become a cultural watershed, one whose effects we can feel when we go to the movies or turn on our TVs. In fact, 30 years on, we're currently living in an era that will be remembered for being dominated by great Australian actresses. There are the ubiquitous stars like Cate Blanchett, Nicole Kidman and Naomi Watts, who gave this decade's most brilliant performance in Mulholland Drive. There are the superb character actors like Toni Collette and Rachel Griffiths. And then there are the terrific up-and-comers like Mia Wasikowska, who stole the first season of In Treatment, and Abbie Cornish from the recent Bright Star.

Now, I know that there are strong American actresses, too. I'm well aware that Meryl Streep is a powerhouse and that Sandra Bullock and Kate Hudson keep churning out hits. Still, it's modern Hollywood's shameful failing that it trains homegrown actresses to be likable -- you know, not bitchy. Of course, that usually means being bland, girlish, uncomplicated, and totally nonthreatening. That's why, when American filmmakers have a nice, complex role, they tend to cast an Aussie actress.

And who can blame them? Australian actresses are smart, tough, moody, and not cookie-cutter beautiful -- their good looks are born of intelligence and style. Better still, even their biggest stars are utterly fearless. They let themselves look plain. They don't demand star vehicles. And they're willing to play characters the audience actively dislikes.

No doubt there are profound cultural reasons for all this, but there's also one straightforward explanation. Whenever I ask Aussie actresses who's inspired them, they always say the same thing: Judy Davis. It was Davis whose bravery, incandescence, and occasional cussedness set the template for what it means to be an Australian screen actress. She's the lodestar, the yardstick, and to this day, one of the world's great talents.

In fact, if you want to know why this is the Golden Age of Australian Actresses, you should start by watching Judy Davis play Sybylla Melvyn. She's the Godmother of all those brilliant careers.""",1260057600,9,4099,4.92463768115942
1202587,1,B00000F55X,Only reason I bought this film was for a college class as 99.99% of the dialogue was so hard to understand in class I needed this to try to write a paper on the film.

1202588,2,B00000F55X,"I agree with the other two ""contrarian reviews.""  The one by A. Heifez says everything I would want to.  I only add my comments here, to give prospective buyers a full range of opinions since there are so many raves.

I watched this film for about forty-five minutes and like the other ""contrarian"" I really tried to like it.  From the get-go, the message was broadcast loud and clear---that the heroine was not about to settle for the type of life that was being offered to her.  She was different, spunky, full of life and energy and blessed with a full head of thick red hair and freckles to match. And she wants to be an Artist.  (Think ""Jo"" of Little Women, but Aussie stlye---a bit more rustic.)

She is initially saved from a life of servitude by the generous offer of her very wealthy grandmother, who rescues her from the outback and brings her to the city her to live in her magnificent home with her family.  They freshen her up, give her beautiful clothes and introduce her to suitors who will give her a life of ease and luxury.  Sybilla turns up her nose at all of that, clinging to her dream of being an Artist. She hasn't decided yet what field of art she will pursue yet...music? writing? perhaps the theater?  This shows the level of realism where she lives.  A real artist would have been actively practicing her art form by the time she is S's age.  She does know one piece on the piano which she plays repeatedly with a dogged enthusiam if not with much talent.

What Sybilla is very good at, though, is scorning everyone she feels is her inferior and that includes most everyone.  I could certainly sympathize with her objection to being married off to someone she doesn't love, but she does love one of the men, who is charming and sweet as well as well-off.  Judy Davis, whose performance I loved in Passage to India, was appropriately spunky here but the amount of smug smirking really turned me off. I think it would be possible to show energy and an independent spirit without being so snotty.  We're supposed to be rooting for this character but I found nothing to endear her to me.  After a while I really didn't care what happened to this ungrateful girl and I turned it off.

Maybe it got better as S. met the bumps of life and matured.  I'll never know.",1250208000,12,2285,4.436450839328537

1202595,4,B00000F55X,"In early twentieth century Australia a young woman, Sybylla Melvyn, played by the ever-capable Judy Davis, is determined to escape the mundane domestic existence she sees laid out before her, in order to seek her fortune, her ""brilliant career"" as a writer. She passes up a sound offer of marriage to a smitten, wealthy young man, played by none other than Sam Neill, and as a consequence makes due with residing in reduced circumstances as a governess: itself hardly the fulfillment of her egoistical dream. The statement here is more than just one of ideals before romance, it also says much about the reality of the limited choices open to women even as late as the nascence of the 1900's, and the at least short-term fate Sybylla (a stand-in for real life writer Miles Franklin) meets as a result of her choice was nicely depicted by director Gillian Armstrong. The sad fact was that when a woman in times past strayed from those narrow roles society dictated as available to her (wife and mother being by far the most obvious and approved one) she was seldom rewarded. Sure Sybylla is allowed to choose her path for herself and perhaps reaped some feeling of empowerment from that, but My Brilliant Career makes it plainly apparent what the probable outcome is to be. Undoubtedly things could be better for women (and everyone else) than they are today, but dare I point out that we've come a long way...""baby?""",1172620800,6,1416,4.760162601626016
1202654,5,B00000F55X,"I will not attempt to repeat the complimnts of other viewers. I will say only that MY BRILLIANT CAREER is a beautifully written and photographed tale of a vivacious, independent young woman (Judy Davis) and the unrequited love of her suitor (Sam Neill). The characters are unforgettable and the love story complex. As a period piece, the film comes alive. New South Wales and other sites emerge through meticulous art direction, wonderful costumes and delicious cinematography.

While the score hangs its hat on a single melody from Robert Schumann's ""Scenes of Childhood,"" the salon performances are captivating and the dance sequences lively and colorful.

But this is Judy Davis's film by far. Her performance is funny, fiery and nuanced. She is also a natural beauty who speaks as clearly with her body and eyes as with her words.  She conveys the stubbornness with which many writers pursue their work, forsaking everything for the freedom and space they need to create.

The extras here are generous, with the most valuable feature in this two-disk set ""The Miles Franklin Story""-- on which the film is ultimately based.

I am grateful this film is accessible again, beauifully remastered in high definition, with a crisp, clear soundtrack. The packaging is also exemplary.

MY BRILLIANT CAREER has been on my top-20 list for a quarte- century, and it still holds its place. A captivating, funny and deeply moving film with a first performance by a young actress that has no equal.",1159488000,12,1487,5.024390243902439
1202655,5,B00000F55X,"I guess as a married woman, I feel saddened that some women felt that to marry was confining or otherwise restrictive to their freedoms as women.  This movie was wonderful - great, sweeping romance, but sad.  The scene where the star breaks off the relationship and rejects the marriage proposal from the Sam Neill character is heart breaking.  It reflects Miles Franklins' decision not to marry, but instead to pursue her career as a writer and travel the world.  Despite its sadness, this is probably one of the most romantic movies I have ever watched.

This movie reminds me of how much progress women have made - we no longer feel that we have to choose between romance and our careers.  We can have it all!",1152057600,9,712,4.611111111111111
1202656,3,B00000F55X,"The movie is exquisitely styled, well-paced, filled with interesting characters and beautiful scenery.  The story is unsettling and problematic though.  In fairy tales or classic British novels, such as those by Jane Austen, a girl dreams of meeting and marrying her prince and finally does just that.  In this movie, Sybilla does meet her prince who falls in love with her, but she turns down ordinary human happiness to lead the life of an artist, whatever that may mean in her case.  She also turns down someone's true love - most people, unfortunately, can only wish they could find it and end up settling for a lot less.  I never actually read the book but, from watching a movie, I never got a sense that there was anything remotely brilliant about her career, or that she had talent that showed any promise.  Her personality is fun but not exactly appealing.  She is full of vitality yet excessively self-centered and, as she herself admits, egotistical.  She seems to have little or no consideration for others.  Harry Beacham, on the other hand, is very sympathetic.  He is an arrogant young man but that is expected of him - he is a prince-like figure.  He is still very likeable - aristocratic yet surprisingly understanding, given his sheltered existence, strong yet vulnerable.  He must have fallen for her because she was different from other girls he met.  She seems to have some feelings for him too, but she is too self-centered and preoccupied by self-introspection to actually love someone else.  In the end, she tells him that she ""almost"" loves him, or something like that, and that what she is really after is finding out who she is and what is wrong with the world.  Yeah, right.  I was somewhat like Sybilla when I was young (though I had a lot more concern and appreciation for people and things) and it took me many years to learn what is of true value in life.  The most profound and best line in the movie is ""loneliness is a high price to pay for independence"".  In the end, I felt sorry for Sybilla.  The decision not to marry Harry Beacham was something that she would probably regret later, as years would pass.  I could almost imagine Sybilla eventually turning into a lonely and bitter old hag, finding her only comfort in grumbling about everyone else being smug, stupid, bourgeois and conformist.",1133827200,34,2332,4.711111111111111
1202657,5,B00000F55X,"Gillian Armstrong and Judy Davis (as the autobiographer, Sybilla Melvyn in the film, a woman named Miles Franklin in real life) made their stunning entrances into directing and acting stardom in this little gem of a film, stunningly photographed in the Outback of Australia by Donald McAlpine (whose genius would 20 yrs. later, be married to another Australian's genius, Baz Luhrmann, to bring us both ""Romeo + Juliet"" and the extraordinary ""Moulin Rouge""), and who here brought the stark beauty of the Bush to life in glorious tones of gold and rust. This was later contrasted with the unexpectedly green, white-linen-ed, lush environment of Sybilla's grandmother's home, where she meets up with the quickly love-struck Harry Beecham (Sam Neill). Utterly charmed by her wit, energy, freedom of spirit, he is quickly bowled over by how different this untamed woman of the Outback is from his genteel friends, all of whom seem to have moved to Australia in order to transform it into England, and themselves into a sort of less costly version of the ""aristocracy."" He's unprepared for a woman whose early morning greeting consists of a pillow thrown out of a window onto his head, leading to an all-out pillow fight, when most of the young eligible women he knows are too busy learning to sip tea properly to even have the time, let alone the inclination, to chase him into a nearby meadow with a pillow as a weapon. Rolling around in the grass isn't what young ladies do at the turn of the century, even in only relatively civilized Australia, and this rollicking scene sums up both the reasons they get on so well and are so very imcompatible. For Sybilla, her playfulness is that of a free, fun-loving tomboy, while for him, it's more a form of courtship foreplay. He wants to marry her, and spends the whole movie waiting to hear the one word, ""Yes.""

But Sybilla is not to be pinned down. She feels a sense of her own destiny, and giving that over to a marriage before she's 20 is not even conceivable for her. She wants to write, and her passion to do so is motivated by the deep compassion and despair she feels for the strong, beautiful, loving and prickly but lovable people of her harsh country, whom she sees as wasting their lives in an endless toil of day-to-day labor that she finds both noble and pointless. Her mother's early fade to old age, in stark contrast to her sister, who, having stayed behind with their mother, is still gorgeous and healthy, much to Sybilla's surprise (the difference between the two is emphasized by some cross-cutting). We see how life as a farmer's wife in the harsh Outback, working round the clock, having (and burying) baby after baby, has stretched her mother to a thin, exhausted shell of her former self. This grieves Sybilla, though she also is filled with admiration for her. It's this duality of experience that is at the heart of the story.

Sybilla's grandmother, elegantly played by Aileen Britton, is a gentle woman with a steel backbone, who has, in her own way, survived a challenging life despite the appearance of ease. She and her (other) daughter Helen, set out to transform Sybilla from wildcat to elegant young woman, combing out a mane of hair we would not see again until a few years later when Helena Bonham Carter showed up in ""A Room with a View,"" giving her facials, teaching her to walk and talk like a lady, and trying (mostly in vain) to make this transformation more than skin deep.

As much as Sybilla enjoys the experiences of her new life, she doesn't lose any of the strength with which she was born and which was nurtured on the farm, and when she goes back to her family home she is as much at ease pulling a stuck cow out of the mud as she was in her grandmother's drawing room. Harry finds her here, watching in bewildered admiration from a distance in his perfect clothes and coiffed hair, and again their differences are underscored. It is nearly impossible to see them together, as one can't help but feel that to entirely give up this life would diminish her, yet neither do we want her to live alone and unloved. We are as conflicted as she is.

After a long time in the idyllic home of her grandmother, and after asking for and receiving Harry's promise that he'll give her two years to figure out what she wants and who she is before marrying him, Sybilla is forced to leave in order to work as a governess to pay off her father's debt. She is at first discouraged and resentful (particularly as the family lives in filth and ignorance, yet represent a greater economic health than her own fathers's), then falls in love with the family and gives them everything she has. There's a wonderful scene where she reads to them a story, printed on the newspaper the family has papered the walls with (to keep out the nighttime cold); she runs from paper to paper in search of the next chapter, the whole family mesmerized by her energetic and theatrical reading of the story. There is a wonderful irony in this section, which I will not give away here, but she is sent home, and it's this which leads to her to her return to her father's farm, where Harry finds her, and asks her to marry him. But Sybilla still can't promise--she has decided to become a writer, and begs for Harry's understanding. It's a heartbreaking scene between a strong woman, capable of great love yet unable to yet give up her independence, and a warm, good man who neither wants to compromise the woman he loves, nor his own love for her.

Throughout her adventures, she never loses sight of her goal, and by the end, her pencil-written, painstakingly produced manuscript (several inches high), is mailed off to a London publisher.

Franklin's book was published, and though it was out of print for a long time, I was lucky enough to find a 2nd hand one in a used book store. But perhaps the release of the film onto DVD will stimulate a new printing of the book, too. I recommend it as well. Her writing is down-to-earth and compelling, and clearly fulfilled her goal--she brings to life the people of her country vividly and with great respect and admiration. Both Armstrong and Davis seem to understand and respect how deeply the character of Sybilla lives, and work hard to bring her fully to life. So successful are they that poor Harry Beecham seems really too anemic for her--she lives so deeply that Harry's sheltered life has not grown him up to be as strong and complex as she is. This connundrum haunts her throughout the story.

""My Brilliant Career"" was the first film I saw when I moved to Berkeley in 1980 to become a filmmaker, and it was certainly an inspiration. To be able to bring such characters to life and, more importantly to the screen, gave me hope that the art of cinema was still alive and well, despite the massive changes brought about in this country by the new ""blockbuster"" phenomenon. It was a small film, seen by lovers of cinema first, then, after word of mouth, by everyone, including the Academy, who nominated it. Of course, it had won many Australian and European awards already.

This little film launched three important careers, Judy Davis', Gillian Armstrong's, and Sam Neill's. For these careers, all brilliant, we should be grateful. That it's also a great work of cinematic art is a fabulous bonus, that now everyone will get to appreciate. It was a long wait, but worth it.",1125360000,81,7382,4.629770992366412

1202660,5,B00000F55X,"This is really a treasure of a film.  It is definitely one of the best depictions of a young woman who breaks away from the norm to follow her own calling life.  The young woman who does this is Sybylla Melvyn (Judy Davis), a headstrong, self-possessed young Australian woman from the Bush, whose parents no longer have money to keep her and send her to live with her grandmother.  Sybylla, who comes from little money, previous charm school training or ""traditional refinement"" in her home is in for a culture shock when she meets her grandmother and aunt, who are both refined and quite traditional in their beliefs about what proper women ought to do.  Proper women should marry, abandon thoughts of independent living, and must remain at the beck and call of their husbands.  This is not the life Sybylla imagines for herself.  She is actually an outspoken, self-directed writer, with more than a glimmer of spunk and mischief in her eyes.  Sybylla also knows she isn't ""conventionally beautiful.""  This doesn't stop two suitors from trying their luck with the spunky young woman.  The first is Frank Hawdon (Robert Grubb), an upper-class, uptight and arrogant man who works for her grandmother and picks her up at the train station.  Sybylla lets him know in no uncertain terms that she doesn't return his affections.  The second suitor is Harry Beecham (Sam Neill), a young man who starts out as ""mates"" with her, participates in a good-natured pillow fight with ""Syb"" and ends up with feelings for her that run deeper than friendship.

This is an excellent period piece, set around circa 1900 in Australia, at a time where the opinion of women and their place in society was undergoing serious ruptures and transitions.  Sybylla is a product and example of that rapture, and is truly an inspiration for any young woman who challenges convention.  Judy Davis is masterful in her role and the supporting cast is equally engaging.  Well done!",1099958400,11,1946,4.8545454545454545
1202661,5,B00000F55X,"I spent a packet of money buying my own copy of this in VHS. (Where is the DVD?  Hello??)  I love this film.  Judy Davis is sublime as Sybille, a young woman from the Australian outback who finds herself out of place in her grandmother's high society of 1900, and dreaming beyond her means to become a writer.  The film dramatizes the choices women had to make at that point in history given their restricted circumstances, but with humor and grace and refreshingly little didacticism.  The visuals are beautiful, it's a period film that is more than just great costume design, and the Schumann piano soundtrack will never leave me.

I love Davis's pig-headed selfishness of youth, her capricious but unmalicious temper.  This is also my favorite Sam Neill role--he strikes the absolutely right balance between devil-may-care romancer, masculine pride, and soft-heartedness, which makes their romance wholly plausible, realistic, and poignant.  Two world-class performances.

If I were to invoke a stereotype, I'd say this film generally appeals to women of a feminist bent with its focus on the conflict between love and ambition.  But naturally I think everyone should see it.",1097798400,6,1178,5.12041884816754
1202662,5,B00000F55X,"What's to say about ""My Brilliant Career"" that hasn't been said already? A superb first effort for then up and coming actors Judy Davis, Sam Neill, and director Gillian Armstrong. Those 3 are truly living up to the title of the film.

In answer to the previous reviewers here on Amazon.com, true that the film isn't available on DVD or new VHS for that matter in the USA. I heard there was a problem with who had the rights to the film in the last 10 years. Supposedly, some Panamanian company acquired the rights inadvertantly with a package of forgettable Aussie films. Margaret Fink, the producer, said she nearly dropped dead when she heard this. Fortunately, Fink and Australia reacquired ""My Brilliant Career"" in the last couple of years through legal means. That's why ""My Brilliant Career"" has already been released on new DVDs in the UK and Australia. I bought the Australian DVD because of the widescreen presentation and DVD extras that it has which include a great commentary by Gillian Armstrong as well as short interviews with producer Margaret Fink, Gillian Armstrong, film footage from Canne with Fink, Davis, and Armstrong, and more. It cost me about $23 (includes shipping from Australia) for a brand new DVD which is a bargain compared to how much used tapes go for on ebay. The UK version is cheaper but has no xtras I think. These region coded 2 or 4 DVDs will not play on a typical DVD player sold in the USA, but you can easily find certain DVD players sold at Bestbuy, Target, computer stores, etc... that can be made multi-region (region free) so they can play any DVD in the world. I bought myself one particular brand/model for $50. If you don't want to buy a region free player, you can also play foreign DVDs on your computer DVD-ROM drive easily.

Hopefully, one day ""My Brilliant Career"" will be released in the USA in glorious DVD. The film has been broadcast on cable channels in the USA in the past year. Which could be a sign it will end up on DVD here eventually. Perhaps similar to how ""Impromptu"" appeared on cable, then a year later it was released on DVD.

7906841,5,B00000F55X,"I was disappointed by Gillian Armstrong's movie ""Charlotte Gray,"" a romantic thriller that never quite lived up to its promise, despite a strong cast.  Her breakthrough movie from1979, ""My Brilliant Career"" is much better, for it manages to avoid both romantic and feminist cliches and has at its center a superb performance by the young Judy Davis, in what was her breakthrough as well.  It might be Armstrong's strongest film, just as ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" might be the strongest film of another Australian director, Peter Weir.  Part of the success of both movies is the specificity of the Australian setting -- not just the historical setting (1890's for both) or the natural setting, which is well captured by both, but  the social setting too, with its strange juxtaposition of the outback, reminiscent in some ways of the American frontier, and the remnants of the colonial social system and its manners.  In the outback, where her family scrape to make a living in a harsh environment, Sybylla Melvyn (Judy Davis) dreams only of having a ""brilliant career"" as a writer.  In her late teens, she is sullen, unpleasant, plain -- all in all, ""difficult,"" and her parents pack her off to her maternal grandmother, who lives in comfort in what looks like an English country house, where, over time, some rough edges are smoothed, but Sybylla never loses her sense of wanting to have her ""career,"" and she is quite outspoken about it.  Her grandmother and Aunt Helen want her to make a ""good"" marriage to a rich neighbor, Harry Beecham (Sam Neill), and Sybylla finds herself drawn to him, for he seems to love her despite (or perhaps because of) her independence and unconventionality.

Sybylla, if she is to marry at all, will marry only for love, and her aunt warns her that both she (Helen) and Sybylla's mother did that -- with disastrous results.  Her mother is living a hardscrabble life in the outback, with an ever-increasing family.  Helen has been deserted by her husband and now (in her words) bears ""the shame of being neither wife, widow, nor maid.""  Sybylla's response is a great moment -- though a quiet one, when she asks Helen why SHE feels ashamed.  The conversation stops there, but the point is made.  Harry proposes marriage shortly thereafter, and Sybylla asks for two years.  However, the increasing financial difficulties of Sybylla's family force her back to the outback to work as a teacher of the children of her father's landlord -- a rough and ready bunch (the whole family), but, it turns out, not unsympathetic ones.  And by seeing her do this work, which she is compelled to do, and doing it with better grace than the work she did as a teenager at the beginning of the movie, we see Sybylla facing and dealing with the realities of her parents' lives in a mature way.  Significantly, she did NOT, at the time of her family's difficulties, rush to Harry and the security that marriage to him would have offered -- a point that the movie, with great restraint, never brings up.  That Sybylla doesn't think of it either tells us all we need to know about her strength and integrity, for all her difficult-ness. Shortly after she leaves her teaching job, Harry renews his proposal . . .

Isn't the movie a ""romance"" when all's said and done?  Well, while the erotic undercurrents are there, so also is the recognition, explicit on Sybylla's part, that marriage and sex mean children and perhaps (c. 1900) a lot of them, and having children has consequences for one's freedom and energies.  It's a strength of the movie not only that Sybylla articulates that point but that we see, in her mother's situation and in the situation of the landlord's family, what having children, in that place and at that time, entails.  All of this is made clear without heavy-handed preachiness about feminism or creativity, and it makes ""my Brilliant Career"" an unusual romance.  Also unusual is the refusal to sentimentalize, by inflation, Sybylla's talent.  The movie doesn't assume that it's all that great. The effects of Armstrong's placing of the action in settings that are very clearly distinct -- the outback, the grandmother's house, Harry's farm -- speak for themselves, and Davis's performance is very much in tune with what these settings signify.  This is an intelligent and engaging movie, anchored by a great performance.",1435104000,,4353,4.851351351351352
