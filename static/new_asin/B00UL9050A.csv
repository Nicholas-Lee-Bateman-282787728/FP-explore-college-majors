7051475,4,B00UL9050A,"With Pierce Brosnan as the bad guy assassin (codename The Watchmaker) and Milla Jovovich the heroine (security expert Kate Abbott), you are set for an entertaining game of cat-and-mouse espionage. Abbott is at the top of her game in security within the US State Department and gets transferred to the Embassy in London. Unfortunately for her, she steps into the middle of intricate plans already in play by terrorists and she ends up not knowing whom she can trust. I am not going to nit-pick the plot or what shoulda coulda woulda been done in real life, as even the best of flicks suffer in some way with the same, but suffice it to say I was engaged. Survivor does not have the volume of blow-em-up sequences as a Bond or a Bourne, but has some good sequences of suspense and action. As the end neared I was wondering how Abbott was going to stop the attack. Jovovich delivers a strong performance and while Brosnan takes getting used to as a cold-blooded villain he pulls it off well. Other notable performances by Dylan McDermott, Angela Bassett, Robert Forster and James D'Arcy. Not a five star but I definitely enjoyed it.",1432944000,35,1129,4.65
7051476,3,B00UL9050A,"Handsomely filmed but dopey terrorist themed thriller clearly wants to be a present day Three Days of the Condor.  Milla Jovovich plays Kate Abbott, a security expert at the American consulate in London.  She uncovers a plot to allow members of a terrorist conspiracy into America.  The lead assassin behind the conspiracy, a man nick-named The Watchmaker played by an oddly cast Pierce Brosnan tries to take her out by blowing up a restaurant where she and her colleagues are eating lunch but he doesn't see Kate slip out to buy a birthday gift so she isn't there when the restaurant goes up in flames.

Kate initially follows embassy survivor protocol but one of her own colleagues tries to kill her in the park where she is supposed to wait--she manages to turn the gun on him which makes her a prime suspect in both the bombing and the shooting in the park, at least to the completely incompetent British security agents who decide she needs to be killed on sight since she has diplomatic immunity and there is no way to arrest her.  Kate ends up running from her own people, British agents and The Clockmaker because she doesn't know who she can trust.

In Three Days of the Condor the hero played by Robert Redford was in over his head but he was smart and made the best decisions he could, given the circumstances.  The same cannot be said for Milla Jovovich's Kate.  She calls the embassy from a payphone but hangs up before mentioning that her colleague Bill Talbot tried to kill her and that someone else is after her as well.  She is trying to evade capture but never bothers to ditch her Embassy I.D. which has a GPS chip in it.

Pierce Brosnan being an assassin working for Muslim terrorists is eventually explained away as plastic surgery.  The stupidity of Angela Bassett's American ambassador and James D'Arcy's British security officer who almost seem determined to allow the terrorist plot to succeed has no possible explanation beyond very bad writing.

Director James McTeigue has a tendency to make dumb movies with a lot of style--he previously helmed the mystery thriller The Raven starring John Cusack as Edgar Allen Poe, Ninja Assassin which was fun but extremely silly and V For Vendetta which was mostly crap--but very nice looking crap, thank you very much.  Survivor is without a doubt the worst script he's filmed yet but McTeigue either doesn't notice or doesn't care and ends up bringing a lot of style and craft to material that really doesn't deserve the effort.  The plus side to McTeigue's talent for providing surface pleasures is that if you can turn your brain off Survivor is mostly entertaining--it certainly looks exceptionally polished and is fast paced enough to never be dull--but the script really pales when compared with Three Days of the Condor or even The Jackal which this starts to resemble in its third act with Pierce Brosnan assuming the Bruce Willis part and Mila Jovovich as literally the only person who can stop him because everybody else seems to be more interested in nabbing her than preventing a terrorist plot that could claim over a million lives.

Pierce Brosnan makes a solid heavy but the part leans heavily on his screen presence since his character is afforded virtually no personality or motivation--he's basically a killing machine and nothing more.  Milla Jovovich has pretty limited dramatic chops but is safely within her comfort zone here in what eventually turns into an action role, the one genre where she tends to be effective.

Survivor is ultimately an above average, fast-paced time waster with an abundance of style--too bad it doesn't also have a brain.",1432857600,10,3638,4.813804173354735
7051477,4,B00UL9050A,"The critics really trashed this movie, but I enjoyed it.  Better than the average VoD movie.  Sure it was a plot we've seen rehashed hundreds of times, but it was nice seeing Milla Jovovich play a character outside of her usual Resident Evil persona.  Dylan McDermott plays the same character here as he does in every single show.  Pierce Brosnan was a nice addition, even though he seemingly plays the world's most incompetent assassin.  A heavy dosage of willing suspension of disbelief is required, but it was an entertaining popcorn flick.",1432857600,10,543,4.923076923076923
7051478,3,B00UL9050A,"This was a fun movie. Disregard the critics. It's not groundbreaking, it's not original, but the cast does a good job with what there given.

7051479,5,B00UL9050A,"To be honest, I had no idea this movie existed. My husband and I saw the trailer on our cable provider and we had a free rental through them that was good for a couple more days. So, we choose this movie. What a surprise out of the blue! It is really an outstanding thriller, which is our shared favorite style of movie. The cinematography is stunning, the effects really good, and the acting is fantastic.

As we watched the trailer, we kept saying actors names out loud and wondering how this movie had made it to the small screen without our even knowing it had been made. After seeing the movie, I did a little research and found out that the movie is being released at theaters and direct view video on demand today, May 29th, and we just happened to catch it as it was being shown for the first day. Theater and direct release is an interesting way of reaching the public - we are more apt to want to catch a movie at home than going out and as our Dallas suburb is having historic floods today, well, direct view was the way to go.

Milla Jovovich does a wonderful job. Pierce Brosnan, who is usually the good guy, turns out to be an excellent assassin and was pretty darn scarey as The Watchmaker. Support cast members, Dylan McDermott and Robert Forster, are on the top of their game, too. The action is a mile a minute and kept us on the edge of our seats. It was so good that I immediately pre-ordered the Blu-ray so that we can have a full family movie night once it is released in June.

If you love thriller chase type movies, whether you watch it at a theater, do a direct video on demand during the limited run, or buy the DVD/Blu-ray when it is released, this is one that you will want to see.",1432857600,104,1710,4.223241590214068
7051480,5,B00UL9050A,"What a surprisingly great flick. On the heels of the blow stuff up with no thought or reason action movies hollywood is begging to do over, and over. Comes an old school action/drama/thriller flick with some historic actors at the top of their game. To write about the story could give up some spoilers and I know that can be a real bummer for someone so I will just say, if they trailer interested you, then watch it ;). Its an easy 4.5/5 for me and I am pleased I bought rather than rented. Milla Jovovich (one of my favorite actresses) blew me away with this performance. Pierce Brosnan is great as always but it was a bit odd having him be the bad guy! (not a spoiler you find that out quite quickly). Check it out, don't think you will regret it.",1432857600,34,751,4.258741258741258

7051485,3,B00UL9050A,"Its pretty hard to come up with a more generic title for a movie than Survivor, and about the only surprise that most people watching the film will receive is that they're not seeing an expose of the reality TV show or a knockoff of the movie with Tom Hanks and the volleyball. Instead, Survivor is a generic knockoff of every race-the-clock action thriller ever made. Still, a better-than-average cast for a direct-to-video effort makes this one passable viewing on a slow night.

The main claim to fame of Survivor is the against-the-grain casting of Pierce Brosnan as an international hitman known as the Watchmaker. His target is Kate Abbott (Milla Jovovich), a security officer at the U.S. Embassy in London, who has stumbled onto a terrorist plot involving an Eastern European scientist (Roger Rees in his last film role) trying to get a visa to enter the U.S. When Kate smells something suspicious and tries to stall the application, she winds up the Watchmakers target. She eludes the first attempt on her life but then, incredibly, finds herself framed for murder and a suspected terrorist herself. She has to avoid every intelligence agency in England and get to the United States in time to stop the plot.

Movies like Survivor generally require massive suspensions of disbelief, but this one taxes even the most forgiving of audiences. Its hard to believe that terrorists trying to get someone into the United States in a hurry would set off a bomb to try to kill Kate, an act sure to raise alarm levels everywhere in England. Its even harder to believe that they would be able to cobble together a seemingly airtight frame-up of Kate out of thin air in a matter of minutes. Nor is the films credibility helped by the obligatory presence of an incredibly obtuse senior government official, in this case Angela Bassett as the U.S. Ambassador to England, who makes the wrong decision every single time, complicating life for Kate enormously.

The best thing Survivor has going for it is its cast. Pierce Brosnan takes the role seriously and plays his role with the right touch of casual menace, instead of hamming it up as many other actors might. Its also good to see Jovovich in a contemporary role instead of one of those post-apocalyptic video game movies. She can handle a major role in a big budget production, and should be given a chance. The actual terrorist plan, which the film carefully avoids revealing until the climax, is a pretty good one, as far as this type of movie goes, with a good final suspenseful sequence leading to a showdown fight between Jovovich and Brosnan.

Unfortunately, the rest of the action in Survivor, usually a saving grace of decent direct-to-video films, isn't even at that level. Instead there are a couple of extremely generic chases lasting no more that a few seconds before the target, usually Kate, manages to get away. A typical episode of a cop show like Blue Bloods will have more realistic and more exciting chases. And, for those looking for Milla Jovovich to get down and dirty with the bad guys, be forewarned, the films budget didn't allow for disposable stunt men for her to dispatch in fight scenes.

If Survivor had played in theaters, I would be hard pressed to recommend it. But, the standards are a bit lower for something intended for the television or device screen. On that basis, I can give the movie an extremely mild recommendation (2.5 stars rounded up to 3), solely for the actors and the rather ingenious premise of the terrorist plot. Once viewers figure that out (or see the reveal rather late in the film), the suspense does build over the last 15 minutes or so. Brosnan or Jovovich fans will have fun here, but most other viewers can survive without Survivor.",1487289600,,3742,4.768518518518518

Like most of these movies, it lacks realism with the fleer managing to avoid bullets being fired at them (by a supposed to hit man).  Also although cameras are a hindrance to her, this assasin has no qualms being seen on camera, even though he's planning on getting on an international flight to the USA.

Thing is she is well good n stuff and turns out to be harder to kill than the MRSA bug. This is Mila Jovovich  and she does a pretty good job in the role. What takes place is a full on action cat and mouse chase with guns, explosions and good old fashioned fisty cuffs.

The problem here is that it is all a bit far fetched with procedural inaccuracies and the like liberally scattered throughout the plot. The action though is good and it is really well made, but those with a penchant for realism should avoid like a rutting Wildebeest.

7051611,5,B00UL9050A,"These are the autumnal years of Pierce Brosnan. He has always been a media presence  - both before his Bond years and now in his post-Bond years.  He was a major TV star for many years and he was in an awfully lot of films. But Nowadays he is doing what only Sean Connery had been able to do before - he is a legitimate movie star after his period as Bond.

Connery was anxious to get out of the Bond movies. At the time we all thought he was crazy - and it was hard for him to get started.  But once he hit his stride he was a major force on the marques. Roger Moore was actually older than Connery so after Bond he had fewer options. Dalton played a few supporting roles when he hung up the tux but his name was never again above the titles. The present day Bond Daniel Craig doesn't seem to have much box office appeal.

But Brosnan routinely stars in one action movie after another. In this one he plays the bad guy. This can be hard for many Hollywood actors but Bond was always a morally ambiguous character so being a villain isn't much of a stretch for him.

In any case the script and the casting of Jovovich necessitates a strong player in the bad guy part. Jovovich has played do many super powered women that she now has trouble expressing vulnerability.  her screen persona is a bit too formidable to make a credible 'Damsel in Distress'  - unless he antagonist is very powerful and very evil. Brosnan delivers as the 'man you love to hate'.

The script has almost too much action. She's on screen for just a few moments before she is running for her life. And It's hard to believe that anyone could escape the uber-competent Brosnan. But as such movies go, this one is reasonably plausible.

7051631,4,B00UL9050A,"Am a fan of Pierce Brosnan - have been for decades. But when he plays the bad guy? You won't find a more appreciative audience.

This production struck a chord with one of the most fascinating ""up yours"" in cinema history. Do you remember when he lost the chance to play James Bond, Agent 007? Oh sure, he eventually earned that coveted role. But it should've been his seven years previous to his inaugural foray via '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Goldeneye/dp/B009GEH5NG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Goldeneye</a>'.

And as soon as he was finally free of those shackles - the very first movie challenge he undertook: Playing a cool detached spy.

Ha!

Portraying a cold war warrior in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fourth-Protocol/dp/B004OB2EYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fourth Protocol</a>"", he delivered an incredible tour-de-force blend of revenge mixed with pointed accusation designed specifically to silence detractors and invalidate the then-recent past.

For myself, this film felt like the perfect bookend to that film.

Once again, our man Brosnan has been converted from good guy to bad egg, revealing his thespian ability to produce predatory aspects of character. A paid dealer in death code named ""The Watchmaker"", he's one of the world's most successful assassins. His current assignment is going to cap a bloody career with something so unspeakably barbaric the entire world will literally stop in horrified silence.

Standing in his way is petite Kate Abbott. An information analyst with a bulldog instinct, she's been recently reassigned to the visa applications department in the British US Embassy. It's a demotion. Insinuated via the screenplay: While many have sung praises, her overconfidence led to a disastrous error. She's tucked far away to keep her out of trouble.

Having settled into her new life - uneventful repetition quickly becomes static drudgery. Until one bright autumn day. Something odd catches Kate's eye. Her gut instinct tells her to pay attention when several recent applications are red flagged for minor discrepancies which are normally and routinely dismissed. She tags them because they all seem to share an unusual commonality - they're all rarefied scientists. An uncommon occurrence.

Like pieces to a jigsaw with no master image to compare with - Kate knows these people are connected but can't prove it. Nor can she offer an explanation why these people seem so damn odd.

Her investigation begins to ruffle feathers from the companies that employ the applicants, some of whom are well-heeled donors of Parliamentary MPs. To the chagrin of her supervisors and the boss herself - the US Ambassador to The United Kingdom & Northern Ireland - Kate has been warned more than once to rope in her seemingly quixotic quest. Reminding her the reason why she was posted away from Washington DC - she's ordered to step back.

Kate decides that yes, it's probably best to let it go.

Suddenly, most of her colleagues are killed in an accidental explosion. And the person being looked at as a possible terrorist infiltrator? Yup.

Can she avoid multiple units of armed MI5 agents, being hunted down by her own people, and the spooky assassin while exposing the devilish plot?

Normally, I would tag such a clean, sharply written, and professional executed thriller with 5 Stars. However, the fact that this screenplay is industry boilerplate for the genre, I gotta ding it a half-star for rubber-stamping.

Still, very enjoyable and, if your cuppa is the spy/thriller genre - definitely worth a viewing.",1443139200,,3948,5.667796610169492

This screen play needs a reality re-write! Brosnans great. Its interesting to see him as a bad guy for a change (and hes still up for James Bond-like stuntscheck-out the stair-well slide!).

7051687,3,B00UL9050A,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Ive been a fan of Pierce Brosnan since his days on REMINGTON STEELE. Yes, Im old. I thought then that he should have been doing James Bond and he eventually did take on the role but far too late in the game. So any film hes starring in immediately draws my attention. The same holds true for Milla Jovovich. Hers is a case where a model moving into acting has actually paid off for both her and viewers alike. She handles herself well when it comes to action and the physicality that involves. So putting the two together for me meant this could be something special.

Jovovich stars as Kate Abbot, a newly appointed State Department employee in charge of terrorists research in London. Kate begins to suspect that there is something amiss when she notices a number of visas being approved for people we should be paying more attention to. She tries to bring that to the attention of her superior but it goes unnoticed. While out with her friends at lunch she excuses herself to run after something. As she returns the restaurant they were in explodes, the work of Nash (Brosnan) an assassin sent in to prevent her from exposing what she has learned.

Wounded and on the run, Kate is now hunted by Nash, the U.S. authorities and the British intelligence agency, the last two thinking she may be somehow involved in a terrorist plot. A meeting with her direct supervisor in an open area ends with him trying to kill her since hes the mole in the operation but instead results in his death at the hands of Nash.

Now on the run and framed for the murder of her boss, Kate must use all of her knowledge and skills to avoid not only detection from Nash but from her own government as well. Following the clues she was in the midst of uncovering Kate realizes that an attack on U.S. soil in New York is imminent. As the U.S. authorities try to find her so is the British intelligence agency. While offering assistance on the surface the reality is that the U.S. wants her back before the Brits can catch her.

Dedicated to her job and to saving American lives, Kate does her best to hide in the most camera friendly city in the world. Between traffic cams and more the odds are not in her favor. Add to that the fact that Nash is hot on her trail and being provided information from the same sources those odds are less likely for success as she proceeds forward. But with lives on the line, Kate is determined to prevent the attack she knows is imminent.

So does the movie hold up? Well it does and it doesnt. There are numerous plot holes to be found here and many have noted those in various reviews of the film. Whether the movie is good or not depends on how far you're willing to suspend belief with those holes. For me they weren't so overpowering that I couldn't sit back and enjoy the film for what it was, a nice little thriller.

The performances of both Brosnan and Jovovich help to make that happen. While neither would be considered Oscar worthy in these roles they both involved themselves deeply enough into the characters as to make them believable. Brosnan has the cold detachment down to a T here. Jovovich comes off as a well-trained operative but still fearful enough of what could happen to her to show concern at every corner. She does a great job here and its nice to see her in something other than a RESIDENT EVIL film. She has the ability to act, now if she could only get better parts.

In the end the movie isn't the greatest thing since sliced bread but it isn't the worst movie ever made either. Its a solid film that delivers a well-made end product that can be enjoyed for a nights viewing. With all the other garbage films out there to choose from this one shines above them all. It might not be one to add to your collection but it will entertain for an evening.",1440547200,,3849,4.40365682137834

So Pierce is supposed to be The Watchmaker, one of the top assassins in the world, BUT it's just toooooo hard to catch Milla, a worker in the embassy issuing visas lmao... of course all the british cops, NYPD, and the US Marines are retarded and can't catch her either...but then again cops all over the world are portrayed in every movie as idiots and can never catch anyone...
Personally I didn't know that Pierce was playing a bad guy in this movie otherwise I might not have watched it... I prefer him playing the hero since I think he is much more suited in that role than as the antagonist... still that wasn't the reason why I rooted for Pierce to kill Milla throughout the movie... i only felt bad for her coworkers in the beginning but never for Milla's character..
She was practically Jason Bourne in this movie anyways...nevermind that she doesn't have any sort of training to make that even remotely believable in this movie...

When she comes across a suspicious request, she delays a VISA. This delayed VISA means she must be eliminated. An assassin known as the Watchmaker (Pierce Brosnan) is being paid big bucks to do the task.

The film was a big cat and mouse chase with everyone after Kate Abbott. While she makes the film as exciting as possible, she is no Jason Bourne. I would have liked to seen the roles reversed with Pierce as the good guy and Mila as the assassin dressed in black leather and spiked heels. It wouldn't be as real, but a bit more entertaining for us simple folk.

She is a screener for foreigners applying for Visa's to visit the United States.  She suspects some of the applicants are terrorists, headed to the USA to wreak havoc.  After an attempt is made on her life, she relentlessly searches for information to back her theory.  She runs an emotional and frustrating mental obstacle course, as she pursues answers.

Brosnan does make for a good creepy villain and I also a fan of Jovovich who plays a bit different role that she normally does in being a sort of timid (at times) consular officer Abbott.  The story line is a bit lacking at times and has a lot of plot holes in addition to the improbable kind of character change that Abbott seems to go through in the movie from timid to gun shooting butt kicker.  The movie also follows a predictable and nothing new formula as well which brings it to its run of the mill kind of action movie that it is.  It is a decent action film and ok formulaic popcorn flick to watch.

7051836,4,B00UL9050A,"There is something to be said about a movie that has a 5.5 rating currently on IMDB. Lets take a look at Survivor.

Kate is an employee of the American Embassy who at the moment is suspicious of a man Dr. Balan who is trying to get a Visa. Later while attending a birthday party, Kate and her friends endure an explosion; of which her friends are killed but she is alive. Kate soon realizes that she is being hunted by a hitman known only as ""The Watchmaker"".

Survivor has a cast consisting of Pierce Brosnan, Milla Jovovich, Angela Bassett, and James D'Arcy. Though I am used to seeing Pierce Brosnan playing the good guy, his performance in Survivor made for an interesting take as ""The Watchmaker"". His character is fearless with a gun and determined to kill Kate. I found it interesting how his character seemed so invisible to the other characters besides Kate in the movie. Milla Jovovich's character Kate was easy to follow; she is not necessarily a ""no-holds barred"" type of charcter per se, but she easily eludes danger in the toughest fashion.

The story is fast but is still easy to follow. Some of the dialogue had me raising my eyebrows, but that did not stop me from enjoying the movie. IF I had to sort of compare this with another spy flick-it almost is like the 2010 movie Salt in a sense. As its own movie, Survivor manages to entertain thanks to an impressive cast(notably Pierce Brosnan), the thrill of the story, and the fact that I find it all around enjoyable. Survivor is

A Good Experience

I'm going to say it was not for me. I didn't feel like it developed a story line. It seemed to take a long time. I was disappointed. I like not Peirce and Milla acting abilities.

7051887,2,B00UL9050A,"A very difficult movie to follow unless you listen carefully to every spoken word (and even then it's possible to miss something). Pierce Brosnan's character of the most sought after assassin in the world, turns out to be a bumbling fool who relies on total annihilation of the population to try and get the target he is supposed to be after. When it comes down to a ""one on one"" situation one must suspect that his shooting ability is so inept that he would have great difficulty hitting the broad side of a barn with a hand full of wheat from 5 paces.
But as I said initially, you really need to listen carefully to the dialogue to have any chance of working out who is who and how they fit into the picture.  Unfortunately, this will mean watching the show more than once and that is something I found impossible to do.
A very disappointing production which I would rate at the lower levels of a ""made for TV"" movie.

7051900,4,B00UL9050A,"Although ""Survivor"" has a few unnecessarily drawn out moments, it has a refreshing old school spy feel with a modern touch. Jovovich has a face from the 1940s. I know, thats hard to explain, but it's fits this role. She was presented as a competent but not overly tough woman with true feminine emotions, unlike many female lead films that exaggerate these attributes in a way that has become tiresome. The makers of the film really came up with some dynomite chase scenes that stick in your head, causing you to contemplate a re- viewing of the movie. The plot; well, it's spy stuff that satisfies. This is Brosnans finest role to date as a cold hearted killer nicknamed ""The Watchman"". When it comes to Dylan McDermott, who is prominent in the film as one of Jovovich's superiors, I felt he was too much of a cardboard character which was a minor distraction for me. That aside, the film is a creative juggernaut.

And, how great was it to see Robert Forster (from the 80s film ""Alligator"" for those who remember) in this film? The man certainly has a face made for spy flicks. Also known as ""that guy"", he gives a good vibe to the film. ""Survivor"" was a screenplay that sat around for awhile until it was picked up and became a spy romp that turned out to be little gem. Fans of the genre will likely enjoy it more.",1435363200,2,1318,4.446280991735537

Although Milla Jovovich seems a little out of her comfort zone, she is good at her part.  Pierce Brosnan is excellent as the steely eyed antagonist, while Dylan McDermontt has a roll as good as his ""Stalked"" character from TV.  Fine performances from all.  Action is well paced and keeps you going.  You get a little irritated at the actions of some of the characters,  but that is probably intentional by the writer.

Bad acting, ultra-lazy script, moronic characters. Here are some vague spoilers in the form of a Q&A:

I have a handgun with a silencer and we're in the same dark room together. I'm the best hitman in the business. You don't even know I'm here. Do I:

A. Shoot you at the first chance
B. Roll a bomb in your general direction

A high strung old man thinks you just might be a threat to my terrorist plot because you questioned my visa application. Do I hire the best hitman in the world to:
A. Try to blow you up with all your co-workers. (Oh by the way if you all die there won't be anyone to issue my visa)
B. Carefully assassinate you such that it looks like an accident

I have the drop on you in a dark alley. And I have a loaded revolver in my waistband, And I really want to kill you. And you have no idea I'm coming. Do I:

A. Walk up behind you and shoot you six times or until you are dead, whichever comes first
B. Keep my gun holstered and charge at you awkwardly, allowing you the opportunity to blind me with your signature cat's claw move

I'd really like to earn $50 billion. My plan to earn $50 billion has a lot of moving parts and I have plenty of preparations to make. It's New Year's Eve in New York. I make sure to arrive from JFK by taxi at least:

Milla Jovovich plays a security expert at the American Embassy in London, who stumbles across a sensitive piece of information about a planned terrorist plot that she was not supposed to see.  Shortly thereafter, she narrowly escapes an explosion that kills all of her co-workers, and then she finds herself on the run with both a master assassin (Pierce Brosnan) and all of Londons police force out to do her in.

James McTeigue directed this fast-paced, well-acted thriller that features some exciting action sequences and a terrorists scheme that, hopefully, will not give the wrong people ideas. Dylan McDermott, Angela Bassett, Robert Forster and James DArcy co-star.

The Blu-ray disc from Alchemy includes a Making of featurette and several deleted scenes that clarify certain plot points in the film proper.

Dylan McDermott didn't have enough lines playing his ""yes man"" character (he was worthy of more, totally miscast here), but seeing Angela Bassett pop up as the Ambassador was a nice surprise.

As it turns out, I'm having so many problems streaming Amazon videos (buffering stops and starts, more stopping than starting), that I ended up skipping through some fairly sizable chunks of the film to get to the end.

i watched the first 15 minutes up thru the cafe explosion and then ended up skipping forward through the whole movie in about another 15 minutes.

Overall, expected it to suck me in for a couple of hours but it just didn't hold my interest. People tend to write how predictable a movie is as a reason for not liking it. I've never written such a thing, but in the opening scenes where there's a bad doctor trying to enter the U.S. whose wife died because she was denied a visa, its pretty easy to see he might have a motive for a criminal act. Then when the supervisor intervenes in the case its so easy to see he might be corrupted. Both of these very obvious things occurred in the first few minutes, so i'm guessing that put me in the ""this is so predictable"" mode.

The fight sequences with Milla were far from her normal super-hero stunts, which made for more realism, but less interest.

1. She's wearing a scarf around her neck in England and never once pulls it up over her head to cover her features when she is, ""familiar with the country"" so she would know there are cameras EVERYWHERE there.
2. There is no way a person with known skills such as ""explosive gas specialist"" who is known to have had a family member die because of a ""delayed visa"" into the country for treatment would't be considered a serious risk and flagged by everyone.
3. After the embassy security guy was found injured in Talbot's apartment, embassy security services would have been all over that place and found the CDs etc. and backtracked everything the father had worked on and would have picked everyone up. (Not that the first thing those same services wouldn't have done was go, seal up all the residences etc. and find out all that s*** right after the bombing and shooting anyway.
4. Ambassadors do not run security operations and do not call TSA, HSA, passport control etc. to tell them to look for someone. Ambassadors don't do that, period. Nice drama and OOOH! factor addition I guess.

Maybe watch it as a TV movie",1433289600,,542,4.084905660377358

Excellent job on filming , scripting ,acting etc. Since the world goes around there may be similar stories, but this one is well made and directed very well which  is not a detriment to this film but a huge plus. If this is your genre of movies I say don't miss it. I will watch this one again.",1433203200,22,353,4.115942028985507

7052055,3,B00UL9050A,"A typical spy/assassin movie. The movie had a lot of filler such as seemingly endless chase scenes. Our heroine manages to survive numerous attempts on her life and most seemed contrived. I like Brosnan and Jovovich so that is why I rented this movie. I would still watch it again even knowing how mediocre it is. This movie really does not have many good points, some explanations are missing, our heroine's guilt is assumed by almost everyone, lots of filler and a not unexpected ending. However if you are a fan of Brosnan and Jovovich, then you might enjoy this movie, we did mostly.",1433030400,2,587,4.653846153846154
