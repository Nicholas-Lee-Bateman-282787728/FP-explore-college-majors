8389578,3,B00366BBKS,"I had some leftover pizza waiting for me at home when I watched this.  So I am not sure if watching this will make you want to order pizza or not.

This work was useful to me because it answered all the important questions.  What are the origins of pizza?  How did an Italian dish become so popular in the US?  What are the origins of Pizza Hut and Domino's?  When did deep-dish pizza arrive?  When did delivery pizza get invented?  When did frozen pizza become available to the public?  Etc.

Maybe Food Channel Network fans would have wanted more.  For me, as a layperson who just loves him some pizza this was highly informative and in a easily (mentally) digestable format.  Thanks, History Channel!",1345680000,,703,4.536
