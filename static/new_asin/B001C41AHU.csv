8285825,3,B001C41AHU,"Michael Winner's Firepower is a typical example of the kind of globe-trotting star vehicle so beloved of Lew Grade's well-funded but rarely successful ITC Films, the kind of nonsense you get the impression began with coming up with a premise and assembling the stars - Sophia Loren, James Coburn, O.J. Simpson, Eli Wallach and Anthony Franciosca doing his best Burt Lancaster impression - with the script an afterthought. In reality its genesis was more convoluted, starting life as a rejected pitch for a Dirty Harry sequel before being rewritten as a Charles Bronson vehicle only for the star to jump ship. It's a decent enough premise for a no-brainer action movie, with Loren persuading the US government to hire Coburn's former mob enforcer to kidnap the reclusive third richest man in the world, who is responsible for her husband's murder. Unfortunately, he's so reclusive no-one knows what he looks like, only that he may be hiding out in Antigua. Failing to smoke him out - literally - by burning down his villa, they simply hop islands and decide to kidnap his doctor instead, with the usual complications en route to a bulldozer and gratuitous explosions finale.

In many ways this feels like a glossy late 70s retread of the kind of thriller Howard Hawks was churning out with Mitchum and Russell in the latter days of RKO, but Cobun and Loren don't burn bright enough to make it fly. Not that they're given much to work with. Despite being written by Gerald Wilson, who was responsible for scripting Michael Winner's best film, Lawman, this never really graduates from keeping the cast in their comfort zone while the big twist is so easy to guess you'll probably know it before the opening credits have finished. Which leaves the film with nice scenery, a few action sequences, some odd bit part casting (Billy Barty as a casino owner, Jake LaMotta as a bodyguard and Victor Mature, looking like a Thunderbirds puppet in a closing gag as the fourth richest man in the world) and a lot of wardrobe changes for its leading lady. So many, in fact, that when Loren says ""Don't say I haven't changed,"" you suspect someone's making an in-joke because she seems to have a different outfit on every time she moves from one room to another.

Technically it's fairly anonymous, with none of Winner's usual love of the zoom lens, but while it's less shoddy than his later films it's still got it's odd jarring moments, like a bizarre and slightly scary shot of Coburn grinning that seems to come out of nowhere during a briefing, as well as another of his PA system in-jokes where cinematographer Robert Paynter is hailed in one scene. That that's one of the more memorable things about this harmless bit of nonsense pretty much says it all, but as brain-off winding down fare it just about does the trick.

For some reason the film has never been released on DVD in the US or UK, though the best of the few foreign releases are the deleted Australian DVD and the decent German DVD, which is a fullframe transfer (the top and bottom have simply been unmasked from the image rather than the sides cropped) with English or German soundtracks and the original theatrical trailer.",1351555200,2,3179,4.755434782608695
