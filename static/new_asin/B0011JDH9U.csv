3066303,5,B0011JDH9U,"I have always felt a spiritual companionship with wolves, and this DVD is one that I will cherish forever.  Nature: Yellowstone takes an intricate look at the lives of a few packs of wolves in the Yellowstone region of North America.  The way in which these various packs of wolves were depicted, and the time and energy it took to follow them from season to season, really gave me the impression that whoever worked on this piece really cared about what they were filming (creating), and they were willing to take the time to make sure that their footage contained emotional content, and that it was also carefully orchestrated.  Christmas in Yellowstone (program two on this DVD) was also very good, and it proved to be a good accompanying piece to program one. Another great DVD about one wolf in particular is Nature: The Wolf That Changed America.",1253750400,8,852,4.743243243243243
3066304,5,B0011JDH9U,This video was very good in helping us recreate our vacation in Yellowstone Park when our own video was lost by the developer.  Very good information about the wolves,1250380800,,166,4.724137931034483
3066305,5,B0011JDH9U,"This double feature from Nature is the sweetest deal imaginable - if you're a fan of Yellowstone and all its inhabitants, but particularly if you're a wolf lover.  ""In the Valley of the Wolves"" is suberbly filmed, and the continuing saga of the Druid Peak Pack, wonderfully narrated by F. Nurray Abraham.  ""Christmas in Yellowstone"" is equally awesome in every aspect, but sells ALONE for the same price, as does ""In the Valley of the Wolves.""  To buy just one of these fabulous documentaries would be crazy.  Buy this DVD and get almost two hours of utterly beautiful film-making, of one of the most exquisite places on Earth (in my opinion) for $18.00!!!",1228694400,25,656,4.778761061946903

3066368,5,B0011JDH9U,"A visual treat for anyone that loves wolves. It's a nice to be able to appreciate nature and the ever so dwindling wildlife in this country by watching this DVD. With all the violence & destruction that surrounds us today, it's almost therapeutic to watch nature doing it's thing in Yellowstone. Hopefully we can preserve it the way it was when this DVD was filmed.",1381104000,2,365,4.630769230769231
3066369,5,B0011JDH9U,"This documentary tells the story of wolf packs in Yellowstone National Park. Why it may not be the most up-to-date, it is very informational and educational. Viewer warning: there is one disturbing coyote kill. Not appropriate for some people or children. Overall, a very good film.",1359763200,3,282,5.1521739130434785
3066370,5,B0011JDH9U,"If you weren't impressed by or didn't love wolves before, you might after watching this!  Absolutely spellbinding and insightful piece of art that captures not only the spirit of the wolf, but also the most beautiful scenery.  I laughed, I cried and never grow tired of watching.  I have given this DVD to everyone I know and cherish my copy!",1316908800,,342,4.666666666666667
3066371,4,B0011JDH9U,"I invite you to watch this podcast on Youtube (watch?v=3H1gzVj8i4o) called Diamond Dust, which is a promotional for ""Christmas in Yellowstone"".  Absolutely beautiful, isn't it?  With wonderful music, but of course the low-resolution video is terribly grainy.  I bought this DVD expecting to see and hear it the way the podcast is supposed to be, with hopefully more of the same.
Guess what?  It's not part of the actual program!  Not there at all!  What's up with that?  I bought ""Christmas in Yellowstone"", expecting to see and hear more of what is in the podcast promoting ""Christmas in Yellowstone"", and it's not there!  Am I being too picky in expecting to find the same footage and music?
I'm not discouraging anyone from buying this program, it's wonderful, it's beautiful, but I am expressing my disappointment to the producers over this omission.",1312329600,,854,5.00709219858156
3066372,5,B0011JDH9U,"I'm a bit biased because I just released my film on Amazon, but this movie is so interest and beautiful; it makes you want to know more.  We are now entering a period when humans are determining their natural place in the world, and reintroducing wolves to the Yellowstone ecosystem is one of those keystone events that really open people's eyes to this history changing event.
Great film.  Buy it and watch it over and over.

3066373,5,B0011JDH9U,This is a great documentary and narrated the best way possible. I have watched this at least 4 times since opening it on Christmas Day,1293753600,,134,4.4
3066374,5,B0011JDH9U,"In The Valley Of The Wolves features great scenes of wolves running after elk, coyotes, and other wolves.  Energetic exhilarating music and meaningful, informative writing are present throughout this story of wolves battling for control of Lamar Valley in Yellowstone National Park.  I've read that wolves do not go into water and do not climb, but this Nature documentary shows wolves easily going into water and carefully stepping up a very steep slope.  After greeting the visiting male wolf, the daughter wolf shows submissive lowered body posture toward her mother.  Two battling bull elk charge smoothly down a slope with their large antlers pressed together, and head-butting buffaloes kick up ground dust.  I particularly liked the Druid wolves' emotional return to Lamar Valley at the end.  On the front of the dvd case and on the dvd itself, the featured wolf has the extraordinary adult characteristic of light-blue eyes.",1286150400,10,932,5.221476510067114

I'm sure she told him everything she knew about wolves and equally certain he listened patiently to the bright, inquisitive child.  Mr. Landis gave her one of his CD sets about the white wolves at Yellowstone and she was thrilled beyond measure.  Those CDs prompted us to seek more of Bob Landis' work.  This one does not disappoint and will be viewed again with interest.",1520380800,,524,4.988505747126437

Long time friend has dog just like this and that was motivation for buying dvd. Yellowstone is at its best when the weather is at its worst,1471824000,3,285,4.5
8241892,5,B0011JDH9U,I have been fortunate to observe the wolf packs in Yellowstone Park shortly after their introduction into the park years ago when I participated in a photography trip to that area. At that time we observed them early in the morning while they were playing and interacting with each other. The filming of the DVD was well done and told the story. I hope that the wolves will keep on thriving without human interference. We need all species to interact for the good of the whole ecosystem.,1461196800,3,487,4.609195402298851
