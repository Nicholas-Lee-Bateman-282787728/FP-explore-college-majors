7935613,5,B00005AQ6T,"My daughter had asked for a violin, so I got her 1 for Christmas and this instruction book to help her get started.
She hung the violin on the wall and put this book in her closet; she didn't want to PLAY the violin, she merely wanted to DISPLAY the violin.
I could have saved hundreds of dollars and bought her a poster!! >:(
So the BOOK should see 5 stars, but SHE should see a lot more... >:)",1487116800,,395,4.012658227848101

7935616,1,B00005AQ6T,"I'm just taking up the violin after playing clarinet for 8 years.  I have a book and got this DVD so I could SEE how to do things.  My violin sounds nothing like Dana Freeman's (person on the DVD).  I still am having a lot of trouble bowing because you can't see how she holds the bow.  She only tells you the high points, when I put my fingers on the strings, nothing came out.  She also did ""finger-wiggling"" techniques that she didn't even explain.  I was more confused and frustrated after watching this DVD.  If you've already got it, watch it over and over and over until it's as clear as glass. Otherwise, save your money and get a beginning level method book.",1077840000,46,667,4.330645161290323
