""Let Him Have It"" is a riveting drama, whose sympathetic (and well-portrayed)  characters draw you in (and along, on their emotionally tumultuous ride,  based largely on a true story).  The movie is not an easy one to watch  precisely because it is so well-made.  The growing sense of imminent doom  contrasted with the deep humanity and helplessness of the protagonist and  his family make watching it a visceral experience, whose intensity I don't  think has been matched by any other film I have seen.  The dramatically  climactic scene (I will not give it away here) and all of its particulars,  will stay with you a long, long time.",960508800,13,767,4.5661764705882355
675126,5,630351524X,"I found this vhs promo copy at a goodwill. I had never heard of it. It look like the kind
of movies I enjoy. This is one gripping disturbing true story that everyone should see.
It's a masterpiece of movie making. It's the true story of injustice system when a mentally
challenged 19 year old is hung for the killing of a policeman by his 16 year old friend who
only got 10 years in jail! The movie is based in the 50's and is brilliantly done by director
and actors. I noticed the dad in the movie is played by the actor who was brilliant as the
private in Night of the Generals and he's as good in this role. The actors playing the
two boys are also excellent. It makes a good case for the death penalty to be looked at
more carefully but this case was just pure incompetence by those involved in prosecuting
this case and to this day the case has never been over turned to clear the innocents name.",1399161600,,901,4.154285714285714
675127,4,630351524X,"Based on a true story, this is a horrific tale of justice mishandled in Britain. Although filmmakers have a case to make, they stay true to the basic facts and approach the subject even-handedly. The cast is exceptional.

675129,5,630351524X,"A friend once explained the difference, in her opinion, between a ""movie"" and a ""film.""  A movie, she said, is something seen for entertainment, to while away a few pleasant hours, then likely forget as you move onto whatever comes next.  A film, on the other hand, is intense, thought-provoking, inspires conversation, exchange of ideas and debate, and stays with you long after the final credits.  Let Him Have it, on all levels, is a film.

Based on a true story, and set in 1950s England, Let Him Have It tells of Derek Bentley, a young man with learning disabilities, who falls in with the wrong crowd and becomes involved in more and more serious crimes.  One night, he is out with a friend who points a loaded gun at a police officer.  As the officer tries to defuse the situation, by persuading them to surrender, Derek suddenly cries out. ""Let him have it, Chris!""  The question of what he actually meant by these words (was it to follow directions and hand over the weapon, or to fire at the officer, shooting him and therefore allowing their escape?) leads to riveting courtroom and jailhouse scenes of Derek's arrest, trial, and sentence.

Christopher Eccleston is outstanding as Derek.  Although I have seen him in other roles since, this may be his finest hour.  Equally noteworthy are Clare Holman as his loving, supportive, determined sister Iris, and Tom Courtenay as Derek's father.  In one of the most memorable scenes, Mr. Bentley stands in the road, mute, motionless, awaiting the arrival of the postman with the letter that will reveal Derek's fate.  Although he appears to be alone, he is not...everyone who has watched to this point, and come to know and love and care about this family, will be right there alongside him.

As ""quiet"" as Let Him Have It may appear to be, it uses its voice to the utmost, to present a strong and compelling case against capital punishment.  Please take the time to see it, think about it, talk about it, and recommend it to someone else.  This is a 110 minute hidden gem of a FILM.

Thank you.",1378425600,,2050,4.652777777777778
675130,5,630351524X,This movie was very good on many levels. The acting was exceptional across the board. The direction was just as good. The writing was the same. This movie is intense; it can turn your stomach at times. But I think it is well worth watching.,1372118400,,240,4.355555555555555
675131,4,630351524X,"As powerless a feeling one knows is to watch someone die, the 1991 film LET HIM HAVE IT reminds us in its telling of the 1950s true story of Derek Bentley, a 19-year old British man who as a child was brain damaged when the Germans bombed his home.  As if that does not cost him enough his resulting lack of judgment leads to getting caught in the middle of a crime that leaves a police officer dead - and a death sentence for the young man upon being found guilty of murder.

Viewing the trial scenes in LET HIM HAVE IT, you may ask why no one in the British court seems to want to understand the situation of an adult whose mental age was that of an 11-year old.  Can't they see his disadvantage?  Are they hell bent on making someone pay for the life of the dead policeman?  LET HIM HAVE IT does not say, as if to let us know just how desperate the feeling was for family, friends, and others who cared about both Derek Bentley and justice.

See LET HIM HAVE IT.  Derek Bentley paid a grossly unfair price but England later abolished the death penalty perhaps in part because of it.  His name was finally cleared several years after the film was made.",1352764800,,1154,4.213636363636364

675135,3,630351524X,"After watching 'Let Him Have It' for the first time based upon overwhelmingly positive reviews on this site and elsewhere, I had the less-than-fulfilling feeling that I've seen this film before. The acting is mainly fine, as are the sets, locations and photography. Its themes, however, are just too familiar, bordering on cliche, as presented in the touching but generally superficial script, and the story-- while told in a quaintly understated way by director Medak (except perhaps for the scenes involving the almost comically Cagneyesque Craig brothers)-- rings as a partial truth, which is often the problem with reality-based cinema ('A Beautiful Mind,' 'Bloody Sunday,' and 'Birdman of Alcatraz' pop to mind), and particularly with reality-based cinema involving that dreaded, perennial villain Social Injustice ('In the Name of the Father,' 'A Dry White Season,' 'The Hurricane,' etc.).

I don't, as some reviewers do, decry a movie for not delving into areas I personally believe it should have (e.g., what were the Crown's reasons for so rigidly pursuing the death penalty in this obviously shaky legal case?)-- it must be judged for what it is rather than for what it is not. But when that movie's emotional balance hinges on a specific, historic issue or incident I think it always improves the work's veracity, and thereby its watchability, to show as many sides of that issue or incident as cinematically possible. Otherwise the viewer suspects the film's creators of having an agenda, of pushing him by revision or omission to reach the conclusions they have reached (are we given fair detail about Derek's behavior, his condition, his petty criminal involvements, his relationship to his family, the court proceedings and so on?), and by those intellectual standards I've docked the very emotional LHHI a couple of points.",1279843200,,1839,5.233898305084746
675216,4,630351524X,"""Let Him Have It"" tells the real-life story of 1950s British teen, Derek Bentley (Christopher Eccleston).  As a child during WWII, Derek's home was bombed, and he sustained a head injury which left him with low intelligence and poor decision-making skills.  He ends up falling in with a bad crowd, who take advantage of Derek's desire to fit in and his naivety.  He's sent to an ""approved school"" (reform school) for years, and after his release Derek's family does everything they can to keep him out of trouble.  However, a group of teens, lead by Christopher Craig, soon persuades Derek to join in their robberies.  Derek tries to break free of their influence, but the situation leads to tragedy.

The film does a nice job telling Derek's story in a sympathetic way and adroitly combines the crime elements and court trial to tell a cohesive story.  The movie raises interesting questions concerning how we hold people accountable based on issues of age and intelligence.  Although its somewhat low-key story-telling style could have been pumped up a tad, the movie avoids unnecessary melodrama, which adds gravity to the finale.  The acting is uniformly fine, with many of the supporting roles taken up by top-notch actors, including Tom Courtenay, Eileen Atkins, and Tom Bell.  What really makes the film worth-while, though, is its superb look.  As he did with ""The Krays"" a year previously, director Peter Medak beautifully recreates the look and feel of London crime in the 1950s and 1960s.  It really helps place this thought-provoking story in context.",1254528000,4,1563,5.015503875968992

Christopher Eccleston's portrayal is quite realistic and draws you into Derek's plight (I'm a RN and I had to fight not to spring to Chris's aid during his scenes where he seized as Derek- yes, they were THAT convincing).

675220,5,630351524X,"I won't bother telling the plot of this film since so many other reviewers have outlined it in great detail.  I will only say there is no greater cinematic indictment of the death penalty than this devastating film.  What gives it special significance, of course, is that it is based on a true case - a case that eventually led to abolition of capital punishment in Great Britain.  I shutter to think of the number of innocent people executed in countries (including the so-called ""civilized"" United States) practicing capital punishment in order to satisfy the public's hasty and often misguided need for revenge.  LET HIM HAVE IT will have a profound impact on anyone who sees it, regardless of his/her stand on the death penalty.",1133395200,9,732,4.832
675221,3,630351524X,"This movie had an enormous emotional impact on me.  I think it brought me close to tears when I first saw it.  Perhaps the saddest scene in it is the one when he asks his mother about his date with the hangman, ""Is it going to hurt?""

My main complaint with this movie is the fact that it totally focuses on the injustice done to Derek Bentley.  The police officer who was murdered that night gets perhaps two lines of dialogue.  After his death, the only reference to him is that his widow didn't call for Bentley's death.

Even though I remain a supporter of the death penalty, I don't think that Bentley should have been executed.  I do think that the man needed to be in a controlled environment because he did engage in criminal activity that night, and someone died because of it.

With that said, I wish the movie had given maybe five more minutes of character development to the police officer.  Bentley being executed was a miscarriage of justice.  But so was the killing of the police officer.  Bentley didn't get a fair trial or due process, but the police officer didn't get any trial or process at all.

Think about it when you watch this movie.",1128211200,9,1158,4.436018957345971
675222,5,630351524X,"Gosh dang pronouns... This movie serves a lesson beyond the grammatical, and is quite sad.  Due to the absurd, yet detrimental, aspects of the death penalty in this film, what one says is shown to say a lot about him.",1094774400,2,217,4.425
675223,5,630351524X,"This film, based upon a true story, illustrates the misapplication of the death penalty. In 1953 England, a slow witted young man, Derek Bentley, was executed, hanged  for his alleged part in the killing of a police officer. It was a case which received much notoriety at the time.

Derek Bentley (Chris Eccleston) was a learning disabled, young man who was easily led. His sister, Iris (Clare Holman), however, treated him like a regular guy, and he thrived under her watchful eye. His steadfast, working class parents, William and Lilian Bentley (Tom Courtenay and Eileen Atkins), did everything they could to ensure that their son would stay on the straight and narrow. Still, boys will be boys, and one night, Derek, wanting to be one of the boys, simply hooked up with the wrong crowd who was up to no good. Although Derek was unarmed, another of the other boys was not, and when an inevitable clash with the police came about, a police officer was shot. Derek's by now famous words, ""Let him have it"", were the catalyst for his trial, conviction, and execution.

Notwithstanding Derek's learning disability, the ambiguity of the statement attributed to him, and his tangential involvement during the shootout with the police, Derek was given the death penalty. The draconian sentence was a heartbreaking blow to Derek and his family, as it was always Derek's position that he meant for the shooter to let the police have the gun. Nearly forty five years later, after persistent efforts by his beloved sister, Iris, Derek was finally exonerated by the very courts that had earlier found him guilty. In reality, it was too little, too late, for Derek.

Chris Eccleston gives a bravura performance as the slow witted Derek, compelling and moving. He plays him as a young man who was aware of his shortcomings and very much wanted to be accepted by his peers. Tom Courtenay and Eileen Atkins are outstanding as the loving parents whose steadfast belief in the system is derailed at the last. Clare Holman is excellent as the sister whose expectations of her brother would never fail to make him try harder. All in all, the entire cast gives notable performances. Superbly directed by Peter Medak, it is a film well worth watching.",1024099200,29,2232,4.850393700787402

Eccleston is only 28 in this film and already showing the incredible talent that makes him unforgettable in every role he takes on.  No one can look away from those penetrating blue eyes even as you are swept away by Bentley's struggles as a mentally disabled epileptic.

7849655,5,630351524X,"To star with, I am a huge, huge fan of Peter Medak. His other movies <The Cangeling><The Krays><Romeo is Bleeding> are all masterpiece.

<The Cangeling> is a horror movie about a haunted house, <The Krays> is a mafia movie, <Romeo Is Bleeding> is about a woman's betrayal. A very brutal sexual movie.

All the films that he made are so well done and very much pleasure to look and absoultely have to own on dvd. Sadly that they were not released in bluray yet.

Now this film is the best among them I guess.

The editing, the using of music, the acting, the lighting, the camera framing, they are just all top class.

Surpriginly the director of photography was done by Oliver Stapleton who did a lot, I mean a lot of Hollywood boxoffice hit movies later and he did none of the art films later. He knows how to please the regular audiences.

The story to be said is about this guy Derek Bentley who had a trauma when he was a boy when there was a war and he was survived. He was burried inside the rocks and bearly people found him and he happend to live that way. But he from time to time looses his mind and his body is all shaking like he is about to die or something.

One day he and his closest frind Cris meet this bunch of robbers and happens to got guns. But short after, they got captured by cops and go to prison.

Being left alone, they decide to rob a place by their own.

This was just a kid's stuff at the beginning but it ends with a horrible tregidy.

Having gun and all, during sneaking inside the store, a girl witness them and tells her father, the father calls the cops .

Surrounded by cops, accidentally Cris shot one cop and he dies instantly.

The thing was Derek didn't do anything but tells his frind one word that is 'Let him have it.'

Later even he cannot explain what that means that happens to be in the court that it is something that provoked his friend to shoot the cop.

You see that Derek was 19 and he got the death sentence and his friend was 16 and got the life prisonment.

His family did everything to proove that he is innocent but failed to do so.

He was hanged to death at the end.

But rediculously his friend after 10 something years later got out from the prison.

The parents even after the son's death did everything to prove the son's innocence.

The story is not all new but as I told you, the music is kind of off beat but very convincing using piano, violine and harp. It can never be released as a CD but great for the mood of the movie I can tell.

The framing and the lighting were just so artistic that you will be totally sucked into it. It was sometimes like film noir like. But in color.

The great thing about this director is he is making each movies as if it is his last work. I can see everytime I see his movies. It's just pure perfection.

Ther is this long court scene at the end of the movie and it was not boring at all. I think it was because of the good acting and intensive music and the moody lights, framing.

When the day the son is about to die, there is this moment the father is not sleeping, the exterior of the house with the streetlights still on, that was for some reason very much sad and moody. And when it turns into morning, we can feel that it's time for the son to be hanged.

I again felt how great director Peter Medak is and if I have a chance I really want to show all of his work.
