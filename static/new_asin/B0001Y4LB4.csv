8018223,5,B0001Y4LB4,"This video not only features Archie and all his friends from Riverdale High, it also features 8 different short cartoons per episode that are based on comic strips - Dick Tracy, Nancy and Sluggo, Moon Mullins, Captain and the Kids (A.K.A. Katzenjammer Kids), Smokey Stover, Emmy Lou, The Dropouts.

It's a neat piece of comics history to see such a diverse group of newspaper comics animated - ""Captain and the Kids"" started running in newspapers in 1912, ""Nancy"" spun off from the ""Fritzi Ritz"" comic of 1922, ""Moon Mullins"" debuted in 1923, ""Dick Tracy"" 1931, ""Smokey Stover"" 1935, ""Emmy Lou"" 1944 (originally titled ""Bobby Socks"") and finally, ""The Dropouts"" debuted in 1968.  All of these comic strips were running in papers at the time of this series, which was produced in 1971.  Although some like ""Dick Tracy"" or ""Broom Hilda"" made other cartoon appearances on TV, this would be the only time some of the cartoons appeared in animated form.  NONE of the content on this DVD is available elsewhere!

It's amazing that this was produced, because the licensing itself is such hodge podge of companies with the Chicago tribune, New York News and United Features Syndicate added to the Archie company's stock of characters.  I assume Filmation had development deals for newspaper strip cartoons that imploded or with no other viable outlet, evolved into the ""Archie's T.V. Funnies"" series - 3 episodes of which are included on this DVD.  It's even MORE amazing that his video was released since this would seem to continue to be a licensing quagmire.  A bonus cartoon is included which is an episode of the never released on DVD ""The U.S of Archie"".

Highly recommended not just for Archie fans, but also for fans of newspaper comics and animation buffs who will get a kick out of the never-to-be-repeated grouping of these characters.",1386633600,,1838,4.922330097087379
