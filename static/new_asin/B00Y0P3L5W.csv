8717302,5,B00Y0P3L5W,"Really fun, dark, twisted tale of the men who take tickets, and nab scoff-laws on the Budapest subway; their social structure and rivalries, forming a blackly comic satire on the nature of society as a whole.

Beautifully shot, stylish and stylized, full of exciting scenes, and dark odd characters. Sort of the Coen brothers meet Eastern Europe ennui. Not super deep, and there are a plot few cheats, but I enjoyed every minute of it.

Note: the US version is not anamorphic, and doesn't do justice to this great looking film. If you have access to an all region player, this Hungarian DVD, with english subtitles is a substantial visual improvement.  Plus this version has a slew of extras on the 2nd disc.  Expensive, but may be worth it if you're a fan.",1439424000,,757,4.669172932330827
