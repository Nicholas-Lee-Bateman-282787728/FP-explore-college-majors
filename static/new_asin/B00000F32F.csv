But what no one knows is that it was filmed in Willoughby Ohio, where The Andrews School For Girls, a boarding school which I went to and graduated in '78 the same time this movie was done, is! I believe one of our teachers,(which I didn't have) an art teacher(Mr. Kelly) was one of the extras. None of the outside did I recognize as my old campus but perhaps it was filmed on a part of the campus I never frequented. Perhaps any other Andrews Alumnus is out there who remembers this movie?",1031529600,,603,4.252173913043478

1203173,4,B00000F32F,"""The Dark Secret of Harvest Home"" creeped me out when I first saw it on TV in '78.  It hasn't lost any of its charm in the intervening years.  Bette Davis is a mysterious, menacing matriarch; David Ackroyd is  by turns angry and confused as the matriarchal/pagan lifestyle of this  rural community unfolds around him and engulfs the women in his family --  including his daughter, portrayed by a very young Rosanna Arquette.  Creepy  and atmospheric, ""Harvest Home"" is well worth watching.",918000000,5,489,4.890243902439025

1203305,2,B00000F32F,"I obtained a similar version years ago--horrible quality and chopped up so much if one didn't see the original, it might be difficult to understand what the heck was going on.

For those of you wondering about a full length version-I had read that one of the characters has refused to sign the contract to allow this movie to be put on DVD in its entire length.  For some reason I seem to think it is Michael O'Keefe (Worthy in the movie) but this could be wrong since unfortunately I did not save the information.  One would think whoever it is might be passing up on earning residuals, but perhaps that lies at the heart of the matter.

Hence, this copy, which is barely intelligible.  If you do want to see a condensed version, then I'm supposing this is OK for that and is about the best you will get.  But as for me, I loved the mini-series (how could it be scrunched into under an hour and a half when it ran for, I believe, 3 nights on TV back in the '70s?) and this would make me more angry than satisfied.  I believe the copy that we purchased has long since been retired to the trash bin.  But each viewer must make up his/her mind as to whether this is better than nothing.

Let's just keep hoping that the holdout on this will finally think of us fans and let us enjoy this scary story in its full length and decently transferred to DVD.",1428537600,,1349,4.23828125

1203308,1,B00000F32F,"It's frustrating. AMAZON is such a great site. It's literally changed my shopping habits. BUT...every once in a while they let something like THIS sham, bootleg DVD slip through the cracks. It's not really Amazon's fault that it was listed. However, it becomes their fault if enough people alert them to items like this, and they don't ban the seller/product.

This is a poor quality transfer of the Universal VHS tape that came out about 20 years ago.

The original mini-series runs about four hours. Trust me. I've seen it. Recently. VERY recently.

Sure, the real VHS version of this made-for-TV adaptation of Thomas Tryon's novel is the best quality you're going to find, at the time of this writing. But, I guess I understand why, twenty years ago, they didn't release the entire, uncut movie. Let's hope that with all these amazing on-demand DVD releases (like Warner Archives, and Twilight Time Blu-Rays) that Universal, or whomever presently owns the rights, let's the fans of this terrific mini series buy the full-length, uncut, pristinely transferred version on whatever format.

But until then? Stay away from ANYONE on Amazon who sells the DVD of this title.
Trust me, it's. Bootleg, and you will not be satisfied.

In the movie that you sent to me there are vital parts that are cut out of the movie. For instance the part where Tamar tempts the womans husband and rolls around in the mud.  That part is cut out of your movie and there is no real understanding why the wife doesn't like Tamar.  Also there is no understanding why the husband avoids Tamars little daughter because the parts where the child plays finger string with him and the other part about the child screaming are cut out of your movie.  I know that there is a copy of the full version of this movie and I was hoping that you had it since your movie cost me $50.00 some dollars.

I bought the DVD that was sold on this site and it was such a poor quality that I could hardly see the picture. It's fuzzy and not clear at all. It looks like someone has made this from a VHS tape, and the transfer is awful.

1203549,3,B00000F32F,"I was a huge fan of this movie, had the entire movie on VHS years ago.
While the DVD gives you the basic plotline, there are a lot of sub plots and scenes that have been cut out or edited. This creates a choppy story line that in some ways makes the movie hard to follow. The entire ""Worthy Pettinger"" subplot for instance was taken out, making the burning of the scarecrows not make sense.
The quality is poor, very clearly a copy of a VHS tape. On my copy there is a weird color band at the top of the screen that can make Beths blond hair look green.
This movie is NOT worth the money they are asking for it. However, until such time as the entire movie is remastered and put on DVD it will be better than nothing.",1317772800,31,717,4.056338028169014

But, without a DVD version, I was contemplating getting a storemade VHS of this movie in the hopes of saving it to DVD and possibly finding lost scenes. I was just getting ready to order it when I read your warnings about the moving being chopped up. Apparently, they still don't get it. We buy factory versions of movies (DVD, VHS, etc) to obtain UNCUT versions of movies... NOT CUT-UP versions. They did the same to ""Hawaii"" on DVD... and the reviewers warned me on that one as well. I was fortunate to already have the full storebought VHS copy of that movie.

I do have a full copy of Dark Secret of Harvest Home on VHS which I personally copied off of the TV over 15 years ago and it still plays like new. (Sony hi-grades were the only VHS blank tapes worth buying. I have some which were taped as far back as 1984 and still play great. I also took the liberty of buying 200 blank sony VHS tapes and 4 new spare VHS machines when it looked like they were going to phase these out for good... so I'm prepared for any eventuality.

There is one scene in this movie I can remember seeing back when it first aired that creeped me out in a big way and still does for some odd reason - the main character, Nick, is standing out on his back porch late at night and he THINKS he sees this image of a couple dancing in a nearby cornfield.  It is a fertility dance of some sort but there was just something about that scene that was really creepy.  I think it's because you're not sure whether or not he is really seeing this or if he's just imagining it all.  That in itself is an eerie concept.

Bette Davis was truly creepy as the Widow Fortune and very young Rosanna Arquette does a passable job as the Constantine's spoiled asthmatic daughter.

With half of the plot gone it makes it very confusing and unenjoyable.

I don't understand all the negativity.  This movie is fine in the 2 hour release.  Take a look at the number of people buying it, and see the price at which it sellers.  In my opinion, there were somethings that could have been edited out anyway.  If you never saw the miniseries, you will never know what it was.

Unfortunately, the distributors cut the film to the point it is difficult to follow.  In the original movie, Worthy Pettinger, a young man hired by Nick Constantine to help around the house, introduces tractors and other modern equipment in an attempt to bring Cornwall Coombe into the 20th century.  Worthy's fate was one of the most horrifying aspects of the story, but it was cut.  Beth, Nick's wife, sides with the village against her husband primarily because the Widow Fortune, played by Bette Davis, saves her daughter's life after the doctor had given up on her.  This, too, was cut.  With so many critical elements eliminated, the shortened version makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.

Adding insult to injury, the scenes depicted on the front of the video sleeve, and one on the back, are scenes that have been cut from the shortened version.  Displaying scenes on the sleeve that do not appear in the video is certainly false advertising and borders on fraud.  I paid around $57.00 for this chop-job a few years' back.

Bette Davis is excellent, but then isn't she always great.  Rosanne Arquette was young, but gave a very good performance; So did the actors  who played Nick Constantine and Worthy Pettinger.  Worth producing on DVD with commentary by the author of the book, director and the living actors and actresses.  Ask them what it was like to work with Bette Davis.
The evil role Davis played in ""Harvest Home"" was as good as her performance on ""What Every Happened to Baby Jane?""
Everytime I travel to Maine I can picture the harvest home festival.  Makes you a little afraid of those New Englanders and the secrets they may hold.  If you liked Harvest Home you may also want to buy Dead and Buried with Jack Albertson and James Firorentino.  Another New England chiller, alot like something Stephen King would write.
