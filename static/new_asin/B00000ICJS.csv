8090209,3,B00000ICJS,"I started watching pro wrestling again a couple of years ago when I heard about a wrestler named Vampiro, who had a supernatural/vampire/Goth gimmick going. After watching him perform on WCW for the first time, I was hooked. I wanted to know more and as much as I could about this guy, but that ultimately led to me purchasing, and eventually viewing Guerrero De La Noche.  The movie was filmed in Mexico City, back when Vamp was wrestling on the Mexico circuit. He was and still is somewhat of a huge star down there, so I guess they felt he had to make a film. This movie is a complete disaster. The fact that it's in Spanish doesn't make things any easier, because even if it was in English, it still wouldn't make any sense! From what I can gather, some evil criminal mastermind (who's wearing a Laser Tag belt and has a magical gauntlet), decides to kidnap Vampiro and use him to do his bidding. His ally, one of the top female stars on the Mexico wrestling circuit (whose name escapes me at the moment), sets out to rescue him with the aid of....HER MAGICAL PSYCHIC PET CHUPACABRA!  Yes, this is where the real insanity begins. I only refer to it as a Chupacabra because it's the only way I can describe this midget in an Ewok Halloween costume. The special effects are awful, the editing is bad (Vampiro changes costumes and makeup 4 times in the course of 5 minutes), and from what I can recall, Vampiro's voice was actually dubbed over in this film! As for the wrestling (which is all taken from Mexican wrestling), Ultimo Dragon, King Haku, Black Magic (AKA Norman Smiley), Love Machine (Art Barr RIP), and Pierroth all have cameos in the  film. I can't in good faith recommend buying this unless you're a hardcore Vampiro fan. It's a great movie to watch if you're drunk and you need something to laugh at, but the artistic merit on this film is just out the window.",997056000,,1877,4.482456140350878
