2220187,4,B0007N19XM,"I think this movie was good for the family.  It's annoying how people try to pull apart a movie from their own narrow view.  For goodness sake don't disect movies, try to enjoy the movie as a regular human would!",1124236800,9,212,4.275
2220188,4,B0007N19XM,"I thought this film was very great, I picked a copy up from the store because of Joseph Mazzello, I already knew the film would be good because he was in it considering hes always starring in 4 or 5 star worthy films. The film had a great cast, there were many funny parts, especially at the beginning when Charles (Mazzello) is ""kidnapped"" by his grandfather and friend Chuck, the whole ride over is really funny and most of the comedy comes from the driver who was forced to drive them. The scenery was great and I would expect that considering the film was filmed at the location the movie is supposed to take place at, North Dakota. Many people compare the film to SecondHand Lions saying that it just copy'd the film but they fail to realize that SecondHand Lions actually came out AFTER this film, Wooly Boys was originally released in theaters for a limited release in 2001 but finally arived on DVD right now in 2005. SecondHand Lions came out in 2004, three years after Wooly Boys, so that really annoys me, SecondHand Lions was also a great film though. Pick up a copy, you probably won't be dissapointed.

The general plot outline is about a young man, in his late teens, Charles (Joseph Mazzello who stars in Jurassic Park and Simon Birch), Charles is all about the city and wouldn't have it any other way but when his grandfather gets tricked into going to the hospital to get a checkup on a sickness he has, his grandfathers friend, Chuck, comes to take him out, and after succeeding, take Charles along with them to there ranch out in North Dakota. Along the way, Charles finally realizes the beauty of nature and learns to have a great time, and in the end, becomes a 'wooly boy.'

The film is very heartwarming and in the end, turns into a sad, but funny tale that makes you want to go out and travel into the world of nature and adventure.",1123459200,17,1857,4.458823529411765
2220189,4,B0007N19XM,"This movie is great. The back description does not give it much credit. It is absolutely hilarious. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because a few scenes are rather corny and ridiculous. Other than that, it is one of the best movies I have seen in the last while. I would definitely recommend this movie. Watch and enjoy it with a laugh.
And by the way, if you watch it, pay attention at the end. The very last line will just crack you up. I won't ruin it for you partly because part of it might be a bit confusing without having seen seen the whole movie. Enjoy.",1118534400,6,573,4.125
2220190,2,B0007N19XM,"As an artist I see this movie as a simple sketch. A movie with undeveloped characters and script. The photography and color is beautiful and especially accurate of the western USA on the positive side. This movie appears to have taken snips of ideas from more sucessful movies, such as ""Secondhand Lions."" This could have been, as so many movies, a good movie because the actors and acting are top rate, but they didn't have much to work with. Wait until the price comes down. (If you think this is an inadequate review, you will now understand how this movie will make you feel.)",1114473600,4,580,4.586538461538462

Not that there is anything in it that younger children shouldn't see, I just don't think that they would understand some of it--it would be a little deep for them.

2220415,3,B0007N19XM,"Released to2001, ""Wooly Boys"" stars Peter Fonda and Kris Kristofferson as two aging sheep ranchers in the Badlands of North Dakota. After the former pays a visit to his daughter (Robin Dearden) in Minneapolis, he brings back his city-bred 16 year-old grandson (Joseph Mazzello). Keith Carradine plays a country sheriff, Rosanna DeSoto a ranch hand and Michael Booth an FBI agent. Jad Mager and Adam Logan are on hand as troublemakers while T. Mychael Rambo plays a hearse driver.

This dramedy focuses is on the conflict-habituated friendship of the two older ranchers and the visiting teen being a fish-out-water in the wilderness, which brings to mind 2003s Secondhand Lions. At around the 30-minute mark there are several laugh-out-loud scenes, which are less frequent throughout the rest of the movie. The lines of the idiotic FBI agent are the best. Beyond this, the cast and authentic North Dakota locations are great, but the movies mediocre about half the time. For instance, the kid responds to Kristoffersons character in one scene and its wholly unconvincing. A top-of-the-line movie would re-do the scene or ad lib; whatever it took to make it work. So its one of those part good/part meh movies, but I think the good makes it worthwhile, like the laughs, the birthing scene, the cast and the ND locations.

The film runs 99 minutes and was shot in Fryburg, Beach & Medora, North Dakota, and Minneapolis.

2220458,2,B0007N19XM,"Wooly Boys, 2001 film

The story begins with a flock of sheep on dry grass. Can a horse herd sheep? A man gets a medical treatment. [Are porcupines found in that area?] Two men plan to get cash but are surprised by Stony and leave. Later a Deputy talks to Stony and leaves with him. [A ""wooly boy"" refers to a sheepherder; they live in a small wagon.] Should Stony call his daughter in Minnesota? Will he buy a round trip ticket on the hound to see his daughter and grandson in Minneapolis? Yes. He is buzzed in to a large ultra-modern house. He wanders into a darkened room to talk to a young Charles. He visits his daughter Katy. This was to get him into a hospital for an examination. ""Happy Birthday, Dad!"" But Stony has an aneurysm and becomes a patient. Can he be freed? ""Holy Crap!"" A getaway in a hearse? ""North Dakota?"" Stony has an idea to get a suit of clothes, slightly used.

They stop for gas on the trip to North Dakota. Will dropping a cell phone destroy it? Back home two brothers try to steal Stony's sheep. Can they steal his horse too? What happens if Stony gets an attack while driving? The FBI is notified about crossing state lines with a dead body. When they return they learn about the missing horse and sheep. Where's the bathroom? Taking a bath in daytime? Charles sees the sights on the ranch. Stony talks about his health to Charles. [That knife looks too shiny to be very old.] One ewe is sick. Charles cleans his hands to work on the delivery by reaching inside to pull it out hooves first. ""I did it!"" He ties off the cord and puts iodine on the cut end. Kate gets the bad news and settles the deal. What happened to the horse? They locate it in a locked corral. Stony rides it away, then drives it away. Agent Collins is there to arrest them for transporting a cadaver across state lines. But the horse was hit!

Billy complains to the Sheriff. Agent Collins wants a convoy to the ranch. Stony has a wall of photographs. Charles must feed that lamb. The convoy arrives at Stony's place. ""Is everybody here insane?"" asks his daughter. Agent Collins will search at first light; he placed a tracker to follow the locals. But Charles takes it along. Stony falls off his horse. Can Charles ride to a higher ground for cell phone service? Can he send a message to distract his pursuers? Stony expires. [He died with his boots on.] They find the ""Hidden Springs"" (but little water).] Is that laptop computer ""product placement""? And so it ends. Charles will return in the summer.

This is a weird comedy set in a rural area. It is too serious for a comedy and too comic for a drama about life in a rural sheep raising country. But its worth watching once. The implausible events seem to be created for comedy. No mention about the legal problems created.",1382227200,,2780,4.402723735408561
2220459,4,B0007N19XM,"Even though he only lives about 600 miles from his estranged daughter and grandson, sheep rancher Stoney (Peter Fonda) is light years from their big city culture and attitudes, which becomes painfully apparent to him after a long bus ride to Minneapolis to visit them. When his daughter and local lawman (Keith Carradine) try to get Stoney needed medical help, hired hand Shuck (Kris Kristofferson) intervenes. An unlikely return trip via hearse to the badlands of North Dakota results. A couple of local yahoos intent on stealing Stoney's ranch so they can convert it into a resort and cavort with beautiful rich women are added for comic effect.
Fonda as Stoney is reminiscent of his role as distraught dad and beekeeper in Ulee's Gold but this time around he's even wiser, kinder, and gentler. He, Kristofferson, and Carradine all appear relaxed and enjoying themselves throughout this family trumps all tale. Maybe they prefer playing down to earth, genuine characters?",1378857600,,973,5.1257861635220126

Yes, it's a little slow, but the actors can't be beat, and for the baby boomer generation who really grew,and knew, that life style it was so fun.  It just peeled back layers of years from me.  Things I had forgotten we had done as kids and how much things have changed. Yes, it was great that his grandson experienced his life.  Nothing can compare to hands on experience, nothing!!!!! We depended on each other. There were no fancy computers, phones, headsets etc.  We knew the people around us, we knew our animals, we knew our enemies, and we knew our friends.",1209081600,4,710,4.566929133858268

2220494,4,B0007N19XM,a fun movie with enough of a serious thread to pull you in and keep your interest. Peter Fonda adds a touch of class to any project he gets in and Kris Kristofferson plays the kind of character he revels in. A little absurd at times with a light touch that never veers out of control. A good family film to share with everyone. We really enjoyed this one.,1201478400,,355,4.159420289855072

2220497,3,B0007N19XM,"I wanted to like this movie more than I actually did end up liking it. I don't mind the fact that it's formulaic (I bought it because I was expecting a typical family movie), but the characters just aren't well-developed enough. I liked the idea of Peter Fonda's character, but I think Fonda's execution was poor. He spends most of the movie acting like his character is not physically ill but rather psychologically ill. I got the impression that his ""Easy Rider"" character had grown older and drug-addled (since he spends much of the movie staring off into the distance or mumbling about his ""woolies"") and had settled down to become a sheep rancher. Add in the unnecessary, though not overabundant, profanity and I was doubly disappointed (mainly because this is supposed to be family fare).

The bottom line is that this movie could have been a lot better. Its redeeming quality is the fact that the teen boy does learn some life lessons and develop a relationship with his estranged grandfather. If you have nothing better to watch, then give it a shot, but don't expect too much.",1156982400,4,1085,4.7407407407407405

2220499,4,B0007N19XM,"Sort of a cross between ""Second Hand Lions"" (but better) and ""Thelma and Louise.""  Peter Fonda is an aging sheep-rancher who's dying.  He's not had contact with his daughter or grandson since his wife died in a tragic accident falling off a horse. He's tricked into coming into the city to check up on his daughter only to discover that they've set him up for a physical eval.  The doctors discover an aneurism.

Kristofferson shows up to liberate his boss from the hospital.  In the melee, Fonda's young grandson comes along for a wild ride that starts with stealing a hearse and ends with an FBI chase.

This is a great film, a lot of honest laughs, and a lot of hard tears.  Dakota, the sheepherding horse, was one of the funniest characters in the film.  ""Wooly Boys"" is definitely a film I would view more than once and I am contemplating adding it to my collection.

If you enjoy the old style Westerns with a lot of humor and heart, this is definitely a film you should consider watching.",1151107200,21,995,4.483333333333333

This movie is a fun movie that you don't have to think too hard about.  Sit back with some popcorn and enjoy enjoy with the whole family.",1137024000,4,457,4.524390243902439
2220502,5,B0007N19XM,"Originally I rented this movie with the intent to provide my husband with a movie that he'd probably enjoy watching. Something other than a ""chick flick.""

I wasn't expecting that I would enjoy this movie much but to my pleasant suprise, found myself thinking that this is a movie worthy to be in a dvd collection. I would consider this movie a cross between a comedy and drama (issues of life, death and relationships) but definately more on the side of comedy.

As for the comical aspects, I would think this type of comedy would appeal more to the down-to-earth individual, who has an understanding of and appreciation for this kind of life (rural) and the people within these types of communities.

As a side-note, I think this movie will also appeal to law enforcement. Particularly those who work in similiar, rural communities.

Definately a movie that I felt ""right at home"" watching. I, for one, wish there were movies out there- just like this one. Here's hoping for a Wooly Boys II! ;-)",1130889600,18,997,4.712643678160919
