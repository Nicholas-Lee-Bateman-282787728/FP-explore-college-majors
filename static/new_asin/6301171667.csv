7810535,5,6301171667,"Wow!!!!!  I had been looking this item for  about 13 years. I knew it existed but
had no luck locating it. I took a chance entering another search and to my joy
and surprise, there it was.  I will use it during the appropriate holiday at the
nursing home facility  where I am employed in the activity department.  I know
the resident/s will enjoy it tremendously.  Anyone that hasn't collected this to
add in with other Lawrence Welk program's should hunt it down also.  It is
apparently  very rare and hard to find.  Thrilled to find, very pleased with
product.",1366070400,,562,4.54
