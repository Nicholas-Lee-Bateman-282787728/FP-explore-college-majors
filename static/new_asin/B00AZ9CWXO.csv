8559505,3,B00AZ9CWXO,"I enjoyed this.  Connecting all episodes is the search to find out what Perfect Blue is.  Each episode, though, has its own mystery to solve.  Some of the plots were convoluted and there were a few times when we got repetitive scenes (e.g. a good person, pushed to the edged, has to be talked out of stabbing someone).  But, I have to say this was very watchable and maybe even addictive (I binged watched the last 6 episodes).

The reason I gave this 3 instead of 4 stars is the English subtitles.  They were okay for the first 10 episodes but absolutely horrible for the final one.  Don't quite understand how that happened.  I speak some Japanese, so it was okay for me, but if you don't, I'm really not sure if you can follow the last episode -- which is the most important one since it wraps everything up!",1422230400,,811,4.36
