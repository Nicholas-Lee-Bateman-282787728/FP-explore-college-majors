1648142,5,B00005QCY2,"Contrary to what some others say, I find Tracey's voice very quiet and soothing, and not at all monotone. Depressing? No way. This is a very basic tape that flows smoothly from one pose to another, and gives me a good stretch. For all those people who buy tapes that say ""beginner"" and then are disappointed that there isn't enough basic instruction, you might want to consider taking live classes to learn the poses. Having someone there to explain and correct in detail is invaluable. That's what I did and then I was able to go on to using various tapes as opposed to paying for several classes a week (too expensive). You have to realize there is no way that every video that says ""beginner"" on it can get into all the nuances of each pose. I still consider myself a beginner and I've been practicing yoga for about 7 years. At any rate, I've been using this video several times a week for nearly a year and haven't tired of it yet.",1093478400,2,936,4.385057471264368
1648143,5,B00005QCY2,"This is my second review of this program. I've had it for quite a while now and it's among my favorites in my collection (over 70 videos).
 I practice vinyasa style yoga (flow) every day, but there are some days when my energy level is low or I'm just not feeling 100 percent. This is the sort of day when I use this video.
 It give you the benefits of a vinyasa flow style yoga while still being gentle enough not to over tax you. It is very thorough in terms of it's sequence of postures and really puts your body through a very complete range of motion.
 Tracy and Ganga demonstrate the poses beautifully, and while it's true that Tracy uses a more monotone delivery, I actually find it works for this video because her voice never becomes a distraction by drawing attention to itself. I find this helps to enhance the meditative quality of this practice.
 I would recommend this video for intermediate and advanced practitioners as a gentle practice for those days when you just can't push too hard and also for beginners as an excellent introduction to vinyasa flow style yoga.

 Here is the layout of the sequence.

1648144,3,B00005QCY2,"Total Yoga, Earth is a flowing yoga practice led by two instructors, Tracey Rich and Ganga White.  Tracey provides voiceover instruction, while Ganga displays more advanced variations of all poses.
The workout begins with a 5 minute breathing practice followed by approximately 13 minutes of sun salutations.  Tracey introduces each salutation series, and although several different series are done for variation, by halfway through, I was getting bored.  Next was 6 minutes of standing poses performed first on one side, then on the other.  Another sun salutation series was used as a transition to the floor for 10 minutes of seated poses.  Following this was a 6 minute section of simple inversions performed against a wall for support.
The final section of this practice contained a 10-minute guided relaxation.  It begins with 2 minutes of instruction by Tracey; this is followed by 6 minutes of soft music during a photographic slide show (a little odd since your eyes are supposed to be closed).  Finally, there are two more minutes of instruction to end the practice, which I clocked at 50 minutes total.
Although many people seem to like this workout, I didn't find it to be particularly enjoyable.  Both Tracey's voice and the setting of a plain white room seemed antiseptic to me--I found the effect to be boring rather than soothing.  Furthermore, although I am an intermediate yoga practitioner, I found it difficult to follow along due to inadequate cuing; for this reason, I definitely would not recommend this video to beginners.  If you are looking for a calming, relaxing yoga practice, I would recommend either Crunch Candlelight Yoga or Kripalu Yoga, Gentle, both of which are excellent for beginners.",1075075200,3,1721,5.092526690391459
1648145,3,B00005QCY2,"Tracey Rich instructs in a monotone, very seriously. That said, her instruction  is sound and reasonably detailed, but I really just feel depressed after these tapes, despite the benefits of the yoga practice. Her flexibility is inspirational, but the tapes are not. I'd rather listen to Alan Finger (of yoga zone) or Brian Kest (either of whom are equally good instructors) any day.",1060214400,2,383,5.079365079365079
1648146,5,B00005QCY2,"This is an excellent yoga tape once you get into it...my first try was frustrating, because there is a lot of instruction on it, and I kept raising my head to see what I was supposed to do. Perhaps watching this through once before trying it would be a good idea. Because of the detailed directions, much can be learned from this, no matter what one's level of expertise is.
The poses are very simple, and it starts with the ujjai breathing method. There are approximately 40 minutes of exercise (you will need a flat, bare wall to place your legs up against for one portion), and then it ends with several minutes of repose in the ""corpse"" position, and though your eyes are supposed be closed for this, there are some magnificent still panoramic photos in this section by Wayne Williams.
Set in a clean studio with a sky backdrop, it's demonstrated by Ganga White, who was the innovator of this yoga method, and Tracey Rich, who does the narration as well. She is a slender woman of steel, with the flexibility of a rubber band...and is certainly an expert teacher.
You won't get any warmth and encouragement from this tape, it's very clinical, and to the point. I may not be ""fun"", but you'll feel great afterwards.
Other than the ""lotus"" sitting pose, which I'm unable to do because of knee problems, there is nothing in this tape to stress the body. It's a very low impact set of exercises, which will strengthen and stretch, and relax the body as well as the mind.",1036108800,17,1470,4.530075187969925
1648147,4,B00005QCY2,"This nicely done video is extremely basic and can be easily modified for almost anyone. It was not monotonous; however, I can see why some students would quickly want to move on to the next level.",1014681600,2,196,4.472222222222222
1648148,5,B00005QCY2,"I live in Chattanooga, TN and take a yoga class at The Sports Barn.  I have been actively participating since this summer and have really enjoyed the class and its benefits.  My yoga instructor, Margaret Green, gave me the ""Total Yoga - The Flow Series, Earth"" video to take home.  I really enjoyed the video.  The poses are shown in an easy to follow manner and are shown at multiple angles.  There are two instructors on the tape and I noticed each one does the poses a little different, which shows you a little variation that can exist for each person.  It was nice to see the poses from an outside view and compare them to the way I do them myself.  The series of poses shown was very thorough ending with a nice long version of the corpse pose.  The video itself was shot very nicely with great narration and scenery...very well done.  I truely enjoyed this video.",1012521600,4,870,4.421383647798742
1648149,5,B00005QCY2,"I have purchased many yoga videos in the past but the new Flow Series/Earth Video is perfectly instructed and easy to follow. It is refreshing to see a video that focuses on yoga without unecessary talking and distracting outdoor scenes. As it is instructive and beautiful, each time I use the tape (which is often)I enjoy it more.
Finally, I am now able to have excellent yoga instruction without having to leave home for expensive lessons which are beyond my budget.",1010188800,5,468,4.790123456790123
1648150,5,B00005QCY2,"I just finished this video, and I am in complete
bliss body state! Ganga White and Tracy Rich have
done a terrific job with this video. It's a solid,
thorough introduction to their vinyasa flow style,
with a very balanced selection of postures and
beautifully clear instruction.
Modifications are cued and demonstrated
throughout the session, and make the tape a
progressive practice suitable for both
mid/advanced beginners and more experienced
practitioners.
The tape begins with breathwork, teaching Ujayi
and 3-part breathing. This is done very well, and
thoroughly, from a seated position. Next, they
move to the vinyasa sequence, which teaches two
different Surya Namascara (sun salutation) series
as well as several standing postures, standing and
seated twists, and preliminary backbends and
inversions. The practice ends with a wonderful
relaxation in savasana (corpse pose).
Postures are taught using both traditional and
English naming, and is suitable for all but the
very newest of beginners. If you are a novice,
try watching it through once or twice first, and
pay attention to the modifications.
I have around 100 yoga videos, and this will be
one of my favorites. Now I can't wait to try the
other two in this series! All in all, a terrific
experience, and highly recommended.",1008374400,29,1293,5.221153846153846
7950373,5,B00005QCY2,Good for beginners.  The exercises are repetitive so you get practice doing each pose which is helpful for beginners.  Namaste.,1430784000,,127,5.3
7950374,5,B00005QCY2,"I've used this yoga series for a decade and it's a favorite.  Very calm instruction and I always feel wonderful after I'm done. The Earth dvd is very easy for beginners.  The practice is an hour, though, which can make it hard to fit into a busy day.",1398729600,,250,4.1875
7950375,5,B00005QCY2,"Great teachers, great filming and set, great voice, great image,  great workout! You won't be dissapointed at all. I promise you.",1354233600,,129,5.142857142857143
7950376,5,B00005QCY2,"Best for those with basic knowledge of yoga postures and terminology.  Ample, thorough guidance throughout.",1281052800,,107,6.133333333333334
7950377,4,B00005QCY2,"I got this Yoga video as part of a set of the three Flow Series videos and the original Total Yoga video.  This is the first one I've tried.
I was tired and frustrated and decided to try my new video to relax.  And let me tell you, it put me in a great mood.  It was quiet and relaxing, got my heart pumping a little, then stretched into relaxing poses for a great cool down.  I feel refreshed and ready to get on with my day.  It was a little lacking in variety of poses, so I'm glad I got a set of 4 different DVDs, but other than that it was great for me.
The workout starts out with breathing techniques that help relax you before starting.  After the breathing, you start with a basic, easy sun salutation with only downward dog, then you go into a slightly more difficult sun salutation series with lunges.  Then come standing poses including triangle and warrior 2, then relaxing stretching poses before savasna.
This is a great basic, relaxing video, but I wouldn't recommend this to someone who's never had a class with a live instructor before.  Some of the poses are easier with modifications that they don't show, and some of the bends and stretches are better if you know your limits before going into them too hard.  But if you've taken at least one class with an instructor and know the basic names and your limits, it's good for a relaxing work out.",1253404800,2,1365,4.34251968503937
7950378,3,B00005QCY2,"I basically agree with everything said in the other reviews, especially the comment about her use of Nameste.

The thing that really bugged me that I wanted to mention was the set. I must have misread one of other reviews.  I was expecting a tranquil outdoor setting.  Instead the two performers are on a wood floor with no mats in a sterile white room. The best way to describe it was something out of movie where you were trying to indicate someone died and went to heaven. I kept expecting Morgan Freeman to walk out.  The floor has a circular section of a light colored hardwood floor that is surrounded by a grey border and it seems to be suspended against a background of clouds... very unreal.  There are no walls until the end when they do the pose against the wall and then a white wall magically appears.  At the very end when you are suppose to be relaxing with your eyes closed they show all the beautiful outdoor scenes.

My only other complaint was that it seemed a little to dry and serious.  To put this comment into perspective, I'm a big fan of Sara Ivanhoe....she seems like she could be anyone's best friend and  I like it when she says things like ""klunk"" your foot forward.  If you're looking for something a little more clinical and haven't had much exposure to Yoga then you'll probably like this DVD.",1221436800,7,1325,4.460580912863071
7950379,5,B00005QCY2,"I'm trying to get back into a routine and this DVD is great for beginners or those that have not practiced for awhile. It's gentle enough to do everyday, and relaxing enough that it could even be practiced before bed to wind down. A great step to prepare yourself for the more intensive Total Yoga DVD, which I also highly recommend.",1167868800,,333,4.475409836065574
7950380,5,B00005QCY2,I was very glad to find it  and am happy with it.,1153094400,,49,3.0833333333333335
7950381,5,B00005QCY2,"Total Yoga Earth is an escape into a peaceful landscape where the focus is on your practice and conscious breathing, not the interior decorating. This has the feeling of being taken to a peaceful outdoor world in another place and time where relaxation occurs due to the release of body tension. Instructors Tracey Rich and Ganga White explore the benefits of asanas and sun salutations for healing benefits.

Through a series of postures, your stress melts into oblivion as you relax into a supreme relaxation. I was literally amazed at the stress reducing elements of this particular routine. The practice begins with conscious breathing and a 3-part breath session. There is a short time when you need to have your feet up against a wall, but most of the routine focuses on a traditional Hatha Vinyasa theme.

The 45-minute Practice includes:

Breathing
A Series
C Series
Triangle
Hero
Twist
Lying Boat
Backbends
Forward Bends
Spiral Twist
Inversions
Deep Relaxation

Due to the pacing of the exercises, this feels like an intermediate yoga workout. A blanket, pillow and yoga mat will enhance your experience. The deep relaxation session at the end is blissful. Nature scenes melt in and out of the screen at the end and the music pulls you away from any daily concerns. All you may want to do after this routine is sink into the deepest of sleep.

As a bonus, the Water Workout is included on this DVD.
