766130,4,6304053622,"This is a solid, if silly, B movie.  Yes, from a biological standpoint its absurd.  Sure, the plot is silly.  OK, the acting is indifferent.  If, as I do, you like creature features with oversized animals, in this case mosquitoes, and don't mind the things I mentioned above, go for it.  Don't expect to be impressed, but expect to be entertained.",1304208000,,347,4.622950819672131
766131,5,6304053622,This DVD is pretty wicked! But their are no special features.(Bummer). Even for a cheap killer bug flick. This is a good movie for fans that like the Carnosaur movies. If you like monster flicks or creature features this is the movie for you. And it is at a great price so you 2 can own this DVD.,1293235200,,296,4.120689655172414
766132,1,6304053622,"This movie sucks. I wanted to stop watching but I mostly fast forward it to see the mosquito parts but still wasn't much. This movie has alot of talking and boring as hell. I could say more but not even worth it. Watch Mosquito(1995) instead if you want action and gore, it's not bad for a low budget movie.",1286841600,,307,4.220338983050848
766133,1,6304053622,"If you are into bad B movies then Skeeter is among the benchmark movies you can use to rate all others. Use expressions like ""it ain't no skeeter"" when you find one worse. If you happen to be 14-16 years old and are using a VHS camcorder to make your first movie, you can learn a lot about what works and what doesn't. If your home movie turns out to be skeeter then you may just have a career in making trailers.",1265587200,,413,4.048780487804878

But the ""1994"" film ""Skeeter"" is just plain bad, without the redeeming quality of unintentional humor (the script is actually better in this film, but with the bad special effects it works against your enjoyment).  This time around, instead of the skeeters feasting on alien blood they end up being mutated because of a toxic waste dump.  Meanwhile, at our isolated desert town cattle showing up drained of all their blood through giant puncture wounds.  Then a pair of sex starved teenagers disappeared, followed by the people looking for the aforementioned teenagers.  The first people in town to spot the monsters are drunks, so they do not count and the locals have no clue until they are buzzed by mosquitoes the size of birds (""big"" is a relative term in monster movies, and since we are talking swarms of mosquitoes, this size works better).

The hero is Roy Boone (Jim Youngs), a strapping lad who likes to work with his shirt off, and the damsel in distress is his once and future girl friend Sarah Crosby (Tracy Griffith).  The local rich jerk Drake (Jay Robinson), is involved in land grabbing and his land has the toxic spill that leads to the mutated mosquitoes.  Charles Napier plays the corrupt local sheriff, and William Sanderson is the perplexed county examiner, and Michael J. Pollard's character keeps one of the skeeters as a pet.  All of your favorite conventions are here, the point of view shot from the perspective of the giant insects, the brutal deaths of the bad guys, and screams from the healthy lungs of the heroine.  It is just that ""Skeeter"" is not bad enough to be enough fun.  Do ""Skeeter"" as a late night double-bill with ""Mosquito"" and you will have to argee this is the lesser of two giant mosquitoes B-movies.",1056672000,5,2041,5.13595166163142

7859813,4,6304053622,"Apparently, toxic waste and mosquitoes don't mix, resulting in some very big bugs with an appetite to match.  People start dying and of course, it takes them awhile to figure out why.  As if that wasn't enough of a plot for this movie to deal with, there's also a rekindled romance between lawman Roy Boone (Jim Youngs, brother of actor John Savage) and Sarah Crosby (Tracy Griffith).  Adding to the confusion, the sheriff (Charles Napier) is corrupt and murderous.  There's an environmental inspector (William Sanderson) wandering around testing the water.  The town wacko is played by Michael J. Pollard (he's given to speak in rhyme and keeping skeeters for pets).  And there's an odious land grabber (Jay Robinson) lurking around seeking to kill anyone who gets in his way.

Unfortunately, the skeeter attacks are infrequent so the unnecessary padding with needless plot devices does begin to wear thin from time to time.
Still, it features rampaging skeeters!",1410652800,,964,5.101910828025478
7859814,3,6304053622,"While the acting is sometimes laughable, this is a b-movie  that can entertain. It has a fair story and moves at a good pace. It may not make sense why giant mosquitoes aren't seen more, but when they are it's entertaining. Keep your expectations low.",1401062400,,251,4.5777777777777775
7859815,5,6304053622,Giant Mosquitos (that looked bigger when I first saw it when I was little). Horrible Acting. Clich plot. A great B movie!,1392163200,,122,4.590909090909091
7859816,4,6304053622,"I saw this somewhat after Mosquito, and overall enjoyed both. However, Mansquito or Mosquito Man was the weirdest and least campy of all three. Jay Robinson has a very creepy voice that would make him one heck of a villain-and does very well in this) The actors in this are more well known, but a word of caution: if you fear these vampiric and annoying insects, you may want to steer clear of both or all three. I'm not afraid of them, I don't like 'em though ( who does, right?) I know they too serve a purpose, though I'm not always sure what, they seem to love me, well, my blood at least, making them very annoying to me.",1390694400,,626,4.225
7859817,1,6304053622,"DO NOT BUY OR WATCH THIS.....Im saying this because I want to save you from watching this piece of garbage. Now I love low-budget crap movies like Mega Pirhana, Sharknado, Thankskilling 1,3, but this is just not redeemable at all. Please don't watch it. Its not cheesey fun or funny at all.",1382832000,,290,4.596153846153846
7859818,4,6304053622,Solid monie with some really creepy creatures in the giant mosquitos. Acting is adequate and Tracie Griffin is superb. Special effects are awesome for that time.,1372377600,,161,5.230769230769231
7859819,3,6304053622,"A fun little movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.  I would have like to see more skeeters, but overall not a bad job.",1359763200,,126,4.25
7859820,3,6304053622,This is an OK movie for giant bug watchers. I collect movies like this and was glad to find it. I enjoyed it. It is a typical giant bug movie.,1356652800,,142,3.7666666666666666
7859821,2,6304053622,"In 1994 we were exposed to a film so magnificent, so hilarious, so B that it was almost hard to believe something so perfect existed. Now you may be thinking we're speaking of the world renowned&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Ring/dp/B00069QD74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Ring</a>, and we applaud your effort, but for the sake of this review we are focused on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mosquito/dp/B00000JN2O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mosquito</a>. This was a movie that simply dominated the charts of 90's B horror flicks. Never before were we exposed to a film devoted to giant killer mosquitos, which left us mesmerized. Honestly there aren't too many movies out there with such an incredible concept. Now fast forward to the year 2011 where much to our dismay come to discover another giant killer mosquito movie. One that was also released in 1994! Despite being very disappointed we had overlooked the movie for so many years, we decided it's always better later then never. Despite all our excitement Skeeter left us utterly shocked by it's lameness. The expectations were so high that possibly we ruined the film before it even had a chance. When standing next to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mosquito/dp/B00000JN2O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mosquito</a>&nbsp;this movie is more like an outcasted family member.

As the initial credits role we saw a lot of incredible B potential as workers hide tins of toxic waste deep below the ground. This moves ahead to us watching a young kid on a dirt bike getting chased down by some creature, forcing him to fly off the side of a mountain. In a consistent confusing manor  we then jump to a shirtless rogue cop named Roy Boone, as he rides his hog down the dusty desert highway with his button down wide opened. He is yet another gentlemen that attended the Dylan Mckay school of hard knocks. Once he arrives at work he takes some of the usual flack from the sheriff who doesn't like his independent attitude. From here we begin to discover some grizzly murders handed down by some giant mutant mosquitos. Obviously the mosquitos grew so giant while feeding off of the toxic waste dumping. In the end humanity remains the dominant species leaving us available to make more horrible movies, thankfully.

As much as we wanted to love Skeeter it simply wasn't possible. The downside wasn't the horrid acting or hilarious special effects...in fact that's what we seek. The real issue was the amount of boring dialogue that attempted to make this movie more of a drama then horror. It had everything needed. A rogue cop that doesn't play by anybody elses rules but his own, a crazy native american sidekick, the grumpy town sheriff, and killer mosquitos. Somehow they just couldn't figure out how to explore the studio space into a 5 star event. The mosquitos were seen for a total of 10 minutes tops, and that's just unacceptable. The beauty of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mosquito/dp/B00000JN2O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mosquito</a>&nbsp;was the amount of creature action. It dominated the film as opposed to Skeeter which forgot the killer mosquitos are the real stars. Really just a big disappointment that isn't worth the hour and a half of boredom with some sparse laughs. So when choosing between your 90's killer mosquito films make sure you go for the original masterpiece and leave Skeeter in the bug zapper.",1318032000,,3566,5.575645756457565
