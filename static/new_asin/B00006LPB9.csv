7972181,1,B00006LPB9,"I purchased this by mistake (didn't realize it was a Brentwood release). Needless to say, all 4 movies are crappy VHS transfers. As such they are all presented in 1.33:1 with the originals shot in 2.35. Even the opening credits are chopped off!!  All English dubbed with no optional original mandarin audio (I know some people love the cheesy dubbing but please give us the option of original and dubbed tracks!). Luckily I only payed a couple of bucks but still feel cheated.  It's like getting a one of those cheap pizza chain pizza's and after eyeing the single slice of pepperoni and several bits of cheese on a base severely lacking sauce thinking to yourself - Geez guys, I would actually pay more for a better quality product than this cheap crap. Definitely not worth the $12 bucks new.",1483056000,,794,4.664285714285715
7972182,3,B00006LPB9,"I purchased this for one movie. Needless to say although the quality was good the product was less than goo. However, I found another movie out of the 4 I actually liked.",1427500800,,170,4.34375
