4336888,5,B004EEZQ02,An accurate accounting of real events is refreshing.  This is a must see for anyone interested in organized crime.  Buy it.,1382659200,,123,4.809523809523809
4336889,1,B004EEZQ02,"I read other reviews of people who liked this movie. These people must be fans of mob movies no matter the quality. I've had trouble finding out if this was a fictional telling because as a person who read a few John Gotti bios, the book that Goodfellas was based on, Paul Castellano's bio and even Sammy the Bull's tell-all, I've never came across a heist where ALL the five families were involved or an all out street war involving the five families of the 70's either. You had the Gallo brothers vs the Columbos and the power struggle within the Bonnanos that made up any big warring of that period. If accuracies wasn't the filmmakers goal, let's talk execution of the making. Michael Nouri was excellent as Charlie ""Wagons"" and dominated the scenes with anyone else he was in them with with his commanding skills except when he was in a scene with Leo Rossi as Castellano who was also great. These two provided the only viable acting in the whole movie. The rest of the ""actors"" seemed to be a bunch of mob groupies playing make-believe as they pretend to be mafioso. The main problem is a story being told around an action taking place in a day. This leaves the filmmakers having to fill up minutes with ridiculous scenes that I'm guessing serves as to enlighten us to the lives an activities of mob life--something that Scorsese has already done to death so for a film that came out in 2010, I wish we was treated to a fresh and original look at an already tired out sub-genre as the Italian mafia film.",1365811200,2,1510,4.47463768115942
4336890,5,B004EEZQ02,i was very pleased with this movie it played very well and worked perfectly and i will order again soon.,1364169600,,104,4.25
4336891,2,B004EEZQ02,If you read the book this movie will be a disappointed. The acting was okay and it was low-budget. It seems like the movie created scenes that were not in the book. That's Hollywood.,1363478400,2,182,4.382352941176471
4336892,3,B004EEZQ02,It was a good story but just a small part of the book which was very well written. I would reccomend this movie to those who enjoy storys about the mob.,1348272000,,152,3.935483870967742
4336893,5,B004EEZQ02,"Danny Nucci is epic in his portrayal of John Gotti, this small film is well made and has a great cast. Joey lawrence also makes a great appearance as you;ve never seen him before. Must watch.",1332720000,,191,4.333333333333333
4336894,4,B004EEZQ02,"The fact that this movie show cased John Gotti's beginnings made it interesting to watch. The DVD was in good condition when it arrived. The acting was good, though I don't know why they did some of the stupid things they did in the movie, like locking an annoying guy in closet and sending another doofus upstairs to the whore room, but I guess guys do dumb things.",1310428800,,366,4.397058823529412
4336895,3,B004EEZQ02,"Yes, it is pretty good, like a low-budget Sopranos/Wiseguys/Goodfellas  style movie.  Because it is based on a great story.  Of course, some of the sets and hairstyles are low budget Hollywood. But we had fun watching it.  Danni Nuchi does some very good acting in this. Some of the wigs the actors wear are pretty funny. It's fine for a weeknight rental.",1308528000,,355,4.67741935483871
4336896,5,B004EEZQ02,"This is a very good movie! Danny nucci did very well as a young john gotti whose star is beginning to rise, the story line was okay and the soundtrack was pretty nice also, and ofcourse the acting was just right! but what do you expect when you put great actors together such as michael nouri, leo rossi and jason gedrick, all veterans of the mafia movie genre. I first saw danny nucci in mafia doctor he was good in that too!  I'm glad to see him coming into his own as a seasoned actor,and hope to see him in many more mafia titles.",1302566400,7,534,4.134615384615385
4336897,5,B004EEZQ02,"Former Gambino Sol ""Ubatz"" Polisi's tale of a job, involving a member from each of the 5 New York Cosa Nostra Familys! Most of the film revolves around a social club, ""the Sinatra Club"", which acts as the home-base for the crew, which includes members of each Family, the two names that will strike you and hook you are a young John Gotti and a wild and crazy Tommy ""Two Gun"" DeSimone...yes, Joe Pesci's character from ""Goodfellas""!! Told from Polisi's point of view, one is transported into the club 24 hrs before the heist of $500,000 of Silver Bullion!
Gotti, of course, is leading the crew, with the backing of Carmine Fatico, his capo and the blessing of Carlo Gambino, all to the aggravation of Big Paul Castellano. Personally, I enjoyed it, just wish that it would've been put out on a DVD, but fortunately Amazon is offering this new program which gives you access to almost any movie...FOR A PRICE. If you are in to Organized Crime/La Cosa Nostra
then you are going to want to see this, even at $15.99. Looks like a small budget
production, but the actors do a great job! (Jason Gedrick, Michael Nouri, Leo Rossi are just a few of the recognizable actors starring in this suprise feature!)
My only question is, how much is fact and how much came out of Crazy Solly's mind?
Either way, it was worth it just for the Tommy DeSimone parts, very interesting.",1299024000,5,1362,4.563265306122449
8426824,3,B004EEZQ02,Good production effort aching for a bigger budget. Danny Nucci has acting chops but this is not the vehicle.,1510272000,,108,4.7368421052631575
8426825,5,B004EEZQ02,Glad I found this movie to add to my gangster/mafia collection. Enjoyed it.,1474588800,,75,4.846153846153846

8426827,1,B004EEZQ02,Poor story telling.,1464825600,,19,5.666666666666667
8426828,3,B004EEZQ02,It's a pretty decent mob movie.,1462060800,,31,4.333333333333333

8426831,5,B004EEZQ02,Very very satisfied great service great movie thx much,1420329600,,54,5.111111111111111
8426832,2,B004EEZQ02,I rented the movie because I thought the book was good.  The movie was a disappointment.  The movie left a lot of background information out of the story which made it more difficult to follow.,1395273600,,193,4.485714285714286
8426833,4,B004EEZQ02,"Movie based on the book by the same name by Salvadore Polisi and his life as part of the Mafia before and during the Gotti years.  This film is a ""day in his life"" which outlines the very beginning of Gotti's rise in the organization.  I've seen better acting from Jason Gedrick who plays the part of Sal Polisi, but all in all an interesting story.  Screenplay has some major differences from the actual book which is of course, is a much more detailed life of the author.

Enjoyable for what it is and for those, like me who study the rise of organized crime in America.  I strongly suggest reading the book to get a more broader look.",1392076800,,637,4.319327731092437
