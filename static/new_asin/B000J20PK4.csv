8148753,5,B000J20PK4,"I didn't notice anywhere on the product saying it was PAL. But with it being an import, I'd just assumed as much. The only device it won't play on is a DVD player, but it plays without a problem on any other device (computer, XBOX 360, etc.). Great, classic Tom Waits. In case anyone is wondering, it's a copy of his feature on Austin City Limits. Video quality matches the time it was video taped, but the sound is crystal clear.",1272412800,,430,4.320987654320987
8148754,1,B000J20PK4,"Low quality, but good enough.  Only thing is, during a song a totally different song by a totally different band started playing right in the middle of one of Tom's songs. It happened three times during the same TW song, each maybe being 5 seconds long. It was like the DVD was recorded over something else.  IT REALLY SPOILS THIS DVD.

This was a RIP OFF.",1264118400,,356,4.363636363636363
8148755,1,B000J20PK4,"The vendors provided me my DVD lickety split, but the product itself is one of the lowest quality items I have ever purchased.  It would not play on a standard DVD player.  I could see it, but the screen ROLLED like an old fashioned B&W television with poor reception.  Once I played it on my PC, it didn't really get much better as what was finally clear looked like trash.  It appears someone took an old VHS tape and converted it to digital.

If you want your Tom Waits concert fix, this isn't going to get it.  Hold out hope for Storytellers or Big Time making it's way to DVD as this product will only disappoint.",1213228800,,618,4.2844827586206895
8148756,1,B000J20PK4,"First, I should say something nice: It's nice that this recordings are available. Anyway, only die die-hard Tom Waits fan should out any money into this: It's a VHA video that looks like it's been stored on some attic for too long, badly converted to DVD... It's too expensive for that...",1206748800,,288,4.666666666666667
8148757,1,B000J20PK4,"Junk. Would not play on a dvd/cd player or new computer. Some of it barely played on old computer. Music out of sink with movie. I was not asking for much and not expecting much but just got ripped off. Amazon, let alone Tom should not be linked with such garbage. Maybe I'll use it as a coaster.",1202860800,,296,4.120689655172414
8148758,1,B000J20PK4,This is just a bootleg of Tom Waits on Austin City Limits. When I ordered it from ImportCDS it was PAL and not NTSC. It's a waste of time and money.,1202515200,,148,3.806451612903226
8148759,1,B000J20PK4,Don't buy it!  This is in PAL format and won't play on any DVD player unless you are in Europe and did not play on computer either.  I just threw away money and this was to be a gift for a Tom Waits fan.  Very disappointed in seller and in Amazon for listing it as NTSC format - at least give fair warning to American buyers.,1201046400,,325,3.893939393939394
8148760,4,B000J20PK4,"This DVD is now available in NTSC Region 0 format. It looks like it's from a concert film from the 80's. A bit grainy, no real extras, but it's Tom doing what he does best, playing piano and guitar, smoking and winding through his stories with his gravel voice. Great stuff.",1187827200,,274,4.392156862745098
