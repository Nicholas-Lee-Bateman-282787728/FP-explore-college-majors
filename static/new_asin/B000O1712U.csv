8182610,2,B000O1712U,"This is a dry encyclopedic  history of the artists and their work.  While I prefer documentaries that  avoid speculation and interpretation, this series takes it to an extreme and the narration comes across as a stuffy school teacher reading from a textbook that focuses on the history of the artists more than art.  That is not good but would be ok if the videos were high definition.  The photography/cinematography is good but the video itself is not even wide screen (forget high definition) and the images degrade on a modern display.  So, while the depth of the coverage on the artists is impressive, the overall experience is old and dry.",1402617600,,645,4.818181818181818
8182611,4,B000O1712U,"While a tad dry, it does the job of telling the artist's life, showing the great art, and giving a fair bit of decent travelog. Bonus points: Not too much talking head stuff or corny historic reenacting. Excellent to prep for a trip to Italy.",1353974400,,242,4.4
8182612,5,B000O1712U,"This is an awesome set. It really goes into the lives of the artists, shows where they lived and grew up. My art history prof liked it so much, she bought a set! Great close-ups of some of the most beautiful pieces of art.",1233878400,8,222,4.068181818181818
8182613,2,B000O1712U,"The DVD did not meet my expectations; I thought the emphasis would be on the
importance of the artist's innovations and on the analysis of his works rather than on details of his life.",1209168000,8,184,4.4411764705882355
