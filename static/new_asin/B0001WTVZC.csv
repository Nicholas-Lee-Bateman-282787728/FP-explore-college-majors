2035825,3,B0001WTVZC,If you own the first Globetrekker about Paris then don't bother buying it - while they go to some different places in Paris and have another tour guide doing it - they mix in clips from the first Globetrekker Paris.  If you don't have the first Globetrekker Paris - then buy this one instead - it covers more area and has lots of information.,1204934400,13,342,4.34375
2035826,1,B0001WTVZC,"Several of my friends (who have been to Paris) have also seen this - it is so poorly produced, it's a complete waste of money.  Between it and the sequel, most of the footage is the same.  Why waste our time in a cookery class?  Guide is uninformative, spends her time arguing with a cab driver and partying with guests and hotel rep rather than showing us, um, er, PARIS.  If there was a 0, I would have awarded it.",1197763200,12,416,4.1625
2035827,1,B0001WTVZC,"Why?
This DVD is almost exactly the same as the first one.
Same argument with same boring taxi driver.
Re-hash; get the first one.
Yet even that is about as poorly filmed and boring as this second one.",1195171200,2,201,4.315789473684211
2035828,3,B0001WTVZC,"An interesting ride within the train that travels beneath the English channel on its way to Paris begins this film. You can buy a round trip ticket for as low as $125.
Once in the city I found the visit to the Paris underground subway system ""The Metro"" to be very interesting.
Several things I found unnecessary included a kitchen food preparation excersize at the Cordon Bleu, a visit to Paris Disneyland, a show at the nightclub The Lido and a visit to a African community in Paris.....while skipping a tour of the hillside district Montmartre is not even mentioned?
The film ends with almost an afterthought as we get to go inside and up the steps of the Eiffel Tower. This was very nice as you can almost reach out and touch the structural beams and practically smell the paint, but again, it was not enough. A short tour of The Louvre was okay, not really enough though. I agree with some other reviewers wishing someone else rather than Justine Shapiro had been the guide for this travelogue. And the people she meets along the way I didn't really care for except for the cabdriver who I thought was interesting. So overall I give this a rating of 3 stars. I would think there MUST be better guides out there",1179273600,4,1215,4.502262443438914
2035829,1,B0001WTVZC,"Rather than a DVD about Paris, this seems to be a DVD about an American woman in her 40s who likes to be filmed in her pyjamas, or wrapped in a towel, or chatting up men saying how cute they are.

Virtually nothing here on the sites of one of Europe's best cities.

Don't waste your money.",1161043200,15,289,4.052631578947368
2035830,4,B0001WTVZC,"I like Justine Shapiro and I was happy to see that she was doing this video.  I learned a few things from her.  I learned that Paris cab drivers are crooks who will take you all over town and inflate your fare, and they basically admit it by offering to negotiate the fee.  That's despicable and the town really should fix this problem.  I also learned that there is dog excrement all over the streets of Paris so you better watch your step.

I learned that they charge different prices for some items, depending on whether you are male or female, and depending on if you are smiling.  That's also sickening.  I don't plan to visit Paris.

There was nothing in this video that made me want to see this town.  Paris seems like an annoying place to be.",1154044800,5,750,4.338129496402877
2035831,3,B0001WTVZC,"This video is too short. It offers very little information before you make the trip, and it seems nothing after you come back from the trip.

Globe Trekker does a good job in general, but not this one.",1111881600,17,201,4.2894736842105265
2035832,3,B0001WTVZC,"Very brief. Some good scenery. Not enough on historic buildings/architecture. And I actually found the female guide  snotty and sometimes downright rude. I am surprised I feel that way,but she was pretty irritating. Kind of smug. If I was lucky enough to be visiting/describing Paris,I think I would be less irritating and much more delighted in what/who I was looking at.

I don't like hurting people's feelings,but I found myself actually talking back to the screen a few times in almost anger.

Could be just me,but different strokes and all.

I'm sure there must be a lot of Paris travel guides on DVD that are better than this one. I'll keep looking.",1110499200,26,655,4.821428571428571
2035856,5,B0001WTVZC,...and I love how Globe Trekker showcases this magnificent city! I'm French and very proud of the job that Adela and Justine did to capture the essence of this beautiful place!,1361491200,,176,4.709677419354839
2035857,3,B0001WTVZC,"The subject matter and areas in Germany are worth presenting, But if you're at all familiar with that country, it's clear the staff who prepared this travelogue fell short in doing the necessary prep work. For example: the Munich Oktoberfest is presented as a frathouse-like venue for consuming huge amounts of beer, German fast food, and offers a huge carnival. Having been there, I can say it's much, much more than that. It's the largest folk festival on the planet and is dripping with Bavarian culture, not just beer. It features an amazing parade, many people are proudly dressed in Bavarian folk costume; the beer tents are elaborately decorated; traditonal well-prepared Bavarian food is served on restaurant-quality plates; and there is a significant focus on historic re-enactment of the first Oktoberfest, the wedding reception for the prince and princess of Bavaria. The festival also draws many families and people of all ages. The many food-booths outside the beer tents are more fast-food like in quality. This is but one example--there are many other content errors throughout this piece which were frustrating to note.",1353715200,2,1135,5.2076502732240435
2035858,3,B0001WTVZC,"Paris is one of my favorite cities in the world. I originally purchased the 2004 Globe Trekker Paris DVD with Justine Shapiro. However, Justine's surly attitude ruined what should've been a majestic tour of the City of Lights. I was so disgusted that I literally threw it away.

I purchased this DVD. I figured that even if Justine started acting crazy, Adela would cancel her out. This DVD was rated G, meaning we were spared Justine's vulgar vernacular. In fact, a penis on a statue at the Louvre was blurred. This DVD began on Eurostar, which travels between London (check out Globe Trekker's Ultimate London DVD. It is the best episode of Globe Trekker) and Paris. The trip cost $100, which is much less expensive than Acela from NY to DC (London and Paris are roughly the same distance apart as NY and DC).

Many people have complained about Adela's accent, but I think it's sexy. However, a pet peeve I have is that they spoke in French quite a few times, but they didn't bother to translate it. Other reviewers have correctly pointed out that Justine's segments were recycled from the 1st Paris DVD, including her infamous argument with the taxi driver. Justine also rides the Paris Metro, which is a beautiful subway system. Musicians even play the violin in the Metro.

They stopped by Luxembourg Palace, which has a nice park. Adela then got a museum pass and went to this art museum (not the Louvre). The second half of the DVD was mostly filler crap. For example, Adela went to a store that sells stuffed animals. Justine went to a French cooking class (there are a myriad of French cooking classes in NYC). If they were going to waste time at a French cooking class, at least give the viewers a recipe. Adela even went to a fashion show. I bought this DVD to see Paris, not some anorexic models. I would rather Globe Trekker visit only a few specific destinations, but give in depth information about those destinations. I wish they would stop doing things in foreign cities that you can do in your local neighborhood, such as going to a bookstore or a Tai Chi class (like Megan McCormick did in Hong Kong).

I did like Adela's visit to the Palace of Versailles and the French prison. She also told a captivating story about the rise and fall of Marie Antoinette. Adela later stopped by a French pastry shop and got a dish that was basically a pancake with chocolate syrup. It looked delicious. The Louvre was featured towards the end, but I felt that segment was rushed.

Overall, I give this 2.5 stars. I added 0.5 stars because Adela is so cute (she's even in a hot tub, though you obviously don't get a full view of her sexy body). This was slightly better than the previous Globe Trekker Paris DVD, but this was a semi-disappointment. For a better guide to Paris, purchase Rick Steves or Sandrine Voillet.",1352592000,2,2823,4.593253968253968
2035859,2,B0001WTVZC,"Paris is one of my favorite cities. It's not quite as cool as London, but it's a beautiful city. Too bad the Globe Trekker host was a miserable sociopath. My first complaint was that there were no subtitles. I guess they assumed that everyone who watched this video speaks French. My second complaint was that part of the video was in a cooking class. Why? If I wanted to learn how to cook, I'd watch Rachael Ray. This video was supposed to be about famous attractions in Paris.

I initially liked the trip to the African market, as well as the interview with that guy from Ghana. However, Justine referred to something in the market as a snail penis. She obviously didn't care that young children with an interest in geography may be watching this. Later on, she tacitly referred to the dog excrement on the sidewalk. She even went as far as saying that a fountain looked like it was ejaculating. I was thinking to myself, what is this woman's problem? Justine also said that French people were snobs. Based on her interactions in this video, it seemed like people hated her as much as she hated them.

The Louvre is a nice museum. It's not quite as nice as the British Museum, but it's ornate. Eurodisney was ok, not great. There was a beautiful park that she rushed through. It seemed like Justine wasn't too enthusiastic about visiting Paris. I gave this DVD a 2 because it simply contained too many interesting sites to warrant a 1, but this video would've been so much better if Justine wasn't the host.",1349395200,2,1509,4.544117647058823
2035860,3,B0001WTVZC,"I watched this DVD after seeing ""Paris City of Lights"" on Amazon Instant Video.  This one is much better than that one, but I've since watched some Rick Steves videos which are better still.  This one is comparable to a Samantha Brown video, with two attractive female hosts instead of one, and with less of the corny humor.

This video uses wide screen format and has much higher quality video than ""Paris City of Lights.""  The newest parts were from around 2007, so it's also newer (although other reviewers here suggest that it re-uses some of Justine Shapiro's footage from an earlier production, which I haven't seen).  This video spends a little extra time in a few locations: a book shop, a cooking class, Marie Antoinette's cell, etc.

If you want lots of information and lots of views of Paris, I'd go with a Rick Steves video.  If you enjoy a lighter approach, you might check this one out (but I'd still recommend you check out some others, except don't waste any money on ""Paris City of Lights."")",1334361600,4,1008,4.629213483146067
2035861,2,B0001WTVZC,"I have visited many parts of Germany and I can tell you that this video is not a very good representation of Germans or life in Germany.  The video is very superficial and the two hosts obviously weren't very knowledgable about Germany which made it difficult to watch. It didn't teach you much about German history and won't help you much if you are planning to visit Germany as a tourist and want a video to help you with your planning.

I suggest passing on this one. If you want a good DVD on Germany, Rick Steves, Rudy Maxa, and Samantha Brown have all made much better quality DVDs about Germany.",1318723200,2,602,4.414414414414415
2035862,3,B0001WTVZC,"I am a French teacher and I really like showing Globe Trekker videos in class because of their holistic representation of the different countries, but Justine Shapiro is a poor guide.  My students always love the videos hosted by Ian Wright because of his upbeat attitude, but Justine's commentary comes across as negative.  She's often critical and pessimistic (""this dress looks like a tent; this one like a flight-attendant's costume"", ""of all the people in Paris why did I cook with so and so"" etc).  Paris is so breathtaking that it looks good despite her, but she doesn't add much.",1305849600,2,587,4.85
2035863,5,B0001WTVZC,I have been to Paris before and have seen 5 different DVDs and this is by far my favorite. It goes all over the city and gives a good overview of the places to visit. You'll still need a guide book but its a great dvd as an introduction to the city.,1228608000,6,249,3.8076923076923075
2035864,1,B0001WTVZC,"Justine has good energy but her commentary is thoughtless.  Didn't anyone write a script for her? She obviously doesn't realize that she is being negative throughout the video - taxi drivers will overcharge you, street and metro are dirty, fashion is ugly, people are rude.",1209600000,4,273,5.066666666666666
2035865,4,B0001WTVZC,"I love Paris, and I like Globe Trekker! give me a break, re: these reviews!
I think Justine is charming and does a good job on this trip. Remember she use to live in Paris, speaks French, and knows her way around. What I think a previous reviewer mistakes as arrogance is really confidence. Her confidence with the language, the food, and the people. Also it's only an hour program so every little thing about Paris can't be covered! Globe Trekker picks and chooses what they want; if you want a more
straight forward, comprehensive tape get Rick Steves. I think this is an
entertaining, fast paced look at parts of the city I love; PARIS...",1208649600,2,641,4.5344827586206895

8017329,2,B0001WTVZC,Poor quality picture. The back of the DVD says Original Soundtrack as an extra feature but its just the main title music for the DVD menu not the entire soundtrack for this episode which is misleading.,1477526400,,201,4.611111111111111
8017330,4,B0001WTVZC,"This was a great DVD for my High School French Class.  I wish they had cut out the nude art works all together.  I did not feel that Monet's ""Pic-nic"" was appropriate here.  Why did he paint a completely nude woman with well dressed men at a picnic?  I fast forwarded here and a few other places but this was kept to a minimum.  This kept me from giving 5 stars.  Otherwise, is is a great tour of Paris.  The focus was on the most positive side of Paris.",1443744000,,454,4.033707865168539

8017332,4,B0001WTVZC,"This episode featured my two least favorite Globe Trekkers, Megan McCormick and Justin Shapiro. However, I actually enjoyed this episode.

The episode began with Megan in Berlin. Berlin has come a long way from the days of the Cold War. It looks so nice and has a sleek skyline. However, in typical Megan McCormick fashion, she stayed at the most off-the-wall hotel called the Propeller Hotel. Meanwhile, Justine slept on hay in a farm in the countryside (seriously, can't these people stay at a Holiday Inn or Best Western like sane people?)

Back in Berlin, Megan rented a motorcycle (rather than ride the U-Bahn) and passed by the Bradenberg Gate and some other historical structures. She had lunch in a Turkish community called Kreuzberg (I had to look up the spelling. I really wish they would have the names of foreign towns on the screen). She enjoyed a delicious dish that was fries, sausage, and ketchup. Justine went to this nude beach in this remote town in northern Germany called Sylt. However, it was mostly older people. Justine was nude, but censored (not that I wanted to see middle age Justine's nude body- I wish it was Brianna Barnes or Adela Ucar).

Megan stopped by a replica of Checkpoint Charlie (the real one no longer exists), Hitler's bunker, and the Holocaust memorial. Megan, who is usually annoying, was at her best during this segment.

Justine took the ICE train from Sylt. That train looks so much nicer than Amtrak. Megan drove to Rothenberg. The scenery was picturesque. She stopped by a bakery. She later went to a parade in this German town called Dinkelsbul where she acted like a moron (what else is new?)

Justine went to Oktoberfest in Munich. In case you're unfamiliar, it's basically a festival full of booze, carnival rides, and all the food you can eat. In the last segment, Megan rode an aerial tram before visiting a castle. Germany is such an interesting country that even though two of my least favorite hosts were featured in the episode, I still enjoyed it.

This episode also has an bonus feature which is a Planet Food segment with Merilees Parker, who is a much more pleasant (and attractive) host than Megan and Justine. Merilees explored Germany, but with an epicurean focus. She went to several restaurants in Berlin and Frankfurt. She also went to some farms in the German countryside, which was beautiful. My favorite part of the segment was when she went to Oktoberfest. Merilees is one of my favorite Globe Trekker hosts. I hope she does a Planet Food Paris.",1411171200,,2519,4.779310344827586
8017333,3,B0001WTVZC,"It's an okay guide to Paris travel, but could use closed captioning or subtitles because the background sound and hurried speaking style of the host makes it difficult to catch everything being said, with background noises.  There isn't much else out there, so it is at least a basic travel guide.",1406764800,,297,4.823529411764706
8017334,1,B0001WTVZC,"Germany 2 is actually a compilation of the completely disappointing Germany 1, filmed several years earlier, and a bit of new footage with a new travel guide. The camera work and resolution of the disc is poor, and the whole package comes off as more of a ""what I did on my summer vacation"" than an informative piece on a place that viewers might be considering traveling to. This purchase was a complete waste of money and time.",1385078400,,429,4.512820512820513
8017335,1,B0001WTVZC,"Neither Justine Shapiro nor Meghan McCormick are terribly interested in exploring Germany, and it shows in this video.  Both are rather silly, vapid young girls who need to grow out of adolescence before they start conducting travel tours!

8017336,1,B0001WTVZC,"I agree with most of the comments here who complain about a sad 40-something American woman wanting to do ""her own thing"". It doesn't work here. Why does she interview a bunch of other Americans when touring Paris? Couldn't she interact with some LOCAL FRENCH PEOPLE? Oh, and forget about going inside the Louvre, Napoleon's tomb, or the Bastille. Instead we get to tour the African neighborhoods of Paris! REALLY???",1377388800,2,416,4.957142857142857
