2113510,5,B0002PYS60,"The Christmas episodes are always the best. . .

I have the other DVD of Christmas episodes of The Simpsons, and I love it!  The Christmas episodes are the only ones I want to own on DVD, but it is nice having the other winter-themed episodes on the DVD along with the holiday episodes.  I'm glad I don't have to spend $40 on a whole season of The Simpsons just for the one Christmas episode I want.  I wish more tv shows had Christmas-only DVDs available.",1095638400,5,456,4.267441860465116

2113512,5,B0002PYS60,This is yet another scam by fox to make more money but if your a big fan you should buy it. It has 4 episodes and some of them are not yet realeased on the season DVDs which might be worth buying. It will most likly be like the other small simpsons DVDs. So go buy it when it realeases.,1093305600,4,286,3.783333333333333
2113513,1,B0002PYS60,"Show of hands, how many people want fox to keep churning out these random, pointless, and nauseating so called collections of Simpsons episodes.  I am a DIE-HARD Simpsons fan and I have every other season and watch them religiously.  However I can't see the logic that Fox is using when cranking these out.  They already know that we are going to buy the seasons when they come out, but most, if not all, of us want ONLY the seasons.  Now I could see these if they had as many episodes as one of the season dvd's but these are usually only a few and barely enough to even wet the appetite of any Simpson fan.  If anything, all Fox is doing is Ticking off a lot of people.  Personally I don't see why It is taking so long to churn out these season collections.  Look at the Twilight Zone collections that just came out.  They have already released 5 sets of them and they were released at once.  Come on Fox if they can take films that old and get them on DVD that quick SO CAN YOU!!!

NOTE TO FOX-HURRY UP WITH THE SEASONS.",1092787200,7,1023,4.2
2113514,2,B0002PYS60,"I sure hope they change the name of the disc, because 'Christmas 2' just doesn't sound interesting.

Anyway, once again, this is FOX's attempt to suck more money from Simpsons fans while they're waiting for the box sets to release. Also, only two of the four episodes on the set are Christmas episode. So with that, this set's stars deplete. But, these episodes aren't as bad as the ones picked for ""Simpsons Gone Wild,"" so, I'll cut it some slack and give it two stars. The episodes? Well, break it down:

Homer vs. Dignity (Season 12):

Kwik Synopsis: In money troubles, once again, Homer becomes Mr. Burns' ""prank monkey"" to get some extra cash.

This episode is pretty bad. The plot alone is pretty farfetched and, while Burns provides a few laughs, wasn't that funny. There was a ""sub-plot"" about Smithers acting in a Malibu Stacey-themed musical. THAT would have been great to see more than a one-minute scene of. But instead, we have Homer get raped by a panda. You heard me. A panda has his way with him. I wish I was making this up, but I'm not. I guess this episode was picked because the Thanksgiving Day parade at the end had the Santa float, in which Burns throws fish guts at everyone. But still, ""Marge Be Not Proud"" was an amazing Xmas episode. Why isn't that on this disc?

Skinner's Sense of Snow (Season 12)

Kwik Synopsis: The kids are snowed in the school right before winter break, and they turn on Skinner.

Probably the best episode of the disc. There's a lot of good jokes in this episode, although it takes a hit when Homer comes in. He takes a hunk out of Ned's roof to make a snow plow. The two drive to rescue the kids, but hit an fire hydrant, and the water freezes up instantly, and Homer hallucinates about exotic dancers and... it was all just really weird. But it was still a good Xmas episode. Good work everyone.

'Tis the Fifteenth Season (Season 15)

Kwik Synopsis: Homer tries to do good this Xmas, and ends up competing with Flanders as the nice guy.

A nice Xmas episode. There is a lot of funny stuff in this episode, but it's sort of pointless, as you know Homer will go back to being his lazy selfish self in the next episode.

Dude, Where's My Ranch? (Season 14)

Kwik Synopsis: The family goes to a dude ranch to escape a song Homer wrote that was playing ad nauseum on the radio. There, Lisa falls in love with a teenager.

Atrocious. The first act was alright. But once they got to the ranch, the humor crashlanded. Lisa is in love with someone 5 years older than her, then ends up endangering his sister's life thinking she's his girlfriend. Have we forgotten that she's 8? Out-of-character, much? Yes! And Homer and Bart try to stop some beavers from building a dam, I dunno. Completely unusual and crazy and bad episode. And what exactly does this have to do with Christmas?

This will most likely have a featurette, but I don't know what character it'll be on.

All and all, you've got two good episode, an OK episode, and a bad episode. So altogether, you have an average set of episodes, roughly a 2 1/2 stars. But you can't do halves, but it wouldn't matter, because it loses it with the complete pointlessness of this set's production. Only for an completist Simpsons fan.",1091923200,23,3228,4.484641638225256
2113515,4,B0002PYS60,"I am really exited for this DVD of ""The Simpsons!"" All of the episodes are pure gold! ""Homer vs. Dignity"" is a good episode, but probably the worst of the four episodes on the DVD. In, ""Skinner's Sense of Snow"", A group of kids get trapped in the school the last day before winter break, Homer and Ned set off to recue them. "" 'Tis the Fifetenth Season"" is probably the second best epidoe on the DVD. In it, Homer becomes caring and loving, and becomes the new ""Ned Flanders"" of the town. This of course really irks Ned. Finally, it includes my favorite episode, ""Dude, Where's my Ranch?"" where Homer writes a hate-carol to Ned. The carol becomes a huge hit. Despritly wanting to escape it, the family goes to the ""Lazy-Eye-Ranch"", where Homer starts a war with the beavers who live at a near by lake, and Lisa falls for a 13-year old boy.

 In conclusion, this DVD is a must own for any fan of ""The Simpsons"".",1091491200,3,910,4.347058823529411

2113582,4,B0002PYS60,"The Simpsons--Christmas 2 has four Christmastime episodes despite the fact that not all of these four episodes focuses on Christmas. However, the episodes are well thought out and funny with the exception of ""Dude, Where's My Ranch"" which has cute moments in the latter (and longer) part of the episode only after the real laughs are over. The quality of the print is very good and the sound is fine, too. The plots move along very well and they will entertain fans of The Simpsons as well as newcomers. You don't need to know too much background information about the characters to enjoy these four episodes; and that's a definite plus. The characters are nicely developed in an incredibly short period of time for the maximum amount of humor and action.

Here is an outline of the four episodes; and no, I won't spoil it for you!

""Homer vs. Dignity:"" The Simpsons become financially destitute--to the point where a financial counselor tells them they may have to declare bankruptcy--several times. Desperate to raise much needed cash (he even sold the back seat of the car for money), Homer takes advantage of Smithers' vacation time to do increasingly humiliating acts for the money he and his family have to have. How far will Homer go to satisfy Mr. Burns? Will Homer ever draw the line or does something else happen that makes Homer's stunts for Mr. Burns go bad? And, how does this story line tie into Christmas? Watch and find out!

""Skinner's Sense of Snow:"" Watch for a hilarious spoof of Cirque de Soleil when it comes to Springfield! It's not soon after that an incredible blizzard snows the kids into Springfield Elementary. How do Skinner and the kids get along--or will there be a tug-of-war between them? Homer and Ned Flanders set out to rescue the kids, but their car is stuck in the snow and ice so it looks hopeless. What happens to Nibbles the hamster? This episode has practically nothing to do with Christmas except for the very end where Lisa wishes the audience a Merry Christmas--what gives? It's good; but not tied into the holiday theme here.

""Dude, Where's My Ranch:"" When The Simpsons go Christmas caroling, things don't exactly go as planned. However, Homer writes a new Christmas carol--and it gets noticed! However, what happens when the song gets produced? The answer may surprise you. When the family later on goes to a dude ranch, Lisa falls in love with young Luke Stetson. Will he return her love? What happens when Lisa overhears the boy talking on the phone with Clara--could there be a rival for the boy's affections? The laughs come mostly before Homer and his family gets to the ranch and it's not a bad episode; but it's also not much of a Christmas episode. Sigh. Watch and find out!

""`Tis the Fifteenth Season:"" We see The Simpsons hanging out their holiday lights; and then the holiday season gets underway for real when Mr. Burns' nuclear power plant has ""secret Santa."" Homer gets a bad reputation fast for being selfish and spending his $500 bonus on a fancy present for himself--but what happens when he watches ""Mr. McGrew's Christmas Carol?"" Homer gets remarkably generous and kind--will he be able to keep it up? Will Flanders be pushed out of the spotlight and what might happen if Flanders IS outdone by Homer? There's plenty more action to this one; so watch and find out!

There's also a bonus feature complete with storyboards from ""`Tis The Fifteenth Season."" It's good for people who want to have a taste test of how these animated episodes are produced.

Overall, The Simpsons--Christmas 2 is very good; but I can't give it five stars because these four episodes don't always tie very well into the Christmas holiday. While I still recommend this for newcomers to The Simpsons and Simpsons fans who don't already have these episodes, please remember that not all of this material is as holiday oriented as the title would have you believe.",1246665600,4,3904,4.766272189349112
2113583,5,B0002PYS60,"This is the DVD's other TV shows should release. Some of us love the Christmas episodes of our favorite TV shows & to be able to put in a DVD & see most or all of them is so much better than going thru a box set & changing disc's for every episode.

2113585,2,B0002PYS60,"Wow, how would you like to own a DVD of 4 Simpsons Xmas episodes? Even though half of said episodes are utterly NON-Xmas. Even the title of this DVD is wrong as the first was called Christmas with the Simpsons.

Included on this DVD is Homer vs. Dignity, Skinner's Sense of Snow, Dude Where's My Ranch? and 'Tis the 15th Season. None of these are from the old seasons, so they are all new to DVD. But their not from the best years either. They're the cynical, classless episodes from recent seasons.

Yes, they are funny. But the laughs are incredibly cheap and their targets too easy to hit. For the price, it's hard to argue NOT getting for a single watch on Xmas eve (despite the fact only 2 episodes are about Xmas), but for misers I'd wait for the full complete box sets of these later seasons. Crap as they may be.

The DVD presents all shows in 1.33:1 fullscreen, as drawn with Dolby 2.0 surround. One brief extra, an animatic, is included.",1100304000,6,947,4.4

2113587,4,B0002PYS60,"For my part, I'm a little puzzled at the people who rail against Fox for releasing this kind of themed compilation. Speaking as both a die-hard Simpsons fan and the father of two small kids, I'm pleased as punch that these compilations are out there, because I flat out don't have the money to buy all the complete season box-sets. Rather than accusing Fox of being greedy (let's grow up people, they're a for-profit business whose purpose it to make money), I think they actually deserve some credit for realising that there are customers looking for smaller portions to feed our habit and hopefully get some of our favorite episodes. And, hey, if I don't like the episodes they put on a particular set, the wonderful thing is that I have the choice to say, no I'm not going to buy this. Maybe it is the greatest TV show ever, but it is still just a TV show, and a little perspective never hurt anyone (except maybe that Tron-like computer-ish perspective Homer got in that one Treehouse of Horror segment, that is).",1097452800,42,1017,4.593406593406593
