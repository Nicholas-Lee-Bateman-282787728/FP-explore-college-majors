7077141,5,B00V7ORUUG," Gundam is amazing. Despite being released in Japan in the 90's, we can finally see it in an official release, which is nothing short of a miracle.

Fun facts about Turn A Gundam:

- Gundam was the last Gundam story animated on cels before Sunrise began using digital animation in Gundam Seed.

-Character designs are by Akira ""Akiman"" Yasuda (Street Fighter III, Darkstalkers, Power Stone, Plasma Sword, etc...)!

-Mechanical design is by American futurist concept artist, Sid Mead (Blade Runner)!!

-Turn A could defeat literally any other Gundam. Two words: Moonlight Butterfly. (Don't look that up. MAJOR SPOILERS).

-Soundtrack by Yoko Kanno. Soundtrack by Yoko Kanno. SOUNDTRACK BY YOKO KANNO!!!

**Don't listen to the 1-star reviewer. As much as I'd love to see a dub, a set of premium, official subs from Nozomi Entertainment will be infinitesimally better than any of the 'wooden' and hard to follow dialogue found in the various fansubs out there. (God bless fansubbers for trying, of course)**",1430265600,35,1004,5.154320987654321
7077142,5,B00V7ORUUG,"Have it pre-ordered it's been years since Gundam has been in the us and if it dose well they may redistribute Gundam, 00, Wing, Zeta, and others that have been dubbed. They have also said they may start doing Blu-ray later on as well but even in japan it's so expensive to get a Blu-ray gundam disc.",1429660800,11,299,4.2631578947368425
7077143,5,B00V7ORUUG,"One reviewer gave a star for a pre-order item that is not released.

Dis-regard that foolishness. This story is phenomenal and we are lucky to even receive this. I'm paying my $$ for it. Although, I do wish they dubbed it :(",1429488000,8,224,4.333333333333333
7077144,1,B00V7ORUUG,"70 Dollars (35 each box set) with no English dub = Rip Off.

Just watch it on YouTube with fan subs.

If Sunrise ever dubs this with English then they can have my cash.",1428969600,10,168,3.911764705882353
7077152,5,B00V7ORUUG,"The beautiful thing about this anime is how universal it is, honoring the universal quantifier in its very title. It's a non-traditional Gundam show apt for newcomers and for veterans alike. Veterans will love how refreshing and quaint it is, compared to previous entries, while newcomers will love the beautiful world and characters woven in its very pleasant and wonderful story. Veterans may feel very uneasy with the weird mech designs, but I feel they solidify Turn A's uniqueness and charm among the general Gundam metaseries. The Turn A itself is indeed very ""out there"" as a mech design but not in a bad way, and I have come to love it as it represents the love I have for this series. But more important than the mecha designs is the story, the pacing and its characters, and at that Turn A succeeds in ways that sometimes even surpass the original Gundam. To be able to physically own this show is a blessing in the same way we anime fans can also own other classics like the Rose of Versailles.

In a way, I compare this show with Evangelion for a number of reasons: both are from the 90's, both are groundbreaking works (Eva for the mecha genre, Turn A for the Gundam series), both feature very unique mecha design and lastly because both contain fantastic character relationships and explorations that make them utterly unforgettable.",1444089600,,1347,4.731914893617021
7077153,4,B00V7ORUUG,"Well, I'm an anime fan and have always loved the the Gundam series and all their variations. I'm also glad that many of these series are finally being brought over the U.S., including Turn A.

Unlike most of the modern Gundam series, the story telling in Turn A can be a little discombobulated at times and makes little sense. There are other times where many of the storytelling feels rushed and that doesn't change much throughout this first set. However, the animation stays very consistent throughout the series. As a person who has seen the entire series I can say that the coherence of the show does get better.

The only real downside to this series is that it's on DVD only and not available via Bluray. It also lacks any extras or English dubbing.

On that note, if you're a fan of classic animation, robot battles, and of the Gundam series then I strongly recommend Turn A.",1443916800,,883,4.575949367088608
7077154,5,B00V7ORUUG,"Great show, well worth the money :D",1443139200,,35,4.142857142857143
7077155,5,B00V7ORUUG,Right stuff did a bang up job on this release. The transfer is nice and the subs are great. I don't see why people are complaining about this release not having a dub when rightstuff announced this they specifically said it would be sub only. Although it probably doesn't help amazon had a dub listed in the description. As far as story goes this is one of my favorite Gundam  series  I won't spoil anything but the majority of it takes place on earth and has a totally different vibe compared to any other Gundam series.,1442620800,,521,4.416666666666667

7077158,5,B00V7ORUUG,"I originally considered waiting to buy this series until some company dubbed it now I'm glad I went ahead and bought it. This series contains two crucial element that are missing from many anime series: a plot and good characters. The setting for the series is probably the most unique and interesting of all the Gundam series, which adds to the story a good bit. Its characters unlike the Gundam seed series do more than just yell and babble about how bad war is they experience it and we care about them as a result. 5 stars.",1438041600,,527,4.443298969072165
7077159,5,B00V7ORUUG,"As a gundam fan of many, many, years I have seen almost every gundam series. From the original mobile Suit Gundam series to the more recent Gundam Unicorn series. And I must say that this is by far one of the best series I have seen in a good while. The story is unique, and the character development is solid and flows nicely. The music score is perfectly done and gets you into the ""moment"". As far as the animation goes its top notch, really a last of a breed, as it was done in 1999 before the newer 3-D animation done in series like Seed or 00 and Unicorn.
This has been a hidden gem for me in terms of how good this series is. I only have three series left before I have seen and own every major gundam series. And I look forward to seeing hopefully more hidden jems like this one. Even though it doesn't have an English dub its not worth overlooking as it does have English subtitles. It's more then worth a look or two, highly recommended.",1436227200,,947,4.180327868852459
7077160,4,B00V7ORUUG,"While the pacing is a little slow, Turn A Gundam is a must have for any mech anime lover. The DVDs look and sound great. Only wish it had a blu ray.",1435881600,,148,3.65625
7077161,5,B00V7ORUUG,It was good eventhough gundam  being in sub titles  other than that it brought back memories staying up all the way to 1in the morning watching toonami watching older mobile suit gundam shows . I suggest you buy this if you love gundam,1435536000,2,235,4.441860465116279

7077163,3,B00V7ORUUG,It's cool that I have this now....but there is no English dub which is NOT what the product details claim.,1434153600,3,106,4.35
7077164,4,B00V7ORUUG,"While I'm excited to have an official USA release of Turn A Gundam to replace my inaccurately subbed Malaysian copy I am still a little let down. The subtitles are the horrid yellow blocky color and with no English dub I am stuck looking at them. I know some don't care about a dub but it would definitely been a plus to own this set. The box is well done. It should fit nicely next to all my other Gundam series. Some are complaining about the series being split between a part one and two but a majority of other Gundam releases are the same. The picture looks good even on my 65"" tv. It is an older show so it is in the 4 by 3 format. Sound quality is as expected as well. Hopefully in the future if rightstuf and sunrise continue to release Gundam series we can get some official dubs.",1433894400,2,789,4.12987012987013
7077165,5,B00V7ORUUG,"Thank god this is finely officially available. Who cares if it doesn't have an English dub, it's Turn A Gundam!

Can't wait for Part 2 and hopefully more official U.S Gundam releases (Pray for After War Gundam X).",1433894400,,213,4.605263157894737
7077166,3,B00V7ORUUG,"Awesome show, but it is NOT dubbed in English. Amazon has it misrepresented it with English Audio",1433721600,3,97,4.764705882352941
7077167,3,B00V7ORUUG,"As a series Turn-A is pretty awesome, the designs are inventive and the plot allows for greater emotional connection as the consequences of war are not only show in a more intimate way but also repeatedly referenced through legitimate narrative. For those of you who don't care for subtitles, continue ignoring this release as it comes with Japanese audio and English subtitles only. I don't personally mind this as anime company's more often than not use substandard english voice talent, but I know this will ruffle the feathers of some. What I do mind are the visuals, don't get me wrong the art in each episode is crisp and clear, the trouble is that clarity is lost whenever the images begin to move. Simply put Turn-A is plagued by scan lines that make things momentarily blurry. Nonetheless it's nice to have a Gundam series release that isn't $35-$50 for four episodes or one hours worth of content, here's hoping this is the beginning of Bandai/Sunrise tailoring their business practices to western buyers.",1433635200,3,1015,4.906976744186046
7077168,5,B00V7ORUUG,"This show is really darn good. 25 episode in Part 1 and I think it's the perfect amount for this collection. The only audio is Japanese and there are English subtitles. The music is great too.

The story is very interesting, especially among the throngs of Gundam shows.",1433462400,2,270,4.625
7077169,4,B00V7ORUUG,One of my favorite Gundam series has finally made it overseas. The packaging is beautiful. The only thing I am upset about is that these are not the blu-ray versions which are out in Japan. Have to knock down star.,1433462400,,214,4.375
7077170,5,B00V7ORUUG,"I'm so glad that we finally got Turn A over here as an official release!
After the whole debacle with Bandai pulling out just before they said they were going to officially release this series over here I never thought we'd see Turn A stateside. Fortunately Sunrise still has some faith in us and has decided to take matters into their own hands and bring some releases over here after years of a Gundam drought. I really hope this, Origin, and the planned re-release of 0079 sell well so we can keep getting more Gundam!",1433462400,3,521,4.494736842105263
7077171,5,B00V7ORUUG,"The subtitles actually match the dialogue spoken in this ""True"" release of the tale of the Mustache Gundam. Also don't expect to find the English voice actors of the characters as this going to be Japanese with subtitles and this is going to be the best we can get for the NA releases of older Gundam series that weren't released in the past running of releases. This Gundam series is not for the weak-minded as it can be a mental roller coaster for some and this is just the 1st half. If you can make it to the 2nd half ,when it releases, you will see the true face of the 1st half. Discover the MS that can becomes more powerful as the pilot finds out what the the MS is really capable of doing as he uses it more.",1433376000,2,716,4.121428571428571
7077179,1,B00V7ORUUG,I'm giving this thing 1 star because it's only got a Japanese voice track in spite of the fact that in the product description it says English dubbed. I ended up returning this thing within 24 hours of finding out it was released without an English langue option.,1433289600,7,263,4.5
7077180,1,B00V7ORUUG,"While this show has a great story and great music, the lack of dubbing feels like they only did half the work for a localized release. As I'm one of those people who enjoys watching movies while painting models, subtitled only doesn't do anything for me. I'm tempted to return it.",1433289600,7,280,4.509803921568627
7077181,2,B00V7ORUUG,"Buyer beware, although this item was listed as being ""dubbed in English"" when I ordered it, there is NO English dub on the disc. It is Japanese audio with subtitles ONLY.

Before you order this item, please take note of this fact. I was disappointed with this item because I was expecting an official dub, but ended up having to read subtitles. Do not order if you don't like Japanese audio.",1433289600,7,391,4.507042253521127
7077182,5,B00V7ORUUG,"This is worth the money for a dvd collection, should of been in blu ray. They are currently working for a dub version of Reconstigua  in G (typo) and the Origin part 2 in blu ray",1433203200,,178,3.9444444444444446
7077183,5,B00V7ORUUG,The video and sound quality is great. I have only watched one episode so far but the translation for the subtitles is spot on. This is something every North American Mobile Suit Gundam fan should own. I hope one day we receive a blu ray release over here. Please support Mobile Suit Gundam so we are not forgotten in the West.,1433203200,,326,4.360655737704918
7077184,5,B00V7ORUUG,ok so here goes I just got my copy of Turn A Gundam from Rightstuf 25 episodes 6 discs japanese audio only video and audio is crisp wonderful job all around sunrise and Rightstuf working hand in hand to give us what bandai was unable to deliver I expect lots more after turn a hopefully zz along with everything else that hasn't gotten stateside and to all the whiners who are moaning about not getting a dub shut up you are true gundam fans 98%of the time the Japanese track trumps the English dub hands down now bandai did a decent job when they dubbed the gundam series they had but I along with many others found the Japanese audio to be far superior and made the story flow so well so if you can't handle the subtitles or listening to the Japanese track there's something wrong with you people,1432598400,16,798,4.326666666666667
7077185,5,B00V7ORUUG,"What can be said about the show? It is a very non-traditional Gundam show, but that doesn't change the fact that it is one of the best, right upside there along the original Gundam series. What makes it so? Quality character writing and development that does not let itself be compromised by Bandai's typical marketing machine. A unique setting with a vibrant Miyazaki inspired vibe that is just filled to the brim with life. This was classic Gundam creator Tomino at his absolute best, when he was free to do what he wished, no longer stricken with depression, and had the stamina to still do full 50 episode series. You won't find recycled animation in every episode like you do 0079, G, Wing and especially SEED and Destiny. Tomino pushed his budget for the show as far as he possibly could, and it shows. Turn A may be a bit of an acquired taste, but if you approach it with an open mind and stick with it, you will be well rewarded by beautiful late 90s cel animation, a world class Yoko Kanno (Cowboy Bebop, Macross Plus, GitS: Stand Alone Complex) soundtrack, and an ultimate beautiful story which some could say serves as an optimistic end point for the entire Gundam franchise... one which simultaneously argues that war is indeed in our nature, and yet perhaps we still 'can' learn to grow beyond it.

Also, this was a 20th anniversary Gundam series, so it is absolutely loaded with homages to the past. Every single series is referenced in some way, either on screen, through designs, or through dialogue. Going into more spoils the nature of the show, but fans who loved Gundam of the 80s and 90s will be very well rewarded. However, don't let that intimidate you. Even if you've never seen a single Gundam episode before, Turn A is still a show you can pick up and watch on your own. It strikes a brilliant balance between being a self contained ""alternate universe"" styled gundam adventure, and a sequel of sorts to Tomino's earlier original timeline ""Universal Century"" television shows. Fans of both can find much to enjoy here.

How is the release you ask? For the price, it's a good value. Like many, I am disappointed that we see no sign of getting a Blu Ray release or a dub any time soon, but those aspects bring up the price significantly, especially the dub, which just isn't practical without Gundam getting TV airings. Despite this, it turns out RightStuf 'did' actually obtain the HD master to use for this DVD release, so it looks nicer than the original R2 DVD release did. There are issues with the downscale interlacing for select frames, so the video unfortunately isn't perfect, but it's still better than most older releases. No extras on this set, but part 2 should have a new never before seen Syd Mead (mechanical designer) interview when it hits. The new translation is solid and well written, and to many that alone will be worth the price of entry. Don't listen to that one-star reviewer who suggests watching the youtube streams, their translation is a terrible old fansub who throws honorifics into everything and can't write a proper sentence. It's an insult and should be avoided at all costs. The video quality is even worse. Bandai will likely take down that release before long anyway.

Part 2 comes out in early August, so by the year's end you'll be able to own the entire series for 70$ or less. It's a steal. Support this and we may well get more Gundam releases state-side in the future including (hopefully) HD releases soemday when Bandai gets over their reverse importation protectionism. Regardless, I thank them for finally doing this release.  The show itself is worth the money, so don't hesitate!",1432425600,8,3655,4.697347893915756
7077186,5,B00V7ORUUG,"Despite this series was once licensed by Bandai Entertainment of America, it has now been distributed by RightStuf anime, and is now getting an exclusive release here in North America, and I must say that it has been a long time coming for those loyal Gundam fans. While I am not a fan of Sub-Only (see their release page on rightstuf.com) releases of individual volumes or separate collections, I am still excited that this series is being released, and I am going to be able to get a hold of this elusive series. Remember Gundam loyalists, this news of it coming back state side might be limited, probably because Bay Entertainment wants to see how it's reception will be towards fans, and then re-releasing Gundam 0079 again soon. Henceforth, quantities might be limited due to licensing state-side. Therefore, only one question remains, is it going to be subbed only, or sub/dub hybrid?",1432339200,,890,4.8618421052631575
7077187,5,B00V7ORUUG,"Finally got my copy of Turn A Gundam and it's looks way better than the fansubbed version, which is to be expected. What I wasn't expecting was for the first 25 episodes to be on 6 discs instead of the normal 4 like Funimation usually does. 4 episodes on each disc except the 6th has 5 which just means better picture quality and I love that part of it. I also like the fact that all 6 discs are housed in one DVD case and the discs are not stacked on top of each other. The subtitle can also be turned off for those that don't need it. Bad part is, there's no extras other than clean opening and closing.",1432166400,9,605,4.05
7077188,5,B00V7ORUUG,"As Turn A Gundam is the 20th anniversary Gundam Series, it was the last to be made in the 2nd Millennium (1999), the last to use the traditional cel-animation process for the series and the last series licensed to be licensed by Bandai's North American distribution company prior to total bankruptcy of the division in 2012 as a trailer was released, but the project cancellation due to finances ended the project.

As this is a first for American Gundam fans who waited for the resurrection of the franchise since Bandai went bankrupt, remember, certain projects taken over by other companies since the bankruptcies of Geneon, ADV Films and Bandai did not receive dubs. Most companies probably don't have enough money for dubbing of all projects or in some cases, would be more desirable with subs only.

Seeing as the relaunch is crucial, you really can't be picky if you want to see more of that show or series.",1431475200,14,914,4.7784810126582276

8709490,2,B00V7ORUUG,"Little did I know that Turn A Gundam was the ending to the complete Gundam universe, that's also what kind of ruined Gundam for me in a way. I always thought that each gundam series had its own universe and they were very different to each other and not always connected. Not to mention that the series is more or less unique in and of itself, but appears more like a drama than a action series. This is not exactly what I was hoping for when I started watching the series let alone when I bought it. If you ask me there's too much drama, not enough action and its too unique in that sense even. Not to mention the unusual Gundam design, but I guess that's what happens when Gundam goes so far into the future. at least I have the final gundam series to complete my vast and growing Gundam collection :P",1469923200,,803,4.220779220779221
8709491,5,B00V7ORUUG,"One of the three shows I recommend to those who rarely watch anime (the others being Mushishi and Monster). The characters might seem odd at first, but it works best if you treat it as Shakesperean in nature- an expansive tale filled with unique and interesting characters, mixing tragedy and comedy. You may not not always agree with the actions they take, but you wouldn't criticize King Leer because of his madness- it's there to explore the clash of cultures.

8709492,5,B00V7ORUUG,"Turn A Gundam was supposed to be Bandai's next big release before the company left America for good. Thankfully, we at least have an official subbed version thanks to RightStuf! This first collection covers Episode 1-25 over 6 discs. The print on the discs looks good and the cover is reversible (check the photos for the reversible cover).

The series is a huge departure from the standard Gundam series and takes place in the Correct Century as opposed to the Universal Century. i won't go into details about the story but it's an alternate timeline and thus doesn't follow the UC storyline. The people of Earth are akin to early 20th century lifestyles and tech while the Moon Race is high tech and advanced. It's an interesting story and the Mobile Suit designs are odd to say the least but the inclusion of many different UC designs from different shows (Like the Zaku, or Borjarnon in Turn A).

Although only subbed, this show is one to see if not to solely support the return of Gundam shows in the US market. If nothing else, get it to add to the collection and support this franchise!",1463097600,,1093,4.6
