I will purchase as soon as it become avaiable. FYI---The only reason why Perry Mason was cancelled was because in a interview with Raymond Burr he stated and I quote ""Im just getting very tired, its a very hectic schedule keeping up with this show"". Well I want to Thank you Mr Burr for the seasons you did stay because I don't think anyone could have played Perry Mason better then you...Thank you for a life time of memories...R.I.P. Mr Burr.",1327104000,35,601,4.423423423423423
8312720,5,B001JAHRJ2,"Perry Mason:  Season 7

The ""Perry Mason"" TV show lasted nine seasons, a record in that era. Few TV series last longer. Erle Stanley Gardner was ""the World's Greatest Author"" in his time, his books outsold the combined totals of his competitors. Season 1 used 36 of his novels for its 39 episodes, Season 2 used 15 of his novels for the 30 episodes. That was over half of his Perry Mason novels. The original novels are better. The films were the simplified and condensed versions of the novels, or new material. The later episodes became a formula where someone would confess in court at the end of the story. No story ever dealt with a false confession as in the 1947 movie ""Boomerang"". This show was criticized for never losing a case. What is the record for most police TV shows? Do they ever make a mistake?

Gardner's novels educated the readers by using examples from law and science or new technology. He dedicated novels to an important person in medicine or law. Gardner founded ""The Court of Last Resort"" to exonerate the innocent convicted. Gardner's stories warned of the dangers of invalid eyewitness identification, drawing the wrong conclusions from circumstantial evidence (guilt by inference), or prematurely accusing a suspect before all the evidence was gathered and evaluated. Some of this stories made the point that while ballistics can identify the gun that fired a bullet it cannot tell when it was fired. ""Perry Mason"" advised his clients to never lie to the police, it was better to say nothing except call for a lawyer. [There is a famous crime with these elements. You can read about Sacco & Vanzetti where they were convicted of robbery and murder in spite of their alibis. Many believed they were innocent and were convicted as part of the repression of the 1920s.]

Erle Stanley Gardner generally avoided politics in this ""Perry Mason"" novels. Some of the ""A.A. Fair"" novels used political corruption in their stories. The 1967 novel ""The Case of the Queenly Contestant"" was publicized for the remark that a bullet found on a stretcher was not proof of anything. Dr. Milton Halpern was blacklisted by the government for criticizing the autopsy of JFK for its lack of an experienced medical examiner. A book written about the TV show said William Talman was not the first choice for DA Hamilton Burger. Raymond Burr played a DA in ""A Place in the Sun"" and a villain in earlier films like ""Borderline"". Did William Talman resemble the prosecutor in the Sacco & Vanzetti case? [There is a Perry Mason Television Book on this series, you can find it on the Internet.]",1360281600,,2595,4.785714285714286
8312721,4,B001JAHRJ2,"I have waited and waited and waited some more!!!!!!

When is season 7 volume I gong to realeased?  I think that it has been about 2 years since season 6 was released.  Why do we have to wait so long?  Does someone have a strangle hold on the person who makes that decision?",1341619200,,273,4.09433962264151
8312722,5,B001JAHRJ2,"ATTENTION PERRY JUNKIES: The cable network Hallmark Movie Channel started airing Perry Season 7 on June 1, 2012. Two shows each day Monday-Friday at Noon AND 1PM Eastern. Season 8 will start around June 20. So if you don't mind shortened credits & a few lower-third network promo keys, JUST RECORD IT FOR FREE WHEN IT AIRS like I'm doing & stop getting bilked out of 70 bucks per season! They time out at about 43 minutes [less commercials], which means all the actual show content should be there. UPDATE JULY 1: Hallmark ran about 3 episodes of Season 8 late June, and then abruptly reverted to Season ONE reruns. Hello Programming Dept...did somebody goof by running season 7 before it was released to DVD? [Too bad; I recorded all of them, so NO SALE.]",1339804800,,756,4.607407407407408
8312723,4,B001JAHRJ2,"I have all six seasons and have viewed each episode often. Among the changes I have noticed that might address some folks' disappointment with shows after season four include: a decreasing role for Della, sometimes just a few words for her - she added so much to the show! ; much less laughter all around; the use of substitutes for Perry (four shows, only the Bette Davis one tolerable); and increasing ""high verbal""/noisy dialogue. While I await 7-9, I will always treasure 1-4.",1338854400,,480,4.795180722891566

8312725,5,B001JAHRJ2,I am also waiting for the release of the last of Perry Mason series on DVD.  I have seasons 1 thru 6.  I have a few of the show from seasons 7 thru 9 on video tape but the recording are not that good.  They are one of the best early TV shows.,1337990400,,242,3.5283018867924527

8312727,3,B001JAHRJ2,"I also heard an interview where Ray stated that he'd wish the series had ended two years earlier because the writing declined. I agree with Ray. After season 4 the show started to decline-it didn't have the same flair or crisp writing that the shows in the 50's had. I found the entire season 6 to be boring and uninspired. Raymond seemed to be going through the motions and was very stilted. I'm not sure if I'll get season 7. Clearly this show was a good fit for the 1950's-they struggled to get the 60's even the early 60's. Having ""David"" dropped in to compete with ""Kookie"" Burns demographic from 77 Sunset Strip was a clear indication to me that the show had lost it's way.",1335571200,3,679,4.396825396825397
8312728,5,B001JAHRJ2,"Won't someone please get the last seasons 7-9 out on dvd for us?  This is the top show of it's time and for all time.  I have all the first six years and have loved every minute of it.  But for true fans, this would be wonderful to own the complete Perry Mason.  Hope they are released soon.",1332806400,31,291,3.9655172413793105
