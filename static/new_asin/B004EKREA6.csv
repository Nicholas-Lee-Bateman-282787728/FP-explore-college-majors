But this one is AMAZING!!
I loved it from the very first second til the end <3
Fell in love with every character, really loved the story and this movie even made me cry!
Going to purchase more movies starring Anil Kapoor and Jackie Shroff.

Don`t miss this one, go get it! :)",1357948800,,366,4.304347826086956

Amongst actors Anil is the highlight of the film and does a great job in his part, this role actually gave him immense fame, popularity and he balances th comedy and serious scenes perfectly Jackie is his usual serious self Madhuri is decent and , Paresh and Annu are good Raakhee is as usual Gulshan Grover hams in the role that gave him fame Raza Murad is okay",1302134400,,600,4.271929824561403
