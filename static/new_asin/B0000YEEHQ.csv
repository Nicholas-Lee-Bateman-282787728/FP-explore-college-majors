8004360,5,B0000YEEHQ,"""a year of celibacy,"" has become a cult classic within San Francisco, whose peculiar old wealth and new age culture at the turn of the third millennium it portrays with romantic idealism last seen in Woody Allen's 1980's Manhattan.  The year in question is one of transition for a young woman named Lucy, flirtatious eye candy who recounts her sexual exploits with relish to her uncomprehending friend.  The year kicks off when this friend stages an intervention by escorting Lucy to a Sex Addicts Anonymous meeting. Lucy listens as others detail obsessive behavior. At around the same time as Lucy admits that she is a sex addict, she meets a motherly artist, and a brotherly mechanic, and a potential lover. The whirlwind emotions of sexual and artistic awakenings in the young and confused Lucy take the form of quick cuts from scene to scene in the camera work. Like all great cult films, it improves with each viewing.",1245542400,,923,4.8354430379746836
8004361,5,B0000YEEHQ,"I loved this movie because it brought me back to my days in San Francisco.  Shot on a shoe string budget with actual San Franciscan's in a variety of great locations- a Honda Motorcycle shop in the Mission, a beautiful Russian Hill apartment, Twin Peaks, Pt. Reyes, and Samuel P. Taylor Park- it's an SF ride.  If you are a recovering ""sex addict,"" interested in a woman's struggle to find herself in art and love, or just want to see a debut feature length film that balances  truth with farce, this film is for you!",1242259200,,517,4.421052631578948
