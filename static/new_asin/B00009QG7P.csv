1888163,5,B00009QG7P,"THIS WAS A GREAT ADAPTION OF STEPHEN KING'S NOVEL, CARRIE.
NEW STAR, ANGELA BETTIS, IS FANTASTIC IN THE LEADING ROLE!!
SHE BRINGS HER OWN UNIQUE STYLE TO THIS ROLE.
AS WELL AS A SIMILAR PLOT TO THE ORIGINAL, THIS FILM BRINGS US MORE DESTRUCTION EFFECTS IN ""THE PROM"" SCENE.
HOWEVER, IF YOU LIKE THE ORIGINAL FILM, SEE THIS VERSION, BECAUSE ANGELA BETTIS TAKES THIS ROLE TO THE EXTREME!!
GREAT MOVIE!!!!",1061164800,,402,4.757142857142857
1888164,4,B00009QG7P,"This movie followed the book much better then the original 1976""Carrie"" (which scared the dickens out of me with the hand coming out of the grave BUT I was 11 yrs old at the time) I Liked Sissy BUT.... the actress is far better, I feel in this one She acted out as a teenager would on her shoes (and pig's blood covered dress) from being pushed to far by cruel class mates  ( I felt sorry for her) this Is a must film BUT you should read the book first, then watch Carrie ""1976"", And then watch this one..... Strange BUT....this girl seemed more related to the girl(Rachel) Carrie's sister In ""Carrie 2 The Rage""",1060646400,,612,4.275862068965517
1888165,1,B00009QG7P,"I was very excited to see this on TV when I saw the commercial.  I am a HUGE fan of the original, and could honestly see DePalma's Carrie once a day ever day and not be tired of it.  Yet I was excited to see an updated version just for kicks.
  First off I agree with another writer.  This is a Book remake not a remake of the DePalma classic.  I never really cared for the way the book was laid out, and had a tough time getting into the story.  That made it tough for me to warm up to this version.  And the book ending was blah, and teh tv version ending was worse!  Oha nd thebath tub scene?  Oh PAH-lease!  Totally predictable and cliched.
  That's why I feel DePalma did more for Carrie and Marraret White's story then even King himself did.  The DePalma ending was far superior to the book ending. And the elemnts the movie provided, like the haunting musical themes really help build teh movie.  From acting, to style: From score to production value, DePalma has this movie pegged better then King told his stiry.  I think King even admitted that DePalma's ending was better thenhis in an interview somewhere.  OH and Cissy and Piper were  Brilliant!  Oscar nods if I am not mistaken?  So reguardless of how you look at it, the TV version cannot even compate in the same realm as the DePalma classic.  Certain movies just do not need to be remade.  Like Psycho, Carrie is one of them.  Now I know Moustapha Akkad will one day get the brilliant idea to remake Carpenter's Halloween, but PLEASE SPARE US THE AGONY.  Just re-re-re-release a new version of the classic on DVD instead (oh he just did that! 25th anniversary special, GO BUY IT!).
  Bottom line is this tv version cannot live up to the original.  No way, no how.  I will give it one thing though:  It was at least interesting to watch, but when ever I wanna go to the Prom, I'll go with the Depalma classic.  I will buy this for my collection though.  After all I am a scary movie fan.  Gotta support the genra, and the way to show your support is through your dollar! CHA-CHING!",1060214400,3,2047,4.319261213720317
1888166,3,B00009QG7P,"Let's not call this a remake of Brian DePalma's movie. It's a remake of Stephen King's novel. I'm not terribly fond of the DePalma film, and all in all I prefer this version. As another reviewer noted, it is a more faithful adaptation. This ceases to be the case at some point very near the end, though, which was a bit strange, but it doesn't bother me because I understand the point of the changes. Angela Bettis is an outstanding Carrie, and Patricia Clarkson as her mother gives a quiet, scary performance, which is a nice tonic for the entirely-too-over-the-top one Piper Laurie gave in DePalma's film. By no means is this a perfect film, and if you want the best version of the story you should still seek out Stephen King's novel, but it is enjoyable and well-made.",1059177600,5,772,4.561151079136691
1888167,4,B00009QG7P,"CARRIE (this v.) is good. Angela Bettis is a very good actress- great looks, great act, ya know. It's practicly what you imagine in your head when you read Carrie. It deserves AT LEAST 4 and a half stars. I'd have to say- it's better for kids to watch. Sissy Spacek was in the ""R"" one, Angela Bettis is in this TV14 v. Way cool!",1056844800,,328,4.061538461538461
1888168,3,B00009QG7P,"For anyone who has read the novel from which this teleplay was based, they know as well as I do, it is far more faithful to King's original work.  While Brian DePalma made a great movie, he went off in his own direction, making a melodrama with a terrifying last 20 minutes.  This movie itself is definitely a TV movie, lacking in the large scale production of its predecessor, but worth a watch if you were a fan of the book.",1054598400,2,426,4.246913580246914
1888177,5,B00009QG7P,"As much as I highly enjoy the original 1971 version, and even the 2013 version, this version has the most perfect and accurate Carrie. The Carrie in the other adaptions honestly didn't look anything like a bullied, abused, damaged girl.

They had pretty blonde hair, and just looked normal. This Carrie though, has brown MESSY hair, and a very dark look. An almost evil look. But this look truly matches Carrie the most.

She actually looks like a bullied, abused girl. She's also more socially awkward, and yet has this sass about her.

I'm also HIGHLY impressed with how they had the movie take place as 'flashback' and we see the police questioning the students.

I'm also impressed by the running time, 2 whole hours. I think it's the longest version, but I'm not sure. It's also the closest to the book.

Another thing I enjoyed was the fact in this version Carrie actually lives. The teacher is awesome, and the actress for the mother is pretty good, although I prefer Moore's performance the most.

Overall, its really good. It's less horror and more intense/dark and interesting. It's a really great watch, especially if you love Carrie and want to watch all the versions.",1453248000,4,1180,4.759803921568627
1888178,4,B00009QG7P,"Well, I thought that this set would have a better looking picture, but both of these are just the same ol' ones that were already released. The new Carrie has a pretty decent looking picture, but the first one sucks. Eh, oh well, if you already have the single blu-ray releases, don't buy this set. That is why I'm giving it four stars. Quality and because they are good movies.",1443312000,,378,4.414285714285715
1888179,5,B00009QG7P,I like this Carrie movie it had good special effects and is way better then the 2013 Carrie.,1441843200,,92,4.166666666666667
1888180,5,B00009QG7P,"I never saw the original nor read the book but I have to say that this is the best Carrie I've seen. The 90's sequel attempt was just insane, trying to make Rachel Carrie's sister. There was no prom, honestly the movie was so different other than it's attempt to be a sequel that it could of been entirely different movie, outcast girl with telekinesis goes on a rampage, only thing in common. And really, she wasn't so much of an outcast, seemed more like a wannabe punk girl to me.

Kind of in the way Rob Zombie took Laurie and made her a total punk, to the point you almost want to hate her sometimes, especially in RZ's sequel when she treats her luckily surviving friend like crap. Anyway on to THIS movie.

I did find Sue to be sympathetic but passive, she knew what was going to happen when Carrie opened her locker, yet she said nothing, even though it looked like she was dying to. Yet just a little while before that she was chanting with the girls while Carrie was freaking out and scared to death. After that, it seems like they wanted to portray Sue as this very mysterious character, attempting to make her look like she was playing serious mind games between everyone.

This was further pushed by Chris when she went to Carrie and in her own passive aggressive way was trying to manipulate the situation herself. It wasn't just plain and simple bullying, there were attempts at mind games, manipulations and it becomes a war of Chris Vs Sue with poor Carrie caught in the middle.

(I have to say I especially loved the moment Carrie implied Sue thought Chris needed botox. Not going to go into how that comes about.)

I have to say that Chris gets some character sympathy for me. I agree that she doesn't seem capable of doing what she ultimately does but I get the sense that there is peer pressure that comes into play. To begin with, she clearly has a controlling and even a bit of an abusive boyfriend and I think he is the main driver that actually makes the joke come to life, for Chris I merely think it was just an idea and she clearly had doubts, not to mention she was totally skittish when they went to the farm and later threatened to kill her if she talked, clearly freaking her out and ultimately attempting to run Carrie over despite Chris screaming for him to stop. The character was given a lot of vulnerabilities that comes out as the story progresses and gives the viewer a chance to possibly give this character sympathy. Yeah she went through with the big prank but this was less than an hour after this guy threatened to kill her, she came up with the idea but really beyond that, it was his thing despite his claims that it wasn't, he wanted it to happen. Emilie De Ravin did a fantastic job playing on these vulnerabilities that were spared to her character.

Meanwhile Sue still seems to be ominous and ultimately helps Carrie escape yet for me, personally, I don't feel like the character deserves any kind of winning badge. She still acts like shes playing mind games with the detective, she didn't have to be like that, seeming to purposely make him question her innocence in the whole ordeal by coming off as a chill, even antagonizing girl that doesn't appear to be as upset about everything as he thinks she should and rather actually going out of her way to seem not upset. The girl comes off as a total mind game even though as the viewer you can see through her like a glass window.

(Oh and her boyfriend was killed by the bucket that hit him on the head. Guess she didn't love him very much, huh? I have to give him props for killer aim though, if you haven't seen the movie, if you do, you will know what I mean. Props to the writers for this)

There was a lot of passive aggressiveness, manipulation and hot and cold in the bullying which wasn't always entirely aimed at Carrie. Yes she is the ultimate victim but I enjoyed the way the movie takes you into the popular drama ultimately triggered by the prom and the disrespect Chris perceived to get from Sue and ultimately their disagreement and the soap opera that followed, giving us time to see Carrie being left alone to be herself, to even grow as a character as an example, she learns how to use a computer for the first time while the popular ones are too self involved in their own crap.

It seemed much more authentic in it's representation of high school, it's not all perfect popular ones get along and target the less fortunate, much more BS goes on between and within the popular clique that distracts them from the outsiders and more often than not, bullying exists more so within the group than towards those outside of it. Out of them all though, I think Chris gets more sympathy from me by far, in a way being a victim herself but it doesn't justify anything she did prior to coming up with the idea to ruin Carrie at the prom, from the moment she came up with the idea, I think Billy took over power even if it wasn't shown, I go by the subtle things I see in what is shown.

Sue, yes she ultimately saves Carrie and gets her out of town, but then what? Does she drop her off beside the road in Florida? Bother to get her a hotel room? I heard this movie was supposed to turn into a television series (Honestly don't know how this movie in particular could be carried out long term to even make a series and it never happened so likely others felt the same.) But because it is what they planned which is why it had the ending that it did, it left so many things unanswered, things that could have bought Sue more justice but you never know what she does with Carrie after she takes off with her.

(Maybe they get a hotel and she kills Carrie in her sleep? In some twisted way, and she seems like a twisted person anyway, maybe she changed things around in her head and blames Carrie for her boyfriend, who she doesn't seem all that upset about, getting killed? By the way she acts through interrogation, she could possibly be filled with hate rather than any kind of sadness or remorse, for whatever reason, she is defensive, antagonizing and even appears manipulative through out when she didn't need to be. To protect Carrie, all she had to do was simply imply that she didn't and doesn't know anything. The detective does imply that Chris Vs Sue was a staged drama to ultimately get Carrie but I don't find that to be possible, especially when Chris interacts with others like her friend Tina or when she calls Billy on the phone. If the drama was staged, no need to keep them out of the loop, neither Tina or Billy would have gone out of their way to go tell Carrie. In fact Tina had no sympathy at all for Carrie no more than Billy which tells you something. I know Chris was being manipulative and passive aggressive but just seeing her even be able to pretend to be nice to Carrie makes me question if ever that they could of possibly connected.)

To make that point, unless I missed something, I don't think at that part of the movie Chris had any idea about Sue's plans to get her boyfriend to go to prom with Carrie, so why try to drive a wedge between Sue and Carrie? And given that there was Chris Vs Sue, it makes me wonder if in actuality Chris was trying to protect Carrie. I know that seems outlandish given how things go post this scene, maybe it wasn't care but rather territorial? Carrie was her victim and so long as Sue was divided from her as a friend, she no longer had rights to Carrie. Then again Chris was clearly BFF's with Tina and she didn't ever seem that close to Sue to ever begin with.

It's confusing and if anyone has any theories on this particular scene, let me know. For whatever reason, Chris wanted to drive Carrie away from Sue, could of possibly been due to Sue appearing to have sympathy for Carrie, yet then she would change her mind and go along with Chris. (Chris clearly picks up on this double sided play during the bowling alley scene in which Sue claims what they did was dumb and then in a seconds thought decides to go friendly and keep the peace with Chris in the moment and then the competition is totally driven home when the two couples stare each other down.)

Assuming that Sue did end up killing Carrie, out of misdirected revenge or possibly to prevent it from ever happening again, it makes the movie feel answered to me but Sue clearly isn't innocent, she did something that caused her to keep up her charade with the investigator and it didn't even seem just self protective by saying some of the things she said which could be seen as even antagonizing and then she clearly isn't heart broken.

As for Carrie? What does she do? She still has to have issues, maybe even more so by that point due to everything that happened, trauma, guilt, a self esteem practically destroyed from existence and no money or way to live, not even a realistic view of the world to even I don't think independently function in it properly, and she never graduates and that says what direction her future goes career wise as a burger flipper, though that is when her power really could come in handy. (I could see McDonald's burgers, about three or four in the air moving about as they make themselves via the power of her mind while she manually works on one with her hands.)

I like the way the movie was done, very true to high school experiences, I like that the bullies were given little moments that might cause a viewer to question a final opinion on them rather than readily hating them as they might anticipate doing when they start the movie, it was well done and portrayed well by a great cast with special congrats to Angela Bettis and Emilie De Ravin on their portrayals. Digging in deeper to other characters while still being able to bring it back around to center on the main plot, transitions and character developments coming along perfectly. Should be more than just TV worthy and actually given more widespread exposure to compete against the block buster 2013 remake.

While the effects were better, the cast nor the way it was written was done well at all and in fact every character from this movie was betrayed by that movie when each of them was changed so drastically (Chris going from blonde to dark hair?) Though that is minor in how the newest remake betrayed the wonderful ways that these characters were made in this movie. Chloe is a great actress, though I don't think the role was right for her, she didn't come off as an actual tortured soul to me. Angela with her drastically horrid appearance expresses her pain by it's self without any dramatics, just the fact that she didn't keep herself up, let her hair go as it would and most of the time it was an awful mess, horrible clothes, even by Good Will standards, classic severe depression, lack of knowledge about things she should of known about but was never properly taught and the repression of her mother that kept her from discovering things she should of.

Chloe just seemed to me, at worst, to be a plain Jane girl that wasn't glamorous enough to get into the popular crowd, she reminded me more of Rachel from ""Carrie 2: The Rage"" neither one looked awful, though Chloe is prettier than that girl from the 90's but that is where a huge problem is, she is way too pretty. In some high schools, especially these days, a lot of the cliche's are gone and Chloe is the kind of girl that by appearance kind of makes an example of that, you can be like a bunch of other kids, wear decent clothes, keep yourselves up and most just become equal faces in the crowd, none of them overly done or higher up. A lot of teens these days don't even have social ranks, if most can pull off being equal to each other, that is cool and that is just what they do and they go with the flow.

Kind of like the middle class outnumbering the rich and the poor by far. They are just middle, casual, normal people that blend in with each other much like the houses in suburbia. The only real thing that seems to trigger BS with these individuals is the things that they do rather than what they wear or how they act because they are mostly too similar to differentiate by that, and their drama's are hardly Hollywood. So a girl sleeps with another girls boyfriend? Might get in a fight but it's not always some big news story around, most of the time it's isolated and much goes on outside of school, over the net, at each others houses or on the phone.

Chloe seems like that type of girl to me, at least in her Carrie role, not an outcast, just a plain average girl, till prom and then all the real prettiness comes out. Even still, by prom appearance I would not rank her as someone who would suddenly get all eyes attention just by getting all dolled up. (Though she would due to celeb status but as a normal girl, I bet it wouldn't be like that.)

Okay done ranting, sometimes I can get really going, this movie is good though and I recommend it.

Small update! I think Gage Golightly would of made a better Carrie? I made a comparison collage below from Carrie and Gage's role in Teen Wolf.",1441411200,3,13030,4.386749482401656
1888181,5,B00009QG7P,"This is, without a doubt, the best of the three cinematic versions made of Stephen King's classic novel.  It's the closest (despite the ""twist-ending,"" because of the hope that it would be the pilot for a series) to King's work, scene-for-scene.  Of course, there were necessary updatings (Carrie researches her ""condition"" on the internet rather than in books; a school's reaction to bullying, etc.)  I'm not saying that the '76 screen classic version was bad or worse - it was different (the '13 version just didn't hit it).  Angela Bettis was brilliant in the title role (it still would be interesting to see a ""Carrie"" who looked like the description in the novel - frumpy, a bit overweight, acne, all that).  All the supportive case was equally wonderful.  So many critics/fans gave this version a derision, trying to compare it to the '76, but it must be remembered that this was not a ""remake"" of '76 - it's another version of the novel.",1438214400,,944,4.7607361963190185

1888184,4,B00009QG7P,"The 2013 Carrie seems to have been made for kids who never saw the 1976 DePalma version, so its novel to have them packaged together. Directed by Kimberly Peirce, who made her name with Boys Dont Cry, there are fine aspects to it, and its not unintelligent, which makes one somewhat more impatient with it. But its basically serious business, hitting all the thunderous present day horror movie clichs, and not very nuanced. What makes Brian DePalmas version superior is that even in its own time, it defied convention and it floated above the commonplace.

The 2013 version is better when it dishes out Carries revenge, a dish served hot here. The prom gone to hell scratches nearly every itch. The showdown between Carrie and Chris Hargensen is as satisfying as can be, where the 1976 version fell short. Where the film is most lacking is in the performances, notably Julianne Moores withered Mrs. White, a lackluster turn compared to Piper Lauries beautiful aria. DePalmas version manages to be both funny and tragic, starting with a stab and ending in pathos, where Peirces merely descends into kitsch, leaving no emotional echoes.

As for this package, it suggests the studio wanted to sell the remake to fans of the classic. The 2013 version has a good Blu-Ray work up, but the disc for the 1976 Carrie has stripped away all the DVD extras, so you're better off buying it on its own. There isn't even a financial savings to buy them together.",1432684800,5,1448,4.764940239043825
1888185,5,B00009QG7P,"I have been a huge fan of Stephen King for nearly thirty years.  In fact I have enjoyed some of his novels so much I have read a few of them (Including the novel that is the basis for this movie.) more than once.  The film adaptations of his work range from excellent (The Green Mile, The Stand.) to downright awful (Graveyard Shift, The Lawnmower Man.).  This, the second of three film adaptations of King's classic novel, is one of the excellent ones.

I have been a fan of this made for television version since the first time I saw it when it premiered in 2002.  There are many reasons why this movie works so well.  The main reason is Angela Bettis.  She is perfectly cast as the title character.  Despite the fact that she was 29 years old when the movie was filmed she is very believable as the long suffering girl who faces both terrible abuse by her peers at school and her borderline insane fundamentalist mother (Played by Patricia Clarkson.).  The supporting cast is terrific as well.  Rena Sofer is very good as Carrie's phys ed teacher Rita Desjardin, one of the very few friends that Carrie has in life.  Kandyse McClure is also quite good as Sue Snell.  Veteran actor David Kieth is also very good as the police detective investigating the tragic events caused by Carrie's wrath.

Bryan Fuller has in my opinion done a very good job with the teleplay.  It is very faithful to the novel.  As is usually the case there have been some changes from the novel.  Some are not so bad, but there are a few that I did not care for.  One change that I did like I will admit is the ending.  I like the fact that Carrie survived in this version because despite all that she did I did not think she deserved to die.  The reason for this change was for this movie to serve as a pilot for a television series that ultimately never came to fruition, but I still liked this change because I sympathized with Carrie and felt she did not deserve to be treated the way she was by her peers or her mother.

There was one change from King's novel that I did not care for.  In the novel, after Carrie is humiliated at the prom she decided to exact revenge by use of her telekinetic powers.  She does so voluntarily and is fully aware of the the death and destruction she is causing.  In this adaptation her powers take over her mind and body after she is humiliated.  She goes into some kind of trance and her powers act on their own.  When she finally snaps out of her trance after she returns home, she has no knowledge of what she has done.  That is not a change I would have made because Carrie having full knowledge of her actions adds to the horror of the events and makes them even more frightening in my opinion.

Still despite this criticism I very much enjoyed this version of ""Carrie"" and I think you will as well.  I highly recommend you make time to see it.  Also, if you have not already, read Stephen King's classic novel that is the basis for this movie.  It is well worth it.",1428105600,,2985,4.307001795332137

1888214,5,B00009QG7P,"This 2002 made for TV adaption of King's bestselling novel is the second adaption of King's novel and also a re-imagining at the same time. This film stays a lot more true and faithful to the novel than the 1976 feature film adaption (see review).

The whole movie is centered on the local police investigation of what happened on prom night at Ewen High School. The police interview students who were at or not at the prom. As the police interview the students and later on, the gym teacher, we watched the story unfold as we watch the events leading up to prom night. The girls are playing softball in gym class and when it is all over, we see them head for the girl's locker room to shower and change clothes. Carrie (Angela Bettis) showers alone and is scared when she sees blood and fears that she is dying while the girls taunt her by shouting repeatedly ""Period!"" to her and the gym teacher Miss Desjardan (Rena Sofer) intervenes and she is sent home. Carrie then faces her religiously fanatical and legalistic mother (Patricia Clarkson) and is forced into a prayer closet and not let out until her mother feels that she is truly sorry for supposedly sinning when she had her first menstruation experience. Later on, as the girls are getting ready for gym, Miss Desjardan shows how angry she is with the girls that she decides to punish them by having them do intense physical fitness in the gym everyday, with only Chris Hargensen (Emilie De Ravin) deciding that she won't cooperate and as a result of that, she is suspended and banned from the upcoming senior prom. Carrie researches telekinetics and other sorts of strange phenoma in the school's library because she really can't understand why she has this power and what she can do about it. Later on, Sue Snell (Kandyse McClure) talks her boyfriend Tommy Ross (Tobias Mehler) into taking Carrie White to the upcoming senior prom out of remorse for participating in the locker room ruckus with the other girls. At first, Tommy is reluctant thinking that it is a totally mean joke and that Carrie will see right through it, but subsequently agrees to do it. Tommy later asks Carrie, who initially refuses thinking that she is being tricked and after some nice persuasion by Tommy, Carrie accepts, which leads to her telling her mother that she was invited and that she is going despite her mother's objections. Carrie shows that her mother's reign over her is over and that she is going and that her mother can't stop her and that is that. Chris later asks her boyfriend Billy Nolan (Jesse Cadotte) to help her play a prank on Carrie White and when Chris later hears through her girlfriend Tina (Katharine Isabelle) that Tommy Ross is taking Carrie White to the prom by showing her a ballot with Tommy and Carrie on it, they decide to go to a pig farm to slaughter a pig for it's blood as part of the prank, with Jackie Talbot (Malcolm Scott) and Kenny Garson (Miles Meadows) also in on the prank. As they arrive at the prom, everyone is shocked to see Carrie walk in with Tommy and the first to come to them is Helen (Chelan Simmons) and Roy (Steve Byers) who compliments her on her dress and they start to talk and get along. They are also approached by Norma (Meghan Black) who sees that Carrie is glowing with enthusiasm. After a confrontation by Miss Desjardin, Tommy and Carrie share in a slow dance and are surprised when they are elected king and queen of the senior prom. Not too long after this happens, Chris and Billy dump the pig's blood on Carrie and the whole crowd is shocked by this happening and when Kenny starts shouting taunts in the form of pig calls, Carrie has a mental breakdown and hears imaginary laughter in her mind and this unleashes her telekinetic powers and all H-E-Double Hockey Sticks breaks loose on everyone at the prom. The frightened prom night goers run everyplace around the gym, but find no way out. Carrie starts leaving the gym and as soon as she leaves the school, which starts to crumble as she leaves as a result of the electrical fire that was started when the electrical mechanisms malfunctioned, Carrie leaves mountains of destruction as she continues to walk home in a telekinetic trance and inadvertently gets even with Billy and Chris by making their vehicle smash and crash into a pole. The town becomes a disaster area as Carrie leaves destruction and death where she walks. I won't give too much away as I don't want to spoil it for those of you who haven't seen it yet.

David Carson does a terrific auspicious job as the director of this 2002 adaption of King's bestselling novel. Bryan Fuller also wrote a great teleplay for this film. The special effects are realistic and well done. The film is also very well acted for a TV movie as Angela Bettis plays Carrie White brilliantly and Patricia Clarkson portrays Carrie's mother with unholy relish. The rest of the cast also portray their roles in the film wonderfully. Each and everything about this film is great. It is an edge of the seat thrill ride when the mayhem really starts and once it has you in it's grip, it won't let you go until the bitter end. It is a scary and frightening film that sends chills up the spine. We get to see the story unfold as the police detective talks with several students and a faculty member about prom night and what had happened that night with a lot of unanswered questions.

I watched this made for TV adaption when it premiered on the NBC network in November of 2002. Before I did, I re-read King's novel and when I watched the film soon after, I saw that this was a more faithful adaption of the novel than the initial 1976 adaption. I also felt that it was a much better adaption as well as the best adaption of the novel. It stays true to the novel and leaves you wondering what will happen next as you watch it. I actually enjoyed this adaption and I still enjoy it. It happens to be my favorite adaption of the bestselling novel. I still enjoy the original 1976 adaption, but this particular adaption will always be my favorite of all three, as the novel was later adapted and re-imagined again in 2013.

The DVD has nothing in regards to special features. The only things that we get is the preview trailer for this particular adaption and a few other preview trailers of other MGM released horror films. We also get a recommendation page of other MGM release horror DVD's. The movie still looks as colorful and fresh as the day that the film premiered on NBC in November of 2002. It was also meant to be a pilot for a TV series about Carrie, but was later scrapped. I bought my copy used from a local DVD rental store that was going out of business. I still enjoy this particular version and I have watched it several times since owning it.

If you have a taste for horror, this 2002 adaption of Carrie is for you. It delivers all the goods that you'd expect in a horror film and it also will frighten and scare you. No fan of horror should pass this one up nor forget to add to their personal DVD library's. It is truly a treat for any fan of horror films.",1398211200,2,7077,4.504280155642023
1888215,4,B00009QG7P,"I absolutely love the 1976 Carrie film. I've loved it ever since I was a child. Recently there was a remake of it starring Chloe Moretz, and it's equally good. However, there is another remake of Carrie that was made for tv in 2002 that some people may not know about. I don't love it like I do the original and newest version, but it is a lot truer to the book. For example, this has the police conducting interviews and asking people about the conspiracy to dump the pig's blood, it has the rain of stones, but most importantly it has the destruction of the town.

Angela Bettis plays Carrie White this time. She's a pretty woman, She's a great actress (watch 'May') but her performance of Carrie just came off as awkward. Maybe that's the way she wanted to portray the character, but I think Sissy and Chloe were better. Emilie De Ravin made a good Miss Desjardin. She was very conniving and vicious. I liked Rena Sofer's performance as Miss Desjardin. She was more strict and more authoritative than Judy Greer in the 2013 remake. Patricia Clarkson was kinda bland as Margaret White. She wasn't as crazy as Piper Laurie, nor psychotic as Julianne Moore.

Carrie White is a very shy girl who has no friends and a crazy religious mom who constantly locks her in the closet. When she gets her first period during gym class, all the girls humiliate her. This starts a chain of events when Carrie finds out she has telekinesis; the power to move objects with her mind. When Sue Snell feels bad for mocking Carrie, she asks her boyfriend, Tommy Ross to take Carrie to the prom.

When Carrie is crowned Prom Queen, the bucket of pig's blood is poured and all hell breaks loose. The story of Carrie is probably my absolute favorite by Stephen King. If you love the story, you may enjoy this interpretation of CARRIE!!!",1390262400,,1814,4.524390243902439

Sue Snell (another actress miscast with a hard edged smart mouthed girl) giving Carrie CPR? Oh I swear I was saying ""NOOOOO!"" at the TV, because I couldn't take anymore of this ridiculous nonsence. Huge parts of the original movie were missed, some of the best parts, and replaced with stupid, useless scenes that made NO SENSE. Like the fireballs coming down on their house. How ridiculous. The ONLY good part of this movie were the high school girls, they were very close to the girls in the original, and I liked the gym teacher.

The first one was so good.' The theatrics were way over the top and I know this was suppose to be a closer adaption of King's book but the acting was so bad I couldn't even begin to care. Watching Sissy Spacek's Carrie was so sad. I cared about her character. I pitied her. I felt nothing for any of these characters especially Billy who mostly just gave people a detached cold stare. The Shining was remade and it was done very well. This was not. When are studios going to realize that some movie classics are best left alone? The day they remake Gone With The Wind will be sad indeed and I wouldn't be surprised to see them do it.

Instead of remaking every great movie why not say to the younger generation to look back and watch these films. You know, before most if not all horror movies contained obscene amounts of gore and torture. Let them see movies can be and are great without all that stuff? Why not instead of remaking all these great horror classics give us some new stories to watch? Yet I suppose its the money that usually wins. Why make something new when a remake with cheesy acting costs a lot less and still produces a profit?

I still think, however, that the 1976 film is superior because of the time period for the movie. In the 2002 movie, everything is upgraded to reflect the times we live in (Internet, cell phones, etc) which is a bit tacky. Also, this movie has a surprisingly weak ending. I thought the 1976 film had a weak and frustrating ending; it was nothing compared to the almost abrupt ending in this version. Still, this movie has some replay value, especially with those who want to compare the two movies.

1888267,4,B00009QG7P,"Readers who were die-hard fans of the novel ""Carrie"" might emphathize with my level of disappointment after viewing Brian DePalma's movie based on Stephen King's novel. I'd expected so much from that movie, what with DePalma, director of boss films like ""Sisters"" and ""Hi, Mom,"" and brilliant actors like Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie on board to bring the novel to life. But when I stepped out of the cinema I was scandalized because my favorite novel had been so badly degraded and cheapened. The now-classic novel had been ""raped"" by that part of Hollywood that caters to junior high school mentalities who get off on gore and the F word.

And then, several decades later a miracle happened: Stephen King's ""Carrie"" was recreated, crafted intelligently and with respect. Just as no actor can replace Gregory Peck in the role of Atticus Finch, no actor can ever surpass Angela Bettis in the role of Carrie White. Bettis not only plays the role, she OWNS it; her performance undoubtedly brought a tear of joy to the eye of the author himself. Equal praise goes to those actors who played the roles of gym teacher Ms. Desjardin and the kids: Sue, Chris, Tommy, Billy, gurgly Norma and Chris' shadow Tina. Their dialogue, behaviors and antics not only do justic to King's characters, but are realistic enough to remind one of her/his own high school days. Furthermore, the movie's special effects, so painfully lacking in the '76 film, are fascinating and scary enough to please any horror-flick fan. In short, ""Carrie"" is so fine a movie that it almost succeeds in wiping the Z-grade 1976 version from memory.

Despite all my goggly praise for this movie, I have two criticisms that keep me from giving it a 5-Star rating: the watered-down charactorization of Carrie's mother and the movie's ludicrous conclusion. The Margaret White of King's novel was a woman religiously fanatical to the point of insanity, however the screenplay has Margaret watered down to nearly the level of Marmee in ""Little Women."" On hand to play the role is Patricia Clark, an outstanding actor in her own right. Throughout the movie, I felt cheated waiting for Margaret to explode with her characteristic self-righteous fury of the novel and getting nothing but firm scoldings. Especially disappointing was the scene where Margaret tries to drown Carrie with almost no emotion. The scene in the novel where Margaret stabs Carrie rather than drowns her has Margaret reminiscing with great emotion the ""sin"" of her marriage to Carrie's father and her plan to kill Carrie, the child from her ""unholy"" liason, at birth.  Throughout the movie, we never learn what makes Carrie's mother tick, which is sad since she's such an integral character in the story.

Why anyone would spoil an terrific movie with so assinine a conclusion is beyond me. The conclusion isn't even worth a mention. Carrie dies in the novel bleeding to death in a field where Sue eventually finds her, and Sue is horrified when Carrie ""invades"" her very soul as she transitions from life to death. Why not have used that conclusion for the movie rather than end it with a rubbishy storyline involving secret graveyard burials and Carrie escaping to parts unknown, courtesy of Sue and camouflaged in a blond Beatle wig?

Despite these weaknesses, ""Carrie"" is a movie that will be valued in its own right, even for viewers unfamiliar with King's novel. The movie does Stephen King's novel well-deserved justice, and I'm sure that King himself would agree!",1358640000,2,3497,4.930390492359932
1888268,3,B00009QG7P,"For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some thoughts on this movie...

Carrie (2002) is a remake of the original 1976 movie starring Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie, Betty Buckley, and John Travolta.  Sure, this remake is a faithful adaptation of the Stephen King novel, but if you want to watch the far superior movie, then see the 1976 movie.  The problem with this 2002 remake is that it falls short of the original on every level.  It just doesn't have the same magic and chemistry of the original.  Some of the characters are sort of bland.  Angela Bettis, however, gives a pretty good performance as Carrie White, but Sissy Spacek IS Carrie White.  Everything seems to be waaaaaaaaay overdone as well.  The nightmarish prom scene drags on too long and is just so over the top.  Also, the musical score isn't as good as the original.  Not only that, but the music that's playing during Carrie's telekinetic rampage at the prom doesn't fit the scene.  It sounds more suited to a chase scene in some action movie.

If you haven't seen this 2002 movie, you might want to check it out and compare it to the original.  If you've only seen the 2002 movie, I highly recommend seeing the 1976 original.

I only recommend a rental for the 2002 movie.",1354406400,,1265,4.584821428571429

I was surprised at how much I liked this movie. Angela Bettis portrays the awkward outcast, Carrie White and she plays the role phenominally. She's right up there with Sissy Spacek, the original Carrie. Because of the fact that CGI has become more common, the filmmakers stayed more true the novel which makes this movie good alone. Though the effects were something you'd see from a SyFy film (especially in the falling stones scene) it wasn't too distracting. The acting was really good, too, even the minor characters shined. The movie was a bit boring and dragged for a while, but it managed to pull through in the end. I definitely think if this movie isn't taken seriously, anyone could enjoy it.

1888274,4,B00009QG7P,"A bit over two hours long and the remake, or rather homage, to the original 1976 version of the Stephen King story ""Carrie"" is quite well done.

I can't compare to the original as it has been so long since I watched the original.  But when I saw several actors and actresses from the SyFy Channel I was a bit apprehensive.

Carrie is a girl with budding telekinetic ability who lives with a crazy mom who punishes her and locks her in a prayer closet to pray.  Using religion as a punishment/drive tool is pretty bad but Carrie is even more introverted and practically catatonic when it comes to social intercourse among her fellow students.

And they are a cruel bunch.  They despise her and do all manner of bullying.  When Carrie has her period in the gym shower, they come up to her and chant ""Period"", I'm sure with the best of intentions to let her know what's happening.  Not!

Angela Bettis plays the socially frigid girl quite well.  And her insane mom really goes nuts when Carrie gets to go to the prom with Tommy, who was convinced to do so by his girlfriend Sue Snell (well known to Battlestar Galactica fans as Kandyse McClure).  Her motive is not really clear - looks  like a pity move to me.

Spoiler:  The senior prom prank was really bad and set Carrie off on a destructive wave across the town as well as killing most of the students in the process - many deserved it, frankly.  This film was more a psychological study in bullying than a horror film, which is fine with me!

Bottom Line:  Surprisingly good!  Decent special effects and the acting was not bad at all though at times over-dramatized.  The DVD from MGM was pretty lame.  The movie and trailers (""special features"", yeah, right!).

I cannot fault her acting. I can overlook some of the bad acting in this remake from the other charactors as Bettis alone carried the story well. some of the other actors were ok like the gym teacher I enjoyed her hard stance and her recount of her senior prom. Carries mother was o.k in her role but I still prefer the original in that Margeret had schitzopherina and truly was weirder. I still prefer Tommy Ross in the original I felt he had more personality and was better looking. Nobody can do Billy Nolan Like John Travolta, he is far superior in his acting abilities, not some try hard idiot that billy Nolan was in the remake, he wasn't even good looking. Sue Snell was borderline, Amy Irving had more going for her. Chris wasn't believable at all she too seemed like a silly school girl much like Billy Nolan, he made all the decisions.

I hated Tina, Helen and Norma, they seemed to lack substance and didn't seem like very interesting people, bored even.

Angela Bettis, in my opinion, gives an all-star performance in her own right, portraying Carrie as more genuinely weird, and at times taking the character to a more intense level than Spacek.  As others have also mentioned, Patricia Clarkson is notable for her subdued but no less scary interpretation of Carrie's mother.  And, in addition to the fact that the frequent nods toward the original film are mostly well done and add to the movie's effectiveness, it's also nice to see some of the material from the book represented that was omitted from De Palma's movie.  Weaknesses include some poor acting from a few of the minor characters; the cheap, basic cable look of the photography and special effects; tidbits of poorly written, ""updated"" language; and the silly twist-ending that has no impact and is entirely forgettable.  Weighing the good with the bad, this movie comes out with a solid C, maybe leaning toward a C+.

The movie is known for the powerhouse performance of Patricia Clarkson (from TV's ""Six Feet Under) who plays Carrie's Bible-thumping, overprotective mother.

The first Carrie made starred Sissy Spacek and she did an excellent job playing the role of Carrie and I often wish she could have been in this one! However the newer actress(Angela Bettis) does do a remarkable job. It is nice to see that the woman playing Carries mother in the remake was not as crazy as the one in the first. In the first Carrie, Carries mother (played by actress Piper Laurie) kinda went overboard with the whole dying thing. She looked more like she was doing something else but I decline to actually write what that looked like in a review. Lets just say, it didn't look right with the rest of the movie in the first movie. In the second movie that scene wasn't even in it and it is a lot more tasteful and somewhat closer to the book. In the remake, Carries mother dies of a heart attack rather than a stabbing, a better touch I thought.  The new actresses are really good! It has a nice touch adding the police investigation to it I thought and this is just overall a better version of the movie. There are some scenes to the movie that make this a much better film.

Of course, everyone is has the right to their own, as for me, I feel this is the better of the two movies and had it been given proper budgeting, would have in every ones thoughts been one of the greatest King movies to hit the screen.

Angela Bettis as Carrie White is an odd blend of Mousiness, Beauty, Innocence & Freakiness with a heaping bit of trepedation. She is truly an outcast & is also prone to weird, nightmarish, telekinetic seizures. Although the ending seems trite to some, I actually prefer it. I was a bit of a pariah in school, myself, with very few friends & I always sat alone at lunch. Carrie had it worse; NO friends & a really crappy home life. I like the more modernized, somewhat edgy feel, the fact that it was truer to the book (which I've never read but nonetheless heard about), the ""good"" people survive (mostly, except for Tommy). I like the less tragic ending because I wanted to see Carrie given another chance at redemption & renewal. The old '76 film was effective but a complete downer. As far as Margaret was concerned, I prefer the old Piper Laurie version but Lara Clarkson's take is effective in that she could look so nice, quiet & longsuffering, normal even, then suddenly....""SLAP!"" (hitting Carrie) or ""DUNK!"" (drowning Carrie), etc. , thus you are more on edge with Clarkson's version (because she's so unpredictable, unlike the loopy Piper Laurie verson).

Carrie's tormentors are more cruel in their treatment of the hapless girl, while Margaret White seems more 'sane' in her religious mania than how Piper Laurie played the role in 1976. If a fanatic can be considered balanced, Patricia Clarkson pulls it off admirably.

The abuse and victimization of Carrie herself shows in Angela Bettis' eyes throughout the movie. The character's fear of her entire world can almost be felt through the screen from the start of the movie, making her unenviable and almost pitiful. So when Carrie starts defying her mother, you can't help but root for her. By the time of Carrie's final humiliation, it's hard to keep from cheering as the town and its horrid citizens go up in flames. And with an ending different from the book and first movie version, the viewer can easily breathe a sigh of relief that in some twisted way justice has been served.

It seemed to validate the mother's religious fanaticism, and I do not believe it was what  Carrie, as a character, deserved.  The 2002 remake reinforces my view on this, since it shows more clearly than did the 1976 film that Carrie's rage-driven power, when it reaches its full-blown form, is involuntary.  One can argue that leaving the remake open-ended for a planned TV series, which never got off the ground, was a mistake that leaves it unsatisfying, but I still prefer this more humane take on the story to the religious cheap shots in the original.",1174348800,,752,5.040322580645161
1888358,5,B00009QG7P,"Stephen King's ""Carrie"" is among the top tier of horror novels ever written, but the 2002 remake version of the tale surpasses the original novel.  Not to mention soaring past the original filmed version from 1976, which was loaded with talent on both sides of the camera but just couldn't capture the tension or emotion of the novel.

  This is actually one that I only saw fairly recently.  With it being a made-for-network-tv movie, I always kind of assumed it was going to be 'horror-lite', like the style of theatrical movies that were so popular in the late 90s.  There were only a few of those I really got into, so the ""Carrie"" remake, while not something I was trying to avoid, was just never very high on my to-see list; I ended up renting it on a day when there were virtually no other horror movies in the video store I hadn't already seen.

  From the first few moments onward, it becomes clear that this isn't an ordinary tv movie or mini-series.  It's not on the light side either; either the DVD is extended or the backwards slide in what gets on tv hadn't really started in 2002.  With Angela Bettis giving a stunning, award-worthy performance in the title role, ""Carrie"" is a riveting, frightening, and visually awesome tour-de-force that strikes at the heart and mind in a way that I've seen very few made-for-tv movies do.  The story of ""Carrie"" is well-known but it's deeper and more affecting than can be conveyed in a few short words.  The dysfunctionally shy, lonely, and anguished - and secretly telekinetic - Carrie Whyte is scorned and tormented by her peers at school, and berated and shamed at home by a mother who's own interpretation of religion is so twisted up she makes the world's most conservative televangelists look like Marx-quoting happy-go-lucky hippies.  The question isn't If the repressed rage in Carrie is going to become too powerful for her to contain, but when and how.  And it's after her life starts to improve only to be plunged into an even deeper pit that it's likely to come out.

  The movie follows the book in operating in two timeframes - the bulk of the story going through in normal linear mode, with occasional flash-forwards into the future to show an ongoing investigation into catastrophic events that occured on Prom Night.  The climatic last twenty-five minutes is jaw-dropping, much better than the same period in the novel (the only significant flaw in the novel, I thought, was that the events of that night took a sudden drop in its climatic end chapters right when things should have been at their most mind-blowing).  The last twenty-five minutes have to be seen to be believed.  Another change is that the number of sympathetic characters has been upped a bit - and they've been made more credible - than in the book or the previous remake.  Despite those changes, it's very faithful to the spirit of King's novel - more than a lot of adaptations - but it's got the different hooks to make it feel so fresh.  Everyone involved in this did smashing work, and they've created an all-time great, far better than I ever anticipated.

1888365,1,B00009QG7P,"Certain movies are just so absolutely perfect that it would seem there is no point in a remake (other than greed). See the recent disasterous remakes of THE OMEN, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, THE FOG, THE STEPFORD WIVES, and 2007s HALLOWEEN. One can only anticipate with dread the inevitable remakes of THE EXORCIST, ROSEMARY'S BABY and JAWS.

One of those perfect originals is Brian De Palma classic CARRIE. When I heard about this remake for NBC, I HAD to tune in as it promised to be a train wreck. Forget for a moment that the original is perfect in every way, lets just focus on the fact that the R-rated 1976 classic was made when an R rating in Hollywood could truly be an R-rating and that we were now going to see Stephen King's warning to High School Bullies transferred to the medium best known as ""You Can't Show That On Television!""

The movie opens with Sue Snell being interrogated by the police. This framing device is close to King's novel but it doesn't exactly pan out, as we are often watching scenes that Sue couldn't possibly know anything about. We then have a pan across a classroom of girls that mirrors the camera move through the locker room that opens the previous version. There's some tepid harassment of Carrie, something else, and then we're on to the shower scene, with a repeat of the pan across the locker room. The footage of Carrie discovering her period is a virtual shot-for-shot recreation. It all follows quite closely [as with the first film] the book, although we get the first clue that this version is going to amp things up - when the shower lightbulb explodes with a ludicrous burst of sparks. (Everything here is amped-up, because lightbulbs that simply pop are no longer exciting enough, are they?) In this misguided remake, after the principal bungles Carrie's name to an almost retarded degree, she doesn't just flip an ashtray, she moves a huge desk 3 feet across the floor. Similarly, Later on while being taunted by an obnoxious neighbor kid, it's no longer enough to simply knock the kid off his bike, vicious Carrie X-treme sport jumps him into a tree. (Where is the restraint? Where is Carrie's vulnerability? Not to mention, that if you give too much away in the beginning, there's very little to get worked up over as the story progresses).

The rest of the movie proceeds apace. It takes forever to develop the opening scenes, it skips nearly everything that made up the middle of the De Palma version, and with more than an hour to go, it's already prom night. This leaves out the girls' detention, Tommy and friends shopping for tuxedos, and the gym teacher's relationship with Carrie [in this version, Sue Snell helps her experiment with makeup]. This also leaves out a lot of the emotional resonance to each of these characters that the earlier movie had. There is ultimately no one left to care about and worse, to boo-hiss when they get their just desserts.

Patricia Clarkson as Margaret White is perhaps the worst casting in a remake since Mia Farrow essayed the role of Mrs Blaylock in THE OMEN. I have never known Patricia Clarkson be mediocre in anything. I was forced to ammend my opinion after this. She just not threatening enough. She doesn't even really seem crazy! Sue Snell is now practically a model in the looks department. This also sadly seems to merit a commensurate drop in acting ability. Emilie de Ravin as Chris gets more time than in the DePalma version but she can't compete with the id-driven sex-vixen vindictiveness of Nancy Allen.

There are a lot of moments where the dialogue matches the De Palma version word for word and at those times you really wish you were watching the original film.

Before you know it we're at the prom, where many of the most beloved elements from the first film are sorely missed. Since we don't have much of an emotional connection to Carrie, we are not really involved in her struggle to overcome her fears and try to have a good time. For the same reason, we can have no sense that Tommy Ross may genuinely be falling for her. There is also no heartbreaking (and heart-stopping) slow-motion walk up to the stage after Carrie's name is called, pulled off so beautifully by Sissy Spacek in the original, and there certainly is no expertly choreographed and edited purely visual build-up to the dumping of the pigs blood, which is one of the most amazing parts of the De Palma film. There are a few references to it, and a few shots that mimic shots and sequences from the first film [including a CGI bucket of blood above the stage--what, it is now too difficult to film a bucket of blood?], and then, when the blood is dropped, about 24 gallons spews down for an unending amount of time... pretty amazing they could fit all that in that tiny bucket.

Absolutely the best thing about this film is when it is finally over. (or at least you think it is) THEN, Sue Snell shows up and REVIVES CARRIE. That's right, CARRIE LIVES!!!! Carrie then GOES INCOGNITO in this crazy punk wig and skips town to start a new life! And you start to think ""What, is this going to be the start of a series? Yes, folks...this excruciatingly bad remake was meant to be the springboard for a weekly TV series and you just sat through a three hour failed TV pilot - (I have heard some bad notions in the past for weekly TV dramas -- but CARRIE???) That's a new low even for network television.

As the Amazon editorial very aptly states, why would you waste your time with this hideous trash when you could better spend it with Sissy Spacek (Best Actress Oscar Nomination for her role) as well as John Travolta, William Katt, Piper Laurie (Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for Margaret White), Amy Irving, Betty Buckley (Also later terrific as Margaret White in the infamous 1988 Broadway Musical version) and the pitch perfect Nancy Allen. That one has it all. taut direction by Brian DePalma at the top of his game, great acting and one of the few terrific film versions of a Stephen King novel. Let this Prom pass you by.

We're all sorry, Cassie.",1138320000,11,6058,4.622676579925651
1888396,3,B00009QG7P,"Like ""Dawn of the Dead"", the original ""Carrie"" story is so good that generally faithful remakes like this are still entertaining even if they are not equal to the original De Palma film. And ""film"" is an important word in this particular case because this Canadian remake was shot on digital video instead of film. Each year video technology gets closer to reproducing the look of film but in 2002 it still had a long way to go. Video has a sharper more realistic look than film and a much lower contrast ratio, making it appropriate for documentary and historical films but not so good for expressionistic stuff or stylistic horror films in the Hitchcock and Argento tradition. This could have been a fatal flaw had the remake of ""Carrie"" been a theatrical release or even if it had been introduced to a world of high definition big screen televisions. But most 2002 viewers watched this thing on 19-inch standard definition televisions where these differences are barely detectable.

Both the original and the remake stay ""generally"" faithful to the Stephen King novel so long-time fans will have little to cringe about. On the plus side, the remake does a good job of creating some destruction in the town, something that De Palma could not do for budgetary reasons. On the minus side, the original ending is altered (extended) in a totally contrived way to keep things open for a future television series (maybe Carrie finds her ""Tru Calling"") for which the producers ultimately could not find adequate financing.

Angela Bettis' ""Carrie"" is virtually identical to the Sissy Spacek version. Her performance is at least as good and probably better but the entire supporting cast is so much weaker that it is hard to judge. Bettis is clearly too old for the role but so is everyone playing her high school classmates so it is not a glaring problem. As Carrie's mother, Patricia Clarkson is a poor substitute for Piper Laurie. This is no surprise since Laurie's performance was the best thing about the original but Clarkson's repressed version of the character takes away from the sympathy factor Bettis is going for. The two of them, however, are responsible for the remake's best moment as Carrie mentally slides her mother out of the bedroom and slams the door after her, but not before she warns her to be careful about keeping her fingers away from the slamming the door.

It is a matter of personal choice about whether it is best to watch Bettis' incredible performance in ""May"" before or after viewing ""Carrie"". She plays a similar character in ""May"" (including the sewing skills) but the supporting cast and the directing is so much better, making May a more believable, sympathetic, and terrifying character. But Bettis has one truly extraordinary scene in ""Carrie"", watch for the cosmetics scene in the drug store midway into the film.  The camera stays tight on her face for several minutes and the emotional range she cycles through renders any dialogue unnecessary.  She turns a very ordinary sequence into something truly special.

The DVD release of the Carrie remake would have benefited from some serious trimming. They needed a lot of padding to get up to a 2 Hour 12 Minute running length (for a three hour television broadcast) and the DVD authors did not even bother to edit out the fades in and out for the many commercials. There are several useless sequences like ten minutes at the local pig farm.  Better to have used the time to put some dimensionality into the main villains; the really popular kids do not have the time or the interest to harass classmates at the absolute bottom of the pecking order.  King's weakness has traditionally been a failure to adequately explain the motivations driving his villains and the remake had time to address this issue.

The main device for upping the running time was the addition of a post-prom police investigation headed by David Keith in a rather nothing performance. This serves to introduce the real story in a series of linearly told flashbacks and therefore could not be carved out of a re-cut version.

1888397,4,B00009QG7P,"While we Stephen King fans can take things a little too personally when we all know a book to film does not always bridge the way we expect, this almost ""copycat"" (New World's Pirannha favourite example), this movie holds it's own and then some.

While I agree that the original is a classic in it's own right, this version modernizes the setting of the story and I don't believe comparisons are really fair.

The effects are superior tho that is not to say this version is better than the original. However, the acting, atmosphere and mood are retained and perhaps it is best to say that this is simply an update to this classic, frightening story.

Though I cannot substantiate it, there are rumours that this film concludes the way Stephen King had originally wanted to end the novel. Only a rumour and to hard-core fans who know better, if I am wrong, I apologize.

More of an update than a remake, it is hard to fault this version. It is at least as touching and frightening as the original, though fans bicker about the ending.

The actress playing Carrie <sorry, her name escapes me now> is as hauntingly beautiful as Spasek in the original and the ""mood"" of the film is somewhat darker, though not overly so.

Don't let the words ""made for TV"" scare you. This is a thoughtful and faithful remake of an outstanding story and deserves better than what many critics have levelled it with.

1888400,4,B00009QG7P,"..and take it on its own.  It's inevitable to think of Brian DePalma's original scarefest with the Oscar nominated Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie; but if we take this made for TV movie on its own merits and try not to compare it, we may find it's a pretty good movie.  Angela Bettis is mesmerizing as Carrie White, the daughter of a religious fanatic, who made it rain rocks when she was born and also when she got angry as a child.  We obviously know this little girl is something out of the ordinary.  But Stephen King's CARRIE really focuses on the loneliness of being different; of being mocked because you aren't like everyone else; the joy of being accepted at a prom with the handsome hunk Tommy; and ultimately, the irony of revenge on everyone whether they deserved it or not.  The production values for a tv movie are very good, even if some of the CGI effects look a little forced, but director David Carson gives us the portrait of a lonely girl who just wants to fit in, and whose retaliation on a sad bunch of spoiled brats is carried to the extreme.  Patricia Clarkson's understated performance as Margaret White is just as chilling as the over the top fanaticism of Piper Laurie; Tobias Mehler is a likeable and hunky Tommy; Rena Sofer brings a lot of punch to her role as the gym teacher; Katherine Isabelle (Ginger Snaps) is a bitchy Tina, and the young lady who plays Chris (didn't catch her name, but she's currently on the hit series LOST) is also effectively sinister.  Kandyce McClure seems slightly out of place as Sue Snell, and I'm not sure the addition of the police investigation (led by the sturdy David Keith) is necessary.  I also felt the ending paled in comparison to the original (Mama being impaled by knives in a mock effigy of the horrible crucifix she had).  Seems like the writer wanted to shy away from doing the same ending, but didn't come up with one as memorable.

All in all, though, Bettis is magnificent as Carrie, and Sissy Spacek should be proud of her.",1107216000,4,2001,4.518005540166205

1888402,1,B00009QG7P,"I just wanna know..What was everyone else watching? It couldn't have been the same thing I was looking at. This movie is a total mess, and a reminder that they need to stop tampering with classics. The original Carrie with Sissy Spacek was awesome, but this remake is just plain garbage to be blunt about it. This movie really deserves no stars to tell you the truth. I'm not really concerning myself with the book, but I do know the original Carrie inside out, and if you're gonna remake that then you could at least do it right. I understand that it was only a T.V movie, but that's all the more reason they should've left it alone. Those cheesy special effects were just dreadful, and them having Carrie walking down the street terrorizing the whole town was definitely NOT! a nice touch. Please, they had this girl walking through the town throwing around and burning down everything. That's some telekenesis HUH!. That was way over the top, and Carrie didn't do all that in the original because she was in a trance, or some state of shock. Another thing is that Carrie's mother was not that memorable in this one. In fact, I have no idea who played her character at all because this movie was full of unknown people. However, Carrie's mother in the original seemed more deranged which was kinda terrifying in it's own right I think. You can't take a movie that's already been made like 20 years ago, wreck the story, and then say it's more like the book. If that's the way it was intended to be they would have made it like that the first time. This movie is a poor excuse for a remake to me. On top of that, Angela Bettis really needs to be stopped because I just watched that horrible movie ""May"" that she also was in, and I have to say that was crap too. The most they did in reference to the old classic was use some of the lines from the script, but other than that I hated the rest. I'm still in such disbelief at how they destroyed this movie. Carrie actually was alive at the end and riding down the highway to another state, and we all know Sissy Spacek didn't make it. I could bash this movie all night long, but the last thing I will say is the next time someone gets the bright idea to make a horror classic into a made for T.V movie, someone really should tell that person to think again.",1099180800,7,2306,4.327944572748268

What a great, updated version of the Stephen King novel...lovingly yet innovatively produced with great performances, special effects and direction.

A bit overlong (it was a TV miniseries), but wonderfully executed.  The ending was not as satisfying as the original, but it remains a great story of terror and vengeance, well worth watching.",1098316800,16,506,5.367088607594937

Kind of odd it's a remake by MGM(who also made the first one) This version tells the same story but has some more little features that are covered in the book, like the rocks falling from the sky. I thought it was pretty neat. In the original at the prom Carrie goes ballistic and she is kind of in a trance and I tell ya the look on her face scared even me. But in this version she just kind of stands there and don't even move that lock of hair that is in the way. And in this one ya can tell it's kayro syrup and food coloring, when in the original ya had a hard time telling that it really wasn't pig blood. I do like the way this version ends though, Carrie does not die in the house with her mom and that's pretty cool to leave it open like that. I'll have to read the book by Stephen King and see how this movie is really suppose to happen. One bad thing in this movie is ya can tell when the TV stations insert commercials because there is a black screen every 12 or so minutes in the movie that discouraged me somewhat.",1097971200,2,1146,3.965367965367965

This TV version falls under the same category as the Sci-Fi sequel to ""Firestarter,"" but definitely holds more value to Carrie fanatics like myself.

First off, this vesion is more inclusive as far as holding true to the novel. The camerawork, one might notice, is a tad amateur, but behind the special effects, brilliant performances (especially on Bettis and Clarkson's part), and music that strangely resembles that of the original films--one hardly notices the flaws of this ""modern remake.""

The DVD contains no special features, regrettably, but does have some MGM trailers that might encourage you to visit the video store.

1888431,4,B00009QG7P,"Come to think of it, I was reminded of ""The Attack of the 50 Foot Woman"" after the famous prom scene--even when I read the book (which I highly reccomend).  Though I enjoyed the original film that was made by Brian DePalma, whom I always felt was a modern-day Hitchcock. I also enjoyed this new movie about Carrie.  Movies have been remade since their invention.  And why not?  I like watching how other directors handle the source material.  This new take on the novel was very good and very close to the novel except for the ending--which I didn't mind. The direction and camera work in the new Carrie is refreshing, real, and very atmospheric.  The hazy light in study hall, the greenness of the institutional lights in the interview room, the shadows and light in Carrie's house, the surreal use of blue-screen backgrounds all contribute to make this film play like an odd bad dream.  Angela Bettis was remarkable in her portrayal of Carrie.  Many folks complained that the other characters were played all wrong--well, that is wrong!  And you would know that if you read the novel.  Far more improved on the original was the relationship between Chris and Billy.  The acting in this movie is excellent and the young cast is very talented.  Being a miniseries, there was more time to flesh out characters and actually do the some of the scenes that DePalma wanted to do back in the 70's but couldn't do to time constrants and hasseling from the studio.  I bought this DVD and I have it next to the DePalma movie on the shelf.  My only complaint is that there were no extra features other than ads for upcoming movies.  I even liked the music.  Some peaople think that both Spacek from the original film and Bettis here were both too pretty to be Carrie but the Carrie in King's novel wasn't ugly though, she was only on the plump side.",1081296000,,1839,4.560975609756097

The DVD really has no extras so far from what I can tell except for some trailers on other movies such as ""The Howling"" and ""The Fog"". Amazon states that this DVD has ""TV spots"" on the DVD but I have yet to find them which means that there aren't any TV spots on the disc or they're hidden.
The picture quality isn't all that great though considering this was made for TV I guess I'll let it slide. This is a bare bones disc that only fans of the remake will probably buy.

1888434,3,B00009QG7P,"Like a good number of remakes of classic movies, especially in the horror genre, the 2002 NBC-TV remaking of CARRIE is a problematic film.  The basic allure of Stephen King's first novel, which touches on religious fanaticism, high school fascism, and telekinesis, is as relevant now as it was in 1976, when Brian DePalma's film was released.  Even a good premise, however, can be derailed by mediocre execution, as was the case in the TV remake of THE SHINING or in the 1999 ""sequel"" THE RAGE: CARRIE 2.
Angela Bettis does a good enough job as the tormented Carrie White.  Given that she has some pretty big shoes to fill, namely those of Sissy Spacek who had received an Oscar nod for the role in 1976, I think Bettis does better than most.  Patricia Clarkson is fair as the unglued Margaret White, although her low-key insanity still might make one pine for Piper Laurie's extremist performance in the first film.
But for me, what undid this film were not only the many politically correct cosmetic changes to the identities of her torturing classmates (the Sue Snell character is African-American here), but the fact that the bucket of blood scene is poorly done.  When it's poured on Bettis, it just looks like what it is--red syrup.  In the original, when the blood hits Spacek, it slams into her like a tidal wave (thanks to DePalma's slow motion), creating such an emotional impact that caused that film to transcend the mere boundaries of horror.
The CARRIE remake is thus forever in the shadow of the original, even as Bettis' performance stands on its own.  It is an okay film, even for TV; but for a true combination of horror and drama, the 1976 original is still the one to watch.",1076630400,,1694,4.6644295302013425

I loved the original, but this one is so much better.  I have read the book, and this one follows the book pretty much to the t.  For instance, in the shower scene, they weren't supposed to yell ""PLUG IT UP!"", but rather ""period"" over and over.  Also, the way the mother dies follows the book rather than the original.

1888437,4,B00009QG7P,"First off I have to say that I LOVE the 76 version of Carrie! It has to be one of my top 5 favorite horror movies of all time! And for me this re-make was highly anticipated! It was all I could think about since I had seen the previews on TV and it lived up to my expectations, which were high, but I knew it wouldn't surpass the origional! Well, it basically is a mirror image of the first but it follows the book more closely! And I love the book aswell. Well Carrie is a social outcast with a Jesus freak as a mother ( I mean no disrespect in that I am a Christian myself ) and Carrie has telekinisis the ability to move objects with the mind. So, she has her first period in the locker room one day and everyone makes fun of her and fills her locker with tampons and they are just very cruel to her. And it is clearly noticible that this is an updated re-make with talk of Freddie Prinze Jr. movies and the songs, that this is modern day rather than taking place back in 1976. So of course sex is brought up a few times and rumors that Sue and Carrie are in a lesbian relationship and stupid things like that that could have been left out and still the movie would have been good. And I like the feel of this movie more than I do the origional, the color I like better, but the way it was filmed is odd, it's like someone was holding the camera the whole time and never put it on a solid holder, cuz the camera is always moving and at times it can get frustrating. But the music is good and so is the acting, except from Carries mom, she could have been a lot more agressive like Piper Laurie in the origional. But everything was good and Carries rampage over the school and town was very realistic and very good looking. I only have a problem with the ending. SO stupid and completely different from the 76 versiona nd I hated the end!!! That was what gave it my **** rating! But it is still a very good re-make! They did the right thing by putting it on TV cuz it wouldn't have done very good at the box office! I'm glad they decided to put it on DVD and VHS!
