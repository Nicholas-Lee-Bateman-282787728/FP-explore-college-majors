8243026,3,B0011Z5NKK,"The technique they teach is basic, we like it a lot and feel like we can expand from this once we learn more about massage.  The only issues were that: 1) they go super fast (so just be ready to pause and rewind if needed) 2) it would have been nice to just have a full massage shown, man or woman.  The massages are ""incomplete"" in the man and woman segments, it would have easier to follow if they just showed one massage from beginning to end.  Again, the technique and explanation of the massages were great, but the DVD was hard to follow.",1483142400,,544,4.211538461538462
8243027,2,B0011Z5NKK,"Bought as a gift.  Feedback is ""Poor"".  It is worse than a beach suntan scene.  Massage technique on foot and back is nothing unknown.",1477872000,,134,4.5
8243028,1,B0011Z5NKK,Moved way too fast to follow and at times simply says 'now do the same on the other side'! Hard to pause the dvd and do that with massage lotion all over my hands! Not impressed.,1456099200,,178,3.9722222222222223
8243029,4,B0011Z5NKK,"Some helpful guides and instructions. Tastefully done.  It moves very quickly, so it is rather important to have a remote with a pause button.  Otherwise, it will be a very rapid massage.",1438041600,,187,4.8125
8243030,5,B0011Z5NKK,"Reading instructions for massage makes learning to massage far more difficult. Watching someone give a massage is far more instructive. This DVD focuses on massage for men and women and what works best for each. Modesty is preserved with a towel or robe. Watching massage is apparently very relaxing, I almost fell asleep. Imagine how good you will feel giving and receiving a massage after watching this DVD. I'd suggest you watch this together with your partner and then try it out. Watching it together will open up communication about which massage techniques you prefer. This was filmed at L'Auberge Del Mar Resort and Spa in sunny Southern California by the sea. You will want to go there after you see how beautiful it is there.

8243032,4,B0011Z5NKK,"This video strikes a good balance between providing information, and making the massage look like something you'd like to give/receive!  My husband and I are both happy.",1401235200,2,169,5.2592592592592595
8243033,5,B0011Z5NKK,"The techniques are very good and someone with some experience (or a massage therapist) should be able to follow along, however, if you are new to massage and using this dvd to learn you will probably need to pause or rewind it a bit because it is rather fast paced, if is it being viewed as a learning aid. Overall, it is worth purchasing and beautifully produced.",1371254400,2,364,4.447761194029851
8243034,3,B0011Z5NKK,"I'm a massage therapist and I bought this for my wife so she could work on me. It's filled with solid instruction, but they sold themselves short; this could have easily been a 90 minute video if they didn't move so fast. This can be solved by pausing, but then you lose the music and you end up with an oiled remove if you don't first cover it with a sandwich bag.",1357257600,4,365,4.083333333333333
8243035,2,B0011Z5NKK,"I was expecting much more from the description and the cover.  I guess it just proves, you can't judge a book (or a dvd) by it's cover...",1290643200,3,137,4.074074074074074
