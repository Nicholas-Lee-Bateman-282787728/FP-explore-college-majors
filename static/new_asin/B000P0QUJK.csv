8188080,3,B000P0QUJK,"This is let by Krimmy, not Denise Druce w/help of Krissy (who I like from Denise's Hip Hop DVDs) & some girl named Darla who was the worst dancer of the 3. Krissy has graceful control from dancing school, but a bit stiff here, Krimmy is the most relaxed, but no dancer. (Krimmy led a cardio bellydance dvd by densie druce that had no bellydancing & Krissy ONLY mentioned her years as a fitness instructor, no dance experience.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cardio-Belly-Dancing/dp/B000P0LI38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cardio Belly Dancing</a>) Set in small gym room, basic decor & concrete floor. You'll need a jacket to remove, a chair for balance & end ab work/play & boa for the cool down.
This is only 20 min. including the cool down. You learn to walk, walk with feet more raised which looks like knees are up, but emphasis is on feet. (Krissy just calls it ""knee up"" some basic jazz simple step touches, a lot of single hip rolls, walking around the chair, arching up & down in more sexy way, a lot of shoulder rolls, a decent amount of plies (1 of only 3 moves that require an exertion), a 3 step pivot turn, a fake sit down held & slowly up/down (like yoga chair pose - good toning), and sitting on edge of chair double & single leg lifts (also good toning).
The cool down is 5 min, sitting & easy relaxed arm stretches & movements with a boa... very boring, not sexy, something a grandmother would do that she would think is sexy.

I FFWd though much of this, it did to much walking in circles, etc. The idea is there, there are some good moves, but boring. There is a lot of repetition which is great for a workout, but when moves are easy or boring, you need more moves. This is best for those who don't work out regularly for a somewhat decent toning with a lot of rest and/or those who have no idea to be sexy. There are better videos out there that combine a workout with sexy moves. Jeff Costa, Carmen Electra, Felinity, Urban Striptease, etc.",1199577600,,2004,4.645070422535211
