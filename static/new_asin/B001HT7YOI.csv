3644074,5,B001HT7YOI,Read the book which was intriguing but the film really brings the issue into focus.  Anyone that cares about the direction the country is headed should watch this film!  Besides its powerful message it is also made very well mirroring an Inconvenient Truth.  Great film.,1232064000,2,270,4.955555555555556
3644075,5,B001HT7YOI,This film takes an important look at what has happened to our freedoms.  A clear overview of how the bill or rights has been threatened with executive orders and legislation over the past decade.  A strong reminder that these laws are still in effect even though the administration has changed.  A must see for anyone who cares about America!,1231718400,2,342,4.762711864406779
3644076,5,B001HT7YOI,"The time is running out on our freedom and the democratic republic that we all love.  Folks this isn't about political ideology or any sort of partisanship, it's about waking up and realizing how fragile our way of life really is.  People say the founders would roll over in their grave if they saw the United States today, quite the contrary, they would know EXACTLY what was happening with one glance at the current political climate.  As evidenced by the document they forged this beautiful nation with, the Constitution.  We have to stand up and recognize this very soon, the time is running out!!  BUY THIS MOVIE, AND MAKE ALL YOUR FAMILY, FRIENDS, CHURCH BRETHREN, AND ANYONE WATCH IT.",1229212800,2,691,4.773109243697479
3644077,4,B001HT7YOI,I caught the film at a sold out screening at the Hamptons International Film Festival and was blown away. I am a huge fan of the book because it is provocative and an easy read but often a little dry BUT the film has been adapted brilliantly and it is gripping and brilliantly crafted. Even with the election behind us this film is even more important now because ... what now?,1227052800,5,377,4.323943661971831
3644078,5,B001HT7YOI,"This was one of those books that I knew was going to upset me but I had to read it.  Ms. Wolf makes a strong case that we are at the brink of losing our democracy; it is justifiable to compare the current neo-conservative movement in America to past repressive regimes.  Some of her points:

Black Water, the vigilante group with billions of dollars in their war chest has the ability to take down third world governments and yet owes no allegiance to our constitution.

Countless laws have been broken by our White House and yet no one is held accountable (illegal wire tapping of Americans; misleading Americans into the Iraqi war; torture; outing a CIA agent for political gain; etc.)

Corporations controlling all our media and therefore the flow of information ""We The People"" receive.

The tampering of our free elections (voter machine fraud, the Supreme Court illegally over riding our democracy and appointing George Bush President; the selective removal of Americans from voting lists; etc.)

Ms. Wolf's point is that these attacks are done boldly and deliberatly to frighten and intimidate Americans into doing nothing.

I found this book to be most terrifying because most Americans aren't even aware that there is a problem.  There is a deliberate move in this country to wipe out middle class America (unaffordable educatuion, the end of pensions, the attempt of President Bush to convince Americans that Social Security is bad; unaffordable health insurance, etc.) I hope this DVD release acts as a wake up call to all Americans.",1224720000,18,1544,4.976653696498055
3644079,4,B001HT7YOI,"And as with any documentary there are things that are against this premise, it is a very good one indeed but in the long run what good did it actually do when the people that cause the problems do not go to jail, Bush did not, Cheney did not, Rumsfeld did not, Hillary did not, Gonzalez did not, John Yoo did not and they are the ones that they have on tape making the statements, sure the Patriot Act was blocked with certain provisions but they are still using it and we are still in Afghanistan 11 years (going on 12) after the fact and Gitmo has still not been shut down and they are still using the Patriot Act in certain provisions are they not? As I said: What good does it do, there are still crimes being committed by our leaders and they are still in power.",1369267200,,767,4.154362416107382
3644080,1,B001HT7YOI,"I have never watched a documentary where fear is such a motivating factor. Science tell us that fear of the unknown, or fear someone or something's that are different from you or what you are used to, skews our judgment and actually dims our higher critical reasoning skills and causes us to rewire, many times fraudulently, our memory circuits.

Naomi Wolf even admits that she wrote the book in ""desperate heat"" and ""haste"" because of an ""extreme emergency"" that she perceived was happening. So what had made her so scared???? A friend of her compared Bush to Hitler - YUP five minutes into the video and Reductio ad Hitlerum has reared its ugly head. Are you frickng serious - is this what passes for intelligent thought on the far left??????

But Naomi wolf KNOWS very clearly why she is doing this - because a counterpart of fear is anger; and Hitler not only instills fear in people but also raises their anger. By making someone angry and fearful, scientist tell us that we lose even more of our critical thinking abilities and this is highly important for Ms. Wolfe to inculcate her already low-information audience.

But it gets better, Naomi Wolf who has NO degree in foreign affairs, history or political science starts to lecture us all that she has found the secret code of instituting a dictatorship. She in fact says ALL dictatorships have followed this exact same formula, just no one has noticed this but her. Wow aren't we blessed to have her educating all of the experts in this field, what would we do without her??????

So what are these ten steps:

1 Invoke an external and internal threat.

One thing was crystal clear about how the left and right responded to 9/11. The left responded out of fear, Michael Moore wrote a book and did a documentary about how scared he and his fellow leftists were. Pundits didn't understand that terrorists want to do real harm to citizens of democracy. That is how terrorism works people - it creates fear and terrorize the ignorant and watching how the left walked around dazed and confused and lashed out in irrationality was stupefying.

In probably the strangest of all comparisons she said that the American government went on to instill fear into the people by educating them and alerting them to what was once a unthought-of of threat. Education is now the problem, but it gets better she compares us to Israel where the citizens live on high-alert everyday because of this threat, they all have mandatory m military service and many carry concealed weapons. Having been to Israel many times and knowing quite a few Israelis the amount of ""fear"" Americans live in is 1/1000th of what they live in.

""In Israel, staying alert for terror is a way of life""
(usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/04/16/israel-approach-terrorism/2087617/)

She continues to explain why she is so fearful (Note: she is the one driven by irrational fear here), the patriot act which according to her has similarities to Nazi Germany. LOL - it's obvious she doesn't know history but it's also obvious that she has remained silent after President Obama renewed and strengthened the patriot act. To help spread her fear to you she makes a bunch of specious claims, can the government wiretap? Yup with due cause, nothing changed. Do they do electronic surveillance ? Yup, Google echelon program set up by Bill Clinton, everything over the airways is not protected but that is nothing new. Can the government subpoena your medical records, yes if the show due cause, no change, same with bank, credit card and library book records. Of course she claims they can do this without a warrant or probable cause but that is false in 99.999999% of the cases.

One also has to ask - do you personally know anyone who has had their rights taken away because of the patriot act????????

Over and over again Naomi Wolf tells us how she was scared, not by the actions of our government but by the actions of rogue nations and terrorists, yet she strangely she doesn't look at these terrorists as the problem, instead it's the free democracies around the world that stand up to them and fight them that are the real bad guys.

2. Secret prisons where torture takes place

Naomi wolf claims that ""we now know that America tortures, tortures grievously"" She cites Guantanamo as being a secret prison. If course if it was secret how come everybody knew about it????? Secondly she has to redefine torture to include water-boarding, something we do to our own special forces in training. Thirdly she forgets to mention that only three people were ever water-boarded and the information they told us foiled some major terror plots. By the way what is the official definition of torture: ""Torture is the practice or act of deliberately inflicting severe physical pain and possibly injury on a person"" The unarguable fact is that water-boarding does not inflict ""severe physical pain"".

She also tries to blow smoke up people's bungholes when she claims that foreigners are foreign land actually have US constitution rights. The sad part is nobody in her audience challenged her at this ludicrous and false statements. In facts, Americans who are arrested in other countries fall under that countries rights and systems. This led to another comparison to Hitler and Nazi Germany. At that point I just gave up.

I'm sorry but no thinking person should stand for such outright distortions, lies and logical fallacies. The only people that might enjoy this are extreme leftist, the severely uneducated and those driven by fear and emotionalism. For the thinking, rational and logical this documentary has nothing to offer.",1366761600,4,5632,4.882722513089005
3644081,5,B001HT7YOI,"If you would like a quick, down & dirty, in your face list of some of the things our government is doing wrong today. Then get this documentary, and decide for yourself.
I found Naomi Wolfs research to br very eye opening and chillingly infromative.
Net Flix used to carry it, they don't any more. go figure",1351468800,,307,4.4035087719298245
3644082,4,B001HT7YOI,"I really thought President Obama would substantially dismantle the Bush rush to what will may well end up as a right wing dictatorship, just as this movie portends. Hasn't happened. Not one bit. If not Mr. Obama, then whom? One thing's certain. Left to drift, with our politicians kicking almost every can down almost every road and all the decisions being made behind closed doors as faits accompli, we the people are left adrift and bereft. So we edge towards more disorganization, more fear and therefore a great chance of the end of our civilized, educated, democratic and functional society. As she said, this is not a ""Left vs. Right"" situation. This is about the fabric of culture itself. Scary stuff.

My only criticism of the documentary is that there is perhaps too much stage time and not quite enough field work. But the points are well made nonetheless.",1292889600,11,866,4.8120805369127515
3644083,5,B001HT7YOI,"This is a great movie, and also made a great book. Wolf basically goes over the 10 steps every would-be dictator implements to close down an open and free society. Very scary stuff, especially when she went into the burning of the Reichstag, the ""disappearances"" of journalists, and the putting of people on the ""watch list."" Highly recommended movie.
There was an Amazon reviewer that said this was nothing but ""liberal drivel."" I completely disagree. It is not right-wing nor left-wing. Those things don't matter...they are only there to blind us from the truth, methods of control put in place so that Americans will bicker and argue with each other, pitting brother against brother. For what it's worth, it is a warning, not only to the ""young patriot"" described in the title of the book, but to all people living in the U.S. Dictatorial government is coming - count on it. This will give you a historical perspective on what happens when people don't intervene in time and put a halt to fascism.",1269993600,6,1000,4.786127167630058
3644084,4,B001HT7YOI,"In her 2007 book THE END OF AMERICA, Naomi Wolf listed the ten steps regimes such as the Bush Administration took to lead a nation away from democracy. The steps are in CAPS followed by examples of the Bush gang's methods:

1) INVOKE AN EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL THREAT
The ""War on Terror""

2) ESTABLISH SECRET PRISONS
The ""Extraordinary Rendition"" program

3) DEVELOP A PARAMILITARY FORCE
Blackwater

4) SURVEIL ORDINARY CITIZENS
Warrantless wiretapping, which Bush started before September 11, 2001, and not after, by the way(despite what the corporate media says)

5) INFILTRATE CITIZENS' GROUPS
The film FAHRENHEIT 9-11 depicts one example, the peace organization that learned a member was undercover law enforcement

6) ARBITRARILY DETAIN AND RELEASE CITIZENS
The 2004 Republican convention, where New York City police arrested people just for being on the street

7) TARGET KEY INDIVIDUALS
Bush administration whistle-blowers lost their jobs and careers

8) RESTRICT THE PRESS
The moneyed interests controlling governments such as Bush's have bought up major media

9) CAST CRITICISM AS ""ESPIONAGE"" AND DISSENT AS ""TREASON""
This relates to step 8, press restriction, as the corporate-controlled media follows Bush administration-dictated talking points, personally attacking Bush critics because it is impossible to refute their arguments

10) SUBVERT THE RULE OF LAW
George W. Bush has misused the presidential signing statement privilege hundreds of times as an excuse to violate the law; the corporate media (step 8, again) barely reports it, as pleasing the Bush gang means further deregulation and greater profits

One year later Naomi Wolf followed up with another book, GIVE ME LIBERTY, where the author applied what she taught in THE END OF AMERICA. You could consider THE END OF AMERICA the theory class and GIVE ME LIBERTY the practicum.  The second book reported on modern-day patriots standing up to American government oppression.

Now the documentary THE END OF AMERICA comes, as if to combine the two books.  The film features author Wolf explaining the ten steps governments take to close down an open society and includes clips that support each claim. As you view footage from Germany under Hitler and America under the ""War on Terror,"" how much difference do you see?

THE END OF AMERICA D.V.D. is available for purchase here.  Netflix customers can view THE END OF AMERICA on-line and you can also watch it on the I.M.D.B. web site.",1253404800,5,2454,5.2378516624040925

The film is done very well and depicts some horrific images that arouse the senses, yet also includes a few humorous clips that show the ridiculousness of our ex-president, George W.

In The End of America, New York Times Best Selling Author Naomi Wolf chronicles the 10 steps a country takes towards fascism. There was dialogue as recent as the presidential campaign if America was heading towards socialism. The scary part is that much worse has been going on for the last 8 years.

Based on the best selling novel, this chilling documentary is more important to watch now that there is a new administration. The issues brought up in this documentary are challenges President Obama must face, from torture to privacy. This documentary is not so much a way to sway one's politics, but a reminder of how too much power can ultimately lead to the downfall of a nation. I recommend this documentary to anyone who has interest in the Patriot Act and the actions the Bush administration took in the last 8 years.

I had a feeling that the author was cherry picking events and give it her own interpretation that supports a vastly biased agenda, she's determined to paint the Bush administration as evil as Hitler's Nazis reign.  While I do think that it was a dumb, insensitive administration and had a wrong approach to how it would govern this country and poorly weaved its representation to the rest of the world, I don't think they were as evil as the film portrayed them to be.  It was stretching it a bit too far, and that downplayed its credibility a bit for me. Even though I wanted to like it, my skepticism changed only a little by the time the movie was over.

However, there were good moments in the film though, and I found myself nodding along side it at certain parts. I wouldn't say that this is a ""must-see"", but it's definitely more thought-provoking and engaging than your average small-town theater flick.

The underlying thesis is that the political, paramilitary and military conditions in United States in 2008 were similar to the situation in pre World War II Germany and that if we do not change things we could head down the same path.  I found this to be grossly simplistic and misleading in that it ignores the striking socio-economic and nationalistic conditions in post World War I Germany that provided a solid foundation for Hitler and the Nazi party and which simply do no exist to the extent of being prevalent in the United States.

This documentary will stand as one of the important assessments of the past eight years in America's history~and America's fall from grace. With true skill and intelligence the filmmakers create an involving mosaic about the Bush regime while placing it within the context of previous international political regimes who used similar tactics to manipulate history--and peoples' minds.  Ms. Wolf is the perfect guide through the complicated historical events that she persuasively proves were a role model for tactics utilized within President Bush's administration.

""When Laws and Liberties Test Each Other's Limits""

By STEPHEN HOLDEN
Published: December 3, 2008
""The End of America,"" an unsettling documentary polemic about the erosion of civil liberties in the wake of 9/11, brings up matters many of us would rather not contemplate in the middle of a financial crisis and on the eve of a new administration. Federal laws enacted during the last seven years that threaten our constitutional rights, it reminds us, remain in effect.

The pointedly inflammatory film, adapted from Naomi Wolf's book ""The End of America: A Letter of Warning to a Young Patriot,"" compares the Bush administration's attempts to discourage dissent and to wield increasingly unchecked power to the events preceding the establishment of 20th-century dictatorships in Germany, Italy, Chile and elsewhere. Without explicitly invoking the word, it implies that since 2001 the United States has drifted toward fascism in the name of fighting terror.",1232150400,6,1778,5.470802919708029

I first saw these two DVDs shortly after release. I agree with MOST of positive 4 and 5 star reviews comprising 91 % of reviewers.
Ill not needlessly gratuitously repeat or echo other reader reviews. Anything from those of the caliber of Naomi Wolf and Daniel Ellsberg is well worth the time of all in fact-based communities - ten years later. Why only 4 stars then?  Well, its all talking head with zero graphics. Although its nice seeing what speakers look like audio alone suffices. Some of the critical reviews raise points worth consideration. But one negative review, in particular,  is useless and does not contribute to an analysis of merits or deficiencies of Naomi Wolfs scholarly work.

Telling us that its negative with a leftist slant lacks specificity or a definition of what leftist means to the reviewer who doesnt like it.
