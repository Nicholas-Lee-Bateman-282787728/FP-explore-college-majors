8633650,3,B000UANYOY,I bought this because part of it was filmed on the deserted island on the OBX of NC where my Grandfather was born. The Portsmouth Island scenes were nice but the film isn't exactly an Academy Award winner.,1530662400,,205,4.421052631578948

8633652,4,B000UANYOY,"When ""Alligator Eyes"" was first shown back in 1990, it made quite an impression for it's twist on the buddy-road-film genre. For whatever reason, the picture is forgotten today; even this bare-bones dvd took forever to come out, and when it did, noone noticed. But ""Alligator Eyes"", seen today, has lost little of it's quirky charm and remains a thoroughly engaging (if a bit odd) experience. One wonders why the lead actress never went on to any success, and why one of the actors moved on to Zima commercials, but who said life was fair? Recommended.",1234828800,3,552,4.760416666666667
