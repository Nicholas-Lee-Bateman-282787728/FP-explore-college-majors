4586335,2,B00565RXBI,"My 4 year old, who liked the other preschool prep dvds (letters, numbers, etc.) was quickly bored with the blends dvd. The animations are monatonous and unclear. For example it shows a ""pr"" that is prying open a box for a lengthy period of time but never actually says the word pry. I was expecting a ""y"" to pop out of the box and have it form the word along with the pronunciation, but instead there were just gift boxes. When preschool children don't understand they lose interest.",1309996800,2,483,4.5
4586336,5,B00565RXBI,My two year old has learned so much from this entire series. This is a great addition. They run 65 minutes- much longer than the others. I shelled out less than ten bucks each for these 3 new ones at a popular warehouse store!! So this is pricey!!,1309392000,9,247,4.166666666666667
4586347,4,B00565RXBI,"Many people argue that they should not add a vowel sound at the end of the blend.  I've personally found it helpful with my son (he is 4).  He has zero trouble reading blends after watching this video.  The only thing I take issue with is that at the end they have the ""blend game"" and they only introduce the long vowels on the tail end of the blends.  I wish it introduced the short vowel sounds as well or even INSTEAD of the long vowels.

These videos REALLY hold my children's attention (3 and 4 years old) and even my 3 year old is picking up on blends and digraphs with the videos.  I ended up buying the whole set of 10.  I absolutely love them!",1461196800,4,653,4.094488188976378

4586354,3,B00565RXBI,"It's not awful or anything, but my 5-year-old only watched it because he was actually feeling motivated now that he can see while reading at school that he needs to know this stuff. But it's not really interactive in any way so you're just sitting there watching it show you some words that use blends (with cartoon graphics of the words being used). Probably better for younger kids.",1448409600,2,384,4.661764705882353
4586355,5,B00565RXBI,Homeschooled my daughter and this was a wonderful learning tool.,1445126400,,64,5.5
4586356,4,B00565RXBI,"I love these videos and so do my kids. They are mildly entertaining for them so its not too much torture  (haha).  So with that said, my only problem with this video is they are teaching *some* of the blend sounds incorrectly. They are adding a vowel sound to the end of a lot of the consonant blends. For example ''cl'' is only supposed to have two sounds, the ''c'' and the ''l'' together. They add a vowel sound and the end of it and that is incorrect. They pronounce ''cl''  - ''cluh'' . nononono. lol  or ''fr'' is supposed to sound more like ''fir'', not ''fruh''.

I was pleased, as I was making lunch to hear my 5,6 and 7 year olds correcting the tv. lol Yay some stuff I've taught them did sink in! lol (i homeschool them)

That being said, no consonant sounds are supposed to end in ANY short vowel sound and it drove us all crazy with this video. They only did it with some of them so it makes no sense at all why they did this. I've noticed that the incorrect way of saying the sounds did trip my oldest up in reading last year, so thats when I discovered you have to be very diligent when you pronounce the consonant sounds or else they will be adding all kinds of sounds that aren't there actually in the word and get confused. So, if you are going to use this to help teach your kids to read, then maybe pause it and explain it when they do it incorrectly.  Not to be all nit-picky but it does technically matter.",1440374400,2,1428,4.1521739130434785

4586381,1,B00565RXBI,It blends only part of the work. For example. If the blend focus is ch...they would say ch...but then if the rest of the word is checker..they blend the ch part...then they say checker...they don't blend ch then ecker...then say checker...they skip a vital part of the blending process and I will not be purchasing anymore of meet the blends. I have purchased meet the letters..numbers. .blends and site words. This is the only series I didn't care for. If I could..I would give it a zero star rating.  That is how unhappy I am with this dvd.

By the time she turned 3 a couple months ago, she started attempting to sound out words.  Between this and her site words videos, she is already starting to read.  I love that these videos from this vendor will continue to replay until you change it.  The only thing I would change about it is...  each time it plays, it plays the part that is intended for the adults {how their system works}.  Either way, it is highly effective in teaching the children to use more than one phonics sound consecutively {thereby phonetically forming a word}.
IE:  CH + AT = CHAT.  This bridges the gap between just knowing the phonics of a single letter to combining them into a word.",1400284800,,790,4.393103448275862

I bought this and the flashcards and my son was so drawn to the format and was following along in minutes!!! He will ask to watch this video. He is doing so much better with his blends. I am so happy!!! He gets so excited when he figures out the blends... its so gratifying to see how much he has improved.  This video made learning fun for him and he is doing so well now.

Although as an adult I don't always understand how on earth some of the actions performed by the sight word pertain to their meaning, the children do repeat them and remain interested. Whether the words are actually sinking in remains to be seen, however, as they're reluctant to try to read the words for me when we go to the books. At least Meet the Phonics is very clear in the relationship between the words and what is shown.",1391299200,,585,4.4766355140186915

The illustrations capture his attention and he is enthralled.  The first thing he says when he comes in the door is ""Can we watch Phonics?""  It is amazing how well these teach.  I have all of the sight words, the blends, and digraphs.  All are of equal quality.  There are also videos of colors, shapes, and letters from this company.

So for example we might do the numbers dvd one week and the letters next, etc.  My kids have all learned through these dvds.  While we practice all these things on our own, I think nothing we do can replicate the repetitiveness of these dvds.  We limit tv in our home, but I never feel guilty putting one these on so I can do the dishes real quick or something.  In regards to this specific phonics dvd, we love it.  I pair these with the Leapfrog Factory Dvds.  I will say that for friends of mine who have let their children watch animated cartoons from a very young age and then tried to introduce them to these they don't seem to have as much luck with their kids being interested.

When I purchased Meet the Phonics I was disappointed because it appeared that my son thought ""sk"" ""sm"" or any of the blends were words. He would show an adult ""sk"" that he typed on the I-Pad and ask them what was s and k as if it was one of the sight words. When the adult did not know, he would say the sound ""sk"". After 2 times of him watching this dvd, I had him stop because I did not want him to get confused. One day he saw a sign that said ""No Smoking"" when he was trying to pronounce the word ""smoking"" he said ""sm"" and some of the other sounds in that word, he then looked at me and wanted to know what was the word. When he saw the word ""flute"" he did the same thing. He is actually trying to sound out words after watching this. So now I love this video.

4586435,1,B00565RXBI,"I was an elementary school teacher and taught many, many kiddos to read. I was super excited about this series for my eldest child, age 5. Most of the videos have been excellent and helped teach all 3 of my girls letters, numbers, and words. So far, my two oldest girls could read by 3 1/2 to 4 years old, in part due to this series. That said. This video is horrible! It's teaching the children the wrong sounds for the blends. For example, ""dr"" is said ""dr"" not ""drah"". Not to be too technical, but ""dr"" should have two sounds or phonemes (the technical word for a letter sound). ""Dr"" should have the ""d"" sound and ""r"" sound -- btw ""d"" says ""d"" a short sound, not ""dah"" which is two sounds.) Anyway, the video makes the letters have too many sounds. Then, when kids sound out words like ""drink"" they have trouble. The video would have them say ""drah"" and ""ink"" which says ""drahink"". Instead, it should be ""dr"" and ""ink"" which says ""drink"". This sounds super nit-picky, but it really matters to new readers. They don't know what a ""drahink"" is. They will quickly recognize ""drink"". Why would a professional series make reading more difficult for new readers? I recommend all the videos in this series, except this one. I'm severely disappointed and think that the publishers should fix this error immediately. Recalling the product and giving money back would be great too.",1331164800,68,1374,4.5894308943089435

The kids love saying the blends and trying to come up with words with the blends. The video is entertaining not too slow pace but not too fast that the concepts don't sink in. I like the animation and the pronunciation is not a problem I try to watch with them to make sure they are saying each blend correctly. great addition to a dvd collection and I cant wait for the next preschool prep release.,1330819200,,579,4.087719298245614
4586447,1,B00565RXBI,"We should have gotten this before our kiddo was three. There is not enough action to hold a three year old's attention. In addition, as an educator, I sadly agree with the dad below who states that it is not ok that they add an ""a"" sound to the end of each blend. It's incorrect on the video's part. Pl=""pul"" not ""pla"".",1325203200,3,319,4.161290322580645
4586448,5,B00565RXBI,Understanding letter blends is important.  This paired with word world has helped my daughter to read.  She loves the animations and had the letter blends memorized quickly.  Another great product from Preschool Prep.  We also really enjoyed their site words.,1325030400,,259,5.4

4586450,5,B00565RXBI,"The preschool prep DVD's are the best learning DVD's ever! We own them all and my daughter learned all capital & lowercase letters by 1 year old, and all of the sight words before 2 years old, and is learning to read at 3. I am at home with her and we work a little each day but these video's engage her and hold her attention for a long period. I would recommend all the preschool prep DVD's, starting with letters when they are very young is my recommendation and limit all other TV to less than 1 hr a day!",1322956800,2,509,4.0495049504950495

4586452,5,B00565RXBI,"My 3 yr old loves the Meet the Phonics movies (as well as all over Preschool Prep Co). I don't find the pronunciation to be that confusing and they do a good job at trying to distinguish between close-sounding blends.  The ""characters"" are likeable and holds my son's attention. I'd definitely recommend this to a friend.",1318118400,7,321,4.732142857142857

4586454,1,B00565RXBI,"The 'A' sound is incorrectly pronounced at the end of blends that end with 'L.' Like for an example, PL is pronounced 'PLA' and so on forth. This is really disappointing. I don't want my kids to learn these sounds wrong. What a waste of money. Low quality of educational material. Don't buy!",1312416000,6,291,4.509433962264151

4586456,2,B00565RXBI,"first of all, let me just say that I'm a huge fan of this series and i own them all. 'meet the letters' taught my son his ABC's by 14months.  but this particular DVD i find hard to watch and debate whether i will continue to show it to my sons.  most of the blends are pronounced with an 'a' sound at the end where there is none.  they explain their decision,  but i disagree with their choice and it completely ruins the DVD for me.  if you don't care that PL is pronounced 'PLA' instead of 'PUL' then the rest is fine.  but 'please' is not pronounced 'plaease'",1312243200,14,562,4.110091743119266
