8152154,5,B000JMG0ZS,"The quality of these 14 short films vary considerably. My overwhelming favorites are: 1. Gabrielle, which tells a story of an unborn soul who has to make a very important decision! Yikes! 2. Light Of Darkness, a real shocker to put it mildly! You never know who your friends really are until a crisis occurs! 3. Limited, a man finds himself in the afterlife, riding a train to Judgement. (At least God is in favor of mass transit even if  our Federal government is not!)

These three films are truly inspiring. Congradulations on a great  inaugural dvd from the Damah Film Festival!",1160870400,,582,4.686274509803922
