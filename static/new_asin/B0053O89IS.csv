4537932,4,B0053O89IS,"An episode that finally matches the Jeffersonian Forensics team that Bones operates, with an opponent of equal ability.  This episode discovers the killer but fails to take him down, so that is left for future episode, or episodes.  We see The Bones & Booth childbirth is closing in (6 weeks estimated), and the home that Booth finds for them is a massive renovation and restoration project in need of an Architect, and a major building contractor before it can be usable.  I would have liked them to drag back Zack Addey for his intellect to match wits with the new opponent, but sadly not a mention of the old character so many of us enjoyed.  The episode is well written and as always superbly executed by this amazingly talented cast.  The formula still works, the whole story line is open and filled with possibility, so it will hopefully continue on to another season after this.

I have but one criticism, and that is the loving relationship between Bones & Booth doesn't come off as well as Booths past love interests, the intimacy between a couple who have only been lovers for about a year isn't believable. When one factors in that Booth has pined away for all those prior episodes, he doesn't seem to be as elated by his newly established intimacy with the love of his life. It all feels stiff and contrived between them, and it shouldn't.

As for the freebe Finder premier episode, the basic premise is too super hero to be credible. Also these people have No Credible Means of Support.  They 'hang out' at a bar with no patrons, work for a kid who can't pay them, and drive and fly wherever they need to with money being no objection, yet no source for it.  Was there a winning lottery ticket we missed somewhere ?",1327017600,,1728,4.548387096774194

4537934,4,B0053O89IS,Competetive eating in all its disgusting nature made the python look friendly.  It was fascinating since I was not aware such exhibits ever happened.  I never guessed the murderer.,1325116800,3,180,5.172413793103448
4537935,5,B0053O89IS,I have loved this show from the begining. This episode was great. I can't wait for the child birth episode.,1324252800,2,107,4.4
4537936,5,B0053O89IS,"This refreshingly *different* season of Bones is gearing up to be one of the series' best! It is just the reinvigoration the show needed!

Life has changed at the Jeffersonian since we last saw our favorite crime-solvers. After last season's pregnancy bombshell of an ender, we pick up with forensic anthropologist Dr. Temperance Brennan entering her third trimester, hormones all over the place as she bumbles in that adorable way that only Brennan can into the frightening role of motherhood. As always, her partner FBI Agent Seeley Booth is there by her side, more loving and more happy than we've ever seen him. Having them together romantically (FINALLY), is a joy I'm still unable to get over :) It feels... natural. It almost makes you wonder, why wasn't it always this way? (Also makes you forget the angsty love triangle of season 6 ever even happened! Hannah who? ;p)

I think David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel slipped into this new relationship quite easily. What's great is that not a lot has changed, and yet, EVERYTHING has. They live together, they're planning on buying a house, they kiss and cuddle on the couch and Booth croons to Brennan's belly in the cutest baby voice you will ever hear... and yet, they're still ""Booth and Bones"". They still solve murders. They still bicker good-naturedly over everything under the sun. They banter. They get overprotective. They make mistakes- and own up to them after. They're like any new couple expecting a child. But are they normal? Far from it, because at its core, Bones is still the same show: a journey of love between two very different people... one a woman who views the world through utmost rationalism and who is still learning how to open her heart; the other a man who relies on instincts and gut feeling to do his job, and who lets faith and emotion drive his personal life. Both coming from traumatic pasts and both craving a new beginning (""New memories, new life"", as Brennan aptly puts it in episode 1) for this new family they've created. And that unchanging dynamic, coupled with a deep satisfaction after six years of will-they won't-they, is what has made this season so very interesting!

That, and the other characters are still as charming and as ""comedic gold"" as ever. Hodgins and Angela's baby situation juxtaposes nicely with Booth and Brennan's (I'm eager to see Baby Michael and Baby Girl Brennan-Booth growing up together), Cam struggles with keeping the workplace professional, there's a new intern, a new recurring villain, and other familiar faces return! Plus, I have it on good word that the birth of Booth and Brennan's baby WILL. BE. EPIC. Ahhhh!

So yeah. It's funny. It's emotional. It's unexpected. I highly recommend season 7 of Bones! (There's no such thing as a 'Moonlighting Curse'! Bones has proven it WRONG! :D)",1323993600,5,2821,4.870833333333334

4537938,5,B0053O89IS,"I have always loved watching Bones. I love how it has progressed from all about blood to more relationship stuff. As a mother, I am really glad that they brought babies into it...and more family stuff. The actors are amazing and watching Bones since season 1, I have grown to know all the charactors and I am super impressed. Love, Love, Love, Bones. Incredible, enlighting, entergetic, emotional, supensful and amazing.",1323993600,3,420,5.014285714285714
4537939,3,B0053O89IS,"Why oh why, does everything have to get so treacly and cute on American TV? It's really nice to have an intelligent, complicated, somewhat frightening procedural drama without babies!!! Relationships aren't everything.
Little Baby Michael gets to meet his Grand Dad, and that subplot ruined the show. I'm glad that Angela and Hodges are thrilled with their baby, but I don't think he belongs at work. Baby and kiddie issues don't help this kind of drama. It's really annoying.
Does anyone ever watch BBC-TV's procedurals? Luther (Luther) doesn't have babies. Boyd (Waking the Dead) has a son, but the kid never shows up at work. In fact, the kid is missing. MI-5 has a little girl, but interactions with her aren't cutesy.
It seems that on American TV, shows sooner or later have to conform to some saccharine Perfect Little Family ideal, even if it shreds the dramatic composition of the show. Possibly the reason is that the corporations paying for the show are deathly afraid of any controversy and reality, and hogtie the creators. Unwittingly, they make a mess of the shows, people walk, and their very expensive ads go unseen.
I have always LOVED Bones, but I've about had it with the pregnancies and babies. I like gritty, snarky procedurals, like this one USED to be. Remember the Gravedigger series?? I was truly afraid of her. Max made me really nervous.
Now, it's all about sleep deprivation and child rearing theories. Too bad. I'm just going to go wait for Alice Morgan (Luther) to create more mayhem: great fun!!",1323648000,7,1526,4.850574712643678
4537940,5,B0053O89IS,"Now that we have a show that is not oozing unrequited love every instant, i am back to enjoying BONES.  The humor is still intact and we still open every episode with an over the top corpse which no longer has integral flesh (filling the requirement for BONES). This time the Bones are found in the PO's dead letter office. The team has to take it from there. Brennan is still pregnant with Booth's baby and they still have issues, just not the same ones. I also am enjoying Hodgens and Sweets pretty much this season.  Sweets as the FBI shrink has really come into his own this season. He adds something to every investigation. And Hodgens just loves the muck of this job, which is pretty hilarious.  He is either falling in love with some snake and making a home for it or trying out the newest gadget to extract a bone the best. For the future, I think the way to go is to increase Sweets' role even more as the most engaging and freshest character the show has for the future.",1323129600,5,980,4.315217391304348
4537941,2,B0053O89IS,"I have been a fan of this series for a long time.  Last year I thought the season started off slow and then picked up, and I am hoping that this year is the same.  While there is always something distasteful in the show, gore wise I mean, this year, it seems, the writers are really going for shock value.  That is all this is.  Sensationalism.  I have always had a problem with the bed hopping and sexual parts in the show, I have been able to overlook it.  These are not my values, and I certainly don't ever let my children watch or even be around while I am watching.  The stories and the science are interesting.  I loved the comedy and the electricity between the two main characters.  So far, the writers aren't writing this year for the love interest, just the gore.  The relationship between Brennan and  Booth is sterile and cold.  It is almost like she was artificially inseminated after all.  And I don't understand why they don't at least talk about marriage.  I guess this is the carrot that is being held out in front of us all this year. Yes, they live together, supposedly love each other, are having a baby together, but will they get married and live happily ever after?  And I don't care how clinical Brennan is supposed to be, pregnancy usually causes a woman to feel nauseous.  Some of the things I have seen in the last two episodes have made me nauseous, and I am not pregnant. I pay almost two dollars an episode to watch this.  I figure I am going to give it one more episode to see if the shock value subsides and the relationship part becomes more realistic. I'm probably not being realistic.  The bottom line is that I would never have started watching this show if these were the first episodes I saw.  Too bad.",1321142400,2,1741,4.367601246105919

4538294,2,B0053O89IS,"I only recently started watching Bones on Netflix this past year.  Loved the first several seasons but unfortunately it took a sharp downturn in season 6 and a complete nosedive in season 7.  After a build up of romantic tension between the two leads for many seasons there was no culmination to the story shown on screen.  I've never seen a story miss so many beats.  Never...not on any other TV show, book or even movie.  Season 7 starts with Bones and Booth ""together"" as a couple but how they got to that point and all the pivotal moments between them happened off screen.  The scenes between them were suddenly very stiff and the dialogue stilted.  It was very jarring. Episodes from past seasons use to provoke a variety of emotions in me...whether it be joy, sadness, anticipation, shock, awe or laughter.  But season 7 left me feeling mostly disappointed and unsatisfied.  It does get better towards the end of the season....there is a GREAT episode set in Hollywood where a corpse is found during the filming of Brennan's movie. It was definitely the funniest and most enjoyable episode of the season.  I am unsure as to whether or not I will move forward onto season 8 and continue streaming this show. The cast is wonderful but I surmise there must have been some sort of change in the writing staff and the new writers just don't seem to care about showing the pivotal points in the stories.",1469318400,,1403,4.620967741935484

I LOVE LOVE LOVE the idea about Bones and Booth having a baby! (I'm not sure if anyone noticed but I think that Brennen was pregnant half way through last season, I really noticed it on the bowling episode.) I love the interaction between both of them, and I love that they still argue about stuff but I'm kinda dissapointed they aren't as passionate about it! :(
Why oh why did they have to kill off Vincent last year? I miss all of his quirky little sayings and all :(.. and where oh where did all the interns go? Sad, sad, sad...
And what about the season finale? Uuuummmm...... I can't see that, I really can't, wouldn't people know Brennen's face by now? I mean she is an author and all, wouldn't she get noticed wherever she went?
The VERY last thing... WHAT IS UP WITH THE SHORT SEASON? Did writers go on a strike again or what? That and the fact we don't see most of the interns are what takes off that half star (or whole star).",1432512000,,1064,4.246305418719212

I find it provides a pleasant focus during my exercise - I limit myself to an episode every time I exercise. Though I am not into gruesome, their depiction of bodies etc. has major visual impact. Generally the dialog is very entertaining - not always believable, but it is entertainment.
The only episodes I am not a fan of for this or any other series are flash backs with the actors in prior time periods.

4538541,3,B0053O89IS,"I loved Bones at the beginning. Seasons 1 to 4 are the best. Season 5 and 6 are  notch below. This season is horrible, boring and just plain stupid. I understand Ms. Deschanel's desire to have a baby, but having Bones get pregnant ruined it for me.  Until now, her character stood out. The show stood out. Now, it isn't really any different than any other show. And get this, they bring in a new intern that spent two years in a juvenile correctional facility. Since the elite Jeffersonian works for the FBI, there is no believable way that the DOJ and the FBI would allow him to work there. There's suspension of disbelief and this just doesn't for me.
Overall, in my humble opinion, sadly Bones doesn't it do it for me anymore. I rented this season because I had an idea that it wouldn't be worth the purchase and for me it just wasn't.",1430524800,,838,4.365384615384615

I love the Bones series but I'm very disappointed that unlike Seasons 1-6 (and every other TV series I have on DVD), I can't choose individual episodes to watch.  The only way to get to a particular episode is to fast forward/skip.  Previous seasons let you choose the episode you want from the menu.  I thought it might be a flaw in the disc but Season 8 is the same way.  VERY annoying, so that's why I'm giving it 3, even though the series itself is a 5.",1414713600,,570,4.1454545454545455

4539038,5,B0053O89IS,"This is a review about the quality of the DVD production of the ""Bones,"" series not a critique of the show. BUYER BEWARE.
The quality of the ""Bones,"" Season One DVDs is extremely poor. 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment clearly cut many corners during the manufacturing of these DVDs. Every DVD in the set is filled with stutters and gaps. Some of the episodes are completely worthless. 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment chose to use double-sided DVDs that are especially thin which, apparently, caused the DVDs to be unreadable in any of the three DVD players and two computers I tried. DVDs for the remaining seasons are also exceptionally thin and have major stutter and gap problems but are not TOTALLY worthless. For example, two of the Season 7 DVDs will not play at all and the other two have stutters and gaps. I threw Season One away. As a corporation, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment clearly values profits above the satisfaction of their customers. They should be ashamed. I have found other reviews concerning the poor quality of these DVDs but, since most reviews concern the content of the show and not the quality of the DVDs, these concerns are being minimized. I'm trying to call this to the attention of customers and help them prevent the frustration of purchasing DVDs (I bought 1-8) and then discovering that they cannot be viewed.",1405814400,,1359,4.836909871244635

I know that Amazon would have been happy to replace them or refund my money because they are great about such things. Unfortunately, I did not get around to watching these discs until almost one year after the purchase date, which is way past any possible return window. When getting DVDs, make sure to watch them right away, so that if there are any errors, you can get your DVDs replaced!

The cast members are all good actors and that makes it more fun to watch; the writing is consistently good; the plots are interesting, locations vary from the beautiful to the mundane urban areas that are supposed to be Washington, DC Metropolitan.  Once in a while you can spot something that is out of character, for example: in some stories Agent Booth is a reserve officer, while in others he is an enlisted man.  So, he either gets promoted or demoted from season to season.  Nevertheless, I enjoy the show and am sure yuou will, too.",1399766400,,755,4.522058823529412

Normally one star, but there were periods of normalcy approaching 3. Thus we compromised on 2 along with the prenatal grandparenting musical auditions. Oj vhey!!!",1398124800,,528,4.910112359550562

4539509,5,B0053O89IS,"Bones Season 7 is one of my favorite seasons of this forensic science show. It has a great writing with just the right mix of humor in season 7. One of the things that sets the series Bones apart for me is the humor.
Season 7 is interesting with Bones and Booth finally getting together as a couple. When you add her pregnancy, it adds a few twists and allows for great writing in the episodes of season 7. Seasons 4 through 7 have everything firing on all cylinders. There is great character development, great acting, with the writers of the series giving the kind of scripts that everyone can enjoy.
I highly recommend season 7. I hope enjoy it too.",1386720000,,652,4.396694214876033

I'm one who is less interested in the Brennan-Booth thing and much more enjoy the case, science and, especially, the dialogue.  Brennan seemed to have lost both IQ points and social adeptness (what little she had).",1386028800,,374,4.8125

4539573,5,B0053O89IS,"As usual, with so many good reviews, it is hard to find something new to say. I think the main virtue of this shortened season (abbreviated to accommodate Emily Deschanel's real pregnancy)is that it was just the right mix of the old and the new. The old is all the original cast, but with a healthy salting of our favorite recurring characters, Caroline Julian, Max Keenan, Billy Gibbons, Hank Booth (Ralph Waite) and Colin Fisher (Joel David Moore). To this is added Brennan's pregnancy, a brand new relation between Brennan and Booth, and a new, very dangerous, serial killer. I dare not say more about that character, for fear of giving away some important spoilers. I will say that the new antagonist leads to what may be one of the series' most dramatic season cliffhanger, in a show which has had its share of better than average cliff hanger season enders.

I case you did not notice, this season's set has only 13 episodes, instead of the usual 23 - 26. That was due to the hiatus added to allow for Deschanel's pregnancy. What is puzzling is that they did not add in episodes from ""The Finder"", a spin-off created by Hart Hanson which, as far as I can tell, only created 13 episodes. That would have created an very nice 26 episode package.

The jaw-dropping final episode appears to promise that Season 8 will remain fresh, now that the event which seemed inevitable from early in the first season has finally happened, that is, Brennan and Booth become romantically linked in a substantial way, with the risk that that will dull the interchange between them, which ""drives"" the show (that turn of phrase was intentional, since most of their best conversations happen while they are driving, a tradition which dates back to season 1, episode 1, when they were not nearly as chummy as they are now.)",1381017600,2,1808,4.682389937106918

When I first received it I was very excited so I put it in right away, only to find that the first two episodes (which are the most important episodes in a tv series) did not work at all. This was a major let down. you should test your products before you sell them. I was aware that it was used, but there was no indicator saying how poor the quality of the dvd was all that was said about was that there was a small nick in the disc.

4540131,2,B0053O89IS,"This reminds me of M*A*S*H where by the later seasons everyone had blow-dried hair and every episode made a social commentary.  No oily hair, no out of place clothing, even the gore on Bones now looks pleasing to the eye.  No one is genuinely stressed out by the ugliness of human nature, or the converse -- burnt out and not caring.  Everyone's chipper and helpful to each other.  This is not a detective show, things get wrapped up too neatly.  This is not a science show, the teams' capabilities have become too easy and at the same time far-fetched.  The comedy isn't funny.  All that remains is relationships that women would like, all about sensitivity to each other.  No grim professionalism that marked the characters early on.  No mis-fits among the misfits.  This has become a soap opera and a not-very-good-one either.  The only ""up"" side I've seen (and this is contrary to some other negative reviews here) is I believe the acting -- not the character writing, but the acting -- of Booth is better.  I can't even explain why so perhaps it seems that way because everything else has become so inane.",1361232000,,1110,4.664948453608248

First, if these two are living together, why are they still addressing each other using their last names (or ""Bones""). There is no romance in a relationship that has only one thing in common -- a baby. And then Brennan's ongoing stupidity is really getting long in the tooth. It no longer works on any level. Sure, she's an atheist, but she can't related the practices of any of the cultures she's studied to her own life.

4540713,5,B0053O89IS,"Bones is about a forensic anthropologist and an FBI agent who team up to solve crimes with the help of the ""squints"" or other forensic scientists, all of whom have very close and invincible friendships. I only recently began watching Bones and was intrigued from the very beginning. The episodes are always different and equally funny, interesting, and suspenseful. This show is for teenagers and adults, ages 15 and up. It is for the most part clean, but it does have the occasional swear word and in the later seasons, as the characters become more romantically involved, contains quite a bit of talk and sometimes showing of kissing and sensual activity. Other than that, it is a very good tv show and the lead characters Seeley Booth and Dr. Temperance Brennan have a witty relationship that is enjoyable to follow. One last note; in addition to the content described earlier, there are many good and noble qualities portrayed and just duties performed in the show. For example, Booth is a devoted Catholic who has, except for the occasional wrong doing, very good morals and tries to lead the other characters to do the right thing. Overall, I think that if you can distinguish the mistakes from the good in the show, then you will enjoy it immensly. I highly recommend it if you like crime dramas.",1356825600,,1303,4.769911504424779
4540714,5,B0053O89IS,"I liked the 7th season a lot! There's a development of the characters (not all though), the interpersonal relationships take upper hand, but in an interesting way. The relationship between Booth and Bone steps up to the next level. I was not dissapointed by this season and I am looking forward to Season eight!",1356825600,,311,4.777777777777778

4540720,5,B0053O89IS,"In many series, when the two lead characters finally give into a romance, it spells the end of the show (remember Moonlight, and Remington Steel?). This is NOT the case with Booth and Bones. Somehow their relationship adds to the series.

Perhaps this is because their relationship hasn't changed. They're still Bones and Booth. They haven't changed, and the writers don't play up the mushy stuff. The show is still about the crime solving; the relationship just makes it better. It's been fun to watch the emotional changes in Bones. It's good to see her laugh.

This series, and this season are excellent!",1356566400,,607,4.883495145631068

Temperance is incredible sings like an angel, love that episode. Each characters have their own subtle charm and are a perfect backround and foreground for the magnicient Bones and Booth...and with Zach, never saw it coming wow, keep the good stuff going this is one for the long run...",1355702400,,827,4.636986301369863

4540950,3,B0053O89IS,"I was not very involved in any of the episodes.  By involved, meaning, take eight to twelve hours and watch the entire season in one sitting, becuase I could not wait to see what occurred in the next episode.  I found the plots predictable, the characters predictable, the resolutions predictable.  I love the series, and have them all on DVD.  Recommending you wait until the price goes down, then purchase.  Not worth the full price I paid.

And...what happened to all the episodes????  Far fewer amount in season 7.  What the...?!?!?!?",1355356800,3,538,4.835164835164835

4540957,3,B0053O89IS,"The writers of Bones have definately lost focus.  Bones used to be edgey.  Season 7 does not compare to the bold episodes found in at least the first 4-5 seasons.  The quality of the recording is great, the loss of so many episodes because of Emily's pregnancy is disheartening.  The price per episode really goes up.  Still, if you have watched them all like my wife and I have, they continue the saga.  Few new viewers will be interested.  The long term viewers will buy it.",1355184000,3,476,4.465116279069767

(Since this has been out for awhile, I'm going to assume that plot spoilers are a non-issue;  But in any case I don't indicate their impact on the overall plot)

Fractally writing malware on the ends of human bones such that when you do a 3d scan it bypasses all your security and blows up your lab?  Re-assembling elements of a spine in a different order to provide a code just of numbers that oh by the way the staff can identify?

Entertaining? Yes, Worth the time, I think so - But leave your logic circuits at half mast at best.

Definitely not what I'd call the best season of the series, but still compared to Moonshiners or Hog Pickers, gotta say I've enjoyed it.

Different thing here is that previous seasons I've bought I've gone back and watched several times.  This one, not so much.

Plus, Fox has now started incorporating very loud commercials that I get intermittently with the streaming.

Nothing better than sitting late at night, kick  in the show, then have an obnoxious ad blast away at you at full volume.

Doubt I'll get another Fox video for that reason, their products aren't that good.",1354665600,2,1185,4.617224880382775

4541099,4,B0053O89IS,"I was concerned this season would lose some of It's flavor with Booth and Brennan as a couple, as well as parents; though we all longed to see this day... However I was not at all let down by the episodes in season 7. Therebwas romance, mystery, comedy, and reality in Bones/ Booth and Angela/Jack sneaking the babies in to the lab.  I enjoyed being angry with Bones for leaving Booth at the finale!! While understanding it was likely the best decision. Not having seen ANY of the Season 8 Episodes, for want of viewing all of Season 7, before watching even one in Season 8: I anxiously awaited, discovering the outcome of Bones on the run, Booth without his family, and Angela defending her best friend against all odds! It was fantastic!!!! My only reason for giving season 7 a four of five stars, is because there were far too few episodes this time. I'm use to twice as many. Since Emily was ACTUALLY PREGNANT, and likely had leave of absence for maternal reasons, I completely understand: and therefore give 4 3/4 stars for Bones Season 7!.",1354406400,,1045,4.558510638297872

4541143,3,B0053O89IS,"I was a huge fan of the show, but my enthusiasm has drastically waned since the producers decided to make the 2 stars a couple - with child, no less. Without the frictions from the fundamental disagreement between Bones and Booth, the show has lost much of it's fun factor. Those frictions have now become contrived cartoons of the show itself.

4541213,5,B0053O89IS,"My wife and I have been following Bones since season 1 and we loved it very much. The stories are well written, cliff hangers are really heart pounding and best of all, the chemistry among the casts is definitely excellent since season 2 and we can see them grow.

The props, yes, corpses, that are in various level of decomposition (often boney), are highly realistic, in fact to the extent of funny. We sometimes watch this show over meals. No appetite was lost.

Season 7 is interesting as usual, with a little twist or addition to the casts. The return of various equally 'whacky' interns is also welcome.

If I want to 'complain' about this season, it is because of the short season, which is inevitable.

I look forward for more seasons to come!

Well Sir, Everything looked to be in order but upon viewing one disc of Bones was not Bones at all but a disc from Philadelphia.  Both labels looked a lot alike.  So, the question is, can I swap the Philadelphia disc for the missing Bones disc?  The question is, did you sell the Philadelphia series to another buyer?  This Season 7 was gift to a friend and she was a little disappointed as she is a super fan of Bones.  If you sold Philadelphia you'll probably hear from them too unless they don't know yet.  I hope  we can resolve this issue as clearly you are an excellent seller.  Ray Sutton - Email DocRS1951@comcast.net.",1353196800,,772,4.380281690140845

4541461,4,B0053O89IS,"I should preface this review by saying that I can never get enough Bones, which may make my perspective a bit skewed.  I am certainly more Booth than Brennan.  Season 7 lacks some of the heat and heart that was season 6.  Season 6 was a tough act to follow: it opened with the joyful reunion of the Jeffersonian crew, the disappointment of Booth coupling up with Hannah, the ache when Brennan realizes that she ""lost her moment"" with Booth, the horror of death of the brilliant Mr. Nigel-Murray, the delight of the birth of Micheal Staccato Vincent, and that amazing look on Booth's face in the final scene.  How could you possibly follow that up?

Well lets start with the pay off of finally seeing the best will-they-won't they couple since Ross and Rachel finally together, the so cheesy it works birth of Baby Booth, and not to mention the creepiest bad guy since Gormogon.  The individual episodes are still filled with the typical Bones recipe of intrigue, science, relationships, and humor.  Plus we still see all of the wonderfully cooky and diverse characters we have grown to love from Daisy all the way to Hodgins.  And luckily, Booth and Brennan haven't lost any of the chemistry and friction as a fully realized couple.  So, while season 7 lacked the punch of some of the other seasons, it still entertains and lays ground work for a dynamite season 8.

4541546,4,B0053O89IS,"Updated November 12, 2012:

I love the show but the price still remains too high, especially considering the 8th season has already started. The price has been fluctuating around $39.00, which still comes out to $3.00 an episode. There are some sellers in the Marketplace that have it priced  so that with shipping it will end up at around $29.00. This still leaves the per episode cost higher than individual episode purchase cost! One would think that with the disappointment over the shortened season, along with the fact that the Bones people always seem to wait to release their product until after the next season begins, that they'd price more accordingly (whoever it is that does the pricing!). I'll just keep waiting... That being said, several of the episodes in this shortened season will eventually become some of my all time favorites.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

I'll review the 7th season of Bones by stating that I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a bit different from previous seasons but, hey, it was Bones! I'll eventually purchase the DVD, but not at the $45 current price. $45 for 13 episodes? $3.50 per episode? Way too much. I waited to purchase the Season 6 DVD until around Christmas and ended up getting it for about $18 and it had about 22 episodes. I guess these DVDs are priced high to begin with because they figure people will pay what they're asking just to get them right away. I'll wait. I took away one star due to price...",1350518400,,1446,4.703557312252965

I only wish that season 7 was available for free- we have been paying to watch every episode out of our intoxicating obsession with it. There are always new serial killers to follow and of course, the love story between Bones & Booth and Angela & Hodgins and make it more exciting and romantic for me.

4541648,5,B0053O89IS,"No surprise after all. That's what happens when you get married, at times even when you don't. Temperance got pregnant and this season we are going to see her delivering a child. To bring the father back into the picture because the plot needed it the baby is a girl? SO THAT Temperance is going to relive her bad experience with her father when she was a girl and he abandoned her, and her brother. But you all know that. They decide to name the girl Christine, I guess in honor of the film and the book by John Carpenter and Stephen King respectively.

This season knits together some cases that solved in one episode and a couple of others that go beyond the episode structure. In that case even one that goes beyond the season structure. Suspense requires such tricks. TV is a Trickster. My favorite is ""The Don't In The Do"" in which there is no Indian but a hair fetishist who believe in scalping. Tie up your hair ladies, especially if you are gentlemen.

The series uses of course many interns, rotating interns, which enables us to see some faces only episodically from time to time but repetitively every two or three episodes. That concentrates our attention on the six or so regulars and at the same time that gives us some new blood that titillates our interest.

The mother Temperance is even worse than the doctor Bones. She is anxious, afraid, over protective, quasi paranoid, definitely on the verge of neurosis, which is anything but rational, and she turns every one around her completely upside down and crazy if they dare follow her along that line. You have to learn how to let the mother rant and rave about all the dangers that menace her child and hope one day she might let that child grow up, and some anxiety is needed to grow up, some challenge some would say.

The most interesting part of this series is that the crimes are always extreme cases of asocial behavior and at time sociopathic derangement. It is practically always some hidden situation unknown of everyone that produces a reaction that brings forward a dead body. But in this series they always choose the grossest way to deliver the body, to wrap it up, to make it decay and rot, etc. There is no end along that line. It is always possible to make a body look more disgusting than what you have achieved in the previous episode. The rule is that you need to see the bones and to deal with the bones. You have to feel it in your buns.

A last note will be about the follow up story that ends up unfinished this season. Temperance Bones is at stake and is menaced. She was too often over positive and over affirmative. It is her time to get challenged. First she is wrong about the age of the bones of a body by fifteen years over and then she becomes the main target. Luckily she has a daughter, a loving husband and a resourceful father. What will be left of her integrity after that? At least the child has been christened just in time.

One thing is sure: this series tried to follow the antics of Supernatural this season and they have a dead body on the set of the film that will come out next summer on Bones, ""Bone of contention"". Real crime in a virtual crime story. In fact virtual real crime in a virtual virtual crime story. What reality is left after all that virtuality?

Mostly the stories are good and I wonder sometimes if everything they do can actually be done, but that's okay. Season 7 was short and I became frustrated by how it was on then it wasn't on. I had to be so vigilant watching for it. I have liked everything except Finn. If I wanted something like him, I'd watch Swamp People on the ""History Channel"". I don't appreciate bad grammar. I'm assuming this person went to school, didn't they teach him how to speak properly? Now for my question. Since Pelant has been on the scene, it's been tough going for Bones and Booth, but I wondered if anyone else, including Booth, noticed that the colonel that talked him to going back into service in season five, had the same last name, Pelant.

I hoped these episodes were an aberration but they just got worse as the season went on, making the characters act in ways inconsistent with the personalities that had been developed so thoughtfully over the past six years.  Some cringe-worthy moments:  Angela so desperate to see her baby during the work day she hides him in a file cabinet, despite having on-site child care that she can visit at will?  Jack AND ANGELA so fearful of her father that they won't allow him to babysit their wakeful child -- who, SO predictably, drops off to sleep to his grandfather's electric guitar lullaby?  Jack turning into a machine junkie who has to be restrained by Cam's threats so he doesn't bankrupt the lab?  Brennan insisting on plunging alone into a prison riot while on the verge of giving birth?  Please.
It's obvious that Hart Hanson, bored with Bones, took the good writers with him to ""The Finder"" leaving Bones with a bunch of also-rans who can't restrain their impulses toward schlock, pratfalls, and predictability.  I couldn't finish watching the ""birth in a manger"" episode, and after that stopped recording altogether.

4541855,4,B0053O89IS,"Season 7 of this popular drama about the relationship between a genius anthropologist (Emily Deschanel) and a cocky FBI agent (David Boreanaz) kicks off with the duo adjusting to their unplanned pregnancy and their new shared life. Although Brennan and Booth have long spent much of their waking hours together, both in and out of work, things are vastly different when they're also living under the same roof.

Much of the previous seasons' conflicts stem from, and center upon, the two's clashing personalities and approaches toward life, so naturally, that also comes into play when faced with decisions on how to raise their baby daughter.

Although the season is only thirteen episodes - shortened because of Deschanel's real-life pregnancy and maternity leave - a number of key episodes and plots are featured. These include ""The Hot Dog in the Competition,"" where a new intern, Finn Abernathy (Luke Kleintank) joins the Jeffersonian squints. A genius who completed years of schooling in record time, Finn would be a welcome addition to the lab - if he didn't also have a questionable past that causes some of the others to worry.

In ""The Male in the Mail"" Ralph Waite returns as Booth's grandfather Pops. This time, he brings disturbing news of Booth's long-estranged father, which of course evokes Booth's memories of his troubled childhood and in turn his feelings toward being a father himself.

Booth's son Parker (Ty Panitz) makes only one appearance this season, in episode 10 (""The Warrior in the Wuss"") when he returns from England and meets his baby sister. Booth and Brennan worry about how the 11-year-old, who's been an only child up to this point, will adjust to a new sibling and to the new family situation overall.

Ryan O'Neal makes two guest appearances as Brennan's father Max, first in ""The Family in the Feud,"" where he offers to babysit little Christine, causing his daughter to revisit her mistrust of Max over his abandonment of Brennan as a teen. Then, in the season finale - ""The Past in the Present"" - Max again appears, this time to help his daughter and granddaughter when their lives are threatened by computer genius serial killer Christopher Pelant.

As always, Tamara Taylor as Dr. Cam Saroyan, TJ Thyne as Dr. Jack Hodgins, Michaela Conlin as Angela Montenegro and John Francis Daly as Dr. Lance Sweets do an incredible job as supporting cast!

4541955,5,B0053O89IS,"Season seven: Aired November 3, 2011 - May 14, 2012.
This season it was only 13 episodes due to Emily Deschanel pregnancy. Fox has ordered an additional four episodes that will either be included with this season, or be a mini-summer season. Guess we have to wait and see.

Let me start by saying I have watched every season of ""Bones"", and have been an avid fan since episode one, so when I heard there would only be 13 episodes this season I was a little bit skeptical. After watching this season I can honestly say even with -basically half a season I was not disappointed. During season seven we have a lot happening in such a short period of time. We have a new arrival to the team, a new serial killer...more drama, comedy, and of course more murder mysteries. This season was one of the best; the last couple of episodes were so hard to watch.

Any more details will spoil the season, so if you are a fan of the previous seasons, then invest in season seven. ""Bones"" continues to be one of the best Drama/crime shows on television today.",1337385600,20,1044,4.404145077720207

4542026,5,B0053O89IS,"The episode has all the earmarks of a classic Bones case. A high tech bad guy uses electronic data to take control of almost every aspect of Brennan's life, including fabricating evidence to frame her for murder. Special FBI agent Booth along with every member of the team chase every clue to exonerate Bones before she is to surrender to the authorities to answer the charges. Suspense, drama, action, it's all her and of course, it's also the first of a two or three (or more) part story. Like I said, classic Bones.",1337126400,,518,4.580645161290323
4542027,5,B0053O89IS,"The arch enemy returns and for once he is more than a match for Bones & Booth.  This was set up when Palant, the new Brainy Extreme Intellect villian out did the Jeffersonian Team back in episode 6, (the one where they made us watch the pilot for, 'The Finder'), before Brennan gave birth.  I can see real potential in this going any number of ways, and we already learn that Brennan's Father (played by Ryan O'Neal) comes to the rescue and wisely makes Brennan escape arrest by being on the lamm.  How a famous author who has been on TV and acts so unnatural most of the time can become inconspicuous enough to escape the FBI and arrest should make for a really good thriller. The threat from Palant is so extreme and far out beyond the Jeffersonian forensics teams standard fare he adds a sense of panic to the episode not seen before.  One could see Booth getting his old sniper nemesis Jake Brodsky out of jail to take down the villian the way he did 'The Gravedigger', rather than risk Brennan and the child with this new threat. Personally I'd like to see them seek out the smartest person they have and use this as the vehicle to bring back Dr. Zack Addey from his rubber room gig at the mental hospital. Zack could out reason the Palant Character and build a trap for him. We find that Angela plays a more involved role than before, and contributes a lot more, as does even Jack Hodgins the 'Bug & Slime' guy she married.  The interplay of these characters has been altered by this unique episode, and it raises the bar quite a bit from the usual ""Body in the ___"" episodes we have grown accustomed to watching.

I have made the Sherlock Holmes comparison with Bones before, and this fellow has more of that 'Professor Moriarty' feel than any of the previous arch-enemies.  If they add a few more episodes to this and continue the character development and tension this could be the equal of Hound of The Baskervilles, or The Sign of Four tales from Conan Doyle. It is unusual to see a TV series devop this well, and this radically after so long a run.  If they keep it going the Bones series could set records for longevity like MASH did.  I personally hope they do that, it is one of the most entertaining series I have enjoyed in a very long time.  The producers, actors, and writers all deserve great accolades for a job very well done.",1337040000,9,2348,4.401847575057737
4542028,4,B0053O89IS,"You get season 7 of ""Bones"".

While the season was only 13 episodes long, because of Emily Deschanel's pregnancy and Fox's desire to test ""The Finder"", it managed to cram in some huge changes - and big plotlines - into that short season.

With the start of the season, we saw Brennan and Booth both adjusting to their new life together, awaiting the birth of their child. We also saw them let go of the last vestiges of their single lives and find a ramshackle home (which, with Wendall's FAST off screen help!) to move into. With the birth of their daughter, Christine, came a new sense of family.

For many episodes, the family angle was played up. Some might even say it was played up *too much*, but with tonight's finale, I think there was a point to it, so I can understand the reasoning, even if I felt the season was drama light. Starting with ""The Crack in the Code"", we meet the likely reason for the emphasis on family. His name is Christopher Pelant, a hacker who had messed with the government and ended up with an ankle monitor for his trouble. But the viewers see that is not the end of his ""fun"", by any means. He is, very much so, an equal to the folks at the Jeffersonian in terms of brilliance. In the first episode we meet him, he manages to murder a reporter and have the remains cremated before they can be examined by altering government red tape. He also manages to fry Angela's expensive equipment when she tries to scan the bones of another erstwhile victim of his by putting malware inside said bones.

An average criminal, he clearly is not.

In between the Pelant arc, the audience gets a shout-out episode - using Easter eggs and hybrid staff names - as a wink and thank you to the fans, as one of Brennan's novels gets filmed into a movie. We also see how Angela and Hodgins are, themselves, adjusting to parenthood, often with Angela using her experiences to help Brennan deal with her own worries.

Maybe TPTB knew there was limited time in which to really dig deep into the drama, so the fluff was used much more prevalently, in my opinion, than in past seasons, hence four stars instead of five. I like fluff, but the show is ostensibly a dramedy and there was a bit too little ""dram"" versus ""edy"". Still, I think that was to make things easier on Ms. Deschanel, and to give the viewers a quiet reprieve from the drama of the prior season.

And, naturally, to really build up the happiness before Pelant made his creepy presence felt once again - in a *big way* - for the finale. In which a parallel between Booth/Brennan and Brennan's own past is made. I will not spoil what happens but, needless to say, echoes of Brennan's past make its way into the present with some heart-wrenching choices when it seems circumstances play against her. Which puts the future of Booth, Brennan, and their baby as a family in jeopardy.

And with those unanswered questions, I look forward to seeing how things resolve in Season 8, which, on the bright side, looks to be a full, regular season come fall, including four ""bonus"" episodes that were ordered for either the summer or for the new season; recently, it was announced these four episodes would be included in Season 8 as stand-alone episodes (versus the usual episodes that seem to have a continuing arc).

So, the moral is, enjoy the fluff while it is around - even if a bit too much - because the drama will always kick back in. Hart Hanson and Company have proven it once again.

ETA: 06/20/2012: Oddly, while no release date for this set is still posted here, Amazon's Canadian site, Amazon.ca, is also taking orders and has a release date now for October 9th. This should apply as Canada and the US both have Region 1 DVDs and use Region A for Blu-Ray. Also, October 9th is a Tuesday, which is typically when new releases come out in the US. So just a possible update in terms of just when this set may be released!

ETA, Part 2 - 07/19/2012: As you see, the key art for the DVD/BluRay set has been released. TV Shows On DVD has the release date as October 9th, though Amazon does not have that listed yet.",1336953600,46,4090,4.44
4542029,5,B0053O89IS,"Obviously, this episode was polarizing, but I loved it. I thought it was *meant* to be fun and tongue-in-cheek. A nice fluffy episode before all hell breaks loose in next week's finale.

From the name of the victim - Hanson Stevens - a mixture of the names of EPs Hart Hanson and Stephen Nathan, with Angela's sketch a combo of both - to movie replicas of the team to inside facts and jokes known to Bones fans...4:47, Huckleberry's donuts, it was a treat. Not just for spoofing the show and their jobs and the characters, but also a treat to get a glimpse of the very real Fox lot where ""Bones"" tapes. Including making fun of themselves and likely fan criticisms by stating ""everybody hates Hanson"", ""Canadians don't gloat"", and my personal favorite wink: ""Hanson writes nothing but crap"". I think Hart Hanson's voice may have had a cameo last night, too.

Oh, another nice few touches were Fake Booth wearing a ""Cooky"" (versus ""Cocky"") belt buckle...and Real Hodgins warming to Fake Hodgins, especially once Fake Hodgins spilled Cam's secret (hysterical!) past. A nod to DB's ""Angel"", too, maybe? Hmmm! The end scene with the gang watching that movie was terrific. I almost wonder if that was their first time seeing it as the reactions seemed suspiciously genuine with the laughter! Nice close ""family vibe"" with them all there. Complete with donuts.

Mr. Hanson even said this episode was a shout out to the devoted fans of the show, and with all of the in-jokes and winks, I think it did more than deliver the goods.

Kudos for a fun episode. Bring on the finale!",1336435200,8,1568,4.6909090909090905

4542033,5,B0053O89IS,"The seventh season of ""Bones"" finds forensic anthropologist Dr. Temperance ""Bones"" Brennan and her FBI partner Seeley Booth adjusting to a significant change in their relationship: the pending birth of a child, conceived late last season in a moment of shared grief over the death of a colleague.  Bones remains stoically on the job at the Jeffersonian Institute and in the field despite her advancing pregnancy, while Booth will become increasingly frantic in his often misguided efforts to protect her.  Series fans will be treated to the full humor of a lively debate over where to live and how to raise their child.  The blessed event itself will have all the suspense that awkward timing in the middle of a tense case can give it.

The changes will ripple through the Jeffersonian forensic lab.  Dr. Sweets gets increased field duty as a substitute partner for Booth, and cannot help psychoanalyzing everything.  Bones' best friend Angela will attempt to prepare her for working motherhood, while Dr. Saroyan will try to keep the lab functioning while minding an unending parade of interns.  The entire Jeffersonian team will be involved in a chilling season-ending cliff-hanger episode.

""Bones"" contines to feature a crime of the week, to be solved through a combination of exotic forensics work by the lab rats and Booth's old-fashioned police work.  However, the best part of the series is the fun interaction of the Jeffersonian staff and the ""opposites attract"" relationship of Bones and Booth.

Congratulations over all for continuing to give us a show we can actually feel smarter after watching, a rarity in today's reality show fueled media.

As to the series premeire of Finder, it's not a bad spin off. Those who remember this character will recall he isn't ""superhero"" by any means, but instead suffered a brain injury in combat which causes him both to compulsively find things, and also to see connections where most would see chaos. As to the question of support.... was it missed that people generally pay quite handsomely for objects to be found? He made more finding one guitar than most Americans do in 6 months; I'd call that ample support.
