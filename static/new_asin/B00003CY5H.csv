1306499,5,B00003CY5H,The score is a fast paced thriller that will keep  you guessing from start to finish.  Robert De Nero is the consummate heist man ready for the 'last job.' Marlon Brando does what only Brando can do.  He is  brilliant on the weakling colleague who needs a big score or lose his life because of an extravagant life style.  Ed Norton is the brash young turk who thinks he can out smart anybody.  Well think again Ed.  The movie has as many twitches and turn has you can handle and then adds one more for the kicker.  Outstanding movie.,995068800,,533,4.313131313131313
1306500,4,B00003CY5H,"This movie was too short!  That's my only complaint.  I wish that ""The Score"" had allotted more time to the development of the main characters and their relationships/histories with each other. For example, I would have enjoyed seeing what other heists Nick had pulled off in the past, knowing what his background was and what made him tick.  All that aside, this was one of the most suspenseful movies that I have ever seen.  I was left chewing my fingertips and wondering how much more edge-of-my-seat anxiety I could take right up until the end of the movie. De Niro as Nick was wonderful in an understated way. Angela Bassett has a small part but you do get to see glimpses of her throughout the film as De Niro's lovely fianc.  Don't want to say more and risk giving anything away, so go see this movie and enjoy!",995068800,2,818,4.5
1306501,5,B00003CY5H,"I'm not going to tire you with a summary of what this movie is about. I will say this though... SEE THIS MOVIE VERY SOON. Well worth my [price], ""The Score"" had me chewing my nails like a maniac. Robert DeNiro was, as always, magnificient. And I just can't say enough good things about Edward Norton. Norton is definitely one of the GREATEST YOUNG ACTORS OF OUR TIME. Great screenplay and incredible direction from Frank Oz. ....",994982400,,429,4.584415584415584
1306502,3,B00003CY5H,"Well well. I'm finally writing a review Rino. I think it's a good idea, and what better movie to do than one I know you're going to be writing as well.
First of all, I very impulsively saw this movie. I had no real plans to see it. It was not something I avidly waited to be released. In fact I made fun of it numerous times. It was either ""Made"", basically the sequal to Swingers, or this. I picked ""The Score.""  And it was pretty much just what I expected. Some good parts. Some bad parts.
Norton was the best part of the movie to me. But first the bad. Brando I thought was mediocre and just pathetic looking. I wish they'd gotten another actor. He was more distracting than anything. Sad, really to see so great a man reduced to what I saw on screen. Deniro was, well Deniro. Ostensibly good as always, but nothing to rave about. I wonder how many moives he does a year? I bet it rivals Samuel L. Jackson. And the best part? Norton. He was a joy to watch for me. His acting is so effortless and reeks of realism. I also found the ""retard schtick"" very amusing. He has a real prescence for such an unassuming looking fellow.
The movie was shot well enough, aptly done. Good cinematography. There were some good scenes. The opening scene with Deniro and the pot head chick was nice (a good intro that the rest of the movie didn't really live up to), the scene where Norton does a voice over explaining the layout of the place they're about to rob while he plays the retard was good, and the drop off scene in the park with the security company dork was nicely done. Funny and good tension. Simple. The end though, the end wasn't terrible, just sort of...standard. But then I guess it's hard to come up with a really inventive take on a robbery. Again not terrible, but not really engaging either. The twist at the end was not very surprising, but nice nonetheless.
And I don't know why Angela Basset was in this movie, other than the fact that Deniro only ... Black chicks and wanted to express this for once in one of his movies.
All in all, when all is said and done, when all the ten year old boys are purchased and raped, I give it a B-.",994982400,2,2143,4.23960880195599
1306503,4,B00003CY5H,"Robert De Niro, Edward Norton, and Marlon Brando.  Without saying another word about this film it is worth seeing just because these three actors share screen time.  Having said that, this movie is also worth seeing because it is a really good picture.
De Niro plays Nick, a smart, by the books safe cracker, who never takes risks, and always delivers the goods.  However, Nick has decided that he wants to get out and retire to run his night club and settle down with his girlfriend.  Which would be fine except his long time partner, Max, played by Brando, has come across one last job that is too good to pass on.  The catch is he must work with a partner, Jack(Norton), and he must do it in his home city of Montreal. These are two things he never does. The situation does not improve when his accomplice approaches him on the street, which Nick finds unprofessional.
What makes this movie so entertaining is the way in which it is presented.  Everything in the movie is about designing the score, building the suspence to when they make their move.  The attention to detail, rather than having silly subplots, is a credit to the script and to director Frank Oz.  And the cast is perfect.  The great thing about having great actors in a film like this is that they did not try to do too much.  De Niro, was cool and calculating.  His portayal of the aging theif was just what it needed to be.  It really seemed like he was just ready to quit, but then not quite.  Norton contrasted De Niro's old pro with the energy of a young man eagar to make a name for himself and prove his worth.  He was cocky and arrogant but also intellegent.
The real scene stealer was Brando though.  His role is not very large, but it is essential to the story.  His character is another contrast to De Niro's Nick and Norton's Jack.  He is the man who sells the goods and it is hard to imagine that in the real world these types of people would be much different than Brando's lively, eccentric Max.  The performance is another reminder that Brando, even at 76, can hold an audiences' attention like no other actor.
This movie is a throw back to the old heist pictures and a good one at that.  It features three of the best actors there are in an intralling, suspenceful story.  What more could we ask for?This is definately a score.",994982400,4,2315,4.402352941176471

1306831,5,B00003CY5H,"smart,  uses Montreal as the backdrop to a neferious club owner whose lover is tempting him to quit burglary.  The city is clearly important to the producers,  they emphasize location and local dialect often, and really it has no bearing on the script. I like the jazz club,  seeing Cassandra Wilson and the late Mose Allison sing a tune is a real treat.  I wish i was in that club!  the story is of a successful burglar who is about to make the leap for love when a young whipper snapper upsets the apple cart.
This is younger Edward Norton,  he has a nice edge here,  and a younger Robert DeNiro playing ..a club owner guy .. just a guy.. This character seems closer to the real DeNIro somehow.  The third heavy hitter here is the lovely Marlon Brando trying to shine his light dimly enough so to not overtake all the other great actors in the film. his ..  cracks show alittle.  he has a very small role,  his thinning blonde hair and weight,  and charming in an obvious way, a boy hiding in a man suit.  hiding in the empty bath tub. small roles are unsettling,  I always want to see more of Brando.  He can do no wrong as far as I am concerned.
  so the A list actors and the good script,  a unique french anglo Canadia setting,  with a first-peoples part thrown in and it's still not a Great film.  but its Good,  Very good,  recommend it.
its a very physical role.  a fun script and extras like musical guests.",1486166400,,1417,4.260377358490566

When De Niro was ******** I could feel the sweat running down his face. I just KNEW Norton was ********, and I was right. During shooting Marlon was at odds with the director. De Niro directed many of the scenes. well done. Brando lends a whiny, almost reclusive character manipulating the ******. Norton is cunning and almost whiny, but isn't he always. De Niro was straight faced, serious. Blended together you have a really strange and interesting mixture of characters. The drama is different enough from other like minded dramas to capture and keep your attention.

1307661,3,B00003CY5H,"In what was widely considered to be a passing of the torch, three generations of Hollywood superstars, joined forces for a thriller known as The Score. I found this to be a very strange film, as it features both moments of high intensity and moments that are painfully slow. Robert De Niro stars as Nick Wells, the best safe cracker you could find, but as he's getting older and seeking more stability in his life. Considering retirement, Wells is asked to be part of one last big score, that will have him, and his fence, set for life. Wells reluctantly agrees, before finding out there is a catch, he'll be working with his possible replacement, an arrogant and cocky young man, who could wind up getting them all caught. As far as acting goes, you may never see a better trio of leading men, De Niro, Marlon Brando, and especially Edward Norton were absolutely terrific in their roles. The film however doesn't really take off until the crime actually begins. For over an hour they are in the planning stage, painstakingly going over every detail, and it really is as bad as it sounds, in fact, I almost turned it off, until the wheels were set in motion. From that point, the film really is terrific, with an ending that will leave your jaw on the floor! I was very happy with the last forty minutes of the film, and all three actors were fantastic, but so much of this film moves at a snails pact that I really couldn't give it a higher rating. This is a two hour film, that could have easily been shortened to an hour and a half, without losing any of it's integrity. All the detailed plans and unnecessary back and fourth make the first hour of this film painful, but if you can stick with it, the second hour is certainly worth it.",1438992000,,1739,4.4375

1307814,4,B00003CY5H,"Make a movie I will! If you told me that the man behind Bert, Fozzie Bear, Grover and Yoda could stop throating and direct a heist movie involving three of the best actors in the business, two of whom are practically legends, I would have been sure you were running a Ponzi Scheme. But Frank Oz went behind the camera to manage the team of a very taut and compelling suspense movie with three actors that could all bat clean-up by themselves--each representing a different generation: Marlon Brando who began his career in the 1950's playing lower middle class urbanites, Robert DeNiro, who began playing tough-talking New York Italians on the rough end of New York and Brooklyn in the 1970's, and Edward Norton, the new kid on the block, whose similar resum&eacute; includes amoral characters with a nervous-angst that comes off like Anthony Perkins on speed; he began his acting career in the mid-1990's in films also in urban settings. And of the three performances, the most compelling may surprise you.

Brando, the grand titan of the three, probably has the least interesting and weakest performance of the three, although it's still decent but maybe not quite up to the usual Brando standard. He plays Max, the man setting up and funding the heist. Next in line is Robert DeNiro who could act his way out of a paper-bag, although the character he plays in ""The Score"", Nick, is not unlike many other roles he has played in recent years, somewhat akin to his leads in ""Casino"" and ""Heat"". Here he plays a genius safe-cracker. Certainly, his acting is right on the money, but nothing that he hasn't done before. Believe it or not, the standout performance of this film is Edward Norton, playing a character who acts like another character. Norton plays a rookie thief, Jack, who has landed a job at the Customs Office in Montreal, Canada, by pretending he is ""Brian"", a retarded graveyard shift worker who manages to fool the other employees and security guards that his brain is a few flakes short of a complete bowl of sugar cereal. It's Norton that really makes this film work as well as it does.

The film opens with DeNiro on one of his heists lifting a prized diamond-studded necklace. And it almost backfires. Later, Brando approaches DeNiro with a new proposition: to heist a piece of priceless antiquity, a late renaissance golden scepter made in the 1660's. ""Brian"", the retard who is really Jack (Norton), had known about the scepter and its new home in the Customs Office. Somehow he gets himself hired by the bureaucratic office by playing a seemingly harmless mentally-handicapped who brings a lunch and a little used tape player to work every midnight. He listens to recordings of Mozart in mono while he mops the floors. But when his associates aren't looking, he's scouting out the premises and stealing documents. Max then has to convince Nick to work with Jack on the heist. The three become sort of reluctant bedfellows. But once the commitment has been made and the plans start being executed, the movie really takes off.

This is a highly entertaining heist movie, with a bit of a twist at the end. The standout talents have to be Edward Norton as Jack/Brian and the director Frank Oz. Oz' compelling direction is as good as anything Brian DePalma or Martin Scorsese could have dreamed up. DeNiro is right up there too, and Brando has to keep up. Sometimes things are not always as they should be.",1432944000,,3424,4.751260504201681

Don't get me wrong, this really isn't a bad movie, it is just that with all of the star power in it, one would assume that it would be better than what it is. Perhaps it was another victim of too much talent not adding up to the sum of thier parts. When watching this you will get a sense of something is missing, perhaps the pacing since it builds slowly, but definatly when it gets to the meat of things it picks up and gets going. Not too sure that is what it is either. Perhaps it was that the style that it was reaching for, it never fully realizes it. Or perhaps a combo of some of these things. Can't put my finger on it.

1310158,5,B00003CY5H,"The Score is a crime thriller that stars former Academy Award winners and nominees: Robert De Niro, Edward Norton, Angela Bassett and Marlon Brando,who appeared in his last film feature. This is the first feature wherein the two former Vito Corleones - Brando and De Niro - appeared together in a movie.

Despite the fact that the story has been familiar plot elements to avid crime thriller genres such as one last heist;ala father-and-son relationship between master and criminal;an unlikely first-time partnership between an experienced criminal and an aspiring protege,the target scepter heavily guarded; and many others,the talented cast made it somewhat refreshing and interesting. Setting up the film in the classic city of Montreal in Canada added beauty to the film. It is also worthy of mention how Oz directed the film as he employed patience in story telling and capitalized on the talents on De Niro and especially Norton,who is in a familiar two-character role as a mentally handicapped janitor and an aspiring thief that he once did in his film debut,Primal Fear.

It may not be a great one like The Godfather it will surely delight people who love are fans of the cast and love these types of features.",1407542400,,1218,4.995073891625616

He comes across as a nice guy and you can't help but like him.  Marlon Brando is his fence who also sets up his jobs.  And Edward Norton -- no one can make a intelligent smart-ass that you love to hate like he does.(The Italian Job).

This is a fast-paced heist crime movie with twists and turns, starring Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando, and a sensational performance by Edward Norton who could have been nominated for an Oscar that year. This is the only time all three appear in the same movie, although De Niro and Brando play the same character in different Godfather movies and decades apart in the script. In ""The Score"", Robert De Niro plays an expert burglar with expensive tastes and a unique setup. He pulls his last job and is about to go into retirement, when....  This movie is well worth the watch. Bring lots of popcorn for this one, because some masterful acting is going on here in a quick hour and a half. Also costarring Angela Bassett and Gary Farmer, with musical cameos by jazz greats Mose Allison and Cassandra Wilson. The highly-effective music score is by Howard Shore with an addictive theme.

1311122,3,B00003CY5H,"The Score (Frank Oz, 2001)
[originally posted on 3Aug2001]

The good points:
1. Edward Norton proves once again that he can do no wrong.
2. The club that Robert DeNiro's character owns filled me with unbridled lust. It's absolutely phenomenal.
3. Gary Farmer is also phenomenal. (You remember Gary Farmer from his immortal one-liner in Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai.) The chemistry between Farmer and Norton almost makes this film work.

The bad points:
1. DeNiro and Brando add another mediocre film to the relative crap both have been appearing in for the last few years.
2. Hollywood once again refuses to cast an all-male film, adding Angela Bassett (with second billing, no less, despite having far less screen time than either Brando or Norton) as a seeming afterthought. Bassett's character gives us more lapses in logic and loose ends than the rest of the film put together.
3. Frank Oz is not a thriller director. This is obvious throughout.
4. The ending is a rather large letdown. The film just... ends.
5. The marketing campaign was godawful. If an ad promises an ending you'll never guess, nine times out of ten you'll guess it without seeing the film. This is not time number ten.
6. Marlon Brando has been hovering on the verge of death for at least a decade. I think he may have died without realizing it. He certainly looks as if he's starting to decompose.

Wastes two hours without too much pain, and Edward Norton continues to bat a thousand with regards to being a pleasure to watch onscreen. In fact, ""Brian"" may be the most entertaining character Norton has yet portrayed in a film. But Norton, Farmer, and the NYC club aren't enough when stacked against the film's shortcomings. ** ",1394409600,,1710,4.747474747474747

1311343,4,B00003CY5H,"Nice caper flick with DeNiro and Norton sharing the camera well together. Interesting story that has a few unexpected twists and turns--especially at the peak of the plot towards the end of the movie. Norton successfully pulls off a guy who is smart as a tack yet can mimic the acts and personality of a mentally challenged man all to convince DeNiro to help him pull off the ultimate heist. DeNiro, on the other hand, plays a guy who's lived a long and successful life of pulling off major thefts, managing to set himself up with a great life and a beautiful woman, played by Angela Bassett. DeNiro really wants out of the game but Norton's persistence and the thrill of one last major heist is too much to pass up as DeNiro agrees to try and pull off the caper. Exciting story, not too long, good chemistry between the actors, no moments where the audience feels the story or action is too ""unbelievable,"" and few lessons about loyalty and deceipt learned at the end.",1390867200,,969,4.542857142857143

It does provide increased detail over the DVD and little film grain.  But the color is a bit washed out--it would have benefitted from more saturation.  I adjusted the settings on my television, and that helped.  It does not matter all that much, however, because the visual elements of this movie are not the prime draw, but rather the plot.

1312206,4,B00003CY5H,"The heist movie formula: take an aging, down-on-his-luck thief and pair him with a hotshot new partner.  Ask him to steal something worth millions of dollars from the most secure safe in the known universe.  Add a love interest, a couple of double-crosses, and stir.  So much the better if the actors are top-notch, the location's scenic, and the music's good.  There you go!  Nothin' to it, right?

I grew up a generation too late to really get to see Marlon Brando in the theatres.  Even in the Godfather, he's getting up there, but in the fifties, Brando was a god.  Likewise, I was too young to see De Niro's best work in the theatres.  No Goodfellas, Raging Bull, or Chinatown for me.  Thankfully, I've gotten to see Ed Norton on the big screen.  Here, I get a treat--all three at once.  Even though Brando's a balding, obese old man, the way he delivers his lines is something special.  He doesn't space his words as most people would speak, and as a result, he leaves you hanging on each word.

Norton, however, steals the show.  He switches between a cocky, up-and-coming thief, and a mentally disabled assistant janitor.  He has to pull the switch mid-scene several times and nails it.  Perhaps he's not the most convincing Special Olympian--he simply doesn't have the facial features of most of the Down's Syndrome folks I've met--but he'd fool me for five or ten minutes.  I'd like to meet him in person sometime; I'm curious if the brash young baddie he plays in many of his roles (The Score, The 25th Hour, Fight Club, Rounders) is just an extension of who he is naturally, or if he's typecast somewhat.

As a jazz fan, I heartily approve of the movie's soundtrack, which mixes live cuts of Cassandra Wilson and Mose Allison (at least I assume they're live) with old recordings from Clifford Brown and Cannonball Adderley, and a score from an underrated bass player, Charnett Moffett.  I first heard Moffett on Mulgrew Miller's amazing album, Wingspan--been a fan since.

Last, and mostly least, I liked Nick's hacker partner: ""I'm on the phone, bitch!""

His acting range is uncovered from the first scene he appears to the very last.  I was greatly impressed.  DeNiro is remarkably sexy int his movie.  He exudes a grounded, secure gentleman who inevitably leades a double life.  (that of an art thief).  Whomever designed the sets in this film, did so around the characters lives and the dramatic deferance that they wanted you to believe.  Marlon Brando surprisingly stays sober long enough during the filming to give a pretty good performance.  Bravo Marlon!  The Director took a huge risk with that choice.

It has great actors in the lead roles and a solid cast in the secondary roles; the characters are interesting and relatively well-developed for the genre; it is set in one of my favorite cities (Montreal); and violence is kept to a minimum.  Generally speaking, this is not an ""action"" movie -- there are a few action sequences to be sure, especially at the end; but, overall this is an intelligent movie that focuses as much on the characters and their relationships as it does on the mechanics and planning involved in the heist itself.  That said, it is also relatively fast paced, and there are no boring scenes.  The film even has some romance and a happy ending.  The musical score is solid with a few memorable jazz pieces to boot.  Every time you watch it, you will notice something new; and there is plenty to talk about with friends and family.",1358640000,,888,4.553459119496855
1312290,4,B00003CY5H,"Perhaps it should be The Heist. It's a score, yes, but only for the men involved. It's a big one too, worth 30 million dollars. All lead thief Nick Wells has to do is make it to the basement of the Montral Customs House, break into the safe and get away with a valuable French scepter while partner and House janitor Jack Teller manipulates surveillance cameras from the inside.

Of course, it's not quite as easy as it seems. It never really is. That's where layers of criminal-siding tension begin to build. Some of the characterization is overplayed; a computer hacker named Steven is particularly silly; and the romantic side story is unnecessary. But the plot, which mostly consists of compelling planning until the final third, provides a nice pay-off at the end.

They (the people who reproduce movies to DVD) can call any thing that is not 1.33:1 aspect ratio (fullscreen)-'Widescreen'. This was one of those DVDs I had to just gamble it would be 2.40:1 or the like and not that 16X9 (1.78:1) which has become a bad habbit of DVD producers more and more to edit the movie to fit onto modern TVs - 16X9 - to keep the black top and bottom bars from being there. I think most people do not realize that doing that, their widescreen movies are NOT really widescreen or at least they are not reproduced in their OAR (original aspect ratio) and are missing the far left and right parts of the movie just so the black bars are not present. Actually until TVs are made in 2.40:1 (for every heigth measurement there will be 2.40 widths to the screen.) That would be like 32""X10"" or some thing (sorry, not a math person), that's not likely to ever become a reality. I just don't see the black bars when I watch the movie and am satisfied I am getting what the original producers and artists intended me to see when they made it. Any way, lol, this DVD shows on the back of the box ""Widescreen Version Enhanced for 16:9 TVs"". Shrug??? it is actually 2.35:1 or 2.40:1. This is the actual aspect ratio and stating the ""Widescreen Version Enhanced for 16:9 TVs"" is just misleading and isn't even acurate as 16:9 = 1.78:1 not what it actually 2.40:1.

1312419,5,B00003CY5H,"This movie has everything a good heist movie should have. It gives you enough of a glimpse of the workings of a safe to make you feel you've garnered some inside information. Locksmiths who specialize in opening safes often run this film as the entertainment portion of their ""penetration parties"" where they challenge each other to see who can open sample safes the fastest. While these locksmiths occasionally have a few reservations about the practicality of how the safe in this film was opened, they applaud the inventive, unexpected approach. This is not your usual blowtorch or stethoscope-to-the-dial method. You're guaranteed to be surprised at the kind of assault Robert DeNiro's character devises.

Then there's a great cast with a genuine collaborative chemistry. ""The Score"" features three generations of Hollywood's leading leading men - Marlon Brando, Robert DeNiro, and Edward Norton. Just amassing star power often doesn't work. But here the three play off each other and support each other with both the neatness and the edgy precariousness of one of the isosceles triangles in a house of cards. Edward Norton turns in the sort of dual persona performance that has become his trademark and that he has been called on several more times to deliver as only he can.

There's a smooth-as-bourbon romance that gives an emotional heart to the story. There are some imaginative twists and turns along the way. Then the movie supplies the bonus of striking shots of Montreal, a city whose streets haven't been seen a lot in the movies.

Frank Oz supplies a worthwhile Director's Commentary. I found myself actually looking forward to listening to this disc commentary, rather than facing it as the usual chore I feel obligated to complete. The commentary gave me a chance to watch the movie again.

Oz gives some insights into the techniques he used to achieve the desired impact here. For example, he calls the viewer's attention to the fact that many scenes are played without background music. Yes, that silence does add realism and tension to the crew's treacherous maneuverings.

This is a thoughtful, engrossing film that you lean into with fascination - unlike some of the more recent bank-job and heist films in which the perpetrators go in brutal with guns blazing amid a storm of special effects. By contrast, this is a precise, well-planned job, as satisfying as that subtle click you hear when you finally dial the right combination, and the door to the vault pops open.",1310688000,,2492,5.009661835748792

1312537,4,B00003CY5H,"In The Score, Robert DeNiro plays a jazz club owner, Nick, who sides as a safe cracker in Montrial. He is cautious, non-violent, subtle and smart. He wants  to retire, and is set up by his fence, Marlon Brando, on one last job. But the job is close to home, something Nick has vowed never to do.

Ed Norton plays the guy who Brando wants Nick to partner with. Young and cocky, he poses as  a handicaped, mentally-slow janitor at the customs house the three bandits are trying to rob. There is the expected antaginism between the young buck and the old master, and the job gets more complicated. Eventually, through twists and turns, one outsmarts the other.

This is a great thriller: tight and compact and dead on point. Norton is great as usual, and DeNiro makes a great choice by downplaying the criminal cleches of his character. Nick is sophisticated and complex and not nessasarly motivated by the thrill of the chase that most robbers are.
He runs a successful bussiness and, aside from being a robber, seems like a down to earth guy--not the type that would steel for the rush. It is great to wonder what is actually driving him to take such risks.

The film also gets into some of the technical aspects of safe cracking, and shows how hard it is to be a theif. This adds a lot of texture to The Score.

I do have one gripe with this film: I have Cerebal Palsy, and object to the way Norton portays his disabled alter-ego as the cute, dull muppet that everyone loves and babys. Even in our day and age, the public is still woefully ignorant about physical disabilites; think about racial stereotypes around 1955, and it is comperible. People still equate physical limits  with intellectual ones. I am not politcally correct and I don't mind good satire, or even a negative portrayal of a disabled person. But socially, we have not evolved to the point where people have shed their stereotypes of people with disabilities. We can't, yet, afford to have this kind of cleche out there without counterpoint. Plus, it would have been more interesting to have Norton make his disguise persona disabled but smart, and then have him turn the tables at the end.

That said, this is a great film: I own it and am not about to throw it away, and I'd reccomended it on a asthetic basis if not a social one.",1244937600,,2302,4.516826923076923

The two main characters were De Niro and Norton.  These two played very well off each other and elevated the movie (along with a great plot and script).  There were ample twists and turns that drew me more and more into ""The Score"".  The ending was excellent and my time was well spent.  However, the movie had a fault or two.  The main one was the romantic aspect.  It really didn't fit the film.  This is a cerebral action movie with no time for examining a tenuous relationship.  Yes, we needed to understand De Niro as a man who was after one last score and with a vision of his future and the partner to share it with.  But why give us a partner who seemed so unworthy of that supporting role?  Oh well, to each his own.

1312541,4,B00003CY5H,"The Score is a good film with great performances.
Overall, I enjoyed the film. The caper to steal the sceptre was complex because of the high tech security, yet it was met with an ingenious theif that used low-tech equipment to combat their systems.
The jazz theme of NYC's represented improvisational way that many thieves worked in this film.  DeNiro, also, (uncredited) directs Brando in many of the scenes here. Brando's character is flashier (as a fence) because he has to convince DeNiro's character to break his own rules to steal the scepter.
Seeing the legendary Marlon Brando in a role where he didn't have much screentime, but giving you a performance where you could laugh with his character and feel empathy for the character by the end of the film shows his genious.
I, also, loved Edward Norton in his dual role as the younger theif and as the night custodian Brian.  Norton didn't phone in his acting here.  He had me convinced at his first appearance that he was this mentally challenged guy on the streets of Montreal.  I was just as taken aback as Nick (DeNiro's character) to find out that this guy was a hustler.
Deniro's character, Nick, played a low-key smooth operator in this film. As a jazz club owner of NYC's (Nick's - get it?) he enjoyed that lifestyle.  Who wouldn't with the cool jazz artists that he had coming through performing there?  The set was a place that made you want to visit NYC's. It was, also, indicative of this man's personality.  On the other hand, he was ready to retire from the life of being a jewel thief; plans to settle with Diane (Angela Bassett) and own his club outright made him think it was worth the stretch.
Angela Bassett did a great job for the few times she was onscreen.  The chemistry between her and DeNiro was great and credible although brief.  She did show a reason why this guy would go for the final heist although other elements that he normally didn't take risk for kept coming into play.
I think his acting without saying a word after he buzzed her in indicated just how much he anticipated her visit with him, and shows his affection for this woman. Plus, he cooks a nice meal for her. How often do you see DeNiro's characters being so tender, romantic and subtle like that in a film?",1214697600,,2260,4.560493827160494

Fans of movies like ""The Italian Job"" and ""Foolproof"" should enjoy it.

1312543,5,B00003CY5H,"The Score is a perfect heist movie, because it brings in a lot of character development along with some good, human drama.  Robert De Niro stars as a man who is good at taking scores.  He is not just good at his craft, he is the best around.  Robert plays this character with perfection as a man who is meticulous, methodical and all business.  He never takes a big risk until one happens to present itself from his friend.  Soon there are multiple snags and setbacks that would scare off most amateurs, but again this man is the master of what he does, and that includes some mind games.

Enter Edward Norton, playing the part of the man on the ""inside"" of the big job.  Norton is superb in his character play of a mentally handicapped janitor at the facility where everything is going to take place.  He also brings out the youth and arrogance that his characters needs to be the opposite of the man Robert plays, and that sets the stage for some tense moments at the end of the film.

The humanity is the frustration of the person who is setting up the score, a man who knows his life is perhaps over if things do not go well.  None other than the legendary Marlon Brando plays this character.  De Niro's character also has a choice between a final take and a new life with a new love, a theme that is very similar to the one his character played in the 1995 Heist style film called ""Heat"" directed by Michael Mann.

The film has great action as well as breathtaking moments, whether it is high tech surveillance or the snatch and go itself, The Score plays out with some nice surprises till the very end.

1312639,3,B00003CY5H,"Edward Norton has come a long way from portraying the weird-looking punk, Jack,in this movie to the handsome, debonair Illutionist of 2006.  The story of a jazz club in Montreal run on dirty money was by Daniel Taylor.  Frank Oz directed.  The music was selected by Howard Shore.  I enjoyed M. Allison's song at the piano in the Club most of all.  The ending was the only surprise, but it was predictable.

There were a few complications with their planned theft.  Norton was a good actor as a handicapped employee (with symptoms of a stroke) who worked on the inside to help with the heist at the House of Commons.  He's sneaky but no one pays any attention to him, and he has access and keys to important places.  He was actually Jack Teller and not Brian at all.  Now, that took acting!  They made it look complicated as they avoided the security cameras.  Nero in that silly mask especially with the goggles, was almost comical.  It was all done by computers.  I wish I had more tech savvy and maybe I'd know how to restart my computer some hacker knocked out.  It was long and drawn out and I really got tired as it was not suspenseful, a lot of damage and sparks flying, but he was double crossed by Jack.

Or was he?  Jack was left hight and dry without so much as busfare to get out of town.  He was a con man, albeit a super smart one, but he was out-foxed by a pro who'd switched bags.

1312640,4,B00003CY5H,"Montreal is an inexpensive pace to film and can be made easily to resemble a confined space. It's also beautiful. And French.

In construction The Score owes a good deal to Jean-Pierre Melville's Le Cercle Rouge, and although it's in color, the feeling is black and white. The story centers around what is to be DeNiro's last heist, a 17th century French sceptre worth a  bundle. He works the job with the ever chameleon like Edward Norton. Their boss is Marlon Brando, and Angela Bassett plays the highly believable love interest.

The movie avoids cliches; the characters develop; and the action is arresting from the first. I confess I'd never even heard of this movie when I found it on cable one night. Too bad for me; it's terrific.

Director Franks Oz, the dark side of Sesame Street, does a fine job of creating a taut gangster flick, making moral judgements on a case by case basis rather than providing an overarching moral atmosphere a la francais.

If you've never seen The Score, you should. If you've wondered what a non-overblown American robbery movie looks like this is it. Oz's great accomplishment here,though, is letting the actors play their parts rather than imitate former screen incarnations. No mean feat in itself and a 'helluva' movie into the bargain.",1166659200,3,1279,4.848623853211009
1312641,5,B00003CY5H,"Granted, there is a certain sense of deja vu that comes from watching ""The Score"".  The De Niro character, Nick Wells, is extremely familiar, like a cross between the roles he played in ""Midnight Run"" and ""Heat"".  And that's not to mention the whole idea of Nick getting sucked into doing 'one last heist' by his associate partner Max, played by none other than Marlon Brando.

Despite the fact that it's somewhat lacking in originality, ""The Score"" makes for a hell of an entertaining movie anyway.  It's extremely suspenseful, thanks to the excellent pacing, and to an engagingly clever twist or two in the story.  De Niro is very much in his element in a role like this, and his performance is typically excellent, including the compelling interplay between him and Brando.  Edward Norton does double duty--he does a spot-on job of portraying a younger hotshot thief named Jack Teller who's out to prove himself; and he also does a mind-blowingly convincing job of portraying a mentally challenged janitor named Brian, used as an alter-ego to help Jack gain entry into the location where the heist will be talking place.  You might expect there to be a ton of violence in a movie like this, but actually, there's not very much at all, and with the suspense level being so high anyway, the effect is refreshing.

Ultimately, ""The Score"" is top-notch entertainment that delivers the goods.",1129507200,6,1390,4.860169491525424
1312642,4,B00003CY5H,"While I'm not going to tout THE SCORE as an Oscar-worthy masterpiece, it is certainly one of the best ""heist"" films that I have seen in a long time.  THE SCORE does everything right: it allows its incredibly talented acting performances to become the central focus of the movie and not the high-tech gadgetry that are the staple of cheaper thrillers.  To be sure, THE SCORE is not without technology, but what makes this film ""pop"" is the fact that we are drawn into the plot by De Niro, Brando, and the absolutely fantastic performance of Norton.  As in PRIMAL FEAR, Norton plays a split-role, doubling as both an overeager thief and a mentally-challenged night janitor (a role he adopts in order to gain access to the high-security facility).  His performance is, as always, very impressive and certainly above-par for ""heist"" films.

While some have complained of the slow pacing, I did not find it slow at all.  In fact, I enjoyed the slow build-up.  The first time you watch this movie, you will be wondering to yourself: ""How on earth are they going to get into that impenetrable safe?""  It will keep you guessing right up until the very end.  And just when you think you have a grip on the entire plot, it will twist on you.  I love it when films do that to you and THE SCORE does it in spades.  And the fact that the director has the patience to let the film build without going for cheap-thrills is a testament to his ability.

Once again, I'm not arguing that THE SCORE is the best movie I've seen lately.  But it is very much an entertainig thriller that is worth a look.  You will enjoy the action, the effects, and all of the usual things one finds in a ""heist"" film.  But you will also be surprised by the good acting.

An added plus is Marlon Brando in his last movie role, and he was, as always, great - and always Marlon.  A super treat, even if it did come out years ago.  An edge of your seat thriller, without all the gratuitous violence so loved by producers as a coverup for bad movies.

1312645,3,B00003CY5H,"THE SCORE has a pretty impressive pedigree:  Oscar winners Robert DeNiro and Marlon Brando; Oscar nominees Edward Norton and Angela Bassett; Oscar winning composer Howard Shore.  Under the astute direction of Frank Oz, THE SCORE is an intelligently made heist film.  Unfortunately, the only performance that goes beyond the conventional is Norton's.  As egocentric young Jack Teller, Norton actually plays a double role:  that of Jack and also of Brian, a seemingly retarded young man who works as a janitor at the Montreal Customs House.  Norton is perfect as the cordial, friendly young man who uses this ruse to find the location of a rare French scepter smuggled into Canada via a piano leg.  DeNiro is the veteran thief out to do one last score before settling down with his girl Angela Bassett and his nouveau jazz club.  Brando huffs and puffs his way through the role of DeNiro's compatriate who enlists his aid in stealing the scepter.  THE SCORE is like its jazzy background score:  smooth, silky, but ultimately bland and derivative.  Bassett is wasted in her role, and DeNiro merely seems to be playing himself.  As for Brando, any actor could have played the role just as well.  It is the combination of these actors, however, and especially Norton's bravura that makes THE SCORE entertaining in spite of its blandness.",1116460800,,1332,4.945945945945946

The story line, the exceptional acting and the superb use of understated music and sound make for an outstanding thriller-drama. Don't even hesitate buying this (or anything Edward Norton is in) on DVD.",1113782400,,485,4.843373493975903
1312759,4,B00003CY5H,"Nick Wells (Robert DeNiro) is an aging thief that is looking to retire. He has enough money, owns a nice jazz club in Toronto and just wants to settle back. His occasional girlfriend, a flight attendant, (Angela Bassett), is thrilled to hear the news and offers to get her route transferred to Toronto. Nick's longtime fence, Max (Marlon Brando), comes to him with a proposition. There is an item in Toronto's Custom House that a customer will pay very handsomely for. Nick is initially reluctant. He never does a job in his hometown. It is too risky. But Brian (Edward Norton) has an inside connection.

""The Score"", directed by Frank Oz, is the type of summer film that adults crave, yearn and salivate for. An intelligent film, with good to great performances, an involving story and great technical work. If you were brought up on MTV-style editing, forget about it. 'The Score' unfolds at a very deliberate pace, which some people have already commented is too slow. I disagree. The story unfolds slowly, in the first act, to incorporate a way of life that Nick is used to. As things gear up, so does the action. Oz has crafted a film that looks great, but doesn't push the style envelope too much.

DeNiro is, as usual, great. Nick Wells is tired and desperate to retire, but he wants to live a certain lifestyle and the lure of a sizable score brings him back into the fold. His character's relationship with Bassett's character is also good, but Bassett's character has about 15 minutes of screen time, if that. I found it interesting and fascinating to watch this character work and to get to know his life, likes and habits.

Norton creates a very unique and interesting character. To reveal too much about the character would reveal secrets about the film. Secrets that, unfortunately, the trailers and commercials reveal. Jackie is an interesting character, a novice thief who seems to bristle at the direction of the more experienced Nick. Norton is a great actor and he more than holds his own against DeNiro and Brando.

Brando is also very good. After a series of bizarre roles, he has toned down the theatrics quite a bit. Max Baron is a man afraid of losing his lifestyle as well. Since his lifestyle largely hinges on the work of Nick, he is hesitant to let Nick give up the work. Brando plays the role fairly simply. Occasionally, he does a bit of theatrical business but thankfully, no more wine buckets on his head.

I love caper and heist films. I love trying to figure out what is going to happen and to find out how the people carry the heist off. 'The Score' leads to a climatic robbery which is plotted extremely well. We follow Nick as he prepares for the heist, never revealing all of the plan, so that when the heist actually happens, there are still some surprises. This reminded me of a French film, from the 50s, called 'Riffifi'. Both films spend a lot of time detailing the preparations for the heist. Both films are very good and worth watching.

""The Score"" is a handsome film, filled with interesting performances and an engaging story. Go see it. Go. Stop sitting at your computer reading web postings.",1113350400,3,3141,4.6606498194945845
1312760,4,B00003CY5H,"There's a fence, a weary veteran safecracker, and an eager outsider.  There's a valuable whatsit in the Montreal Custom House that's guarded as if it were the crown jewels.  It ain't quite that, but it is a many-centuries old scepter that's worth tens of millions of dollars.  It's got `last big score' written all over it.  The eager young one has an assistant janitor job at the Custom House and is in the perfect position to case the joint, get the schematics, cut the video feed, what have you.

  Sound familiar?  Save for a end game twist or two THE SCORE is pretty much the same heist movie you've seen time and again.  It's a strong enough story that doesn't stray too far at all from the tried and true.  What sets this movie apart is its cast.  To say THE SCORE is actor rich is an understatement.  Its three leads - Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro, and Ed Norton - have all been hailed the greatest actors of their generation.  Brando plays the fence, De Niro the old pro who wants to pull off one last job before calling it quits, and Norton the neophyte looking for respect. Director Frank Oz wisely highlights characters and the `job' intrudes only when necessary.  With a different cast I probably wouldn't have liked this one nearly as much as I did, but Brando, De Niro, and Norton are all on their game and a joy to behold.

  The special features includes trailers, a short `making of' feature, a commentary track with Oz and cinematographer Rob Hahn and three or four unused scenes, one of which features Brando and De Niro improvising a scene.  The track lasts about four minutes and shows the two going through the same minute or so long bit of business three times.  I've never seen two actors of this caliber building a scene before, and it's fascinating to see them hit the same marks - Will you do it? , six million, I always pay your fair - while shading each take differently. It's my favorite four minutes on the dvd.

  What the heck, heist movies have been done but they're fun.  The characters in this movie are layered and interesting.  A strong recommendation for THE SCORE.",1113264000,19,2106,4.496042216358839

This movie has De Niro and the classic veteran actor Marlon Brando staring together, if you would have added Pacino and you would have had the HEATEDGODFATHER,but sadly you don't. The movie is good however though in that all the actors give there typical stellar performances, the most memorable being Edward Norton as a mentally retarded individual who convinces a whole Janitorial crew and security guards that he is this other person. Other than this fact everything else is very cliche and there is really nothing new here, just a heist film with all the thrills of ""we might get caught"" looming within it.

In that sense, The Score is a letdown, though if you're a fan of these great actors, you'll still have a good time watching it (be warned though - Brando doesn't appear all that often and usually he's in some dim, shadowy environment...)
What I liked about The Score, other than the actors, is that it takes its time providing us with all the details of the heist.  So many heist movies have stunts that seem entirely implausible; they don't explain much to the viewer and just count on the fact that we won't think too deeply about what's going on.  This one builds things slowly, while providing us with the tension and contrast between the characters - steady dependable De Niro and the hotshot, Ed Norton.  Don't expect much violence; this movie is about people using their wits and trying to trip each other up.  The ending is also deeply satisfying.",1089849600,,1036,4.664835164835165
1312825,4,B00003CY5H,"""The Score"" is a thriller with slow pace, but that is not a factor because two screen legends and the best actor of his generation are in the leading roles. So the semi-slow pace is an advantage, because Robert De Niro, Edward Norton and Marlon Brando displayed better their acting talent. I don't want them dodging bullets and climbing walls all the time, I want to see their performances.
However, ""The Score"" still has some stunts, and above all, a smart direction. The movie has a lot of interesting camera angles, a nice choreography for the stunts, cool gadgets, and a very welcome movie score, by Howard Shore. But that's just the icing in the cake, because the three actors are the main reason to see ""The Score"".
Robert De Niro's latest films aren't exactly nice movies, so perhaps ""The Score"" is the latest good movie that he has appear on. Also, ""The Score"" is the last chance to see Marlon Brando (R.I.P.) at the top of his game, we know that he didn't like his acting career very much, so ""The Score"" was the last time that he showed us his acting talent, perhaps because he was stimulated to share scenes with Robert De Niro and the promising Edward Norton.
The DVD doesn't have a lot of features, but they are good. The audio commentary is very informative because not only Frank Oz, the director of the movie shares his experiences, but also Rob Hahn, the director of photography reveals some tricks and resources used to film ""The Score"". The Behind-the-Scenes feature and the additional footage are really interesting, because we can see a lot of Marlon Brando's famous improvisation. So the DVD features are few, but they are solid, plus the audio and video quality are very good, because this is a recent film.
""The Score"" is not a groundbreaking film, but the cast is stunning, the plot is familiar but it's also interesting, the direction is smart, the music is good, and all that results in an amusing film. Specially recommendable for fans of Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando or Edward Norton.",1089849600,,2014,4.676056338028169

An old pro jewel thief, Nick Wells (Robert De Niro) is talked into one last heist by Max (Marlon Brando) for a centuries old scepter worth millions.  Max has him set up to partner with a volatile inside man, Jack Teller (Edward Norton) who works at Canadian Customs as a disabled assistant janitor, where the sceptre is securely  stored and guarded.  Nick wants to pay off his jazz club and marry Diane (Angela Bassett).  She wants him to quit his criminal pursuits as a condition.

Teller tries to make a double-cross, things go wrong, and that's what the story is about.  It is a good thriller, directed by De Niro and Frank Oz, who do a commendable job.

Altogether, a well acted, well directed story that is entirely entertaining.

You might find yourself moving closer and closer to the edge of your seat as this film's suspenseful climax slowly approaches. I think Director Frank Oz does a good job of gradually building the suspense as the movie progresses.
Edward Norton, who has a ""double"" role (of sorts) in the movie, also gives a knockout performance.  I found it worthwhile to replay several of Norton's hilarious scenes while he was in character as the half-witted janitor's helper.
And I really liked Marlon Brando in this film.  The then-76-year-old Brando, who portrays the slightly-quirky ""Max"", isn't too ""heavy-handed"" here; and comes through with a couple of knee-slapping lines of dialogue to boot during his brief amount of screen time.
The DVD of ""The Score"" offers up mighty fine video and audio quality.  The 2.35:1 Anamorphic Widescreen picture looks just about perfect to my eyes.
Extra Features include a ""Making The Score"" featurette (which lasts 12:25).  This is a fairly standard Making-Of program (but still nice to have on the disc), with a few behind-the-camera glimpses of the actors at work.
There are also three pieces of ""Additional Footage"" (total run time for these segments amounts to 7:58).  The first one is extremely intriguing.  It's a completely uncut, uninterrupted piece of film (5:05 in length) featuring Robert DeNiro and Marlon Brando discussing the heist and DeNiro's price for pulling off the job.  We see three versions of this scene within this one single unbroken strip of film -- each of which is slightly different from the others, with these two great acting legends improvising a lot of the dialogue along the way.  And each one of these differing ""takes"" is perfect.  They never blow a word in any of the versions.  The first version shown is the one that ended up in the final film; but the other two are just about as good (with Brando's rather racy remark in the last take being laugh-out-loud funny).
The other two items listed under ""Additional Footage"" are alternate takes from two scenes in the film.
Other DVD bonus materials include a Director's Commentary Track and the Theatrical Trailer.

Marlon Brando is helpless with the trite role assigned to him. Though De Niro plays the lead role in this flick, even his performance is limited by the action-oriented role, he plays. The starry-cast fails; but the suspense, the gizmos, and of course, Edward Norton save the day.
Edward Norton is full of life, zest, and enthusiasm. The dual role played be him, as a retarded housekeeper and as an adept thief, is pretty convincing and smartly enacted. The gadgets seem like con-jobs, but are however, pretty well-done and detailed. The computer-hacking part and the part about stealing the codes regarding the security system are overdone, and seem factitious and fatuous. The hacker-geek with a baneful mother is a lot more baneful than his squalling mother herself. Amidst of the many imperfections in the movie, it builds up steadily and interestingly to a well-written and well-directed climax. More than anything else, it is the climax of the movie, which makes it complete as an entertaining thriller.
With the kind of the star-cast it has, the movie is deceptive: It doesn't have substance, it doesn't have style, and it lacks maturity. If watched with keeping the brain aside to rest, it is thrilling and entertaining, and can be savored at best.

1312961,4,B00003CY5H,"Yes, the plot is familiar, BUT this one has three-generations of stellar actors: De Niro, Brando, and Norton who all deliver blue-ribbon performances.
World-weary safecracker De Niro agrees to one last job for old pal Brando's sake who is in a bind with the highly dangerous local crime syndicate.  The ""inside"" man is young, untested Ed Norton, a janitor at the Montreal Customs House where a priceless scepter is being stored. De Niro is tempted by the potential six million dollar payoff so he can retire to just being the owner of a jazz club.  The setup is complicated, the execution nerve wracking and the conclusion has a marvelous twist.
Brando as the opulently wealthy infallible set up man is wonderfully clever in his role.  To me, the chemistry between he and Norton was stronger and better balanced than between Brando and De Niro.  Always a danger when performing with Brando, De Niro seemed to fade a little when Brando was in the scene.  Norton is flat out brilliant as an icy young criminal.  He convinces his coworkers at the Customs House, he is a harmless, slightly palsied and retarded youth.  In this guise, he is lovably cheerful and guileless, a beautiful contrast to the cold, cynical crook that lies beneath.  De Niro gets a workout having to carry out the incredibly complex robbery where the tension level goes through the roof. Angela Bassett does what she can in a somewhat stereotyped role as De Niro's girlfriend.
This would be a 5-star caper movie except it has 2nd act troubles.  It sags a little in the middle and wanders off course.  When it finally gets to the nuts and bolts of the actual robbery, the film is gripping and tension is unremitting ably assisted by a fine musical score.  Don't miss it; the movie stands on its own.  Brando delivers not just a cameo or a walk-through for a paycheck, but a fine thinking performance. (How does he always make it seem so effortless?) De Niro is fine and gritty, if a little subdued and Norton is superb.

1312962,4,B00003CY5H,"All of the actors in this film are great.  And by great, I mean they easily disappear into their characters and become believeable.  The chemistry between DeNiro and Bassett works as does Marlon Brando, who it's almost impossible to believe is an actor.  Brando slips into character so easily that it's a little disturbing to see him in one performance to the next, he's both a presence larger than himself and at the same time invisible to being detected.  As always Ed Norton is very good too as someone who is ultimately challenging DeNiro's character to break his rules.
The problem with this film is the plot.  There's a lot of characters here but the plot isn't as meaty as they are.  I often complain about the letdown of the third act but somewhere there was distress in the secodn act, I believe and the third act balances the promise of the first but is lost to being a conenctive part to what the second should've built about.  The heist is a little simplsitic and the double cross apparent in a formulaic way.  I think that movies come up against the wall of Doing Harm to The Lead Characters as a plot derailer.  By having to avoid the ""hero"" either losing or dying, films have to redeem him or her at the end in often flat ways.

All the ingredients of a fine escape story are here - an impossible technical theft, an exploraton of the minds of heisters, visual tension that is matched by a fine musically scored atmosphere.  Add to this mix the bravado acting talents of Marlon Brando, Robert DeNiro, Angela Bassett, and the amazing Edward Norton and you have a terrific little diversion of a film that is reminiscent of that fine film standard TOPKAPI.

1312967,4,B00003CY5H,"The Score doesn't offer anything new to the heist genre, but the three generations of great actors coming together here makes this one worthwhile.
In many ways, the plot of this film is weak. A professional thief (Robert DeNiro) decides to do one more job before retiring from the business (that hasn't been done before, now has it?). His girlfriend (Angela Basset) is eager for him to put it behind him, but his boss (Marlon Brando) needs him to do the job of stealing a $30 million scepter to pay his way out of trouble, and enlists a cocky amateur (Edward Norton) to help his man.
The film, directed by Frank Oz, then follows the rules of the genre,  creating no new surprises, no unique twists, and only one thing that truly keeps your interest: The opportunity to see Brando and DeNiro together for the first time, with Norton in the mix. The three great actors from different generations coming together raises this mediocre film to another level. Sure it's a novelty device, but sometimes novelties are just so much fun.

1313048,3,B00003CY5H,"I picked this movie up at Blockbuster one night, attracted by the name of Edward Norton. Then I glanced at the others - Robet De Niro, Marlon Brando, Angela Bassett - and I was sold. There was no way that a movie with this much sheer acting muscle behind it could be bad.
Boy, was I had. The movie wasn't BAD; not by any means. But it was so ...ordinary... I was gaping in disbelief by the end.
De Niro plays an aging thief who wants to quit the business to settle down with his long-time girlfriend - played by Angela in a hugely expendable role. (To make it worse, the role was an even more huge squandering of her fine abilities.) Brando, as De Niro's character's boss and old friend, was also almost as unnecessary for the storyline to progress. He hardly appears in any scenes and the ones that he is in, his ""humor"" is tried, tired, and forced. Norton is the youngster; the newcomer who wants to take part in the heist of a priceless artifact and show off his smarts. Norton performed beautifully, as expected. But the role was so easy and unchallenging for him, you could visibly see him ""overacting,"" trying to wrig some dimension into his character of Jack.
But I could find little fault in the performances of this movie. It was the story itself that was too bogged down in cliche to really fly. As far as crime-caper movies go, this one didn't break any molds, and it even felt like it lacked a climax (but that could just be me). The lack of originality and genuine inspiration ultimately cancelled out any help the superb cast could have lent. All in all, a commendable try, but hardly worth making a fuss about.",1024876800,3,1625,4.42
1313049,5,B00003CY5H,The Score is the greatest movie ever made for one reason. This reason is the two janitors Danny and Bryan. If it weren't for them this movie would be awful. Danny and Bryan provide many comical moments. Probably some of the greatest comical moments in any movie. One of the best funny scenes in the movie is Bryan's New Shoes. On the DVD version you can go directly to this hilarious scene. I have watched this scene at least 27 times and have laughed everytime. Of course there are many other great scenes with Danny and Bryan unfortunetally you cannot get directly to them like you can with Bryan's New Shoes. I would recomend buying this movie and watching it every day.,1023235200,,673,4.524590163934426

1313051,4,B00003CY5H,"I have to admit, I rarely buy/see a movie based on the cast. That may seem nuts, but I prefer certain story lines. However, when you put Norton and De Niro in the same film, how can you NOT want to see it?
These two play off each other beautifully. Whoever was in charge of casting is either brilliant or damn lucky. The whole polished professional vs. up and commer was executed to perfection by these two. Each seeming to size up the shortcomings of the other... move, counter move. All very cool.
Why do I give it 4 stars instead of 5? I guess I would have to point to the editing. I felt like the pacing was off during the middle of the movie. I found myself thinking ""Ok... moving right along"" about halfway through. If that does not indicate poor pacing (for me anyway), I don'tknow what does.

1313052,4,B00003CY5H,"In THE SCORE, Robert De Niro stars as Nick Wells, an expert thief who specializes in high-stakes robberies but keeps a low profile.  Marlon Brando, as Nick's long-time friend Max, lures Nick back into the game for one last score.  This time, there's an inside guy:  Edward Norton starring as Jack Teller.  Jack is a very intense guy, very capable and demanding.  Nick is coldly cautious, owns a jazz club and is entering into a serious relationship with what looks like the love of his life.  Max is also deep in debt to deadly bookies.  While Nick is ready, willing and able to step away from the caper, he can't quite do it while leaving his long-time friend to twist in the wind.  So Nick risks all, stepping into the lion's mouth with a young, hardheaded thief, putting love in the balance and sticking with the friendship.  Nick is also breaking one of his cardinal rules by stealing inside his own town.
With dozens of movies behind him, ranging from comedies such as MEET THE PARENTS and ANALYZE THIS to tense, gritty urban pieces like A BRONX TALE, HEAT, and CASINO, and action adventure movies like 15 MINUTES, RONIN, and MIDNIGHT RUN, Robert De Niro has developed a captivating stage presence that often transcends character and plot.  Marlon Brando needs no introduction after having starred in THE WILD ONE, ON THE WATERFRONT, ONE-EYED JACKS, and THE GODFATHER.  Edward Norton has made his chops in PRIMAL FEAR, FIGHT CLUB, and AMERICAN HISTORY X.  Frank Oz, the director, has been responsible for THE DARK CRYSTAL, DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS, and WHAT ABOUT BOB?  Interestingly enough, Oz is also the voice of Miss Piggy of THE MUPPET SHOW and Yoda of STAR WARS fame.
The pacing of the movie was good and kept the viewer engaged with the various aspects of the heist.  Edward Nortan played a tough character that carried a dark edge with him constantly.  Robert De Niro came across naturally, as always--making him one of the favored multi-tasking actors such as Gene Hackman and Michael Caine that always deliver in whatever capacity they sign on for.  The actual robbery itself was done extremely well, moving all the various components of the plot constantly without letting go a single tense angle.
With all the talent available for the movie, the viewer has the right to expect a little more from the performances.  Brando and De Niro turn in solid performances, but a viewer might wonder how differently the movie might have played if Brando's role had been somewhat larger.  Norton did admirably, playing off both powerhouses and carrying his own in the scenes.  Angela Bassett was almost wasted in her role as Nick's girlfriend, but she provided Nick an anchor.  Norton's character might have been fleshed out a little better if more of his personal life was revealed.  Still, he did a fantastic job acting as Brian, the night janitor at the Customs House.
THE SCORE plays as a riff that most caper movie watchers have seen a number of times before.  There's always another story about a thief about to put his business behind him, except he can't get past the temptation of one more big haul.  Despite the familiarity of the plot line, THE SCORE is definitely worth watching.  People who have enjoyed THE HEIST, SWORDFISH, and OCEAN'S ELEVEN will find much to enjoy with this DVD offering.",1022371200,4,3308,4.783450704225352
1313053,4,B00003CY5H,"This heist story has all of the familiar elements.  Indeed, it's a familiar movie, but that doesn't mean that it's not good.  The story details De Niro's last job where Brando asks him to steal a priceless sceptre from an inpenetrable building in his home town.
So what's different here?  Edward Norton is the key element in this movie.  De Niro is an excellent actor but Norton simply has the more interesting role, and he certainly uses it to the best of his abilities.  Anyone who's seen 'Fight Club' or 'American History X' is no doubt aware of what Norton is capable of.  Here he plays the guy on the inside, passing himself off as a mentally-challenged cleaner whilst secretly he's a high-tech crook.  Both parts he keeps up in the air perfectly.
At the end of the day this is one where everything that you expect to happen does, right down to the obligatory twist at the end.  Still, it's efficient enough, especially in the actual heist itself even if I did find myself rooting for the wrong guy at the end.",1022112000,,1015,4.508196721311475

This film, however, gave me more than the mission; a vibrancy between De Niro, Norton, and that walrus, Brando.  De Niro was a safecracker belief.  Brando glued the suspense together. As to Edward Norton, he takes the stage; a real electrical performance as the ""inside man.""  Where did this chap come from?  He was sensational. This movie explained the meaning of serendipithy.

DeNiro is the main thief who works in association with Brando and is aided by Norton.  Norton does do an astonishing acting job portraying a retarded man, at his job in the customs house as a janitor, so that he can scope out the scene of his crime.  When he's not at work, he is ""normal"" and the character trait difference is extreme.  In fact, maybe this film had an overload of talent and should have just used Norton in this role as a solitary thief, especially since DeNiro and Brando don't get a chance to show off their similar range of ability.  A huge disappointment for me since I normally love Brando and DeNiro in anything.

1313170,3,B00003CY5H,"_The Score_ creates a wonderful atmosphere of hard-boiled tension, but that's about it. I should also mention it scores high on the celebrity factor with Brando playing a significant role in the film (that is, he's in more than one scene).  But when we get to the story, it's nothing more than a retelling of other older stories.
DeNiro's character, Nick Wells, is a veteran safecracker. The movie opens with Nick busting a safe at someone's house while a party is raging outside. After a travel montage depicting Nick's less than direct route back to his home in Quebec, we meet Max (played by Brando), the fence and the big guy who sets up Nicky with jobs. But Nick wants out of the whole thing. He's got this happenin' jazz club and his beautiful girlfriend, Diane, played by Angela Bassett. See where the movie's going? Anybody see _Carlito's Way_? Well, needless to say, Brando offers DeNiro the last big ""score"" and he can't refuse. And this time he's got to work with a partner, the impulsive Jack Teller (Ed Norton's role). Jack is an impersonator who's gets a job as a janitor at the site of the big score. He adopts the persona of a handicapped kid named Brian, and so no ones suspects him of anything and he stakes the place out while working the night shift. Norton deserves some recognition for this role since he does a convincing job acting handicapped.
So, Jack is the greenhorn, smart and talented but lacking experience and maturity. Nick is a straight player, by the books, a real stoic with a very even demeanor (trademark DeNiro). Picture this scene: DeNiro trying to talk sense into the kid (Norton), and he's calm, his plea is rational, it makes sense, but the kid is rash, stupid, and there's nothing Bobby-D can do because these kids just can't listen and do things right. They always gotta' be the hotshot! Well, that's how the film rolls out. See it for the nice cinematography and the big safecracking scene. But, if you haven't seen _Rififi_, you should see this film first. _The Score_is fun but it is a movie that will be forgotten.
Also: Bobby-D in his safecracking ninja suit bears an uncanny resemblance to a certain vigilante ductworker from an earlier film. Just thought I'd make the connection . . .",1017878400,,2236,4.660759493670886

If you believed that this was a good movie I ask you to watch it once more and try to imagine how the heist could possibly be pulled off in that manner, there are siply too many flaws to deal with.

1313174,4,B00003CY5H,"In all honesty, I originally rented ""The Score"" just to see the location footage of Montral. I hadn't read any reviews because I wanted the film to surprise me, and boy, it did! I was completely impressed with the rapport between De Niro, Norton and Brando as well as the appearance by Gary Farmer. As many have said before me, Angela Basset's screen time was limited to something like 10 minutes more or less, but she did a fantastic job as Nick's girlfriend--saucy, yet devoted, someone Nick can trust in and rely on, a rarity in his *other* field of work besides owning a jazz club.
The cinematography was superb, from creative Steadicam shots (walking through the narrow, narrow door to Nick's tool room in the intro, panning around cars) to fantastic reflection shots (the Customs House). Much emphasis is placed on smoky, atmospheric lighting, with shadows playing a crucial role in charater development (as Jack, Nick and Max talk, all three are equally cast in shadow so as not to single any one of them out as the potential ""winner takes all"").
The music is equally impressive, including solid, sultry jazz performances by Diana Krall, G Club, Cannonball Adderly, Cassandra Wilson, Thelonious Monk, Mose Allison, and others. Unfortunately, none of these songs are included on the ""The Score"" soundtrack. But they make the atmosphere of Nick's NYC Montral Jazz Club spring to life--smoky lights and cool blue jazz as a contrast to the tense heist scenes.
All of the actors do incredible work with their roles, especially De Niro and Norton. Norton's double character of Brian/Jack was certainly a surprise. I did not think that he was being overly disrespectful to the mentally retarded--I have read reviews that stated it as such, but Jack was merely playing a role.
De Niro certainly appeared to be the tortured thief, torn between his wanting to settle down with Diane and run his jazz club and that one last shot at glory that he goes for time and time again. ""How many times have you said that in 25 years?"" asks Max (Brando) when Nick says he's quitting for the umpteenth time. But Frank Oz's masterpiece shows us his dilemna in the silences and the shadows that surround Nick.
The DVD interactive menus were user friendly and graphically impressive at the same time, starting off with an explosion of sparks accompanied by the sound of a watch ticking and counting down. I was a little disappointed with the ""extra"" features: a theatrical trailer, a director's commentary with Frank Oz and Rob Hahn (which did have its interesting moments, but like so many commentaries there are long stretches of silence and totally irrelevant information), the ""making of"" (which was more a recap of movie footage than actual ""making of"", and additional scenes (one improv with Brando and De Niro at the bar, an alternate coffee shop scene with Norton and De Niro and a longer scene with Mose Allison singing ""City Home.""
Minor gripes: De Niro and Brando's French---aaaarrgh. That's all I can say. I cringed, I covered my ears...I actually switched the audio to French and listened to most of the film that way. That is a neat feature seeing as the film *is* in Montral, and some of the actors are francophone to begin with. The French dubbing was excellently done and followed very closely to the original script.
Lots of swearing, no nudity and no sex, some tense moments. The hacker character strongly reminded me of Burns Flipper from the PC game ""The Longest Journey""--totally stressed out, mentally unstable, obsessed with technology and both were compulsive swearaholics.
""The Score"" is a wonderful character/heist movie with a great setting (Montral), a killer jazz soundtrack, and three generations of stellar acting talent (Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro and Edward Norton). If you're looking for something new, something with a smoky,mysterious atmosphere and genuine white-knuckle-remote-clenching tension, pick up ""The Score""! (And then go visit Montral to see the beauty of Vieux Montral for yourself).",1016150400,,4016,4.986587183308495
1313251,3,B00003CY5H,"The score opens with De Niro's character cracking a safe (and needing reading glasses to do it) and being discovered by a young woman. Obviously shaken, he tells his fence Max(Marlon Brando, for what he probably cost the producers could've hired 100 of me and been just as well off) that he's quitting (his girlfiriend Angela Bassett wants him out too).Max wants him to do one more job a cocky new guy (Edward Norton)has come up with.
DeNiro's character isn't interested and says so, then tries to have Norton beaten up for pestering him. That doesn't work , he finally reluctantly agrees to the job on the condition that he runs every aspect. I thought that things developed pretty well through the story, even the small details looked very convincing to me. I liked the look of the theft itself, DeNiro being set up by Norton, the look on Norton's face when he realizes that the ""old"" guy he hated for telling him to be patient has in fact outfoxed HIM. I can't condone thievery, but it was well presented here, I'm not sure what I'd change  but mostly a good movie.",1015027200,3,1068,4.5625
1313252,4,B00003CY5H,"This movie has enough to be entertaining, though not the best performance of ANY of the actors in it.  Deniro is his usual gruff self.  While he is a great actor, watching the outtakes of him and Brando makes you think that he's done it all before.  Brando on the other hand, while good, is totally out of it and it comes across in the film.  He's trying, but he doesn't know he's there.  Norton is once again great.  This young actor is one of the best out there and delivers a great performance.
Now, the plot of this movie is pretty cool.  The whole heist thing keeps you interested and on the edge of your seat.  This combined with the acting makes this a really good movie.  Make sure to watch the special features to catch Brando out of it.  And yes, he was wearing pants as far as I could tell.",1014940800,,801,4.176470588235294
1313253,3,B00003CY5H,"This film turned out pretty well, though with a cast consisting of DeNiro, Brando, Bassett, and Norton, it's nigh-impossible to have a completely miserable failure. It was a pretty generic plot, but it was still entertaining, and I really enjoyed Frank Oz's direction. He made use of a lot of low camera shots and there were a number of scenes with very interesting blocking. Sure sure, DeNiro is the thief with a heart of gold who's just looking for His Last Big Score, and the love of his life
is about ready to leave him because she doesn't believe that This Time He Means It, No Really. Norton plays the young up-and-comer who's a bit too big for his britches. His cover character is ""Brian,"" an autistic janitor's assistant, which Norton plays brilliantly and convincingly. When not posing as Brian, Norton finds a few excuses to show off his upper torso in gratutous tank top & shirtless scenes. Hey, Ed? We get it that you've beefed up, ok? We got it in ""American History X;"" you're ripped. Fine.
But you still run like a girl.
Let's talk about the 400-lb gorilla that everyone pretends not to notice and finds uncomfortable to talk about; Marlon Brando. Four hundred pounds might actually be underestimating him, but I honestly can't hold his weight against him. There were times, though, a scene here and there, when all I could think of was a giant, sweaty, mumbling Sylvester the Cat. He's become a parody of himself with the lisping and the muttering and the heavy mouth breathing. His role is not particularly inspiring, though, so it wasn't as if he had a lot to work with.
Speaking of actors who have become nothing but their trademark schtick, I was pleased that DeNiro seemed to take himself less seriously than he has in other recent roles. In films such as ""Meet the Parents,"" ""Analyze This,"" and others, it's seemed as if he's doing an impression of himself, rather than trying to actually act. But this role reminds me of his Sam in ""Ronin,"" which was a nice change.
Angela Bassett's role was unfortunately very small - it had a lot of potential, but she wasn't ever allowed to get a full head of steam worked up. Alas.
I expected at least one more double-cross than there actually was, because the trailers pretty much gave away two of them - but that's all there were. Well, that's kind of disappointing. There's a little suspense here and there during the final half hour, when The Big Heist is actually taking place, but it's nothing we haven't seen before, and the new ""Ocean's 11"" does it better. Still, it's a decent bubble-gum-for-the-brain kind of movie, a good afternoon flick when you don't want to think about anything too heavy.",1014163200,,2662,4.665957446808511
1313254,4,B00003CY5H,"""The Score"" is a one-of-a-kind thrill ride of a heist movie that has three generations of highly acclaimed actors that you'll ever see in one movie: Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando, and Edward Norton, each arguably the single most talented actor of his generation. So what if the film they have chosen for their act-off is a minor heist drama? These three provide a heft that, for the two hours of watching this movie, makes director Frank Oz's ""The Score"" both pleasurable and involving.
De Niro stars as Nick Wells, an expert jewel thief who also happens to run a jazz club in Montreal. He has eluded the law for his entire career by sticking to his three rules:
1.) Avoid excessive risk.
2.) Always work alone.
3.) Never pull a job in the town where you live.
Nick is tempted to put aside those maxims when Max (Brando), a longtime friend and underworld crony, offers Nick $4 million to steal a jewel-encrusted 17th-century scepter from the Montreal Customs House. Nick agrees to the job, promising his flight attendant girlfriend (Angela Bassett, who hasn't been seen a whole lot in this film) that it'll be his last. But Nick soon develops some doubts both about the job and the ambitious young accomplice, Jack Teller (Norton), with whom Max has teamed him up with Nick. And one mistake, just one little mistake, could bring down not only Max and Jack, but Nick as well!
The number of scenes between Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro crackle, offering a fascinating clash of acting styles. (Of course, this is their first time onscreen together; they shared the role of Vito Corleone, with Brando in 1972's ""The Godfather"" and De Niro in 1974's ""The Godfather Part II"".) To me, I think that Edward Norton, whose character fakes being simpleminded at times, has the flashiest role, but smartly steps aside when both De Niro and Brando strut their stuff. The DVD version of ""The Score"" is very well-made with some extras including the making-of ""The Score"", the original trailer, and deleted scenes. Check ""The Score"" out and you'll agree that it's one of the excellently made caper movies around!",1014076800,5,2098,4.766483516483516

1313257,4,B00003CY5H,"Aren't heist movies great? Warm and familiar like a comfy old armchair, they are one of the oldest and (if done well) most enjoyable film genres around. You can sit back at the movie theatre with your popcorn in one hand or at home in front of the TV with a beer, safe in the knowledge that some craggy, world weary old thief set on retirement will be persuaded to do one last job, with a rookie understudy whom he doesn't trust, on a job which you just know won't go as smoothly as planned.
The Score is no different in that respect in that it stars Robert De Niro as a craggy old world weary thief, persuaded to take on one last high risk job before retiring. Ed Norton plays the rookie understudy scamming his employers by posing as Brian, a man with a disability and learning difficulties. Of course Robert De Niro's character Nick, always works alone and doesn't trust anybody but he is persuaded by his camp bloated old fence, Max (Marlon Brando) to work with Jack (Ed Norton). You see Max (Brando) is in up to his eyeballs in gambling debts and is likely to be forcibly shuffled off this mortal coil unless he comes up with the money, Jack (Norton) is working on the inside and Nick (De Niro) is the only man with the knowledge and the skills to get the job done.
Like most heist movies it's a bit of a slow burn build up, it's all about building up the tension until showtime. Inevitably there are a few scares along the way and Director Frank Oz (yes that's right Yoda, or at least the voice of Yoda) does a decent job in building up the tension. Of course one of the great draws of this movie is Frank Oz's coup in getting Brando, De Niro and Norton all on screen at the same time in the same movie. Brando was in his day was considered to be the world's greatest living actor, a mantle De Niro has carried for the past 20/25 years. Edward Norton is not far behind and is generally considered by many (including myself) to be the greatest actor of his generation on the back of great films (American History X, Fight Club) and great performances (Primal Fear, Rounders, Keeping The Faith, The People Versus Larry Flynt, Everybody Says I Love You).  Robert De Niro is of course reliably good but not at his brilliant best and it is Ed Norton in the dual role of Jack and Brian who has the meatiest part and adds some energy and vitality to the whole production. Marlon Brando's role however, is something of an oddity. It's not much more than a cameo and its something that he could do in his sleep, which is just as well because it looks like that's exactly what he did.
If there are any criticisms to be levelled at The Score it has to be on the basis that it really is a by the numbers crime caper and lacks none of the originality or vitality of something like Reservoir Dogs and nor does it really take full advantage of its AAA list cast. The opening sequences whilst interesting, perhaps lack the action and intensity you might wish, although they do serve as an insight into Jack's MO (he always works outside the country, he always plans meticulously, doesn't take chances and is never greedy). That said The Score is enjoyable first and foremost for its excellent cast and the opportunity to see them share screen time. Secondly the last forty minutes of the movie where we eventually get to witness the heist are excellent; the heist is great edge of your seat stuff and there are plenty of unexpected twists and turns and an excellent climax. Ultimately though, you are left with the feeling that you've seen this all before and done better. It's more like that trusty old arm chair, warm and comfortable rather than new and exciting. That said it's an enjoyable yarn. Good rather than great BUT still well worth a watch.",1013472000,51,3742,4.41534008683068

It's engrossing to see DeNiro, Brando, and Norton all share the screen with each other as the three best actors of their generation.  They're etched in their characters so well that they manage to hold the plot down as entertaining. Frank Oz, doing a complete 180 from any lightweight summer comedy he's directed, handles the material with finesse, with beautiful cinematography and a nice jazz score.

Anyway, the coolness factor is very high. De Niro as the experienced thief is great. Norton as the new guy is also good. The item to be stolen is well guarded. Norton is the inside man on this job.
The film moves along very quickly. Not a lot of the technical details or planning is explained. It would have been better if they would have gone into that a little more. But, they had Brando and De Niro. Probably too much $$$ involved to go that direction.

There's enough action to keep the movie moving along, but it doesn't take Felinni to see where it's headed fairly early on.  The video and audio quality are fine.  The audio is less dynamic than many modern movies, but that's OK since this wasn't meant to compete with bombastic titles.

The script and the direction (by the usually-reliable Frank Oz) never manage to generate any significant amount of suspense or heat, and several technical details of the overall plot are ludicrous. Ed Norton as the potentially-treacherous partner is ridiculous and a bit offensive in his impersonation (to penetrate the targeted facility) of someone suffering some form of brain damage. Brando might as well not be there at all and DeNiro has phoned in a performance that is so monotone no particular part of it stands out as offensive or interesting.
Almost the only interesting parts of the film are the details of safecracking; and you can see more of that, with better storis wrapped around it, in ""Breaking In"" or ""Thief"".

1313408,3,B00003CY5H,"***1/2 ""The Score"" is a fun, stylish return to the ""Rififi,"" ""Topkapi"" school of crime drama.  The object of this particular heist is a 17th Century royal scepter from France that happens to be languishing in the basement of the Montreal customhouse just asking to be taken.  One of the would-be takers is Nick Wells (Robert De Niro), a seasoned heister dreaming of the quiet life of retirement but compelled to do this one last job as a favor to Max (Marlon Brando), an old buddy in hock to some pretty dangerous mob figures.  Completing the triangle is Jack Teller (Edward Norton), a brilliant but brash young criminal mastermind whose high-risk temperament is placed in direct counterpoint to Nick's cool, levelheaded demeanor.
Perhaps the most amazing triumph for director Frank Oz is his success at pulling together this impressive cast of stellar heavyweights who cut across three generations of movie acting.  Of course, one might wish to see them in roles more demanding of their thespian talents, but we moviegoers will take these three superstars any way we can get them.  And ""The Score"" is certainly very entertaining on its own terms.  The technical elements involved in the planning of the heist are beautifully detailed from start to finish.  And Oz generates genuinely nail-biting suspense in many sequences involving close quarters and close calls.  In addition, the Montreal setting is novel and fresh and it is enhanced by some very impressive wide screen photography.
A film like ""The Score"" lives or dies based on the intricacy of its plotting and the expertise of its craft.  In both cases, ""The Score"" excels as an outstanding example of this noble and time-honored genre.

1313412,5,B00003CY5H,"This is a nicely crafted caper flick with a talented cast and a well conceived story.  The heist genre has been heavily sown over the years, so it is difficult to come up with a truly fresh storyline.  Still, there have been so many bad heist films that to see one of this caliber is a treat.
Robert DeNiro plays Nick, a thief who wants to do one big job to get out of the business.  Marlon Brando is Max, the fence who brings Nick together with Jack (Edward Norton), the inside man who conceived the job.  This standard setup is far from original and is a staple of this type of film.  What makes it excel is the way it unfolds.  Director Frank Oz, steps out from his outstanding career with the Muppets to take on a completely different type of project, performing quite admirably.  Oz unwinds the tale deliberately, taking time to develop relationships and motivations usually missing from heist flicks.  The result is an extremely believable yarn with characters whose behavior is consistent with motivations revealed throughout the film.
The story, which is a collaborative effort by four writers of little renown, is very tight.  They do a good job of creating a story that evolves effectively, adapting ingeniously to each little wrinkle they introduce.  While the probability of a double cross is pretty transparent, the ending twists a couple of times, first giving the viewer what he has been set up to expect and then delivering the unexpected.  That is good storytelling.
The acting is uniformly good from a cast of accomplished actors.  DeNiro doesn't break any new ground with this character, but Nick is so familiar to him that he can't help but deliver a terrific portrayal.  This may not be a career performance for DeNiro, but there are few actors I can think of who could have played this character any better.  Marlon Brando is a legend, of course, but he has not done anything of consequence since ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979).  Even that was a kind of grotesquely twisted character that came nowhere near some of his great performances starting with ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" (1951) through ""Godfather"" (1972).  This is the first film I have seen him in since 1979 that shows a glimmer of his true acting ability.  Though it is a small role, Brando interprets the character with subtle undertones and a raw power that we haven't seen from him in many years.
The new kid on the block (by comparison), but no less talented is Edward Norton.  I have been impressed by Norton's audacious style with each new film he has made.  Once again he adds to his range with this film, delivering a fantastic imitation of a palsied man as a cover for his inside work.  However, this is only a footnote to an otherwise powerful performance.  He conjures a seething arrogance and cunning resolve in a character determined to show the old timers how he is really the best and smartest of them all.  This is a fine addition to a growing resume of Norton's exceptional performances.
Though Angela Bassett's character is really superfluous, I must give her credit for an excellent job.  Bassett infuses great emotion and sincerity into a character that is little more than a motivational point of reference for Nick's behavior.  Still, she plays every scene flat out, making the most of a limited opportunity.
I was very impressed with this film on a number of levels.  I rated it a 9/10 on the strength of how it compares with the genre.  Even taken in a broader context, I would give it a 7/10 or 8/10 because it is such good filmmaking.  Though a bit slow for the action junkie, it is an engaging film with plenty of entertainment value.",1009843200,,3637,4.677672955974843
1313413,4,B00003CY5H,"If you're a Robert DeNiro fan, you'll enjoy this film.  The co-stars are Marlon Brando, Edward Norton and Angela Bassett.  The film starts out showing Deniro, who plays the thief Nick, a 25-year vet, narrowly escaping a heist.  He goes back to Montreal where he lives and owns a jazz club.  With appearances by Angela Bassett, who plays Nick's girlfriend, we discover she agrees to get more serious provided he quit his robbery ""business"" on the side. Marlon Brando then offers Nick the chance for a big payoff, one that will set him straight and allow him to pay off the mortgage on the jazz club and quit.  It would be his last gig.  It's tempting, but risky. The one catch is that the heist is right in Montreal, which goes against Nick's Number 1 rule, never pull a heist where you live or work. To top it all off, Edward Norton is introduced as the character Jack Teller.  Jack's front is the mentally [handicapped] character ""Brian"" who works the night shift at the very location where the heist is to go down.  Nick is resistant and untrusting of Jack/Brian, who provides blueprints and the plan for the heist, but needs Nick's expertise to pull it off.  After repeated warnings, Nick agrees to go ahead with the plan using Jack/Brian.  The rest of the film details the planning and execution of the heist, with a surprising twist at the end.  The film's action was continuous.  Overall, a good suspense film.",1009756800,,1416,4.62
1313527,2,B00003CY5H,"I saw a preview of The Score, when it came out in Theatres.  I was impressed by two things.  1)Robert De Niro. 2)Edward Norton.  That's it.  You shouldn't judge a book by it's cover, nor a film, entirly by the preview.  However with the actors billed, I figured it was worth a look.  And it is.
The best way I can describe this movie without giving away any hints is this: Picture a joke, with a punch line that takes only a sentence.  A one liner.  Now take that ""one liner"" and try to film it, using about 90 minutes.  That is what the score does.
Why do we root for the bad guy?  Do we root for the Bad guy because he's Robert De Niro, or Mel Gibson?  In this movie, I rooted for the bad guy, like were suppost to.  But why?  Why do we care if they are caught?
This movie doesn't make any sense because it doesn't surround any elements we really care about.  De Niro and Norton are great, and Angela Basset looks like she's only here because she's on contract.

If I could find one of these a month, I would be a happy guy.",1008806400,2,429,4.2439024390243905
1313529,4,B00003CY5H,"The Score is a quieter film than most were probably expecting.  It's not a film that is full of flash and style (Oceans 11) or one full of clever tough-guy dialogue (The Heist) or one that eliminates showing the audience crime preparations almost completely (Sexy Beast).  It's a quieter, darker film that feels grittier and seems to have been inspired by an Elmore Leonard novel.  There's a  surprising lack of pyrotechnics, over the top action sequences or breaking glass.
The film boasts the contributions of three superb actors: Robert DeNiro, Marlon Brando and Edward Norton. You might think that would encourage excessive scenery chewing behavior on the part of the participants.  It doesn't.  Everyone showed up for this assignment ready to work and make a good movie.  This means everyone in the film is very relaxed in their performances and rarely wear their ""I am a damn good actor and movie star too"" chops on their sleeves.

The actors trust their fellow actors and the script.  The script doesn't try too hard to make these characters overly witty, colorful, quirky or overly repellent either.  As we watch the set up and then the heist take place we actually find ourselves rooting for the criminals.  There are no Police chiefs playing cat and mouse with any of the master burglars.  The script however has some holes in it and it really needed another re-write to smooth some things out and cut out some extraenous material.
The film does have a few clich's and caught up in one of them is the utterly wasted love interest Angela Bassett.  She's given a couple of decently written dialogue scenes in which she is radiant, but almost any actress could have played the part. Bassett deserves more than being wasted in a nothing part.
  DeNiro plays a master safe-cracking thief named Nick Wells who lives in the old part of Montreal, Canada where he owns and manages a jazz club.  It's time for him to retire.  At his jazz club he is visited by Max, a Sydney Greenstreet type criminal czar played by Marlon Brando.  Max fronts Nick his expense money and usually has a buyer for the merchandise Nick steals.  He of course has a doozy of a proposition for Nick, but it involves robbing a nearly impenetrable fortress that is located in Montreal itself.  Nick Wells has a rule he doesn't want to break and that's robbing any place near where he lives.  He tries to turn the job down.  But this is too good of a job to turn down and it's worth 4 to 6 million dollars for Nick to say yes.  That's more than enough money to retire from the business, pay off the mortgage on his Jazz club and take care of his flight attendant girlfriend, Angela Bassett for the rest of his life.
Edward Norton plays the guy inside.  He plays Jack Teller who has been pretending to be slightly retarded  janitor named Brian  and has befriended his co-workers so completely they view him as an utterly harmless worker.  Jack's got the blue prints of the building, and knows where the valuable smuggled French jeweled Scepter (worth 30 million) is located.... But he needs Nick's skills and experience to pull it off.  Will the young upstart Jack take orders from old-timer Nick?  Is the whole deal a set-up doomed to fail?  Can they get away with it?
The last half-hour of the film is tense and suspenseful in the way few movies are anymore.  There are no speeding cars, no giant bombing raids, airline crashes, helicopter duels ---... just a couple of robbers trying to pull off a very complicated heist.
Credit Director Frank Oz for giving his actors the time in their various scenes to quietly interact with each other.  You haven't seen a film with this much breathing room in a long long time.  Perhaps leaving them completely to their own devices and not demanding something in particular from them meant Oz failed to gain the respect of Brando and the two had their problems relating on the set. . . but it also gives the audience some juicy performances.
Edward Norton has the most colorful role in the film and although it would be very easy for him to overdo it, he never does.  It's a marvelous performance and also uses the time he's given to great effect.  The beats of his acting are perfectly tuned.
The problem with the film is that besides the acting, the film's script not only has a couple of holes but is pretty bland refusing to reach very far for a clever line for a character to say, preferring to keep everything about the film low-key and unhurried.  The screenplay is by  Kario Salem, Lem Dobbs, Scott Marshall Smith  based on a story by  Daniel E. Taylor, and Kario Salem
The film's laid back pace, and lack of flash are on one hand refreshing in a summer full of some of the most god-awful excessive junk like Peal Harbor  or high concept noisy comedies like Cats and Dogs or action movie re-treads like Swordfish and Kiss of the Dragon.
DVD STUFF:
The Score has been given a good visual and audio transfer by Paramount.  A lot of the film is show with low light and the black levels are strong. The one looks and sounds very good on DVD.
There are a few worthwhile extras.  A behind the scenes puff piece featurette, a dry but very informative director and cinematographer feature length commentary and several alternate/extended scenes that are worth watching.

1313530,4,B00003CY5H,"I literally just finished watching this DVD minutes ago.  I wasn't expecting much, but ""The Score"" was definitely an entertaining film.  Just to clear up a couple of things, there definitely ARE surprises, contrary to what the editorial review says- I guarantee you'll crack a smile during the ending of this movie.  And for some reason, a previous review labeled the ending as a ""shootout"", which couldn't be farther from the truth.  Part of whst makes this movie stand out as above average is that it does't result to the cliche' ending that one might expect.  And that, in itself, is a surprise.
The only real dissapointment was that the interaction between the ""big 3"" wasn't quite as magical as I had anticipated.  Not that any of the 3 were at all bad, but we've seen them do so much more in the past. The high point is an exchange between Brando and De Niro in which Brando begs for De Niro's cooperation.  Norton gives a quality performance, but it's nowhere near the standard he set with ""Primal Fear"", ""Rounders"", or ""American History X"".
If nothing else, watch ""The Score"" just for a chance to see 3 of the greatest actors alive (albeit not in their greatest performances). Oceans Eleven has nothing on this cast!",1008460800,6,1224,4.665116279069768
1313531,4,B00003CY5H,"A superb cast, a continuously surprising plot, and breathless action sequences mark ""The Score"" as a terrific heist thriller in the tradition of the caper genre. Director Frank Oz has created a movie that deals out its suspense in spades, supplying the intelligent story with an intensity that one-ups itself right up to the finale. This is one of those movies that requires your utmost attention to its many intricacies; if you're like me, you'll readily accept.
There's not much to talk about in terms of fresh ground: everything seen here has been done in one way or another in many other heist films. The story introduces us to Nick Wells (Robert De Niro), an expert in lifting valuable items who has had enough of the scoring business and wants out. But not before his partner in crime, Max __ (Marlon Brando), pulls out the old ""one last job"" clich: this time, it involves sidestepping the high-tech security system of the Montreal Customhouse and lifting a precious scepter valued at thirty million dollars.
Nick is skeptical and hesitant about the job, especially after meeting Max's insider, Jack Teller (Edward Norton), whose ego tends to cloud his judgment once things get underway. Working as a night janitor under an assumed name and a mentally challenged demeanor, Jack supplies Nick with information vital to their success, from the location of surveillance cameras to the make and model of the safe that holds their goal. Meanwhile, on the outside, things begin to get murky, as Nick finds out the real reason for the heist, and Jack begins to lose sight of their plan.
To put it simply, this is an actor's movie, showcasing big-name talent in powerhouse ways. Take De Niro for instance, who starred in ""15 Minutes"" earlier this year as a New York City cop, and is now playing a criminal; two completely different characters, and yet he plays them as if they were one and the same. He may merely be playing De Niro, but he does it with a wit and presence all his own. Norton nails Jack to the wall, playing his egotistical attitude to sheer perfection while at the same time making us believe in Jack's knowledge of the facility's various areas. The film's other big-name stars, Brando and Angela Bassett, who plays Nick's girlfriend, make small appearances, but since so much of the central story focuses on De Niro and Norton's characters, it hardly matters.
The script, written by Kario Salem, Lem Dobbs and Scott Smith, is ingenious in the fact that it doesn't come off as an insult to the audience's intelligence. It's easily accessible to even the most clueless of moviegoers, allowing its logic to unfold in a manner that doesn't overload the mind. And with the exception of a few key points (why would a high-security facility allow access to its most vital areas to its janitors?), the plot comes through unscathed of logical pitfalls.
Anyone familiar with their heist and caper films will delight in pointing out the overused sequences and situations. The characters spend incredible amounts of time scoping the target, exchanging priceless lines of dialogue, gathering materials, all of which leads up to the big final act in which the actual heist will take place. But here's where ""The Score"" scores its points: it takes a well-known genre and whips it into shape with a heightened energy and intensity to match its smarts, building the suspense layer by layer as our characters get closer to attaining the scepter.
The third act of the film is the clincher, suspending us in time as we breathlessly await the outcome. In a certain way, we have to care for the characters, given the time and attention we have devoted to them as well as the story, which makes the film's final payoff a satisfying, if not totally original, conclusion. Looking past its reliance on familiarity, I think its safe to say that ""The Score"" is about three things: acting, energy, and smarts, and its meets these demands with supreme success.",1008374400,7,3947,4.8316100443131464

Both of them have acted the same role in the Godfather Trilogy) versus Edward Norton of the Fight Club. Edward Norton?s performance is very outstanding, and did not really show that he is a late comer in the industry, even when he was in the same scene with Marlon and Robert. The cast's performance is unquestionable, although the story was too slow and dragging at the beginning. If you like Sneakers, Mission Impossible or Thomas Crown Affair, this would be a movie that you would like - for it is talking about how professional, high-tech and scientific stealing things could be. As a result people would prefer to have more emphasis on the planning and actual actions in the movie, and less on other side lines stuff, especially when they don?t seem really relevant to the whole plot at all. Also, Angela Bassett who acts as Robert de Niro?s girlfriend is pretty disturbing, especially with her exaggerated attempts to make herself look sexy.

1313623,4,B00003CY5H,"This is an interesting entry in the heist movie genre.  Very few explosions or gunshots intrude on the plot.  The characters aren't exaggerated, but are made of real flesh and bone.  They don't have mannered quirks, and their shadowy pasts aren't rolled out in excruciating detail.  Rather, we get subtly drawn character studies, where the past is alluded to out of necessity, not as a crutch.  And the heist itself, the planning of which encompasses almost the film's entirety, is complex and logical, while still providing multiple opportunities for true suspense.
The cast is staggering.  How often do you get a chance to see the best actors from three separate generations together at one time?  And they all do fine jobs.  Relish this rare opportunity.
The knock on DeNiro here, and frankly I think people are reaching when trying to find a flaw in any of his performances, is that he ""sleepwalks"" through the movie.  True, his Nick is not a flashy man.  Even though he owns a hip jazz club and is a noted thief on the side -- two supposedly glamourous occupations -- he is very low key.  But that's a necessary character trait.  He's learned that to be thoughtful and deliberate is the best way to ensure that his risky moonlighting job is not so risky.  Watch him in one of his first scenes with Edward Norton's character: Norton's Jack, a young upstart thief, lays out his risky plan in all its intricate detail.  Nick just stares off to the side, never making eye contact, but carefully considering what he's hearing without any distractions.  You can see DeNiro in deep thought here.  Pay attention to that, and I guarantee you'll find his character fascinating.
Norton is DeNiro's equal in every way.  His Jack is a know-it-all punk, a character we've seen time and time again.  But Norton somehow manages to make him a unique creation.  Jack's got a fiery intensity, and he's whip smart too.  But he knows that he has a lot to learn, and is quite willing.  And he's not a perfect thief-machine; he knows that things can go wrong with the plan, and even though he's ready to improvise, you can see his nerves jump when they do.  Witness one scene where he's serving as a lookout for Nick, and all of the sudden a policeman emerges from inside a nearby store.  Jack jumps into gear, quickly trying to divert the policeman's attention, but breathing and sweating heavily the whole time.  The showiest part of Norton's performance is his role-within-a-role work as Brian, a retarded janitor.  Brian serves as a cover so Jack can discretely study his target, the Montreal Customs House.  Jack as Brian provides some of the film's funnier moments, as the audience knows that his stray comments are really subtle digs at his oblivious co-workers' ignorance and incompetence.
Marlon Brando is lively, even though he's long from being lithe.  It's uncomfortable watching this gargantuan man walk into a room (remembering the thundering physicality of his ""Streetcar Named Desire""/""On the Waterfront"" years).  But once he's settled into a chair, and free to use his voice and his hands, you remember why he's generally considered the greatest actor of his (or any other) generation.  Compared to Nick's conservative character, Brando's Max is an entertaining and eccentric creation.  He's quick with a quip, and more than willing to tell those around him exactly what they want to hear in order to get his way.  You can't get away from the fact that he's fascinating to watch.  Too bad his role wasn't bigger; the film could've used more of his energy.
Angela Bassett barely even registers.  Well, to be truthful, she does fine with what's she's given.  But I can't remember a more superfluous character in a suspense thriller.  She has no function, either for exposition or motivation.  Some would say that her character offers drama, in that her ultimatum to Nick gives him opportunity to re-consider doing this last job.  But he was already re-considering his decision.  So she's really just reminding him that he's re-considering!  How redundant.  It seems that the filmmaker's were just throwing a bone at convention, assuming that every movie needs a romantic interest.  If her character were cut completely, the story would not change one iota.
It was great to see a Canadian city (granted not a Canadian city that I'm overly familiar with) get such significant face time.  Montreal worked wonderfully as the setting for the heist, it's old world charm providing interesting visuals; it's labyrinthine streets providing further opportunities for something to go wrong.  Although, hearing DeNiro and Brando stumble through their French dialogue did provide some moments of unintended comedy.
""The Score"" is not the greatest heist movie ever made.  In fact, its story is quite run-of-the-mill.  What makes it a quality movie is its patience with the plot (credit to director Frank Oz; who knew this ex-Muppetteer had such a class touch?), and it's legendary class that delivers a series of absorbing performances.",1006819200,12,5020,4.937947494033413

Marlon Brando is energetic and memorable as the crime ring guru who insists De Niro does one more job before retiring: an ancient royal relic now in custody at the Montreal customs office. Not only is he pushed into doing this job, but De Niro is also faced with taking on a new partner (Edward Norton), who may not be as devoted to the team as he seems.

It screams ""sophisticated adults only"", from the big name cast to the cod-jazz soundtrack to the faux-european setting (Montreal doubles for what probably should have been Paris or London).  To its credit, with the exception of ""The Crimson Rivers"" it is the only big-budget film this year with a plot that keeps working all the way to the end of the 3rd act, and where the French film's plot finally collapses into the improbable this one stays true to its self-imposed ""reality"" and delivers an obvious but effective double-twist.",1002153600,,856,4.802721088435374

The film starts off slow giving you an understanding of who Robert De Niro's character is and what his intentions are for his future retirement from the robbery business.  It slowly builds in suspense as De Niro's character is forced to make tough decisions about his life and this heist he has to pull off.  One of the best scenes is where De Niro and Norton's character are meeting two guys in a park to exchange information about a fortress's security system.  One  of the guys they are talking to becomes a little unstable and almost shoots Norton's character Jack in the chest.  This scene was very intense and captivating.

1313710,4,B00003CY5H,"No matter who you are, where you go or what you do, it seems that life is always waiting with a new lesson to teach you; sometimes it's a matter of experience versus youth, other times it's just a matter of having the sense to follow your own instincts.  Whichever it is, sometimes it can get really interesting-- to say the least-- especially when it involves a couple of interesting guys; one who just doesn't know enough, while the other violates a cardinal rule he's already learned but chooses to ignore.  And the fact that they've been brought together by a third party who has his own agenda makes it even better, which is what happens in ""The Score,"" directed by Frank Oz and starring Robert De Niro, Edward Norton, Marlon Brando and Angela Bassett.
 Nick Wells (De Niro) owns a jazz club in Montreal; he's a solid, tax-paying everyday citizen.  He's also never met a safe he couldn't crack.  At least in his own territory.  Part of his success is that he's smart-- his extracurricular activities always take him across the border, to either the U.S. or Europe.  At home, he's clean.  And that's his cardinal rule:  You live in your own country, but take down scores elsewhere.  It's one of life's lessons that has served him well.
 One day, however, his associate, Max Baron (Brando) approaches him with an offer he can't refuse.  It involves the Customs House right in his own backyard, Montreal.  Max, it seems, has an inside guy there, Jackie Teller (Norton), who knows the layout and also knows of a certain item kept in a certain safe that if appropriated could set the three of them up for life.  Or perhaps send them up for life.  And that's the rub.  When does the value of the score finally outweigh the risks?  It's a question Nick has to answer, and quickly, because he's the key to the whole operation and Max is in a hurry.  Jackie can get them in, but Nick's the only one who can open the safe.  So the ball is in his court.  But the risk is huge, and Nick's got a lot at stake-- like everything he's worked his whole life for, as well as the woman he loves, Diane (Angela Bassett), whom he's been keeping in the wings for too long already.  It's a tough decision, but this one more score would set him up for life, and it's practically a sure thing.  And who can pass up a sure thing, even if it is one of the basic lessons life teaches everyone somewhere along the line:  There's no such thing as a sure thing, and If it looks too good to be true, it always is.
 Working from a clever and exacting screenplay (by Kario Salem, Lem Dobbs and Scott Marshall Smith), director Oz (with some uncredited help from De Niro) sets the stage for the caper nicely, giving you time to get to know the characters and what makes them tick.  From the opening he sets a deliberate pace which works perfectly for this character and dialogue driven story, because it's the people and the decisions they make that gives what they do an impact, and ultimately heightens the tension that builds quickly as the crime is being played out.  Throw in the fact that there's a couple of unexpected twists along the way, and it makes for quite a show.  Of course, having one of the most exciting casts ever to be assembled for a movie didn't hurt Oz's efforts either.  Having three of the greatest actors of their respective generations together in a film, then supplementing them with the beautiful and talented Angela Bassett takes this project to a level for which a category hasn't even been created yet.
 With another impeccable performance, De Niro continues to delight and amaze.  He can take a basically regular guy like Nick (okay, he's got some interesting habits, like cracking safes, but other than that he's just another guy) and make him unique and interesting, beginning with the attitude and working his way from the inside out to create a complete character, emotionally and physically.  It's that chameleon quality, that ability to disappear so completely inside the character that sets De Niro apart from just about every other actor you'll ever see.  And, ironically, one of them just happens to be his co-star here.  His name is Brando.
 Since he began his career, Marlon Brando has been larger than life and an actor's actor.  He's always been a character actor in leading roles, but now, with age, his ability to create a genuine character, to bring someone to life on the screen, is better than ever.  There's a richness to his portrayal of Max that is totally affecting; he's become the Sydney Greenstreet of the new millennium, and hopefully we'll see a lot more of him in roles like this one.
 And proving that he can more than hold his own with the giants of his profession, Edward Norton turns in a credible and totally convincing performance as Jackie.  Of all of the stars of this generation, Norton just may be the heir apparent to his co-stars here.  It's a rare treat to see three actors of this caliber together, and that alone qualifies this film for a footnote in cinematic history.
 Angela Bassett makes the most of her limited screen time, meanwhile; her scenes with De Niro really click, and there's some undeniable chemistry between them.  Her part may be fairly small, but it's the relationship between Nick and Diane that enhances the drama of Nick's final decision, and that makes it a big part of ""The Score,"" and one of the reasons this is one film you do not want to miss.",996624000,5,5415,4.564182194616977

As I mentioned, I was concerned about seeing De Niro re-runs, but in The Score I really felt he delivered something that, while familiar, was also new. For any of you Marlon Brando fans, you've got to check out The Score; I thought he was fantastic, and I laughed out loud when I heard that he refused to let Frank Oz be on the set when he did his work, declaring ""I won't work with a Mupppet Man""! The Score is a nice caper movie, it runs at a much slower pace than most caper films, and it spends a lot more time on characters and character interaction. Ed Norton didn't disappoint, and although the movie doesn't have much new to offer the caper genre, it's worth checking out just for the acting.

Directed by Frank Oz his work was a step to the side, more or less, for him with such hit comedies as ""Bowfinger"", ""In & Out"", and What About Bob?""  Mind you, ""The Score"" is not a perfect movie. There are a couple of large holes in the plot, particularly some things that happen toward the end. But it's so much fun watching this cast work together that it really doesn't matter.  The title refers to a difficult task presented before thief Nick Wells (Robert De Niro) with a most profitable outcome.  All that is going on with his successful Montreal jazz club and his stewardess girlfriend, Diane (Angela Bassett who doesnt get much screen time as I had hoped for), he could gain money for his participation in ripping off the U.S. Customs house to finally settle down in his new law abiding life.  The U.S. Customs house has confiscated a rare French piece of national treasure.  The only eyes that have bared witness to it's being are the U.S. Customs agents and the ""inside man"" named Jack Tellar (Edward Norton) with his alter ego attitude who mops the floors as a janitor inside the U.S. Customs house.  In spite of the risks involved, Wells decides to go ahead with the ""score"" even with his financial partner Max (Marlon Brando) breathing down his neck with suspicious untold truths.  With a change in genre for Oz, my hat goes off to this film.  With this star filled cast and jazzy score by composer Howard Shore, everything fit into place.  The cast shared a give-and-take relationship between each other.  I sensed at one point that Brando was ad living a few times on screen with De Niro, but still gave the two main characters a chance, De Niro and Norton, to earn the spotlight.",996019200,,1825,4.567484662576687

Robert De Niro plays Nick Wells, an aging thief who wants to get out of the business and settle down with his flight attendent girlfriend Diane, played by Angela Bassett. Ed Norton plays upstart thief Jackie Teller, who sometimes masquerades as retarded janitor Brian. And my favorite actor in the world, Marlon Brando, plays Nick's fence and mentor Max Baron.
The film has Nick drawn back once more for a final steal, a royal specter hidden in Montreal, Canada. He teams up with Jackie in order to steal the scepter and make their fortunes. Of course, there is conflict. Nick doesn't want to team up with Jackie; he has never worked with a partner before. ....Unfortunately, things go awry and there is some backstabbing towards the end. ....

The premise is old, but ""The Score"" seems fresh. Much of that is, of course, thanks to the cast. Only Angela Bassett is wasted, but let's face it: with Edward Norton, Robert DeNiro and Marlon Brando, the best actors of their respective generations, you're not paying a whole lot of attention to anyone else.
What's more, ""The Score"" has some of the tensest scenes of any movie I've seen in a while. Yet, its action happens with very little violence and almost no gunplay. Most of it takes place in the character interaction and the audience's investment in the characters' fates, a tough job to pull off.

Anywho, De Niro is Nick, a veteran safe cracker who hits a party in mid-swing and makes a near clean getaway. He returns to Montreal, his home now, to his jazz club and flight attendant girlfriend Diane played by Anglea Bassett (if you're a fan of hers, get your fix early because she pulls a disappearing act of her own the whole middle act.) Nick's boss, I guess, is Marlon Brando's Max, who also happens to be the comic relief. He's got this big job, the mother of all scores (for them anyway) but it requires them to do it in their own town, something which sets Nick off but good. He's eventually convinced by Max and his young friend Jack (Norton) who has taken up a job at Montreal's customs house (where the loot is) under the alias of Brian, a mentally disabled assistant janitor. The middle act is all about how they intend to rob the customs house and steal this jewel-encrusted scepter that can be sold for a large bit of cash. The end, if you've payed any attention to the trailer is quite predictable, but then again you get the feeling through the entire movie that it could really be no other way ... so in it's own sense it is satisfying.

Which he plays so well you'll start to feel sorry for him just as if he really was mentally disabled.  While Robert De Niro plays his criminal role with a little slice of lemon sparking his character one step up from your average jewel thief.

This movie is best when it sticks to its main plot; supporting plots about the relationships DeNiro has with the characters portrayed by Marlon Brando and Angela Bassett really do nothing for the movie, and distract viewers from the central point. DeNiro gives a less than energetic performance.  He's still pretty good, but I'd also add quite average by DeNiro standards.

However, a much better movie called Entrapment handled a similar storyline a few years back in '99. The movie stars Robert DeNiro and Edward Norton. I was excited initially to see these actors working together. Norton, one of the best young actors in Hollywood right now, does an excellent job playing the role of the ...... Ahem, excuse me... Mentally Challenged character &#8220;Brian&#8221; in the film, even better than Giovani Ribisi did in The Other Sister.  Unfortunately, DeNiro and Norton have absolutely no chemistry together.  So many actors have made wonderful parings in movies. Some that leap to mind are Glover and Gibson, Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, Schwarzenegger and DeVito... Unfortunately, DeNiro and Norton's characters seem to just hate each other throughout the entire film.  It is funny but in films, you often don't notice chemistry until it isn't there. Minor credit goes to Marlon Brando as the fence who cannot seem to take five steps without being out of breath and Angela Basset, who is never really convincing as DeNiro's love interest. Both play rather unappealing and less interesting characters. This apparent hatred between DeNiro and Norton's characters (perhaps what the director intended) leaves the predictable betrayal at the end of the movie with absolutely no heart and you find yourself not even caring because you are barely invested in the characters. Taken as a whole, the story is fairly stagnant and predictable. Some movies you need to see in the theater. The Score is one that you can wait until video for. The preview for the film made it look like all four of the stars were in on the heist and would play each other, leaving you wonder who would finally double cross who and who would eventually make it out on top.  Instead, only two are going for the score and it is all too obvious who the good guys are and who the bad guys are. Moreover, with no worthwhile previews, it was a disappointing trip to the movies. One and a half out of five stars. So, a potential miracle shot from the half court at the buzzer that instead turns into an air ball.

1314012,4,B00003CY5H,"An excellent movie is more than the sum total of its parts. With Robert DeNiro, Marlon Brando, and Ed Norton as protagonists, this movie manages to be quite good, but certainly not excellent. Marlon Brando and Robert DeNiro are surprisingly weak in their respective roles of ""the arranger"" and ""the master thief"", providing characters that are believable but not truly memorable.
Ed Norton manages to create a vivid character in his rendition of an ambitious, talented, but novice criminal who has valuable insider information critical to the planned heist. Without Norton's role, I would have probably slept through the movie as DeNiro and Brando were effectively on autopilot. If you are watching this movie to see DeNiro and Brando at their finest, turn elsewhere.
This movie showcases Norton who appears 1/4 of the way into the movie, so before his arrival you'll probably find yourself saying to yourself, ""This is a really, really slow movie."" But when Norton enters the scene, there is actual tension and dramatic suspense. You'll find yourself caring about the characters, and actively wondering whether they'll be able to pull off the heist. There is even some comic relief in Norton's dual role of the calculating, ruthless criminal on the one hand and the naive, mentally challenged janitor on the other.
So, the first 25% of the movie is mediocre. The second 25% of the movie which sets up the heist is good, and the last half is almost excellent. You'll also see some twists in the plot near the end.

I liked it a little more than Sexy Beast and a lot more than Snatch, because director Frank Oz, unlike Jonathan Glazer and Guy Ritchie, isn't always throwing his technique in our faces. The Score doesn't pretend to be anything but an old-fashioned crime thriller, and it succeeds extremely well at it, not least because it is so beautifully cast. To see Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro and Edward Norton on screen together is the thespian equivalent of a six-course dinner at the Ritz. And if Brando looks as if he's consumed a few too many such dinners--his character here is a cross between Sydney Greenstreet and Truman Capote--it is still wonderful to see him again, and to see that he's still very much at the top of his acting game. As superb as the three male stars are, special mention must also be made of Angela Bassett, who brings charm and radiance to her small role as De Niro's girlfriend.

The cinematography is beautiful and even without the cast, the visual elements alone -- the film noir lighting and atmosphere, the elegant and stylish set designs, the framing, and the editing -- make this a very enjoyable film.
Although some reviewers comment that DeNiro is on ""autopilot"" or that he and Norton ""phone in their performance,"" this is not true at all.  DeNiro delivers a very smooth and appropriately subtle character without going ""over the top"".  Likewise, Norton also gives a very good performance.
Each character in each film should be viewed on its own merit.  People who are disappointed because they don't see the ""fireworks"" of DeNiro in ""The Deer Hunter"" or Norton in ""American History X"", frankly, should go see those movies instead.  DeNiro and Norton both are right on the mark for this movie.
Marlon Brando brings comic relief with his superb timing and lines that land every time.  Angela Bassett also is very good and shares the scenes nicely with DeNiro, which is no easy task.
The heist is a genre that arguably has been overdone and is almost a cliche, but in this film, the direction is excellent and the editing, the pace, and the rhythm all support the suspense and the tension that kept me on the edge throughout.
There are a few weaknesses, however.  Although the music score is good at the beginning, by the third or fourth time the same melody appears, it stops being a motif and turns instead into a bit of a bore.  A definite cliche that we can do without is the proverbial computer hacker.
All in all, this film provides for a nice movie experience and is worth owning on DVD.  A must see for DeNiro fans.",995068800,27,1845,4.798107255520505

I never really liked Robert DeNiro because of roles like Taxi Driver and especially Cape Fear he just always kind of creeped me out.  But after doing things like Analyze This and Meet The Parents.  He seemed to lighten up.  This and Ronin which is also excellent are my two favorite movies by him.  And Edward Norton is very good in this too.  This and the Illusonist are my two favorite movies of his.
And I never really liked Marlon Brando either.  I always thought he was way over rated.  He has a key role in this.  Although his weight has ballooned so much it looks like it was hard for him to get around and breath at the same time.  And I love movies where one person out smarts everybody.  And this and F/X are my two favorite movies for that.  I definitly did not see the end of this one coming.  This is a very good movie all the way around.",1518307200,,905,4.132183908045977
