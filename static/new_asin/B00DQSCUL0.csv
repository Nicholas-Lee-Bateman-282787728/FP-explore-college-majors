5847968,5,B00DQSCUL0,"I am so glad I waited to purchase these movies on BluRay.  I purchased some earlier movies converted from DVD to BluRay format when they first started doing it, & it was kind of like copying the VHS to DVD.  They still had the grainy look to the earlier movies, and especially the movies from the 80's & 90's before BluRay was around.  Now the clarity is incredible!!  These movies look crystal clear!!",1402444800,3,402,4.465753424657534

5847978,5,B00DQSCUL0,"Solid package for an incredible price. If you are a fan on one or all, this is the deal!!! I wanted The Firm & the price alone for The Firm Blu Ray was the price of this three pack. It is on three discs. Collateral has the DTS track on it, Days of Thunder & The Firm are in Dolby Digital. All three sound & look incredible. Director's (the late Tony Scott & Sydney Pollack) & Michael Mann.......the night is your's my friends!!!) Enjoy!!!!",1414540800,4,439,4.238095238095238
