6824950,5,B00PXDUIT2,"This is a very tense film about a group of post WW II ex-German soldiers assigned to defuse Allied bombs buried among the rubble in the city of Berlin. It is a British production with a mainly Hollywood cast with French actress Martine Carol (of Lola Montez fame) providing the romantic interest. It is not an action film, the suspense deriving from who is going to die next as they try to disable the still deadly bombs. It was shot on real jaw dropping locations with interiors done at the UFA Studios. Under Robert Aldrichs (The Dirty Dozen, Kiss Me, Deadly and Baby Jane) direction it has a very gritty look and feel. Not recommended for everyone, as the pace is aptly slow by todays CGI and deafening music track standards. But if you start the movie, you will be drawn in for sure. BTW, for Jeff Chandler fans, quite uncharacteristically, he plays the heavy something youll have to get used to.",1429315200,7,900,4.561728395061729
