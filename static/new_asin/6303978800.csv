7857813,4,6303978800,This is way above average for a telemovie of the era and holds its own today despite the limitations of the format at the time.  The performances have heart and soul if by current standards they feel a little constrained and theatrical.  Nonethless a sterling effort that repays viewing.,1510617600,,287,4.836734693877551

7857815,5,6303978800,"I bought this DVD because I had seen only the end of one episode on television years ago. I think it is one of the best programs ever on a marrigae falling apart, especially with the fabulous actress, Blythe Danner in the role of the wife! I was not used to seeing Michael Moriarty in the role of a ""jerk"" but he played the role of a bad husband exceptionally well. It's a sad, but beautifully acted and scripted production.",1490486400,,424,4.3125
7857816,3,6303978800,"My take on this movie is that the husband is bi-sexual.  The setting of the movie starts in 1957 when being gay is taboo.  After walking a beautiful woman home, at the wife's suggestion, (Why not call her a cab?) he had no interest in her, even though she literally threw herself at him.  The wife had an analyst, the husband had no interest in one.  The husband suggested that their marriage was perfect except for sex, and he suggested that they stop having sex.  Can you imagine a hetro man wanting to stop having sex with his beautiful young wife?  At one of the wife's sessions, she told the analyst of their agreement to stop having sex, so the analyst asked, who suggested it and the wife answered, ""who do you think""?  (The analyst accepted this without further comment, as if he had knowledge of the husbands sexuality.)  The wife admitted having sex with other men but the husband never admitted having sex with other women.  There was at least one bedroom scene of the wife with another man, but none with the husband and another woman.  A woman told the wife that she had had Dinner the husband, but only because he was so lonely.  This movie was adapted from short stories originally published in The New Yorker magazine, who was well known for jokes and stories that only subscribers understood. (Us mortals are unfit for New Yorker stuff!)",1413072000,2,1354,4.576763485477178
7857817,5,6303978800,"""Too Far to Go"" is such a good title because it was such a little distance, but it was ""too far"".
There may be other movies about this type of divorce, but this was one of the first and best.
And it is a type of divorce under-represented in the media with no screaming and blowups.
The divorce proceeds like a glacier---and nothing anyone does short of instant global warming will stop it.",1265760000,2,389,4.342465753424658
7857818,3,6303978800,"Fact:  Michael Moriarty is simply incapable of being boring---even when miscast as he is here and saddled with an absurd New England accent that makes him sound like the Stage Manager in Our Town.  In spite of these factors, I found my eyes glued on him for the length of this film---ditto for Blythe Danner, an actress of equal intelligence, sensitivity, and grace who is also miscast.  These two youthful performers (the film was made 24 years ago) portray middle-aged suburbanites who, despite the presence of numerous children (one college-aged who looks older than her father)seem to have nothing better to do than ask each other questions like ""Have you taken a lover?""  Nevertheless, there are fascinating moments here:  a couple of love scenes (too short for my money), a touching scene in which the couple announce their impending divorce to their children (if only the camera had been closer to the actors' faces) and a brief but delightful scene with Glenn Close--who looks about 18--making eyes at Mr. Moriarty.",1030924800,9,1023,4.9941176470588236
7857819,5,6303978800,"What do you think of ""Too Far To Go"" that's about a 20-year marriage splitting up because of their mutual soft-spoken stupidity and cruelty to each other (mostly from her to him?)! Just ""too far to go"" to reach across to each other. The story held my interest. I kept hoping they would recommit to their marriage. The ending was nice; had you thinking ""well maybe"", if they each grew up first.
This movie was made in 1978; it's summertime; scenery pleasant.  This is a marriage set in the late '50s or '60s). The story was full of ""come to me"" and ""go away"", so the viewer is always hoping and groaning for Richard and Joan.  You wanted to shake them yell ""wake up and be nice to each other again.""
What beautiful actors these two were. Joan Maple (Blythe Danner)is so slim and pretty, but cruel in the way she casually torments her husband, Richard (37-year old actor, pretty-boyish faced, Michael Moriarty, playing a husband in his mid-40s). (Ever wish the English language had words that meant masculine beauty?) Richard needed less compulsiveness too. Michael Moriarty was so good playing this seemingly vulnerable, basically uncomplicated, ""what's happening to my world"" man.  In the story, Richard and Joan are missing each other constantly by not tuning in to each other.
I thought it was sweet and very effective to have the flash back scenes during their marriage. Just change the actor's hair, and Richard was 20-years younger man again with that smooth face and boyish grin. In one flash back of their wedding, Joan says, ""You didn't kiss me.""  Nice story; intersting ending! As the judge said after verifying their signatures, ""Well then, good luck to you.""  AND then, Richard forgets ""too far to go"" and slowly and timidly leans toward Joan to kiss her this time.  A neat place and way to end the movie.  Truly makes you hope they might have a good chance to ""live happily ever after ...""",1027209600,12,1901,4.707831325301205
