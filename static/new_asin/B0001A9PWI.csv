8008990,5,B0001A9PWI,"I listen to this all the time. It includes great solos by Inqwie,,, Steve and Joe, with a super jam included on both the dvd and cd. Exemplary backup by Tony Mcalpine and Billy Sheehan for Mr. Vai. The cd collection is a double package with each performer , on cd 1 and the g3 jam on cd2. Inqwie does baroque and rock, red house and does tremendous work on Rockin in the Free World ( they all do). I brought this out for younger listeners and we played the dvd 4 times in one week. A great introduction to the talents of these guys to a younger generation who never get it from mainstream media. Im sure most of you know this already so enjoy some more.",1254787200,,653,4.109375
