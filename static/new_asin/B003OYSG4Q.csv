8401766,4,B003OYSG4Q,"This video is 24 minutes long (there is also a 10 min version on the dvd) The production values are high.  The folks who speak look great and make excellent points about natural childbirth, midwives, homebirth, etc.  But there is no video of a birth.  I was hoping that there would be footage of an actual natural birth, a homebirth, a midwife attended birth.  Folks are only talking about it though.",1302048000,,400,4.591549295774648
