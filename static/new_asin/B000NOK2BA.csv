8180004,5,B000NOK2BA,"The videos are extremely helpful.  I used them before, during, and know after my Kaplan class while I continue to study for my pending MCAT.  If I need clarification, it's like having the teacher right there to explain the concept.  The customer service is excellent.  I accidentally received a duplicate in the order and it was corrected promptly.  These guys are great, I'm going to owe Dr. Ferdinand a beer by the time this is done!",1313020800,,435,4.671052631578948
8180005,5,B000NOK2BA,"These DVD are extremely helpful. Although not comprehesive, he covers what you need to know for MCAT O-Chem in about 5 hours--PERFECT. O-chem is becoming less and less frequent on the MCAT and time spent studying it should reflect that. I think that this is the best of the DVD's because he focuses on the core of O-chem--electrostatics. For 5 hours these DVD's should not be passed up, expecially this one.",1222560000,5,407,4.746478873239437
8180006,5,B000NOK2BA,"I recently took the MCAT in June and I found these DVDs to be very helpful.  It was great to have these DVDs and to be able to learn at my own pace.

It had been three years since I had taken organic and the Gold Standard DVDs helped build the confidence I needed to tackle the Bio section.

Dr. Ferdinand also does a great job at explaining the nature of the exam and gives great insights on how you should go about studying for the MCAT.",1216252800,3,439,4.022988505747127
