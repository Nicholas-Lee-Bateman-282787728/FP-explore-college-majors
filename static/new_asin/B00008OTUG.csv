7986285,3,B00008OTUG,"Being a Black male, I would like to see more Black females in softcore DVD format that isn't hip hop. Something tastefully done like the Peach DVDs would be nice. The nude Black female body is beautiful. Sometimes the hardcore DVDs seem rather degrading and turn something beautiful into something less than beautiful. You know what I mean. Obligatory face spray shots, backspray shots, etc, etc.... This DVD was just nice looking Black women( Well, some of them anyway).

There doesn't seem to be many softcore DVDs featuring Black women. A lot of blonds, quite a few Asians, A few Latin DVDs, but mostly big busted blonds. Nothing wrong with big busted blonds, but give me a break everyone isn't the same.

Anyway, this video isn't that bad and actually does have some enjoyable scenes. About half of the scenes were good. The women seem rather stiff and some had on way too much make up. Trust me, if I noticed make up it was too much. They act like they were all strippers at one time. Maybe the director just sucks.

They don't appear to be fluid even while making fluid motions. The one in the pool with the implants that look like bocci balls was comical. I may have gotten one of the scenes on this video confused with EB II but this was worth it if you are looking for Black women. Crystal Knight wasn't all that. In fact, I could have done without her

About half of the women were worth a second look. If they do a EB III I hope they search for better models. Ebony Beauties II was better than this one. I kind of felt like I was being unsuccessfully teased. But, a mediocre DVD with nude Black women is better than none at all.",1105056000,6,1639,4.399339933993399
