309640,4,6301055365,"This is one of my favorite war movies, although it certainly never got the acclaim that many bigger-budget films have received.  ""The McKenzie Break"" is the story of a remote British-run POW camp for German Kriegsmariners and Luftwaffe officers in Scotland.  The Germans are of course planning an escape, led by the ruthless Captain Schlutter, (a U-Boat Captain determined to get his trained men ""back into the war"") competently played by Helmut Griem.  Brian Keith plays the British intelligence officer given a special assignment to deal with the situation at Camp McKenzie.
Of course, the notion of German POWs plotting to escape an Allied POW camp puts a unique twist on the usual POW theme, and in my opinion it works well in this film.  The storyline moves along briskly and holds the viewer's interest.  Bravo performances by Brian Keith and Helmut Griem carry the movie, and I felt that the cinematography and the on-location filming gave the film an excellent aura of authenticity.  All in all there is a great deal about this film to like.
Don't compare this one to ""The Great Escape"" or any other POW film, because it isn't like any of them.  ""The McKenzie Break"" stands on its own, and in my opinion does so very well.",1075680000,34,1230,4.773584905660377
309641,3,6301055365,"This movie tips its hat to The Great Escape but falls quite short of it in terms of watchability and being memorable.
The idea of a prison camp with rebelling German POWs was intriguing but didn't really carry itself through the movie.
The mutual respect of the two main adversaries could have been a strong dynamic to play upon but it sort of fell apart quickly 3/4 of the way through.
The tunnel and costume prep by the Germans was clearly inspired by the Great Escape but didn't carry the same level of excitement.
The ending, though ironic, was disappointing.",1013472000,4,563,4.64
309642,4,6301055365,"Although made in 1970, the era of 'The Wild Bunch' and 'Bonnie and Clyde', this is a startlingly traditional POW film as might have been made in Britain in the 1950s.  Except for a couple of minor changes.  The policier plot, like 'Night of the Generals', in which a crime-reporter turned officer tries to inflitrate the (literally) underworld activities of the enemy; the heroes the audience are generically accustomed to root for, as they try to escape prison and provoke the film out of its impasse into action, are really unpleasant, model Nazis.  The film as a whole, which takes a British genre and marginalises the British, seems like an allegory for that Empire's decline, with its two main demolishers - the Germans and the Irish - superimposed.  Rarely has downbeat been so exciting.",988329600,,793,4.895522388059701
309643,5,6301055365,"Set in a remote Scottish internment camp for captured German officers, The McKenzie Break is an interesting spin on the WW2 prisoner of war genre. Personally, I've always felt this to be one of the most under-rated WW2 films of its era, with stirling performances by Brian Keith as the shrewd, ballsy Irish Captain sent up to investigate a series of riots in the camp, and the suitably Aryan-looking Helmut Griem as the fanatical Nazi U-Boat captain fomenting the unrest as a cover for an impending escape attempt. Good solid entertainment which contrasts the arrogance and fanaticism of the German soldiers with the bewildered ineffectuality of the British camp guards (who mostly look like they should be drawing their old age pension).

We usually get only the American POW's, such as Stalag 17 so this is very refreshing to see the reverse. The Germans are planning to escape thru a tunnel from the Scottish camp and only 28 submariners will be going which makes the Luftwaffe very unhappy. The British send Brian Keith to deal with the uprisings and goes head to head with Helmut Griem. Since this is mostly a British production, it is amazing and well acted. The tense game of cat and mouse between the Irish Brian Keith and the German helmut Griem is palpable.  I recommend this drama very much and think that it is a very good use of your time.

309786,5,6301055365,You do not hear much about the Other prisons that housed the Germans. The movie about this British prison was interesting. I felt that the prisoners of this camp got away with too much. But this is a British outfit and they have always done things weird ( in my mind ) The movie is well done as you watch you keep thinking why do they let the Germans  get away with what they do. It's the only time that I thought ill of the producers of this film. But it's based on a true story so if that's the way it actually happened then so be it.

309837,4,6301055365,"The McKenzie Break presents the narrative of a prisoner of war camp in Scotland containing Germans from World War II. The Germans have a meticulous and very secret plan that only a select group of prisoners are fully aware of. The plot reveals many surprises as to what the German strategy is and also the ruthlessness that is carried out in order to protect its secrecy. The movie has a collection of unique British and German personalities, and trying to outwit each other makes for an engaging storyline.

309838,5,6301055365,great 80's war movie. a great performance by Mr. Keith.,1409443200,,55,4.6
309839,4,6301055365,"The McKenzie Break is a very good film that explores the inner workings of an allied controlled WWII POW camp. The first time I ever saw the film was late night television in the late 80s when I was taking a college history course that required original research work; wound up interviewing former German POWs that remained in the U.S. after the war.  I was intrigued by the fresh perspective the film offered.  When I saw the DVD advertised on Amazon, I bought it to see if after two decades I still thought it was a good film.  Yes, still an impressive film.  I debated whether to give it a four star rating or a five because I thought the exchange between the two main characters should have been more fully developed and the final scenes seemed overly contrived.  Don't want to give away anything that'll spoil the film for the first time viewer, but here it goes.

At the time I don't think any films existed examining allied POW camps.  I even asked the real former POWs if the film's take on things was remotely possible.  None of the individuals I interviewed saw the film, so I had to infer from their descriptions of life in the camps as to whether the film was plausible.  Also, learned that the story the film was based on actually did occur in Canada where the allies were much less vigilant or concerned about enemy warships or U-boats approaching the north American east coast.  Verdict: highly plausible.  Although for an audience familiar with WWII only through film and perhaps a high school history text, setting the film in Scotland which had been closer to the European sphere of action may have seemed more believable.

In the opening scenes, the German POWs sing 'Erika' a boisterous song which they accompany by rhythmically stamping their feet and rapping various utensils against tables and walls that recall metronome-like goose stepping nazi marches.  The tension introduced through the song and the POWs' synchronized opposition to their captors sets the tone for the rest of the movie. The interaction between the Keith/Connor character, a kind of wily warden, and the Griem/Schlutter character, a hardened nazi sociopath, keeps the viewer on edge.  There is an underlying tension in their exchanges that belies their reserved civility, somewhat reminiscent of the exchanges between the inspector and Raskolnikov in the novel 'Crime and Punishment'.  Brian Keith (much underrated actor) plays his character well although he loses his Irish brogue from time to time which is a bit distracting.  His Connor keeps Griem's Schlutter on alert and wary. Before Connor's arrival at the camp Schlutter was able to play Major Perry, the by-the-book camp commander, as he wished.  With Connor Schlutter realizes his whole paradigm has to change.

Helmut Griem has the hardest role in the movie, making a nazi sociopath interesting enough to keep watching through to the end of the film.  Griem's Schlutter fascinates the audience.  We are constantly hoping he will get his just deserts and waiting for him to show an inkling of human empathy which never happens.  In fact, Schlutter becomes more criminal as the movie progresses. All in all, a very good film.",1382572800,3,3179,4.893656716417911

309845,3,6301055365,"This is one of those war movies that could have been great. The storyline is not one we hear about much. Most of the German POW's were sent to the United States to thwart escape attempts. This revolves around a camp in Scotland that has set-up an excellent escape network and is planning on joining back up with their comrades in arms to defeat the allies.

Brian Keith does an excellent job in portraying an Irish Reporter brought in by the British government to find out what is going on at Camp McKenzie. His counterpart played by Captain Schleutter -played by Helmut Griem provides an excellent performance.

The most brutal and somewhat disturbing scene is when the Germans institute the escape. To divert the attention of the British guards, Captain Schleutter deliberately sabotages one of the barracks by removing the support holding all of the earth, thus killing over ten of his comrades and injuring scores. I Understand there are always different factions in all walks of life, but would a camp commander truly sacrifice so many of his countrymen to save a few?

This is the German side of ""The Great Escape.""

Overall, a good movie for any WWII enthusiast.",1354320000,,1169,4.800995024875622

309916,4,6301055365,"One of THE big P.O.W. movies in the U.S. was, of course, ""The Great Escape"" which was released in 1963. ""Hogan's Heroes"" started airing two years after that and Americans got a loopy idea of what life must have been like in one of those camps. ""The McKenzie Break"" was released in 1970 when Hogan was winding down and this gives a very different view of the way things were.

Here's the scoop. The British P.O.W. camp is somewhere in the wilds of Scotland. The captive Germans are giving the British a hard time while they plan an escape that will allow them to hook up with a U-Boat off the Scottish coast. The Brits send in Brian Keith who plays a quite non-conventional officer, who happens to be Irish, to snoop around to see if he can figure out what the Germans are up to. Now it's a game of smarts and wills to see if he can foil the German officer, Willi Schlueter's, scheme.

This is a cool flick. The Allies adhere to the codes of the Geneva Convention in their dealings with the Germans and it costs them. They do not have free reign over the camp, as one might imagine, and many Brits get hurt in trying to maintain order. Schlueter is foxy and does all manner of things to keep the Brits at bay in their own camp. He manages time and again to keep his plans well hidden. Brian Keith is no dummy either though. He goes toe to toe with Schlueter and it will come down to the last minute to see who wins the game.

The production values are decent enough. Most of the action takes place in the camp which couldn't have cost that much to assemble. It has a look that was typical of it's time. It's shot and edited well enough. The sound is OK. I don't remember much of the music score so it must not have been appallingly bad. The acting is decent. They kept Keith's dialogue to a minimum as he did seem to struggle a bit with his Irish brogue.

This is just a good cat and mouse kind of flick which moves along at a steady clip and has enough going on in the script to keep your attention. If you're at all prone to WW II kinds of flicks this should keep you happy.",1298851200,,2075,4.167082294264339
309917,5,6301055365,"A criminally underrated and relatively unknown POW escape classic with a twist. This time it's the Germans who are attempting to escape from a British POW camp set in a remote part of Scotland during World War 2. Helmut Griem is wholly convincing as the fanatical U boat commander, effectively controlling the camp and the escape with a murderous iron authority. In contrast a seemingly bemused yet alert Captain and Irish charmer (Brian Keith) is sent to the camp by British intelligence to restore authority and thwart his plans. The POWs game of cat and mouse with the camp authorities is enhanced by taught direction and attention to period detail throughout. The cinematography of the dark camp, lonely Scottish villages and expansive coastal scenery is memorable and adds to the escape drama. And who can forget the reverberating German marching song (Erika) sang by the prisoners at the start of the movie. Easily the most convincing, intelligent and engaging POW movie I've seen. 5 stars.",1294444800,,996,5.042424242424242

309920,4,6301055365,"Most POW movies set during World War 2 take place in German or Japanese run camps in which the prisoners are Allied troops. This one rings a deft variation by being set in a camp for German POW's in Scotland .The inmates are from all branches of the German military including a crack U-Boat unit .When a young Luftwaffe pilot (Horst Janson)is murdered the camp commander Major Perry(the ever excellent Ian Hendry) appoints a former crime reporter Captain Jack Connor (Brian Keith)to investigate the murder .He finds that the killing is linked to an elaborate and ingenious escape plan masterminded by U-Boat leader Kapitan Schlietter(Helmut Griem)a dyed in the wool Nazi who runs the camp as a microcosm of Nazi society .There is  singing of party and military songs ,miltary drill and anti-Semtic and anti-gay sentiments abound .

The movie is blessed with an intelligent and literate script from William Nolan and the direction by the under-rated Lamont Johnson is right on the money. The acting is universally fine with strong turns from Keith and Griem in particular

It is worth noting the a key point made in the movie -namely that in any  situation of confinement the guards can only run a prison with the tacit consemt or complicity of the inmates .When that is lost the potential for escape and violence is greatly increased
The movie is taut and exciting building to a nail biting climax and it should be a lot better known than it is",1195430400,4,1444,4.78714859437751
309921,3,6301055365,"THE MCKENZIE BREAK had potential in focusing on German POWs held in the United Kingdom.  The production team did a great job uniforming a multitude of extras in assorted German military uniforms thus representing prisoners of war captured from various Wehrmacht services on different fronts.  This could have been the DAS BOOT of Geramn POW movies except that it strayed from the straight formula.  Much like HART'S WAR, THE MCKENZIE BREAK begins as a realistic and straight-forward film about life in a prison camp.  The plot then makes an about-face and becomes a chase 'em and shoot 'em up movie.

The story:  Captain Jack Connor (Brian Keith) is a British officer with little future in the army.  His combative personality, heavy drinking, and general rule-breaking attitude have all but led to his being ushered out of the service.  Fortunately for Connor his superiors have decided that his rough personality is just the cure for a troublesome POW camp in Scotland.  The captive Germans, led by U-Boat Kapitan-Leutnant Schleutter, have thwarted almost every attempt to bring discipline into the compound.

In dealing with Connor, Schleutter has met his match. However, Schleutter has more on his mind than activities within the compound.  The U-Boat commander is a fanatic who assembles a mass escape for members of the Kriegsmarine.  Fearful that his plot will be betrayed by his Luftwaffe comrades, Schleutter murders a Luftwaffe officer and sabotages a Luftwaffe prison barracks to cover his escape.

Schleutter and the escapees are aided by sympathetic locals and escorted to the coast where they paddle out to meet a U-Boat.  En route the escapees, armed with Sterling submachine guns, shoot it out against an unarmed spotter aircraft.

The U-Boat men escape is based on an actual plan devised by the German high commmand to encourage mass escapes by German POWs in France, Britain, Canada, and the USA just prior to the 1944 Battle of the Bulge.  Unfortunately MCKENZIE BREAK becomes a sensational VON RYAN'S EXPRESS wanna-be.  Once the Germans are out of the camp the remainder of the screenplay relies on hopes that audiences will not ponder too many questions.  The support by the sympathetic locals is never explained.  Not only did this group provide trucks for the escape, they also armed the Germans with submachine guns.  We also find poor Captain Connor limited to chasing after the Germans in a solitary unarmed spotter plane.  Where was the RAF while all this was happening?  Apparently all the coast watchers went home on this particular day.  Eventually one Royal Navy subchaser forces the rescuing U-Boat to dive and leave Kapital-Leutnant Schleutter behind.  All in all a poor showing that late in the war.

Yes this is a good movie, but would be even better if the phony armed escape plot was removed from the film.",1193529600,5,2843,5.023504273504273

309923,4,6301055365,"Right from the start you know that THE McKENZIE BREAK will not be like any other POW movie. We see British troops guarding the camp for German POW's. And in the opening minutes the tension is firmly established with the British attempting to shackle 25 officers of the Reich in retaliation for a similar action by Germany - an effort the Germans refuse to cooperate with. It's a clever device and sets the tone perfectly for what director Lamont Johnson sought to do in not glamorizing war ""as a game.""

Variety described the movie as ""a taut, classically crafted World War II POW escape drama,"" but in fact the movie, which is based on a book by Sidney Shelley, is unlike every other POW movie I can think of in one key respect. From earlier films such as THE COLDITZ STORY through to THE GREAT ESCAPE  right up to HART'S WAR, POW drama's have centered on a likeable group of Allied prisoners attempting to escape.

Here the audience sympathies are reversed. The German prisoners are not particularly likeable, even going out of their way to kill one of their own, and in the closing minutes as the net closes around the fleeing escapees the audience hopes that the Allies will catch them in time. It has shades of the drama THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY, except in that movie the German is a likeable character and the audience sympathies do swing back and forward between him and his pursuers.

This movie is more focused on the battle of wits between Capt. Jack Connor (the always likeable Brian Keith in a role far removed from perhaps his most famous role in the original THE PARENT TRAP) and Kapitan Schleutter (Helmut Griem.)

After the camp commander (Ian Hendry) has been unable to contain the prisoners, the no-nonsense and brash Connor is brought in and becomes a race against time to prevent the mass escape of prisoners, who have a date with a U-boat off the Scottish coast.

Indeed this movie is as much about the battle between these two men as it is about the drama of escaping POW's. The climax may feature a torpedo boat and Allied plane facing off against a U-boat. But, it is the dramatic climax between Connor and Schleutter that brings the movie to a close.

So, perhaps it's not surprising that Variety also praised the movie as ""intelligent"" with ""strong three dimensiona; portrayals."" Nor should it be surprising that I find this as riveting and as exciting as any of the other POW movies that are featured in my DVD collection.

The DVD release includes a ""collectible booklet"" which is more akin to a flyer, being as it is just a page and a half of text. The full-frame trailer that accompanies the DVD is also of appalling quality with niches and scratches all over the dirty print that has washed out colors and an audio track that does not seem to fit with the visuals.

I recommend this movie for the discerning World War II movie fan.",1147132800,8,2859,4.568359375

Also what is a ""U-Boat Commander Kreigsmarine Captain""?  It's actually spelled Kriegsmarine and translates to ""Navy"" in English.  So we have (with misspellings) a ""U-Boat Commander Navy Captain"".  A bit redundant no?

309925,4,6301055365,"There's a riot going on in Scotland during the waning years of World War II.  The German prisoners in an Allied POW camp are laying siege to the compound and the War Office is getting a little frustrated and more than a little worried.  To investigate and quell the situation they decide to send the hard-living, hard-loving, rule-breaking Irish Captain Jack Connor to the scene.

  Brian Keith plays Connor in this odd POW drama that more or less turns the genre on its head.  The inmates, led by U-boat commander Kapitnleutnant Willi Schlter (Helmut Griem), are clearly in charge of the situation (darn those Geneva Convention rules!) and the Brits are a whisker away from having a Major Situation on their hands.

  Enter Jack Connor, a man not only with a plan but enough insight to perhaps do more for the war effort than bring order and discipline to an isolated prison camp.  You see, this is a POW movie, so there are tunnels being dug and breaks being plotted.  And there's a big, iron fish to land at the end of that break.  If only....

  I'm a big fan of Brian Keith and, having watched and loved the first season dvd-set of `Have Gun, Will Travel,' most episodes of which were directed by Lamont Johnson, I was pretty excited about THE MCKENZIE BREAK.  Keith is fine in this - as is Griem as his major nemesis, I hasten to add - and Johnson ably handles the action.  I wanted to love a movie that turns a genre inside-out, but I ended up only liking it.  I thought it something a little more than improbable that the Allies would be so delicate about Geneva Convention rules that they would so lose control of a prison camp.  That was the big improbability hurdle I had to overcome, although this movie is studded with them.  Add to that a rather ambiguous and inconclusive ending and I can't help feeling disappointed.  Considering the talent involved, this one should have soared.  As it is, THE MCKENZIE BREAK is a solid, albeit unspectacular, movie.",1120089600,6,1966,4.573065902578796
