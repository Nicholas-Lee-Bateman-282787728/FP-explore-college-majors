8104811,5,B000E372JK,A well done example of just how brilliant Howard Hughes was!  This helps tell the story of his struggles and accomplishments.,1459036800,,125,4.9523809523809526
8104812,5,B000E372JK,"This is a documentary film that highlights the technical advances made over the lifetime of Howard Hughes and Hughes Aircraft. From the breaking of the world airplane speed record, to an around the world record-breaking flight, Howard Hughes demonstrates his determination for success and love for aviation. As WWII came to a close, the large plywood, eight-engine Spruce Goose came under Congressional criticism, and Hughes defends his actions vigorously standing on his loyalty to country.

Hughes purchased what would become known as TWA (Trans World Airlines), and built it into a leading world-class airline. He ordered and took delivery of each of the many Lockheed Constellations used for international flight.

The Air Force C-130 would employ many of the technical devises of the Spruce Goose, including hydraulic controls and landing gear. And Hughes would develop the Hughes-269 helicopter, a forerunner of its known ability to withstand a crash.

Finally, the greatest feat: Howard Hughes built a large mining ship, made to lift a sunken Russian submarine from a depth of 17,000 feet. The ship was successful and within sight of a Russian trawler that observed and thought the ship was prospecting for minerals.

This is an excellent documentary for demonstrating the value of invention, determination and persistence.",1362355200,2,1330,5.4106280193236715
8104813,5,B000E372JK,"Howard Hughes and his technical inventions are undramatically viewed in this one hour Modern Marvels film; from the near fatal air crash, to the flying boat, to the raising of the Russian submarine from an ocean bottom of 17,000 feet.

Personally I never knew the building of the ""Spruce Goose"" (as it was popularly called) originated against the backdrop of shortages of metal war materials. Completed after the war, the government had little use for it and that sparked the senate hearings against Hughes. (Which by the way he not only survived but emerged victoriously.)",1319760000,2,573,5.031578947368421
8104814,2,B000E372JK,"The list price of this is $24.95, but copies are available for $2. There's a reason for that $2 price, but I'd say that is too much to pay.

Among their gaffes are calling Hughes ""the inventor of the seaplane"". Huh? Of course, I'm of an age where I remember when A&E stood for Arts & Entertainment, before the channel became devoted to ""reality"" TV, and this is a perfect example of A&E's penchant for poorly researched so-called facts.",1246406400,3,784,6.072072072072072
8104815,5,B000E372JK,"""Howard Hughes Tech"" tells the story of how Howard Hughes went from a pilot and funder of faster propeller planes, to TWA owner, builder of the Spruce Goose (8 engines, designed to carry 750 troops and using hydraulic assisted surface controls), to early builder of Falcon, Phoenix, and Maverick missile systems, leader in satellites (weather, DirectTV, and spy systems), and constructor of military helicopters, the first lunar landing module, and the Glomar Explorer created to retrieve a Soviet submarine in 17,000+ feet of water. Unfortunately, injuries incurred in the crash of his XF-11 led to his overuse of pain medications and acerbated his OCD behaviors. By 1968 he employed 80,000 workers, and was the richest man in America; Hughes died in 1976.",1240531200,5,757,5.213114754098361
