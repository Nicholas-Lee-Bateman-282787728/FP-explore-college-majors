8369086,1,B002FKZ544,"I was excited when I saw this blu ray and bought it for my daughter. The interface looks like it was made on a home computer and the images shot with a consumer camcorder. In addition, the dogs crap on the white ""set"" then track it around. Not worth the money even with amazon prime.",1334188800,,283,4.163636363636364
8369087,2,B002FKZ544,"Bought this disk because it was marketed as ""digital antidepressant"" and I thought it would make the long winters shorter.

But the MUSIC on the soundtrack is so UN-listenable. Wretched. Like being stuck in a Chucky-Cheese. Horrible.

And don't get me wrong: I LOVE AMBIENT VIDEO. I love ""video wallpaper"", and I've collected a fair amount of it. But this disk... The puppies aren't that interesting. The kittens aren't that interesting. The music is like having nails driven into your ears. The video set-up looks like a cheap attempt to make money. Purchase only with caution.",1313193600,,578,5.010416666666667
8369088,2,B002FKZ544,"The premise is great.  I'm a sucker for Kittens, I'll admit... this ""movie"" disappointed though.

The video quality, despite claiming a to be produced in 4K, is clearly something below 720p - on a 1080p TV with an Oppo BDP-83 and a PS3, it has clearly visible aliasing on everything (greater than 1 pixel wide, meaning far lower than 1080p).  I have no idea how they can claim 4K production - somewhere along, if it was indeed produced in 4K, someone screwed up.  Anyone thinking this will be any sort of showcase for video should look elsewhere - It's quite possibly one of the worst Blu-rays out there.

Now on to the content - I found it to be a little lackluster because there seems to be no actual audio of the animals, just mediocre music (which may entertain a 3 year old, but it did nothing for my enjoyment).  I was expecting to hear some meows and barks.

While it still fills a place in my collection, it's not quite what was advertised and not quite what I was hoping for.",1259107200,10,984,4.373626373626373
8369089,5,B002FKZ544,"I tried this video just as a cute ambient wallpaper for a flatscreen mounted in a kids room, but my 3 month old son loved it!  He has only just started smiling, but watching this video he was actually giggling for the first time!  Its great.  The baby animals really are engaging, and the very minimal camera work makes it perfect for an ambient video. The resolution is very very high and it looks so sharp, that at times people have to touch the screen just to be sure its not a window.",1252540800,3,488,4.225806451612903
8369090,5,B002FKZ544,"Sometimes when I see a cute puppy or kitten, I wish I could just stare at them doing puppyish and kittyish things forever.  But then the owners take them away!

Finally, I can stare at cute puppies and kittens for at least 3 hours.  In full 1080p resolution on Blu-ray, the greatest mass market optical media format God has ever given man.",1249516800,5,339,4.435483870967742
