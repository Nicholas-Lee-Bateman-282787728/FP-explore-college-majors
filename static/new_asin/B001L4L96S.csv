8317194,5,B001L4L96S,"Great stars, plus the chance to see Buzz' Aldrin. A  very good introduction to space movies. Brilliant. All the action was superb.",1393027200,,130,4.909090909090909
8317195,3,B001L4L96S,"I have mixed feelings about this dvd.  The dvd is full color all the way through and has some great original nasa footage but it has been badly edited and some poor choices in audio given.
Most of the audio is taken from various original sources for example the capcom loop, the flight directors loop etc. and this is great, but during the landing, rather than you hearing the capcoms loop they switch to the post mission debriefing and the debriefing doesn't match up with the video.  If you are an avid Apollo follower this doesn't really detract as is a fresh perspective on things, but if you aren't then this can be quite confusing.
The video also has some bad editing for example on the ascent phase from the moon you see the lunar module as seen from the command module, then you cut to an inside shot showing Neil and Buzz then back to the outside shot from the command module.  The problem is the inside shot of Neil and Buzz isn't in sync as this shot was taken in the command module but the way the video is presented it tries to fool you into thinking its a shot of them inside the lunar module.
There is a very good extended launch sequence though and you get to see a lot more than most other videos give you.
This is really one for Apollo or NASA fans however. Although the footage is good, the bad editing choices let it down.",1352332800,2,1342,4.296442687747035
8317196,2,B001L4L96S,"I was disappointed in this DVD. I read reviews that said it was a well put together DVD of the events of Apollo 11, especially for those who were not born then. Well I remember the landing very well. The DVD did show some good things about the mission. It showed only parts of the launch, Parts of the landing, and could have shown more of lift off from the moon.
The DVD ""In the shadow of the moon"" shows more and better footage of Apollo 11.
I would not recommend this DVD if your buying it to remember the history of this mission.",1294099200,7,533,4.134615384615385
8317197,4,B001L4L96S,"Looking for more details of the flight and landing, I didn't find what I was looking for. Mayby too many books and DVD's already? It is still a tremendous achievement, unlike anything in human history. I admire all the people and knowledge that made this happen. Incredible courage from all parties.",1293840000,3,299,4.882352941176471

8317199,5,B001L4L96S,A great historical DVD on the original Apollo 11 moon landing!  Especially nice for kids who were not born at the time.,1231286400,7,119,4.409090909090909
