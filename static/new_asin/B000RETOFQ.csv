2864802,4,B000RETOFQ,"Great job by Troy Reed at Street Starz again (Check out all of his documentaries, they are great). Documentary is very well put together, getting deeper into the life of Alpo, one of the 3 people documented in the original ""Game Over"" DVD. Only complaint I have is this DVD was delayed so many times that several street magazines have documented Alpo's life in the interim (including a 1+ hour interview from F.E.D.S magazine on CD) and make the content in this documentary somewhat repetitive.  While this DVD does give some new insight into Alpo's life from friends and people he grew up around, the story remains the same (can't say that I learned too much from this DVD). Definitely worth checking out though.",1189036800,5,713,4.75

8200123,4,B000RETOFQ,"This DVD put out by Troy Reeds Street Stars is Game Over Part 2. It glamorizes, profiles and romanticizes the life of Alberto ""Alpo"" Martinez, the infamous Harlem street legend who rose to a ghetto superstar and icon in hip-hop as a teenage with his boy, Rich Porter, who he eventually murdered in a drug dispute. With friends like Alpo who needs enemies? Alpo's story has been covered in Don Diva's Hell Up in Harlem article and in F.E.D.S. magazine. His story has also been featured on gorillaconvict.com and in Street Legends Vol 1 and 2, where his association with Washington DC's Wayne Perry and Michael Fray is examined. Whatever the case or situation with Alpo, as he has been branded and ridiculed as a snitch, he is a polarizing figure and street legend none the less, whose mythical status has been cemented and glorified in hip-hop's lyrical lore and the chronicles of gangsta and street lore also. He was a trendsetter and the way he dressed and carrying himself, the cars he drove, the way he acted and everything about him has translated to hip-hop, no matter what the detractors say about him. Yes he is a snitch but so is Henry Hill of Goodfellas fame and that has not hurt his cause: celebrity.",1335398400,4,1211,4.637209302325582
