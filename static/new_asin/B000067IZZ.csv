7963156,1,B000067IZZ,"So as a convicted rapist and former employee of Enron I figured this to be the cat's meow when it came to electrical prison tape nude bondage video excitement from Japan. Boy was I wrong. This isn't even made in Japan. And none of the Japanese girls even look Asian. If anything they look white which is not the Enron I remember. Maybe in the upstairs the women were like this, but down in the boiler room and in the closet by the emergency exit, the one with the pine sol smell and foreign snack depository, the girls were always Japanese. I'd ask for my money back if this video weren't a hand me down.",1234396800,,604,4.260869565217392
7963157,4,B000067IZZ,"I definitely liked this DVD. Sure, its not hardcore porn (if you're into that), but if you have half a brain you know that's not what a Playboy DVD is going to be about.

The appeal of this one is that you get to see normal, girl-next-door types (i.e. not porn stars) get a bit nervous and excited about the idea of doing a Playboy pictorial, and then the video walks you through what they go through, including of course the photo shoot.

It's sort of 'documentary-ish', but in a good/interesting way.

While not all of the women are true Playboy-quality (and they spend WAY too much camera time on one woman in particular, who not only is unpleasant and whiney, but has the least-impressive bod of the bunch), the ones who ARE (maybe half) are definitely worthy and then some.

Specifically, I wouldn't mind being Janine Howard's love slave... she's the sexiest pilot ever. Amazingly, she was in her late 30s for the shoot, yet blows away most any any 20-year old. I'd like to know what she does to look like that.

The nude shoot done next to the Enron tower is also cool, as is the woman in it (Shari Daugherty), who's a nudist/free spirit at home. Surprisingly, she comes across as being very real, presenting herself as she is.... she's not doing some sexy put-on for the camera. That's rare, and a BIG contrast that with your average oh-so-fake actress or porn star. And of course, that attitude makes her even hotter.

Maya Arthur is another uber-hottie on the vid, as is Vanessa Schultz (Schulte?).

The one really AWFUL thing about the video? The narrator- he does a LOT of Playboy videos, and there's just no standing his voice and delivery. He sounds like he should be the voice-over guy for a really cheesy TV game show or something... tries waaaay too hard to be cool.

After ten minutes of listening to him, you'll wish you could taser him. Baseball bat is also an option.

Even so, the overall concept and the five or so truly hot women in the cast make this worth watching, if you can pick it up for pretty cheap. There's just something about 'real' women, as opposed to your typical android model or porn star.",1102723200,9,2128,4.520833333333333
7963158,2,B000067IZZ,"This dvd definately sucks, i should have learned my lesson after i got the women of starbucks, but  i actually leanred more in this one... no just kidding. This one had a crappy start, just goto the scene selection and skip to the end thats where they show all of the really ""good"" stuff if you know what i mean. Same with the starbucks one.
Also this is playboy, playboy is more like ""art"" i guess more than pr0n so if you are looking for the good stuff please learn some common sense.",1070064000,3,486,4.225806451612903
7963159,3,B000067IZZ,"Face it, we all have different expectations when it comes to media material of this type. I didn't read the fist review until after I had been notified that it had been shipped. While we would have liked to have seen more of the girls (who wouldn't).
 I found it to be a very good supplement to the issue of the magazine. What you will not find in the magazine issue is, How that woman walks,talks,and laughs. With this you will. These are not models or actresses in this case, so it isn't scripted fantasy stuff complete with awful background music. It is more of a documentry style of DVD. Bottom line...If you liked the girls in the magazine shoot, you will like this too. I wouldn't pay [price] for it(nor for anything like this)...",1041033600,13,736,4.451851851851852
