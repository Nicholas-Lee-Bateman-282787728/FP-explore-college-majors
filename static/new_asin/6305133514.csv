Not for nothing, if there were guys like him around in the school system today, I'm sure we wouldn't be seeing the school stories in the news today.  Once in a blue moon in reality an individual like this pops up and makes a difference in a society, in a classroom, in the minds of those children who would like to learn, in the system and in the world.  This movie spelled it out.  The sad part is the movie also showed what is actually happening in society, in the system, in the classrooms, but ends on a much better note for those kids who do go to school to learn.",1490227200,2,626,4.235294117647059

 Morgan Freeman did a great job as a portrayal of principal Clark. It made you want the best outcome for his character and all of the students. He was passionate and strong!",1480118400,,449,4.1022727272727275

Now I've purchased a copy here at amazon and very proud to have done so. For Morgan Freeman fans alike, this is one of his many great performances to enjoy. The greatest one man show you'll see. And also directed by one of the finest directors ever: JOHN G. AVILDSEN! The same director who brought us ROCKY, THE KARATE KID, THE POWER OF ONE and so much more. The moving true story of one tough principal who turned a failing high school around. He was targeted by some, but won over nonetheless. This film is non stop energy right from start to finish. Too bad Morgan, John, and this picture didn't walk away with Oscars. But this film remains total Oscar winning in my heart. And hopefully it will in yours too.",1478995200,4,860,4.415094339622642

979277,4,6305133514,"I remember watching this many years ago a couple times and loving it's edginess. It's got that 1980's style all through, and ""reverent-amidst-chaos"" overtone, kinda preachy attitude that collided with the counterculture of the time. Based on true accounts, It starts with the all white classic public school in 1960's semi-urban New Jersey, and then rapidly shifts 20 years ahead, post white-flight from the neighborhood as a lower income urban demographic, comprised of drug dealing/ using kids, alert---PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT---- (what would Reagan say..."" Hey Kids, Just say NO!),  negative role models, burned out teachers with low morale in a trashed school setting. Ebbing and flowing through is the wonderful Morgan Freeman, first as an Afrocentric appearing, but charismatic teacher of white kids in the segregated '60's, becoming a total 180 degree opposite, a hard core leader in a suit for unruly, violent, impoverished, mostly minority urban high school kids. He realizes he has to develop a softer more humanistic side in order to make positive change lasting and effective, and to prove to the naysayers & powers that be that money and conventional, formulaic fixes aren't everything.(HINT: a clue lesson that MANY in gov. & educational leadership could learn from even TODAY!)",1465084800,4,1296,5.384236453201971

So, he was just channeling Joe Clark. Every time this John Avildsen film threatened to become ""Feelgood 101"" it took another turn into realism. A parent-teacher meeting turned into a Gospel Revival? Amazing, but a bit schmaltzy. Visiting the home of a single Mom who has stared at the mirror of her past mistakes, at a young age? Gritty. Really. Great stuff, enhanced by a fantastic performance by Morgan Freeman,",1458345600,,618,4.885714285714286

979692,1,6305133514,"The lead character in Lean on Me is Joe Clark, portrayed by Morgan Freeman, who is a high school teacher at Eastside High school in New Jersey. In 1967, Clark is portrayed as an ambitious, but angry, teacher who is transferred from the named school because he refuses to agree to new terms accepted by the other teachers. Fast forward twenty years later and the school is depicted as a cesspool of violent and degenerate behavior, where there is drug-dealing and drug-taking; where students display extreme aggression towards not only each other but the teachers also. In short, the students control the school. The mayor agrees to hire Clark in the hopes that he will be able to improve the students test scores; a requirement for keeping the funding needed to keep the school open, or out from under state control. Clark arrives at the school and is dumbfounded by the graffiti-lined walls, and trash littering the halls. He meets with the vice-principals and other teachers and is angered by their apparent apathy.

The biggest issue I have with this movie is the way he treats his teachers/staff. He shows a tremendous amount of compassion for his students (although teachers really should never insult, embarrass, or belittle students in front of other students); however, he treats his teachers/staff with no regard whatsoever. He is a one-man-show and a horrible example of what a true leader should be.

It isn't until halfway through the movie that he deigns to compliment a teacher. He confronts a group of boys in the bathroom and commands they perform the school song upon threat of suspension, which they do. He is so shocked by what he hears that he demands to know by whom it was taught. When they tell him, he confronts the new choral teacher, Mrs. Powers. After what seems to be a dressing down for changing the school song, he storms toward the exit and turns to exclaim, Take a bow, Mrs. Powers, youve re-written our alma mater. I thought this would be a turning point in which Clark would begin to honor his teachers; those whose work should be honored, but no. When Clark gets the practice test scores back he forgets the good mood he was in after hearing the new school song; and immediately lashes out at the teachers again. He holds a meeting with the teachers in which he has a quarter of them raise their arms above their heads while he berates them. He then exclaims regarding the failed test scores: that is not their failure. I don't blame them. The failure is yours.  Thats right, yours . . . . Now you are getting a hint at the kind of hopelessness and shame that makes those failing students throw up their hands at the thought of facing the world for which you have not prepared them.

Perhaps those teachers at Eastside were apathetic; perhaps they had given up hope, but haranguing them into feeling guilty and useless was not the way in which to get them to respond favorably. I know that the movie shows a sudden and drastic change in the teachers performance and a difference in the students soon after; but I can tell you from experience that teachers abhor being forced to teach to the test; they abhor being told their work is inadequate when it is just as much the fault of the student and parents. Teachers are tired of having their jobs threatened if their students do not succeed. I know, I'm a teacher. Several years back, the fear coursing through some teachers was so massive that it resulted in cheating on state tests in order to prevent a cut in pay or a job loss. In Atlanta, there was a teacher whose methods were similar to Clarks. The results were not, as reported in the Atlanta Journal: ""Beverly Hall came to Atlanta Public Schools in 1999 with the reputation as an urban school reformer bringing tough school standards and voicing a mantra of no excuses for failure. Twelve years later, a special state investigators report found organized and systematic cheating in Atlanta to boost test scores, and it named 178 educators, including 38 principals, who were said to have taken part. Some of those who later pleaded guilty to charges linked to the cheating testified about pressure from above to show improvements to test results by any means necessary"".

With this real-world example, how then can we say that Clarks example provides a good example for anyone? In reality, fear and bullying teachers into submission would more likely result in a negative outcome. Not only did Clark bully his teachers into doing what he wanted, but he also elicited them into breaking the law. No, the fire chiefs plan to catch them with the chains on the doors in order to remove Clark from office wasn't a nice thing to do; no, it wasn't great that the school had no funding for alarmed doors; but for Clark to have his teachers involved in illegal activity just to prevent being caught sends a poor message to the students for whom hes supposed to be educating. Hes basically saying, Its okay to break the law, as long as you don't get caught.

Moments later, he moves to the stage in the auditorium. It is the day of the test and he is preparing to motivate his students. I was stunned at what came out of his mouth. He tells them, I want to tell you about what the people out there are saying about you and what they think about your chances. They say you are inferior. You are just a bunch of n*** and sp****, and poor white trash. Education is wasted on you. You cannot learn. He then has the white students stand and says, theyve got no place to go. If they had, theyd have abandoned us long ago, like everyone else did, but they couldnt. I cant think of a better way in which to incite negativity towards community than with that speech. He goes on to incite hatred for whites and their community by shouting that they can make everyone outside the school liars by succeeding on their tests.
Shouting at students that you can do it and belittling society as a whole is not true education. Students must be instructed daily on what they need to know to succeed, both in school and in life. In the end, Clark is arrested and the school is in an uproar. One student shouting, Do we still gotta go to class? Who gonna look after the school? These students didn't learn a thing but how to rely heavily on someone other than themselves.

I found absolutely nothing redeeming in this movie, rather found it an example of how not to lead. In the end, the students don't even listen to Clark, continually shouting No! when he tells them to disperse. Even when he receives the final test scores, he is disrespectful to authority in front of his students, telling the mayor, . . . you can tell the state to go to hell. Yes, a tough approach may be necessary in extreme cases in which students have no respect for authority, but not at the expense of those in authority and at the expense of community.",1452643200,3,6842,4.5713121434392825

Wonderful performances especially from actors:  Beverly Tood (Ms. Levias), Michael Beach  (Mr. Darnell), Regina Taylor (Mrs. Carter), and Jermaine Hopkins (as student Thomas Sams). And just to show you how being one in a crowd in a film may lead to bigger acting roles in time, check out actor, Michael Imperioli with the shoulder length hair --one of the hoodlums-- in the auditorium scene. (""Goodfellas"", and ""The Sopranos""). He's come a long way !",1446595200,,880,4.801324503311259

980556,5,6305133514,"Lean on me is based on a principal at a high school that needs to bring up their test scores from 33% passing to 75% passing in one school year.
The movie starts off showing the school being completely out of control and the students running the school.  Mr. Clark (Morgan Freeman), is appointed the new principal, and starts to take charge.  On his first day he kicks out all the students who are simply causing trouble.  This starts a war with one parent in particular that causes problems down the line. Mr. Clark is able to get the students to trust him by believing in them and teaching them not only the values of historical and science facts, but the facts of life if they don't finish school and life on the street.  He takes a personal interest in his students success, but doesnt allow for any mischief. This keeps him in charge while protecting the students.
However, Mr. Clark is not as good at handling the other teachers and his support system.  He is constantly harping on them for not doing their job or not listening to his methods.  He doesnt allow the teachers to speak up and voice his or her own opinion.  As great as he is to the students, he was a bully to the teachers.
This is a very inspiring movie with good acting. It is based on a true story about a school that is out of control to gaining the respect and trust of the students and showing them their true potential.  As a teacher this would be one of the hardest schools to work in and learning how to properly discipline the students and keep both the students and staff safe.

Refreshing to see a role-model in this industry that doesn't lose sight of what's important despite the pressures from the government, faculty, and even the parents. A good leader with enough slack to do his job can be a powerful thing. I wonder if Mr. Carter would have been allowed to effectively do his job in modern times, or if the media backlash would have confined his good deeds to the reach of political correctness. Morgan Freeman's best performance yet.",1418860800,,505,4.952941176470588
981054,5,6305133514,"Lean On Me is a film loosely based on the story of Joe Louis Clark,an educator known for his unorthodox means,who was assigned to become high school principal of Eastside High School. He was given the impossible task of reforming the school as it is at the risk of being overtaken by the state government. It stars Morgan Freeman,who portrays Clark,in his ascent to stardom. John G.Avildsen,who is known for underdog films in movies such as The Karate Kid and Rocky,is the director of the movie.

Back in 1987,Joe Louis Clark was assigned to become the principal of Eastside High School,the worst known school in the state that is located at Paterson,New Jersey. The students have done poorly at the state test of minimum basic skills since their average scores hovers around 33% - way below the 75% minimum passing rate. The students have been known to be using drugs and involved with gang violence. When he arrives at the school,the radical Clark reprimands the entire faculty for their inability to control the students and their failure to do their job. Then,he dismisses hundreds of students that are identified as drug dealers and abusers as well as troublemakers. Despite his tyrannical approach and hard-line policies that he implemented that caused a lot of tension and alienation from his fellow faculty members and parents of the students,Clark was able to achieve results as he was able to straighten out Eastside High School later in time and he was able get the school's basic-skills test scores up. This led him to have the the job at the institution permanently. Although his tyrannical approach and hard-line policies alienate many members of the staff and the community, his uncompromising campaign gets results. This make him popular to the dismay of his critics and powerful enemies.

Morgan Freeman provided a great portrayal as Joe Louis Clark that the viewer of the movie would somehow overcome the film's flaws such as predictability and having a formulaic screenplay. Aside from that,it was also cheesy. Although the viewer knows that that Clark will be able to achieve the impossible task of reforming Eastside despite his unorthodox methods and the tensions that were created by the people - students and faculty members - in the school,one will definitely enjoy and get entertained by his interesting peroformance. I could have given this film a rating of 8 BUT Freeman was simply excellent and remarkable that the viewer will definitely care more about his character as well as the actions he has taken instead of the flaws of the film as a whole.",1418601600,,2577,4.962962962962963

981388,5,6305133514,"The power that flows through Morgan Freeman when he speaks, when he acts, is clearly, positively influential.

I feel that this film could really be beneficial to those in leadership positions as well as those who need to be lead.

(Principles, Students,  Coaches, Coachee, Supervisor, Employee Etc.)

When you are called to do something, you're not asked to be polite about it, but to get the job done.

A lot of what happens in today's society is, everyone wants to seem cool. They don't want to be hated, but truth is, when you're doing things right and making a Difference, you may not always be liked.

Think of Dr. Martin Luther King. He had a dream, of a society different, than what he knew would someday be a part of history.
Some of his own kind was appalled by it (thinking he could never make the difference or the change and then there were the others.

Making a difference is about fulfilling a mission, it's not about making peace with all, sometimes peace comes after the purpose is fulfilled.

Lean on me, is about a man making a difference to the world. And about understanding the laws of love, leaning on those who are placed in his path to help the dream succeed.

In fact, the kids who graduated under his years as principal enjoyed a much higher rate of good jobs/careers after college.  I like the movie because the hero has flaws, and he knows when he must improve as well.  Warning:  There is bad language and racial language...

A girl says, ""English Common Law!"" and puts the girls ahead with her ""correct"" answer. But the answer is incorrect. Why?

Our charter, The Declaration of Independence, states that all men are created equal, and are endowed BY THEIR CREATOR with certain unalienable rights, and that among those rights are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. So, rights don't come from man's law, and they don't come from the Magna Carta, or even from the Constitution. Rights come from God. So, when you are challenged, don't say, ""My Constitutional rights,"" but say, ""My God-given, Constitutionally-protected rights!""

982197,3,6305133514,"Morgan Freeman does an excellent job depicting Joe Clark, former principal of inner-city Eastside High in Paterson, N.J. Clark previously had been an Army drill instructor, elementary school teacher and then principal in one of the city's worst neighborhoods. Ninety percent of that school's 1,000 students, mostly poor blacks and Latinos, read below grade level when Clark took over; by 1982 the school was so much better that Clark was hailed s a miracle man and sent to Eastside High. Freeman shows Clark as primarily an autocratic  disciplinarian who encouraged school pride and good behavior. There he stayed for seven years.

In 1979 the county prosecutor's office labeled Eastside 'a  caldron of terror and violence.' Drug deals were made in the open, and principals and teachers routine assaulted. One hundred fifty teachers out of two hundred departed during his first five years. Clark admits he encourages them to leave by routinely bawling them out in front of their classes.

Unfortunately, other sources report that education scores did not substantially improve, resulting in Eastside High being taken over by the state one year after Clark's departure in 1991. Others criticized Clark's expelling large numbers of delinquent students to improve test scores as 'simply moving the problems from the school onto the street.' And the film exaggerated his students' test scores, as well as the graffiti on the walls prior to his arrival.

Another distortion - the film depicted Clark as keeping fire inspectors out as a by-product of his chaining doors to keep out drug dealers. Reality - it was a state monitoring team that Clark kept out. Further, the reason the school board threatened to fire him - ' unbecoming conduct' and 'insubordination.' The board retreated after praise poured in from Education Secretary William Bennett after an adulatory Time magazine cover story and a six-figure contract for the movie rights.

Clark forced out about 600 students/year, proportionately quite higher than other Paterson schools. And the teachers did not sit quietly by as Clark verbally attacked and even fired a number of them - they filed more grievances against Mr. Lark than any other principal in Paterson. A local paper reported that fewer Eastside students went on to college or trade school since his arrival - from 53.6% in 1982 to 42.3% in 1987.",1382659200,9,2363,5.1566579634464755

It is a movie you must watch more than once.",1380672000,,284,4.68
982272,4,6305133514,"1988's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stand-And-Deliver/dp/B001H8PE2S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stand And Deliver</a>&nbsp;and 1989's Lean On Me were two feel-good movies concerning our besieged educational system that left an indelible impression on me back in the day. They're stories made even more riveting by virtue of that they're based on real events and actual people. Stand and Deliver triumphantly stands the test of time; it's one of my favorite movies ever. But Lean On Me...

...tells the story of ""Crazy Joe"" Clark. In 1987, Eastside High of Paterson, New Jersey is as low down as it could get. The state report ranks Eastside High last in the state. Drugs and firearms and scholastic ennui run rampant in Eastside. The teachers have lost all control. A bill has just passed mandating that 75% of the students must pass the minimum basic skills test or, else, the state takes control by the end of the school year. Sad thing is, the year prior, only 38% of the students passed the minimum basic skills test. The mayor (Alan North) of Paterson is fuming mightily, not because he cares all that much about book learnin' but mostly because he's up for re-election. He needs someone to step into inner-city Eastside High and take charge. He needs someone with nothing to lose.

Dedicated but combative teacher Joe Clark has burned bridges everywhere he's went. Today he's exiled as an elementary school principal. When a former colleague (a very good Robert Guillaume) approaches Joe with an offer to preside over Eastside, well, it means that, among other things, director John G. Avildsen's found himself another underdog vehicle to champion.

To me - or rather, to an earlier me - Joe Clark and Stand and Deliver's Jaime Escalante seemed like two educators cut from the same cloth. It wasn't 'til repeated viewings did it dawn on me that while Escalante was fierce and demanding, Joe Clark was straight-up angry and resentful. Escalante exhibited unexpected warmth. Since we're not mincing words, Joe Clark proved to be a dictatorial tool. The subversive truth is that this incarnation of Joe Clark is a bully, a martinet disdainful of his staff's feelings and opinions. You root for him early on as he arrives at Eastside - as he steps into that ""cauldron of violence"" - and as he promptly lays down the law. His first administrative act as new principal is to expel 300 of the school's worst student offenders. He informs his teachers that ""This is not a damn democracy. We are in a state of emergency, and my word is law."" To quote one admiring student: ""Mr. Clark don't play!"" Right on, ""Crazy Joe.""

As the film goes on, we wait for him to thaw out, to become a more sympathetic character. But he doesn't get there, not really. If you've gotten used to Morgan Freeman as this amiable elderly statesman, only put this movie on to realize how fiercely this guy can chew scenery. Freeman is sensational and is at his most showy, stomping around and having hissy fits and deploying the most malevolent death stare since the Sonny Liston era.

Whether he's chaining up all entry points to Eastside (to prevent the bad elements from sneaking in) or intimidating his students into learning the school song (and we get an unexpected, fantastic singing scene out of that) or whether slugging an armed juvie, ""Crazy Joe"" Clark intends to turn Eastside High around even if it means terrorizing and alienating everyone around him. So we laud him for his unorthodox disciplinary efforts even as we condemn him for being too harsh a taskmaster and for his unwillingness to bend, for his unshakeable belief that he's infallible. How can you teach when you yourself are unteachable? Lean on Me has relevance and I recommend it for Morgan Freeman's ferocious performance and for the film's sometimes harrowing peek into inner-city truths and for the occasional comic flourish. If you can distill the movie down to one scene, it's that one where Joe Clark is on the roof and dropping real talk on Sams, a young hooligan pleading for a second chance. When it takes someone as abrasive and intractable as Joe Clark to turn things around - Joe Clark who, when being coaxed by Guillaume to take on Eastside, bitterly remarks: ""I don't have to do nothing but stay black and die."" - then you know we're in trouble.",1380499200,2,4353,4.941256830601093

All the while, inner city youth are being passed on from grade to grade without ever learning.  Public school teachers today are forbidden to give a student anything less than a C.

I came to a small country town in South Florida.  But I had great teachers who saw a little light in me and helped me along the way.  If I was poor I would not have known it.  For the school and the staff met and exceeded my needs.  And now I hope to do as much as I can when I become principal.  And I want to be just like the great role model in Principal Clark.

983001,5,6305133514,"I love movies based on true stories. This one is very inspirational, and also includes two of my favorite actors: Morgan Freeman and Robert Guillaume. Freeman plays Joe Clark, the principal of Eastside High in Paterson, New Jersey, which he converted from a ghetto war zone into a serious school where the kids really learned, and learned to love him in the process. Guillaume plays Superintendent of Schools Frank Napier, who wants to believe in Joe Clark, but has a lot of trouble with the mayor and other politicians, including one member of the school board who strikes me as some sort of communist agitator. At the very least, she uses some very underhanded tactics and makes a deal with the mayor to deliver a large body of votes to him in exchange for his assistance in getting rid of Joe Clark.

I'm not sure if this story provides a plan for turning around blighted urban schools, but one element was deftly avoided. Principal Clark chained and padlocked the side doors after discovering that a drug dealer was using them to gain access to the school. The kids accepted it because they felt he was protecting them. But the bitch on the school board used that as an excuse to have the fire marshall arrest Clark. Early on it was mentioned that they should have locking doors with panic bars that set off alarms, but the school board and/or the state was unwilling to pay for them. I think more should have been made of that, except that they never did get their retrofitted doors (at least in the course of the movie), so I guess they could not be emphasized.

983003,4,6305133514,"Lean on Me is a film which may or may not be based on a true story or true events, yet it doesn't necessarily matter. It is an honest look into the life of what a struggling inner city school was like during the 1980s, before many modern interventions and precautions were ever put into place. The main problem here being, this honesty is taken to some exaggerated levels, and the audience is constantly being reminded of how ticked off and stressed everyone at this East Side High School is, and how far and heavy Morgan Freeman's ""Mr. Clarke"" character as the new principal (who is hired to finally set things straight) has to go to get his high school students back on track, as well as his school's reputation in general. Sprinkled with some typical cliches and almost constantly rammed down the audience's throats, what could initially be seen as an overall annoying and preachy movie, when spinkled with some salt beforehand, does make for some compelling, even at times giggle-inducing drama.

Joe Clarke, played by Morgan Freeman in perhaps his loudest role, is a man who was a former teacher at East Side High School, where back in the 1960s used to be a calmer, much quieter and sweeter school harbored mostly by middle class white students. Informed of some budget cuts, Mr. Clarke becomes upset and abruptly leaves. In this opening sequence we quickly see in a setting ""morph"" scene how East Side High goes from a sweet and calm white school to a run down, graffiti-walled and circle of hell school now attended by mostly black students, where drug dealing runs rampant, and violence and constantly ensuing (this is of course due to the budget cuts Mr. Clarke disagreed with in the first place). How the teachers deal with such matters is beyond me, and this is where the exaggeration begins. No way in hell would any teacher in this country ever put up with teaching at such a school... but things might have been different back then.

Anyway, the board decides to seek hour Mr. Clarke (who is now working at a more affluent suburban white elementary school) to take the role as principle to see if he can fix all the mess the board has caused. Thus he begins his mission, using ANY means necessary, to save the school and remake it into a NEW East Side High, where children can be respectful, hardworking people. He does this by kicking expelling much of the bad seeds and using an iron fist (to both students AND teachers alike), through plenty of yelling scenes in a take-no-prisoners, no holds barred, take-no-crap, zero tolerance attitude, but still with enough sensitivity to not become a complete monster... at least not in the perception of everyone, as many of the teachers take a big disliking to him; the biggest disliking being the school board who is now deciding to try and somehow kick Mr. Clarke out. Why? We never are really told nor do we really care, but we do need an antagonist so the school board is it. Meanwhile, Mr. Clarke is actually SAVING the school the school board initially is responsible for ruining.

We get plenty of yelling, screaming and humiliation towards students as well as teachers from Mr. Clarke and company for the vast majority of the film. Tossed in we get a few cliches, like the obligatory scene featuring a young girl who got kicked out of her house, so in order for the film makers to force a ""teachers will save these kids at ANY cost"" persona, Mr. Clarke and the vice principal both head towards this girl's house to speak with her mom, in a useless, stale-acted scene that should have been left on the cutting room floor. Afterwards, more tension between Clarke, his decisions and company, plenty of more yelling, and eventually the police and fire chief catching Mr. Clarke illegally chaining the doors to keep the drug dealers out, and sending him to prison for breaking the law. Of course throughout all of this the students start to really fall in love with this man, as would most likely be the case as he is the only one in their lives who has ever showed any care for their well-being and betterment. The final scene then gives us the unrealistic and cliche scene where ALL the school's students gather together in a march towards the prison Mr. Clarke is being held in to protest for his release. Whether or not he is isn't shown, but what is shown is how the students were able to achieve their passing of the State's 'Basic Skills Test,' a standardized State test where students can prove they can count, add 2 + 2 and read at a 6th grade level.
So lots of it is cliched, lots of unrealistic, lots of the film is just overt yelling and screaming and grand preaching. If it's entertaining, I say 'so what?' And this film does entertain, because all this yelling and nail-biting is well acted, thanks mostly to Morgan Freeman, and does keep you gripped on the surprisingly well-written dialogue. Direction is done very well, and pacing never slows down, keeping you watching from start to finish. So all in all, people can say what they'd like about this film, but not only is it entertaining, but one of those films you may find yourself watching over and over and over again simply because the story itself is just interesting, plain and simple. Performances are gripping, plain and simple. Dramatic yelling is always enticing, plain and simple. After about the 3rd or 4th viewing, these characters begin to grow on you as they have for me after all of these years and perhaps at least 100 viewings.

I like it, and if you've never seen it, it is definitley worth watching if at least solely for the dramatic tension. Just don't expect to take away any sort of life lesson. The events, attitudes and procedures these teachers take and students portray are too out-dated already.",1331683200,,5754,4.649312377210216

Rolling his eyes as he reads answers over a student's shoulder during a test made me laugh out loud.  His nonstop rants against students, teachers, parents, pretty everybody are both funny and powerful.

Around this same time, Freeman put out two other movies.  One was GLORY.  The speech he gives as a former slave-turned-soldier at the campfire before the big climactic battle brought tears to my eyes.  The other movie was STREET SMART with Christopher Reeve.  Freeman plays a pimp who blackmails Reeve for an alibi and he's absolutely chilling.  That an actor can go from powerful righteousness to pure evil in two movies is amazing.

All the characters in this movie all have the same trait: tough on the outside, soft on the inside. Here is a bit of a warning for people who want to show this to their kids and don't know the material: there are at least a half-dozen abuses of God's name in vain and some unneeded sexual remarks. Also, they dealt with teen pregnancy a little too liberally but didn't dwell on it. (""There are alternatives,"" Clark says to a young girl after she confesses she's become pregnant.)

Other than that, solid acting and an interesting based-on-a-true life story made this a deserved hit film. A year later, Freeman solidified his status as a ""star"" with ""Driving Miss Daisy.""

What makes THIS movie superior to ""Stand and Deliver"" is that there's actually drama in this one. It shows just how tough inner city schools can be.

Hot-tempered, but motivational, Joe Clark (Morgan Freeman) takes the helm of New Jersey's East Side High School once the seat of academic excellence.  Facing undaunting turmoil, the school he has but one year to shape up is full of drug dealers, fights, and general mayhem.  Knowing that to get anyone to obey the rules, you have to enforce all, Clark ""takes no prisoners"" and armed with a megaphone and locks to keep criminals out, he gives his student body a whole new outlook on life.  But between his scornful nemesis, Leona Barrett (Lynne Thigpen) and a desperate and unpopular mayor (Alan North), he has more than his martinet sensibilities to keep in check.

Seeing Morgan Freeman not play someone sage and mellow is a real treat.  Sometimes his character makes us laugh and smile, especially when we see his soft heart behind the tough talk.

Over the years, the high school deteriorated to a school full of violence and drugs.  Their test scores and graduation rates were so deplorable, the state was considering taking over the school.

A new principal, Joe Clark (Morgan Freeman's character), was hired in an effort to save the school.  Even though he had a military-style of leadership, he really cared about the kids and instilled in them the value of education.  He told them that if they failed, they shouldn't blame their parents or blame the white man.  Since the majority of the school was poor African-Americans and Hispanics, he told them that if they didn't get an education, they would be locked out of the ""American Dream"" that they so heavily viewed on television.  He let them know that the one and only reason they would fail would because of themselves.  They were responsible for succeeding.  His message was that students should not lean on excuses.

Joe Clark turned the school around, and even though he could have been more supportive of his faculty, the school was so far gone that it need his disciplinary leadership.  Most of all, he instilled in the students responsibility and pride, and that is quite an accomplishment.",1176595200,,1337,4.8201754385964914

I don't know the basis of their rating system, frankly, but I don't see how Lean on Me could be considered a ""two star"" film. This movie, based on a true story, is an account of how a rough, strict, demanding, politically-incorrect principal managed to turn around and clean up an inner-city school which had been out of control and overrun with violence and drugs. It stars Morgan Freeman, who is his usual, brilliant self, and a number of supporting actors who each do a quality job (notably, Robert Guillaume). The writing is good, the pacing is quick but not rushed and the technical elements all serve their various ends.

Sure, you could say it's ""fairly standard Hollywood fare""--there aren't a whole lot of twists and turns, and the good guys win in the end, pretty much on schedule. But, when you present a real life story, you are rather constrained in what you can manage. This, in particular, is the tale of Joe Clark who actually did these things.

983453,3,6305133514,"""Lean on Me"" is one entertaining movie, and Morgan Freeman is sensational in it.  In fact, if he hadn't made another movie that year called ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" he probably would have gotten an Oscar nomination for this.  That said, I have to say the film has gotten the traditional Hollywood biographical treatment, which is to say credibility and plot coherence take a backseat to uplifting entertainment.  The final score:  for entertainment value, give ""Lean on Me"" *****; however, it only ranks a * on the credibility scale.
The plot has been regurgitated enough by previous reviewers, and several of the more honest reviews have been incisive and accurate in pointing out the flaws in the plot.  I, too, had a hard time with the chaining and locking of the school doors; this act is such a flagrant violation of the fire code it is laughable and puts the safety of hundreds of students at risk.  Also, the speech Clark gives where he blames the faculty for the failure of the students (in front of the student body, no less) is offensive and disrespectful and totally ignores a more important problem altogether: the total unwillingness of many parents to take responsibility for their failings as parents and for the acts of their children.  And I truly doubt Clark could get by with expelling three hundred students and face the wrath of a small group of angry parents led by what can only be described as a cruel stereotype: the loud-mouthed, trouble-making, liberal-minded, white and authority-hating ghetto mother, played by the late, wonderful character actress Lynne Thigpen. (Even she struggles with this dreadful role.) And the entire student body rallying to Clark's defense when his irresponsible actions finally catch up with him?  Laughable, to say the least.  But I have to disagree with the reviewer who characterized the story as a ""liberalization"" of what really happened.  If anything, Clark's tough-love approach to running the school is extremely conservative in nature, and many of his educational tactics are reminiscent of G.W. Bush's ""No Child Left Behind"" educational programs, which is the main reason Thigpen and the other parents fight him as hard as they do.
But as I said up front, the film is definitely entertaining if it isn't taken too seriously.  Director John G. Avildsen approaches the material in the typical crowd-pleasing, underdogs-win-in-the-end-so-let's-have-a-good-cry manner, which is effective until fifteen minutes after the film is over and you kick yourself in the butt for being manipulated.  And the supporting cast is stellar, including Robert Guillaume, Beverly Todd (as the beleagured vice principle) and Michael Beach.  And the wonderful Regina King has a touching two-scene cameo as a depressed, unemployed mother who no longer feels worthy of her daughter's love.
But this is Freeman's show and his incredible performance dominates the proceedings.  No matter how ridiculous his actions, no matter how over-the-top his character travels, (picking up a baseball bat and declaring to the press: ""They call me ""Crazy Joe"" now they can call me Batman!"") he makes Clark believable and manages to pull back and reflect on his own shortcomings and accept criticism at just the right time to keep the character from becoming a total egomaniac.  He is sensational, and ""Lean on Me"" was one of several consecutive films (including ""Street Smart,"" ""Clean and Sober,"" ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" and ""Glory"") in the late '80's that made him one of the most unlikely superstars in cinema history.

My biggest problem is how the filmmakers made it a point that Joe Clark blamed the teachers for everything wrong at that school. Is it their fault that the school district didn't do all it could to help the school? Is it there fault that the principals hadn't done all they could in the past? Is it their fault the kids swung in trees and had no discipline? NO! There was too much fingerpointing at the teachers and not enough at the parents. This is not how the real Eastside was. No one in their right mind would send their kids to a school if it was this bad. No school district would put up with it. The film just made a mockery of the education system by putting the blame on teachers and it wasn't fair. They made Joe Clark seem like some superman who helped the school on his own. The film made him into a hero as if he could walk on water. This film is not worth watching if you want the facts. I found the film entertaining but the message was fabricated.

983551,3,6305133514,"Reviewing a film like LEAN ON ME presents a moral dilemma for the serious reviewer.  On the one hand the reviewer is supposed to judge the movie on its own merits regardless of how far off from true life it is, and on the other hand to ignore totally the distinction between the real life and the Hollywood protagonist is to take the morally easy way out.  What the film presents is a mythologizing of a man who has made a career of bending the rules to achieve socially desirable goals while punishing and humiliating those who serve as his subordinates when they dared to bend those same rules.
  As the movie opens, Paterson High School is shown to be a school in name only.  It is far more anarchic than anything Glen Ford had to face in BLACKBOARD JUNGLE.  To emphasize this point, director John Avildsen subtly plays the song ""Welcome to the Jungle,"" thereby justifying whatever means Principal Clark wishes to take to restore a sense of order and learning. During the course of the movie, Morgan Freeman plays Clark as a principal who fights evil with evil.  In such situations, it is a given that the protagonist will accomplish his goals, much to the applause of a cheering audience. No one seems to notice that Clark's methods are not only morally questionable, but are downright illegal.  Witness his impromptu expulsion of dozens of the high school's worst students without due process or his chaining of the school's fire doors to keep neighborhood drug dealers out.  Finally, witness Clark's handlings of his teachers. He cannot hide his belief that they are all incompetent buffoons who totally deserve his fury. The point that Avildsen, Freeman, and certainly Clark himself who served as a technical advisor wish to make is that the means justify the ends.  By the end of the film, the audience has learned this message.
  LEAN ON ME is a technically competent film.  Freeman is convincing as Joe Clark.  The script is literate, given the speech patterns of most of the actors.  The audience is carried along from one mini crisis to another without bothering to think about what has passed in front of their eyes.  And it is precisely here that the moral reviewer finds his dilemma.  I thoroughly damn the true life Joe Clark as a sadistic megalomaniac with the same fervor that I praise the Morgan Freeman interpretation of Joe Clark. No one said that movies had to mirror reality, but I want this review to be like the little warnings on the sides of cigarette boxes: 'Caution: Viewing May Be Harmful to your Ethics.'",1023753600,15,2535,4.712018140589569

Do yourself a favor, and check out this flick,  It's one of the best.",1023235200,,1110,4.216981132075472

983646,4,6305133514,"Morgan Freeman gives one compelling performance in Lean On Me. He really captures the spirit of Joe Clark in portraying the turn around at East Side High. The film is loaded with dynamics. The scene where he shows Sams that he is no fool and dares him jump is a bit unrealistic and even inappropriate, but you got to admit it makes a point. It dares Sams to make a change if though it takes some time. The chaining fo the fire doors and the confrontations with the drug dealers also add fire if not totally realistic.
The many moments of heated confrontations between Clark, the teachers, the students, and the school board parents will definitely keep an audience listening. It delivers a good message that one man with a strong will can certainly accomplish a great deal. Realism aside this is a good movie. And anyone, does everything have to be so practical?",1011312000,4,862,4.603896103896104
983647,4,6305133514,"I went into this movie not wanting to like Joe Clark, based on what I had read about him in the newspapers.  When the movie was over, I had a greater respect for Mr. Clark and his efforts to turn around a high school that had turned into a dangerous cesspool for students.  Freeman does a great performance, portraying a tough (and often unreasonable) man who refused to let the situation handed to him run him over.",1004659200,,416,4.3896103896103895
983648,4,6305133514,"There's much to learn hear about leadership, management, and discipline.  All of which seem to be in short supply in many of our public schools.  But that may be more of a result of lethargic school boards rather than faculty.  Morgan Freeman is transformed into Joe Clark, the brash, hard nosed, take no prisoners principal of the all too real East Side High.  His principles are straight forward.  1) Discipline.  No cigarettes, weapons, mouthing off, grafitti, drugs, tardiness.  2) Personal responsibility for both teacher and student alike  3) Pride in yourself, your race, your community, and your institution.  4) Hard work.  And perhaps most importantly 5) the value of an education to affect your opportunities in life.
Joe Clark listens, encourages, chastises, and directs students and faculty.  And perhaps most importantly he is accessible.  Walking the hallways, attending classes.  Although his measures may have been at times extreme and not in keeping with popular sentiment you could not argue with his results.
The film works and I definitely rate it as a purchase just not necessarily a classic.",986688000,16,1114,5.191011235955056
983649,5,6305133514,"This is a ""feel good"" movie about a principal who wants to instill hope in kids and ""lead them on to victory,"" but his actions are not without consequences. The school board and the parents in the community will stop at nothing to remove him from his position. It will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. A very inspirational movie!
All you will get out of the DVD is just the movie. There are no ""extras"" such as commentarys, screen shots, credits, and so on. This doesn't even detract from the movie because the movie stands on its own two feet without the extra fancy stuff. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie and don't think you will be disappointed!",974160000,4,675,4.451612903225806
983650,4,6305133514,"This movie, when it first came out in the late '80s, I felt I had to see. I specifically recall the news stories of ""Crazy"" Joe Clark carrying around a bat in the Eastside HS hallways to keep students in line and the locking of the fire exit doors to protect the kids. Morgan Freeman was very believable as Clark and Robert Guillaume (of ""Soap"" and ""Benson"" fame) as the school superintendent was equally as good. I especially loved the scenes where the two of these actors would get into heated arguments, but because they were friends, the arguments were never taken personally. Even though some may accuse this film of being extreme in handling school violence and failing students, it's a movie all teachers and principals should see. In the school system today, such tactics as Joe Clark used are necessary! Great film!",970272000,14,824,4.729166666666667
983651,4,6305133514,"`Lean On Me' has become one of my favorite inspirational movies involving real people and events, despite the simplified and sometimes sappy-sickly-sweet Hollywood `feel-good' treatment it's been given, along with a happy ending that ties everything up a bit too neat and nice. The forces trying to stop Joe Clark's straightforward efforts to turn Eastside High School around has been simplified for the movie, basically involving just a disgruntled parent and the city mayor. Even the many heated arguments between Clark and his faculty & superiors are less than sophisticated in wording and tone. None the less, I've always loved Morgan Freeman's performance of Clark.
Clark's expulsion of the most delinquent students was a pretty neat scene, and was something of a surprise when I first saw it. Anyone who'd attempt that nowadays would probably get sued penniless. And the rooftop scene where he tells expelled crackhead student Thomas Sams to just jump off the roof of the school and kill himself swiftly rather than slowly by smoking crack is one of my fave film moments, and the best 'tough love' moment in movie history: ""It kills your brain cells, son, it kills your brain cells!""
And as the school improves, Clark does as well. In the movie you see him learning and adapting alongside the students & faculty. Even with his best efforts, he discovers that can't turn things around by himself. At first, his gruff behavior and strongarm approaches to solving problems makes most of the teachers reluctant to help him out. But they learn to adapt to Clark, and he learns to soften his methods a bit, and even gains a sense of humor.
Sadly, the real Joe Clark, to a small degree, has `gone Hollywood'. His big gig nowadays is working the lecture circuit, as a motivational speaker. He's even written a book about what to do to save America's public schools. I've heard some of his speeches, and found them rather compelling, but I feel his talents and drive are best suited for running a school in need of a decisive, no-nonsense leader who gets things done.

983652,5,6305133514,"Lean On Me was a great film. Morgan Freeman played an important role in this film. His acting was great. It's about this principal named Joe Clark (Morgan Freeman) that goes into a new school and sees nothing but disaster  caused by the students. But he is not angry at the students. He is angry at  the staff. He always yells at the staff from the top of his lungs because  they can't get the kids in line. The school board gives him one year to get  his students to pass a required student state test. They should have passed  the test years ago but the staff could not get them to pass it. But Joe  Clark did. Joe Clark is not to happy about his staff. He even fires a few  of them. It's like they just gave up on the school. But when Joe Clark  comes along, everything changes. The swearing in this movie could have been  a little less, but that is the only drawback. Buy this movie, you will be  happy you did.",962928000,2,915,4.11864406779661

Starts out with brutal honesty of how students can be and  turns out to be a feel good movie that keeps you cheering for the main  students and their principal.  Yes, director Alvidsen has taken this  approach before, but isn't the old saying, if it ain't broke don't fix it?  GRADE: B+",955324800,,450,4.469135802469136

Morgan Freeman was on a role in this era, and he and Denzel Washington revealed to Hollywood after Glory that they were outstanding actors that could lead and carry a movie.

Joe Clark inspired and infuriated many. I love his choice of words, and his in your face accountability.

The respectability politics and tough love of this man wouldn't fly in the current social and societal structure.
