3710189,1,B001N3BD1I,"I wish I could give this zero stars, but that is not an option. Without even thinking about it, I allowed my son to watch this without veiwing it myself first. I did watch it with him though. I bought this DVD for my autistic son thinking he would love watching it. He really loves animals. I knew the first episode would be about endangered species. I thought it would be talking about these animals and how we are helping them by creating breeding programs and rehabilitation programs. Instead it was full of topics on why these animals are disappearing. They use the word ""slaughter"" repeatedly. They even play gunshots in the background. Since there are three episodes on this DVD I will keep this and let my son only watch the last two episodes until I can get something to replace it. Anyone who knows an autistic child also knows you can't just remove something they love without having something to replace it with first.",1296259200,6,929,4.602409638554217
3710190,5,B001N3BD1I,"Animals and Us is a very worthwhile DVD. One episode does go into detail about endangered animals, and the issues surrounding it, but in a kid friendly way, with facts that an elementary school textbook might include. The show's heartwarming, funny, and playful exploration of the animal world is refreshing and fun for kids. The other episodes on this DVD show how animals are protected by people in zoos and aquariums. It's important information for kids, because they typically first encounter animals in zoos and may wonder what zoos are for--which is a great question. The other DVDs in the series cover the animal kingdom with fascinating facts and stories about animals from all over the world. It's wonderful. A highly recommended series! My kids love it. So do I.",1259798400,5,772,4.946153846153846
3710191,1,B001N3BD1I,"My daughter enjoyed some of the Animal Atlas clips from a bonus CD included with another order, so I thought I would suprise her with a full DVD of Animal Atlas.  This DVD starts off saying that it is different than their normal light-hearted shows, and is a little more serious.  OK, wasn't sure what to expect, but they went on to say they were going to talk about endangered animals and how important it is to help and preserve our wildlife.  Sounds good, and it is in theory, but NOT in the way this DVD does.  It is way too strong languaged, talking about slaughtering of animals - which of course my daughter wanted to know what that meant - how tiger's paws look better on the animal, having gun sounds in the background while talking about poachers, etc.

My daughter was very upset after watching just a portion of this DVD and we quickly turned it off.  She has continued to be upset for a few days, and with bad dreams about animals being hurt (they didn't show any hurt animals, the strong suggestions were enough).  I am appalled that the producers would publish this DVD for the intended age group (my daughter is four).  I had ordered the other two Animal Atlas DVDs as well, but haven't opened them, and will send all of them back.",1256515200,20,1247,4.414847161572053
