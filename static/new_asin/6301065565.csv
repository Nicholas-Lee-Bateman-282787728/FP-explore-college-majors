309474,5,6301065565,"Read the book ages ago when salt was first invented. A great story of a land and people.

309479,2,6301065565,"I was required to watch this movie for a class, but I found it to be slow of pace with a cliched storyline. The performances are the strongest element of the film and kept the movie from being painful to watch, but even solid directing by Redford couldn't save this one. Unless you have to watch it (as I did), I'd say watching popcorn pop is more entertaining than this film.",1496707200,,376,4.309859154929577

309532,5,6301065565,"I love this movie. One of Robert Redford's first films and quite possibly his best. Very few people know this film. But, it is truly one of the best light-comedic films you will ever watch. Terrific cast and wonderfully written. I've spent time in northern New Mexico and it is just as quirky as presented. My wife kept resisting watching the movie with me, but finally relented. Couple of days later I asked her, ""So?"" She said she hadn't realized just how enjoyable it would be. If you loved The Full Monty for its social commentary and light touch. You will love The Milagro Beatified War!",1495497600,,592,4.59433962264151
309533,2,6301065565,I made the mistake of not understanding that it could not  be played on DVD player.  I saw the movie when it came out 87 or 88 anyway. I wanted to save it. It came on time but I was not happy with the product. This was not the sellers fault.,1494374400,,241,3.7058823529411766

309535,5,6301065565,"Having lived in northern New Mexico, this film is a reminder of what was and the destructive forces of development.  Nicely presented and enjoyable.  Just back from New Mexico and everyone I talked to had fond memories of the film.",1493164800,,231,4.75
309536,5,6301065565,"Best story in the world (okay, a bit of an exaggeration, but not much) of people beating corporations.

309595,5,6301065565,"This is a 1988 film by Robert Redford, and is one of those you and your family (kids 14+) will want to watch over and over.  The very small town of Milagro, New Mexico is a depressed place made up predominantly of people from direct Mexican decent in which everyone knows everyone with a mix of old and new.  A storyline with people from the north coming into town also.  But a ""big time"" developer is constructing his new large scale ""Resort & Golf Course"" facility and is taking over everything - but a small Bean Field owned by a down and out town's-family man trying to care for his family in any way he can stands in the way of these Big-time high rollers progress.  This film has beautiful Landscape Shots, Humor, Drama, a nice Plot, and one of those film types that allows you relate to each of the characters.  It won an Academy Award for Best Music Score with its haunting melody you personally can't get enough of (by famed composer Dave Ruskin), and was also nominated for other Academy Awards.  The film also has a cast of actors that you will recognize immediately.  A truly nice and great film for all.",1481760000,2,1116,4.414634146341464

309688,5,6301065565,"We saw this movie when it first hit the theaters in 1988.  Recently, while traveling in New Mexico, we saw a sign off the interstate for Milagro which sparked our interest to see the movie again.  It's a fun little movie with a good cast;  I especially liked Ruben Blades as Sheriff Bernie Montoya & Daniel Stern as the sociology student doing research for a paper.  It's a story of rebellion against corporate interests where the little guy comes out on top, thanks to the intervention of a strong townswoman, a disillusioned lawyer, & an old man with a pig who talks with angels.",1479168000,,581,4.5576923076923075

309693,4,6301065565,"Why this film is not regarded as a modern classic, I don't know.  Robert Redford directed, and he clearly loved both the wonderful John Nichols novel on which it is based and the land and people that are its subject.  An amazing ensemble cast has been gathered, including Christopher Walken, Melanie Griffith, John Heard, Daniel Stern, Sonia Braga, and Ruben Blades.  The late Freddy Fender shows up as the town's mayor.  These people seem real, even the Coyote Angel who visits elderly Amarante.  Joe Mondragon's bean field and the water to irrigate it may seem a small matter, but how this affects his neighbors makes for a touching and joyous story.  Dave Grusin's perfect score and Redford's eye, augmented by Robbie Greenburg's cinematography make the real star of the movie the unique landscape of northern New Mexico.  Give this film a couple hours.  Like all the classics, it will pay you handsomely for your investment.",1475280000,2,928,4.941935483870968

309858,5,6301065565,"Really depressing to see comments about this movie that are not accurate. The people depicted in this film are not Mexicans. But Spanish immigrants who settled the area 500 years ago. As time went on some intermarrying did happen between the Pueblo and Spanish immigrants. They blended to become New Mexican.

This part of the world is distinctly New Mexican Spanish (Northern). From the traditions, to the language, to the way mass is performed and the food it is Spanish New Mexican. It is the hippies from the 60's that infested Santa Fe and Taos that have spread this misinformation and culturally misappropriated the whole culture. Georgia O'Keeffe is a the queen of cultural misappropriation and benefitted from the area. The only ones that hold her on their shoulders is Northern European Americans with no sense.

The same people who think these people are Mexican, Chicano, Latino or whatever moniker they give, love the mystery and exotic nature of New Mexico, are the same people who think Argentineans and Brazilians are close enough to be the same.

FYI, just because you name is Smith or Ackermann does not mean you have the provenance to be ""pure"" or more American and can steal others cultures.

310245,5,6301065565,"A great movie about the culture of the descendants of the colonial Spanish in this country. Robert Redford gets it right. Great musical score too. The only thing I don't quite agree with is the comment made by the sociology student that the ""Santos"" (saints) are part of the Native American culture.
All Catholics pray to saints for intercessions, including Catholics in Europe who have no Native American heritage or influence. As Catholics we believe in patron saints who pray for us when we pray to them. We usually light candles (special ones designed for this) and place them at the base of the saint being prayed to for them to intercede with Heaven for us. This is why the Reformed churches accused Catholics of idolatry.
At any rate, I remember my grandmother's little shrine of saints in her bedroom with a few special candles ready for any particular request she had.",1439424000,,877,4.776315789473684

I found the portrayal of the wealthy corporation (aka, bad guys) to be a bit flat, but every other character kind of jumps off the screen as real.  The ending . . . I won't spoil it, but lets say it begins better than it ends.  I loved the Daniel Stern kind of showing up as a college intern, in the middle of a town in a drought.  That was so unexpected and he was so out of place, but it's the little bits that make a movie work.  In this film, they had the activist, the person who was bitter and indifferent and the old man who talked to his pig and talked to ghosts, and the sheriff trying to stay friendly with both sides, the townsfolk while doing and keeping his job.

Christopher Walken had to have had some great fun being as bad as he can get and the rest of the actors often surprise with unexpected twists.  Even Lupita was perfectly cast.

310548,4,6301065565,"Released in 1988, The Milagro Beanfield War is a whimsical drama about a Hispanic town in Northern New Mexico thats being invaded by land developers who want to turn the town into a resort and drive out the Chicano villagers. Chick Vennera plays the owner of the beanfield, Sonia Braga the champion of his cause, John Heard an aging ex-hippie lawyer who supports them and Daniel Stern a New York college student who takes up living on the beanfield property; Christopher Walken and Richard Bradford play the villains while Melanie Griffith has a cameo.

This was Robert Redfords second movie in the director chair after the successful Ordinary People (1980). It failed at the box office perhaps because, while Milagro isn't bad at all, its not great either; its somewhere in between. Its professionally made with a great cast and locations, but its only mildly engrossing. The problem is that there are so many characters, Bragas being the best, none of them are portrayed with much depth. It wouldve been a better movie if they cut out the fat and focused on a few of the characters, throwing in a dramatic hook, like Jack & Rose in Titanic. A good example of something that couldve been cut is Daniel Sterns character. Although Stern does fine in the role its really an unnecessary character since the story already features a gringo who sides with the villagers. Despite this negative, I enjoyed the film and it leaves you with a good feeling. Its reminiscent of 1984s The River in tone and quality, albeit chipper and quirkier.

The film runs 117 minutes and was shot in Espanola, Los Alamos, Truchas and Santa Fe, New Mexico.

THE MILAGRO BEANFIELD WAR: Joe Mondragon's (Vennera) dusty beanfield is dying of thirst. Suddenly, water begins flowing into it. Too bad it's just a leak: the water belongs to the Divine Land Development Co., the conglomerate that's tearing down most of Milagro to erect the biggest condo/golf course/recreation area in all of New Mexico. Joe's tiny plot of inherited property is the only piece they don't own--yet.

The accidental irrigation polarizes the town--and the state government, which wants Joe stopped, but without any publicity that might focus attention on the shady development deal. They certainly don't want Joe turned into a folk hero. So they send in boogeyman Montana (Walken), who masterminds a series of dirty tricks, which only aggravates the situation; as it escalates and everyone grows edgier, the shopkeeper does brisk business in bullets. It'll take a big sacrifice to solve this, Coyote Angel (Carricart) advises. But what sacrifice is big enough? A road grader? A pig? The field? A neighbor's life?

""I know a lost cause when I see one,"" reluctant activist Bloom (Heard) informs quixotic homegal Ruby (Braga). But ""Milagro"" is Spanish for ""miracle,"" and that's exactly what the lethargic residents require. If the development deal proceeds, skyrocketing taxes will force the poverty-stricken local folk to sell out and move, spelling death for their quirky little community. Stubborn Joe's got huevos, however--and his aged neighbor Amarante (Riquelme, in the film's best performance), who walks between two worlds, has the spirit of Coyote Angel on their side.

Picaresque, whimsical, brimming with truly magical magical realism, this amusing fable is filled with gorgeous photography, and there's a twinkle in the eye of every frame. It provides both smiles and out-loud laughs in abundance, excellent ensemble acting, sweet insight into human nature and its foibles, and some delightfully clich-breaking defusing of tense situations.",1421971200,,2224,5.2740112994350286

These are country people trying to live in their traditional New Mexico community despite the onslaught of developers who don't understand the culture.  The movie highlights the spectacular New Mexico scenery and some of the culture and traditions of families that have lived in the area for hundreds of years.

311101,5,6301065565,"The Milagro Beanfield War is the best movie ever.  Its better than your favorite movie.  Old man Amarante is the best character ever.  He has a Peacekeeper; he can drive a tractor and hangs out with an Angel.  Adapted by John Nichols from his book (havent read it), it was made in the late 80s (dont remember them), a great period for filmmaking by a few accounts.  It has the nicest cop youll ever meet and a script that respects your intelligence while nestling itself into your heart like a stray puppy.  There are beans, an old hippie, some Mexican folk magic, and, as a public service, blissfully brief introductions to comparative religion and irrigation methods.

How much would you pay for this incredible value?  Dont answer yet, because it also includes a one-armed man, Melanie Griffith, and an Oscar-winning soundtrack by Dave Grusin.  But waittheres more!  The Milagro Beanfield War also features Christopher Walken, Snia Braga, and that guy (Daniel Stern).  Impress your friends and your weird relative from Albuquerque at the same time!  You get it all: low riders, an anthropologist with round glasses, a pig, a cow, even a strange lady throwing rocks at people from behind a fence.  What more could you want?  Spoiler alert: there aren't any explosions.  There are a couple of gunshots, though.  Youll laugh, youll cry, youll remember you love Ruben Blades and why!

There might be little moments that ring untrue or forced, but the 'magic realism' tone allows this to happen without getting in the way of the story.

New Mexico:  An apprehensive activist lawyer who's not certain he's up to any more activism; a feisty young woman afraid of nothing but losing her heritage; a young farmer who developed guts enough to accidentally steal water for his bean field and then, encouraged, find more to take back his kidnapped milk cow under gunpoint, but who also worries he is going to lose in the end; a bunch of high powered corporate real estate developers who use strong arm tactics but haven't quite thought this one through; an old Mexican man who talks to the spirit of his deceased brother because it brings him comfort, and who has nothing to lose now anyway; local people, unprepared for worldly intrusion trying to represent and mitigate both sides without the right tools; and Robert Redford, who brought this insightful film to the rest of us and directed it.  And a pig.

Milagro means ""miracle"" in Spanish.  The real miracle that unfolded here was uniting a poverty ridden community into action, made difficult by having to instantly, overnight, in order to be effective, overcome years of fear and control; laws that work for others but not for them, and know that it may mean loss anyway against a force stronger than they think they are.

Several prominent stars:  Christopher Walken, Melanie Griffith in a few brief scenes, James Gammon doing his usual good job as ""Horsethief Shorty"", and John Heard as the reluctant lawyer.

Some subtle humor. A story about poor folks coming together. A story about the government-union partnering with the rich to sell-out the poor.

A rich developer has stolen the water-rights of a small village in New Mexico through political and legal corruption. The people have no water to farm for themselves. The selfish, greedy, developer also plans to force the folks out by raising their taxes through public projects for his development, which the poor townsfolk cannot afford.

A poor man's house is the last hold-out right in the middle of the developer's planned golf-course. This poor man takes a positive step out of the gloom by re-planting his father's small bean-field on his own land, but using the water which flows along the edge of his land; water which is ""owned"" by the developer. The poor man will not make any significant money from this small garden, and is only doing it to boost his own morale. However, the developer and the petty government officials in his pocket are outraged at this affront to their power.

This movie realistically portrays the mentality of many within the self-serving, government-employees-union.

The developer has bought-up the land of families, who were able to move. Only old people living on the outskirts of the development are left. This gloomy scenario gives the film an unappealing appearance on the surface, so I thought I would not like it, but I did. There is a lot you come to understand as the movie goes along. At first I thought they were in Mexico instead of the U.S., New Mexico.

Late in the film Ruby goes to the local store; in the background a woman shopper picks up a bottle of 'Newman's Own Salad Dressing""; the clerk says, ""That's no good."" Producer Robert Redford taking a jab at his friend Paul Newman.

The old man with the sombrero who plays the accordian and talks to the old man with the pet pig is his guardian-angel. In the middle of the film; he is sitting with the old-man; but when another person arrives his chair is shown empty from the stranger's point of view, while the old man continues to talk to him.",1361836800,,2207,4.7020725388601035

I don't think Robert Redford wasted one moment of his amazing eye and ability to make any subject interesting, beautiful and rich on this movie. The music is perfect, the cinema photography unsurpassed, the directing is visionary and the acting is believable and enduring. The story of a small, dying town being ravaged by a big land developer taking away the life blood and property of people who have lived in the location for 300+ years. It turns into an all or nothing fight from the ones who need their land, jobs and dignity the most over a small field of pinto beans.  The local customs and believes make for a rainbow of sources to draw from when writing a thesis. The bad character seems to relish in his power, the insensitive rich developer and his dumb (like a fox wife)one might tend to be sympathetic (but not really), the enduring elderly citizens and a group of nice guys fighting the best they can is very entertaining.

There are so many characters and story lines perfectly intertwined within this film.  Yet it never seemed to burden the viewer.  Each individual appears to have a cacophony of levels.  From the troublesome pet pig to the ethereal, sly spirit who often shows up to give the viewers new insight, or just cause a little stirring of the pot, it's adorable! Braga, Hurt, Walkin, Blades, Carlos Requelme, Chick, Carricart and young Daniel Stern have each added a sweet measure of their faces, acting, and craft to make this a memorable mix of precious, arrogant, wicked, hot tempered and charming all at once.

I will watch this movie over and over again for years to come.",1313107200,,1760,4.673139158576052

311712,5,6301065565,"THE MILAGRO BEANFIELD WAR was a wonderfully orchestrated, directed and overlooked film by Robert Redford.  It truly showcases magical realism, a style of storytelling often depicted in Latin American tales, LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE, a novel written by Laura Esquivel and brought to the screen by Alfonso Arau, being another great example. Essentially, magical realism is an artistic genre in which magical elements appear in an otherwise realistic setting. When done well in film, the viewer transported to another space and time where there nothing is impossible.

This great story take place in a small New Mexican town (I am not exaggerating when I say ""small,"" either.  The population is 500 and many of the residents acquire their livelihood from the land, in the beanfields, to be specific).  All of that is about to be challenged by stealthy land developers who want to destroy the rich and pliable earth, to construct golf courses and other more Yuppified, upper-middle class attractions.  There is one man who plans to stand his ground in the face of developers (and even bulldozers).  That man is Joe Mondragon (Chick Vennera).  What's more, Amarante, the elder of the town (Carlos Riquelme), who has been written off as crazy, speaks to the angels (people who knew and lived in the town long before the developers were even a glimmer in their parent's eyes).  This also co-stars Christopher Walken, as the token ""bad guy"" (a typecast he has become all to well-known for), Sonia Braga, Ruben Blades and Daniel Stern.

Magical realism comes into play in many respects.  For example, Amarante's dialogue with the angels is very real and common place for the elderly man, but a form of insanity to his neighbors.  Also, the line between incident and fate gets progressively blurred, after an accident occurs.  I don't want to ruin it for you, so, you'll just have to see it for yourself.  This film is humorous, intelligent and very well-done.  I think you'll enjoy it, too.",1181692800,6,1981,4.963636363636364

This movie touched my heart in many ways not the least of which it's fictional town Milagro was filmed around the area of Truchas New Mexico which is not far from where I was born in Santa Fe New Mexico.  The story is a story that can be happening in the littlest of towns in New Mexico to the littlest towns anywhere.  It tells of over development and all horrors that come with it under the guise improvement.  The big guns in all these ""improvements"" in any areas are only concerned about themselves and how much money they are going to make they are not worried about the smaller man.  This is a delightful story with humorous insights into real small town life.  I can't think of one character that did not add something to this movie even Amarante's pig Lopita (except in the book it was Pacheco's pig).  This book and movie is not an old movie in the sense of a classic movie but it should be put in that category of a classic.  The tale is just as pertinent today as when it was written.

That said, this is still a great movie for anyone who would like a glimpse at small town New Mexico life. The scenery is beautiful, the people tell it like it is, and there's something a little big magical in the air.

It's sad that the situation the people found themselves in, is quite accurate. Northern NM is being taken over by land developers. Just visit Santa Fe or Taos and see what I mean.

I'm really glad to hear that the soundtrack is available. The music is definitely one of the best parts of this movie.

And the cast? Christopher Walken!! Melanie Griffith, Daniel Stern (definitely underrated), John Heard, Ruben Blades...  and the use of local people fro the area couldn't have been a better choice in casting.

311792,5,6301065565,"Since the medium was first introduced, I've been waiting (were it applicable for me, I'd say praying, on bended knee) for Milagro to appear on DVD. This movie easily ranks among the top entries in my ""desert island"" must-haves. To be honest, I never held out much hope that it would ever happen. The release of this title on DVD is one of the most pleasant surprises in recent memory, almost  enough to make me religious -- ""Thank you God for granting me another day!""

Nichol's work, after his successful novel ""The Sterile Cuckoo"" (made into a movie starring a very young Lisa Minelli) and his subsequent move to northern New Mexico, took a turn that was politically anathema to some (increasingly leftist), but his passion for the land and for the people transcends the realm of the political and becomes something spiritual -- hence, the name, Milagro, which means miracle. Even if you can't identify politically, this is one of the most beautiful cinematic presentations I've seen, and it's drenched in humanity.

Prior to Redford's movie interpretation, I was already a total Nichols fan. His New Mexico Trilogy -- The Milagro Beanfield War (1974), The Magic Journey (1978), and The Nirvana Blues (1981) -- was a heartfelt take on the northern New Mexico socioscape of indigenous people suffering in the wake of encroaching money and development from major American population centers. Rich people, searching for escapes, retreats, and vacation homes in the gorgeous Western hinterland, have been displacing the long-time residents of those hinterlands for decades. Nichol's books take on the viewpoint of the people dispossessed and disenfranchised. The theme still resonates today wherever the powerless are pushed aside for new development, vacation estates/ranchettes, or a new golf course. The last paragraph of ""Nirvana Blues"" confirms Nichol's digust with America's disregard for the powerless. His main character dreams of going to a better place, a place where people are respected, honest work is respected, and wealth doesn't rule absolutely -- in Nichol's 1981 vision, this means Cuba: ""Yet Joe remained intact, and continued falling toward the green hills and succulent valleys of a Communist country.""

Today, of course, it wouldn't be politic to make such a statement. As a political entity, communism has been pronounced a failure (Ronnie Reagan, early to mid 80s), and, by extension, ANY and ALL social concepts like the rights of each and every member of a given society have fallen into disrepute. After all, we live in George Bush's America ... now that I think about it, the message of the New Mexico Trilogy is more relevant today than it has been at any time since 1981. Ultimately, Nichol's work is about protecting the rights of the common man in the face of political and monied interests. I ain't no rich man's son, and I can identify. If you've ever experienced a feeling of creeping social vulnerability, of being overrun by irresistable forces, of being dispassionately cast aside, check out this movie, and better yet, read the three books in Nichol's New Mexico Trilogy. They're all about people, the land, and real compassion. They're also very rich reads, produced by a highly skilled wordsmith.

I don't know how involved you were in the production of this DVD, but thank you VERY MUCH Robert Redford for making the release of this movie to DVD a reality.

Oh, I forgot to mention that the soundtrack is magical. My wife and I have been hoping that it would make it to CD at some point, but that's probably WAY too much to hope for.

On the surface, it is about a poor farmer who inspires his neighbors to join forces and defeat a rich developer's attempts to build a resort on the land adjacent to their tiny village.  The real appeal of this somewhat naively optimistic tale, however, is not the plot.  Rather, it is the sympathetic, often humorous, presentation of memorable characters who evoke some of the the spirit and eccentricities of Northern New Mexican culture.  I found the ancient little man Amarante, who keeps a pet pig and regularly converses with saints and angels, particularly appealing. His sardonic angel friend, dressed in traditional Mexican clothing, lends a touch of magical realism and humor.",1124236800,2,717,5.102564102564102

Ruben blades is especially good and Christopher Walken is in another slightly off- center role.,1122422400,2,412,4.816901408450704
311798,4,6301065565,"Robert Redford's 2nd film is a noble effort.  ""The Milagro Beanfield War"" is adapted from John Treadwell Nichols novel, which I must admit I have not read.  In the accompanying documentary Redford tells us that the book was more sprawling with more characters and subplots.  His film is just about right.

While watching I was reminded of the writings of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, full of passion and the supernatural in a way that seems perfectly natural.  For example, the film opens showing us a Mexican dancing through the community of Milagro during sunrise.  This old man then has a conversation with Amarante, the oldest citizen of Milagro.  It wasn't until some time later that I picked up on the fact that the old Mexican is an Angel. Amarante is the only one who can see and carry on conversations with him.  In a ""Hollywood"" movie this might be the entire plot - man ""sees"" an Angel no one else can see.  But in this story the ""Angel"" subplot is just one of many colorful textures added to a rich storyline.

The story is one of ""rich vs poor"".  The Milagro residents have lived there for centuries, and though they were never wealthy they made do in their community.  Wealthy developers are coming to build a community of luxury for those who can pay, and will want a golf course where bean fields now stand.

Characters are not black and white in this story - much like real-life - and the story is enriched by added subtle shades to many complex characters.  Chick Vennera portrays Joe Mondragon, a Mexican whose father left him one of the proudest bean fields of Milagro, now dried up due to lack of irrigation.  The water has been diverted by the rich developers - who have the means to MAKE water flow to their development.  The irrigation ditch runs right beside the bean field and one day out of frustration at lack of work Joe kicks a valve that diverts part of the water to his father's bean field.  Everyone in Milagro immediately senses the significance of the water.  The water ""belongs"" to Mr. Devine and his developers.  But the water is also all the is keeping Milagro from it's former agricultural glory.

Ruby, played by Sonia Braga, runs an auto body shop, where honest work is done.  But she knows that her mechanics don't have the expertise to work on the new Mercedes and Jaguars that will be coming into town if the rich developers have their way.  John Heard has a great understated role as Charlie Bloom, a lawyer who was once a political activist, but who is now in Milagro.  It seems he came there to avoid waves.  Now he runs a paper that only comes out every couple of days.  Ruby pressures Charlie into joining the cause against the developers, and the sequence around a town meeting that Ruby calls is one of the highlights of the movie.  Ruby first invites reluctant Charlie to the meeting to cover it for his paper.  But once the group is assembled she calls him up as a lawyer expert to explain to the people WHY it's important that Milagro not be turned into high-priced real estate.  The scene is masterful story-telling and some of the most clever exposition of any film.  Charlie explains plainly that once the rich folks move in they'll demand better schools, better public works and finally the families that have lived in Milagro for 500 years won't be able to afford the taxes of their own community.

Ruben Blades is great as Sheriff Montoya, perhaps the coolest head in Milagro.  Several times during the story there is a standoff with folks aiming guns at one another, only to have the Sheriff calm the situation down.  The great character actor James Gannon portrays Shorty, who is employed by the developers, but is also sympathetic to the natives as well.

Daniel Stern portrays a college boy and Christopher Walken is a menacing lawman in effective performances.

The magic in Milagro comes from Redford's willingness to let the story unfold, painting the town and the unique characters in warm strokes that are believable and engaging.",1121040000,3,3994,4.650499286733238
311799,5,6301065565,"Only Robert Redford's 2nd directorial effort, this film is purely from the heart. This is a true ensemble piece, worthy of Altman, and Redford's love of the land is quite appropriate. I was most impressed with the fact that this film is about  Mexican/Native American types, and found no need for sex, drugs, blood or real violence (that stuff seems to prevail when regarding cultural differences). How refreshing. Foremost is the fact that this has a whimsical element of fantasy, and a quasi David/Goliath subtext. I was especially amused when the old man was playing chess with the Angel (a bit of Bergman, perhaps?). Aside from the gorgeous vistas of New Mexico, beautifully photographed, it is Dave Grusin's Oscar-winning score that is most intriguing (it's ONLY Oscar nomination). The lovely guitar of Angel Romero is prevalent throughout, adding to Grusin's 5/8 time with endless modulations, suggesting that this is a land that will go on forever. The acting is wonderful, without exception. The previous reviewers have all failed to mention how strong Chick Vennera was in the lead role. So very handsome, and so un-self-conscious. A wonderful performance. If there would be a second lead, it would have to be Carlos Riquelme as the old geezer that everyone thinks is nuts, but actually talks to Angels. Sonia Braga, John Heard, Daniel Stern, Nancy Mandragon, and especially, James Gammon, were all solid. I love this film a lot, because it really makes me feel good. And that music...it stays with you. Quite haunting. I recommend this film for families; no matter how poor you might be, financially, standing up for yourself and your integrity can make you rich beyond your wildest dreams.",1119744000,73,1700,5.049822064056939
311800,3,6301065565,"let's start with the positive.  GREAT DVD quality!  Excellent cinematography!  More than passable acting (a bit over-acted on Sonia Bragga's part, but not as bad as in ""Moon Over Parador"").  Redford is also a good director and this is better than his newer, more pretentious films.  If you can choke down yet another good-people-of-the-land-versus-greedy-developers plot, this isn't a bad film.

This film is fairly true-to-life, too: Milagro in reality is Truchas, NM, a very old hardscrabble farm village between Chimayo and Penasco (that's in the real high country north of Santa Fe).  Water rights are indeed sacred there and it is a delightful area to live in (if you don't mind a snowy winter and being a long way from a supermarket).  But the real big encroachment there isn't from big-time developers but rather from individual 'new age'crystal power types coming in from Santa Fe or California, disrupting a half-millenium old way of life.....

'Milagro' it's not entirely the edenic area the film makes it out.  This would have been a somewhat better film if the director and writer had admitted that the average folk in that area have really severe drug problems and aren't exactly high on initiative.

Nonetheless, Beanfield War is a cute little film and a great look at my home area in glorious northern NM.",1116979200,16,1320,4.981735159817352
311846,5,6301065565,"I received the UK DVD release of The Milagro Beanfield War several months ago and the digital transfer of this beautiful film is truly breathtaking-- the saturated colors, the wonderful New Mexico light. If the British DVD is any indication, viewers should be in for a very special treat. A great cast. A warm, whimsical slice of life which affectionately captures the wonderful essence of New Mexico, the Land of Enchantment. Not to be missed!!!",1115596800,5,446,4.96
311847,5,6301065565,"Others have summarized the plot below so I will try to add a few relevant thoughts.  First of all, the story is basically a skim off the John Nichols novel.  Like all his books, it is so deep in back story that no movie can contain more than a tithe of the actual narrative.  This screenplay actually does it justice, though.  The strength of the work is not the plot but the characters.  In Nichols' novel, each character has such richness and depth, they become very much alive and real.  Sadly, no movie can ever capture all of that, but I think Redford's efforts here managed to pick up enough of it to make the film work because the most important character in the film is the town of Milagro itself.  By getting even a glimpse of such venerable old-timers as Amarante Cordova, Onofre Martinez, and Nick Rael's crazy mother, we understand much more of Milagro's personality.

  Within the movie we get some very nice depth added to other characters, as well.  Reuben Blades as Sheriff Bernabe Montoya, for example, is tripping over his feet jumping a ditch in one scene and using cunning wisdom to disarm a firefight in the next.  Sonia Braga's passive-aggressive manipulation of John Heard's lawyer-activist is brilliantly played by both of them.  James Gammon as Horsethief Shorty, the one Anglo who may love Milagro as much as the local Hispanics, is perfectly played, as well.

  The film is beautifully photographed and Redford's love of the American Southwest is visually documented here with a very nice touch.  The soundtrack also adds a lot of character to the piece and is very well placed.  Finally, two small roles that I thought added a lot to the movie were Julie Carmen as Nancy Mondragon, Joe's wife, and also Freddy Fender as Milagro's mayor, Sammy Cantu.

  Overall, this is one of those movies that isn't so much about what happens in the film as it is about how the director and the actors portray it, which in this case is done beautifully.",1112659200,5,1966,4.673469387755102

311851,5,6301065565,"After his well-known, Academy Award-winning success with ORDINARY PEOPLE, Robert Redford directed the unheralded MILAGRO BEANFIELD WAR, a tale that speaks of the importance of the basics of life versus the onset of supposed progress, materialism and pride.

A small farmer makes the mistake of using water that isn't his to use in order to cultivate a parched and unproductive beanfield.  Sonia Braga (STREETS OF LAREDO) stars as a mechanic in the farmer's New Mexico pueblo who supports the farmer and joins the ""war"" against the real estate developer who cares about nothing but himself and his profits. Ultimately the townspeople and the developers square off.  You'll love the ""hombre angel"" that keeps popping up.

Enchantingly written THE MILAGRO BEANFIELD WAR is a wonderful film.  Frankly, I'm surprised that it doesn't have a stronger following. A great cast includes Ruben Blades as the sheriff and Christopher Walken as a corrupt state police officer.  A movie you'll watch again and again!

Richard Bradford (joined by Melanie Griffith) also gives us the perfect ""fat cat"" & (his) band of bad guys that are trying to hoard an already conspicuous pipeline of water through a dry valley near the Mexican border when one of the (near povertied) residents of Milagro makes a grave, yet somehow worthy mistake.

In any event, a poignant, sweet movie, and a genuine beauty of a novel. The ""English 101"" reviewer who ""had"" to see the movie for class has probably never done anything other than skate-board. Blaming his low grade on a movie sounds like a typical  spoiled lazy-boy cop-out. Forget him. Decide for yourself whether or not you like the movie and the novel. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1040169600,7,811,4.554794520547945
311877,5,6301065565,"I like to focus on videos and books dealing with Chicano Authors, Poets, culuture and issues! This is a magical tale of farm life in New Mexico, and how a town (well not really but you'll see what I mean when you watch it) challenges a major corporation. How one guy's mistake becomes the talk of the town. . . and how his mistake may have saved their homes!",1011830400,,358,4.202898550724638

311879,5,6301065565,"The music of this under-rated film was so moving I just had to have it. Like many Milagro Beanfield War fans I searched everywhere. Then I found it on a Dave Crusin album - ""Migration"" - done for BMG Direct Marketing Inc. The album number is D 116494. The address given for BMG on the CD case is 6550 East 30th Street, Indianapolis Indiana, 46219. The CD is from GRP Records, Inc., 555 West 57th Street, New York, NY, 10019. Their designation for this album is GRD-9592.
I am a resident of New Mexico and Milagro Beanfield War captures the heart and soul of this magnificent state. I just wish the producers and distributors of this film would wise up and put this magnificent work on DVD.",969494400,6,689,4.433070866141732

311881,5,6301065565,"I typed up a review and do not know if I sent it, so I will resubmit. The movie was fantastic. Robert Redford accomplished something no other Director has been able to do. He depicted New Mexicans as they really are.  I was born a Ohio State Buckeye but lived in Las Vegas, New Mexico from the  age of three until I was fifteen. My mother is Hispanic and my father  Anglo. My heart is New Mexican. I currently live in Columbus, Ohio but  travel to New Mexico as often as I can.  During my last three trips I have  tried to obtain the Music to the movie, but have only come up with versions  of some of the songs. The songs are truely New Mexican. This is the only  problem I have with the Movie. No available Sound track. Can anyone give me  information on how I can obtain the music to the film? Watching the movie  and listening to the music places me back in New Mexico when I am feeling  home sick. Once again, a fantastic film.",947030400,23,932,4.122222222222222
311882,5,6301065565,"A beautiful film on many levels.  As a former (and forever in my heart) New Mexican, I can say I've never seen a movie capture the people and landscape so truthfully.  Those big skies, the incredible hills, the  history...perfect.  And Ruben Blades is all dish.  See it if you want to  return to Northern New Mexico but lack the plane fare--it'll take you  there.
