5054652,5,B0074JOU8I,This video came wrapped in its original package & in great shape. It was fun to be able to watch this again. Brought back my high school days. I would highly recommend this vendor. It was received in a very timely matter.,1338249600,,221,4.285714285714286

5054666,1,B0074JOU8I,"It is one thing to sell a pretty basic blu-ray with no real features, it's another to put one out that is just a copy of the DVD, with no options to jump to scenes, etc.  They didn't even try for this one, unfortunately, and it's a shame.  This movie is a classic that adorns a lot of former and current wrestler's collections and it needs some TLC.  Touching up the picture would be quite welcome, and adding some thump to the soundtrack another.  You don't even have to make it surround sound-- just master it for the modern era and make the dialogue sit better in the mix.  Give that awesome soundtrack some much needed thump and life.  It sounds better on my turntable than it does on blu-ray, which is inexcusable.  I love this movie, but if you're thinking of upgrading your DVD to blu-ray, wait for them to put something out that is worth it.  This isn't.",1521072000,2,862,4.34375

5054700,5,B0074JOU8I,It is the greatest high school wrestling movie ever made. Loudin Swade is a wrestler desperate to drop weight to wrestle the toughest wrestler in the state. But his love of Carla may block his path. Will he get down on the mat? Or will he get down in bed? A must see for all ages..Rated R..,1497830400,2,290,4.105263157894737

5054702,5,B0074JOU8I,One of my all-time favorite movies. My DVD of it broke. So glad you had so I can replace it,1497657600,,91,3.6
5054703,4,B0074JOU8I,"Vision Quest focuses on Louden Swain (Matthew Modine), a member of his high school wrestling team, who has just turned 18. While his classmates are OK with just getting by, Louden decides to lose 23 pounds in order to take on the legendary Shute (Frank Jasper), the unbeaten state champion.

Vision Quest is a term from Indian folklore referring to the search for spiritual enlightenment, but Loudens concern is to win at any cost, even risking a college scholarship and endangering his health to gain the satisfaction of beating Shute. Louden receives moral support from Kuch (Michael Schoeffling), a friend on the wrestling team; Elmo (J.C. Quinn), a short order cook who dispenses philosophical advice; and Tanneran (Harold Sylvester), a teacher who realizes that his student is not just a jock with limited brain power. When Louden meets aspiring artist Carla (Linda Fiorentino), a slightly older woman, their respective goals are sidetracked by romantic involvement.

There are many movies about high school sports, but not many about wrestling. The film provides a portrait of the driven athlete just as his focus is distracted by other factors, in this case Ms. Fiorentino. Modine is excellent as Louden, conveying both self-assurance regarding his prowess on the mat and awkwardness in the art of seduction. The film boasts a great 1980s soundtrack, consisting of songs by Journey, Foreigner, John Waite, and Madonna who performs Gambler and Crazy for You.

There are no bonus materials on the widescreen Blu-ray release.",1497312000,,1529,5.2073170731707314

5054708,1,B0074JOU8I,"Vision Quest is my favorite movie, I have watched it too many times to count and it is definitely five stars. So when I heard that it was finally being released on Blu-Ray I immediately bought a copy. Imagine my disappointment when I got it, put it in the player only to find out that the only extras are two trailers. No commentary tracks, no other features of any kind. I wish somebody involved had done something, ANYTHING to make this Blu-Ray better than the copies I already had on DVD/iTunes.

Such a bummer. If you don't already own this movie, by all means buy it, the movie rules. If you already have it in another format this Blu-Ray is just a waste of money.",1495584000,2,669,4.352

But from the first time you see Louden Swain begin his pursuit of Brian (Appropriately named) Shute, racing across the working class town, overcoming his kicked-down beginnings with his hardworking single dad and harder luck love interest in a perfect Linda Firorentino to the tune of Journey's ""Only the Young,"" you're in 80's nostalgia ecstasy for a sport that never gets its due.

5054807,4,B0074JOU8I,"Offensive language and remarks throughout.  But otherwise a great movie.  Not for younger kids (under 15-16), but it was my biggest inspirational movie for wrestling when I grew up and my kids loved it for the storyline (someone willing to do anything to accomplish a dream that everyone else tells them they are crazy for trying), wrestling, and winning ending.",1412812800,,362,5.016666666666667
5054808,5,B0074JOU8I,"One of the best sports films of all time.  It is a twin to ""Rockie"" in reflecting the desire of some special athletes to attempt the impossible against all odds.

Wrestlers and other athletes will find great inspiration in the main character's training regimen.  This version is the letterbox version, which is superior to the earlier DVD release, which was cropped to fit old-school TV ratio.",1364083200,,322,5.4
5054832,5,B0074JOU8I,"There have been many, many great sports movies but none have focused on the tremendous sport of wrestling. This is a story of a young man's pursuit of his dream and the obstacle's he encounters along the way. Matthew Modine is amazing and Linda Fiorentino is a diamond. Two things I heard about this movie are, first, Modine did all his stunts including the wrestling and the peg-board. Let me tell you that is one tough thing to do.
Second, I heard many of the athletes in the movie were actual high school wrestlers. A true wrestling fan will be able to pick them out. Can you?
Great movie and an awesome soundtrack. Lunatic Fringe has always been and will always be a great workout song. 'I know you're out there'.",1356825600,4,717,4.480916030534351

8510052,4,B0074JOU8I,This is kind of one of those random classic 80s movies where nothing really makes sense or adds up though has a significant title and an interesting monologue at the end - doesnt really mesh with the movie much but thats ok because we like winners ......even if they're anorexic and get nose bleeds.
