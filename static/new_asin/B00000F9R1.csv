7907513,3,B00000F9R1,"Sunset Carson Rides Again, 1948 film

This color movie begins with a lone rider in a western desert. A man on foot wanders until he finds water. After he drinks he sees the sign ""poison spring"". [Minerals leached from the ground.] That rider finds and rescues him. There is a song about ""Prairie Winds"". This young man (the Kansas Kid) jumped off a train. The local school committee wants to build a school to educate people and build things up. We see that first letter. We learn about the crooks who are against education. There is talk about the school budget, and the need for growth. The foreman orders Bob Ward to go away. There is a fight for action. Foreman Murdock is thrown off the ranch. Sam Webster has a scheme. Can they raise the needed money from a boxing exhibition?

Murdock tries to sabotage this event. Sunset catches the runaway wagon. Can the show go on? There is a song ""Prairie Winds"" about happiness. Webster whips the pinto horse. ""Is that the man you wanted me to fight?"" ""No, that's him on the ground."" Can an amateur beat a professional? Bob Ward gets training, Sam Webster doesn't need it. Two men set up the boxing ring and provide a comic boxing match. Will Bob Ward be ready in time? Is he still affected by that poison water? There is music before the boxing match. The ""Rodeo Revelers"" play more music. Janet Carson likes the Kansas Kid. The fight begins. Saved by the bell! Bob Ward loses, Webster wins that pinto horse ""Comanche"". Does Comanche agree? The show raised enough money to build and run the school. [Is it that easy in the real world?] The sheriff and his deputies follow Sunset to the bank. Bob Ward says goodbye to Janet and gives her the letters.

Sam Webster intercepts these letters. [Could you guess the message?] Can Janet get a message to the Kansas Kid? Will the gang shoot Sunset and steal the school money? Will the sheriff act on Webster's suspicions? Can Sunset catch the real crooks, save his reputation, and recover the money needed to educate the area children? Can Webster blame Kansas for shooting Sunset? [Are there any loose ends?] Sunset rides up, there is a shoot-out, four against one. Can Kansas even the odds? Help arrives, Sunset chases the pair that got away. Will there be a fist fight to end the conflict? The last letter reveals the secret of John Ward's shooting, and how Webster got the money for his share of the ranch. Will there be a happy ending?

This is a barely average story that packs a lot of details into what is a murder mystery and a conflict over business ownership. The low budget absolves its faults. You don't even see any cattle on this movie ranch.",1287100800,,2646,4.552521008403361
7907514,5,B00000F9R1,"The films that Sunset Carson made for Yucca pictures are legendary for being less impressive than the films he made for Republic. This is the first Yucca film I've seen, but it's obvious that everything I'd read about Yucca was largely true. Sunset clearly had a lot less to work with than he did previously at Republic and this is a very cheaply made flick. Sunset Carson Rides Again has it's charm though. Sunset himself still shines. It's is a very low budget affair, but it is surprisingly fun for a cheaply made old cowboy picture. There's plenty to enjoy here if you are a fan of old low budget flicks like I am. The low budget only adds to the charm and you can't beat the price of the DVD. Rides Again definitely provides this low budget flick fan with FUN cheap thrills. I gotta love it!",1145232000,5,796,4.385135135135135
7907515,1,B00000F9R1,"A staggeringly corny work made with a miniscule budget, this is one of four westerns produced by deservedly little-known Yucca Pictures, and features glyphic Sunset Carson playing himself in his customary fashion, i.e., a discomposed delivery of dialogue when not sitting atop a horse - which he does with surety - the plot presenting Al Terry as Bob Ward (listed as Wade in the titular credits) seeking to avenge the murder of his father, apparently the work of the eponymous hero. Filmed in colour, uncommon for the period and genre, the movie is cumbered by pitiable production values, as well as possibly the most embarrassingly poor stunt work to be found in a professional effort, yet includes in its cast some capable character actors, including a winsome Pat Starling whose clear soprano graces a duet with Terry, and a viewer must be glad indeed that several musical novelty numbers are presented featuring gifted fiddler Buddy McDowell.",1110672000,7,946,5.07051282051282
