8242289,5,B0011TM23M,"Hi how are you my name is Paul I`am a former sparring partner from Toronto,Ontario Canada. I would just like to say when most people talk about the pugilistic Heavyweight champions in History the ones that are most mentioned are Louis and Ali . Mr. Joe Louis who had a perfect stance who went to the head and body, but had a lack of dancing ability, Ali on the other hand was strictly a head hunter with a great left jab ,who could dance back peddling or lateral movement but rarely ever went to the body. Then came Mr. Holmes who I believe was truly the real greatest Heavyweight champion ever period, make no mistake about it, this man is the total package of Louis and Ali. Mr. Holmes has every punch that there has ever been in boxing ,a defense that either he would slip the punches or parry, roll or deflect .He did not cover up and stay in a shell he would counter punch every time a opponent made a move on him example: David Bey. With a piston like jab that he would triple up on, a right cross that was like a laser beam so straight, a uppercut that would snap his opponents head back with regulararity just ask Shavers. Mr. Holmes was ducked by a lot of fighter in the mid 1970`s but he wouldn't` be denied Holmes had paid his dues By sparring hundred of rounds with Ali, and Frazier just to name a few and after winning the title from WBC Champion Kenny Norton in one of the greatest boxing matches ever, there was no stopping the ""Easton Assassin"" as champion 48-0-34 KO`s with twenty title defense over 7 1/2 years and in the top 5 of almost every category of boxing records this man cannot be denied his place in history is secure. After losing two controversy decisions to Undisputed Light Heavyweight Champion Michael Spinks When most so called experts said his career was over because of father time back in 1985, and again with almost two years off singing with the greats like the Temptations and Cool And The Gang and trying to make a quick come back in 2 to 4 months for 4 million dollars to box Mike Tyson the Champ could not shake off the ring rust in time ,so after Tyson 17 years younger won the match it seem like it was all over, and it would be time to say good bye. And now with some tune-ups under the Champions belt ,he was ready to challenge former WBO champion Ray Mercer who was striped of his title because of taken on Larry! ""Or Larry would of been the WBO Champion"" Now at 42 years of age Holmes wins, then challenges the Real Deal Holyfield 14 years younger ,again no one gave him a chance, Holmes loses a close fight by 40 punches on the computer punch stat. Holyfield couldn't even KO a almost 43 year old man. Holyfield in his prime ! sure he look alot better in beating a 42 year old Foreman, but look at the different of how Foreman was puffed up staggered more then once ,easily out punched ,the only thing that kept Foreman in that fight was his big heart. As champion and after in too Holmes late 40`s ,the age of his opponents were from 22 to 28 years old .The pride this man shows in the ring is amazing that`s what keeps this 51 to 52 year old boxing Legends Champion today in the ring with rematch's with Bonecrusher and Weaver and now his official retirement match of his career with Eric Esch ,where even at Larry's age against a 36 year old man he`s still has enough to give Butterbean a boxing lesson! Unheard of in this level of boxing history has there been a handy cap like this! And it`s not for money because he needs it. It`s about the ""Pride and Glory"" and this man deserves everything that a champion should receive. And a family man that has morals and stands up for him self in and out of the ring. Mr. Larry Holmes should be respected as a great heavyweight champion, in the history of heavyweight boxing there has never been two back to back champion like Ali and Holmes with very similar styles ! and for people who want to ignore Mr. Holmes greatness in the ring because Ali came first is crazy.""Example"":Elvis came before Tom Jones ""he Elvis did alot of things out side of singing, like movies, going to the army where Ali would not go to the army, but when it came down to singing on stage ,Tom Jones vocal ability carrying a note at the end of a song was way more powerful then Elvis"". And the same basically is the same for Legendary Mr. Larry Holmes.",1320192000,,4324,4.287286063569682
