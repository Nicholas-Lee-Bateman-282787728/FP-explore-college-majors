2666563,5,B000J3E3YC,I highly recommend Meet the Colors!  After watching this video for a couple of weeks my just-turned two-year-old daughter had her colors dialed in.  Preschool Prep's products are amazing for kids who want to learn!,1190073600,,214,5.085714285714285
2666564,5,B000J3E3YC,"Wow is this a great video! Horrible and mind numbing as an adult, but my 2 1/2 year old LOVES it! And before buying this video I thought she was color-blind. I could NOT get her to distinguish yellow from red. But after about a week of this video she knew her colors inside and out. This is a great learning tool and I highly recommend it. The adults may want to leave the room when it is on however!",1187568000,,400,4.0125
2666565,5,B000J3E3YC,"My 3 boys (a 4 year old and twin 22 month olds) love this movie so much and ask to watch it all the time, even though they already know their colors.  We have loved all of the preschool prep movies and books, but this is by far their favorite!",1187308800,,243,3.86
2666566,5,B000J3E3YC,My 2 year old learned his colors so fast I let it play constantly in the car on the dvd player. I recommend this for schools parents teachers love it love it love it,1186099200,,165,3.8823529411764706
2666567,5,B000J3E3YC,"My daughter LOVES this video, and it really did teach her the colors relatively quickly. She absolutely adores the little ""Black"" character and thinks the magic show is great. And now she points out colors everywhere we go.",1186012800,,223,4.894736842105263

2666569,5,B000J3E3YC,"The first video of the series I bought was meet the letters.  At first I thought this video was a total joke as it starts out saying ""A"" with the letter on the screne about 20 times.  I thought good grief I hope the whole video is not like this... and sure enough... it is.  But lo and behold my daughter has learned her entire abc's, upper and lowercase, from this video and she loves the repetetion.  Aneways, she was having trouble learning her colors... my husband and I were actually wondering if she was color blind!!!!  Since we had so much sucess with 'Meet the Letters' I bought her this one and within weeks she knows all her colors.  She also loves baby einsteins but is getting a little old for them (she's 2 1/2) but has not learned her numbers even though we have the baby einstein version of numbers.  She really learns from these videos!  When I have the extra cash, I will buy the other two videos to this series!",1180915200,,930,4.304597701149425

2666571,5,B000J3E3YC,"Our children learned their Letters, Numbers and Shapes from the other videos by this company so we didn't hesitate to buy Meet the Colors. It did not dissapoint! Our 18 month old daughter watched it once a day for about 2 weeks and could name all the colors easily. She is now so fascinated with colors that everyone she goes, she is pointing out anything and everything and telling me its color. I highly reccomend this and any other product from this company.",1174003200,9,461,4.566265060240964
2666572,5,B000J3E3YC,"my daughter (18 months) loved the vide; it is very well done, suited her attention span, and interesting for her age, on top of all that she learned the colors in less than a week.",1170720000,4,180,4.171428571428572

2666576,2,B000J3E3YC,My 2 year old was voted with this by the 2nd color. Guess this might be ok for kids under 1,1464825600,,91,3.380952380952381
2666577,5,B000J3E3YC,This is the second video in the series. First one I bought was the meet the shapes. My 2 year old loves these videos. I just bought the number and letter one as well. He never takes his eyes off the screen. He loves leap frog too but you just have to go basic when their young cause he won't pay attention the whole time. These videos are awesome for kids around 2 when their learning the basics! ;),1463961600,,399,4.063291139240507

2666582,5,B000J3E3YC,We've watched this series now with two children and it works! Both started identifying colors before the age of 2 within weeks of watching. I love these because they aren't long (maybe 20 minutes?) so I don't feel guilty about having my little one watch them. This is now our go-to gift for any toddler.,1458777600,,303,4.527272727272727

2666586,5,B000J3E3YC,"My ABC obsessed child loves this series! It is annoying for adults but the repetitiveness of the series taught both of my kids quickly. I have bought 2 different sets for our family and have bought multiple sets as gifts. I would definitely recommend this product and their whole series. Every video that my kids were exposed to, they learned the concept within a week or 2. Their videos Meet the Diagraphs and Meet the Blends taught me a lot and my kids teach others (even other adults) because of it. Buy it and use it. It takes little to no effort on the parents part but we had fun interacting as well.",1452470400,,606,4.371681415929204

2666590,5,B000J3E3YC,"After not having success in teaching my two year old son his colors, i decided to buy this. Im usually opposed to him watching tv but he 100% can indentify every color thanks to this video!",1446163200,,189,4.277777777777778
2666591,5,B000J3E3YC,This is a great buy. My daughter was having trouble with her colors and after watching this was able to name and identify them all. It is not overwhelming or too busy.,1445904000,,167,4.25
2666592,5,B000J3E3YC,"Because of so many mixed reviews, I rented the video first to see how my 26 month old would respond to it. Well the first couple of days, she would only watch the first 10 mins then she wanted nothing more to do with it (which made me very happy that I rented instead of buying). Day 3 of the 7 day rental, my daughter begin asking to watch ""colors"".
The video really helped to reinforce her learning. She made such great progress by the end of the 7 day rental that I bought the video.
Like many other reviewers stated, the video is a little slow & if your toddler is use to watching more entertaining videos with a little more action, it may not hold his/her attention that well in the beginning. But I say keep trying because it can be very effective. I really wish I had found this when she was 10-12 months old, before she became use to more detailed story lines. Very pleased & would highly recommend!",1444867200,,907,4.2485549132947975

2666594,5,B000J3E3YC,"OMG - I couldn't have imagined how much my 2 year old son would love this video.  For the adult/parent who watches it - it is soooooooo incredibly boring and repetitive (yellllll-ow,yellow, yell-oooooooow, yellow, yellow, yellllll-ooooow).... but my son absolutely goes nuts for it.  Consequently - he knows all his colors.  We've also watched the Letters, Numbers, and Sight Words videos, but this one is still his favorite.  We've had it for about a year, and occasionally, he would watch it for a few minutes here and there.... but since he turned 2, he asks for it almost daily.",1443744000,,582,4.848484848484849

2666597,5,B000J3E3YC,"Brilliant. Follows the formula of all the ""Meet the"" videos.  The only word spoken is the word being taught.  After the color appears on screen there is about a two second delay before the word is spoken, giving the child an opportunity to think the word and maybe say it. After watching these videos many times I use the same techniques when teaching my kids something and it works. Moves at a very slow pace and leaves them in a relaxed state, almost hypnotic.  These Meet the videos looked very dull to me at first but I appreciate them now. Keeps my children's attention 100% and effectively teaches.",1433721600,,604,4.574074074074074
2666598,5,B000J3E3YC,I have used preschool prep before and was really happy to get again.  Perfect condition for a used DVD. My older child knew all the colors before he started  2K preschool!  Great DVD,1433289600,,182,4.454545454545454

2666600,3,B000J3E3YC,Videos are decent. VERY VERY annoying for parents though because they repeat everything at least 10x! UGhhhh.. My little one enjoys watching them to a certain extend. I think he gets annoyed and bored too. Idk if I would purchase more.,1431993600,,235,4.7560975609756095

2666608,5,B000J3E3YC,To me it was more easier for my son to learn his colors by the colors repeating themselves. Soon as I ordered the DVD it was there instantly. This DVD only took two weeks for my 3 year old to memorize all the colors.,1422144000,,216,3.9318181818181817

My son has learned a great deal with this video and all the videos from Kathy Oxley. It's repetitive and the characters are so darn cute. I have rented about 4 of them already and I will continue to until my son learns the whole program. A must have, from one parent to another. Trust me you won't be disappointed.",1387497600,,422,3.976470588235294

2666628,2,B000J3E3YC,"I was really excited to buy Meet the Colors because my 16 month old daughter is obsessed with colors right now.  I saw a preview of it and I could understand why it has won so many awards: it mimics what we do all the time, by pointing out stuff that is each color, and saying only the color name (which avoids confusion).  It is slow paced, so there are probably not the same TV issues that some other programs have.  Sure, it may be annoying to listen to, and I was prepared for that, but as parents we can handle minor annoyances for the sake of enriching our kids' learning experiences.  So many reviewers talk about their kids loving these programs, so I was excited to let my daughter watch it.

Yeahhhhh, so much for that.  My daughter is totally bored by it.  She rarely watches any media, so it's not that she's used to more stimulation from TV, either. The first time she watched this she got about halfway through.  We've tried to get her to watch it a few more times since then, and she won't sit for it for more than a couple minutes.  It is kind of pathetic watching her try to watch it, even.  She yawns a lot, and then starts looking around for something else, and then she starts to close my computer.  I'm done trying to get her to watch it.  If she is so uninterested in this program, I don't think I should push it.

Instead, we're doing basically the same thing in real life: pointing stuff out that is different colors, and talking about it. So far she LOVES yellow, she knows blue, green, red, and purple, and sometimes she knows pink and orange.  That's good enough for a 16 month old baby, anyway, and I'm sure as we continue talking about colors she will continue to get better and better with them.  She talks about colors ALL DAY every day right now, as she is constantly pointing them out everywhere, and also pointing out plaid, stripes, and dots, so we'll get there.

I don't know why I kind of hoped she could just watch a little TV program and learn them all instantly.  It's not so bad to be personally involved in her learning.  It's kind of fun to help her figure things out.

So, the best thing about this movie for us is that it helped me decide not to spend any money on the other similar shows (I was thinking about doing lowercase letters and phonics, plus Spanish ones).  It's not terrible, but it is very boring, and I can't in good conscious pressure my baby to watch more tv than she is interested in.",1382659200,4,2446,4.299126637554585

Every color is gone over at lease 20-30 times so it goes like this red,red,red,red,red,red,red, x 30 yellow x30, and so on. That is the only reason I gave it 4 stars after all it's not for us to like,but it is for us to use as a teaching tool, but my toddler,1st grader who knows all of her colors of course, and I love rock and learn colors,shapes,and counting. And it makes more sense than this DVD. But over all this is a great DVD to introduce colors. Keep in mind toddlers have short attention spans so being repetitious is a good thing because they learn by repetition.",1361923200,,676,4.416

2666648,5,B000J3E3YC,"This video is wonderful. I started my 16 month old on it only 4 days ago and already he identifies ""yellow"" and ""blue."" I had been working with him on colors since he was 11 months old and nothing has stuck. Something about these little fuzzy characters gets him excited as soon as he sees them and he responds with a HUGE smile and often repeats what the video is saying. I am already ordering ""Shapes"" and getting to work on that.

In case you're interested in WHAT the video is, it is very simple. A yellow screen pops up and a woman says ""yellow"" repeatedly and then a yellow fuzzball walks out and just says ""yellow"" over and over again. It continues like this throughout all the basic colors, including white, black, and purple. The video is LONG (about 40 minutes I think) so my son does tend to lose interest before it is finished, but he is only 16 months old and it manages to keep his attention for a full cycle of the colors and then some (more than half the video). I've heard a lot of parents complain that it is ""too repetitive"" and ""annoying""  but I don't think you should allow that review to make your decision. Unfortunately, if you want your kid to learn... repetition is how you do it! Obviously I'd rather listen to something with a storyline, but I'm 30. For the demographic, it's perfect, and it's actually very easy to tune out.

Also, I rented it on Amazon instant video for $1.99 (I am a Prime member, it might be more if you don't have Prime) and we watched it before I went out and bought it. They have most (if not all) of the Preschool Prep videos up there to rent in case you want to check it out first.

My 2 year old was amused for a few minutes and then he began to get a bit creeped out and did not much appreciate the fact that these fuzzy little creatures walked around just saying their color names.  So, under 2 years old and a kiddo might like it but over 2?  No way.",1268352000,,541,4.223300970873787
2666656,3,B000J3E3YC,"When I first put the DVD in and pressed play the first images that came up made my 17 month-old daughter scream with joy. She seemed very excited and sat happily to watch the rest. What followed was simply bizarre. I left the room to check on dinner and all I heard from the living room was a woman's voice saying ""yellow,yellow,yellow,yellow,yellow,yellow,yellow,yellow,yellow,yellow,yellow,yellow,yellow,yellow,yellow,yellow,yellow,yellow,yellow,yellow,yellow,yellow,yellow,yellow,yellow."" I went back in to check on her and sit with her and I watched a little more of it before my daughter looked at me like I've gone crazy for making her sit through this. The screen featured a little ""creature"" in the color she was meant to learn and the overall colors on the screen were dominated by that same color. There was some animation and ""activity"" going on but not much. Someone mentioned in his review that it's basically ""brainwashing"" and it certainly does feel like that.

However, this is not meant for parents who think they can use shortcuts through DVDs to take their place and teach their children something. This is just another tool in your arsenal (mixed metaphor?). Use it like a tool and it's good, use it like a substitute for parenting and it's nothing more than brainwashing. I took my daughter to the park after the DVD (the next day) and she immediately went up to the disabled parking spots (the ones marked with the blue handicapped sign on the ground) and she pointed to the blue lines and said something like ""boo"" (I'm assuming meant to be ""blue""). But this isn't a direct result of the DVD only. I've been working with her for a while through books, clothes, pictures, signs on the street and the rest. Whenever we see letters I read them to her, numbers I count for her, colors I teach to her. This DVD is good for clearing up the confusion when I say ""Blue A"" if she points at her bathtub letters where there's a letter A in blue. It will help differentiate the distinction between which part is ""blue"" and which part is ""A.""

So, yes, it does seem like brainwashing(and it made me dream of a lady saying the names of colors repetitively, which was annoying) but as another tool in the box I like it. I do, however, think they could have added more animation and music to it to make interesting. While she sits there watching she might be learning something but it doesn't capture her interest enough to want to sit through much of it.",1268265600,2,2462,4.776995305164319

The more we watched the video together, the more enjoyable the experience. Shame on those who allow DVDs to ""babysit"".

I'm about to order the sight words, as I don't know how long he can keep this up, but it's AMAZING.

I was a bit discouraged to read the DVD was boring; after all, my son didn't make it through 30 minutes of Wall-E due to sheer boredom (he never showed any interest in Baby Einstein either). His problem is that he fixates on the objects, and I hoped the sheer repetition of color names would help him overcome that.

After only 3 viewings, he was able to name all the colors. I am amazed at how successful the DVD was for him! We're still working on using color names with familiar objects, but I think the cute cartoon characters really help him.

For example, the fuzzy yellow thing comes on and you hear ""yellow, yellow . . . yellow, yellow, yellow . . .  yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow . . . yellow, yellow."" Repeat with blue, black, white, green, etc. It eventually robs you of your will to live.

Boy, was I pleasantly surprised!!  My 19 month old son learned his colors in a few weeks and now enjoys pointing them out and saying them wherever we are.  I also bought ""Meet the Shapes"" and ""Meet the Numbers"".  The shapes take a little longer in my opinion as there are some very large words for a toddler like ""rectangle"" and ""octagon""; but make no mistake...my son tries to say them and is recognizing at least 4 of the shapes now instantly.  My only complaint about the ""Colors"" video is that there is no teaching about the color brown so when my son sees something brown, he calls it black.  I am trying to teach him the difference between brown and black with crayons and other items.

P.S....Some parents commented and how ""mind-blowing"" it is for parents to watch this video and there is some truth in that.  The video repeats the names of the colors what seems to be a million times.  However, I happily ignore it because I am so thrilled with how quickly my child is learning.

There is nothing in this video that could remotely be called over-stimulating.  This video is probably more sedate than regular playing in the living room. I can't stand to sit through it.

And yet, my 16 month old son loves it.  He asks for this video by name--""Coh!  Coh! [meaning Colors! Colors!]""  He loves to call out the names of the colors when they slowly walk onto the screen.

My youngest son has special needs & mainly uses sign language as a form of communication.  My son can learn all sorts of things from these videos that he was unable to learn in preshcool.  With just days of ""Meet the Numbers"" he knew several numbers and with 2 weeks of ""Meet the Letters"" he was able to name many letters on the cover of Meet the Numbers.  This is a big deal because just saying words clear enough for us to understand is hard yet he was able to say these things.  I even consider somewhat of a speech therapy while he does the video because he talks along with them.  With the simple & repetitive style it is very easy to pick up and they associate the characters with what they are leraning and are able to generatlize it into every day activities.

I have recommended these videos to all of my friends and family members. In order for the videos to work, the kids must watch them often. She watched them in the morning on the way to daycare and in the afternoon when i picked her up. My daughter was reading at three years. She tested into the gifted preschool program at three and is now going to the fifth grade. She has been a straight ""A"" student since she started receiving letter grades. I credit this to the early intervention using the Preschool Prep DVDs. So if you are thinking about purchasing these for your toddler/preschooler, take my advice, it's well worth the money. It's ten years later and I am ordering a set for my great niece who is turning one year old in August.",1500163200,,1290,4.540772532188841

8148870,4,B000J3E3YC,"I bought this along with the Meet the Numbers and colors DVDs for my 4 year old prek class. Definitely too babyish for most of them, however I notice my ESL students who don't speak as much English stayed more interested.  It's very repetitive and just didn't keep the kids' interest.",1475884800,,284,4.568627450980392
