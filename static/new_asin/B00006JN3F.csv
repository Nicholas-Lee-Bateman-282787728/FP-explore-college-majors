8512281,5,B00006JN3F,"This video is a great way for everyone to learn to use the spine corrector.  Three levels -- beginning, intermediate & advanced -- are demonstrated continuously throughout the entire video.  Master Teacher Kathy Corey admirably leads this well-balanced total body workout, which personifies the modern, dance-based approach to Pilates pioneered by Ron Fletcher.  It's by far the best and most diverse spine corrector video that I've seen.",1066089600,3,438,5.507462686567164
