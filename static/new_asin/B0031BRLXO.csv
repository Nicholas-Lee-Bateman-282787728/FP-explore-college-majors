8424815,5,B0031BRLXO,I bought this video because I know Andy James is an amazing instructor.  After that I started reading a review for another Andy James video (Yngwie Malmsteen)in the review  the guys was complaining about Andys english accent and that there where no tabs etc etc.  I got a little nervous about that BUT! when I received the video and put it on I started learning automatically.  I haven't finish the whole lessons because I believe that you need to master each lick before moving forward.  Ive learned AMAZING licks so far and the way Andy teaches is clear and smart.  I will go for the Nuno Bettencourt after this one and then Steve Vai,1288742400,5,636,4.535087719298246
