3849927,5,B0025X4POM,"I discovered these wonderful nursery rhymes when my son was about 17 months.  He instantly loved watching them because he loved seeing the children dance around, play and have fun to the music.  It has taught him many of the songs as well as words for objects.  Great fun for toddlers and a wonderful for way for parents to refresh on the old favorites!",1254009600,6,353,4.484375
3849938,3,B0025X4POM,"The songs on the first disc are great, and the kids engaging. However, although I selected Play All, after each song, the DVD goes to this beginning sequence ""Baby Boost Nursery Rhymes"" and ""select on demand"" ad slide. My granddaughter says ""all done"" every time. The actual songs are lots of fun and we dance and sing. It is very Annoying to have this interrupted.",1321228800,,365,4.630769230769231
3849939,5,B0025X4POM,"My 1.5 year old daughter first heard these songs on-demand in like 3 minute segments. We were worried they would be taken off on-demand, so we searched for the DVD. She watched this over and over until she could sing the song. She's 2.5 now and still will sing the song or ask to see the video. It's great for a young child because the songs are repetative, teach counting, shapes, colors, and shows children's faces.",1320192000,,417,4.5
3849940,5,B0025X4POM,My son loves this DVD and asks to watch it all the time! I enjoy that he watches other children sing along to the songs. The children act out most of the songs which has helped reinforce those skills for him.,1319068800,,208,4.097560975609756
3849941,5,B0025X4POM,"This 2-DVD set comes as indicated with the baby Boost Nursery ryhymes DVD which contains 48 nursery rhymes sang by kids and the extra DVD with 20 songs on shapes and colors, also sang by kids.

My son loves his ""DV-DV"" and asks for it over and over again. He loves to hear his songs (itsy bitsy spider, abcd, etc.), see the kids singing and playing, and the cartoons of the ""videos""; he sings along and ""dances"". He's 26 mo now, and the only way he would have quiet time (and a nap) when he's home during the day would be with it. he likes the 2nd Cd a little less, maybe because it's not such well-known song (i.e. they're not sang at school/day-care).

I'm glad I made this purchase.",1297296000,4,685,4.2615384615384615
3849942,5,B0025X4POM,this DVD was just what we wanted! Real children singing classic nursery ryhmes! It kept my 2 yr olds attention and she was singing and dancing along.,1288828800,,149,4.555555555555555
3849943,3,B0025X4POM,"I love the nursery songs dvd... and my daughter does too, but the other disk is not her thing yet... maybe when she is older? Also between EVERY song is a break that says something along the lines of ""made for on demand""... yes we get it! My daughter is not very patient so every time it does it she thinks it's over and kinda fusses. It gets annoying!",1287532800,,352,4.115942028985507
3849944,5,B0025X4POM,"Wonderful, traditional nursery rhymes.  My one year old grandaugter has loved this since she was 4 months old!  I tracked it down on Amazon and we are absolutely, positively pleased.  She is at the stage where she wants to run away and get chased before a diaper change. Baby Boost keeps her totally mesmerized and happily clapping her hands when I play the DVD for the few minutes that I'm changing her.  She loves it at any time, but I like it for the diaper changes!  It does not matter that there are ads after every other song, the babies don't seem to mind -- its for babies and children -- not for adults.",1278288000,2,612,4.333333333333333
3849945,5,B0025X4POM,"My baby at one year loves this. The promos for the DVD that are inserted are her favorite part, if a little annoying to adults. The sing-a-long is really educational, almost to a fault (what baby needs to know about odd numbers?), but baby loves the circle song, really all of them. Well done.",1274313600,,293,4.444444444444445
3849946,3,B0025X4POM,We just received this in the mail yest and I instantly opened it up to see what it was like and if my daughter (7 months old) would enjoy it. She definately had her eye on it here and there which was a plus but the BINGO song stops at N. That doesnt make a bit of sense to me. Other than that I also didn't care much for the Baby Boost direct tv announcement after every song! Not to mention there is no organization with the kids in the songs. Its pretty much do what you want and its not at all what I personally expected. Ive never seen Baby Boost before this. Depending on how much I can tolerate it being on will determine if she watches it alot. If not I will go with another Nursery Rhymes dvd because Im not too satisfied with this one. I gave it 3 stars to give it a chance and see if my daughter enjoys it. I am hoping not.,1266537600,,833,3.9058823529411764
3849947,5,B0025X4POM,"I bought this set for my 2 year old grandson, he has loved Baby Boost since we started watching it on Comcast. I would have bought this regardless of any negative reviews, because he is so enamored with Baby Boost. My biggest disappointment was that the description for the DVD does not list that this contains 20 Sing-A-Longs as the other DVD. It simply lists it contains 48 songs. I bought the set and then also bought the sing-a-long DVD in addition, not knowing that is was part of the set! In either case, my grandson and I love all of the Baby Boost songs, music, I wish I could find some of the other ones we watch on Comcast, about body parts, picking up toys, etc.  We love watching and singing to all of the songs!",1264464000,9,724,4.2846715328467155
8351363,5,B0025X4POM,A good dvd for kids,1414454400,,19,3.0
8351364,5,B0025X4POM,The grandkids and their friends have enjoyed this from before age 1. It is lively and energetic. A good way to get out excess energy.,1392940800,,133,4.36
8351365,5,B0025X4POM,"sing a long with you kid, is one of the best experience ever. I hightly recommend, give it a try you won't regret it",1359590400,,116,3.875
8351366,5,B0025X4POM,My granddaughter (2 yr 5 months) & I loved this DVD set.  She really enjoyed the songs & the kid involvement.  I even remembered a lot of these songs from when I was a kid! I encourage any grandparent or parent to get these for your child/grandchild.,1358726400,,250,4.297872340425532
8351367,5,B0025X4POM,great christmas gift for a little girl.  Why do your reviews have to be a certain size?  Isn't it suppose to be our words not yours?,1356825600,,132,4.038461538461538
8351368,5,B0025X4POM,"My son loves watching these shows on demand Comcast. He has been watching them and dancing along with them since he was standing. They are kind of cheesy, but kids love these shows and songs.",1355875200,,191,4.485714285714286
8351369,1,B0025X4POM,"My grandson who is 5 likes the ""song"" DVD, but the ""nursery rhyme"" one is awful.  After every 2 songs it goes back to the beginning and has something like a commercial and says it was recorded for on demand tv.  I do not recommend this purchase at all.",1351296000,,252,4.122448979591836
8351370,5,B0025X4POM,My son is autistic and his younger brother is not.  Both stay glued to the tv while the video plays.  My autistic son has very limited speech but learns very easily through song.  He is able to sing all the songs on the sing-a-long dvd and loves them!  He has learned a lot from the video.  The nursery rhyme did not go over as well but maybe as they get older they will like it more.  I purchased for the sing-a-long dvd.,1348358400,,422,4.085365853658536
8351371,1,B0025X4POM,Awful videos.  I didn't believe previous reviewers about how annoying the company logo interjections were.  Should have listened. Kids have no interest in watching this video. They watch it for a good 2 minutes.  Haven't openned the case since.  Total waste of money.,1335830400,,267,5.1395348837209305
8351372,4,B0025X4POM,"it is nice, but not the best. i was looking more for something like the app sing sing together. if somebody knows a dvd like that, let me know. thanks!",1323475200,,151,4.066666666666666
