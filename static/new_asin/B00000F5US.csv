1203930,3,B00000F5US,"The Battle of Russia is a documentary film covering the Soviet war with Germany from 1941 to early 1943. It was produced during the world war two, hence the cut off date at 1943. Having been made with the taxpayer dollar it is now in the public domain, and many companies are reproducing it and selling in VHS and DVD form. My review will look first at this particular version of the movie with its physical reproduction of the film, later at the film's contents.

 I will start with the packaging. The box front has photos of a US soldier with frost on his face, US troops marching, and another American soldier having a chow. On the back - a British AA gun being manned by British soldiers. That is right - all photos that are not consistent with the contents of the movie - Soviet German war. This foreshadowed the effort put in by ""Goodtimes"" into its product.

 Special Features: none. Scene index is present, however.

 Reproduction quality: At the beginning of the film there is a note by ""Goodtimes"" about how they carefully restored the original. Unfortunately, this ended up being an ironic statement. Frames are darker. This is an issue as in a number of places the details are deteriorated because of this. The sides and the bottom of the movie are truncated. It was noticeable as I played my VHS simultaneously with the DVD to compare the two. This was a disappointment, as I wanted to upgrade my VHS copy of this film. Overall, the VHS version, recorded in EP mode, outstripped this DVD in quality. I will be looking for another DVD version of this film.

 Movie's contents: The film covers battles of the Eastern Front in chronological order, incorporating into the script social and political topics. A little observation I made through the years is that documentary movies during the cold war relied heavily on this film's footage along with the German newsreels when covering the Eastern Front. Peter Batty's ""German Invasion of the Soviet Union"" went as far as taking the animated maps from this movie wholesale.

The footage used in Battle for Russia is not raw, but rather tape cut into segments most of which are less than five seconds. This is an unfortunate, yet common practice in documentary films. The documentary has scenes of prewar Soviet films, namely Ivan Grozny, Aleksandr Nevsky, Man with a Movie Camera (documentary), and the parade and maneuvers footage (documentary). Wartime footage presented in the film is good. It can be complemented, with some overlapping, by ""Soviet Secret Archives: The Russian Front""(3 parts), Russia: ""Blood Upon the Snow"", or ""War of the Century: When Hitler Fought Stalin"" film series.

Some reviewers referred to this film as outdated; with a notion that now, we know the truth. I respectfully disagree with this. We still have a lot of appeasement in World War II history. There seems to be a lot of material out on the Soviet German Front, but if we filter for primary sources such as diaries, journals, and wartime operative documents, not that much is left. I find that facts happen at lower level, and pompous numbers and ""facts"" mean nothing we do not know (or care) how they were compiled/where they are coming from. This movie is the pro-Allies American view circa world war two. I keep this film on my bookshelf and enjoy the footage analysis it presents.

Four stars for the movie contents.

One star for this version of the DVD.",1100304000,17,3405,4.762308998302207
1203931,5,B00000F5US,"The first five volumes in Frank Capra's celebrated ""Why We Fight"" series focused on Hitler's Nazis overrunning Europe in the first half of World War II. The final two volumes shift the focus to the Pacific Theater and those are what we have collected on this DVD.  ""The Battle of China: The Assault on the Great Wall"" looks at the Chinese defense against Japanese aggression. Like the previous chapter, ""The Battle of Russia,"" an important part of the intent here is to establish a sense of identification between the American people with a foreign ally.  Fortunately Capra does not have to gloss over the political ideology of the Chinese the same way he did with the Communist Soviets.
This explains why ""The Battle of China"" provides a brief history of China and its people and then details why the Japanese wanted to conquer the country, namely getting the raw materials and slave labor necessary for taking over all of Asia. The War in the Pacific covered, showing the valiant effort by the Chinese to stop the Japanese. Also featured are General Claire Lee Chennault's famous Flying Tigers, the American Volunteer Group who had joined the battle to defend China. This 67-minute black & white 1944 documentary is narrated by writer Anthony Veiller (Walter Houston just does the voice of Abraham Lincoln this time) and Anatole Litvak served as an uncredited co-director. In the next volume, ""War Comes to America,"" the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brings the United States into the war.
""War Comes to America"" is the seventh and final episode in the celebrated ""Why We Fight Series.""  Anatole Litvak was the uncredited co-director of this chapter, with music by Alfred Newman, and actors Walter Huston and Lloyd Nolan provided the narration for this 67-minute black & white documentary produced in 1945 as the war was ending. This final installment celebrates the good qualities of the United States and establishes those things worth fighting for. ""War Comes to America"" also looks at the history of the United States and traces how the shifting opinion of the public towards supporting the Allies against the Axis forces was clearly shifting in that direction when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. As such the film presents the mood of the American people on the eve of World War II and how the isolationist position changed in reaction to the aggressive policies of the Axis powers (a.k.a. ""Death, Inc."") as traced in a revealing series of Gallup Polls. There is also a summary of Japanese aggression from the invasion of Manchuria to Pearl Harbor.
This particular chapter is one of the most interesting because Capra is going out of his way to present America as an inclusive society when Hungarians, Portuguese, American Negroes and Chinamen all work together, although it is interesting that the first two are shown more often and more progressively than the latter pair. Even Germans and Italians are included in the mix, but not the Japanese, which is not surprising given the internment camps in California (which were actually called concentration amps at the time). But we do see an indictment of activities of the German American Bund as well. The perspective here is decidedly liberal, seeing the U.S.A. as a nation proud of having trade unions and capable of correcting mistakes like Prohibition. While covering December 7, 1941, the day that ""will live in infamy,"" Capra ends with the uplifting music of Gershwin's ""Rhapsody in Blue"" and the idea of an inevitable Allied victory.
Capra served as a major in the U.S. Army Signal Corps and was commissioned by Army Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall to make a series of films that would explain the government's policy to the troops hastily being assembled, trained, and sent overseas. The ""Why We Fight"" series is the supreme example of propaganda put out by the U.S. government during World War II. Eventually the ""Why We Fight"" series was shown to the public in theaters. At the end of the war Capra also made a pair of films for the occupation forces, ""Your Job in Germany"" and ""Know Your Enemy: Japan.""  In 2000 the ""Why We Fight"" series was added to the Library of Congress National Film Registry and remains a prime source of archival footage for the period.",1086393600,7,4245,4.908077994428969
1203932,1,B00000F5US,"Ok, the topic is great... the Soviet repulsion of the Nazi military might.  But the war-time propaganda, the lack of depth of the ""documentary"", the missing facts, and the poor quality of the film make this a horrific failure when one considers the title.
I don't care if this is a known propaganda film used for recruiting in the United States during WWII... it simply has no social context sixty years later.  Shouldn't we be concerned with the facts of the Nazi siege and the Soviet repulsion as they relate to a deeper understanding about the two nations of the 20th century that produced the worst dictators (Hitler and Stalin)?
Consider the following facts:
1)  There was a major event in the 20th century, commonly referred to as ""World War II"", when most of the nations of the world were at war.
2)  During that event Nazi Germany terrorized all of Europe (and especially the Soviet Union), through their military might and demonic plans (the Holocaust).
3)  The Nazi's invaded the Soviet Union in 1941.
4)  The Soviet Union repulsed the Nazi invasion.
I would guess that the mentally ill and the recently born make up the vast majority of the population that isn't aware of the above-mentioned facts.  This movie is for them.",1035849600,5,1234,4.738317757009346
1203933,4,B00000F5US,"Before viewing this film one should be historically aware of the circumstnces surrounding the reasons for its production. It is part of the ""Why we fight"" series that was shown to new recruits that were about to become part of this tremendous worldwide conflict. This is truly a propaganda film that was intended to show our ""allies"", the communist Russians, in a favorable light. The intent was to instill a purpose into these recruits that we were fighting an evil force, the Nazi Germans, together with the Russians. Anybody who is historically educated in this time period realizes that the United States government no doubt realized the horrors that Joseph Stalin himself was capable of. But to attempt to rally the recruits by villianizing our allies would not serve well, therefore kind portrayal of the communists was essential. Although the awful behavior of the German invaders is documented here, there is no mention of the atrocities committed by the Russians on their German captives.

1204075,5,B00000F5US,"With the resurgence of fascism in our time, it is heartening to have films like this which remind us of the inevitable defeat of fascism and colonialism by Russia.

Moreover, Kapra captures the horror of the fascist menace with the full art of patriotic cinema. As one watches this film, which was made before the Battle of Kursk, I would like to offer a reflection for him to meditate upon:

In 1945, at the great victory parade in Moscow, the standards and the flags of the Reich were paraded by triumphant Red Army soldiers wearing white gloves. These symbols of reprobate evil were tossed into a pile where they were set alight. As they burned, the Red Army heroes who had paraded with them took off the white gloves and cast them into the fire, for they were defiled by contact with the symbols of NAZI evil.

One day soon, blue and yellow flags and banderofascist tridents will meet a similar fate.",1454371200,,904,4.567901234567901

It is interesting that they credit the movement of the Siberians to the German front for the relief of Stalingrad, but not Moscow the year before.  I wonder if that reflects on misinformation at the time (not wanting to admit that the USSR knew about the Japanese plans long before the attack) or the US not knowing in 1943, Also a little odd to hear the description of the USSR when it was an ally.

1204083,5,B00000F5US,"This propagandist war movie, made by Frank Capra in 1943, at the request of the US War Department, has a lot of problems. First, it is dated.  More recent research says that Russia won in Stalingrad because (1) their soldiers had slightly better winter clothing, (2) Russia had developed some kind of antibiotic to protect its soldiers, which the Germans didn't have, (3) the German strategy of bombing Stalingrad before its soldiers entered, instead worked to Russia's advantage.  Subsequent bombing by the Luftwaffe sent the blast force upward, instead of sideways against Russian soldiers.  This allowed Russian soldiers to use the walls as cover while they shot Germans.

The film is somewhat weak on both armies' strategies, and on giving an overall perspective on the conflict.  Instead it spends a lot of time on closeups, and on emotion.  This has to be expected in a propaganda film in the middle of a war.

I give the film 5-stars because Americans are so ignorant of World War 2, and because the film establishes, correctly, that Russia defeated the German eastern flank, and was well on the way to defeating the entire German war machine, over a year before D-day in June, 1944.  Americans and most Europeans don't realize this, and incorrectly give the US credit for ""winning"" World War 2. Seeing this film will help them understand.",1434758400,3,1346,4.924778761061947

Blatantly
disingenuous, it never mentions Communism, implies that Russians were deeply religious and filled their churches to the rafters, and explains Soviet military failures when the Germans invaded as clever planning intended to draw the Germans into self-destructive house-to-house, room-to-room fighting.

The Scorched Earth policy used by the people and the degradation and mutilations by the German is included. Not mentioned is the political situation imposed by Stalin . . . his murder of the majority of military officers, the draft of people for the military and the threat of death for those who would retreat. A German bullet for those who went forward and a Russian bullet for those who retreated. Few people outside the USSR knew the truth at this time in history.

1204315,5,B00000F5US,"One of the sad things about the Cold War is how much it has inflated the role of the West in beating Nazi Germany while ignoring the truth. As a consequence of this distortion, most people now think that America alone won the war against Germany and that D-Day was a decisive blow to Nazi Germany when, really, the hardest blows had already fallen in the East.

Now that's established, it is easier to see what makes this documentary so special. Filmed by director Frank Capra (who also did&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-s-a-Wonderful-Life/dp/B000HEWEJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It's a Wonderful Life</a>), this is a propaganda movie with a twist. Unlike so many 1950's 'Red Menace' US propaganda films, this film is a homage to the indomitable spirit of Russia and heaps lavish praise on Russia's war efforts. Without a hint of irony or reticence, the film salutes Russia and its people while speaking fondly of its size (three times that of the USA), its resources and its efforts in the war (e.g. quote from the film's start ""The scale and grandeur of the Russian effort mark it as the greatest military achievement in all history"" - General Douglas MacArthur).

Of course, there are few mentions of Stalin and even fewer about communism. Like all good propaganda films, it stretches the truth to the downright ludicrous, such as talking about Russians being ""a free and united people"" and ""men of God praying for victory"" (forgetting that Stalin's Russia was just as bad as Hitler's Germany). There are also moments of silliness, such as a triumphalist cavalry charge to ward off the mechanized Wehrmacht and obviously fake Soviet propaganda reels of what happened in various battles.

However, generally the film stays within the bounds of truth, with an interesting back-story about other invasions of Russia and an overview of all the different peoples of the USSR.

The film explores the battle in Russia in two parts - one leading up to the Battle of Moscow, and the second part leading to the Battle of Stalingrad. Curiously the film was shot in 1943, just before the decisive battle of Kursk, which saw the German's finally sent into head-long retreat. As a result, it displays the Russian spirit at its toughest and most enduring before it became almost a straight-forward march to Berlin.

So, if you're after a film which tells you the truth about the battle with Nazi Germany then this is one of the best candidates (though it is quite ironic to find truth in a propaganda film). If this doesn't suit though, then the only other place I can suggest is the excellent series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-World-at-War/dp/B0002F6AH0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The World at War</a>, which correctly puts Russia centre-stage as the place where the Nazis were humbled.",1303084800,5,2876,5.298245614035087

In this video the War Department clearly wants Americans to like the Chinese, even though less than 20 years earlier, in the 1920s, we had immigration policies that limited and even excluded Chinese immigrants and denied them citizenship because otherwise they would alter the ""look"" of what was then considered the ""All-American"" citizenship.  Our only reason for waging war against the Japanese was to keep trade route open in the Pacific; retaliation for Pearl Harbor was the ruse.

The Japanese are seen as the evil people.  The verbage alone shows the obvious slant here.  They are ""fanatic Japs.""  The idea is clear:  make the Chinese to be the hard-working, peaceful people so that we can justify war with the Japanese, a nation that for decades prior to WWII wanted mainland China for its natural resources.

Walter Huston narrates at a less frantic pace than in other films in this series. There is some fascinating footage of tribesmen who lived in the spacious reaches of the Soviet Union, such as the Cossacks, the Mongols, Tartars, Uzbeks etc who lived far away from the conflict.

1204319,4,B00000F5US,"This review is for the Goodtimes Video release.

 THE BATTLE OF CHINA and WAR COMES TO AMERICA are the final two episodes in Frank Capra's `Why We Fight' series.  Ordered by George Marshall to inform and inspire the troops - to tell them, as the series' title suggests, why we're fighting - the films use voice-over narration (usually supplied by actor Walter Huston) and a montage of pertinent documentary images to fulfill that mandate.  More propaganda than disinterested history, the final two entries seem less urgent than the earlier films.  Released in 1944 and 1945, they seem almost an afterthought, as though the project was losing a bit of steam.  The quality of the transfer prints on these two is superior to the earlier ones, which might indicate that these two weren't watched as often as the previous ones.

THE BATTLE OF CHINA (1944, 65 min.)

  Reprising a lot of material from PRELUDE TO WAR, the first film in the series, THE BATTLE OF CHINA shows us again the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and their slaughter of Chinese in Shang-Hai as the momentous events in the war in the east.  The Tanaka Memorial, the secret Japanese document that outlined their plans for `world conquest', first mentioned in PRELUDE, is used here to expose the Japanese early attacks on China.  `In order to conquer the world,' quoth the Tanaka Memorial, ` we must first conquer China.' Of course, Capra's TBOC shows us how far the Japanese fell short of that first of that first condition.  Shows us in ways remarkably similar to those used to glorify our other soon-to-be Cold War foes in the earlier THE BATTLE OF RUSSIA.  China's Sun-Yat Sen is favorably compared to George Washington and Abraham Lincoln and the Chinese love of freedom and their generally pacifistic nature is extolled in a rather long sequence that tells us ""They never waged a war of conquest.  They are not that sort of people,"" and continues with a list of good things that `that sort of people' do and bad things that aren't done by the Chinese because, well, they're `not that sort of people.'  In retrospect it's an obvious gild and whitewash job, compensated mainly by the fact that it worked.

WAR COMES TO AMERICA (1945, 70 min.)

 The series wraps up with WAR COMES TO AMERICA, which again regurgitates a lot of material from PRELUDE TO WAR.  The film opens with children pledging allegiance to the flag, visits Lexington and Valley Forge, surveys the militant and idealistic history of the United States before embarking on a catalogue listings of states and nationalities that would make Walt Whitman proud.  After this extended, self-admiring prologue the film starts in the familiar stuff, namely the 1931 invasion of Manchuria by the Japanese.  From there we re-visit one Axis atrocity after another until the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 and America's entry into the war.  It may have been that the tide of war was turning noticeably in the Allies' favor by 1944-5, and demonizing the Axis enemies was no longer a priority.  In any event, the last three films in the series concentrated a lot more on the virtues of their Allied subjects than on the atrocities of the Axis foes.",1123200000,2,3175,4.804788213627993
1204320,4,B00000F5US,"THE BATTLE OF RUSSIA is the fifth entry in Frank Capra's `Why We Fight' series.  Originally presented to audiences in two parts for its first run in 1943 it covers the years 1941-'42, and, as the title suggests, devotes most of its attention to the harsh fighting on the Eastern Front following Germany's massive attack against Russia.  As always, the intent was to explain the question posed by the series' title, and not present an unbiased documentation of events.

 Drawing on old movies - for instance, a number of scenes from Sergei Eisenstein's `Alexander Nevsky' are inserted - THE BATTLE OF RUSSIA begins with a historical survey of repeated invasions and repulsions, almost all invaders breaking on the gate of Moscow, defeated either by Russia's immense size or its brutal winters.  The film quickly returns to the modern day and shows Germany's speedy conquest of the Balkans, including Hungary, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Greece.  These are simply preparatory steps to extend the Russian front, though.  Germany launches its attack on June 22, 1941 as the first part ends.  The second part examines the failure of Germany's blitzkrieg style of warfare when confronted with Russia's defense-in-depth strategy.  The failed sieges of Leningrad and Stalingrad are show in detail.  For the first time in the series the German prove not to be invincible.

 In many ways THE BATTLE OF RUSSIA is the most interesting movie in the series.  There was a short summer of good feelings between the United States and the Soviet Union that lasted roughly from 1942 to 1947, and both nations muted their criticism of the other.  This movie conveniently fails to mention the German-Russian Non-Aggression Pact of 1939, a treaty that major Allied participants in the war like Winston Churchill could never forget and never mention without revealing their lingering bitterness.  For the first and one of the few times Hollywood lauds praise on the heroic people of the Soviet Union.  Perhaps it's unfair to hold up the message of this movie with the later rhetoric of the cold war, but it is a little startling to hear a government sponsored movie announce that `no invincible armies (can stand) against the determined will of a free and united people' and realize the free and united they're talking about are Soviet citizens.  As usual, the transfer print manages to look good most of the time, although some of the images are terribly blurry and look over exposed.  It's a discount dvd, so, as always, that's more an observation than it's a deal breaking complaint.",1122076800,12,2560,4.997641509433962
7907123,5,B00000F5US,"The Battle of Russia is the fifth of seven documentaries from the Why We Fight series directed by Frank Capra.  Released between 1942 and 1945, these films were shown to American military personnel for instructional purposes; they also served as American propaganda during World War II.  This film portrays the epic struggle between Germany and Russia on the Eastern front.  Topics covered include past (failed) invasions of Russia (the Teutonic Knights, Sweden, France), the natural resources of Russia (timber, oil, farmland), the peoples of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.), the scorched earth policy, Red Army methods of fighting, the siege of Leningrad, and the battle of Stalingrad.  Two themes are developed in this episode:  the battle of Russia as a people's war and the myth of the German army's invincibility.  This film does a good job of portraying this titanic struggle between Germany and Russia but makes no mention of the brutalities of Joseph Stalin.  Still, this is a good introduction to combat on the Eastern Front in World War II.",1524528000,,1070,5.1502890173410405

In addition, the movie provides a new point of view and and recent history point of view.  Two things I do not get and seem contradictory.  The first is that the film stated that unlike Hitler's invasion of Yugoslavia, France and Poland, the invasion of the Soviet Union caused the Red Army to fall back and coalesce into a greater force in the East.  If this was true, how come the Nazi's took (and killed) millions of Soviet prisoners in the first few weeks of Operation Barbarossa?  The second is that the movie talks about religion and Christianity in the Soviet Union.  I thought that the Soviet Union was Marxist, which forbade religion.",1457654400,,810,4.702127659574468
