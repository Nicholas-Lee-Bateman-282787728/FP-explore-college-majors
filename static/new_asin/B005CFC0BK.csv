8465219,1,B005CFC0BK,"I bought this for my 10 year old granddaughter who loves animals and horses even more. Fortunately I watched them before I gave them to her. I would have been embarrassed by such a terrible purchase. They were poor stories, poorly told and inappropriate or silly for children. Children would be bored to watch these movies.",1500681600,3,323,4.785714285714286
