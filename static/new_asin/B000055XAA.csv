1393825,5,B000055XAA,"The first time I saw Gundam Wing, I didn't understand it at all. No wonder- I saw an episode right in the middle of the series! Anyway, once I began to understand what was going on, I was immediately hooked. By the end of the series, however, I was mad because I wanted to see what happened to some of the characters. I watched Endless Waltz when it premiered on Cartoon Network. It was wonderful. It answered nerly all my questions: the mystery of trowa's origin (well, part of it--I know the other part, too ^_^), What happens to ZechsxNoin, What happened to Hilde, What Wufei was going to do, and whether or not Heero would stay with relina (not to spoil it or anything, but that was the one part I DIDN'T like!). I highly recommend this movie to all GW fans out there, especially those who want to learn HOW the GW pilots came to be (wink,wink)!",976320000,14,849,4.345911949685535
1393826,5,B000055XAA,well i wasn't much a gundam fan when i saw gundam wing but when i saw endless waltz i was amazed. That made me a gundam fan for life. My favorate part of this movie is wing zero showing is wing danfg that was nice,976233600,,213,3.7555555555555555
1393827,5,B000055XAA,"This movie displays incredible animation and has an awesome story line. It helps you understand what happens after the hit series Gundam Wing. I highly suggest purchasing this video. All the things children wonder is... what happens with relena and heero? Who does Lt. Noin get hooked up with? All these questions are ansered. Even the secret to trowa's identity. What amazed me is the awesome animation on this video. It looks like it's completly drawn by computers but it's not! Trust me, this is one video you HAVE TO GET. A must see. Thank you and enjoy your day.",975974400,7,567,4.68
1393828,5,B000055XAA,"This video is a must see for all anime fans. Gundam Wing is one of my favorite anime series, and I watch it all the time, but what made me really enjoy it was the movie. The characters in this movie an each unique personality that gives it the perfect mix for an action anime. If you are someone crazy about violence, war, and of coarse giant robots, like I am, this is a must own video for you. I enjoyed the movie very much, and I know all you Gundam fans will just love it.",975801600,,476,3.96875
1393829,4,B000055XAA,"I've been a Gundam fan for 20 years but I hated the Wing series simply because the repulsively designed Gundams by Kunio Okawara and the slow pace of the TV series. But ""GW: Endless Waltz"" is all different! All five Gundams received a full up-grade from Hajime Katoki (the guy behind ""Gundam Sentinel"" & ""0083 Stardust Memories"") with a new and much faster pacing story, also well balanced on each character.
Originally a 3 part OVA sequel (97') after the hit TV series, new scenes were added to create this movie edition (98'). No state-of-the-art CG animations as seen in ""Macross Plus"" or ""Blue Submarine 6"" but Endless Waltz still stands out.",975542400,7,646,4.776785714285714
1393830,5,B000055XAA,"When YTV played the uncut version back in September, I was impressed with the way this movie turned out.  However, I recommend getting this DVD.  You can see the uncut English dub verison along with the subtitled Japanese version.
The music is pretty good, I liked the plot, it just seemed like a small continuance of the series, just longer.  When Wing Zero sprout its wings, my jaw just dropped.  As weird as this seems, it's beautiful, along with the lovely inserted song when Wing Zero sprout its wings.
I don't want to spoil the plot for you, and I didn't find any major flaws in the movie, it's all great.  I know this review wasn't all that helpful, just buy it or rent it or whatever",975024000,7,691,4.409448818897638
1393831,5,B000055XAA,"I am going to have to disagree with the above statement.  I thought this was a wonderful movie.  I own the Japanese version and I also taped the Cartoon Network version.  Both are very good.  I would recommend either to anyone.  I was disapointed with the English version when they didn't subtitle the song ""White Reflection"" on the movie.  Oh well, I know it by heart.  It has a lot of great animation, wonderful art work, and in interesting plot.  However,I found the ending disapointing.  The ending was not very fitting for what I considered the best Gundam series in all of Gundam's 20-some-odd years of existance.  However it is a must see.  I think you will be pleasantly surprised with this movie.",974937600,,705,4.650406504065041
1393832,4,B000055XAA,"Let me make sure I explain one thing. I do not own the DVD because it is not out yet, but I do own a taped copy of it in English from when it played on Cartoon Network. And I also have a Subtitiled version of it on Video CD. I just want to say that the subtitiled version is much better. Some expression and meaning was lost when it was translated into English, as well as the fact that some of the voice actors don't match the character too well in English. Mariemeia for example had a voice actor that seemed a little mature compared to what a seven year old would really sound like. However in Japanese it did sound like a young 7 year old girl. Why do I say you should buy this? Because DVDs normally contain both languages when it comes to anime and I feel that any true Gundam fan should see the uncut subtitled version to fully realize the beauty of this film.

1393905,5,B000055XAA,"Probably the most epic ending in the Gundam Wing series. The animation, the music, and the voice acting are all beautifully high value. The only thing was I wanted was to punch that Mariemaia in the face the entire time. Who would seriously give a seven year old her own private army? This is the one time I actually hated someone more than Relena, especially since Relena did what I wanted to do at the end of the show. I cried out in joy!",1428364800,,440,4.25

1393907,5,B000055XAA,"This movie is great the Toonami version can bring back all of the memories if you grew up with the old school Toonami from 1997-2008. When you start off with this movie your gonna see previous first after that when you get taken to menu your gonna see the 5 main characters on screen with no music nor fx there's play movie but's it an ova Original animation video. It's a part 3 mini series but a great movie there's also select scenes and settings and trailers but there way different the special edition. Overall there's a lot of changes to this movie normally this movie is PG-13 but in this version I rate it Y7 cuz there's no blood and no profanity. They censored out Duo max well's nick name the God of death into the Great destroyer so they wouldn't put a bad influence on children from younger ages. Overall If your a fan of Old school Toonami like Dragon ball Z, Gundam Wing, Pokemon, Naruto, Sailor Moon, ETC. I believe this version Is suitable for Toonami fans and Kids from under 10 years old if there interested in anime. Even tough I grew up with Gundam Wing eversence I was about like 3 years old during my pre K year",1419638400,2,1133,4.323943661971831

1393930,3,B000055XAA,"Gundam Wing:Endless Waltz is the sequel to Mobile Suit Gundam Wing, both of which are set in the ""After Colony"" timeline, an alternate universe to that of the original Mobile Suit Gundam series. Aside from being a continuation to the Gundam Wing TV series, it also reveals details regarding the pasts of the five Gundam pilots and the true objective behind ""Operation Meteor.

Endless Waltz originally premiered in Japan as a three-part OVA in 1997 and it was later released as a theatrical compilation movie in 1998, including additional scenes and an altered musical score.

The Story here is not very well told here,were given some flashback scenes with the Gundam Pilots,which leads to the most interesting scenes in the Film,but these scenes are far too miniscule to save this films mediocrity. The plot is far too predictable,bad guys come,good guys fight them and i think anyone could predict the end here. There are no major plot twists or intriguing drama just straight forward long action scenes,but speaking of action,this Film does have some of the best Mechas vs Mechas action in any film even in 2014.

The voice actors from the Dubbed TV Series reprise their roles here(i am reviewing the Dub) and i am content with that,because these Voice Actors are excellent,diverse and timeless.

We do not learn much more about Heero in this Film than we already knew prior to this Film which is disappointing and Relena is not given a whole lot to do in this Film which is dissatisfying. Duo is not even as interesting here as he was in the TV Series.

The Mecha designs improved drastically here,as well as the Animation which looks simply alluring here.

The super catchy ""White reflection""Song  from the TV series is implemented in this Film,which i think is one of the best Anime Songs ever,also ""Last impression"" is presented in the Film and i felt that it was an instantly forgettable song.

Endless Waltz has great action and visuals,but it is just too short and very predictable,on top of that if you have not watched the TV series it is based you will be completely lost watching this. I can only recommend this to film to hardcore fans and those who want to  see some of the best Mecha vs Mecha battles ever.",1411689600,,2223,4.753246753246753

1393960,3,B000055XAA,"Anyone who sees GW again after being 12 years old realizes how incoherent the writing is, how Wufei disappears from the plot for many episodes, the insane amount of plot armor Heero has, how Trowa is basically a redundant Heero 1.5 (but a lot less suicidal) and... what the heck were Milliardos' motives again?

Thankfully, all of that is toned down quite admirably in the sequel movie Endless Waltz. The issues haven't disappeared, but this being a small self-contained story at least the writing improved. The animation is very nice, all your favorite Wing characters are back, the Gundam re-designs are cool and Trowa even has a backstory now. A part of the original series' premise gets kinda retconned, but it's not that bad. The DVD includes both the OVA and movie versions which is good.",1384819200,,794,4.838235294117647

1393985,3,B000055XAA,"First of all, I love this movie. I would not have ordered it if I didn't. The only reason I gave the three stars was because of the item itself. It arrived on time. Packaging was alright, but could of used bubble wrap. DVD cover was in good condition as well as the manual. After that, it's all pretty much a lie. The disc was hanging on the clips that held the manual. The disc itself had scratches on the top and bottom. Nothing ""like new"" about it besides the cover and manual. The good thing is it works fine (from seeing the menu and extras). Lets just see if it continues to work when I actually watch the movie.",1306800000,,618,4.158333333333333
1393986,5,B000055XAA,"A well-made anime film even as a stand-alone, Endless Waltz concludes the epic Gundam Wing series (so preferably watch that before this). It has exceptional quality one would come to expect from the creators of Gundam Wing, with excellent voice acting and fluid animation.

Just to clarify, the reason the Gundams are in a new ""custom"" form that was not present during the series was that the creators literally wanted to make more money off the models and action figures, so the only way to do that was to introduce new versions of the same mechs. Thankfully, the transition, although absent in the film (it is assumed the Gundams looked that way, even in a flashback to the last episodes of the series) was well-recieved by most.

Put simply, this is how Gundam Wing ends, so you must see this if you saw the series and liked what you saw.",1301961600,,841,4.6
1393987,4,B000055XAA,"When I first ordered this, it wasn't in stock and had to wait almost a month before it was shipped. When it did get shipped I received in three days and the packaging was almost perfect. I have always loved Gundam Wing and watched the show religiously. I enjoyed Endless Waltz very much, but I'm still left with a few questions. I thoroughly enjoyed watcing the Gundams back in action and the fact that a 7-year-old little girl could almost start a new war with the world. It would have been nice if the Gundam pilots' backgrounds were explained in more detail, but what we got was sufficient. I  wish they would have drawn out the relationship between Heero and Relena more. It was refreshing to see Heero still watching over Relena in the OVA version, but I felt they could have explained what eventually became of them. Do they end up together? Is he still her ""guardian"" from afar?

Even still, any fan of the series will enjoy this movie. At some points the plot feels a bit rushed and silly, and there is no explanation as to why Heavy Arms and Sandrock are now completely different colors from the series, and why Wing Zero now has giant angel wings, but if you can look past that the movie is awesome.",1297728000,,1209,4.441441441441442

1393992,4,B000055XAA,"Just when they thought they were out, a 7-year-old wannabe dictator pulls 'em back in.  That's the premise for the first sequel to an alternate-universe Gundam show, and the last entry in the Gundam Wing saga.  Taking place one year after the TV series, the Earth is under attack by a little girl with big dreams of world domination, forcing the Gundam pilots back into action.  But with their giant robot suits on a collision course towards the sun, they might not be around for long.

First released as a 3-part video series and then a full-length movie, ""Endless Waltz"" provides much-needed backstory for the main characters and resolves some of the issues the show had.  But not every question is answered (you have to read all that GW manga for that), and it's surprising that the powers that be decided to wrap up the saga at the height of its popularity.  Regardless, ""Endless Waltz"" ends on a high note with its crisp animation, great sound quality and sweet retconned robot designs.  But if you're interested, you should watch the TV show first.

The DVD features both the 3-part video and movie versions of ""Waltz,"" as well as robot profiles, a picture gallery, trailers and credits that include a full song.

1394022,5,B000055XAA,"Gundam Wing was a breakthrough in Gundam animation and brought even more fans to the Gundam World. Endless Waltz is the conclusion to the 50 episode saga, but can also stand alone without knowing too much about the series. The animation is great and the new gundam style is visually pleasing.

Having the OVA and the Theatrical Version in one is great, there are only a few differences...like the different Mariemaia voice actress you can barely notice, the songs that are moved or removed, but if you're a hardcore fan it's great to watch. The extra scenes and the removing of the ""episode""-like qualities in the movie version are excellent and barely even noticeable.

The only confusing part is that even in flashbacks dated during and before the origanal 50 episodes contain the NEW gundams...I just like to think they had the gundams updated after the war and ignore the flashbacks lol.

All and all, a GREAT addition to the series. The characters have changed as they would have over a year of peace, and even more character development comes through, essential to a movie based on a series we watched them grow through.",1124841600,15,1126,4.793814432989691

1394025,5,B000055XAA,"Endless Waltz is a magnificent conclusion to a wonderful series. But this movie/ OVA is far more than a sequel, it is also of a prequel to the series - giving viewers a glimpse of their favorite Gundam pilots' past.

The Gundams return with amazing new designs (courtesy of Katoki) and with them, two new Mobile Suit models: the Serpent units and the Tallgeese III! The mechanical designs are beautiful - the cover of the dvd with Wing Zero should be more than enough to show that.

The characters have matured as well. They remain true to their personalities from the series and yet, there is definite development. They are no longer lost and confused as they had been in the series... they are more resolute and determined... of course, with a few exceptions - one of which is that of a surprising enemy. But one must wonder if it was really that much of a surprise?

Endless Waltz is a definite conclusion to the After Colony timeline. But don't be sad - this is what makes it so great! The impressions left to us by Gundam Wing and Endless Waltz (not to mention the numerous comics) is something that we, true fans, will forever remember without the story or plot being exhausted by repetition.

This is a must have for anyone who has or have watched the Gundam Wing series!",1118016000,7,1278,4.51948051948052

Another problem I had is Wufei's random alliance switch.  Also, I think the ending was pretty dumb.  I mean, no war again, forever?  That's just too hard to believe.

1394047,5,B000055XAA,"Anyone who is a fan of the Mobile Suit Gundam Wing series will love the sequel to the outstanding series: Endless Waltz. This DVD contains the OVA and movie version of Endless Waltz, for those who haven't seen the movie version it may seem a bit weird (music cue and scene wise), plus its got deleted scenes. All of the characters have changed since the series it may not seem that way but believe me they've changed. And for the better; for instance the gundam pilots are much better friends and more mature physically and mentally.

Since Gundam Wing focused on the plot behind the series, Endless Waltz focuses more on the characters now that the war is over, but the plot is well thought out and excuted in this OVA. The DVD also contains extras; trailers, an image gallery for the characters and the gundams, and scene selections, along with the full version of ""White Reflection"" by TWO MIX [naturally]. It also contains English and Japanese Dub with subtitles.

The English dub is perfect and contains the original Canadian voice actors for the series: The Japanese dub is also good. Be warned; sometimes the characters mouths move and the Japanese voice actors aren't saying anything until a second later. But it shouldn't keep you from enjoying either dubs; both are quiet good in my Ernest opinion.

The animation is fluid, smooth and superb, almost human-like and the action will leave you craving for more. This movie is for anyone for loves Gundam wing for what is it and what's is talking about. Those who are new to Gundam Wing, I strongly suggest you watch the series first so that you aren't confused by this movie. If you love Gundam wing you'll love Endless waltz. Perchase this movie! You shan't be disappointed. -----[a 5 out of 5]",1105142400,4,1752,4.700325732899023
1394048,5,B000055XAA,"This movie is the best. The songs were so perfect, I fell out of the chair just listening to them. The animations were done perfectly and the sub. and english voices were great. If you are a Gundam fan or just getting into it. I advise you to watch the whole series and watch this movie. It shows some of the character's past. Like Heero and is personality, Duo and is arogant but yet cocky personality,Trua and his past and Catra and his past. This movie is great. My favorite part is at the end when Relena is giving a lecture, she looks up to see Heero listening and looking dead at her and she smiled and you could see a hint of happiness in his eyes. I thought the whole movie was beautiful. I cryed in the end but ti was worth it. Buy this movie.",1096675200,,752,4.122448979591836
1394049,4,B000055XAA,"At the end of gundam wing, we are left with the feeling that there is something missing. Relena and Heero's romance is unresolved, the future of the gundam pilots is undecided, and many things are left unanswered. That's where Endless Waltz comes in. In this movie, we find out what happens after gundam wing ends.
  The picture of course is excellent, as with most DVD's, and the music is new and refreshing from the typical Gundam Wing music that we fans are accustomed to. But the dialogue is flawed, badly flawed. The first version of this movie I saw, was the Japanese VCD version, 3 discs, with english subtitles. The subtitles from that VCD version conveyed the direct meaning of the translated dialogue, and displayed it in a near-flawless translation, keeping its meaning, dramatics, and intensity. The American/Canadian English actor version, the one I am reviewing, does not. In several places, the translation skews slightly, making some scenes lose their meaning and intensity, greatly decreasing the effect that this movie has with its viewer.

  Unfortunatly, the story is also left unfinished in this ending to the Gundam Wing series. Once again the future of some of the characters is left uncertain, as well as the situation with Heero and Relena. However, I still like the movie and can only say, buy the Japanese w/english subtitles VCD if you want to see this movie at its best. I give it a four out of five.",1089590400,3,1429,4.840163934426229

The special edition movie version on this DVD includes scenes that are no in the original OVA.  From my point of view, those scenes explained a lot.  It also features the return of a few characters from the series that you don't see in the OVA.
I think the biggest drawback to this DVD is that it wouldn't hold your interest if you're not a fan of the series.  If you saw this movie without having watched the series, you would probably be confused by a lot of the dialogue and backstory.",1062979200,,817,4.279220779220779

1394055,3,B000055XAA,"In the early 1990's, as Gundams success slipped, it was decided that if the franchise was going to keep afloat then it would need to be rebooted. Thus, the alternate universes (one shot 49 episode series) were created, each in seperate timelines and with nothing to do with the traditional UC, save the obious connections that make Gundam Gundam (sound effects, certain tech, etc). Wing emerged as the most popular of these and unlike it's brothers gained a sequel, first as a 3 chapter video release and then as a movie. The storyline is set a year after the final battle of the TV show. Everyone has moved on with their lifes and the Gundam pilots (sans Wufei) are preparing to send their Gundams into the sun as part of the peace plan. However, no soon has this happened then a rebel faction declares war on the World Nation. This faction, with Relena as a hostage, has strong ties to the past of the Gundams and their pilots and fully plans to make use of the WN's lack of weapons for a quick take over. They've also convinced Wufei, still confused after his final duel with Treize, to join them. The other 4 pilots head out to do what they can- Trowa playing mole within the rebels, Duo and Heero charging in and blowing things up and Quatre chasing after the Gundams.  The story is written as definitive conclusion to the Wing universe (obviously Bandai/Sunrise didn't want to eclipse the cash cow that is UC). being an OVA, the animation is better then that of the TV series. Likewise, the movie scenes are even better. However, this can be annoying when watching the movie version, as you'll see a rise and then decrease in quality as the movie goes from a new scene to a scene from the OVA. In terms of extras, there's a MS Encylopedia for all the new suits, textless versions of the endings for OVA chapters 2 and 3 and a very small gallery of pictures (more appealing to the female viewers then the male). The packaging is nicely printed on holographic paper with a great image of Katoki's Wing Zero Custom on the front.
This is certainly a disc that no Wing fan should be missing. Although the annoying hollow philosphy of the TV series is still present, there is at least a small jump in logic as those who preached pacifism in the series realise that such ideals won't work as long as there are those who hunger for power. There's also Katoki's very nice (albeit a bit unrealistic for his style) re-designs of the 5 surviving Gundams.",1057795200,3,2448,4.513513513513513
1394068,4,B000055XAA,"Well I loved the series and was hoping for something great here.  I was probably expecting too much though.  The new Gundams are just waaaay more cool than the original suits.  The story is great and puts a definitive end to a great series that shouldn't have been so defineitive.  Basically don't expect anything else from Gundam Wing.  The movie is of course very philosophical and the creators won't let you forget that as they bash it in to your head. Endless Waltz also animates very well.  And as you could expect better than the series.  With less twists in the movie you'll be able to leave the room where you're watching it and come back and you can still understand what's going on, unlike the series in which if you missed and episode or two it would take a few more to understand what the hell is going on. Also in the war of Dub Vs. Sub we have a tie in the battle that is Gundam Wing Endless Waltz. The Dubbed version is just as good as the subbed version which is a good thing. Hopefully there will be more dubs that are as good or better.  All in all Endless Waltz is a great movie and shouldn't be missed but only see if you've watched the series all the way through.",1055808000,2,1184,4.254464285714286

I really thought this was the best movie ever.  The mech desighns are awesome and the story really shows viewers a lot about the Gundam Pilots past. Once again Yoshiyuki Tomino has proved Gundam is an anime series of epic proportion. I think also the fact that Hero is not the leader in the movie is a great way to make it. Quatre is definently the sole leader in te movie. All of the Gundams(except maybe sandrock) have been redesighned. Good job Nippon Sunrise.

I hate the fact that Heero and Relena were the main characters in the Cartoon network movie(which I thought was terrible) but this DVD is my salvation! I LOVE QUATRE and am soooo glad that in the theatrical version of the movie, in the extra footage there's a whole lot of him going around!

1394074,5,B000055XAA,"Strange to say, it was the building of miniature Gundam figures that first got me interested in Anime.  But I was never all that drawn to what I knew of the plot.  I am not a battle freak, nor much of a 'hard' science fiction fan.  And, if nothing else, this story of the titanic struggle between earth and the colonies is truly hard science fiction.  True to my nature, when I finally decided to see one of the films, I picked 'Endless Waltz' completely missing the fact that it was the last in the series.
Oddly enough, that doesn't turn out to be a problem.  While the story is very much based on what went before, the film (not the OVA version) takes just enough extra time to provide some needed continuity.  In addition, the message behind it all is universal.  Nor is the base plot hard to follow, even if it's sometimes difficult to place some of the characters at first.  While 'Endless Waltz' didn't turn me into a complete Gundam groupie, it filled in a lot of what I didn't understand, introduced a lot of the characters and filled in the blanks behind some of the little figures that keep showing up on shelves around my house.
Despite the battle scenes and technology, 'Endless Waltz' is a political drama, as Dekim and Mariemaia Barton plan to attack earth and either rule the Earth Sphere Unified Nation or drop an entire colony on it.  The Gundam, disorganized and in disagreement, must sort out their own beliefs as they find a way to create a new peace that will not cave in to such efforts at empire.  But the real message of the film is that the Gundam cannot create peace on their own.  Instead, the people themselves must take responsibility for creating and sustaining the world they want to live in.
This message, with the important subtext about believing that life is something far more precious than any product of technology, makes this a strong film.  Even being as unfamiliar with the pilots as I was, I found something sympathetic and understandable in all of them.  All of the characters are vivid, from the supremely chilling Mariemaia Khushrenada (Barton) to Relena Darlian who must also confront what she believes develop through the film, and are still growing at its end.  Needless to say, artwork and battle choreography are excellent, providing a fitting end to the era of the mobile suit.
Having both the OVA and film versions is a plus since there are a number of tiny, but significant differences that are interesting of themselves.  My biggest criticism is that the subtitling is a bit too minimalist.  I would have appreciated translation of the various signs and credits as well as the narrative.",1041465600,14,2642,4.649462365591398

  i  so have to say though that the song, ""White Reflection"" really rocks. i was so moved i swear to god. I had recorded the movie off of Cartoon Network when it was showing and i watched it twice in a row, so what if i finished at 3 am! Of course there are the little twists here and there and then you have the old and the new characters, well all except the dead ones and just a hint to the people who haven't seen Endless Waltz, one of the guys isn't really dead! Anyway, You have the Funny Duo Maxwell all the way down to the Serious Heero Huy, but all in all it was really good. Usually sequals to things are so lame that you feel like shooting yourself but i was really surprised when Endless Waltz wasn't like all the other sequals for movies. i really enjoyed the special effects and the way it was down. the color was great and some things looked sorta wierd once in awhile but nothin totally major to distract you from the main point. I liked how they sorta summed up at the end of what the charicters did with there lives after blowing up their Gundams, although i was sad that they did that cause to me it seemed as if Gundams were their lives. But only one questions remains.... WHAT HAPPENS TO HEERO HUY?
i really liked how they showed some past images here and there so you really could understand how they got their gundams. once again i would like to metions that the outline was done pretty well, the music was AWESOME, the drawings we really COOL and they kept everything in line.

I find the Altron Custom stunning, or stunning for Gundam Wing. Sure, it's very much like the Dragon Gundam from G Gundam, but it's been um. done in a better animated, visually appealing way. Then there's that fight, between Wing Zero Custom (lol) and the Altron Custom. Ok, the Deathscythe Hell was BAD, it had a scythe, with TWO BLADES! Sandrock was ok, Heavyarms was terrible, you get the picture.
In this ""Special Edition"" version, you get Minami Takayama (Two Mix's) ""Last Impression"" enjoy it. It's the BEST part of the movie.

1394137,4,B000055XAA,"When I bought this I wasn't expecting much, but I was pleasantly suprised. I have never really liked Gundam Wing, but one of my friends insisted i buy it. So I did. The first thing you will notice about this movie is that the Gundams are completely redesigned. They are even more elaborite and dedailed. The second thing is the animation. There is much better color and lines. The movie has a completely different sound track than the series, and the main tune is quite catchy, though it is a little repetative. The plot is thoroughly thought through, and though you don't have to see the tv series to understand the background and understand the movie, it will make it a little more enjoyable. The voice acting for Gundam Wing has always been terrible(excluding Duo) and that remains constant with this movie. I have to say that the end is a little anti-climactic and could have been better done, but it is not bad enough to really hurt the show. All in all, this is a pretty good movie and though I happen to hate Gundam Wing in general, I have tried to keep my review impartial. Hope this helped!",1025654400,,1099,4.5

Give it a chance, though.  If you really don't want to go out and buy all 10 of those DVDs, watch this movie.  It has exceptional graphics for the time period, and a very well done voice acting in English.
Basically what happens is that the 5 Gundam pilots have split up and tried making ends meet doing... whatever.  Anyway, Trieze Kushranada (a really cool guy before he gets killed in the series) supposedly has a daughter that has just revealed herself to the colonies and Earth.  Her name is Mariemaya.  She has to be stopped before the war she started proggresses, which calls for the Gundam pilots.  You can guess what happens next, because I really don't want to spoil it for you.

  Those new mechas--it was just an idea the artists had.  Yup, they are just *there*.  Heero's Zero Custom is given an explanation in Blind Target (or Ground Zero) manga.
  The voice acting on the Japanese one--I like better then the on then the English.  Heero's voice, although nice the way it is in English, just has more meaning in Japanese.  Sure, it's still monotone, but it's not as DEEP, and it seems to give him a bit of a personality.  Duo's voice in Englsih...I hate.  He's lucky, hyper...not good for such a deep (scratchy?) voice as Scott's.  Trowa's voice is almost exactly the same in each.  Both a low tenor, both monotone.  Although the englsih one is a bit cocky.
AND I HAPPEN TO LIEK QUATRE'S VOICE IN JAPANESE!  He seems to be the ""young"" one, young boys are often played by women voice actors.  *gestures to ai*
Overall, Gundam Wing is great.  The animation and music ae perfection.  Us, hard-core fans understand the new mechas, etc etc..the not so hard-core fans though...they dn't know everything  So i cna't blame them for bad reviews!  ^^V",1022716800,,1322,4.665217391304348

I began thinking about a funny episode of ""Family Guy."" Then I realized I missed an important scene in the movie. Not that I understood a single thing in it in the first place. The plot is so dry but what makes it dry is the voice acting. Somebody please get these characters personalities! They all talk in this flat, straight, serious voice. It's like they're all asleep and their mouths run on copilot. I think this could be a pretty good anime. The animation is beautiful and the character design is well done. But all the boys are a little too pretty if you ask me. I've heard rumors some of them are gay. At least if they were it would make the story a little more interesting.

This movie takes place at this time, when Earth has been at a temporary state of peace, until a young girl known only as Mariemaia Khushrenada, daughter of Treize Khushrenada, a military commander who led a government faction known only as OZ to war, but died in the battle.  Mariemaia captures Ms. Relena Peacecraft, a politician who believes that peace can only be obtained by pacifistic ways, which, as we know, is hardly possible.  Thus, a group of five rogue pilots, neutral from joining either sides of the war, are pulled back into a plot so intricate that even Spielberg would cry.
  This movie not only depicts some of the coolest anime animation out there and has a great story line, it also generates the horrors of war and the politics of it into a simple, yet elegant, piece of animation, and shows that though peace is important, there comes a hefty price that must be paid, and an even greater question is asked: ""Does the human race deserve peace?  Peace can only be obtained by those who fight for it, and if so, is the human race ready for it?""

1394173,5,B000055XAA,"""Endless Waltz"" is the conclusion to the Gundam Wing series, but is not the kind of conclusion you normally find. It does something that most stories don't really do: it ends. And that's extremely satisfying! ""Endless Waltz"" begins where Gundam Wing left off, which wasn't really neccessary. But the result is a movie that complements the series greatly, and still stands on its own. ""Endless Waltz"" displays the same wisdom and action that the series did, and I find it reffreshing that anything can show such knowledge while keeping the appeal of pure-action. The saga has an incredibly mature outlook on war, and I believe there are many points in the series and the movie from which you can actually learn something.
That aside, ""Endless Waltz"" is a fantastic movie and certainly a must see for Gundam fans. It answers many questions that viewers may have, making more sense to the series. It still leaves a few questions on the table, but they  make the story more entertaining, allowing you to make your own theories. When I said earlier that it was ""satisfying"", I meant that it covers things most movies and shows wouldn't. It doesn't just show the story, it shows what happened after the story, the consequences of everything you saw. Which instead of leaving you with a bunch of annoying questions and begging for more, let's you say, ""That was great, let's watch it again!"" It clears up all the important issues and is the perfecting ending to a perfect series.
""Endless Waltz"" has an inspiring soundtrack,  amazing animation, and if you let your imagination take over a little, a very believable plot that intertwines with series very smoothly. The action couldn't be better, and the entire storyline of the movie is immpressive. It's enough to keep you watching, and if you're not already, make you a fan.

Mainly because I was sick of him getting all the fame and fans when I think the other gundams was working even harder than him!!And it also shows that no matter what,even if he was the main charecter,it proved that the other gundams was just as strong or even stronger than wing zero. I loved the music and I also liked that white reflection song,he he. Zex is awesome in this movie with his new tallgese. The serpent customs was realy awesome to. I think that they should have had shown deathsythe,sandrock and heavyarms alot more because it only shown them fighting at the very end because The movie was mainly fixed on the action packed and dramatic endless fight between the golden wing zero and the legendary altron.

1394175,5,B000055XAA,"All 49 episodes of Gundam Wing aired on Cartoon Network's popular action cartoon station, Toonami. Now the series are finished, leaving a chance for the movie Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz to air as a conclusion to the Gundam Wing series. Months later, the movie released on home video on DVD and VHS. The Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz DVD has both versions of the movie, the OAV version and the full movie version with never before seen footage (Watch the movie version ! It has the complete details !), complete with tons of extras, including the trailers to other anime series like Crest of the Stars, Cowboy Bebop, Outlaw Star, and Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory (the latest among the U.C. Gundam series) On the year After Colony 195, there was a war between the Earth and the Space Colonies. The war ended when five young Gundam pilots destroyed the battleship Libra and the inhabitants who were in there. A man named Treize Kushrenada, the sovern of the Earth's Sphere Alliance, entered the same war against Libra, and died in battle by the hands of Chang Wufei and his Altron Gundam. But still, his ideals were remembered by other people... ""to bring peace on Earth and Space"". Thus this gives a birth of a new generation and the birth to the Earth's Sphere Unified Nation. Now the year is After Colony 196, people are living in peace and so far, no wars have occured...that is until Treize's lost daughter, Mariemaia and Dekim, Treize's father in-law and Mariemaia's Grandfather, declared war against the Unified Nation. Now the Gundam pilots Heero, Duo, Trowa, and Quatre (Wufei has joined Mariemaia's army to fight against Heero) find themselves back to the battlefields with their newly customized Gundam Mobile Suits. With the Gundam pilots and the Preventers retaliating against Mariemaia and Dekim, will they ever put an end to this meaningless battle ? Now let me explain about how the movie is like. The storyline is almost perfect. Sure it completely follows the lines of the Gundam Wing series, but one problem...when one of the Gundam pilots reflect back on their memory, their Gundams were already customized. They didn't have their early Gundam suits. The Gundam that Wufei first launched with, was his Shenlong Gundam, not his Nataku. Quatre's Sandrock wasn't even customized yet when he first went to Earth, and the same goes with Trowa and his Gundam Heavyarms. It didn't make any sense, but at least the story goes along with the Gundam Wing series. The animation looks even better than that of the early Gundam Wing series. Not only do the characters and the scenery look cool, but it seems that the detail of the animation was concentrating on the newly customized Gundams and the other Mobile Suits. Once you see how this movie looks, you will never believe your eyes. The voice acting is perfect, although you might hear some familiar voices that keep on appearing. Like for example, the voice of Quinze might be heard when a soldier is speaking. But that's not important. The point is, that the voice still remains the same, and that's a good thing. They haven't changed the voices of the five Gundam pilots (I thought they were gonna change, but thank goodness they didn't). And don't worry, Brian Drummond is still playing as Zechs. He did not abandon the role of Zechs like he did to the character Vegeta in Dragonball Z. The music is topnotch. The BGM sounds even better than the ones from the original Wing series. So does the music from Two-Mix, the same group that sang ""Just Communication"" and ""Rythym Emotion"" on Gundam Wing. The sound effects still remain solid. The sound of brutally scratched metal, gunshots, and deep explosions are still here in this movie. All in all, an Anime movie worth owning. Although it suffers a pinch of flaws on the storyline, Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz is still a must have for any die-hard Gundam fan or anyone who is nuts about giant robots.

For those wondering (like myself until I finally saw all 49 episodes and could proceed without fear) it would be highly recommended to see Gundam Wing in its entirety before the film so as not to spoil the later parts (the earlier parts too for that matter) of the series for yourself.
That said, Endless Waltz is a very well done continuation of the series.  Meaning it is much more than a sequel.  In the movie we discover what happens to the Earth and the Colonies in AC196, after the events in Gundam Wing.  Important backstory is also revealed in reference to each of the pilots and Operation Meteor.  Because of this, the story line is very much weaved into the entire Gundam Wing universe.
As for the plot itself, it is very believable, and does not seem forced or contrived in any way during the movie, it fits in seamlessly with the series.  I will say that when I go back and watch the series the next time, it will be interesting, after learning what I did from the movie.  It makes me look forward to watching all 49 episodes again, when I will be able to make connections and draw parallels I did not notice before.
It is also worth noting that all the Gundams have recieved major facelifts and look even better then before! ^_^
The bottom line is, if you enjoyed (or are enjoying) the Gundam Wing series, Endless Waltz will make the ending even greater for you.  I got goosebumps several times watching it! ^_^  If you thought Episode 49 was good, Endless Waltz should amaze you.",1002067200,6,1585,4.460207612456747

Now, this is where the film carefully takes you through Mariemeia's plans to slowly take over the Earth and the space colonies. She is drawn into her grandfather, Dekim Barton's, web of deceit and in the end, betrayal. I don't want to give away most of the story lines but I can tell you, you will definitely love it.

And,while to the untrained eye this movie might appear to be,& even be considered an overview of the whole Gundam-W series,it is either the conclusion to the Gundam timeline,(as many will see it),or,more plausebly the prequel to the next Gundam series to come. Sure the narrator states, ""...and from this point in time mobile suits,including those called Gundams,were never seen again.,""but we only see the 5 Gundams self detonate,and soldiers & civilians burning weapons in front of destroyed Serpents.(Sorry to ruin the ending...actually I've disclosed nothing.)The Tallgeese III,(which apparently had been hidden from all but 5 people up until the point Zechs comandeers it,)just disappears as do the the remaining Serpent suits. During the credits Zechs & Noin are seen flying off into space in a huge recolonization ship...who's to say he didn't take it with him? After all he is rather fond of the Talgeese suits. This and other scenes within the movie actually allow for a likely continuence in the Gundam series...But, if not it's a great movie in itself and besides which the series only covers a 2yr period.

No shield, extra wings, and a really great outer shell.  The sketches on this thing is marvelous.  I loved it, especially it's big bad weapon system: the twin buster rifle!  I would rank Talgeese III in second for big guns.  And do I mean BIG GUNS!  It's beam cannon is the biggest, baddest, longest, strongest hunk of metal they call an arsenal you've ever seen.  One shot from that blew up a space sta.  Moving down the list, at the bottom, you'd see Leo.  One word: STINK!  Well, moving on....  The chara are magnificently recreated, including Lady Un (Une).  And, guess who's back to join the squadron?  I'll give you a hint: former OZ pilot.  If you said Treize Kushrenada, you can take your sorry kiester back to M.S. school, cause it's ZECHS MARQUISE, AKA the ""White Fang"" leader and Milliardo Peacecraft.  This guy now works with Un and one special person that he holds in his heart (mushy, ain't it), Lucrezia Noin.  *sigh*  Aw, what the heck.  They're lovebirds, end of story.  Well, not quite.  Two new chara have entered the plot: Dekim Barton and Marimaia Barton/Kusrenada.  You see, Marimaia believes her father is Treize (like he'd have time for a wife), but she's the daughter of Lisa Barton, sister of the actual Trowa Barton.  (Note: The Trowa we know is not the actual Trowa, which they reveal in the movie.)  Freaky, ain't it?  Well, she's a puppet in Dekim's plan, OPERATION: METEOR, the dreaded plan that started this whole Gundam series.  Dekim uses Marimaia for world domination.  Upon capturing the heroine of the movie, Vice-Foriegn Minister of the Earth Sphere Unified Nations Relena Darilan/Relena Peacecraft/ Former Queen Relena.  Of course, that gets Heero ticked off, making him chase down Dekim and Marimaia's butts all the way through space and back.  I think I've said enough.  Well, you've got to see this movie to believe it.  Great animation, visual effects, storyline, chara, and MUSIC (You've got to hear ""White Reflection"" of the OAV Version and ""Last Impression"" of the Movie Version.  They sound so good......that is, if you truly love music.).  The price is FAIRLY reasonable, but I would consider on asking to bring it down just a notch.

It unfolds almost better than some of the real life movies I've seen, and the reoccurring song ""Last Impression"" by Two Mix gets your emotions dragged into the story too. Even though it's not a tear jerker type movie, I found myself on the verge of tears, and I very rarely cry during movies. The special edition DVD version is also nice to have because you get it in both Japanese and English. I know some people prefer to watch all Anime's with only English subtitles, so you can get a taste of both. The ""Extras"" on the DVD include a Gundam Encyclopedia which explains in detail all the stats of the Gundams - including weapon counts and serial numbers, Textless Endings, and Trailers for other Anime series'. As far as violence goes, it's merely Mobile Suit against Mobile Suit most of the time, and machinery blowing up. There is however a scene where two people get shot at the end which might not be suitable for very young children, and I'm sure the edited version does not include that. Overall it was a breathtaking movie that I feel no guilt for buying. Anime lover or not, I'm sure you'd enjoy it!",996105600,,1223,4.464285714285714
1394196,2,B000055XAA,"This movie... *shakes head*  My friend and I got this movie, because we liked the Gundam Wing TV series and I had read a good review of it, while we were making an anime video stockup.  Fine.  We go home... and we watch in her basement... and we laughed our butts off the ENTIRE TIME.  This movie was meant to be serious but we just couldn't take this with a straight face... The dubbing, by the way, is really really bad: Heero (main character here) has such a monotone: ""I am Heero Yuy. I am here to kill you."" said SO blandly will always make me crack up.  Duo, the spunky, young, happy-go-lucky american pilot, is given a deep manly voice. *shakes head* WHY, I'll never know.  I think this movie is probably great to true fans of the series, but I am not such a big mecha fan.  The story here was watery and I coulnd't follow it all with all the bad dialogue and it's habit of sloppily switching from scene to scene.  And there is such bad conclusion for some of the characters, I swear!! : In the ending credits, all you see of Duo is standing on a junk pile, and then aproached by a random girl so he can sign something for her. Gee, that's sure closure.
This movie is meant for the hardcore Gundam fans.  Anyone else, back away: this is one stinky cheese otherwise.  Get the DVD, and for the love of Duo change to voice acting to Japanese.  On the other hand, though, my friend and I had SO much fun laughing about this baby and now we have all these inside jokes about it that will be entertaining for a long, long time...so maybe you'd like this movie for that purpose.  Me, I'll stick to my Kenshin and Cowboy Bebop.",995414400,3,1626,4.226537216828479

1394198,5,B000055XAA,"I am so glad that I bought this DVD. I bought the tape and it was a waste of money.
The tape only shows you the OAV version: Three episodes with different music from the movie version, with only text endings. They also cut out scenes for the movie and switches things around a bit, like where they put flashbacks into the past.
The DVD shows you not only the OAV version in English like the so called ""uncut"" tape, but also in Japanese and you can chooses whether or nor to have subtitles. You also get the Movie version: One big movie with more scenes and different music. It gives you a scene with Quatre and Duo discussing their plans to save the Gundams, Sally Po rescuing Catherine and the circus people, Dorothy rallying the people to stand up for peace, and a different and funnier ending showing how all the pilots live after the gundams are destroyed. The ending to the OAV series is ok, but the ending to the movie is much sadder because of poor Heero! L I will try not to spoil it, but to me it was so sad to what happens to Heero.
The animation is better on DVD, and so is the sound. You get clearer pictures. The extra is a small MS Encyclopedia of the Mobile Suits shown on the Movie and OAV. Another extra you get are the two OAV endings without the text. The Movie Endings don't have any text and all the credits occur after the ending of the entire movie so I guess they didn't feel that there was a need to exclude that and put in the extra work.
I don't like the voices they have for the characters in the Japanese version. I like the actor's voices in the English version better because I think it makes their character better and contributes to their personality. I don't like how they gave Quatre a woman's high-pitch voice. I think Brad Swaile did an excellent job of being the voice for Quatre.  I really like Duo's voice, voice actor Scott McNeil, and Trowa's voice, voice actor Kirby Morrow. The voices of Heero and Zechs in the English version are mature and mysterious which sounds better than the Japanese version. The English version is much better than the Japanese version. Even though if you don't speak their language, you can tell a lot from the tone in a person's voice how they really feel. The English version did a much better job at the tones.
I don't know if it is because I am used to watching it on Cartoon Network, but I think that it looks better in English than it does in Japanese. When I watch other shows like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon, I like watching subtitles and I like their Japanese voices better. I think Gundam Wing just looks better in English because they travel all around the world and English in more of a universal language than Japanese. I mean, English is a second language of Japan! And plus, I think it helps out with the story line. Duo is American and Heero who is Japanese. Same with Relena and Trowa who is Northern European and it looks funny seeing them speak Japanese. I think English just looks better because most cultures learn their own language and English as foreign or secondary language.
But in any case, this DVD is a must buy! For about $30 or less, you get 4 movies in 1: The English Dub of the Movie, The Japanese Version of the Movie, The English Dub of the OAV, and the Japanese Version of the OAV. You also get the extras of the MS Encyclopedia, A small Picture Gallery of some great group shots, and OAV textless endings. You also have the Trailers that to some great series.",994809600,6,3469,4.345146379044684

1394201,5,B000055XAA,"I bought this DVD the day it came out and loved it instantly. But I didn't really have anything to say about it until watching the ending of another great anime series, Neon Genesis Evangelion. Both the TV and movie versions of that series angered me to no end, but they made me realize how great ""Endless Waltz"" is.
The ending of the ""Gundam Wing"" television series wasn't really that at all. Sure, the 'bad guys' were defeated, but anyone who thinks that's all that matters isn't a fan of good storytelling. ""Endless Waltz"" answers pretty much every question you might have about the fates of the characters, and I don't mean just the Gundam pilots, either. Every important character of the series is brought into play, and even some not-so important ones. As icing on the cake, this DVD also answers many(though not all) questions about the characters from before the start of the series.
The animation, characterization, and excellent soundtrack (""White Reflexion!"") all make up for the fact that the plot is slightly silly and a little cliched. More of a bad guys versus good guys thing as opposed to the complexity of the series. But hey, it's a movie, how deep do you want them to get, here?
Two more reccomendations. Watch the movie version, as opposed to the OVA version. You'll be glad you did. It contains extended and all-new footage that really makes the story flow better, plus there's some great music in certain scenes that were silent in the OVA vesion.  Secondly, and this is something I never ever say about anime, watch it dubbed. No, I'm not insane. It's actually better, I swear to God. I've seen it in both languages, and simple lines (such as many of Heero's) just sounded better delivered in English.",993686400,81,1725,4.711920529801325
1394202,5,B000055XAA,"The Japanese animation series of Gundam Wing spans 49 episodes, ending in a very surprising climax. In the three-part series finale (or movie edition of the OAV), we are able to see familiar characters put closure to a turbulent time in their lives. I find that the special edition of Endless Waltz is the perfect purchase for anyone who is familiar with the series of Shin Kidouseki Gundam Wing. It has several advantages over the VHS version. The DVD includes not only the OAV, the special movie edition, which can be considered as the true series ending. Another reason to purchase the DVD is for the subtitled versions of Endless Waltz. The Japanese voice actors easily surpass their English counterparts. With talents such as Hikaru Midorikawa (Tamahome in Fushigi Yuugi, Zelgadis in Slayers), Koyasu Takehito (Hotohori in Fushigi Yuugi, Aya in Weiss Kreuz), Orikasa Ai (Ryoko in Tenchi Muyo, Kanae in Shoujo Kakumei Utena) and many more, the experience of the series will be heightened. However, if you do not like subtitled anime, the English version does an impressive job of telling the story without many problems. The DVD also features uncut version of the anime, subtitled and dubbed in English. They are not much different from the edited versions, since the original does not have explicit violence. The animation itself is breathtaking, much more details then the series. I myself have very little interest in the mechanical designs of the mobile suits; however, the new designs are eye-catching. If you have doubted the beauty of the Gundams, one look at the Wing Zero Custom will render you speechless. The music of the OAV and movie are wonderful, which include two new themes from TWO-MIX, the music duo which created the openings of the series, 'Just Communication' and Rhythm Emotion'. I am certain the new themes 'White Reflection' and 'Last Impression' will find their way into your heart. The actual DVD itself has very few bugs. It runs very well and freezes rarely. The sound quality is in originally in a 'Dolby"" format however 'THX' and 'Stereo"" sound will work fine. The menus are easy to navigate and feature animations of the Gundams performing various tasks. Unfortunately, some of the extra features of the DVD are weak. The Mobile Suit encyclopedia has a few mistakes (spelling of names, actual facts about the Gundams) and the image gallery is sorely lacking. If you are eager to view the climatic ending of television series or you are an casual anime fan who is searching for something worth your time, I advise you to purchase this product.

1394203,5,B000055XAA,"To sum it up, everything is here. This is not simply a smash the hell outta the baddies DVD. Sure, we've got some killer mecha battles, but there's also character developement. Treize's daughter tries to take over the world (does that sound corny or what?), and we get to see a struggle between Hero and WuFei. WuFei has become part of Marimea's (Treize's daughter) army, and the seeming re-birth of WuFei puts him at peace in the end. Zechs makes a return to the Gundam Universe as ""Preventer Wind,"" piloting Tallgeese (I think!). The drawn graphics are incredibley sharp and flowing, and the music is, for the most part, left in its original Japanese form. The conclusion is an incredible fight scene, sticking to the Gundam Pilots' principles of the need for peace. They fight the entire battle alongside Zechs and Noin, and no deaths occur due to painstaking care on the part of the Gundams! The battle ends with the destruction of Wing Zero, but the succes of its mission. There's nothing wrong with this DVD, and EVERYTHING right with it! The ONLY thing that could've been improved was the menu - it was a little minimalistic. But there was no 4.5 stars, so round up and get this DVD!",992822400,,1190,4.644549763033176
1394214,5,B000055XAA,This is the logical conclusion to the Gundam Wing Series.  The hints toward the end of the series about the 'true' nature of Operation Meteor and how the scientists changed the parameters of it.  So we finally see the mastermind behind the Gundams and Operation Meteor.  We also see a more satisfying finish to the Gundams and the mobile suits.

1394215,4,B000055XAA,"Hi all, I am a dedicated anime fan, and the Gundam Wing series, in my opinion, is true anime.  I've seen all 49 episodes multiple times (although I'm still angry that most of the time my fav character, Chang WuFei was not in most of the episodes).  I love the story, and how the creator dips into the true emotions of soldiers during a war.  However, I am here to talk about Endless Waltz.  I first saw the dubbie movie on Cartoon Network, and I was not as dissapointed as I thought I'd be.  Although the custom Gundams call for a major review, the story and plot was not only very Gundam, but beautiful and mature.  Each character is filled with an inner struggle, such as Trowa's struggle to find himself (he is beginning to realize that his name is not his at all), and WuFei's own personal struggle (WuFei dedicated his life to the war, and now that it's over he has nothing else to do).  I love Duo's kick butt-ready for action-happy go lucky-if i die today who gives a care-i'm the god of death-attitude.  However, my favorite part of the movie is the ending (no, not when relena drops her pacifist act and slaps the kid), when Heero falls, and Relena catches and holds him in her arms (very romantic!  yatta!) Okay, so I'm a sucker for romance. I also love Zechs come back, and how he and Noin appear to be getting it together.  If you have never seen, or heard of Gundam Wing, I highly recommend this movie!  It's got the great graphics, wonderful plot, and...well, I still can't get over how ugly those Custom Gundams were...

In Endless Waltz, the implications are that the ""customized"" Mobile Suits were referred to as if there was no previous version of them. Here are some examples about different MS:
(Tallgeese III): ""It's THE TALLGEESE!!"" (Wing Gundam Zero Custom): Tell Quatre to send the WING ZERO over here. (Gundam Heavyarms Custom) : ""Are you saying you'll pilot this Mobile Suit HEAVYARMS?!""

1394218,5,B000055XAA,"I think Endles Walz is a Great Ending to Gundam Wing! It has much more of the central Gundam theme, that appeared first in the Gundam 0079 Series, the Question if there is any real reason for a war. I think Gundam Wing seems to be a Action Series to many people and even some thinkit is shonen-ai (i think you write this diffrent in the US. But it is'a bit like Evangelion, it has a deeper Meaning (of course not SO deep like EVA) and i think Endless Walz completes the Series on for all. The only think I would mind is the happy end, it don't really fits into the Gundam Wing scenario and the Theory of the ""endless walz of history"" it is to...happy! I think i feel like this, bacause i've just seen End of Evangelion, a great film by the way i would say nearly everyone who liked Gundam will love Evangelion and EoE. But if you like Animes or Cartoons with invincible Super Heros and that kind of stuff, watch Sailor Moon *wrg* or other simple Series not the Complex and deep Animes from Great directors like Hidaeki Anno *he is SOO cool*.

1394235,4,B000055XAA,"I liked this movie simply because I've already seen the whole series.  Yet, it seemed to lack a sense of excitement in some aspects.  It didn't conclude Gundam Wing in a very strong way, since the whole movie was centered around the little girl, Mariemaia, and Relena.  Secondary conflicts didn't really arise, which would have made for a more interesting plot.
Although, if you are a Relena + Heero fan, then you might greatly enjoy this movie.  Small romantic moments are felt...as Heero tries to rescue her...OFCOURSE!  And the ending is somewhat sweet...
Even though it seemed to lack adrenaline, mobile suits not really being the focus, it does allow for the viewer to see deeper into some of the characters...such as Heero.  It has a very straight forward plot, but is a good movie.
I would recommend The Endless Waltz for anyone who has seen the series and grew to like the characters.  Although some of the characters were neglected in the movie, it still provides a nice conclusion.  (Also, Heero's gundam is gorgeous!!!...so is Duo's!)  A nice storyline, though it could have been spiced up a bit...but hey, who am I to be a critic, right?

Many secrets about the Gundam pilots are revealed and is shown how they reacted to those past events. It is shown why Heero is so distant and the truth behind Trowa Barton's past. The mobile suits also get a fancy upgrade in their designs. Wing Zero looks more like an angel with heavy artileery and the other suits look impressive in combat. The DVD version is also packed with 30 minutes more of footage and extras like a Gundam encyclopedia. This an excellent dvd for people of all ages.,984009600,3,570,4.490384615384615
1394245,5,B000055XAA,I have seen all the Gundam episodes and I must say that this is a pretty impressive movie. It really sums up the whole gundam series. It also makes up for what Cartoon Network left out. It is about what happend a year after the series ended. It is mainly about the gundams and their pilots having to save the Earth from a mysterious new enemy. And you would never guess some of the people you see were even around.

1394246,5,B000055XAA,"Let me start off that I have watched only a few episodes of Gundam Wing.  I have a few models because mech kits are neat.  I have a couple of Gundam manga books.  BUT I do not have a clue what this series is really about nor do I know the history.
With that said, I have to say that the story is very entertaining.  It is also well drawn and the animation is quite amazing.  (I have seen the Macross series, but this is a bit more entertaining.  Except for the fact that the Gundams don't turn into neat planes.)  We have round blasts (like in Macross)and hundreds of rockets flying through the air.  It's quite a sight, exactly what you expect from a mech movie.
The story.  After a year of peace, the peace is broken by a group who thinks they should inherit the world.  The Gundams, sent to the sun to be destroyed since there was peace, must be retrieved.  The heroes you are all familiar with, return to save the world.  And the characters I thought were bad guys, well...  The bad guys have their own agenda.  (This is where knowing the characters and the past stories help a bit)
So I'm a newbie trying to dive into a series that has been around since 1979.  Not an easy thing to do.  I suggest this to any who dare buy this awesome movie, know a little bit about the series!  Maybe I could start a club for those who don't have a clue about the series.  (And no, I haven't jumped into Neon Genesis Evangelion.)",983577600,,1418,4.188888888888889

Quatre, mad with the death of his father, goes on a killing spree by taking out a whole colony with the buster rifle. Heero and Trowa are forced to stop Quatre with the Mercurious and Veigheight. However, it only results with Trowa adrift in space and both Quatre and Heero taken back in as prisoners. Also, Wu Fei and Duo escape the lunar base in their newly built Gundams. A very exciting volume that shouldn't get boring. A great volume to an allready great series and theres still more to come. Great stuff!",983232000,,615,4.5
1394248,5,B000055XAA,"This is one to see. Although I have only seen the version that was aired on cartoon network (it was edited) gundam is far better uncut. The art is fantastic! The story is original and ties into thye gundam wing plot, however if you miss one second yyou can be left out for the rest of the movie. This story moves very fast! Although you might pass it off as ""another giant robot movie"" this is not your typical robot movie. There is a huge amount of philosophy concerning war and peace. Honestly, there are some very good quotes here, I have even used some in my essays (I'm in high school). Rather well translated, but with all translations something is lost. The dubb voices are excellent! I would reccommend this to anyone who likes anime or even people who do not. One warning, if this is the first anime title you will see, stay away, this is much easier to see if you have seen Gundam Wing. This is a must buy!",983232000,,916,4.300578034682081
1394249,5,B000055XAA,"Very well done. The animation was incredible, the storyline was gripping, the dubbing was actually good for a change. There was only one major problem. The Gundams are magically transformed into their Custom forms with no explanation (not that I'm argueing, but it's kind of weird). Otherwise it was great. I especially liked the ending. It gave characters a great sign-off, especially the movie version. All in all, this is a must-see for any Gundam fan!",983059200,,455,5.0
1394250,5,B000055XAA,"This review will be split up into categories.
VIDEO: Perfect. Bandai never skimps on image quality when it comes to high grade anime. Colors are crisp and clear with no bleeding.
SOUND: Like with other titles, Bandai never fails when it comes to Audio. The 2.0 surround sound for the OAVs is great, but the real treat is the 5.1 sound which makes Endless Waltz seem as if your right there in the theater. This is Bandai's first shot at 5.1 and they pass it with flying colors.
PACKAGING: Great! Being Bandai's first anime movie release, they put the credits on the back in movie format as well as the speical foil cover.
EXTRAS: Some of the small extras include an image gallery and textless endings, but the real treat is the MS Encyclopedia featuring stats and pictures of all mobile suits in Endless Waltz.
MENUS: The main menu is like that of the cover with snowflakes falling. The scene selection has a great backround featuring scenes with the most action.
STORY: After a brilliantly redone version of the battle at Libra, the story begins with Sally Po finding a chunk of Neo Titanium in space while Duo and Quatre launch a satellite to send the Gundams into the sun. After Relena Peacecraft is kidnapped at X18999, Heero and Duo take off for the colony while Noin and Sally determine the source of the Titanium while Trowa joins Mareimaia's army at the colony as Quatre attempts to get the Gundams back. Zechs returns in the Tallgese to offer some help, too. Wu Fei has allredy joined Mareimaia's army with no intention given. When Heero and Duo get to the colony, they are attacked by Trowa in the new Serpent suit and Wu Fei in his Altron. Heero and Duo manage to escape while Quatre finally gets the Gundams back on their way to earth. After Heero and Duo help Trowa stop the colonies instability. Heero picks up Wing Zero in space and fights it out with Wu Fei, while Quatre, Trowa and Duo get their Gundams back and help Zechs and Noin fight the Serpent troops. Well, the story is too long to explain in words and must be seen. One thing to look for in the movie is that the Heavyarms has the one-sided clown mask on that Trowa wears at the circus. Overall, the best DVD out there right now and is a must for any anime collection.",982972800,,2243,4.4731707317073175

They sure were wrong. Can the Gundam Pilots retreive their mobile suits, and finally atian peace?
This DVD features both the movie version and 3-episode OVA version of Endless Waltz. It also contains bothe english and japanese languages.

1394253,5,B000055XAA,"Ill start out truthful. DONT SEE IT IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE SERIES. This DVD will confuse you because you may not understand the characters, what they are like, and what happened in the series. If you see this all of the falshbacks will make no sense to many people and the end result is that you will end up confused in the end. Dont get me wrong, this is a great moive, OVA, whatever you want to call it, but see the series first!!! If you do not you will not understand the DVD. Now if you are a researcher and have researched it on the internet and have learned the characters and the plot, then take a shot. THIS WILL BE MOST ENJOYABLE IF YOU SEE THE SERIES FIRST. This is an awesome movie and lives up to the serie, but i found that the ending was kind of disappointing considering how some of the characters change, i guess for the better. Then you still have that hokey credits ending. why doesnt he just spit out what he feels and let it go from there!! oh well, nothing perfect but this is an excellant buy and i have enjoyed it much.",982540800,,1045,4.127450980392157

The interactive menus are eye candy, it includes previews of other anime published by Bandia, has a small gundam art gallery and encyclopidia, and features the OAV and Movie versions of the film (The difference between the two being a little bit extra footage here and there).  The story goes like this: The gundam pilots send their gundams into the sun because there is no need for them anymore. Emerging from a colony, a girl that claims to be Treize's daughter, along with a powerful military force guided by her grandfather, seizes the earth in its new state of peace.

For starters, it comes in a holographic case with wing zero on the front, and the details along with a pic of the pilots on the back.  the DVD itself contains the three OAV's with chapter selection, and the movie with extra scenes added and chapter selection as well.  this is good because the movie contains a good 20-30 minutes that isn't in the OAV's.  it is all uncut, so expect some blood here and there.  it also contains an extra features menu which has a ""gundam encyclopediea"" which shows pic's of all the gundams in the movie, along with a brief description and specs on them.  there is a photo gallery, and an option to see the ""textless endings""  the menus are fully animated, and the sound quality is great.",982108800,5,880,4.388888888888889

1394259,5,B000055XAA,"This is by far the best Gundam anime I've ever seen.  Basically, everything is there.  You have the conflict, action, drama, and suspense all tied together in one great movie.  I've watched other Gundam series such as Gundam 0080 ""War in the Pocket"" and Gundam 0083 ""Star Dust Memory"", but this one is unique of all two combined.  They blended conventional animation with computer graphics and this is why it is so good. The mechanics of all Gundams were meticulously done down to the smallest detail. The designs of all five Gundams are not the same as we've seen in Gundam W TV Series.  If I were to do a critique to the designes of these Gundams, I'd say they are brilliantly created.  Hajime Katoki, the mechanical designer of Gundam W Endless Waltz did it again. Last but not the least, the plot of the story somewhat relates to our history.  History is indeed like an Endless Waltz.  ""The three beats of War, Peace, and Revolution continue on forever.""
The story starts by showing the battle in space we've all seen in the last episodes of the Gundam W TV edition. All five Gundams were shown doing each its own battles. After the war, peace was acquired and a new government is established. This is the Earth's Sphere Alliance and this government is funding a special agency called Preventers.  The Preventers job is to basically maintain peace throughout the earth and it's neighboring space colonies. Since peace was acquired, the Gundam pilots do away with their Gundams by sending them straight to the sun to be destroyed. But what everyone don't know is deep into space another breed of conflict is brewing. Dekim Barton and his puppet Mariemeia has something up their sleeves.  They wanted to commence the real Operation Meteor which is to dropped space colony X-18999 to earth and conquer it. Once again the Gundam pilots are called into action, but they don't have their Gundams to help them.  Heero and Duo have the improvise by using the space Leos to do battle as they infiltrate space colony X-18999.  Quatre's job was to retrieve the space resource disposal where their Gundams are.  Trowa went undercover as a Mariemeia soldier to deceive those around him so that he be able to get access to the space colony stability control system and stop the whole Operation Meteor (brilliant plan!!!).  Wu Fei however, was a Mariemeia soldier so he betrayed his fellow Gundam pilots. He wanted to know Mariemeia's plots and plans with Earth so he went along with her campaign of destruction.....
There's alot more to this movie, but I don't want to tell it all.  If you are curious enough to ask for more, I'd say go buy the movie and you'll live to tell all about it.",981504000,3,2678,4.680170575692964
1394260,5,B000055XAA,"Hello, Darth-Jeyl here about to review the Endless Waltz DVD a little bit early before it's release date.
Introduction:  After watching all 49 episodes of Gundam wing, I couldn't help but feel really disappointed after the series ended. Almost everything that I predicted would happen in the episodes happened. Herro ended up being the hero of the show, none of the Gundam pilots died, almost every favorite character of mine died (Except for Zechs, thank goodness), the ending is one of the worst endings I've ever seen in a series, and Herro was called ""The heart of outer space"". My comments on that quote, pointless. When I heard about a sequel to the series, I wasn't really interested. I didn't really care about the Gundam pilots anymore, but when I heard that Zechs was going to be in it, I decided to give it a try. After watching the 3 episodes on CN, I was stunned. There's a lot more focus on some of the minor characters of the film. the Gundam pilots are a lot more likable than they were in the series (I was actually routing for Herro at certain points!), Zechs makes one heck of a return, and the ending was very satisfying. Now on to the main review.
Story:  AC (After Colony) 196. One year has passed since the end of the Gundam wing series. Thanks to the Gundams and their allies, peace has finally been achieved between the colonies and the Earth sphere. The Gundam pilots, knowing that they have no need for their Gundams, decide to send them into the sun to be destroyed. Suddenly, a certain colony has declared war against the Earth sphere for total control over both the Earth and the colonies. With a vast army of deadly mobil suits, Relena Darlian as their prisoner, and Gundams at their side, total peace is soon to be destroyed. Now the remaining Gundam pilots and their allies wage war against the evil forces not to win battles, but to end them forever.  Let me point out by saying that this is a true sequel to the original Gundam wing series, and not an alternate universe deal. The reason why I say this is because the upgraded Gundams are used in the flashbacks as if they were always built that way. Well let me tell you, everything that happened in the series happened in Endless Waltz. All the Gundams were upgraded after the war, but never saw combat. So if you think that wing zero still used it's bird mode after it destroyed the libra, you're right. Trust me, the series wouldn't be right if the Gundams had all that firepower they had in Endless Waltz. The only reason I can think of about why they used them in the flashbacks was probably to avoid any confusion to newcomers. The same goes for the beginning during the battle of Libra. They probably used the updated Gundams there to show the experienced viewers how much they've gotten better. Just look at that Heavy Arms Custom!
The DVD:  The DVD version of Endless Waltz is, to my standards, quite excellent. It comes packed with materials enough to satisfy almost every fan of anime.  There are two versions of the film presented here on this DVD. There's the OVA version, which consists of all 3 episodes in their uncut format. All three episodes have a beginning and an end to them, which means credits during all the white reflection parts. The movie version of the film is also included on the disc. The difference between this version and the OVS version are huge. They do more than just add scenes into the film. Most of the music that was in the OVA version has been changed significantly in the movie version. White reflection is nowhere in this version. Some of the action sequences have been redone with a lot more faster, smoother animation. There are a few scenes altered from the OVA version. A few new scenes are included in the movie version that really add more to the the story and is more satisfying than the OVAs. The big difference between the two versions is in endings. Each character has the same ending like in the OVA's, but are put into different situations. Between these two versions, I prefer the movie edition. It provides a lot more entertainment than the OVA's without the stops, breaks, and credits. The music is better used in the movie version as well. Don't forget that both of the versions are uncut.  For the look and feel of the DVD, we get the works. The menus for the DVD are animated and awesome. For the main menu, we are greeted with Wing zero when it first starts up. After the pose pauses, the buttons are revealed. Every time you press a button on the main menu, Wing Zero flies away you go to the next menu. The menus are very easy to navigate through, and are highly interactive.  For the presentation of this disc, impressive. The video quality on the DVD is excellent. The animation is clear, very smooth, and the colors are very solid. There are some very minor signs of grain visible at certain points of the film, but are not at all distracting.  The audio is a big bonus. We get an English 5.1 audio, another English 2.0 audio, and a Japanese 2.0 audio. The Japanese track works on both versions, but the English tracks are split up. The movie version has the 5.1 English track, while the OVA has the 2.0 English track. Though the Japanese track is only 2.0, it still packs a punch. If you have a 5.1 set up, play the English version of the movie. It Rocks!
Features:  The features on this disc are pretty good for an anime title. We get an MS encyclopedia that gives us descriptions on the major MS used in Endless Waltz, including nice pictures of them seen in Endless Waltz. The Gallery feature is pretty useless. we only get 5 pictures that have almost nothing to do with Endless Waltz (Though I think the one with the battered up Wing Zero is pretty cool). The Textless Endings are a real treat. They show the clips from the OVA episodes that involve the ""White Reflection"" music without any subtitles or credits. The trailer section consist of previews for ""Gundam 0083"", ""Cowboy Bebop"", ""Crest of the stars"", and ""Outlaw Star"".
Final Comments:  Well, I've waited for this DVD for quite sometime, I'm glad I was able to watch it and review it before it was released. Even though I didn't enjoy the series that much, Endless Waltz is one of my all time favorite anime titles. It makes Gundam Wing a lot more likable. For those of you who plan on buying it, I recommend it completely. You will be very satisfied.
Goods: Nice transfer, Excellent sound, Entertaining story, satisfying package, cool animated menus,  not to mention good dubbing job.
Bads: None

1394261,5,B000055XAA,"I thought that endless waltz was the best gundam movie/episodes there ever was, to bad its the last of the series but it sure did go out with a bang.  The ending was the best part with heero in his wing zero blasting the base. I also liked the part where they show you what happened to the gundam pilots after the war was over. If your goin to buy any gundam dvd or vhs make sure you buy this one.",981072000,,397,3.9012345679012346
1394262,5,B000055XAA,"...but what an ending! Told mostly through flashbacks, the story of Endless Waltz is rock-solid. If you're a fan of the series, this explains the characters backgrounds and how they came to be, which is quite interesting (Trowa's origin, for example, was not only interesting, it's shocking). If you're new to Gundam Wing, well... it wouldn't be the best place to start... and at the same time, it would be if you don't want to sit through all those episodes (which is why I liked the flashbacks: I can show it to my friends and they wouldn't be left out in the cold as to what's going on in the film). Whenever you try to get someone's interest in a series, it's not always easy: nobody really has time to sit through a whole set of tapes/DVDs, and that's if you even have them; and when you try to show them a movie inspired from the series, they know nothing of the characters, and it seems that most movies expect that you already do (take, for example, Tenchi Forever: you can't show that to a first-time Tenchi viewer, as it wouldn't quite register [i.e., no explanation as to how the characters came about]). But, like I said, Endless Waltz gives you a whole background of the characters through the flashbacks, yet, doesn't take away from those that have followed the series--no easy feet. So what's the story here? Taking off a year after the Gundam Wing series ended, Mariemeia--the illegitimate daughter of  deceased war leader, OZ chief Treize Krushrenada--has made plans to become the ruler of the new nation--thus taking over Earth and the Space Colonies. Obviously, this isn't good; it's, as the movie said, ""An endless waltz of peace, war, and revolution."" And obviously, our heroes aren't taking this lightly, either. Past villians are now good guys, the characters are more emotional than ever, and the battle scenes are the best in the entire Gundam Wing series--in fact, I honestly felt this was the peak of everything to the series: the characters have more depth, the story is at its finest, and the battle scenes are beyond amazing. If you've seen any of the episodes, you already know about dubbing: it's perfect. Very few anime titles I'll say I actually loved the dubbing, but the whole Gundam Wing series is just great. The animation is a bit dated (it was made quite awhile back), but the detail is still sharp. I'll be honest... the first time I seen Gundam Wing, I didn't care for it--I'm a Macross/Robotech fan, and I'll always fell that Macross/Robotech is king when it comes to mecha in anime... but I started liking it after awhile, and I truly feel that this movie represents all of Gundam Wing at its finest. Endless Waltz is a great, action-packed, anime movie that, hopefully, will get the success it truly deserves--definitely do not pass this up when its release day comes.",981072000,22,2813,4.705882352941177

The best is that the daughter of a dead war leader is now positioning herself to lead an army to take over the planet earth, and the space colonies, as well.

1394266,5,B000055XAA,"The year is After Colony 195. Peace rules under the Earthsphere Alliance. To maintain peace humans have created giant human like robots called Mobile Suits. Mobile Suits have many abilties such as guns, sabers, axes, hooks, you name it. But masked deep within the Earthsphere Alliance is another group, a group of evil named OZ. OZ's goal is to take over the world for peace, if it means certain death. Operation Meteror, 5 Moble Suits are sent to Earth to stop OZ, with the exception that these Mobile Suits are special. With Heero Yuy (Wing Gundam and Wing Gundam Zero), Duo Maxwell (Gundam Deathscythe and Gundam Deathscythe Hell), Chang Wufei (Gundam Shenlong and Gundam Altron), Trowa Barton (Gundam Heavyarms), and Quatre Winner (Gundam Sandrock) and their Mobile Suits they are sent to stop OZ. In the end the pilots win and with the death of OZ's leader, Trieze Khushrenada, the earth is returned to peace.
X-mas Eve After Colony 196. One year has passed with peace returned until Maremia tries to take over the world, her last name, Khushrenada. As she tries to take over the world with Dekim Barton (sound fammiliar?) they attempt the real Operation Meteror, to drop a Space Colony onto Earth. With the help of the same pilots and new Mobile Suits (Wing Gundam Zero Custom, Gundam Deathscythe Hell Custom, Gundam Nataku, Gundam Heavyarms Kai, and Gundam Sandrock Kai) they must stop the new evil and the Evil new Mobile Suits, the Serphent Customs.
After Colony 197, you find out.
Interesting huh? Yep, is. Many people get confused by Gundam, they say it is a stupid cartoon, but they are wrong. In Endless Waltz many things happen, people learn love, harmony, and the love of life, even a single life. I say, along with the other writers, that this is one of the best animes there is, and with a great movie added to it, it makes the entire series from Universel Century 0079 to After Colony 197 the perfect anime. I have said enough, I think you need to watch it to feel the emotion put into the movie.",978134400,,2014,4.692090395480226
1394267,5,B000055XAA,"Endless Waltz continues the Gundam Wing series and answers many questions about the characters pasts and thier possible futures.  In addition it introduces the 'custom' Gundams, our familiar Wing Zero, Dethscythe Hell, HeavyArms, Sandrock and Shenlong/Nataku... with newer and better weapons and designs.  Also, the animation quality of Endless Waltz is mush higher than that of the show.  From what I've heard about this DVD it contains the 2 OAV episodes (strung together by Cartoon Network to make a 'movie') /and/ the special edition movie with extra scenes (Dorothy!!)  Also, like the other DVDs, it allows you to watch with the Japanese audio track rather than the english dub.  If you've seen the show and had questions about what happens next this DVD is a must have!",977184000,14,775,5.070866141732283

It's confusing at first watch, but if you watch it again, you'll understand it. Just trust me, it's just as good or better than the Gundam Wing series. WHY CAN'T GUNDAM WING BE AS LONG AS DRAGONBALL Z!?!?!",977011200,,354,4.725806451612903
1394269,5,B000055XAA,"I am not an extreme Gundam Wing fan and I don't like the TV series all that much.  But this movie, it was EXELLENT!  The story if really good even you don't know much about Gundam Wing.  It explains some things about the Gundam pilot's pasts and it also zips up the ending of the Gundam Wing series.  The animation is very good.  This movie is a must have for any anime fan and Gundam Wing fan.",976665600,,394,4.064935064935065
1394270,5,B000055XAA,"There were two men who were key parts of Gundam Wing: Oorinawa and Katoki.  Oorinawa's mechanical designs for the Gundams were used in the television series.  However, Hajime Katoki had other designs, which were less conservative and more ornate.  Therefore, it lived up to the reputation anime has possessed for the past twenty-odd years. Katoki's designs were incorporated into the Gundam W OVA, or what we Americans know as ""Endless Waltz.""  Though not his originals, the OVA versions give off a more menacing impression, while being beautiful at the same time. Endless Waltz is much shorter, and much more direct than the series.  However, despite the sudden changes in scene and tempo, you seem to get it all in there.  If you don't, there's ""Gundam W Episode Zero,"" which provides a more intense background into the pilots' lives.  I'm sure Amazon's got it around here somewhere... Still, If you are familiar with Gundam Wing, or Mobile Suit Gundam in general, I highly suggest that you pick up this item. It's worth the money",976579200,,1032,4.930635838150289
