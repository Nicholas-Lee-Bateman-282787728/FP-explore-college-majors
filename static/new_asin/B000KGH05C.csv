8156813,5,B000KGH05C,If swordsmanship is what you seek-look no further. David Chiang is one of the all-time greats from the Run Run Shaw repertory company.,1391817600,,134,4.869565217391305
8156814,3,B000KGH05C,"Five Shaw Brothers' releases after ""Have Sword, Will Travel"", David Chiang was back as another wandering swordsman in...""The Wandering Swordsman"". With no Ti Lung in sight, Chiang manages well as a ""Robin Hood-type"";  with all his leaps and jumps, plus an air of arrogance that's best described as naive, it's inevitable to also refer to him as a ""Peter Pan"" who DOESN'T spread peanut butter with that blade! There is an otherworldly feel to this, in contrast to ""HS,WT""; watch the Image DVD, and see what I mean (no spoilers)! Some might feel a slight letdown from the first viewing (as I did); follow-up showings will help to put the plot together in your mind. Considering that director Chang Cheh's David Chiang/Ti Lung classic ""Vengeance!"" was coming around the bend, a lot of the filmmaking techniques Cheh used here seem like warm-ups to the previously-mentioned film. By comparison, does this mean ""TWS"" is a minor effort? It all depends on how you accept the script. Good performances help what would have come off as much WORSE if done by lesser talents. It's essential for Chiang/Cheh fans; others might buy at their own risk. Otherwise, wait for Image or some other US company to pick up the rights to the superior ""Vengeance!""....Yours, Brother Fang.",1259193600,3,1263,4.929577464788732
8156815,5,B000KGH05C,"So this is the one where David Chiang smiles a lot, and floats through the air often, hehe, great movie actually.  David Chiang steals from criminals but never gives it back to the original owners.  Instead he gives it away to whomever he encounters by chance that might need it.  He is tricked by the ancient Chinese version of a criminal mastermind and utlimately must go to any length to right his wrongs.  Great humor, great action, great villains, great direction -- I suppose I was surprised not to see Ti Lung in this but he wasn't needed.  Anyone who actually wandered by this page needs to see it.  I'd give it a 4.5 rating but am rounding up.",1245283200,,652,4.436974789915967
