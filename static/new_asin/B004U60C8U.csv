8441194,5,B004U60C8U,A historic season for auburn all the great games from 2010 also includes the sec championship the bcs title game is not include my favorite game is the cam back down 24-0 vs the crappy tide and one of the greatest comebacks of all time auburn storms back and wins 28-27. Who cares if it was a couple of yrs ago it's still one of the greatest iron bowls ever played next to the kick Bama kick,1436832000,,391,4.090909090909091

8441196,5,B004U60C8U,I bought this for my son-in-law for Christmas and he seemed to like it very much.  He's a big Auburn fan.  I think it made a great gift.,1353542400,,136,3.8214285714285716
8441197,5,B004U60C8U,"I ordered the Auburn: 2010 The Perfect Season for an avid Auburn fan.  I got nervous when it was backordered!  But, all things worked out really well because I received it in time for Christmas!! Yeah!  War Eagle!",1328400000,,213,4.552631578947368
8441198,5,B004U60C8U,Me and my mother ordered this for my brother for christmas and we think he will like it just wished it was in blue ray,1323216000,,118,3.76
8441199,5,B004U60C8U,"Even though it took over a month to ship, due to being backorder, it was worth the wait.  Included all the games except the championship in a nice compact case small enough to fit in a DVD cabinet.  All disks are labeled as shown with name, date, and score.  Actual full length game footage with no commercials. Not blu-ray/HD resolution but very good.",1314835200,,352,4.555555555555555
8441200,5,B004U60C8U,"For all of you Auburn fans who are wondering if this box set is worth it, wonder no more.  Once you put the DVD in, it feels like the game is actually being played right now.  In my opinion the quality is great.  For those of you who had that ""this is going to be a great year"" feeling while watching Auburn's games this year, those memories are relived in this box set.  Plus, there are all of those amazing games and plays that are unforgettable.  Case leaves a lot to be desired, and like everyone else says, the championship game is not included.  However, the DVDs make those inconveniences hardly worth mentioning.  Most Auburn fans probably already have the Championship DVD anyway.  You won't be disappointed with this purchase.",1310342400,4,736,4.607692307692307
8441201,5,B004U60C8U,"This offer doesn't include the championship game. I have seen all 14 games available elsewhere on-line for $108 or so (hint: think Bentonville), but this is still a great deal for the 13 games. They are all from the actual TV broadcasts (e.g. ESPN, FOXSS, CBS - not AU Network). But the picture is misleading.",1303344000,10,309,4.636363636363637
8441202,5,B004U60C8U,"Doesn't include the BCS game with Oregon - doesn't make this a bad deal, but it is a terribly misleading picture!

Otherwise, this is a fantastic set.  True live broadcasts, with one small error that I could find (clipped the 2nd quarter in an early game).  Otherwise, you are lucky to get Verne Lunquist and Gary Danelsion on many of the broadcasts (ESPN on a couple) who both manage to call the game fantastically well and objectively too.  Plus, it is a real treat to watch Danelsion's increasing awe each week at Cam Newton's abilities.  And speaking of Newton, the collective plays in this DVD are nothing sort of incredible.  While Auburn was far from a one-man team, Newton's abilities to run at will at times with his increasing comfort with passing the ball made this a truly amazing Heisman winning performance.

lastly, and just a minor comment, but watching this in sequence makes you realize why Auburn was so much better than Oregon in the title game (and it says something to Oregon's grit that they managed to tie that game late) - the opposing QB was the difference.  Put a strong passer in the backfield and Auburn was going to have trouble, but Oregon's inability to either block Fairley and company and throw accurate passes absolutely doomed them.

Buy this set - you'll be glad you did, esp. since most of the games are incredibly interesting...",1302393600,3,1367,4.7100840336134455
