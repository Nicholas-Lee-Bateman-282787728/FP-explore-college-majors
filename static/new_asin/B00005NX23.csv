The movie is really good, but I think the dvd is missing an important scene of the 2 main characters after they get together. This scene occurs right before the main actor leaves to finish his education in Seoul.

The morally uplifting romance is a nice enough story-and you find yourself rooting for Chunhyang and Mongryong-but the story is secondary to the way it is told. Using the device of a modern traditional Korean storyteller to narrate the poem behind the story was a stroke of genius. The cinematography takes it one step further. I am not one to buy films to watch over and over, normally I rent them and that's that, but I had to have this one. It is unforgettable!",1195603200,,666,5.8061224489795915
1638250,5,B00005NX23,"The screen starts dark, with a man howling.

After a moment, we see a performer on stage, alone with a drummer. He sings or chants roughly as he goes through the gestures of a kind traditional performance I've never seen before. The uniqueness of it fascinates me, even though I can't follow the ritual meanings and Korean language. Then, the movie begins ...

The story tells of a classical romance. The lovers marry in secret, despite the vast social gulf between them. Then the man must leave, following governmental duty. She stays behind, awaiting his return. While he's gone, a corrupt governor hears of her beauty and commands her to be his concubine. Even under torture, she remains true to her husband, who returns to save her just in the nick of time. Virtue and loyalty find their reward, with tasteful hints of marital love reminding us of the rewards that adults can give to each other.

But through it all, the chanting narrator continues telling the tale. Once in a while, the characters playing the roles in the story break into that narrative chant, too. The result becomes a unique blend of an ancient performing heritage with modern movie-making. I'm sure that people who know the tradition find even more in it than I do, but understanding isn't necessary. Romance and honor transcend culture, and the unfamiliar performing style creates a tantalizing sense that more is shown than I can see.

1638251,2,B00005NX23,"i'm not sure i learned enough interesting things watching this movie to justify the time.
First, it is very culturally dependent. The way it is delivered is a particular Korean story telling procedure, without command of the language (subtitles don't make it with this movie) and some cultural sensitivity, the technique is boring.
Secondly, the story is very Confucian, probably very Korean as well, but i simply don't know enough about the genre in Korea to be sure.
The plot is simple enough.
Boy sees girl, boy wants girl, boy seduces girl with various promises, boy leaves for big city, 3 years pass and local bigwig wants girl.
She resists on the grounds that she is married. Bigwig promises to execute her if she doesn't submit to his will. Boy makes good on exams, returns and sets everything right.

Curiously, we really don't have this story in Western culture, the closest i can think of is Robin Hood. With doctrines like that of ""rebellion under lesser magistrates"", the West has concentrated on affirming the right of local government officials to adhere to principles and resist larger political powers. Something very effected by our individualism and elevation of the individual as the basic unit of society. As the movie makes explicit the story is about serving two masters, the local government official or her husband.

There are lots of stories about the virtuous but poor women defending their honor from grasping and powerful people, but this story comes across less as sexual (for she really submits pretty quicker to the boy) and more about the conflict with the Confucian hierarchy of greater/lesser relationships. This hierarchy of power is from servant, to husband-wife, to elder brother and younger, to father-son and finally to levels of government-local, provincial, central state kingship. I believe that Confucian is a top down structure with greater power to the higher levels. But besides this is the closeness-distance relationship as well, from husband-wife up to subject-king. The story is about how this structure can collide internally, with several layers claiming to be dominant.

The visuals are stunning, the acting is a bit wooden and stiff, the dialog via the subtitles is junk. If you have an interest in Korean culture perhaps that is enough to tip the balance towards watching the movie. As is, i found it boring with little to think about.",1189036800,3,2390,5.045569620253165
1638252,1,B00005NX23,I found the singing in the soundtrack so utterly intolerable that I had to quit watching this after about 20% of the video. The movie seemed like it would have been nice otherwise (about a 4). The sound of the singing was very grating & harsh to my ears; since it was almost continous it made watching the video impossible. It also seemed to add little to the film in terms of content. The photography & art direction were exquisite.,1177200000,,433,4.425
1638253,4,B00005NX23,"The story was beautiful.  I really enjoyed the simplicity of the story and the beauty of its surroundings.

But, I can't sit through this again.  The singing narrator was so irratating!  The narrating part should have been editted out and maybe re-done with a simple english narration (for the DVD to be released in america, anyway).

But anyway, let's look at the message behind this film:

Marriage is God's law.  A woman reduced to the humiliated role of a courtesan (right from birth), is the sick decision of insecure men who've managed to achieve the seat of power over the people.  No man should ever think that he's above God's laws.  Especially a man in a leadership role.

If a governor, or any man given the distinguished role of leading the people, should decide that a woman is a courtesan first, then a married woman second, should not even be in that seat of power.  He should be executed before the people he terrifies.  Or at least, be abruptly removed from office, publicly disgraced before the media.

Chunhyang did the right thing to resist Governor Byun, and the Governor should have had his own constituants arrest him for his selfish ungodly-worthy intentions.

But, apart from the narrator, everything else about this film is what we all truly love about an asian love tragedy.  I'll give this film a ""thumbs out"".  But not entirely, a ""thumbs up"", nor a ""thumbs down"".

Definately worth renting once, but I couldn't sit through this again.",1157846400,,1464,4.768924302788845
1638254,3,B00005NX23,"This is a good film but completely non-original.  It's basically a Korean version of Homer's ""The Odyssey.""  Husband leaves.  Wife gets harrassed and afflicted.  Husband returns to take revenge.",1150502400,,194,5.586206896551724
1638255,4,B00005NX23,"I love the combination of Pansorri and movie storytelling.  I'd give it 5 stars, but 1) the acting is a wee bit over-the-top in spots (young actors, I suppose), and 2), the actress who plays Chunhyang in this film is rather uncharacteristically plain to play a character from Korean tradition who was noted as being particularly beautiful.  The Pansorri (a traditional Korean form of storytelling something like a cross between opera and rap...hehehe) is fantastic, though!

Anyway.  It's a wonderful film young couples, in particular, should see--and learn from.  Chunhyang is primarily the story of the devotion of a wife to her husband in spite of separation and pain of torture and impending death.  It could also be said to be a story of the devotion of a husband to his wife, given the realities of the times the story was set and the events that unfold.",1141084800,5,860,4.816326530612245
1638256,3,B00005NX23,"mixed with 1% korean ingredient. what a boring cliched story:

the son of the rich and powerful governor fell for a country girl with a courtesan mother, and he forced her to accept his love and lust on the first night when they met under the roof of her mother's. their secret and lustful love came to an end when the son got to move to the capital, and then along came another powerful new governor tried to force upon her obedience. the low class girl endured the torture but never gave in. then her young lover passed the spelling bee test and became the champion, the special emissary of the king, went back, punished the bad guys, rescued his love. but even so and so, he's still trying to tease his lover before letting her know who's coming to town to make up their lost days together.

endless blah, blah, blah....from a famous professional reciter, with a harsh and horrible voice, annoying, bothering and disturbing tone and tune. but if you could call the hip-hops being songs and music, what else could not be tolerated? the only difference is a drum beaten by a single stick instead of boomboxed loud vibration.

1638257,5,B00005NX23,"It seems that many people think that a woman is totally suject

under male-dominant society. Under Confucious order, Korea

was male dominant society and woman did not appropriate rights

and opportunity as man. So what? in 17th or 18th century,

European men did not allow or share their rights with European

women, either.

The reason why some feminists enjoy this film is that not only

this story is love story, which may make them feel guilty, but

also it's a story of a woman who was not submissive to local

authority. You can compare this movie with Dagerous Beauty in

which a Venezian courtesan could not challenge the authority.

For me, the great scene is the magistrate's interrogation and

torture to Chunhyang. In this scene, Chunhyang did give up and

said what she thought againt brutal magistrate's demand.

""You are a daughter of a courtesan, so you are a courtesan, too.

You should serve to me. It's a law. If you will not follow the

law, I will punish you. ""

1638258,3,B00005NX23,"Chunhyang is as real as Romeo and Juliet. The only difference is that R&J was written by W. Shakespeare, while the Chunhyang was more a folklore. Both are works of fiction. It is told in a pansori, an opera/singwritten form which is accompanied by a tradional Korean Drum.

Of course, the singing style is bizarre, even grating to many viewers and this will critically distract the foreign viewer.

The story takes place in feudal times (17th century) where the son of a governor (Mongyoung Lee) decides to take a small trip to a Korean monument, taking a break from his studies to become a government bureaucrat (where the prestige jobs are back then). There he meets Chunhyang, a daughter of a courtesan (an ancient version of a paid mistress or concubine) and falls in love. After a few meetings, they get married (blink and you miss the wedding ceremony). The problem is that according to ancient Korean law, a man of nobility and a lower class woman cannot get married. M. Lee's father and mother hear of this and object and when his father is posted in Seoul (a promotion from the outer provinces), he sends his son ahead to get him out of Cholla Province (where the story is set). Mongyoung promises Chunhyang that he will return after he finishes the entrance exams for his profession.

Three years later, a new regional governor comes and he immediately fancies Chunhyang as his new courtesan. She refuses, since she is already married and offends the governor. He is corrupt and jails her immediately. She becomes a symbol for the plight of her village. Meanwhile, Mongyoung has scored top in his class and becomes the King's lead investigator. In his travel back to Cholla Province, he learns of the Governors corruption and plans to execute Chunhyang for her defiance of him. He sets a plan to rescue her.

The story is slow to get going and the director gives a lot of time for the audience to get to know both Mongyoung and Chunhyang. The female lead is the critical character and she shows raw emotions as the devoted wife. The actor playing Mongyoung also does a good job, but neither is groundbreaking. The narrative is also good, but can get confusing since the Pansori is chock full of metaphors.

The Pansori is the weak point. The movie takes the form of a visual retelling of a korean operatic Pansori, but they do not match. The visualization overtakes and overwhelms the Pansori and at the end the Pansori becomes the intrusive narrative. This is evident when Chunhyang gets tortured by the new governor. As she is tortured, we are suddenly switched back to the modern Pansori and her tortured screams are mouthed by the singer (who barks and shouts and is a man). All emotional intensity is lost to the movie-viewing audience. The directing is well done, but this is a character driven movie and the director does a good job staying in the background.

Overall, this movie is appealing to those who love Pansori. Those who find it grating and intrusive (as myself) to the visual narrative will ultimately find this movie frustrating and overly boring....Rating: C",1120694400,,3088,4.751865671641791
1638259,5,B00005NX23,"This is one of the most beautiful and delectably edited movies I've ever seen.  The actors know their roles wholeheartedly.  My guess they are classically-trained theatre actors.  Chunhyang is one of Korea's 5 stories told in the oral tradition, and was originally for adults.  Pansori, if you've ever taken a class or tried it, is very difficult.  Requires power from the diaphragm and vocal range.  Once, there were 7 of us in a class, and all together, the power of our voices could not top the sole instructor. Im Kwon-taek was smart to incorporate the pansori.  For those of you who don't know, there is no Chunhyang the tale without pansori, so it's absolutely necessary to this movie.  ""Chunhyang-ga"" is by balladeer Jo Sang-Hyeon, also known as National Intangible Asset #5.

My dvd said it's Japanese.  Someone should be fired for not fact-checking.  Also, it's nothing like Raise the Red Lantern or Zhang Yimou.  But westerners need to write that to make it relative to their prior movie experience.  Chunhyang is a beautiful story of poetry and honor and meditation.  It's about love's fidelity.",1117497600,18,1106,4.940217391304348
1638260,3,B00005NX23,"I like the Pansori style of drama, and thought this was a neat approach to telling the story. It's certainly better than if the film had just focused on the very simple, one-note plot. BUT: some reviews, not to mention the back of the DVD box, compare this film to ""Raise the Red Lantern."" It's not even close. RRL is a complex and subtle psychodrama where human emotions and conflicts are central, and nothing is as it seems. Chunhyang is a simple little Confucian morality tale--nothing more, nothing less. But there's really not much plot to speak of: boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love (after some ambiguous scenes where he seems to be having sex with her against her will), boy and girl are torn apart by fate, boy and girl have happy ending. The characters are 2-dimensional, and at times inconsistent--he alternates between being a passionate lover and an egomaniacal jerk, and she's the ideal sweet, longsuffering, patient Korean woman, except when she's having hysterical temper tantrums. Mom and the Governor get only one dimension apiece, and are more like puppets than people. It's a visually beautiful film, with a nice dose of Korean art and culture, but I probably won't watch it again.",1116806400,2,1208,4.8125
1638261,5,B00005NX23,"Every review I've read here (even the positive ones) are looking at the film from the wrong angle.  This isn't some flick with a superfluous narrator obnoxiously singing over the regular dialogue, the singer is the most important part of the movie.  The traditional Korean singing is called Pansori, and Chunhyang is one of five stories in the traditional Pansori repertoire.  The poorly written dialogue one of you criticized was actually not written, but rather passed down over a much longer time than I'd be qualified to guess at.  The whole point of this film is just to add a visual element to a traditionally oral story.  This is one of the only movies I've ever actually cringed watching, and it wouldn't have affected me at all without the singer.  Buy it, it's really powerful.",1113609600,8,787,4.792592592592593
1638262,5,B00005NX23,I love this epic movie.  I first saw it on The Sundance Channel.  What drew me to watch the movie was the cinematography showing a beautiful landscape of a bed of roses and a couple passionately making love.  I had to see what this movie was about.  The story was told to an audience in present day Korea going back to another century picturing the landscape of Korea before.  The love between two persons from different backgrounds made this an interesting watch because the son of a governor would be married to someone of his rank but he chose to be with the daughter of a courtesan.  Chunhyang stood by her faith refusing to succumb to a cruel governor.  If death is what one has to go through then so be it.  Chunhyang is a greatly portrayed epic of love and fidelity.,1099094400,6,773,4.394366197183099

1638267,4,B00005NX23,"I was pretty torn in my final analysis of this film.  On the one hand, I loved this film for its colourful and poetic cinematography.  The girls in the film were beautiful, and who doesn't like to look at beautiful girls in beautiful costumes?  But I felt guilty for enjoying this film because as a feminist this story clearly doesn't reinforce feminist values, but rather, traditional, patriarchal values that seem to characterize Korea even up until this day.  Sure, Chunhyang might seem like a heroine for choosing to face death to protect her virtue, but why should this be her defining moment?  And I didn't like how Mongryong was able to pluck her out of crowd and take her for his wife like she were just some object for the taking.  To me this reinforces man's desire, man's pleasure, and the preeminence of man.  Although, on the other hand, Chunhyang clearly finds pleasure in sex with Mongryong, and in this way finds comfort in her own sexuality.  Nevertheless, Chunhyang's life revolves around Mongryong and more importantly, she has no personhood or value so long as she is unmarried.  In this context, the film seems pretty shallow and empty.  But of course, if you get past the feminist agenda (that women deserve personhood in their own right, regardless of whoever's daughter or wife they are, and that women have their own desires outside of masculine constructions), this film is wonderful eyecandy.  The historical setting also provides a glimpse into traditional Korea, although I can't say how accurate everything was.",1067299200,4,1541,4.934108527131783
1638268,5,B00005NX23,"All I can say this movie is SUPERB!! No wonder it got the Cannes Palm D'Or in 2000. The story is based on Korean famous legend, Chunhyang who stood for her rights to devote all her love only to 1 man despite of the traditional custom that a decendant courtesan (she was the daughter of a retired courtesan) was a coutesan and must be available in serving other men.
I have been told there was a story like this but have never known the real plot. I feel very lucky to be able to watch this artpiece. As a woman, I really admire ChunHyang and her guts in keeping to her promise and to her heart.
The traditional and moral value of this legend is magnified by the cinematography and the way it is told which presents the story as it was sung by a traditional singer (pansori). Highly recommended.",1057622400,9,794,4.3
1638269,5,B00005NX23,"""Chunhyang"" is living art.  Narrated in the Korean tradition of Pansori in which a story is told through sung verse, it's the timeless classic tale of two young people who fall in love at first sight, are separated through adversity, and come together again.

Chunhyang is the daughter of a courtesan, and in the ancient Korean class system she is therefore considered a courtesan herself, and Mongryong is the son of an upper-class nobleman; they meet, fall in love, and marry secretly.  Mongryong's father, however, has plans for his son that don't include marrying a courtesan's daughter, and the couple has to split up while Mongryong prepares for a state examination.  Chunhyang spends the three years of their separation fighting off the advances of a venal provincial governor; she's about to die for her resistance when her long-lost husband returns to save her.  Virtue has its rewards.

The film succeeds on every count.  The cinematography is splendid, the two young lead actors, both of them teenagers, are excellent, and the haunting tones of the Pansori singer draw us into the film and make us a part of it.  Unlike those reviewers who felt that the singing distracted from the movie, I thought it helped to underscore the ancient tradition of story-telling, a part of so many cultures, in which a tale is narrated through song and verse as well as prose.  We not only enjoy ""Chunhyang"" as a brilliant example of Korean film making, we feel it on a fundamental level as a love story anyone can relate to.  It's a great movie that deserves a much wider audience.

1638270,4,B00005NX23,"This movie was hauntingly beautiful, yet so frustrating to watch at times. The scenes were just breathtaking and the narration read like a poetry with excellent English translation. The costumes were wonderful and true to its time (credits to university professors in Korea).
Unlike other reviewers, I found Pansori singing interesting at first. Unfortunately, I felt that it became too frequent and detracted me from enjoying the story. I found myself turning down the volume and reading the subtitle whenever the Pansori singer appeared later. I'm fairly certain the singer was a designated national treasure in Korea. Still his omnipresence all throughout the movie was overdone.
I also found the two main characters lacking in raw emotional drama. In particular, when Myoung confronts the corrupt governor who wanted to execute Chunhyang for not sleeping with him, he had this nonchalant attitude, asking the soon-to-be ex-governor to understand her reasons for not giving in to his wishes.

Directed by one of Asia's most demanding and feared perfectionist directors, the cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful and, despite the lead characters being played by teenage, first time actors, the acting is flawless. The pansori singing is performed by a man officially designated by the Korean government as a living national treasure. The breathtaking beauty of Korean nature, a powerful story of innocent, true, and undying love, and the haunting vocal tradition of pansori combine to present an experience that I can unreservedly say is far and away the best Asian movie I have seen (rivaled only by ""Ran"") and is high on my list of the best films ever. I have yet to meet someone who was disappointed with this movie.",1003363200,9,833,5.0

7948117,5,B00005NX23,"This is a classic Korean love story from the Joseon period. The scenery and costuming were spectacular. As I said, this story is a narrative performed on stage by 2 individuals, however this was further enhanced by film. It is the devotion of a woman for her absent husband and her steadfast commitment that gets her into trouble particularly since she is from a lower class in Korean society.  This is a definite 2 thumbs up.",1390176000,,426,4.605263157894737
