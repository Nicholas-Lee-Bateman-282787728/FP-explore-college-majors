7948975,4,B00005OOQ4,"If you can't afford a live performance or can't travel to see this is a good alternative, especially if you have a wide screen and/or HD TV.",1371168000,,140,4.222222222222222
7948976,5,B00005OOQ4,"I love everything Cirque du Soleil creates, and plan to be one of their musicians someday.  I have also watched Quidam, and many other shows from the 90's thru 2004.  La Magie Continue is something a true Cirque fan should watch AFTER seeing the newer shows, to really put into perspective how far the organization has really come!  Its really fun to watch the anniversary box set in order by year.  The talent has NEVER been compromised, La Magie has truly talented performers, and many of them are featured in Cirque Reinvente, which was put out just a year later in 1987!

It was really fun to see Cirque SOOO scaled down in La Magie, as far as the stage, props, and costumes are concerned.  GET THE BOX SET, ITS ONLY $100 AND IT INCLUDES 11 DVDS!  You can see for yourself how Cirques' budget grew each year and watch the shows become more and more magical each year!  It seems to me that 1991 was the big turning point for Cirque, and thats when they really ""exploded"" into what new-age Cirque fans would recognize today as being cool, with the addition of there show, Saltimbanco.",1171065600,2,1086,4.505102040816326
7948977,4,B00005OOQ4,"I don't agree that La Magie Continue is boring. There are a couple of acts that didn't hold my interest, but most of the acts were very entertaining. One of the differences between this and the other shows is the lack of a storyline or theme. This is more a succession of acts that are not always connected by a bigger picture (like Quidam or Varekai).  In spite of this it was still fun to watch. My favorite act is the clown conducter. Whoever that guy is, he has the most expressive face and it really adds to his performance.",1165622400,7,529,4.29
7948978,4,B00005OOQ4,"Every time I watch the impressive choreography and set up of this ensemble I keep astonished. It's just like an kinetic overlapping of a disordered puzzle with such new proposals and true challenges for the imagination that you leave the exhibition with a rewarding spirit.

Cirque du soleil makes the most difficult maneuver seem so easy, the brightness, the employment of  the light and the stage makes a must for every human being to presence and delight this superb and remarkable spectacle. I have not had the lucky to watch them in live presence, and I guess it must be glorious and unique experience.

In particular, this is one the most gratifying episodes of this hallucinating visual saga.",1119657600,5,699,4.906779661016949
7948979,3,B00005OOQ4,"If you are not familiar with the Cirque, be aware this is not a DVD about a standard circus that will make happy a 5 years old boy/girl. This is for more mature audiences. It is a piece of art, but not appealing for everyone. It is a mix of theather, circus and state of the art street performances. This is nota David Blaine or David Copperfield DVD! Not for young kids.",1033257600,8,371,4.166666666666667
