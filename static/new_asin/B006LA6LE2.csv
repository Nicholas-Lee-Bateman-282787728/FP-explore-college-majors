5002501,4,B006LA6LE2,"Like everyone knows, who considers to buy this DVD, the content is super fantastic. So I'll focus on the quality.
The DVD's cover and the back of the DVDs itself make a very expensive impression. Each season includes 3 DVDs. I bought all seasons and the first two DVDs of each season had scratches. These haven't been a problem up to now, but I think for 20 USD scratches should be excluded.....
The quality of the episodes itself is good. The DVD menu consists out of and <CHOOSE EPISODE> or something like that. So it isn't very easy to find out which are episodes and which are EXTRAS, but I think this isn't really a problem.
All in all I think it's completly worthy to buy these DVDs because these are only minor problems and the content itself is too good to miss it. I hope they will produce a fourth season.",1329091200,6,815,4.368421052631579

We feel the network change the quality of their programming and went in another direction and we ceased watching any of their shows. Now, wherever we can we're buying the good ones from the past.",1483747200,,343,4.548387096774194

5002516,5,B006LA6LE2,This is an absolutely fantastic series!! I highly recommend it and hope that they renew MYLAATR for a 4th season.,1452470400,,113,4.7
5002517,5,B006LA6LE2,"A shame how this was the last season of this fantastic show! Rob Renzetti and his team wanted to make more seasons and quite possibly a movie! I heard a movie might come out though,just a rumor though. But anyways,this is a great show,I recommend this show to people who love Dexter's Lab or The PowerPuff Girls or maybe even both! It has a very rich art style, great characters, decent plot,etc. Truly one of the more better written of the NickToons,I wish Nick didn't cancel it like if it was yesterday's trash. Nickelodeon sometimes might re-run this show,but the BEST way to watch it whenever you want is to either have the Instant Video versions of this show or the DVDs. Personally,I bought the DVDs because I like to collect things that I love so much.

Yeah,so if you enjoy cartoons like Dexter's Lab or whatever,I recommend that you look into this,it's definitely worth your free-time. The other 2 seasons? They're fab too! I think the only episode I don't really care for or better yet, my least favorite is 'Victim of Fashion'. I felt that was such a filler of an episode, not as bad as many filler episodes I've seen with TV shows,but still,they could have done a little better with that episode. Other than that,my only complaint is the musicals,thankfully,they aren't many. The only one I hear people like so much about is 'But I'am The Robot' from the episode 'I Was a Preschool Dropout' in which Jenny Wakeman aka XJ9 is forced to go back to Kindergarden due to some mistake the Tremorton Principal made, but in the end of that episode, Jenny was ironically forced back into High School. How? Her mother-inventor Dr. Noreen 'Nora' Wakeman had a sketchbook about Jenny's development and showing the teacher that she is indeed designed to act and appear as a normal teenager, albeit being a robot instead of a human.

Anywho,I do love this show so much,but of course it's not the only show I like...there are others....",1441411200,,1933,4.665689149560118
5002518,4,B006LA6LE2,"I loved this show as a kid, and it holds up. The only reason this got a 4 not a 5, is it has no special features and, this is more of a problem with all casing in general, I don't like having to take a disk out to get the next one.",1440460800,,231,3.3773584905660377

5002541,5,B006LA6LE2,"I'm rating this particular disc highly because it contains what I believe to be one of the best episodes in the whole series - ""Escape from Cluster Prime.""

I purchased this with the other two seasons, and I don't regret it one bit. My only problem is that the episodes in season 3 tend to be bittersweet - plot threads from some episodes were left hanging, never to be resolved due to the series' cancellation (Teenage Mutant Ninja Troubles) and they tend to serve as a reminder of what could have been.

Still, the storylines were well written and action packed, the characters are very developed and relatable, and the series overall is very charming and funny at the same time. It's an underrated classic. Buy this and the other two seasons. This is something that, like a fine wine, gets better with age, and is better with company.",1407801600,,837,4.610738255033557
5002542,5,B006LA6LE2,"My kids love this show (8yo girl, 5yo boy) and my daughter likes to draw Jenny. I do have a couple things I sort of am weary about: Firstly there is a large amount of hyper-sexualized robots and plenty of vanity to go around. I like the fact that the female character is the strongest, but she's a robot. Next to Jenny, only male characters are strong and brave while the human females are only concerned with looks and popularity. Other than that it's an enjoyable show to watch, great acting, great plots, evolved characters. Sadly though, in this show only ""nerds"" are interested in school or science which is a horrible idea to plant in young children. I'm constantly reminding my daughter of how wrong the opinions of the children in the show are and misguided their ideas of education are, which is an unfortunate task in a show about science.",1405382400,,849,4.592105263157895

Disc 1 played fine and I'm gonna assume Disc 3 too since it doesn't look weird.

I honestly don't mind MOD DVDs (the Nicktoon ones are the most fairly priced out of all the ones I've seen), but things like this shouldn't be happening. I'll buy this again in a few months hoping this problem is resolved.",1490745600,3,662,4.171875
