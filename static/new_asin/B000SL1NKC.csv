This was adapted from the novel Murder in the White House by Margaret Truman. Its story of murder and intrigue that may have been inspired by actual events but dramatized to make it interesting. The story recalls various political events over the past decades.

A young woman is found murdered in the White House! She was a friend of the Presidents son. But a maintenance worker is arrested for the crime. Could he be a scapegoat? A Washington detective continues his investigation. The Secret Service agents resents his presence there now that a suspect is found. But the investigation goes on. There is a crisis when a AWACS airplane was shot down in North Korea. The military advisor suggests a military raid instead of negotiations. Who ordered that airplane to go into that area? A provocation? The President rejects this advice. Then there is an assassination! That Washington detective and a Secret Servie agent see this and shoot back. [There is a lot of guns and shooting in this movie.]

That detective and SS agent learn the Presidents son was being framed in order to embarrass the President and force him to resign in favor of a man who will take military action against North Korea in spite of the latters alliance with Red China. Can the President be warned before he resigns? Will the good guys win in the end and the bad guys be caught? There is a mention of a Senator who was in a scandal when he had a car accident.

Movies like Executive Action or The Parallax View were better as drama. Watch them and see. All the Presidents Men and JFK are based on true crimes. Seven Days in May is an older movie that asks about intrigue in the White House.",1448928000,,1719,4.571428571428571
