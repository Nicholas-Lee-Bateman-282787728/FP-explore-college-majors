1215562,4,B00000G3O5,"I think it would sell well. In my humble opinion this version of Genghis Khan's life, while probably inaccurate historically, is the best one made. It got the main point of this Conquerers life across with splendid costume, scenery, and action. It had a really honest personal combat scene in which one of the antagonists actually got kicked in the reproductive sector. Real blood and sweat! The only thing missing was Horse Archery.
Please bring it back!? I want a new copy of it.",1033862400,6,481,4.738095238095238
1215563,3,B00000G3O5,"There have been two movies about Genghis Khan, this one and the Howard Hughes stinker ""The Conqueror"" starring John Wayne.  Sharif makes a better Khan than Wayne.  The acting is better.  The costumes are more  colorful.  The cinematography is better.  Why, then should I like ""The  Conqueror"" better?  It at least makes a nodding attempt at historical  accuracy.",962236800,9,362,5.103448275862069
1215564,4,B00000G3O5,"This movie is an epic in the true sense of the word, about a man from humble beginings who unites a nation through shear willpower.  The cast led by Omar Sharif is excellent (watch in particular Telly Savalas). From  Mongolia to China through the Persian empire, the movie also serves as a  lesson in history, love, family ties and justice. In the movie, Omar  Shariff begins what many feel is his destiny which is the unification of  the Mongol tribes so that they are no longer petty in the eyes of their  neighbors who think of them as just savages.  The costume designs are  unequaled (Chinese & Persian), and the war scenes are brilliant. A date  movie for both people.",951523200,28,674,4.55
1215565,4,B00000G3O5,"I'll confess up front--I loved this movie! I thought it would be just another Hollywood botch-up of history--and it did take some liberties--but as an adventure and costume epic, it certainly delivered. Omar Sharif and  Stephen Boyd seemd to be having a grand time playing their larger-than-life  characters; James Mason and Robert Morley were unconvincing as Chinese, but  turned in their usual fine performances. The late Francoise Dorleac, sister  of Catherine Denueve, is touching and believable as Genghis Khan's  beautiful and intelligent wife. This one deserves to be brought back. Don't  expect the level of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or ""Gandhi""  but as an adventure movie, it's colorful and lots of fun.",949190400,42,707,5.315315315315315

1215617,5,B00000G3O5,"Of all the  biopics of great war leaders that have been released over the years, this has to be one of the least known, and that's a crying shame. This is the (mostly fictionalized) story of Genghis Khan (Omar Sharif). Orphaned at a young age and enslaved by a rival warlord (Stephen Boyd) young Genghis eventually escapes and, aided by a prophecy that he would one day found a vast empire, rallies others to him on his quest to become the Universal Ruler (which is what ""Genghis Khan"" literally means).

As a whole, the film itself, glaring historical inaccuracies aside, is very watchable, particularly to the wide landscape footage and epic battle scenes. What may upset some first-time viewers is the fact that none of the main cast is Asian. (Although Sharif is exotic-looking enough to pull the role off...) Before you go on to write some mean comments, try to remember that, when this film was made, there were few, if any, Asian actors working in Hollywood. The casting director simply had to make due with what was on hand. However, that doesn't excuse casting James Mason, one of my favorite actors of all time, as a Chinese consul with a bad lisp and obvious false teeth. Bad points aside, this is a very enjoyable piece. If you are into grand, sweeping epics, give this one a shot.",1485907200,,1293,4.641921397379913

1215633,1,B00000G3O5,"I was looking for a Genghis Khan movie to show to my history students. I understand that Hollywood takes liberties, but this was not taking liberties, it was a complete rewrite of history. Apart from names and dates, nothing was accurate. I thought I could stomach all the white people playing Asians and an Egyptian playing Genghis Khan, but that was really the least I had to worry about. The steppes of Mongolia were rocky mountains, the yurts were a cross between Bedouin tents and modern American ones, the Mongol hordes looked like medieval crusaders, the Song Chinese looked like badly and incorrectly dressed Qing Chinese and talked like they had a stuffy nose... just to name a few. The poor Yasugai died dismembered after being captured, instead of being poisoned after accepting hospitality. Bortai, who is the only blonde, fair-skinned among her siblings (???) has a weird love-hate relationship instead of the arranged marriage of a 12-year-old. I have a feeling the scriptwriter looked up a short entry in an encyclopedia and then invented the entire thing! Omar Sharif hopped between Khwazma and China in the blink of an eye, and grew his tribe overnight instead of over years. Aaaargh... and the singers and dancers are an insult to Chinese culture. And, if you are fighting for your life or honor, don't forget to point your toes and place your legs in an artistic angle. I had to stop so as not to regurgitate my dinner, and don't know when I'll find the courage to finish it.

The musical score is pathetic. It sounds like a mixture of background music from ""Leave It To Beaver"" and ""The Mod Squad"". Yeah, it's that bad. How they got fine actors like Omar Sharif, Stephen Boyd, and James Mason to be a part of this is confusing to say the least. James Mason looks rather silly with fake buck-teeth and eye make-up, trying to make him look Chinese. Robert Morley cast as the Chinese emperor is laughable. As an eleven year old boy, I thought it was wonderful when I saw it on the big screen at my local theater. Fifty-one years, and many movies later, I realize that it's not nearly as good as that young boy thought it was. It would have been more enjoyable if it was properly remastered, but alas, it wasn't.

I bought this version and I started to watch it and noticed a big difference in it and the version I saw on tv. The version on tv was much better than this one. This version was edited and removed all the humanity from it. Which is the only reason I liked it otherwise its just an old war movie. For example the scene where Khan kidnapped the Princess he holds out his hand to her and says its the first thing you give to someone remember? They cut out the word ""remember"" which refers to the earlier scene where she holds out her hand to him. They also cut out some video footage in that scene and removed his voice and dubbed in a voice that did not do as good a job as the original. So I highly recommend getting the older version not this boring heartless version.",1462233600,10,883,4.080459770114943

Initially, he was born to a leader of a Mongolian Clan. Hence, his birthright legacy consisted of inheriting that title and position. Meaning, that he was born to rule. However, because of his father's early death, he was instead placed into an opposing Merkit Clan into abject and unwarranted slavery. But, with great self-control and seemingly supreme patience, he overcame the cruelty of his mocking taskmasters and escaped. And so began, his ascend to his destiny and the forming of a unified, Mongolian Nation. And, as history will attest, GENGHIS KHAN was a masterful tactician and a military genius. Particularly, in the face of overwhelming odds. He united one of history's greatest military force and so great was his influence..., that what he did - then, still effects us, even today.

This is the second big Hollywood release of the legendary warrior who would bridge the gap between the eastern and western world thru his joining
of his divided tribesmen. (The 1st  being the Dick Powell disaster bound epic The Conquerer with John Wayne) This film although still pausible in its
timeline and historical accountability still comes off as a little bit less of a western than it's predecessor. Great production values especially all of the
Chinese palace interiors) and the battle scenes are very well directed. Omar sharif's acting chops are great and the films only mar is the unbearable
mis-casting of such stewart English world actors as Robert  Forley (and especially James Mason) perform as  ""Chinese diplomats""  That aside it is

1215776,4,B00000G3O5,"Producer Irving Allen, who previously and on a similar level,brought us ""The Long Ships"" and would later help bring Matt Helm to the lucrative spy film craze, produced this 1965 spectacle which can not be really cited as an epic though it clearly wanted to be.  Starring the ""Lawrence of Arabia"" rather unexpected star, Omar Sharif as Genghis Khan, who clearly needed to be the subject of a good film and although the film takes its liberties with history, this is clearly entertaining.  Cast opposite Shariff as his nemesis is Stephen Boyd, drawing upon his success with ""Ben-Hur"" and also very good as Khan's wife is the beautiful and talented Francoise Dorleac.  The rest of the cast with the exception of Woody Strode, seem less acceptable as credible but still very talented like Eli Wallach, Robert Morley, James Mason, Yvonne Mitchell, Telly Savalas, and Michael Hordern.  Although the film might be better served with more authentic actors portraying the various nationalities they represent, especially winning praise must be given to James Mason as endearing Chinaman as he makes what is still rather unfortunate.  Allen wisely used Henry Levin as director who had prior directed the 1959 ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" so spectacularly and well.  He would later direct ""Murderer's Row"" in the Matt Helm series.  The script of ""Genghis Khan"" must have been especially difficult and the writers, Clarke Reynolds and Beverly Cross simplified and effectively told the story which is revisionist and was based on an original story by Berkely Mather.  They say it never really found its audience, but Columbia Pictures and Sony Home Entertainment have brought it to their MOD collection and it deserves to be seen.

Forget Yul Brenner in Taras Bulba, or John Wayne in the Conqueror, this is true to the tale Genghis Khan.  And look who's in it.. Omar Sharif, Telly Savalas, Robert Morley, James Mason, Stephen Boyd, and even Mr. Spaghetti Western himself.. .Eli Wallach.  What a cast.  James Mason's buck-toothed squinty eyed Chinese Ambasador appears somewhat racist and tacky nowadays, but it worked back then.  Robert Morley is not very believeable as the Emperor of China, but is a treat to watch as he vascillates, hems and haws, and just plain stab-in-the-back betrays Temugen (Sharif) in the end.  Stephen Boyd's Jamuga is over-the-top Boyd, even more so than his portrayal of Messala in Ben Hur, and is truly relentless in his lust for power and hatred for Temugen.

1215823,4,B00000G3O5,"Of the many Epic movies which appeared between 1953 and 1969, this is not one of the worst ones, although if you are looking for Asian-born actors here, you might be heavily disappointed.

Never forget, that this is still the Studio System period, and as such ethnic considerations were not held up at all.

This is why all the roles covered here, are stuffed with British and American actors.

OK. OK. The only exception being Omar Sharif, who being Egyptian by birth, got the starring role. But he just played a Russian in ""Doctor Zhivago"" and was considered able to play the main character in this one.

Still and although not truly faithfully following the historic footsteps of the rise to power of Temujin, a.k.a. Genghis Khan, it is a very entertaining romp about the subject.

The movie is filled with stars such as Robert Morley as the Emperor of China, James Mason, Stephen Boyd, Eli Wallach, Michael Hordern, Telly Savalas and Woody Strode.

In its naivete, it is still a very watchable and entertaining movie. Consider it as a variation on the theme and as an adventure movie (which by that time were very popular).

The sets are nevertheless sumptuous, the costumes are gorgeous, and the music by Dusan Radic (I suppose of Yugoslavian origin and who already did score ""The Long Ships"" for Hollywood) is in a weird way, very appropriate for this kind of spectacle.

If you are willing to forget the historic inadequacies of this product and are prepared to accept a little showbiz instead, then welcome aboard.

The DVD (I own a Spanish Columbia Classics Full Screen copy and this Columbia/Sony presentation in Widescreen), is impeccable.
The Columbia/Sony is far superior, since it sports the full 2.35:1 screen ratio and a better English soundtrack than its Spanish cousin.
The sound is in plain Mono, as it was recorded at the time (the Studio probably did not have enough finances to do it in Stereo), but it is very clear
and as I usually tend to specify, ""well-rounded"" (hence no tinny sounds here).

There are absolutely no extras included, so don't expect any.

In conclusion though, my recommendation is for those of you who are followers of some of the actors included, such as either Omar Sharif, Stephen Boyd or even Telly Savalas.
They might not be included in one of their best movies ever, but here they are nevertheless, and just because of this, at least for documentation's sake one should absolutely have it, if only to complete his own movie collection.

It is also a good comparison piece with some of the most recent incarnations of the story of ""Genghis Khan"", on how to do things and not to do them...

But as I usually say... They don't make them like this anymore, especially when it comes to lavish nonsensical spectacle.",1303344000,20,2760,4.761006289308176

It carries alot big name actors and alot of grand scenes but is lacking in substance. The story was too far removed from the actual character. The actual character is far more ruthless and controlling than Omar's side. One other thing was that the music would always start anytime there was anything going on.

James Mason and Robert Morley as Chinese royalty is a bit of a stretch although Telly Savalas and Woody Strode are always welcome.  The crux of the story is carried by the love rivalry between Omar Sharif (fresh from 'LAWRENCE OF ARABIA') and Stephen Boyd who gives his character, Jamuga, the same sleaziness that he brought to the role of Messala in 'BEN-HUR' who both want to own the beautiful Francois Dorleac (sister of Catherine Deneueve)and who would die suddenly in an car crash a few years later.  This film is a co-production of British and Yugoslavian filmmakers and are the same people who gave us that great viking guilty pleasure, 'THE LONG SHIPS' with Richard Widmark and Sidney Poitier.  'GENGHIS KHAN' retains Berkley Mather and Beverley Cross as the story and screenplay writers, the music score is by Dusan Radic who gives both films a symphonic sweep that aids the storylines and they are produced by Irving Allen.  Directed by Hollywood stalwart, Henry Levin , with stunning cinematography by Geoffrey Unsworth (years before 'STAR WARS'), the film is a great Saturday Matinee hoot.  Columbia has released this as a made to order DVD-R and it looks great with its true 2.35 aspect ratio represented excellently and the sound was incredible through my sound system. If you are a fan of the film (like I am), click the add to cart button.

One could have made a much more dramatic and powerful movie if one focused on his military innovations and political reforms.  As often, the movie totally romanticises the Khan's life, making him larger than life and a great noble soul.  Give me a break!  These people were fierce, almost savage warriors who lived to conquer, and some realism would have been nice.  Also, the real Khan lived to a long life, but I guess showing Omar Sharif aging was not in the interest of the studio.  Also, what kind of depiction of a mongol Khan is this, without even a beard?
