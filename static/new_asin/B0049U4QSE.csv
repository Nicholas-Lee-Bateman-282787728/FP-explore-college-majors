This dvd is just laughable you will definitely not learn how to muay thai spar in this production , the only way to learn how to  spar is  by doing it with  supervision from experienced mentors to guide them through the sparing session , better to see real mauy thai fighters spar to get the idea how it is done  This teacher acts like he is the ultimate master and his students are overly obedient almost robotic which I found very funny , did he really trained his students to discipline them  the way he saw fit or did he tell them to act like that while on camera to make him seem like he is the man to learn from which he is not . For those you have seen other muay thai dvd's  on this topic and maybe  had the chance to train muay thai in Thailand will know what I mean. Oh besides take a look on you tube  if you want to learn  how to muay thai spar you'll find a few nice videos  don't waist your money on this one like I did and I even ordered another dvd from this guy"" authentic muay thai pad training"" which was again an ego centric promotional non informative production. Covers on dvd's like this one and the review to go with it can be quite deceiving .Look further do some research and don't rely to much on 4 and 5 star reviews from the maybe a bit nave.",1412899200,,1359,4.048689138576779

The information is also great i had never seen some of the ways to introduce sparring to students. As an instructor this has really helped in bringing those timid of students to spar with the rest of the group. Lots of great info on these dvds!!!",1344211200,,383,4.260273972602739
