8164523,1,B000A2X8MK,"Fearful that I was purchasing a recorded version of one of those fishing shows you pause on while channel surfing on some snowbound winter Sunday where you watch the self-ingratiating (and often, conversationally, not the most sophisticated) host catching fish after fish while imparting very little useful information to the viewer I went ahead and purchased this DVD.  My fear was well founded.

Although it purports to have at least some instructional value, the information is cursory and extremely limited.  Unless you have never held a fishing rod in your hands or have never seen a pike you will likely get little out of it and in the case of the former you will not get the academics either.

You will see some large fish but, at least as it is with me, you will not extrapolate ""how to consistently take big pike"" although you will see the host doing so with little or no explanation.  If you are looking for in depth instruction on any facet of pike fishing you simply will not find it here. It is merely a collage of the host's outings (no doubt various episodes from one of those aforementioned weekend fishing shows) with a blurb of very general information thrown in a few times to sell it as informational.  In fact, the equipment recommendation given identically in each volume takes just over two and one half minutes (I timed it) and is nothing more than a shameless brand specific plug (ie commercial) for the sponsors without the slightest explanation as to how, when or why you might choose any of them.

I could go on, but why bother?  If you would like some good and detailed information then get a book. ""Northern Pike and Muskie"" is among my favorites on the topic.  If you just want to watch some guys catching some big pike then you might like it.  I wish I'd spent the money on another book and the 80 minutes fishing!",1206403200,,1846,4.583586626139818
