7802460,5,5553799287,Great movie for children ages 2-10. I have purchased this movie 5 times..twice for the same kids when the other one got scratched. They watched it very often and asked to watch it over and over.  They learned the songs and the storyline kept their attention. LOVE this movie!!,1452038400,,276,4.63265306122449
7802461,5,5553799287,"We got this movie at a library sale a couple years ago. I had not played it until a few days ago. It is really cute with a good message for kids. The main story line is that a family owns this prayer bear and a little girl breaks into the house when she is running away from her parents. She takes some food and prayer bear wants to help her so he jumps in her sack. They then have a night together where Prayer Bear tells her about praying when they get scared. Then he and some animal friends get her to go back home. My son really likes that it has a toy bear in it because his favorite toy is a large, oversized bear. He laughed when the bear went into the sack to help the little girl and at some other parts too. The people in this show sing a lot. I thought the running away concept was a little over my sons head as well as when the little girl breaks in through the window. Otherwise it has a great message for kids.",1377216000,,925,3.925531914893617
