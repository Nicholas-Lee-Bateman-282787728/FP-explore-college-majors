7888922,4,6305419728,"In episodes 7-9, Kenshiro continues his quest to find Julia, but a new problem arises in the form of God's Army, a psychotic military group that Kenshiro decides to wipe out. This makes for some of the best fight scenes yet. The dubbed version tends to ""dumb down"" some of the dialogue and adds unecessary cussing, so buy the subtitled version.",992908800,,344,4.655737704918033

7888924,5,6305419728,"Gary Daniels' finnest movie yet! this epic Martial Art film has the action to match. Gary Daniels lets loose and shows off his stuff in this wonderfully done postapocaliptic action adventure.  Filled with love, hate,  revenge, fear, and the romance of uncertainty, the most powerful human  emotions. And don't forget some of the most increadable butt-kicking fight  scenes ever filmed!!  And must watch!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",934243200,2,429,5.746031746031746
