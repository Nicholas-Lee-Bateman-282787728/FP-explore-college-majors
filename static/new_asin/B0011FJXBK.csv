8241719,5,B0011FJXBK,"Miss Pattycake is great.  Her songs are so sweet and so much easier to listen to than a certain large purple dinosaur.  :)  I even catch my older boys singing her songs.  This particular DVD has a new character in it, a handyman.  We hope he will be in other MPC movies in the future.",1356566400,,284,4.090909090909091
