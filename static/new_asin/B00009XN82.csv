8231581,3,B00009XN82,"First the details left out by Amazon.  The stars are Simon Yam and Irene Wan. The Amazon version is rated catagory III, but it is really II-B in terms of content.  It is rated All regions, not just U.S.  It is, indeed, directed by Herman Yau (not his best) and widescreen.  If you are a die-hard fan of Yam or Wan, then go for it.  If you are looking for graphic gore or lots of sex, forget it.  I say it should be cat II-B because there are about three scenes where people are killed (two by being hit by cars, a little fake blood, not much violence). As far a sex goes, there are several topless scenes, but only one sex scene, about four minutes long, in the middle of the movie between Yam and Wan. It is OK; of course nothing is shown below the waist anywhere in the movie.

Yam portrays a ""gentleman"" kidnapper. He does not even mean to kidnap Wan, he just wants to beat up her husband for having an affair with his wife (we see a little of this beautiful wife in flashbacks, but not the affair).  He is so nice that he takes Wan's baby to the hospital and lets her go without a ramsom.  He does, however have a violent temper which we see twice.  I will not tell you any more of the plot because this is not a sexy film, it is a murder mystery.  Irene Wan is so gorgeous, I enjoy watching her even though she is fully clothed for all but a few short scenes.(...)",1122768000,24,1369,4.07089552238806
