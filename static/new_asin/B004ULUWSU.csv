8441780,5,B004ULUWSU,"Really excellent! Very informative. Some things that I had never considered about producing great sound. Taught in a down to earth way. Jim sounded like a good friend imparting beneficial information that had real practical use. I also enjoyed the fact that the man had a great deal of real world experience in the sound reproduction industry, not just theory. It gives you a  certain level of confidence when listening to Jim teach. Mike Mondesire",1472688000,,448,4.973333333333334

8441784,4,B004ULUWSU,Still working my way through it but there are some good ideas. Probably could have been streamlined to a single DVD,1409097600,,115,4.523809523809524
8441785,3,B004ULUWSU,This is a great product but it basically covers everything that is already in the book and nothing more. I thought i would learn more from this video.,1398124800,,150,4.392857142857143
8441786,2,B004ULUWSU,"The author and narrator Jim Smith does too much talking and at times he is vague. I am not sure what the book is like, but if I could it over I would definitely buy the book before I spent money on the DVD. I think he could have more diagrams, sketches, etc. that he could refers to as part of his discussions.
Also he knows his subject matter, but he is just not the best at being at speaking for long periods of time. You get lost in the dull drum and monotone voice.
Again check out the book first. I wished I had done that before buying the video.",1358899200,5,551,3.972972972972973
8441787,5,B004ULUWSU,This is essential to get the most out of your sound system. Well done from an expert in the industry.,1353974400,,101,4.1
8441788,5,B004ULUWSU,"If you are interested in making your Hifi sound better at little to no cost then get this dvd. I have implemented the steps suggested and I would say I have never heard my system sound better. I recently set up my friends system using these techniques and he is also very pleased with the results. What do you have to loose, for $20.00 its only the price of a new album.",1328572800,,370,4.152777777777778
8441789,5,B004ULUWSU,"I heard about Jim's DVDs on a Computer Audiophile website.  The premise seemed almost too simple.  Make sure what you already own is working to its highest potential for you.

I followed his three step method and sure enough, my system was taken to the next level.  By properly positioning my speakers the sound stage sounds bigger, with better separation and imagining. Without spending a single dollar I got better performance than my upgrade to a high end audiophile music server from my old CD player. I am still going back reviewing the DVDs and making more tweaks.

What is great about this DVD is there are so many tips. I doubt most people will be able to incorporate all of them, but with so many to try I am sure anyone can get something out of it.

Before spending hundreds to thousands of dollars on a new component, check this DVD or the companion book out.",1315526400,4,870,4.509554140127388
