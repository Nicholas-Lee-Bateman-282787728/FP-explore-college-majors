5972356,3,B00F9J9NJQ,"This arc of stories features the toughest broad anywhere. I enjoyed the stories and the characters were well acted, but I did not care much for the camera work. Very fast pans, scenes interrupted by public transportation, and generally shaky camera movement were disconcerting. It was as if the cameraman/director were trying to be certain that the viewer never got a static shot.",1384646400,20,380,5.0476190476190474

8613458,5,B00F9J9NJQ,I don't parla vous France but these are some of the most fit characters I have ever seen. I read somewhere that they canceled the series but I liked all the characters.,1499212800,,168,4.28125
8613459,5,B00F9J9NJQ,"I'm writing this review in the hope that the creators of this DVD box set will be kind enough to produce one for Region 2 (or whatever DVD works in Europe).  I have not bought this product, but I watched this series first time round on TV (I was even at the ""avant-premi&egrave;re"" when the first two episodes were shown at the Gaumont Multiplexe, Montpellier, with Anne Le Nen present).  Being an English immigr&eacute;e to Montpellier, I had trouble understanding the dialogue, so as soon as Antigone 34 came out on DVD I bought the box set (the one that works in Europe).  Imagine my disappointment when I found there were no subtitles!  English or French, either would have suited me - but despite watching each episode several times, and rewinding over and over again, I still miss important details that are germane to the plot.  PLEASE can someone produce a subtitled box set playable in Europe? (I've given the product 5 stars because I still love the show, I just wish I could understand all of it!)",1488844800,,1008,4.640449438202247
8613460,4,B00F9J9NJQ,"I'm not sure but I think I may have written a review for this already? I was pulled in from the first epi, the main character -Ann?- is captivating. Her aggressive detecting makes you eager to see each epi to its conclusion to see if she solves the case. The 'beef' that she has with her colleague overshadows her work sometimes, but overall I liked the series. I minused 1 star because each epi was WAY overpriced in my opinion.",1480896000,,429,4.375
8613461,5,B00F9J9NJQ,Anne Le Nen - one of the new artists of French TV and films.  great european TV show.  -She's great,1464739200,,99,3.9
8613462,4,B00F9J9NJQ,"This is an older French program. Story line was good,main characters were interesting. Editing of tape/film needs some work.",1445644800,,124,5.578947368421052
8613463,4,B00F9J9NJQ,"I thoroughly enjoyed this. Even though I had to strain to recall my schoolboy French or follow the subtitles, I found both the plot and the characters convincing and the series overall quite exciting. It's a pity it was not given a second series. It was considerably better than many series who are now into their fourth or fifth season...",1407024000,3,339,4.666666666666667
8613464,3,B00F9J9NJQ,The filming quality makes it look like this TV series would show on USA Network in the US.  The story lines for the episodes are just okay.,1402099200,,139,4.148148148148148
8613465,5,B00F9J9NJQ,"Having just finished watching the 6 episodes.  Filming could have been tweeted a bit more, but the storylines, some in a very
familiar vein  was well told and acted out well.  Would be interested is seeing some more with the Captain Lea.
This main character reminds me of Irene Huss series.  No nonsense, but with a soft spot, cop.",1399075200,4,331,4.559322033898305
8613466,4,B00F9J9NJQ,"I like that held hand camera Technique, fast paste action. But don't get me wrong! that main female character comes off a little bit Animated Super Hero-ish. The Producer's of this show need to tone down her character or watch the French movie Pointe Blank..",1390176000,2,258,4.7555555555555555
