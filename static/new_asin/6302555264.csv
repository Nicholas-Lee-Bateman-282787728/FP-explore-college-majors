7827975,4,6302555264,"In several ways, this is the odd one out of Leonard Bernstein's cycle of films of the Mahler symphonies, all but one made with the Vienna Philharmonic.  First, although the Vienna Philharmonic is indeed the featured orchestra, the performances that went into this film were done not in Vienna, but in Berlin, at the Philharmonie, home of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, in March 1971.  This fact takes on retrospective irony in light of Bernstein's only appearances with the Berlin Philharmonic at the other end of the decade, in October 1979 (with the notorious missing trombones on the commercial issue of that performance, another story altogether).  In other words, Bernstein had conducted Mahler 9 in the Philharmonie Berlin before October 1979, just not with the Berlin Philharmonic.

On a much more granular level, just before the performance starts, if you watch very carefully, you will spot one lady musician among the ensemble, a harpist, in the back of the orchestra, in a ""blink and you'll miss her"" moment.  For the rest of the film, in keeping with the Vienna Philharmonic's past where the orchestra systematically kept female musicians out as orchestra members, you never see that musician again for rest of the film.

The filmed performance itself shows Bernstein giving a very fine interpretation indeed, well paced, on strong form, captured on 35 mm film in fine sound.  Bernstein was in his early 50's, and thus this document captures him before his more idiosyncratic final years as a Mahler interpreter, in his digital DG Mahler set.  On interpretative grounds, there are no causes for concern here.

Where this reviewer feels compelled to knock one star off the rating is in the visual presentation of the 4th movement.  Generally throughout the first 3 movements, there is a decent balance between footage of Bernstein, Bernstein with audience members in the background and musicians visible to his side, individual orchestra musicians, and orchestra sections.  However, in the finale, IMHO, there are too many shots of Bernstein swaying and borderline over-emoting, with the camera panning to keep him in center frame, almost to the point of mild seasickness.  This badly tips the presentation visual balance and is a subliminal distraction from the interpretation of the finale.  Here, the blame would seem to lay at the feet of director Humphrey Burton, in not showing the general good sense that he and his team showed in the first 3 movements.  Presumably Burton had the right of final cut, which would put the blame squarely on his shoulders.  Admittedly, this was the first of this Bernstein filmed cycle of Mahler to be done, so there may have been ""growing pains"" in a sense.  However, based on his own past experience at the BBC, with program(me)s like 'Monitor', one would think that Burton would have known better.  (In general, this is less of an issue in the rest of the series.)

This review has deliberately used the word ""filmed"" and variations thereof to describe this production.  It needs to be remembered that this particular Mahler cycle for Unitel was indeed filmed on 35 mm footage, before the development of more flexible and portable video technology that everyone takes for granted now.  Because of the 35 mm film format, the reels had to be changed every 10 minutes.  It was also a novelty to film live concerts at the time, again in contrast to now where classical concert video footage, to the point of live-streaming, is totally taken for granted.

As well, if you're watching semi-carefully, you will notice that during the movements, audience members will suddenly disappear and other people appear in the same sections.  There is even one fellow who seems to be sitting in the aisle, but then a few minutes later, he's not there.  This is due to the fact that more than one performance was filmed, and like so many commercial recordings, the ""best bits"" were edited together to make a single continuous reading of Mahler 9, but from ""different sessions"".  So what you get here is not a ""single take"" version of Mahler 9, to state the obvious.

Of course, with advances in technology, VHS cassettes are a very outdated way of watching this or any other of Bernstein's filmed Mahler performances.  You might be better off purchasing DVD's of his full filmed cycle, or at least one of the tryptich packages.  But if you do still watch VHS and find this in a used store, or buy it on-line used on Amazon, this filmed Mahler 9, for all the quirks outlined above, is very much worth your time.",1498435200,,4548,4.909803921568628
