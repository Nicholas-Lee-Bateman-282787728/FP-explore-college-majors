8507423,1,B00701QRV8,"The Devil With 7 Faces (or ...Has 7 Faces depending on which version you see) is a travesty of a movie.  Name something that could be wrong and it probably is. The acting sucks, the action stinks, the story is convoluted, and the scenes are choppy.  I suppose the surprise ending is OK, but its not hard to see coming and is overly convenient in a lot of ways.

The movie revolves around Julie.  Shes attacked by thugs who mistake her for her twin sister who they believe has cheated them out of a million dollar diamond.  Julie turns to a lawyer for help who immediately jumps to the conclusion that she has been misidentified  (riiiight, it was soooo obvious after that one home invasion, I guess he read the script beforehand).  Its a struggle between innocent bystanders just wanting to survive and vicious criminals.

The story has more holes than my old socks, though some things I thought were holes when they happened turned out to be logical (more or less) in light of the full story.  I won't go into details so as to avoid spoilers, but I will say that when it does all come together it feels forced rather than clever.  It will leave you asking, but what about <insert plot point>?

I guess this would be best described as a suspense drama even if its neither suspenseful nor particularly dramatic.  It comes across as amateurish from its jittery shots to its abrupt editing.  Rather than flowing from scene to scene I felt like I was having to guess and catch up one scene to the next.  Its done this way mostly so they can hide their surprises until the end, but its no use trying to surprise an audience that has fallen asleep.

This is an Italian movie with English overdubbing that can be disconcerting.

Content:
Watch out for some nudity, sexuality, molestation, violence, and blood.

DVD:
I got mine in a pack of 50 Drive-In Movie Classics.  Its pan-and-scan with noticeable loss of the image at the top and bottom rather than just the sides (made most obvious during the credits). The video is weak with lots of trash, smudgy and ghosted images, and a picture that is frequently either too dark or washed out. The audio is fuzzy and distorted with some popping and crackling at times. A Mill Creek logo pops up on screen to shoot you in the sanity. There are no extras.

There is at least one standard DVD edition out there, but the quality looks low.

FINAL THOUGHTS:
There is absolutely nothing here worth seeing unless you specifically like older Italian crime thrillers. I can't say that I do. Ill give it 1*. If you want to get it anyway the 50 pack is probably least desirable, but don't count on a much improved presentation anywhere else, either.",1526342400,,2675,4.544885177453027
