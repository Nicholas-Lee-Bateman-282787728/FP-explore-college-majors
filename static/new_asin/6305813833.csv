This movie was a joke. I worked on the film, but had no idea how bad it was.

Most of the reviews look like they where written by the producing team and Paul Corvino.

I was ripped off and never got paid by the scum writer Paul Corvino who personally stole negatives why looking at the photo selects. I did not relies until the next day that they where gone. He stole them  to produce the box and send out  PR pix. The production company aka Larry Eudene / director and his wife also tried to make me eat my own expenses. I had to sue to cover the film cost from Paul Corvino, Paul Corvino settled and agreed to pay me usage fees when the images where used. I never got paid from this thief.",1281398400,,721,4.049295774647887
8324143,4,6305813833,"This film was made for no money, yet the Male and Female lead did a tremendous job and my hat is off to the Director who got fantastic performances out of most of this unknown cast. I happened to have met him, he looks like Woody Allen, and he told me they made it with very little money in two and a half weeks, shooting 8 pages a day, with 8 actors on set, all the time, everyday and that the women he was with, who he was with for 14 years and who was one of the Producers on the film, left him right before he started editing and that he, along with the crew are still waiting to get paid for their work.  The one thing I got out of this film and the Director is the moral that ""It's not what happens.  It's how you react.""  This is true in most of our lives and, if you think about it, in all of our choices.  How many films have a Universal Truth attached to them.",974073600,,870,3.8707865168539324
8324144,4,6305813833,"^%The Reunion, a little ""In Your Face"" film is proof that if the story, dialogue and acting is strong, you don't need high quality production values.  The story is about a high school reunion gone astray  when a gun wielding former student holds a group of his former tormentors  captive at gun point. It takes many suspenseful, provocative and downright  wierd and perverted turns as the table turns on the seemingly perfect lives  of the hostages.  What really makes the movie which appears like a  theatrical play on film work is the intensity of the male and female lead  actors.  Timothy Devlin is nothing short of brilliant as the gun toting  captor.  As dispicable, vulgar and menacing his character is, he has the  ability to make him sympathitic as all viewers in one way or another can  relate to his inner turmoil.  The lead actress, Mimi Langeland, is equally  as terrific as Caroline, ""the quarterback's wife"".  She at first  appears a little too beautiful, sohisticated and a holier than thou  doo-gooder.  But as the story unfolds she becomes the only character strong  enough to defeat the challenging villan.  It is the combustionable  combination of Langeland and Devlin that that makes the scenes sizzle.  both parts demand courageous performances as they delve uninhibited into  uncharted waters.  Langeland's performance is reminscent of great roles of  70's theater and film such as Liz Taylor in ""Virgina Wolfe"" or  Gena Rowlands in ""A Womman Under The Influence"".  The film get's  a bit perverse and crass as the captor humiliates each hostage with  imanginative tortures, including a scene in which Langeland is forced to  breast feed a bearded midget, played wonderfully by Kristopher Medina. Some  ot the philosophy is not very subtle.  The writer seems to prefers a sledge  hammer to a pen in getting his point across. Although his words are well  planned and inspiring. The rest of the acting is inconsistent and sometimes  terrible.  All in all, I recommend ""The Reunion"".",961891200,,2002,4.9939024390243905
8324145,3,6305813833,"I don't know what to think of this film.  I found it very disturbing, but that may be good. The production quality was terrible, but the story draws you in.  If you are a baby boom yuppie and need soul searching, this is the  film for you.  However, be aware that this film can be a bit rough,  explicit and tawdry.  It is about aging yuppies that are forced (at gun  point) to evaluate their lives and the choices they have made.  In other  words, were the sacrafices worth the gains?  I beleive that the film  attempts to answer the question with a ""No"", but says that we  can't conmtrol what we do (our nature)and would probably make the same  choices again given the opportunity.  The acting is as inconsistant as the  production.  Tim Devlin, Mimi Langeford, Kristopher Medina and Elizabeth  McKay give first rate performances.  On the other hand, a stale  contribution by Jack Mulcahy, a characture by Patrick Ferrera and just  plain poor acting by Edouard DeSoto really hurt the film.  Overall, I guess  I liked the film but can't reccommend it without hesitation.",960422400,,1071,4.645161290322581
8324146,4,6305813833,"This was really a cool little movie. The viewer doesn't know what is going to happen next in this inventive hostage story.  It's about this nut who holds up a bunch of ex-high school classmates in a school locker room.  It  get's really bizarre and twisted but is extremely thought provoking and  intense. Tim Devlin who plays the lead role is awesome.  Not only is he  terrifying, but he can be funny and even charming.  The guy's incredible.  Mimi Langeland, the female lead is equally as talented. She may be the most  beautiful woman I've ever seen. And what a terric actress.  She is so  aluring and seductive, playing this interesting charater while showing  courage and fortitude as the one person that the captor can not defeat.  Mimi Langeland, the actress also shows great courage and fortitude in  taking on such a role that has to endure pains that most pretty face  actresses couldn't even contemplate. I haven't been able to stop thinking  about this woman and her performance since viewing this film. This movie  makes a statement about the nature of human beings and to what degree we  are really capable of changing that nature. In explores the affects of  adolecesnt torment.  The difference between prostitution and marrying for  security.  Is there really any difference?  And it scares the hell out of  you, as everyone can relate in one way or another to each and every  charater's fears.",960422400,,1410,4.799163179916318
