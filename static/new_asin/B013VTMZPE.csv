8728909,4,B013VTMZPE,"Vintage Ry Cooder in his 1970s prime is always good to hear and see.  The source video quality at that time isn't great, but the music is fine.

There are two concerts on this DVD - Old Grey Whistle Test and a small studio effort around the early 70s.  Grainy video has not been improved, but Ry-natics will have to take what they can get.  YouTube videos of these concerts appear to be a little better quality.

If you have followed Ry for 40 years, this is worth the investment.  Dark End of the Street is sublime musically and vocally...worth the price.",1451347200,,556,4.401960784313726
