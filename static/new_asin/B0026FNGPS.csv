8352543,1,B0026FNGPS,I have purchased three issues of this magnificent movie to get to the ending.  The first copy died after the first hour  (I've read the book which is very different) so  I've tried to purchase another copy.  Although specified with subtitles in Italian not a one I've purchased has these subtitles.,1479254400,,298,4.784313725490196
8352544,3,B0026FNGPS,"""Anima persa"" (""Lost Soul"" from 1977), was directed by the acclaimed Dino Risi (""Il sorpasso"" 1962, ""Profumo di donna"" 1974, etc.), and one of the reasons in why this forgotten film aroused my interest, not to mention the two leading actors: Vittorio Gassman (Dino Risi's favorite leading man) and Catherine Deneuve. This ""mystery/thriller"" is set in Venice and, is based on the novel of the same title by Giovanni Arpino. When aspiring painter 'Tino' (Danilo Mattei) goes to Venice for Art classes, he will stay in the old and sumptuous mansion of his rich uncle 'Fabio' (Vittorio Gassman) and aunt 'Sofia' (Catherine Deneuve). On his first night there, 'Tino' gets an inkling that there is something not right about the living arrangements and the stale environment of the 'Stolz' household. It looks like uncle 'Fabio' has a mad brother (and dark secret), relegated to the attic of the imposing house!

Now, I don't want to give anymore away, so as to spoil it for anyone. However, I will briefly summarize what I believe the story and film (at its core), was trying to say.

A family that is descended from the upper-nobility (in this case: the Austrian Habsburg dynasty), and has one of their demented relatives hidden away in the attic (like some kind of ""dark secret""), can easily serve as an allegory for none other than: the Elite, the Church, and the Italian State itself (but it can also be applied to all of humankind too). And, elaborated in a very subtle fashion, that contained hints of incest and child-abuse too. The narrative seemed to be implying a psychological introspection (on the part of the viewer too), that rings and smacks of the truth. So much of humankind is consumed by guilt, hatred, and inequality, just simply because we are not willing and able to rise above our lower-based nature and tear away from the ""false self"" that has taken control of our daily existence. And, this is in direct conflict and opposition with our true ""self"".

The film does move at a slow pace, which allows it to build-up to its veritable conclusion. But overall, there were some very good things going for this one: the cast, the cinematography of romantic Venice by Tonino Delli Colli, and last but not least, the haunting musical score by Francis Lai. Not bad at all. One big drawback, no English subtitles. The DVD picture and sound quality is good but far from excellent. PAL format, Italian (no English subtitles), NR 98 mins. (BTW: I bought the DVD through Amazon.it)

Love and Peace,
