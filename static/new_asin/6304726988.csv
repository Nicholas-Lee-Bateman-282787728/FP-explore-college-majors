916823,1,6304726988,"This animated action film has much, much more comedy in it than it does any kind of fantasy/science fiction.  The comedy drenches this movie, and although it has much more to do with Final Fantasy than it's competitor (Spirits Within), it's a comedy/action film that isn't meant to be taken seriously.  If you're looking for a good action film, I would recommend the Spirits Within.  If you're a fan of the Final Fantasy games and you don't mind comedy, this is the movie for you.",997401600,,480,4.623529411764705
916824,1,6304726988,"Ladies and gentlemen, presenting Final Fantasy's ""Star Wars Holiday Special.""
Pseudo-sequel to Final Fantasy 5?  Give me a break.  Horrible dialouge, loopy characters, awful jokes, deplorable voice acting, and don't get me started on the blinking butt scene.  If I knew that this video would be the result of completing FF5, I would've let X-Death and Gilgamesh defeat me.  Or I would fall on my sword.  Either way, stay far away from this video!  I haven't seen Volume 2, but judging from this, I'll keep some of my sanity!
Granted, even an esteemed developer like Square (who co-produced this ""feature"") is entitled one flop in their lives.  But save your money and go play the games instead.
But The Spirits Within, that's non-game Final Fantasy done *right*.",996105600,3,762,4.952755905511811
916825,5,6304726988,"Remember this is BASED on Final Fantisy NOT the same thing, but OMG this is sooo something you should get, I'm 14 and loved this The second one is also a MUST to get! For one thing it's SOO FUNNY! But not something for kids under the age of 9, it has some thing not for there age range but my favorite part is when Prits (can't spel the main guys name..) says (In a voice that had me diying I was laughing so much ::'Oh, I'm so glad you happy, but now the pretty clouds are gone now AND WE'RE GONNA CRASH!!!':: hehe ;) :) 8)  ^-^ 100% you should get BOTH MOVIES!

916827,5,6304726988,"Okay, so you have a kid, with some serious mental problems (Prezt) a really cool bike, a REAALLY big sword, and a whole bunch of explosives. Toss in the story line, which is he is the doglike traveling (in doglike I  mean he is loyal to the boot and will never desert his lady, not doglike as  in Inu Yasha doglike) companion to Linyal (or what ever her name is) the  desendant of the valient ones, and has the elemental crystal of wind in her  body. These two are trying to find the other 3 stones, and are being chased  around by some mean mecha dudes, an army officer and some bimbo pirate  chick in leather, who likes whips. Prezt is hilarous, and always has some  stupid but funny comback for every situation (even though he might die any  second, he's got something funny to say). His bike is awsome! His sword  fighting is cool, and his trigger happy tendencies (when in doubt, blow it  up! Bombs are the answer to all your problems, ect. ect.) seem to remind me  of Lina Inverse of Slayers and her over kill dragon slave. This Anime is  pretty good, the dubbing is great (although Prezt has this funny voice that  should belong to a 30 year old man, not a teen-ager) the artwork is groovy.  This is a good Anime for kids too, not sicky sweet or overly cute like  Pokemon, and not blood, gore, nudity and violence that people think Anime  is. If your a fan of Slayers, DBZ, Sailor Moon, Ranma 1/2, Inu Yasha, or  Lum, you'll like this. THe only thing is, it doesn't really follow the  storyline of any of the games, so you might be a bit confused at first. But  you'll catch on!",953942400,4,1585,4.293918918918919
916828,4,6304726988,"This cutesy anime set in the ""Final Fantasy World"" A world of mix-tech. Where the Sword Wielders and the Sky Travelers collide. This Anime is worth it just to see how things would be if science slid backwards  and forwards, all at the same time.
Our hero weilds and amazing sword and  rides one of the awesomest bikes in Anime (okay, it's nothing next to the  Akira bike.. but come on, what is?) Our hero has everything a guy could  need, A cute girl, unwilling sidekicks, a ugly villian and some cool  bombs.
The animation is awesome, almost a style unto itself. Plot is  humourus and remians light hearted even in it's darkest hours. The  charecters are all unique and you will easily find yourself wishing you  were a part of it.
Buy it, Watch it, Enjoy it.. have dun ^,^",952560000,9,774,4.439716312056738
916829,1,6304726988,"When I rented the movie, I was expecting something more of an epic adventure rather than a cheesy little story.  Being an advid player of Final Fantasy games, I was truely disappointed",950745600,,184,4.75
916830,4,6304726988,I am a BIG fan of all the Final Fantasy games and Animes. I think this is pretty good but is lacking some of the story elements. Other than that it's an overall good movie. I also think it's quite funny. If your not a fan of  the seiries this isn't for you.,949622400,5,257,3.849056603773585
917004,4,6304726988,"I don't know about the other guys who gave it 1 star, but i liked it. Funny at times. You don't have to play the game for it to make sense, but it would help. It doesn't have anything to do with an FF game except FF5.  So I would rent it first, if you don't like it don't buy it. (You have to  buy FF1 and FF2 for the complete the story.)",929923200,,338,3.6164383561643834

I guess if your looking for a more serious movie you would rather not see it, but I  thought it was awesome. Number 2 is also good.",929750400,,273,3.9272727272727272

7876442,3,6304726988,"I feel it is only fair to preface this by saying that I got this video as the free third video in a buy two get one free bin.  So the low cost probably shifted my expectations.  This contains parts 1 and 2 of a 4 episode show off of the final fantasy game of the same name.

In many ways this was surprisingly good (remember I had low expectations).  There was plenty of comic relief.  The plotline is not so similar to that of the game.  The setting is similar, so you see places from the game drawn out in cartoon form.  Some of the details there were nice.  Often there were small details added that were nice to see and maybe had inside jokes.

As other reviews have said, many aspects of this were over the top to the point where it feels more like a parody of anime than an actual show.  The main character Linally wears a man shirt (and not particularly big) with no pants.  There are plenty of panty shots, including magically glowing butt cheeks that have something to do with the wind crystal's power.  It's not so graphically drawn and she looks like she's about 10.  I'm  not sure if that makes it more or less disturbing.

I think that if I had had any sort of expectations that I would have felt hollow and empty after having watched this.  But since I had no expectations, I kind of liked it.  I wouldn't watch it again, and there are only two episodes here at 30 minutes each so you aren't getting much.",1165708800,,1419,4.215613382899628
7876443,3,6304726988,"personlly this product had only two downsides

1. it should get reralesd on DVD put togerther vol 1 and vol 2 i mean cmon square really

2. i would recmond this off of ebay and find the dvd verson where there put together for moneys worth

3.it is final fantasy.  spirits within isnt.",1127865600,2,512,4.163265306122449
7876444,3,6304726988,"This classic anime would better be represented in a DVD . . . though it does portray many of the usual Anime/Manga traits and comic devices along with a fairly easy to understand plot. Also, it has little or no relationship with the Final Fantasy games (though none of the games are inter-related either). Definitely worth adding to any good collection. . .",1070841600,2,357,4.682539682539683
