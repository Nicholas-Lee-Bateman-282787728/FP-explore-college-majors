4852312,4,B005OGYHAO,It's quite good. I don't like live music DVD where scenes change very quickly. This one could have less transactions but everybody can enjoy this beautiful performance.,1412553600,,168,5.2592592592592595
4852313,5,B005OGYHAO,"I always wanted to go to a Placebo's concert and I know someday I will, but in the mean time I have to be pleased with their DVD's this one is not good as Soulmates Never Die but still AWESOME!!

The Deluxe edition is awesome and I could not expect for more since they already surpass my expectations.

PLACEBO FOR EVER!!",1401753600,,321,4.245901639344262
4852314,4,B005OGYHAO,"It's a good show besides the sound quality isn't all I expected from a blu-ray. It's a simple show (like ""Soulmates never die"") but it has meny songs from the ""Battle for the sun"" album, so it worths the show. It also brings a video from a song not release on the simple edition of ""Battle for the sun"" and a very good documentary of the bands tour and its new lineup.",1330560000,,368,4.125
4852315,5,B005OGYHAO,"I bougth this item to add it to my placebo collection and I must say it is an amazing work, the concert its full of greats views and the most complete setlist ever. the documental its another prove that placebo do what they do with the heart and soul and left everything in their songs and performances. I 100% recomend this item to averyone thats like great and true music!",1326758400,,374,4.357142857142857
4852316,5,B005OGYHAO,"PLACEBO IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE BANDS,,AND SINCE THEY CANCELLED THE AMERICAN LEG OF THIS TOUR,,,THIS IS THE NEXT BEST THING.",1326672000,,122,4.857142857142857
4852317,5,B005OGYHAO,"Great value. Bought as a gift for my daughter for Christmas. Package arrived promptly, shrink wrapped like new! Thank you! Would buy from again.",1325980800,,144,5.041666666666667
4852318,5,B005OGYHAO,"As a long-time Placebo fan, I've been waiting for this Blu-ray unpatiently. Mostly, because their latest studio album ""Battle for the sun"" is a great example of how the band had progressed through the years. Although, if compared with Placebo's outstanding performance in Paris in 2003, this concert somewhat lacks the energy. As far as a track listing goes, I was disappointed that (in my opinion) one of their best song from ""Battle for the sun"" - ""Kings of Medicine"" is NOT THERE. C'mmon, guys, how could you!!!! All other hits are on the menu, and some of them (""Meds"", for instance) sound very fresh. Another disappointment - new drummer. Don't get me wrong, it seems like he knows what he is doing (and doing a great job, BTW), still, an absence of Hewitt is a real loss. Nevertheless, old tracks sound quite good but not as good as on a ""Soulmates Never Die"" DVD (live from Paris 2003).

I was lucky to see them live in Kansas City at the Beaumont Club in April 2007, and I'd tell you, Placebo - is even better live than on studio albums. Great band that grew with years, songs are more melodic and energetic now, yet somewhat private and romantic (yes, romantic!). As always, Molko's vocal is terrific and lyrics is outstanding!
The sound quality on this Blu-ray is a very good (DTS-HD). The Dolby 5.1 surround and stereo mixes are enclosed as well for those of you who don't care about DTS. I do, and think that DTS mix is ALWAYS way better than Dolby 5.1 surround. Reacher, more vivid and brings a real fun to every concert or music clips mixed in DTS.

There is a lot of extras on this Blu-ray including 6 live bonus performances from the same world tour of 09-10'.
I've really enjoyed this concert and would recommend it to everybody who likes simple but powerful grunge music. Placebo always delivers. Good job!",1321574400,11,1824,4.574923547400612

8481248,5,B005OGYHAO,"I purchased a few promotion DVDs recently from my local Dollar General and saw this one in the group as well so I thought I would try it.  A few bucks for something I never heard of, what did I have to lose.  I am glad I did.

If the USA did play this band, it was never on any radio station or MTV, Much Music (Fuse) program I heard or saw.  Of course, I was working 80 hours a week so I may have missed something, but doubtful.

All I will say is this has to be the best band to come from that whole Linkin Park - Oasis period.  Every song on this DVD is superb.  I have only owned it 2 days and have already played it 4 times.  That is a rarity saved for Metallica, Slipknot, Motley Crue, & Kiss concerts.  (Maybe the Babymetal Budokan concert also).

All I can say is get it if you like hard loud Rock music. You won't be disappointed.  Just don't forget to take Your meds.",1461628800,,877,3.9261363636363638
8481249,1,B005OGYHAO,"Nauseating camera movement and constant cuts, no view last more than a couple of seconds. If you're looking for a seizure to distract you from some good music, then this is for you!",1458000000,2,181,4.515151515151516

8481254,5,B005OGYHAO,A must have for placebo fans. It has a good direction with the photography and it fun to watch the crowd and the band move with the tones,1419120000,,137,3.9285714285714284
8481255,5,B005OGYHAO,Placebo has always put on the most amazing live shows.  Granted I've only seen them live twice but I own other dvds and live cds and they always manage to sound great live.  Some bands use lots of props and crap to hide the fact they are terrible live but Placebo has never needed anything more than the music to prove they are a great live band.  I recently saw them performing at a club in LA for the new album Loud Like Love and it was such a perfect show.  Probably one of the best live bands I have ever seen live and trust me I've been to thousands of shows over the years.,1415923200,,579,4.008695652173913
