2445465,4,B000BY9VQ4,"A fine film that was in post production for a very long time. Due to some rewrites I imagine.

A tale inspired by the early career and life of Rev. Leroy Jenkins it tells an interesting story with many ""miracles"" and hardships.

There is one actor that has a couple bit parts, but does an amazing job, of walking past a piano store, and walking into a diner and sitting down.

No real special effects to speak of, some wacky levitation.

Creepy Brad Dourif moment or three. But what movie with him wouldn't have creepy moments?",1176854400,,527,4.458333333333333
2445466,2,B000BY9VQ4,"When I picked up this film about faith healer Leroy Jenkins, who once boasted crowds second only to Billy Graham, I knew it was going to be different; but I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised. I wasn't, for the most part.

Even though the story is engaging, I cannot give it more than 2 stars because of the poor production values. The cinematography is lousy. The script, written by Damian Chapa, is okay. The acting, overall, is fair, with Chapa standing out from the other past-their-prime actors (Wagner, Dunaway and St. James). The sets and lighting are substandard, for the most part. Etc.

Leroy Jenkins lived a tortured life. It was tortured because of the sin that was so evident in it. He antagonized everyone, especially those in any authority, which the Bible says we are to obey. Is there any wonder he ended up in prison? But the result of that experience was that he came out a different man: more humble, more thankful.

The change that Jenkins went through was a good thing. What disappointed me most about the film, and I guess about his life, was that in ended - in what was supposed to be the present time - with him alone for the most part, lavishing his greatest affection on his German shepherd dog. To me, that was truly sad.

I didn't get a strong sense of his relationship with God from the film. I did see that he believed God could heal, but where was the relationship that is the centerpiece of Christianity? Where were the honest conversations with God that made characters like Robert Duvall's Apostle and Stephen Lang's Stonewall Jackson in Gods And Generals so memorable?

Everything about this film looks and sounds low budget, even the scene with Mae West and friends. Surely Mae West lived in something other than the average middle class house we are shown in her scenes. If not, then we needed to see something else, because those surroundings just weren't believable. Much of the film wasn't, especially from a production standpoint.

I appreciate Chapa's contributions, but they were not top-notch. He would have benefited from a better director than himself. I scratch my head at Wagner's involvement. As executive producer, surely he was aware of the low production values they were giving the film. I also wonder about the other actors involved. It just seems like a very sincere, yet unsuccessful, attempt.

I was glad to learn about Leroy Jenkins, but felt that he had suffered deeply throughout his life. What an unhappy life it was, but what a blessing that God, in His grace and mercy, changed him the way He did. Forget all the people He had healed. That was nothing compared to all the lives He had changed, including Jenkins'. I'm glad Jenkins finally realized that he was more than a man of miracles - he had BECOME a man of faith as well. For me, that was about the only payoff there was.

2445467,3,B000BY9VQ4,"""Man of Faith"" was originally developed in 2002 as ""The Calling.""  The direct to DVD was released January 2006 as ""Man of Faith.""

  Damian Chapa is the writer/directed and portrays the main character Leroy Jenkins.  The DVD is based on the true story of the flamboyant evangelist Leroy Jenkins-And how he became one of the largest ministries in the country. His followers claim he has the power to heal with his hands. Does he truly make miracles happen?

  The DVD follows his orphaned childhood through his difficult adult endeavors. Leroy's own healing experience catapults him into believing. He is taken under the wings of his healing evangelist.  Leroy learns the subtle nuisances of running a healing ministry.

  The power to heal with faith is a very controversial topic, but this DVD does not take sides to belief or non-belief. It covers the life experiences of a man of faith. And his surrounding cast.  The wealth and celebrity status made him a marked man. Leroy has enemies from ever aspect of life trying to destroy his lifestyle.

  Robert Wagner (Amos), Faye Dunaway (Mae West) and Jill St. James (Elegant Lady) have cameo appearances.  This movie was written with a loose script. It does not tackle any hard facts or any follow up on the healed. It is not filmed in documentary style so don't expect to be consumed with faith afterwards. Watch it for the moving experience.",1141344000,7,1393,4.834745762711864
8093939,1,B000BY9VQ4,I don't understand why someone would comment on a movie they hadn't seen like the person who supposedly interviewed a musician that played there.  What they  reported was total crap!  I grew up in this ministry and know for a fact that there were no actors playing parts of people that were healed nor were they paid.  Rev Jenkins does have the gift of healing.  He is a sinner just like us all and is not perfect.  One thing I know is that God has given him a true gift of healing because the man has faith.  People shouldn't comment if they have never been to a service and experienced it.,1450224000,,591,4.27027027027027

8093941,1,B000BY9VQ4,"First of all, I have not seen this movie, so I can't comment on the movie itself.
However, I have interviewed one of the musicians who played at his services--both before and after Jenkins' criminal conviction--and he has shared with me his memories of seeing the paid actors who were ""miraculously healed"" during his services. He told me that he saw them putting on their makeup, dressings, etc. Also, that he saw them receiving cash afterwards for faking their ""healing"".
I cannot vouch personally for the accuracy of his account, but I do have absolute confidence in his integrity.

8093942,3,B000BY9VQ4,"I believe Hollywood always trumps up all of the mistakes or sins of a person who serves the Lord for a vocation to sell more of their movies.  I rated it this way, because I have heard the real Rev. Leroy Jenkins on his live Ustream service.  There are many things in the movie which are not accurate for his life.  His new book coming out this month, is a tell all.  It will show where the truths and misconceptions are within this movie.  During his internet service he shared about the movie and does not promote it.  He is a true man of God, who made and makes mistakes like all of mankind, which is why Jesus Christ came, ministered, died, and rose again, that we might have eternal life and have it more abundantly.  I would say to read his new book to get the truest picture of his life and testimony.  Any person who is prayed over by him for healing, is healed, the key being, if they truly believe Jesus heals today.",1379808000,2,926,4.221590909090909

Found it to be right off the wall and  yet humorous  in parts. about  Rev. Jenkins.  Amazing how gullible people could be in trusting  people like him back then.  The older people  might  refer to him as a ""Scallywag ""  in those days.  Catherine M.",1377302400,,361,4.0285714285714285

8093946,1,B000BY9VQ4,"I saw the Faye Dunaway scene and it was pretty inaccurate as far as its alleged account of a gathering at Mae West's home. The filmmakers couldn't research a simple fact as small as where Mae actually lived? That info is so easily available. It certainly made it hard for me to get absorbed into the film. If the rest of the film is as bad, it's definitely not worth buying. I wanted to give this 0 stars, but it wouldn't let me.",1228348800,4,429,4.180722891566265
8093947,1,B000BY9VQ4,Never in my life have I seen such a piece of total crap.  This movie stunk up my house.  I had to light candles all over the house to get the stench out.  Dear Lord (no pun intended)!  I'm ashamed to admit I was in this stinker.,1185667200,2,228,3.7872340425531914
8093948,5,B000BY9VQ4,"Starring Damian Chapa, Robert Wagner, Faye Dunaway, Jill St. John, and Brad Dourif, ""Man of Faith"" tells the amazing true story of Rev. Leroy Jenkins, a traveling evangelist who was gifted with the power to heal, restore, and set people free from all manner of afflictions. It was--by far--one of the most uplifting and inspiring Christian films I have ever seen.
