5344593,3,B009KKLQRC,"3 stars because the cover is misleading: Here is a photo of current Kathy, but nowhere in the video do you see her talk / present anything to us at all from today's perspective. Instead, it is the ""re-run"" of an old perm-haired Kathy  and crew in stylish eighties outfits delivering an older-style workout (with older music and moves). I am more used to newer trainers, so it's hard for me to love this BUT, as always, her instructions are superior, time is spent explaining moves and repercussions on the body; proper form is emphasized and demonstrated, and that is the reason why I am keeping the DVD.",1401840000,8,604,4.592592592592593
5344594,4,B009KKLQRC,"Nice bundle package, looks not very updated but sweet deal.
The camera work is not very good at some part, but still can see how to move.

 I think the exersizes are for beginners and elderies. Or, people have not been working out for quite a while.
Kathy is taking time to teach basics how to position, keep posture and so.",1369180800,6,324,4.295081967213115
8542531,5,B009KKLQRC,"This is my first time trying her workout. I liked the workouts a lot. I am 68 and could keep up. I found the floor workouts a bit challenging, but I always found them to be for me. But am getting better at them.",1516406400,,211,3.8181818181818183
8542532,5,B009KKLQRC,I used to use her march to fitness back in high school and missed the workout so bad! I actually got this just to use that workout again and so hard to find that one on dvd. Wonderful workouts also and excellent seller!!,1504742400,,220,4.1395348837209305
8542533,4,B009KKLQRC,"I like the low impact CD.  It's very good for people my age (67).  However, I really wanted the March to Fitness one by Kathy.",1470787200,,126,4.0

8542537,5,B009KKLQRC,"30 minutes! Yes, that's ll it takes to get in a fun cardio workout.  I've been using the ""March to Fitness"" video and DVD for years and had to replace it again for wear and tear.  I like how she warms you up then gradually increases the tempo and moves.  Nothing is too difficult to do.",1434585600,2,286,4.071428571428571
8542538,4,B009KKLQRC,"As always, Kathy Smith exercise videos are the best.",1433289600,,52,4.888888888888889
8542539,4,B009KKLQRC,"The workouts in this video are quite easy - if you're more than a beginner and in fairly good shape, you won't really be challenged here.  BUT - it's still a good deal as far as workout videos go, and even if you are intermediate/good shape, this is a decent distraction for the days where you want to take it a little easier.

STARTING OUT is a primarily low-impact aerobic routine, which, incidentally, looks kind of like they cleaned out the Three's Company apartment and let Farrah Fawcett make a workout video there.  Music, clothing, hairdos, it's all very dated, but it's still my favorite of the bunch.

INSTANT WORKOUT - includes three, roughly 20-minute workouts, and I've only done the cardio one.  It's easy and kind of boring, but I'm sure others may enjoy it.  It also includes a toning workout, and a stretching workout.

MARCH TO FITNESS - also pretty easy, but a decent walking workout.  I use weighted gloves to make it a little more challenging.

Overall, if you're already a Kathy Smith fan, and you're not looking for a crazy workout, you'll like this DVD.",1427500800,4,1077,4.656084656084656
8542540,5,B009KKLQRC,Such a great deal that I had to take advantage of! I was looking for just one of the workouts to replace the VHS I once had & got two more with this great combo! Kathy Smith is one of the best video instructors & is great with her instructions. I will always recommend her workouts to others!,1421020800,6,292,4.051724137931035
