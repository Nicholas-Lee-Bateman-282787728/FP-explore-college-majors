8107845,5,B000E9UEG2,"Although the years elapsed, this film maintains its dense dramatis personae with the same intensity. In the same class of ""Saboteur"" or ""Thirty nine steps""  Absorbing and engrossing all the way, a cool employed of the British government in Ankara during the WW2 ""filters"" valuable information to Germans of high caliber for a high priced cost. He increasing, when the end is near, the abominable causalities, the surprising betrayals, then cold blood manners of Cicero (superbly played by James Mason, who else could make that role on those years?), the increasing tension when he is chased by both bands in the streets of Istanbul as well as the unexpected conclusion make of this movie one of my top favorite cult movies any time in the cinema's story.",1168819200,2,754,4.937007874015748
8107846,5,B000E9UEG2,"The synopsis given on this site is absolute rubbish. Diello, code-named Cicero, is an Albanian mercenary, who is not ""ostensibly"" the British ambassador's valet --- he IS his valet. He is NOT an agent in Nazi employ in any way at all --- he is a straightforward profiteer, merely selling stolen information for as high a price as he can get. He is selling to the Germans, who are not necessarily Nazis. The story is told by L.C.Moyzisch, who works in the German Embassy --- neither he nor the German ambassador are Nazis. The story is based on Moyzisch's memoirs, but he was NOT ""Cicero"". ""Love"" does not accurately describe the relationship between Cicero and the treacherous Polish Countess Daviska; in fact it is more of a working relationship, with a bit of cynical cold sex thrown in. A strong and highly interesting undercurrent in this relationship is the element of class bitterness, as well as the complete amorality of both parties. The German disbelief of the time and place of the D-Day landings is not featured as in any way crucial to the plot: as Cicero says, it is of little help to the man about to be hanged if he learns the length and thickness of the rope.  It is true, however, that Mason's laughter at the end is one of the most memorable scenes in the movie. This is a tense, witty, sardonic tale. It is extremely well-written and subtly directed, and Mason's performance is one of his very best. He is perfect as the imperfect gentleman's gentleman. Underlying the whole script is an undercurrent of Marxist social and economic criticism, celebrating the end of pre-war capitalist values.",1158451200,2,1612,4.736654804270462
8107847,5,B000E9UEG2,"For many years I confused this movie with ""Five Fingers of Cairo."" What a mistake. This is the real deal. Adapted from a thin novel by the real diplomat, L.C. Moyzisch,""Operation Cicero."" In a little over 200 pages, it tells the wartime happenings in Ankara, Turkey, from the point of view of a clerical staff officer. Straightforward, it is an extraordinarily true account of a clandestine thief. The movie is suspenseful,true to the source material,expertly acted by James Mason and magnificently filmed. The last 5 minutes have influenced dozens of other films and have never been duplicated in heart-stopping drama. Of WWII spy capers, this is the finest cabernet on the shelf.",1146528000,5,681,5.089285714285714
8107848,4,B000E9UEG2,"The Synopsis says it all.  Although I found the plot just a little far-fetched, I still enjoyed the movie, and James Mason's acting, as usual was first-rate.  He conveyed to the screen the tensions and fears that a man in that would go through, in the performance of his job - espionage!  Four stars!

As of 03-19-2006, no Region-1 disc!!",1142726400,,338,4.583333333333333
