8305095,3,B001GDSO4Y,"Performances = 3-1/2 stars; DVD production values = barely 2 stars.  Overall, very fine drumming especially for the first and last sets.  Impact is significantly reduced by minimally creative camera work and unimaginative video editing.  Highly repetitive shots (which exclude some performer close-ups) seems to indicate that an inadequate number of cameras were used and only a single recording of each set was made.  Audio is an insult to the performers!  Stereo only.  Poor placement of microphones and/or inadequate audio editing results in a loss of stage sound from front to rear--only instruments up front (or close to the front) can be heard the best or at all.

8305097,5,B001GDSO4Y,"Normally Taiko does not translate well to the small screen - the power and sound is just too much for the medium.  In this case, the Aska troupe make it come through.

The camera makes you a participant - and the sound recording is really clear.  I recommend ""TURN IT UP"" and be thrilled.",1294531200,8,288,4.296296296296297
