3543730,4,B001DZA2K4,"Fun movie. A rare sequel thats better than the original which had great potential at the outset but got bogged down in repetitive action sequences and thus boring and one dimensional. This sequel is more interesting and i love the alternate creature sub city. Reminded me of blade runner sort of.
Wish this dvd played on any of my players tho. Wasted an order on a regionally coded dvd that was not describdd as such and its useless but the movie is good fun regardless",1428105600,,469,4.529411764705882
