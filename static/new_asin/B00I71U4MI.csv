6253006,5,B00I71U4MI,"This was an interesting movie in that it's part mystery but then also a horror movie with a definite ""monster"" type in it. It's different than the other movies I have seen from this director/company. I don't want to say too much and give stuff away but the movie really moves, and has some super strange/quirky people populating this ""Garden""(as well as some smoking hot ladies). I want to watch it again to see if I understood the whole thing. Also for those who like extras there are a lot of them on this blu ray.",1392595200,5,516,4.385416666666667

There is none of this in Garden of Hedon, outside of 2 people wearing leather, and smacking each other gently with a horse crop. I've seen dirtier episodes of Family Ties. The acting is crap. The sets look busted. If cheap thrills, hot sex, and big time horror is what you're after, do NOT set your GPS for the Garden of Hedon.",1470700800,,517,4.51063829787234

6253021,2,B00I71U4MI,"About 9 minutes (more or less) into the production you realize this is an existential film. Normally I like these Sarte on steroid long winded clever masterpieces, unfortunately I am still waiting for someone to make one. Owen (Richard Cutting) finds himself in a house of hedonism where anything goes. Here he starts to investigates murders and discovers the secrets of the manor.

I will say the acting and dialogue were stiff, If you have a room with women in various stages of dress and something that looks like a kid's volcano science project made out of cocaine, and spankings, I would have expected better characters and dialogue. Conversations turn weird on coke (so I heard) and this would have been a good time to exhibit some crazies, as long as you are wasting two hours of good film. The head crushes looked like rubber. There was no skull fragments, just red gush.

The idea was good, it just needed someone else to do it and someone who can afford a decent sound track.

First of all, it's a conceptual film, which is something that's rare these days, and I give the makers kudos for trying their hands at it. However, the concept of ""The House"" is far from being fleshed out in the film. The idea is there, but we don't see it demonstrated, or, in my opinion, really get the sense of the inner dynamics of the place. Also, it doesn't take place in a normal reality, yet there's really nothing dreamlike in it. Instead, the story and many of the characters appear to be flat.

6253076,5,B00I71U4MI,"Very few low budget, independent films pack a strong punch like Garden of Hedon! From the start of the film, you are carried into an alternate universe where nothing makes sense, and reality is basically non existent. I followed the main character (an amazing performance by Richard Cutting) through every room in the ""house"", trying to make sense of the killings, and trying to figure out who the killer was! The script was fresh and intelligent, yet still had the standard horror genre staples sprinkled in (blood, gore, hot chicks, crazy priests, masked psycho killer). The film also show cases a strong performance from Danielle Lozeau, who is very believable as a confused victim of the house. All in all, I wouldn't know what type of movie to call Garden of Hedon. It has elements of a giallo (including very Argento-like color's and lighting), action sequences, exploitation, drama, and yes....tons of gore! So I would say Garden of Hedon is sure to please fans of any genre! I have followed the writer/director Kevin Kangas' career since his first movie, and you can see that his films just get better and better as he gets more skilled at his craft!
