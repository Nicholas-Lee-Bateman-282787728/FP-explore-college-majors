2514088,5,B000EBGFQI,"I am overjoyed to see that this wonderful series has finally come to DVD. I have watched it for many years on television and recorded all their episodes (thirty tapes worth). After all these years, it is still one of my all time favorite shows due to its atmosphere of camaraderie, coziness, and interesting story lines. The main characters were so well acted that I feel as though they were members of my own family. However, the secondary actors generally did a very poor job.

For those of you who are devoted fans you might be interested in this list of episodes and summaries that I have compiled :

1. Sick and Tired Part 1 :

Dorothy begins to feel rather sick for no apparent reason. She visits numerous doctors who treat her as though she is crazy since they are unable to diagnose her malady. Simultaneously, Blanche begins to write a romance novel.

2. Sick and Tired Part 2 :

Finally, Dorothy is able to locate a doctor who is sympathetic to her problem. He explains to her that she does, in actuality have a malady entitled Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, that has just been discovered. Later, when the girls are at a restaurant, Dorothy encounters one of her previous doctors and embarrasses him in front of the entire restaurant when she delivers her sermon against the conceit and unwillingness of some doctors to believe their patients when they are truly ill.

3. The Accurate Conception :

Blanche disapproves when her unmarried daughter, Rebecca, decides to get artificially inseminated.

4. Rose Fights Back :

15. Mary Had A Little Lamb

The beginning and end credits of each episode are there but everything is stitched together.  There is no way to skip episode's or replay certain ones without endless searching.  And those of us who use PLEX to watch television shows this disc is basically useless.  I bought the entire series and the first four seasons are perfect, but haven't watched season 6 or 7 yet.

2514298,4,B000EBGFQI,"I bought the DVDs assuming they wouldn't be edited, but it seems that a few jokes have been edited out. This was particularly apparent in the last episode of the season, ""The President's Coming! The President's Coming!"", when the Secret Service Agent says four senior citizens are living in the house. Blanche is supposed to snap at him for this and then he's supposed to explain that he needs to interview everyone in the house. The DVD skips those parts, so there's a very awkward edit that shows Blanche smiling at the SSA after his 'senior citizen' comment and then he says, ""I'll start with Blanche."" The edit makes no sense. I actually thought the DVD had skipped. Nope. It's just a weird edit in an otherwise hilarious episode.",1467676800,5,734,4.6976744186046515

Put this up against any current TV show and it will still stand.

The acting is superb, of course, with the such great names playing the leading ladies and the stories well written. If you have been so unfortunate as to have never seen this show or you were too young, I recommend it to you! Simply amazing!

I especially loved the commentary on two of the episodes by Rue and Bea - the dedication and passion for their work on the show comes through the comments they make and stories they share.  One great story shared by Rue was that she was given her choice of ""Blanche's"" outfits over the years when she left the show!

It is, I think, one of the strongest seasons and easily the most quotable. So no complaints about the contents of the DVD. I am finding, however, that whoever manufactures these discs is sub-standard. I've purchased seasons 1 through 4 from various places and all but one were invariably riddled with playback errors and had to be returned for new copies. I received season 5 for Christmas, and when I played disc 2 one episode began freezing half-way through and two episodes were entirely inaccessible. Other episodes on different discs have sporadic glitches. This is not to say you will have the same experience, but it is something to take into consideration.",1293580800,,772,4.856060606060606

2514704,5,B000EBGFQI,"Season Five of The Golden Girls is my favorite and with the passing of Rue McClanahan last week, I've been watching seasons for hours a day. Season five begins with the two part Sick and Tired where Dorothy is diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and is frustrated by an endless maze of unsympathetic doctors who brand her as crazy or tell her to go see a hair dresser. These episodes stuck out because of difficulties my mother has had with doctors over the years. The laughs pick up in other gems like The Accurate Conception where Blanches daughter decides to get artificially inseminated sending Blanche into hysterics. Another great one was ""Love Under The Big Top"" with guest star Dick Van Dyke where Dorothy's lawyer boyfriend decides to become a clown leading to a hilarious scene  in the courtroom after the girls are arrested during a protest of fishing practices.

 As usual the Golden Girls used the comedic pulpit to tackle several controversial issues of the day.  Golden Girls was the first show to my knowledge to tackle the topic of artificial insemination. They also produced quite a moving episode entitled ""Not Another Monday"" where Sophia's friend Martha wants to kill herself because she can no longer handle the pain of life and does not want to die alone. Another example is 72 Hours the show's second episode dealing with AIDS as Rose is tested for the disease following a blood transfusion during an operation. The episode Mary had a Little Lamb stands out because it deals with teenage pregnancy beyond Sophia reminding Dorothy of her accident with Stan as the girls care for a teenaged neighbor who has been thrown out by her father.",1276041600,,1664,4.828070175438596

2514717,5,B000EBGFQI,I've always been a huge fan of them sicne I was growing up. I needed this to finish my collection of the DVD set. Estelle Getty & Bea Arthur are in my thoughts! We can still laugh at all re-runs on WE & Lifetime.,1265500800,,212,3.840909090909091

2514719,5,B000EBGFQI,"Like most television programs entering their fifth year on the air ""The Golden Girls"" started to lose some of its shine, mainly from the fact that their beloved group of headwriters left the series at the end of the fourth year to pursue other projects. However, the chemistry among the cast was still there and Terry Hughes' excellent directing continued, but the scripts were not as original and funny as in previous years. Still, season five is worth having as there are some innovative stories that were told. The season opening was a two-parter called ""Sick and Tired"" in which Dorothy can't understand why she is always tired and without energy. ""72 Hours"" was a topical episode for its day as Rose is informed that she may have come in contact with the AIDS virus from a blood transfusion. Also this season Harold Gould gets a recurring role as Rose's new boyfriend and Dick Van Dyke guest stars as a flame of Dorothy's. 26 episodes are included in this set and the series showed that it was still mighty in the ever important Nielsen ratings as the ""The Golden Girls"" ended the 1989-1990 season at #6.",1249948800,2,1109,4.663265306122449
2514720,5,B000EBGFQI,"A wonderful show, especially for adults -- or even young adults! As an ensemble, these ladies can really act, in my view, and the storylines are well-written; important social issues are touched upon in each episode, and with all of these things together, makes for an absolutely unique & eloquent show -- with both humor and compassion. I've found that most every episode shows a very moral approach to many 'taboo' subjects. I have watched every single episode & never tire of my 'Girls.'",1239840000,,490,4.845238095238095

2514737,5,B000EBGFQI,"As a very small child I would fight with my brother every Saturday night when this came on because he never wanted to watch these four old broads. But I did! And so did most of the country!  The GG's is classic eighties comedy, at its best! I love watching this show because it's sorta corny in a way but still almost nostalgic. It totally reminds me of my grannys. And, the writing, the comedy and the timing was second to none.

These are the syndicated eps, but I do not mind at all. As I've stated many times, anything diced and sliced is still millennia better than anything on the reality-chowder-pot which has morphed into Network TV! But just so you know, the reason why these are the syndicated eps is not because they didn't have the network versions licensed, it is because the highest quality masters that Buena Vista has are for the syndicated version. (By the way, the Fifth Season will be released onto Region 2 on March 8th & on Region 4 on April 2nd!)

Don't you almost feel like the entire cast is like old friends that you've known for years? There is a very special place in my heart for all of them, especially Bea Arthur. I don't know what it is, she's just the perfect person to portray the tired and harried Dorothy. Isn't she? Years ago, a good friend and I went to see her perform on Broadway. And, being the big fans that we were (and still are) we went and waited outside the stage door for her to exit. Anyway, when Bea came out, it was so hilarious. She starts yelling at everyone, ""get out of my way, I'm not signing any autographs."" Anyhow, it was just so surreal because Bea was totally behaving like Dorothy; although I'm not sure if even Dorothy was that crotchety? We could not stop laughing at Bea's impromptu encore performance and it only made me love her even more! She taught me one important lesson, always Bea who you want to Bea!

Didn't Dorothy always have the funniest lines? The lines were great, but also so was Bea because she always said it so deadpan, there was never a smile or a subtle look of craziness. These are some of my favorites:
MA!!!
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER.
Don't ask me, I can't get through to New Jersey with MCI.
I would go out back but there doesn't seem to be any SHADY PINES.
Chew it slowly like they taught you in the HOME.
You sound like Jim and Tammy Faye on NIGHTLINE!
Didn't Jack and Janet do this to Chrissy on an episode of ""Three's Company?""
Mr. Belvedere is a humble servant, you are a horsesass.

It's a rare sitcom that's performers are each as likeable and as talented as the other! These are the four members of this show:

Beatrice Arthur played the somewhat frumpy and always stern and strong Dorothy Zbornak! One of my favorite lines & eps with Dorothy was during Season One when the girls all got locked up. Anyway, a tough-talking hooker tried to pick a fight with Blanche, prompting Dorothy to scare her off since she ""did time in Attica."" But Dorothy knew it would work, confessing to the girls, ""I work in the public school system, it's really no different."" Of course, before staring on the GG's, Bea was most known for the ground-breaking, perennial seventies sitcom&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Maude/dp/B000MGTQ6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Maude </a>. Bea is also an accomplished Broadway performer and has appeared in many other series television programs (such as:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-in-the-Family/dp/B00005Y4RZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All in the Family </a>&nbsp;and ""The Kraft Television Theater"") and movies (such as:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mame/dp/B000O76ZR6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mame</a>&nbsp;and ""The Floating Lightbulb."" ) Like all of the other members of this series, Bea has been a lifelong proponent of animal rights.

Betty White portrayed sweet and extroverted Rose Nylund. Rose was a very proud St. Olafian and often told her roommates about how it was ""back in St. Olaf"" (much to their displeasure.) She worked as a grief counselor (and in later Seasons as a consumer reporter for a newscast) which was probably because Rose was the type of person who really enjoyed helping others. Before this series, Ms. White enjoyed a very successful career on television for over 35 years! She's probably most famous for her role as Sue Ann Nivens (on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mary-Tyler-Moore-Show/dp/B000EXDS02/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mary Tyler Moore Show </a>.) She also had her own variety show in the seventies, and through the fifties and sixties she had her own television talk show and television series. Betty White is also very famous for another eighties series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mama-s-Family/dp/B000GH3PMM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mama's Family </a>!

Rue McClanahan played the role of sexy Blanche Devereaux. Blanche really enjoyed having a good time but could also be rather vain and catty at times; especially when another man was involved. She worked in an art museum and even though she was in her 50's, still enjoyed a very active sex life! Prior to staring on the GG's, Rue was a cast member on the long-running soap, ""Another World."" She also played Vivian, on Bea's series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Maude/dp/B000MGTQ6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Maude </a>&nbsp;and worked with Betty as prudish Aunt Franny on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mama-s-Family/dp/B000GH3PMM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mama's Family </a>, who was a complete and total opposite of man-crazy Blanche!

And, of course Estelle Getty played the role of fiesty Sophia Petrillo! Sophia's tongue was as sharp as her wit! It was very rare for one of the other girls to get the best of her! Sophia enjoyed doing charity work and just generally being a family matriarch for her other housemates. Prior to joining ""The Golden Girls,"" Ms. Getty enjoyed a long career as a character actress, on the stage and in television and movies, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tootsie/dp/B000ZM1MG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tootsie </a>and one of my very favorites,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mask/dp/B00009AOBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mask </a>! It's also a little-known fact that Ms. Getty was one of the first A-list television stars who supported AIDS causes!

What I ultimately learned from ""The Golden Girls"" is that family can really be whatever you make of it. These women loved each other like sisters and I'm certain that the bond could not have been closer if in fact they were actually related. For most of its run, ""The Golden Girls"" always remained a top-ten series. And, this can be attributed to the stars of the show. Season Five is certainly one of my favorite seasons. But, it's very hard to say which is my very favorite because this series always churned out high-quality entertainment. One of the reasons why I have always loved this show is because it totally transcends time and age because the main message of ""The Golden Girls"" was truly universal.

2514778,5,B000EBGFQI,"After watching these 5 seasons again on DVD, the one thing that strikes me is just how wonderful these actresses were. The shows were well written obviously -albeit ocassionally somewhat too preachy and sentimental for my taste- but it's the spot-on delivery and comic timing of these very funny women that made this show sparkle.

 As Bea Arthur herself has said, being funny sometimes means being very, very serious, and nobody does deadpan quite like her, with directors on the show making the most of every dumb thing Rose says by switching instantly to Dorothy for a reaction shot that could stop a charging bull.

 Betty White's merits are also very apparant, her natural charm en doe-eyed sincerity making Rose believable and endearing, quite a feat for a character that could just as easily have become simply stupid and annoying.

 As for Rue McClanahan, she is never less than sensational, stealing scenes in almost every episode, bringing life and nuance to every word she speaks. I have to say she is my favourite on this show, the richness of her acting really mind-boggling at times. For instance, when a sordid secret about her sex life is exposed, you can sense her shame at getting caught, you see her struggling to find a way out, perhaps thinking of some cover-up lie, then deciding it's no use and she's going to face the music with dignity, regardless. It's all there in her face, and it is extremely tragic and hilariously funny at the same time. A truly great actress.

 I have always felt that Estelle Getty was the least convincing of the foursome, despite some of the best lines going to her to round off a scene. Her acting often seems to lack a natural flow, it sounds like she's simply reading the script out loud sometimes. Although she seems to get more and more into her character in later seasons, especially season five where she is a lot more convincing and appears to be enjoying her role.

 The episodes in season five are among the very best and are like comfort food for your DVD player. The  audio-commentaries are a good addition, although I'd hoped for some more Golden Girls-trivia from the Girls themselves.

Fortunately I bought the dvd set and realized how great those episodes were, like the 2-part episode Sick and Tired. It had a whole new meaning to me after learning it was based on the show's creater and writer Susan Harris. Clinton Avenue memories made me a little teary eyed, considering Estelle Harris ended up suffering a similiar fate. I suppose the show needed to reflect the times and they did it with such grace and humor!!!

I especially enjoyed Dancing in the Dark episode because all the Gals got all dolled up and went to this classy nightclub. It made me wonder if places like that really exist for older people that still like to hang out and go dancing! Perhaps they'll be around when I become a Golden Girl, but in the meantime I'll continue to enjoy Dorothy, Blanche, Rose, and Sophia on dvd!!!",1151366400,,1034,4.559139784946237

2514796,5,B000EBGFQI,"Season Five of 'Golden Girls' does nothing new: we have the same four women in the same four modes - sexy Blanche, wise Sophia, stupid Rose and acerbic Dorothy - and once more, we have a string of zeitgeisty, politically conscious scenarios from the early ninties (Rose's AIDS scare, Dorothy's Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Blanche's daughters' artificial insemination and Sophia's failed attempt at assisted euthenasia), and a slew of memorable guest stars such as 'Desperate Housewives' Mark Moses and 'Law and Order's Jerry Orbach.

But, even with the (at least, on paper) predictability of the episode list, Season Five is actually the most laugh-out-loud funny series on DVD so far.

Excellent writing and split-second delivery are the culprits: Bea Arthur, Estelle Getty, Rue McLanahan and Betty White are truly amazing comediennes, and it's their superb readings of some excellent, snappy and thoughtful dialogue that propels this season way out in front of the four great seasons that came before it.

As usual, audio-video quality is very high, and the audio commentaries by Rue McLanahan and Bea Arthur are surprisingly interesting to listen to, as audio commentaries go.

I have some fond memories of spending Saturday nights with grandma, making our famous Jeno's pizza, Coke, and watching an episode of the Golden Girls. Many laughs were shared, and many good times had. The show coming out on DVD was so welcome, and with each season, they get better and better!

Season 5 was one of the strongest seasons they had. Many episodes this season were some of my favorites of the series. This is the season where Miles is finally introduced to Rose, played by the talented Harold Gould.  Dorothy fights chronic fatigue syndrome as creator Susan Harris does in real life. Blanches daughter wants to have a child through artificial semination. Sophia struggles with losing her memory.

The writing this season was particularly rich and funny. The writers added more depth and seriousness to Blanche's character (with her illegitimate son) and the previously mentioned Sophia forgetting episode. The acting is also first rate. The girls are obviously comfortable in their characters, and say the lines with such great comic timing that even with repeated viewings, you find yourself laughing out loud.

This season finally comes with some commentary provided by three of the girls: Bea Arthur, Rue McClanahan, and Betty White. The commentary sometimes lacks any real information about the show. Ms. Arthur repeatedly yells out ""The writing! The writing!"" in her commentary. Ms. McClanahan seems to provide the most information, learning about how she had it in her contract to keep all of Blanche's clothes after the show ended, and how she still has them. Still, ANY comments by these wonderful ladies is welcome by this rabid fan.

Why am I such a fan after all of these years? There is a comfortableness spending time in the house. There is the wonderful acting, the many laughs. Maybe it's because it's about four women living independently without having to rely on a man. Or maybe it's because it was one of my Gram's favorite shows.

That angers me because what's the point of having them on DVD without uncut episodes! Buena Vista better learn from this because I won't be purchasing the other two sets unless they are complete!

2514800,4,B000EBGFQI,"Like every other reviewer, I've loved the Golden Girls for 20 years.  And I was thrilled when the show became available on DVD.  But, I had to give this DVD 4 stars instead of 5 because of Amazon's prices (like so many other reviewers as well) and not the DVD itself.  I preordered seasons 3 & 4 (I bought 1 & 2 from a private seller) and I too received the pre-order discount on both.  So, I preordered season 5 when it first became available.  About a month or so later, Amazon sent me an email informing me the price was going up.  It was only about $3, but still!  If you preorder anything, you should get it at the price at that time and not later on.  And then to boot, Amazon hiked up the price almost $10 more after the DVDs were first shipped out (preorder price was about $30).  I know they always do this, but it's still more than other places.  So, I cancelled my order and bought season 5 at Deep Discount DVD.  It's over $10 cheaper there.  If not for this, I would have given the DVD 5 stars because I love the show dearly.  Amazon, PLEASE do some comparison shopping and get your prices closer to everybody else's!",1147824000,4,1130,4.2
2514801,5,B000EBGFQI,"This show is most definitely my all-time favorite television show and worth every penny spent to collect the entire series.  Every episode is just as funny now as it was when it originally aired.  I always looked forward to Saturday nights for the newest episode of this show.

With season five, it follows the usual format of the dvd releases by presenting the episodes of the season in chronological order.  The only thing I've been disappointed with so far is the special features that accompany the dvd collections.  I really hope that when the next season is released we get some good stuff to see.  So far there has been fashion commentary in season one, trivia game in season two, a compilation of funny moments of season three, and a compilation of guest stars on season four.  Now for season five we get commentaries on some episodes.

The special features included in the releases thus far do not do anything much to enhance the viewing experiences for us diehard Golden Girls fans.  Although I am getting a little bit off track here, I can stress enough how much more meaningful and enjoyable it would be to see some great footage of bloopers, outtakes, practical jokes, and anything else that happened on the set like this.  Please give us some great special features when season six is released.",1147737600,3,1308,4.722466960352423

2514814,4,B000EBGFQI,"I am glad we get some special features with this DVD of the 5th season of the Golden Girls. Excellent over-all, but unfortunatley the audio commentaries are less then satisfactory. Only Rue McClanahan, who played Blanche on the show, gives us 100%. She's just great. She not only gives in-depth analysis of what's going on as we watch, she also gives us history about how she loved the costumes, and which outfits she actually got to keep! That's what a good commentary is- getting more personal with your audience. I really enjoyed listenting to Rue's comments. Betty White and Bea Arthur, on the other hand, while very sweet and dear, lag in their's. Most notably, they comment on one thing, and then shut up for five to eight minutes at a stretch, not saying a thing. Then we'll hear them laugh or say ""great writing there"". It's almost as if they were dozing off during their turn at bat.

You can defentiley tell tension between Betty White and Bea Arthur- neither one comments on the other's ""brilliance"" or even character. They comment on everyone else but each other. White, in paticular, is most noticeable when she goes on about how great Rue is in a scene, when it is Bea who is clearly talking the most. She totally ignores her. This is proof they didn't get along, and I don't care what you say about alleged gossip. Coincidence my eye.

Over-all it's a great, strong season- better then the fourth in my opinion. Dorothy's hairstyle has changed, and Rue points out in one of her commentaries that Bea Arthur had worn her hair down for a movie she did, liked it so much that she hired the hairdresser for the show. Rue comments she preferred Arthur's original style, but who is she to comment since she admits Bea is a bigger star then she is. See, that's a good commentary.

2514836,5,B000EBGFQI,"Making its debut in the fall of 1985, The Golden Girls quickly established itself as a fixture of Saturday night prime time television. Following the lives of four older women living together as roommates in Miami, the show displayed a raw wit and a biting humor. The women live in the house of Blanche Devereaux (Rue McClanahan), a Southern belle who loves men of every kind and has dated every eligible bachelor in the Miami area. Her roommates are former high school teacher Dorothy Zbornak (Bea Arthur) and St. Olaff housewife and widower Rose Nylund (Betty White). Rose loves to tell stories about her former hometown, much to the chagrin of the other girls. The three are joined by Dorothy's mother, firebrand Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty), a spunky Italian immigrant who always speaks her mind. In her early-eighties, Sophia may walk at a measured pace, but the velocity of her sarcasm only increases with age.

Overall, this is a charming situation comedy with likeable characters who have certainly developed their own unique identities. Although some parts of the show tend to be used over and over again (such as the St. Olaff stories and Dorothy's reaction to them), The Golden Girls never seems to grow tiresome. With powerful performances from each of the cast members, viewers will find that Sophia's wit steals the show...

The Golden Girls (Season 5) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Sick and Tired"" in which Dorothy is wrought with frustration when numerous doctors diagnose her constant fatigue and lethargy as ""nothing""... Other notable episodes include ""Dancing in the Dark"" in which Rose feels out of place among her boyfriend's intellectual college professor friends, and ""Clinton Avenue Memoirs"" in which, distraught over Sophia's increasing forgetfulness, Dorothy takes her mother back to their old apartment in Brooklyn in an attempt to spark her memory...

So many times when the world seems like it is falling apart, going to a small kitchen in Miami with a bunch of friends and some cheese cake seem to make the troubles of life disappear....even for just a little while.

Seasons 1-4 had a nice layout that was different yet they coplimented each other well and you could tell they were part of the same collection.  Now with season 5 they decide to put the great characters from this show together in a GODDY STAR and slap a ""SEASON 5"" in HUGE text on the bottom where in previous seasons it was less obvious.

2514842,5,B000EBGFQI,"""The Golden Girls"" continued to pour on the laughs as it went into Season Five. For this season the show had something new. The original writing team that wrote many of the episodes of ""The Golden Girls"" during its first four seasons decided to leave and pursue other projects. So a new staff of writers came on to write the episodes, and for the most part did a very good job. However, Season Five was slightly weaker than the previous four seasons. While most the episodes for the fifth season did have its share of big laughs, there were a few episodes that seemed to lack the comedy that all the episodes from the first four seasons had, and this seemed obvious with a new writing team. On the bright side, director Terry Hughes was back to direct the episodes, but Season Five would eventually be his final season at the helm of ""The Golden Girls"". His directing of the episodes in Season Five kept this show on top. After he left, the show started to lose a little of its greatness and comic edge in its final two seasons.

SEASON FIVE (1989-90)
The new writing team of ""The Golden Girls"" tried to do some new things to keep this show at the top of its game, and throughout Season Five came up with some good ideas and a new ongoing storyline. That storyline was Rose meeting a charming guy who would become her new boyfriend. That charming guy was Miles, who was wonderfully played by Harold Gould. Gould, who guest starred in the third episode of ""The Golden Girls"" way back in its first season, was terrific in this role and turned up in a couple of episodes in Season Five. This storyline with Rose and Miles was a winner. It was a little change of pace that the show needed. Episodes involving Rose and Miles included: when they start going out for the first time and Rose thinks she's too stupid for his taste, and when Miles introduces Rose to his daughter and his daughter tells Rose to stay away from him because he hasn't gotten over the loss of his wife. Other good episodes in Season Five included: Dorothy becoming very ill and going to several different doctors who can't find out what's wrong with her; Blanche's daughter coming to visit and telling her mother that she's going to have a baby via artificial insemination; Dorothy begins to date a lawyer who also has a gig as a circus clown; Blanche dealing with the death of her father; Dorothy helping out a pregnant teenage girl and trying to get the girls' father (who's thrown her out) to step in and help her out too; Rose getting tested for the HIV virus; Dorothy hosting Stan's Communist cousin who comes to Miami for a visit; Dorothy becoming addicted to gambling; and the girls preparing to meet the President of the United States.

""The Golden Girls"" domination at the Emmy Awards ended after being shut out for its fourth season, but the nominations didn't stop. For Season Five, the show got 8 nominations, including another nod for Best Comedy Series. This was also the first time that Beatrice Arthur, Betty White, and Rue McClanahan were all not nominated together for Best Actress in a Comedy Series like they were for the first four seasons. This time, only White was nominated, while Arthur and McClanahan were passed over. Estelle Getty was nominated again for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, and deservedly so. She should have won three or four Emmys for her role as Sophia. Also recognized again was director Terry Hughes, who received directing nominations for all five seasons of ""The Golden Girls"", winning on his second nomination for Season Two. His last ""Golden Girls"" directing nomination was for the Season Five episode titled ""Triple Play"", which was one of the best directed episodes that I've ever seen. This episode deals with three totally different storylines that tie up neatly at the end: Rose meeting Miles' daughter; Blanche's backfired attempt at meeting men by renting a used car and pretending that its for sale, and all the men become more interested in the car than in going out with her; and Dorothy dealing with Sophia, who has stolen government money.

Some of the guest stars from Season Five of ""The Golden Girls"" include: Dick Van Dyke as Dorothy's lawyer boyfriend who also does double duty as a circus clown in the episode ""Love Under the Big Top""; Jeffrey Tambor (""Arrested Development"") as one of the doctors who can't find the illness that Dorothy comes down with in part 1 of the episode ""Sick and Tired""; Geraldine Fitzgerald (who guest starred on an episode of ""The Golden Girls"" in Season Three) as Sophia's friend who plans to commit suicide in the episode ""Not Another Monday""; Robert Mandan (""Soap"") as Blanche's new beau who suffers a heart attack in the episode ""Great Expectations""; Mark Moses (""Desperate Housewives"") as a young man who claims to be the illegitimate son of Blanche's late husband in the episode ""An Illegitimate Concern""; Eddie Bracken as Rose's first love in the episode ""Twice in a Lifetime""; Barbara Babcock (""Hill Street Blues"") as Blanche's sister who comes to Miami as the newest author of a book that seems to be about Blanche's life, and Marian Mercer (""It's a Living"") as Stan's Communist cousin who complains about everything in America (except 7-Eleven Slurpees) in the episode ""Sisters and Other Strangers""; Jerry Orbach (""Law & Order"") as a guy Dorothy dated from the past in the episode ""Cheaters"" (this same character was featured in an episode of Season One and was played then by Alex Rocco); and Timothy Stack (""Night Stand"") as a government agent trying to get information on the girls before the arrival of the U.S. President in the episode (""The President's Coming! The President's Coming!"")

I have rated ""The Golden Girls"": The Complete Fifth Season 5 stars. But if Amazon.com have 1/2 star ratings to rate from, I would have rated Season Five 4 1/2 stars, because to me the fifth season of my favorite show of all time wasn't quite up there with Seasons One through Four. But that doesn't mean that Season Five is bad. No way! There's lots to like in Season Five, and (of course) I highly recommend it to the show's biggest fans.

Now I'm anxiously awaiting Season Six.",1140652800,23,6160,4.705282669138091
2514843,5,B000EBGFQI,"I love this show and this season. My favorite episodes for this season are: Sick and Tired (Dorothy is sick but no one can diagnose her disease), Rose Fights Back (Rose tries to get a job with a consumer reporter agency), Dancing in the Dark (Rose is intimidated that new love Miles is a college professor), Ebbtide (heartbreaking episode where Big Daddy dies), Comedy of Errors (Dorothy follows up on a childhood dream of being a stand-up comic, Blanche is audited), Clinton Avenue Memoirs (Sophia tries to remember her past by going back to her apartment in Brooklyn), and Sisters and Other Strangers (Blanche's sister writes a novel that appears to be about Blanche, Dorothy struggles to put up with Stan's Russian cousin who prefers communism over democracy).

Bea Arthur is my favorite and I love her, but this season was a bad-hair season for her. Watch for her worst hair episode in 'Dancing in the Dark'. In the scene where Rose asks Blanche to take her place on a date with Miles, Bea looks like she just went through a car wash. I laugh every time I see this scene.",1140652800,7,1075,4.628272251308901
