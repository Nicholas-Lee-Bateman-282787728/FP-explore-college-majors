1199160,5,B00000DFR0,"This movie is hilarious for all people who enjoy watching low budget movies.  The actors are from Australia or something and they actually say some pretty funny lines.

1199161,2,B00000DFR0,"Peter Jackson has talent.  I'm a big big fan of what he did with Lord of the Rings and have enjoyed other movies of his.  Bad Taste is more along the lines of so bad its fun.  This is essentially nothing more than a mindless gore-fest, and while I can imagine it being fun to make it's potentially not that much fun to watch if you require anything else out of a film.

The story centers around aliens who have come to Earth to turn humans into the next galactic fast food craze.  They've wiped out a small village as a way to collect samples.  A small bumbling band of alien hunters has come across their plot and sets out to stop them as well as rescue any survivors.

That's pretty much it.  There's very little story, no character development, no nothing.  It's as little premise as possible to pit people against carnivorous aliens in a violent struggle.  It's best described as a dark comedy though most of the jokes are in keeping with the title  bad taste.  It's extremely campy though I will say it's pretty well shot.  I've seen better movies that weren't put together as well as this one which is where Jackson's talent really shows through here.

Without much story to sink my teeth into I looked for other things.  I might have enjoyed the silliness more if there had at least been more consistency.  Sometimes the aliens are nearly impossible to kill, sometimes they drop with minimal effort  and often we see both happen in the same scene.  Sometimes the heroes act like a highly-trained task force, other times they act like bumbling dolts.

I did laugh some, but not as much as I thought I would.  The acting is pretty bad throughout.  Effects and visuals are definitely B grade but not bad at all, actually impressive even, for what is essentially a no-budget homemade movie made in Peter's spare time.

It comes down to the entertainment value you place on jokes about splattered brains.  If you can find that enjoyable perhaps Bad Taste is a movie to check out.  If you want narrative substance then you'll need to look elsewhere. I like a good brain joke as much as the next weirdo, I just cant hang my hat on cracked craniums if theres nothing else there.

Content:
This is a very violence and gory movie even if most of that is goofy. Theres a bit of strong language as well.

 DVD:
Ive gotten it in 2 different packs of mega-movie 50 packs: Fright Classics and Chilling Classics. Its been pulled from the more recent editions of Chilling Classics. The audio and video for both collections transfers are fair.  It's as good if not better than any movie in either pack, but that's not saying much. There are no extras for either set.

Starz/Anchor Bay offers a decent looking edition thats widescreen with surround sound. Theres a limited edition of it with some extras offered. There are a couple of other DVD possibilities, but most don't list enough detail to be sure of exactly what they offer and reviews aren't helpful in figuring out if any might be as good or better than Anchor Bays.

FINAL THOUGHTS:
As someone who has made his own homemade productions I can appreciate the quality of Jackson's work.  For a movie filmed with virtually no budget, homemade costumes, and a shoot-whenever-we-have-time schedule this movie is exceptional.  But as a movie I want to see again it falls flat.  Even though I enjoy dark comedies and don't mind gore if its done right I guess I expected more than just that from Jackson (maybe I should try watching it again now that I know what to expect) which is why it only gets 2*. Check out that Anchor Bay DVD if you're looking to buy.",1496707200,,3599,4.530232558139535

I mean the plot was pretty clever, the  gore was some of the nastiest that I've ever seen, and some of the humor was corny in a good way, but overall it was not all that special. The cast wasn't very diverse, there wasn't enough buildup, and the big shootout at the alien ship/house was nothing compared to Commando, but I forgive that since it was very low-budget.

Keep in mind that this was a collaboration among Jackson and friends that was filmed in the weekends over a period of years where everyone involved was multitasking; yet, the film is pure Jacksonian.  Aside from writing and directing credits, Peter Jackson also was the Gandalf-prop wizard who constructed the alien prosthetics and the weaponry displayed throughout the movie.

1199206,1,B00000DFR0,"There's good special effects, witty writing and a memorable experience and then there's simply nostalgia.  A lot of people choose to allow nostalgia to skew their view and cloud their judgement when it comes to reviewing movies they enjoyed in the past.

For what it's worth, Peter Jackson has made one of my favorite splatter films of all time, ""Dead Alive"". It's humor and writing is witty, the special effects are good (for it's time), it's pacing is fairly good and it's unapologetic about what it is.

Being a fan of late 70's and 80's horror and splatter films and after reading rave reviews of Bad Taste, I decided to give the movie a chance.

You can tell RIGHT AWAY this is one of Peter Jackson's early forays into movie development. There's not really any humor in 'Bad Taste', the pacing is terrible and the writing is all over the place. The biggest allure to the movie, the aliens only really make an appearance until the ending of the movie.

The special effects and gore aren't terrible and honestly, the SFX of blood and organs splashing about put a smile on my face. But the reality is, Bad Taste is an awful movie, there's no redeeming qualities to bad taste, even for a fan of splatter and horror. I had to watch the movie twice because I fell asleep once.

If this is something you fondly remember, then it might be for you, but anyone else should save their time and money and stay away from this movie.",1436745600,2,1424,4.5

1199210,5,B00000DFR0,"As one of the earlier Peter Jackson films, its really interesting to see the metamorphosis in his directing style as he grew from films like this and Dead Alive and ended up directing the Lord of the Rings. The overall impression the movie gives is great; mildly serious with a generally silly intent. The gore effects and the basic absurdity of just about everything that happens in this film is awesome, and if you're a connoisseur of bad cinema, this is certainly a must-see.

When New Zealand falls under attack by an alien threat, it is up to The Boys, a rag-tag team of mercenaries, to stop the fast-food junkies from turning all of mankind into hamburger meat for their intergalactic diner! BAD TASTE couldn't be a more appropriate title for this crude comedy that frequently pushes the boundaries of abusive humor and excessive gore. The film is insanely funny, with an endless supply of quotable lines and hilariously bloody gags that repulse just as much as they entertain. From brain-splattering to barf-eating and beyond, BAD TASTE is unrelenting in its attempts to thoroughly disgust its audiences in every moment. While relying on friends and co-workers to flesh out the rest of cast, Jackson, himself, stars as both the dimwitted Derek and the bumbling Robert in two of the most memorable roles. The sheer audacity and maddening amounts of gore found in BAD TASTE would only be exceeded in Jackson's second feature, DEAD ALIVE, five years later.

1199257,4,B00000DFR0,"Just goes to show, look at this film, then think on how the director went on to do Lord of the Rings, King Kong, and othern popular modern day blockbusters. But now we will dwell in Peter Jackson's first FULL LENGTH film, Bad Taste.

Not too much of a plot on this one, its pretty much just a bizarre alien invasion movie. They come to Earth in human form, their form is creppy looking males with blue shirts. Their goal is to harvest Earth to use human flesh for an alien resturant. (This seriously went on to Lord of the Rings!!!) Our main characters besides the aliens are five males. Derek, Ozzy, Frank, Barry, & Giles. If you were wondering, those are all the humans in the film, exept for a voiceover at the very beginning, which is by Tony Hiles. The main alien takes form as an older bald man in a business suit, which is an odd sight. Besides taking out all the aliens, the whole middle half of this movie focuses around the four boys trying to rescue Giles from the aliens. They sucessfully find him a vat, and take him out of the home.

One of my favorite parts took place towards the end, where Ozzy & Frank take a bunch of machine guns and totally bomb the aliens hideout, with kickass music playing in the backround. Then a sheep randomly blows up, much to alot of peoples confusion, but still randomly funny to watch. Had an odd ending with a house flying through space (Seriously, it was a house flying through outer space, flying past Saturn!) but for an independant film it was, I love Bad Taste. I own the two disc limited edition, with the documentary on the second disc.

I give Bad Taste a 4/5 (In case you wanted to know, I own copy 11,546 out of 50,000 LOL)",1279497600,,1681,4.313291139240507

They discover the aliens's plan on using human flesh for the latest in their intergalactic fast-food chain business but can the bumbling team save the human race or will they end up as lunch?

Sick, twisted and hilarious Science Fiction horror action comedy from writer and director Peter Jackson made one hell of a debut here. Before he did ""Lord of the Rings"", ""King Kong"", ""Dead Alive"", ""Meet The Feebles"" and ""Heavenly Creatures"" he made this New Zealand production which was became an independent sensation in that country to now in the US thanks to video, midnight theater showings and DVD. What works here is that the humor is absolutely morbid from aliens drinking vomit to the hilarious exploding sheep sequence and the storyline is very good as well. Yes the acting is bad but what can you expect from a b-movie? it has that feel of Troma and Herschell Gordon Lewis combined here and some crowdpleasing gore scenes such as headings exploding, brains splattering, cannibalism, dimsemberment and everything but the kitchen sink. This film is not for the squeamish or everyone but for those with a taste of dark comedy with Sci-fi and horror thrown in it, i recommend this.

1199262,3,B00000DFR0,"Of course, everyone knows that before the director of the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy became a big shot Hollywood director, he made some pretty vile Horror movie gore-fests when he started as an aspiring filmmaker. There's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DEAD-ALIVE/dp/157362408X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DEAD ALIVE</a>, which has been called the ""goriest film of all time"" and if you've ever seen it, you probably won't disagree with that claim. And then there's this movie.

BAD TASTE is Peter Jackson's first film, and while the body count is lower and the gore isn't as over the top as DEAD ALIVE is, this movie managed to do something that no other movie has ever done: make me nauseous. I've seen FACES OF DEATH, I've seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SALO/dp/B0019X3ZZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SALO</a>, I've seen the sickest viral videos you can think of, and usually I get shocked more than anything. However, this film had a scene that made me absolutely sick to my stomach and it took every ounce of my will just to hold it in. I won't ruin it but let's just say it involves people drinking something they shouldn't be drinking. But what makes it so disgusting is not only the visual, but the sound effects. BAD TASTE has some of the most absolutely disgusting sound effects I've ever heard in ANY movie and it makes the gore in the film even more cringe-inducing. Even hours after watching the film, I was still haunted by it and gagged at the mere thought of it.

With that story out of the way, the film is basically about an Alien invasion. Alien beings are on Earth disguised as humans who all wear matching clothes and look like the belong in some sort of suicide cult or something. Their mission on Earth has something to do with killing humans for an intergalactic fast food chain. Then a bunch of goofs who are supposed to be some sort of elite group of mercenaries (or something like that) are given a mission to eliminate the Aliens before they whipe out every human within a certain radius.

This film is extremely low budget and I don't think anyone in the film has had any prior acting experience. It was more of a labor of love for Peter Jackson and his friends that eventually became a funded project and ultimately a Cult Classic. With that being said, I won't rag on the visuals or the acting because it's not professional per se, but let's just say that you shouldn't expect a cinematic masterpiece. Going based entirely on an entertainment level, I must say that I was sort of bored with this movie. It wasn't horrible, but I just couldn't get into it until the very end. It wasn't ""laugh out loud"" funny either. Not to me, anyway. I thought DEAD ALIVE was excellent and worthy of it's Cult Classic title, but not this one. BAD TASTE tested my patience and most of all my stomach. But on a plus side, for how amateur this film is, the effects in the movie were amazing and it seems like Jackson and his crew really put forth a lot of effort. A lot of camera tricks were used, and the homemade makeup effects were very well done. If you're into filmmaking at all (especially Horror filmmaking), you may find this movie to be very inspiring.

Overall, it's not a horrible movie considering the circumstances in which it was made (it was filmed over a period of four years and I did not notice any outstanding continuity or consistency problems), however it just didn't keep my attention. The almost vomit-inducing scene aside, the gore in this film is so over the top that you can't help but love it (for example, Peter Jackson's character has a huge hole in his skull for most of the movie and has to keep stuffing his brains back into the hole and securing it with his belt). The filmmaking is noteworthy. The characters are entertaining (even though some of the actors sound like they're constipated). Just as an overall film, it was a bit on the boring side. But the bottom line is, if you like gore (Comedic gore, at that) then I highly recommend BAD TASTE. You may not like it, but it's still a film that every Horror fan should and MUST see.

1199264,3,B00000DFR0,"You might as well go ahead and forget the fact it's low budget, because it's mighty impressive that a movie like this was made on a shoe-string budget (the masks were baked in Peter Jackson's mother's oven!).  Peter Jackson's first film is a gory comedy action movie (In my opinion, this isn't a horror movie or a horror comedy) about aliens that take over a town to harvest them for their fast food franchise.

Bad Taste really isn't TOO gory (nowhere as gory as Dead Alive) as it has more action and tense parts that lead to action, with some humor.  Even though there isn't that much gore, there's no shortage of inspiration, or at least some memorable parts.  The beginning of the movie where the alien gets his top part of his head shot off is great and looks gross (the way it's supposed to be! Yum.), and seeing the machine gun being fired off is awesome too.  I won't really spoil it all for you, but the gore parts will most likely keep you entertained, though don't come just for that.

The story may be a bit bare bones and cheesy, but that's the way I like it!  And the actions scenes on it are pretty funny and there are rocket launchers being fired and plenty of machine guns.  It's a good watch, though it isn't really, for me, worth having on DVD (hence the three stars).  Still worth a watch and entertaining.",1214697600,2,1326,4.3795918367346935

This whole movie reminds me of a role-playing game session from my high school days, where game masters and players made things up as they went along.

The first thing you notice is that Bad Taste is well, bad.  The film and audio quality is terrible. The accents are a bit difficult to understand for Americans. One of the characters, Derek, appears to be mentally ill.  And yet there's a certain rough charm to the whole thing.

The plot, such as it is, involves a crack team of government agents who work for the Astro-Investigation and Defense Service (AIDS) sent to investigate the disappearance of the citizens of Kaihoro, New Zealand.  Your reaction to the in-joke name of the agency will dictate whether you find Bad Taste to be hilarious or stupid.  An agency with an acronym like AIDS is something my high school buddies might dream up on a whim.

The AIDS strike force consists of Ozzy (Terry Potter), Barry (Peter O'Herne), Frank (Mike Minett), and the aforementioned Derek. They stumble onto an alien race of merchants who know all about ""how to serve man,"" and not the butler kind of service.  The film begins with the capture of one of the aliens, Robert (Peter Jackson), who is held captive by hanging him over the edge of a cliff by his ankle.  While Barry explores the ghost town, Derek decides to torture the leader for information by stabbing him in the foot.  This ultimately leads to the other aliens coming to the rescue, Robert escaping, and Derek falling off a cliff to his supposed death.

""Wait, Derek died?"" asks Derek's player.

""Yeah,"" says the GM.  ""You had a good fight there with the alien sledgehammers but you slipped off the cliff.""

""But,"" whines the player, ""I was just getting started!  You can't kill Derek off like that!""

""Okay, fine.  Derek lands on seagull eggs and only some of his brain falls out, but he's still alive.  Now he's crazy as a loon.""

""Great! I stuff his brains back into his skull and keep going...""

In comes Giles player.  ""Hey guys. Is it too late to play?""

""Nah,"" says the GM.  ""You're a collector whose come to Kaihoro to collect.  And the aliens abduct you and toss you in a stew!""

""Oh, great...""

Bad Taste pretty much devolves from there, leading to Derek attacking people with a chainsaw, Ozzy and Frank firing rocket-launchers at the aliens, and the aliens themselves turning out to be shoulder- and butt-padded monstrosities who can barely run much less pose a threat to anybody. It all ends with a house flying into space.

Bad Taste veers from thrilling action to long, boring pans of characters walking from Point A to Point B.  There are random gags (most of them involving slipping on some form of excrement), over-the-top violence ranging from organs being stuffed into places to drinking someone else's vomit, and plenty of jokes about aliens and action movies.  The action scenes are actually very well done, and there's plenty of people running as machine gun fire peppers their feet.

Bad Taste makes no bones about what it is - a cult film. Jackson's humor is evident here, but he would go on to do much more horrifying and humorous films. While Bad Taste is no Evil Dead, it's still enjoyable as a piece of film history over a couple of beers with your buddies.",1211760000,,3934,5.206677265500795

It is amazing, though, the quality of the film considering how long it took Jackson to make it, just shooting it in the areas around his home, mostly on weekends.  When it was about 3/4 done, the New Zealand Film Commission heard about it, and decided to finance it the rest of the way for this maverick, unheard of filmmaker.  The result is a cheaply made, but sickly entertaining film about an alien invasion of a small town in New Zealand.

Not much is ever explained about the aliens, except for the fact that they are here to turn our race into meat for their fast food company on their planet.  A group of men known only as ""the boys"" are sent into the town to stop the aliens from getting away, or killing more innocent civilians.  The aliens have disguised themselves as humans (they aren't really capable of too much, though, they sort of run around like zombies, which makes for some great, entertaining kills).  Peter Jackson even has a fairly important role, although it doesn't require much acting skill, as one of the aliens in disguise as a human.  It is actually surprising how action-packed the film is.  Granted, it isn't the highest quality action, but the gore in the film is totally over-the-top and ridiculous, which is all I could expect from the man who brought us Dead Alive.

This film isn't one to really remember, though.  It is more of just a cult classic, I think, because of the insane fame that Peter Jackson has attained recently.  There are a bunch of fans out there who loved Jackson before LOTR, regretfully I wasn't one of them (The Frighteners was the only film of his I'd seen before Fellowship).  For those fans, this film will always be regarded as a classic.  It is a film that really shows you what a great talent Jackson is, because this movie is a lot better than films that have a 50 million budget these days.

but i find that peter jacksons charecter is pretty anoying and kills the semi beleivable parts of the movie(you'll see what i mean).i know this is not supposed to me serious but i really can't stand monty python type humor, it makes me wanna puke as do most foreign(mainly british type) movies. Do yourself a favor if you want some good american comedy/horor get the evil deads there cheaper and way better done, not to mention better plots,.

but if you enjoy gore and raunchy british type humor check this out but please don't waste $18.00 on this pile you'll be disapointed, luckily i used a gift card.

this is comming from someone that enjoyed such tragedies like killer klowns and pupet master(some of them as a kid anyway), so i like my fair share of corny ass movies. maybe its just the british type humor that killed it for me.",1141171200,,1474,4.4888059701492535
1199292,4,B00000DFR0,"Peter ""Lord of the Rings"" Jackson's first commercial movie release was made on a minuscule budget and with more than a little help from his friends, not to mention mum and dad.  It is undeniably a crudely amateurish zombie-populated gore-fest, in the nascent gross-out style that Jackson would push to its ultimate gory conclusion in his more polished next release - the truly inspired Braindead.

The plot of Bad Taste is recycled from umpteen corny old American B movies from the middle of the last century - aliens have landed in a remote part of the country, with the aim of exploiting humanity for nefarious ends. A small group of humans cotton onto what's happening and set out to save planet Earth.

The standard of acting is hardly Oscar material; the dozen or so actors (no actresses!) are recycled time and time again; the sound and soundtrack are very basic and the special effects are mostly crude and ridiculous. So why does it work and why has Bad Taste acquired such cult status?  Quite simply because it is incredibly entertaining! The outrageous visual gags and often inspired one-liners (delivered in deadpan manner more often than not) provide a whole series of laugh-out-loud moments.  Some of my favourites being the ongoing effects of Derek's (Jackson) traumatic head injury, the machine-gun firing literally through the body (didn't Jeunet pinch that idea in Alien 4?), the aliens dropping out of the tree in great number following a volley of shots from one of our heroes, Robert's (Jackson again) throat-cutting gag, the serving of the ""gruel"" (I defy anyone not to feel queasy the first time they see that!) and, of course, the gross-out ""born-again"" final sequence.  Each of the gory set-pieces are strung together by some amusing dialogue and the paying of cheeky homage to everything from The Professionals, Doctor Who and Mad Max to The Waltons (yes, really!).

Not everything works, sure. I felt some of the shoot-out and pursuit sequences were a tad laboured and some of the gags struck me as very laddish in-jokes that only Jackson and his chums would guffaw at (I mean, what gives with the cardboard cut-out Beatles???) but just put it down to inspired lunacy and, rest assured that Jackson's inspired scattergun technique guarantees that the viewer will never have to wait too long for the next belly-laugh to appear.

Bad Taste is not as good as Braindead, but it still provides a lot of entertainment and is bound to appeal to those of you who love tongue-in-cheek horrors in the Evil Dead genre.  Perfect leave-your-brain-at-home fare after a few beers with your mates, but I'd skip the ""chunky bit"" if you're planning to enjoy a meal shortly afterwards!",1136851200,,2692,4.9118942731277535
1199293,3,B00000DFR0,"Bad Taste, Peter Jackson's first real feature film, was filmed on weekends over the course of many years.  This, in itself, is one of the film's most amazing achievements, since there are almost no mistakes, and a four year movie shoot would generally lend itself to many continuity errors, like characters looking different, etc.  Unbelievably, the film looks and flows as if it really is all talking place over the course of one very bad day for our characters.

  Bad Taste, like Peter Jackson's other notorious early effort, Dead Alive, is a gore-comedy, made almost entirely for the gross-out factor, and to showcase some nasty and brutal make-up effects.  Even though this film is incredibly violent, if you are looking for gore, then stick to the Unrated Dead Alive DVD.  If you're looking for comedy, Dead Alive is still funnier, too.  For a gross-out comedy, Bad Taste nails the gross-out, and fails with the comedy.  There are two or three VERY funny scenes, (the sheep towards the end is CLASSIC), but Jackson's attempt at comedy ultimately falls short with amateur humor, centered mostly around the gore.

  However, there's a lot of fun to be had here.  Jackson's old visual style is in full-force here, with sweeping long shots of the New Zealand landscape (gorgeous) and very unflattering push-ins to low angle close-ups of the main characters during dramatic sequences.  Most importantly, though, for Jackson fans, is his relatively large role in this movie.  Yes, Jackson acts, and actually plays one of the film's funniest characters.  If you're a recent Jackson fan, steer clear, but if you like his older work, Bad Taste is a fun film, but ultimately one which loses a lot with each repeat viewing.  If you can rent it, I'd suggest doing that first.",1136592000,,1769,4.902356902356902

Using next to no money, Jackson was able to make a very entertaining and memerable mark in celluloid history, and he should be forever remembered for it. Hail to the king, baby!",1133827200,,546,4.310679611650485
1199295,5,B00000DFR0,"Bad Taste is one of those movies that people will either love or hate. It has an extremely low budget, the acting is all over the map, the editing and direction is questionable at times and the movie's twisted sense of humor might come across as just plain vile to a lot of folks. But this is one of those rare instances where the movie's faults work for it instead of against.

Bad Taste was writer/director/actor Peter Jackson's 1987 debut and immediately established him as a force to be reckoned with in the horror film community. The movie actually began production in 1983. Peter and his friends (who worked as most of the cast and crew) filmed it on weekends with funding from the New Zealand Film Commission, who thought they were making a documentary on insects.

Given the erratic stop-and-go nature of the film's production, the end result is actually very solid and any continuity errors that could have easily resulted were kept pretty much to a minimum. Peter Jackson's budding talent as a director is also very evident from the start as the movie features some special-effects and camera shots that look better than the budget should have allowed.

The plot involves a secret government task force (whose initials spell A.I.D.S.) that is sent to investigate the disappearance of a whole town's inhabitants and the rumors of possible alien invasion. Derek (Peter Jackson) is the leader who clearly has quite a few screws loose. Ozzy (Terry Potter), Barry (Peter O'Herne) and Frank (Mike Minett) round out the group. There is also some sort of a tax-collector named Giles (Craig Smith) who gets captured by the aliens and the agents end up rescuing him. Turns out that humans are the new fast-food craze on the alien's home planet and they are the ones who have wiped out the town. The agents use whatever force deemed necessary to wipe out the aliens and send them back where they came from.

And that's basically it. The paper thin plot is mainly an excuse for the cast and crew to go absolutely berserk with the special effects, gore, off-the-wall characters and some truly tasteless humor.

The movie's biggest selling point is the extreme amount of gore. Some of the best scenes involve Derek falling off a cliff and cracking open his skull. A piece of his brain falls out and he constantly is sticking it back in his head and ends up having to tie a belt around his head to keep the flap of skull from flying open. There's also an alien who gets cut in two by a chainsaw, a sheep that gets blown up by a rocket launcher (one of the most memorable scenes I should add), an alien who gets hit by a car and splits in half (the aftermath in which has the top half of his body being still very much alive and it proceeds to toss pine-cones at the agents is one of my personal favorite scenes and is very funny). One of the most infamous scenes that is guaranteed to make people's stomachs turn is when an alien vomits up a disgusting blue substance into a bowl and all of the other aliens proceed to drink the vomit (don't even start to ask why!) There are quite a few other graphic moments involving heads getting partially shot off by handguns, heads being impaled by sledgehammers, and limbs being torn off in explicit fashion. Only people with twisted sensibilities and strong stomachs need apply.

Peter Jackson actually did most of the special effects himself and they are actually quite solid throughout. Of special mention should be when the aliens' house that is there secret headquarters takes off near the end. The model work was pretty convincing and was a ton better than what you would expect.

The acting is actually one of the funniest elements of the film. Peter Jackson is hysterically loony as the borderline insane Derek. Peter O'Herne's deadpan delivery of most of his lines are classic. Terry Potter looks like a mixture between a body builder and Richard Simmons while Mike Minett plays the stereotypical action guy. Everyone also doubled as playing some of the aliens and through some creative editing it appears that there's a lot more people in the movie than there actually is.

Since the film was filmed over such a long period of time the editing can get quite choppy at times, but due to the crazy and low-budget of the movie it actually helps the movie in a weird way. As I mentioned before, there are quite a few crazy camera shots and angles that give an early glimpse into the wild and original style that Peter would build upon and refine in his later pictures.

If I have one tiny gripe is that the movie could have trimmed a bit from its 90 minute running time. A couple of scenes drag just a bit and maybe with a few cuts the pacing could have been tightened up a bit in places.

Anyone who loves good cheesy-horror films that contains truckloads of gore and some very tongue-in-cheek humor would be wise to check out Bad Taste. It's easily one of the most audacious debuts in horror film history and a surprisingly efficient and confident debut from Peter Jackson.

The recent DVD release by Anchor Bay is fantastic. The film has been cleaned up considerably and is presented in anamorphic 1.66:1 widescreen and has been THX certified. It is available in both a single disc set that contains just the movie (extensive talent bios and a trailer are included) and a deluxe special edition that contains a really insightful documentary into the making of the movie. I recommend paying the 10 extra dollars and going with the deluxe version.

I went in knowing it was Peter Jackson's first feature and made on a shoe string budget.  So I wasn't expecting all the bell's and whistle's of a Hollywood feature, but I was expecting it to make up in it's cleverness and wit. (after all Kevin Smith's first movie ""Clerks"" was made under similar conditions and that was brilliant)
How wrong and disapointed I was though, the plot line was borderline transparent, and the only way I was able to follow what was going on was because of previous reviews and the docementry that was included. (which I watched first)  The acting was bad and the accents were so thick I could hardly make out what was being said a lot of the time
Ok so I didn't like the movie.  It's only my opinion right?  What really irks me is that I took a chance and splurged extra money, opting for this 2 disc limited edition package instead of the single disc edition, and it really is quite lacking.  The disc with the film on it is only 90 odd minutes and the only extra is a trailor of the movie.  The second disc contains a 25 min bio/doc, (made at the time of the movie 1987-8) of Peter Jackson and the making of the film.  It's a decent doc and gives some good perspective but why not put everything on the one disc?  I mean the space is there!  I paid extra money for the limited edition and for what a p'urty box cover and a plastic slip cover??
Where are the deleted scenes?  Extra footage?  The commentary tracks?  A blooper reel?

1199306,4,B00000DFR0,"Peter Jackson's directorial debut, ""Bad Taste,"" is a hilariously good time involving a whole lot of blood, guts, brains, the chugging of vomit and tons of laughs.  Done in the true slapstick-horror fashion, this is a disgusting and pleasantly demented flick that refuses to take itself seriously.  It's over-the-top in every way, and that's what makes it so fun to watch.  It's not recommended for people with weak stomachs, but people looking for carnage and laughs will feel right at home with this.

It doesn't have the most scientific or complex plot, but why should it?  It involves aliens from another planet that are disguised as humans--acting more like zombies, but they move a lot faster and are handy with automatic weapons.  The aliens are here for one thing only... hamburger meat--made from humans!  They have already completely massacred an entire town and plan to do the same to the rest of the world!  Now, it's up to a couple of goofball assassins to save humanity and take these extra-terrestrial psychos head on...  God help us all!

This was everything I was hoping it would be.  It's completely over-the-top, ridiculous and a real gross-out event.  What more could you want?  This isn't a movie where you're looking for brilliant acting or directing.  You just want to enjoy yourself.  The movie is purposely goofy, as it is never afraid to make fun of itself in many ways.  The best way I can describe this is it's ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" meets ""The Evil Dead.""  It's not scary, but since it is slapstick-horror it doesn't really need to be.  Considering how low of a budget Jackson and company had, it has some pretty cool and disgusting special effects.  I could never make something like this, that much is for sure.

As I said in the beginning, it's not recommended for people with weak stomachs.  Sure, it was made on a low budget, but the special effects are still disgusting enough to make you feel sick if you're not up for it.  You also have to not take this seriously.  If you try to take it seriously, then you will loathe every second.  Just sit back, relax and enjoy the chaotic freak show.  The limited DVD edition offers a really neat changing-cover.  The picture and sound is as good as it can get (the sound is the real prize, allowing you to hear all the squishy-squishy joy of blood and brains splattering all over the place!).  Special features include the theatrical trailer and a making-of documentary.

""Bad Taste"" is for anyone who has a sick and twisted sense of humor, and who is in the mood for something extremely goofy.  I think Peter Jackson should revisit the genera again in the near future, as he really shines in it with this movie.  I'm sure he has a lot of fun with it, too.

Derek, Bad Taste's lead hero is one of the zaniest (and dorkiest) horror stars to wield a chainsaw. His grunts and groans towards the end of the film crack me up everytime (especially after he slices one of the alien baddies' face in half). Derek's skill with the Stihl rivals that of Leatherface or even Ash. Robert, one of the aliens in human form, is obviously a handicapped extraterrestrial moron. Robert's character doesn't serve much of a purpose other than cheesy antics followed by gruesome scenes of having a rather long knife hammered into his heel, eating some chunky brains right out of the head of a recently capped alien, and a gag inducing close up of Robert's hot, steamy, regurgitated lunch creating a warm, chunky pudding for his fellow aliens to much on... mmmm. Its also cool to see Peter Jackson in such different roles, you can bearly even tell he plays both. This is fun to watch. The imaginative kills (chainsaw, followed by chainsaw-ist, through the head of an alien out through the ass) the one liners (""...I'm born again""), the New Zeland accents (""Did ya have to drink some chuck?""), and the obvious devotion the director and crew had while working on this film make this Peter Jackson's best.

The camera work and the editing are amazing.  The physical schtick is impeccably timed and photographed.  Despite the nothing budget, the technical aspects of this movie are outstanding.
Peter Jackson stars as Derreck(sp?), the sadistic, snivling scientist whose four man government agency, the Alien Investigation Defense Service, has been called upon to thwart a hostile alien invasion of a small backwoods town.  Jackson's Derreck is revolting and charasmatic at the same time - a truly original anti-hero. The aliens are actually employees of an intergalactic fast food chain that has just begun marketing human meat - and it is evidently delicious.  Can our four heroes save the relief worker (con artist) and foil the aliens' evil plan?

1199313,4,B00000DFR0,"After the success of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, it was pretty much inevitable that director Peter Jackson's old classics would be released to DVD.  Already available in a plain, single disc edition, DVD wonder Anchor Bay has re-released Jackson's Bad Taste in a limited 2-disc DVD pack.
THE FILM
Bad Taste was a sensation it was released, and it is a major cult film now.  Peter Jackson's 1987 debut picture finds four alienbusters coming to a New Zealand town, where the discover the town overtaken by aliens.  Of course, these aren't your everyday Sigourney Weaver aliens.  Un-uh.  These guys are part of the intergalatic food chain Crumb's Crunchy Delights, and all they want is some major human flesh to chew on.  Hmmm ...
Being Jackson's debut, the film obviously can't meet up to later hits like Braindead (a.k.a. Dead Alive) and Lord of the Rings, but there's some talent in here yet.  It seems like a backyard picture, and I suppose that's one of the reasons it's so popular.  What I do know is that it's gory, entertaining, and the most digusting film I've ever seen. [7/10]
THE VIDEO
Anchor Bay has done a terrific remastering job.  There isn't any grain anywhere.  A flawless work.  [10/10]
THE AUDIO
As all the voices in the film were dubbed after shooting, many times the words didn't meet the mouth movements.  Well, Anchor Bay has - somehow - fixed this problem with its lovely DD 5.1 remix.  No problem here.  [10/10]
THE EXTRAS
Well, if you consider the fact that it's a Limited Edition (of 50,000) an extra, then we got that here.  Anchor Bay's double-disc set includes a Peter Jackson bio, the film's trailer, and a very good documentary about the film: ""Good Taste Made Bad Taste"".  I think fans of the film will be pleased.  [7/10]
Cult film fans won't wanna miss this DVD release.  If you're a fan of disgusting horror or sci-fi with laughable comedy thrown in the middle, then this is the movie for you.  Those with a weak stomach will want to stay the hell away from this baby, though!
OVERALL SCORE: [8/10]
----------------------------------------------------------------
THE FILM: [7/10] Disgusting, funny, and very entertaining.  Essential for horror fans.
THE VIDEO: [10/10] A beautiful remastering job.
THE AUDIO: [10/10] Nice DD 5.1 soundtrack.
THE EXTRAS: [7/10] Very satisfying.
OVERALL SCORE: [8/10] Fans of the film won't wanna pass this DVD.

I must say, everyone who knows Jackson by his incredible endeavor of bringing the blueprint for the fantasy genre to life (it was well worth the wait and the effort IMHO) are going to be in for quite a shock when they see what he did before LORD OF THE RINGS!
BAD TASTE is a horror/comedy in the tradition of the EVIL DEAD movies, RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD, and RE-ANIMATOR; a quartet of commandos set up for alien activity take on an alien fast food restaurant chain whose specialty is human flesh! Along the way, the leader Derek (""I'm a Derek. Dereks don't run."") quite literally loses his brain after a nasty fall, a charity collector becomes part of the menu, heads splatter, guns go off, a sheep is blown to bits, and vomit is consumed (""I think the gruel is ready."")
BAD TASTE is the most cartoonish of the horror/comedy wave of the mid-1980's; it's like Looney Tunes with a Grand Guignol sensibility. This movie is like THE A-TEAM on acid; just imagine if those guys ever had to face alien invaders! But what appeals to me about BAD TASTE is the simplicity of the story and the execution; the special effects and the one-liners are the stars of this movie and the script and the plot are thin enough to accomodate the smirking attitude of the whole movie. A short film that slowly became something much more (an international cult classic), Peter Jackson's BAD TASTE is extremely recommended for cult horror enthusiasts, gorehounds and low-budget buffs alike!
Gotta love that cover art with the alien flipping the bird! The limited edition made it holographic so the other finger could go up (the British bird-flip) like on the standard release. The limited edition includes a little documentary on the making of BAD TASTE. This gives you some insight on Peter Jackson when he was starting out in the film industry. Yes indeed, this man has come a long, long way since this little film and now he is a highly respected and imaginative director.",1078272000,6,2260,4.624378109452737

Not everyone can make Citizen Kane or Blood Simple the first time.  Bad Taste is a lot like El Mariachi in how it makes you wonder just how much money do you need to make a movie?  If you watch the movie as a ""serious"" sci-fi horror film, then you'll hate it, as people have.  Bad Taste is sick, yes, but it's odd how in the ways the Evil Dead movies are made, on the surface as horror movies, but actual comedies.  The special effects are corny and the dialogue could have been written by a ten year old and most of the actors look like rejects from a garage band, but that's the whole idea.  Bad Taste was the training wheels.  LOTR is the Tour de France.  Peter Jackson has grown and for what it's worth, Bad Taste will always be the movie that got him going.  Gross-out humor doesn't always have to be about flatulence.  How about eating brains?!  The scene of Derek (PJ) torturing alien Robert (PJ again) is cleverly done.",1075852800,,1076,4.383838383838384

1199319,5,B00000DFR0,"What do The Lord of the Rings:  The Return of the King, Heavenly Creatures, and Bad Taste all have in common?  Absolutely nothing, except for the fact that they were all movies directed by Peter Jackson and were filmed in his native country of New Zealand.

Known for his silver-screen renditions of The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the Borovnian classic, Heavenly Creatures, Peter Jackson has established himself as premier director in today's entertainment industry.  A star he is today, but what was he yesterday?
Peter Jackson's directoral debut came in 1987 when he produced the movie aptly named Bad Taste.  Sporting an incredibly low budget and four long years in the making, Bad Taste would shock audiences around the world.  Shocking, not only because of the incredibly stupid story, the humorous, over the top violence, and the crazy New Zealand accents, but shocking because this movie was actually somewhat decent in the eyes of both moviegoers and critics alike.  A decent splatter horror movie?  Start pinching yourself now.
The wild plot of Bad Taste starts off in a small New Zealand town that is being taken over by the intergalactic Lord Crumb and his army of alien marauders, who are planning to ""harvest"" the inhabitants for an interplanetary chain of fast-food restaurants.  However, Derek (who is played by Peter Jackson himself) and his mates from AIDS (the Astro Investigation and Defense Service) are sent in by the government to destroy the
enemy and ultimately save mankind.  The synopsis might be maniacally sophomoric, but the point of this movie is not to sweep the Academy Awards, but instead to make you laugh, which it easily does.

Along with the crazy script, Bad Taste further induces blissful insanity with an outrageous hailstorm of exaggerated violence.  So graphic, that it is funny, I still find myself laughing today.  Unfortunately, I can only say so much though before I sound like a deranged madman.  You have to see it to believe it.

Accompanied by an unfathomable amount of red dye, Bad Taste is also supported by a solid cast and setting.  Reflecting the same cinematic beauty of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, the scenery in Bad Taste ironically parallels the actions of the cast.
Considering the tight budget that Peter Jackson had to work with, the cast is incredibly solid.  The characters not only get the fundamental job done, but they also improvise more humor and add distinct personality to the story as well.  If you like Foster's beer commercials you'll also enjoy the intense accents of the New Zealand cast.

A very picky person when it comes to movies, I am the type of person that typically likes a very serious movies with a prevalent theme.  Movies about street racing or some crazy man running around with a chainsaw or a meat cleaver do nothing for me.  It is a great contrast for me to say I enjoyed Bad Taste, but I cannot lie to myself, the movie was amazing.  Maybe it was because I stayed up too late on New Year's Eve, or maybe it is because there is something different about this movie.

The ultimate indy horror flick, Bad Taste is something you have to experience.",1072915200,,3143,4.801115241635688
1199320,4,B00000DFR0,"If Peter Jackson gets the Oscar for ""The Return of the King,"" as recognition for his effort with the entire film trilogy of ""The Lord of the Rings,"" this 1987 effort will be the skeleton in his cinematic closet.  Actually it would be his partially decpaitated head.  Not even Francis Ford Coppolla's ""Dementia 13"" can compare to Jackson's novice effort, which wallows in special effect gore at each and every opportunity.  The story has ""The Boys,"" four less than brilliant members of the super secret New Zealand Astro Investigation And Defense Service, being sent to a small New Zealand fishing town to investigate a UFO report.  What they find is that aliens have indeed landed and taken human form so that they can slaughter the humans to use as the main menu item for an intergalactic fast-food chain.  Fortunately the aliens all wear blue work shirts, so the boys can tell who wants to eat their brains and avoid them or find a particularly gruesome and bloody way of killing them.
Shot over four years (sort of like Orson Welles and ""Othello""), for $11,000 of his own money (sort of like with Robert Rodriguez's ""El Mariachi"") before a grant allowed him to finish the project, and despite the profusion of blood and brains, ""Bad Taste"" shows Jackson's raw film making skills.  Forgetting about the squirting blood and the intentionally bad acting, and try paying attention to Jackson's use of camera angles because he knows what he is doing.  Besides, it is hard not to embrace a film that glories in its low budget and amateur cast.  More than anything else ""Bad Taste"" reminded me of the mini-musical version of ""The Night of the Living Dead"" that I caught on late night cable twenty years ago, although I have to admit that Sam Raimi's ""The Evil Dead"" gets the obvious credit for the idea of turning the horror film into slapstick comedy.  Ozzy (Terry Potter), Barry (Pete O'Herne), Giles (Craig Smith), and Frank (Mike Minett) certainly crack some bad jokes, and was surprised that I actually understood most of the ones that were Kiwi specific.  The story is just an excuse for the fun but Jackson still manages to poke fun at various cinematic conventions, usually by embracing them in some extreme fashion.
If you are wondering how Jackson got from ""Bad Taste"" to ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" then the film from his resume that you want to check out is ""Heavenly Creatures.""  But this is just something compelling about the high energy and over the top schlock that makes this film so enjoyable, providing you can keep your eyes on the screen during the bloodletting.  Jackson served as producer, writer, director, cinematographer, actor, makeup, special effects, and editor. The actors were all friends while his Mum and Dad were the executive producers.  Jackson's next film, ""Dead Alive,"" is  Besides, if there was ever a film whose title shrieked a warning at its potential audience, it would have to be this cult classic science fiction gorefest.  Cleary there are those who looked at ""Bad Taste"" and concluded this Peter Jackson was either a budding genius or a certifiable loon, and when Hollywood rendered its judgment by flipping a coin, it obviously landed on its edge.",1072137600,,3194,4.834862385321101

Right from the start the movie opens up with excellent blood and gore. A very good move by Peter Jackson, surprisingly the movie gets better and better as more blood and gore come into play. The cheezy atomsphere, low-budget actors, and senseless gore really gives the movie a good sense of humor. Besides the movie, the limited edition dvd is even better. Anchor bay never disappoints you, the transfer is amazing, the sound quality is outstanding as well. The dvd offers surround ex, and 6.1 dts tracks. The movie also comes with the making of Bad taste which also makes the movie well worth your time.

It also took four years to make and you can tell they had a blast.  You get a extra disc with 25 minutes of footage about the film.  It gives you a glimpse of the genius of Peter Jackson.  The makeup and FX are better than more expensive movies.  Just keep an open mind with the film and enjoy.  It's a laugh riot.,1066003200,,475,3.9893617021276597
1199323,5,B00000DFR0,"One of my all time favorites. A gore filled masterpiece has some of the grossest and funnist moments i've ever seen my favorite being the part where the aliens head is twisted off and kicked through the window like a soccerball or when Derek chainsaws right through the alien and says ""i'm born again!"" that was the sh*t. There is plenty of gore in this one too. Sledgehammers bashing heads in, heads popped off, shootings, chainsaw fun, brains getting blown out, one alien eating the brains of his friend with a spoon right after and more. I liek this one WAY more then dead alive. This one has much better charaters my favorite being Derek the nutty scientist/leader who is played by Mr Jackson himself, who falls off of a cliff and loses his mind while fighting one of those bastards, the body count in this is pretty high it must be in the 90+ region. After this Peter Jackson went on to make Meet the Feebles a puppet parody, then did Braindead (Dead alive). The story is like this a bunch of aliens have made a small town into hamburger meat and its up the A.I.D.S to stop them. For a low budget movie this one is done extremely well (Better then Andreas Shanss can ever do) and the acting isn't that bad either.

1199325,5,B00000DFR0,"Back in 1988 I read an review in a magazine called Gorezone(a brother magazine to Fangoria that called it quits after only a few issues) of a film called Bad Taste and there were a few teaser pictures.  It certainly looked unique.  I rented it right when it came out and was totally in awe when I watched it.  I had never seen anything quite like it.  ""Monty Python Meets Re-Animator"" is how it was described in the magazine.  Not totally accurate, but not far off.  I illegally dubbed the film and watched it numerous times, showed it to everyone I knew.  Sure, it looks like it was made for about thirty bucks, but Jackson managed to get the most out of a budget this small.  But I can tell you folks, back in 1988 I could never, ever have guessed that the guy who made this film would make the Lord Of The Rings movies.  I thought Jackson would be nothing more than a minor cult figure.  None of his films are like LOTR which makes me wonder how he got the job.  I'm sure Hollywood execs aren't big on Bad Taste's and Dead Alive's.  But this is where it all began, and in my opinion will always be the best film Jackson ever made.  If you enjoy wacky humor with your gore, you'd best get your behind down to your local dvd retailer, pronto!  Or if you've seen Dead Alive and loved it, and would like to see a more toned down(but just as funny) flipside, then do not hesitate.",1061164800,,1378,4.209923664122138

And not just any aliens -- capitalist aliens! Alien entrepreneurs! Interstellar bastards who plan to promote human flesh as the latest fast-food taste sensation, under the banner of Crumm's Crunchy Delights! It's hysterical.

1199328,1,B00000DFR0,"I love Dead Alive (released as Brain Dead is Aus), am a big fan of the Evil Dead series and am generally much in favour of tasteless, gory comedic horror movies that would sicken most normal people, but I just can't classify this movie as anything other than total rubbish.  I was just at the point of placing an order for this DVD becasue of recommendations on this site and comparisons to Evil Dead, Dead Alive etc but luckily I rented a copy from my local video store before parting with my cash.
How can I describe whats wrong with this movie?  Well its full of senseless over the top gore, and I know that sounds like a good thing, but wheras the gore in Dead Alive, and Evil Dead 2 caused me to laugh uproariously Bad Taste just left me feeling slightly grossed out and completely unsatisfied, sort of like Id just eaten some expired shrimp. Its not that its overly realistic, and you can tell its meant to be funny but somehow it just doesnt come off.  The level of the movie is set from the moment we are introduced to the character Derek (Peter jackson elevating overacting to an art form) with a gigantic trail of drool haning down his chin, and it doesnt get much better as the movie progresses.  If that kind of stuff amuses you then you may love Bad Taste but its not my cup of tea.
I didn't even remotely feel like laughing for the first half of this movie, and the few laughs I did get towards the end from some very average jokes were shocked out of me because in contrast with the awfulness of the rest of the ""humour"" in the movie, at that point they actually seemed funny.
I could talk about the acting, special effects, music and plot here as well but I seeing as this is a low budget film and one of the directors first projects it can be pretty much assumed that they are all routinely awful and cheesy (and they are).  This can even be part of the appeal of this type of movie but its absolutely essential that the humour work for the movie to be entertaining and in this case it just doesnt.  In fact this movie has very little going for it apart from the various sickening special effects featured throughout, but as I already mentioned theres a very good chance you might not find these scenes as amusing as you think you might - because I sure didnt.
I found myself amazed while I was actualy watching the movie that it actually got distributed, and I was even more amazed by all of the glowing review for the movie that covered the box (one reviewer calling it ""the best movie of the year"" - must have been a very bad year for movie goers). I had to actually double check the tape in the VCR to be sure that the video store hadnt accidently switched it with some school kids bad home movie.
Do yourself a favour and stay away from this, watch Evil Dead 2 or Dead Alive instead, but if you feel you must have it at least try and rent it first.  Peter Jackson has directed some great movies but this ain't one of them.",1049673600,6,2944,4.255813953488372

The best character is Peter himself as the psyico leader Derek who lost his mind (really) about gettin those bastards. The last 17 mins are composed of a huge shootout. I Find this one better then dead alive because dead alive used wayyyyyyy to much dark humor and this one used tons of humor that anyone could laugh at.

In one part as I recall when Derek falls off the cliff you can see a bucket of fake blood being thrown into the air look closly.

1199337,5,B00000DFR0,"It is no surprise that when hollywood decided to do the biggest film project in the history of movies(three major feature films in two years), that they chose Peter Jackson to run the show.  This guy is what directors are made of, pure genius.  Bad Taste is Mr. Jacksons first feature film.  And, you can kinda tell from the production value.  But, still for being low-budget, this is an excellent piece of work.
Its about some town in New Zealand, that is invaded by aliens.  The aliens take human form and set out to hunt for dinner(humans).  I don't want to give to much away but there are extremely graphic scenes involving brains,blood, and vomit.  The acting is sub par but what do you expect for a b-movie.  I have never(and probably never will witnessed anything like this movie).  If you are into graphic violence, dark humor, and just plain screwball comedy.  Or if you would like to see Peter(Lord of the Rings)Jackson's earlier work, I would recommend Bad Taste.  Your in for a treat.",1029283200,4,996,4.634285714285714

From the director who is now getting great acclaim for The Lord of the Rings trilogy comes Bad Taste.  His first major film is grainy and raw with amazingly gruesome special effects that make you cringe and laugh at the same time.
If you don't think it'll be good...get a chunk of someone else's brain, put it in your skull, belt it up, and think again!",1027382400,,475,4.386363636363637
1199340,5,B00000DFR0,"Bad Taste is probably one of the most violent films you will ever see. Brains go flying, limbs all over the place, constant blood and a lot more fun treats. But what makes Bad Taste so tasty is the fact that all this is used for the pure sake of comedy.
The film starts out with four guys investigating some strange happenings in a town called Kaihoro (which translates to 'eat hungirly'). When strange people start showing up in blue shirts and attack them, they get a little suspicious. When they follow one of them to a mansion, they discover just what is going on and why everyone in Kaihoro is gone. Now, it's up to them to shoot them all up. I won't give away anymore than that.
While the violence is fun and makes me laugh most of the time, the bulk of the film is spent on gun play. I must say, this film does to a good job at it and it's not what you would expect in a gun fight. Also, it should be noted that the director, Peter Jackson, plays to major roles in the film. See if you can spot him yourself.
The DVD does even more justice to Bad Taste. You can listen to it in Dolby 2.0, 5.1 and DTS. The extras even hold up well too, offering the original trailer and a bio on Peter Jackson with filmography. Plus, the insert in the package has 20 facts on the show. These were really fun to read. You can even find the ingredients to the 'alien puke'.
Overall, Bad Taste is one fun film that has a lot of replay value and instantly become a hit with many people. Who ever knew something so gross could become something so funny.",1024704000,,1538,4.147157190635451

Just look at the movie cover. An alien flipping you off with an AK-47 and the title ""Bad Taste"" ? GENIUS!!! As many people in the past, they had to rely on the old Magnum Video version with the cheesy Movie rating system on the back. The sound was no so good, and the picture was a little dark and blury at times. Now that Anchor Bay (Those guys rule!) have re-released it along with many other cult classics not to mention Eurohorror movies all in DVD format in their glorius letter-boxed UNCUT versions. Another thing that amazed me were the special effects and how he used them. Chainsaw dismemberments, machetes though the neck, sledgehammers bashing people's brains out, ripping off various limbs...It just doesn't stop. And all of this is done for the comedy effect. The guy who keeps holding his brains in with a belt, the rocket missle accidently hitting and exploding the cute-looking sheep, and then there's that weird blue vehicle that has a cardboard-like figures of The Beatles from the cover of ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart Club"". I'm not going to ask what THAT was all about, but it was just funny. People, this is a classic.

There are two DVD's, but I can hardly understand why - the second DVD is just a single documentary (Interesting, but not hugely insightful) that could fit easily on the first DVD. There really aren't any extras, and the 16-page booklet is comprised of interviews which are apparently already available on the internet at a website listed in the book (I forget it, but I imagine you can find these interviews in your spare time with minimum expense). The quality of the film isn't much better than a VHS copy, either. When I bought it, I imagined that maybe there would be more reasons for the DVD than I could see just from the advertising. Sometimes, they don't tell you that the DVD contains a commentary track or deleted scenes, and you find it out for yourself. But that wasn't the case here.
It's a great movie, but I would recommend that you search for a less expensive copy first before you spend your money on this DVD, unless you're either a huge Jackson fan or you can't find any other copy.",1018656000,,1197,4.445454545454545

One of the most entertaining things is looking at the credits and noticing that all the same names are in it over and over again. If you love gore, you MUST see this movie.

The films opens with some beautiful New Zealand locations with Derek
the main character (and boy is he) with an alien hanging from one leg on a very high cliff. the alien is disguised as a human of course.
The plot is a bunch of dopey cannibal aliens land on earth to take back humans and open a fast food chain in outer space>.
The special effects are gory & bloody, some silly scenes like where one of the aliens is eating the brains out of some guys head that was shot earlier by Barry. Oh he's another one of the human heroes
The best (and most silly)scene is the one where the aliens capture this [guy] and tie him up and gag him. Guess where he winds up?

An alien race is trying to get humans for their restaurant franchise. The commandos spend the movie killing them. Blood and guts galore in this one to be sure.
Director Peter Jackson wrote, directed, and stars in this. He's the guy with the glasses that spends the entire movie trying to hold the back of his head together (his brain keeps falling out).
I made the mistake of eating a supreme pizza watching this during the 'barf cocktail' scene. A dude pukes a green fluid into a large punchbowl and it is passed around like a delicious McDonald's Shamrock Shake. It is steaming and has what appears to be cornbeef and corn floating in it. If the sight doesn't get you, maybe the sound will. They are drinking it up but are making puking and gagging sounds as they drink it. It was enough to make me lose my appetite, and I can sit through anything.

Pete Jackson does an amazing job with a budget that looks to be lower than the first EVIL DEAD film (which was $... by the way). He pulls off mindblowing camera tricks and gore stunts, carving his way through a wisp of a plot about some aliens (disguised as humans) who have come to Earth to steal human corpses for their intergalactic fastfood chain. Jackson would develop more substantial plots later, and I suspect this fun little mindless flick was just his way of showing off his action direting muscle, as well as earning some bucks to put into his next film. BAD TASTE combines the splat-stick humor of EVIL DEAD films and trhe in-your-face attack of TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE for a crazy ride. To check out a real scream of a hilariously sick film, check out Jackson's MEET THE FEEBLES.

Faint of heart need not apply - this was a gore-fest from the beginning.  Not having been into this genre until I saw the ""Evil Dead"" series and realized what wicked genius was involved, my further plunge into gore movies could not have been better heeded by this cinematic (dare i say ""no-budget"") marvel
This is what I wish more horror movies looked like - give me pointless gore - give me freaky POV shots give me bad acting - and better yet, give me unwatchable vomit shots.  After seeing this visual feast I realized how much Hollywood has been ripping me off with their mega-budgets - two or three freaky scenes and the rest is ""plot development"" and trying to appease censors to acheive a PG13 rating

1199349,3,B00000DFR0,"(First off, this is not a movie for the average viewer. Only horror nerds, and people who like cult films need apply.)
From evil dead to attack of the killer tomatoes, I am pretty much a pro at low budget horror movies. This movie, which i think was Peter Jackson's debut (now famous for Lord of the Rings, and Dead ALive) is actually quite a bit better than i had expected. The film itself is not overly groteque, but rest assured it has its moments, and when it is graphic the special effects are pretty... good. The story isn't to in depth and basically only 2 things happen, the aliens show up and the heroes fight the aliens, but whats there is good enuff. Peter Jackson ,who plays derrik (the coolest of the good guys) and robert (anh ... alien) is pretty funny... SFX wise the film is pretty cool. the aliens look like the guy on the cover, and have a neat hunched over walk. The fight scenes are quick and when guns are involved, not very interesting.
The movie itself, looks very good for an old indie film, the transfer is very crisp, and the widescreen bars aren't very big. Sound wise, there is no especially grand music, but the dialogue is easily heard and the music sounds fine and doesn't detract from the movie. As for extra's, there is a trailer and a bio on peter jackson, not real exciting. THe special edition has a booklet and a making of feature if you're really into extra's.
All said and done the movie is significantly better looking tahn it's low budget breathren. Story wise, it's not a Mind blower, but it has soem dumb fun and some cool special effects.(At one point Derrick gets a chainsaw, goodnes follows)... So if you like goofy, cheasy-gory, horror movies, This one is definately worth the cash. Oh and by the way, the comapny changed the origional cover of this film, to what you see now.

I thought the pace could have moved along a lot faster in most of the scenes, but you have to give Jackson credit for creating such a one of a kind hilarious and disgusting movie on such a low budget (He and his friends filmed on weekends over the course of a year). Some very memorable gore, like a guy getting the top half of his head shot off (and later on a different guy is seen eating from the remains with a spoon). Then there's some vehicular carnage when a person is run down by a car and his torso separates from his legs leaving intestines and other internal organs splattered all over the ground. Later on the guy driving the car (the eventual hero of the movie) goes on a rampage with a chainsaw and lays the smack down on some alien scum. Not to be missed.

1199351,4,B00000DFR0,"Okay, so the title of my review doesn't make a lot of sense.  Anyway, the plot is simple.  A small group of goofy government agents are sent to investigate a mass disappearance of the residents in a New Zealand town.  The disappearance is linked to a huge extraterrestrial fast food conglomerate which sets up shop in the town.  I shouldn't have to tell anyone what they put in the burgers.
This is Peter Jackson's first movie.  As many of you know, he went on to direct Lord of the Rings, as well as the equally gory Dead Alive and the more mainstream but still great The Frighteners.  However, this film shows how well he was able to work with a far more modest budget.  Some of the effects and action sequences are impressive considering the limited resources, especially the chase scene involving agent Derek (played by Jackson) and an alien zombie (also played by Jackson).
You should tell just by looking at the cover, which depicts an alien who looks like a Star Wars cantina reject flipping us the bird, that this is not to be taken seriously.  This really is not a horror movie as much as it is a comedy, an extremely gory comedy in which much of the humor revolves around the gore.  An example would be the hilarious scene in which Derek falls off a cliff and fractures his skull.  He literally has to keep his head together by tying his belt around it.
Even though I can't recommend Bad Taste to all audiences, I truly think people who like Monty Python or South Park may find something to enjoy about it.",1010275200,6,1516,4.4601449275362315

I think I look at it that way because I make mini movies myself, and look up to Jackson greatly. He shot Bad Taste on a 16mm video camera, and finished it over a span of four years. All the actors are friends of Jackson and helped the entire way. I love the way this movie leaves you feeling after you watch it.... Smiling, Laughing, and Almost Puking.

The gore is suprisingly well done with a lot of the special effects done by Peter Jackson himself (he also plays two of the main characters)----this man as a lot to live up to with the  Lord of the Rings Trilogy!",971308800,,585,4.318181818181818
1199367,5,B00000DFR0,THis is a must own Slaughter fest. Any fans of Horro and or Peter Jacksons  work will love this hard to find treasure. if you like sensless violence  and gore this is the movie for you,969321600,,184,4.083333333333333
1199368,4,B00000DFR0,"This is the first movie directed by Peter Jackson that made it big. Peter  Jackson, currently working on ""The One Ring"" (the big screen  adaptation of the classic ""Lord of the Rings""), is a rising star  from New Zealand, and has directed instant cult classics as BrainDead (aka  Dead Alive), Dangerous Creatures and The Frighteners.
Bad Taste is Peter  Jackson at his worst, or best, depending on your point of view. I found the  DVD immensely enjoyable. The story centers around the semi-brave  mercenaries from Astrological Intergalactical Defense System (yep, thats  AIDS for short) who have traveled to a small New Zealand town taken over by  Aliens with an appatite. In 90 minutes we see them battling the hordes of  mindless, zombie-like mutants, and no holds are barred!
Right from the  start things get wild. The guys from AIDS battle their way to the HQ of the  aliens where they infiltrate behind enemy lines (and even a little bit  deeper) to resque a hostage. After that the movie takes a rampant  Rambo-esque turn when an all out battle burns loose. Sure, the story may  not be that good, but its good fun!
Dont expect flashy computer generated  special effects. Expect lots and lots of gore! Expect bad jokes, bad music,  bad dialogue, but all with an incredible amount of fun! To sum it all up :  Expect Bad Taste! This is definitely one of those movies you will either  love or hate!
If you like movies like Evil Dead and Braindead you will  love this! If you're a serious movie buff steer clear!
Trivia : Peter  Jackson himself plays the hilarious Derek who has a tendency to lose little  pieces of his brains during battle. The complete soundtrack was done by the  main cast (dont you love small independant productions?).",969148800,5,1740,4.726666666666667
1199369,4,B00000DFR0,"Absolutely crazy horror comedy and Peter Jackson's (who is now busy making 'Lord of the Rings')debut movie. Gore and blood abound as 'The Boys' are called in to get rid of an alien menace killing townspeople to use them as  the latest fast-food taste sensation on another planet.
At one point,  one of our heroes, Derek, falls off a cliff and splits his head wide open -  the rest of the time he has to wear either a hat or belt on his head to  keep his brains in! Exploding sheep, aliens eating brains and vomit, 'The  Boys' killing everything in site and a starship in the size of old house -  this film has it all and twice over. All done with more than a hint of  humour, this extremely black-comedy, blood drenched from beginning to end  will make you laugh hysterically and feel a bit grossed out at the  on-screen display. Directed with passion, made over four years' worth of  weekends with a bunch of friends and virtually no-budget, this cult classic  is essential viewing for all horror fans, especially those who enjoy cheesy  humour. If you like 'Evil Dead 2' and the Monty Python films, you'll love  this - watch it now!",964483200,15,1134,4.4731707317073175
1199370,5,B00000DFR0,"The best horror movie I am sure that you folks out there will ever see, it comes with over 90 mins of extreme grossness, brutality, and humor that anyone who watches a good horror movie can apreciate. Do not let the cover  of teh movie get you sceptical because i believer very few words in it let  alone lots of swearing and such, so  do yourself a favor and rent it today  and you will be probebly be doing the same thing that i am and that is  buying this masterpiece and writng a reveiw on it because you like it so  much.

1199371,5,B00000DFR0,"The most fun you can have with brains, intestines and buckets of blood. For those who thought Dead Alive was a crazy and hilarious film, you need to watch this! It might not be quite as gory as DA, but when you have this much blood in a film, it's not going to matter.
I've not laughed at a horror film as much as I've laughed at this one, and that includes quite a few Tromaville and other Peter Jackson flicks.
My fave scene was the exploding sheep towards the end, though the PJ character's ""problem"" (don't want to ruin it for first time viewers) is very close.",960940800,,565,4.2407407407407405

1199373,5,B00000DFR0,"Wow! This movie realy roxxs! it's Peter Jacksons, tha' directors, first movie.........  and i have to say, he made a hell' of a job (it did take him 4 years to colmplete the movie, because finansing, or 'should we say  money problems). This is gore to tha' maximum....... blood, blood, blood.  And it maybe don't have tha' best of stories (cool aliens that are selling  human flesh as hamburgers to the fast food devition..... don't know how that  is speeled, i'm from Sweden, so anyway, they do that so they have food  supplys in hyper space, and then, we humans send in some UFO-hunters, to  exterminate them, but ofcourse, the hunters use waaaaaay to much violents  that is needed to kill those aliensbastard), but it seruantely, is one of  the best splatter movies ever made like Braindead (Dead Alive) and Evil  Dead! And it's great fun, the opposite of Evil Dead. So the fact remains:  yOU HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE ATLEAST ONE TIME IN YOUR LIFE!  Thank  ya' all folks......................
PS. Also see Braindead, (Dead Alive,  by the sam e director, Peter Jackson who also star in both tha' movies) if  you liked Bad Taste! Braindead have some more gore in it, and is atleast as  good as Bad taste....... what am i saying, YOU HAVE TO SEE BOTH, BAD TASTE  AND BRAINDEAD, if you realy are a splater/horror fan.
PSS. In Braindead,  watch out for the cool baby scene!",956188800,5,1369,4.609958506224066
