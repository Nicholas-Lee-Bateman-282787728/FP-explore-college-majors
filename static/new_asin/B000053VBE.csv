1392046,3,B000053VBE,"As a white boy from Ohio, I've always had a fondness for Blaxploitation flicks from the 1970's.  They were loud and bold, action-packed and takin'-no-sass.  They felt like renegade productions, and I dug everything about them.  The funky soundtracks, the outrageous fashions, the over-the-top acting and action.  Watching them now just takes me back to the 70's like an old song.

I'd never seen SLAUGHTER but caught it recently on a movie channel.

To be honest, I watched it for only one reason: Stella Stevens.

She's absolutely stunning.  She's so incredibly sexy in Jerry Lewis's THE NUTTY PROFESSOR and Dean Martin's THE SILENCERS that I discovered lust at a very early age.  Like 7 years old.  Not that I understood it, but I just knew she was hot in an other-worldly sense.  By the time THE BALLAD OF CABLE HOGUE and THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE rolled around, Stella was cemented as one of my all-time favorite Hollywood babes.

I didn't think SLAUGHTER looked that interesting but I did watch it for her.  Wow.  The other reviews I've read here also admit that they're giving this film a good review based on her.  I'm definitely in that category.

Otherwise, SLAUGHTER doesn't have the energy of other Blaxploitation pics.  The fish-eye lens during fights gave those scenes style but no punch.  Rip Torn is fun to watch as the villian.",1111449600,2,1340,4.828193832599119
1392047,3,B000053VBE,"Big, brawny Jim Brown makes a convincing hero in this two-fisted, jive-talking blaxploitation thriller.  The story moves with great speed and plenty of tough action as Brown hunts for the slayers of his parents and encounters a nest of racist gangsters.
Everything about this flick is a notch above the average blaxploitation flick of its era.  The direction is tight, the cinematography inventive and slick, and the performances are hammy without going too far.  A very young and very weaselly Rip Torn does a fine job as the pinched, hateful villain who really gets what he deserves.  Indeed, all the villains go down hard in this movie, which builds to a climactic conflict with a body count like a Spaghetti Western's.
Mention must be made of Stella Stevens, who has a number of short, but memorable, nude scenes.  Not to mince words- she's so fine that virtually any man watching will likely gape at the screen in awe.
Superior entertainment for blaxploitation fans and anyone who likes a rip-snorting action movie.",1044316800,11,1020,4.941520467836257
1392048,4,B000053VBE,"So, MGM hit the goldmine with Richard Roundtree's ""Shaft,"" so why not other companies?  Samuel Arkoff's AIP (American Internationa Picture), known for many exploitation films (a kind of films you might have seen at local drive-in theaters back in the 50s and 60s), gave an answer to John Shaft.  Yes, it's Slaughter, ex-Green Beret who takes the law in his hand for revenge.  And Jim Brown, former American football player, and previously seen in films like ""The Dirty Dozen"" was chosen.  Very Good casting, as it turns out.
Plus Brown (later seen in Tim Burton's ""Mars Attack!""), we have a good supporting cast, namely Rip Torn and Stella Stevens.  It was too good, I guess.  Anyway, with the presence of them, ""Slaughter"" is barely raised above from other average blaxploitation films, some people say...
Interesting thing is, the film's supporting cast almost all consists of white actors.  As a result, the atomosphere of the film is different from that of other blaxploitation films like ""Coffy"" and ""Shaft,"" and you may be disappointed because of that.  However, the good pace of the film (thanks to the director Jack Starret's deft hand) will keep you interested.  In my book, ""Slaughter"" is a better-than-average action film.  Oh, and there are nudity, which is No. 1 rule of this genre, including that of Stella Stevens (original ""The Nutty Professor"" and others).  Is this misjudge on her side when choosing projects?  Probably.  (She again shows up in blaxploitation film, the sequel of Warner Brother's ""Cleopatra Jones."")  But I am happy with her appearance, I confess.
On top of her participation, there is a rousing title song by Billy Preston, whose electoric keyboard with his trademark howling sound can be heard.  Probably ""Slaughter"" should be rated as an average three-star movie.  Well, his song, however, is another virtue of the film, and with this and Ms. Stevens, one notch up.  Yeah, I like this film.",1014940800,5,1928,4.993730407523511

1392061,3,B000053VBE,"Ex-NFL star turned actor Jim Brown plays a former Green Beret looking to avenge the death of his parents in Slaughter (1972), a violent blaxplotation thriller that provides ample opportunities for Brown to flash some of his best moves, in his first headlining role.  Although a B-move, the film has a solid cast that includes Don Gordon, Rip Torn, Robert Phillips, Cameron Mitchell, and Stella Stevens.

After his parents are tragically killed by a car bomb in his hometown of Cleveland, Slaughter (Brown) begins looking for the reasons why.  After crossing paths with the US Treasury, Slaughter learns that the man responsible for his parent's death is now holed up in Mexico.

With the Government's blessing, Slaughter heads south of the border to Mexico City to ferret out the killer.  The possible suspects are Mario Felice (Norman Alre) a local, or his business associate from America Dominic Hoffo (Torn), who is accompanied by his hatchet man Frank (Phillips).

Slaughter teams up with Harry Bostone (Gordon) a government agent, and begins his investigation.  Hoffo sends his girlfriend Ann (Stevens) to hang with Slaughter and feed him information, but she soon succumbs to his manly charms, as the shapely Stevens (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Poseidon-Adventure/dp/B000EHSVNW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Poseidon Adventure</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Nutty-Professor/dp/B00004WZ0C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Nutty Professor</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Silencers/dp/B0000CDRW1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Silencers</a>) appears in several nude scenes.

Things are kept pretty lively, as the movie features a series of violent action sequences, highlighted by one where Slaughter's running talents are put to the test, as he tries to avoid being flattened by a car.  Events build to a pretty dramatic conclusion as Slaughter and Harry raid the crooks' hideout, and the ex-soldier avenges his parents' death.  Robert Phillips is very effective as a heavy, and Stella Stevens gives her all in her role, and even takes a beating.

The Mexican setting gives Slaughter a very different flavor than your typical urban crime drama, and adds some interesting aspects to what is a rather routine storyline.  Jim Brown gets plenty of opportunities to display his physical skills.  Although he's not exactly smooth at reloading a gun, his acting style is perfect for this kind of hard edged macho adventure.  Brown would continue in the blaxplotation genre with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Gunn/dp/B0000WN154/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Gunn</a>&nbsp;(1972), and a sequel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Slaughter-s-Big-Ripoff/dp/B000053VBF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Slaughter's Big Ripoff</a>&nbsp;(1973).",1346716800,,2961,6.778364116094987
1392062,3,B000053VBE,"This 1972 American International Pictures (AIP) production is low budget, with stock footage obvious at times. Continuity/consistency issues might be annoying to some viewers; Slaughter's marksmanship, for example, goes from lousy point shooting tecnhique (punching his hand toward the target) to barely missing a baddie in the unnamed South American country. (It was Mexico, obviously, but the production was not allowed to name it because of the host's fears of negative tourism publicity.)

Decent soundtrack, though it doesn't live up to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/main-theme/dp/B001NZEKF2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">main theme</a>.

1392064,4,B000053VBE,"Now....this four star review does not refer to the confines of regular film criticism. What it refers to is the amount of fun a Grindhouse film fan can derive from this violent flick that ranks as one of the very best of the Blaxploitation genre.

Jim Brown plays a former Green Beret who has parents that were killed in a hit, which causes Slaughter to slaughter all those involved in a crazy plot that takes the mean mother to South America and includes a massive body count.
The film is made watchable by the cool presence of Brown. While not a great actor, the man is alot of fun to watch as he punches and shoots his way through numerous extras.

The film features an above average cast including Rip Torn as a mob boss who is Slaughter's enemy and is clearly above the trash. Don Gordon portrays the nerdy white guy who teams up with Brown and gives him extra muscle when gunning down various hitmen.
Cameron Mitchell, who appeared in more trash than any other actor with the possibility of John Carradine, provides a small role as a government agent offering Brown a deal to crack his case.

Stella Stevens is gorgeous in this picture as Brown's love interest and supplies one of the best shower scenes on record. Marlene Clark is also on hand as an agent that's upposed to look after Slaughter on his ""mission"", also providing alot of eye candy for the male viewer.

Add a catchy and ridiculous, funky theme song about our title hero and you have one of the most over the top action films of the period.

Followed by a sequel, the watchable ""Slaughter's Big Rip Off""(1973), the original is still the meanest.",1241740800,,1616,4.52054794520548

This movie is FUNNY AND WITH A VENGANCE!!!

I has CAR CHASES, LOTS OF SHOOTING, STUNTS, STREET FIGHTING, EXPLOTIONS AND PREETY LADIES!!!

For a low budget film this one have a good video quality and a good monaural sound, not to mention de widescreen with the big black boards.

P.S: Im glad that this movie has cool action scenes from the begining to the end!

1392066,4,B000053VBE,"Jim Brown is Slaughter, a Green Beret Vietnam veteran who's not long back from the service when his parents are killed in a car-bomb murder.  It turns out Slaughter's dad (it's never explicitly stated, but he was apparently involved in a mild hustle, like the numbers) somehow stumbled upon a computer printout of a Mob operation's payoff roster.  But he was killed before he could make a deal for its safe return.  Slaughter then makes moves to find the killers, while being shadowed by  Kim (Marlene Clark), an undercover federal agent.  A shootout at an airport puts Slaughter at odds with the U.S. Treasury Department, who then send him to an unnamed South American country to track down the surviving crooks.

Rip Torn is Dominick, the hood behind Slaughter's parents murder.  Norman Alfe is Mario Felice, a Mafia boss doing big business in Latin America and beyond.  Felice, who believes in the old codes of honor, is willing to bargain with Slaughter to get the payoff printout, and is distressed at Dominck's hot-headed brutality and wanton violence.  Stella Stevens is in her gorgeous prime as Ann, Dominick's main lady, who's set up to get information out of Slaughter, but ends up falling for him.  Character actor Don Gordon has a supporting role as Slaughter's reluctant partner, Harry.

The plot angle about the computer printout is a bit dated in this day of instant e-mail-- there's a line of dialogue in which an entire ""computer room"" is apparently moved to prevent discovery of its data.  Still, it's kind of a MacGuffin, and not essential to enjoy the action.

Slaughter doesn't suffer fools gladly, and seems to prefer fights to talking.  There are plenty of fights, chases and shootouts in this film, and the film even borrows a bit of James Bond, as a tuxedoed Slaughter mingles in a Mob-run casino.  Torn's Dominick is a cold bigot of a gangster, who really gets riled when it's clear that Ann has fallen for him.  The gun-heavy climax takes place on Felice's Spanish-style ranch, giving the film a touch of updated Western tone.

this film spawned one sequel, ""Slaughter's Big Rip-Off"", but the character should have continued on, like James Bond..",1158451200,,2173,4.877384196185286
1392067,4,B000053VBE,"Slaughter is cool.  In his own words, ""The coolest cat to ever walk the earth"".  There were alot of black film heroes to come out of the 70s, but Slaughter has gotta be one of(if not THE) coolest one.  Black Caesar and Superfly were likeable but scummy like Tony Montana.  Shaft was cool and took no crap, but wasn't a total butt kicker.  Slaughter has more in common with the Pam Grier characters(but male of course) in that he's a shoot first, ask questions later kind of guy that'll smack the taste out of your mouth.  He's the black answer to a Charles Bronson type of film character.  He's an excellent shot with his gun-In fact, I think throughout the two Slaughter films, he only misses his target twice!  And that's only coz the plot requires the villain to temporarily get away so Slaughter can annihilate his ass at a more appropriate time and place.  All the chix want to sleep with him too.  Through the two Slaughter films, he's taking on the mob.  First they kill his parents, then Slaughter goes about shooting and/or beating the snot out of everyone who gets in his way as he climbs to the top of the organization.  Not the most original of plots, but Jim Brown plays it cool.  He looks big and mean.  Not the kind of guy I'd wanna mess with.  I'd definitely recommend both films.",1137283200,4,1296,4.432203389830509
1392068,4,B000053VBE,"This is quite an entertaining 70's action movie.  The acting, as in most action movies, is a bit superficial, but the overall movie is solid.  Jim Brown, given his impressive size, is perfect as a tough action hero.  The majority of the movie is set in Mexico, thus giving it an exotic feel.  The racial epithets by the villains also give the movie an appropriate sense of the palpable racism of the 70's. Rip Torn gives an over-the-top performance as the main bad-guy Hoffo.  As noted in the other reviews, Stella Stevens is perfect eye-candy in her supporting role.",1111622400,5,567,4.686868686868687
