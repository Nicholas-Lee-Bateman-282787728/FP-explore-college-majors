8755382,1,B01DALQ17G,I would give this movie  half a star if possible. Didn't know we were renting a foreign film. Horrible dubbing. Not worth watching.,1475193600,,131,4.695652173913044
8755383,3,B01DALQ17G,"This movie is not in any way affiliated to ""honey, I shrunk the kids"" they changed the name for  Americans. The movie is originally called Wiplala based on a Dutch children's book. The voices are dubbed and you're children won't care.",1471564800,6,234,4.7073170731707314

8755388,3,B01DALQ17G,"A single parent family without Rick Moranis have their home invaded by Wiplala, a small individual from Wiplala. He has limited magical or betwinkling powers. At some point in time in the film he shrinks the family and lack the confidence to unbetwinkling his spells.

This is a Dutch production fairly dubbed. I didn't find the characters or the story interesting, but I'm not 9 either. I found Geza Weisz is be annoying. Dad is a professor who teachers Roman and Greek history. Brother and sister get along more like friends than siblings.",1466208000,2,541,4.817204301075269
