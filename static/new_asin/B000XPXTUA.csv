3004931,5,B000XPXTUA,I loved this movie. It is better than most of the movies that I've seen in the theater or on rental. It is a whole family movie with a good message. Many of the actors were debuting and did amazing. I especially loved Bryton Myler who played Eric in the movie. This is one you want to have in your home to watch with your kids over and over!!,1413244800,14,342,3.971014492753623

3004934,4,B000XPXTUA,"This very short film is essentially a joke. I mean that literally. The explanation (but not a spoiler) is below.

The entire film is set in a bar. Two men are sitting at the bar when three women enter. JT, one of the men, (played well by Scott Newson) approaches Stacy (Daniela Mangialardo), one of the women whom he knows. When he hits on her (for lack of a better term), she is outraged and wonders how he could approach her ""after what [he] did."" She upbraids him some more, and he shoves her. There follows a fistfight, Stacy vs. JT. JT looks like a tough guy, but he hasn't a chance and ends up beaten and on the floor. At that point, we find out what he did, and therein lies the punchline to the joke. (If you watch carefully, you'll find another joke. When the DJ switches music discs, the title of the DVD-R he inserts is ""The Last Straw: Music Video Back-grounds."" There are probably other jokes, but, if so, I missed them.)

""The Last Straw"" is an amusing little film. The fight scene could have had better choreography, but there are some nice bits to it, and the camera work is quite good. Indeed, given what must have been a very low budget, the film looks and sounds great. There's also a catchy little song by Angeline Wynn, one of the cast members, during the end credits.",1200355200,,1289,4.344398340248962

3004960,1,B000XPXTUA,This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen... it could have been good if the acting was better.  Even Corbin acted like he has never acted before.,1421193600,3,153,4.1

3004964,5,B000XPXTUA,"Acting at high level capturing a family and neighbors interacting and caring for each other while they experience what life throws at them.
This movie addresses cyber bullying, hazing, loss of parents and spouse. Most importantly it tells us with Christ, Family and Friends we can overcome.",1420156800,3,290,5.191489361702128
3004985,5,B000XPXTUA,"A really fun family movie.  Corbin Bernsen was so funny -- he is always good in any part he plays, but I especially enjoyed him in this.  A movie to watch any time, not just at Christmas.",1419206400,4,187,4.027027027027027
3004986,5,B000XPXTUA,My wife and I loved this holiday movie. It is a good example of a modern family's Christmas.,1419206400,,92,4.166666666666667
3004987,4,B000XPXTUA,"The Last Straw is a feel-good movie based on a children's story by Paula McDonald, a well-known photographer from Wisconsin who lives and works in the Oaxacan coast of Mexico. The family it portrays could be from Main Street, USA, 4 pre-adolescent children with the older girl and boy at each other's psychological throats on a daily, even hourly basis, and a couple with a stay-at-home mother who can be driven to tears by these older children's bickering. And all this during the Christmas season, to boot! the unexpected visit of a troubled adolescent girl cousin becomes a disruptive lightening rod for the family and neighboring relationships. The movie touches, with humor and tenderness, on issues of bullying, elder-young/sibling/parent-child relationships/peer-peer relationships. It's message centers on the values of compassion, companionship, generosity of spirit, and gratitude. It is current in a themes related to school relationships--good and bad ones. Chidlren, adolescents, and adults will be moved, amused, and pleased. Some may react to its religious theme involving the Baby Jesus while others may interpret the B.J. in its symbolic meaning of death and rebirth in one's life and relationships.",1418688000,,1216,5.473404255319149
3004988,5,B000XPXTUA,This movie brought tears to my eyes watching it. It reminds me of movies I have watched in years past with the family values and caring about your neighbors. I recommend it for families with children hoping to remind them about the true meaning of Christmas. The movie has an additional story line that makes it relevant to current times. I am adding it to our Christmas collection to watch every year.,1418601600,3,402,4.597222222222222
3004989,5,B000XPXTUA,"The book is already a timeless classic and now the movie will be too.  Great story, great acting with times to laugh and times to cry as it brings back memories from your own life.  The practice of the last straw will bring giving, caring and loving back into any home.",1418601600,2,269,4.254901960784314
3004990,5,B000XPXTUA,Want a wave of happiness to engulf your family? Sit down together and play 'The Last Straw'. It is a wonderful tale with a happy ending.  It has the family values and atmosphere of the 1950s and is full of uplifting characters and positive sentiment.,1418601600,2,250,4.555555555555555
3004991,4,B000XPXTUA,This movie was a hoot and at the same time strummed the strings of my heart.  Makes one remember the true meaning of XMAS.  I think there will be many families being nicer to one another and valuing each other more.  The were tears in my eyes!,1418601600,,243,4.127659574468085
3004992,5,B000XPXTUA,We watched this last night with the kids. Half the family was crying at the end of the movie because it was touching. Its a sweet story and my kids already woke up this morning wanting to watch it again! There should be more family friendly movies out there like this that teach a beautiful lesson like service.,1418515200,2,311,4.379310344827586
3004993,3,B000XPXTUA,"After reading the reviews I decided to order this movie, having never seen it.  I am a huge fan of Christmas movies and, based on the reviews, figured it was going to be a nice addition to my collection.
After watching it, i can only say it was simply okay.  Yes, it is a contemporary story without all the sappiness or corniness of some of the older movies, but, there seemed to be little substance to the story.  Yes, the kids bickered constantly, but  the mother crying and calling her husband home from work to help her deal with them seemed a bit melodramatic.  I can't imagine calling my husband and expecting him to leave work to help me handle our unruly kids.  Her idea of doing good deed was nice but seemed a bit contrived.  I liked Corbin Berson and he might be the only reason for the three starts, otherwise I might have given it only 2.  Won't be grabbing it from the collection to watch again any time soon.",1418428800,9,923,4.325581395348837

It is clean and some parts are quite funny.  This is one I would like to add to my movie collection someday, as we checked it out of the library to watch it. But it's a keeper.

I only have one question about it, if anyone has the answer....we noticed the credits thanked the McDonald family, as this is based on a true story.  But the credits also mentioned that Eric McDonald ""is no longer with us.""  Does anybody know what happened to him?",1418169600,2,600,4.3125

The addition of the Niece, and the reason she was spending the holidays at her Aunt and Uncles, was both believable and a subject that needs more attention. Her redemption was heartwarming and well done. The rest of the family, especially the young daughter, are believable as ""bad"" but the ""straw"" solution was totally unbelievable. At $18 I cannot recommend. Look for this at under $10.",1417478400,,647,4.568965517241379

3005004,5,B000XPXTUA,I really enjoyed this sweet family film about helping one family find the spirit of giving during the Christmas season.  There is a little something for all ages here.  The older elementary school age children bicker the most.  A teenage cousin comes to stay for Christmas and has her own demons to battle from high school life.  The older neighbor and his college age son join in many family activities including family football.  Together they help each other find the true meaning of Christmas.  I was in tears at the end as family members did things they didn't think they could do.  I loved sharing this story with my family.,1414540800,9,630,4.672727272727273

The older neighbor and his college age son join in many family activities including family football.  Together they help each other find the true meaning of Christmas.  I was in tears at the end as family members did things they didn't think they could do.  I loved sharing this story with my family.,1414540800,9,630,4.672727272727273

8229034,1,B000XPXTUA,"I would give this zero stars if I could. I used to be an atheist before Jesus revealed who He was to me and the truth about heaven and hell and salvation 11 years ago. No one ever told me the gospel or anything about God. Just vague reference to this or that but mostly how one can just be a positive thinker or work hard/will.power and all that sruff, and it'll all work out. Nothing about who God really is, or about a relationship with our Creator nor abour who Jesus is and what He did for us. It's no wonder there are so many unbelievers in America (and world) who say they know God but really only a vague concept. I say this because this movie is exactly what is wrong...nothing pointed to Jesus as Savior or Lord. Nothing to our wonderful heavenly Father nor about His great love for us to save us from our sins.

I remember as an atheist I thought Jesus was some fictional baby/feel good character in a manager next to Santa - a great concept to illustrate how humans should strive to be. But He wasn't real. I was never taught that He actually existed and walked on this earth. And more importantly, No one said anything about Him as a grown up; about His ministry and work on the cross...the whole reason He came at Christmas.

 This movie points to humans as the solution and Savior, not Jesus. It speaks the same humanistic mumbo jumbo, positive message that the secular world believes and preaches. But after trying for 38 years with the humanistic approach utterly failing me and my relationships, and being so confused as to how to do right and to have healthy relationships, God gave me mercy and grace and showed me who He was when no one else did (even those so called Christians). The true meaning --help and hope of God -- is hidden and buried in secular humanist psychology and feel good motivational speaking and therefore lost to those who are needing God. This movie is a perfect example of this evil. It's evil because its a secular movie but uses the name of God and deceives people, pointing them to a wrong version of God.  It is using God to appear all warm and fuzzy and hence safe, but is in reality a thief because it has no intention of pointing people to God, but to point people to human effort and spirit and ability. God gets no glory, no acknowlegment, or even thanks (especially at the end). So what's the point of using God's name if you did really need Him or acknowledge that it was His power that helped? Whats the piint of Jesus in the manager if one doesn't say why a baby in a manager has any impact at all? Tell the story, people, about God if you're going to use His name and image!

I say, enough with the carefully packaged commercializarion of gFod for your proft to sell a feel good movie. Dispense with it and be honest...Just cut to the chase and make it a film about principle and concept and 'moral of the stoey' allegory style and use Santa as the main figure. What they did was make God appear as another rendition of Santa which is exactly what I used to think He was when I was an atheist.

If you are a Christian and are wanting to point people or family or your children to God, this movie is NOT for you. It will introduce more harm than good for it plants the seeds that God is more an allegory than a real being, and that we have the inherit ability to work things out ourselves if given time --that we don't really need God's help. The truth is, we really need help. We need someone to pay for all the sins we've committed in the past and the ones we will invariably commit in the future, no matter how hard we try. We need a Savior who can forgive us and wipe out all our trespasses so as to have eternal life wirh no more fear or guilt or shame. We need to know we matter and are of great worth and value; so much so that God came Himself and died for us, taking the punishment we would have gotten, to show us just how much He values us. We need to know someone is willing to die to what they want for the sake of anothers needs - and He did so eagerly and willingly. He is willing and able to help us in our life and struggles now, not having to wait for heaven to obtain it, so we may grow in joy and peace and hope. We don't have to work it out alone orninnour own strength. He came to help and save because He loves us. But we have to want help and know that we can and should ask for help from Him. Humans can only do so much, but God is perfect and able to all things.

This has been a long review, but my family and I felt it was important people know about the deception and pretense that is happening in this movie, and other places too. We wanted people to be aware of the attempt to push an agenda that seeks to sway you into feeling all warm and fuzzy and even give hope. We wanted to spare you the confusion when the methods the movie espouse fail and you wonder why God failed you, or when life is still not working, you begin to beat yourself up over your failure to get things fixed. We also wanted to speak on behalf of God; that others may know that His character and the truth about how He works is being distorted, lied against and used for profit. We hope that each will earnestly seek the truth to find out for themselves and not be deceived and mislead by those who have a warped intent so as to use God rather than honor Him. You will then be free to make your own, informed choice instead of being tricked into thinking you got a good deal or true information, only to find out in the end it was a lie and perish. Read the book of John in the bible and read testimonies of those whose lives were transformed by Jesus. Then you will know the true Christian side of the story wherein you can make an informed decision. Please do not base decisions about God or your self worth upon this movie or others like it (or even books, seminars, counselors or preachers who do the same).

we were so dismayed at the deception and for profit greed in their motive to make a pretense of being good and godly when they had no intent",1454025600,4,6013,4.17312661498708
