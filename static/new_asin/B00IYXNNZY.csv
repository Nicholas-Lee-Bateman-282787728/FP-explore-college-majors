8646677,3,B00IYXNNZY,I would like a refund for this DVD -  UTTER RUBISH.  No hits on the DVD at all.  No Music not singing.  The interview repeated it self over and over.  The manufacturers need to watch it and see for themselves.,1434585600,,209,4.125

8646679,1,B00IYXNNZY,"It was the same 10 minute interview replayed.  The video did not run for 1 and 1/2 as stated.  There were no ""The Story"", or ""The Hits"" sections. Just a couple of the same interviews repeated.  Maybe something was wrong with my DVD.  It was a mistake to buy this DVD.  In spite of the bad DVD, I still love Bruno Mars!",1424649600,3,318,4.064516129032258
