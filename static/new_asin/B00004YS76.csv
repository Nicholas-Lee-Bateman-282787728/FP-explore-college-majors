1378260,4,B00004YS76,This a typical Bob Hope movie. At times if is understated and at times it is funny. Not his best but pretty good.,1371859200,,113,3.9565217391304346
1378261,5,B00004YS76,"This comedy is also an intrigue or ""spy thriller"". Bob Hope and French comedian Fernandel make a very funny team. Anita Ekberg is a gorgeous agent working for a criminal organization. Martha Hyer is a diplomat who falls for Bob and tries to protect him from the criminals. Great shots of Paris and the French countryside. Bob has classic comedy scenes, such as the ""cigarette"" scene with Anita Ekberg and later when she kisses him in his cabin; the ""checkers"" game in the asylum; and the crazy ""rescue"" scenes at the asylum and in the air with Fernandel. Great fun!",1348358400,,565,4.66
1378262,5,B00004YS76,"I really enjoyed watching this movie-again.  It's been many years since first watchiing it on tele-b&w!  ""Who'da thunck it"" that I'd pay to watch Bob Hope-NOT!  I paid to re-live my boyhood ""lust"" for the Fine Miss Ekberg!  That's when ""the Chrome was thick and the women were straight""! I'd like to add, the women were just like I like 'em-thick too!",1323302400,,351,4.612903225806452
1378263,3,B00004YS76,"PARIS HOLIDAY comes at the point (1958) where Bob Hope's film career was just starting to slow down. I like Hope a lot, but watching this film I can see why he basically stopped making films after the mid-60s. It starts out with dull shipboard romance and hijinks, involving Hope (as ""Bob Hunter, famous American comedian) and Fernandel (as ""Fernydel, famous French comedian) as initial rivals for the affections of Ann McCall, an American embassy employee in Paris (Martha Hyer, who looks uncannily like Grace Kelly and indeed was billed as Universal's ""answer"" to Ms. Kelly for a few years). Meanwhile spy Zara (Anita Ekberg) is trying to steal something from Bob Hunter.

Turns out Hunter is supposed to have a script by the famous French playwright Serge Vitry (Preston Sturges - yup, the Preston Sturges who was one of Hollywood's great writer-directors a decade or two earlier) which he doesn't in fact have - a script that names a bunch of people who were involved in a counterfeiting scheme after WWII, and spy Ekberg and others are trying to get hold of it. So once the film moves to Paris, it becomes a comic spy caper - but a very, very broad and increasingly dull once, as Hunter gets trapped in a brakeless taxi that's supposed to take him to his death, and then committed to an insane asylum - where of course neither his nor now-close-friend Fernandel's antics help convince anyone that he's sane - and finally we get a very, very extended and ridiculous helicopter escape sequence with Hope dangling from a ladder of the chopper flown by the inexperienced French comic for a solid 10 minutes as gangsters shoot at him and he has to keep avoiding church steeples and chimneys.

Hope wrote the original story that the screenplay is based on, and produced the film, so I think he can take the blame for the lameness here as much or more than director Gerd Oswald. Little of his career after this point looks all that promising; I guess I'll be sticking to his earlier work for now, most of which is much much better.  Worth a look for die-hard Bob Hope fans or fans of the other stars I guess, but they've all done much better work.

NOTE ON THE DISC: As some others have mentioned, this is a pan-and-scan (1.33:1) transfer of a widescreen Cinemascope (well, ""Technirama"" in this case) film.  So you're losing over 40% of the image, and what's left isn't that great - dull and washed-out in the colors.  The transfer isn't any better on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Legends-of-Hollywood-Bob-Hope-Series/dp/B0012YO1L2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Legends of Hollywood - Bob Hope Series</a>&nbsp;box set, in fact I think it's the same one, but with that set at least you get 10 films for a good single price, and some of them are much better transfers.  I've got both; this disc I'll give away at some point.  I don't think in any case that there's a better version out there at the moment.",1283731200,,2949,4.848906560636183
1378264,4,B00004YS76,"After dabbling in drama--first with ""The Seven Little Foys"", then more deeply with ""Beau James""--Bob Hope returned to familiar territory with the comedy ""Paris Holiday"". Hope produced & penned the original story idea about an American actor-comedian visiting Paris to purchase an important screenplay...and then soon getting involved in counterfeit espionage.
The result? The film seems to plod along until about two-thirds through, when broader comedy elements are introduced. Hope's co-star Fernandel--the French comedian--is more of an ""accomplice"" for Hope than an actual teaming, since the story clearly revolves around Hope's character. Fernandel offers a pleasing contrast to Hope's comedic style with slightly daffy charm. Although the lovely Anita Ekberg gets second billing, her spy character seems more of a ""go-between"" as she's only getting close to Hope to get what she wants. It's actually the diplomat (Martha Hyer) whom Hope has eyes for--and Hyer has more screen time than Ekberg as the character caught up in Hope's entanglements. The script is peppered with some terrific Hope jokes, and some moments that are funny throwbacks to earlier Hope comedies: Hope narrowly missing being killed in an elevator; Hope, Fernandel & Hyer posing as dummies in a ""tunnel of love"" boat ride; Hope wrongly put in a sanitarium (remember ""My Favorite Brunette""?), and trying desperately to extradite himself; Fernandel tearing apart his own car to prove to a sanitarium guard he is ""wacky""; and a climactic wild helicopter ride that's a real hoot.
Again, Brentwood failed to restore the original print, and although there's plenty of color, the film looks dark in places.
Certainly not Hope's best comedy, but there are flashes of the old Hope formula which make it quite enjoyable.",1246579200,2,1785,5.355871886120997
1378265,1,B00004YS76,"I love Bob Hope movies, but this has to be the worst I ever saw. Maybe Bob was just getting old and slowing down by 1958. This movie has a very slow, confusing, disjointed plot, dreary locations, the action drags, the lighting, camera work, and microphone placement all seemed second-rate, and the only funny thing happens at the very last when Bob Hope dangles for a while from a rope ladder attached to a Korean War-era helicopter, which provides some sight gags. The actors all seemed distracted throughout, and I got bored watching them. I kept wishing it would end. In fact, I got so depressed by it all I was about to abandon it until the helicopter took off. If I were the director of this movie, I would have demanded some energy and focus from these actors. Editing has a lot to do with the finished product, of course, and in my opinion about a third of this movie should have ended up on the cutting room floor, to at least speed things up. No joy for me in this movie. If you get this movie, go straight to the helicopter scene at the end--the rest of it is not worth sitting through.",1211155200,,1096,4.351219512195122
1378266,3,B00004YS76,"Overall, I thought ""Paris Holiday"" was a very funny movie. It was the first film I'd seen with Bob Hope, and i was very pleased. I could not stop laughing during that ridiculously cheesy helicopter scene!
However, one of the main reasons I got the movie was because I thought Anita Ekberg, of whom I am a big fan, was a main character. She was one of the stars to get top billing, so naturally, I thought she would be in the film quite a bit. This was not the case. Her character is important to the story line, but she is not shown much, which was a little disappointing.
Overall, the movie was very good, VERY funny, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone looking for an Anita Ekberg movie.",1064793600,15,692,4.290076335877862

This is a typical Bob Hope comedy with many corny one-liners and a few lines that are genuinely funny. Add two beautiful girls and another comedian to play off of, and youve got a moviea weak one, though. Sub par entertainment here.",1485820800,,338,4.467741935483871
