7472996,5,B016I00M08,"Sure, it's about the fight, in the ring and outside the ring. But it's about so much more; it's about family, it's about misery and suffering, and the fight to overcome. This is not a lighthearted movie but it's engaging, and a joy to watch.
I don't like watching people fight but I still enjoyed this movie. The cinematography is really good. The story moves back and forth successfully unfolding the past that forms the context for the present. The performances are excellent.",1514678400,3,478,4.771084337349397
7472997,5,B016I00M08,"Normally I stay away from 'fight' movies, however, this one is extremely well done.  There is a good balance between, events,  the emotions of the characters and the actual fighting.  Akshay as usual shows his amazing talent, other actors play their characters well.  DVD arrived on time and in perfect condition.",1501372800,3,313,5.078431372549019

8736449,4,B016I00M08,"A serious Akshay Kumar film, done very well. Heartbreaking story of family pain and suffering centering around two estranged brothers and their father, set to the backdrop of MMA style fighting. The fight scenes were really good might I add, for those of who love that sort of thing. Would totally watch it again!",1534723200,,313,4.814814814814815
8736450,3,B016I00M08,"After reading so many five star reviews I was not too impressed by Brothers. The story is very predictable, although acting of all actors is reasonably good. Shefali Shetty and Jacqueline Fernandez delivered good performances in spite of minor roles. Too many flashbacks make the movie a little choppy. The music is unremarkable; too many songs (even an unnecessary Kareena Kapoor item number) and not a single one that one remembers after the movie is over. Volume of the video was off. Dialogues were hard too hear and volume had to be turned up but songs were too loud, so it was constant adjusting of volume. So annoying!  The story fails to touch the heart...
Still, it is a watchable movie. Would have been even better if it was 30 minutes shorter.",1532131200,,754,4.712121212121212

8736453,5,B016I00M08,"This Bollywood version of the American movie 2011 ""Warrior"". Although, the synopsis is quite similar to ""Warrior"". I much preferred this Bollywood version. Akshay Kumar's performance as the elder brother is steadily intense, bearing the weight of the family of his shoulders. The father played by Jackie Shroff is brilliantly cast. J Shroff created the tortured soul of a reformed alcoholic father makes one either to root for him or just spit on him in the beginning.  However, it is the younger brother, portrayed by Sidharth Malhotra that makes us cried. His position in the family dynamics was heart-wrenching. This version delivers family love, forgiveness, struggle to overcome all odds to make things right, despite the cards that have been dealt. The fight scenes are brilliantly well choreographed. All the fight contestants who participated are worth the watch. Of course, the grand finale where both brothers faced each other - is a MUST-WATCH.",1524873600,2,955,5.241830065359477
8736454,5,B016I00M08,"my my my my.... Two Brothers fought their own battles before they fought the most important battle of all: Family... Sometime, we are forced to go to the extreme to realize that mistakes happens but no mistake is too big not to forgive and to love again.. As we saw in this brilliant movie, father paid a price of losing one son, But David still had love within him. He made a difficult choice to forgive his father while fighting his brother, whom he deeply cared for. Murdered of a  Mother was never easy for any child. In the end, Mother brought her family back together again, even though it wasn't easy for her either..",1524355200,,624,4.426086956521739
8736455,5,B016I00M08,"Despite my name, I am a female, and I must say, people from India are the most handsome men and the most stunning women on the planet. I don't usually go for this kind of movie, because of the fighting, and I almost quit watching. I'm glad I didn't. This movie was so emotional, I was in tears at the end. The only confusing part for me was a Bollywood scene, and I have no clue where that came from, and it seemed out of place for this movie. I even enjoyed the fighting. Twice, I paused the movie just to see how they did some incredible moves.",1523059200,,546,4.064814814814815
8736456,5,B016I00M08,Excellent movie and a great story. I was pleasantly surprised at the emotional depth of this film.,1520121600,,98,4.823529411764706
