8205180,5,6305762333,"If you enjoy rockin' blues played with authority, this band is for you! I can't say enough how much I love this guitarist, Mato Nanji. He's a Stratomaster!  This is one of only two live recordings of his band.  This one was recorded in September, 1999.  The band is Indigenous, and his band mates at the time were his brother Pte (bass), sister Wanbdi (drums), and cousin Horse (congas and percussion).  This tape is about 60 minutes of this blues master and his band playing a powerful tight set of originals and covers of Voodoo Chile/3rd Stone.  The audio and video are excellent!  The video is clearly focused on Mato Nanji with great video of his guitar mastery.  This man was born to play guitar!  It's a wonderful piece of history of an incredible blues band, three siblings and their cousin from South Dakota.  They were taught by their father, a musician in the 1960's. When you listen to Mato play, you will clearly hear the influences of Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Carlos Santana --  but Mato has an unmistakable style all his own.  I never thought there would be another guitarist that I enjoyed as much as Page, Gibbons, Hendrix, Trower, or SRV - until I heard Mato Nanji -- he's really something special!  Get this tape (not available on DVD), and get your VCR out of moth balls --  and enjoy an hour of incredible and powerful rockin' blues by my favorite guitarist of the last 3 decades -- and his original band ""Indigenous!""  (I have included more information on cds by Indigenous in a review of their disc entitled ""Live Blues From the Sky."" )  I hope you enjoy his music as much as I do!",1393286400,,1612,4.510344827586207
8205181,5,6305762333,"This is an excellent document of a 1999 concert by the Native American blues-rock group Indigenous.  The overall band performance is tight, but the main focus is definitely on the fiery guitar work of Mato Nanji.  More than a few of these songs are long jams where he invokes the spirits of Hendrix and SRV (yes Voodoo Chile (Slight Return) is on this tape) all without losing his own sense of style.  Chris Duarte (another great guitarist worthy of more recognition) even joins in on the final song for a blazing guitar duel.  Highly recommended, hope it will be on DVD soon!",1017187200,4,576,4.617647058823529
