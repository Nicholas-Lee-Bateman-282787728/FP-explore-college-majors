2290219,5,B0009GX1E2,"Great insight in to what it takes to win an NBA title, lead by a humble and unselfish superstar and a bunch of role players that compliment each other very well in pursuit of a common goal. I came away with a different perception and opinion of Coach Popovich and i really enjoyed this video on the suprs run to the NBA title.",1168300800,2,326,4.190476190476191

2290221,4,B0009GX1E2,"Im a Spurs enthusiast, but more than that I'm a Ginobili fan. So I've really enjoyed this purchace. It's got a great recap of the spurs season, and a buch of other cool stuff, my favorite being the Manu segment. I don't give it 5 stars because the Gino part was too short for my taste, but more than that because it has no audio or subtitle options. And the Ice-man part is kind of lame. Like another reviewer siad: it's just him driving around, no footage of his basketball exploits.",1143417600,2,484,4.329670329670329

2290223,4,B0009GX1E2,"That's what they usally call the third time, and this one was filled with mass excietment.

Main Program:

Season:This does a pretty decent job of overviewing the season explaining the main core chemestry of the spurs with their winning formula, and it explains their record of 59-23 which would have possibly been better without the injury of Duncan.  Decent overview.

Playoffs:In the first round it shows how the Spurs blew game one to the nuggets, and blew away the nuggets in game 2, but it didn't do a good job of showing how far games 3 and 4 really went; only saying the Spurs easily won, which is inacurate(Such as the tough fight in game 3, plus the flagrant foul on Ginobili by Carmelo Anthony, and the fact that game 4 went into overtime).  Well it d do a good job on game 5 tho.

In the semifinals they failed to explain that Vladimier Radmonavitch went down with an ankle injury in game one, and the rest of the series, and Ray Allel went down for a bit, but came back.  But it do do a nice job of overall explaining the series outcome.

The confrance finals was the most dissapointing coverage on the DVD.  They did not show Brent Barry hitting the key 2 threes in game 1(Except for in the Bruce Bowen's playoff coverage, but it should be in the overall program, because if it was only VHS a lot of people would be pissed), and it didn't show the seperation between games 2, 3, 4, and 5, it was all said in a mumble jumble that the Spurs beat Phoenix at their own game, and eventually closed out the series.  There was no Steve Nash attempting a game tying 3 in game 2, and no mention of game 3, and no seesaw battle and the Stotomire block in game 4, and nothing much of game 5.  They left so much footage and information out.

Finals:As always the finals has been the most worked on feature in all NBA videos it goes through everything with a fine tooth comb, it explains every games ups and downs that were close or blowouts.  So I don't need to explain much on the footage on the exciting exilirating 7 game series between the past 2 NBA champions and a team that were near equals, because they did a real good job on this.

Bonus Features:

Tony Parker-Ankle Breaker:This is a pretty nice feature on how quick Tony is, and you get to see some clips where his moves shook other players, and sometimes make them stumble.

Tim Duncan goes home:A decent mini-documentry on the 3 time Finals MVP.  It goes through Tim's original childhood in the virgin islands and it shows his upcoming as a future basketball star.

Manu Ginobili-Rising Star:It is a nice feature showing the fearless offense, and the quick hands and intense defence of the argantinian superstar who's definitly made his name know throughout the leauge.

Finals Promo:Love is like a thousand burining arrows to the heart.  No it's like the stars in the night sky.  Manu?  Tony?  Ah, it feels good to see the good ol' trophy love with legend Dr J, and the 2 callers Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker.

Bruce Bowen 2005 playoff experience:Very very similar to Malik Rose's 2003 playoff coverage, but Makil Rose's was more funnier, and was pretty much more exciting to watch.  Man I wish they didn't trade him because he was one funny dude on the Spurs.

Greg Popavich pointers:I'm 5'11 and weigh 230 lbs.  Yea pretty big.  So I don't dribble unless I spinmove or have a short ways to the hole.  I'm usally a jumpshooter.  So this really doesn't help me out, but even my friend says this was a filler that was a waste of time, and that it's only for those who really play on basjketball teams, and I agree.

Gerge Gervin-The iceman:This has no past footage of the iceman, only him driving through San Antonio before Game 1 of the finals talking about much of nothing.  Another waste of time.

Clinching 4th quarter:Just like everyone else, I was pissed off about this.  Only 1, count it, not 4 like the 2003 video, but only ONE!  I mean come on, what about the overtime win over Denver, the heartracer in game 6 against Seattle, or, the one I really hoped was on this DVD, the continuation of the Big shot Rob legacy in game 5.  This was utterly dissapointing; knowing that since they did better that this 2 years ago, there is no excuse for making it even better than the one 2 years ago.  It certainly would have been reasonable to put more 4th quarters in that Greg Popavitch pointers, and Gerge Gervin-the Iceman wastes of time.  But at least this one has a 4th quarter unlike the Piston's DVD last year; ironicly the same team that is in this 4th quarter that fell victim to the Spurs.  The only plus to this clinching 4th quarter was that it had the trophy ceremony.

2005 NBA playoff recap:If you wanted to see a nice amount of footage on this DVD, such as the Suns with the clinching win over Dallas, and the game wining shot by the wizards, this DVD doesn't leave those who enjoyed the entire playoffs empty handed.  I for 1 am pretty happy to see this footage to relive a little bit of experience again.

NBA Pre series aynalisis:All boring predictions before the series a waste of time.

NBA post series aynalisis:All boring say ins after the series.  I wish they would have had some players talking on the microphone stands, like they did in 2003's Post series aynalisis.

Will Smith music video tribute-Switch:Shows clips over the entire Spurs season, and clips of Will Smith's live performance of Switch in Game 1 of the finals.  And this song is a excellent choice seeing as how Will Smith did support San Antonio in game 1 during his performance.  And the song in the backround is pretty nice.

A decent program along with a boatload of features.  Altho I really wished there were more 4th quarters, I found this DVD pretty nice altho a little rushed and a bit dissapointing.  But at least it was nowhere near as bad as the Detroit Pistons DVD which was severley lacking any life.  This is a nice DVD that should be checked out by Spurs fans, but if the Spurs do win another championship, and it's DVD ends up worse than this, I'm gonna slap Warner Bros right in the teeth.

Congrads to the NBA champs of 2005:San Antonio Spurs.

2290224,4,B0009GX1E2,"I personally recommend this DVD to any Spur's fan. It is a good DVD.  It does not have all the 4th quarters for the clinching of each series, but it has the 4th quarter of the final game 7.

The special features are great, and the docummentary is good; more than an hour.

Hope this helps.  Take care.  GO SPURS GO!",1125100800,2,315,4.098360655737705
2290225,1,B0009GX1E2,"GO SPURS Go, but this dvd's lacks substance. Unlike the 2003 DVD this flimsy retrospective dvd only has one clinching 4th quarter. A fan spends $25 dollars, one would hope for the same quailty product one got the last time. Maybe even give the fans a little more like the overtime win against the Nuggets, the last second winner against the Sonics and of course game 5 of the finals. But instead they put together a very poorly produced NBA films collection, and even going so far as to use the same intro theme song as they did in 2003 dvd - though the Iceman did do a good voice over. Maybe the NBA producers don't realize why fans buy the dvd, they buy it to re-live the excitement over and over again, you can't do that with one quarter of play and frankly botched editing. I was originally going to rate this 3 stars because I luv my Spurs, but I can't consciously give it that much credit, stay away from this product unless your a die hard Spurs fan like myself.",1122163200,9,969,4.300546448087432
2290226,3,B0009GX1E2,"I'm a huge San Antonio Spurs fan, and I'm still ecstatic over their third championship.  Like many Spurs fans, I could not wait till the 19th of July to get my hands on this DVD.  After purchasing the DVD and viewing it, I was not too impressed.  They should have included all clinching 4th quarters from each series (as they did in the 2003 championship DVD).  Also the ""Bonus"" features are not that great.  The overall review of the season and playoffs is decent, but overall this DVD is lacking.

I was truly hoping they would've included more footage from the PHX series.  It was an exciting series to watch.  Also, they should have also included at least Game 5 of the finals.  The only highlights from that game are Horry's dunk and his game clinching 3.  No references to how Timmy took over the game, and how Robert took over the 4th and overtime.

Overall, I would rate this as an average DVD.  Something put together quickly, without much attention to details, that many Spurs fans like me, would want to see in the DVD.",1121990400,7,1030,4.478494623655914
2290227,4,B0009GX1E2,"To get things started, Amazon does not have the bonus features listed, so I'm sure it will be helpful for buyers to be informed. So here they are:

Tony Parker: Ankle Breaker

Tim Duncan: Goes Home

Manu: Rising Star

Tony and Manu trophy ad

Bruce Bowen's Playoffs

Pointers: Gregg Poppovich

George Gervin: Iceman

2005 Playoff Recap

Pre and Post finals Analysis

Will Smith video

It also has the entire 4th quarter of Game 7. I am disappointed in this because they could've included the clinching 4th quarters from all of the series just like in 2003. I dunno why they took that out. Why not include the ending of Game 5 at least?

Overall this is an ok DVD. it is about 200 min long. Better than the Pistons DVD last year, that one is definitely lacking, but not quite as comprehensive as the 2003 Spurs DVD.",1121731200,30,814,4.462585034013605
