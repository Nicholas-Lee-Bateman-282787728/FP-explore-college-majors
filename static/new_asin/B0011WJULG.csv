8242862,5,B0011WJULG,"EXCELLENT DVD!!!  This DVD tells the story of both Anne Frank and the Holocaust from a fact-based viewpoint.  It is NOT a ""drama-based"" DVD.  I would highly recommend it for instructional purposes.  It is also very enjoyable to simply ""watch"" and consider the life of this young girl, the tribulations that she went through, and the (true) story of the Holocaust.",1446336000,,363,4.901639344262295
