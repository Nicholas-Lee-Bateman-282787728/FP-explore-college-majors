8129273,5,B000G73URW,"My goodness I flipped out when I saw how good of condition.
I mean, I spazzed out a bit in front of my family.
Mainly because of how fast it shipped, it took only two days! O_O
Maybe I live closer to where it's shipped or something, but woah, I'm amazed.
The case is in great shape, like new.
No scratches on the disk.

I bought this as a replacement for a disk that an old friend lost when I let her borrow my My-Hime series collection.",1388188800,,437,4.022988505747127
8129274,5,B000G73URW,"My-Hime is one of those animes that you come across usually by accident. When that happened to me I thought, ""where the heck have they been hiding this one all these years?"" It's great. The animation is pretty good and the voice acting isn't too bad either. What gives this series 5 stars is the story. It has very good characters and character development. You get attached to them very quickly and feel for them when the tragedies strike. Believe me there is a lot of tragedy in this story. It's technically a mecha anime I guess, but it's not conventional. The mecha aren't giant humanoid robots, nor are they the focus of the story the mecha are actually summoned by the Hime (princesses) to fight the demons that are after the ones they love. The demons are only a precursor to a giant plot that is very sinister and dark. While only one Hime can survive you won't want to let go of any of them. They are mostly just average girls with people they want to protect.

This anime is great. It has a good mixture of emotion and action. You should definitely check it out.",1354752000,2,1072,4.414141414141414
8129275,5,B000G73URW,"a wonderous opera that will help you understand love even if you thought you already did. I recommend everyone that has a passion for anime to see this and also those that don't too, and if someone would make a live action movie to this story it would be something great (no changing the story-line for ratings, etc.)",1336780800,,317,4.482758620689655
8129276,5,B000G73URW,"Alyssa Searrs, no relation to Roebuck, has left the Academy but she hasn't forgotten the Hime she left behind as she destroys the bridge connecting the island to the mainland and proceeds to cut off all communications. Her next step is to call in the heavily armed and trained private army of the Searrs Foundation with the intention to round up or kill all the Hime. Midori, the wanna be champion of justice, wants all of the Hime to join together and become a de facto superhero team in this moment of crisis that just happens to interrupt the school festival and an intimate kiss between Mai and Reito. Well, to be more accurate, the kiss is interrupted by a screaming Tate, who hasn't yet come to understand his own feelings for Mai.

Normally in a work with a lot of characters some of the cast gets lost in the shuffle and are shunted to the side in the interest of the plot. Not so with My-Hime. While there are a lot of people starring, their conflicts and desires are presented in such a way as to add richness to the overall work instead of watering down the anime with too many stories. My-Hime can present mech battles, conspiracies, comedy, and romance without blinking an eye or losing any gas. The weird thing about this volume is that the first story arc ends, which almost feels like the end of the series, but we soon learn that an even bigger battle is coming. I kinda liked the wrapping up so you don't have to wait 26 episodes for a full resolution. Awesome show.",1161648000,2,1484,4.435897435897436
