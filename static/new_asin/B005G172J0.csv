4687120,5,B005G172J0,"When I watched Madagascar a few years back, I was less than impressed.  As a result, I never have bothered to watch the sequels.  I may have to reconsider that after having seen the delightful Merry Madagascar.

The made for TV Christmas special finds the gang of zoo animals trying to escape Madagascar and get back to their zoo home before Christmas.  They all have dreams of what they will enjoy most.  However, their escape balloon is shot down by King Julius (Danny Jacobs) and his followers.

What they learn is that every year on December 24th, someone flies through the sky shooting rocks at Julius.  When Alex (Ben Stiller) the lion steps up and shoots down this villain, they make a shocking discovery  its Santa.  Worse yet, he has amnesia.  Suddenly, it is up to Alex and the gang to save Christmas.  Can they do it?

This show was pretty funny from start to finish.  There are plenty of jokes for kids and adults to enjoy, and I was laughing the entire way through.  Yes, there are some lessons to be learned, but they felt like a real part of the story.

One problem with the original holds true here.  I just cant quite buy David Schwimmer.  Every time that Melvin the Giraffe speaks, I just hear Ross from Friends, and it takes me out of the film.  Even though the rest of the cast is well known, I don't have that issue with them.  Weve got the likes of Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Cedric the Entertainer in this special, and they all do a great job.  And its not that David is bad, but I cant picture Ross as an animated giraffe.

The animation is good here.  It might not have any blow you away moments, but there are still some nice shots over the course of the special, and it never gets in the way of the story.

So whether you like the original or not, sit your family down and enjoy Merry Madagascar.  Youll be very merry if you do.

This special is also part of the Dreamworks Holiday Collection, which I received free in exchange for an honest review.",1434067200,,1985,4.35792349726776

4687129,5,B005G172J0,"I bought this at Target. I haven't seen this movie before until I brought it home. It was so good. It was on TV when I was 14 (a year after my phobia of the lion's roar in the style of what you hear in the Movies, TV, video games, & audiobooks was gone). When the 8 main protagonists went to deliver the presents, I pointed out how they reacted when they flew past Moscow and London. One I said: They could've gotten hypothermia. And the other I said: They could've died. I've grown to love the Madagascar franchise. It was funny in the end that the 4 main protagonists (Alex, Marty, Melman, & Gloria) stood underneath the dandruff snow and when Alex got hit by a coconut and ended up having amnesia. When Alex was up and asked ""Who's Alex?"" I said: You are, silly. I've never heard of Julienuary. Geez, a lot of christmas movies had to deal with having to save christmas. I mean it's not like it's going to be taken away. Christmas has always been celebrated since the birth of Jesus Christ. I loved it so much that I wanted to add it to my other children's movies in French & Italian. Luckily, the french was on this dvd. Otherwise it would be difficult. When Alex was coming up with a plan to go back to New York while delivering presents, I said (as if I was to reply back): You said that leaving the zoo was the best thing that's ever happened to you. I rate this movie a 5 out of 5 stars.",1415577600,,1394,4.166666666666667

4687138,4,B005G172J0,"MADAGASCAR was an entertaining animated film that was kind of like friends for kids. Before the movie spawned two sequels and an animated series featuring those quick-thinking penguins, there was this Christmas special, MERRY MADAGASCAR. Set after the events of MADAGASCAR but before the events of MADAGASCAR 2.

On Madagascar, its Christmas Eve and Alex, Marty, Gloria, and Melman have made a hot air balloon and are almost off the island when they are shot down by King Julian and his Lemur subjects. Julian mistook the four friends and their balloon for the red night goblin; a mysterious being who appears every year on the 24th of Julianuary and showers the island full of coal. Shortly after, the red night goblin does appear and thanks to the prowess and aim of Alex, hes shot out of the sky. As it turns out this goblin is really a giant elf named Santa. When he awakens he has amnesia and abandons his sleigh and reindeer. The reindeer are Russian and hate the penguins (who are from the South Pole). So, its left up to Alex and the gang to deliver all the presents left in the sleigh and save Christmas.

Ive seen a lot of modern animated Christmas specials and I have to say that although not original, MERRY MADAGASCAR is one of the better modern animated Christmas specials I have seen. It not only fits in with the style of the original MADAGASCAR movie, but it also feels like a usual tv Christmas special.",1387497600,,1421,4.612648221343873

I love that nearly all the original voice cast returns.  Danny Jacobs does a great job filling in for Sacha Baron in the role of King Julien.  The story is run-of-the-mill Christmas caper, i.e. Christmas is in danger of not happening and our heroes must make it happen.  However it keeps all the humor that this movie series usually delivers intact.
Bottom line is that the special is entertaining as all get out with several laugh-out-loud scenes.  There are no scenes that might not be appropriate for small children.",1357257600,,622,4.669724770642202

The Madagascar gang is all here and just in time for Julianuary! A time for celebration and gifts for Julian. Not many individuals can wear arrogance with such comedic flair like he does, but somehow he manages to do so and in an endearing manner.

4687153,5,B005G172J0,"You know something? Whenever I watch the Penguins of Madagascar on Nickelodeon, there's this weird feeling I happen to have. It's not that the show was bad. Heck, it's better than what's on Cartoon Network today, but it's just strange to see a Madagascar series run for so long without the movie series' cast: Alex the lion, Marty the zebra, Gloria the hippo, and Melman the giraffe. Fortunately, this is a return to form.

Like anything you expect from Dreamworks, the comedy is as funny as the average movie they make, and the characters are memorable. Plus, the storyline is ridiculous. King Julian (lemur) fears a mysterious being that is attacking them with candy canes. Of course, it was Santa Claus. But he doesn't remember anything, since Alex threw a ground stake at him, not knowing who he was. Because of this, the cast we know and love has to deliver the presents.

Their journey is just plain crazy, with silly situations, such as wondering how to get into the house unsuspected. Meanwhile, King Julian tries to show Santa how he celebrates Christmas (aka calls it Julianuary and has people bring him gifts). It's really fun watching what the characters do and what they say, as in any well-made CGI comedy. Although not a full movie, Merry Madagascar fits right in with the original series.",1332806400,,1304,4.791111111111111

The fued between the reindeer and the penguins is a fun twist too. The NY Zoo gang have their little adventure trying to figure out how Santa does this every year.  It's a short movie your kids will watch over and over, even the adults will enjoy, especially watching your kids laugh at it.  My 6 year old son said to write that this movie is ""super cool"".  My 4 year old daughter said that ""it's pretty funny they have Santa's sleigh"".

4687162,3,B005G172J0,"This could have been much, much better. I enjoyed this but it
just felt a little rushed - like there was a tad too much story
to cram into 30 minutes.

This would have been a lot better if it had been expanded
another 10 or 12 minutes. Usually I think a movie would be better
if it was a few minutes shorter.

Either that or cut some of the story.

'Shrek the Halls' was a little short and would have benefitted
from a few more minutes as well.

I really was hoping I would like this a lot as I loved the first
Madagascar movie. The 2nd one was a whole step down from the
first but that's very common for a sequel.

Sadly it's just not in the same class as 'A Charley Brown Christmas'
or the 'The Grinch'. It could have been but just wasn't.

But we will watch it again.

After that, things pick up as Santa Claus enters the picture.

From there the story is told in split, with half of it following the main characters on their quest to deliver gifts and the other half stuck back on the island with the jolly old fat man, who now has amnesia. The half that follows the gift-givers is, by far, the better of the two and that portion of the production makes it viewable. Without that this would earn two stars, maybe less, because Danny Jacobs, doing his best Robin Williams impersonation as the meerkat king, is not funny.

Actually King Julien crashes the balloon as he thought they were the ""Great Red Night Goblin"".  After that, Santa and his sleigh fly through and crash on the island.  Santa hits his head hard and a big bump appears.  He asks where he is and who he is.  Santa has amnesia!  There are presents to deliver.

Alex, Marty, Melman, Gloria and the wacky Penguins take the responsibility to deliver the presents and give Christmas to the world.  They also think that Santa's sleigh may return them to New York City after the deliveries are done.
