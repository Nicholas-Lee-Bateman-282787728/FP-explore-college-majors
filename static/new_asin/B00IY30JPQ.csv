6305164,4,B00IY30JPQ,"It was ok. A little low budget. And a little too much at times but over all it was ok lol. I expected just a little more but eh.... i guess low level indie production companies cant do but so much so whatever. The plot was extremely good just wished there was a lil more to the story felt like they shouldve added a little more of something.... something was just missing , couldn't quite put my finger on it but,... eh... If your bored and cant find nothing else to watch this is alright now bad. lol",1407628800,2,501,4.122448979591836

6305166,5,B00IY30JPQ,"My sister saw ""Four of Hearts"" at a festival screening in Chicago last year and couldn't stop raving about it. As a fan of some of the actors, I decided to give it a try...and it was truly entertaining. A very interesting spin on marriage and ""experimentation"" in relationships. See it with someone(s) you love!",1403913600,,311,4.672727272727273
6305167,5,B00IY30JPQ,"I thought that premise of the movie was interesting so I decided to give it a try.  I really enjoyed this movie very much.  I movie kept my interest by making me interested in the character and what would be the finally outcome of their ""experiment.""  The movie will definitely have couples talking to each other about what they really do and don't want to happen in their relationship.  Finally, the movie left a lasting impression on me as it relates to ""being careful of what you ask for....you just may get it.""  I would more certainly recommend to others.",1403827200,2,560,4.56
6305168,5,B00IY30JPQ,"While at the Pan African Film Festival this year, this was one of films I missed. I decided to rent it and was kinda expecting the typical format of new filmmaker's prattle, but hoping for the best, especially in this genre. And I was really surprised!! Storyline was strong and  the cast of actors were really good. Though not sure how many Black men would stand for those shenanigans.",1403740800,,386,4.594202898550725
