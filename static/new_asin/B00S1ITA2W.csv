6938533,5,B00S1ITA2W,"I'm a big fan of Kingsman director Matthew Vaughn, though I'm aware his work is deconstructive to some and disposable to others. (Kick-Ass is the prime example of his divisiveness.) I went in expecting something fun but probably a bit more disposable, but I was very wrong. I left in love with this movie and even felt there was some legitimate heart.

Kingsman: The Secret Service is an incredible balance of two great types of british movies. First, the Gentleman spy genre, most notably done in 007 films. The other half is the Guy Ritchie genre of witty gangsters. This is embodied in the two leads, Taron Egerton as Eggsy, a smart street thug in London who is recruited by Harry Hart, what you might imagine James Bond would be fifteen years after his prime-played perfectly by Colin Firth.

The story is of the Kingsman spy agency, and how Harry Hart recruits Eggsy for a once in a lifetime chance to become a gentleman spy. We are along for Eggsy's trials to become the next Kingsman which is called ""the most dangerous job interview ever"", and his mentorship under Hart is surprisingly more heartfelt than I expected, but not in a cheap way. While Eggsy is being recruited however, Hart is working to discover a plot that might threaten the entire world run by Samuel L. Jackson. I won't reveal the plot but suffice to say it's of the typical 007. The domination is nothing new, but Jackson and the film have fun making fun of the world domination schemes. And while his plot is over the top-elements of it aren't unrealistic.

As you can surmise, Eggsy is the Guy Richie half and Hart is the 007 half. Eggsy is younger, a bit cocky, with a chip on his shoulder having grown up in a poor part of London. His motivations may be a bit on the nose at times, but Egerton does very well despite it. Eggsy is a deftly handled character, being bitter and cocky but still immensely likeable, more than I expected. Firth on the other hand is the Stiff Upper Lip Brit and it's a lot of fun. His relationship with Eggsy is believable and lots of fun watching him push and support Eggsy while also keeping the upper hand.

Firth also gets the focus of the world destruction plot, and it's fun watching him be a gentleman spy. While his spy favors gadgets and brawn over guns, when push comes to shove Firth delivers and you have no trouble believing he can kick ass.

Everything else about Kingsman is great, but Egerton and Firth anchor it with believable characters you root for. Samuel L Jackson is fun as the villain, and his henchwoman Gazelle gives most Bond henchmen a run for their money with her blades for legs.

The action is also brilliant and the story is never slow. The violence is gleefully over the top, but scenes come at the right time, not just scene after scene of gore just because. The story is also well paced. I didn't find myself wishing for the next scene, but rather comfortably enjoying all the time I had in the moment. And I honestly want so much more, I'd love more time with all of these characters, which is the best compliment I can give.

Kingsman is a great spy film that takes apart and pokes fun at the genre but also gives it a shot of adrenaline. And the adrenaline shot is done in a more believable and earnest way than Vin Diesal did in XXX a few years ago (which injected more Mountain Dew and less adrenaline) It is a love letter to the genre, a tongue in cheek analysis, and a wholly new experience all in one. I loved every second and I can't wait to watch it over and over again.",1424217600,3,3523,4.427469135802469
6938534,5,B00S1ITA2W,"This is probably the BEST spy movie I've ever seen. It's basically a violent James Bond movie, without James Bond. Matthew Vaughn who directed X-Men First Class and Kick Ass directs sleek, stylish, violent, action - packed movie based off a comic (with the same name). The movie stars Samuel L. Jackson, Colin Firth, and Michael Caine. But the main star of the movie is both Colin Firth and new actor Taron Edgerton. Edgerton delivers an amazing performance, that makes you care about his character. Honestly you care about all the characters in this movie. And Sam Jackson's villain is just perfect, likable, and funny. Be warned this rated R for a reason, and there's a very violent part in the movie set in a church. So if you seen it theater or later on video, this church scene will make or break the movie for you.

But overall this is the best movie I've seen in 2015, the action in this movie makes Taken 3 look like complete and utter garbage. Matter of fact if you love good action movies, you'll love this movie",1424131200,2,1022,4.524324324324325
6938535,4,B00S1ITA2W,"From the director of Kickass and X-Men: First Class is Matthew Vaughns next action-packed feature starring Colin Firth, Taron Egerton, Mark Strong, and Samuel L. Jackson. An environmental terrorist is planning to reduce the human population with pure violence since mankind is unwilling to take global warming to light. The Kingsman, headed by Harry Hart (Galahad) is assembled to stop Valentine from turning mankind onto each other. A young boy is sought out by Galahad to take place within the Kingsman with hope he can become more then he ever had hoped to be.

The trailer wasn't impressive after several months of promotions that it came off as a generic retread of what weve already seen before. And the bad guy in Samuel L. Jackson came off as a bit odd. However, after viewing Kingsman: The Secret Service I was impressed by how entertaining the film was. Matthew Vaughn is a talented director and can put forward a great action film as weve seen in the past. And hes able to make likable characters who you can root for and want to follow through the duration of the film. This should mean we should have faith in the director and not assume the worst cause trailers aren't always the best feature.

We follow Taron Egerton who is a rising star in Hollywood and whos name is being thrown around for other major projects. He was really good in the movie because you watch his character, Eggsy (Gary Unwin), get picked up by Galahad (Colin Firth) whos then trained and put through a series of tests with other Kingsman hopefuls. Egerton was great and has the maturity to really be big in the coming future. This was a great role for him because it brought out his best in action and for what we could see down the stretch. There were many moments that stood out but one in particular comes towards the very end of the movie when he is needed to free one of the trapped politicians wife who was locked up by hands of Valentine. Aside from the movie ending by this point it turned out to be a happy ending if you know what I mean.

Other great actors filled the screen with Michael Caine playing a small role and Mark Strong playing the head trainer, Merlin, who tested the teens physically and mentally in life or death situations. But we then come to Colin Firth who shared the lead roles with Egerton and plays a sophisticated hitman. Firth did a great job and was entertaining to watch; especially a scene where he and Eggsy are sitting in a pub and a group of troubled youths walk in and threaten Eggsy with Galahads presence. Its shown in the trailer but is more effective during the film. Finally we come to Samuel L. Jackson as Valentine who was too funny to take serious. His character had a lisp that made him look foolish and silly but worked with what he was trying to achieve. And Valentine cant stand the sight of violence yet hes threatening it across the world.

The movie had an R rating and really undermines how violent the film was. This didn't deter me at all but rather it surprised me at just how violent it was. But after watching Kickass you shouldnt be too surprised with Vaughn at the helm. There were heads exploding, bodies splitting in half, spikes going through heads, axe hacks, and more if you can believe it. It was so much to take in that you were entertained by the action and wouldnt seem like a film that would showcase that amount of violence. Another mention has to go to the soundtrack because it sounded great with the action and made things fun.

You could sense a little bit of a comic book feel to the movie because of how Vaughn shot X-Men: Days Of Future Past from a technical standpoint. As a whole, your just entertained by the story, action, and great performances by Taron Egerton and Colin Firth. Theres plenty of action to keep you hooked all the way up to the conclusion. It may take someone by surprise as it did with me and could see a sequel should 20th Century Fox go through with it depending on the box-office results.",1424131200,2,3983,4.495856353591161
6938536,4,B00S1ITA2W,"Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.
Matthew Vaughn has a small resume of directed films, but it's a good one (Layer Cake, Stardust, Kick-Ass and X-Men: First Class).  He brings elements of all plus a healthy injection of James Bond and ""Kill Bill"" to this fun action-based film.  The biggest influence would seem to be the James Bond films, especially given the title.  But these secret spies don't work for the British government, or any government for that matter.  They are independent do-gooders, headquartered in London and organized based on King Arthur and his knights.  In fact, each spy is given a code name based on the knights.  You know, Galahad (Colin Firth), Lancelot (Jack Davenport), and Arthur (Michael Caine).  Not to mention the trainer, Merlin (Mark Strong).

When one of the knights is killed on a mission, an opening occurs and each of the remaining members gets to nominate one candidate.  Harry Hart, aka Galahad, nominates a troubled young man who is the son of one of his compatriots who was killed years earlier and in the process saved Harry's life.  Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin (Taron Egerton) has been raised by his widowed mother (Samantha Womack) who is now living with a bullying jerk.

Once Eggsy agrees to be considered, he and the other candidates are put through a rigorous training regimen where ultimately only one will be chosen.  While all of this is going on, the evil master villain named Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson, working a lisp) is set to fix the planet of its climate change problem by reducing the Earth's population on his own terms.  Using cell phone SIM cards, he will be able to control human emotions.  See, I told you it was just like a Bond flick.

Given the ""R"" rating, this would have been a great opportunity to see what a more violent, profane and explicitly sexual a Bond film might look like.  Unfortunately, the film is a bit of a letdown on that last opportunity, showing just a flash of bare butt, albeit with an element of naughty language.  As far as the violence and the profanity, we're not disappointed, unless that isn't what you came for.  The best scene is when Harry infiltrates a Tennessee church containing extreme elements of fundamentalism.  The leader preaches hate that would give the KKK pause.  As a trial, Valentine is going to try out his new gizmo on this sample.  The result is a bloodbath that is only missing Uma Thurman in a yellow jumpsuit.

The film falls a bit short of excellence only when it shifts into traditional chase mode as hordes of bad guys in white uniforms chase our hero inside Valentine's secret lair.  Everyone's a bad shot except Eggsy.  Aside from some quibbles, this is a fun, witty ""R""-rated romp and provides some great entertainment.",1424044800,2,2746,4.766949152542373
6938537,4,B00S1ITA2W,"Kingsman: The Secret Service
 We might think of Kingsman as the offspring of a James Bond film by Jackie Chan.  The spies, the never more than a dozen agents named after the knights of the round table, all hale from deep in the British aristocracy.  They imbibe Bondish libations, wear suits hand crafted on Seville Row and carry gadgets wonderful as Batman's.  But the action scenes have the kind of frenetic speed and intensity that Jackie Chan made famous.  Whew, what fun.  In the recent The Equalizer Denzel Washington dispatches half a dozen bad guys in about 15 seconds in a remarkable scene of intense mayhem.  In the climatic battle in Kingsmen director Matthew Vaughn involves about a hundred extras fighting like mad people for several minutes.  Vaughn also directed Kick Ass and X-Men: First Class so he knows his fight scenes.  He did the massive fight sequence in a single take which I find amazing all by itself.
 Vaughn and Jane Goldman collaborated on the screenplay as they did on both of the mentioned films and others.  They put in the occasional Bond like bon mot just for fun without overdoing it and turning the action film into a spoof.
 In the setup the Kingsman organization arose from the rubble of WWI when many leading families found themselves heir-less due to the heavy loss of life in the war.  The fortunes became combined-and massively expanded in the ensuing century- with the proceeds funding the private intelligence organization.  Traditionally of course staffed by the stiff lipped British upper crust.  Until young Eggsy, a street lout raised by a single mom and abused by her gangster boy friend, manages to make the very exacting grade to become a Kingsman.
 Two young actors hold what would ordinarily be the male and female leading roles.  Taron Egerton  (great name for an actor)  plays the Cockney speaking young recruit with Sophie Cockson playing another young recruit and his colleague if not his lady love.  Neither of them are well known in the film world.  Both have most of their experience in the realm of British TV.  Both are over shadowed by their famous co-stars.
 James L. Jackson lisps his way through his role as a Bond style super villain.  He is a Steve Jobs style billionaire who wants to save the world by ridding the suffering globe of parasitic humanity-except for himself and his pals, naturally.
 The young heroes serve as a focal point around which a handful of magnificent actors spin.  Colin Firth, most famous for The Kings Speech plays one of the knights and the sponsor of young Eggsy (Egerton).  Elegant and gentlemanly, he can and does mix it up with the best of them.  He tames the streetwise kid and teaches him manners along with more deadly skills.
 In a lesser but still important role we have Michael Caine who at 85 years of age can still act circles around other actors.  Mark Hamill of Star Wars fame also has a supporting role.
 Algerian born beauty Sophia Bontella is spectacular as Gazelle, the assassin and general helper to the rogue billionaire.  A double amputee, she kills using blades attached to the springy prosthetics she wears.
 All in all I enjoyed the three and half saw blade Kingsman very much.  Filmed on an extravagant budget of $81 million it brought in a very solid three day world wide gross of $79 million.  The producers hope to turn Kingsman into a franchise.
 Kingsman runs a good long two hours and nine minutes.  It caries an R rating for violence and sexual references.
  I exited the darken theater with a big smile on my face.",1424044800,2,3543,4.736497545008183

gory, too much blood.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone.",1423872000,5,264,4.24
6938540,5,B00S1ITA2W,"Matthew Vaughn directed the 2010 movie Kick Ass as well as the 2011 movie X-Men First Class. And ever since then, he has been one of my favorite movie directors. The movie trailer for Kingsman was released earlier last year (which it was supposed to release in theaters October of last  year but the movie got delayed to release for February). As a result, my anticipation for this movie continued to build, and finally I had the opportunity to see the movie Kingsman: The Secret Service.

Many years after the death of his father, Eggsy is currently being held at a police station as the result of stealing and crashing a car that belonged to another guy who had threatened to start a fight at a bar Eggsy and his friends were at. Upon Eggsy's request to use his allowed one phone call, he remembers the medal that was given to him by Harry Hart. After Eggsy is released he meets Harry and little does Eggsy know, his whole life is about to change.

Taron Egerton is not an actor I am familiar with, but he is excellent here as Eggsy. He balances his role as teenager with wit and likable courage and is a nice fit in the role. Colin Firth stars as Harry Hart and does a VERY nice job. Whether its trading one liners with Samuel L. Jackson's character Richmond Valentine, or packing a powerful punch, or single-handedly firing a fast but perfectly aimed shot, he provides Kingsman The Secret Service with an all-around entertaining performance. Samuel L. Jackson plays the antagonist Richmond Valentine and does a great job bringing his usual humor; while portraying the character with a lisp tone of voice. Mark Strong also does a great job as Merlin the head of Kingsman training, he's more of a behind the scenes(but still is in control) type character. Sofia Boutella portrays Gazelle and does a fantastic job in her action scenes. Great job here by the cast.

Kingsman: The Secret Service has a action packed story that also boasts a few quick, but sweet moments in the movie. In terms of action, the fight scenes are eye-popping due to the action scenes being wonderfully choreographed. Kingsman: The Secret Service is at times over the top, and does have some profanity, but Kingsman: The Secret Service is such a great movie because it knows that it is a movie and never forgets to be a movie. The acting, the story, the action, and the fun I had with Kingsman: The Secret Service is why I would encourage you to GO SEE Kingsman: The Secret Service because it is

A GREAT Experience

6938541,5,B00S1ITA2W,"This was just great, good fun! At times a satire, comedy, bloody gore fest and homage to gentlemen spy movies. I want to watch the extended version for my personal library but I walked out of the theater happy and ready to share the joy with people who would like this film.

Colin's character Galahad made this film for me. Everyone did a great job but Colin was hands down the MVP.

6938542,5,B00S1ITA2W,"Kingsman: The Secret Service was founded (and funded) by wealthy families after WWI who found themselves with no heirs. They could see the flaws in their government and its intelligence gathering, so they created a powerful, richly funded organization that NO one knows about or even suspects.

This R-rated (language and violence) action/comedy/adventure is directed by Matthew Vaughn (""Layer Cake"" and ""X-Men: First Class""). After a bloody opening, this unpredictable romp starts with a parcour chase through city streets, and demonstrates enough gadgets to impress even Q, of James Bond fame. We see a raw kid recruited for training as a super spy, then we get to watch him learn the ropes while a gleeful villain launches a brilliant plot.

We see:
  * Colin Firth (""The King's Speech"") Harry Hart/Galahad is the recruiter. Our young hero's father had saved Galahad's life at the cost of his own. This dapper character has echoes of Steed from TV's original ""Avengers"" and a tongue-in-cheek Sean Connery from early ""Bond"" movies.
  * Taron Egerton (""Testament of Youth"") is Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin, the recruit I just mentioned. He's a street tough burdened with a mother who has been going downhill ever since his father died.
  * Samuel L. Jackson (""The Avengers"" I DID mention this is R-rated, didn't I?) Evil Valentine has a plan to save the world and he's rich enough to do it! I'll bet his product placements for McDonald's Happy Meal and Google Glass help!
  * Mark Strong (""The Guard"") Merlin can sort out the applicants until there is only one left standing. This is the perfect role for Strong; It's great to see this wonderful actor (finally!) granted the screen time he so richly deserves.
  * Michael Caine (""Interstellar"") Arthur explains to our hero what the villain is doing, and why.
  * Sofia Boutella (""StreetDance 2"") is Gazelle, can you guess what she brings to the table? Not only mad hand-to-hand combat skills, but a razor-sharp blade attached to her leg. Emma Peel should have been so lucky!

This carefully choreographed martial arts violence is gruesome and bloody, but the movie is so cartoony our screening audience laughed, and then applauded when the cigarette lighter/grenade mowed down some of the enemies. It was also fun to watch our hero bond with the puppy he selected; he thought it would grow up to be a bulldog but it was actually a pug!",1423785600,2,2376,4.905

6938590,4,B00S1ITA2W,"Absolutely LOVE it! We rented it then turned around and bought it. And then bought the sequel sight unseen. (We love that one too!)

Know what you're getting into: The language is for adults only, and there's a lot of it. The violence is bloody, but rarely particularly realistic. Lots of CGI. There's also a lot of that.

Adults ONLY, got it?

But oh good grief this one is FUN! Stunts galore with a witty, razor-sharp dialogue.  It's worth watching just to witness Colin Firth kicking a**, and etch the name Taron Egerton onto your brain. Watch this and see a star in the making. This guy is going to be front and center for a long time to come.

The creators wanted to bring back the mystique of heroes while also making it enjoyable in a fun way. Having watched James Bond from the time I was a child I eventually became a great enjoyer of the hero type movies  Superman, Star Wars, Marvel, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, etc. What the DVD did for me was take that movie out of a class that could have ranked  in my mind at least  with those types of movies. Unfortunately the unnecessary language using the *F* word all over and unnecessary gratuitous sexual images at the end of the movie made me wish I didn't buy the DVD.

It could have been an interesting movie, but it was made to push the viewer's senses beyond toleration; beyond what it is reasonable for human minds to witness.  There are real life horrors.  This movie, and any others like it, expose the viewer to perverse fictionalization that our small brains simply do not need.  It is not a matter of freedom of expression being thwarted.  Viewers in favor of this movie who believe that they are better off from having seen it. very wrongfully consider it entertainment.  It isn't.

Human beings do not benefit from being exposed to the very worst of humanity, fictionalized and made visual, with sound - and the sound in the theaters must have been further mind-blowing.  We are not better off to have every single manner of the most debase behaviors in our heads.  We don't.",1526601600,,895,4.685897435897436

Then, without warning or explanation, the main character enters a church and proceeds to slaughter every member without provocation, in graphic detail, slow-motion, huge blood spray, unique killing of each member. It serves no plot development. Has no redeeming cinematic function. Its like watching a school shooting in detail. I watch a lot of graphic, violent movies, so it wasn't that...it was like a betrayal of the audience. It felt creepy and unredeeming. Even my 14 year old son, said, this is just wrong.

Firth is too often cast in a film that does not require him to act, and here he is an animated mannequin with a stunt double used once in a while.

The plot simplicity and the humor were at a preteen level but the bad language and the violence - think comically exaggerated gore, Kill Bill style - were definitely at an adult level. So it's too adult for a young teen but also too simplistic for an adult. And it didn't help that the main actor was dull and uncharismatic.

Overall, the movie was very cliched and unimaginative, not to mention terribly sexist. Definitely not anywhere near as exciting as the previews made it look! It was hard to watch through the end, despite all the high budget special effects and what not.",1518307200,,642,4.582608695652174

My mother and I are not big fans of blood, but I thought this was not over the top at all. It almost seemed like a video game, which makes sense since it is based on a comic book! We all greatly enjoyed it and thought it was a fun and quirky movie. The only thing is that I would have liked  the villain to not have a lisp as they seemed to use it to perpetuate negative stereotypes associated with speech impediments, though I know Samuel L Jackson's intentions were good (there is an article about why he gave his character a stutter).

Maybe I have missed something butt, when does the sight of a shapely rear end mean anal sex, what would have been said if there was full frontal nudity.  I loved the part of Samuel L. Jackson, his character, with its weakness was supported by strong individuals, like in real life.  The church scene was great, anyone that complains about it, obviously has been so busy counting f-bombs that they have not bothered to watch any of the film up to that point.  To all of those complainers out there, when you start disliking a movie, please do yourself a favor and turn it off.

6938922,1,B00S1ITA2W,"I think it's meant to be a fun take-off on the 60s British spy cliche.  HOWEVER, there are some clear issues and scenes that come back to haunt me long after I've seen it.
The villainous henchman (henchwoman, here) is rather repulsive.  I realize henchmen are supposed to have no redeeming qualities, while the villains themselves are the fun characters, but this one in particular is repulsive.  The method in which she kills, esp in the intro scene of her character, is something unforgettable and not in a good way.  It is shocking.
But there is the female lead character, an influential royal personage who is abducted and thereafter she is treated by the screenplay and director as disposable and objectified.  She is demeaned.  Is this a way for the males to get back at her for her status?  It seems so as it plays out.
The scene where she offers herself to her rescuer as his reward is already disheartening but then she is objectified by a video-feed contacts-wearing supposed-hero who is accepting her offer while relaying this feed back to his remote handler.  Needless to say, even the sexual offer she'd laid out as a reward is suspect as it would be a male fantasy.
I'd like to put this movie into a time capsule of this time period of male sexual harassers and the variety in which this plays out in film.  The female characters, esp the empowered ones, are treated pretty badly in this, almost as if in some male revenge sexual fantasy.",1514764800,,1452,4.618677042801556

6938968,3,B00S1ITA2W,"Spoiler alert.

We really enjoyed the over the top storytelling and effects for what they were.  It was a good escape/action movie with a nod to Bond and maybe Kill Bill etc. BUT, and Im still disappointed that I have to reduce a star from this lighthearted movie, it didn't have to include anal humor and barf spewing. The exploding heads of everyone in colorful smoke ala fireworks...? Okay... It was a reasonable treatment of the event so as to not make it gory. I ended up appreciating that, but the afore mentioned low brow additions? What a bummer. Im NO prude, but man it just didn't need to be in there and really detracted from what was otherwise pretty fun.",1513555200,,667,4.5041322314049586

However, excessive use of the F word (people do not talk like this in real life and good movies don't do this), gratutious, graphic, excessive and needless violence (even watching one person mass murder a whole churchful of people), and a woman's rear end as the last scene after her blatant invitation to ""do it from the rear"", was really too much.  The main character had no character or integrity, and the primary character (who had character) was killed.  This was a potentially great movie that was treated badly by the producers.

It blatantly winks at some of the spy icons that border on ridiculous in taking themselves too seriously.

That's not what happened here however. If I had a dollar for every time a character used the f-word (an most characters did, multiple times in one sentence.) I could have made a decent wad of cash. The f-word happens in real life of course, I use it on occasion, but this was forced into the majority of dialogue just to be...to be what? Edgy? Hip? With it? If so, it didn't work.
  As for the story? A James Bond want-to-be with none of the charm or wit. That's this movie in a nutshell.

Instead of the typical one liner and proceeding to kick ass to eventually saving the indivdual. There was clear as day not word for word mind you.

Mostly, I found the action to be unengaging because it was so one-sided.  There was no sense of triumph, just slaughter of incompetent opponents.  There was no arc of overcoming hardship.

6939155,4,B00S1ITA2W,"Just finished watching ""Kingsman - The Secret Service"" released by 20th Century Fox.
Manners Maketh Man.
And tongue-firmly-implanted in cheek, this spy caper movie about a young street punk who gets a chance to fill his late father's shoes in the Bringman - an oh so prim-and-proper British Spy Agency is great fun.
Yes, ""Kingsman"" is a bit over-the-top, and it pays homage to the old fashioned James Bond movies that is probably even today a bit risque, but it's fun, right down to it's wickedly cool assassin and evil villain who wants to save the planet by giving away free cell phones that when activated will cause people to go on killing rampages.  Spoiler Alert - the fight-to-the-death scene in the church is pretty gruesome, but well choreographed.
Not for everyone.
Still great fun!

6939190,1,B00S1ITA2W,"A certain co-worker of mine keeps tormenting me by showing me the ""church scene"" from KINGSMAN on his iPhone. He is 35 years younger than I and he loved it when I introduced him to the classic tune ""Free Bird"" by Lynyrd Skynyrd. He was quick to note that ""Free Bird"" is playing during the church holocaust scene in Kingsman. I decided to give this silly, violent movie a chance and I simply couldn't believe the overt violence and incessant use of the F-Bomb. I'm no prude and maybe even use the word too much in my own dialect, but having the F bomb in the film over 6,587,933 times is overkill. Speaking of overkill; the death rate, especially in the church scene, was so orgiastic that I couldn't even keep a body count. I'm all for so called ""free speech"", but I think the Founding Fathers meant us to have the right to speak out against injustice and government corruption and not the ""freedom"" to interject the F-Bomb 34 times in each sentence.

With the horrendous recent events in Las Vegas and elsewhere, I can't help but think that kids (and some adults) are going to watch this revolting film (in spite of the R rating) and decide that the frenetically violent scene in the church can be adopted as their ""acceptable means of dispute resolution"".

People wonder why our society is so violent. Just watch this movie and you will get your answer.",1508630400,,1355,4.526530612244898

6939210,5,B00S1ITA2W,"I loved this movie!!  I was surprised I liked it as much as I did, but with this stellar case it could hardly lose.  Think of if Quentin Tarentino did a James Bond film, although there were more plot twists here than in a typical Bond film.  Yes, it's an action film, shoot 'em up, blow 'em up, and kick there a-- into next week---or worse!!  But it's FUN, and that is what the director was trying to accomplish.  Accomplish he did, in our view, and we can't wait to see the sequel.  All the main stars---Colin Firth, Michael Caine, Samuel L. Jackson---brilliant, as always.  But relative unknown, newcomers Taron Egerton and Sofia Boutella also made the picture, along with other, strong supporting cast.  The comedic effects throughout are well-placed, and---I won't spoil it for you---a major scene toward the end had me laughing out loud.  It will have you going:  OMG!!

6939214,4,B00S1ITA2W,"This is not a James Bond copy. If you like James Bond and you start to watch this thinking that your getting something similar, you will be disappointed. There are similarities. The nice suits, the gadgets and the evil man set out to control the world. But that is about it.

The Kingsman is a rollicking movie. I really enjoyed it.
This movie focuses on a young man named Eggsywho has been living with his mom and her boyfriend. He has two good friends that tend to lead him into trouble. They do drugs, go joy riding in cars and so on. When enters an older man who makes over Eggsy, teaches Eggsy to put his joy riding experiences to good use and off they go to save the world. During the course of the movie Eggsy grows up, saves the world, meets the girl of his dreams and even manages to save his mom from an abusive boy friend.

I gave it a four star rating because of the swear words. It did not need to drop the F bomb nearly as much as it did. It seems that should be one of the 'gentleman' rules. There was swearing just for swearings sake sadly.

Otherwise, I think this is a fun show.",1508112000,3,1096,4.136150234741784
6939215,3,B00S1ITA2W,"When you associate Britain with spy film, you automatically think about James Bond. Presuming filmakers wanted to combine the elegance of James Bond with a younger cast and without the sex tourism Bond jokes, this is how Kingsman was created to fill that void. In a way the film has some nice merits. Starring a troubled British teenager that was the son of a spy that had an honorable death, he grows up with a chip on his shoulder due to living with an abusive stepfather.

After getting arrested protecting his friends from a pub fight and booked on assault charges, he phones the mysterious Kingsman number that was passed to him after his father's death and is strangely enough released from jail within a handful of minutes.

Colin Firth isn't best known for action roles and he almost seems out of place as a sort of mentorship role in this film. While the training scenes have some high and low points, they can confuse younger viewers thinking some of the applicants were killed during the individual tests. It's as if life was easily discarded as something useless.

While the supporting spy cast are okay, the villains are totally unrealistic. Samuel L. Jackson plays a lot of great villanous roles but he seems silly in this film at best. It's hard to believe he's the big enchilada. The film gets some merit from the mostly fast pace, but the head explosion scenes are so ridiculous that a movie that was striving for a grim theme ends up being hard to take seriously. Might be worthy as a rental, but there are far better action films out there.",1508025600,,1559,4.620938628158845

I was taking my buddy out a week after he buried his mother to get his mind off things so I was somewhat distracted.  I saw ""Golden Circle"" a few weeks ago and absolutely loved it.  That led me to return to its predecessor and it also helped that my wife is a big Colin Firth fan.  What can I say but this flick has it all.  Reminiscent of the best Bond flicks with a contemporary touch.  Intricate plotting, tight direction, slam-bang action sequences and superb performances.  This is the kind of vehicle Firth deserved years ago perfectly exploiting the suave charm and machismo that was obvious to his longtime fans.  Mark Strong can do no wrong perfectly cast as the stolid Merlin.  Samuel L. Jackson cements his reputation as one of our finest thespians elevating the lisping megalomaniac Valentine beyond clich.  Taron Egerton makes an auspicious showing as the streetwise Eggsy.

It is the super spy sort of story, but also an introduction story to Eggy, brilliant and athletic kid who is also a rebel who ends up following in his fathers foot prints. Though saying that, the beginning is a bit slow and like many intro stories takes a few to get going. Though when it does the ride is pretty fun, even the parts that are all training and passing the test parts are fun.
I have watched this one a few times since I got it and originally I purchased the DVD and gave that away to my brother after watching it and purchased the Blue Ray to get the extras since I wanted to know more about it.

6939342,1,B00S1ITA2W,"This negative review has to do with Amazon's streaming quality and not the movie.  The movie was fun and easily a 3 to 4 star movie.  The one star comes from Amazon's Video quality with no way to change it to improve viewing.  The video came in with a stretched (horizontally) and squashed (vertical) appearance and the top and bottom of the video was clearly cut off by the black wide screen bars on the top and bottom.  The missing top and bottom of the video is evident because the sub-titles, the couple times a foreign language was used, was chopped off and not legible.  The amazon video app had a ""video settings"" section that actually had no settings to change or any way to try and inform Amazon I needed a different expect ratio.  I have a 51"" HD TV, nothing special yet this recent movie couldn't be played in a standard format?  All my other streaming services seem to be able to handle this screen.

I paid for the HD version of the rental and the clarity was horrible.  I had to stop the playback twice and resume a view minutes later.  Each time I did this, the video would come in blocky and took several minutes of viewing for it to clear up and become the higher quality (other services take seconds if not instantly HD quality), but it never reached HD level quality, unless Amazon's version of HD is 480p or 780p.  The sound playback was often fuzzy.  Also the stream oftentimes decreased to blocky quality all on its own, and while I would be tempted to accept it was my own internet connection having troubles, I have to deny it because I've streamed football games, Netflix and shows directly from different broadcasting network websites (ABC, CBS, etc.) and none of them have ever had these issues, yet the first Amazon Prime video I rent did it 3 or 4 times during the 2 hour movie.

Now I wish I had just watched the edited version of the Kingsman that I DVRed from the FXX channel instead of thinking I could get more enjoyment from an Amazon Rental. Edited with commercials would have been more enjoyed that unedited with terrible video quality.

I won't waste my money on further Amazon video rentals.  Thanks for teaching me a lesson.",1505952000,,2164,4.48469387755102

6939349,2,B00S1ITA2W,"Not too great, a few parts stood out as entertaining, but over all it simply missed the mark.  It was choppy and somehow managed to be too long while also feeling like it was missing something.  Character development/skill advancement was totally glazed over so that they could cram in all the plot points and cool gadgetry.

However, I do give the movie props for including a character who kicks serious butt with her razor sharp prosthetic legs.  Entertainment media needs to do a way better job of portraying diversity as normal-- so I give it a second star for doing that.

But mostly, this thing is just chock full of latent misogyny-- and at least one scene that is less 'latent' and more 'blatant'.  This entire movie is driven by the concept of re-imagining the spy cliches of decades past-- the entire script/plot relies heavily on that predictability, and yet, somehow, the most boring and predictable thing about this movie was how overwhelmingly androcentric it was from start to finish.  The women in this movie make a pathetic showing and are essentially afterthoughts.  Perhaps the most eyebrow quirking, wry chuckle inducing example of this is when the heroes realize they've just saved the world: the team leader is praising the main man for a job well done, and then tacks on a ""you as well"" to the third member of the team, the female member..... who, incidentally, has been ignored for the previous 20 minutes of the movie despite being the one who is ACTUALLY a Kingsman.

6939374,5,B00S1ITA2W,I thought it was great. I saw it in theaters and have watched it a couple of times since then. This go round I had an itch to watch it but my 3D blu-ray was out of reach so I just streamed it. It really is an awesome new take on a James Bond style spy movie. I could have gone for a little more intrigue but for the audience they were aiming at they did a perfect job.

Samuel Jackson seems synonymous with fbombs and violence and its not lacking here from all the cast.  The  cast with newcomers and old stars by the way is very good and work well together.  The effects are 90% great with a few being too cgi'd and fake looking but didn't distract from the movie.  Well violence is part of the theme and fight scenes are great if not believeable.

What was offensive about it is not the act itself but the fact of that up to this point, all the women portrayed in the film were strong, kick ass girls....then at the ending, you have a woman who offers up sex in exchange for saving the world....can it be any more cliche???",1504828800,,566,4.390476190476191

6939410,5,B00S1ITA2W,"A lot of the reviews here make note of the excessive violence in one stretch of the film, not realizing the point IS the excessively long over-the-top violence. So many people went into this not realizing it was based on a Marvel offshoot comic authored by Mark Millar, and is part of the same universe as Kick-Ass, penned by the same, that I can understand that thought when the movie is approached with no context.

While it certainly had a more coherent structure than the aforementioned property (referring to the films), the tone was similar enough that I found it to be an equally-matched comic-book-brought-to-the-screen entry. The cast nailed every beat, and the director knew very well how to bring the tone of the comic out, and exactly when to take things into the realm of the absurd. Colin Firth delivers a superb character, and Samuel Jackson now has a phenomenal Marvel hero and Marvel-offshoot villain on his resume.",1504656000,,932,4.861635220125786

1) it is not an action adventure. It is a horror movie with lots of gore and extreme violence.
2) they portray people who think abortion is murder and people who think homosexuality is a sin as ""a hate group""
3) the profanity is extreme . . . not just a word here and there but out of all characters' mouths and from start to finish.
4) it is at its core a black cultural movie that exudes racism and intolerance not to mention a subtle mockery of gays in the way the Jackson character speaks and the disabled in the way the Jackson character's assistant is a ""blade runner"" who uses her blades as literal blades to kill people

What it is about:
A rich American gets everyone to use his cellphone/internet service by offering it free if they use his SIM card. His plan it to kidnap the rich people of the world, lock them up in his dungeon until he activates a device in the SIM cards people took from him that take over their minds forcing them to kill each other. He wants to wipe out the earth's population with the exception of the smart rich people so he can save the planet from climate change. He even enlists the help of Barack Obama who is still president. He also plants a device into the heads of people who are working for him to accomplish this and if they are no longer useful or in danger of exposing his plan he blows up their heads.

Not wanting to be lost with the soon to be released sequel, I had to watch. It reminds me of Austin Powers, Get Smart Maxwell, and Roger Moore's James Bond all mashed up with a HUGE dash of Robert Downy Jr.'s Sherlock Holmes. filming techniques and Kill Bill style scenes  I was not disappointed - well, just slightly. Okay, so here me out - the language was just over-the-top, too much for me. There was so much emphasis on ""Kingsmen"" being so stately, presentable, and distinguished but they had street-gutter language. Another reason I point this out is that all the graphic killing produced no blood. And, I mean NO blood. That said, I think the writers and director missed a huge comedic point to have their Kingsmen ""swear"" in a very nostalgic, antiquated manner that bewilders Eggsy and Eggsy's street language grates the Kingsmen.  If Mark Gratiss or Stephen Moffat had made this movie, they would have capitalized on that point.

A perfect combination of charming and handsome good guys, a fantastically crazy bad guy, and, in my opinion, the best fight scenes on film.  There is a scene so ridiculously violent that you would think, ""how can I watch this?"" but it's just...so...AMAZING that you look forward to it every time!  Does that make me a bad person?

It was on my third play through that I realized there is a scene in the credits. Needless to say I decided to purchase the movie. Looking further into this movie I found there is a second do in a couple months! Also, that the movie was based on a comic series. Luckily the comic store had all of them. The movie and comics are just different enough for both to be extremely entertaining. Well, in my opinion.

6939561,5,B00S1ITA2W,"My kids love this movie, and stupidly, I thought that was enough of a reason for me not to watch it. When I saw the initial trailer, i thought it would be one of those Harry Potter, Hunger Games, etc. kid flicks. However, after continued recommendations from the kids, I sat down and gave it a view, and boy was i pleasantly surprised. After realizing it was rated R, I realized that the language and tone were well in line with my type of movie.

This is an awesome little spy movie! The plot centers on a young Brit from the wrong side of the tracks, who's father was killed while working for a secret order of spies. His death buys the kid a free ride into the organization, and the hijinks ensue. The young man learns of the spy order's history, their purpose, and how to be a Kingsman. This is a young James Bond on steroids, and may I add, a lot more fun and interesting to watch.

Samuel L. Jackson is hysterical as the wacky villain, and Colin Firth is excellent as the young spy's mentor. When Samuel L. gets into his rant about his Arch Criminal designs (even better than Mr. Glass), you might just be rooting for him to succeed, or not. Michael Cain is Michael Cain, of course, but Taron Egerton holds his own and maybe tops them all with his punk to gentleman act. My Fair Lady and James Bond in one film, and it works! Most of you kids don't know My Fair Lady, so just enjoy the show. All the acting is very well done, and the action scenes are fast, fun, and head spinning to watch. Although this steals a lot from the Bond films, it does so in a tongue in cheek manner that pokes fun at the source material, and all the while keeps you engrossed in the story of a young spy learning the ropes in order to save the world when things go ""T!ts Up"" as the Brits so humorously put it.

If you are a Christian or like Christians, or if you are just sick and tired of stereotypical anti-religious hatred then avoid this movie.

6939582,5,B00S1ITA2W,"""Manners.  Maketh.  Man.  Do you know what that means?""

Kingsman is a movie that's ""taking the piss"" out of itself.  It's a self-aware parody of the most lovable cliches in spy and action flicks.
Guns?  Check.  Gadgets?  Check.  Fight scenes?  Check.  Lovable British quips, euphemisms, and dry humour?  Check.  Kingsman from beginning to end is a movie that asks you less to suspend your disbelief, and more to put on your funny glasses and dunce hat.  It's not so self-aware that it's constantly droning about it, however.

PLOT:  4/5 Kingsman's story is more-or-less well thought-out, and is cohesive through and through.  Some early establishing storyline is missing for sake of runtime, but nothing so much that would ruin the experience.  Of course, Kingsman is designed to be entertainment for the story-weary, so don't expect Shakespeare.

CINEMATOGRAPHY:  4/5 Kingsman's photography is beautiful throughout.  Some obvious CGI ruins the more beautiful moments, but overall a perfectly honed experience.  ""Continuous/one-shot"" takes used in moderation spice up the action, while excellent practical set-pieces bring the story to life.

EXCITEMENT:  5/5 Kingsman is absolutely thrilling.  From beginning to end, it's guns, guts, and glory, with only intermittent bureaucracy to interrupt.

TAKEAWAY:  5/5  Kingsman is lacking only where the harshest critics look: realism and depth.  Kingsman, however, is a story that *intentionally* aims to miss the incredibly high bar of similar spy films such as the Bond or Bourne franchises.  If that can be kept in mind, Kingsman is a very worthy action/comedy to be added to your collection.",1497139200,6,1640,5.367588932806324

6939592,1,B00S1ITA2W,"This movie was so incredibly awful I felt compelled to write a review on it. I thoroughly regret watching even half of it, let alone paying for it. I ended up fast forwarding through much of the end. I honestly can think of no worse movie than this one, in all the years of movie watching.
I love spy movies. This is not a proper spy movie. There is no brilliant plot, nothing to uncover that isn't obvious in the first few minutes, no cunning subterfuge, no suspense, no charm, and we couldn't care two cents about the characters. The only reason I thought it might be good is because it involves spies, Colin Firth and Michael Caine. I'm sad and disappointed they chose to sign on for such a terrible, plotless movie. In fact, watching it felt like some maniac pervert just wanted to get some graphically violent scenes out of his system and had to find a plot to justify all the swearing and limb chopping, and exploding heads. This is seriously the worst writing I have ever witnessed. And can we please just stop casting Samuel L Jackson as the villain? Even if the plot wasn't so thin and obvious (crazy black dude with bug eyes wants to cleanse the world-yeah, that's original), casting him with an all white cast pretty much immediately gives everything away.",1496188800,,1267,4.537117903930131

6939594,2,B00S1ITA2W,"This is not a movie in the sense that the Jason Bourne, or James Bond movies are; no, this is more of a mishmash of action cinema, puerile nonsense, and gratuitous violence. On the one hand, one of the major themes of the movie is ""culling"" the human race of the 99% who aren't rich or spectacularly talented. The villain's plan is that nly the dumb and average die.on a particular day. The brilliant and the rich get to survive in some underground castle. That part reminded me of Middle Ages Noble People partying in a castle while poor people died of the Plague in the cities and towns. To be honest, that theme can be found so frequently in human history that I'm not surprised it is presented here. I'm thinking, of course, of all the exceptionals who don't have to go to war - like those who tested out of the Vietnam War, for example.
Other that that, the rest is pure, comic book mind nonsense. Lots of competition, violence, and ""sound and fury signifying nothing"" fill up the rest of the movie. Two of the most disappointing are a bullet proof, umbrella shield/gun, and a sad, truncated space fall. An umbrella that shoot bullets is just stupid. A fall from the edge of space that didn't use the real, space fall video, such as: (Felix Baumgartner's Highest and Fastest Freefall) which can be readily found on YouTube is tragic. Splicing Baumgartner's free fall from near space into this film flop might have actually saved it at the box office. This is an action movie and it ended, more or less, with two scenes: scene 1) had nearly everyone of the chosen survivors die from an exploding head, and scene 2) the hero bu@@ering the queen of Sweden.
Ultimately, the thee plot in KINGSMAN is so thin and the writing so bad that KINGSMAN makes a Vin Diesel movie look like Tolstoy's War & Peace in comparison.",1496102400,,1816,4.522796352583587

But, once the violence started kicking in, mostly towards the end, I felt it went downhill very quickly. I don't mind violence if it moves the plot forward, or even if it just fits within the story line, but their dark humor approach to the massive killing of the world's elite, including the POTUS, came across in poor taste. An otherwise witty script was suddenly filled with crass jokes and innuendos.  Again, a crass joke, if it fits the delivering character, is acceptable, but these jokes were detrimental to the development of the characters, and caused them to act in conflict with who they'd been up to that point.

6939653,5,B00S1ITA2W,"I do not write reviews often, and nor do I think I am particularly good at it, but I do feel rather compelled to do so for this movie. Kingsman: The Secret Service was a pick for a Sunday night movie in order to pass the time. I had not done any research into its success/failure as a movie, I did not look into the plot, and finally I did not go into this movie expecting anything short of a time killer.

With that being said: I will be recommending this movie for everyone I know that has not seen it and needs a late Sunday movie to kill the time, because I cannot express enough how much of a joy it was to watch.

Kingsman, to me at first, seemed like another droning spy type movie with some substance (enough to combat the lazy Sunday blues) but not enough to make it worthy of praising. Yet here I am doing just that: I adore this movie wholeheartedly. I found very few moments that made me look away at my phone (as I am sure many of you do during a home movie) in order to break the monotony of the film. You know, those moments of a film that are so very predictable that you simply interpret what will happen, and often are confirmed correct, so you look at your phone for whatever reason in order to wait out the inevitable. I will not jest and say that this movie is perfect in every way but I can confirm, it did the job and it did it so very well.

I will end with this note: I am an aircraft mechanic by trade and there is a part later in the movie where an aircraft comes out of the ground. I quite literally lost my metaphorical mind and could not stop spazzing to my wife about how wrong that scene was. And that, the moment where I lost my cool and starting screaming about wonky physics, is why I love this movie. I only walked away with one criticism and it was based on a part of this film that doesn't actually relate at all to the plot, progression, or style. 1K/1K",1491091200,12,1892,4.067024128686327

It featured some great actors, and the lead is a very charming actor whom you want to keep watching. But it was a little over-the-top, especially the violence at the peak of the film (that I don't think enhanced the experience-- at least, not for me). My boyfriend was not keen on it, either. To be fair, he is not always a fan of English films, but I am. We were both left with mixed emotions, but neither of us would recommend it to anyone we know.",1491004800,2,606,4.188034188034188

This movie is more inclined to the younger generation, yes, but if you like excitement and adventure, then take a peek. You won't be bored, I assure you. Plenty of action to keep you on the edge of your seat with lots of cool secret spy gadgets that make you wonder... do they really make that?

6939671,5,B00S1ITA2W,"I am honestly shocked that this movie doesn't have a higher review. I always recommend this movie if someone enjoyed watching John Wick (and I always recommend John Wick if they haven't seen it yet). 15/16 people I have made a recommendation to watch this movie have enjoyed it on varying levels, and only 1 just didn't care to finish watching it.

Listen, this isn't the best movie I have ever seen, but this movie knows what it is and does a very good job in that respect. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and it's an entertaining modern spy film that pays homage to the older ones. I also have to note that I've never been a big fan of spy movies in general (some are fantastic, but a lot fall flat for me).

I absolutely love Colin Firth (one of my favorite actors) and it was so fantastic seeing him in this sort of role. I thought he did a fantastic job in this movie. Samuel L. Jackon's performance was ... well, classic Samuel L. Jackson. If you expect a lot out of him then you will always be ... let's just say ""disappointed"" and leave it at that.

I  have watched this movie easily 6 times now and plan on watching this with each new friend I encounter that hasn't seen it.

Gory? Certainly in certain parts, but it's not constant. They also did a splendid job at the end of the movie avoiding unnecessary gore in a rather creative (and rather comical) way.",1489708800,3,1373,4.326848249027237

I was a Bond and British Avengers fan and this movie captures and even expands on the things that made those shows great entertainment, and with a tad of humor too. But, there was a lot of horrific violence. Too much graphic violence. And although the over the top graphic violence is reserved for the bad and unlikable characters there is too much. The extreme church scene makes you wonder if the director has some desire to massacre those he disapproves of. Does he see these lives as meaningless or enjoy seeing them all murdered? And the gentlemanly characters are tarnished with the vulgar language. There is also a cheap shot at Republicans when one character says that he is a Republican so he is ok with global mass murder. Really? Otherwise, it is a very entertaining movie with a very likable but not to be taken too seriously plot.",1486080000,,969,4.6395348837209305

6939772,5,B00S1ITA2W,"Cleverly written ""spy movie"" with its tongue firmly in its cheek.  Almost as much dark-leaning comedy and social commentary as action, adventure and violence.  Pokes fun (not-so-subtly) at the ""spy movie"" genre itself, at several points in the film.  On a scale between ""classic Bond"" as (1) and ""Tarantino"" as (10), this is about a 7.  Really well-played by the strong cast, with tight editing and very good action sequences.  Not for the easily (perhaps even moderately easily) offended.  Lots of cussing (maybe a bit more than I use IRL, but not gratuitously so IMHO).  Some violent scenes, and some theatrical use of CGI (call it ""decorative"" or ""fun,"" as some violence just is TOO graphic to be shown as it would actually appear in reality).  I would guess that Jarvis Cocker from the band Pulp really likes this film.  A smart and rollicking good time.",1484697600,,858,4.821917808219178

After reading comments in the one and two star reviews, I almost passed on this movie, but decided to read a few comments in the 4 and 5 star reviews, and was persuaded to give Kingsman a chance, and I am very glad that I did!  I rented Kingsman with the intention of watching it once, but now I wish I had brought it for a few dollars more because I would like to watch it again.

I highly recommend Kingsman to adults viewers, but Kingsman is NOT a family friendly movie; there is a great deal of foul language, violence and much too much killing ... in fact slaughtering people is the theme of this movie, but if you can get over that, the storyline is unbelievably thrilling from beginning to end.

6939851,4,B00S1ITA2W,"This is a British Spy comedy movie.  A combination of James Bond and Harry Potter to the effect of Chinese martial art, violent gun shooting and
computer-chip controlled machines including human being.  Funny and Entertaining.  Personally, I don't like the overflowing foul language part.
A ""R"" rating is justified.  Now, the plot.  Eggsy is a British young man with no aim in life.  He lives with his mom and drunken step-father. Everyday, he wanders in street and meets so-called neighbors in a pub / bar.  His deceased father's friend, HH once gave him a neck-chain medal and a telephone number.  One day, Eggsy is caught as car-thief and he needs a bail.  For the first time, he called that telephone number for help.  A change for his entire life since then.
HH is actually a British spy in a secret operation, Kingsman.  He tells Eggsy two things: 1) Eggsy's deceased father has once saved his life.
2) He wants Eggsy to follow his father's track by joining the secret service operation.  With nothing to lose, Eggsy immediately accepts this invitation.  An intensive training is mandatory.  Only one out of six participants will be confirmed.  Eggsy fails in his final test for not shooting to death his companion dog.  The winner is young lady.  Not long after, HH is found dead. (How?  See this movie).  Eggsy is then called back to help solve this terrorism.
Kingsman has been investigating and linking three events: 1) Dead agent.  2) Kidnapped professor.  3) RV, a weird billionaire.  Assisted with high technology, Eggsy enters and eliminates this RV's evil empire for a better world.  (How?  See this movie).  Like every James Bond's movie, our hero Eggsy mingles with a rescued lady.  Oh, she is caught bottomless (not frontal) and this movie ends here.",1483056000,,1768,4.848993288590604

6939862,2,B00S1ITA2W,"Ordered it before I saw it, saw it with someone and now want to return it. It had promise. One issue is that there were wa-ay too many F bombs in this film. Not a fan of them anyway but it was almost as if the writers were trying to reach a certain number of them or something because they were in unneccessarily. That aside, I found the movie a curious mix of genres and storylines. It was like Bond Quantum of Solace's storyline where the bad guy uses concern for the planet as a cover for other endeavors, like XXX in the use of biotechnology on people as a means to an end with an egomaniac who thinks he can rule the world, like 8 Mile or any number of movies in the loss of a father figure and a mom who gets with anyone to make it though there are consequences on mostly the son and herself. There are many more parallels I could draw but the point is that in spite of a relatively good lead cast, I felt bits and pieces were redundant storylines to other films but curiously mixed, and the film didn't come together in a way that left me satisfied as a moviewatcher. Some potential storylines could have been explored more to add depth and humanity or triumph but werent. The way a main character died was unsatisfying, the presence of a seemingly smart princess who refuses to give in to pressure only to later resort to throwing herself at a younger man while still in her prison cell when said young man just literally came into his manhood, the adoption of a lisp for Samuel L Jackson's character that has no point, all just added to my wish that the movie had offered more substance and a smoother delivery. Like I said, I wanted to like it and the movie had promise. Unfortunately it didn't live up to hype.",1482796800,2,1721,4.26605504587156

6939951,1,B00S1ITA2W,"This film breaks down the fabric of morality by attempting to present scenarios that are plausible, however, here is a highlight of what's in the movie. The only one who officially gets to be a Kingsman is a girl who has to be coddled into each testing situation that they all must pass. Next she becomes the victor because she's the only one who can kill a puppy on command, which shows how little importance there is in society of a women's role as a nurturer. Aside from the retarded amount of killing, brought to an artistic level of idiocy, the highlight of the film is the hero of the film sodomizing a beautiful princess. I only wish I could rate this with a negative star.

The movie was good but there were some stereotypical portrayals of criminals. The Middle Easterners were only portrayed as criminals.

The evil guy decided to test his devices in a church. Not all churches are like that and it's offensive to show peaceable religious folk either dying or killing others. Too close to home, and it's a lack of respect. I would not recommend this movie to religious folk.",1479254400,,418,4.873239436619718

Action scenes are well done and there are a couple of very laughable moments. Like I mentioned a few gaps in the timeline (maybe left out for time sake) in the admission to end of training seem to make you think that all of them were extremely well trained before they got there which is unlikely but does speed the training time (as noted by the dogs as puppies to almost adult at the finish of training) Worth watching.",1475366400,,642,4.358333333333333

6940051,3,B00S1ITA2W,"I realize this is a spy spoof, but this is just another modern film that proves conclusively that just because you can do something, doesn't necessarily mean that you should. The movie shows signs of having class, style, and some really good effects, but erupts with classless senseless violence before the end of the movie.  The only thing that saved the rating above a 5 was it had a good ending with good closure.  This movie could have been sensational, but unfortunately turned into nothing more than one of those chain saw horror films on steroids.  If you like that sort of film, this movie is for you.

This is, to me, the perfect summation of the tone of this movie. Not only is it a clever observation, but it puts Kingsman's influences on front-street. However, despite being an excellent parody/style pastiche of the spy genre, Kingsman also manages to be genuinely compelling and, perhaps most importantly, extremely badass.

6940118,5,B00S1ITA2W,"Kingsman was on my To-Watch List and I've finally seen it. I wish people were more convincing in getting others to watch this because this movie was so darn FUN!

I review this with a huge smile on my face as I just finished watching. I came into this movie expecting something like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Get-Smart/dp/B001XUW0TU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Get Smart</a>: a lot of spy with a lot of comedy. I was totally wrong in my expectations and was completely blown away.

 THE INGREDIENTS 
Kingsman is the perfection of the formula you want in a spy action movie: amazing action sequences, mesmerizing long takes, sexy lead characters, just enough British quirks and humor (without being a comedy), a villain with a diabolical plan, and a third act that will leave your jaws open with a smile at the endand leaving you wanting more.

 THE VILLIANS 
Samuel L. Jackson plays an unconventional villain who's trying to save the world in a way that only a villain would. But one of the highlights of this movie is his sidekick, the legless assassin, Gazelle (I see a very bright future for this actress). Instead of feet, she has prosthetics that happen to be highly lethal blades. And the fight at the end between the Hero and the Sidekick Villain nearlynearlyrivals that of Gogo Yubari and The Bride (of Kill Bill). You're breathless throughout this fight.

 THE HEROS 
We start with a, I believe the term is ""Chav"" (a working class individual who displays brash behavior), who's our main character. Of course, he happens to have a particular history with the Kingsman and gets recruited. What follows is a journey for him and his peer candidates. You will see lots of various physical and mental tests that challenge these trainees to see if they have what it takes, and some of these challenges get really brutal. This is Rated R, ya know.

 RATED R 
It's Rated R for a very good reason: it's so damn bloody and doesn't hold back. Imagine if Bond was Rated R, this is what you would get. Real life spy adventures are not PG-13. People get killed, blood gets spilled. Some of it is a bit gratuitous but never enough where I had to look away. You must be comfortable with blood if you're watching this.

 SUMMARY 
If you enjoyed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kick-Ass/dp/B003TOMAPC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kick-Ass</a>&nbsp;(same director), if you love Bond, and if want an entertaining movie experience, you will LOVE Kingsman. I can't wait for the sequel. Highly recommended.",1471478400,,2580,5.195652173913044
6940119,4,B00S1ITA2W,This was an excellent action movie from beginning to end with a good storyline. I gave it only 4 stars because the language was brutal and unecessary a great deal of the time. Not one to let the kiddos watch for sure.,1471392000,,217,4.190476190476191

It may seem as if I may be damning with faint praise, however I do like this movie.  The choice of actors is brilliant, and I love the scene almost at the end where Eggsy gets the girl.  It's pretty hysterical even though apparently some have found it to be sexist.

Again, except for the test run, which was pretty heinous. We've watched it three times now, and I've not watched the middle of this big scene since the first time.

The characters are interesting, if exaggerated, and the plot is fast and interesting. My main problem with the movie was the characterization of women the happened in the very end escape scenes. The idea that a head of state would 'reward' her rescuer with anal sex in order to be rescued rather than left behind played into every gendered trope there is about women, power, and sexuality. It ruined the entire movie for me.",1467590400,2,599,4.454545454545454

Without telling the main plot ,this is about a private group of well funded people , trained , and equipped people that is able to get th e job done , that the regular Spy Agencies are not willing to do .

6940363,1,B00S1ITA2W,"Enjoyed the plot, the action, the comedy and the actors performances.  However, were it not for a perverted form of humor at the end of the movie, I'd likely give four stars rather than one.  I don't see the objectification of women through anal sex as good.  It would have been good if the princess simply offered a kiss for saving the world.  Rather, the last scene, pornographic, injuring the dignity of women, highlighting the injustice of sexual immorality, really ruined the movie for me.

Do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of righteousness. --Romans 6:13

Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a person commits are outside the body, but whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body. --1 Corinthians 6:18

When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me. --1 Cornithians 13:11

Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies.  --1 Corinthians 6:20",1464048000,,1303,4.51063829787234

6940375,5,B00S1ITA2W,"This is a movie that tries to explain an organization that works outside of government.  Three things to remember in this movie.  1.) Although it is an action movie it is also a bit of a dark comedy.  They don't expect you to take it seriously and many parts will be over the top as they poke fun at much of the groups portrayed.  In fact a number of things are fake on purpose, but you have to pay attention when maybe they talk about wine or music.  Much of the comedy is hidden in innuendo's and references that are made throughout the film.  Some parts are predictable and others take you on blindsided.  No political branch of any country is exempt from being poked fun at.  Fight scenes are a bit drawn out, but it's to get you to feel anxious about the outcome they are trying to prevent, or are they?  Guess you'll have to find out.  Overall very enjoyable, not for the pre-teen set as there is a lot of fighting, bullets and a bit of james bond esque female show at the end.",1463529600,,983,4.208556149732621

6940401,4,B00S1ITA2W,"Sometimes you can just tell when actors are having a blast making a movie.  The action is far-fetched and non-stop, and the story is so over the top your eyes tend to fog over, but there's no question the actors are having fun.  So when you get normally somber, dead serious actors like Colin Firth, Mark Strong, and Samuel L. Jackson letting their professional hair down in a romp for the ages, you get a terrifically fun movie like KINGSMAN:  THE SECRET SERVICE.  Based on a comic book I know zilch about, this is the story of a secret UK spy organization that takes on the world's nastiest villains.  To keep the Kingsman going, they must continue to recruit new members--yet the training process can be literally life-threatening.  A new class of recruits--including ""Eggsy"", a chip-on-his-shoulder street brawler (played enthusiastically by Taron Egerton)--must pass the ultimate test before the winner of the training competition gets his tailored suit and becomes a member of the ultimate spy class. . .only to have to take on Valentine (Jackson, who is a hoot), a technological mastermind about to take over the world via a special smart phone app.

Again, this movie is way over the top--but in the most fun way imaginable.  Firth is wonderful as Harry Hart, the Kingsman's ace super sleuth who recruits Eggsy; there is a scene in a crowded church where Firth's character does some eye-popping carnage not to be missed.  And the recruits are trained by Merlin (Strong) a by-the-book secret agent who puts his charges to the test, whether it's flooding their sleeping chamber, or announcing--while the recruits are freefalling through the air--that one of them has no parachute.  All of it darn good fun.  The showdown is lame pizza supreme but terrific nonetheless, showcased by Eggsy taking on Valentine's assassin (the gorgeous Sofia Boutella), who happens to be wearing the world's deadliest stilettos.  The conclusion is open-ended, suggesting a sequel may be in the works, which is fine with this reviewer; KINGSMAN:  THE SECRET SERVICE is way too fun to be enjoyed in a single dose.

I rented this expecting another humdrum, run-of-the-mill spy movie, and what I got was SO MUCH MORE!
What makes this movie great is that it not only has cool spy movie action (and believe me, it definitely has that), but it also tackles current events. Domestic abuse, climate change, hateful cults, the 1%, it has it all.
And that's what takes Kingsman to the next level. On the surface it appears to be just another spy action flick, but it's much more sophisticated and raises some hard questions about our society, like how people with good intentions sometimes do horrible things, or how those we trust to protect us from psychopaths can be corrupted by those same psychopaths.

6940454,5,B00S1ITA2W,"this was a film I was initially somewhat reluctant to see.

Not being a fan of a lot of digitized effects, some of the visual flash I saw in the trailer was a turn off. Like my action done for real, with in camera effects and stuntmen. But several associates -all of whom I respect- recommended it, It was on HBO, and luckily in it's original 2:35 to 1 aspect ratio.

Meaning 'widescreen', of course.

When I decided to watch it I was immediately struck by how well it was directed. And as you watched it how well it was acted.

Then the strength of the narrative, which never lagged, kept you going. What I enjoyed the most, however came upon repeated viewings.

The heart, and moral center of the film is just, well, terrific. Making an 'R' rated actioner with broad appeal across the charts was an accomplishment
in and of itself. But addressing the core issues of home, family, honor, courage and commitment was an unexpected treat.

As was one of the quotes, which is commonly mistaken to be by Hemingway but is most likely Indian in origin:

'There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man. The nobility is being superior to your former self'.

The film is rich in character, and the performances -particularly Colin Firth and newcomer Taron Egerton are just first rate. Even the
overexposed Samuel L Jackson finds fresh turf in his performance as the mega villain.

The production design is first rate. The music score, called a 'loving tribute to (Bond composer) John Barry is also excellent.

In short, I was knocked out by how good this film is...",1461542400,5,1570,4.594982078853047

6940498,3,B00S1ITA2W,"""Kingsman"" is not only a story about a young lad being trained in an ultra-secret service agency similar to Mi6 of the James Bond universe. Kingsman is also about satirizing Bond and other similar action fair. Other films are directly or indirectly referenced in ""Kingsman"", sometimes to good effect, other times with mixed results. So is the film about its story/plot or its references to other cinematic shoot-em-up films of similar ilk? Rather depends upon how you view it. For my money, the endless references to action cinema did become a bit overdone.

""Kingsman"" incorporates two plots which become intertwined by the end. The first, and most interesting, is the training of a youth on the eve of adulthood. ""Eggsy"" Unwin (Taron Egerton) is the son of a Kingsman who sacrificed himself to save his colleagues on his mission when his son was only a toddler. One of the operatives, code named Galahad (Colin Firth) gives the toddler a medallion. The late father was code named Lancelot. The film then fast-forwards many years later and now Eggsy is near adulthood but not very mature. He encounters Galahad who offers him a spot in a program with other recruits designed to train future kingsmen, in particular to fill the vacant spot of Lancelot. The training program I thought was the strongest part of the film as the coaches/trainers use no-win scenarios to challenge their recruits into finding creative solutions.

The other story involves a billionaire, Richmond Valentine (Samuel Jackson), who has some strange ideas about defeating global warming. He makes endless speeches to both audiences and individuals with a lisp. Also in Jackson's service, as either an employee or slave, is Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) who sports razor sharp blades in place of normal feet. I started to guess when she appeared in scenes without Jackson, an extra or three was going to encounter the business end of Gazelle's ""shoes"".

Underneath Valentine's seemingly innocent philanthropy in which he offers free internet and cell phone service through his network is a calculated plan to eradicate global warming. Trouble is, the plan involves causing people to engage in Godzilla-like violent behavior. He also implants computer chips into peoples' necks in which they become mindless minions in service to Valentine. Eventually, we see a demonstration of Valentine's plot in action when he decides to off the congregation of a church of far-right congregants in Kentucky who make Mussolini and Stalin look pretty democratic. The violence in the church was so over-the-top and grotesque, I found I was not enjoying it and wanted to fast-forward out of the scene.

While I definitely liked the youth's introduction to Kingsman through Galahad, and I thought Jackson made a good baddie, the endless references to Bond-like cinema I thought was overkill. Not only are Bond films and ""Trading Places"" referenced, but there's parallel's with ""2012"" and there's even an indirect wink to the film ""Pulp Fiction"", which also starred Jackson. Also, the combat scenes were gratuitously violent for no apparent reason. This film is billed as an action-comedy, but I didn't find myself laughing when people's limbs were chopped off. When either Galahad or Gazelle rip into their victims, they literally come apart at the seams.

By the end of ""Kingsman"", I wasn't sure what I had seen. Was this a comedy? Kind of. A spoof? Maybe. An homage to action cinema a la the 1960's variety? I guess so. At one point Jackson and Firth talk about those films from their youth, and Jackson even says ""It's not that kind of a movie"". And I think I had to agree. I wasn't sure what kind of movie this was in the first place, and I was still confused by the end.",1459641600,,3725,4.972712680577849

For me, it had everything: great acting, a solid story line with a few twists that were unexpected for the most part, and lovely cinematography. My favorite part about comic books turned movies are those beautiful shots that are reminiscent of a comic panel, and Kingsman certainly used those to its advantage, along with heavily stylized fight scenes. I at first thought that the fight scenes were going to bother me, since Im incredibly squeamish about blood and gore, but I found that it was done in such a way that it really was like reading a comic, and I didn't have to turn away when things turned violent which is rare for me.

Don't expect it to be like any of the recent 007 movies. This movie is supposed to make you laugh with its dialogue and get you amped during any of the numerous fight scenes. Just sick back shut the hell up and enjoy the film. And to all the 1 star reviewers out there who can't deal with the idea of anal sex; watch the church scene one more time.

And any movie that begins with a Dire Straights song is going to get two stars from me right off the bat for fondling my misty teenage memories.

The movie is James Bond and Japanese anime meet R Lee Ermey's watermelon shattering gun collection as used by ""the Joker.""  There is just something gross, and well, reassuring when you see heads pop off of world leaders.  Especially when they think they are giving the shaft to all of us ""little"" people.

i know this was based off a comic, i have never read the comics, but i enjoyed this very much as a movie all in itself.  if you are a comic book fan, you will probably enjoy this movie. The plot line is not super obvious- its a fresh concept- and there are some unexpected twists that keep you on your toes, as well as lots of funny moments.

6940709,2,B00S1ITA2W,"Kingsman-Secret Service(released Dec/14) stars,among others,Colin Firth,Samuel L. Jackson,Mark Strong,Taron Egerton, Sophie Cookson and Michael Caine. The film has all the slam bam,thank you mam action that one could ever ask for in an action film. However I just couldn't dig it. Why? Let's see.
The story is about the Kingsman,a special secret branch of the British government who fight those who would do the free world harm. The film opens 17 years before the present as one of its top agents gets killed. Firth who runs the day to day operations attends the home of his deceased agent and presents his wife with a special Kingsman medallion. She is grief stricken and rebuffs his gift. Instead he bestows it on her young son. On the medallion is a phone number and Firth tells them if they are ever in trouble to call it and repeat a special word code to the operator.
17 years later and the son(Eggerton) is grown up. His mother has married an abusive man and Eggerton is somewhat of a loose canon,and with a chip on his shoulder. He gets arrested and decides to call the medallion number. Firth comes poste haste and he is released. In fact Firth recruits him to join the secret service,along with several other candidates. They meet the head of the organization,Caine.
After a grueling months long training the candidates are whittled down to Cookson and Eggerton. Their immediate mission,as circumstances have moved along throughout the film dictate,is the take down of one Mr. Valentine(Jackson).He is a genius who has gone more than a little off kilter. What has been happening is that he is introducing free internet,free phone calls and phones to the world. However every phone has a sound trigger. When activated the sound causes people to go berserk and kill every person they see. He also has contacted hundreds of heads of states to convert them over to this forced""culling"" of the Earth population. Those he converts will be present and accounted for as they watch the world go to hell in Jackson's remote mountain lair. Each person has a tracking pellet implanted in their head. Those people he cannot convert he imprisons.
Jackson tests his sound trigger out on a church congregation,at which Firth attends by invite. When it goes off Firth becomes unable to stop himself from annihilating a good number of the worshipers, before they can kill themselves. Outside the church afterwards Firth and Jackson meet. Jackson unceremoniously puts a bullet through Firths head.
Eggerton and Cookson have their work cut out for themselves. Eggerton gets a lift via jet to the mountain lair,while Cookson sits on a chair lifted to the stratosphere by two large balloons. On board is a missile,which is intended to take out Jackson's own satellite before he can use it to send the deadly signals through the phones. Eggerton becomes of age as an agent as he infiltrates the lair,his skills at their keenest level. Just as Jackson sends out his signal the satellite goes out. However he switches over to another, but must keep console contact in order to keep the signal going. Ultimately Eggerton succeeds in taking down Jackson and stopping world carnage.
The movie moves along quite swiftly and between the S/FX and groove enchanced music,it has a rhythm all its own. The action is fast paced when it comes,and it comes often. All involved did a fine job with their parts....so why do I NOT like this film? It hit me at a gut level,the wrong way. The film moves constantly back and forth between a serious Secret Service and a cartoonish one. Cartoonish in the sense of the incredible stunts no ordinary man could do,such as super high flying kicks and rolls and the super fast fighting pace they display. Then there is Jackson's character. He looks just plain strange/silly and that lisp affectation is a no go right from the start. Then we have the piece' de resistance when the high profile converts and guards get their heads blown up in a spectacular colour light show. All mushroom straight up. The accompanying music just makes it all seem strangely bizarre but funny. These examples and others took away from my enjoyment of it.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:39:1 and is clear and crisp. There are no extras.
All in all this film was a real disappointment. The makers tried their darnedest and made a sophisticated effort. However it became a mish mash of a rollercoaster ride,one minute serious,the next comic. I think it tried to walk the fine line between both but it failed. Given the story line and content it was like watching James Bond on speed. Sean Connery could get down and dirty when circumstances called for it, but he also could have lighter moments,but you knew it was all grounded in a serious dynamic. This film's lighter moments go so far over the top that it loses its grounding. 2 1/2-3 stars.",1454544000,,4855,4.801672640382318

It's quite enjoyable to see the otherwise cast often earlier in Romantic or stoic ""British"" Aristocratic character roles Colin Firth as an action super hero.  It was very believable and he acquitted himself very well in the role.

The actors are great. They have some heavy hitters in this movie. It was a late bloomer. Not many saw it in the theater, but at home. Lots of good reviews. I really hope they make second one.

The kid does a good job with the script but I can't say his character is a scene stealer and he plays the ""chip on the shoulder"" card a bit too much.  Firth is the heart of the movie but I don't know that they intended him to be the way it moves along...if they had focused on Firth and changed a few points, then we could have had a fun series of films for those that don't want the angst of Bourne or the drama of Bond.  Kill an entire room of people (don't want to spoil so no details) and you are more worried about what led to it than the blood on your hands.  That's good stuff but as I said...it goes missing.  Jackson was a character that I wanted to like, he was funny, sort of complex and it was a take on a villain that i had never seen before which was great.  In the end, it seemed that the parody was larger than the character and it fell flat during the most climactic scene.  I would recommend it for a fun movie with friends or to rent, not sure it would make my list of must have movies but I'll definitely watch it again.",1452988800,3,1200,3.970833333333333

Everything except the marketing MORON at the company that decided to put the special features only on the Blue Ray package and/or that the BlueRay package didn't include a normal dvd copy of the move at the same time with the special features!!!!!  WHAT WERE YOU THINKING??????

My attitude on this is hampered by the fact that Wal-Mart refused to accept me returning the purchase, even though I had the receipt. (I had taken the shrink off before noticing that the package didn't have a dvd copy, since there was a sticker over the box front at that critical point!!!!!  Thanks factory!!!!  (It's all A-OK though - I will get a BR player someday before too much longer, and this taught me to not buy any media at W/M anymore. That'll teach'em! hehe)

But the movie is a lot of fun and SLJ is most-excellent as always! His affected speech for the movie is lots of fun to hear, and as far as a James Bond-styled movie, this was a LOT more fun and engaging than any Bond film I have seen in the last 15 years. The plot moves quickly and the pacing of the movie is great. No real down moments or boring bits. SLJ's main henchwoman is a lot of fun and she is DEADLY with those blade legs!!

6940878,2,B00S1ITA2W,"Yes, I liked the cast, the story, and the look of the movie, but there was no dialog.  Well, there was, but it mostly consisted of two words.  After the first 25 F-words, the dialog went from being annoying to boring.  By the time the word was used more than 50 times, it was too disappointing to enjoy.  Think how easy that was for the screen writers.  Excitement = F-word, celebration = F-word, anger = F-word, threat = F-word, casual conversation = F-word, fear = F-word repeated over and over, etc.  Oh, maybe they didn't use writers, just a computer that inserted the word multiple times in every scene.  B-O-R-I-N-G.  And the killing was really odd with a high creep value.  Killing scores of people in detail was really over-kill in so many ways.  I thought the movie would be smart and fun. and it was really close to working, but it didn't work for me.  What a waste of a good cast, and promising story.",1450569600,,912,4.433734939759036

6940892,5,B00S1ITA2W,"I really did not have great expectations regarding this movie.  I thought it would probably rate a notch or two below your average James Bond movie.  I was definitely wrong on that one.  It is a very clever movie, and it managed to distinguish itself from other ""spy movies"" quite nicely.  Heavy on the action, but the storyline works.  I would actually consider this movie on par with the best of the James Bond movies  - it's different but in this case, that is a good thing.

6940895,5,B00S1ITA2W,"Brilliant, funny, action, heroes! Colin Firth is amazing as always but also in top physical form! Michael Caine should be contracted for every motion picture made even as a walk on. Classic and Classy. I've watched 3 times and I'm still laughing out loud and wide eyed by the incredible action. Samuel Jackson is there too as the quirky, almost lovable villain. Only criticism is it's a tad too long- a bit too many James Bond routines rolled together the last 30 minutes. But I still love it, script to acting directing special effects and soundtrack. What a pleasant surprise, hoping for a sequel with Firth as a hologram via Star Trek. Throw in a few bits of Peter Sellers and a great script.",1450224000,,695,4.612903225806452
6940896,3,B00S1ITA2W,"Released in early 2015, Kingsman: The Secret Service stars Taron Egerton as Eggsy, a recruit for super-secret spy organization headquartered in England run by characters played by Michael Caine, Colin Firth and Mark Strong. The semi-comical villain is played by Samuel L. Jackson who, with his assistant with lethal artificial legs (Sofia Boutella), seeks to save the earth by wiping out the majority of the population. Samantha Womack and Sophie Cookson are on hand as Eggsys mother and fellow recruit respectively while Hanna Alstrm plays a Swedish princess.

Based on the 2012 comic series The Secret Service, Kingsman basically meshes the X-Men with James Bond, adding its own creative, quirky approach. Theres a lot of over-the-top and unbelievable action, but it is based on a comic, after all. The movies eccentric and generally entertaining but marred by fluent F-bombs throughout and an unnecessarily vulgar scene, which tries to be funny (and almost is). (Keep in mind that I almost never comment on cussing in a movie unless its so overdone its distracting). If you like the X-Men or James Bond youll want to check Kingsman out, but its not as good IMHO. The cast is great though and it is amusing; Im sure the sequels will improve upon the foundation.

The film runs 129 minutes and was shot in England, Toronto and Sydney, Australia.

Also a washed-out college drop out with a penchant for petty crime is selected by the most elite spy agency to be their next big thing. The plot of this movie is as believable as a 100% solid granite airplane taking off, or having any airplane held together with crazy glue instead of bolts,rivets and welding.

The spy agency is fighting a mad billionaire who found a way to control people and who wants to kill as many people as he can so that the earth would not be overcrowded.

Now, I'm not a prude. If that's your thing, well, good for you. But it's not mine.
I also get that they were trying to evoke the end of every Bond film, where James collects his reward.

They could have gone with 'We can do it any way you want to', or left it 100% implied, like the Bond movies.

6940972,4,B00S1ITA2W,"....Kingsman. For the best use of ""Free Bird"" in a full length motion picture. Not for the decapitation/dismemberment adverse crowd, but certainly enough to give Free Bird the dubious distinction of serving as background music for one of the highest deaths per second scenes in any movie I have ever seen.

6940974,2,B00S1ITA2W,"Ummmm . . . I love Colin Firth!!  I looked forward to this movie.  I also thought it was PG-13, my bad.  The first half of this movie was awesome, fun - original, and Jonno Davis was refreshingly new to me.  Then suddenly this movie turned into a horror movie, lots and lots and . . . . lots of violence!!  More then I was prepared for that day.  I can handle violence - but this movie violence had an ""indifferent"" overtone to it while they were cracking jokes with it (somewhat like pulp fiction, but this was not a drama).  It DID NOT sit well with me.  (Plus seeing my romantic star that I love and adore be this violent guy - boo hoo for me, just my opinion - I'm sure no one will agree with me, ha ha).  I really don't care who likes my opinion - this review is for the person who can't always take no nonsense violence paired comedy.  Just giving them a heads up, or be prepared so you're not caught off guard, maybe your experience will be better.  I do agree it was original, never been seen before and had an artistic flair to the movie.  It was such an indulgence of violence, I walked out in the end of movie.

6940986,2,B00S1ITA2W,"There are fun moments in this movie, but it also contains a ton of very gratuitous violence that I found cringeworthy. Sometimes a movie has enough going for it that I will overlook its bad parts, but this one doesn't really offer up anything new except an unfortunate scene at the very end that involves possible anal sex. It feels like it was tacked on last minute, and it actually makes the film seem grotesque instead of kind of fun or edgy. It's like accidentally seeing your grandparents having sex, somehow - you wish you could unsee it but you can't. It's whatever the opposite of a cherry on top is - and it spoils the whole thing.",1448668800,,640,4.432203389830509

However, as it went on it continued to get more and more ridiculous between heads exploding like fireworks and enough of the F-word to keep up with Gran Torino.

It will be worth it.

This is a clever action/comedy with awesome characters and a startling lack of sexism. I'd honestly say that most of the female characters are stronger than the male characters. The main character is not a nausea-inducing macho character. He's strong, but he doesn't put stoicism and pride before getting the job done.

It started of at a tolerable level but at about the mid point everyone turned in to gutter mouthed troll.  Cursing at key points is fine but when it turns into diatribes littered with F-Bombs and other curses it just gets old.  I wouldn't let a kid under 18 watch the movie just on those grounds alone.

Not a lot at stake here. Just another multi-million dollar slopfest for the teen boys (of all ages) to use as fodder for their impoverished fantasies of empowerment. Now, now boys, one at a time.

6941167,5,B00S1ITA2W,"Why it took my so long to write about this one is beyond me. The only honest answer I can give is the deluge of other items Ive been watching and writing about that have preoccupied me. It certainly wasn't that the film was bad, far from it. Recent news is that a sequel is in the works and thats something I cant wait to see if it holds up to this one.

The film opens with a secret agent ops in the works that results in one member of the team killed. The agent who feels responsible, Harry Hart aka Galahad (Colin Firth), stops by to pay his respect to the mans widow and leaves behind a medallion that has a number he tells her to call anytime there is a need. Fast forward to years later and the widow has taken up with a local thug, has a young child by him and the aforementioned deceased heros son has grown and hangs with the wrong crowd.

Gary Eggsy Unwin (Taron Egerton) is heading down the wrong path. With no love lost for his surrogate father and wishing he could do more for his mother he instead finds himself doing all he can to insult and anger said surrogate. His latest ends him in jail and with no one to turn to he calls the number on the back of the medallion. Harry shows and makes him an offer. He wants Eggsy to become the next member of the Kingsmen. But he must prove himself first.

Harry explains to Eggsy that the Kingsmen are a secret organization formed centuries ago that operates outside of the mainstream, untied to any government of political system. Instead their goal is to protect mankind in general. Past members have all come from high placed members of society. That is until Eggsys father. He was an experiment to quote the head of the organization Arthur (Michael Caine), an experiment begun by Harry himself. Now he wants to continue that with Eggsy, someone he feels is worthy of becoming the next knight.

With only one spot in the group open to join Eggsy finds himself in a boot camp of sorts with fellow applicants. Some welcome him like any other while the snobbish ones look down on him, a big mistake on their part. What most don't realize is Eggsys past, not just who his father was but his intelligence and the fact he served in the military. As members are booted out, it comes down to two final applicants and it is Eggsys humanity that forces him to lose.

While all of this is going on there is a megalomaniacal madman on the loose. Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) plays a lisping billionaire who has plans on taking over the world. It was his doing that opened up the position Eggsy was applying for when he killed on of the Kingsmen. Using advanced technology, Valentine has sent out free cell phones to anyone who wants one which of course means everyone. What he can do with those phones once they're in the hands of the world is something else. A final confrontation between good guys and bad must take place and of course circumstances arise that force Eggsy to be taken back in to become a member of Kingsmen.

What makes this movie work is the deft combination of humor, adventure, action and over the top madness that make it one of the best movies to come out this year. Weaving together the aristocratic world of the Kingsmen with the low class neighborhood that raised Eggsy pays off, adding a depth of character that needs less exposition as we witness both his possibilities and his capabilities. Egerton makes the character sympathetic and likeable that plays both on his world weariness and innocence in the same person. Its one of the things that makes the movie work best.

The three other major components that make the movie work begin with Colin Firth as Harry. Firth might be well known of his role in THE KINGS SPEECH but who would have expected him to carry off a role as a superspy who possibly exceeds James Bond? Alongside Firth is Mark Strong as Merlin, the armaments and tech support member of the team. Having gone through a string of roles where he plays the bad guy, Strong does an amazing job of being straight faced where a quick laugh is possible. Lastly are the effects laden weapons we see on display here, much like those of Bond in the characters numerous films. Everything from exploding cigarette lighters to bulletproof umbrellas make the arsenal of each Kingsman ready for anything.

As with Bond films the movie plays fast and loose with logistics and time zones and feels more like it was made for fun the fact. It delivers on the promise of that fun with some of the funniest moments alongside some of the most breath taking. By the end of the movie youll want to start it up and watch it again. Youll also wish that the sequel were already there ready to be viewed. For me, it is a wonderful pleasure that Ive added to my collection and one I know Ill pull out more often than not to watch and enjoy again.",1445904000,,4811,4.422121896162528

This was the worst movie ever - didn't even finish watching it. Who in the world would ever make Samuel L. Jackson speak with a lisp?

Don't get me wrong I loved Kick Ass 1 the movie but part 2 just like this movie was a bit much in some scenes. If he only knew how to dial it back a bit his appeal would broaden and therefore get more fans. Its this one thing I think he needs to work on but what do I know? Oh and you should read his comics as even though they are shocking they are AWESOME. His Ultimates was used to pitch the Avengers movie and his Authority comics for Wildstorm are awesome. Also read his creator owned stuff like Nemesis, Wanted and Superior.",1445299200,,670,4.083333333333333
6941246,5,B00S1ITA2W,"Great British actors, great action, great bad guys...this action-adventure spy movie has it all.  Yes, I love the Bond movies (especially now with Daniel Craig), but Kingsman reminded me of the good old days from the 60's when the Bond movies first came out and there were bits of sly humor mixed in with the action, plus really out-there villains.  This movie gives us that, including the girl sidekick who really can kick (and kill) with her bladed legs.

LOVED Colin Firth's character with his smart comments and attitude and the scenes where he fights are incredible to watch.  Best bit ever when he comments to a narrow-minded women in the church...I laughed out loud and then had to re-wind and watch that bit again.  I also loved the (too-short) appearance of Jack Davenport as ""Lancelot.""  All of the Kingsman characters are named after Arthurian legend and they fight the bad guys in their perfect suits with hardly a hair out of place.

The story revolves around the son (nicknamed Eggsy) of a man who dies in undergoing the Kingsman training who is then tapped himself as a would-be recruit by Galahad (Colin Firth).  He comes from a poor background where his mother is involved with a drunken thug and really has nowhere to go and a bit of an attitude issue, understandably.  Still, he wins through (of course) under the mentorship of Colin Firth's character, ""Galahad.""  This is actually one of the small flaws in the movie, that this character just wasn't quite as compelling as the others involved and I'm not sure if that was due to the script or the actor who was chosen.  It would be hard to shine as a young actor with such prestigious older actors.  Still, he did a good job and I was rooting for him, once he joined the other Kingsman agents in this perfect suit and glasses, when he was called upon to defeat the bad guy out to destroy almost everyone on the planet.

In general, this movie was really well done, the fight scenes were worthy of the Matrix nearly, and worth watching, especially if you enjoy British secret agent movies with all the smart remarks, fancy cool gadgetry, and cool calm reserve in the face of final countdowns and the end-of-the-world as we know it.",1445299200,,2200,4.639175257731959

6941319,4,B00S1ITA2W,"Move Over James Bond ....

My wife and I sat down to watch Kingsman and really didn't know what to expect but in the end really enjoyed this movie.

Kingsman is a Spy Thriller and in some ways a Parody of Bond films with a twist of Quentin Tarantino's 'Kill Bill' thrown in for fun.

The plot is typical Spy Movie thriller with your over the top Villain 'Valentine' (played by Samuel L. Jackson) wanting to dominate the world along with his henchwoman 'Gazelle' (Played by Sofia Boutella) who reminded me of the character Jaws in the Bond Films 'The Spy Who Loved Me' and 'Moonraker'.

Kingsman, like Bond, is filled with cool spy gadgets, weapons and technology. Some of the soundtrack even sounds like a Bond film.

While my wife and I enjoyed Kingsman, there are two things we didn't really enjoy
1 - Samuel L. Jackson's speech impediment. Did Valentine really need to speak with a lisp?
2 - Over the top Gratuitous Violence. Most of this movie could be watched by the whole family if the Violence was toned down a little. Kingsman does attempt to handle some of the most violent scenes in a comedic way (ie Austin Powers).

Overall Kingsman is a fun, entertaining movie for adults but just not for the kids.",1444521600,,1211,4.532110091743119

The old guard is dying off due to attrition. A new crop of recruits will be needed to fill their mission. Can a rambunctious upstart Eggsy (Taron Egerton) be the one?

We watch the selection process while all the time keeping an eye out for bad guys and nasty deeds.

It is a tad over done with potty mouth. However this can be overlooked.",1444521600,,535,4.670212765957447
6941323,5,B00S1ITA2W,"Drunk'n review. I laughed. I laughed some more. There was a plot. And there were action scenes that revolved around that plot. It was fun to watch those action scenes. There were  scenes that expanded on the plot. Some of those scenes were funny; some were not. But on the whole those scenes helped explained the plot in such a way that any idiot will be able to understand what is going on. Because I was able to understand what was going on, my enjoyment of this light hearted spoof on spy films was elevated and I felt smarter than I really am. Good job Hollywood. That is my review for this film. Please rent (or buy) this film and get the same enjoyment that I got out of it. Thank you, and good day",1444521600,,704,4.214814814814815
6941324,1,B00S1ITA2W,"Not to sound like my parents, but if you want to fully understand violence in America, then please, by all means, check out this POS film called Kingsman: The Secret Service, which is offensive on just about every level imaginable. This is why kids are taking guns and killing other people--because they are exposed to a culture of violence on the screen that seems to get worse with each movie. Game of Thrones is a walk in the park compared to this unbelievably bad movie.  There are two sequences in particular when hundreds of people die, a sequence where human head after human head explodes for our entertainment value.

Also, there is the subplot of the 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8 young people all vying for the slot of the next Kingsman. Isn't it interesting that ALL OF THEM ARE WHITE????  Holy Crap, it's 2015, but you wouldn't know it from this movie.

And the ending......a woman showing her rear end as she prepares to have the promised anal sex with our hero?????????  And this was co-written by a woman????????

While having some strange brilliance behind the ideas and concepts,  often it is confusing, awkward, and offensive lacking an identity and instead coming across as British hipster flick.

Samuel L Jackson's character was pretty weird but endearingly evil and funny at the same time.  You'll have to see it for yourself, and I highly recommend you take the time to do so.

6941450,2,B00S1ITA2W,"Started out fun, and Colin Firth looked like he was having a blast playing an action hero. The main character was just okay, though it's probably hard to hold your own against the likes of Colin Firth, Michael Caine, and Mark Strong (who played a different character than I'm used to but I always like him.)

By the way, all the women in here sucked. There weren't many and they had crap roles. Apparently even a woman tough enough to get into Kingsman training has to spend the whole movie quivering in her boots, being rescued, and being, at best, only marginally effective in her job.

Samuel Jackson phoned it in and his (female) sidekick was a cardboard cut out.

Hyper gore I've got no problem with in a comic book movie. I loved the church scene. The ending, though, was too hard to believe even by comic book standards and out-of-the-blue troglodyte sexist ending was really jarring in it's incongruity and vulgarity. It's like the last 20 minutes of the film had been handed to a 12 year old boy to direct.

6941485,5,B00S1ITA2W,"My son and I were talking movies the other day, and at one point we agreed that the James Bond films of late have sadly strayed so very far from their solid roots.  Particularly since Daniel Craig has donned the tuxedo of the once debonaire 007.  No offense to Craig as an actor, but in the role of Bond he seems very off the mark.  Craigs  is a dry, brooding, angy, and persistently serious portrayal, with none of the suave cockiness of Lazenby, Connery or Brosnon.  And the antagonists presented to us are neither creatively bad nor made humorously over the top, but rather cookie cutter dull.  To be fair, it is equally the fault of depressingly dramatic writers and directors of late as well.

The older Bond films clicked.  They were action and spy adventure, but never took themselves too seriously.  And there were the cliche moments in each that characterize Bond:  gadgets with Q, flirting with Money-Penny, surviving a series of preposterously dangerous moments with flair, dealing with a farcical bad guy who, admit it, had the coolest evil lair, and the end curtain falling on our man Bond smooching with the alluring siren of the film.

So where do we find a film that harkens to the Bond of oldI say that Kingsman: The Secret Service hits the target squarely.  Kingsman draws heavily on the tried, true, and beloved genre classics like the playful The Avengers TV series from the late 60s, Our Man Flit of 1967, Dujardins OSS:117, and of course Connerys Bond.

Colin Firth and Taron Egerton put in superb performances that reignite the lightness and action of the classic campy spy flick; the proper English gentleman spy, who looks good in a suit while dealing with a hundred armed foes.  Samuel Jackson plays the ultra extreme bad guy environmentalist (sadly an over the top cliche that nowadays hinders progress on real climate issues), and Jacksons lispy portrayal creates a cartoon character that jars us out of the fantasy of the story at times.  Even Michael Cane is a bit of an empty parody of himself in this film.  But Firth and Egerton, along with well done supporting roles from Mark Strong and Sofia Boutella, keep us rooted in the magic of each moment.

Overall, Kingsman is a rewarding and welcome offering.  Mature, refined, while also campy and predictable, it is filled with familiar moments that satisfy as the story and action unfolds.  Kingsman: The Secret Service is what future Bond films should strive to return to.  But until then, enjoy this good flick, an homage to our favorite spy filled movie nights.",1443312000,,2545,4.767123287671233
6941486,3,B00S1ITA2W,"This was a really bad movie.  The only reason why I give it three stars is because the action sequences were actually very interestingly done.  I'm surprised because the actors were awesome, and the script wasn't horrible.  It's just that it made no sense.  I didn't fully get what motivated the characters to  be in the secret society in the first place, nor did I understand some of those scenes in the movie SPOILER ALERT:  One of the main characters shoots up a church filled with bigoted haters because he doesn't like what they stand for.  I mean another superhero movie, like Watchman had some dark moments in the movie, but the script was on point.  You understood what motivated every single character every step of the way.

6941491,5,B00S1ITA2W,It's good. The writers put a clever spin on what would have otherwise been just another regurgitation of a Bond flick.,1443312000,,118,4.666666666666667

6941500,1,B00S1ITA2W,"This is a movie written by sick mind of Hollywood. Colin Firth, Michael Caine, and Samuel L. Jackson stooped to an all-time low by being in this movie. From the mindless massacres to the misogynistic treatment of women, this vapid and gratuitously violent movie fails at its goal of being a clever, over the top Bond satire.",1443225600,4,324,4.701754385964913
6941501,4,B00S1ITA2W,"It's sure to be a cult classic.  Samuel L. Jackson's character makes the movie, in my opinion.  With the lisp, the baseball hat, and the v-neck sweaters, he sounds and looks a lot like a well-known hip hop mogul (if the mogul lost his way and went mental).",1443225600,,256,4.3125

6941512,4,B00S1ITA2W,The movie in a lot of ways is ridiculous. The premise to fight for an open spot at the table for another spot in what seems like an endless list of  British Secret agencies is pretty cool. Add in extreme high tech that is a lot of fun. Some bizarre scenes are inserted. Adding in a insane arch nemesis who is trying to to create Moonraker on earth this has referential points to so many spy movies. It is far fetched enough to be pretty funny. Parody perhaps? Not sure but ok fun.,1443225600,3,480,4.161290322580645

***SPOILER ALERT**
My question is when did it become ok to murder a whole bunch of people because they are bigoted? Have we become that politically correct? Do we really excuse a main character for that kind of slaughter by saying, ""Welp they deserved it. They were bigoted, racist and homophobic""?

It had some very fun references to other not mentioned spy movies that are out there, again, more cute than distracting or annoying.
There is a scene in the movie where you put a super spy against a lot of normal people and it was everything that I'd dream it would have been. That part though gory, was down right awesome.

6941622,1,B00S1ITA2W,"Amazon's feed was excellent.  However that is all that ws good about this film.  Whom ever put it together overly relied on the assumption that it will generate profit based on having three reputable actors.  However this film is an example of bad directing, poor camera and lighting work, terrible storyline setup, audience selection, use of computer graphics, use of action, use of shock value and introduction of younger performers.  In addition, the execution is but one clitche over another over another over yet another clitche.  This film is not salvable and over relied in prior films coming out of the Commonwealth that indeed were instant classics due to their highquality and originality.",1442534400,5,699,5.150442477876106

It is little more than gratuitous, graphic violence that is sickening in its scope.  Although it offers well known actors Jackson, Caine and Firth, the story and scenes are not worthy of them.  If it were not so disturbing, it would border on comical, but the movie is generally depraved while wearing a faade of sophistication.",1442448000,11,447,4.828947368421052

They were at the end and involved a gratuitous vulgar declaration by the ""Princess"" regarding the hero's ""reward."" Had the movie been a bit more ""Bond-like"" in it's sexiness, the scenes would not have been so jarring--but there was nothing else in the movie that lead up to them. They were just inserted (pardon the pun) for no apparent reason.

Action sequences feature that crazy-unrealistic-stylized violence that seems to be all the rage these days. In addition, gory killings are frequent, as are ""f-bombs"". The whole plot makes almost no sense. The evildoer's plans aren't the kind of thing any real people would consent to (though quite a few movie characters do). The protagonist doesn't even end up with the ""right"" love interest. Oh, and for good measure, a raunchy sex reference is tossed in near the end - just the thing you want your kids to be hearing (NOT).

6941758,4,B00S1ITA2W,"What a cast! Good dialogue, twisty plot, amazing stunts, marvelous baddie with best hench(wo)man since Oddjob - a real top of the line spy movie, with one caveat.  One star off for excessive violence - Yes, it's a spy movie, in that genre people inevitably get killed all over the place. That's par for the course, no objection here. BUT there is an *extended* sequence of wholesale slaughter in a ""church"" that would make Sam Peckinpah gag. The victims are nasty people, and a scene of this sort was necessary as an illustration of what would happen if the villain wasn't stopped, but the editor let this run on and on and ON and ON to the point that takes one out of the story, seems creepily to assume the audience would enjoy the mayhem, and that violent, violent death is somehow AOK if it happens to people with horrible opinions. Unlike the people who were actively participating in the bad guy's genocidal project (killed quickly later in the movie), they were just hateful jerks.  Graphic, realistic, endless - choreographed blood porn, it was a total needle scratch in such an excellent movie.  What does that say?
Maybe it's clear how much this disrupted the flow of the movie when I interrupt a rave for so long to comment on it.  Be warned that's in there, but if you can get past that, it's the best action/gadget/boo megalomaniacal villain/yay good guys/international secret service movie since Classic Connery ruled the screen.",1441843200,5,1443,4.76

The film actually has a surprising amount of depth to it, including one scene with the young protagonist ""Eggsy"" that's really incredible. Colin Firth is a very smooth superspy, Taron Egerton is a loveably rogueish, identifiable, and caring hero, Sofia Boutella (actually a dancer) plays a fearsome villainess, and Samuel L. Jackson is at the top of his game again as a threatening and surprisingly hilarious supervillian.

6941896,4,B00S1ITA2W,Fun movie that is worth the watch.  It is not Shakespeare - and with the decades of spy movies preceding it -  it is hard to make the plot surprising.  That being said it was able to keep me on the edge of seat and was very entertaining.  Why I gave it 4 and not 5 stars was because of the accent of one of the main characters - it made understanding what was being said hard at times.,1441411200,,385,3.8354430379746836

Kingsman scores reasonably well on a fun factor scale. The performances are fine; the pace is good; the special effects are acceptable. The story is predictable and the absence of dramatic tension makes Kingsman eye candy more than absorbing drama. I don't have any problem with that. It is what it is, and what it is is a solid 4 star movie. It doesn't try to be anything more, which is why it doesn't deserve 5 stars, but if you want to watch entertaining action that won't tax your brain, Kingsman is a good choice.",1441065600,,723,4.561538461538461

1) a bit of Get Smart, although its much more intelligent than that (and I loved Get Smart when I was a kid);

With that said, most movies these days seem to betray a lack of science and technology understanding, and this movie was no exception.  There were just too many high-tech cringe moments for me to give it four stars.

[Spoiler alert]

You're probably thinking I'm going to complain about the implants.  Nope.  Those are semi-plausible, though they wouldn't be nearly that tiny.  And the gadgets are a little dubious, but I'm okay with suspension of disbelief.  Where this story went off the rails was in its incorporation of real world tech.

The main plot involved a villain using custom SIM cards to put a sizable percentage of all the world's cell phones onto a special network, and then delivering an auditory signal that makes people go nuts and kill each other.  I'll ignore for the moment the unlikelihood of that being possible (suspension of disbelief again), and I'll ignore the unlikelihood of cell phones being loud enough to do so on such a broad scale.  But I just can't bring myself to ignore the satellites....

The most egregious problem with the satellites was the scene in which they used two weather balloons to lift a girl up high enough to shoot down a satellite with a shoulder-fired missile.  A quick Wikipedia search reveals that the highest altitude ever recorded by a weather balloon was only about 53 km (33 miles).  Another quick Wikipedia search tells you that low Earth orbit starts at about 160 miles (but isn't really usable at such a low altitude).  So in the best-case scenario, the girl would have been trying to aim at a satellite around 110 km (68 miles) above her.  In fact, she'd only be about 2030% closer while hanging under the balloons than she would be if she were standing atop the tallest mountain on the surface of Earth....

Worse, I'm fairly certain it isn't even theoretically possible to build a balloon that could lift a person to low Earth orbit, because the lift capacity of a balloon decreases very rapidly with altitude, falling to almost nothing by the time you get to 30 km or so; the lift from a balloon is caused by the difference in air density between the inside of the balloon and the outside, and when you're that high up, there's very little air at all, so it is very hard for the density inside to be significantly lower than nearly zero.  In fact, the record altitude for a human-flown balloon is only 41 km.  Exceeding that altitude record by a factor of four or five would be bordering on insanity.

Speaking of lift capacity, two weather balloons would have a typical lift capacity of 1020 pounds even at sea level, which isn't enough to lift my backpack, much less an entire person with a giant missile launcher strapped to her back.  She would likely need closer to 30-50 of them just to get off the ground.  Two isn't even in the ballpark.

And even if you could miraculously get a balloon high enough, you would quickly run into an even bigger problem.  Orbital velocity is fast.  Really fast.  That same Wikipedia article on low Earth orbit tells you just how fast.  A satellite at the very bottom of low Earth orbit goes all the way around the planet in approximately 90 minutes (88, to be precise).  That means it goes from the North Pole to the Equator in approximately 22.5 minutes, or from the northern border of the United States (not counting the northeastern states) to the southern border (not counting the tip of Texas) in about 6 1/2 minutes.  In the two minutes or so that it took her to aim the missile, the satellite she was trying to hit would have travelled about 600 miles.  That's somewhere in the neighborhood of 17,000 miles (27,000 km) per hour, or 7.8 km (4.8 miles) per second, for those of you keeping score.

Ignoring the question of whether somebody could aim at a target moving that quickly (even if it were moving almost straight towards you), does anybody know how to build a shoulder-fired missile that can fly at 17,000 MPH (about Mach 50)?  Because if you do, I'm sure NASA would love to talk to you.  :-)

Of course, there is a kind of satellite that doesn't move relative to Earth.  Those are celled geostationary satellites.  Unfortunately, to get to those, you'd need a weather balloon that would lift a person up to 35,786 km (22,236 miles)almost 700x higher than any balloon has ever flown.  Even if it were theoretically possible, building such a balloon would probably require orders of magnitude more hydrogen and helium than exists on our planet, and the balloon would probably start out at hundreds of miles in diameter or more.

Also, if you somehow pulled off such an impossible feat getting her back down without the benefit of gravity pulling on her in any meaningful way would be highly problematic.  After all, the reason those satellites stay up there is that gravity doesn't do much at that distance.  And if you somehow managed to solve those two problems, she'd probably burn up on the way back down.  There's a reason we don't ever attempt to recover satellites from geostationary orbit.  It just isn't practical.  And this is assuming that such a purely theoretical balloon would somehow exhibit enough atmospheric drag to keep you above the same point on Earth on an ongoing basis, effectively accelerating you to about 3 km/s during your ascent, which seems pretty unlikely.

Of course, that's all a moot point, because satellites can't possibly carry a signal to unmodified cell phones in the first place.  Any cell phone that uses SIM cards for voice communication is likely to be using GSM, which has a 35 km (22 mile) range limit that cannot be exceeded without completely redesigning the way that the devices communicate at a fundamental level.  Low Earth orbit satellites orbit starts at 160 km (99 miles).  So even if you could magically convince a satellite to communicate on the right frequency, the time division algorithm in the cell phones would make communication impossible.  Ah, but what about LTE, you might ask?  That has a hard upper limit of 103 km for establishing an initial connection.  So that can't work, either.  The only cellular protocol that *might* be able to pull off communication at that distance (I'm not sure) is CDMA, but CDMA doesn't use SIM cards.

Also, there's the problem of it being infeasible to replace cellular tech with satellite tech because of insufficient availability of spectrum.  Cellular phones broadcast omnidirectionally, requiring fairly directional receivers, which isn't practical at LEO altitudes, at least when the devices are transmitting with the miniscule amount of power that modern cell phones can generate.  And you would need several satellites just to cover the U.S.  (For example, the Iridium constellation consists of 66 satellites.)  That's just one of many reasons that satellite phones use entirely different communication hardware, and cost an enormous amount of money to use.

Finally, even from the perspective of the ground, I suspect that satellites in low Earth orbit would be moving way too quickly for cellular phones to connect to them.  If you could somehow get past the distance limits, you'd still have the speed limit (250 km/hr or 155 MPH for GSM, 350 km/hr or 217 MPH for LTE).  The nature of time division multiplexing requires devices to do their transmitting and receiving within specified time intervals, and there are limits to how far the devices can adjust those time intervals.  Changing those limits would require significant changes to the protocols, which translates ""custom cell phones"".  That's why high-speed trains have their own cellular sites on the trains themselves, and use specially modified hardware to exchange data with specially modified base stations using a nonstandard cellular protocol.  And that's not even taking into account the doppler shift problem, which becomes significant at 17,000 MPH.

While I'm at it, I should also add that it typically takes many days to bring a spare satellite into position unless you expend insane amounts of fuel to shift one satellite at altitude into the orbital plane of another.  That part was kind of implausible.  Then again, the notion that taking out a single satellite in a constellation (a group of satellites working together) would have any real impact on the operation of the constellation as a whole is also wrong.  In fact, you could take out potentially one or more satellites in each of a constellation's orbital planes (the circle in which a group of satellites travels) without having any impact at all on actual satellite phones, so long as adjacent missing satellites weren't near the same latitude at the same time.  The only way taking out a single satellite would ever matter would be if you were dealing with geostationary satellites, and again, you're not going to get a balloon that high.  You couldn't even get the Space Shuttle that high.  (620 km was its record, which is only about a sixtieth as high as those satellites.)  In fact, as far as I know, we've never recovered anything from that altitude other than the Apollo moon missions....

So please, Hollywood, if you're going to use real technology, please, please, please use it in ways that could actually be plausible.  We do notice.",1440806400,,9268,4.83936507936508

Why can't they leave the politics out of the movies, and just entertain us?  Colin Firth is a really good actor, but this movie was a bad pick for him.  It started out okay, then began to have strings of violence that were both silly and grotesque.  I never liked Samuel Jackson much anyway, but he's really bad in this.

The actions sequences are well done. Some of the special effects are nice. However, this movie attempted to jump the bandwagon a bit early. The script was rushed, the story suffered and it seemed too disjointed and lacked a good, cohesive story.

This film had so much potential, with some very good actors and a storyline that could have worked--evin as a ""fun"" movie without much solid substance.  Instead of even attempting to fulfill the potential of all of the fine actors and the budget for great special effects, this movie reveals that the maximum effort was made to trash every one of those benefits.  I wish I could have not just the money back that I wasted on this piece of dung, but also the precious 2 hours of time that I can never retrieve.",1440460800,2,543,4.520408163265306

Honestly, the bad language is so overused, you get the impression the director required scriptwriters to meet a quota.  This movie treats violence and murder in an almost slapstick fashion.  There's a good 5 minute long scene of Colin Firth just butchering people in a church with guns, knives, candlesticks, broken shafts of wood, explosives, etc. The final scene of the movie has one of the characters offering anal sex to the protagonist if he can save the world. He does the save the world, then RUNS to the woman's room to sodomize her.  That's literally the closing scene of the movie.  Overall, movie was unoriginal, crude, and disappointing.

Bond need not fear this as real competition, even though it traffics in the same snob appeal circle.

6942335,1,B00S1ITA2W,"Yuck.  The premise of the movie was good - Pygmalion transformation of a wayward teenager into a gentleman spy -  yet it was ruined by the gratuitous violence and the out of character ending for the hero.  After building the character of the hero/Egerton throughout the film (he won't shoot his dog, he protects his mom, he bonds with Roxy), his first thought after saving the world, is to have sex with some random girl? What?

The worst was the over-the-top violence which left my stomach in a knot by the end of the movie - who finds hundreds of people murdered in slow motion funny? Had more focus been on developing the Firth/Egerton bond and Egerton's transformation and less on violence , it could have been a great flick.",1440201600,3,729,4.584615384615384

This movie was grotesquely violent, and not even in a necessary-for-the-plot sort of way, but in a ""hey, isn't killing people in graphical slow-motion fun!"" kind of way.  Musical mass-murder montages, exploding heads, and other such crap.  I really regret that I sat through it  I thought about quitting several times, but kept hoping that there would be something at the end that made it all worthwhile.  Nope.  The end was even worse than the middle (which was about as bad as the beginning).  I regret the 90 minutes of my life I wasted on this, and I sincerely wish there were some way I could un-see it.

I recall seeing this movie heavily marketed but wasn't overly excited about another cookie-cutter spy adventure movie. Although, I was bored one night and decided to give it a chance. This was a fantastic movie despite being just like every other spy adventure.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Kingsman: The Secret Service is a slam-bang action film about British Secret Agents that is deliriously shaken, but not stirred and has fantastic spy gadgets via the super sophisticate suave Harry Hart [Colin Firth] and his best role in years, who is unleashed in this super awesome spy thriller film. Caught between straight-up James Bond and the [silly stupid] Austin Powers parody version, Kingsman: The Secret Service is an awesome super adrenaline high-octane combo of action and comedy, that breathes sweet and surreal new life into the big-screen spy game where James Bond meets Jason Bourne and Jack Bauer. Adapted from Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons' 2012 comic book series and directed by Matthew Vaughn with the same anything-goes ingenuity, that brought us Kick Ass, Kingsman is all over the place that is to be expected in high octane action film. But you won't want to miss the surprises it delights in springing you forth before your eyes.

In a role that fits him like a bespoke suit, Colon Firth is everything you want in an international man of mystery. He is a suave British agent Harry Hart, code-named Galahad, and plays by the rules of a company, headed by Arthur [Sir Michael Caine], that names its agents after Knights of the Round Table.  Since Lancelot [Jack Davenport] died saving Galahad's ass 17 years ago, Galahad resolves to return the favour by recruiting Lances now grown up son, Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin [Taron Egerton], gets recruited into the secret service. The thing is Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin is a bit of an uncouth lout, a street kid who seems destined for prison, instead of the elegant environs of the Kingsman, where a swank tailoring shop on Saville Row that fronts for the Secret Service.

Got that? Now add the posh young recruits that include Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin who must vie to achieve a place at the table. My advice is to just jump into the action and go with it. That's what Matthew Vaughn does. And with the opening scene, a flashback, introduces Richmond Valentine, a big-bucks super-villain played to the hilt and beyond by a lisping hammed up gloriously Samuel L. Jackson with a cruel streak Goldfinger would envy. Richmond Valentine has a gal Friday named Gazelle [Sofia Boutella] whose prosthetic legs are tipped with lethal blades and the film is loaded with lots of in [British] jokes, and amazingly we get a cameo performance from an unrecognisable Mark Hamill [Star Wars] and also a brilliant Bond villain from Samuel L. Jackson. Newbie Taron Egerton who really holds his own with a cast of professional actors and I loved his twist on a 007 martini ""gin poured while glancing at an unopened bottle of vermouth."" I could go on. The awesome film sure lets hell ride the waves, with Matthew Vaughn and co-writer Jane Goldman throwing grenades into the plot every chance they get. The big set piece, and it's a wowzer, involves a church massacre provoked by lethal SIM cards that Valentine [Samuel L. Jackson] installs in all mobile phones around the world.

With its Camelot references and Bond parallels, the film pays lavish homage to British mythology, although Galahads immaculate tailoring and furled (but lethal) umbrella reminded me even more of another fictional hero: Patrick Macnees John Steed, of TV series The Avengers. And if a shaken-not-stirred cocktail of Bond, The Avengers and the Knights of the Round Table weren't enough, there is also a nod to Harry Potter, as Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin goes to spy school to see which of he and his fellow pupils, all frightfully posh, is good enough to be anointed the new Lancelot. There are lots of sound reasons to see this film, not least Colin Firth, who embraces the parody with huge relish while showing us that he might just be the best Bond we never had. And young Taron Egerton is absolutely totally brilliant and terrific. Several scenes I really loved are and one of them is the orgiastic melee of killing in a U.S. church and the other was when everyones heads blow up with the rousing British music of Land of Hope and Glory, which is definitely made for over-excited pleasure in my estimation and I gather was actually toned down to gain a British and Irish 15 certificate, and there is also in the film there is lots of cleverly choreographed set-pieces, dagger-sharp dialogue, and even the odd nugget of philosophy. Becoming a gentleman, Harry Hart, code-named Galahad [Colin Firth] tells Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin [Taron Egerton], it is not about which school you went to or how you hold your cutlery: It is about being at ease in ones own skin. Even when everything stops making sense, Kingsman: The Secret Service is unstoppable lots of gratuitous over the top fun.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The films 2.40:1 theatrical aspect ratio is offered with an awesome gorgeous reference quality 1080p transfer image. Sharpness remains consistently brilliant throughout with hair textures and those handsome costumes by Arianne Phillips showing a remarkable amount of detail. The colour is rich and solid with believable and appealing skin tones. Contrast has been consistently applied to get the most out of the exquisite photography while black levels are quite inky with startling shadow detail.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The awesome 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround sound mix is totally perfect for this kind of an action-filled extravaganza with split effects appearing throughout which maximize gunfire, fighting, explosions, and the like in every quadrant of the sound field. Both Henry Jackman and Matthew Margeson have provided awesome music, which gets the full surround experience, and theres directional led dialogue sprinkled throughout, though most of the well-recorded dialogue has been placed in the centre channel.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Theatrical Trailer [2015] [1080p] [2.39:1] [2:22] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for Kingsman: The Secret Service.

Finally, the cast are all superb with Colin Firth leading the line exceptionally well. Its hard to imagine that anyone could have tackled this role with quite the same levels of stiff-upper-lipped awesomeness. He also shares a wonderful chemistry with up-and-comer Taron Egerton, a young man who has super-stardom beckoning. After a strong side role in Testament of Youth, Egerton handles his first major lead role with all the charisma and style you could hope for. Taron Egerton and Colin Firth make an excellent on-screen duo, but what a shame Colin Firth would not appear if there was a follow up film, as he was brilliant and I hope there will be a follow up film. The rest of the film is full of remarkable supporting actors too. Mark Strong, Jack Davenport and Sophie Cookson delight whilst Samuel L. Jackson and Sofia Boutella serve up some truly fresh, original villains. And of course a very surprising performance from Star Wars legend Mark Hamill has a pivotal cameo and who else could play the head of the Kingsman quite like our national treasure Sir Michael Caine. Kingsman: The Secret Service guarantees a perfect night in. It entertains throughout and proves that big budget action-adventures can be made in the UK. Colin Firth and Taron Egerton are totally sublime together, with the story playfully paying homage to the legacy of James Bond. It is very stylish, funny and quintessentially English. Kingsman: The Secret Service is the first must-see action film of 2015, so much so I watched a second viewing the same evening, that is how good it is and gets a brilliant 5 star rating. Very Highly Recommended!

It's like a John Woo film but way more graphic and I hope this type of violence does not become the norm. Really pissed about that Mom almost hacking her baby daughter scene. As a Dad to a 5 month old, I'm disgusted and want to make it clear that putting something like that in a film will get a laugh out of the douf, but any parent will be hurt to their core.

6942615,2,B00S1ITA2W,"I could have really liked Kingsman. despite the over-the-top violence. What ruined it for me was the end where after saving the world our young hero who has supposedly proven himself as a gentleman spy is promised anal sex by the Princess of some Scandinavian country and his only goal becomes getting back to her to have sex. It shows her bare-assed waiting for him. It ended on a note totally demeaning to women, even tho his beautiful teen-girl spy buddy who also braved unimaginable odds to save the world could have reunited with him to celebrate their victory, and might have made this all into a happy, funny, triumphant finale that made sense.  Instead it lost all its value to me as both comedy and spy flick, because whoever wrote the script had some weird bad boy fantasy that didn't even seem congruent with our fearless (good-hearted) hero's modus operandi. Yes its sort of funny in places, but it has poor pacing especially at the end, and its like all the very distinguished cast got trashed on some weird designer drugs, and trashed the film too.  Oh, and the super-villian lisp thing.....so been there done that. Yes I know its a parody, but it also could have been classic in a good sense, and not just in the style of ""Snakes on a Plane"".

6942639,5,B00S1ITA2W,"Kingsman does for the spy genre what Kick Ass did for the superhero one.  It's sort of a mixture of a teen growing up in poverty with deadbeat parent/step parent given an opportunity to escape all that, if he's committed and up to it genre (such as Ender's Game), combined with the fun gadgets as weapons spy/secret organisation film genre (such as obviously the bond films).  Kingsman has a great villain played by Samuel L Jackson, (although I don't think the speech impediment added anything to the film, it was actually quite annoying), with a fairly unique motivation and one that is actually plausible as an I'm going to the end the world motivation, for someone if they had his resources.  Kingsman is predictable, especially the whole training to see who will be the replacement spy part of the story, you know who's going to win that when the characters are introduced, you can see the twist coming in each challenge, and when there's been a bit of a body count from more and more agents, you wonder why they don't just take the top couple of students anyway, since they went to all the effort of training them.  But that doesn't mean those parts of the film aren't a fun visual experience.

Colin Firth, who would have thought he'd make a cool spy or could pull off choreographed fight scenes against multiple opponents?  I haven't had this much fun with a spy film since I watched If Looks Could Kill when I was a kid back in 1991.

Well-cast, well-acted, especially enjoyed Colin Firth in the amazing lead role.
If you enjoy spy films done on a high caliber, w/an inborn sense of humor along w/ the mayhem, I think it's safe to say you'll enjoy this.
Someone has complained about the use of F-bombs. I don't recall this, so I guess either I'm inured or it wasn't disruptive to the flow of the film.
Normally I'm sensitive to its unnecessary usage.
a couple of caveats -- Samuel L Jackson's lisp is annoying, and the last scene was unnecessary and unexpected -- others have commented on it, so I will leave it at that.
But other than those two issues, as someone else has said -- James Bond in the style of ""Kick Ass,"" with a side of Harry Potter, w/some foul language.",1439251200,,896,4.6415094339622645

It is a British teen angst movie, but the adult characters are trying to uplift the main teen character and help him with his skills instead of the teen going against ""the man"", like American teen movies.

6942752,3,B00S1ITA2W,"Attempting to recall the British secret service films that 007 inspired, this updated version is also clearly influenced by video gaming culture. The protagonist is young, the violence in sort of a post-Tarintino way, is boundless.  An amazing amount of pummeled dead bodies fill the screen -  many, killed in very interesting, highly stylized ways.  I suppose it's all part of a thrill ride of a movie which keeps upping everything except logic as it careens to its finale. Colin Firth and Michael Caine make it watchable, even interesting.

6942791,5,B00S1ITA2W,"What a ride! This was entertainment at it's best, a kind of James Bond meets Kill Bill meets Harry Potter. The premise is simple: Eggsy, the main younger character, and a talented yet troubled youth of sorts is invited to try out for the Kingsmen. The first part of the movie is primarily training, interaction with the inevitable entitled bullies, etc. Of course, there is a mentor, played by Colin Firth, who is absolutely amazing in this role - stiff upper lip and all, but who does let his emotional side come through occasionally in his interactions with young Eggsy as he learns and grows.

No spy movie is complete without a super villain intent on world domination, and Samuel L Jackson plays this to the hilt, along with being quite squeamish about blood and violence. His outfits alone are worth watching.

This entire movie feels like an homage to the spy movies of the past, with top notch acting, believable character interactions, and some incredible frolicking fight scenes.",1438992000,,989,4.846153846153846

6942799,4,B00S1ITA2W,"a strange but enjoyable mix of Bond-style hokum which seems to be aimed at teens but the language and sexual references are very 'adult' which of course will appeal to teens and also non-prudish adults! To assess whether you'll like the humor, and understand why the language is so fruity, you should check out who co-wrote it - Jane Goldman, partner of Jonathan Ross (for US readers he's an irreverent British tv talent, who is usually pretty funny and close to the bone, for example he described Nigella Lawson in one of his chat shows as a MILF.) Goldman also co-wrote Kick-Ass so if you liked that you'll like this. Anyhow I digress. Good quality stars all playing predictably well within their range, and (spoiler) they all get killed off, which is sort of refreshing. The fight scenes are stylish (previous reference to Kill Bill in another review was spot on) and the female baddie Gazelle, side-kick of Samuel L Jackson's Bond villain, is an original.",1438992000,,959,4.783132530120482

While away on vacation, friends recommended this movie to us so I rented it on Amazon for viewing via the Amazon Instant Video app.  Connected the iPad to the Samsung TV at the vacation rental via HDMI, started the movie, but only got sound, no picture.  So, we instead found something on Netflix and watched it via the same connection without problems.  Then watched something on HBO GO with the same connection, again with no problems.  Went back to the Amazon Instant Video app, but, as before, no picture.

Now, back from vacation, the Amazon Instant Video app works when connecting the iPad to my Sony TV at home via HDMI, but the rental period for this movie has expired.  Why is this app more finicky than others regarding connectivity?  Is there a way to ""return"" an unsuccessfully viewed instant movie for a refund?  Or at least a way to restart the clock?",1438992000,,958,4.517441860465116

And Samuel L. Jackson delivered one of the worst performances of his career.  A complete and total waste of money and time.

6942974,4,B00S1ITA2W,"After putting if off for months, I finally took the plunge on Kingsman. Bottom line, in the realm of action entertainment, this is superior to most similar films on the strength of how imaginative it is visually and how it maximizes the fun. 007 really is your grandparents' spy compared to this. Great cast, several exciting set pieces and some terrific sequence of music into the action. The girl with the blade legs is fantastic, and it's cool to see Mark Hamill in something other than Star Wars.

The things that kept me from seeing Kingsman in the theater were what I had read about its crassness and its gruesome violence. Now having watched it, I can say that neither is as off-putting as I had anticipated. On the whole, there is definitely some blood but less gore than you might expect--many of the deaths are stylized--and outside of a few lines and jokes, the tone is agreeable. If you imagine a less philosophical, more emotional version of Matthew Vaughn's X-Men: First Class, one that enjoys getting its hands a little dirty, then you have the idea.",1438560000,,1065,4.695187165775401

Whoa! If you think that you would enjoy a new take on a James Bond kind of cinematography, you'll like this film.

I watched this movie because I heard the action in it was excellent.  To me, the action was the worst part of the film.  It seemed even more unbelievable and over the top than action in a Bond film.  The graphics of people exploding truly looked like something I've seen a 14 year old create on his Apple computer.  Now, I know movies are heavy into CGI and stuff but usually, it actually looks like something is being blown up.  Not the computer generated fire/explosions that were in this movie.  And then to make that seem like fireworks going off?  Really?  And the soundtrack? Just ridiculous.  I spent $5 to rent this movie based on the recommendations of co-workers.

6943038,1,B00S1ITA2W,"We are huge fans of Colin Firth and Michael Caine...so we had to rent this...The result is this movie has made it to our top ten WORST movie list. We tried to overlook the unnecessary and abundant use of foul language...what is with using the f-word in everyday vernacular I will never understand? But then the plot line...geez...Are there no good writers left in Hollywood? To treat human life as so expendable is a sad testament of our culture...this is like watching a bad video game with exploding heads as the finale show. #ridiculous #gross ---Frankly, the movie's premise was a good one --a James bond knock off with some matrix moves added for flavor...but the writers, who I assume to be men given the foul language and the a-hole offer by the princess, really should quit their day jobs! If you are cultured and have any sense of propriety, you will find this movie distasteful. If you cannot say the word propriety or you don't know what it means, well then there is no hope for you and you probably will like this flick. But I say, Don't waste your money on such a foul action movie, Bond knock off.

Like many secret agent movies you expect to see some violence even the occasional clever way to 'dispatch' a villian, however this movie is just over the top in the way is included excessive and unnecessary violence. There is a scene in a church which goes for for about 5 minutes in which one of the characters must kill about 50 people in a wide variety of ways (often in slow motion). It's really a shame they put in that much violence because I believe it would have been a better movie if they toned down the violence a bit and played up the characterization - doing so would have allowed for a better overall film and a wider audience.

I would have given it 2 stars except if it were not for the use of the F-Word. The actors must have been paid per word.  I am no prude, but it was excessive.",1438214400,,395,3.8271604938271606

6943149,1,B00S1ITA2W,"So disappointed in this movie.  It had such a promising premise, but the constant foul language (were they trying to set a record for how many F-bombs they could shove into a single movie?), the overwhelmingly gratuitous and unnecessary gore, and the negative and hateful stereotyping of various of people ruined it.

Also, the end where the girl rolls over to show the hero her bare behind in preparation for anal sex was a turn off. Totally inappropriate.

6943182,1,B00S1ITA2W,"movie started off pretty good, and then just went completely downhill for me.  The extreme violence was uninteresting and went on for ever.  It wasn't funny, or inventive, it was just excessive and boring to be honest.  The ""evil"" plot was pretty hokey, and probably would have worked better as the plot of an Austin Powers sequel.  Absolutely hated this movie by the end.",1438214400,,372,4.765625

6943193,5,B00S1ITA2W,"One of the best films I've seen in a while. A spy movie that's badass, hilarious, and a bit meta. The actors are great. Colin firth should consider more action films after this one. Samuel L. Jackson's villain was someone you knew was evil but couldn't completely hate. Lastly Taron Egerton (the main character in the movie who sadly isn't credited on the cover) was fantastic and will hopefully star in more blockbuster films. It's a fun experience to watch, don't believe people when they say it's too violent and aimed to teenagers. I as a 20 year old comic book reader loved it, and my grandmother as a movie collector also loved it.",1438128000,,637,4.5964912280701755

Phenomenal hyper-action sequences with crudely hilarious dialogue all tied in a bow that is a fantastic, fantastic cast.

The satire is spot on, the action scenes are brilliantly choreographed, the dialogue is peppered with zingers, and the excellent cast all have a jolly good time. Firth is kind of amazing as an action hero -- who woulda thought? -- the young Egerton would seem to have a bright future ahead of him, and Samuel L. Jackson's thilly lithp is appropriately goofy.

The cast was excellent, the acting was good, and the cool spy gadgets reminded me of the old Man from Uncle series from the 1960s.  There's a lot of unnecessary profanity in it, but what really sinks it in my opinion is the massive gratuitous violence.  It was just too violent to really be enjoyable.  What could have been a really slick spy movie just turned into a major bloodbath.  It's mainly for that reason that I gave this otherwise 5-star movie 3 stars.",1437868800,,509,4.43010752688172

The potential sophistication dissipated. This movie had some of the most disgusting mass gratuitous violence Ive seen with the added grossness of showing the violence with fourth-of-July music and other festive special effects. A few major plot flaws. A young hero more interested in flirting than using every second to save countless lives as the villains plan continues to unfold.

Practically everyone becomes a villain, and in the final scene the so-called hero accepts a sexual encounter with a supposed upper crust princess.

I.e., you don't have one of these scenarios where the young lad is just amazingly, naturally talented at all sorts of things that don't even turn up until he needs them.

A few minutes into the church scene, we pulled the plug in disgust, then took Amazon Prime off the Roku and changed our Amazon password so no one else in the house will see it.

What Inread were good, but they were people who have seen the directors other films, none of which I've seen. I don't think I'd like any of those.
Colin Firth in this movie is so disappointing, not for any bad acting on his part, I'm telling myself he didn't,t know it would turn out like this, or he owed someone a very big favor.

The action and sex did not offend. Couldn't figure out what I didn't like until I read some other reviews. I think this movie tried to combine too many genres. It was very Tarantino-ish, but without his intelligence. It was sort of Bond-ish, but without the subtlety and reserve.  It was sort of American-action, without the cohesion of action and plot.

There are so many points at which what could have been a fun action spy film instead was turned into something a 30 something year old with a perverse desire to kill people decided to hide it in a movie by writing it in a way to supposedly be attractive to teens, but didn't realize how much of their sickness would come out in the awkwardly paced script.

It takes a little time - and there are sacrifices, but, this young man makes the most of it.  My favorite part was the ending, actually (though entertaining throughout)!

FYI to those uninformed... the founder of Planned Parenthood Margaret Sanger was a racist eugenicist (look her up) and spoke before the KKK, and the Bible teaches against racism, so this is the opposite of the truth. Then we have to see the ""hero"" slaughter a whole church full of worshippers. SERIOUSLY?? At a time when real Christians are actually being slaughtered in their homes and churches in the Mid East and around the world, and real racists are shooting up churches here in America???

6943318,5,B00S1ITA2W,"This was absolutely my favorite movie to come out in recent years. It is hilarious and action packed throughout. Many of the people who rated this movie one start were expecting a James Bond clone. This movie is insanely creative and has a whole new take on the spy genre. Imagine if Tarantino wrote Bond. Think Kill Bill meets James Bond going in or you may expect something closer to a family film. You can expect violence, crude humor and plenty of swearing. This however does not take away from the movie in any way. Anyone who took the time to research the film would know these things going in. The graphic novel was written by the same person as the KickAss series. Pretty much the same team worked on the movies as well. Don't skip this movie due to the morons who rated negative because they were misinformed or believe one joke at the end was too over the top. It was rated R for a reason.

WARNING  The main protagonist sodomises  a Scandinavian Princess at the end of the movie  they even show him closing in on her bare rump as the closing credits start.

As to the movie itself - nearly 90+% of it is an utter waste of digital film. Samuel L Jackson, who I usually LOVE in any movie he is in, is an absolutely HORRIBLE travesty in this craptastic movie.

However, none of the characters here give me reason to like them, which makes this movie is just tedious.  I get this is satire, I get the sly camp, but there's just nothing new or terribly interesting here, and it makes me wonder why this movie was made.  I couldn't finish it, as after 45 mins., the hero is still stuck in training camp.  3 stars nay for the stars themselves.",1437696000,,450,4.373493975903615

Well by my review I will tell you I was offended and this movie had it all from Republicans being evil, wealthy all raised with a silver spoon and Christians hate blacks and Catholic's to muddy up the waters that we do not believe in Abortion and science has proved us right on this issue, but we do not listen to science on this one because it does not meet our agenda.

6943374,1,B00S1ITA2W,"I know that to some, unabashed violence is supposed to be entertaining and down right funny in its ridiculousness.  Unfortunately, the days where we went to the movies to see extreme violence that we could only see in movies as entertainment have long been replaced by real life everyday mass murders we see in the news every day. So, for me, this movie lost its perspective on the fun violence of villain vs hero when it depicted people locked in a church being killed.  Personally, I prefer the old time movies that didn't show all the gory violence, but left a little to the imagination.  To me the effect of the violence was not diminished and was more creative when left to the imagination.",1437609600,,695,4.588709677419355

It's the most imaginative spy movie to date yet it's totally professional and elevates the entirety to high (farcical) art. Kingsman makes me wonder what  it would have been like if this actually existed. And you don't have to be stoned to enjoy Kingsman -- it is fantastically hilarious, sober at times and doesn't take itself serious.

You owe it to yourself to watch this. Try to forget the other Bond-like movies you've seen or you may be underwhelmed with the plot the first time.

It's James Bond, meets Austin Powers (possibly) or possibly Good Will Hunting, with a hint of Quentin Tarantino, a PG-13 version, since there is no gushing blood.  I just don't understand why the villain had to have a lisp. The villains right hand man, or rather women, was the more scarier villain.

6943462,5,B00S1ITA2W,"We enjoyed the movie tremendously. It seemed like a cross between Men in Black and James Bond. The Kingsman are a secret order of men and women dedicated to the protection of the Kingdom of England and her sovereignty.

In this particular movie we have the standard Evil Villein who is wanting to take over the world, mainly by brining the population under control by designing a weapon of mass destruction that is neither Nuclear Weapons nor Biological Weapons. Instead it is a system of weapon that will bring people to a boiling point of loosing control of their ability to reason and instead respond to everything with anger.

Our Hero is one of the men of The Kingsman who is doing his best to unwrap the truth about this evil plot while at the same time trying to recruit the next Kingsman to replace another who has died in the line of duty.

The story line is very plausible given today's technology. The men and women in the service of their country is also plausible and the way they go about their work is very gifted and unique just as the Men in Black and James Bond would do.

The only frustration I had with the movie was the use of vulgarity as a standard way of daily dialogue. Really? Can't people talk without so much vulgarity?

Well, other than that we enjoyed watching the movie.",1437523200,,1301,4.472573839662447

In fact - I will say that Samuel Jackson's lisp ruined the movie for me.  I wonder if the LISP was a Samuel Jackson choice?  Or director choice?  I am guessing that at Samuel Jackson's acting level - Samuel Jackson himself  probably made that stupid lisp choice.  Terrible decision.  The director should have had the balls to say, ""Um, Mr. Jackson - the lisp is oh so clever and cutting edge - BUT - the lisp will ruin the movie you ding dong!!!""

The movie came on time 3 days after it was ordered. the movie itself is stellar with an irreverent yet respectful tone towards the old spy movies of the 80's and 90's paying homage to Bond and even Austin Powers. Colin Firth did much better than I had though he would do with an excellent performance. Taron Egerton is very good in this holding his own with some big industry names. Sadly my home was broken into the night after the delivery and the copy of ""Kingsman: The Secret Service (Blu-ray + Digital Copy)"" was the only thing they took besides a phone.

I rather adore the fact that Colin Firth, Michael Caine, and Mark Strong agreed to do this film because it gave them all the opportunity to do something a little bit unexpected of them and they're brilliant.  From a plot standpoint it's kind of wacky and over the top, sort of like the spy movies I grew up watching on tv as a kid.  Samuel L. Jackson's bad guy is oddly likeable because he's trying to do good for the world but going about it all the wrong way.  But don't stay for the plot since the action is the main point of the whole endeavor and deliver it does several times over.  I kept thinking the whole film could not get any more insane but then it outdid itself and ended just about perfectly with a little homage to its own hubris.  Well done, Kingsman.

6943573,2,B00S1ITA2W,"I'm actually super disappointed with this movie. It starts out great with just enough action, suspense and comedy to make it really enjoyable. Then with about an hour left in the film it's like they fired all their writers and made your standard over the top mindless action film. I honestly think they just ran out of material because the last third of the movie is entirely mind numbing, outrageously long action scenes. I get it, it's a nod to the old James Bond films that this movie is centered around. But slipping from such a good beginning to the horrifically cliche final act of the film was just too much of a contrast for me to find the remainder of the movie entertaining. It's like watching Casino Royale and then having it replaced with a Steven Seagal movie. There's compelling action and then there's get to the freakin point action. This movie has both.",1437436800,,870,4.619354838709677

Fantastic work by Colin Firth in an atypical role, and Samuel L. Jackson in another quirky one. Nice supporting work by the amazing Michael Caine. Decent, solid work from everyone else. A fun, well paced action movie with a fair bit of humor. There is one non-explicit but raunchy bit at the end that does not seem to fit the tone of the rest of the movie, it seemed heavy handed and crass. But the rest of the movie is just plain fun. And it uses the soundtrack very very well in a few places.

Lazy writers create overly long gunfight scenes, exploding heads, and naughty dialogue because they don't have enough interesting or funny ideas.  They people involved with this movie should be punished for their half-assed and lazy performance in writing, directing, and acting in this movie....don't buy or see this movie and cross the director off your list.

Okay, it was funny when the princess offered a special motivation, but that one scene is not enough to save the movie.

The trailer was misleading.  The trailer should have revealed that this was Collin Firth acting as Austin Powers in Goldmember, not as Daniel Craig as James Bond.

6943697,5,B00S1ITA2W,"I won't waste any time summarizing the plot here. Plenty of other reviewers have done that and, more importantly, it won't add much to your enjoyment of this amazingly funny, surprising and often casually shocking thrill ride of a spy movie. One note about that plot that might be important is that although this movie makes references to other well-known spy driven franchises, it is not a parody of the genre. It would be a disservice to everything that's excellent about Kingsman to suggest that it only exists as a post-modern reference to James Bond and other spy franchises. Kingman stands just fine on its own with a combination of clever plotting, unique characters, great performances and, no s***ting here, some of the best, most unique, most shockingly fun and disturbing action sequences I've seen in a movie, including one scene featuring the song ""Freebird"" that blew me completely away.

So don't watch trailers or listen to anyone else talk about what happens. It will only ruin the delight and surprise of encountering some of Kingsman's more iconically pleasurable moments. Just go rent or buy it, put it on the biggest screen you have, turn down the lights, jack up the volume to window shaking level and then sit back, relax and enjoy this cinematic rocket ride to the center of the sun.

Oh. And if you plan to watch this with anyone of a more tender age, there are a few caveats that apply. Plenty of swearing, some tense moments, and a lot of hyper-realistic, over-the-top violence that might turn a stomach or two. But to be fair--the violence while eye-popping is also done in a stylistic way that keeps it from looking too gruesome. If anything, a lot of it is funny. Younger audiences might be a little bit overwhelmed by it. And be on the lookout for two gratuitous but Swedish anal sex references that will come out of nowhere and slap you in the face. Again--younger folks might get their views on the already confusing world of sex all blowed up but, on the other hand, with the omnipresent availability of online streaming hardcore porn, I doubt there are too many kids left who have any imagination about sex left.

Anyway. Watch the movie. You'll be hooked from the opening credits and things just get better from there.",1437350400,2,2254,4.744897959183674

6943702,1,B00S1ITA2W,"I can't say it better than this guy. Sad, that Hollywood thinks this mess is entertainment. Read this review and save your money. I wish I had!!

Jess Kroll: The real message of Kingsman isn't about class warfare or global warming or anything that it says on screen. No. The message is that you, audience member who paid to watch this garbage, will tolerate any amount of viciousness as long as it has bright colors and happy music. Vaughns statement is that dressing up violence with slick fights and a lot of editing will make the idiots in the audience forget that billions of innocent people all over the world are attempting to kill each other with their bare hands. They are ripping into flesh with their nails, gouging eyes, breaking limbs, but its so very, very fun and funny because theres pop music playing and everything is so colorful. That only one of these people has a name is meant to soften the blow except that those people on the screen, that cattle slaughtering itself through the machinations of their unknown masters, are us. They are meant to represent you and me and everyone we know and love. Yet its cartoony and over-the-top and that makes everything perfectly fine.",1437350400,,1193,4.680952380952381

It's like the movie goes to great lengths at times to be silly and not take itself seriously but then the graphic violence pops up time and again and is completely out of sync with the rest of the film.

6943742,1,B00S1ITA2W,"This movie had so much potential with an interesting take on an overdone theme, but ultimately the stellar cast was wasted on this poorly written screenplay.  The script was heavy with profanity, which quickly became annoying and lacked the variety of expression possible when communicating in the English language. It would've had far greater comedy potential if the incessant f-bomb had been replaced with ""pickles"" or some other unexpected word that supporting characters could react to.  While there were a few isolated moments of brilliance thanks to solid acting, overall, the movie was profoundly disappointing.  Instead of being clever, funny, and sexy as I'd hoped, this movie offered the worst of all that is trite, offensive, and crude sprinkled with a few decent action sequences.",1437264000,,792,5.32

Somewhere between Mission Impossible meets Sherlock, this movie was a lot of fun to watch.  It's one you can sit back and enjoy without having to think too much and just let the visuals do what they please. The only thing I didn't love was Samuel L.

6943795,5,B00S1ITA2W,"This film is like a cartoon come to life. The violence is purposely made extreme and preposterous which makes it hilarious. If you don't approach this with the right mindset, you just won't get the humor. It satirizes just about every topic you can think of. From global warming to terrorism to speech impediments. The action choreography is some of the best I've ever seen.

Some people are oh, so offended by a particular scene in a church, saying the filmmakers are attacking Christianity. Well, they obviously were not paying very close attention to the movie. This church full of worshippers actually represents the well known hate group that poses as a church. You know, the ones that picket military funerals with horribly hateful signs. If you pay attention to the film, there's no mistaking who these ""Christians"" are supposed to be. This is what makes the church scene so hilarious and gratifying. Whether we admit it or not, it's what we'd all like to see happen to these idiots.

In case you haven't seen that particular film: it's action-movie action cranked up to 11 in a very fun way. The story is classic. The acting is great (possibly my favorite Mark Strong character). The humor is well-placed -- and a little dark (fair warning). Ultimately, if you're in the mood for a supremely entertaining English-Spy-Action-Comedy (that's a genre, right?) you will probably enjoy Kingsman.",1437091200,,660,5.235849056603773

This is it.  Do not be fooled by the presence of Colin Firth, who should have to atone for the entirety of his life for agreeing to sink to the level of this movie.  The entire production - actors, sets, script - is simply a plastic bubble set out there to support utterly gratuitous, and singularly offensive, violence.  Meaningless violence.

Colin Firth gives his character all the panache of David Niven's James Bond, but unlike the sloppy Casino Royale of 1967, Matthew Vaughn keeps the story tight, relying on an over-the-top performance by Samuel L. Jackson to cover the rough patches.  Taron Egerton gives Eggsy a nice sensitivity throughout the movie, which makes you wonder why Vaughn decided to waste the last scene on the Swedish princess, when Eggsy obviously had Roxie waiting for him, but no matter.  It seems that Vaughn got a little carried away there in the end.  I'm sure there will be more to come.  I hope Roxie puts Eggsy in his place for that glaring faux pas.",1437004800,,811,4.676056338028169

6944032,2,B00S1ITA2W,"Could have been 5 stars

My 17 yr old son and I watched this -- we love spy movies and fun, witty, smart-alecky characters. Kingsman could have been a 5 star movie -- amazing actors, a great premise, action scenes, spy gear and few twists that were totally unexpected.
  However -- it loses the 3 stars for using the F-word over a hundred times and a totally inappropriate, un-needed and crass sexual comment and visual. My son even said ""that was totally unnecessary"" and ""can't the writers come up with anything other than the f-word?""
  The premise of a streetwise teenager going through spy school training was great! You got some excellent action scenes with the spies and some training spots that could have made for some great follow ups. But the lisp on our bad guy was just stupid and detracted from the story. There are a lot of fight scenes and the twists are quite unexpected. For ages 16+ with the caveat of ""we don't talk like this""",1436832000,,946,4.541176470588235

The kids will LOVE this movie, but there is not a lot of intellectual meat on the bones here.  The plot is hackneyed, full of the same old crap like an obligatory love interest, an underdog hero plucked from obscurity, a parent who did miraculous things secretly, schoolmate bullies who have to be won over by the plucky little hero's bravery, etc.

This seriously is a young teen's James Bond film.  If your kids love the Hunger Games or Harry Potter franchises, rent it for them.  But be ready to read a good book between fight scenes.

6944110,1,B00S1ITA2W,"I understand some see this as a comedy, and I can appreciate that there were exaggerated graphics in an effort to support the bend they were trying to take in this film. However, the unnecessarily long killing scene in the church combined with a mother taking an ax to a door trying to kill her toddler daughter are simply not funny, regardless of how creative the story line or graphics try to be. I was truly disturbed after watching this film, and actually spent a good part of the time with my hands over my eyes, or fast forwarding thru the horrific parts. In hindsight, I wish I'd simply turned it off.",1436745600,3,608,4.4375

I know Samual Jackson will take any part  hes got seriouse tax trouble and owes a bunch of money,  Michael Cain will do any movie no matter how bad as I think hes going for the world record for movie parts in a life time.  But Colin Firth in this mess?
Ok I wasn't expecting much and boy did I get even less.  The cliches were bad enough, the story line beyond predicatable down to him going back for revenge. But the action was so over produced it seemed it should be back in the graphic novel this came out of.
The kid  of course a gymnyst prodigy with military training, The villian some how convinces  Obama to wipe out humanity along with all the other politicans  (who did they think they were going to govern if everyone was dead)  except of course the backdoor loving princess from sweden who is kept in a luxury prison cell for whatever reason.

6944247,2,B00S1ITA2W,"The primary draw of the movie, for many, including me, is Colin Firth.  He is as naturally dapper and sophisticated as Cary Grant, even if not as naturally funny.  He isn't given enough opportunity in this movie to be funny.  I thought this movie would have a lot more humor than it has, and didn't expect it to have such frequent f words.  I feel the way it depicts violence is often tastelessly graphic also.  I like several plot components and the absurdity of Samuel L. Jackson's psychopathic villain, and a particular scene where Colin Firth and Samuel L. Jackson don't know whether the other one knows what he's up to, communicating in very subtle ways as Firth, a member of the good Kingsman agency, pretends to be interested in donating to Jackson's cause of eliminating most of the world population to save the planet.  Firth's timing and wry delivery, and Jackson's cartoonish pleasure about evil causes, make that scene great, equally suspenseful and humorous.  The unexpected touches of humor in dark situations is like Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones humor.  I wish the rest of the movie was as great as that scene.  There really are several places which are so tasteless in the way the violence is done that I could've more easily handled a graphic war movie, and it even ends with sexual humor at the very last moment of the movie, in a spoof of James Bond the womanizer.  I'm fairly tolerant in that I look for something more valuable in a movie than the things I could criticize about it, but this movie was one I mostly tolerated rather than enjoyed, because there are just too many parts of it that overdo the cussing and graphic violence.",1436659200,2,1659,4.670103092783505

Sofia Boutelia was lethal, beautiful and funny all at the same time.  Of course, Michael Caine, well he is Michael Caine.

6944272,5,B00S1ITA2W,"I watched the streaming version of Kingsman:  The Secret Service, and I must say that's the most fun I've had watching a movie in quite some time which I should maybe feel guilty about since it is a very violent movie.  However, the violence in the movie is done in a very non-serious way.  It's difficult for me to explain.  Think of some of the fantastical, unbelievable, funny moments in James Bond, and you have the flavor of this movie.  Stop reading here if you don't want any spoilers knowing that this movie will be more fun than you've seen in quite a while.

SPOILERS:

The movie is about a boy, Gary (Eggsy) Unwin who doesn't know it, but is a son of a Kingsman spy who was killed in action saving his fellow Kingsman.  Eggsy has taken to a life of mischief and crime.  He and his mother and her cruel second husband and his family are part of the underclass of society.  An agent of the Kingsman (Colin Firth) who was saved by Eggsy's father sees potential in Eggsy becoming a great Kingsman agent.  Colin Firth is one of my favorite actors, and he did not disappoint in playing Agent Harry Hart (Galahad), the perfect gentleman spy.  Eggsy gets into some trouble and is in jail when Harry Hart bails him out and gives him the opportunity to go through the selection process to become a Kingsman.

Other young candidates go through the process with him told that at the end only one of them will be selected.  Merlin (played by Mark Strong) is the instructor of this ""class"".  I don't want to put too many spoilers in this review, so I'll simply say that the candidates go through many tests together.  At the end, only two are left, Eggsy and Roxy (played by Sophie Cookson).  The last test ... no I won't tell you what the last test is.  I won't spoil it.

I will say that the movie pits the Kingsman against of course a horrible villian named Valentine (played by Samuel L. Jackson).  Valentine is a computer genius multi-billionaire who fought to stop global warming and felt he had failed at doing that.  He decided the only way to survive the future would be to cull the population.  He comes up with a plan to do just that, and it is up to the Kingsman to stop him.  Gazelle (played by Sofia Boutella) is Valentine's Number 1 assassin.

This movie is a whirlwind of fun in a guiltily sick way.  lol.  I hope they make sequels to this movie.",1436659200,,2359,4.377880184331797
6944273,5,B00S1ITA2W,"I never tire watching Colin Firth murder a hundred people in a Bible thumping church. I watch it over and over and over and over and I just love it.

6944282,4,B00S1ITA2W,"What looked to me like a young adult movie turned out quite different once the first scene started. Wow, a bunch of heads blown off and then in the second scene a guy cut in half down the middle. I don't consider that much of a spoiler considering the amount of violence to come. I can say there wasn't much blood, but the cartoonish violence and liberal use of colorful metaphors, especially the f-bomb, earned the R rating.

This was definitely not a young-adult movie, yet it was perfectly suited for fifteen year olds who would eat this stuff right up.

What does someone like me, who doesnt fit in either the young adult, or even the 18-49 demographic think of it? Ahem I actually liked it.

The language didn't bother me one bit. That was a given.

As far as the violence, without a lot of blood to go along with it, though it could be considered quite gross and gory, it was more cartoonish than gross. However, if you're on the squeamish side, Id skip this movie anyway.

I reiterate, young teens would eat this right up.

The plot was, of course, young man (and woman) save the world from a crazy whackadoodle. There WAS a plot. I had no trouble finding it, once the big reveal finally leaked out in dialogue about  of the way through.

As for the characters, the mentor, the kid and the other kid were okay. The mentors sidekick was pretty cool also. Bad guy and his bad sidekick were cartoonish bad. They had about as much depth as one would expect for a movie like this. Shakespeare this isnt.

I will say that when the credits finally rolled, I only recognized four names. I don't think its that Im getting old either. I keep up with the Kardashians and all that. Ive never really heard much of this cast. Maybe its because I hate sitcoms and almost all shows on TV. I can say none of these people have been in any of the shows I DO watch, and there are a few. Theyre also not on my Hollywood radar, which I keep tabs on a daily basis. Maybe if I watched Disney channel more. However, one of the kids in the agent training school did look sort of Harry Potter familiar.

6944289,4,B00S1ITA2W,"With a cast including Colin Firth, Samuel Jackson and Michael Caine how could I expect anything more than a solid film. Kingsman is a mix of James Bond with a bit of Kick A** mixed in. Its a movie of contradictions being serious yet irreverent and silly, making fun at times of the very genre of movie it is. But surprisingly, creates something unique and something that works and really made for an enjoyable action flick. Its action is a bit over the top at times and the story a bit silly at times as well but it is really a fun ride. Samuel Jackson as he always does excels in being the quirky character, in this case, a nerdy billionaire trying to remake the world. Jackson does well as the villain but his razor legged sidekick was a great and formidable co-villian. Plenty of action, laughable moments and silliness, cool weapons, good special effects and a fun story that kept me entertained. I hope they make a sequel.

The more spy shows that you have watched, the more allusions to other shows you will catch. Kingsman is an NGO spy service that models itself on the Knights of the Round Table. The head of the organization is called Arthur, and each of the highly trained agents bears the name of an Arthurian knight. Colin Firth plays an agent named Harry Hart, codenamed Galahad. The movie features Samuel L. Jackson as a villain who is trying to save the world from being destroyed by human beings who will not act responsibly toward the environment. Jackson plays a smooth-talking character who makes a lot of sense--until you realize that he is planning to kill most of the world's population. That part of the plot resembles the ending of Tom Clancy's ""Rainbow Six""; only Jackson's method of killing is much more violent. Despite the blood-and-gore, this is an entertaining movie for adults.",1436572800,,976,4.815476190476191

What they left out was the excessive gore. If you want to watch close-ups of exploding human heads dozens of them - this is your film. If you want to watch a movie that thinks having Samuel L. Jackson wearing a cap sideways makes him look like a villain, this is your film.

6944441,2,B00S1ITA2W,"2 Stars. Matthew Vaughn is British action director with a few hits under his belt (Layer Cake, Kick-ass, X-Men: First Class, who also produced Guy Ritchie's early hits. He continues the British action style with this comedic take on spy and Bond films. An ultra-underground organization that works outside the government deals with a global threat to annihilate most of mankind, as a group of young recruits bid for the one open spot on spot in the Kingsman. While the movie starts out promising and fun, it degrades to unnecessary ultra-violence that is suppose to be comedic. It loses the charm that it could have and falls flat. The only redeeming quality is Samuel L. Jacksons offbeat and out of character performance.",1436400000,,722,4.926229508196721

6944512,3,B00S1ITA2W,"BEWARE! SPOILERS AHEAD! I really liked the story line, twists, and the overall atmosphere. There was a lot to like. Like one reviewer stated, it had a ""Kill Bill"" feel to it, but the script suffered from too much profanity and an unfortunate, unnecessary final scene involving a Swedish princess. I watched this with my family, and the profanity was so prevalent, it became ridiculous. We were actually rolling our eyes and commenting on this about a third of the way through the film. This is not a family movie, but it could have been, and the audience for it would have been much larger. As it is, I will never recommend it to anyone. I saw ""Bond"" and ""Harry Potter"" comparisons in some of the other reviews, but this team has a long way to go before they ever approach that level of quality. Maybe when this team gets out of junior high school, they'll be able to offer up something with more craft and finesse.",1436400000,2,915,4.485029940119761

There were some very different and fun special effects ( don't let anyone ruin this for you)!
Samuel Jackson was great and the movie had a lot of subtle humor especially when referencing movies of this genre.
The movie had just the right combo of action and humor. The main storyline was weak but it didn't bother me as it really wasn't needed.

First 1/3 of the movie: Kinda campy.  Not exactly what I expected, but not unwatchable by any stretch of the imagination.

Middle part of the movie, up to last 10 minutes: This could be a very good franchise.  Starting to gain steam and get through the meat of the story.  Line delivery is mostly great, acting is very good.

Last 10 minutes: not entire sure what just happened to a good movie.  The ending wasn't bad, just very, very odd by comparison to the rest of the film.  It's as if they had a guest director for the last 10 minutes.

I found the movie very fun, and reasonably interesting.  While the ending was very odd, it didn't really ruin the rest of the film in my eyes.",1436400000,,708,4.303030303030303

I am disappointed that quality actors like Colin Firth  and Michael Cain would associate himself with a movie of this low quality.  Degrading and insulting to anyone who watches this.  I am disappointed in myself that I allowed it to play out because I felt selfish that I had spent $$ to rent it.  In actuality, the plot could have been a good movie (like a Bond) if written and directed with competence.  Save your money and your time.",1436400000,2,609,4.441441441441442

6944658,3,B00S1ITA2W,"It is very clear what this movie wants to be.  It wants to be an homage to all those fun spy movies of the past with their spies so so suave and British and their fun gadgets and the goofy but sinister villains with megalomaniacal world ending plots. There are moments that it gets things so right, and I'm sure the script they started with must have been fun, to get such great actors working on this thing. But sometimes it gets things all wrong, and even when it is crap it is very nearly a good movie. But in the end my husband and I kind of looked at each other and agreed that yeah, there was a reason it crashed and burned so quickly in the theaters.",1436400000,,657,4.093023255813954

6944670,4,B00S1ITA2W,"First, there will be no spoilers in this review. This was a very entertaining movie. We didn't have high expectations, but it was a much better movie than I thought.  It has a very interesting plot relating to a relevant to a set of issues facing society today.  The plot is far fetched, but that's what makes it a fun movie.  It's a James Bond style movie, but with more humor.  Very enjoyable.

I think you'll like this one.

I hope you find this review helpful.

6944703,5,B00S1ITA2W,"This was a great movie in the theatre, which is not diminished by looking at it on a smaller screen.

It is escapist fantasy, that is well-played with humor and is quite action-packed.  Both Colin Firth and Samuel L. Jackson plays their roles well, Mark Strong is well-cast (and appropriately understated) in has role of Merlin.  This is one of the few opportunities to see Michael Caine as a ""bad guy,"" so enjoy it.

Taron Egerton and Sophie Cookson are entertaining newcomers in their roles, and Hanna Alstrm is the sort of Princess that we would all want to rule our country.

I am looking forward to the sequel (prequel?).",1436400000,,626,4.654545454545454

6944789,2,B00S1ITA2W,"The movie was mostly enjoyable.  However, there is a scene where the main character attends a church in rural Kentucky that is horribly offensive.  The minister of that church regularly uses the N word, makes anti-Semitic statements, and other highly offensive statements; and the church has Confederate battle flags featured prominently throughout the sanctuary.  Further, all of the characters in this church are all white southerners.  The main character and the congregants then get involved in a melee whereby the main character kills all of the congregants and the minister.  This scene was incredibly violent and bloody.  We are supposed to be rooting for the main character as he kills all of these people because they are bigots.

This scene struck me as the wet dream of Hollywood liberals, as a classy Brit (and a black ally) destroys caricatures of Southern whites.  I cannot imagine a mainstream Hollywood film depicting another ethnic group in such a demeaning way and then reveling in the killing of so many people who were otherwise non-violent.

However it has the same mindless, needless, violence as the new Bond movies. Is that what it takes to sell a movie nowadays?  The old movies didn't do that. Is it necessary to show that much violence or is society becoming psychopathic? Still big improvement over the new post Cubby Broccoli Bond disasters I don't watch or spend my money on anymore.

6944837,1,B00S1ITA2W,"This movie is TRASH!!!!  I was expecting a clever spoof of James Bond movies, and instead, witnessed the most violent, horrendous display of gratuitous gore that I have ever seen on screen.  Do NOT let your children or even teens see this movie, and frankly, as an adult, I found it disturbing and upsetting.  In the first five minutes, before the opening credits even started, there was so much graphic killing, we almost stopped right there.  But, I thought, Colin Firth and Michael Caine are in this movie-- surely this is an aberration and it has to get better?  It got more and more violent as it went on (the worst scene was a several-minute long massacre in a church), not to mention the foul language, and even had a close-up nude shot in one of the final scenes, which, if you had heard the dialogue before it, was a bit shocking.  The script is based on so many flawed premises, both politically and ethically, and I found the characterization of Christians in this movie totally offensive.  Of course, they were portrayed as hate-mongering extremists.  Sorry, but the Christians I know are loving, decent, charitable people who help others, not a bunch of crazed haters.
On top of it all, this movie was a huge waste of resources-- the production values and technology involved, and certain elements of the story (young man rises above his difficult upbringing to become a dashing secret agent) etc. could have made for a clever and truly entertaining movie.  But, those moments were few and far between.  It was just a horrible, graphically violent movie that made me long for something of real quality, and reminded me of why my husband and I usually watch old classics instead of modern movies.",1436227200,,1708,4.739864864864865

I watched it three times before my rental period was up.  Colin Firth was excellent in this but then I am a huge fan of his.  I loved the Gazelle character - I was exhausted watching all her moves.  This had the right amount of humor and swearing in it for my taste.  I do like some blood and guts too.  It was a bit of a parody if I am honest on several movies but I think that is what I liked about it.  It is not earth shatteringly new or better than the movies that have gone before.  I guess I was just in the right mood to enjoy this one.  I found it hilarious that the bad-guy (Samuel L Jackson) cannot bear to see violence and it actually made him vomit at one point (made me laugh out loud).  Taron Egerton was also excellent.  His cheeky grin was well-placed throughout.  Doesn't hurt that he's easy on the eyes either.  I have many favorite scenes but one that got the cute factor is when he is training with his new dog and the pup won't walk. He is not allowed to hold it, so next you see the pug stuffed down his shirt as he runs with his pack/rifle.  The puppies head is bouncing up and down as he runs. Aw!",1436140800,,1279,4.0

It wasn't offensive to me, but just didn't make sense as it came out of nowhere.  My issue was with the killing off of Colin Firth's character.

6944892,5,B00S1ITA2W,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Maybe it was because there was never a dull moment, but more likely it was the fact that there was a compelling story to tell. Kingsmen was less than predictable in nearly every situation, and this a rarity in movies of this particular genre in my opinion. Colin Firth did a fantastic job in his role as mentor for the fledgling Kingsmen candidate 'Eggsie' played by Taron Egerton. The only thing I didn't like about this movie was Samuel L Jacksons portrayal of the megalomaniac business mogul Valentine. It might have been the 'Mike Tysonesque' lisp of his character, but from the beginning I wasn't convinced that Valentine was capable of taking over the world. Don't get me wrong though---I really am a fan of Samuel L Jackson. Nevertheless, I feel this particular role should have gone to another actor. Mark Strong (Merlin) would have been a much better choice for the role of Valentine in my humble opinion. More convincing was the blades-for-legs villain/assasin played by Sofia Boutella. SHE was interesting, terrifying, and fun to watch at the same time. If you like to unwind and enjoy movies with British accents, gratuitous violence, sexual innuendo, and comedic relief....this is the movie for you! I would have to say this movie in many ways reminds me of another genre defining movie: Kick Ass. I'd give this movie a nine out of ten.",1436054400,,1382,4.8354430379746836
6944893,2,B00S1ITA2W,A movie that was clever and stylish.  All the actors did a great job. I don't think memorizing  their  lines was any challenge since every other word or so was f***.  For me there was way to much gratuitous violence that did nothing for the story. I started out liking it and I'm sorry I watched it now.

6944904,2,B00S1ITA2W,"This film has incredible actors - Colin Firth, Samuel Jackson, Michael Caine. The first 2/3's of the film keeps your attention your admiration for the film, but the last third bombs.  It is almost as if there was one person steering the ship during the first part who had a sense of direction, and then in the last third, someone else took over who had no idea what the right direction was or how to end the movie.  Others have criticized the overuse of the cartoon effects and I whole heartedly agree.  I paid Amazon money to watch this as it is not yet included in the free Prime selection.  If you are at all interested in watching this movie, DO NOT waste any money on it.  Wait until it is free to stream.

Who knew they could screw it up so badly?  First of all, Samuel Jackson's character was written badly, all the way from his speech impediment to his ridiculous clothing to his mannerisms, and I have never disliked a Samuel Jackson character.  Should have been my first clue.  Colin Firth's character was very good, so I watched the whole movie.  Although the fight scenes were well choreographed, the violence was as ridiculous as Samuel Jackson's character.  Too much, not effective, and seemingly out of place in the movie, starting with the church scene, onto the fireworks head explosions.  And why a church?  I know it was written before the church shooting in Charleston, but any place of worship, regardless of which religion, should be ""sacred"" from violence.  JMO, but there you have it.  Finally, the last few scenes ruined whatever I liked about the movie.  It didn't tie into the rest of the plot in any way, shape, or form, it was insulting, gratuitous, and exploitive.  Frankly, I'm sick of anal sex being written into movies and TV just to shock, get attention, or whatever.  You don't have to be a far right religious, homophobic person to be turned off by that, and I wish the industry would get a clue.",1435968000,2,1390,4.6735537190082646

6944992,5,B00S1ITA2W,"THE FILM: KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE is one of those movies that grabs you by the stones and doesn't let go until the credits roll. I haven't seen any of the spy films that it pays homage to, but if they're anything like this I'll get right on it. The basic story is about a young man, Eggsy (Taron Egerton) who joins a super-secret spy organization, helps save the world, and becomes a better person in the process. The entire cast did an incredible job playing their characters. You have seasoned veterans like Colin Firth, Michael Caine and Samuel L. Jackson. And then there is newcomer Taron Egerton, who is a revelation. He has a suave, cool attitude to him that really sold the character he played. Not only were the performances excellent all-round, the actors looked like they were having a great time, which spills over onto the audience as a result. The action sequences, an important part of a film like this, were also really good. Matthew Vaughn has a way with kinetic action (see: LAYER CAKE, KICK-ASS) and he delivers that here. Although the editing and camera-work pushes the boundaries of comprehensibility, the geography of each scene was never in question. The crown jewel of these is a scene in a church set to Lynyrd Skynyrd's Free Bird. If you aren't on-board with the film at this point, maybe it isn't for you. If there's anything that be said negatively about the film, the characterization of the villain might not sit well with some people. There also was quite a lot of CGI enhancement. And, there's one sexual joke/scene towards the end that could come off as crass, but I thought it was consistent with the type of film this was trying to be. Generally speaking, all of the complaints that could be made of the film have (to me, at least) a valid explanation. It's a highly entertaining film with a good story, excellent action, and a great sense of humor. Just sit back and enjoy the ride!

THE EXTRAS: There isn't a load of special features, but what is there provides a decently thorough look at one of this year's best films. The centerpiece is a 90-minute documentary (split into several parts) on the making of KINGSMAN. It was great to see the amount of thought and work that went into the project, as well as the enthusiasm of the cast and crew. However, one thing I couldn't get out of my head was how Matthew Vaughn sounds like Eric Bana with a British accent. There are also some galleries of concept art and production stills.

OVERALL: KINGSMAN is, hands down, my favorite theatrical experience this year (so far), and it was just as entertaining on Blu-ray. Although I do gravitate towards more serious-minded fare, escapism done right is just as good. This film knows what it is and delivers a high-octane thrill-ride that will appeal to the kid in you. As far as a Blu-ray package, there isn't a wealth of supplementary material, but was still enough for me. So, if you like action films that kick butt and have fun while doing so, I'd highly recommend picking up KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE.",1435968000,13,3041,4.640074211502783

I laughed once when they were choosing a dog.  This movie is filled with so many pointless killings and gore. I thought Colin Firth was the main here but he wasn't.

6945007,4,B00S1ITA2W,"I have to say that all the reviews are true. It is a great and terrible movie... which really means that you need to be in the right frame of mind to enjoy it. It is certainly not as good as it might have been  particularly with this good of a cast. And its hand is occasionally over-played. As for those bothered by the violence, I think it really needs to be understood as calculated hyper-violence. It's supposed to be ridiculous. The fight in the church set to Skynnard's Free Bird is truly funny, but in a Monty Python sort of way. There will be blood, but don't let that keep you from enjoying the smaller moments  like the clever critique of our GoPro/selfie-stick obsessed worldview or the Busby Berkeley homage.

In the end, the pity is when the movie plays it straight, it feels out of place (as others have commented). Take as an example the Mike Meyer's Austin Powers vehicles which were silly start to finish. You never expected them to be any different. The problem with Kingsman is that in between the brilliant parts, it sort of loses the thread. In fairness, this is what separates okay movies from great ones. This is not a great move, but it is occasionally pretty funny and entertaining and whether you find it so has at least as much to do with how you approach it.

6945059,5,B00S1ITA2W,"Full court press with a British action thriller served up with a generous dollop of humor, this very successful film is based on the comic book The Secret Service (writers Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons) and transformed into a screenplay by Jane Goldman and director Matthew Vaughan  that guy responsible for Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels Layer Cake, Stardust.

For those of us who are not comic book fans or have not heard of the comic book on which this fantastic movie is based, the following is an explanation by Colin Firths character in the script: Since 1849, Kingsman Tailors have clothed the world's most powerful individuals. In 1919, a great number of them had lost their heirs to World War I. That meant a lot of money going uninherited. And a lot of powerful men with the desire to preserve peace and protect life. Our founders realized that they could channel that wealth and influence for the greater good. And so began our adventure. An independent international intelligence agency operating at the highest level of discretion. Without the politics and bureaucracy that undermine the intelligence of government-run spy organisations. A suit is the modern gentleman's armour. And the Kingsman agents are the new knights.

And that is only the explanation of the Kingsmen title. The film is blessed with a superb cast. The plot is all over the place and the action speaks louder than ideas of words. It tells the story of a super-secret spy organization that recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius. Among the featured actors are Colin Firth as Galahad/Harry Hart, Michael Caine as Arthur, Mark Strong as Merlin, Jack Davenport as Lancelot, an unrecognizable Mark Hamill as Professor Arnold, Sofia Boutella as the lower extremity enhance weapon Gazele who assists Samuel L. Jackson as super bad guy Valentine, Jonno Davies as Lee, and the very impressive new face hunk Taron Egerton as Eggsy. Cinematography is by George Richmond, and the musical score is by Henry Jackman, Matthew Margeson with a bow to Sir Edward Elgar. Great special effects and an ending to end all endings make this a full evening of pleasure. Grady Harp, July 15",1435968000,,2303,4.9921875

I saw this movie twice. The first time with a group that didn't mind violence and the second time with a group that did.
That being said, the first time I thought it was a lot of fun and really enjoyed it! But the second time, I felt super guilty for taking friends to an epic slasher.
SO... if you're not the kind of person that can stomach violence for the sake of violence and a fair bit of nonsense (also a trait the villian in this film shares, which I find pretty funny), this movie probably isn't for you.",1435968000,,568,4.172727272727273

6945196,5,B00S1ITA2W,"One of my favorite films of the year! Absolutely ridiculous, great satire, well choreographed fight scenes--and who did the editing and cuts? The editing was AMAZING. I saw it in theatres TWICE, and I was laughing to tears both times.

I grew up Baptist, AND in Kentucky, and found that whole ""church scene"" scene quite GRATIFYING. There are so many hateful, black hearted, xenophobic people in this world, and for someone who was surrounded by it for the first twenty years of my life it was an odd kind of satisfaction seeing it being dealt back.

A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++. Could not love this film more. The gore is actually not that bad at all, the church scene is really the only bloody part of the entire film, and the rest is over the top comical. Its like a live action comic book.

6945202,5,B00S1ITA2W,"It is more a nod to the spy movie genre than an outright spoof.  It is really a cross between the Bond films and movies like Kick Ass and Watchmen.  It is an extremely violent film, so if that turns you off to a movie then stop and do not even consider it.  There is not really any sex until the very end, and it really consists of a joke and a split second of nudity.  That said much of the violence is done in a very over the top and sometimes humorous way set to musical interludes.

The story is set around Samuel L Jackson's character trying to purge the world of most of the human race in order to save the Earth from humanity, with a select few being spared.  The Kingsmen are a group of spies out to protect humanity and stop the plot.  Most of the plot around the actual Kingsmen story is Collin Firth's character Harry trying to get a street kid named Eggsy through the training.  Much of the story revolves around the training of potential recruits who get whittled down one-by-one.  I will not say any more about the plot to avoid giving too much away, but there are the requisite spy gadgets, a ton of action, some comedy, and behind it all an interesting story with a great cast.

For those who get the blu ray, it looks and sounds great.  For extras you have an hour and a half behind the scenes/making of feature with the cast, crew, and producers along with Mark Millar who wrote the comic.  There is also a stills gallery of production photos and the trailer.  Good for what is there if you like to go through the extras.

It is definitely not a movie for everyone, but if you are a fan of similar movies, this is a good way to fill a couple hours.",1435881600,6,1666,4.181818181818182
6945208,5,B00S1ITA2W,"This was on my Watch List, but I lucked out when I caught it on an overseas plane flight. I loved it. Colin Firth was more perfect than any James Bond. The young actor who played the protege did a great job. The plot was fun. The action was fast-paced. I couldn't ask for anything more except a sequel. Well, maybe a prequel because I'd love to see Colin Firth as a younger Galahad.

Is there a downside? I didn't think they picked the right Lancelot. Come on! Fear of heights and she'd kill a dog? Not deserving of the title in my opinion. You'll only get this reference if you've seen the movie.",1435881600,,597,4.2368421052631575

First of all, TARON EGERTON, you may ask why his name is capitalized...because he is sensational! He is in what I assume to be one of his first major films with a ton of acting heavyweights...Colin Firth, Samuel Jackson, Michael Caine, Mark Strong....and he more that shines. The fight scenes are awesome and the attention to the smaller scenes for example Eggsy (Taron's character) and his pug. don't get me wrong there are some really nasty and bloody scenes (the church) but the story and the cast are exemplary.

Even if one were to take note of the R rating, the film was still chiefly promoted as an action film in the tongue-in-cheek style of an early Bond film. After all, Matthew Vaughn directed X-Men First Class, also staring young adult leads and it certainly had all the fun and excitement one could want in an action / super hero film. But then there is Kingsman... Perhaps the strangest adjustment is the inconsistent pacing. The film is at times very ""Bondsian"" in its adventure, it's fast pace, it's early fight scenes, and its over-the-top villain. Speaking of villains, I could find nothing either intimidating or amusing about Samuel L. Jackson's annoying character. There was nothing intriguing about the part or the way Jackson executed the part. Amidst the fun of the beginning of the film, one is quickly struck by the over-the-top Tarantino violence. Perhaps this is appealing to some. I found it unnecessary, as it caused me to feel nothing for the lead characters. In fact, the shock could be said to take away from any other emotion the film might otherwise generate.

Setting the gratuitous violence aside for a moment, the pacing of the film continued rather unsteadily. There is, of course the training sequence for the young hero, all while the director is trying to build up a greater threat of the lackluster villain. But the evil plot of the villain is not highly complex or interesting, so the buildup is not highly intriguing. And, the training sequence doesn't do much to make one grow attached to the young hero, although it certainly tries. Colin Firth's character, although Firth is a strong actor to be sure, also doesn't provide any great emotional hook for himself. He is supposedly motivated by the death(s) of agents he was close to, but these relationships aren't well established and his sophisticated British spy facade fails to keep the viewer interested in his character. The only truly intriguing relationship in the film is that between Firth's character and that of the lead young man (Taron Egerton). However, they are allowed so little screen time together that this meaningful relationship isn't quiet believable.

Then we build to the climax. Without providing too many spoilers, I will say that the revealing of the evil mastermind's dastardly plot is so disconcertingly violent that one is not quite sure how to feel. On the one hand, one is meant to feel terrible because of the role Firth's character plays in the carnage. However, even if one is amused by over-the-top gratuitous violence, then this amusement actually undercuts the horror at the evil plot and the horror at Firth's involvement. So, the audience is not meant to feel horror? What then? Pure shock is not enough to motivate any kind of investment in these characters. It should also be mentioned that each scene of mass gratuitous violence is also accompanied by a high-energy rock soundtrack so that by the end your adrenaline is pumping, but you are not quite sure why or to what end. And this is the feeling that remains as the film winds its way to a bloody close. By the ending, not many are left standing and one is not quite sure how to feel about those who remain.

And then, let us not forget the way women are portrayed in the film. There is the fierce henchman to Jackson's villain. She is indeed unique and fearless, but she is the villain's infatuated lap dog. And then there is Egerton's chief rival during training. She is generally brave, but what is the one thing we remember about her? She is terrified of heights and must actually be saved by Egerton during a training exercise. Arguably she does defy her fear and help bring about victory in the end, but this is only with the help of plenty of coaching from her male counterparts. And let us not forget the random nude moment at the end of the film. The brave woman, one of the few who actually stood up to the villain, and was imprisoned for her defiance actually begs to be rescued by young Egerton. His reward for saving her? Her body, of course.

On the whole, I found nothing compelling about this film. As someone who loves action spy films, I desperately wanted to like it. I must say, I was certainly unpleasantly surprised.",1435536000,3,4433,4.730918499353169

6945294,5,B00S1ITA2W,"This was the best movie of 2015 so far.  I wish I had the energy to write a meaningful review.

There were so many things to like but it all starts with Jack Davenport as the suave, fearless Lancelot saving a kidnapped professor (played by a hilariously mild-mannered Mark Hammill) -- almost.

Then Samuel L. Jackson arrives on the scene as the very antithesis of his usual self.  Buttoned-down, playful even.  And the most dangerous man in the world.

If I have any objections to the film it is this:  There is a wonderful character who also competes to become one of the Kingsman named Roxanne.  Although she has an important part in the movie, she is ultimately not the movie's star.  And that's okay, but her supporting role was terrific and I wish it was even more.

The first half seemed moderately normal... a British spy movie with a crazy, money-is-no-object villain in Samuel L. Jackson and his strange, female sidekick with the very creative, very deadly prosthetic legs.  But, Jackson's character was so far-fetched that it was unbelievable.  His character's rationale for his evil plot made almost no sense.  He and Colin Firth just seemed awkward together and the story started to take a bizarre turn.  The ""fight scenes"" seemed very Quentin Tarantino-like.  Very graphic and overly choreographed.  When the film got over, my immediate reaction was ""That was weird.""

The acting is very good and entertaining for the most part.  The church scene was stylistic and well done, but very unfortunate in the light of the Charleston massacre of nine unarmed Black Americans at a prayer meeting.  Very unfortunate timing.  Sad. This is entertainment for a gun culture.  It was sad to see Samuel L. Jackson trotted out again by Hollywood as the Black boogeyman.  He is a talented actor and I am frankly very, very tired of it. He deserves real roles. That one of the main characters in the Kingsman was also the lead in the Kings Speech was also funny to me.  There are several clever tongue in cheek high moments.  I also liked the assistant with the crazy legs, and the Matrix style fighting.  I found blowing up heads disturbing with all that is going on with ISIS. It is action packed. I don't understand anyone who says they were bored.

Not sure I liked that Samuel Jackson had a lisp as a villain. I couldn't really take him seriously as being evil which I'm sure was for comedic effect.,1435363200,,276,4.226415094339623

6945506,1,B00S1ITA2W,"I was so excited to watch this and couldn't have been more disappointed. I really like Colin Firth as an actor, but this was bad enough to make me think twice about watching him in the future.
If you like the ""F"" word, you'll love this movie. It's used so frequently that if you edit it out of the script the movie would be about 20 minutes shorter. It's everywhere and used to describe everything. It made the movie boring because you didn't have to wonder at all what every other word out of the actor's mouths was going to be.
The plot was shallow, sort of like a rip off the Bond movies with an attempt at humor that came off as very childish. So easy to figure out that it wouldn't fall into a mystery category, humor so lame it shouldn't fall into the Comedy category, and so littered with bad language that it felt like watching a crappy 'B' movie. The still shot style action sequences were no help to the 'B' movie feel either.
AND then they completely ruined the entire experience with the princess telling the hero that if he can save the world he can 'f' her in the 'a'. Seriously. Then it shows him coming up behind her (naked of course) leaving NO doubt about what is going on.
What the heck? That's not funny. It's not entertainment. Basically, it skirts the edge of pornography.
I wish Holywood would make some decent movies without all the bad language, sex scenes, and bull crap. It IS possible to tell a story without all of that and have it be successful!  Take a lesson from 'Lord of the Rings' and 'Avatar', please.",1435363200,6,1537,4.355400696864112

6945517,1,B00S1ITA2W,"This movie had potential. The concept of super highly trained agents with high tech gadgets was cool. However, the filmmakers chose to give this film a trashy edge with rampant profanity and a very inappropriate/inaccurate stereotypical portrayal of a southern church. Look at the response of the survivors of the Charleston church shooting. They forgave the shooter to his face the very next day. That is what true southern Christianity is all about.

A couple parts are a little on the whack side (sort of ""Kill Bill""-ish), but they totally fit the plot and we found ourselves laughing, although a bit guiltily b/c it's really not an appropriate thing to laugh about, but it was so unexpected.  Very creative, imaginative, and clever.  That one part is a teensy weensy bit on the sicko side, but just plain funny!!!  (Sort of slapstick on steroids is the best example I can think of...you know, Mo pokes Curly in the eye.)  Interestingly, this is also an important social commentary that has a not-so-farfetched prediction for a possible future.  A wide-scale free offer is made for something and, without a second thought, people line up in droves to get this free offer.  But...beware...there's no such thing as a free lunch!  Lest I give away too much, I won't say more except to repeat...we love this movie.  We found it very entertaining.  But, definitely not for kids, and probably not right-wingers either.

Coliln Firth's character is well played if written too shallow to reach Firth's deeper expressive capacity.  Samuel Jackson's horsepower is also a bit shallow, though the problem there is the design of the character - just a bit too idiosyncratic - lisp, titled hat, etc.  Michael Keaton's talents are much deeper than the narrow role requires, and it is hard to buy him as an ultimately evil or devious character in an action film (not so in a more realistic drama).

6945610,3,B00S1ITA2W,A Very tongue in cheek knock off of James Bond . However i was amazed the captive Swedish Pricess offered anal pleasues to the hero as an incetive for a rescue. Never in my born days would i have ever dreamed to see such blatant sexual come on's in a not porn movie not to mention the F word sprayed through out the movie at least 147 times. This movie stands in testimony to the how far will they go where the actors still have their clothes on.

6945633,1,B00S1ITA2W,"What looked like a great Bond-esque Movie, turned out to be epically odd.  The framework was there for a great movie, then the writers went this way ...
The world has a virus and humans are the cause, so all the common people must be killed off (while saving the rich & powerful government & business leaders).  Samuel Jackson, playing a rich cyber brainiac with a speech impediment, gives away free cell phones to the whole world's middle & lower class populations, which take over their mind, driving them to brutally kill everyone nearby (men, women & children - sticks, hatchets, knives, broken furniture, etc.) in scene after scene.  See how fun this is already?
Colin Firth is a ""Kingsman"" - King Arthur's table meets James Bond wanna-be - protecting the world ... until Jackson takes over HIS mind.  They picked a great place for Firth to get mind-hijacked and killed by Jackson ... he's sent into an American Christian Church where the pastor & congregation wildly reviled blacks, homosexuals, abortionists and whatever else they could stereotype about hate-filled Christians - then Colin and the whole congregation beat the s&^% out of each other - killing everyone in the room with close up, stop-action views of a hundred middle class, white Christians beating, impaling & shooting each other to death.  Great job by the writers. Colin Firth is the only one left in the sanctuary, walks out and Jackson kills him in front of the church.
In the end, a new, young Kingsman saves the day when he stops Jackson from taking over the whole world's minds - but you do get to watch several global outbreaks of crowds of men & women beating each other up to great music before he's stopped. As an added bonus, all those rich & powerful people that were going to rule ... everyone of their heads is blown off by a neck implant that Jackson had injected, with each one exploding in a fireworks blast that lit up this cinematic jewel ... except for their dead, decapitated bodies strewn in every fancy ballroom and government safe room around the world.
The mom breaking thru the door with a hatchet to kill her baby kind of summed it up.  In the category of not-as-stated-in-the-brochure.  Frustrating when they implied a very different kind of movie.",1435363200,36,2251,4.756410256410256

6945752,5,B00S1ITA2W,"This movie may be dressed in classy regal attire, but it moves as a very outrageous and rebellious romp. While the familiar premise of an elite set of dapper spies battling world domination might be the most overplayed setting in all of films, this film is happy to both build on the genres strengths while gleefully subverting its various clichs. Though ostensibly an entrant in the action genre, the film also plays as a terrific black comedy, which a variety of hysterical jokes which often dance into provocatively offensive material.

The actors are all top-notch, from Oscar-winning veterans to the fresh-faced youngsters. So while the leads are basically teenagers, the filmmakers thankfully ignored the primness and safety of a PG-13 presentation to give the viewer an unabashed and adult take, featuring the crudest language  and bloodiest violence despite the characters young age. Filmed with striking panache, the film uses a variety of innovations in filming its fights - from nouveau angles, shifting editing rhythms, and graceful camera motions - so every skirmish has a refreshingly cool feel. And despite the common story, the plotting is simply fantastic, with a slew of beautiful tricks and turns to shock the most seasoned filmgoer.

Jackson seemed gratuitous in the role and even though other reviews remarked on his ""lisp"", his delivery was unremarkable and extremely unbelievable.  Colin Firth, on the other hand, was fabulous in this role partly because it is so out of character for him to play it.  The young acolyte also did not seem very suited to his role and the plot left out large portions of his development so that it seemed strange to have him go from a know-nothing loser to an expert Secret Service Agent.  First he can barely speak the King's English and the next moment he is a suave gentleman convincing an upper crust party that he is uber-rich.  OK, let's go with it anyway because the result is so much fun.

The A-list cast manages to deliver a good performance without taking things too seriously or treating it as a throw-away. One thing that I really appreciate about the film is that for once, the female characters are not simply ""female characters.""

The film didn't know what it wanted to be, and it fluctuated between being a comedy, a drama, and an homage to secret agent movies. On top of this, it made the terrible decision to use EXTREME, OVER-THE-TOP violence that disgusted me because it was clearly gratuitous. I have no problem with violence that serves the story; this was just killing--almost like violence porn. AND whoever decided to make Samuel Jackson talk with a lisp should be fired. if the movie hadn't already been bad, this would have ruined it.

But about half-way through the film, Kingsman seems to have run out of funding.  As a result, the last half of the film seems suddenly rushed;  some story threads seem to go nowhere while other plot elements arise without any context.  Excellent actors; weak story line; inconsistent production values.",1435276800,,442,5.069444444444445

I am a James Bond fan, and typically enjoy spy movies. I am overall upset that the Bond franchise has degraded itself in recent years, so the concept of returning the British spies back to gentlemen was welcomed.

This is one of the more fun movies I've seen. While long, I found myself wishing it were actually longer. You don't really notice that you've been watching for over two hours because the action is always there and the wit is omnipresent. Plus, you have Samuel L. Jackson playing a typical Samuel L.

6946144,1,B00S1ITA2W,"The trailers made the movie out to be much more, much better, more professional than the film turned out to be.

The base story... hyper-secret agency w/seemingly unlimited funding but exceedingly few assets w/an intelligence branch consisting of one individual who also splits time as super bass ass spy trainer & super bad ass tech developer... we've seen in film 100x already but I was hoping for more or something different.

Film makers don't have to fly very high to go over the heads of many movie viewers.  But while experiencing the age of greatest disparity between rich & poor when the power elites continue electing themselves to office, creating policy that ever sweetens their positions v. anyone else's.

Low points of movie for me besides the movie itself...
Michael Caine, was he bored, offered a pile of cash for roughly > 10 lines.

They call themselves Knights, fair enough, however going w/the whole King Arthur, Merlin & Knights of the Round table but their table is rectangular not round.

The unrelenting digs about man made Global Warming.  As a society we are bombarded & bamboozled by this seemingly all encompassing hypothesis that unless so bombarded every 30 seconds we come to the realization it's an absurd one.  Were the Scientific Method allowed to play out w/o interference this would be evident.  The earth's interaction w/its environment or processes it follows is seldom given consideration.  People blame people b;c it gives a sense of control.  When the political-elite travel to Eviron Control of Humanity meet & scheme they fly private air, limousine travel, 5 Star hotels eating, wearing, doing anything.

The pushover evil Swedish PM ultimately justifies his decision b/c, ""What the hell, I'm a Republican!""  Funny... There is no Republican party in Sweden.

Then there's the whole bad (good) guy's intended result... In order to save the earth he wants commit genocide on a scale that make Mao & Stalin look like school yard bullies. Yet, this very scenario is exactly what is considered by the political-elites.

Finally, the hate group to be murdered wholesale.  It didn't take a rocket scientist to suppose these evil, maniacal people would be portrayed as the only socially accepted ones... redneck Christians.  I always find this curious b/c obviously there are religious movement based solely on hate domestically or otherwise that do a far better job of such things & seek to make them public.

It played to all the prevailing stereotype or such as pushed down our throats, otherwise, plot was predictable, a couple famous famed actors w/a few minutes to give it legitimacy.  Railroad Man & Alfred should be ashamed.",1435190400,,2668,5.0364464692482915

6946148,1,B00S1ITA2W,"Rarely have I seen a movie so full of acting potential that ended up being so completely wasted. Colin Firth should be ashamed of himself for ""acting"" in this excuse of a film.

I get the uber-violence genre. It worked in Kick Ass, it worked in The Hills Have Eyes. In this movie, it was just gratuitous and unnecessary. To be honest, it made Kick Ass 2 look like the Sound of Music.

I went to the movie with my wife and two friends. They sat through it; I didn't. About half an hour before it ended, I walked out, found the movie theater's manager, told him some little 5-year old kid was running up and down the isle squealing in delight while people were being butchered on screen and his parents were too busy taking selfies in the front row to notice (no joke, this actually happened - the mother was wearing a burka, so I can't say exactly how the selfies turned out, but they DID use a flash). An usher was immediately dispatched and the family was escorted from the theater. Apparently, they'd been there for 6 hours, slipping in and out of different movies all day.

Now you'd think that THIS was what got me to walk out, but I can assure you, it wasn't. It was the asinine dialogue (Sam Jackson's lisp was supposed to improve his character HOW?!), the poor attempt at acting (a miserable failure, by the way, from whom some people consider the great actors of our time,) the unrelenting noise and violence, editing snafus, ridiculous attempts at character development, the complete inability for me to experience suspension of disbelief, the sad attempts at manufactured pathos... they all conspired to make me give up on this film before I lost any more brain cells.  I later discovered that soon after I left the theatre, the princess gave up her rectum to the protagonist for his heroic efforts to help her escape.  Thanks Britain.  You suck.

My ticket was refunded by an apologetic manager. I told him it wasn't his fault that the British film industry lost its ability to produce anything that isn't crap. For what it's worth, he agreed.

I know there are a lot of 12 year old reviewers who are going to disagree with my review. But as someone who's been going to the movies once every few weeks for over 40 years, this was hands-down one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen some serious junk.",1435190400,,2324,4.503562945368171

It may be suited for adolescent boys who love to hear talk about men's balls, blowing massive numbers of peoples' heads off (in graphic detail...!!!), among many other truly disgusting details of graphic violence.

6946157,4,B00S1ITA2W,"Theres no doubt about it, this movie is action packed and graced with an above-average script.

This movie is about the espionage exploits of the young protagonist (Taron Egerton), taken from the streets of London and recruited to a top-secret branch of MI5. Or is MI6? No matter, its a super secret spy agency that no ones heard about. The father of the young recruit was a member of this spy agency and is recruited by his colleague (Colin Firth). After a rigorous training period he out-performs the other, more privileged, candidates from Eaton and Cambridge. After joining the agency the movie centers on the recruit saving the world from a mad entrepreneur out to destroy the world with implanted SIM cards (Samuel Jackson). Dont worry, this young recruit saves the world, alright.

Giving you this plot does not spoil the movie. The movie is not about plot or even character development, although the characters in this movie are more fully dimensional than other action film.

No, this movie is about ACTION, and there is plenty of  that in this movie. It is also the movie greatest drawback. Once an action scene begins, it turns into less of a movie and more into a video game.  Scores of bad guys (or in one scene, good guys) are massacred in break-neck speed. Matthew Vaughn, the director, is a pioneer in what it known as Hyper-Link Cinema, a film style intermeshing several related stories. In the effort to link these different stories within the space of a movie, the pace of hyper-link films are in hyper speed as well. So is the pace of this film. Add to this the computer- enhanced and computer-generated imagery, the movie becomes a real light show, with absolutely dazzling colors, but at times a little distracting. In these and other parts, the movie becomes a video game.

Still, as action movies go, Kingsman is very enjoyable and serves its purpose. I have given this movie four stars because it is not possible to rate with four and a half, which would be my rating. It does not waste the acting talents of Firth, Jackson or Michael Caine, who plays the chief of the agency.

6946176,3,B00S1ITA2W,"This movie is the definition of a mixed bag. Some scenes were brilliant with nice acting, wit, action, and great camerawork. Other scenes were downright goofy and took you out of the experience.

It makes no secret of being inspired by old Bond films, and trying to capture their fun old school style, rather than being overly serious. In fact, it blatantly says in one scene, as if we couldn't figure it out ourselves. The old Bond film standbys are all there. A villain with an absurd plan that threatens the world, an evil henchman with a badass and unique weapon of choice, over the top spy gadgets and weapons, a secret lair filled with minions who are all dressed the same, spies who are dapper British gentlemen with style and flare, and *SPOILER* even the ending scene (though more vulgar) ends like an old Bond film would with the hero having a celebratory role in the hay.

The problem is, while the first two acts of the film seemed to be aspiring to be Goldfinger quality, the third act is more like Moonraker quality. There was particularly a scene with heads exploding that ended up more like a 4th of July fireworks display with cheesy colorful effects. Something that was also bothersome was dozens of guards shooting automatic weapons at a guy running down a narrow hallway and not even hitting their target let alone killing him (while you can suspend belief, this was a bit much). This film was constantly walking a fine line between stylish and goofy, and unfortunately sometimes it was too much of the latter. But when it's on, boy is it on. It's definitely worth a watch.

I liked the gadgets and the skydive part was fun.

One of the most disturbing scenes in it where a church was mocked, and a paster mockingly (seriously for the movie=?=) proclaimed hatred on Jews, homosexuals, and other groups.  The church under the control of a device that causes violence, destroyed itself with help from the main character.  The movie showed the church as a place of hate and intolerance.  I wonder if there is a lot more to come from Mr. Director??  Makes me wonder about the mindset the person had for the Charleston shooting.

6946230,2,B00S1ITA2W,"My husband and I chose to watch this movie to rid ourselves of the Sunday evening doldrums. We thought this would be a light-hearted choice and really wanted to like this movie!
  a) We like spy movies and spoofs. There are lots of references for the aficionados.
  b) Who doesn't love Mr. Darcy, aka Colin Firth?
  c) The cast includes a female spy and hard core villainess with a physical disability and prosthetic legs. And these women are not merely love interests or sex symbols but have arcs of their own.
  d) There are well filmed fighting scenes without distracting cutaways.
  e) The special effects used for the exploding head sequence were cool.
  f) Puppies!!!
  g) And, of course, there are sweet gadgets.

You may wonder then why we rated the movie so poorly. It seems from the list above that there are plenty of reasons to like it, right? Well, once the editorializing started, it couldn't be stopped.
  a) The pass code Eggsy was supposed to remember, associated with the talisman given to him by Harry Hart/Galahad, was NOT understandable. (By the way, it's ""Oxfords, not brogues."")
  b) The persons of color were cast as a megalomaniac and his henchwoman (i.e., Valentine and Gazelle).
  c) Samuel L. Jackson's lisp was inconsistent.
  d) It is hard to believe that Harry's gentlemanly character would say, ""One does not pop one's cherry in dressing room two.""

But it is in the second half of the film that things turn especially offensive and vulgar...
  e) The church scene, in which the Southern preacher spews hatred towards minority groups, was especially hard to watch in the wake of the mass shooting in Charleston.
  f) Princess Tilde of Sweden unexepectedly offers Eggsy a sex reward if he rescues her. (What?!) Why degrade a female head of state to a sex object?
  g) After Eggsy saves the world, he grabs a bottle of champagne and two glasses and runs into Princess Tilde's cell so they can ""do it in the *******.""  (Screen shot of a female bottom.)  This really ruins Eggsy's transformation into a gentleman knight. ""Manners maketh man."" If the audience is to believe Eggsy is capable of becoming the virtuous and pure Galahad, then we would not expect him to ask for and accept a reward for saving someone and doing the right thing.

All this to say, don't waste your Sunday evening and $4.99 on this movie!  Note: the movie is rated R; don't let your kids watch it.",1434931200,,2400,4.689903846153846

Hundreds of men, women, and children are brutally beaten to death, decapitated, and stabbed to death in this movie. Dozens of limbs are chopped off in brutal ways. The only reason this movie is not rated 'X' is because they did not show the gallons of blood that would have gushed across the room if this was realistic brutality. Instead, a few drops of CGI blood fly up into the air as each limb or neck is severed.

This is not a ""fun"" or ""funny"" movie. If I had known this was going to be ""Kill Bill 3"", I might have liked the movie more.

6946247,3,B00S1ITA2W,I'm can sum up this movie pretty easily.  It was really entertaining until the heads started exploding.  That was just stupid how it was portrayed  Then it was pretty much ruined by the poor taste of showing the princess naked from the rear.  Horrible decision by the director just to get a flash of nudity in.,1434931200,,310,4.482142857142857

The fact that the company attempts to make it a lighthearted/funny thing with catchy music is pretty bad, and then we wonder why our young people are so violent nowadays.

(1) The gratuitous violence of the fight scene in the church. It wasn't necessary AT ALL to show that much detail and actually took away from the gravity of the scene. It would have been much better to cut the majority of it out, showing the lead-in and the aftermath.
(2) The final scene discussing what the princess was going to allow him to do to her and then the shot of her ""in position"" to do it...

The director should have taken a lesson from the original James Bond movies and kept it a little classier.",1434931200,,684,4.253846153846154

Apparently, noone mentioned the fact the this movie promotes the outright slaughter of Christians. Yeah, i know they do alot of things to make fun of, but the scene in which they are gratuitously slaugthered and slaughter each other is way too much. And in light of the recent events in Charleston, one has to ask,  is this type of movie good for society or bad. I chose the later. And i will not recommend this movie to anyone. Shame on you directors, producers and actors who promote this persecution of Christians out of one side and then denounce violence out of the other side.

When I saw the church scene, I knew some idiot somewhere would imitate it, and it happened. And that's disgusting. I wish Hollywood would recognize where to draw the line when they know as well as anyone with common sense that there are disturbed people out there who are going to take what they see and imitate it in real life. Although it's not Hollywood's responsibility on the one hand, wouldn't it bring about much more praise and respect for the industry if Hollywood/film makers would stop short of asinine scenes like that?! The directors, producers, writers, actors DO have common sense. It got them where they are today. So they know as well as I do that when they see, read, write a scene like that, it's going to cause REAL people SOMEWHERE to LOSE THEIR LIVES.

About halfway through the movie there's a tasteless and graphic scene where Colin Firth's character shoots up a church full of people.

6946339,4,B00S1ITA2W,"For the first third of the film I was thinking that this was going to be a poorly constructed & written Bond ripoff with lots of formula action & stereotyping of characters. Supporting that thought was the eye candy and famous name selection of actors, who seemed to fulfill the above formula/stereotyping school-of-acting technique admirably.
But then the comic book character spoofing began to emerge that first came with force with a church scene, so outrageous, that I had to cringingly watch again, just to confirm what I was seeing. Eggsy was responsible for about 60 departed poor souls (well they were haters supreme) within the house-of-the-lord no less, and another 40 or so despatched by fellow church going haters. Add another 100 or so elsewhere and  Eggsy surpasses ""John Wick"" for one person personally sending baddies off to another (better?) life. There was another film, a few years back, of someone cleaning up a semi-abandoned ""Projects"" development of druggies, but I can't remember the title. That one had similar outrageous numbers.
Finally, the coup de grce, was the July 4 fireworks, with appropriate musical overtures, of the security exploding heads. Disgustingly outrageous.

The plot felt like something to bind the characters but didn't. It's not a spy movie, but it wants to be. It's not appropriate for teens and younger because of the level of violence (stabbing, beating, shooting, guts, blood among families, women, elderly, all church attendees -- in a solid 5 minutes of filming conveying nothing but straight gore done to Lynard Skynard's 'Freebird') and the ending that closes in on a teen girl's bare bottom with the offer to the hero to 'do her in the a$$' in exchange for 'saving the world'.

From the previews, we were expecting something akin to James Bond meets Get Smart - we weren't expecting it to be completely realistic, but this was ridiculous in the extreme. While I can appreciate the impact of a well placed expletive, the gratuitous dropping of the F-bomb was not only distracting, it made the characters seem shallow and too stupid to come up with something intelligent to say.

Great special effects are seamlessly blended into an outrageous plot, combined with a collection of decent actors and interesting backgrounds.  The work that Colin Firth had to put in to do his parts, was truly amazing to see.  Yup, he runs through most of the dance-of-death fight scenes himself, with minimal assistance from stunt guys.  The only aspect of the movie that I found difficult was the speech patterns.  There are some highly colloquial English accents spoken throughout the film, making me wish I'd turned on CC.  The evil badass bitch with swords for lower legs is athletic and graceful to watch her in action and even just walking around scenes.

This movie stuttered along, it wasn't a smooth ride, and it didn't carry the viewer. It was as if I were watching mini episodes of a show every five minutes. Definitely overrated.",1434585600,,334,4.87719298245614
6946472,3,B00S1ITA2W,"Like many quasi-comic spy films of recent years, The Kingsman is strongly influenced  by the early James Bond films.  Indeed, hero and villain ( Colin Firth and Samuel L. Jackson) wax whimsically about those films over dinner.  At various points, the film pokes fun at the conventions of the genre (the villain explaining his nefarious plan to the hero, etc.).  That is a perilous path to take, since previous homages and spoofs have covered the same territory.  The Kingsman does so with energy and panache, however, which excuses many sins.

There are strengths that are unique to this film as well: the entire issue of socio-economic class and what is meant by being a ""gentleman"" is dealt with here.  In the Bond era, such a touchy subject was strenuously avoided.  The importance of sartorial excellence comes front and center here.  Whereas James Bond dressed impeccably in tailored suits, his modern counterparts are an order of tailors-turned-spies.  It's a cute conceit that doesn't wear out with two hours of hard use.  The villain's plan is also intriguing; it brings up the linkage between climate change and overpopulation, a popular topic in the Seventies which people today have forgotten.  The latter has irritated many viewers who see the film as anti-environmentalist.  Their criticism is not without merit: many action films have cast environmentalists as villains in recent years.

My objections are based on the gore and foul language of the new film.  There have been films which mixed action, gore and satirical wit very well (1987's Robocop comes to mind), but the graphic violence here often feels gratuitous.  Whereas Bond villain Oddjob simply had to decapitate a statue for us to get the message, The Kingsman subjects us to the full treatment.  And, of course, F-bombs are everywhere.  When teens peel the paint off walls with their coarse language, remember cinematic influences like these.",1434585600,,1920,5.0993589743589745

But, it all blends together into something completely new and innovative. Also, great cast, this is the exception where casting and unknown was a great move! Colin Firth and Michael Caine were very good along with Samuel Jackson, who always seems to be more of a hero, villain, action type figure. In this one, he plays the villain, having a bit of a flaw, but coming off more funny sounding. First, saw it on paperview. But, was the first time it was worth paying $6 at a time for.

Also, there was a good instrumental score as well as the more comical picks for songs in the action scenes that were very animated instead of the dramatic, trite, slow motion, normally seen during a battle, fighting sequence. Also, great writing! The director produced it as well and the original writers wrote the screen play for this. It was really like a novel for the eye! It reminded me a bit of Bond, Avengers/Iron Man 3 as well as many other flicks, but at the same time truly original. Best I have seen since Now You See Me, The Adjustment Bureau and I wished I could've seen it in theater but it wasn't playing in a theater near us at the time. Missed opportunity if you don't see this one! In whatever form, rent it, buy it. All in all, best flick I have seen in a long time!",1434585600,,1427,4.344569288389513
6946500,1,B00S1ITA2W,"We have become a society where horrific, gruesome, violence is ""pure"" entertainment. (What just happened in the South Carolina church? That violence  will have us chasing our tails because we can't seem to accept the ""scripts"" of Life have been writing the story of this kind of heinous  mayhem for years in all these deranged individuals, long before they picked up a gun, or a hammer, an axe, or a knife, or a boxcutter. Would we have understood these problems more if Jonathan Kozol had been a  screenwriter?) Here again I blame the producers and most of all the writers. When I saw the ads for this movie it had star power that infers those actors accepted the veracity of the script. After seeing this bad graphic novel nightmare, I can only conclude it was another case of good actors making bad professional, moral and financial decisions. I don't know how any writer can justify so much violence, but then again, I can see if most of the violence was taken out, the writers would have to fill in the gaps and that might have meant an incomplete script; one that should have been shelved as nothing more than a good idea that needed work. Initially, I bought the diverse elements of the script: A seasoned secret agent has a protege caught in the cacophony of societal distractions. A friend honoring the loss of a Hero who also happened to be his friend, by casting a caring attachment to the son of his friend. An oath mandated through Duty and softened by friendship and Humanity. Honor our heroes and the children of our heroes. It was good up to those points but then the violence became a virus that destroyed the movie for me. How did the producers let this good idea for a movie slip away? I don't know; I guess the bottom-line has become more important than creative integrity. Mr. Firth was lucky in a sense in that the merciful shot to the chest ended his embarrassing involvement; but I guess it was another  case of ""too little, too late.""  Oh well, I can watch ""The King's Speech"" again. Maybe I should try that other movie, ""The Ipcress File.""",1434585600,4,2065,4.555256064690027

Standard story about a young man on the wrong side of the law- but not truly his fault- being recruited by a super secret spy organization.

Yes, at times, there are bits of undue silliness, like Samuel Jackson's ridiculous Mike Tyson-like lisp, as well as the colorful Disney-ish head explosions. But, there is a solid story here with a great ending and a cool after credits stinger. If you like Mission Impossible, The Borne Identity, Triple X, and even Men In Black, then this movie is for you.

The few good action sequences did not make up for the vast wasteland of pathetic f-bomb infested dialog and unnecessarily offensive scenes. While the killing was done to protect the public--for the greater good--as is expected in this type of film, the crudeness was not required. Just putting a character into a suit and saying (endlessly) that he is gentlemanly does not make it so. Hard to believe that actors of this caliber would associate themselves with this film.

They took farce too far, however, ruining the movie with an overkill of violence, extending violent scenes beyond farcical entertainment so they ceased to have that fun impact. Even worse, attempts to spoof the sexual element of generic spy movies lacked any sort of taste or intelligent playfulness, opting instead for direct sexual exploitation that borders on porn. What could have been an above average, fun movie ended up feeling more like an insult to the intelligence of the viewers, needlessly overlapping into a spoof of horror flicks and porn as if that is all that drives our interest.

6946609,1,B00S1ITA2W,"Horrible.  Don't see this.

Check the other reviews (even the positive ones) if you don't believe me: this is a film that focuses on over-the-top violence and gore.  There are definitely people out there who are into this sort of thing and they love this film.  But I suspect most people will find the violence somewhere between off-putting and offensive, especially since it is presented as fun.

There is a flimsy plot that attempts to provide a weak morality tale, and occasionally tries to justify the massive amounts of bloodshed.  But it is a bogus plot that really just allows the filmmakers to get as much violence and gore on the screen as possible, in all the slo-mo CGI glory that they could muster.  I made it through until around the last 10 minutes or so, when I had to stop.  The violence, sexism, and general unbelievability hit a crescendo at this point and made it impossible for me to continue.

I'm somewhat bitter because I was fooled into watching this by looking at the generally positive reviews here on Amazon and IMDB.  As usual, Metacritic was a better guide (this film has a relatively low 58/100 score there, although I still find that surprisingly high).  Don't make my mistake.

6946615,5,B00S1ITA2W,"Very entertaining good-humored espionage thriller. While I enjoy watching Colin Firth in any role (anytime-anywhere), this one was particularly delightful. He has great fighting scenes that left me in awe.
I found the director's style unique, clever and engaging leaving NO dull moment throughout the entire movie. The visual effects are flawless - particularly ANY scene with Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) and her CGI prosthetic legs/blades.
While the plot might not be the most elaborate nor unpredictable one, it is not utterly vapid. I think that underneath the improbabilities there are some poignant social commentaries that may cause you to think for a second or two. The cast/acting is spectacular, from your Hollywood royalty: Firth, Jackson and Caine, to the less known names like Taron Egerton or Sofia Boutella.

Are they only ones who know the ""Kings"" English?  When a movie uses the ""F"" word (and other cuss words) says a lot about the vocabulary knowledge of the writers.  This movie has so much ""F"" bombs that I had to drop it 2 stars.  Then the ending of a naked ""Royalty"" butt was a poor way to copy the ending a James Bond movie, so lost another star.  The ""Church"" in the movie sadly has some reality that there are some churches like that but they do state it is a fringe church .... but still anti-Christian theme to it.  The writers should have known that these type of fringe (like Westboro) that would not need the phone app to make them aggressive, they already are.  It is a ""Spy"" movie so people should not be upset about the head explosions, and people being cut in half.  There is a lot of ""Blowing up of head but most of the time that is not done in a gory way ... more like a fireworks. The person who is cut in half is closer to the scene in MIB 2 where the pizza owner is deflated then what it would have looked like in real gory.  I have been in combat, and have seen body explosions and none of the really come close ... but there are a couple of times it is gory, but barely realistic.

Some good elements, but I would NOT recommend it - the sexual scenes were so ridiculously out of place and raunchy. The violence was gratuitous, Samuel L. Jackson... Oh, he just dropped so many rungs on my 'classy actors' list.

Any movie that imagines that select members of the British aristocracy would team up to do anything for anyone else is suspect. But when President Obama is depicted as a villain whose head explodes, you really have to wonder about the mental state of the filmmakers. Add to that a very formulaic plot- young guy with no clue saves the world after old guys screw up- and you've got a movie only a Fox News fan could appreciate.

Samuel L. Jackson is terrific in an unusual role; Michael Caine has come a long way from ""Alfie.""  Colin Firth is suave as ever.  Taron Eggerton is a great ""new kid.""

As we all know, sometimes a movie is so bad, that we actually get buyer's (or renter's) remorseeven for $5! I am happy to report that this is not one of those movies. It is entertaining, mildly original and worth a look/watch. If you are a spy/espionage/action nut, you will enjoy this movie. Will it win an Oscarno, but that is not what this movie is about, so don't expect ""Schindler's List"", ""The Piano"" or any other experience where depth, 'artiness' and induced introspection are requisite components.

I do have to say Samual L Jackson with a lisp is completely annoying and had nothing to do with the movie at all and would have made the movie possibly 4 stars just due to easier flow and understanding of what is being said. Seeing the previews I thought this was a teen movie but it earned its R rating with pointless things like a princess telling a boy ""If you save the world you can do my a$$ hole"" how that fits anywhere in the movie is beyond me.

It has a good beginning but the longer it played it became more and more stupid, crude and the storyline fell apart leaving a very bad taste in the mouth.  I hated that the ""F"" bomb was used an insane number of times, the dialogue was pathetically bad and depraved.  I should have turned it off after the first 15 minutes, but was hopeful it would turn out to be an enjoyable movie, how foolish I was to keep on watching.  This film and the actors sucked.  Shame on Colin Firth being apart of something so poorly put together.  Samuel Jackson was his usual fowl-mouthed aggressive self, not a good character role for him even.

This film has something for everyone, good storyline, comedy, drama and did I mention action. There is slight similarities to 007 but that ends with the gadgets. This is more light hearted and less intense than James Bond and I own the entire 007 collection, but this is a fun movie. I saw this in the theatre and I was waiting for the DVD as soon as I left the theatre. There is no doubt that you will want to watch this more than once. I don't think I would call this a family friendly film because of the domestic violence and very brief nudity at the very end just before the credits. But for teenagers and up this can be pure entertainment for boys and girls. The actors all did a very good job, Colin Firth, Michael Caine, Samuel L. Jackson and the young man Jack Davenport. If you have read my previous reviews you know that I dislike action/comedies but this is truly an exception, mainly because this film separates the action from the comedy which I enjoy.

6946833,3,B00S1ITA2W,"mainly because (1) music: instead of augmenting the story it got in the way of or competed with it. Music was just too loud and intrusive. Whoever chose the music would've been well served in viewing Philomenia, starring Judy Dench. The music in that film supported the film's story. I actually turned the sound off here because I couldn't stand the music and read alot of dialogue off the subtitles; and (2) villain. I love the actor's work who plays the villain but the story presentation of the villain, i.e., the amount of time it took for the story to reveal what the villain was up to, didn't work for me. I don't like silly, light weight villains. I want my villain scary and impressive, so this villain's goofy hat and behavior were off putting. What he wanted to accomplish was different and interesting for a villain but essentially it was villainous enough to qualify as villainy in that he wanted to kill a whole lot of innocent people, but he was too hands off until the end, and I'm not talking simply about violence. This villain did alot of delegating - not scary. It reminds me of the old 70s television shows where the african american actor was cast as supervisor, but we never saw him in the field actually doing the work. No that was up to the handsome young studs or gorgeous model types, usually caucasian.  Or take the original Star Wars for a different type of example: what if the head Empire guy merely told everyone what to do but hadn't actually given the order to destroy the planet. To be a villain he and the Empire had to do something and they had to do it early enough in the story to give the heros something to do and something for the audience to worry about after they'd been captured. The villain's reveal in Kingsman, his game plan, comes too late and there simply wasn't enough time to develop the audience fear of him because the heros/heroine were crowding him out with their work in the story's finale. So the writers didn't know how to shape their story. Finally I didn't care for the foul language used by multiple characters. Lots of f* bombs that I thought could've been omitted and which added nothing to the film. I give it 2 and a half stars but as there's no half button I'll go up to 3. Love so many of the well known actors here, the 3 top guys are amongst my favorites (Colin Firth, Michael Caine and Samuel L. Jackson), and the less well known actors/actresses are outstanding as well. Film's strength is the acting. P.S. It's surprising with so much real-world villainy that Hollywood keeps getting film villains wrong. In my opinion, it's not that hard. She/he needs to be smart, their intelligence needs to be a demonstrated part of the story, and I'm don't mean the bad work they're doing, they need to be successful problem solvers, and a cut above the rest on their team.  This needs to be a part of the story, not discussed amongst the characters. In fact, it shouldn't be discussed at all, no character should be saying how smart, how bad, how blah blah blah another character is: it should be shown in the story. In this sense, the villain owns the story and this is why Hollywood gets it wrong - they're usually selling the hero/heroine, but they should be selling the villain, because it's what she/he is doing that justifies ordinary people giving their time and their earnings to sit and watch some moron character misbehave for a couple hours. It's not the hero/heroine getting the audience to the theater seats, it's the villain. That's why horror films continue to make money. The best films with the strongest villain should be a career maker for the actress/actor playing it. Another mistake: Hollywood most often has other characters discuss how smart the villain is but it's hardly ever proven to the audience. The villain needs to do some actual villainy, and not in the final third of the film: that section is where the heroine or hero comes to the rescue. No, the villain needs to dominate in Acts I and II. In Kingsman the villain's work was too coyly presented by the writers/editor so we didn't know what he was doing until Act III. This was a mistake because we, the audience, had no time to fear the villain. It's much better for the audience to fear the villain, so when she/he is defeated, we feel a sense of relief. In Kingsman, we assumed the villain was up to no good but we didn't know what and so impossible to take him seriously. (As an aside, Kingsman was supposedly a top flight secret service agency but the villain wasn't really on their radar, which means they had the secret service toys (weapons), and were decent at hand to hand combat, but they weren't really on their game here, as they were caught flat footed and the head of their agency compromised.) Finally, the villain needs a skill set pop, she/he needs to be able to do other things other characters in the story can't. The villain in this story is smart, if you consider murdering billions of people smart, which I don't but at least one other lead character referred to him as being so (or referred to him as impressive in some other way). Just because he supposedly had the technical prowess, finances and marketing ability to kill billions didn't make him smart and I think it was a mistake to have a major character refer to him positively - that dialogue should've been deleted or edited out because the audience relies on characters to steer them in the right way with regards to other characters, and it's not good for a major character to refer at an earlier point in the story to the villain in a positive way, only to spend the last third of the film trying to destroy him. Story is about trust for the audience. In the best films, it's actually the villain who gets the audience to invest emotionally, to care either way. The way the story presents her/him is crucial to the audience's ability to enjoy the film. A silly acting, foul mouthed, delegating, physically unimpressive villain, who another character says is smart, but who seems little more than a wealthy, first rate marketer, is not scary. The best film story is a proof. It proves why the villain is defeated, why the heroine/hero won and why we should care. If the storyteller doesn't know that that is her/his job, there's no way the story will be an emotional ride for the audience. The writers telling this story told their story poorly because they misunderstood the role of the villain. Maybe they'll do better next time. This film made so far about half a billion dollars, so they'll get more jobs and have the opportunity, hopefully, to improve. Just because the film made alot of money, which by the way I'm happy for them, doesn't mean the story is told well. The story is not told well, but whoever marketed it and packaged it and arranged the theater run deals, did an outstanding job. Hollywood is a great marketer, and nothing wrong with that. I just wish they told film stories as well as they market.",1434412800,,6952,4.5608

It's as predictable as a movie can get but the acting and action are still fun to watch. Don't expect any semblance of reality whatsoever and just suspend your disbelief or you will hate the movie. The film is quite a bit more crass and low brow than I was expecting and often resorted to ultra violent or heavy sexual humor to get a cheap laugh. That seemed out of place given the dramatic nature of the storyline and I was surprised that actors of that quality would let the director cheapen their work with such childish drivel. Regardless, the actors did a great job in their roles and thus the film is still something worth watching. The visual effects, stunts, sound design and music are all first class and it's clear that the film wasn't made on the cheap. I'd recommend the movie provided you understand going in that this isn't a serious drama but more of a comedic drama and spectacle film. Enjoy.",1434412800,,1018,4.508108108108108

It should be noted that saying ""F*ck"" over and over again, by all characters, does not constitute dialogue nor does it contribute to character development.  That's a shame, because this movie was a classic opportunity for some great repartee.  Also the constant switch to computer-generated fight scenes was distracting and eventually boring. I got the feeling that the writers and actors were too lazy to do a 'real' movie, so they shot this in the garage over the weekend.

It's a bit oddball, but the story is set in England, with many British actors, so you get a bit of that querky and strange British humor. But as the movie came towards the last quarter of the film... it got outlandish with its violence and crude sexual gratuity. There was no preparing for it. It came out of nowhere and it didn't even fit the flow of the film. It's like they through it in there for all the weirdos, perverts, and sexual deviants.

The fact that the dialogues are very casual and natural makes their interaction more engaging and realistic.  Great ultra violent action sequences.  The downside is the film seems to have a personality disorder, feels very disjointed...seemingly trying to be serious one moment and threw all of that out the window the next....but it really doesn't matter...I completely enjoyed it and it's highly re-watchable ...I just feel very engaged with the characters,  don't want any of them to disappear..",1434412800,,741,5.417391304347826

6946952,4,B00S1ITA2W,"a strange but enjoyable mix of Bond-style hokum which seems to be aimed at teens but the language and sexual references are very 'adult' which of course will appeal to teens and also non-prudish adults! To assess whether you'll like the humor, and understand why the language is so fruity, you should check out who co-wrote it - Jane Goldman, partner of Jonathan Ross (for US readers he's an irreverent British tv talent, who is usually pretty funny and close to the bone, for example he described Nigella Lawson in one of his chat shows as a MILF.) Goldman also co-wrote Kick-Ass so if you liked that you'll like this. Anyhow I digress. Good quality stars all playing predictably well within their range, and (spoiler) they all get killed off, which is sort of refreshing. The fight scenes are stylish (previous reference to Kill Bill in another review was spot on) and the female baddie Gazelle, side-kick of Samuel L Jackson's Bond villain, is an original.",1434412800,3,959,4.783132530120482

The Kingsman could have been its own thing, but instead, it constantly referenced James Bond and with a sad worshipfulness. Also: why Kingsman? Why not KingsMEN...you know, since there are more than one of them? Most disappointing of all was the scene of the film where a Scandinavian princess, locked in a posh cell, offers our hero butt sex if he'll return to rescue her. WHAT?!

Samuel Jackson overacted, as usual but suited the part of a crazed tech billionaire with a wacky final solution to all mankind's problems. In other words, get rid of mankind. Its fun. Nothing more nothing less. The class acts in the movie are Colin Firth and Michael Caine. They make acting seem effortless. However, Colin Firth makes the movie work, as he usually does.

6947100,4,B00S1ITA2W,"Matt Vaughn sure knows his market. If he's going for the ""young"" crowd- which he is,  the coveted 18-25 demographic, he places his shots well- the main character is an extremely athletic 4 percent bodyfat shiftless youth whose father was a military hero and whose  mother has become a welfare queen taking up with cruddy alpha male alcolholics. Unbeknownst to the teenage four percent bodyfat boy, who is largely defenseless and unantagonistic, his father created a debt that the ultra secret service is, through honourrrr, forced to replay. Cue the Korean style incredible fight scenes- and I mean incredible, although using Free Bird to choreograph one of them tarnishes the luster of a fine song. Overall, the stereotypes, plot twists and characters are predictable and cartoonish. In this age of short attention spans and snap judgments, the only way some messages can be sent are with a megaphone and a .38",1434412800,,911,5.026490066225166

In the film we are taught that ""Manners maketh the man"" and yet these people swear like sailors and have no qualms shooting their own dogs.  Wise up producers, a fresh haircut and Bespoke suit do not impart manners upon anyone.  Also, the grotesque level of gore was just completely unnecessary and detracted greatly from the film.  With regard to the killing of the dogs: the fact that they decided to have the recruit's final test being their willingness to kill their own companions conveys the utter cluelessness of the producers.  Shooting your own dog on command does not in any way show a person's courage but instead their lack of a soul.  Refusing to do this ought to have been the winning move not the losing one.  And lastly, a princess is being held in a prison cell and finally when someone comes to break her out you really expect us to believe that she first wants a round of anal sex?

6947349,4,B00S1ITA2W,"This movie did not catch my eye in the theatre, but I just viewed the Blu-Ray.  It has a good cast--some of the younger actors I didn't recognize; some of the older are well-known to me like Samuel Jackson, Michael Caine and Colin Firth.
  This is a British film, and while it seems to be going for a stylish and fast-paced spy action-comedy feel, to an American audience it may come across as somewhat more action and less comedic, as British comedy tends to be more subtle than American.  To a Brit I expect it looks a very good balance between comedic and action/suspense.  Part of the comedy involves the centuries-old dividing lines between classes in Great Britain.  The main character is working-class but ends up recruited into a very gentleman's spy society: The Kingsmen.  Clearly here, the first and most important part of being a world-class spy is to have a most excellent and proper accoutrement of clothing [parodying the long-standing James Bond look].  The film does what I thought were brief parodies, or at least nods to many other action films and media hits [the old Doom look here and there for example].  You may find it fun to see how many you spot.
Samuel Jackson plays an unlikely-looking villain: rather like a black Bill Gates, he became a multi-billionaire with a high-tech company, then founded a charitable organization focused on trying to stop global warming and ecosystem degradation.  After years of effort and much money spent, NOTHING had happened, so he concludes the only thing to do is ""cull the herd"" lest mankind wreck the planet and itself in uncontrolled population crash.  He gets to make some nice soliloquies as well as have some fun and I can just see him reading the script and thinking what a fun character this would be to play.  He of course has a beautiful but deadly side-kick....our young hero must both prove himself to the upper-class culture of the Kingsmen and save the world, simultaneously.  It's good fun, it's fast-paced, the visuals are impressive, there's no full-nudity (but there is some partial), there is not a lot of swearing, and there is frenetic violence in the fight scenes.  So frenetic they must have speeded up the playback a bit, and it doesn't seem so gory because you see each impact (bullet, blade, fist or whatever) for an instant and then its on to the next, and the next and the next, and you never dwell on goriness.  And some of these roles must have been a real bloody workout to perform, regardless of wire work, CGI, speeding up the playback--there had to be a lot of time spent choreographing it, and a lot of sweat put into being one of the agents.  If I have any disappointments, it's that it probably could have been shortened some 15 minutes without sacrificing the story, and that there was no blooper or gag reel (though there are deleted and extended scenes, a ""making of"", and of course a commentary track.
If you enjoy action-comedy, you should enjoy watching this Austin Powers on Ritalin.",1434326400,2,2989,4.719230769230769

We started pausing and talking about how many f words had been used and speculating over whether it was a bet, maybe the writer was getting paid for every f word used... The fight scenes look like dancing and you're wowed only to have heads exploding in multi-colored CGI fireworks. Then you had a totally unnecessary reference to sex in the a-hole and a nude shot of a woman's butt. It was like it was pasted in there for no purpose at all. No relationship with the characters, not part of a storyline.... It just took it down several pegs. It was almost like the first and second halves were done by different people. Lots of violence...

Now here is a good movie.  The character Eggsy was someone I could relate to immediately and the other characters are equally  developed as the movie progresses.  Sure, CGI is at a state of development that allows almost anything to be displayed in a movie but it doesn't make up for a weak script and characters that no one can relate to. What use are titanic explosions and mass destruction if the audience doesn't care about who it is happening to ?

I don't want to ruin the viewing experience for anyone so no spoilers but if you like action and characters that are more than cardboard cutouts, buy this movie.

6947382,2,B00S1ITA2W,"Not recommended - If you feel you have to watch it, I would rent, not buy this one.  This movie deserves three strikes. Strike one: The Kingsman redefines the term ""glorified violence"" - literally. You will witness bodies cut in half from head to toe, minus the blood, and hundreds of heads exploding in technicolor color like a fireworks show (not blood, literally a rainbow of colors). Some of the reviewers have unwittingly said it themselves - ""mindless fun"".
Strike two: the movie's purpose. Don't go looking for any message or morality tale here - the Kingsman is mindless entertainment. If there was a message here it would be what - Don't shoot your dog? Don't become a megalomaniac and take over the world through free cell phones? Do the right thing, even at other's expense? Become a silent hero so you can kill a church full of people turned into rage-aholics?
Strike three: I just gave it away - why a church? Nobody explains why the church was a target - is this a message from Hollywood? Or are we supposed to think that the bad guy picked a church because it would be the least violent setting for him to test his secret weapon on, turning it into a bloody free-for-all battle with weapons and bloodspatter? We will never know because the movie producers never bothered to come up with even a flimsy excuse; so again I ask was this a message from Hollywood - are they trying to put down Christianity? Why not a Mosque? Why not a Temple?
I can't recommend this for family viewing - except maybe with older teens if you are willing to have a talk with them about violence and the intentional/unintentional messages Hollywood is sending out these days. Anal sex with a princess for saving the world? Is there some moral high ground in trying to drown a room full of trainees to see who is clever enough to breath fetid sewer gas through a hose to stay alive? Double amputees can live a normal life by wearing high tech bouncy feet armed with swords? Sadly, I think this movie was written to be controversial just to make money for the producers. Certainly we could have had a more friendly movie with just a few re-writes.

Hey, that reviewer made me want to watch it and I have to tell ya, wow!!!  Thank you :) There are a few reviewers that claim this film has Christian bashing on here and I guess I didn't get that when I watched it.  If they are talking about the ""Church"" scene...I don't think you want to vouch for that group of POS's.  That's why Valentine(Sam Jackson) went after them because they were like a Westboro type of group.  Now, I'm not condoning killing of any kind but in a satire of the Bond movies, it was quite hysterical.  So, to the 1 star people...have a laugh, do your research before you pay money to see a film like this and quit counting the ""F"" words.

So for the review:

Awesome!!!  Awesome!!!  Awesome Fun Time!!!  It is a little violent and vulgar, but hey this isn't a Kirk Cameron film..although some people may find his films a little vulgar and violent...lol

It is basically a very adult origin James Bond type of movie that pokes fun of the genre as well.  It's like when you are watching a James Bond movie wanting to see more violent content and a more in depth look of a gorgeous behind of one of it's brave female cast members but you can't because it is rated PG or PG-13, this movie goes there for you.  It has great actors/actresses with a goofy but good story and hilarious good guys and bad guys going after each other.

So... if you are easily offended and do not like vulgar and violent content...stay away!!!",1434326400,2,1673,4.5083056478405314

6947413,1,B00S1ITA2W,"Definitely spoilers below, stop reading now!
This movie wishes to present the Kingsman organization has one above politics, governments, the greed of the ruling elites. The lead character, Eggsy, who is a member of the working class, learns, as does the viewer, that the Kingsman expects him to be just as apt to succeed as anyone of a higher social class,  Well and good: movies can only draw one in if the viewer identifies with the values of the ""good guys"".  (Unless you are a sociopath.) But as the movie unfolds, I increasingly lost track of what those values were.
Case in point: candidates are taught to value team work, yet the first training exercise ends with one of the candidates (apparently) drowned. Yet the remaining candidates simply ignore this and are eager to continue the training. By the way, the movie never shows any actual training, the candidates auto-magically become expert shows, martial artists and all that.
Then there is the dogs -- the final qualification is for the candidate to shoot their own dog. I guess the value here is to instill blind obedience in Kingsman senior officers. Sounds like good training for the Gestapo. (It matters not the guns are loaded with blanks, the point is that the candidate fires the gun expecting the dog to die.)
Like the old Bond movies, there are lots of preposterous gadgets. Surely the bullet-proof umbrellas are the dumbest. Ever had a gust of wind snatch and toss your umbrella around while in you hand? So how do you expect it to repel the much higher energy of a bullet(s) without tearing it out of your hand. Sure this is entertainment, but it also has to be a little plausible. Think about the other gadgets you see in the movie and you will realize they are unworkable. Why are the two high-atmosphere balloons designed to explode just when the pilot can barely get into range to fire the missile? What is to prevent any random wind from pulling the balloons far away from the satellite?  And then there are those security implants placed by the villain?! The operation always leaves a scar visible from 6 feet away. Can't the villain find a decent surgeon with all his 100s of $billions??  Even the director of the Kingsman has an implant, and none of the ""top agents"" notices.

Others have commented about the chaotic violence. I agree. What I think is meant to be a wry, ironic action movie undoes itself with savage violence that so degrades the humans presented that I was left feeling the movie is so nihilistic that it will reach for any gruesome spectacle just to keep the viewer shocked and watching.
Other reviewers see the scene at the church as an attack on Christianity. I don't. Rather it suggests that religious believers, especially of a lower class, have so little value that they serve only as a useful prop to move the plot forward. Again, this is more nihilism: let's watch these ""low-life trash"" murder each other as it makes ""great action"".

And the final scene, yes, is perfect for some sniggers from early adolescents, but does well demonstrate the aimlessness and emptiness of the director/the writers. They'll reach for any gimmick for temporary effect rather than develop characters or a plot that actually speaks to the viewer.",1434240000,16,3234,4.766071428571428

6947501,2,B00S1ITA2W,"Some parts of it were entertaining, probably more so because we were drinking, but overall a tasteless and offensive movie. Most disturbing to me personally was the ending...spoiler alert....in which the ""hero"" goes to retrieve his ""reward"" for saving the world: a woman, who under duress, promised him anal if he would save her life and the world. That's so close to rape...I can't even. Who wants to have anal sex with a woman who promised it while begging for her life? Apparently this guy.

Weird. Also the blood and gore were gross, though I guess some people find pleasure in watching bodies cut into pieces. Lots of foul language too so it's not a movie for the family, that's for sure. Also the depiction of Americans was a bit stereotyped...it made me think a little about how the Brits see us very narrowly, which I guess is understandable. Either way there was definitely supposed be some pleasure derived from watching us get slaughtered.

Other than that, there were some polished and entertaining moments. The kid is a likable character and some parts were pretty cool. I also appreciated the class warfare element...the working class rises up and fights against their oppressors bit is always a nice touch, though a little contradictory when paired with this super elitist secret organization.",1434240000,2,1308,4.9409090909090905

I can't decide if they were aiming at a light-hearted parody of Ian Fleming, a serious higher-brow (haha) popcorn action flick or a whimsical democrat party fundraising device.

The movie stayed interesting for roughly 10 minutes. It stayed watchable for almost an hour. I didn't make it past that, and I could probably write the rest of it without thinking very much about it.

It was the 2009 Star Trek film with a contemporary British Secret Service wallpaper over top of it.
Seriously Taron Egerton's character was basically just Chris Pine Kirk.  I could have done without Sam L Jackson's lisp.  The film made fun of Americans all through it, which as an American I'm fine with.  I can laugh at us.  There's plenty to laugh at us about.

6947574,4,B00S1ITA2W,"KINGSMAN: SECRET SERVICE is a thoroughly enjoyable and charming and cheeky and fast-paced and action-packed spy story / spy story spoof.  Despite the presence of Samuel L. Jackson as a villainous American billionaire, the film has a very British sensibility.  Dry wit.  Well-mannered and button down (except when it burst into gloriously over-the-top violence).  I expected to be mildly amused, but it was actually very satisfying on many levels.

This is an origin story, but these developments are neatly woven within the main plot, involving Jacksons Blofeld-esque efforts to more or less destroy the world.  Colin Firth plays Harry Hart, a super suave super-spy, who recruits the neer do well son of a former partner of his to audition to join the ultra-top-secret Kingsman service.  (Its presented as a world-wide effort, but it is pretty much British-centric.)  Firth is terrific.  Were quite used to seeing him well-dressed and well-mannered.  His wit, as always, is impeccable.  And when hes required to be a bit more serious, he does it without a whiff of over-acting.  Firth is great at giving just enough emotion in the most enjoyable way possible.  But whats great in KINGSMAN are his forays into action.  And Im not talking about mild-mannered stuff here.  He goes full tilt, hands-on action hero.  He makes James Bond look wimpy.  Its a blast watching him at work, and hes clearly having a delightful time throughout.

Young Taron Egerton is not an actor I know.  He plays the recruit very charmingly.  He starts out as a thug and a wise-ass, but never so much that we dislike him.  And his conversion into a dangerous weapon is fun and not as fraught with clich&eacute; as I had feared.  His journey, though taking a predictable course, is sprinkled with surprisesnot the least of which is Egertons far better than expected performance. Hes joined by young Sophie Cookson as a female applicant for the Kingsman position.  They develop a nice friendship which Im happy to report via this very minor spoiler does not develop into a romantic or physical one.  (This might change in the inevitable sequel, but its a nice example of how the film sometimes surprises.)

Jackson makes a good villain for the modern age.  And his prime henchman is Gazelle (Sofia Boutella), a blade runner whose artificial legs contain incredibly sharp blades.  Her fight scenes are amazing, and quite harmful to the limbs of her opponents.  As the head of the Kingsmen, we have the invaluable Michael Caine, and as the head trainer of the recruits, the usually villainous Mark Strongits nice to see him as a rock-solid good guy for a change.

The film has a varied and amusing soundtrack.  In fact, it is occasionally TOO noticeable and drowns out some of the dialogue in the bigger action scenes.  My surround-sound system is pretty carefully tuned, so I was surprised at this little glitch.  Also, the film has minimal CGI special effects, and some of them show the lower budget (compared to a film like THE AVENGERS, for example).  Planes look a bit hokey, and a Middle Eastern castle in the opening scene is so fake, I assumed it was done for humorous effect.  But the scenes of hand-to-hand combat are plentiful and fun.

All in all, fun is the word to describe the film.  It has some surprising turns, and many welcome moments of dry humor (a great joke involving a pug not being a bulldog is one).  All involved are having fun, and pitch their performances to match the tongue-in-cheek attitude of director Matthew Vaughn, who brought us the equally off-kilter KICK ASS.  (Hopefully the sequel will fare better than the one for KICK ASS.)  Its a hoot.  (Having said that, while not as foul-mouthed as KICK ASSthis is a very clear R-rated film and not meant for kids.)",1434153600,7,3765,4.830985915492958

I was not only captivated by the action but laughed very heartily at the comedic moments.

Normally, you would need Jonah Hill in a film to keep it that classy, but when you are trying to hook the Samuel Jackson sub-literate class, Colin Firth can't exactly get his Jane Austen on, and his script choice here makes you wonder if he really is just a BBC teleprompter reader.

A guy who sees the human race as a virus would be a fun villain to kill off slowly, but you get the sense the British aristocrats assigned the task of contending with him actually share his distaste for mankind. How else can we explain the story's sadistic pleasure at painting pro-lifers and people of faith as hate-filled, rural churchgoers who succumb to an orgy of bloodletting?  (I got the sense the director was pleasuring himself, Dahmer style, conceiving this scene.)

(I'm not kidding.)  Not edifying. The other parts of the dialogue were sometimes hard to hear.  I liked the characters, technology, and action scenes, but the gratuitous bloody deaths holding the plot together were glorified as entertainment  in a sickening way. The slaughter in the church-- even a church that was a cult--was a  revolting and disturbing new low in film history  as the camera lingered on how each one died.  Another very big let down was the young star's cliched choice at the end. I thought he was becoming a man of  honor and that he had a possible future together with a fellow agent he had befriended-- but no...he bragged (unbecomingly for a Romantic hero) and then stupidly lunged for a hookup with someone he did not care about. Very disappointing ending. This film could have  been easily cleaned up and made less ""bloody for profit.""  It could have shown us a main chacter who walked away as a man full of the ideals he had been acquiring.... but instead he does not maintain confidentialty and chooses  the 007 ending.  The irony is the movie plays up the chivalrous knight/ gentleman whose nobility is ""more than yesterday."" The director helps us care about the character...

There are a lot of established actors in movie, so I think Taron Egerton (Eggsy) sometimes gets overlooked, but he gave one of the brightest performances in the movie, in my opinion.

6947842,4,B00S1ITA2W,"I was really intrigued to see this movie when it first came out in theaters, but unfortunately, wasn't able to see it until it hit DVD. My Dad and I both love James Bond, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., and plenty of other spy movies and shows, and the trailer for this film got us hyped. And we weren't disappointed.

During a raid in the Middle East, a secret agent sacrifices himself to save his team. Feeling guilt over the loss of his colleague, Harry Hart, code-named ""Galahad,"" personally delivers a bravery medal to the agent's widow and her young son, Gary (nicknamed ""Eggsy""), saying that if they ever need help, they should call the phone number on the back of the medal and deliver a coded message. Seventeen years later, Eggsy is now an unemployed young adult living with his mother, infant sister, and abusive stepfather. Despite being intelligent and capable, he left training for the Royal Marines and lives an aimless life. After being arrested for stealing a car and taking it for a joyride, Eggsy calls the number on the back of the medal. Hart arranges for his release and tells Eggsy about the existence of Kingsman, a secret intelligence agency for which both he and Eggsy's late father worked. In the wake of Lancelot's death, the agency opens a vacancy for a new agent, and Eggsy agrees to apply.  But as he quickly finds out, being a secret agent is a lot harder than it looks, and it'll take all his ingenuity and bravery to pass the Kingsman's intense training regimen.  Will Eggsy become a proper spy?  And will he and his colleagues be able to stop a powerful media mogul from destroying the world?

There's lots to say about this movie, so let's start with the characters. Eggsy is a pretty likeable protagonist, and it's easy to relate to his struggle of wanting to do the right thing, but feeling that society has turned it's back on him. He always looks out for his friends, teammates, and loved ones, and although he's understandably naive about the world of spies and secret gadgets at first, he's not a total idiot and knows when to be respectful and take things seriously.  Harry Hart, his spy mentor, reminds me a lot of John Steed from the classic Avengers series. He's the gentleman's gentleman; always having a clever quip ready, and remaining polite, even in the middle of a smack down.  The rest of the cast don't get a whole lot of backstory or character development, but they're all enjoyable to watch.  And the villainous Valentine is both funny and cruel, as well as interesting, in that he talks with a lisp and can't stand the sight of blood. More than that, his plans for world destruction aren't as crazy as it sounds, and he's smart enough to charm many important figureheads over to his beliefs that by destroying the world, he's actually saving it. Having a grey-area villain who thinks he's doing the right thing was an interesting change of pace.

All the action scenes are pretty well done, and although EXTREMELY violent and bloody, they're choreographed well enough that you can easily tell what's going on and smoothly follow the action. (So many action movies now have the fights go by so quick, it can be hard to tell what's going on when it all becomes a blur.)  As for the plot, it's pretty solid, and constantly throws in new twists and turns so that it's hard to guess what's going to happen next.  But more than anything, this film serves as a loving homage and tribute to classic spy movies (specifically ones from the 60s), while also keeping things fresh and updated. It seems that now a days, spy movies have gone the Jason Bourne route, and want to be more gritty and ""realistic"" (even James Bond seems to be heading down this path). So it was nice to see a film that gives the spy genre a swift kick in the pants, and just be FUN again.

Bottom line, if you love spy films and shows like classic Bond, the Avengers, In Like Flint (etc.), this is the movie for you.  Just be warned, the ""R"" rating is for a reason. There's a TON of swearing and graphic violence...but it's also a fun ride.",1433980800,2,4054,4.552197802197802
6947843,1,B00S1ITA2W,"This movie was such a waste of our time and money that I am impelled to write my first review. This is not a James Bond spoof.

6947845,5,B00S1ITA2W,"""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" is great! This is how the story goes: Based upon the acclaimed comic book, Kingsman: The Secret Service tells the story of a super-secret spy organization that recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius.

The cast led by Colin Firth (as Harry Hart / Galahad), Samuel L. Jackson (as Valentine) & Michael Caine (as Arthur) is great. The directing by Matthew Vaughn (who also produced and co-wrote the screenplay) is great. The screenplay (based on the comic book by Mark Millar & Dave Gibbons, they also executive produced the film, as well) by Vaughn & Jane Goldman (who also co-produced) is great.

The music by Henry Jackman & Matthew Margeson is great. The cinematography by George Richmond is great. The film editing by Eddie Hamilton & Jon Harris is great. The casting by Reg Poerscout-Edgerton is great. The production design by Paul Kirby is great. The art direction by Andrew Ackland-Snow, Steve Carter, Joe Howard, Paul Spriggs, Andy Thompson, Keith Pain, & Tom Whitehead is great. The set decoration by David Morison & Jennifer Williams is great. The costume design by Arianne Phillips is great. The stunts coordinated by Bradley James Allan & fights coordinated by Guillermo Grispo is great. The special effects coordinated by Anna Krawczyk & supervised by Steven Warner & Steve Hutchinson is great. The visual effects coordinated by Turea Blyth, Shreyas Dorwat, Devika Kawle, Jonathan S. Kemp, Jenny King, Zuzana Klimova, Stewart Kojima, Guy Mannerings, Bhumika Mayer, Kevin Sheldon Saldanha, Matina Skouteri, Alexandrine Stehelin, Robert Vassie, Maggie Walby & Chris Wilson, supervised by Steven Begg, Pierre Buffin, John Bruno, Chris Panton, Philip Dobree, Paul Docherty, Kevin Tod Haug, Marc Jouveneau, Matt Kasmir, Geoffrey Niquet & Paul Round is great. The make-up & hair design by Christine Blundell is great.

This is a great, fun and entertaining action / adventure comedy that is smart and interesting (as well as intriguing). Colin Firth is solid as usual as Harry Hart / Galahad, Samuel L. Jackson makes an interesting impression as Valentine and in a solid and well-done debut performance, Taron Egerton (as Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin). Matthew Vaughn (along with Jane Goldman) have made another entertaining and well-crafted film, comic-book adaptation, withstanding, of course. This is one of the most surprising movies that has come out this year (February to be exact). This is also one of the best action films of the year, so far, as well, too.",1433980800,,2612,5.199524940617577

6947847,5,B00S1ITA2W,"Saw this in the cinema and couldn't wait and then couldn't wait for the BD and got it last Tuesday soon as it came out!!!
Read the comic in the meantime... the comic was okay but as with both Kingsman and Kick-Ass and X-Men: First Class ... Matthew Vaughn (the director) excels at making the films actually better than the comics and that's a rare director indeed...
In my book Vaughn is the British Tarantino. The man has only made 4 films so far: Layer Cake, Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class and Kingsman: The Secret Service but they are all witty, masterworks of diabolical action. And all better than their comic book counterpart.
Kingsman excels in Tarantino-like originality and violence and cleverness, even when Tarantino wasn't being original (Kill Bill, Django, Inglorious Bastards) he was. And that's the same truth of Vaughn, the superhero and spy and crime dramas have all been done to death but Vaughn puts a naughty but cool and clever spin on each of those. Many people have cited Kingsman wrongly being bad ass and better than Bond - but for my part Bond was not the benchmark here, The Avengers were. Not the Captain America - Avengers but the original - superspy team of Emma Peel (Diana Rigg) and John Steed (Patrick Macnee) and similar shows, The Saint, Honey West, Danger Man and The Prisoner ... it's those Avengers that I feel Kingsman: The Secret Service is mostly paying homage to. Sure enough, Bond was considered the apex of the 'Gentleman Spy' genre but Bond was rarely ever actually a gentleman - more an abuser of women whereas The Avengers were much much more inline with Kingsman than Bond ever was.... John Steed always wore an impeccable suit, matching bowler, and carried an umbrella with a hidden rapier inside. Plus the Avengers were always much more comic book-like than Bond ever was.
When I first saw Kingsman, the first thing I thought of was my God, this is exactly the organization that Steed would have belonged to. It was always vague which exact branch of British government Peel and Steed worked for - they never said it was MI5 or MI6 so in my giddy imaginings it was Kingsman instead. What I ended up doing was anticipating Kingsman coming out on BD I also ordered The Avengers Season 5 and the 1998 remake film with Uma Thurman as Peel and Ralph Fiennes as Steed.
If you love Kingsman and the super stylish, gentleman spy genre I highly recommend getting the originals and obvious inspiration for this film.
I know that Vaughn and Millar cite James Bond in all the interviews but really The Avengers is closer to Kingsman in every sense more than Bond is. The Avengers has camp, drama, wit, charm, impeccable style, over the top villains, gadgets AND trick umbrellas!
The Avengers Season 5 BD is only $20.00 in the U.S. and The Avengers 1998 movie on BD is only $7.99 - practically a steal... and they are very nice companion pieces to Kingsman: The Secret Service and you not only get more dash and gentleman spy action but you get to see where the Kingsman came from.",1433980800,4,3016,4.649812734082397

My gut told me the film would be garbage, lacking any substance.  All I wanted was eye candy.  Well, there wasn't enough of the heavily stylized action to keep me interested or to outweigh the pervasive activism in this 2-hour stinkfest.  There are only three scenes that involve the crazy flying camera capturing gonzo action choreography between CGI actors.  Two are quite short.  The longest and most involved of these sequences takes place in a church.  The scene begins with the priest giving a cliche hate filled sermon - anti-gay, anti-black, every nonbeliever on Earth is going to Hell - and ends with the mass slaughter of everyone in the room.  The director attempts to make the scene comical.  However, it just felt bitter. In fact most of the comedy in the movie fails. I got the impression the director was trying to hard to be fresh and edgy.  As for the characters that populate the film - stock, uninteresting, cliche.  The young protagonist starts life as a ball cap wearing, foul mouthed Cockney and finishes his journey by trading in his hat for a suit.  Sam Jackson's lisping Dr. Evil is hard to watch.  Michael Caine - aka one of the greatest actors on Earth - is totally wasted.  Colin Firth is actually pretty good.

6947911,1,B00S1ITA2W,"Just finished watching this porn ... oops ... film and then headed straight to my laptop to leave a few of my thoughts. Many sincere thanks to rmeniteowl for sparing me from having to waste any more time on this movie. Excellent review, rmeniteowl.

The most infuriating part of this movie is quite literally ""the end"" - the bare end of the princess. Boy saves world, boy gets princess in the bum in return for saving/sparing her life. Borderline snuff material? I'm with rmeniteowl, lost 2 hours of my life on this movie and the last 5-10 minutes of it left me feeling like I had been done like the princess. Duped, infuriated, victimized, and helpless, are a few other descriptors that come to mind. Yes, there were warning signs, but none that would have prepared even the most astute viewer for the princess scene. In fact, it seemed rather random and makes me wonder if the princess scene was the directors parting message to women.

One final note, we get Sofia Boutella playing, Gazelle. Boutella plays the part of an amputee, an able-bodied athlete, but she also has to be the sinister female villain. For a moment, and only a moment, I thought I was actually going to see one of the very few Hollywood representations of people commonly thought of as disabled and feeble, as positive, strong, and able-bodied. Wrong. Interesting to choose a female villain that, minus her 'multiple' kills, closely resembles the strong, able-bodied, popular Oscar Pistorius. I don't know - maybe someone else can finish this stream of consciousness.

In short, the use of a women's bum shouldn't be portrayed as a man's reward for doing good. Such Hollywood media crack only serves to reinforce the sexual subjugation of women, that women are essentially inferior to men while portraying men as sex-craved creatures, void of emotion. Finally, a trained real disabled female actor should be playing the part of strong, able-bodied woman - a heroine.

Lesson learned - read reviews first and don't trust the quality of a movie simply because Colin Firth's name is attached to it.",1433894400,3,2069,4.852691218130311

6947913,1,B00S1ITA2W,"I was so excited when I saw the previews for this movie; however, they were the only good scenes in the movie.  I watched the whole movie; but, it was like watching a horrific car crash where you can't look away.  It could have been an fun movie, but there was so many things wrong with it I am not sure where to start.

1.  Every other line had the word F**k in it.  If you made a drinking game out of this movie no one would make it past the first 10 minutes. I am no put off by foul language, in fact I often use the F-word; however this was just ridiculously redundant and stupid.

2.  The violence was poorly done and over the top--blood gushing and splashing almost cartoonish.  I am not squeamish by any means--I love action, horror and sci-fi movies--but this was so ridiculous that it took away from what was some pretty cool fight scenes.

3.  I knew when they were given puppies at the beginning of their training it would be awful; I was right.  The final test is to kill their dog that they have bonded to.  Really?!?!  At that point I was ready to root for the bad guys.  Yeah, lets portray that the willingness to kill a trusting, defenseless animal is a good quality.  Not!

4.  When the princess is about to be rescued (and really? a princess) she promises Eggsly he can do her in her a**hole if he saves the world was just the final straw in a very poorly done and disappointing movie.

5.  Samuel Jackson's characters lisp was awful, distracting and not necessary.

6.  Not even a good take away line.

The Church scene is a liberal murder fantasy that reminded me of the exploding theater scene in Inglorious Bastards. Not that I have a problem with exploding Nazis, it just seemed like a gratuitous death fantasy. Sickening, unoriginal liberal Hollywood dreck. These people should be ashamed of themselves for making this garbage. But if you're clueless and have no idea what makes a good spy flick and or love to gobble up the nihilistic liberal nonsence.

Now, some people (whose skin must be INCREDIBLY thin) are frothing at the mouth over an adult joke at the end of the film.  It's no different from ""Keeping up the British End"".  And, in every theatrical setting I've seen it in, it draws universal laughs.  From people barely out of their teens, all the way up to grandparents and elderly types.  Unfortunately, modern ""polite"" society places entirely too high a value on being horrified by any sort of acknowledgement of congress between the sexes that it deems ""crude"".

The time has come for a new member and as each present member provides one person to vie got the role, Henry brings in an ex small time hood, Eggsy Unwin. Eggsey's father saved Henry's life so he owes the family. The training is big time and difficult and as the film proceeds, you find out who wins.

At the same time, Jackson is collecting world figures as part of his nefarious plan. This part of the film was very tiresome, even with a female assistant who has blade prosthesis, like the runner from South Africa.
This is a mission for Henry and all the spy hardware is shown and used.q

This film had great potential, and for the most part I enjoyed it, but I doubt a series it will make. The real shocker is the role Mark Hamill takes.

Before I really looked at the rating for this I was expecting a teenage Cody Banks type movie. After seeing it was rated R I was confused. The movie is very much geared toward the teenage crowd, but the fact that there are over 100 uses of the f-word take it out of the teenage crowd acceptability. The fact that the movie is about a younger agent takes this out of the older crowd's desire to see this. Colin Firth is very good and this is a different part for him. The main problem is that the swearing and violence push it out watch-ability for the crowd it is intended for. Had the movie been the same without the swearing it would have found an audience. As it stands its in between those that can't see it and those that don't want to. Overall, adding the unnecessary swearing really hurt the movie badly. I give this a C+.",1433808000,4,1217,4.342105263157895

6947945,2,B00S1ITA2W,"I looked forward to this movie for some time. I'm a huge Colin Firth fan and I love spy movies. I'm no prude, and violence in films doesn't really bother me, but this was beyond over the top. I understand that the movie was supposed to be comical, almost to the point of satire, but the church scene was absolutely ridiculous and incredibly misplaced. It didn't even make sense.

The concept was actually really interesting, but they stole almost every canned spy recruit in training cliche they could - robbing from Men In Black, The Recruit, and countless others.

The actors in this film did deserve better. It's really disheartening to see that comedy, action, and even a little satire can't be executed without use of a proverbial sledge hammer. My review is only a partial one, as I couldn't finish the film. I turned it off mid way through the church scene. I'm normally very hesitant to offer a bad review, but the movie going public deserve better than this.",1433808000,,967,4.649122807017544

6947949,4,B00S1ITA2W,"Theatrical review. There may be spoilers.
Matthew Vaughn has a small resume of directed films, but it's a good one (Layer Cake, Stardust, Kick-Ass and X-Men: First Class). He brings elements of all plus a healthy injection of James Bond and ""Kill Bill"" to this fun action-based film. The biggest influence would seem to be the James Bond films, especially given the title. But these secret spies don't work for the British government, or any government for that matter. They are independent do-gooders, headquartered in London and organized based on King Arthur and his knights. In fact, each spy is given a code name based on the knights. You know, Galahad (Colin Firth), Lancelot (Jack Davenport), and Arthur (Michael Caine). Not to mention the trainer, Merlin (Mark Strong).

When one of the knights is killed on a mission, an opening occurs and each of the remaining members gets to nominate one candidate. Harry Hart, aka Galahad, nominates a troubled young man who is the son of one of his compatriots who was killed years earlier and in the process saved Harry's life. Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin (Taron Egerton) has been raised by his widowed mother (Samantha Womack) who is now living with a bullying jerk.

Once Eggsy agrees to be considered, he and the other candidates are put through a rigorous training regimen where ultimately only one will be chosen. While all of this is going on, the evil master villain named Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson, working a lisp) is set to fix the planet of its climate change problem by reducing the Earth's population on his own terms. Using cell phone SIM cards, he will be able to control human emotions. See, I told you it was just like a Bond flick.

Given the ""R"" rating, this would have been a great opportunity to see what a more violent, profane and explicitly sexual a Bond film might look like. Unfortunately, the film is a bit of a letdown on that last opportunity, showing just a flash of bare butt, albeit with an element of naughty language. As far as the violence and the profanity, we're not disappointed, unless that isn't what you came for. The best scene is when Harry infiltrates a Tennessee church containing extreme elements of fundamentalism. The leader preaches hate that would give the KKK pause. As a trial, Valentine is going to try out his new gizmo on this sample. The result is a bloodbath that is only missing Uma Thurman in a yellow jumpsuit.

The film falls a bit short of excellence only when it shifts into traditional chase mode as hordes of bad guys in white uniforms chase our hero inside Valentine's secret lair. Everyone's a bad shot except Eggsy. Aside from some quibbles, this is a fun, witty ""R""-rated romp and provides some great entertainment.",1433808000,2,2725,4.766949152542373

6947985,5,B00S1ITA2W,"Kingsman: The Secret Service is a semi-satiric, often violent film that simultaneously spoofs and pays homage to vintage James Bond spy thrillers. Headquartered at a tailor shop in London but with no official affiliation to any specific country, Kingsman is a secret organization dedicated to ferreting out bad guys and keeping the world safe. Its structure is patterned after the Round Table, with its agents given the names of knights  Galahad, Lancelot, etc. The agents all wear well tailored suits, are impeccably mannered, and are highly trained in weaponry and field tactics.

The organization is run by Arthur (Michael Caine). When an academic, Professor Arnold (Mark Hamill), is kidnapped and one of its agents (Jack Davenport) killed trying to rescue him, Kingsman is led to Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), a wealthy, ecology-obsessed megalomaniac who has decided to take matters into his own hands when politicians turn a deaf ear and blind eye to legislating environment-friendly laws. He will thin out the human race to ease pressure on the planet and its resources.

During a Kingsman mission led by Galahad (Colin Firth), one of the team is killed. Years later, Galahad checks on the son of his deceased comrade, Gary Eggsy Unwin (Taron Egerton), an angry young man on a bad path in life. Kingsman is looking for a new member to replace one recently killed on a mission. Each Kingsman member will sponsor a candidate, who will be pitted against the others in a rigorous, potentially lethal competition to see who prevails. Feeling guilty about the death of his father, Galahad, seeing potential and intelligence in Eggsy, sponsors him.

Kingsman: The Secret Service is a hybrid. It has the trappings of a vintage James Bond film. There are gadgets a-plenty, a crazed villain, an evil assistant (Sofia Boutella) who uses Oscar Pistorius-type prosthetic legs as slashing weapons, references to fine wine and spirits, and elaborately staged fights. Yet the movie has an identity of its own and an extremely witty script.

Director Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class) knows his way around action. One episode, early on, takes place in a pub. Galahad, only mildly annoyed at threats from a group of thugs, locks the doors and takes them on single-handedly, doing considerable damage without so much as wrinkling his Saville Row suit. To heighten the mayhem, slow motion shows us in detail a tooth being knocked out and flying across the room. Another scene, in a church, involves a bloody melee with Galahad and scores of people fighting to the death using any objects available as makeshift weapons.

Mr. Firth is an easy fit as the suave gentleman/warrior. He exudes class and breeding in a performance that is witty, empathetic, and tongue-in-cheek. He understands his character and the tone of the film precisely and plays Galahad straight, avoiding caricature.

Mr. Caine, too, is perfect as the head of this clandestine organization. His Arthur is authoritative, mission-oriented, and unsentimental. In his line of work, there is little time to wallow in sorrow over the loss of a fellow agent. The job is to replace him as soon as possible.

Newcomer Taron Egerton carries much of the movie. Under the tutelage of Galahad, his character transforms from a directionless kid to a young man recognizing his destiny. Holding his own against veterans Caine and Firth, Mr. Egerton has the makings of movie star. Ruggedly handsome, with effortless charm the ability to convey emotion without uttering a word, he is a movie star in the making.

Mr. Jackson, no stranger to crazy roles, has fun as Valentine in a role that calls out for a broad, no-holds-barred performance in the mold of Bond baddies Auric Goldfinger, Dr. No and Ernst Blofeld. Valentine, with a pronounced lisp, owl-eye glasses and a dread of the sight of blood (though hes responsible for spilling gallons of it), is particularly lethal because his madness is fueled by unlimited funds, arrogance and self-righteousness.

Rated R, Kingsman: The Secret Service is an action-packed, joyful romp. There are some intense scenes, to be sure, but the tone is light and extremely clever. The script by director Vaughn and Jane Goldman (based on the graphic comic novel by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons) is a polished, fast-paced melange of old-style spy movies, thrills, and over-the-top action.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include six behind-the-scenes featurettes and audio commentary.",1433721600,2,4474,5.1234567901234565

Do you believe there is such a thing as too much swearing?
Does sodomy offend you?
Does stylized violence get your dander all hackled?
Are disrespectful representations of the President of the United States wrong?
Is parkour lame and played out?

OK -- parkour is played out and lame, but if you answered yes to any of the other questions, you should give this one a pass.

It was like they were trying to mix slasher/black comedy/and James Bond all in one and it DID NOT work.  I left the room before it was over... my husband watched until the end and said it just got worse.  I am embarrassed for Colin Firth (whom I usually love in any movie) and Samuel L.

The rough language was totally unnecessary, and it really is true that foul language is a result of lack of vocabulary. The graphic violence of cutting people's heads off just wasn't necessary and added no value. I would say it added negative value, and detracted from the videography and plot. It tried to be a graphic novel but didn't pull it off.

where they asked him to shoot his dog.  Then it turned into a bunch of tripe with utterly ridiculous moments and caricatures and poorly done low-budget fights/explosions, and general nonsense.  How bad can a film get?  This is it.  Did the director and writers die half-way through the movie?

6948144,3,B00S1ITA2W,"I was happy with the acting (Sam Jackson's ridiculous lisp notwithstanding) and entertained by the storyline, but for those who didn't know this was based on a comic book, it is, so set your expectations accordingly.  SFX were mediocre, ranging from literally unbelievable to downright ridiculous, which one hopes was intentional.  While the head-exploding sequence to fireworks perhaps was meant to be comical (?), and the church scene was gratuitously violent but well-choreographed, both left the viewer with a bit of a, ""what just happened?"" feeling.  I really did enjoy the movie, but it couldn't seem to find its personality - it waffled between Bond and Austin Powers.  If you go into it knowing what to expect,  you'll be thrilled.

I didn't want to because I had never seen anything about it.  He said Colin Firth and Samuel Jackson were in it.  I was like..  WHAT??!  So we put it on and braced ourselves for the worst.  This movie was AMAZING!  The story was awesome.  The characters were great!  It was the best spy type movie I have seen since the old James Bond movies!  I hated the bad guys so much(and there are a lot of them in this movie) I wanted to strangle them thru the television.  Colin Firth is one of my top 10 favorite actor's.  The mish mosh cast is crazy good together.  I thought the spy movie genre was tired, but after watching this one I honestly hope there is a sequel.

This movie began with such promise as a rousing good spy school story, but midway degraded itself with gratuitous violence and multiple killings in, of all places, a church with a large cross on the altar. This was followed by fantasy scenes of peoples' heads exploding in colorful fireworks to music.  What?  The genre was mixed; the theme lost; the dialogue trite; the ending explosive and stupid.

6948220,1,B00S1ITA2W,"This movie had tremendous potential, but fell miserably short.  The constant F-bombs and the ridiculous exploding body part scene were just too much to take.  Samuel L Jackson played a goofy villain, and while Colin Firth did a good job, his acting was overshadowed by the other far-fetched elements.

Give me a James Bond movie any day over this waste of time.",1433116800,9,361,4.790322580645161
6948221,4,B00S1ITA2W,"Roaring, overly indulgent fun amidst the rubble of the classic spy films and programs that dominated the 1960s. It's a more deadpan, action-focused take than Austin Powers, of course, but I'd hardly venture to call it serious. The tone is decidedly carefree, which should be no surprise given the creative team's track record. Director Matthew Vaughan and comic book author Mark Millar, who teamed to bring Kick-Ass to the screen a few years ago, are also the guilty parties in this case, and its right in the same ballpark. Tons of effective punchlines, a few really great cornerstone action sets, and a wide spectrum of colors to cover for a very simple, shallow, recycled plot. And it works, honestly, both as a standalone mind-number and as a winking, grinning, elbowing satire of Bond and company. For my money it lingers too long in the training room, but once the cast graduates it's basically balls-to-the-wall the rest of the way home. Gratifying if not nourishing, like the big McDonald's spread enjoyed by a certain nameless character in a key scene, I had a great time but felt a little guilty about it later. The chapel brawl and the series of colorful explosions at the film's climax are two spots I'll have a hard time forgetting, though, and I feel like I'm richer for having experienced them.",1433116800,4,1309,4.822222222222222

He looks fantastic, and his character is much like a caricature of past roles, which is great. I loved the young lead, too--very charming. Was it the greatest flick ever? No, but it was truly entertaining with a the exception of a couple of odd scenes. Again, not for your younger kids--under teens don't need to see this one.",1433030400,3,605,4.559633027522936

This is just a masturbatory adolescent fantasy from start to finish, with over-the-top CGI action scenes that nobody even pretends to believe anymore, and embarrassing, mid-century portrayals of women that even rednecks are starting to find insulting. I don't have the energy to pick apart the many ways in which the movie fails. It's poorly thought out, with major gaps in logic in the premise, and in the story that comes out of it. Bad thinking and bad writing.

In the old days, you made a movie this silly and campy by calling it a ""spoof"" of spy movies that took themselves too seriously. But with the James Bond franchise getting smarter and more relevant, there's really no way to justify making a movie as utterly stupid and gratuitous as this.

The art direction and the action are well handled but the story and script are juvenile (and I mean that it almost, literally, feels like it was written by a twelve year old).

6948503,1,B00S1ITA2W,"If I could give it NO STARS I would. And I hate that, because this movie had so much awesome potential. The actor line-up alone was amazing. The most disturbing thing to me is that the movie trailer lured one in on the premises that this is simply a great spy film. But, no. Not at all. Nothing simple about this. Someone had an agenda. SPOILER. SPOILER. SPOILER. I expected language. I expected violence. I expected sex. But what I didn't expect was senseless, violent, horrid killing of women and children...by the thousands. It wasn't needed. It could have been a great film. The murderous killing of an entire church in rural Kentucky, the blowing up of all government officials, the destruction of mankind. All of these things would have been appropriately placed in a drama. Tragic. But dramatic. Except (and here is the failure of this film) it wasn't tragic. It wasn't drama. It was comedic. Inconsequential. Trivial. The extinguishing of human life....with a laugh, a joke, and a smile. It was James Bond meets Heather's meets humanism. Don't waste your money. If you are looking for a good spy film...find something else.",1432944000,5,1131,4.835051546391752

6948513,5,B00S1ITA2W,"This was the best spy movie I've ever seen. Better then any James Bond or Mission Impossible. They make the spy movie the way it should be for a change. All the best things about an early James Bond with better gadgets and action scenes. The Sim Card idea was pretty great I thought, truly made Samuel L. Jackson's portrayal of a villain memorable and lasting. The chick with the swords in her prosthetic feet was an interesting new way to throw in a Bond villain that had some weird gimmick. Though her ability to basically cut through anything with ease was a little far fetched but I can live with it. The scene at the end with the princess didn't seem to fit but w/e the rest of the movie was very solid. Enjoyed it thoroughly. If they ever make a sequel I'd gladly watch it considering most spy movies I see these days are generally just boring and filled with ridiculous plots.... with a splash of action, some explosions, and the ever boring car chase scene...",1432857600,,967,4.438202247191011

Colin Firth as the English Gentleman spy shines. The over the top violence is mostly cartoonish and you know the master plan of Samuel Jackson as the lispy genius bad guy with his beautiful razor blade for feet sidekick is way way over the top and not to be taken too seriously. There is violence, chopped up people and exploding heads that look like a Busby Berkley multicolored dance done to rousing fireworks styled music and at the end you will see that the good guys vanquish the bad guys and you'll wonder how soon they will come out with a sequel.

Why did they ruin this movie by having them talk about anal sex at the end and show a woman's naked behind? I probably would have purchased this movie until they totally ruined it. They are more or less promoting a sexual activity that is immoral and dangerous and it had no place in this movie and is disgusting!!!

At some point, I hope, movie makers will rediscover the necessity and virtue of good story writing. This film relies entirely on grotesque fight scenes, relentless foul language and special fx which do absolutely nothing to further the film. The plot is really a basic James Bond-esque type of idea but the bloodlust overshadows any kind of cleverness. As with science, just because we can do a thing (creating a scene where a church load of people murder each other in the most hideous ways imaginable), doesn't mean we, necessarily, should.
I'm a vet filmmaker and know, this kind of story telling is neither entertainment, nor skilled...but the opposite in every way.

6948635,4,B00S1ITA2W,"Such a good movie.  Almost solid all the way through, but it seemed to melt at the end somewhat.  Almost as if someone else had written the ending, it simply went from magically serious and intense to overly comical and crude out of nowhere.  I didn't understand why they turned the head explosion part into these weird different playful colors with a circus like tune all of the sudden when it originally was such a traumatic and graphic thing.  It also didn't make sense why this kid that was being trained to be a man of class and manners was all the sudden quite excited about doing anal at the end when it seems like he had reached the height of being an kingsman.  A part that seemed not just unnecessary but wildly out of place with the rest of the movie.  It didn't fit at all and kind of left a bit of a stain on the ending of what was a very good movie.  Get rid of these odd parts and the weird Mortal Kombat style kick between him and Gazelle and this movie would've been truly perfect.

I don't think I would be so picky on these parts if they didn't seem so wildly out of place with the rest of the movie.  So well done almost the whole way, but just didn't seem to take itself seriously in the end.  Either that, or the ending was written/done by someone completely different.

Maybe society is innoculated by video games, etc. to be able to watch the ""parody"" of exploding heads in some scenes and the church massacre and see it as humorous in a ""Kill Bill"" sort of way, but it was so very ""off script"" from the rest of the movie that it will probably be shocking and offensive to viewers 40+.

6948710,2,B00S1ITA2W,"The ""Gentleman Spy"" genre is something that's existed for several decades now, with hundreds of books and films to its name, but the one that forever remains on everyone's lips and hearts is Ian Fleming's indisputable heavyweight champion of gentleman spies, James Bond. The character of Bond has spawned a slew of imitators and satires, sometimes within its own series (see the original CASINO ROYALE with David Niven and Peter Sellers). Obvious outright comedies like the AUSTIN POWERS series, adrenaline-fueled pre-pubescent actioners like the Vin Diesel vehicle XXX; even Bond himself felt so stale that he had to reinvent itself with the 2006 version of CASINO ROYALE as a grittier, more modern Bond. This brings us to KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE, the brainchild of comics creators Mark Millar (KICK-ASS) and Dave Gibbons (WATCHMEN) and co-writer/director Matthew Vaughn (X-MEN: FIRST CLASS) to make another mashup of 60's spy movie conventions with futuristic technology and post-modern irony. And while the film is undeniably watchable, like all of Vaughn's films, much of it can't quite find its footing.

The film opens in 1997 as a British secret agent team comprised of codenames from the court of Camelot (Lancelot, Arthur, etc.) storms a Middle Eastern terrorist compound, a mistake is made by Harry Hart aka Galahad (the incomparable Colin Firth) that gets their Lancelot killed. Lancelot's wife and child Eggsy are visited by Harry who leaves the very young Eggsy with a pin and to call the number if he ever gets in trouble. Fast forward to current day, and Eggsy (Taron Egerton)  is a young delinquent who's mother is involved with a mini crime boss. He gets into some serious trouble, calls the number, and Harry gets him out. He finds that Harry is a member of The Kingsmen, a truly secret service beholden to no government that fights evil around the world. And they've just lost ANOTHER Lancelot. Harry sees something more in Eggsy and invites him to go through a rigorous audition of sorts for the empty spot with a bunch of other young people while he investigates a seemingly benign and philanthropic tech billionaire, Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson, with a lisp) who may be responsible for Lancelot's death. Valentine sees the state of the world and has decided that humanity must go through a massive worldwide culling in order to restore a natural balance, which he will execute via free SIM cards and internet service that will send a signal to the brain that will seriously amplify the parts of the human brain responsible for aggression and violence. While ""Merlin"" (Mark Strong, playing Scottish) runs the young people ragged, and ""Arthur"" (Sir Michael Caine) sends the failed candidates home, Eggsy is the odd man out as the other candidates, with the exception of Roxy (Sophie Cookson), are all blue-bloods who see Eggsy as nothing more than a trashy ""pleb"". But of course, Eggsy excels at the training, and all seems to be going smoothly. But as soon as Valentine and his henchperson, Gazelle (Sofia Boutella, who has prosthetic legs with razor-sharp blades in them) runs his first test of his device in a Westboro Baptist Church-like gathering in Florida, everything goes to hell, and Eggsy and The Kingsmen have to step up to bat and save the world from Valentine's mad scheme.

Matthew Vaughn has yet to make a fully-formed and mature film, and KINGSMAN is just another example of this. Genres mix and match, and the mood swings are so incredibly uneven that the viewer can get whiplash not knowing whether the film is now being serious or if it's still tongue-in-cheek. The sequences of gleefully extreme violence that are peppered throughout the film, while extremely well-directed and shot, give no real service to the film other than another place where Vaughn can place a piece of popular music that he can use to juxtapose the shocking violence. This is a cheap gimmick he's used in pretty much all of his films since LAYER CAKE, and he uses it here with Lynyrd Skynyrd's guitar solo from ""Freebird"" over the church slaughter sequence. At a certain point, the violence is so unnecessary and so terrifying that it ceases being fun and just gets to be too much. This is exactly where Vaughn goes wrong with every film he makes. There's a difference between toeing the line, and flat-out not caring about the line, and that's why I've never liked or truly enjoyed one of his films. This same problem of not knowing where a line exists comes into even more specific relief with a awful, terrible, stupid and completely inexcusable joke near the end with a kidnapped princess and her offer of a very specific kind of sexual liaison if Eggsy rescues her.

It also doesn't help that this is Vaughn's second adaptation of a Mark Millar comic series. Millar, who is a comic writer with his own personal issues (extreme and often unnecessary violence, sexual abuse and assault, pretty rampant misogyny), obviously allowed Vaughn and co-writer Jane Goldman to play around with the comic a bit, but they kept just enough of Millar's missteps to keep this somewhat faithful, at least in tone, to the poorly-executed comic series. And while I really enjoyed Millar's initial KICK-ASS run (and furiously hated the subsequent attempts), Vaughn's adaptation of that was also incredibly mediocre.

This is not to say that there aren't good moments. Pretty much every scene with Firth is on fire as he makes his fellow performers look better in his presence, and his first real sequence in the bar fight is very entertaining. Egerton is a fine young actor with a good sense of timing, Cookson and Boutella do good work with what they have, and Strong is a lot of fun in this Q-like role. But Jackson, who is obviously having a good time with this role, doesn't really seem to be giving much to the film other than a lisped megalomaniac with a deep aversion to the sight of blood. Caine's role is really more of an extended cameo, and is obviously just cashing a check here. Fans of the comic series will have fun seeing Mark Hamill playing a kidnapped university professor because in the original comic, it's the actual Mark Hamill who's been kidnapped.

I see Matthew Vaughn as the poorer version of Edgar Wright; someone who is an obviously talented, and smart visual filmmaker and can put together incredible casts, but unlike Wright, he can't seem to make things smart enough or fun enough to keep the viewer truly satisfied. But if you liked his film version of KICK-ASS, it's pretty likely you'll enjoy KINGSMAN.

6948862,3,B00S1ITA2W,"I know this movie is based off of a graphic novel and I did like it overall but I have to say the over-use of the ""F"" word in this movie was entirely too much and very distracting.  I'm not a prude, I don't mind coarse language to a degree and I realize anytime Samuel L Jackson is in a movie it's going to occur, frequently.  This time however it was just too much and really it didn't feel as though it was either necessary or added a single thing to the story...at one point I swear it was used every other word.  It just felt like the writers wanted to see how many ""F"" bombs they could fit into the movie.  So honestly, if it hadn't been for that I would have rated the movie higher.  It was refreshing to see Colin Firth in this role, I've always thought he'd make a good spy character.  Oh and don't be fooled either because he is in it, this is a very violent film...definitely not one for the whole family if your family includes young ones.

Edited to add: I went and checked the count of the ""F"" bomb in this movie.  It was actually used 100 times, in a 129 minute movie!  Of course that's mixed in with other coarse language too, that the one single word was use that many times.

However, the level of violence that possesses this film throughout its entirety made it unpleasant to watch.

6948878,5,B00S1ITA2W,"Hello, I rarely write my opinion outside of social media unless I feel rather driven to do so either by a sense of feeling cheated by a flimsy product or in this case the desire to sing praise. I will mention certain things of the film which may ruin it for you if you have not seen the movie. I would ask you to go ahead and read the one star reviews, go on.... You will have noticed a few, common themes to the complaints.

  There is certainly foul language in this movie and some feel it was excessively used. I bring up my brother on the thunder mountain roller coaster in Disneyland Japan in the dark, in the rain. We were the only two people on it. He cursed from very beginning to the very end it was just that terrifying/exciting. In real life situations that is just how some people deal with it.  Secondly, some people made the suggestion that the scene involving the church was an attack on the entire religion as a whole. The movie required a test area where a mass death was going to play out  The villain in question chose that target for a reason. What better way to make a public spectacle to help him convince fence sitters to join his cause? Would you have preferred a massacre at Walmart? or a hospital? If it offends you that something your sensitive about was used by a bad guy to do bad things and he chose the worst behaving group of people to do those bad things to then great, Hate the bad guy, don't suggest the movie has an agenda of hate against that group.

  These were the two biggest things I saw in the bad reviews but then by the time you read this that may have changed. regardless I will mention this. This movie does not take itself seriously, You shouldn't take it seriously, The only thing about this movie that is serious, is the wardrobe, They literally hired a clothing designer to make the Kingsman suits for real and you can actually buy them. So, if you want to see something outrageous, watch this movie, but if your sensitive to language, paranoid that your belief system is being threatened by a film in any way. Don't watch it, read a book, there are nice ones out there that will let you remain in your comfortable bubble.",1431734400,,2173,4.321867321867322

There was some of that, but part way through the film it takes a very wrong turn into gratuitous violence, some of which is supposed to be amusing.  It isn't.  I won't give away the plot for anyone who really wants to see this, but it just spirals downward at top speed after an enjoyable if predictable first half.  What a waste of a cast.

6948886,1,B00S1ITA2W,"This movie was enjoyable if entirely predictable until the closing scene. They took an otherwise 3.5 - 4 star movie and ruined it with one crass line. It was so out of place for the movie that it's worth reporting. I saw this in the theater so perhaps they'll include a different version on video.

Here's the spoiler

The line that ruined the movie:
Swedish princess to hero: if you survive, we can have sex in the ass.

Hero saves the day and returns to her cell with champagne. Closing shot: her ass.

After 90 minutes of demonstrating heroic training of body and mind they slap you with pre-teen boy fantasy soft core. It was so out of place for this movie and it is so unbelievably crass. I cannot recommend the movie. It took me from a fan girl ""Yeah, they saved the world again,"" to ""Holy Sh*t, did he just say that? What?""

I live in NYC. I am used to mighty crass behavior. I worked in commercial construction - I'm used to totally inappropriate comments. This was just so out of place that it was jarring. Who let that through the edits? Was an 11 year old boy producing this? How did Colin Firth get behind this? It's his name plastered all over it. Samuel Jackson? Quality characters, delayed (by many month) release to be out for Valentine's Day, and that's how they want you leaving the theater?

As said by someone who waited over a year for this to come out, this movie went from a 4+ star to total fail in that one line.",1431734400,89,1437,4.323420074349443

6948899,4,B00S1ITA2W,"Here's an idea for you -- James Bond in the style of ""Kick Ass,"" with a side of Harry Potter. Awesome? Awful?

Yeah, ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" -- based on Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons's comic book series -- could have been the biggest, most grotesque flop in years. Instead, it ends up being a quirky, clever spy thriller that uses all the cliches in fresh ways -- it has the updated villains and razor-edged violence of newer spy movies movies, combined with the style and Empire sensibilities of the older ones. Also, Colin Firth as a secret agent.

Smart but aimless, Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin is like thousands of other working-class British youths -- he lives in a rotten little apartment with his neurotic mother and abusive stepfather, and has gotten in some scrapes with the law. The one unusual thing about him is that when his father died under classified circumstances, and a mysterious man named Harry Hart (Colin Firth) left him with a medal, a phone number, and a code phrase for if the Unwin family ever needed help.

When he's arrested for car theft, Eggsy calls the number and is promptly bailed out by Hart. He soon finds out that Hart isn't just an aristocratic gentleman -- he's a Kingsman agent who can easily take down a whole pub full of thugs. So when Eggsy is offered a new life as a Kingsman, he takes it immediately. There's only one opening, but his street smarts, kindness and intelligence put him far ahead of the Oxbridge-educated youths he's competing against.

While he's undergoing a grueling training regimen, the Kingsmen are investigating a plot involving a kidnapped professor, a dead Kingsman agent, and the lisping billionaire Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson). Celebrities and world dignitaries are going missing, and Valentine's plans for the world may be the most devastating ever. Can the Kingsmen  new and old  bring him down?

Kingsman: The Secret Service is a fascinating take on the whole secret agent cliche. It both subverts (Eggsy) and affectionately homages (Harry) the whole idea of the upper-crust secret agent who loves fine liquor, fine suits and dangerous missions -- and unlike many a homage, is entirely entertaining in its own right. This is the kind of movie where a diabolical villain has a giant cheesy prison where he keeps everyone who won't agree to his master plan!

And it has some gloriously over-the-top action scenes, including some Bond-style goons (including an acrobatic assassin with bladed prosthetic legs) and stylishly gruesome violence (flips, flying teeth, heads exploding with fireworks), which are glorious when handled with the sort of sleek, elegant style of the Kingsmen (one of them catches a glass of fine whisky in mid-fight because ""It would be a sin to spill any""). Paired with that is a wicked sense of humor, such as a villain who plans to kill everyone on the planet... but can't cope with the sight of blood.

But it also has a surprising amount of substance, mainly by looking at the class system still unofficially in place in, among other places, England. The leader of the Kingsmen makes it clear that he wants ""the right sort"" to be these positions, and Eggsy has to complete with a bunch of people who have all the advantages in life. ""... judging people like from your ivory towers, with no thought about why we do what we do."" Kids like Eggsy can do great things, but only if given the opportunity.

What flaws does it have? Well, the whole ""Kingsman education"" sequence is skimmed over as quickly as they can manage (partly by putting Harry in a months-long movie coma), but it STILL kills all momentum going on in the movie. Things don't pick up again until Eggsy is almost finished.

The elder Kingsmen are a who's-who of beloved British actors -- Michael Caine, Mark Strong, and of course Colin Firth as a gloriously gentlemanly agent who can take out a whole pub full of thugs with only an umbrella and a watch. He has good fatherly chemistry with Taron Egerton, a brashly endearing youth who just needs a door opened to show off that he's smart (despite not knowing a pug from a bulldog), strong and compassionate. And of course, Jackson is clearly having the time of his life as an old-school destroy-the-world villain who serves McDonald's at his exclusive dinner parties.

Despite losing its way in the training montage, ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" is a fun, wild adventure that blows a kiss to the old-timey spy thrillers, while also carving out a niche of its own with bladed feet. Smart, sleek and entertainingly violent.",1431129600,45,4541,4.815147625160463

6948902,5,B00S1ITA2W,"I absolutely loved this movie! While there are some problematic parts (ie the end scene with the princess, lack of diversity on the protagonist's side) overall I rate it very highly. Not only do we get to see the wonderful Colin Firth acting as a badass gentleman spy, but Taron Egerton seems to have made it big with this one, and he's a total cutie. I thought the acting was very well done, if not a tad overboard at times. There was quite a lot of violence, but it wasn't overly gory, and most of it had an important point. In fact, even the church scene, while it was incredibly violent, it creates a very interesting conflict in the viewer, because you're supposed to dislike the hategroup, and get easily swept up in the scene, but then, as Colin Firth's character becomes aware of what he's done, so does the viewer, and you have to ask yourself what your take on that violence was. We also get a super rad female supervillian (because honestly, you'd be lying if you didn't think she was behind much of the evil plans,) Samuel L. Jackson playing a ridiculous evil genius, and, quite honestly, a very interesting social commentary on violence, politicians, and climate change. I thought it was very clear that it was supposed to be somewhat of a parody of the classic James Bond films, and yet was still unique. I can't wait for a sequel!",1430956800,2,1345,4.516393442622951
6948903,4,B00S1ITA2W,"Director and co-writer (along with Jane Goldman) Matthew Vaughn's ""Kingsman : The Secret Service"" (based on a popular comic book whose influence is visible in the overall style of this cinematic affair but doesn't weigh it down by being too obvious about its roots) is a fun, entertaining and often hilarious and equally inventive homage to early Bond films. Respectful of spy cliches and smart enough to avoid them (which is all expressed through the well-developed screenplay's sharp-eye for dialogue), the film is elevated by a cool and sophisticated performance from Colin Firth, as Harry Hart, which matches the overall atmosphere of the film beautifully.

Samuel L Jackson is obviously having a blast with his distinctly villainous role and it shows. Not only does it have the satisfying amount of unique action scenes (which are occasionally hindered by a few Matrix-like slow motion shots) once we get into the motion picture's final forty minutes, as this is a character oriented thrill ride and actually takes its time to develop the story and build tension cleverly as we get to know the characters which populate the screen, it also has an equal amount of heart. That combination is rare and is one of the many things that makes this motion picture work so well.

""Kingsmen: The Secret Service"" could have easily fell into the trappings of many modern parities and felt the need to have a joke a minute. This movie is wise enough to use humor only when it's necessary and it's spices up the proceedings and never takes away from the story even if the pace of Its 129 minute movie is a little uneven at times answer me a small price to pay for a film that works this well on so many levels and make sure to totally tied up as many plot threads as possible with a final post credits scene that is a nice return to the beginning and a wink at the audience that seems a very clever and fitting conclusion to all that came before it.

The frequent jabs at religion and America's obsession with technology only heighten the appeal as does its charmingly lit backdrops and appropriately vibrant cinematography making ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" a great way to escape the real world for a little over two hours and enjoy yourself. Some may find a particular scene inside a church offensive but, it is the fact that beneath its approachable interior it has a bit of angry streak that is all intended to make us think about our society, our own actions as it engages us with what lies on the surface. I guess, ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" is a lot like Colin Firth and his child protg, Eggsby, that way: a gentleman in the classic definition but within its heart lies a savage animal waiting to break free and strike when the opportunity presents itself.",1430697600,6,2761,4.700413223140496

Another film in which there was blood and action was Pierce Brosnan's ""November Man.""  It was certainly action-packed and had its share of blood, but nothing like the gratuitous gross out fest that was Kingsman.

It doesn't hurt that he looks gorgeous in his Kinsman attire. He gets better looking with age.  The Pub and Church Scenes are particularly fantastic. Too bad he was not cast as Bond instead of Pierce Brosnan. I like Pierce Brosnan, but Firth's acting ability puts him in  another league.

6948924,5,B00S1ITA2W,"Kingsman: The Secret Service was founded (and funded) by wealthy families after WWI who found themselves with no heirs. They could see the flaws in their government and its intelligence gathering, so they created a powerful, richly funded organization that NO one knows about or even suspects.

This R-rated (language and violence) action/comedy/adventure is directed by Matthew Vaughn (""Layer Cake"" and ""X-Men: First Class""). After a bloody opening, this unpredictable romp sets off with a parcour chase through city streets, and demonstrates enough gadgets to impress even Q, of James Bond fame. We see a raw kid recruited for training as a super spy, then we watch him learn the ropes while a gleeful villain launches a brilliant plot.

We see:
  * Colin Firth (""The King's Speech"") Harry Hart/Galahad is the recruiter. Our young hero's father had saved Galahad's life at the cost of his own. Dapper Galahad has echoes of Steed from TV's original ""Avengers"" (including a bullet-proof umbrella) and a tongue-in-cheek Sean Connery from early ""Bond"" movies.
  * Taron Egerton (""Testament of Youth"") Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin is the recruit I just mentioned. He's a street tough burdened with a mother who has been going downhill ever since his father died.
  * Samuel L. Jackson (""The Avengers"") Did I mention an R-rating? Evil Valentine has a plan to save the world and he's rich enough to do it! I'll bet his product placements for McDonald's Happy Meal and Google Glass help!
  * Mark Strong (""The Guard"") Merlin can sort out the applicants until there is only one left standing. This is the perfect role for Strong: It's great to see this wonderful actor (finally!) granted the screen time he so richly deserves.
  * Michael Caine (""Interstellar"") Arthur explains to our hero what the villain is doing, and why.
  * Sofia Boutella (""StreetDance 2"") is Gazelle, can you guess what she brings to the table? Not only mad hand-to-hand combat skills, but a razor-sharp blade attached to her leg. Emma Peel should have been so lucky!

This carefully choreographed martial arts violence is gruesome and bloody, but the movie is so cartoony our screening audience laughed at that church congregation, and then applauded when the cigarette lighter/ grenade mowed down some enemies. It was also fun to watch our hero bond with the puppy he selected; he thought it would grow up to be a bulldog but it was actually a pug!",1427846400,3,2407,4.95273631840796

Fun, action packed, hilarious, and legitimately Bad. Ass.

The acting is great as Colin Firth along with all the appropriately chosen cast members do well to deliver the fact that they are Kingsman.
The villain, played by Samuel L. Jackson with his lisp is genious, in both character and portrayal. (I mean what else do you expect from Samuel?)

The tone suggests a nod to films like James Bond while diving head first into its own, kinetic identity.
Its comical but in a good way. Its not overly dark and serious but instead encourages a bit of fun amongst the chaos in the movie.

The movie isn't without its violence, and it can be graphic at times. Even when the movie becomes violent, brutal and at times plain vicious, its all delivered in a tasteful flavor that suits the film without being overly gritty. Think Kick-Ass.

Overal, the movie pans out well with a lot of fun and surprises to be had. From some of the smart-written dialogue bits and its general ability to live up to expectations (or even surpass them), to some of the plain coolest action sequences I've ever seen, this movie has earned a high place in my favorites.

6948937,4,B00S1ITA2W,"Kingsman: The Secret Service
****1/2

There aren't a lot of films that can surprise me. ""Kingsman"", the new film from director Matthew Vaughn (""X-Men: First Class"", ""Stardust"", ""Kick-Ass"") does that. And does it more than once. There aren't a lot of films that can pay homage to a particularly well-known film series while simultaneously giving the genre a few licks. ""Kingsman"" does that. And does it well. And many films don't manage to get me so thoroughly wrapped up in everything going on.

Galahad (Colin Firth), Lancelot (Jack Davenport) and Merlin (Mark Strong), members of the super secret Kingsmen, a group tasked with preventing the baddest of the bad from going through with their plans, attempts to stop a terrorist plot in the Middle East. It goes very wrong when the detainee reveals a bomb about to go off and the newest member of the group sacrifices himself to save the others. When they return to England, Galahad, or Harry Hart, visits the family of his fallen comrade in one of the council flats. The wife is naturally upset and doesn't want anything to do with the promises Harry makes her. Harry gives a small token with a phone number and a code word to the widow's young son. Flash forward ten years and Eggsy (Taron Egerton, lots of British TV) is a twenty-something getting into trouble with the cops and his mom's boyfriend's gang of uneducated violent thugs. Arrested, he remembers the token and the code word and decides to use them. Within minutes, he is released and Harry is waiting for him outside, ready to recruit him as the newest member of the Kingsmen. The boyfriend's thugs interrupt their conversation in the local pub, leading Harry to demonstrate some of his skills, impressing Eggsy enough to prompt him to join the group of young recruits, each brought in by a member of the Kingsmen. Arthur (Michael Caine) doesn't hold a lot of hope for Eggsy. Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), an internet bazillionaire, believes the Earth is being killed by all of the humans polluting it and wasting the natural resources. He begins a plan to help the planet by getting rid of a good number of the humans overpopulating it, while saving the select few politicians, celebrities, etc. willing to go along. His sidekick, Gazelle (Sofia Boutella), runs around on legs fitted with large blades, instead of feet. Soon, Harry and their team turn their eye to Valentine and a plan takes shape.

Co-written by Vaughn and Jane Goldman (""Kick-Ass"") and directed by Vaughn, ""Kingsman"" is a pretty great mix of laughs, action, surprises and all of the elements that we want from a James Bond film.

This is what Vaughn does best; he takes well-established genre films and injects a much more modern sensibility and humor into them, making them more interesting and memorable.  In ""X-Men: First Class"", he led a new group of actors, all playing well-established characters, to create a newer, fresher take on a popular movie series. The same could be said of ""Kick-Ass"", but the reimagining is broader and more extreme because he is crafting a new storyline and an entirely new set of characters. Also, because he isn't confined by a well-established timeline, he can basically do what he wants and takes the narrative and characters to unexpected places.

""Kingsman"" is a new creation (based on a graphic novel) and this allows Vaughn and Goldman to start from the beginning and introduce us to most of this world through their eyes.

Perhaps the best thing about ""Kingsman"" is the casting of Colin Firth as the very dapper, super secret agent code-named Galahad. Firth is always a joy to watch, even when the movie may be less than superb, but here he is simply the perfect person to play Harry Hart. Dapper to a T, Harry is the epitome of British style and sophistication. A large part of the Kingsmen philosophy is that every agent should have an impeccably made suit, which is, of course, bulletproof, and Harry wears his like a second skin. Because he seems so sophisticated, it is a lot of fun, and a bit surprising, when he breaks into action, dispatching a large group of thugs with a very unique tool. And this dichotomy between his image and his abilities makes him more interesting to watch. Its also funny to watch Harry break into a choreographed fight wearing a finely tailored suit more appropriate for people going to work in the Financial District of any capital city.

The second best thing is the casting of Samuel Jackson as Valentine. From the moment he is introduced, speaking with a pronounced lisp, he brings just the right amount of menace to his role, giving us a taste of his philosophy and his madness. Even better, the background behind his reasoning isn't far off, which makes him seem a little more human and natural. And, in turn, more menacing.

Jackson and Vaughn are not afraid to play with the stereotype of both the Internet Billionaire and the Super Villain, giving him little hints of Bill Gates and broader hints of Blofeld. When Valentine and Harry have their initial meeting, to self-knowingly test each person's boundaries, the food served at the dinner is fast food, rather than the promised fancy meal. Its a moment funny enough to make me overlook the possible product placement.

In fact, the casting throughout is spot on, elevating the film a couple of notches. The transformation of Eggsy from streetwise thug to a dapper, well-suited member of the Kingsmen is really fun to watch. And Taron Egerton does a great job because he is able to maintain the persona throughout even as he clearly changes.

Mark Strong is great as Merlin; the group's equivalent of ""Q"", he provides technical support, taking over the training of the new recruits and providing some more practical support when their mission kicks in. Merlin is a stoic guy, yet Strong manages to convey a lot through subtle facial expressions.

Jack Davenport and Mark Hamill have smaller, supporting roles. Hamill is the real surprise because we so rarely get to see him actually play a character, on screen, in a big budget film. Maybe it is usually a blessing, I'm not 100% sure. I know that he does a lot of voice work for animation. Here, plays a scientist who holds one of the keys to Valentine's plan.

It is also nice to see Michael Caine in a bigger role, a role where he doesn't look like he is about to keel over (see ""Interstellar"" for a good example of this). As Arthur, he leads the group and provides them with the authority they need to continue with their mission. But he also realizes Harry is primed to take over the leadership of the group and is preparing to pass the torch.

Really, I wish Matthew Vaughn would make more films. Or maybe I don't. Maybe it is the amount of time and effort he puts into each new adventure that makes them so good. Each time we get to see some of his work, I start to wonder why more movies can't be as good.

In ""Kingsman"", the almost ideal balance between parody and homage is achieved. For almost every jab at ""James Bond"", there is a loving wink or tribute to something else so well-known about the series. And because this is done so well, it creates a feeling of freshness, setting ""Kingsman"" apart. There are many references to ""that kind of movie"" giving a subtle nod at some of the conventions of the spy genre. But these moments are interspersed with a very rigorous training program - each member of the Kingsmen recommends a new recruit. As the training continues, certain candidates are eliminated, both literally and figuratively. Until there are only two left. Because everyone takes everything so seriously, they make it seem a little more real. So when the wink-wink nudge-nudge moments happen, they more commonly surprise.

""Kingsman"" really starts to veer more towards Bond when the Valentine story starts to take center stage. This isn't a bad thing because by this point, we are more familiar with all of the characters and shenanigans, allowing us to more easily accept the over-the-top nature of these elements. This is a pretty brilliant thing, because these moments are pretty outlandish and the fact we are willing to accept them and go along with them at all is a small miracle. But Vaughn seems to work a miracle here.

The most significant problem with ""Kingsman"" is that it is too long. It runs about 129 minutes and it seems to lag a bit, but I can't honestly think of what should be cut.

""Kingsman"" is easily one of the best films I have seen in some time. In fact, I eagerly await the sequel because I want to see more of what Vaughn has imagined for this story and these characters.",1426464000,8,8595,4.718666666666667

However, Galahad has his work cut out for him because Valentine also has a talented and lethal femme fatale named Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) in his corner and loyally by his side.

6948951,4,B00S1ITA2W,"It's one thing to create a spoof of a familiar genre - in this case, the James Bond kind of secret agent. It's quite another to create a movie that stands on its own as an action/adventure flick worth the popcorn. And it's yet another to create a flick that's both. That is what this movie pulls off, both, and does so in style.

It starts with some familiar tropes: troubled kid given a second chance, tough-but-fair training sergeant (or close enough), rich megalomaniac, and plot to destroy the world except for his chose few. Instead of simple cliches, though, these become the familiar framework on which the rest of the story hangs.

Colin Firth turns in a great performance as a perfectly turned-out gentleman-buttkicker. Samuel L. Jackson brings serious goofiness to the evil billionaire character (Big Macs? Really?), while keeping the proper aura of menace. Michael Caine adds gravitas by playing the leader of the good guys - making the surprise in his character even more surprising. And the effect-meisters - they outdid themselves. Sofia Boutella's ""Gazelle"" character with her unique footwear seemed utterly convincing, and a big scene near the end brought a Dr. Seuss sensibility to what could have been gratuitous gore.

6948953,5,B00S1ITA2W,"When I first saw the trailer for Kingsman: The Secret Service, it seemed like a bit of an eye-roller. It looked like a forgettable action comedy with stupid one-liners and standardized action built for people who like movies like Real Steel or Agent Cody Banks. I was wrong. More movies need to be like Kingsman: The Secret Service, and there are three reasons why.

Reason number one: It's rated R. This movie could have easily been chopped up and delivered with a PG-13 rating, good for all ages, sans balls (I'm talking about you, Expendables 3). It wasn't. The action here is fantastic, full of glorious head trauma, exit wounds, and broken bones. One scene in particular - set in a church - is one of the coolest scenes you'll see all year.

Reason number two: It's an original property. Yes, I know it's based on a comic book called 'The Secret Service', but it basically just borrows loose plot points from it. I wish more studios would take chances on unknown entities instead of churning out sequels, remakes and superhero flicks. That being said, I bet this gets a sequel...hopefully still helmed by Matthew Vaughn. When someone else takes over something that he made, we get crap like Kick-Ass 2.

Reason number three: It was fun. It took itself just seriously enough that it didn't border on parody, like the last two Pierce Brosnan Bond movies that nearly killed the series (The World is Not Enough and Die Another Day). There were serious, heartfelt moments mixed in with a ton of levity. It paid a ton of homage to classic spy movies while being a blast to watch. Rarely do I leave movies saying to myself, ""I need to own that"", but this one fit that bill.

The year is young, but I'm pretty confident that when 2015 is over, there will be no bigger cinematic surprise than Kingsman: The Secret Service. It's not perfect - it drags a bit at points and Samuel L. Jackson's lisp is eternally grating, but every actor aside from him is fantastic (including Colin Firth, which I never thought I'd say), the action is amazing, and the gadgets are fun. If you're into action or spy movies, Kingsman is a must see.

6948956,5,B00S1ITA2W,"Chances are all you need to know to get a read on the sheer lunacy/genius of Kingsman: The Secret Service is the man who created it: Mark Millar. He's the comic book writer who previously gave us genre send-ups Wanted and Kick-Ass. Basically what Millar is good at is coming up with incredible concepts that strip down a genre to its most essential elements to reveal why we loved them in the first place, and if he delivers a swift boot to the arse of a few tired genres then so much the better. And after deconstructing action movies and superhero films he's turned his attention to the espionage flick, which frankly needs to get flipped over given a good spanking. And get spanked it does; Kingsman: The Secret Service is easily one of the best times you're going to have at the movies, and will make you forget all about that stuffy James Bond flick coming later this year.

I've often compared Millar's comics, and thus his adaptations, as cinematic junk food. They're a crazy high for a couple of hours and then you crash and it's over. But there's so much more to Kingsman: The Secret Service that it won't be so easily forgotten. Directed by Millar's pal, Matthew Vaughn, the film is like Mission: Impossible cranked up to '11', and everything that implies. Want wildly improbable super gadgets? Check. Crazy villains with weirdly distinct quirks? Check. Hot, dangerous babes? Check. Globe-hopping adventures? Check. Unlike Kick-Ass, one never gets the sense that the aim is to actually ""take down' the genre; rather it's like an adolescent boy was given the keys to the kingdom to do with as he pleases. The result is that every straight-up spy movie that comes along for a while is going to get compared to Kingsman, and probably not in a favorable way.

For an idea just how silly and self-referentially awesome Kingsman is, just keep in mind that it references everything from My Fair Lady to pretty much every James Bond movie with Roger Moore, while having fun with every single spy clich under the sun. In the ""My Fair Lady"" portion of the plot, the story centers on a troubled London kid named Eggsy (Taron Egerton) who is recruited into a super-secret spy organization by a man named Harry Hart (Colin Firth), a sort of new-age 007. Harry owes his life to Eggsy's father, and as a means of repayment has brought the boy into the fold for training, which amounts to one life-or-death ordeal after another. The Kingsmen prove to be a peculiar organization based on the concept of the Knights of the Round Table, but based out of a high-end tailor shop. Harry is sir Galahad, Michael Caine leads the group as Arthur, and Mark Strong is the chief weapons dude, nicknamed Merlin naturally. If Harry survives training he'll be the new Lancelot, but that's a pretty big IF.

Spending too much time winking at the audience with pop culture references can get annoying pretty quick, and most of Millar's work has a conceited streak that is hard to tolerate, but Kingsman is such a labor of love done with such incredible energy that it's never a problem. Everything Vaughn and Millar give us is exactly what we want from the genre before it became all serious. In fact, a terrific conversation on the doom 'n gloom of spy movies takes place (over MacDonald's Big Macs, of course) between Harry and tech magnate/terrorist Richard Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), a silly twist on the old school Bond villain. He's dressed like some kind of immature hip-hop mogul, talks with a lisp only Mike Tyson could love, and has a bad ass chick by his side (Sofia Boutella) who has knives for legs. What's not to like about that? And lest one think it completely gives in to the common tropes, think again; what keeps Kingsman fresh is how it subverts our expectations to deliver a new experience. There are shockingly lethal turns that come out of nowhere, and the hyper violence is sometimes incredibly dark and other times played for comic head-exploding effect. That the film manages to be all things successfully is a credit to Vaughn and co-writer Jane Goldman, who deliver homage with style and wit to spare. Part of that brilliance is due to the casting, and you'll be surprised to learn that Colin Firth kicking ass isn't the main thing that stands out. While he's great and suave just like we'd expect him to be as a super-agent, Firth really plays second fiddle to Egerton who emerges as the break out star with a certain streetwise charm. And of course, Jackson is at his over-the-top best when given free reign to be as insane as he wants to be.

It's pretty amazing to see how far Vaughn has developed as a filmmaker. Let's not forget he's the same guy who gave us Layer Cake, which served as a soft introduction to Daniel Craig for a lot of people. He's also the guy who reinvigorated the X-men franchise with his kitschy, nostalgic X-men: First Class. Kingsman actually shares a number of aesthetic and tonal similarities with that film; from the juggling of multiple plots seamlessly to the overall throwback vibe. Yes, Kingman feels old school while clearly setting itself as a spy movie for a new generation. Difficult balance to walk? Yes indeed, but Vaughn and Co. do it without fail. The only time when the film begins to falter is in the final stretch when its playfulness hinders our understanding of the stakes, but otherwise this is easily the best Vaughn/Millar collaboration yet. If anything, Kingsman: The Secret Service proves that the old spy movies, cheesy as they often were, are still pretty cool.",1424908800,,5526,4.705578512396694
6948957,5,B00S1ITA2W,"Kingsman: The Secret Service

As we drove to the movies I was hoping that The Kingsman: The Secret Service was going to be good. My wife Patti was still complaining about the last two movies I picked (Jupiter Ascending and Foxcatcher). So I was hoping that The Kingsman would be better than those. To be fair...being better than Foxcatcher is not a particularly high bar.

The Kingsman had three big things going for it. (1) A hugely talented cast that includes Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Caine and the relatively unknown Taron Egerton. Based on his performance in this movie I'm predicting big things from Egerton.  (2) A tightly written script written by Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn that managed to achieve an almost perfect balance between plot, action and humor. (3) The movie was brilliantly directed by Mathew Vaughn, producing an almost perfectly paced and perfectly structured movie. Vaughn managed to take the kind of action one would expect from John Woo or Samo Hung and make it very British.

The story revolves around a ultra-secret British spy organization. Using a Saville Row tailor shop as a cover, the organization recruits young men from Britain's best families and trains them to deadly proficiency in hand-to-hand, weaponry and an assortment of other skills. Kingsman are the best dressed, best equipped and best mannered spies in the world, and operate so secretly that even the CIA has never heard of them.

(SPOILER ALERT)

The story begins during a secret mission in the Middle-East where a secret agent code named Galahad (Colin Firth) has captured a terrorist and proceeds to interrogate him. But Galahad has missed a bomb hidden on the terrorist. Just before Galahad and his companions are about to be killed, his young  (working class) protg falls on the bomb and saves everyone's life.  Feeling guilty about his mistake, Galahad delivers a medal and promise to the young agent's family. When they need his help, they will have it.

19 years later, the deceased agent's son Gary is a young man with a good heart but few prospects. Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin (Egerton) is unemployed and living with his mother who has become the girlfriend of the neighborhood crime boss. He had joined up with the Royal Marines but left early to look after his mother. A neighborhood bully who happens to be a lieutenant of that crime boss is looking for any reason to deliver Eggsy an ass-kicking. Eggsy and two friends steal the bully's car, which Eggsy crashes to keep his buddies from being arrested. Facing prison, he calls on Galahad for that promise of help. Galahad arranges for Eggsy's release, and arranges for the young man to be recruited to fill an open position in the Kingsmen. But first Eggsy must prove himself in a grueling training program that pits cadet against cadet in a series of no-win tests.

While Eggsy is training, Galahad is investigating a series of kidnappings and disappearances related to a new type of WMD, one that causes anyone exposed to become murderously violent. He traces the disappearances to American tech billionaire Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson). Valentine is a radical environmentalist who thinks the only way to save the Earth is to kill most of its human population. But Galahad is murdered before he can complete his mission and it's up to Eggsy to prevent the greatest crime in history.

Yes it's all formulaic. But seldom has a formula movie been so original and so surprising. I loved this movie. But when the lights came up I was anxiously waiting for my wife's verdict. ""That was really fun,"" she said with a big smile. Maybe I'll even get to pick the next movie.",1424822400,114,3648,4.85829307568438
6948958,3,B00S1ITA2W,"FINALLY got out to the movies to see this today.  Ive REALLY been looking forward to it  the trailers/previews for it looked very good.  While it was a good storyline, and Id say it was worth renting, it was not without some big mistakes by the director, costume person, sound editor and perhaps casting.  I don't see this being up for any awards in the future.  Most people probably thought this was a decent movie It was a good story with sequel potential and some good acting and worth a rent (where you can control the volume).  It just couldve been better.  It SHOULDVE been better.  Didnt quite live up to our expectations.  The girl with the slice & dice legs was a great character.

Ill never have writing skills or the movie education that Siskel & Ebert had but let me know if you agree with these observations/opinions if youve seen the movie  or when you eventually do.
The GOOD.
Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Michael Caine, Sofia Boutella and Nicholas Agnew gave very good performances.

The BAD

DIRECTING:
  For some asinine reason, they decided that Samuel Jacksons character should have a speech impediment, (a lisp?) which added NOTHING to the character or movie and was basically just stupid and annoying. Even if the comic book character had this, they still shouldve left it out. It was truly horrible and pointless.
  The girl (Sophia Cookson?) who finally makes the (#1) spot to be a Kingsman, (its not really much of a spoiler) by the time she gets her big assignment is like totally not up to the role any more than someone they got off the street  she shouldve been more polished/capable/confident/professional/on it like a James Bond agent  she shouldve been slick.
  We didn't care for the performance (or choice of Taron Egerton) for the main boy - he wasn't horrible but just not good enough, not right for the part.  Some of the blame is of course on the director, but I think a part of it was that it was also just the wrong person in the role.

WARDROBE:
  The wardrobe person should be out of the business for this  this person is ridiculously in love with plaid pants, plaid suits that were ENTIRELY inappropriate (most of the time).  An example is the main Kingsman agent (a polished, proper gentleman, who gets tailored suits and is someone who would have impeccable taste) shows up to a Gala party in a formal dressy black dinner jacket looking totally formal and then they pan down and its paired with plaid slacks!!  WTH?  Also at times, its like shes confused with what time period the movie is in.

SOUND:
  in the BIG action scenes where the movie should have the amped up music  the volume was WAY over an acceptable level for a loud scene (WHY do they do this?!!) and a number of us in the audience had to watch these parts covering our ears!  [Ive found on many TV series and in movies over the last couple decades the sound people are out of controlso many times the actors are talking very quietly and the stupid sound crew has the background/mood music so loud you cant hear them.  Irritates the crap out of me that they would make such a stupid mistake.  The sound is supposed to ENHANCE the movie, not overwhelm or drown it out.  Why cant they get that?!  Director Peter Jackson understood this in his movies - others should take note.]

OK, so theres my 2-cents (and then some), but like I said  its still a fairly decent story and worth a home rental. ...It would be nice to have sequels but I sincerely hope they are done much better than this.",1424822400,5,3494,4.519169329073482
6948959,5,B00S1ITA2W,4.5 stars. This is a James Bond style movie with a good sense of humor and a classy style. Very good script. The final part is a little lame (action only) but bearable. Colin Firth is surprisingly good as a spy.,1424736000,3,211,4.170731707317073
6948960,4,B00S1ITA2W,"""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" is a entertaining spy action movie with a loaded cast and a tongue-in-cheek delivery. The movie cleverly remixes elements from the classic James Bond movies. Our hero is a young British street punk named Eggsy, recruited for the Secret Service by Harry Hart, a man once saved by Eggsy's father. Eggsy undergoes specialized agent training, finishing just in time to help deal with a wealthy madman with a massive plot to change the world. A series of wonderful action sequences are nicely mixed with moments of humor, as the producers share the secret that, yes, this is really a knockoff, but aren't we having a good time (and the viewer should be)...

Colin Firth is suave and convincing as Harry Hart, who sees the promise in young Eggsy. Michael Caine is Arthur, head of the Secret Service, and one of several ""Knights of the Round Table"" references. Mark Hamill has a nice cameo as an environmental scientist, highlighting the movie's occasion political satire. Samuel L Jackson is over-the-top in best James Bond fashion as the villain of the piece. Mark Armstrong helps carry the movie as the agent instructor. Young unknown Taron Egerton steals it as Eggsy. Recommended as good fun.",1424736000,3,1220,4.951219512195122

6948965,4,B00S1ITA2W,"Here's an idea for you -- James Bond in the style of ""Kick Ass,"" with a side of Harry Potter. Awesome? Awful?

Yeah, ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" -- based on Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons's comic book series -- could have been the biggest, most grotesque flop in years. Instead, it ends up being a quirky, clever spy thriller that uses all the cliches in fresh ways -- it has the updated villains and razor-edged violence of newer spy movies movies, combined with the style and Empire sensibilities of the older ones. Also, Colin Firth as a secret agent.

Smart but aimless, Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin is like thousands of other working-class British youths -- he lives in a rotten little apartment with his neurotic mother and abusive stepfather, and has gotten in some scrapes with the law. The one unusual thing about him is that when his father died under classified circumstances, and a mysterious man named Harry Hart (Colin Firth) left him with a medal, a phone number, and a code phrase for if the Unwin family ever needed help.

When he's arrested for car theft, Eggsy calls the number and is promptly bailed out by Hart. He soon finds out that Hart isn't just an aristocratic gentleman -- he's a Kingsman agent who can easily take down a whole pub full of thugs. So when Eggsy is offered a new life as a Kingsman, he takes it immediately. There's only one opening, but his street smarts, kindness and intelligence put him far ahead of the Oxbridge-educated youths he's competing against.

While he's undergoing a grueling training regimen, the Kingsmen are investigating a plot involving a kidnapped professor, a dead Kingsman agent, and the lisping billionaire Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson). Celebrities and world dignitaries are going missing, and Valentine's plans for the world may be the most devastating ever. Can the Kingsmen  new and old  bring him down?

Kingsman: The Secret Service is a fascinating take on the whole secret agent cliche. It both subverts (Eggsy) and affectionately homages (Harry) the whole idea of the upper-crust secret agent who loves fine liquor, fine suits and dangerous missions -- and unlike many a homage, is entirely entertaining in its own right. This is the kind of movie where a diabolical villain has a giant cheesy prison where he keeps everyone who won't agree to his master plan!

And it has some gloriously over-the-top action scenes, including some Bond-style goons (including an acrobatic assassin with bladed prosthetic legs) and stylishly gruesome violence (flips, flying teeth, heads exploding with fireworks), which are glorious when handled with the sort of sleek, elegant style of the Kingsmen (one of them catches a glass of fine whisky in mid-fight because ""It would be a sin to spill any""). Paired with that is a wicked sense of humor, such as a villain who plans to kill everyone on the planet... but can't cope with the sight of blood.

But it also has a surprising amount of substance, mainly by looking at the class system still unofficially in place in, among other places, England. The leader of the Kingsmen makes it clear that he wants ""the right sort"" to be these positions, and Eggsy has to complete with a bunch of people who have all the advantages in life. ""... judging people like from your ivory towers, with no thought about why we do what we do."" Kids like Eggsy can do great things, but only if given the opportunity.

What flaws does it have? Well, the whole ""Kingsman education"" sequence is skimmed over as quickly as they can manage (partly by putting Harry in a months-long movie coma), but it STILL kills all momentum going on in the movie. Things don't pick up again until Eggsy is almost finished.

The elder Kingsmen are a who's-who of beloved British actors -- Michael Caine, Mark Strong, and of course Colin Firth as a gloriously gentlemanly agent who can take out a whole pub full of thugs with only an umbrella and a watch. He has good fatherly chemistry with Taron Egerton, a brashly endearing youth who just needs a door opened to show off that he's smart (despite not knowing a pug from a bulldog), strong and compassionate. And of course, Jackson is clearly having the time of his life as an old-school destroy-the-world villain who serves McDonald's at his exclusive dinner parties.

Despite losing its way in the training montage, ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" is a fun, wild adventure that blows a kiss to the old-timey spy thrillers, while also carving out a niche of its own with bladed feet. Smart, sleek and entertainingly violent.",1424649600,125,4541,4.815147625160463
6948966,5,B00S1ITA2W,I was a bit surprised that Kingsman is very entertaining.  The story is fun with full of actions.  One of the most entertaining action movies in the past year.  Looking foreword to adding this to my film collection.,1424563200,3,215,4.605263157894737
6948967,5,B00S1ITA2W,"The Kingsmen is a long standing international secret service operation. It is fashioned after the Knights of the Round Table. It utilizes gadgets that one might find in a James Bond Film or even MIB. They are over-the-top as they spoof spy films. When an agent is killed, they seek recruits to replace him. As young adults compete for the honor, Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson with a lisp) conspires to save the world from Global Warming. His side kick is a woman (Sofia Boutella) with knives as lower limbs. Together they spoof the super villains in films. Our group ironically must stop Valentine from saving the world so it can die later.

This was a funny film with plenty of action and exploding heads. Diabolically clever satire.

6948969,5,B00S1ITA2W,"Outstanding!  Best action spy movie in a long, long time.",1424563200,3,57,4.7
6948970,3,B00S1ITA2W,"It was enjoyable watching Colin Firth performance in this film.  He brought a little sophistication, along with style.  I've never seen him perform to this magnitude in a film before.  He's usually plays serious characters in his films.  Samuel L. Jackson's role was less desirable for me.  Almost child-like in some of the scenes.  Those ridiculous caps was annoying to say the least.  I felt the plot should have been more interesting.  The movie was almost geared toward the teenage crowd.  Colin firth was classy, while Samuel L. Jackson was just too painful to watch.  It was almost as though, he was there to get a big paycheck, while excusing himself out the door to cash it.

The church scene was purely sinful.  The very end of the movie is totally disgusting.  Do not bring your little ones to see it.  Also,the profanity should have been left out.  It took away from the atmosphere of the film.  One does not need profanity to make a movie more interesting.",1424476800,4,968,4.6726190476190474
6948971,3,B00S1ITA2W,"There's a moment during ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" when a character says something to the effect that it's the villain who makes or breaks a spy movie, and this comment pretty much sums up all that is wrong with this movie. While ""Kingsman"" starts out as a smart, affectionate tribute to 60's era Bond movies, every time chief villain Samuel L. Jackson appears onscreen, it veers off into lowbrow, fratboy comedy ala ""Austin Powers"". I actually like the ""Austin Powers"" movies; they're consistently silly and weirdly funny, but ""Kingsman"" aims for something different, and in switching back and forth between two comedic tones, it feels jarringly discordant, like two different movies spliced into one. The plot has Colin Firth playing a seasoned secret agent who takes under his wing the errant, delinquent, teen-age son (Taron Egerton) of a fallen comrade who saved his life many years earlier. As the boy goes through a comprehensive, competetive training regimen under the watchful eye of stern team leader, Merlin (Mark Strong), an evil billionaire (Jackson) plots to kill most of the earth's populace so that he and a chosen few can rule the world. For fun, Michael Caine pops in as the head of Kingsman, and Mark Hamill scurries briefly through the film as a terrorized scientist whose head explodes. There's a lot of that in ""Kingsman"", heads exploding, that is, but in fact, the over-the-top gore isn't so much stomach turning as laugh inducing.

Which brings me back to Jackson, who is not. The character of villain, Richmond Valentine, seems completely misconstrued by the writers of this film. They seem to have thought that by making him a lisping, queasy cartoon character (rather than a full-blown, interestingly amusing villain) he'd play better to the adolescent humor of 16 year olds in the audience. In other words, it's a largely smart satire dumbed down to low comedy whenever Jackson appears in a scene. Too bad, because Samuel L. Jackson is a great actor who can be genuinely funny, particularly when he's crabbing about being sick of those ""m*th*rf*ck*ng snakes on this m*th*rf*ck*ng plane"" or being gobbled up mid-screed by a giant shark. Here, he's not only not funny, he's not even an interesting villain; he looks more like a lost golfer who wandered in after being hit in the head by too many golf balls. It's like he's not even trying.

The rest of the cast fares better. Colin Firth is a solid, classy lead, and Taron Egerton, looking a little like a younger, chunkier Ryan Philippe, makes for a good underdog that you can't help but root for. Sofia Boutella, as the villain's deadly assistant, is memorable as she leaps and glides through the action scenes on legs of razor sharp stainless steel. And it's always good to see Michael Caine onscreen; as Arthur, head of the spy organization, he's perfectly adequate.

The action sequences are, for the most part, exciting in a breathlessly ridiculous way, and the movie moves at a rapid-fire pace, never slowing down much and certainly never boring the audience. Theres one scene with Colin Firth in a church of hate in Kentucky that has to be seen to be believed. Its both hilarious and disgusting in a Shaun of the Dead sort of way, and also great satire on the sorry state of hate affairs infecting some areas of religion today.

Even considering the abysmal conception and portrayal of the lead villain, and the uneven tone of its writing, Kingsman manages to stay afloat, providing thrills and excitement intertwined with occasional moments of genuine wit.",1424476800,14,3545,4.923076923076923
6948972,5,B00S1ITA2W,"Best movie in a while! I don't care what anyone says.. The British ""eminem wanna be"" is very sexy and I loved every character. Awesome movie! I'm going to buy it when it comes out !!",1424390400,3,182,4.083333333333333
6948973,4,B00S1ITA2W,"Kingsman was like a mix between a James Bond movie and Kick-Ass. It seemed campy at times, in the way that I find the Batman TV series from the 60s to be, but with a lot more blood. I thought the movie was weird and funny and entertaining, but it wouldn't be for everyone. There was definitely a lot of violence, but it was played up or glamorized in a funny way that not everyone will find appealing. However, if you (like me) enjoyed Kick-Ass and you like spy movies, this would probably be a good fit.

The movie is about an ultra-secret spy organization that is recruiting a new member, or Kingsman. Colin Firth plays Harry Hart, a Kingsman spy that nominates a punk kid named Eggsy (Taron Egerton) as one of the recruits competing for the open spy slot. Eggsy and other recruits go head to head in a series of tests, with the winner getting to join the Kingsman organization.  Michael Caine plays Arthur, the head of the Kingsmen, with Mark Strong as Merlin, another Kingsman that is helping test the recruits.  Meanwhile, we have an uber-rich internet mogul named Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) and his employee/assistant/assassin Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) that are up to something evil, although we don't quite know what it is until we get further into the movie.

The movie was goofy in a good way, and I found it to be a really fun and quirky spy movie.  It wasn't your typical spy movie, and I loved how different it was. If you're familiar with Matthew Vaughn, the director and screenwriter (with Jane Goldman) and his previous work (which includes Kick-Ass and X-Men: First Class), you'll find this similar in style. It was comedic and had a comic book feel, but was quirky and different too.",1424390400,3,1702,4.603960396039604

6948975,1,B00S1ITA2W,"It is very well acted, has some pretty good special-effects, and delivers a rather predictable plot. It was enjoyable except for the constant and excessive dropping of the F bomb and, even far more disturbing, the American church scene.
If the church hate group had been a group of homosexuals or Muslims, the cry of injustice would have been public and prolonged. But, when it comes to insulting the Christian faith, it is all fair game because Christians don't resist. Christians lay down and do nothing. Christians let injustice prosper while they go to lunch after church and read Christian bestsellers about how Jesus died to make them comfortable and prosperous.
We Christians are in trouble",1424304000,9,697,5.017241379310345
6948976,4,B00S1ITA2W,"The film is about an ASBO (British English for ""Eminem wannabe"") becoming a spy in Colin Firth's secret agency fighting against an evil tyrant who wants to control people through free phones played by Samuel L. Jackson. Essentially, it's a self-aware spy film that stands at the same ranks as the brilliant JOHNNY ENGLISH.

Inspired by James Bond films, the film relies on the usual spy cliches but adopts them in this crazy universe full of drunks, world leaders, environmentalists, religious nuts, and Oxford elites. This film is bold and it knows it. It also happens to be directed by the same guy who done KICK-ASS too.

What I like about the film? A pub fight between Colin Firth and other ASBOs, the occasional satirical humour, and awesome soundtrack including Dizzee Rascal!'s ""Bonkers."" However, the film does suffer from being a bit underdeveloped and the supposedly ""graphic violence"" felt a bit ""mild"" compared to other films I've seen before (e.g. PURGE, DJANGO UNCHAINED, KICK-ASS). A word of caution though, a particular scene involving a shootout at a church may offend. It's that ""EXTREME!""

Regardless, if you're in the market for a fun, turn-off-your brain spy movie or want to leave your wife to watch FIFTY SHADES OF GREY and your kids to see SPONGEBOB, why not catch KINGSMAN and watch Colin Firth kick, punch, and shoot people with an umbrella.",1424217600,,1367,4.934782608695652
6948977,5,B00S1ITA2W,"What a ride!  This was entertainment at it's best, a kind of James Bond meets Kill Bill meets Harry Potter.  The premise is simple: Eggsy, the main younger character, and a talented yet troubled youth of sorts is invited to try out for the Kingsmen.  The first part of the movie is primarily training, interaction with the inevitable entitled bullies, etc.  Of course, there is a mentor, played by Colin Firth, who is absolutely amazing in this role - stiff upper lip and all, but who does let his emotional side come through occasionally in his interactions with young Eggsy as he learns and grows.

No spy movie is complete without a super villain intent on world domination, and Samuel L Jackson plays this to the hilt, along with being quite squeamish about blood and violence.  His outfits alone are worth watching.

This entire movie feels like an homage to the spy movies of the past, with top notch acting, believable character interactions, and some incredible frolicking fight scenes.",1424217600,309,994,4.846153846153846
