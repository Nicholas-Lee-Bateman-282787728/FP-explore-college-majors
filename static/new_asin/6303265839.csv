This shows all kinds of them in all kinds of settings, you get the sounds and sights of them and their lives, without unnecessary narration.  It is pure unadulterated horses...lovely!",1198972800,,340,4.419354838709677
7842183,5,6303265839,"An in-depth look at the world of Horses for the whole family to enjoy with the sounds of nature, although there is no talking in this video.

The video starts off with ponies grazing in a field with others galloping and playing nearby. My son notices there is no sound on this video and I check the audio on the television and video-cassette recorder with all in working order. I come to realize that Live Action is all we get for thirty minutes.

Horses Close Up and Very Personal is geared for the toddler and preschooler aged child from one to five. It was refreshing to take in the sounds of nature while watching the Horses in their environment. Many of the scenes were shot on windy days while also capturing the seasons with snow on the ground and riding along the beach in other clips.

Midway in this video is the example of Walk, Trot, Ganter and Gallop. A Horse is shown with the words printed on the screen. A painter sets up shop with his wood easel in a field to paint two Horses. The process showed one Black Horse sitting while the other Horse stood for the painter, then across the field the finishing touches on the picture.

This was a surprise to see the Horse posing for the picture and so comfortable staying in the same position for the image to be captured on paper. Then a cat came out of nowhere and jumped on the easel, startling the viewer more than the painter. He acknowledged the cat and off into the field it went. In the background during the painting scenes played music.

Horses Close Up and Very Personal shares the daily lives of Horses and all that they do from pulling the hoe in the fields to racing in a competition. There are clips of children riding on Horses and talking to them. See Horses with all their riding gear on and the socks on their legs. Close up spots show many Horses eating grass and corn, drinking out of a bucket and playing in the grass.",1099612800,7,1899,4.368271954674221

There are all kinds of horses, doing all kinds of things, with fun music and beautiful scenery. This will mezmerize your little one!",998006400,16,282,4.509803921568627
7842185,5,6303265839,"This is the perfect video for a toddler who is intrigued and fascinated by horses.  My 20 month daughter will sit spellbound for 30 minutes watching these beautiful animals in their natural surroundings.  Although you may find it hard to see the educational value, the serenity and peacefulness will encapture your young enthusiast while they watch horses play in the meadow, rest in the pasture, or simply walk along a country road.  There are also brief scenes of rodeos and equestrian shows, also displayed in natural audio.  A very highly recommended video from a mother of a future equestrian rider.",979171200,16,604,5.01
7842186,5,6303265839,"I bought this video for my 2 year old son who is obsessed with horses.  There is not narrator in the video.  It simply shows horses in all settings - fields, rodeos, barns, etc. with the natural sounds as the audio.  It is not educational but a child who really loves horses will find it enjoyable just to watch it.",970876800,33,315,4.216666666666667
