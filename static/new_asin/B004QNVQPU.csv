8438345,5,B004QNVQPU,"I just finished watching this on the History International channel.  It is fascinating and IMO extremely well done!  It describes in easily understandable language, the Large Hadron Collider recently completed (after 25 years) France/Switzerland by CERN.  The program describes the what, how, why of smashing protons together at the speed of light and what some results might be.  These include dark matter, the ""god particle"", new dimensions, etc.  Absolutely fascinating!",1300579200,,473,5.7
