8430879,4,B004IMIGGG,"Aegri Somnia is Latin for ""troubled dreams."" The Latin is used to give us an old world connection to religious concepts. The film is art and theme driven. Reality is in black and white and dreams are in color...mostly. The film centers around Edgar, an introvert who is socially inept. He listens to the voices in his head that will guide him to paradise. People around him die, of which they all had it coming. He sees them dieing in his dreams.

The black and white footage as well as the sound track and background ""stuff"" gave me flashbacks to ""Eraser Head."" The film is not hard to figure out and the end which explains things should not be a surprise. Not a bad stoner film either for those who have ""isolation addiction.""",1414800000,,728,4.473684210526316

8430881,5,B004IMIGGG,"Following my new approach to learn as little about a film ahead of time as possible I have done the same with this one and was surprised by the film and where it was shot (Winnipeg) because the first thought that came to mind was the films of Guy Maddin. Imagine if you will an Eraserhead era Lynch directing Jacob's ladder.

Excellent cinematography and disembodied voices add to the experience

RIYL - The films of David Lynch, Guy Maddin, The Brothers Quay,etc.

The only nitpick is the sound design gets a bit heavy handed at times but not so bad as to detract from the film. Late at night with headphones on this film provides an excellent sound experience.

Worth a buy.",1411776000,,676,4.516393442622951
8430882,5,B004IMIGGG,"If you like twisted & dark films with great visuals this is the movie for you, it feels like a slow decent into madness. I was really impressed with the psychological feel of the horror, it gets inside your guts & leaves you squirming. All in all I would highly recommend this film,especially if you are looking to take a trip off the deep end of reality. The acting , cinematography & sound are first rate !",1279843200,2,408,4.311688311688312
8430883,4,B004IMIGGG,"This is a really cool indie film out of Canada. I had the chance to watch it at a film festival screening not too long ago.

It is a dark film, with many twists and turns before the big payoff. The acting is solid and the cinematography & sound editing work very well together in creating a nicely stylized look and feel.",1278979200,3,321,4.17741935483871
