8179327,4,B000NNN0ZG,"I picked this video up, mainly because there's not much else out there on this subject.

The video consists of two parts.  The first part consists of an introduction and some QiGong exercises.  My only complaint is that they don't describe the exercises enough, and they go through them very quickly.  But if you have the patience to hit rewind and take some notes, I think you'll be pleased.

The send part consists of some iron body techniques.  From the head, to the chest, hands and feet, etc.  They go in levels.  For example, for hands they start with hitting a bag of dried beans (which you can pick up, or improvise), and eventually they move up to hitting a back with more and more buckshot replaced, and doing things like pushups on your fists on concrete.

The science behind it is not really addressed (about recalcification of microfissures in the bones from the strikes causes your bones to become thicker and more durable from the cellular level).  It does make sense and it does work, I can honestly say I can hit much harder surfaces with much more force than before.

If this is the type of martial arts you're into, its really a good video, especially since there's nothing else out there in terms of this.",1175990400,6,1225,4.573394495412844
