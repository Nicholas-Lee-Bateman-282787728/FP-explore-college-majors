8325082,5,B000EWC55C,"i am not an artist or rock painter but my beautiful wife is a very fine one. but i did get a lot out of Ms. Wellford's rock painting video. even i could relate to her instructions and it was very down to earth, not long and drawn out. Ms. Wellford makes one feel very confortable and instills a desire in one that says.....hey ....i can do this.....and this is fun. i recommend this video for folks of all ages!!",1142726400,2,412,4.1625
8325083,5,B000EWC55C,Lin Wellford's video on Painting Animals on Rocks is wonderfully done by a tremendously talented and informative artist who goes to great lengths to help 'want-to-be artists' learn to master painting skills with very simple but fun instructions.  Lin gives easy instructions for finding the perfect rock and how to sketch the animal on the rock.  She also shows how to apply paints to create a life-like animal.  Lin has a very pleasing and encouraging atmosphere in her video and uses every minute to inform the viewer with instruction.,1142640000,2,537,5.01123595505618
