1724765,1,B000068GQY,"Extremely low budget horror flick that could have had potential if it would have been filmed by someone with talent rather than what appears to be a group of young ""filmmakers"" who have no clue as to what they are doing. Basically, ""I Spit on Your Corpse, I Piss on Your Grave"" consists of a short series of disgusting sadistic acts perpetrated on three men by a short haired, tattooed, and really, really nasty butch lesbian who concludes her reign of terror by  revoltingly masturbating in graphic stomach churning detail (I feel the bile rising into my throat just thinking about it) with full penetration with a broom stick before sodomising the sole surviving man with it.

Not only did ""I Spit on Your Corpse.."" lack talented actors, but it was in need of better camera angles, a grittier, creepier atmosphere, and less time focusing on one of the lamest looking cemeteries I've ever seen as well as experimentation with their camera's special effects which took up what seemed like half of the movie.

For those that are looking for a movie similar to ""I Spit on Your Grave"" which was a far superior movie, don't bother with this filth.",1124236800,10,1143,4.705
1724766,3,B000068GQY,"Apparently the film-maker thinks he is pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable to put in a movie, but (most) of the scenes in the film have been done better elsewhere.  A great deal of the film simply consists of shots of a graveyard, shots of Jesus statues, more shots of tombstones, some meaningless dialog, and then some more dumb footage of something or other.  The acting was better than to be expected, and of course the highly unexpected (and highly un-titilating) broom-handle insertion scene is kind of shocking, but on the whole after watching it I kind of wanted to spit on the director and piss on this DVD for wasting my time.",1118707200,20,644,4.640350877192983
1724767,1,B000068GQY,"This sexploitation/revenge ""homemade video"" might have at least a bit of campy appeal if it were really made in 1974.  But no, this is a 2001 job and has no value at all.  It's not scary.  It's not funny.  It's not sexy (though it is explicitly sadistic enough to fall in the category of pornography; I'm surprised Amazon even sells it).  The acting and production values are atrocious.  It's a miserable mess.  I fast forwarded through most of it until finally I gave up on it.  Simply unwatchable.",1112227200,25,499,4.590909090909091
1724768,3,B000068GQY,"Sexually explicit and violent film made last year on a minute budget, very graphic in places. Its about a women who gets sexually abused by about three or four men and then disposes of them in a vairitey of gruesome ways,While getting sexual kicks out of it. If you like shocks this film is for you. Film runs for about 73 mins and has behind the scenes footage and an interview with the director and a wealth of other goodies.",1039219200,11,427,4.35
1724769,4,B000068GQY,"Eric Stanze is building himself quite a reputation with fans of exploitation cinema and this movie only strengthens that.
To give you too many details of the actual film would be to detract from its overall visceral and shock themes, but simply put, it's a fresh take on 'hell hath no fury like a woman scorned'. Very explicit and downright cruel in places, this is a well made sucker punch to the gloss of Hollywood and shows what can be achieved when films are made to be challenging, rather than just mindless feel-good fodder.
Highly recommended, but for fans of extreme cinema only. If you're easily offended, stay away!",1037923200,9,625,4.743119266055046
1724770,1,B000068GQY,"Amazon has this movie as a 1974 release, which is one of the main reasons I bought it. It's not a 74' release, it's a 2001 release by a group of about 10 inexperienced, amateurish, 20-something ""filmakers."" The ""plot"" is on a girl who meets her escaped from jail b/f in the woods and he takes her to some guys house where he has captured 3 different guys who have in some way done this girl wrong.
The b/f says he will kill her too, but she ends up defending herself and killing him instead. The tables turn and instead of releasing these guys she decides to torture and kill them one by one in some inhumane ways (pretty sick stuff, but so badly done it's stupid). After her revenge, the movie's over.
This ""film"" runs 73 minutes long, and about the first 20 are pointless overly run shots of the b/f's brother attacking a girl (which really has nothing at all to do with the story) and some pointless still shots of religious statues in a cemetary (which also have no meaning whatsoever to the movie).
...It took them 8 days to shoot this thing...8! How good of a movie can you have in 8 days? It just looks like people who were bored and needed something to do. And the sex scenes?! Ridiculous! There is 1 real lovemaking scene which is the stupidest thing ive ever seen on film. One sodomizing scene with a broom handle, which i guess could be ""graphic,"" and a scene of the girl masterbating with the broomstick (which is the only good part of the movie). The extras are funny though, not in a good way. ""the making of"" stuff runs waaayyyy too long for such short and cheap of a movie, and the fact that these people are proud of their efforts is even more pathetic. I can't say enough bad things about this dvd! It's boring, it's stupid, it's extremely low budget. This is the kind of movie that shouldn't be sold but be distributed free for promotional uses (ok, maybe they should sell it, but for no more then 10 bucks!) When I got this I thought I was actually buying a REAL movie, obviously I was very sadly disappointed. DON'T BUY THIS, YOU'LL REGRET IT, I GUARANTEE IT!",1035763200,52,2080,4.349614395886889
1724771,4,B000068GQY,"Wow! If you are into 70's style horror and revenge movies, you will like this movie a lot!  Compared to the cool old, scratchy, grainy shockers of the 70's, I Spit On Your Corpse, I Piss On Your Grave has much better acting and visuals.  Also, the violence is MUCH more graphic and disturbing.  But even with these ""updates"" Spit On Your Corpse still has that 70's exploitation edge that you feel in films like the Ilsa series, or the original I Spit On Your Grave.  In spots, the acting falters, and sometimes the visuals are a bit too odd and abstract for my taste, but overall, Spit On Your Corpse is a very cool, well-directed exploitation movie!  WARNING: The gore and sex are VERY extreme!  If you get offended by that kind of stuff, DO NOT watch this movie!",1028851200,6,764,4.421428571428572
1724772,1,B000068GQY,"I expected to see a shocking movie, full of blood, and gore. What I pulled out of my mailbox today was a nothing more than, a dvd of a few friends getting together for three days and making a ""movie"". There was no quality in this thing. The sequences were drawn out, and often using the same shots over and over again. The editing was terrible, monkey cam, no continuity, the audio just sucked, not to mention the acting.
To top it off, they have the directors commentary in the special features. It's with the director and the female star of the movie. They chat as if this movie was a serious project. All this amounts to is a porn with gore, content and quality. I should have given it two stars, because I guess it would get cool points at a party, so everyone could laugh at it.",1025222400,8,783,4.261744966442953
1724783,4,B000068GQY,"Hopefully the previous review by R Inwood may deter dvd studios/distributors from putting fillers in boxsets, because there is a massive quality gap here between the 3 good films and the 2 bad ones. Although the good ones definitely don't figure among the 7 best films to dvd in the last year (thatll be Amer, Alice Creed, Collector, Piranha 3, Elm St, I Spit On Your Grave and Saw 7(watch the standard dvd in the region A 2d pack it really pushes the boundaries), they are essentially good films and the females mostly know how to look sexy in front of the camera, unlike in Scream 4 where our heroines clump about on rooftops and teeter on staircases in their stilettos waiting to be killed. Wes Craven were you making some sort of a statement to your Elm St fans?  BIZARRE LUST seems influenced by Psycho in that it features shower scenes and bw footage, but it is a good color thriller, tho not extreme or exploitation, and the female members of the cast are flattered by the photography. 4 out of 5. CHINA WHITE SERPENTINE seems influenced by the films of Tarantino and Martino and is definitely worth watching. Lots of quite bloody action here, and again the female members of the cast are well served. Be patient when watching this one. 4 out of 5. In I SPIT ON ON YOUR CORPSE Emily Haak, who is also in Bizarre Lust, is not quite so well directed or photographed, but it is still a worthwhile thriller in the same town as the I Spit On Your Grave films tho still not really very similar to those 2 masterpieces. 3.5 out of 4. SADOMASTER and DEADBODY MAN 2 are so disappointing I have discounted them (they are twice as boring as the abysmal Dont Go Near The Park) because the other 3 films are probably sufficient value for the price. Nice box, individual discs well secured. 16/9, region 0.",1308614400,6,1799,4.468085106382978
1724784,1,B000068GQY,"I just watched this 5 film collection and must say that I'm incredulous that the previous 3 reviewers on the site gave it 5 Stars!  About the only saving grace was that all 5 disks only cost about the price of one 'normal' movie - but even at a per flik cost of about $3.50 I'd have to say it was pretty much a waste of money in my opinion.  All of these 'movies' (and I use the term loosely!) are ultra cheap, shot direct to video throw-a-ways.  The box set is headed by the Eric Stanze ""I Spit On Your Naked Corpse..."" - an obvious attempt to cash in on the recent re-make of the 'classic' 70's ""I Spit On Your Grave"" - but, beyond the title, most resemblences to the old & new versions of ISOYG end.  This version has a sorta butch goth chick terrorizing a basement full of guys in really disgusting ways because they sexually 'harrassed' her at some point in the past... you don't want to get on HER bad side!  'Sadomaster' is a weird spanish language effort with a guy riding a cheap Honda motorcycle around shooting people while wearing a black leather 'sado-suit' - there's not even a girl in the movie!  ""China White Serpentine"" - the flick with the most intriguing title is also perhaps the best of the lot - at least it has some half-way attractive girls in it - in a tale of drug addiction gone bad.  ""Separation Anxiety Dead Body Man-2""  mixes gross-out levity w/ horror thrills to the deficit of both genres - at least it tries to be clever!  ""Bizarre Lust of A Sexual Deviant"" had scenes reminiscent of some found in the (much superior) Retro Seduction Cinema ""Duct Tape Killer"" video.  In this one a guy goes around chloroforming girls to have sex with them & then kill them until his ex GF shows up and calls him on the fact that 'this' used to be THEIR sexual modus operandi before they broke up.  Taken en-masse. these movies DO offer some gross-out gore on occasion and the requisite female nudity, but the quality of the girls is questionable - some look, literally, like they grabbed some crack-hoes off the street - any sex within the 'plot' is decidedly soft core and the 'actng' is marginal in most cases.  Maybe I'm gettin' jaded in my old age but my main reaction after viewing this group of micro-budget indie horror atrocities was wishing there was some way to get my money back.",1304467200,18,2307,4.389671361502347
1724785,5,B000068GQY,"These are the movies that the producers set out to make. Quick, dirty, semiprofessional, outrageous. Fun to watch with commentary.",1300665600,7,130,5.55

You will either really like them or hate them. There is no middle ground. Emily Haack is great. She is as pscho as they come.

It starts out playing fine, but if you hit fast forward, when you stop it to play, you have NO sound what so ever. I believe it would be a fairly good movie if you could just hear all of it.

1724790,4,B000068GQY,D-A-M-N people really hated this film. I LOVED IT! One of my favorites to date. Emily Haack is super hot! The haters on here can only wish they were half as attractive as her. I loved the broomstick in the p*ssy scene! Can honestly say that surprised me and I have never seen anything like that in a film...AND I watch a lot of films of this nature. It has no association with I Spit On Your Grave but is just as enjoyable. The girl on the DVD cover is not in the film like most people on here have stated but then again I never judge a book by the cover. That tidbit seems to have really bothered some folks. I'd check it out if you like early John Waters or Russ Meyers stuff.,1257465600,,678,4.029629629629629
1724791,2,B000068GQY,"I grabbed this from Netflix inadvertently thinking it was a mid-70's slasher/exploiter, a genre and era I usually get a lot of amusement from.
Disappointment was the word when I realized I was sent a similarly titled flick made in 2001.

I was little turned away at first by the audio quality. The background music is good and very creepy, but at points it overpowers the dialogue which is often a whisper in comparison to the disturbing and moody music that accompanies it. Anyway with that said, it still kept me for a while. Eric Stanze is creative visually and can set a creepy scene with a disturbed matter-of-fact narration over shots of an abandoned amusement park. This part of the film works very well.

Soon, a turn for the worst is taken as ISOYC details a backwoods sex crime that dramatizes the brutality a cut away to a loud train on an overpass, a technique lifted from early 80's film ""Bad Boys"" or maybe even something older. Further ISOYC degresses into a revenge tale which involves abduction, sexual torture and some moderately pretty girls who went a little too far with their tattoos. I've seen just about everything that can be out on film and surely don't shock that easily, but I do have to say I was a little surprised by the sexual content here as it does include full frontal nudity and object penetration. Not my thing, but I'm sure there's some kind of fetish crowd that would really dig the bondage and torture scenes that are here.

Again, it's not awful filmaking, but not a great script and mediocre actors that  hurt ISOYC. Eric Stanze probably had a microbudget and I respect that he made anything that could hold my attention for more than a few minutes. Maybe his later videos will show improvement.",1214006400,2,1737,4.62987012987013
