7937537,5,B00005BIG2,"""The Ultimate Guide to Sharks"" is an example of the ""real science"" that used to rule The Discovery Channel and similar companies.  It is a well-done layman' guide to the anatomy, physiology, and behavior of sharks, complete with great video and graphics.  It is a must see in my high school Marine Biology class.",1491436800,,312,4.7592592592592595
7937538,5,B00005BIG2,"Two exceptionally good documentaries narrated by Corey Burton and Will Lyman, respectively. Having grown up with these documentaries as part of my life, I can say honestly say that they are second to none among well-narrated, highly accurate and informative Discovery Channel specials. Both were also staples for one or two Shark Weeks during the 1990's as well as airing multiple times throughout the year for several years after their first airings on several channels, so if that does not attest to their authenticity and worthwhile, I'm not sure what will. Anyone interested in sharks, whether they are new to the subject or study it thoroughly, will learn a great deal from these films and the facts they present, and they are perfect for ages young and old alike to enter the world of the shark, and discover for themselves the beauty and power of these animals.",1474934400,,868,4.91156462585034
7937539,5,B00005BIG2,"I had been searching for Discovery's 'Great White' documentary on DVD for some time & was thrilled when I found this one. That documentary, while it dates from around 1994, was one of the most informative & exciting documentaries on the shark that is 'Jaws'. It had interviews from a wide spectrum - shark experts/biologists, such as Ralph Collier, shark victims (including Australian Rodney Fox, who now leads charters to the Neptune Islands of Australia to chronicle the great sharks), and Hollywood special-effects experts who conduct a creative experiment using floating vs. live-action dummies of divers. 'The Ultimate Guide to Sharks', while not as good as the first one, is still an interesting & well-balanced documentary of various species including the Hammerhead, Tiger & Bull Sharks - ones less spectacular than the legendary Great Whites but no less deadly, and far more common. I was lucky to score a copy of this DVD. Grab it before it's gone!",1474243200,,958,5.069620253164557
7937540,3,B00005BIG2,"Good information. Movies are very old, though!!",1466208000,,47,5.857142857142857
7937541,4,B00005BIG2,"This is an educational DVD on sharks; however, the title is misleading in that there is very little info on great white sharks (until the end), but it is very informative.  A must for any shark fan.",1275868800,,198,4.351351351351352
7937542,2,B00005BIG2,"I must say that this documentary is a very good alternative for sleeping pills. I fell asleep watching this documentary. It just shows old footage of great whites; late 1980s to early 1990s footage, very lame. It keeps on showing the same footage over and over again. The first part of the DVD talks about different types of sharks which is educational. It gets boring because it is too long and repetitive. The second part is suppose to be about only great whites but it also talks about other marine animals too that are not sharks. Which can sometimes be as long as 10-15 minutes. What's the point of naming this documentary about great whites for? Once it begins to talk about great whites, they show the same old footage over and over and over. This drags on for about 1hr and 45mins. This is when I fell asleep, watching the second part of the DVD.

Do not, I repeat, do not buy this DVD. Unless you're a hardcore enthusiast about sharks, then it is for you. If you want to see good and new footage of ONLY great whites, I highly recommend you to get ""Discovery Channel: Air Jaws 1 and Air Jaws 2."" This is a very good documentary about great whites leaping out of the water and techniques they use to kill their prey.",1103673600,15,1224,4.392070484581498
7937543,5,B00005BIG2,"Two great Discovery Channel shark features on one DVD.  I especially liked the ""Ultimate Guide"" since it showed several sharks I had never heard of and/or seen on video.  The Greenland Shark was quite a sight, I replayed that portion three times.  If you like shark videos I believe you'll like both the features.",1086998400,10,313,4.7592592592592595
7937544,5,B00005BIG2,"This dvd contains two shark documantarys from the discovery channel. Sharks the Ultimate Guide features cool video footage of all kinds of sharks as well as a lot of information. It features hammerheads,blue sharks,makos,tiger sharks,the greenland shark,sixgill,the whaleshark and my favorite the great white shark. Ultimate guide to sharks is presented in Widescreen and runs about 60 minutes. Great white this show is exclusively about the great white shark and features new footage of great whites never seen until this dvd. Great White runs about 90 minutes. Both of these films are very clean crisp and sharp on dvd. I've never seen shark documantarys this sharp. Discovery Channel if your reading this please put the ten deadliest sharks on dvd and also your other ultimate guides especially the one on snakes.",1025136000,23,816,5.236641221374046
