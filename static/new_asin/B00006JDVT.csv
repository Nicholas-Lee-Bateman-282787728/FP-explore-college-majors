1779455,1,B00006JDVT,"This latest movie from the people who gave the world such movies as ""Gone in 60 Seconds"", ""Con Air"" and Armeggedon. I'm talkig about  Jerry Bruckheimer here. Add to the mix the director of ""Batman Forever"",""Batman & Robin"", well you get the idea. This movie is basically a ""popcorn movie"", in other words check your brain out at the door. ...The movie is very formalic and is typical of a Jerry Bruckheimer movie. I would say more but I do not want to spoil it for you.
Save your hard earned [money] for something better than this movie ! if you must see it, wait until it gets to a second run movie theater. Or better yet wait for it on DVD!",1025568000,2,642,4.262295081967213
1779456,3,B00006JDVT,"I have to admit, judging by the trailer and commercials, I walked into theis movie with pretty high hopes. The pairing of Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock seemed perfect! (Fan of both!) Unfortunatley, from the minute the movie started, I could tell I wasn't going to get what I had been hoping for.  Kind of stuck in between being a serious action flick and a comedy, Bad Company is really a hit or miss thing. I laughed a few times, but the movie never seemed to really hit it's potential. Overall Opinion: Wait for the video release!",1024876800,,533,4.494845360824742
1779457,5,B00006JDVT,"I saw Bad Company on the day it released. It's a perfect action-comedy. The title was perfect, too.
Anthony Hopkins + Chris Rock = Bad Company
I couldn't have hoped for a better movie. It had just the right amount of comedy to keep you laughing and just the right amount of action that will keep your eyes glued to the screen. So, be sure to see this summer hit!",1023494400,,362,4.185714285714286
1779458,4,B00006JDVT,"I went to see this movie on June 3rd at a preview screening...The theater was full, and judging by the reaction of the rest of the audience as the movie progressed, I would have to say that most other viewers agreed with me and enjoyed the movie as well.
Chris Rock plays a dual role as a CIA agent and his twin brother (separated by adoption as infants) who didn't know of each other's existence.  When the agent is killed in the middle of a deal, the CIA pays a visit to his brother, a small-time bookie with a good heart and an aversion to 'suits'. He is talked into playing the role of his brother in order to complete the deal that was in progress.
Anthony Hopkins' talent makes the best of the rather mediocre script given to his character, and his character becomes a character you sympathize with and root for.
There are many laughable moments in this movie, and it moves along at a very good pace ... there are some predictable turns but enough unpredictability to keep you guessing.
I left the movie with the thought ""I'm glad I went; it was well worth seeing"".
Oscar-caliber? No.  Good entertainment? Yes; definitely.  Put this on your summer movie list; you won't be sorry you did.",1023235200,18,1193,4.463302752293578

IF YOU LAUGHT AT THE TRAILER, YOU MIGHT LAUGH A LIL' MORE DURING THE MOVIE, BUT NOT MUCH. THERE ARE A FEW FUNNY MOMENTS, BUT THE DIALOGUE IS MADE UP OF ABOUT 1000 ONE LINERS. ALOT OF GOOD ACTION SCENES WASTED ON ALOT OF LAME EVENTS THAT COULD NEVER TAKE PLACE IN THE TIME FRAME GIVIN'. BOTTOM LINE IS, MOVIES THAT TRY TO SURVIVE OFF OF 1 ONE LINER LEADING UP TO ANOTHER NEED TO RETHINK THEMSELVES. HOPKINS AND ROCK DO WELL WITH WHAT THEY WERE GIVIN'.

1779461,3,B00006JDVT,"This review is for the digital streaming version

Amazon, what garbage for streaming. At one point there's a helicopter - or maybe two, couldn't tell - going through some city - again, couldn't really tell which one. You can't distinguish the helicopter from the buildings because they all look like boxes, black and gray boxes. Good/better/best video quality for streaming didn't matter.

The streaming version is almost a total waste of time.

Review for the movie:
Meh. Chris Rock is mediocre. No one is outstanding. Mr Rock's attempt at humor - seduction scenes - leave one feeling like a toddler walked in the room and shouted a naughty word with your boss over for dinner. It wasn't seductive at all. It was awkward.",1486771200,,722,4.853658536585366

1779469,3,B00006JDVT,"Bad Movie is entertaining enough when your watching it but ultimately forgettable.  So much so that I didn't realise until I started watching this that the opening scenes looked pretty familiar, there's going to be some stairs I thought, sure enough there was.  It's the type of movie that you don't remember that you've seen it because there's no iconic scenes, dialogue or plot twist or anything.

Basically Chris Rock plays two characters, a CIA agent who is shot dead in the line of duty, and his twin brother who never knew he had a brother who has pretty much wasted his life up to this point as a ticket scalper and guy who will play and beat anyone at chess for money in the local park.  Hopkins, Gabriel Macht (who would later become famous as Harvey in Suits) and some others must convince Rock to pretend to be his sibling, and mold him to become his more sophisticated and educated brother, so the bad guys don't realise he's not him.",1481587200,,946,4.514619883040936

1779545,4,B00006JDVT,"Usually I am not much the fan of half witted brainless action films, which this film certainly could be considered one of. But suprisingly this outing represents one of the better ones of this sort that I have seen. I really like Anthony Hopkins because even though hes such an incredibly accomplished actor he seems to take a lot of risky roles. Hes an serious oscar winner yet hes not afraid of just having a good time with a movie even if it could possibly embarrass him or ruin his career. I think people like that about him, or at least I do. This guy is a heavy weight super star, yet hes game when it comes to choosing some rather unusual scripts. I love the guy. Hes just plain perfect in this role even though its obvious that hes a little on the old side to be running around playing a CIA agent. He still does the job so well you almost believe he could pull it off in reality. Putting him along side hysterical comedic actor Chris Rock is really something interesting to see. Somehow the two of them make a good team despite how unlikely it would be for the chemistry to work. And thanks to some very good funny moments, above average action sequences, intrigue, and an over all very entertaining and stylish kind of production, this movie works better than I really expected it to. Of course you have to suspend reality and just relax and enjoy the show, becaus if you try to view this film as ever being believable youll be dissapointed. Other than that obvious consideration this movie delivered some half witted brainless fun superbly. I really enjoyed it.",1367712000,,1572,4.480836236933798

Anthony Hopkins has his humorous, caring side and his manner that reminds everyone exactly why he was chosen to play Hannibal Lecter.

Anthony Hopkins plays a CIA agent and has to train this amateur boy who's barely getting by on the street to become one of his guys. The last thirty minutes had me staring at the screen, rocking back and forth, and just when you think it's over, it just piles on!

1779557,4,B00006JDVT,"The Internet Movie Database lists 18 film titles as ""Bad Company.""  In several instances that title translates to bad companions.  With the 2002 film, which enjoyed a lavish production budget, the title translates to ""CIA is a Bad Company,"" as actors Anthony Hopkins, Gabriel Macht, Brooke Smith, John Slattery and several others are portrayed as CIA agents.  The Joel Schumacher ""Bad Company"" is viewable for several reasons:  the lavish production presents some of the newer Mission Impossible scene settings including the beauties of Prague, while including Mission Impossible 2 actor Hopkins.  ""Bad Company"" 2002 presents two actors who appeared in ""Silence of the Lambs,"" Smith and Hopkins; one actor who appeared in the CIA thriller ""The Recruit,"" Gabriel Macht; John Slattery, now of TV's Mad Men; Shea Whigham, now appearing in HBO's premier series, ""Boardwalk Empire.""

In the 2002 ""Bad Company"" a victim in ""Silence of the Lambs"" (Smith) is a very friendly CIA colleague of the former and future Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins), at which, one might fall over laughing at this casting.  In the 2002 ""Bad Company"" Hopkins chews gum while shooting at villains.  Shakespearean educated actors as Wild Bills.  Only in America.  ""Bad Company"" 2002 DVD sells for shipping costs, the disk lists for $.01 plus $2.88 USA First Class mailing.  Viewers will be challenged to top that entertainment value.

1779558,4,B00006JDVT,The pairing of the great Anthony Hopkins and the very funny Chris Rock was intresting yet worked. The movie delivers a wonderful plot with comedic twists and lots of action and drama. Quite entertaining from beginning to end.,1319068800,,225,4.947368421052632
1779559,2,B00006JDVT,"If you're a fan of lazily constructed action flicks then this is your man.  Sadly, talent like Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock are wasted on a script that lathers on clich&eacute;s and plot holes (nonsensical is an understatement) with rusty dialog, little laughs (why is Chris Rock in this movie if he's not allowed to be funny) and regurgitated familiarity.  Sure, there are some thrills, but they are far too expected and they only get you once, then you're over it.  Hopkins does the best he can here, and his presence certainly gives the film a much needed facelift, but at the end of the day this is a forgettable ride.  It's not offensively `bad', it's just irritatingly `bland'.  There isn't much use for this when equally brainless espionage fare like `I Spy' (same year, mind you) at least understands the need for humor to elevate a film that is, without that humor, devastatingly dry.

1779572,3,B00006JDVT,"Admittedly, I had never heard of Chris Rock  until looking him up a moment ago. I had the impression he was playing the stereotyped civilian type dragged into action but felt that he did so in a style somewhat similar to what the public knew him for. Apparently, that is roughly correct. At any rate, while generically suitable to the role of unwilling sidekick to a veteran CIA agent,  I found it grating in its particulars. Perhaps, that was only a personal response.  Anthony Hopkins, wildly miscast, or rather, cast against type,  as always, turns in a highly professional performance. For the rest it is into and out of trouble, lots of shooting, yelliing, car chases, derring do and general violence which are entertaining if it's your night for that.

This is a well acted, suspensful  production with many twists and turns which usually do not work in a film with Chris Rock as the co-star. I was greatly impressed with Chris Rock's ability to deliver a top-notch performance throughout the entire movie. Of course there were a few places where he added comedy pieces, but they were well placed and effective. One can be supremely confident Sir Anthony Hopkins has never given a less than steller performance in any movie he has made, Bad Company is no exception. Antony Hopkins portreys a top agent and handler of the look-alike brother of another agent (Chris Rock). The movie is filled with suspense, intregue and action.

1779575,5,B00006JDVT,"I don't usually watch a film too concerned about who is in it, who produced and directed it.  If any of these are familiar, so much the better (e.g., Tony Scott).  First of all, the pairing of Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock was simply a surprise.  The soundtrack is excellent (and who cares if any of it was used before?).  It begins as what looks like a fairly serious film (several killings in Prague) and then BAM! it is a comedy.  If they spent any time showing how they figured out that Michael Turner (Kevin Pope's alias) had a twin brother (the husling Jake Hayes) it would have spoiled the film completely.

Much of the hilarity and charm of this film comes from that BAM--and it comes through.  Does anyone expect Anthony Hopkins to be anything but dry as an FBI Agent?  I mean, his boss, after all, seems to be 30 years younger than him.  Why is he taking orders?  Why does he have a crew of geeky 30-somethings to handle, as well as groom Jake Hayes for a critical job?

It isn't perfect.  I'll bet Chris Rock made up 40% of his lines on the spot (like, what does C.I.A. stand for?).  Anyone expecting ""Three Days of the Condor"" gets what is expected, disappointment.  Taken for what it is (such as, why is one of the head criminals an ex-K.G.B. Colonel named ""Vas""  which is at best an OLD nickname for an out-of-date Russian first name.....it moves, it is funny, and is definitely worth two viewings, so at least, well, $9.99.

1779576,2,B00006JDVT,"Bad Company was a quite a disappointment, considering the presence of Anthony Hopkins.

The movie sheds light on a CIA operation that is about to go awry when one of its operatives is killed in Prague.  Following the discovery, however, of a long lost twin to take the deceased's place, it just might work...

The plot has elements of both comedy and adventure, though it fails to take off.  The acting is pretty weak (with the exception of Anthony Hopkins who does a great job of trying to cover up the mess that is Bad Company), while the humor and the plot are just about average.

On the positive side, the movie's European location was quite enjoyable and Anthony Hopkins is Anthony Hopkins.

On the negative side, Chris Rock really overdoes it with all the hoopla. ENOUGH already!

Moreover, weak/uninteresting story/script/dialogues, with the cherry on the cake being the nationalities of the ""terrorists"" (who surprisingly say some pretty accurate things!) which are not openly mentioned, but the leader ""Dragan"" has a Serbian name and his No2 speaks Greek (with a very strong American accent mind you).  No further comment needed here...

Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...

In a nutshell, it's an ok movie if you've got nothing else to do, and that's about it; it lacks that extra something to put it over the top.  No masterpiece here.

If Anthony Hopkins is what you had in mind, check out the AMAZING movies: Remains of the Day, Instinct, and of course, the Silence of the Lambs, among others.",1139011200,,1572,4.777777777777778
1779577,2,B00006JDVT,"When I pop a DVD in it's not to see how much action, or which film can I compare it too, it's because I enjoy movies.  I like to laugh, and I love a tear jerker!  Now I'm a boyish girl so I love me some speed, some violence, and yes some action.

Okay I've been sick so I haven't been doing anything with the exceptions of coughing, blowing my nose, and popping pills that have kept me a little dazed.  So while lying on the couch I picked up Bad Company and decided to watch, or let it watch me.  WHATEVER....

Chris Rock plays a dual role.  One as Jake Hayes and the other is Kevin Pope who is pretending to be Michael Turner.  Believe it or not Jake, and Kevin were twins separated at birth and it's not until Jake is needed that he learns that he was a twin.

Jake has all the potential in the world, yet he lacks whatever it is needed to buckle down and do things right.  He's a hustler baby, a DJ, a chess player, and a ticket scalper.  But it still doesn't seem to be enough.  He loves his girl Julie (Kerry Washington) and is sick to death when she tells him she's moving.  I mean seriously what girl wants to live with her sister and family while her man lives in some basement apartment hustling here and there?

Okay so as Jake is all lost in love, he goes to sell some tickets and discovers that he had a twin, and now the CIA needs him to workout this major deal for them or else!  So do it for your country?  NOPE!  Do it for your brother? NOPE!  Do it for some dollar-dollar bills?  OF COURSE!

Okay so Oakes (Anthony Hopkins) who had the pleasure of working with Kevin/Michael has the task of transforming Jake into both in the matter of 9 SHORT DAYS!  Dress, speak, customs, and mingle on a higher level with people who know Kevin/Michael personally.  Oh did I mention that the great government was using him as bait?  Someone is desperately trying to prevent Kevin/Michael from making his detrimental meeting in 9 days.  Risking lives, limbs, and whatever else it doesn't take that much for Jakey to realize that he is at risk of loosing more than a couple of dollars.  Now the question is will he stick around to see this mission through and why?

This is the part of the film where the main character has grown and is now doing things because he wants a chance to prove people wrong, and he's gained the respect of the person/people who doubted him.  BOO WHO...

Okay so everyone is talking about the action and I'm like where?  This movie is a major explosion, and not in the way that you think.  It's predictable from the very first line.  Chris Rock in my opinion is not that great of a comedian.  He's loud, and obnoxious and he annoys you trying to get the jokes out.  Anthony Hopkins, had to be broke, starving, and gang banging to do this film.  I'd almost rather watch him eat people then see him all out of breath here.  AND PLEASE what was the purpose of Garcelle Beauvais?  Michael Ealy?  (Though Bro is FINE!) I did like Irma P. Hall's character.

I'm glad for once that this is a rental cause it has got to get out of here!",1119312000,,3056,4.22318339100346
1779578,3,B00006JDVT,"After hearing a lot of negative comments on this movie I really expected the worst. Perhaps that is why it is a lot better then expected.

First of all there is the director and producer: Jerry Bruckheimer, you either lover or hate his productions. He is probably the world's most famous producer and many of his productions arevery recognisable, this is one of these typical Bruckheimer productions. But where most of these typically well known Bruckheimer action-movies are are directed by Michael Bay this one was done by Joel Schumacher. Schumacher nowadays finally is slowly getting recognision for his work, however in the days this movie was made he still sufferend from the negative opinion on his Batman attempts. It is widely agreed that the first two Batmans were batter than the latter two. That can indeed be blamed on Schumacher, but it was not his own choice to make his versions  of Batman less dark and Gothic than the first two, it was the choice of the people he worked for(WB&Producers). Bad Company movie was not good enough to really improve his status, but it did the job and was good enough to keep him more than accepted in the industry.

The actors: Anthony Hopkins plays a role that seems a sort of crossing between the characters he played in 'The mask of Zorro' and 'Mission Impossible 2' but with a bit more fysical action. He does not have to use a lot of his qualities as an actor, and it can hardly be denied that some of his qualities are wasted in this movies, but we see some chemistry with Chris Rock(but that is also result of his quality as an actor), and even although this movie may not demand all of Hopkins' qualities, we don't have to be sorry for him. He has made clear in interviews that he can find himself at home in a movie like this, and that he has a very down to earth idea about the acting profession.

Chris Rock acts pretty decently. He is a respectable komedian but at best an average actor. I must admit some moments are almost ashaming, but others are pretty good. He seems a bit out of place in the whole picture, that tries to be realistic an serious, while Chris Rock can only really shine in a good comedy setting. It almost seems like they got him into the project thinking he could become a sort of second Will Smith or even Eddie Murphy, although with his very own character. Unfortunately his acting is not always up to par, at least it goes not go very well with the vision of the director and this is one of the main reasons why the movie does not really know where it wants to go, and goes a little bit in every direction, but nowhere in particular.

This is the biggest problem of this movie, it seems like the product of conflicting visions. It has no definition or direction where it wants to go. It tries to do a little (buddy)comedy, it tries to be a sort of stylish action movie (some of the shots and locations are among the best in action movies in the last few years. These two directions create a bit of conflict in many movies, but here this tension is really of bad influence, it can't become humoristic enough nor stylish enough to really work. So it can't stick out enough in the masses of action movies.

The second problem is that there are a lot of Clichees in this movie. The way the characters are introduced. It really seems the story relies on formulas to quickly recall instantly recognisable concepts of characters. This way the characters remain a bit opf cardboard characters or puppets. It is just impossible to create truely interesting character development if the character is made by stereotypes and formulas.

The editing is not always very good. The action sequences are often very well done... wel paced, nice use of cinematography etc. But the other parts don't alway have the right pace timing and style.

Even although this movie has some big problems it is still a decent action movie that is worth watching. The action sequenses are good with clear cinematography, perhaps a bit slow for some, but imho that made it only better. It is a Bruckheimer film, so that is what you should expect. If you want to see a perfect exaample of an action thriller that is a reference still today try"" the day of the jackal(1973)"" ,or if you really want something modern and are not into Bruckheimer yet ""Enemy of the state"" is the better choise. But if you want to see a movie that is generally entertaining, knows what Bruckheimer stands for and don't mind that the good (action) moments that are there in the movie are intervened by a lot of average and some bad ones it is surely worth the try. You will be surprised by some (hidden) qualities it offers. My advice is really to watch (rent) it before you buy it. It is definately worth watching once but I can't guarantee you like it.",1110153600,2,4780,4.505190311418685
1779579,2,B00006JDVT,"Silly and predictable thriller without any trace of originality.

But they are twin brothers! (what a great idea!)and Mr. Turner (the agent) is killed in action and Mr. Pope must replace him for the sucess of the mission.

With that premise, the movie goes on only based upon the abominable jokes and gags of Rock and some unimpressive action scenes and car chases. A waste of time for a competent actor as Anthony Hopkins. And for you too.",1108598400,,620,4.636363636363637

I'm paraphrasing obviously.)  However, Hopkins and Rock make a surprisingly effective team with more chemistry than other on-screen duos.  Rock's Jake emerges as a wanna-do-well with a sincere love for his girlfriend, who emerges as a female with a mind of her own (despite an interfering family), a tenderness for his churchoging mama, and a sense of right and wrong.

1779595,1,B00006JDVT,"Bad Company is still slightly better than Gone in Sixty Seconds, but the point is, producer Jerry Bruckheimer is churning out crap at an alarmingly fast rate. And with Kangaroo Jack out, he's not slowing down this trend whatsoever (2001's Black Hawk Down proved to be a fluke on his part). The man truly doesn't know a good script when he sees one, and the odd part is, he typically hires decent directors and to helm these pictures, which typically follow a specific formula. You got your heroes on one side, the despicable villains on the other, a countdown clock, and lots of stuff getting shot up real good.
Bruckheimer also knows how to draw in A-list actors. Anthony Hopkins is in this film. Anthony Hopkins! And he's paired with Chris Rock, who plays twins here, though the more refined, cultured one is killed off early on, and the plot has to do with the more street-wise half having to pose as his CIA sibling to make a transaction involving a nuclear bomb go smoothly. Hopkins plays his trainer, so you can see the filmmakers were opting for a mismatched buddy picture.
But the point is, there's very little about this movie worth mentioning. The premise is silly, but good action movies can be made from a lack of strong plot, right? Last year there was the wonderfully entertaining The Transporter. But no, Bad Company fails from the start because it brings nothing new to the proceedings. Everything is bland and predictable, all the way down to the perfunctory shootouts. The only bright spot is an energetic car chase, but even that is marred by Rock's awful one-liners and Hopkins' unconvincing bid as an action hero.
Hopkins and Rock display little to no chemistry. I cannot remember laughing once during the entire film, nor do I recall anything in the way of thrills, excitement, or fun. Jerry Bruckheimer won't be remembered as cinema's worst producer (Dino De Laurentiis, Yoram Globus and Menahem Golan have done much worse), but when people speak his name years from now, it probably won't be out of fondness.",1064620800,3,2032,4.759206798866855

Chris Rock practically carried the movie with his sense of humor and good acting chops.  Anthony Hopkins does his thing and is pretty good, but not stellar.  He definitely took a different direction with this movie, and I can't say I can fault him.  There's nothing worse than to be type-cast.
Bad Company wasn't a terrible movie and it wasn't great.  I was able to watch the whole thing, and sometimes that's a feat in itself.  It's not a movie to pick apart and dissect every scene.

1779598,2,B00006JDVT,"It is difficult to imagine any movie with Anthony Hopkins as going so wrong in so many ways as he does in BAD COMPANY.  Hopkins has made a career of playing the suave gentleman, whether he is the erudite if not the monomanical Hannibal Lechter or the self-effacing butler from REMAINS OF THE DAY.  In BAD COMPANY, however his sense of urbane self is totally lost as he is a CIA operative who recruits a jive Chris Rock to take the place of Rock's twin brother who was killed in a mission to recover a suitcase nuclear bomb.  Director Joel Shumacher clearly attempted to present a cop buddy movie in whose divergent personalities and speech rhythms the audience would surely connect.  In this case, their unlike traits were less believable than those of Toody and Muldoon from CAR 54.
The plot, given the events of 9/11, ought to have resonated more than it did to a viewing public that brings terrorist-laden baggage into the theater. Not for a second did I connect the movie plot to detonate a nuclear bomb in Manhattan with the real life worries that appear daily on the evening news.  The film's few laughs came only from Rock's penchant for throwing off some hip hop lines at Hopkins' expense.  Far too much of the story was marked by gunshots, car chases, and slimy eastern Eurotrash terrorist wannabes whose only function seemed to be to snarl directly into the camera.  Had these bald-headed baddies had moustaches, they surely would have twirled them.  And had the writers any original ideas about injecting any oomph into a moribund story, they surely would have done that too.  Since neither event occured, the result is a brainless thriller that fails to thrill.  For those viewers who prefer more in a thriller that features a countdown clock in a suitcase bomb, they would do well to turn to GOLDFINGER.

No, this is not the tightest script written, and yes, the story has been done before, but in a field as repetitious as Hollywood products variations on a theme are bound to occur.  Joel Schumacher has a style which includes a love affair with light and dark, with angles of view that distort and sharpen our perception, and he always seems to generate the feeling from his actors that htey are having one terific time working with him.  It is refreshing to see Anthony Hopkins take on a bit of a fluff role, taking the script seriously that he is playing a burned out CIA agent, and spar with Chris Rock (who is always just Chris Rock...not a bad thing.....).  As usual Schumacher introduces fresh faces in minor roles and gathers some of the more interesting new lights around in a full scale production.  Special effects are good, the musical score fits the mood, and the pacing is excellent when the running gets real.  This is a good evening at home movie, even if your only desire is to see another facet of the eloquent Anthony Hopkins.",1038182400,2,1189,4.506976744186047
1779602,3,B00006JDVT,"Not to be confused with the classic western directed by Robert Benton, Joel Schumaker's and Jerry Bruickheimer's film is a fish out of water story. Chris Rock works for the CIA and is trying to (spoiler alert)purchase a nuclear bomb from a disgruntled former Russian General. His partner in this operation is Anthony Hopkins. A rival for the bomb kills Rock's character. They need to carry on and it just so happens --surprise!--he has a twin brother that Hopkins never knew about. Chris Rock (again)plays Jake who is enlisted by Hopkins to impersonate his deceased twin. Unless they are able to pull this off, the bomb will fall into the wrong hands (a Yugoslav terrorist)bend on using it in America.
All right. There's got to be easier ways to cross the bad guys. Bad Company is an entertaining romp that has its fair share of explosions, gunfire, one-liners and, although it is fun, it isn't as fun as it should be nor as funny. Still, there is a certain chemistry between Hopkins and Rock. Hopkins plays his CIA operative pretty straight. He's a perfect foil for Rock. A pity the material isn't stronger and the plot not overly familiar (well, the portion without the twin).
The transfer is very good, the sound terrific and this is fun for a rental but I wouldn't purchase it. Wait until it comes down in price or is on HBO and catch it there.",1038096000,2,1348,4.620833333333334
1779603,2,B00006JDVT,"I'm sorry to say this, but I cannot tell you a lie.  ""Bad Company"" turned out a very disappointing movie, not even reaching the height of being called a messy job, simply because they didn't do anything worthy of our money.  Even the two stars cannot save the project.
Not that there is no potential.  Casting Anthony Hopkins in the role of CIA agent would be a good change of pace for him, considering his repeated appearance as ""Hannibal"" Lector.  And he has to handle the most hopeless case, namely, turning fast-talking Chris Rock into a first-rate agent within 9 days, to save the world from destruction.  And they add to them some actions and comical scenes, to make a good entertaining film.  The premise looks promising, and it should be so.
But the result is awful.  Don't get me wrong here, for the film is awful because it doesn't do anything better than showing things we action flick fans have seen before countless times in a better form.  The film goes on and on the way we think it would go, and never gives us anything new.  When Peter Stormere appears on the screen, we remember he was also in the same director's thrill-less thriller ""8mm,"" and he acts the same way as he did in there.  So, when reluctant Chris Rock spends some time working on the mission with Anthony Hopkins, sooner or later they come to like each other, amid the attack of terrorists.
Those basic parts are OK provided there's something more -- something exciting, amusing, or whatever.  ""Bad Company"" gives none except the shots of beautiful town of Prague.  Even Chris Rock looks quite restrained, or I should say, he doesn't know whether he should go comical or serious.  He gives some jokes -- classic music and Run DMC things -- but they sound too feeble to me, lacking the brio those sidekicks should have.  But the greatest disappointment might be Hopkins himself, whose acting looks (to me) half-hearted, looking as if reading the lines he was given simply because he had to say so.
I thought his previous ""Tigerland"" had shown some proof that Joel Schumacher is not what he is usually thought to be, far better than some people might think, but this new film is trying to change my mind.  Don't make me, please.",1036627200,7,2210,4.6020408163265305

You can tell from the previews that this flick is going to be great, but don't be cynical, the previews are not the only good parts, from 10 seconds in to the movie right until the end, this film will hold your attention and entertain you for sure! SEE THIS MOVIE, it's definately worth it!",1027555200,2,525,4.36734693877551
1779608,3,B00006JDVT,"OK, this movie sort of let me down.  But, since I love a good action-comedy movie, this film kept my attention.
STORYLINE-Not bad.  It wasn't a very complicated plot at all, but was interesting enough to make you care.
ACTING-Well, the actors should've switched rolls.  Chris Rock was way over his head with the main dramatic role, which he ALMOST handles alright.  Meanwhile, Anthony Hopkins has nothing to do as the straight-man.
OVERALL-3/5  Like I said, could've been better, but could've been MUCH worse.  It's no ""Showtime"" or ""Bourne Identity,"" but it does what an action-comedy should do.  No more, no less.",1026172800,,615,4.970588235294118

Also this movie should be R rated for violence, sex, and language. Parents who would let their 13 year old watch this trash, should not be parents!",1516320000,,265,4.541666666666667

7970035,3,B00006JDVT,"Pleasant. Predictable plot. But Chris Rock is good, and makes the film enjoyable. But the rest? Talk about wooden acting. It's a forest. Even Anthony Hopkins is stiff and expressionless. And his attempt at being matey at the end of the film is completely unconvincing.",1498176000,,268,4.977777777777778
