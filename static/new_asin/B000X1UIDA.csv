2996431,4,B000X1UIDA,This tv series are amazingly funny. I recommend this japanese drama as one of the top ones. The subtitles are great accept for the last episode the camera changes (the picture is still good) and the subs are a bit slack....which is a little piss off cause the rest of the episodes are so good.,1324771200,,293,4.345454545454546
2996432,5,B000X1UIDA,"LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

that show is absolutly one of the funniest i know!
the cast is fantastic and the story is great, and with the special dvd you get deeper into the charakters.
why don't we have such funny shows in europe????

and of course - tha last ep got worse subs but you still get everything.

you really have to see it!!!!",1321488000,,341,4.467741935483871
2996433,4,B000X1UIDA,"I had already watched Hana Kimi online before I bought this series. The story is laid out very well, and is good for laughs. A lot of the actors are famous; the actor playing Nanba is also on Mei Chan No Shitsuji, the actor playing Sano is on Hana Yori Dango, and Maki is on some other good series as well. I only gave this series a four because indeed the last episode was subbed poorly, if you have watched the series before, then you'll have an idea of what they are saying in the last episode. Overall however, this is a good series and I completely recommend it to anyone who loves stories that have hilarious and sweet moments. :)",1321056000,,636,4.264462809917355
2996434,5,B000X1UIDA,I have recently watched this series on dramacrazy.net. It was wonderful. Those of you who enjoyed the manga will love this. I know I did! I had to buy it when I saw it so I could watch it whenever I wanted.,1302480000,,206,3.9285714285714284
2996435,3,B000X1UIDA,"I absolutely loved the manga and the storytelling in it.  The story is shortened in this DVD series, and the subtitles are quite erratic in some episodes.  This is the first j-drama where I didn't like the lead female actress!  She didn't play a tomboy very well and her acting was not very impressive.  The two male lead characters made the show enjoyable for me, but overall the story wasn't told as well from the original.  Kind of a letdown overall.",1285718400,,453,4.54320987654321
2996436,4,B000X1UIDA,"This is a lovely show. The Taiwanese adaptation is horrible; this Japanese one is way better! The plot is heart-warming; the story and acting plays out like a manga come to life; its humorous and cute and contains drama that is not too over the top. I highly recommend it also for those of us who are interested in the Japanese culture and who are trying to learn the language. (Those who are familiar with the manga it was based off of will find more than a few things that are different.) The subbing was well recieved except for episode 12 (the final episode) which does seem like it was translated by a Chinese student who is barely learning english. I say Chinese because when one character refers to another by name, the subtitles spell out a chinese name such as Lu Rui Xi instead of Mizuki (the name of the main character). The only thing that saddens me is that it does not include the special episode (episode 13 if you will). Overall, its worth buying!",1283126400,,963,4.446327683615819
2996437,4,B000X1UIDA,"I'm really enjoying this product. It is one of my favorite dramas. Thank you for selling it to me. The one thing that I didn't like was that the last episode had very bad subtitles but overall I still like it.
Thank you!!!!",1269388800,,223,4.209302325581396
2996438,5,B000X1UIDA,"After reading the manga, I HAD to see if an anime was made. To my surprise they actually made a LIVE ACTION SHOW!! (with a LOT of eye candy!!:nosebleed:) I do prefer the Japanese version, I dunno why but the actors really brought out something deep inside me and portrayed the story well. It was like you became part of the story just by gluing your eyes to the screen. Trust me I've spent a sleepless night watching this show, ehehehe, even when I had to work early the next day! That's how awesome it is. The only thing I wish they shown was more, erm, cuddle times with Sano and Mikuzi. That was my only peeve. Other then that, if you loved the manga series this live action will keep you staring at the screen till the very end. It does so for me every time I watch it. They picked the perfect trio for Mizuki, Sano and Nakatsu! :Bows down before Hisaya Nakajo-sempai: WE LOVE YOU!!!!",1222992000,8,888,4.291666666666667
2996439,3,B000X1UIDA,"ok so i bought a version of this dvd set and i thought it was subbed beautifully.  the english was fantastic and the subbed dialogue co-related with the humor perfectly... except for the very last episode.  I was not able to understand it because it seemed like it was translated directly from chinese or taiwanese.  It was really bad, i'm talking extremely broken english. This made me really upset because I sat for hours enjoying 11 episode of this show and I didn't get to watch the two hour finale.  And the guy that I bought it from deleted his account and disappeared.  So if you're buying this item, please be careful. the set that I bought was a two-set with a nicely-presented cardboard cover that opens up with advertisement of other dramas on the side.  If the that you are buying is similar, make sure you ask a lot of questions before you buy it.",1194566400,25,860,4.480769230769231
2996440,5,B000X1UIDA,"This series is amazing. I absolutely love it with a capital L. Personally, I prefer it to the Taiwan version - although Wu Zun Chun is Fine! - It goes in deeper with the personal stories of individual characters to the point that it feels like you're apart of their school life, which is better then focusing solely on the main characters. Doing so runs the risk of it going dull. In the Taiwan version the feelings that Xiu Yi has for Rui Xi kinda just make you laugh ... other times to squirm uncomfortably. While in this version, Nakatsu - the equivalent of Xiu Yi - his feelings for Ashya Mizuki (Rui Xi) make you feel really sorry for him, occasionally drawing a tear. However, he is still incredibly funny, although in a completely different -and better- way then the other guy. The ending of this series couldn't be better. It was so bitter sweet and ... you just can't put it into words. It had me crying my eyes out and then laughing with joy in the last minute of the show. There are certain scenes within this series that I'll hold as fond memories - heck, I took I picture of one scene in the finale episode with my phone and I can still laugh myself to tears when I see it.-
I can safely say that I will always love this series and will be watching it again and again for years to come ... as soon as I buy the DVD that is ;D
Defiantly worth every penny. You won't regret the buy.",1194480000,6,1393,4.201492537313433
2996441,5,B000X1UIDA,"So far, I haven't had any problems with the discs yet. They play perfectly as if brand new :) The container they came in was hard, so the discs weren't damaged in any way when they got to me.",1376352000,,191,3.923076923076923
2996442,5,B000X1UIDA,I loved this series and felt that it was done really well and really captured all the fun and humor of the manga. The characters were also all cast well.,1371686400,,153,4.133333333333334
2996443,5,B000X1UIDA,"The Japanese Drama : Hanazakari No Kimitachi E w/ English Subtitle is a funny, cute, show. Girl going to an all guys school...funny.",1370822400,,132,4.782608695652174
2996444,4,B000X1UIDA,"I personally love it
The only flaw is in the 2 hour special (last episode on disk 2) the subs are...really off, which does make it an inconvenience but you can still get the gist of whats going on. So other then that i would still highly recommend this.",1364256000,,253,4.183673469387755
2996445,3,B000X1UIDA,"Mostly everything is perfect.
but on the LAST AND MOST IMPORTANT EPISODE, the translation is ABSOLUTELY THE WORST I'VE EVER SEEN. It made me sad to know that the dumb translator messed up SO BAD on the LAST EPISODE.",1362009600,,215,4.538461538461538
2996446,5,B000X1UIDA,i think everyone should watch this show. was funny and enjoyable to see and very touching at certian points of it.,1358985600,,114,4.476190476190476
2996447,3,B000X1UIDA,The item shiped fast! but the subs on the movie were just realy bad. But for me it did not bother me so much sence i read the manga and watched other versions of the drama. But over all i liked it and the ending was better then the other ones.,1355702400,,243,3.784313725490196
2996448,4,B000X1UIDA,"Hanazakari no kimitachi e started life as a manga drawn by hisaya nakajo, then went to drama CDs and then a Chinese drama (2006), then a Japanese drama (this one! 2007), and another Japanese drama (2011) and finally a Korean Drama (2012 called To a Beautiful You)!  Yeah, it's had several incarnations, But this one, In my opinion, is the best.  It is closer to the manga than the Chinese one ever got, and the actress playing Mizuki (while obviously a girl, even when dressed as a guy) is a great actress.
The only complaint I have about this particular DVD is in the subtitles.  for the majority of the series they are fine, accurate, and timing is good.  However in the last episode (the most important one!) the subtitles are translated from the Chinese subtitles and they forgot to change the names back to the Japanese names.  They are all in english except the names are from the Chinese version.  If one hasn't seen the Chinese drama first, and isn't able to understand Japanese, they might get lost in the names!  Fortunately, the timing is still good so when a person is speaking about or to another, you can usually figure out.  Suddenly Ashiya Mizuki is being called Lu Rui Xi... aahhhh.
Other than that, it's a great DVD version of a series that should totally be made into an American show.  just saying.  i'm looking at you, Logo.",1353110400,,1345,4.566666666666666
2996449,4,B000X1UIDA,"My sister lent me this to watch and I didn't expect it to be too good given her past suggestions, but I was wonderfully surprised!

The plot is based around a young girl who disguises herself as a boy to attend an all-boys school so as she can complete a certain task that she has set her mind on. She becomes more involved with the school than she could ever have imagined, but finds herself in complicated situations trying to achieve her goal and keep her gender secret. It's packed with drama, laughs, romance and even pure idiocy at times.

Unfortunately I did feel that it was let down by the subtitles. For the first DVD and half of the second, the subtitles had a few gramatical errors but were still understandable; they were mostly just a bit iffy with tenses and plurals etc. But across the last few episodes the subtitles seriously deteriorated, becoming misguiding and sometimes even impossible to understand at times. I have enough knowledge of Japanese language to understand what the subtitles failed to translate, but also enough to know that the subtitles weren't even accurate at times during the last episodes.

I don't think the poor subtitles should put anyone off watching this Drama completely, but please keep it in mind so you don't end up disappointed. Aside from the subtitles it's a very heart-warming and touching drama. I now intend to give it back to my sister and buy it for myself! ^_^",1333670400,,1419,4.690763052208835

8226563,5,B000X1UIDA,"The last episode has poor English Subs, but i watched it b4 so i remembered what had happened.. haha. besides the only thing that matters is the ending.. >.<",1378166400,,157,4.448275862068965
8226564,4,B000X1UIDA,Loved the drama. I just have one complaint about the subtitles in the last episode. It was like a mixture of english and chinese. Either than that I loved it.,1376697600,,158,4.3
