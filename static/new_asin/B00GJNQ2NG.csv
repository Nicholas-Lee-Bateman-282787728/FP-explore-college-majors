6079984,5,B00GJNQ2NG,"This is really a very good series.  How could it not be with this cast.  Unfortunately, I don't think it was picked up and continued.  Even watching the first year, though, is worth it.  One can only hope for a future extension.",1392076800,,228,4.357142857142857
6079985,3,B00GJNQ2NG,"The major problem with Crossing Lines is that it tries way too hard. This starts from the show's very premise: the idea that we need an international group to track down offenders that cross borders, especially in the complicated European situation. It's obvious that such a body is necessary: in the same way that the United States has an FBI, the world needs a group that can handle cross-jurisdictional matters. That's why Interpol exists. However, Crossing Lines can't be about Interpol, so it must invent a new group operating out of the International Criminal Court. That could be a great hook for a show, assuming that the group chases down The Hague's usual offenders: war criminals. I'd love to see a show about investigating crimes against humanity. That's not Crossing Lines, sadly.

Instead, in this case we get a rather pedestrian set of police procedurals, with the usual serial killers, kidnappers, and bad guys for the team to catch. We've pretty much seen all these stories before. The only real wrinkle is that they're ""international,"" so instead of just kidnapping a person or two in a city, the kidnapper in Crossing Lines kidnaps more than one person in more than one European city. This season even trots out an episode involving an underground fight club; if there's one story we've seen done to death it's the idea of a cop having to infiltrate a fighting ring. Ho hum.

Tired plots needn't sink a good ship, though, assuming the stories are used to illuminate interesting characters. Here the show goes overboard as well, including everything from drug addiction to a dead wife and child as ""motivation"" for the coterie of characters. The idea isn't terrible, but the fact that we get all of this backstory very quickly means it's not very artfully revealed to us. More importantly, it's all compressed into ten episodes, which makes it feel more desperate than natural.

One of the few good reasons to feature an international European team of officers is to take advantage of the disparate locations that Europe offers, from the streets of Paris to the former wall in Berlin. Crossing Lines does an okay job highlighting its locations. We get a lot of pretty establishing shots of some of the more famous locales, while most of the scenes take place in generically European locations. This keeps the show visually interesting in a lot of instances in ways that more focused shows can't compete with.

Crossing Lines isn't terrible. If you just want a police procedural to watch, and you like either the actors or the idea of international flavor, then there's something to appreciate about the show. If you're a fan of this kind of show you've probably seen it before, but that can be comforting. It's also possible that audiences will not be as turned off as I am by the somewhat rushed and desperate feel of the show's first ten episodes.

I can't really knock Lionsgate's Crossing Lines: Season One (Blu-ray), either. The ten episodes are spread across three discs, giving these 1.78:1/1080p AVC-encoded transfers plenty of room. The show itself is a bit on the drab side, so don't expect stunning visuals. Despite this, detail is generally strong, with close-ups on the actors exhibiting lots of variation in skin texture and color. Saturation is dialed down a bit, so the show doesn't really jump out, but black levels are consistent and deep. Though the transfers don't stand out, there's also little to complain about, either. The DTS-HD 5.1 tracks are similarly fine. Dialogue is always clean and clear. There's a decent amount of directionality, especially during more action-oriented scenes. The show's effects are well-balanced, and there's some surround use in a few key scenes.

The set's lone extra is a 10-minute featurette that's pretty typical, including info on cast and crew. The highlight is some of the attempts to justify the show's policing based on current European standards, though most of the interviews are a bit less surprising. Given there are only ten episodes total, a bit more in the way of extras would have been nice, especially if there could have been a featurette that explained more about European police procedure and the current state of cross-jurisdictional cases or one that dealt with the history of The Hague in greater depth. That's probably too much to ask a young show, but those who get into the series will likely want to know more.

6079986,4,B00GJNQ2NG,"I watched one episode of this show when it was on last summer but just couldn't get into it.  However, when I saw that it had just been released on DVD, I figured ""why not?""  (Sadly, TV - both broadcast and cable - are the pits these days).  I was so pleasantly surprised and pleased that I watched all three DVD's over two evenings!  As one reviewer commented, the dialogue can be a bit trite/hackneyed but, one must remember, that this show is primarily broadcast in Europe where the nuances of English and American slang are not well-known.  The stories have some nice twists, the locales are fantastic, the acting fair to good.  I'm a big fan of UK/European TV and films and can only describe the flavor of it, from my point of view, as a blend of the UK series MI-5 and the film ""Ronin"" (Robert DeNiro/Jean Reno).  Interestingly, the casting/characters are very ethnocentric - that is, an Irishman, a German, a white American, two French, and one Italian.  No diversity here!  May be that's one reason it wasn't as big a hit here in the US (?).  Hoping that NBC airs Season 2 this coming summer!",1390780800,16,1100,4.482412060301508
6079987,5,B00GJNQ2NG,"William Fichtner plays Carl Hickman, a former New York cop and a brilliant detective. Marc Lavoine is Louis Daniels, the head of this new team of international cops based in Europe. Donald Sutherland plays Michel Dorn, an inspector in the International Criminal Court and confidant of Daniels. And the rest of the team consists of German policeman Sebastian Berger (Tom Wlaschiha), Italian Europol sergeant Gabriella Pession (Eva Vittoria), Irish detective Tommy McConnel (Richard Flood), and French detective Anne-Marie San (Moon Dailly). The characters slowly develop throughout the season. Thankfully, Hickman gets most of the focus as his character is the most interesting and complex. But the others have their dark sides and secrets as well. The cast and their chemistry is what first drew me in to this series. There are a lot of crime dramas on TV, but this quickly became my favorite.  For those, like me, who enjoy science fiction, theres even a tech guy (Berger) with gadgets that are futuristic and unique.

Crossing Lines was a surprising and fantastic new series that shouldnt be missed. Based in Europe, this diverse team gets to travel across borders to hunt dangerous criminals. The stories are gritty and intense. And with only 10 episodes in the first season, its over too quickly. Unfortunately, it aired this summer and no one I talked to had ever heard of it. The marketing was terrible here in the US. Thankfully, it was more popular overseas and is picked up for another season. Though there is no news when/if NBC will air it here in the States.

6079988,3,B00GJNQ2NG,"One star for being entertaining, one for exotic locales, one for a (generally) good cast.
But not much more. I suspect viewers that rated this 5 stars don't have much ear for dialogues; otherwise they would have noticed the abundant commonplaces, sketchy cartooney characters and tired up lines these episodes usually have.  For instance: ""don't die on me!"" (said by the Irish cop to his dying colleague) or ""you are a good guy but a bad liar"" (said by the dying lady to the Italian cop). When character X is introduced to a group, the members of the group, showing knowledge about X, complete each other's sentences about X, as in cue (it doesn't get much more staged and artificial than that).
The characters, from the burn up junkie cop to the undefeatable super villains that haunt the past of the American and the French police officers, are stereotypes of the simplest nature, while never ending plot conflicts echo too much a soap opera, where you have to watch one more episode, and one more, and one more and closure never really happens.... The first season ends with nothing but loose threads.
Watchable this series is, but neither to be taken seriously nor to imagine that a real police force could remotely be like this one. And it could benefit with slightly better writers and less trying to impress viewers with cheap melodramatic devices.",1389398400,6,1355,4.7905982905982905

UPDATE: 1-31-2013 Received BR last Thurs (1-23-2013)  Cool thing the next day I was at Best Buy and they were also selling this BR for a Surprising $17.99 Sale price it made me happy to know it was being sold at some Chain stores
watched 2 of the BR Discs over the weekend I stand by my Review (Only watched the show during the summer)
what i forgot to mention This is one of those tv shows that is heavily story driven. You have to watch the episodes in order or you will be confused and totally lost.
I really liked the Blonde actress who played the English Cop (It sucks she only did two episodes) But, her character was written in to get all the other characters closer as far as a team
Elsa Mollien who plays Louis wife is really good.
The music score is very good fits the show and everything going on
This is a good example how very HQ tv can be much better then feature films
BR Details: 1080p HD presented in Widescreen
The HD Transfer is Flawless and looks crisp and clean great Transfer!!!!
English  DTS 5.1 Audio (The Audio is awesome I've been a Huge fan of DTS Audio for a long time
IMO It's the best Audio form
**Spanish Subtitles**
**English SDH**
A Behind the Lines Featurette (which is cool just wish it was much longer)
Feature Run time 460 Minutes
Buy this BR and support this show
Last time i checked the show was picked up for a 2nd Season (Which is great news) Plus the two part season finale leaves so many unanswered questions
then answers. It has one of the best Cliff hanger ending I've seen in a long time

6079993,4,B00GJNQ2NG,"I found this show on Netflix when I ran out of other things to watch and was pleasantly surprised.  The actors are mostly people you've never seen before and because of this I can tolerate Donald Sutherland's horrible attempt at a Polish (it's supposed to be Polish) accent. The locations are places we don't see all the time. And the cultural differences and accents are also a nice change from the gritty American cop dramas that take place in NY, LA, or DC. They have a strange tendency to kill of key members of the show in shocking ways which makes me wonder if they treat them badly or don't pay them enough? Either way, it's different!",1464912000,,642,4.487179487179487
6079994,4,B00GJNQ2NG,"Cross-border Eurozone crime worth viewing, but Its a bit of a slowed down short version of 24 that starred this series Donald Sutherlands son, Kiefer. Remember Donald from M.A.S.H.? The concept and story deserves 4.7 stars; compared to the 5.7 stars for 24. But but... the end?

The ICC team members all have a backstory. Bonus behind-the-lines interviews suggest the concept was based on the beginnings of Americas FBI. Europe needs cross-border cops for the International Criminal Court. Tom Wlaschiha plays Sebastian, a tech genius, German, gambler. Dorn (Sutherland) functions in the court based at The Hague. Hickman (William Fichtner) has a useless left hand resultant from NYPD work, now an excop, hes also drug reliant. Maj Daniel (Marc Lavoine) of Paris leads ICC but suffers, like his wife (Elsa Mollien Jane Eyre) from their sons death by a car bomb. DS Anne-Marie (Moon Dailly) is French and a criminal analyst working in human trafficking. St Eva is Italian and expert in covert/undercover work. McConnel hails from Northern Ireland, a weapons and tactical expert.

6080007,5,B00GJNQ2NG,"After spending a fair amount of my career as a reporter chasing stories in exotic places around the world I have to admit that I'm a very big fan of international thrillers.
That made ""Crossing Lines"" a must-see for me. The series revolves around a team of European cops from different countries working together to solve cross-border crimes. They are joined by a former NYPD detective with some serious emotional and physical issues played, I thought, very nicely by William Fichtner. The cases they investigate are interesting and so are the characters because, just as in real life, each member of the team comes with his or her own baggage. The team leader is, for example, looking down the barrel of a divorce; another team member has a serious gambling problem... it makes them seem more real than most cop shows.
There's bound to be some criticism of the show based on the fact that no such team currently exists and that, if it did, it would not be under the command and control of the International Court of Justice in The Hague. I wasn't troubled by that fact: This is fiction, after all, and not a documentary. I liked the fact that this first season focused its attention on some pretty serious social issues, including human trafficking, and presented them in such a way that reflects the difficulty law enforcement has in trying to curb crimes against defenseless people committed by determined criminals armed with the knowledge that by simply crossing a border they can often escape prosecution.
I thought the characters were well drawn and that the crimes the team investigates had a ring of authenticity about them. The series was well acted and the direction was solid. The shifting locales also added a bit of spice to the episodes.
All in all, a very enjoyable series.",1434153600,6,1789,4.792880258899676

Yes some of the story lines might have been a little on the campy side, but still the chemistry of the actors more than made up for that.  Donald Sutherland is terrific, as is William Fitchner.

6080012,2,B00GJNQ2NG,"***Warning: CONTAINS SPOILERS***

I really wanted to like this show. A crime procedural with an international cast - what's not to love about that?

But the silliness and inaccuracies started to bug me right from the start. For example: the medication (opiate) patches. They just don't work like that. The whole reason for using them is to prevent pain spikes. The patches are applied at roughly the same time every 48 to 72 hours to provide a stable medication level. Pills are used for ""breakthrough"" - times when the pain level spikes.  Hickman gives up the patches, switching to oral opiates that ""aren't as fun."" The problem is they got it BACKWARDS. Oral meds are more likely to produce the high... The patches contain a much smaller dose and don't produce the euphoria common to oral (and injectable) preparations.

Come on, writers. Are ten minutes of research too much to expect these days?

There's too much more. One of the detectives tells us she has an eidetic memory.  The show goes even further by pretending there is a objective basis for her claim. (Her mom, an MD, did an MRI, blah, blah, blah).  Sure, we all have friends (or relatives) who claim to have a photographic memory. Science has yet to identify ONE PERSON with such a gift. It's a myth, like mind reading.

Then there was the problem of identifying the victims. The killer obliterated their faces and rendered their teeth useless for identification with dental records. Fingerprints weren't possible either.

Hey - wasn't there a little something called DNA found useful to identify remains, even of folks dead for decades ?

Now, I realize that DNA requires a database to match it to - but so do fingerprints, dental records and the like. Oops.

The serial killer spree is attributed to a domineering mother: how original. (How cliche!). Fitchener says ""She was dead the moment she showed fear"", so the detective flashes back to that very conversation and magically keeps herself alive by standing up to the killer. (If only human behavior were that simple).

The second case is about art theft and a woman killing with polonium.  Why? Because she hates men. (No, I'm 100% serious). Could they be any more stereotypical? This sounds like a sappy soap opera plot from the 70's!

The cleaning woman discovered a suspicious vial in her employer's apartment. Detectives visit her in the hospital where she is dying a slow painful death from radiation. There is not a hair on her head, yet medical professionals thought the mysterious deaths were due to some strange virus? (Did they get their diplomas from a cereal box?)

The cleaning woman's just happens to take her last breath while one of our heroes is holding her hand. Too predictable to be believed.

I'm not just being a killjoy. My problem is that viewers soak up crap like this like sponges! Human behavior isn't that simple. People don't salivate at the sound of a bell like Pavlov's dogs. We just don't know why people do what they do.

If you don't mind being spoon fed, if you prefer the script to be predictable, sophomoric, and loaded with fiction masquerading as fact, this show is for you. However, if you prefer a more complicated characters, and a more cerebral  story line: avoid Crossing Lines.",1422230400,2,3244,4.793536804308797

6080020,5,B00GJNQ2NG,This was an excellent show.  I can't believe it got cancelled.  The concept of it was intriguing as was each episode.  The characters had depth and were very relatable..flawed like most of us are.  I hope Season 2 becomes available soon.,1414368000,,237,4.7073170731707314
6080021,5,B00GJNQ2NG,Very interesting concept on the good and the bad. Crossing lines should have been labeled crossing borders. Problems are slightly different when you deal with them across borders.,1413849600,,179,5.428571428571429
6080022,1,B00GJNQ2NG,"Saw all the 5 star reviews so I decided to check it out. I mean, it's rated up there with 'The Wire', 'Deadwood', 'Breaking Bad', 'House of Cards' and 'The Americans', all shows I loved, and it has Donald Sutherland, so it must be decent, right? Wrong! I watched 6 episodes, labored thru them actually, and I hated it. Nothing original, though it races along as though it made sense I found it almost insulting my intelligence. If you liked the aforementioned shows, which I felt were brilliant, don't waste your time with this. If you do decide to check it out, check out the 'Fight Club' episode, which I felt was absolutely pitiful. If you like that, you'll probably enjoy the show.",1413763200,3,685,4.5772357723577235

6080035,4,B00GJNQ2NG,My husband and I both really like this series.  It keeps you guessing and the plot keeps twisting.  I would recommend Crossing Lines to those who like crime dramas.  We are anxiously awaiting the next season to be available on DVD.,1400457600,3,231,4.585365853658536
6080036,3,B00GJNQ2NG,"The focus of this series is a fictional elite unit of the International Criminal Court (ICC) whose mandate is tracking cross-border, serial crime in Europe. The premise is one that justifies a variety of European locations and a multi-national cast that is tailor-made for audiences in Europe (where it was first released). Top billing goes to two American actors: Donald Sutherland and William Fichtner. Fans of Sutherland will be disappointed to find that he does little more in this series than lend his name to the enterprise. (Sutherland seems to interact with the team largely by telephone, which suggests he was promised his role would not entail a lot of travel.) Fichtner does the heavy lifting as a former New York cop who left the NYPD after being wounded on the job, an injury that left him with a morphine habit and, who, when we first see him, has been reduced to working as a garbage collector at a carnival in the Netherlands. Despite Fichtner's character's travails, Sutherland, playing a top inspector for the ICC, taps him for the team. The rest of the team is rounded out by five actors representing France, Italy, Germany, and Northern Ireland, four of whom (two men and two women) are your standard, pretty twentysomethings: the women wear tight jeans and tops revealing cleavage; the men sport unbuttoned Henley shirts and trendy 5 o'clock shadows. The team resembles models off on a photo shoot rather than law enforcement professionals. They are not helped by the dialog, which can be pretty clunky. As is often the case in shows of this type, the impressive use of computer and tracking technology largely ignores practical realities. These shortcomings could have been mitigated by compelling stories, but the emphasis here is on appearance rather than on substance. Pretty locations; pretty people; pretty artificial.",1399075200,4,1845,5.052459016393443
6080037,5,B00GJNQ2NG,I just watched the first  season and I was so upset that I cant  see the second the season. what a cliff hanger. Please have a second season.,1395532800,,141,4.0
6080038,4,B00GJNQ2NG,"Crossing Lines is a good show with some interesting plot lines. The pilot is average but future episodes are better. With the trend of having bad ""heroes,"" it is good to see a show where the characters try to work together and do the right thing. The cast and characters are all likeable. The storytelling is direct and tight. Many of the episodes have a moral theme with both the cast and co-stars dealing with issues. Efforts are made to flesh out characters so there is not the sense of nameless characters without a personality. If you like shows with moral dilemmas, characters that really care about making a difference, and interesting locales, try it out.",1394755200,8,663,4.724137931034483
6080039,5,B00GJNQ2NG,"This show is really great!  I only recognized a few of the actors but the fact that they play roles of great type ""cops"" are from all over the world makes for an exciting cast.  I purchased this because I can't get it on any tv stations here.",1394496000,,242,4.020833333333333

6080041,5,B00GJNQ2NG,"I had read some information about the series previously and I decided to buy it.
After watching all the episodes you find a charming and different touch of making something very interesting for the viewers in ""Crossing Lines"".
And the idea of an international force in charge of finding and catching criminals regardless of frontiers sounds not only necessary but possible to be made in the future.
Besides you receive a very good acting of all the characters.",1393891200,5,460,4.910256410256411
6080042,5,B00GJNQ2NG,"I found this show by accident while surfing Amazon's movie section. It had two rave reviews. For $20, I thought it was worth trying. We really enjoyed this series! It's a different type of police procedural, which is a refreshing change from cookie cutter American shows that want to either mimic CSI or Law and Order. The locales are fun and stories interesting. Everything ties together, somehow, and yet, they keep viewers guessing on some plot points.

We watched a few of the episodes a few times. Each time, I caught something new.

I don't have live TV anymore, but I do buy everything on DVD. I look forward to Season 2 on DVD next year! I can almost guarantee I'll preorder here.",1393545600,33,688,4.585365853658536

8623821,5,B00GJNQ2NG,"The show is entertaining and different, full of wonderful, international actors. They take them all away and destroy the show's atmosphere by the last two episodes on season 2 and with season 3.
 Season 1 and 2 were brilliant, you grow to love the characters and stories. Then it get's replaced with generic tv vomitous that is season 3. Save yourself the frustration and don't start the series.",1483315200,,395,4.8088235294117645

8623827,5,B00GJNQ2NG,"This series had great potential, which was never fully explored.  It was wonderful to see such a diverse cast moving around through Europe, investigating crimes that crossed international borders.  The first season concentrated a lot on the development of Carl Hickman's character and his personal journey, including how he - as the only American - interacted with his European counterparts.  It's too bad that the second season went downhill afterwards, with most of the main cast disappearing from the third season.",1469318400,4,517,5.3580246913580245
