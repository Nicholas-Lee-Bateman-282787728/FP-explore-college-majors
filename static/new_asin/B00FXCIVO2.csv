8619200,5,B00FXCIVO2,"Actually, this is a basic belly dance video with basic moves for the beginner.  I love it!  It is great for a morning wake up.  Sure you can learn more advanced moves and shimmies with advanced videos but this is basic and I believe the Heather delivers a basic presentation for the beginner.  I think some people here were over estimating their expectations and should not have purchased a basic belly dance work out.",1450396800,,418,4.608108108108108
8619201,5,B00FXCIVO2,"Denise Druce workouts are terrible.  She gets on the bandwagon whenever a new fad shows.  The major problem is that she doesn't hire professionals to teach them.  The bellydance video is a joke.  If you want to learn real bellydance get dvds by Jillina, Bellytwins, Neon, Sarah Skinner, Ansuya.  Don't waist your money",1436227200,,318,4.9245283018867925
8619202,1,B00FXCIVO2,"This DVD consists of two half-hour dance-inspired workouts.  I'll evaluate each of them separately.

BELLYDANCE

I hate to be so blunt, but this is probably the worst bellydance workout I've ever encountered.  There were none of the shimmies, hip drops, or snake arms that I've come to love in bellydance DVDs.  The set was plain white with something that looked like a garage door or big windows in back (only you couldn't see anything through it).  It was just sterile and dull.  It had none of the vibrant colors or props I'd expect to see in a bellydance DVD.  Even the ground was plain white or light gray.

The music was OK but nothing remarkable.  It had a pretty slow beat.  Camera work was better than with other videos in this series (like Cardio Blast, which had awful camera work).

The performers were odd.  They wore shoes, which is something I have not seen before.  One was a man (!) and he spent the first few minutes out of sync with the other two, although he did eventually catch up.  (The way he was dressed left a little patch of white at his collar with all the rest black, making him look oddly like a Catholic priest.)

The instructor kept talking about how many calories ""we"" were burning.  I did not even break a sweat.  I did not feel out of breath at any time.

The instruction was not good.  There wasn't enough of an explanation of what you were supposed to do.  I could kind of follow along because I have done a lot of bellydance workouts in the past.  But I can see where a beginner would totally get lost.  It also didn't seem planned out at all.  The instructor would have you walk to one side for 8 paces while doing a move, but she'd have to stop advancing because she'd find herself running into the wall, otherwise.  And, unfortunately, it was boring.  You just kept doing the same moves over and over and over.  There was a bit of stretching at around 18 minutes and I thought it was either going to be over or we'd move on to a new phase but nope, more of the same.  There was no cool-down but it wasn't necessary to have one since you didn't get warm in the first place!

In the end, if you are looking for some half hour fitness DVDs inspired by bellydance, I would recommend anything with Veena and Neena Bidasha or Rania's set of four weight loss workouts (I have them on VHS but they've been re-released on DVD).  You could also try Dolphina's DVDs (though I've only tried one of those so I can't speak to overall quality).  All of these are available on Amazon.  The price is higher but they're much better workout options!

SALSA

This program is better exercise than the bellydance segment, because you're moving more.  However, I still didn't break a sweat.  I'm not familiar with salsa dancing although I feel like this program is at too basic of a level to get anything out of it.  I got more (and better) instruction from Alison of The Firm in one segment of the Cardio Dance Fusion DVD.  This was filmed in the same room as the bellydance segment.  It just wasn't a lively setting at all.

Music and camera work were again about as expected.  One weird thing about the room is that there was either a mirror or an off-screen light source that made it sometimes look like there was a fourth demonstrator, just out of view.  But I think this was actually a shadow or reflection of one of the participants.  It was a little distracting when you'd see an extra hand show up, of to the left.

Costumes were poorly chosen.  I think of bright colors when I think of salsa dancing.  The instructor had a bit of color to her skin and she wore a brightly-colored shirt, but the two women behind her were pale and dressed in all black and had kind of a Gothy vibe to them.

Again, the instruction was not good.  I really would have liked a description of moves that were supposed to be done and maybe one or two slow demonstrations of the move but the instructor hopped right into everything.  And then you're repeating something and starting to think you've got it and suddenly, everyone has moved on to a different move.  Like the bellydance DVD, this was also boring.  You learned maybe five things and then just did them over and over again.  Sometimes it would look like you were going to do all the moves ""from the top,"" but then the instructor would stop halfway and you'd do the same one or two things again.  And again.  Also, not every move was done evenly on both sides, which is irritating.

This also didn't feel planned or choreographed at all (nor did the bellydance segment).  It's like the instructor was told at the last minute she'd be filming an exercise video that day.

Timing was a problem, as well.  This was 23 minutes long, including a lengthy cool-down.  A couple of minutes after starting, a graphic pops up that says 15 minutes to go.  You also get these for 10 and 5 minutes.  But then 5 minutes pass after the last graphic (you're at 17 minutes and some change at this point) and you keep going for 6 more minutes).  This just isn't a long enough program, at the given intensity, to count as exercise for most people (even beginners could do better).  You could burn the same number of calories vacuuming around your house for 20 minutes.

In the end, I really can't recommend this DVD.  It's not challenging even at the most basic level, it's rather repetitive (and thus boring), and it seems disorganized and thrown together at the last minute.",1424649600,,5421,4.427558257345491
