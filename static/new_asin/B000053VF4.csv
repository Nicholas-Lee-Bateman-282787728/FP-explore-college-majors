1391840,5,B000053VF4,"I Love Disney Channel Original Movies! They are good movies for the whole family! This one is about Cody. His parents found him on a boat and adopted him. Now he's 13 and going through some pretty big changes. Not only is he getting taller, voice getting deeper, and getting hormones, his hands are becoming sticky, getting electricaally charged, and his skin keeps growing scales! The class nerd tells him he's turning into a mer-man! He also tries to help him. When Cody's real mom appears (she's a mermaid), Cody must choose between a life on land, or the sea. Teaches kids about family and friends. Rent it today!",982108800,,617,4.669724770642202
1391841,5,B000053VF4,"I don't usually like made for t.v. movies. But Disney makes some pretty good ones. This one is about a couple who find a baby boy in a basket on a boat. They take him in and raise him. Now, Cody has become a teenager. Life is pretty tough with bullys, swimming practice, and his crush. But now he's hit with another  problem. He's a merman! He seeks help from the class nerd whos father plans to catch a mermaid. Once Cody meets his birth Mom, he has to decide weather he wants to stay on land, or live in the sea. I recommend that you go to your local video store and rent this because it's not worth the price, but is worth the time!",981763200,,635,4.0396825396825395

1391931,5,B000053VF4,I absolutely love the Disney Made for TV movies. I remember watching this movie so many times when I was younger. I am so glad to finally found this on Amazon since it is not available anywhere on DVD. The story is about a boy who is adopted but later finds out things are happening to him right after he turns 13. He ends up finding out he is a Merman and finds his mom who is a Mermaid too. Great story and I just love it.,1455148800,,424,3.8850574712643677

1391943,5,B000053VF4,"This was a movie on the Disney channel a few years ago and it was fun. It is certainly family viewing. I wish it was DVD or iTunes but we had to make do with this.
It is a unique story and while cheesy, it's still good fun.",1363132800,,223,3.6666666666666665
1391944,5,B000053VF4,I purchased this movie for my (then 8 year old) son who has a thing for mermaids/merpeople.  So naturally he likes this movie.  It has a good storyline and a good ending. Am glad I purchased this movie.,1182902400,,202,4.2894736842105265

1391946,5,B000053VF4,"My little sister and I saw this Disney Channel movie in a hotel room, and she loved it so much I bought it for her. It's too bad that it costs so much now. This movie about a boy discovering who he really is (a merman) is wonderful for children, and also for adults, as long as they don't expect something more than a made for tv movie aimed at kids. It has its fair share of cheese, and the special effects aren't great, but it's good for a few laughs and a fun 90 minute distraction. I'd have to give it five stars, based mainly on sentimental value. But don't take my word on it. It's worth renting and seeing for yourself.",1089849600,8,626,4.097560975609756
1391947,3,B000053VF4,"This movie is about a teenager named Cody Griffin (Chez Starbuck). He was left on a boat by his mermaid mom when he was a baby, and his adoptive parents found him. Now, when he turns 13, he starts getting some strange symptoms: always thirsty, sticky hands and feet, electric current coming from him, and scales on his hands when he gets wet. His friend Jess (Justin Jon Ross) tells him that he's a merman, but Cody doesn't believe it. He goes to the state swimming championship with his swim team (but sneaks out to do so) and breaks a state record, as well as giving his teammate Sean a full view of his secret. Meanwhile, he's also having trouble with his girlfriend Sam (Courtnee Draper) and getting more and more freaked out by this merman thing.
This movie is not bad, but not good either. I got really sick of it pretty fast. It is definitely not worth [the money]! Who would pay that much for any movie? This movie has a great performance by Dave Coulier as the dad of Cody, and he evens manages to be funny. He was awesome. The other actors were great too. This movie deals with every adolescent issue I could thing of except drugs and alcohol, etc. You should see this for fun and a look at real teenage life (which doesn't include merpeople).",1030665600,6,1253,4.405172413793103
1391948,5,B000053VF4,"Disney is always a winner when selecting movies for the family, and this movie was such a winner at our house.  My 4 & 5 year old girls loved the mermaid theme, or shall I say merman!  And, as usual, it provides some wonderful messages along with the great entertainment.  The boy quickly has to deal with the ever changing problems of his body, as he turns into the merman - as if being a teenager isn't complicated enough!!!  In addition, he is faced with his birth mother, who wants to spend some time with him... and at the same time he has the guilt of betraying his own adopted parents.  We won't even discuss the other teenage issues of girls, bullies, and more.  Disney takes a very complicated issue and add the ultimate complexity of the mermaid theme, and presents a highly entertaining and educational movie.  Excellent!",1026345600,,832,4.581081081081081
1391949,5,B000053VF4,"I sat and watched the movie with my grandaughter, and she loved it, as a matter of fact so did I. She is only three, but as soon as it was over, she asked to play it again. Unfortunately it wasn't a video. As we talked about the movie she immediatly said it was her favorite. Needless to say, I ordered the movie. Thanks for such quality films",990144000,,343,4.0588235294117645

7930364,4,B000053VF4,I grew up in the 90's and these Disney Channel Original movies are super nostalgic for me. Now that I have kids of my own it has been fun to find some of these and watch them again with my kids. I was just a bit older than the main character when this one came out. This is a cute and fun coming of age story. These 90's DCOM's were well done.,1514851200,,343,3.7777777777777777
