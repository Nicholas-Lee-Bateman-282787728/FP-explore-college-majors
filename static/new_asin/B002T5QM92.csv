3984004,4,B002T5QM92,"Featuring multiple animation styles, this adaptation of the video game released by Electronic Arts is a surprisingly good and horrific tale.  Dante's Inferno tells the story of Dante, a crusader who returns home only to find his beloved Beatrice murdered, and her soul in the posession of Lucifer himself.  As Dante plunges through the Nine Circles of Hell, it is slowly uncovered just how and why all this happened.  Featuring some wonderful voice acting, a great score, an buckets of blood and gore; Dante's Inferno: An Animated Epic is a pure blast.  Though its ending is pretty underwhelming compared to the rest of the film as a whole, and the final animation style comes off as too cartoony compared to the styles that came earlier, this is still a worthwhile endeavor regardless, even if you have little desire to play the video game.  All in all, if mature-themed animation is your thing, Dante's Inferno should be right up your alley.",1265760000,10,943,4.86875
3984005,5,B002T5QM92,"Dante could never have imagined that his literary work would have spawned such an outstanding production.  EA and Film Roman, have combined the talents of six directors and six studios into a film that interprets Inferno six different ways.

We follow Dante Alighieri as he travels through Limbo, Lust, Gluttony, Anger, Heresy, Violence, Fraud, and treachery.  The journey is fraught with danger and tribulation.  For true love, for Beatrice, Dante is willing to continue on!  That is the universal truth behind  the Divine Comedy, Inferno. Even 700 years ago, human beings were tempted and tried by the same forces that cause us to stumble. Lust is by no means dead!  Nor is violence, fraud or treachery.

Lending their voice talents to the film are Mark Hamill, Victoria Tenant, Graham Tenant and Vanessa Branch.  As viewers of this film know, this is not the end of Inferno, but rather the beginning.  EA has a stellar video game, and DC Comics published a 6 issue mini series.

Graphically speaking, this presentation is remarkable.  It is as beautiful as it is frightening.  For some reason, heaven and hell seem to bring out the best in artists and writers.  Many adjectives come to mind when I think og this film, and inspired is one of them.

3984006,1,B002T5QM92,"I'm not the biggest fan of The Divine Comedy, the poem Dante's Inferno is based off of. The idea is pretty cool; an epic poem with Lucifer as the ""protagonist,"" but the prose is just too purple for me. So I was interested in this game and anime when I heard about them.

  Let's get the very little positive out of the way so I can concentrate all that's wrong with it; the animation is a feast to look at. The movie is split into 6 parts each with a different style of animation so it's a little jarring, but still very nice to look at. Dante kicks ass, the monsters and demons are creepy as all get out, and hell looks very hellish.

  I can't be anywhere near as positive for the story though. There are so many jumps of logic, plot holes, and pseudo-philosophizing that even the greatest animation can't redeem the film. It starts off with Dante's girlfriend Beatrice being murdered and her pure soul being pulled into hell and Dante swearing to get her back and brings along her favorite cross. On the way he meets the Roman poet, Virgil, a guide for his trek through hell, though he really doesn't do much except serve as a convenient plot device, and I suspect he's supposed to be for tutorial help for the game.

  We soon find out that Lucifer wants Beatrice's pure soul and is going to marry her. ""Cleopatra, Helen of Troy, etc etc"" weren't good enough for him because their souls were tainted. My problem with this is when Beatrice accepts Lucifer her soul will become tainted. How could marrying the embodiment of evil NOT taint the soul? So how would that make her any better? Doesn't make any sense.

  And Dante himself is pretty generic. He grunts and growls and screams as he swings his scythe around making grand remarks about slicing demons in half and saving Beatrice. He has flashbacks to times when he sinned (while in the corresponding circle of hell) and feels bad for them. During one of these moments he says a priest absolved him of all his sins, but is told that no man can absolve sins and save another from hell. That's fine and I'd accept that, except he uses his girlfriend's cross to SAVE PEOPLE FROM HELL. At one point a phantom of Lucifer appears angry that Dante saved someone from hell and at another point laughs at Dante for failing when Dante tried praying to God to save some other souls from hell (instead of using the soul freeing cross he has and has used before). Internally consistent, this story is not.

  So Beatrice finally DOES marry Lucifer, since Dante had actually killed a lot of innocent people during the Crusade and was unintentionally responsible for her death (don't ask, it involves a lot of convenient plot points). She turns into a demon and attacks Dante. Dante shows her her cross and she turns mortal again and angels come and take her to heaven. An angel appeared in the 8th circle of hell just to pick up some chick that accepted God. Why not pick her up when she was still pure to begin with? Why wait until she renews her faith in God AFTER becoming the Queen of Hell? Because then we have no story.

  The last problem is when Dante is fighting Lucifer, Lucifer is about to escape hell and arrive at purgatory after being released into his true form by Dante (involving a whole mess of ""ha ha this was my intention all along"" cliched drivel). As he's about to escape, Dante prays asking for forgiveness and that he's willing to sacrifice his freedom to trap Lucifer and himself in hell. So, Lucifer freezes solid and Dante proceeds to jump through the portal to purgatory and arrives at purgatory... what was that about sacrificing himself? ""Psych! Ha ha I'm not really willing to sacrifice my happiness to keep Lucifer trapped in hell, God!"" Really, there's no other explanation to his unceremonious escape from hell after making that sacrifice.

  This story reminds me of a bad 90s comic that uses cheap Biblical references to seem edgey when really it's shallow and stupid. It's completely style over substance in the worst way possible.",1264896000,13,4012,4.552155771905424

3984009,4,B002T5QM92,"Following up their prequal to Dead Space: Downfall, Film Roman was pinned to do an animated version of the Dante's Inferno video game from Electronic Arts. This was a dark fantasy adaptation of the first part of The Divine Comedy poem by Dante Alighieri from the Middle Ages. But unlike some other animated video game tie-ins, An Animated Epic is an abridged playthrough retelling of the game itself. However, it acts similar to anthology films like The Animatrix as different studios were tasked to handle the various levels of Hell. This includes anime productions companies like Manglobe and Production I.G.

During the tale end of the Third Crusade, Dante(named after the poet)is a Templar Knight coming back home to England to find that everyone in his house has been murdered, including his sweetheart Beatrice who begins to pass over into Heaven, but is then dragged down to Hell by Lucifer's shadow-self. Dante follows Beatrice's soul into the underworld while being guided through all 9 Circles by the ghost of the Roman poet Virgil. Along the way, he encounters the various tortured residents, some who offer help and direction, while others are seeking to win favor with Lucifer, including members of Dante's family and fellow Crusaders. Lucifer plans on making Beatrice his wife to rule at his side, so Dante has to make it to the ""church"" on time to crash the wedding. This all turns out to be a ploy by the fallen angel to make his way back into Heaven.

The movie works well as a single narrative, despite the various chapters its layered out in depicting the various levels of Hell. Each chapter is done by different studios, which makes for some clashing character designs carried over from the following chapters. The plot flows pretty well enough, with some standard level bosses for each chapter, given the fact that there are numerous flashbacks going over the various characters' past sins. Despite the NR rating given to it, this film is a hard R, with blood and gore that make Clive Barker look like Mister Rogers! Even if you're not heavily into video games, Dante's Inferno does make for a literal epic, but for profoundly mature audiences.",1504656000,,2166,4.883152173913044

3984026,3,B002T5QM92,"Well this was an intersting cartoon movie.  It does keep up with a good amount of the plot points and events of the game, it misses the mark on some of the elements that made tge game great and that made the video game intersting.  It does feature some of the enemies you know if you've played the game, but it doesn't feature all the bosses or plot points featured in it.  The movie kept some of the dialog, but rewrites some of the events as you can tell the many directors and film studios wanted to add their creative vision to the art styles, events, and dialog.  This subtracts from you getting comfortable with the charactors, as after a few segments, everone looks somewhat different to oddly different from thier appearance in the first segment.  The music is straight from the game, which is a necessity as the soundrack was very moody and impactful, but this leads to another downfall.  That is that the environments are a let down compared to the tracks excluding the ction sequences.  In the game, the musical composition wasn't just written to reflect the dramatic moments, but to stir your emotions with the epic scenery.  To paraphrase the game makers,""We wanted the environment of hell to be the main character.  It is made of human souls, vast,dramatic, and disturbing.""  They also composed the music to emphasize this as well.  The voice acting was pretty good, but as the cartoon was made for foreign audiences first (though the game was primarily made by an American company for American audiences first) not all of the dialog syncs with the mouth movements.  This IS NOT a bad movie, but it could have been so much more if it was better thought out, with one director, and stayed with some of the origional elements such as how Dante obtains the scythe weapon.  Oddly enough, it is not stolen away from the grim reaper, but taken from one of the run of the mill hell minions, which is pretty lame compared to the game.  It also would have been awesome to have Dante dueling the reaper for it like in the game, instead of what they did here. For me...it fell flat and left me shaking my head at a lot of moments.  My suggestion...rent it don't buy it, but it is definitely worth watching a few times.",1469664000,3,2221,4.531328320802005

3984044,1,B002T5QM92,"Just finished watching ""Dante's Inferno"" released by Starz Media.
I must confess that I love hunting through bargain bins of DVDS that have been marked down to $5 or less.  You can really get some good bargains on DVDs and even bluerays - especially during the holiday season.  It's like treasure hunting on a beach with a metal detector - you'll never know what you'll find, a pull tab from a soda can, or a diamond ring.  Unfortunately, ""Dante's Inferno"" wasn't one of those really good deals that I snatched up.  It turned out to be pull tab quality.
""Dante's Inferno"" is a anime movie companion to the fame of the same name by Electronic Arts.  I don't remember the game; but that doesn't say much.  The concept behind this anime; and I suspect the game as well, is let's turn one of the greatest literary masterpieces into an orgy dripping with homo-eroticism and heterosexual orgies of lust; and instead of a thoughtful poet, let's turn Dante is a crusader who represents the worst in humanity while trying to save his betrothed from becoming Lucifer's bride.
This anime wasn't worth the price of admission.
NOT RECOMMENDED!

3984055,3,B002T5QM92,"There are visual images here, I think, that would have had the historical Dante Alighieri smiling and taking notes, for he was a man so open to intellectual stimulation of all sorts that scholars are willing to classify him as a Renaissance poet even though he lived smack dab in the middle of the Middle Ages. He was literally hundreds of years ahead of the whole continent in which he lived. All on his own he re-imagined the afterlife for the Catholic Church. He made himself the hero of a journey into through Hell, basically putting himself right up there on the same stage with Christ and the Virgin Mary and God, and the Pope was like, Amen to that. Do you dig that? The man was fascinating, passionate, a genius. Italian.

The real bait and switch here is that instead of Dante's inferno, this is a weird mishmash of Grimm's Fairy Tales, Japanese Anime and American Horror. Worst of all, there's not a trace of Italy in it. It's as though you transplanted some wonderful Mediterranean palm into the middle of a cold English field and watched it perish overnight. It's obvious that a good degree of historical research went into this, so why-oh-why turn Italian Dante the poet into some crusader from far to the north. Is this some sort of focus group decision? Are we ashamed of Dante's Italian heritage, his preference for the pen over the sword?

It's especially confounding when you see that Dante's Virgil is there playing the exact same role as he did in Dante's Inferno, so much so that it's like a cut and paste job that clearly does nothing to enhance all the original elements of the new Dante. I'm sorry, but who CARES about Virgil. Nobody reads Virgil today unless they've already read Dante, so why even bother to keep him around.

My message to the creators of this movie would have been this: Why not be honest? What you want to do is send an original character into Dante's vision of the afterlife the same way that Dante put himself into Virgil's afterlife. Why not, then, present Dante, the real Dante with all his Italian zest and fervor, acting as the guide for some new protagonist, who can then be as original as you want. Make him a knight or a cowboy or a computer programer.",1429920000,2,2206,4.551637279596977

It was on the same level as the ""Berserk"" anime series: so-so animation quality, lots of blood and gore, some explicit themes and nudity, etc. The animation style changes several times, which was a little jarring but also kept it interesting from an artistic standpoint. The battle scenes were fairly good.

When some one takes a great story and completely changes it and uses a few names from the original to sell it; that's where I draw the line.  I have a hard time believing that any of the positive reviewers even read the original Divine Comedy.  For an animated film it was ok.  If the hero of the story was named Gregory and and the heroine, Danielle, then it could have been an entertaining story loosely based on Dante's Inferno.  But to deliberately misrepresent the nature of the main characters and the entire story itself made this very difficult to watch.  If you think that you can familiarize yourself with the story by watching this instead of reading the book you are sadly mistaken, it is not even close.  Dante was a humble poet, not a Soldier, especially not a Crusader, Beatrice was never taken to Hell therefore never needed anyone to rescue her.  Dante and Beatrice were never lovers or engaged to each other. they both married other people. That does not even scratch the problems with this story.

It all just becomes rather uninteresting after the first thirty minutes of the movie. Some really interesting and timeless issues are being touched upon and the story is so loaded that there is true epic potential.

As an English professor, I purchased Dante's Inferno for possible use with students to enhance their reading of Dante's work.  I am not bothered by the fact that this is not a literal depiction of the epic; when I purchased it, I was looking for an interpretation of Dante, one which remains true to his themes regardless of detail.  In that regard, the film does not disappoint.  Much of Dante's intent is present in the film.  My caution would be to anyone wishing to use the film in a similar manner.  The film is violent and contains nudity.  If these attributes pose a probem for you as an educator, you will likely not want to recommend this film to your students.  However, it is still worth your time as a teacher to watch the film; it is well-made and may inspire ideas you can incorporate into your teaching.

3984131,3,B002T5QM92,"Based on the Playstation game, but based first (but not necessarily foremost) on the Dante classic (instead of entirely the reverse), this `Inferno' is actually closer to the book and has more actual quotations from one of the greatest pieces in Western literature than any other cinematic version I have yet seen. The GCI is impressive more than not in many scenes--even if the readings and characters sometimes come off with no more emotional appeal than a `Cartoon Network' special or a Saturday morning cartoon.  The art direction has quite a scope: from flimsy sketches to splendid panoramic interpretations of hell as we know it from the text.

The circles stay close to the book, but they make Dante the Pilgrim and Poet more like a chivalrous warrior (and anatomically correct--I must add--like today's mannequins and super heroes) who must save Beatrice (who in this interpretation) has been captured by the torturous and deceptive Lucifer. (Yes, this Satan has dialogue and seems more like the evil emperor in Star Wars than the Devil we know from Dante as the eternal emperor of hell, deglamourized, crying eternally with his eyes frozen shut and his bat-like wings moving like a windmill producing an eternal lake of ice [Coccyx]).

Also added to the plot are flashbacks shuffled from faux memories with grueling war scenes (undermining the crusades) to poignantly painful moments in Dante's fictitious past (reading more like a modern family fable than anything allying us to Dante Aligheri's biography).

Even with the departures, the circles are depicted closer to the book and the overall interpretation is closer to Dante than any film version I've ever seen (especially 'What Dreams Must Come' and Sean Meredith's paper cut-out interpretation of Sandow Birks' [et al] novel).

3984133,4,B002T5QM92,"This animated version of the classic prose poem ""Inferno"" written by Dante Alighieri in the 14th century appears to have been produced as a promotional tie-in to an EA computer game of the same name. Putting aside the commercial underpinnings, viewing this video as a stand-alone variation of Alighieri's literary classic it comes across as a well produced tale that has made some modifications on the original storyline, probably to fit in with the plot of the computer game. Dante, in the animated film, comes across as a sympathetic character with very human failings, though it seems he is characterized with far greater anger and depths of personal inner sin than the original story details and engages in mortal combat with many of the beasts of hell as he seeks to free the wrongly captured soul of his beloved fiancee being held in the lowest circle of Hell. During his journey he also encounters both of his parents, one confronting him in the form of a demon, the other as an imprisoned and suffering soul.

The animation is excellent, very fluid and spectacular with well choreographed battles and detailed images of the suffering the damned souls must endure and clings fairly close to the details of Dante Alighieri's original concept , at least in the construction of Hell itself.  I recommend this video, but this is for a mature audience only. There is quite a lot of bloodshed and nudity.

The DVD worked perfectly.  Video and audio were excellent.  Also, I liked the fact that there were no preceding commercials for other DVD's before the main menu of the DVD.

3984134,1,B002T5QM92,"This movie was most disappointing.  After playing the game on PS3, I was actually excited to see what a movie based on this epic could be like.  First of all, it's short, about 88 minutes.  I did not find that the movie reflected enough of what we see in the game or enough that you can read about if you decide to tackle the actuel epic poem written by Dante.  A lot has been left out.  The transitions betweeen the levels of Hell are marked by titles.  The animation is ok at best, not the kind of quality you'd expect from a good japanimation.  For some reason, Dante changes appearance without explanation trhough the movie, his past is relived in flashbacks, which is aobut the only thing that corresponds to the depiction of his memories in the game.  Personnally, I'd say, if you want to know Dante, read the classic.  If you're a gamer, play the video game instead, you'll still learn more about that great story.  I couldn't bear to watch more than 40 minutes of it before I got sick of it.",1286928000,2,999,4.380434782608695
3984135,3,B002T5QM92,"Dante's Inferno: An Animated Epic is based on the recent video game from EA and Visceral games.  Dante Alighieri is a knight who has returned home from the Holy Crusades to find his father and wife murdered.  As his wife's soul floats to Heaven, it is intercepted by Lucifer, who drags her down to Hell.  Dante must follow down into the depths of the netherworld, battling through the nine circles of Hell to rescue his beloved Beatrice.

The film follows the path of the game closely...perhaps too closely.  While it's fun to battle through the legions of Hell, fighting monstrous boss characters and absolving heretics of their sins, watching it isn't quite so fun.  As in the game, Dante is aided by the spirit of Roman poet Virgil who guides him on his journey, which basically consists of one battle after another, some sage advice from Virgil, and Lucifer taunting Dante.

The film is told in segments with each representing a circle of Hell.  In all, there are five different animation studios who worked on the film including Dong Woo Animation (Justice League Unlimited), Studio Manglobe (Samurai Champloo), Film Roman (Hellboy Animated), JM Animation, and Production I.G.  With so many different styles and Directors, the film suffers from a lack of consistency both in terms of animation style and characterization.  Some segments have a strong Anime look to them which doesn't work well with the Gothic/Medieval setting of the film.  Dante himself looks decidedly different in the various styles, appearing alternatively has a hulking knight to a lithe martial artist.

The film failed to improve on the thick-witted personality Dante shows in the game.  He has little to say outside of shouting, ""Where's Beatrice!""  Or ""I must save Beatrice!""  Game fans may (or may not) be happy that Circle Two's giant boss Cleopatra who pulled demonic babies from naked breasts is nowhere to be seen.  Most of the other bosses of the game are present including Charon, Cerebrus, King Minos, and Dante's own father.  The film maintains the game's theme of sin and redemption but like the game the end is left far too wide open.  The game we can understand as a sequel will surely be forthcoming.  For the film, the ending is unforgivable.

If you enjoyed the videogame you're likely to enjoy the film, if for no other reason than to see the story brought to life.  But the film would have fared much better with one animation studio and director to maintain some consistency.",1286841600,7,2474,4.884892086330935
3984136,3,B002T5QM92,"Animated feature that loosely follows the book.  The story of a man on a quest to rescue the woman he loves from the 9 rings of hell, and finally the devil himself. The rings include purgatory, lust, and greed. (I found out afterword that this is now a video game which explains the movie.)

May not be for younger children as the animation does show bare breasts.  I was not that impressed by the animation however the grandson thought it was good.  But he was not overly impressed by the movie.

All that aside, some adults may want to use this movie as a drinking game for the excessive amount of times he says 'Beatrice'.

Not needed to play the game, but a fun inner look at the story of Dante's Inferno. Absolutely not for the little ones! Nowadays, with some many kids playing games that may be too mature for them, this is something mom and dad might see and think is would be good to get, but not this one! Sex, violence, nudity...use caution. Otherwise, a great little flick!",1279756800,,492,4.417582417582418
3984138,3,B002T5QM92,"A commercial for the Dante's Inferno video game aired during the Super Bowl earlier this year, which gave viewers the impression that the game would be incredibly reminiscent of games like Devil May Cry and God of War. Although I never played the game, Dante's Inferno: An Animated Epic was sent to me by the Amazon Vine program. My expectations weren't very high and that seemed to pay off in the long run. The animated feature takes the Batman: Gotham Knight approach where six different animation directors take hold of the film, but Dante's Inferno tells one semi-coherent story. The film surely has no issue with showing graphic violence, gore, or nudity as there rarely isn't a moment in the 77 minute feature where buckets of blood aren't falling from the sky or where Dante's beloved Beatrice isn't exposing her rather well endowed set of breasts. The changes in animation seemed rather infrequent and drastic at times while at others it felt a bit more natural. The voice acting is pretty top notch as the film utilizes voice actor veterans such as Mark Hamill, Steve Blum, and Kevin Michael Richardson. Dante's descent through the nine circles of hell was unintentionally humorous at times though. The main example being when he's fighting off and fleeing from the army of dead babies in Limbo. Also, his father accepting Lucifer's offer to work for him in exchange for all the gold he desired and the slaying of his mortal son wasn't surprising, but the fact that his mouth now looked like a vagina was. Certain things just didn't add up at times. In the end, Dante's Inferno: An Animated Epic isn't terrible but isn't fantastic either. It's not worth hunting down specifically, but is worth sitting through on a rainy day afternoon or something.

The only special features included on the DVD are the EA game trailer and animatics for five scenes in the film.",1279497600,,1871,4.8105590062111805

This is a decent, modern re-imagining of Dante's classic tale. It was not always easy to follow and the pacing was off in spots, but the visual eye-candy, exotic levels of hell and more action than you can swing a sword at, held my interest all of the way through. The use of different artists for different parts of the movie help bring distinction to the various stages of the story, but the work was all similar enough to keep it from being distracting. The voice-over acting was top notch as was the DVD sound quality. The sound design is highly immersive on a good home theater system with the lights down low.

For anime fans, Dante's Inferno is worth a rental and perhaps even a purchase. Those adverse to mild sexuality and gory animated violence should look elsewhere -- this one is definitely not for young children. It is not great cinema, but it is a pleasant 88 minute diversion.",1276128000,2,1168,4.665048543689321

The story in some ways did stick to the basis of the manuscript, a mans journey through the tortures hell and in the end to come face to face with the devil. Now with that original concept added with a templar knight's ""warrior skill"" you'll have the overview of this anime. Besides being a fan of classical literature, i am also a fan of anime and i can appreciate them both equally on there seperate terms. Dante's Inferno(anime) had a great anime based story, full of action, drama and good imagery. What made this anime a true delight was the different animation styles by some of the greatest anime artist around. All n' all if you enjoyed animes such as: afro samurai, sword of the stranger, vampire hunter d blood lust, trinity blood, samurai 7, spawn(animated series) and samurai champloo you'll greatly appreciate this one.

3984143,3,B002T5QM92,"In this extremely loose adaptation of Dante's Inferno (with bits of Purgatory and Paradiso thrown in for good measure) we are treated to a dumbed down and degraded version of the original. I can understand why animators and game producers would want to co-opt the work, its quest-like plot of a hero extricating himself from a series of levels seems ready made for this type of entertainment. The voice talent is good and devoid of a lot of the silly flourishes so often included in anime (child-like groaning and squealing by women, etc). Some of the levels are nicely conceptualized like Greed and the City of Dis. As Dante travels through the levels of hell the characters' appearances change which is an interesting break with convention. I preferred the less anime-like depictions, and some of those levels were very nicely rendered.

I feared that the work would be marred somehow by inclusion of some adolescent fantasy and sure enough, Beatrice, the embodiment of purity in Dante's original, is never seen unless exposing some part of her anatomy. And the level Lust manages to combine pornography and grotesquery in a fashion that will only please the most maladjusted of teenage boys. One can only imagine why the writers would want to include such things as heads being loped off and ample streams of blood and gore. I suppose it is what the audience demands.",1273708800,,1370,4.879828326180258

The quality of the animation changes as the movie progresses, and drops real low toward the end where the voices don't even come close to matching the animation of the characters' mouths.  If you've seen Batman Gotham Knight then you'll be prepared for the shift in animation quality.

There's a guilty pleasure associated with watching it.  While it doesn't do the original story line justice, there's enough momentum there to keep your attention long enough to see how it concludes.  All told, it advertises the game it is based on quite nicely.",1273449600,,660,4.745614035087719

Amazingly enough, though, the film was still able to win me over with stunning, textured animation (NOT computer generated), fantastic voice talents, and a story and main character that both become surprisingly rich as the story moves forward.  I found it incredibly rewarding to watch a simple, two-dimensional hero come face to face with the accidental sins he'd been party to throughout his life and seek redemption and extreme self-sacrifice in the process.  It's exciting, shocking, and incredibly thoughtful -- much more than a shameless video game tie-in.  It also exhibits a decent understanding of Hell as Dante portrayed it, even though the plot is entirely original.

All in all, this is a first rate effort, and it's the kind of anime classic that I'd be proud to put on the shelf next to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Akira/dp/B00012QLQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Akira</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghost-in-the-Shell/dp/6304493681/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghost in the Shell</a>, but I must warn parents that this is definitely not a film for kids and adolescents to watch.  Sex and nudity are excessive throughout, whether in portraying half naked corpses, naked lovers praying, or demon temptresses with highly detailed (and weaponized) genitalia.

Partially nutidity, graphic violence and some rather disturbing images (even for adults) are used frequently throughout the film.

3984152,2,B002T5QM92,"Dante's Inferno, as anyone would know, is an epic poem and masterpiece of Italian literature.  Be warned, however, that in spite of the title of this movie it has little in common with the source work.  The familiar characters are present, but in name only.  In order to jazz up an old story the creators of this film have made Dante into a scythe-wielding badass who charges headlong into the depths of hell in order to rescue his beloved Beatrice.  Though the content manages to retain the underpinnings of sin and redemption, it is based only very loosely on the original story.  Artistic license is indeed a gross understatement.

On the positive side of things, if you choose to look past the poetic freedoms taken with this film, you will be rewarded with some excellent animation, directed by six different masters of the trade.  Viewers may experience a slightly disorienting sensation as each style change occurs, but the stunning visuals do an excellent job of portraying Hell in its many forms.

Hell is, of course, a nasty place.  As such be prepared for an incredibly graphic depiction of it.  Breasts abound in almost every scene, possibly in order to attract the same young male target demographic as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/related-video-game/dp/B001NX4DUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">related video game</a>.  Sexual imagery pervades the entire film, but is certainly most dramatic during the ""Lust"" segment, which includes female demons attacking with their genitalia.

In addition to the erotic themes, you will also find yourself engulfed in floods of blood and gore.  The hero of the story wastes no time in deploying his considerable combat skills, slicing and dicing his enemies.  As foes are dispatched limbs are severed and blood paints the screen.  Hell is no place for the squeamish!

The tragedy of this film is that its beauty is only skin deep.  The writing of this so-called epic adventure fails to keep pace with the art direction.  Despite the talented roster of vocal performers, most of the dialogue is on par with a decent Saturday morning cartoon.  The delivery is often overly melodramatic, which becomes tiresome almost immediately.  The characters also fall flat due to the breakneck pace at which the story progresses.  No more than a few minutes are spent in each circle of Hell, which precludes the possibility of truly fleshing out the cast.

While there may be some entertainment to be found in this version of Hell, it is clear that this Inferno was built for action alone.  If you're in the mood for an absent-minded hank & slash adventure you may find some redeeming qualities in Dante's Inferno.  There's even an outside chance that this movie may inspire a new generation of readers to take in the classic master work.

The animation is at times very violent. I would not show it to a child; however, it would be great in a high school or college literature class.

I laughed here and there when it came to some of the things I saw, knowing that some of the fights would be nice and horrible and tragic if you think about it.

That's the beauty of things like thins and the beauty of touring hell: when you stare into the abyss long enough, you might see granny or some other family memebr (wait, that's not how it goes!)

A lot of people did not like it because of a few reasons, but I thought it had all I needed here. The animation was what I expected, the turns and the playground of pain was what I wanted to see, and the wailing souls - some of this is a bonus, but I forget which part. What I do recall is that some of the taunting and some of the playground love that the opponents showed toward each other was sweet; they saw each other, eyes locked, and then they hacked off limbs and lips and whatever else could be found.
How sexyyyy.

Before buying this, look at both sides of the coin. you may agree with others on this because you might not want the purist gone (although I cannot see why you would look to a guy with a huge weapon and think ""that's gonna be a tale taking few liberties), you may not like not having a tour set up ahead of time (its only open from 8-5, for the devil's sake!), and so on.

(They answer, obviously: ""No"" ""Huh?"" ""Whassat?"" and ""Yeah Jim Carey was in it"")

""Novel Enthusiast"" and ""T. Adlam"" (who are the current top two reviews on this product) have very useful and intelligent reviews of this DVD and there is another on IMDB that references the creators and their previous work.

It IS like watching someone play the videogame (that's a good thing)...or maybe like watching the cut-scenes of the videogame with some of the battles--shortened of course--tossed in. That is the point; it's a companion to the videogame. And of COURSE, it isn't ""faithful to the original"" it's not supposed to be. It is based on the original & has just the right amount of Dante. And the ending is what we call ""setting up the sequel"" when we who watch movies talk amongst ourselves.

The animation is beautiful--over the top in the blood department, but nicely done...in the vein of ""Vampire Hunter D"" or ""Ghost in a Shell"" (not surprising since this comes from some of the same people). The slightly different animation styles ot the sections of the film flow into each other. I liked some more than others, but all were interesting. I loved Shuko Murase's ""Witch Hunter Robin"" series. And I respect the other works of the several other directors and animators who worked on the project (well, Mike Disa did help to inflict ""Eight Crazy Nights"" on the world...but we can forgive him that).

I probably would have given this three stars, maybe two and a half (were it not for the overabundance of unfairly low star-scores) because it's just not my cup of tea. I enjoy playing some survival horror games (Fatal Frame & Silent Hill) but not all. I did think about getting the game & the trailer on this DVD looks breath-taking...but I decided to pass on the game.

3984158,2,B002T5QM92,"Perhaps I should have known better.  A movie based on a video game based on Dante's ""Inferno""?  How good could it possibly be?

But I took a chance.  Unlike some (I'm looking at you, Mr. Ebert), I acknowledge that video games can be post-modern works of art in their own way.  And it's undeniable that the video game industry is grabbing some of the most creative minds in America and overseas.  I try to read Dante every couple of years, so I figured what the hell, I'd give it a shot.

What a goof.  The movie starts promisingly enough, with Dante as a soldier returning home from the Crusades.  He comes home to find his family murdered and his beloved, gorgeous Beatrice dying of a gruesome stab wound. But Dante's horrors don't end there - soon Lucifer himself has snatched Beatrice's heaven-bound spirit and claimed it for his own.  Dante follows Lucifer to hell in an attempt to free his beloved's virtuous soul.

That doesn't sound half-bad for a set-up.  But the movie then devolves into an interminable series of scenes where Dante moves from one circle of hell to another, screams ""Beatrice, no!"" and kills the nasties he finds there.  He frees a couple of souls he recognizes, although how Dante is empowered to do this nobody explains, and he's rather churlish in that he doesn't just free everyone and have done with it.  He also slays some demi-Lucifers who have been in hell for thousands of years, thereby raising lots of metaphysical questions that the movie doesn't pretend to answer, as in, how can you kill Minos, the judge of the dead, if he's already dead and in hell?

This might be one fantastic game, but the repeated fighting gets dull quickly.  Dante loses his sword and fights with a bizarre bone-scythe that he instantly masters even though the proportions are all wrong.  Seemingly every opponent in hell can be defeated the same way - I think the Church would be well-served if it would hire some Blackwater mercenaries and send them downstairs armed with the latest in modern armaments - hell could be toppled before lunch.

There are a couple of scenes where Dante confronts his own sins, but there is nothing in this movie that qualifies as real dramatic development.  Instead, the movie is essentially a bunch of cut-scenes from the video game - this is what would happen if you were to play it.  The violence is flamboyant and bloody, but since you are watching it rather than causing it as a player, it gets tedious quickly.

Parts of the movie look great - hell is given some quite diverting circles and some nasty denizens to boot.  But there's nothing here that saves the overall film, and that's a shame.",1270425600,,2646,4.645161290322581
3984159,1,B002T5QM92,"Wow, where to start.  Considering that the cartoon is based on the EA video game, I didn't go into the viewing expecting a strict adherence to the initial influence, Dante Alighieri's 14th century epic poem Inferno, but I was sort of hoping for the general story to crop into the plot.  I suppose in a way it does, at least in the barest conceptual terms.  Reading the back of the case I saw that the story follows a character named Dante, a knight back from the crusades, who follows his betrothed, Beatrice, to hell after she is murdered and her soul claimed by Satan (based on a deal she made to bring Dante home safe from his battles.)  In hell Dante happens upon a guide, Virgil, who helps him descend through the nine levels of hell in order to win back the soul of his beloved Beatrice.  Okay, so even though the story takes some liberties with the source, it doesn't seem to terribly stray, at least I didn't think so until I stuck the DVD in and hit play.

Again, Wow.  Adaptation is rarely faithful, but the Dante's Inferno cartoon is about as far a stretch as can be mustered without just cribbing the title.  Again, considering that the original poem was used to form the familiar framework for an action based video game, I can totally see past this, but it's no excuse for how base and pedestrian the final story was handled.  The writers and artists of this cartoon anthology (as well as those who designed the core story elements from the game) have managed to put together a disjointed and boring escapade though hell in which the main character is almost impossible to get behind.  The action and violence is borderline stupid, and represents the mentality of an angry twelve year-old boy.  In his initial decent into hell, Dante and Virgil board a ferry (a variation of Charon, in which he IS the ferry itself) to cross the river Acheron, much like in the poem.  When Charon disgustingly orders Dante off because he is a mortal, Dante defies him, first battling a horde of winged demons, and then murdering Charon (who is a boat and a concept mind you), piercing his giant head with his newfound demon blade and then forcing the ferry to impale itself on the jagged rocky shores on the far side of the river Acheron.  We're treated to a repeat of this process as Dante makes his way through the various circles of hell, battling with the ""gate keepers"" (Cerberus who guards the 3rd level of Gluttens, a series of sirens in the second level Lust, etc.), and again, dispatching all who cross his path.  So Dante in the cartoon, instead of taking a life-changing introspective journey through the bowls of hell, is dismantling it level by level.  You can totally see the video game mechanics working themselves out on screen.

The flick is animated by a series of different directors and artists much in the stylistic vein of films like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Animatrix/dp/B00008LDPU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Animatrix</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Gotham-Knight-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B001614E68/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman Gotham Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;cartoons.  Unlike those films though, Dante's Inferno isn't comprised of disparate short stories, but instead is one continuous narrative.  Because the artistic style changes drastically in the hand-offs from one animation house to the next, the flow if the film becomes completely disrupted and awkward.  Dante's character design changes a lot from one interpretation to the next, going from a short-haired well built guy to a long-haired thin man.  Similarly the poet Virgil shifts between a wraith-like svelt goth to a stocky literally wooden figure.  The animation itself is mostly well-done, though there is an overabundance of CG camera movements that give the flick a very cheap visual feel.

All in all I think this cartoon is an utter waste of time.  Faithfulness to the original poem aside, the cartoon feels like watching a video game, which is pretty much only fun when you're actually playing the game.  The violence and gore is insanely stupid with only a few glimpses of creativity (the sirens in the level of Lust are quite disturbing), and I'm not even bashing the fact that it's present, it's just dumb.  The film reeks of being deeper and more interesting than it really is, making up for this with endless disturbing imagery that's so constantly in-your-face that it makes for a numb viewing experience.  Before wasting your time on this, I'd recommend watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hellraiser/dp/6305972001/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hellraiser</a>&nbsp;first for a much more interesting take on hellish (literally) action and suspense, and to see how disturbing imagery and concepts can be worked into a much more satisfying story.",1269907200,6,4940,5.301282051282051

What we found about him is absolutely fascinating. I suggest doing the same. Our research really helped us put this movie in its proper context. When my wife and I go to Tuscany, we are always amazed at how the churches' murals were used to manage the behavior of the people. The depiction of ""Hell"" served the same purpose.

We really enjoyed watching it and we learned alot. The visuals effects are great. We highly recommended it to the people interested in that kind of movies! Not for everyone though. Especially not for kids.",1269475200,2,706,4.4728682170542635
3984161,3,B002T5QM92,"Dante Alighieri's DIVINE COMEDY, and more specifically THE INFERNO, has had a tremendous influence upon our culture.  It's been over a decade since I read this poem, but when I heard that there was a video game coming out that was based on THE INFERNO it really intrigued me. It wasn't so much the game itself, but the idea of what the main storyline would be in the game.  Since I don't have a PS3 or an XBOX 360, I was able to get an idea of what the story the game-developers created by watching the DVD based upon the game.

So, DANTE'S INFERNO is an animated movie conceived by six different directors that is based upon a video game that is loosely based upon a Middle Age Italian poem.  Get that?

The movie revolves around Dante Aligheiri.  In this version of the story he's apparently the son of an English lord gone off to the Crusades to fight for King Richard and win Jerusalem back from the Muslims.  In flashback seen during key points during Dante's journey it's revealed that Dante was involved in some very horrible acts while in the Holy Land.  He returns home to find his family and his beloved Beatrice, to whom he is betrothed, murdered.  As Beatrice, a supposedly pure soul, begins to rise toward Heaven, she is snatched by Satan and taken to Hell.  A gateway is left open and Dante, though a living mortal, follows in pursuit.  Beatrice is taken deep into Hell because Satan intends to make her his bride.  He taunts Dante with the assumption that he can save Beatrice, but only if he's able to make it through the nine levels of Hell alive.  Dante seems to want nothing more than to be with Beatrice again and with the help of Virgil, who serves as his spirit guide that explains to him the tortures of each level, some of the famous people there, and what he must do to open the door to the next level, he begins fighting his way through the nine planes of Hell.  In addition to fighting of Hell's minions, Dante has a cross that contains a real artifact (a thorn from the crown of Christ, I believe) that Dante can use to save any souls he feels don't deserve to be in Hell.

Just like the poem, DANTE'S INFERNO is incredible violent and graphic. There are babies crawling around on four legs with giant scissor appendages, women with genitalia that can both eat a person or pierce them through the heart, zombie desert warriors, as well as numerous harpies and demons.  Appendages get slashed and gore gushes out.  At one point in the movie there are literally rivers of blood.  Oh, and there's also nudity.  There's lots and lots of nudity; numerous full frontal females and every once in awhile a full frontal male.  Oh, and there's lots of cursing, too. I don't recall the ""f-bomb"" being spoken, but there are lots and lots of damns and when Dante damns something he really means it.  I've played the first two GOD OF WAR video games, and in all honesty parts of the story and the tone of the movie are quite similar to those games.

The overall layout of Hell and many of the characters that Dante encounter are actually taken directly from the poem. Also, the narrated segment at the beginning of the film are the opening lines of the poem, spoken word for word. I was actually quite surprised by this.

However, if you're looking for solid theology, look somewhere else.  Other than taking basic ideas from Christianity and the overall theme of good conquering evil, there's nothing in this movie that comes close to good theology.

In terms of animation, the animation is decent and at times beautiful (even in Hell there is beauty).  There were six different animators on the project so there are times that a character physically changes from one scene to the next.  For instance Beatrice's brother, Francesco, has a different hair color and body-type almost every time he is seen.

There are a lot of people who would not enjoy anything at all in DANTE'S INFERNO. However, if you realize that the movie is extremely graphic and explicit and it's only loosely based on the famous poem and don't mind poorly written dialogue (it seems that Dante yells Beatrice several hundred if not a thousand times), it's not too bad. It can work as an introduction to either the famous poem or DANTE'S INFERNO video game.  Recommended for people who have an interest in Dante, who are curious about the video game DANTE'S INFERNO, or those who enjoy extremely graphic and explicit animated movies.

The special features on the DVD include animatics of several scenes in the movie as well as a trailer for the video game.",1268956800,,4542,4.564734895191122

3984163,2,B002T5QM92,"First and foremost, this DVD in no way resembles the epic poem written by Dante Alighieri. They've borrowed a few names and descriptions of the Circles of Hell and that's it.

The story is told by several different animators in varying degrees of skill, the Fraud (second to last) segment being notably and particularly bad. Dante, no  poet here but a super ninja Crusader Knight easily slaughters his way with little to no effort through the various Circles of Hell and it's demons wielding the typical oversized unbelievable anime weapon, a giant scythe this time in an attempt to rescue his beloved Beatrice who is being held captive and about to be wed to Satan. Interspersed in the visions of Hell we're treated (though it's really no treat) to flashbacks of the acts of depravity and slaughter that Dante did during the Crusades. Instead of seeing him as a hero he's really rather despicable. The dialog is overblown and pretentious trying very hard to be serious and deep which just doesn't mesh right with the rather silly nature of the movie.

Had they not used Dante Alighieri and his Inferno and simply made this a trip into hell alluding to the epic poem I'd have given it three stars but for the blatant misuse of Dante's name and work I have to give it two.",1268956800,,1271,4.64

That being said the animation work is stunning. At first I did not notice that there were different artistic styles, but they blend very well together. Much like the Animatrix, but on a continuous storyline.

The designs used to depict hell are stunning and grotesque at the same time. The use of color and animation is great.

I have watched anime for a long time... All sorts of it too, and I must say I would like to see more like this. The story is well scripted and acted.

The morality is layered well into the story and brings about a nice perspective in the end. Very thought provoking....

3984166,3,B002T5QM92,"As I'm not a gamer, I had no idea what to expect and that made watching this movie challenging and humorous.  First, no kids. Mine are just over a year but it's frightening for little kids. The adult themes rule out letting elementary school children see this film. And since it's a brilliant animation version of a game, I guess this film would appeal best to mid-level teenagers and above through maybe 25 years of age.

The animation style changes a bit during the film but is always high quality. Even though some crazy things happen, and I don't want to give spoilers, the plot makes sense and follows basic ideas from the Divine Comedy. Certainly this will enhance interest in Dante's classic, one of the great works of world literature.  The movie made me think about the literary concepts of Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso.

The punishment for each sin is a contrapasso in Inferno.  The Mountain of Purgatory really shows the medieval viewpoint, so brace yourself.  One's experiences in Paradiso depend on their spiritual development as we see in Dante's Inferno.  Of course this movie adds visual effects that are alarming, but overall an inspiring message is conveyed.",1268697600,2,1180,4.899497487437186

This trash shows the illiterate movie makers did not even bother to read Dante's works, is COMPLETELY theologically incorrect, is too violent for children, and absurdly incorrect for an adult to waste his /her time & money on.  Heaven, Purgatory, and hell are real (read Dante's books, and the bible) (and not the incomplete bible, changed by a king in 1611 who removed 7 OT books (one about Purgatory), and changed NT wording, too) (The New Jerusalem Bible is the world's most accurate, and I will gladly show you why.  The hero in this trash dvd is NOT tormented the way a soul is TORMENTED, HOPELESSLY in hell.  The movie makers also lost a great opportunity to show how Dante also saw & wrote about in his book on hell ""The Inferno"" Mohammed in the second to lowest pit of hell, next to the lowest reserved for Lucifer (Canto XXVIII verse 30) (8th circle, 9th gulf) (Dante even published a map of hell, and, of purgatory, he was there) (and don't say, Dante was Catholic, therefore promoted the catholic teachings. The catholic church put out a price on his head, so he had no reason to defend catholic teachings). Heaven is real.  Few go there (Matthew 7:13-14).  Most before they go to heaven burn in Purgatory (Matthew 5:26), but WILL get to heaven.  Hell is unending, and the place, sadly, where most people go (read from amazon.com Bill Wiese's 2 books on hell, he was there, and read Don Piper's 2 books on Heaven, he was there.  Also read ""Purgatory"" by Fr. F.X. Schouppe, S.J.) and learn the most important things you can possibly learn!  When you go to hell, you stay.  When you go to Purgatory, you will only go to Heaven one day, year, or century, but burn (REAL BAD) first.  Or, you will go to heaven, and stay in Heaven forever.  The dvd makers made it seem people can go anywhere, and travel anywhere, too, back and forth.  NOT SO.  HOW CAN YOU MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT DANTE BUT NOT READ HIS BOOKS?  HOW CAN YOU MAKE A DVD ABOUT HEAVEN, PURGATORY AND HELL, AND NOT KNOW THEOLOGY?  A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY, AND IT SHOWED NOTHING OF THE TRUE PAIN OF HELL, A WASTED OPPORTUNITY.

3984170,3,B002T5QM92,"Understand this for what it is:  A violent anime made as a promotional tie-in for the ""Dante's Inferno"" video game ... which looks like a visual-effects extravaganza set in somebody's overlabored idea of Hell.

This movie was a collaborative effort by several different directors and animation studios.  Each director was assigned a different chapter.  The quality of animation changes from chapter to chapter (which doesn't bother me,) and the character designs change from chapter to chapter (which does.)  It is noisy and violent, full of video-game action and lots of gratuitous gore.  The ""Lust"" section is one of the most misogynistic things I have seen in a long long time.

The filmmakers have imposed a dramatic storyline that does not exist in the original poem.  I was not aware that Dante Alighieri was a Crusader knight (history tells us that, in fact, he was not.)  Nor do I remember Lucifer kidnapping Beatrice or Dante having to hack and slash his way through hordes of demons in order to rescue her.  (In fact, the poem portrays him as something of a wimp who leans heavily on Virgil for guidance and protection.)  Sure, all this manly fightin' action makes for a better video game, but it's a flimsy concept for a movie and is certainly not true to (and is in some ways flatly contradictory to) the spirit of Dante's classic Divine Comedy.

It was interesting to watch once, but it didn't leave much of an impression.  Certainly not worth repeated viewing.  Definitely consider it a rental, not a purchase.",1268179200,,1524,4.8565891472868215

The film borrows from the famous work of literature, The Divine Comedy, which, of course, is the reason I checked it out.

If you give it a watch expecting even a moderate translation of the source material, spare yourself the disappointment.  The movie takes great liberties, the dialogue is thick and awkward, and the story is inexplicably difficult to follow.

However, from a purely animation standpoint, it is quite interesting to watch.  It has six different directors as they deal with the various levels of Hell, and it was fun to see their interpretations.  It got a bit distracting when main characters would shift in appearance from one director to the next, but it wasn't an insurmountable challenge.

But, if you're not into animation, I don't think you'll find much redeeming about this movie.  It employs gratuitous violence galore, has some uncomfortable nude scenes (it's a cartoon!), and plays pretty fast and loose with Christian theology.  Furthermore, for the most part, though it proclaimed itself an animated epic, it was just plain silly.

Now...let's go to HELL!

Don't let the title fool you. ""Dante's Inferno: An Animated Epic,"" (to be referred to as ""DI"" from here on) is a fast paced animated flick based on the game of the same name that does pretty well for adapting 8-10 hours of gameplay. Just like ""Deadspace: Downfall"" before it, Visceral/EA games has crafted an animated film to accompany their game. Using Starz Entertainment and Film Roman again, this time they took a different approach and instead of a prequel that leads to the game, we get an actual adaptation of the story presented. Albeit with some changes due to time constraints, it is very faithful to the game. This time around however the developers decided to go the anthology type route. It's still one story, but it's broken up into different art styles and has different directors a la ""The Animatrix,"" and ""Batman: Gotham Knights."" Boasting talent from such revered Asian animation studios as DongWoo (Justice League/JLU, Ultimate Avengers), JM Animation (Avatar: The Last Airbender, The Boondocks), Production I.G. (Kill Bill Vol. 1, Ghost in the Shell), and Manglobe (Samurai Champloo). Film Roman did the opening segment, and it's just as good as the rest.

Both the game and animation are loosely based on the first part of Dante Aligheri's ""Divine Comedy,"" and to its credit it's not a bad interpretation. The original poem follows the poet Dante with his guide, Virgil author of the Aenid, through the nine circles or levels of Hell; Limbo, Lust Gluttony, Greed, Anger Heresy, Violence, Fraud and Treachery. Throughout the journey Dante encounters famous people and acquitances that are in hell, some of which are there because of him. In the game and film, Dante is now a templar knight returning from the crusades to his beloved Beatrice, only to find her dying. With her last breath her soul leaves her body and begins its ascension to Heaven. Lucifer however, has other plans, and steals her soul and takes it to hell (Inferno as it's often referred to). What follows is the prerequisite chase and battles to free the soul of his lady love. What isn't so straight forward is how dark the story gets and how not so heroic our ""hero"" is shown to truly be. For a film based on a video game, loosely based on a classic poem, this story has some pretty deep moments for the character. If you've seen the film ""Kingdom of Heaven"" then you know just how over the top crusaders and especially the Knights Templar were. That will give you some idea of what you're in store for.

The game and the film both do very good jobs at illustrating the torturous and terrifying nature of the different levels of Inferno. I'm sure it's much more detailed in the game where each level  takes almost the amount of time as the entire film, but for the glimpses we get in the film, it's truly rather disturbing in some parts. Lust, Greed, and Gluttony especially. Some of the scenery is just as described in the poem. Speaking of the poem, they lifted lines directly form it as well. Sure some of them are in the wrong places, but it still works. Also much of the religious connotations of the poem have been kept, with talk about the sins, damnation and absolution. It's all handled really well, and though it can seem heavy handed at sometimes it's not done 'just because' but usually has something to do with the story.  This is a period piece and anyone that can't deal with thick British accents and Shakespearean speech should probably skip this, but it really works and helps sets the atmosphere.

The different art styles are just amazing, and though I liked some more than others, they all worked pretty well and also help set the tone of the segment. Animation is really crisp, and though I've read reviews saying Film Roman's segment wasn't up to par, I wonder if they were watching a different film as I was actually floored by it. Also there was some complaint about the different styles making it hard to keep up with who's who. Uh no, Dante has the cross sewn on his chest no matter what the style is. So you definitely know who you're looking at. The film looks good. Sounds good to. Aside from some dubbing issues with bad lipflap in segments it's got good audio, and a great score. ""DI"" is a much better effort than ""Deadspace: Downfall"" and it's pretty good as a standalone piece. I wish it had been a little longer but hey that's just because what they put out was a lot of fun to watch. Is it great? No. Is it fun? Yes. Will it make you want to play the game? Hell Yeah! If the film is any indication the game will be a blast, ""God of War"" knockoff or not. So if you enjoy action, violence, gore, a lil nudity, and can take a fair amount of religious topics, ""Dante's Inferno: An Animated Epic,"" will not disappoint.",1267142400,2,4883,4.600459242250287
3984173,1,B002T5QM92,"This is the worst adaptation possible of Dante's Inferno. Dante was NOT a warrior in the story, but a simple witness on a mission from God.  Beatrice was NOT sequestered by Lucifer at all, she only went down to Limbo to request Virgil to protect and guide Dante through Hell and Purgatorio, then she went back to Heaven.  Lucifer in the poem was completely passive and didn't give Dante any problems whatsoever.

So, making Dante a warrior killing dead people just does not make any sense in any reasonable healthy mind.  Finding Beatrice murdered is really bad taste and lack of imagination to make Dante go after her in Hell.

There are many ways to adapt movies from books, but this one is the worst adaptation anyone could imagine.

To make things worst, the quality of this animation is so flat that reminds me of Disney's 60's animations.  I guess they forgot we have gone a long way in animation technology and audience expectations 50 years later.

I wonder why I'm forced to give a 1 star, because this movie does NOT deserve even that.  ZERO star is what they got from me.

3984174,5,B002T5QM92,"I think the word ""Epic"" is most definitely the right word to sum up this new take on Dante Alighieri's divine comedy. Having read the literary work, I was very interested to see how the nine circles would be visually presented, given the development of and adaptation of contemporary styles of animation, as well as the more accepted liberal views on religion of the present day; not to mention that the period in history in which the original story was constructed, the Catholic Church's view on life, heaven and hell were absolute. The combination of all those things had the potential for being something truely unique and inspiring. The final product, I'm pleased to say, turned out to be one heck of a thrill to watch.

Right on the heels of the newly released video game of the same name (concept and all) Dante's Inferno was an excellent piece of work. For those unfamiliar with the story, the plot breakdown is as follows:

Dante, a soldier who took part in the Crusade, comes home from war to find everyone in his father's villa home slaughtered, including his beloved fiance, Beatrice. As Beatrice breaths her last breath and Dante witnesses her soul ascending into Heaven, she is snatched up by Lucifer and dragged to hell. In an effort to free Beatrice from the depths of hell Dante dives head first into the Inferno, with the poet Virgil as his guide, fighting off demons, monsters, illusions, damned souls, and his own dark memories that plague him.

Now, given that this is basically an animated version of the game, you pretty much know what to expect: lots of blood and gore. If anything else is prevelant in this movie, its the blood. Dante goes into the Inferno swinging, hacking, slashing and chopping up anything in his path. Literally. So this isn't for the kiddies, or the soft of heart and stomach. However, just because this is a huge gore fest doesnt take away from how awsome this movie is.

Story: 5/5
The story is an awesome one to tell, albeit its been changed around a bit for cinematic enjoyment, but its a great action flick. There is a nice balance of action, drama, and suspense, and its ultimately a satisfying view.

Animation: 4/5
Since this IS an animated feature, the art does come into question. This part is kind of tricky to judge. The movie is primarily Japanese Anime style, which is great. Whats interesting is that the styles switch up as the film progresses. I'm not sure, but I think for ever couple of circles of Hell that are traversed, everything gets changed to a new style. This is a very interesting choice of presentation, and adds even more to the impressiveness of the movie, but it can a bit off putting, cuz as soon as your used to a new style and like it, it changes suddenly and you have to start over again. Its a minor annoyance, but still kinda cool. Also, the concepts for the characters of hell are amazing, and so very dark. Some of the levels are downright creepy. I haven't played the game, so I don't know how much influence comes from it, but everything in the inferno was beautifully envisioned.... well, as beautiful as one's vision of Hell can be anyway. In all, I think there are about 5, maybe 6 styles in the movie. Oh, and this looks GREAT on blu-ray on an HDTV.

Sound/Music: 4/5
Usually I'm a big critic of movie scores, but this time I let it slide. You don't really expect too much from the score here because your so into the action, there's really no room for anything fancy. Its ok, but nothing that would stand alone if you were to buy the score itself. Sound quality was pretty good, and it better be since this is a blue ray release. The voice acting was pretty good with a few voices you will immediately catch on to (Mark Hamill, for example). Some were better then others, but it gets the job done.

Replay Value: 4/5
This is a fun flick, good for people who like hack n slash, action packed type animes. Good for an occasional view, and even better for the artistic value packed into it.

Overall, I give Dante's Inferno: and Animated Epic a 4.5/5. If not for those minor gripes of mine, it would be flawless, but then again, not everyone is going to like everything. Either way, I still put out my money for it. Its a great movie, worth the price of money and time. Enjoy! I'm going to go watch it again.",1266796800,5,4298,4.508344030808729
3984175,2,B002T5QM92,"The production value of this animated feature is rather low. The graphic style changes no less than 5 times in the film with 5 entirely different depictions of Dante, Virgil, Beatrice, Lucifer and even hell itself. Oddly enough, it starts off with characters that bear a pretty close resemblance to their counterparts in the video game, but dwindles off from there. It's almost as if they locked 5 artists up in 5 different rooms and gave them parts of the movie to draw with no central guidance or communication between them. This movie is a complete pass: clearly just an attempt to rack up more dough off the franchise. Save your money.

By the way, Mark Hamill, just because your Joker voice works for the Joker, that doesn't mean you can just use the same voice for every character you voice. Sheesh, it was almost jarring seeing Dante's father but hearing the Joker from Batman.",1266710400,,884,4.703225806451613
3984176,5,B002T5QM92,"Dante's Inferno was one wild and unique rollercoaster ride to the underworld.  It was very entertaining and captive of the adventure and experience he goes thru.

Dante is a knight trying to save the woman he loves but during the process of his rescue he encounters his old sins of his past and has to face the punishment he made them go through but also has to experience his own troubles and decisions.

The animation was DETAILED AND CRISP.  i like the armor and art for each chamber in hell.  each stage was very fiery and hot with different sins and monsters.  The monsters in this film were tough and intimidating.  But Dante takes them head on and it becomes amusing and vicous.

What i enjoyed and learned from the movie was also cool.  I learned more about evil sins and alot of mythology that i was familair with and newly learned.

The storyline had alot of depth of his past and how he confronts with it.  espeially when he confronts both his parents in hell (it gets better)

OVERALL i would recommend this movie and its a big thrill ride",1266624000,2,1051,4.445026178010472
3984177,4,B002T5QM92,"Based on the first part of the Divine Comedy (with nothing funny about it, at all).

The story is centered around an unnerving journey through the 9 rings of Hell Dante travels to free the soul of his beloved Beatrice, damned because he broke his vow to her. In each ring of Hell he comes face to face with all of his past sins and his quest to free Beatrice also turns into a quest for personal redemption.

It's horrifying, gory, tragic, and uncomfortable to watch at moments. Everything it needs to be, as Hell lives up to it's name.

DO NOT LET CHILDREN SEE THIS! I can't stress enough the need to drop our bigot views on animation, just because it is not live action does not mean it is meant for children!!!",1266537600,3,713,4.3059701492537314
3984178,4,B002T5QM92,"First off let me say that I have watched two recent bluray dvd's that were based off a game (Halo Legends and now this).  The quality of this bluray is amazing. One of the challenges that this story faced vs. the Halo franchise is that there isn't a tremendous back story that they could easily fill in.  This is essentially a anime version of the game and the story is kept in tact.  I was very pleasantly surprised at the delivery of the story and the quality of the animation in this release. The voice over work was good as well.

Here is my breakdown:

Voice Over:
The narration and quality of the voice over is good to very good. I wouldn't say its excellent but definitely deserves merit.
4.5/5

Animation:
The animation varies a bit.  Initially the art style is blocky and more masculine.  As our hero descents into hell the art style changes becoming more feminine.  There are several changes and this is part of the charm of the deliver.y  I really liked this aspect of the story telling and to me it helped tell the story.
5/5

Story:
I cant help but feel that this is the part that could have used some more work.  It almost felt like the video game in motion.  I don't think enough was done from a screen writing perspective to really tool the story for the big screen.  The story isn't bad just seems lacking considering the great source material.  The dialogue as well was at times a bit cheesy but its wasn't prevalent and didn't detract from the overall experience.
3/5

Blu-Ray Extras:
Could have used more extras, maybe game content or something related to Dante's Inferno. If there is one area that always could use improvement its extras!
4/5

Overall:
I asked myself did I regret pre-ordering the blu-ray and how badly did I miss the extras or dislike the lack of depth in the story telling. I don't regret it and don't have any problems recommending this as a purchase for any fan of the game or the original story.  This is something you will enjoy, its feature length and worth the watch.

3984181,3,B002T5QM92,"The animation for the most part was good. However, I was not a fan of the different artists interpretations of the main characters. I understand the reasoning behind it but I felt it broke up the flow of the movie just a lil bit. The movie and game have essentially the same central theme but the execution is very much different. Obviously, since this is the movie, there is more focus on the storyline, which is something the game imo failed on. If you are relying on a the exact same sequences that happened in the game in the movie/vice versa, you will be disappointed. However, the movie does provide a better background on the Lucifer/Beatrice wager and what Dante did to get himself into that trouble. Some noticeable differences between the movie and game that I can think of off the top of my head are:
-Dante acquiring the Scythe(read: no battle with Death)
-Boss battles
-No Cleopatra/Marc Antony
-Fraud was really condensed down. But this is understandable as it could have tacked on another 30-60 mins.
-End battle with Lucifer. Felt kinda underwhelming

Maybe if I did not play the game, I would bump this rating up one notch. However, even the dvd case says this is a companion piece, so it's hard to not draw up differences between the movie and game. Not bad for a rental, I just cant imagine adding it to the collection.",1266105600,4,1338,4.598326359832636
3984182,1,B002T5QM92,"This was so horribly bad I couldn't believe it.  Dante must be spinning in his grave to see what someone has the gall to call an adaptation of his work.  There are other adaptations that are great:  The Inferno by Dermot Mulroney was clever; The Inferno by Tangerine Dream is beautiful and haunting.  This version, on the other hand, is just pure crap.  Lots of blood and guts, though; it might even have been good if they hadn't tried to frame it as ""Dante's Inferno"", but had just called it something like ""Knights Templar Muscleman big happy kill fun"".",1266105600,2,555,4.565656565656566
3984183,4,B002T5QM92,"I have to say that this animation is definitely not for kids, it is definitely aimed at the adults to appreciate. This animation is based loosely on Dante's Inferno, from the fourteenth-century epic poem Divine Comedy. Everything described in that novel, all the levels of hell and who or what you can find there, are in this animation. However, the characters are changed slightly. I will try not to spoil it too much, especially for those who haven't watched it yet. This animated epic also accompanies a PS3 game of the same name which is due out any day now.

The Crusader knight Dante, returns from the Crusades only to find his beloved Beatrice murdered. The reason for her murder is later explained in the course of the story. As her soul ascends to Heaven, it is captured by Lucifer and dragged to Hell, and Dante gives chase. This story basically uncovers the history of Dante's Holy Crusade and what damning deeds he did and how he broke his promise and gave into temptation. It is a story of forgiveness and redemption not just for himself but for certain people who were close to Dante. At the same time, it also tries to teach us that even the purest soul can be corrupted, after being subjected to manipulation by the devil, where he twists and turns the truths and lies, to break you down and make you believe his version of the truth.

I must say I enjoyed the animation thoroughly, there were 3 different animators throughout the entire movie. And each of them did a fantastic job of depicting the damned, the evil and the emotional state of the characters. The first animator used sad and proper tone and lines in the art, probably showing Dante's unbreakable will and righteousness cause. The second had a lot of abstract looks to the characters, probably depicting how they characters were twisted. The later animator brought out a lot of bright colors, probably to show Dante, as he found clarity, redemption and forgiveness in his search for his love.

Blood, murder, butchery, death, gore and much more are the main themes in the story, and why not, they were animating a story about Hell. I think the highlight of the story for me was when Dante found Crusaders in Hell and he questioned it, believing that the Crusaders cause was holy and that they were absolved of sin, and the dead crusaders spat out was that ""The Priest lied!"", probably telling him that this Crusade was all for nothing to begin with and in another life, they didn't have to die. Although some of the characters found closure, the story finished off in an open-ended manner, which wasn't clearly explained.

I highly recommend this animation epic to everyone, especially those who enjoyed animations (or anime) like Animatrix and Akira. And those who can appreciate that some blood and gore cannot be depicted in mainstream Hollywood movies, and can only be so much better depicted only in an animation.",1265846400,7,2899,4.723320158102767
3984184,1,B002T5QM92,"While I agree with the other reviewers who mention the superior quality of the animation, the bastardization of the actual Divina Commedia is appalling.  Dante Alighieri was a poet, not a crusader.  I had hoped that this work might actually be an attempt to make accessible the greatest work of Dante to a generation that responds best to stories portrayed through animation and visual imagery.  It wasn't.  In my numerous readings of this classic text, I do not recall Dante being attacked by and killing (though already dead) babies in limbo, nor do I remember Dante having to slaughter lustful harlots in the circle of the lustful by stabbing them in their nether regions.  This is not Dante's Inferno, and a person desiring a movie depiction that approaches the great text of Dante's Inferno should instead pick up a copy of Giuseppe de Liguroro's 1911 film, ""Inferno"".",1265760000,6,873,4.91156462585034
3984185,5,B002T5QM92,"I have to say, with some amount of guilt in my voice that I really did enjoy this film. My expectations were pretty low to start, so maybe my surprise that the story had real content and had many elements of the book actually incorporated have lead to an overly positive review. That said, it was a pretty good movie in its own right. I would just like to also point out that this is a film that persons under sixteen probably should not be allowed to watch. The artists and writers for the film did a very good job portraying Hell.

I doubt that any person who reviews this film will have anything bad to say about its visuals which are indeed, fantastic. Each character in this story had a good deal of thought put into how his or her character was designed, and I think that it was this that was the main payoff of the film. All of the different creatures of the nine levels of Hell were great, many of them imagined in ways that I would never have considered. The levels of Hell, though imaginatively realized were however, quite similar to how they were described in the book and this could be considered either a bonus for purists or a con for those looking for a few more surprises.

The plot which is what I was really concerned would be lost in this film is actually, despite a large degree of artistic license, preserved fairly well so that perhaps a new group might become interested in Divine Comedy. That being said, while it may appear a gory action movie many of the subtle themes of redemption are still here and the film may perhaps require a second viewing to be fully understood as many of the more violent scenes overshadow the more dramatic for sheer memorability.

I am not usually one for anime, cartoons based on video games, video games or adult themed movies but this film gets my sign of approval.",1265760000,43,1824,4.406528189910979
3984186,4,B002T5QM92,"Featuring multiple animation styles, this adaptation of the video game released by Electronic Arts is a surprisingly good and horrific tale. Dante's Inferno tells the story of Dante, a crusader who returns home only to find his beloved Beatrice murdered, and her soul in the posession of Lucifer himself. As Dante plunges through the Nine Circles of Hell, it is slowly uncovered just how and why all this happened. Featuring some wonderful voice acting, a great score, an buckets of blood and gore; Dante's Inferno: An Animated Epic is a pure blast. Though its ending is pretty underwhelming compared to the rest of the film as a whole, and the final animation style comes off as too cartoony compared to the styles that came earlier, this is still a worthwhile endeavor regardless, even if you have little desire to play the video game.
