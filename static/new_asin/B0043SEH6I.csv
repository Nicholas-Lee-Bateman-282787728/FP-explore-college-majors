4257324,2,B0043SEH6I,it was not worth the money. was not what was expected. would not have rented if there were more reviews.,1347235200,10,104,4.25
4257325,2,B0043SEH6I,"This seems to be about naughty schoolgirls getting their comeuppance from a kinky teacher. Then it turns out that at least some of it is consensual and  others are involved.  DVDs are being made, and by someone the main girl would least suspect.  At least it is a bit entertaining.",1325030400,4,281,4.58
4257326,1,B0043SEH6I,"If I can save even one person from wasting time and money on this monstrosity, I will be happy. This movie was horrible: ridiculous plot, insipid dialog, and characters speaking their lines like it was homework in an ""English as a second language"" class. Don't even watch it if it is free.",1312416000,26,289,4.576923076923077
4257327,2,B0043SEH6I,"If you read the product description and are intrested in this movie then I guessing you probaly interested in the potential for titilation.  Unless you're someone who thinks spanking is the best thing that can happen in a movie, the you'll be disappointed by this movie.  There is no nudity, no S&M, and the acting isn't as good as what you can find in a porn movie.  The only reason I gave this movie two stars instead of one is because the storyline, its twists and turns makes you wonder who really is the villian, and what motivates certain characters.",1295740800,41,556,4.54

4257331,3,B0043SEH6I,"OK-pretty much everybody hated this movie.  Let's run through the reasons why.  They boil down to all the downsides of watching an ""adult"" film, without any of the upsides [I mean, sex scenes].  This looks like it was produced by a couple of families with money who want to be film makers and had to make their own film to do that.  Let's start with the basics of plot.  A private...was that a high school?  No--maybe it was a Junior College for girls.  A boarding school for girls from upper class families.  So: a lot of post-pubescent girls, a seemingly all-female staff except for one portly foreign national, who handles all the video cameras, and one young male biology teacher who mainly seems interested in after class field work.  What could possibly go wrong?  Well pretty much everything.  We start with the directing or rather the lack thereof.  See--if you don't have highly skilled actors, the director is supposed to serve a PURPOSE.  Then you can avoid those ridiculously stilted postures and gestures, the awkward silences when they aren't sure when to speak a line--and the subtleties like facial expression and intonation.  Two: sadly this is not an Oscar-winning cast, so directing was needed.  Three: sound track.  OK this isn't a mega-million production so post-production re-dubbing of everything was not in the cards.  Couldn't they have used a directional mike or something?  So that background noises weren't equally as loud as the actors' lines?  Four: cinematography.  OK actually I have seen worse cinematography; it may not have been groundbreaking but it was work-like, despite lack of quality lighting.  Five: script.  The plot somehow managed to stay mildly interesting despite awkward delivery of lines.  Overall though the psychology was more grade-school than high-school in profundity.  Despite all these flaws I managed to watch the entire thing in one sitting.  What was the most redeeming quality of the film, you ask?  [I hope you ask].  The musical score which in parts was really very good.  Also a couple of these actors show some hint of ability.  Now, if they can get through acting school.  And you may wonder where this was filmed?  Montreal, Canada.",1462233600,4,2198,4.988950276243094

4257341,2,B0043SEH6I,I found this focused indirectly on the problems of young adults that have too much time and not motivated  to succeed. A teacher which marks any teacher that matches the individuals character and therefore leads to an unsafe environment,1396483200,,236,5.051282051282051
4257342,2,B0043SEH6I,"This story had no real plot that showed. It bounced all over the place. When you think it was headed one place (to explain the meaning of why what was happening was happening & thinking it might finally get interesting), it went back to BORING!!! with NO PLOT!!! By the time you saw what was really happening in the school, you blinked & it was over. It leads you to no where but boredom. In all, I saw about 3 mins that were ""worth it"". What you have here is school girls acting like school girls NOT what you might think. You might as well be back in high school because that's all you get here, except for 3 minutes. Definately NOT worth it!.",1391731200,,645,4.209677419354839
4257343,3,B0043SEH6I,The acting is pretty good from some of the cast and poor for others.  I suspect that is the fault of the dialogue however.  The description of the video and the cover art seems to be deceptive.,1386201600,3,193,4.1891891891891895

4257346,1,B0043SEH6I,"The Title of The Movie & The Jacket Description are Very Mis-Leading. While there may be a thinly-veiled storyline / plot ; There is Hardly a Few Minutes of Footage , which does Justice to The Description / Synopsis of this Movie.

ANYTHING might happen to give this move a plot or some other reasons to keep watching. but nope never happened .  and Iv'e seen some bad movies in my time but this one has far surpassed all of them !  it is hands down in first place on my list for ""the worst movie ever made"".O and  i thing it should be G rated cuz the 10 seconds of spanking a fully clothed girl is tame enough for a five year old to watch... you just say see what happens when your a bad girl you get a spanking ...I don't know i keep thinking i must have fallen asleep and missed something but i didn't .... i wish i did .cuz that is two hours of my life just WASTED away and for what? so take my word for it just go to bed ! it will be so much more exiting than this movie was.",1526774400,,823,3.801169590643275

8415245,1,B0043SEH6I,"Horrendously poor acting. Worse than week 2 in an acting class.  And that accent, what the frijoles.  Seriously how was this ever made?

Also, the storyline is so poorly written and implausible that the shock factor of what the school and the lead's mother is all in on is utterly lost. You figure it out right away, and then you can't even really care.

It's basically just a little softcore faux-school girl BDSM with no actual acting going on.

It's super ridiculous and a complete waste of time.  It's not even entertainingly bad.  It's painful to endure.",1514678400,2,559,4.701030927835052
