8652229,5,B00JLPPKQO,"Historically accurate, wonderfully acted, breathtaking cinematography, absolutely riveting television. Not just for Polish people, but if you have Polish heritage, it's a must-watch!  I never intended to watch such an intense and realistic show while pregnant, but my husband and I became addicted and couldn't get enough! you get completely absorbed into the storyline and characters. Truly the best TV series I have ever had the pleasure of viewing.",1429833600,,451,5.536231884057971
8652230,4,B00JLPPKQO,"Good series, but I must report an unpleasant remark that has nothing to do with the artistic part: 2 DVD boxes out of six I received were broken. Not only outside but as well inside where the disk is fixed, causing me some problems. It is a minor problem but worth mentioning.",1426118400,,276,4.326923076923077
