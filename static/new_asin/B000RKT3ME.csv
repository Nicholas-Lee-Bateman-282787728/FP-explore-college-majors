8201162,4,B000RKT3ME,"Slaves of Paris gives us a safe room in the land of the safe word. If a viewer was expecting ""hot BDSM action,"" they would absolutely be in the wrong aisle. The film emphasizes pleasure rather than dicipline. It advances the idea of thoughtfully and carefully introducing the want-to-be slave to the world of the dominatrix. Viewer insight into the film's message can be gained by reading the chapter titles. The favorite chapter for me was ""Victorian School.""  The costuming in this segment of the film was worth the wait. Also I was also pleased to see credits run at the end of the film, something I haven't seen in a Sun production before. Favorite dialogue:  ""What do you suppose Shakespeare meant?""  ""I dunno. That was a long time ago.""",1206921600,3,742,4.6923076923076925
8201163,4,B000RKT3ME,"""Slaves of Paris"" is a great entry point for the newbie slave. It is directed primarily at a female audience with a focus on the mental aspects of ""slavery"" as opposed to the more physical aspects that one encounters in more mass marketed efforts. The mind is, of course, the most sensitive erogenous zone. If you're looking for Andrew Blake, this is not the DVD for you but, if you're new to the scene or if your toying with the idea of getting involved, this is a great place to start. It points out that BDSM activity is consensual and therefore only as scary as the subject wants it to be. It focuses on the idea that activity is progressive, allowing one to approach their limits without necessarily over running them. More importantly, it offers ""permission"" to experiment. Sincere reviewers can disagree but, in my opinion, this DVD should rank high as an introduction to the scene for those who haven't been there yet. I think its apparent that it was intended as an introduction and, in that it fulfilled its intentions, I would rate it as a success.",1205366400,2,1059,4.608465608465608
8201164,1,B000RKT3ME,"The description says this woman agrees to be slave to a dominatrix, as long as she agrees to have her experiences filmed.
Which would make a great DVD. If there were any good experiences to film.
I wasn't expecting this to be hardcore graphic S&M, but most of the film is these two chicks talking about what the slave girl can expect. There's some very light flogging at the very end of the film (just a couple minutes of it, it's done mostly over clothes, and the slave girl doesn't even look like she really feels it).
There's one part mid-film, where the dominatrix talks another woman into doing a session as her slave. She gets the woman nakes, has her kneel in a submissive pose, prattles on a bit, then says something like ""there will be no pain for you now, that is your punishment."" That kinda sums up the whole film.
I honestly don't know why this video was made. It's not a good documentary. You won't learn anything about S&M or B&D from this. It's not good erotica. It's not funny. It's not a drama. There's no peurile, emotional, intellectual, or even ironic reason I can see to buy this.",1203984000,4,1102,4.433497536945813
