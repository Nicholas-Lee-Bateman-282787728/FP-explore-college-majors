4271246,5,B0046ZE3M6,"BEGGING ON MY HANDS AND KNEES!!!  PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE ISSUE THIS IN US FORMAT!!!  I'M NOT A TV BUG!!!  AND IF I RAVE ABOUT A TV SHOW, THE CHANCE IS DECENT, IT'S PROBABLY PRETTY GOOD!  SAW THIS AGES AGO WHEN IT WAS ON TV, AND AMAZINGLY, NOT ON PBS!!!

In other words, before companies who wanted to sell us things actually owned the TV networks and these incredibly bad so-called ""reality"" shows dominated ABC, CBS and NBC!  Remember top-notch shows like The Twilight Zone?  What about The Waltons?  Mary Tyler Moore anyone, and how about the outstahding spin-off, Lou Grant?

Everything about this series is top-notch!  Wait until I tell my husband!  He also saw it, and we both mention it on a fairly regular basis!  Now, if they would only release ""We, The Accused"" and the version of ""Rebecca"" where Joanna David played Mrs. DeWinter...

Ahhh....""To Sleep, Perchance To Dream...""",1185321600,,885,4.781456953642384
4271247,4,B0046ZE3M6,"I loved this series when it was shown on American television.  It inspired a lifelong interest in Australia and the penal colony established there. I've been attempting to get a copy of this series for years.  Oh, when will it finally be released in a format compatible to US DVD players?",1174521600,27,288,4.627450980392157
4271248,5,B0046ZE3M6,"This was a brilliant mini-series that needs to be issued in US format! Fabulous acting, gripping story, developed characters that you could invest emotion in -- top notch, have been looking for it for years.",1168387200,19,207,4.942857142857143
4271249,5,B0046ZE3M6,"This was a great mini series that I remember seeing a long time ago.  The characters have substance and are realistic, and most are very likeable.  I think the settings, story, acting, etc. are all wonderful; an overall quality production.  I just hope it will soon be available in a US format.",1163721600,6,294,4.615384615384615
4271250,1,B0046ZE3M6,"Didn't work in the player it says it should work in. My mother was very disappointed. It's just to much of a hassle to return, I took it as a loss.",1447718400,,147,3.774193548387097
4271251,5,B0046ZE3M6,"Watched this series as a kid......saw it and spontaneously purchased it, loved it. Acting and sets were a little average in parts.....but still awesome and would rewatch again!!",1425168000,,177,5.357142857142857
4271252,5,B0046ZE3M6,Perfect - just missing subtitles,1422921600,,32,5.6
4271253,5,B0046ZE3M6,Very good movie to watch :-),1419724800,,28,3.8333333333333335
4271254,5,B0046ZE3M6,"I love this movie !!!  I saw it years ago, when I was in high school in the late 70's.  I purchased the DVD set, but I can't watch it anymore because my region free dvd player stopped working.  I really wish they would release this film in USA format.",1392768000,,251,3.98
4271255,5,B0046ZE3M6,We were able to watch the series on our Windows XP computer then discovered we could also watch it on our Xbox 360!,1389571200,,115,4.043478260869565
4271256,3,B0046ZE3M6,"A very good serie, but there are no subtitles avalaible and since their irish accent is very strong, it is often difficult to understand what is said.

Otherwise, a fine story of how Australia became independant.",1388880000,,212,4.888888888888889
4271257,5,B0046ZE3M6,"I loved this as a kid and loved it just as much watching it again as an adult. Interesting period of history, great writing and acting. DVDs formatted for U.S. DVD players are available, though it took a bit of searching. I found a couple sites that sell them, including [...] I bought a 4-disc set for $26.95. The quality was relatively good, especially considering the mini-series is from 1978.",1368489600,5,396,4.671428571428572
4271258,5,B0046ZE3M6,"I, as well, saw this on tv years ago (early '80s), and have remembered character names, theme song all these years. Just didn't think I had title right (thought I'd confused it with Bob Seger song). Just searched every way I could think of, and finally found it!! But, alas, no US version! I will be keeping my eyes open for one now, though! A very moving series!",1367280000,,363,4.352941176470588
4271259,5,B0046ZE3M6,"Fabulous movie. Saw it many years ago and couldn't forget it. My new husband adores Australia and has been there 3 times, so knew he would love it too. Bought it for him 2 years ago for Christmas and couldn't play it. Drat! Glad to hear it will play on newer DVD models, so out to shop for a multi-format DVD player. Can't wait to share this movie with him.",1284076800,,357,4.114285714285714
4271260,5,B0046ZE3M6,"I loved this series and wish it were in US format DVDs. After all these years, I can still hum the main theme.",1281312000,,110,3.8260869565217392
4271261,5,B0046ZE3M6,"I saw this mini series one time back in 1978 when stationed in Germany as a young AF member. I thought it was an enlightening and educational series. I would have never known that, that was how the country of Australia was developed.

I found the story very well written and directed.

I wish the producers would re-release it, but this time make a version playable in the USA.

I'd love to see it again.",1268265600,2,404,4.36
4271262,5,B0046ZE3M6,I've searched forthis for years. Saw it many years ago when in the Philippines. I still remember the lines. A rare find.,1231804800,,120,4.5
4271263,5,B0046ZE3M6,"I have been waiting a long time for this dvd.  Now I can watch it.

Here is the trick.  It has to be a newer DVD player.  Older US DVD players will only play region 1. Some of the Newer DVD players will play the newer region 0 DVD.  This version of AGAINST THE WIND set is a region 0 DVD.  Look on the back of the your dvd player to see if it says  region 1, ALL (all=region 0)

I have an older 2002 dvd player that won't play it.. but the unit I bought in 2006 will.  Look for a multiformat DVD player.",1217808000,22,503,3.7142857142857144
4271264,5,B0046ZE3M6,I saw this years ago on US Forces TV in Germany. The drama of how convicts helped found Australia and the portrayal of the characters hooked my wife and I from the start. Please release this in USA DVD format.,1216684800,,209,4.25
4271265,5,B0046ZE3M6,"I saw this miniseries when it was shown in the 70's on one of the regular networks right here in the U.S.A. and I fell in love with it and wanted to own it ever since!  Fortunately, someone from Australia made a copy that would play on U.S. DVD players and sold it on eBay so I NOW have a copy.  Of course it cost me a fortune but it was worth every penny.  This show has it all:  A rich and gripping story, characters that you really root for, characters that are pure evil, characters that fall in-between good and bad; idealism, bravery, cowardice, romance, beautiful scenery, beautiful music, et cetera.  This is what I call great television!",1213228800,2,646,4.394957983193278
4271266,5,B0046ZE3M6,I too saw this years ago on a snowy barely recieving a signal television but watched faithfully anyway and would love to see it again without the snow. Hopefully they will bring it out in US format soon so those of us who are haunted by the story can see it again.,1205193600,,264,4.096153846153846
4271267,5,B0046ZE3M6,I loved this mini-series back in the 70s.  I remember watching it with my entire family and it captivated everyone from my grandmother to my brothers (who were generally too cool for anything).  I will be one of the first to buy the US format.  Please do it soon!!!,1197590400,13,265,4.36734693877551
4271268,5,B0046ZE3M6,"I also remember watching this probably on HBO back in the early '80's and the story was extraordinary.  The believability of the brutality and harsh lives they had to endure came right through the (much smaller) screen!  The acting and script were thoroughly compelling and I've never forgotten the haunting music that was at least the opening each week, and probably ran through the episodes as well.  The Brits (okay, the Aussies) know how to make movies!  Being a region 0 dvd, it should play on some dvd players--I've gotten dvds from the UK before, also region 0 and have played them with no problem, but they should be reproduced to be compatible with all US players.  Quality televison that does not show people learning how to dance, eating pig bladders or hitting each other with chairs!  Well worth getting--I can't wait to watch it again but be prepared, you'll get not much done around the house for a while--it's many hours, and you'll want to keep watching without a break--maybe wait for a snow day!",1190678400,5,1014,4.732954545454546
4271269,5,B0046ZE3M6,Another classic miniseries with the story set in the time of Australia's early penal settlement and convict past. Like Sarah Dane and For The Term of His Natural Life the story focuses on the transportation and survival of a convict against the harsh treatment from the officers in charge of(in this case a young Irish girl)her incarceration . Although my favourite Australian miniseries is For The Term of His Natural Life this is not to be undersold and the story is quite different. A young Bryan Brown stars at the beginning and the main male leading role is played by John English who played Judas in the Australian version of Jesus Christ Superstar.,1188259200,,655,4.8053097345132745
8417548,5,B0046ZE3M6,"This was shown in the US in 1979 and I loved it then!  I couldn't play this set in my TV-DVD player (wrong zone), but put it in a computer disc player and watched it there.  Took me back!",1524441600,,187,3.769230769230769
8417549,5,B0046ZE3M6,Worth every dime I paid for it!,1515369600,,31,3.5714285714285716
8417550,5,B0046ZE3M6,"I saw this as a TV mini-series about 35 years ago, loved it, and have looked for a way to purchase it ever since.  I very much want to buy this DVD but fear it won't play on my DVD or Blu-Ray player.  Please make this available to play in the USA.  It is one of the most wonderful movie series I've ever seen, and I'm really longing to purchase it.",1505865600,2,348,3.8732394366197185
8417551,4,B0046ZE3M6,I received in PAL format. I couldn't play it in my DVD players. Luckily I havery a program to convert it to NTSC.,1503619200,2,113,3.9565217391304346
8417552,5,B0046ZE3M6,What a beauutiful story,1497225600,,23,5.0
8417553,5,B0046ZE3M6,Great. Thank you.,1483401600,,17,5.0
8417554,5,B0046ZE3M6,This was a gift and I was so happy to find the original version for the recipient who had recently asked if it was still around somewhere.,1483228800,,138,4.148148148148148
8417555,5,B0046ZE3M6,A note to let our wonderful American friends know that last night Jon English died after surgical complications ... we Aussies are devastated and will always remember him,1457481600,2,170,5.107142857142857
8417556,3,B0046ZE3M6,"I remember this series from a long time ago.  Though the theme music often overwhelms the action, and can be a bit tiring, for a low budget series it is quite good.  I do not know how historically accurate it is.",1452211200,,212,4.146341463414634
8417557,5,B0046ZE3M6,Loved this show when first aired in New Zealand in the late 70's early 80's.  Must admit I had a huge crush on Jon English which lastest many years.  Was so pleased to find it on DVD and the story is just as watchable today as it was back then.,1447891200,,244,3.86
