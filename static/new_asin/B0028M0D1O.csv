8356390,5,B0028M0D1O,Very happy w/ it. See my review on his Standing submissions. Love all his dvd's covers a lot of stuff that others don't. SimpleEarth shattering throws. Baseball to double wrist throw flow awesome. Very street oriented. There will be no need for a ground game once eats the planet.,1420070400,,280,4.73469387755102
8356391,4,B0028M0D1O,"Snap no Tap Vol. #2 shows the viewer many different take downs and throws used in Cecchine's catch wrestling system. Most all of the takedowns come from folk or freestyle wrestling. The throws are from Greco-Roman wrestling. These are full blown, mano a mano, power shoots and throws that are easy to learn and retain. I found these shoots and throws were very different from Judo or Brazilian Ju-Jitsu. This DVD is a great supplement to any grappling martial art style, or as a stand-alone instructional.  Highly recommended.",1308441600,,526,4.9772727272727275
8356392,5,B0028M0D1O,"Tony Cecchine is a Catch Wrestling instructor, known for his revival of scientific wrestling and his bone snapping techniques. I've had the pleasure of speaking with Tony several times and he is a guy truly dedicated to his art. He's endured constant criticism for his brand of grappling, but has weathered it all to produce what I think is his best material yet.

Snap, No Tap! is the most brutal Cecchine product yet and for good reason..it deals with streetfighting. This isn't a DVD series you buy for clever sport techniques to apply at the gym (though, you may find some). This is series that literally bridges the gap between grappling in the gym and taking care of yourself in the street. I believe, unwittengly, that Cecchine and Paladin have released a ""catch wrestling"" set that should be owned by every grappler on the planet. If you are in Judo or Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, these discs will fill in gaps just not taught in the dojo.

In Volume 6 ""Ground Fighting"", I expected to see a variety of Cecchine's techniques repackaged and reshot for Paladin. Instead, what I found were clever strategies for street grappling and an approach to mindset training rarely seen in grappling. Going over weapons awareness and multiple attacker scenarios, Cecchine brings reality back to grappling. Just as many people watch Kung Fu movies and believe that's what they'll do if they are confronted on the street, Cecchine bursts the bubble of sport grapplers who think they are going to use their newest sport technique to end a streetfight. Cecchine does go over some catch wrestling stand by's with new and impressive instruction. Let me be very clear here, if you do grappling for self-defense, you must by this set. If you are scraping up pennies to buy your next instructional, buy Volume 6 if you can't afford the whole set. It's that good.

In Volume 2 ""Takedowns and Throws"", Cecchine demonstrates takedowns that are street-safe for you and brutally damaging for your opponent. The impressive thing for me in this set is how Cecchine cleary has a complete system. He is integrating striking, striking defense, throws/takedowns and ground fighting to present probably the best street fighting series Paladin Press has ever put out. Volume 2 is much more than a series of techniques, it also has extremely thorough explanations on why you should do one thing and not another. Believe it or not, this is fairly rare for instructional material. Usually it's a bunch of, ""ok, this is what you do if a guy does this"". Cecchine puts a whole fighting philosophy out there and shows that a lot of thought has went into keeping you in one piece. You will learn some great new takes on taking someone down and at the same time, gain more of Cecchine's masterful insight on how to approach a street encounter the right way.

Paladin Press has outdone themselves. I can't see how this set could be anything else but successful. Take it from someone who has seen a lot of instructionals, you haven't seen things that are taught on this set. Anyone, beginner or advanced, will benefit from this set. But I truly feel that every grappler out there should own this complete set. If you buy one set of instructionals this year, buy Tony Cecchine's ""Snap, No Tap!"".
