1005094,4,6305295522,"The movie was actually better than what I expected.  The story line was scary, but only due to the fact the it happens every day.  The story could have been stretched more though and Snider's performance was extremely  dull.  If it would have been a big Hollywood movie, it would have gotten  better reviews.  Tip to Snider:  next time you make a movie, leave yourself  out of it and pitch it to a bigger movie company.  The movie could have  been longer and a little more intelligent.",924307200,,485,4.471264367816092
1005095,5,6305295522,"I waited forver to see this movie, it was well worth it.  No let down here, but it is Dee Snider we are talking about, so you could figure that this movie was gonna be awesome.  The music is a great compliment to this  sick and twisted, yet wonderfully put together, soon to be a classic,  movie. This is the first true horror film that has come along in a long  time.  This is no SCREAM or I KNOW WHAT YOU DID...it is true horror,  something not seen since the 80's.  If you are a horror buff and have been  waiting for something that is truly worthy of being labeled HORROR, this is  it.  Man, you gotta see it to believe it.  From the hard-hitting soundtrack  to the stitches and scarification of one's body, STRANGELAND will make  you  squirm.  Parents can take a lesson from this movie, as can kids of all  ages.  Not a family flick, but someone out there may have a twisted  reality, so...better safe than sorry.  Put this on the gotta see list.  You  will not be let down.  I promise.",923184000,,991,4.237837837837838

1005225,5,6305295522,"In the hands of a better director this could have been a serious masterpiece. Dee Snider's script was original and for the most part believable because this is a story that could actually happen. Robert England's part was a credit to his skills as an actor. He has proved that he can put out a very good performance with the right character and right script. Kevin Gage and Bret Harrelson, sadly were miss cast. Kevin Gage's performance was rather on the lazy side as if he were stuck in a doctor's office waiting for a check up. Bret Harrelson was way over the top trying to be the cop Kevin Gage's character should have been. Brett Harrelson, was no where near believable in being the ""Bad Cop."" I found him to be a rather unlaughable and pathetic joke who doesn't have a shred of his big brother Woody (Harrelson) talent. Plus who was in desperate need for an orthodontist through the whole thing. Dee snider as writer/producer and key bad dude, Captain Howdy was a touch over the top, but still believable in his sinister and morally bankrupt persona that gave me the heebie jeebies. I found him to be worth of the Jason, Michael & Freddy Club. Even years later, this is STILL a very good movie that was sorely underrated and neglected. I would enjoy a special edition on blu ray with some cool special feature and maybe even a Dee Snider Cut Version. This is a good movie despite it's flaws and should be offered as a cult classic by the Shout Factory. Hopefully one of their employees may read this review one day and take it to heart and grant my wish.",1463011200,,1559,4.454545454545454

1005227,5,6305295522,"Powerful, intense and dark; this is a film about a Sadomasochistic serial killer known as Capt. Howdy, played by Dee Snider, who kidnaps teens and is taken to new fetishistic dark levels of torture in his torture death chambers of his house's basement.

Until he crosses the line by ending up kidnapping a cop's daughter. Now the cop is on a race against time to save his daughter from this sadistic man.

Will he save her in time? Will Capt. Howdy be truly rehabilitated in a later scene? Will Capt. Howdy find the answers in life and death through cathartic sadism and masochism in the search for a dark higher power? Does the cop survive the fight against Howdy?

Come in if you dare and watch the movie to find out! Also, check out an potential yet to be determined release of Strangeland 2. It's gonna get interesting if the movie will be released like they said they would.",1459382400,,879,4.515723270440252

1005229,4,6305295522,"Genevieve Gage and her best friend, Tiana Moore are your typical high school girls in Helverton, Colorado, looking for a good time outside of school. They usually spend their free time talking to strangers in online chatrooms. They come across one in particular who's online alias is Captain Howdy and invites them both to a house party he's having that night.

The 2 innocently go to the party but it turns out to be a trap as the 2 girls both find themselves trapped in the clutches of Captain Howdy himself; a sadistic tattooed freak of a man, with an unhealthy obsession for torturing his victims to death with multiple body/genital piercings. Genevieve and Tiana turn up missing and Genevieve's police detective father, Gage goes on the hunt for them, where he finds a body of one of Howdy's victims. Gage reluctantly enters Captain Howdy's sadomasochistic world of pain, pleasure, and body ""art"" and with a limited amount of time must retrieve Genevieve before she becomes Howdy's next human pin cushion

Overall: I was a bit skeptical about Strangeland at first, feeling it would be one of those over the top slasher films but it wasn't that bad. While there are certainly some extreme scenes here and there, Snider knew where to tow the line. In addition to the internet, tattoos and body piercings was becoming a major staple of teen pop culture in the late 90s so it was a clever move to capitalize on that and make a thriller film out of it. Dee Snider's role as the sadistic Captain Howdy was admirable. You can tell, while watching that he really absorbs the character and is having a great time portraying it. Not only is the Captain Howdy character, physically creepy, but his personality is as well. He darkly talks in philosophical sentences to justify his reasons for torturing his victims, believing the pain associated with body art is an art in and of itself. If there was a carnival for tattoo artists, Captain Howdy would be the clown. Seriously. The guy looks like a demented tattooed clown. Kevin Gage as police detective, Mike Gage does a decent performance but nothing too overly impressive. Robert Englund makes an appearance in this film as the father of one of the victims but his performance isn't too good. It's almost as if that particular role was out of his element. What's also good about this film is how it really tells the story of the dangers of teens talking to strangers on the internet--especially in this technologically advanced place in time compared to 1998. Overall, Strangeland has its moments that will have you shaking your head, but at the same time, it'll be just enough to keep you captivated.",1452470400,,2647,4.764705882352941

In Strangeland (1998) a guy who really loves piercings (Dee Snider) decides that he can help young people experience the spiritual rite-of-passage into adulthood, and become more enlightened in general, by kidnapping them and giving them extreme and unwanted piercings. This doesnt seem all that unreasonable, but those of us who have actually achieved adulthood know that you cant just go around giving people what you happen to think they need or deserve. However, nobody in this movie knows that, and later the townsfolk give Dee Snider what they figure he deserves, with grim yet rollicking results. This movie is hilarious and great in many ways, but clearly reaches its apex with the death-by-flaming-trousers part. Also, its Dee Snider. You know, from Twisted Sister. Not only that, there is a brief appearance by Robert LaSardo, who is a favourite of mine.

Also, it was filmed in Colorado Springs, and there are some distinctly recognizable bits. Ive been to New York, where youve seen every street corner before, in a movie, but its fun to see ones relatively obscure home city in the same light. Also, the old, original Village Inn restaurant stars as a kinky nightclub. Which is funny. Even more so, since it recently stopped being a restaurant and is now some sort of kinky nightclub, but of a different style.",1435881600,,1384,5.201793721973094

If you're not a TS fan,  you won't like it as much, because at its core,  it's low budget, and not extremely well done.",1416614400,,407,3.9753086419753085

1005623,3,6305295522,"I love horror movies, by no means am I a novice or a prude. I don't get scared by most mainstream stuff, but I'm mixed on this movie. Hence my 3 stars. It certainly scores through the roof on the scare and twisted scale, but personally, it was too close to my own comfort level for me to find the film enjoyable. There's certain things I personally don't want to see because I don't need it in my psyche.. This movie is one of them.. I like a story, not a torture show..but again, it's much more than just that, since it does have scares and suspense..

I know it's ""just a movie"", but 15 years after first seeing this on a demo tape sent by Artisan Ent., it's a film that's stayed with me...and that was the R-Rated  version, I could only imagine what was in the unrated edition. This movie is also the reason I don't meet strangers off of the net.. It came out at a time when AOL was at the height of it's popularity and meeting new friends was common...this was a huge cautionary tale..and it is still applicable today to such social sites like facebook, etc..

I'm surprised no one ever draws a parallel between this and the SAW movies..albeit, SAW was ultimately about revenge, where Strangeland is just about extreme sadistic pleasure by a twisted freak off his meds.. either way, StrangeLand is more gruesome and realistic; and while there are a lot of cheap hack fest movies out there which have a similar theme, this one also scores higher when it comes to the acting... So, while people talk about SAW being original and scary (the first one was), StrangeLand has never received it's proper acclaim, if even just for exposing the dangers of being so casual.. and stupid.. So for that, Dee Snider is brilliant.

Bottom line, I no longer own this movie, because I never want to be that freaked out again.. However, if you're looking for home run in the freak out dept, get this - it does it's job ten fold.. Just don't watch it alone .. Oh, and if a stranger on a on social media ever asks ""Do you want to go to a party?"" SAY NO! This movie just may save a life or two..",1395964800,,2078,4.32051282051282

1005773,1,6305295522,"(To be read in the voice Paul Lynde or Roger the Alien:)
So I was flipping through the channels and somewhere in the upper hundreds I found Strangeland. The Comcast description began ""Written, directed by, and starring Dee Snider"" and I didn't need to read any further. A vanity project by a washed-up hair metal drag queen? One star? I settled in with bottle of Chardonnay for the ride of lifetime. It was even better than I expected because the movie clearly didn't know how bad it was. Not a whiff of irony. Dee-dee stars as ""Captain Howdy,"" whose derangement is clearly indicated by the bad tribal tattoo of flames he had inked all over his body, like a Camaro a 15-year-old has pimped out with painted fire behind the wheels. Captain Howday lures teenage girls he meets online to his lair--Dee Snider's modest suburban house in LA, which he must rent out during daylight for high-end milf porn, because it looked strangely familiar--and then he... does things to them. (I'll leave that up to your imagination, like Deedee did in the film, since he didn't have much of a budget.) Well, the scariest thing about Captain Howdy's lair was the fire hazard posed by all the Hallmark scented candles he had burning in his basement so he could have enough light for his Satanic rituals. Actually he just sewed the actresses' mouths shut, which was a good thing too because I thought they would never shut up. It looked less painful than their acting. Eventually the townspeople get wise to Captain Howdy and decide to lynch him. They throw the noose over a branch that already was half sawed-through, and hang him. Then it starts raining and they loose interest and go home to watch football, leaving him suspended. When the branch breaks, he rises, and delivers his line, ""What a rush!"" He sets up a new lair in an abandoned church and proceeds to pick off the townspeople who hanged him. A hard-boiled cop whose girlfriend was abused by Mr. Howdy eventually finds him. Well, Twisted Sister ends up hanging from his own meat hook and set on fire by all the candles he had fetish for, and the whole church goes up in flames. I guess the tattoo was... ...foreshadowing. When you're flaming queen, Deedee, you gotta watch out that you don't set the scenery on fire. Move over, Tommy Wiseau, and make room. This is one for the ages.",1389916800,,2326,4.634382566585956

1005913,5,6305295522,"First things first: you cannot look at this movie as a mainstream ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Halloween""-style horror flick, you have to watch it as a cult classic...meaning you have to watch it more than once to like it, and eventually love it.

There is a theme behind the ritualistic violence of this movie, but I refuse to give a story outline except...a sociopath uses chat rooms to find teens to lure them to ""parties"" of rituals. Revenge and rituals are 2 key elements to the story which grows on you like hair (slowly but excellently).

I admire how this story does not really connect with any horror story i've ever heard of...and trust me, I know horror movies and feel I need to support this one due to the negative reactions of many people who are too stupid to realize that this movie is not a film you can just watch all alone...it's the kind of movie you have to watch with a group of friends (almost has a ""Rocky Horror"" feel to it  without any Rocky Horror at all).

Dee Snider, or Twisted Sister, decides to become an actor, and is cast as only he can be cast, as a lunatic.  He tortures naked people and fanatsizes about death.  It's set in Colorado, but he reminds me of people I knew when I lived in Wisconsin.

The movie is graphic and portrays death and occult in a way that is neither scary or really very entertaining, until Dee (Carlton) goes through rehab and is released back into society.  Then it gets entertaining.  The guy who played Freddy Krueger (Nightmare on Elm Street) is a drunk redneck (who also should have lived in Wisconsin), and some loud mouthed Bible thumping woman call for ""justice.""  They collaborate with several others to take Carlton out and hang him, but the branch breaks.  Because his meds have already been driven over, he reverts back to the monster who gets off on torturing naked people.

But now the tables are tuned and he takes Freddy Krueger and Bible thumper, strips them and places metal hooks in them, suspending them from various devices in his torture chamber.

But in the end the good cop saves the day and kills Carlton, the end of a bizarre crime spree and the end of a bizarre movie.  It is mildly entertaining, though chock full of bad acting.",1223596800,,1316,4.629310344827586

I decided to stop with my navel after seeing this!  He gets caught by a somewhat lame cop.  Lame, I say because he enters the twisted guy's house with no back-up, you can guess what happens.  Capt'n Howdy serves one year in a regular jail and about 3 years in a mental institution.  He comes out supposedly A-okay, but a bit nerdy and all his piercings and tatoos magically gone!  He returns to his house, told to take his meds and he'll be okay.  Well the town's people want revenge on him and the fun begins...  You really get a feeling for the mind of a dark and twisted serial killer.  However in this film, people get tortured and nobody gets killed, well, almost no one.  There are some scenes that make you even feel sorry for Capt'n Howdy!  I like horror films about serial killers, so this one interested me.  Besides that Dee Snyder was in it.  If you like heavy metal and Twisted Sister, you should like this one.

He gets caught, gets 'reformed' then people turn against him for what he did in the past and he goes nutty then tortures more people, etc, etc. I must say, I am fine with tattoos, piercings and whatever body modifications people are into but the lips sewn shut and people hanging by hooks in their skin was a little grusome. As far as the acting goes, it wasn't bad for a horror movie. Dee played a really good fugly looking tattooed psychopath and the victims were believable, a little too much so at times. If you are into bondage, S&M, heavy body modification/mutilation and movies about insane people then you will enjoy this movie. If any of this offends you, be prepared to run screaming and cover your eyes because parts of this movie are really gross! This IS NOT a movie for kids, not really appropriate even for teenagers, it's strictly for adults in my opinion. Also, this probably is NOT a good first date movie unless you want to scare them away! I must say, this movie was original and anything but predictable! For this I gave it an extra star.

It seemed very rushed & unfinished wich intern provides a ridiculous amount of plot holes. Most of the acting was alright but the lead Detective & his annoying partner were aweful(no grip what so ever on ther character's).

When I seen this movie was written, directed, and starring Dee Snider of the rock band Twisted Sister I was ready for a complete let down of a film.  The plot is relevant to our world today, but the acting and lacking script take away from the importance and  seriousness that something like this could happen at anytime.  Dee Snider's constant ""poetic sayings"" get old fast and his acting in the first and last parts of the movie are sub-par at best.  However, in the middle after he's been ""reformed"" he has a real quality to that part that makes you feel for him, so hats off to him for that.  Robert Englund (Nightmare on Elm St.) as a drunk redneck is quite entertaining and without a doubt some of the best acting of the movie, but that's not really saying much.  I also wished Linda Cardellini (Freaks and Geeks) would have had a more substantial role in the movie, but she played her small role well.  Another thing I liked about the movie was the music it had in it.  I love movies with great music, it add another dimension to the film.  If you are into metal and hardcore music then you might love this movie.  I have to say this movie was much better than I had expected, but I wouldn't say it is a ""modern horror classic"".

The fact that Amazon tries to bundle it with ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" must be some kind of joke! The dialogue and acting don't even rise to the standards of a made-for-TV movie. The cops don't look, talk, or act like cops, and the lead detective/protagonist works damn hard not to express any kind of personality (his only emotions appear to be boredom and irritation).

Also, though they try to sell this as a horror film, it isn't. This film doesn't even try to be scary. The first half is a boring, brainless detective story with robotic detectives tracking down a pretentious Buffalo Bill-esque sociopath (Dee Snider). In the second half, our psycho gets released from prison, apparently reformed, but after the townspeople try to lynch him he goes bad again and has to be put down for good.

What really makes this a waste of time is that our psycho isn't even a killer. He captures his victims and tortures them for a while. And the torture is nothing terribly gruesome, either. His idea of torture apparently doesn't go much further than sewing his victims' mouths shut and giving them unwanted piercings. Then the cops find them and haul them off to the hospital. The only victim he actually kills dies accidentally. This dung heap of a movie is just not scary, and not worth your time.",1148947200,7,1420,4.586614173228346

The rest of the other horror movies these days lack any creativity or fresh ideas; which sadly brings us to today's review. Hmmm, how to sum it up...... take a ounce of ""Ten to Midnight"" with Charles Bronson, a pinch of Clive Barkers ""Hellraiser', Two tablespoons of Buffalo Bill from ""Silence of the Lams"", then for flavor dump a pile of human excrement and there ya have it ( i might kindly add that the movies i just mentioned are tons better than Strangeland).

To complicated? OK here's the movie.. there is a guy who likes to take people and torture them, he takes a cops daughter, he gets caught, get released early from prison, goes back to his old ways, and is killed in the end by the father cop.  Wow complex plot huh? Is it so hard to come up with a fresh new idea? Do producers just assume that we the many horror fans are simply satisfied with a little blood and guts? Well here's a shocker for all you producers out there, many of us who pay money for these underwear stains you call movies, actually care for a plot and some kind of story that makes some sense. If you think for just a second you will find that almost every horror movie icon from Jason to Norman Bates had a reason why they did what they did, a very important ingredient to the mind behind the mad man. Sadly this movie like so many others these days lacked this ingredient, i mean geez would it kill someone to throw in a friggin flashback or something.

I'm terribly sorry for turning this into more of a rant than a review, but i feel the need to warn true horror fans like myself to steer clear of such pathetic cinematic attempts, and in a way i like to feel i help a little in giving a few alternative movies to watch that are better, and were more than likely the basis on which the movie reviewed was based on.

I won't say the movie was without any value whatsoever, for if you are interested in extreme body piercing and tattooing you might enjoy it. Sadly if you are like me and long for the days of creative ideas and the great horror of the 70's and 80's (i.e The Exorcist) you will feel sadly disappointed as Hollywood continues there endless pattern of rehashing and remixing old movies for a young generation (who haven't seen the older classics).

1005988,4,6305295522,"Cyber-predator and sadistic modern primitive Carleton Hendricks, A.K.A ""Captain Howdy"" {Dee Snider} captures a detective's teenage daughter 'Toni' and keeps her locked up in his candle-lit dungeon for S/M sensual pleasure. Enclosed in a body cage, her mouth is sewn shut as she witnesses the torture of others with various bloodily forced body-modification torments. A partially bright-red-headed and shaved Captain Howdy is tattooed from head to toe, reminiscent of Bali body art, and sports several piercings, seemingly everywhere that can be.

With the help of his partner and an internet savvy cohort, Detective Gage finds him 'chatting' in a teenage forum, as the trail keeps on getting hotter, leading him to an amusing club populated by the underground subculture. Like a cat batting around a mouse, Capt. Howdy teases Detective 'Kevin Gage' {Mike Gage}, until his dwelling is deciphered, daughter rescued, and Hendricks is apprehended.

In keeping with the musical story from Twisted Sister's ""Stay Hungry"", Hendricks is sentenced to a mental institution for the criminally insane, until ""recuperated"" and set free. Heavily-medicated and seemingly docile, he resembles more of a Forrest Gump now with facial markings covered in make-up, all in an effort to 'fit in' to 'vanilla' society. And all was going along just fine until a group of vigilantes headed by a 'Jackson Roth' {Robert Englund} subject him to some street justice, where he is beaten and hanged. But like a previous scene where he returned from the brink of death experiencing a hellish Near-death experience, he resurrects and resumes his sado-masochistic persona. And thus, seeking vengeance, manages to capture Roth after a necromantic dance sequence, as well as a boisterous lady who persecuted him. Both are remanded to Howdy's sexual torture devices, driving them insane in the process. He keeps them alive and suffering, rather than killing them, where his influence is felt for the rest of their lives.

To his mortification, Gage finds a live video stream playing through his laptop, wherein Howdy delivers another one of his philosophical rants, holding a sobbing Toni again. Once more they confront eachother for the final battle.

Dee Snider's brainchild comes alive in Strangeland, and is relatively well done, despite the rather bland acting, although the ideas make for a great B-grade cult horror movie. Now if only King Diamond would follow suit...",1128038400,12,2438,5.324675324675325

1005990,4,6305295522,"The horror genre has introduced us to many memorable icons; Freddy, Jason, Pinhead, Leatherface and countless more.  Some of these ghouls are scarier than others and some are really not scary at all, but rather comedic and foolish.  If you've never seen ""Strangeland"" you've probably never heard of ""Captain Howdy"" which would be a shame because they don't come any scarier than this dude.  His methods of torture and reasonings for his attacks had me squirming in my seat the whole time.  Somebody give this man a franchise!

""Stangeland"" opens up with two young women sitting in front of a computer screen and chatting up guys in an internet room.  They become intrigued by a guy with the user name ""Captain Howdy"" who claims to lead a wild life and know what fun is all about.  When Howdy writes the line ""Wanna come to a party?"" the girls go to his place and soon find themselves trapped in his underground basement of torture.  One of the girls is the daughter of a police detective who will do whatever it takes to get her back safely before Howdy gets to sink another one of his patented hooks into her...

I find critiquing Strangeland as a horror movie to be twofold.  The positives are the unique style and imagery scenes of things like goth clubs, torture chambers, Captain Howdy's appearance, a man of countless tattoos and piercings, all of it to the boom of a great heavy metal soundtrack.  If you're a fan of this culture like I am then you will really enjoy this movie.  On the negative side this film can appear downright amateurish at times, especially with its plot and awkward dialogue scenes with none too impressive actors.  In other words a film of style over substance all the way.  And of course it hasn't exactly aged very well, being a movie where ""The Web"" and chatrooms are portrayed as being cutting-edge.

But the real reason to watch this film is for Captain Howdy.  Imagine a violent and twice as muscular Marilyn Manson with an insane glare in his eyes and you will get a good idea.  Howdy's life revolves around the ultimate pursuit of pain as pleasure inflicted both upon himself and onto others.  He fears nobody and nothing, not even death, as pain inflicted upon him gives him a rush.  This guy is way more deranged than the usual horror movie villain.  Sure, it's got its bad moments however if you like horror movies and goth/freak culture I would recommend you give this one a try but caution: it just might make you reconsider that nose piercing you've wanted so much...",1106956800,16,2513,4.617117117117117

Some of the characters were amusing (Freddy Kuger as a redneck, fountain of knowledge tow truck driver and the bible thumping woman) but not so for the underlying menace of the movie.  It wasn't an over-the-top gore fest but nasty all the same.  The mutilation of the victims was horrorific and the story had some depth if you care to reach (true purpose of body modification, issue of insanity and medicated sanity, etc.) and despite some holes - a watchable film that could have been much better given more time (as in running longer than 90 mins.) and a tighter script.",1088640000,,899,4.737179487179487

Carleton Hendricks, aka Captain Howdy, (played by Dee Snyder) is a twisted fiend obsessed with finding a higher spiritual plain through piercings, tattoos...and torture.  He doesn't wish for the death of his victims, he wishes for his own death, which makes him a nasty antagonist indeed.
When Captain Howdy lures young Genny Gage into his lair, it seems he has selected the wrong victim, for Genny's father Mike (played by Kevin Gage) is a police detective.  Mike hunts down Captain Howdy and rescues his daughter, but Howdy is insane and gets sent to an asylum rather than prison.
Without giving too much away, the movie will go on to question whether the beast inside can be contained, or whether it is just held behind the bars of medicine.  Another very interesting dilemma brought to light, is whether or not it is a crime to ignore a crime; and what would the consequences be for you if you did.
Although the movie is a little bit flat in some facets such as dialogue and some weak plot smatterings, overall it is richly filmed and well acted.  Kevin Gage, Robert Englund, and Elizabeth Pena hold up the cast with skill, and Snyder does a rather decent job himself; especially as the psychotic Capt Howdy half of Carleton Hendricks.  Look for a brief but well done job by pretty girl Amy Smart. (Road Trip)
Rather than compare this movie to Silence of the Lambs, I would say it was closer to The Cell (but with better acting), or perhaps the original Manhunter, in that it gives us a brief glimpse of the lamb inside the wolf.
As for the horror, the movie makes up for its lack of blood by terrifying us with an unwelcome and horrifyingly disgusting buffalo shot of Robert Englund in his underwear.  That alone made me toss my lunch harder than any brain eating scene could have done.
If you like creepy horror villains, scenes of torture, and a glimpse into the psychotic all set to a heavy metal soundtrack, then you will probably like this movie.  Watch for Captain Howdy's full size puppet scene!  Enjoy!",1084838400,14,2230,4.568922305764411

  the movie is ninety minutes long and is quite fast paced, maybe too fast paced judging by some of the reviews here.  i was quite shocked to see people did not like this.  taking the computer and the internet and making a modern day horror in the vein of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was a stroke of genius.  Dee Snider was working on this since 1984's STAY HUNGRY.  it was the birth of his daughter (and the fear he cannot protect her) that inspired him to write ""Horror-teria"" (on STAY HUNGRY)  which  consisted of the songs ""CAPT HOWDY"" and ""STREET JUSTICE""
  The movie is quite graphic at times but i think kids need to see that so they are aware that of the dangers of the internet.  this is one of the most frightening movies i have ever watched because it could happen.  it is not too far from reality.  i find some of this movie quite realistic.  i can explain jason of friday the 13th and halloween away to my kids as ""just a movie"" but this one is so real at times, it is a little harder to brush off.

It all began when Dee Snider, of the Twisted Sister fame, wanted to make a unique and actually scary horror movie.  I would say that he reached his goal.  He brings the story into modern day society by using the internet chatrooms as a way to lure in his victims.  Here is where the story takes a twist.  Normally, the killer would just kill his victims but not Captain Howdy.  He lures them to his house where he pierces, scars, and tortures them until they die from the shock and pain.  He also stitches their eyes and mouths shut.  There are some very graphic scenes in this movie, and that's what makes it so scary.  This could very easily be reality.  Someone could be out there doing this right now. There are also a couple of twists in the movie.  For example, Captain Howdy tries to become part of normal society but as you will see, this just doesn't work.

Well, first off, there was virtually no blood, so gore hounds might not be interested in it. But it does have several squeamish scenes which could make some viewers cringe. Oh well, shouldn't of rented it.:)
Setting this movie in today's modern era was a plus. Using the chatroom environment was relatively a good idea. Every parents worse nightmare could of been Dee Snider in the flesh
The plot is this: A maniac uses a chatroom to lure kids to his home where he can physically torture them. Not a bad idea. Things go wrong when he kidnaps the daughter of a detective. There is actually only two deaths in the movie. One was ""accidental"" but it helped aid in the sick habits of CaptHowdy (Dee Snider).

Great direction and an eerie storyline make this an outstanding choice for the horror lover (such as myself) or someone just looking for a good scary movie for a Saturday night. A WORD OF WARNING: there are some scenes that may be very disturbing to some viewers. I personally think that the movie would not have been done justice by omitting or sugar-coating them, but that's just the opinion of a long-time horror fan! I would advise watching it in the dark with several friends (the more the merrier)...Enjoy!",1012608000,,769,4.565217391304348

1006114,4,6305295522,"This film was written, co-produced and co-stars Dee Snider, who has to be commended for his efforts. From a distance, this seems like another teen explotation film. But it's not. The teenagers aren't primping bimbo's destined to be slaughtered, the cops aren't bumbling idiots, and the bad guy is neither immortal, or superhuman. Simply a deranged psychopath (well played by a very intimidating Snider).
I can't praise this film as much as some others have, but the reviewer who hated this film really missed the point, and probably dislikes most all films of this genre. Virtually no one is killed in this film, any nudity shown is in a cursory manner, not for exploitation. And while Snider is a ""co-star"", and I imagine many teens found his performance inspiring, only a sick minded individual would aspire to be like his character in this film. The concept is anything but another teen slaughterhouse, and quite original, and well thought out.
Bottom line: Fans of the horror genre will be plesantly surprised by this film. And I imagine fans of Snider, Twisted Sister, or Metalheads will probably love it. It's too bad the film didn't reach a larger audience.",1007596800,2,1164,4.913705583756345

They just want to be cold tripe like Texas Chainsaw and other shock/exploitation films.  We need less and less of these types of films. Do something better with your time and intelligence. Please!.

It had all the elements of classic horror as well as the psychological effects of films like Silence Of The Lambs and Seven. The Cyber-predator/Modern Primitive Captain Howdy is the Freddy Kruger for the new millenium. The character has what it takes to be the next big horror icon.  This movie definetly has the potential to become a cult classic. I can't wait for the sequel STRANGELAND 2 : THE CULT OF PERSONALITY to come out, so I can see the further adventures of the Goulish Captain Howdy.  In closing, if your into old school horror in the vain of A Nightmare On Elm Street and Hellraiser as well as films like Seven and The Silence Of The Lambs and aretired of those trendy garbage imitation horror movies like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer - than this film is for you.",997142400,,908,4.463855421686747

I do admit that some of you may think some scenes are a bit disturbing, and it's all about torture, but if your anything like me, you'll love it!

I thought the movie was o.k..  It had the potential to be a really good movie but the acting was not very good and I found a few plot holes.  For example, the scene where the detective found Captain Howdy's position only based on the fact that he heard a dog bark.  It is also pretty unbelievable that Dee's character could have been hung in a tree for that long and not died.  Anyway, other than that the movie is great.  It is about gothic metal culture and that is what I like.  There are a few stereotypes like the name of the club, and that all heavy metal listeners are obsessed with death.  I enjoyed the soundtrack promo.  I have never seen a DVD with 3 music videos on it.  I was very pleased with the soundtrack...

Just the fact that someone could think something like this up is disturbing in itself, but they also added to it by casting Dee Snider to play the pyschopath Captain Howdy. He played the bad guy perfectly, but I actually wouldn't consider Captain Howdy to be a bad guy. He was a victim of an unforgiving society, plain and simple.

All of the dialogue is so contrived it's embarassing, cringe-worthy. There are so many inconsistencies I am left wondering if I got the full movie - it views as if about an hour was cut from it. Anyone who recommends this has either never seen a decent movie of this genre before and has nothing to compare it to, or is doing so on the basis of hype alone. I don't care how cool the soundtrack is (and that's another thing - ... I am positive Soulfly would not endorse this kind of exploitative rubbish), i don't care how cool the cover is, or who made it, or the advertising campaign. This movie is mindless rubbish.

1006158,3,6305295522,"This film had some really neat aspects to it.  Meeting online 'teen' buddies and going to their places for parties.
Captain Howdy (Dee Snider)  plays a body pierced nut who lures teens to his house where he does all  kinds of dastardly deeds to them.
Interesting premise, but Snider's  dialogue was so mundane that it bordered on the silly.  After a while you  couldn't tell whether Mr. Snider wanted the character taken as a serious  crackpot, or more of a satan worshipper.  Overall I thought that the  similarity between his character and Sammy Curr from the film Trick Or  Treat was just too much.  Out of all the quotes and other lines he spewed  off, only one I thought was quite neat.  ""Your childhood ended the  moment you knew you would die.""
I would only recommend this film to  fans of anything horror related (or those that like stories about  computers) like other average films like Wishmaster and stuff like that.",966297600,2,928,4.670807453416149

Not only was  Strangeland chilling in the way that every horror movie is, but even more  so is the sad, scary truth that it really happens to people. I wish more  thriller/horror films were made for this reason, to make people think, to  make them aware that there are dangers in this world that we don't think  of, yet are everywhere... just a click away! What's frightening is that  this kind of danger is so commonplace, and it can be right at our  fingertips.",965520000,,589,4.542857142857143

It could be the fact that I was alone, or just that it really is a truly terrifying movie.  Nonetheless, the fact that a film  is scary does not exactly mean it is good movie.  The best way I could  think to describe this movie is to think of an extremely sadistic, violent  version of ""Silence of the Lambs"".  Granted, most of the violence  in the film is offscreen, it still makes you shiver to think of the sick,  twisted torture the killer's victims are put through.  I call him a killer,  yet he really didn't kill anyone.  One victim died of cardiac arrest  (basically being scared to death), but the others he merely tortured to no  end.  One of the most terrifying things about this film is fact that this  could really happen, and maybe even does.  Putting yourself in the position  of the victims alone is enough to give you nightmares for weeks.  I guess I  should add a little plot summary for all readers wondering:  a sick, grunk  pyscho (the guy from Twisted Sister) is luring in young teenagers over the  internet by asking if they ""wanna come to a party?"".  Those who  make the mistake of accepting his invitation are brought into his house of  horrors and tortured...",961459200,2,1282,4.4847161572052405
1006161,4,6305295522,"I bought this movie for two reasons - one, it's by Dee Snider of Twisted  Sister fame, who happens to be one of my favourite musical artists of all  time. Second, it's a horror of a nature which appeals to me. I'm a geek and  any net-related things usually pique some interest in me.
The Dee Snider  fan in me wasn't disappointed at having bought it, but the horror fan in me  was.
It's good, don't get me wrong, but I think that because it was  packed into 90 short minutes, Snider had to make a few adjustments to the  script. The movie is way too short for what it's trying to portray. That's  why there are a few coincidences, obvious cheese and not so subtle force  feeding of the plot to viewers and cast alike.
If this was a miniseries,  it would have completely rocked. The fact that Snider still pulled it off  in the 90 minute timeframe still astounds me. Not many amateur  writer-directors would have. Although he's been playing with this story in  his mind since Stay Hungry was released in 1984, he's still new to making  movies.
It's a job very well done and I only hope that it is released in  the future as a mini series or full TV series. That is the only way to give  it justice.
Being a TV series would also open it up to a broader  audience who feel that a ""cheesy"" horror isn't their thing.",961286400,2,1311,4.242914979757085
1006183,5,6305295522,"This movie is a great Work. From the beginning to the End I was fascinated by Dee Snider playing Captain Howdy. His performace matches up with Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs, although it wouldn't be fair to compare  these two movies. The development of the Movie is really unexpected-  sometimes you really can't deceide what side you're on, because Captain  Howdy's second Tour of Pain is basically caused by what the People made of  him. It really makes you think and this is what lacks most of the  horror/psyco films. Dee Snider's Soundtrack also rules, check out the  Videos at the End of the Movie, you will love it. Robert Englund also gives  a great performance as utter Redneck scum and makes you want to encourage  Captain Howdy for having a little session with him.

Neither is really true. Dee Snider's attempt at movie-making really could have been excellent. There  aren't many horror films that attempt to produce empathy with the villain.  In fact, Strangeland really surprised me with the whole lynch-mob attacks  misunderstood figure scene. If the film had focused more on the  relationship between the media and the mentally ill, Strangeland might have  been quite the film.
Unfortunately, Dee Snider decided that this movie  also needs a maniac torturing innocents while spouting off like Charles  Manson on blow. Captain Howdy comes off more as a raving nut than a  misunderstood schizophrenic. The silly one-dimensional characters  (including a cop that basically asks an on-line Howdy ""Where are  you?"" as if he expects a correct answer) don't add much to the insipid  nature of Strangeland.

If you have  teenagers with a computer this is a movie to get so they can see the black  side of talking with people on line and meeting them.

I bought it not knowing who Dee Snider was, which is a good  thing, because I am not much of a hardrock fan --I probably would have  missed out on it if I had known he was Twisted Sister's lead singer. I  understand it is Mr. Snider's first filmscrip and first major starring  role.  The things mentioned in the first line of this review may come from  the fact that it is his first script, but as an actor, displaying two  totally different sides of the Bad Guy,  he is wonderfully brilliant, and  he adds a third dimension to what might easily have been a flat comic book  character if handled differently.
The story and script obviously do NOT  come from a twisted mind (as is too easy to say for those who don't like  the film) but from the concerns of a father who sees terrifying things  happening in the world around him. The film moved me enormously and made an  enormous impact, in spite of the things I mentioned earlier. Or could it  even be (partly) because of them....... The society today is full of  illogical things happening, weird justice and the truth is so often a lot  more rediculous than fiction, so in a way what could be seen as flaws could  also be seen as wonderful metaphors (although i doubt this was the original  idea).
After the film had ended I did what I NEVER did before: i  IMMEDIATELY watched it again, now with Mr. Sniders commentary on. And much  to my surprise this was so ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!! Contrary to earlier  reviews, I think Dee adds a lot of extra info and unfolds himself as a very  intelligent guy widening his talents into other fields, being able to tell  about it with enthousiasm (and a lot of humor I may add) and making me even  more positive about the film than I already was. Also, he seems to be very  pleased with himself, and that only adds to the fun!! The Rock Videos from  the soundtrack album that are added as extras are not much to my taste, but  the introductions by Dee Snider are so enjoying I actually had a lot of fun  watching them (and carefully changed my mind, no matter how slightly, about  this music genre).
Watch it, watch it again and then watch it with the  commentary on. And try to keep an open mind. Too many four or five star  hollywood films of directors and writers and stars that have 'made it' are  full of rediculous flaws and illogicalities as well, but for some unknown  reason they are accepted by critics and public alike. Strangeland has the  added bonus of the fact that it comes from the heart and is made for all  the right reasons instead of being taylored to as large an audience as  possible.
