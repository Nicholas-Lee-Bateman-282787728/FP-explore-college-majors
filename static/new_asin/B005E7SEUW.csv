8467911,4,B005E7SEUW,"Whole series, good price for this classic collection. Great memories",1488499200,,68,5.9
8467912,5,B005E7SEUW,"Item arrived very well packaged and very promptly; I will no longer have to wait interminably for these movies to be broadcast on cable. Dirk Bogarde and James Robertson Justice were bright light for me and I recall vividly how they and all of the supporting cast brightened my days in post war London. Somehow their hi-jinx made the bombsites which had not, even in 1954, all been eradicated. There was a smell in the air back then that is there no longer but comes back to me by virtue of my memory, each time I watch any of the ""Doctor..."" movies.",1459036800,,550,4.401960784313726
8467913,5,B005E7SEUW,So much fun from the past,1452902400,,25,3.3333333333333335
8467914,5,B005E7SEUW,"Excellent! You can't beat Dirk Bogarde or British comedies from the 40s-60s. The Doctor series was wonderful. And when I got it, the price was good too.",1445040000,,152,4.666666666666667
8467915,4,B005E7SEUW,"This is a collection of the old original set of movies.  I did smile several times during the films, but I used to get lots of belly laughs from the TV shows.  Compared to the TV series, I found the movies rather tame.  (Let's hope ""they"" put the complete TV set on DVD some day.)",1396915200,5,280,4.054545454545455
8467916,4,B005E7SEUW,You are either a fan or not of these rather dated English humour classics. To me they are now past their sell by date but for many they will still have you laughing in the aisles!,1378166400,3,179,4.0
8467917,5,B005E7SEUW,"Funny movies, brought back some fond memories and had a good laugh.  Well worth buying, can enjoy over and over.",1374969600,,112,4.6
8467918,4,B005E7SEUW,"One thing that must be kept in mind when purchasing is the CODE.

Australia is code 4 so the only way the discs are able to be played in this country is via a computer.",1371513600,4,168,3.8
8467919,4,B005E7SEUW,I remember these movies from the late 1950's early 1960's. I enjoyed them then and it was a pleasure to see them again. I expect they would be thought of as being very corny by todays standards but they furnished me with hours of good memories.,1364774400,6,244,4.326086956521739
