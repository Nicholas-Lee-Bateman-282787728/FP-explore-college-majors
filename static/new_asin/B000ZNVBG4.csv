This color movie is the ""true story"" of the Reno Brothers. Clint was a respected farmer. Frank, Simeon, John, and Bill were the first train robbers in American history. Their looting, burning and killing set the pattern for the great outlaw bands that followed (James, Youngers, and Daltons). The story begins in 1866 southern Indiana. A farm wagon drawn by four horses contains the Reno brothers. A man on a hill sends a signal, the townsmen expect the robbers. ""The Renos are coming!"" Will they suspect something? ""Its too quiet."" Frank decides to act. ""It's a trap!"" The townsmen ride after the gang. The Reno gang finds a refuge in Jackson county. [Note the table manners of the brothers, and their well-furnished dining table!] Laura offers advice. ""How did they know?"" Clint offers advice too.

The townspeople complain about their elected officials, but can do little in Seymour Indiana. The brothers wonder who was the informer. They tell a story to the bartender, he is new in town. Is Murphy a Pinkerton man? The Reno's take revenge. In Chicago the Pinkerton Agency has a new man to take on the Reno gang. There is a reported train robbery in the newspapers. Jim Barlow shops at a store, and flashes big bills. He meets Laura Reno, then two men. That $100 bill was part of the loot. The law goes to see Barlow and take him in. Barlow says he found the money, and wants to see the Judge. Barlow confides in the Judge, he is a practical man. They take the bait. Will they put Barlow on the Davies county job?

Barlow rides with the Reno gang across the state line to Missouri. They enter the courthouse for the Treasurer's Office, then leave with the loot. They will split up to avoid notice. Barlow sends a message to the Pinkerton's in Chicago. A traveling pedlar brings a message for a meeting. Barlow will bait a trap for the guilty. The train arrives. The Sheriff and his men are ready. Barlow stops the train. When the money box is dropped the lawmen act. Shots are fired, men are hit, some are captured. The people of Seymour demonstrate against country officials. Then people decide to eliminate the Reno gang.

Who is shooting at Barlow? Laura is sorrowful. Barlow is told of the townsmen actions. They attack the jail, imprison the sheriff, grab the Reno brothers, and pass judgment. Barlow can do nothing. The leaders are recognized, but they won't talk. ""I'm sorry Laura, I tried."" Will there be a happy ending for Laura and Jim?

This movie was filmed in Columbia Historic State Park. Does it look like southern Indiana? Randolph Scott looks a little too old in this movie. The pistols used were not around in the 1860s, they used cap-and-ball, not modern cartridges. This story was written by Frank Gruber, who wrote many novels and stories for television and the movies.",1395964800,,2838,4.668
