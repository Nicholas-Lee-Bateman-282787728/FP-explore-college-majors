6248211,2,B00I3KXWGI,"Disappointing and I'm a huge Bugliosi fan....loved his book Outrage but this is repetitive and boring with not enough trial clips. Also, it wasn't remastered for DVD; the quality of the video is poor and even has strait ions from the VHS it was copied from.",1405555200,9,257,4.608695652173913
6248212,1,B00I3KXWGI,Boring and nothing but a big ad for his book. Everyone knows OJ was guilty anyway except the idiots on his jury. Don't waste your time or money.,1401494400,,144,4.178571428571429
6248213,5,B00I3KXWGI,"Great video, very informative.  I liked the additional court room coverage and the way the information was presented.  Good buy.",1399766400,,128,5.35
6248214,5,B00I3KXWGI,"This professionally done DVD exceeded all my expectations! It was compelling and convincing from the first minute to the last. The detailed information, riveting interviews and expertise conclusions really made it an educational and entertaining viewing opportunity. This is a must see for anyone who truly wants to understand the whole OJ story.",1399420800,9,346,5.547169811320755
6248215,5,B00I3KXWGI,"I have to admit I had my doubts, but the video says it all. O.J.Simpson is guilty! A must buy if you ask me.",1398038400,,108,3.5416666666666665
6248216,5,B00I3KXWGI,"This is the most complete, accurate report on the OJ Simpson trial I have ever seen. The interviews with those who handled the ""trial of the century"" were compelling. The mock trial by the legendary Vincent Bugliosi was how this trial should have been conducted. I remember where I was when the verdict was announced and could not believe what was happening to our justice system! This video should not only be in EVERY person's own video library but the story needs to be preserved so posterity can know how our legal system can be manipulated to let a killer get away with murder.",1398038400,2,582,4.605769230769231
6248217,4,B00I3KXWGI,"Well researched, fascinating, and exposes the truth about the inadequacies present in our legal system.",1453248000,,103,5.933333333333334
6248218,5,B00I3KXWGI,"This is the best analysis ever done on the OJ Simpson trial.  Everyone knows he was guilty but people couldn't quite put their finger on how he was able to skate away with a smile on his face.  We have none other than one of the greatest prosecutor's of all time, Vincent Bugliosi, dissecting the trial for us and then giving us about four hours of the kind of closing argument he would have delivered to put Simpson on Death Row where he belonged.",1431993600,2,448,4.321428571428571
6248219,4,B00I3KXWGI,"While the content was fantastic and all around a great video, I had to remove one star for the transfer from video to DVD. It's a very poor transfer and, therefore, made this DVD only slightly hard to watch as it appeared blurry throughout. Overall, I would recommend it, though.",1426982400,4,279,4.6
6248220,5,B00I3KXWGI,Good dvd set cheap also!,1425340800,,24,4.0
6248221,1,B00I3KXWGI,"I think that anyone who watched the trial of O.J. Simpson and saw all the so-called evidence against him, cannot possibly think that he committed
the crime.  I could name each and every one of them.  Also, first of all, the police department didn't  even consider any other prospects but O.J.
He was cuffed as soon as he got off the plane from Chicago.  How in the world could a 48 year old man with a messed up knee do those crimes?
Also, Black men do not like blood... cutting is not a choice of Black people!  Let's focus on the truth and not our racial biases!",1420416000,4,564,4.233644859813084
6248222,5,B00I3KXWGI,"Of course most of us know without a doubt that Simpson killed his wife with pre- meditation.  That is glaringly obvious to anyone who can add 2 and 2 and come up with 4.  What  Bugliosi does is to stunningly show how a real lawyer should have prosecuted the killer and presented the evidence.  In presenting a lot of facts in the case (many,I'd never heard and many things never presented), I am even more convinced that the prosecutors were either inept, lazy, or perhaps just self serving in their motives.  Everyone from the judge on down seem to be on an ego trip with sugar plumb dreams of becoming millionaires.  Bottom line.... this is well with the time to watch.",1419033600,2,671,4.5041322314049586
6248223,5,B00I3KXWGI,Excellent! Wonderful interviews and information that's never been released to the public. It's worth it for Vince Bugliosi's summation if nothing else.,1417737600,,151,5.909090909090909
6248224,3,B00I3KXWGI,"O.J. Simpson Absolutely 100% Guilty Trial DVD Video

""If you don't agree that OJ was guilty after watching these videos, we'll refund your money.""
This offer tells me it is another propaganda movie that hides the real truth about the murders.
My reason, experience (from True Crime), and intelligence tells me these items:
1) Who really killed Ron G. and Nicole.
2) What the crime was all about.
3) Why the deaths of two unknown persons got so much publicity.

#3 It got so much publicity to make people forget about the more serious news from May, the threat of war or perhaps nuclear war. Don't remember? The propaganda in the Corporate Media did its job. The ""National Association of Editors and Publishers"" in Washington DC continues to control the news.

#2 The crime was about an attempted murder of Nicole's boyfriend, the restaurant manager. That is why they NEVER published his picture. Since Ron and Keith were about 5'9"" and 175 lbs. it was an obvious case of mistaken identification by two men who used a knife to kill quickly and silently.

#1 This murder was ordered by organized crime to get rid of Keith (the restaurant manager).
Restaurants and health clubs are often venues for drug dealing and prostitution. Read ""Killing Time"" for more information about this. I think Keith was not questioned by the police about the death of Nicole because his activities were known to the police. I suspect Keith was close to Nicole to be informed about the activities of her ex-husband, and Kato was used to convey information between OJ and Nicole.
Why did Nicole pick a drug user as a roommate? The answer should be obvious.

OJ has a good alibi, he was on the way to the airport after 11 pm. What about that black bag? Kato and the limo driver saw it, OJ denied having it! I suspect it contained a substance that was very valuable and very illegal that was being carried to Chicago. Is Los Angeles the cocaine capital of the west coast?

The book ""Killing Time"" by Freed and Briggs is still the one best book on this case. The authors were not involved with either the prosecution or the defense.",1411344000,,2105,4.630026809651475
6248225,4,B00I3KXWGI,"I like it but its really good for any law student who was born after June 12, 1994.  I was 10 years old then & watched most of the trial & realized at 10 a killer was on the lose.  Nonetheless, Vincent Bugliosi (Manson's prosecutor) narrates and tells the trial and although that is somewhat boring- you have to really pay attention. (& try to stay awake).  He gives great details.  Some clips of the trial yet not enough are shown in this documentary.  Interviews with people, LAPD, investigators and even perhaps 1 moron juror.

Its good..  Specific & gives a lot of information.

I also really like the music playing.",1409961600,2,620,4.5225225225225225

8638676,5,B00I3KXWGI,"Although I had watched the original trial of the OJ Simpson case, I found the documentary to be very insightful and answer some nagging questions from the trial. Well worth your time!",1455753600,,183,4.75
8638677,5,B00I3KXWGI,"Maybe it's because of Netflix Making of a Murderer, but I'm super enthralled with this trial stuff lately and this was just as captivating for me. Love this stuff!",1455753600,,163,4.655172413793103
8638678,5,B00I3KXWGI,I bought this DVD because I have been watching the OJ Simpson show on FX. Watching the DVD makes the show on FX more interesting. Loved the DVD. I am gonna rewatch it again!,1455667200,,173,4.117647058823529
8638679,5,B00I3KXWGI,Absolutely great! Very interesting comparing it to the FX show. IT IS A MUST SEE!,1455494400,,81,4.466666666666667

8638681,4,B00I3KXWGI,"I haven't quite finished the six discs included in the set, but I must say that this set has sated my curiosity about all facets of the OJ Simpson trial.  I was living  in LA at the time of the crime and the trial, and trust me, it was one of the most disturbing events of the last century.....but it set the stage for so much that we take for granted today.  We have domestic violence legistation and domestic violence response teams.....training for the police in response to these calls, and a huge decrease in corruption within the LAPD.  This crime and the trial opened our eyes to all kinds of things. Plus it came on the heels of the LA riots.

These tapes are a lot to get through. Hours of information - coming mostly from the outstanding prosecutor of Charles Manson, Vincent Bugliosi.  He points out how the system failed society in almost all ways in the prosecution of the incredibly overwhelming evidence.  It is not easy to listen to at times, and there is a lot of information....but  you will come away with a great understanding of how the justice system let us down, and it was spearheaded by the ineffectual District Attorney's prosecutors.  There was a huge divide within the team....the DA's office ignored the LAPD and their experts...and the result was total apathy.  Apathy divided the country and broke the spiritual and moral fiber of citizens who believed in the justice system.",1453334400,2,1406,4.65587044534413
