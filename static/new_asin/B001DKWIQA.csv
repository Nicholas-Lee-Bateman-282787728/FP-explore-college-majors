He covers them and gives you the points to work on. From Interruptions, to Desires, to Goals, as much as can be covered in a one hour presentation, it's all here. A good start and a perfect way to present the topic of Time Management to a group.",1264291200,,410,4.708333333333333
8294022,5,B001DKWIQA,"I have watched over 50 educational videos similar to this video, and I was blown away by Rendall's videos.  He is an engaging public speaker.  I teach public speaking, so I can tell the difference between a good speaker and a bad speaker, and Rendall just has it.  He uses humor effectively, and makes learning the material fun.  He uses real life examples, which helps to tie into the material, and helps viewers relate.  His videos are to-the-point and he doesn't waste your time.  We all live busy lives, but if you are willing to take an hour out of your day to watch an educational and motivational video, I would say, go with David Rendall's you will not be disappointed.",1251072000,4,677,4.553719008264463
