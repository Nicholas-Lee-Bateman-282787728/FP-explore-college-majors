8572003,5,B00BOYLOJM,"Excellent documentary.  I am writing this after watching both parts 1 and 2.  The documentary gives both an insightful analysis of the philosophy of socialism as well as an engaging narrative of how it played out in various regions around the world (USSR, UK, Israel, Tanzania, etc.)  Philosophically, the attraction to socialism is that it provides a basic humane standard of living - guaranteed for all people regardless of their life circumstances.  This philosophy is extremely powerful in places where the poor live extremely harsh lives and the rich are very powerful and living in high opulence.  The problem has always been the inefficiency built into the system: if those who work hard don't receive much more of a reward than those who don't work at all, then their incentives to be productive is severely diminished.  If the government runs an industry, it does not have nearly the same incentive to control costs and to make sure that the services it is providing are valued has highly as the resources it consumes in order to provide them.  Also, elements of abuses of human rights and authoritarianism are discussed in certain socialists systems (e.g. China under Mao).  Well worth watching.",1435622400,4,1205,5.0201005025125625
8572004,2,B00BOYLOJM,"[p.s. I initially wrote this as a review of the 3 hour series...which I absolutely
could not recommend at $14.99. Now I realize that Amazon is trying to sell
EACH flawed hour for that...making this inadequate series an insane $45.]

Okay, I should have been smarter: I sat down hoping/expecting to see
a reasonable, thoughtful examination of the history of Socialism.

Since I constantly hear ""socialism"" used essentially as an epithet in the U.S.
--despite the lack of any worthwhile agreed-upon working definition of the term--
I sincerely hoped to learn something.

My first clue that something was very wrong, was that the intro was by Ben Wattenberg.
Now, I like and respect BW, but anyone who knows anything about his politics
knows that he's absolutely not the guy to give you an objective treatment of socialism,
an institution he hates. It would be like a Raiders fan making a YouTube video
about my San Diego Chargers. Or Paul Krugman doing 3 excruciating hours on supply-side economics.

Further, the 3 hour series is based on a book by fellow hard-core neo-conservative
Joshua Muravchik. I'm not as familiar with him, but I'm guessing he'd be interesting
to read if the topic were, say, neo-conservative politics.

So, if you are the 1 person in 10,000 childishly wondering:
""What would the American Enterprise Institute like me to believe about socialism?""
then this series is for YOU! :)

For everyone else, or anyone looking for an academic, half-way objective treatment of socialism,
do not waste your time or money here.",1368921600,5,1537,4.984375
8572005,5,B00BOYLOJM,"These documentaries trace the rise and fall of the socialist idea. It began as a utopian plan for living not in Russia or Germany but in democratic England in plans formulated by Robert Owen. It was tried and it failed in a place called New Harmony in the American State of Indiana.

Some would say it became perverted in the mind of Karl Marx and in the hands of Mussolini and Lennin, and especially Stalin. Others, such as myself, assert that since ""Utopia's"" literal meaning is ""No Place"" it was bound to fail no matter where or in what form it was tried, whether as the Israeli Kibbutz or the Soviet collective farm or the planned economies of Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union.

These three documentaries taken together trace socialism's imposition, voluntary and involuntary, on different societies and its failure. As the sainted Margaret Thatcher put it so well, ""Sooner or later you run out of other people's money.""",1366675200,4,924,4.76875
