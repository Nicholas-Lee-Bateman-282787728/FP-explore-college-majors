8292761,5,B001DDBCZK,"If the elite in a country decides to follow a neoliberal strategy, the world would become marvelous, un mondo maravilloso. I mean it would become marvelous for them, for the elite. It would be like in a fairy tale: solid contacts with the big shots in the international boards, participation to international meetings, having there historical speeches ... and the fairy tale could go on further: becoming the president of one of those international boards, even thinking at a Nobel for economy or whatever, why not? Life offering everything with generosity, for that's what life is for the elite: a neoliberal fairy tale.

What about the rest of the society? Take the middle class: it means a house, a car and a job. Just a decent life, nothing more. Is it possible? Well, nobody knows it for sure. The middle class is another kind of fairy tale, I mean you'll never know if it's more than a fairy tale.

What about the dirt poor ones? It depends on the fairy tale you want to believe in. In the neoliberal fairy tale, poverty has been eradicated, period. Thus if you see a poor compadre on the streets, he is a freaking lazy drunkard, an impostor paid by the opposition media to impersonate a compadre. Better to forget about, or are you a freaking Communist? There is also another narrative for these compadres, it's their own fairy tale: the present situation is just a temporary accident, soon they will enter the middle class. Sancta Simplicitas!

Well, because all of this is a fairy tale, it happens sometimes like in fairy tales: one of those compadres, the poorest of the poor, el ms pobre de los pobres, enters suddenly the rangs of the middle class following a fluke accident that looks like attempted suicide. The opposition media exploits the event. In order to solve the embarrassing situation, the guy is offered a house, a car, and a job. This leads to a sarabande of fake attempted suicides, as each poor compadre wants to be middle class tambin. And the elite realizes that, rather than eliminating poverty, they should eliminate the poor ones: a new law declares poverty a felony and any poor compadre is thrown in jail. Sounds impossible? Just think twice.

Un mundo maravilloso, the 2006 movie of Luis Estrada, is just that: a fairy tale with some more fairy tales within. Damin Alczar plays the bum who will experiment that having one day as a rich man is better than a life as poor. Es mejor una da de rico que una vida de pobre!

Now, wait a little: you'll say that right wing policies are bad, thus you should vote the left wing. Just so? Think twice. Or watch the other movies of Luis Estrada. La Ley de Herodes, 1999: the left wing party rotting in corruption and abuses. El Infierno, 2010: mafia and authorities perfectly nested. La Dictadura perfecta, 2014: corruption across the whole political spectrum, manipulation through media, elections as a farce.",1421020800,,2884,4.714285714285714
8292762,4,B001DDBCZK,"This may be consider a black comedy film. It is not cheerleading AMLO as a poor reviewer mentioned before. It is presenting with black humour the silly position of politics in order to get a solution to the expenses in social-care and ""create"" a perfect Mexico. It is not cheerleading social-care, but it is portraiting a very radical right wing position.",1308873600,,355,4.836065573770492
8292763,2,B001DDBCZK,"Unlike the director's earlier masterpiece, La Ley de Herodes, this film is not brave political commentary against corruption but rather blatant politcal cheerleading for the Mexican fascista Chavista, Andres Manuel Lopez Perdedor.  If you are part of the AMLO cult, by all means watch and enjoy.  If you are among the great majority of Mexicans who voted against him, however, this whole film will feel like a grand waste of time.",1241136000,,430,5.042253521126761
8292764,4,B001DDBCZK,"Juan Perez is a lovable, hapless drunk who enters the World Finance Center's building in Mexico City to catch some Zzzz after another cold and rainy night of drinking tequila.  Little did he know the janitor would come into the office for some light cleaning.  Frightened, Juan climbs out the window to hang on the ledge (which was tense enough to watch, knowing how much tequila he had had).  When he screams ""Help Me"" to passers-by below, people think he was attempting suicide.  He plays along with that idea, telling everyone it was his poor life that brought him to his grief.

His condition catches the attention of the wife of the Secretary of the Interior.  The wife convinces her husband to get Juan a nice home, a car and even a job.  The husband complies, as he wants to be the next president of the World Bank.

For a while Juan's life is a reflection of his dreams:  a wife, a house, a car, a family.  But all that is lost...

The movie starts out in a happy mood, but ends in a bittersweet tale.  I don't want to mention anything else or otherwise I'd spoil the end.  This is a movie that can certainly incite heated discussion of global economies, working classes, and status of wealth.

This movie shows how money can corrupt, how family and friends are important, how living happily does not always mean having a lot of money,although ""one day of being rich beats a lifetime of being poor.""  But this movie also shows the class distinctions and class treatments and the discrimination between rich and poor in Mexico.  One can argue that this movie mocks the current Mexican government and its treatment of its poor.

One thing I noticed is that all the governmental workers in this movie were white Spanish Europeans.  Even the poor people were mostly poor whites--europeanos--and not indigenous or indios who tend to seek illegal entry into the US for a better way of life.  Was this portrayal intentional?

On a technical note, the subtitles were often hard to read because the font was small and many of the words were white-on-light background.

This is a movie I intend to play for a Spanish-language class.  Hearty disussion on social issues will always follow a movie such as this one.",1227312000,4,2210,4.627249357326479
