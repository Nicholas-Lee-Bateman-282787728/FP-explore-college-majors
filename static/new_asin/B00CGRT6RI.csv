8581647,5,B00CGRT6RI,"Is it not our inevitable death that gives our life some meaning? What happens if that inevitability turns imminent?

At its core, this drama is about love, forgiveness, and redemption. Don't all meaningful relationships involve all three?

This is perhaps the most original drama I have ever seen. There are situations in this drama which I have never seen before because of the nature of the characters. The main character for example, played so wonderfully by Lee Yo Won who is perhaps the most talented Korean actress of her age group, has two souls. But one soul cannot reveal herself. The result is everyone, including the main character herself, rationally concludes the main character has multiple personality disorder!

49 days itself has a deep meaning in Buddhism as they believe dead people's souls wander for 49 days on earth prior to going to the next life.

But 49 days also has a strong metaphorical meaning. Life is short. Achieving what are seemingly easy things, such as having 3 true friends/lovers in your life, can be very difficult. ""People would never want to attend their own funeral while having the ability to see the hearts and minds of others"", says the Grim Reaper, ""because people would realize how few really loved them"".

Maybe we should all live our lives as if we only have 49 days to live and strive to have least 3 people who truly loves us (outside of family) in order to prolong our lives.

This drama can also be hilarious. The comedy comes out of nowhere to delight the audience with laughter. There is no slapstick comedy here but of situational comedy where only the audience understands the nuances of each other's mindset and becomes aware of how ironic the circumstances are.

All the characters, even the antagonists, are highly likable at certain levels. There is no dumbed-down ""evil"" character for the sake of being evil. ""Why did you betray me?"" asks the main character to her best friend. The best friend replies ""You always thoughtlessly provided me things without regard for my feelings and needs. You never asked me what I needed or how I felt. You simply gave things you wanted and that always made you feel superior and better than me. You thought you were just being a good friend. But I felt humiliated that I had to rely on friends like you!"" The psychology of this drama is real.

This drama had high ratings in Korea. The only reason why it wasn't a major blockbuster hit was perhaps because the drama did not have strong star-power in its cast. But don't let that deter you from watching this gem.

Pros:
1)Highly unique drama with strong script and cast.
2)The situational comedy of this drama is some of the best I have ever seen. This drama can be quite funny.
3)The drama hits on all emotional cylinders. You will experience a lot of different emotions.
4)Highly likable characters. Even the antagonists are somewhat likable. It becomes really easy to care for the characters.
5)This drama makes you think about the deeper things in life. Are you sure you have your priorities in place? Watch this drama and you would know.

Pros:
1)The drama went about 2 episodes too long. But I am being picky here. Every episodes had its gems.
2)The drama doesn't start to get interesting until about the end of the 2nd episode.
4)The last plot twist (involving siblings) was both unconvincing and unnecessary.",1410393600,,3363,4.762886597938144
8581648,5,B00CGRT6RI,"You have to get this drama.  I have really enjoyed not only the drama but the the story and meaning behind it was great.  I enjoyed the music by Oh Hyun Ran, i know i didn't get that name right, and really think this was a great buy",1409270400,,232,3.8125
