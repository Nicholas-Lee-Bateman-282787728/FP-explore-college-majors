8246865,3,B0012MG8PQ,"I will begin this by saying the yardstick I hold this DVD to is Big Beach Boutique II, which I consider to be phenomenal.  'Incredible Adventures in Brazil' is not bad by any means.  It follows Fatboy Slim during his DJ tour of Brazil and bounces back and forth between sets at the various venues, although much seems to come from one mobile station.  The tracks are skewed toward the country and the continent which is appropriate.

My main dislike with the DVD is that the score may or may not follow what the viewer is seeing.  The audio is excellent throughout, but there is no way for you as a viewer to feel like you are seeing what was going on while those tracks were being spun.  The editing issues a great soundtrack, but the video seen does not necessarily jive with what you are hearing.  In other words, it just did not ""take me there"" nearly as much as Big Beach Boutique II.  If this feeling is unimportant to you, I would up the rating to four stars.",1210377600,6,966,4.3277777777777775
