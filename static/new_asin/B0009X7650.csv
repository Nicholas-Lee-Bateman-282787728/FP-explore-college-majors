2332839,4,B0009X7650,I have not had very much experience with ebay as of yet but for the little I have had it has been really good.  The products are received promptly in great condition and the site is pretty easy to use.  I have only had one bad experience with an item shipment but the product was also just what I had expected.  I look forward to doing more business in the future.,1199577600,,364,4.098591549295775
2332840,2,B0009X7650,"As noted, this DVD contains two stories.  I haven't seen the second one yet, but ""The House of No Return"" wasn't very exciting.  Three kids form a club and initiate others into it by having them stay 1 hour in a creepy house.  It's pretty silly, since the three admit that they've never done it themselves.

In comes Chris, the new kid in town.  Why he pays the 3 any attention is surprising since they are very mean and arrogant.  He turns down their offer to go into the house for their club, so they grab him and lock him in the house.  They tell him as he fights to get out that he can join their club after the hour.  This is so stupid.  Why would he want to after they were so mean to him?  I won't spoil the ending, but Chris does get back at them in the end.

Pretty weak episode, unless you find 2 people walking down a staircase with white makeup on scary.  That's about it for the chills.  That is if you don't count how homely the girl in the episode is.  What a hound!  I had a hard time looking at her.  Also, the story just suddenly ends without any clue what happens next.  It's like R.L. Stine realized how bad this story was, and suddenly decided to end it.

If you want a great teen show for scares, try ""Are You Afraid of the Dark?"".  It is done so much better.",1190851200,,1281,4.052
2332841,5,B0009X7650,"Ok there is not really an episode on this DVD called SCARY HOUSE.
But who really cares!? I actully sent a (...)letter to R.L. Stine asking him to release a GOOSEBUMPS SEASON on DVD, and so when Isaw this posted on borders.com I really thought this was a season of Goosebumps released to DVD. But whatcha' gonna' do? But I have to say for all you people who want a new GOOSEBUMPS DVD then stay the hell away from this! It's nothin' like Goosebumps, it's like the writers of MY TEACHER ATE MY HOMEWORK actully stepped over to write for GOOSEBUMPS, but no. I looked at the opening credits of of THE HOUSE OF NO RETURN(the first episode on this DVD) and it said teliplay by BILLY BROWN&DAN ANGLE.-THE BRIAN",1128470400,,702,4.407692307692308

8069151,2,B0009X7650,eh not the best goosebumps eps but not the worst. the first ep i cant remember is intended to be scary but it comes off flat because we don't see anything scary happen. the acting is ok and all but there is no real fright to make u scared. its about a group of mean kids who think they aren't scared of anything and when they want a new member they try to see if that person can stay in a abandoned house all night that is supposed to be haunted by 2 ghost. the 2nd ep isn't scary at all its more fun and silly. its about two kids who r trapped in a board game with two ghost.,1415145600,,576,3.808333333333333

8069157,4,B0009X7650,"This is not a movie! Goosebumps was a television series in the mid 1990s that aired on Fox and was based on the book written by R.L. Stine! The series was filmed in Canada on a low-budget, which explains the bad acting and special effects.

There earlier DVD releases, like this one, were horrible as they don't contain menus and the picture quality is slightly below average.

Here we get two episodes, The House of No Return and The Haunted House Game. In The House of No Return, Chris is new to town and is desperately wanting to make new friends, even if it means going into a haunted house.

Then in The Haunted House Game, a few kids discover a strange board game in a creepy old house. Once they start playing, they unleash several ghosts.

Both of these episodes are about 22 minutes in length. Kids will enjoy watching them around Halloween.",1346112000,2,850,4.5
8069158,5,B0009X7650,"I purchased this DVD for my daughter, who loves scary shows and Halloween, but she wasn't really interested. I'm not sure why, but i was slightly scared watching this DVD! The older I get, the whimper i am towards scary shows and movies. We bought a different DVD (the one with the pumpkins on the cover) and she loves those episodes but hasn't quiet gotten into these.

In short, surprisingly good acting from some of the main characters (especially on the second episode), I would recommend.",1330560000,3,493,4.732558139534884
