5055218,5,B0074XZWTK,"I had not heard of this band since I am from the East Coast. I happened to see them on Palladia & immediately went Wow, I have to have these guys music. They have all the old Southern rock influences along with country intelligence. I will say this is my favorite new band in a long time. This is classic Southern country/rock @ it's best.",1352073600,3,339,4.230769230769231
5055219,5,B0074XZWTK,This is such an awesome band!! They put all their heart & soul in everything they do. I own everything they have put out. They really deserve to hit the big time. Pure Southern Rock still lives and they are proof!! I love this band!!!,1344470400,2,234,4.222222222222222
5055220,4,B0074XZWTK,Product arrived on time. Good packaging. Blackberry Smoke rocks. Looking forward to new material. Will purchase additional material pertaining to Blackberry Smoke.,1339718400,,163,6.454545454545454
5055221,5,B0074XZWTK,Happened to stumble onto these guys on Palladia. Great Southern Rock! These days with the all the lip synching Lady GaGa's of the world it does my heart good to hear some good old fashioned jamming.,1334361600,9,198,4.527777777777778
5055222,5,B0074XZWTK,"I just saw this on TV and it does my heart good to see younger guys keeping this kind of thing alive. Blackberry Smoke are down-to-earth southern boys who love real music and play it really well. It's a trip down memory lane for me - not because I've ever heard these songs before but because of the style and authentic genuine-ness of the music and the look. It takes me back. I don't know if these guys think of themselves as retro. Maybe they do. One lyric says something about being a dying breed of rock and roller (and sadly, I think that's true) but some things should just never die... and this kind of musical experience is one of them.",1334188800,17,645,4.295081967213115
5055223,5,B0074XZWTK,"This concert is fantastic....why is it not available on bluray? I've been watching it in Hi-Def on Palladia all weekend....this is in definite need of blu ray treatment, and I mean NOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!",1333843200,12,209,5.5625
5055224,5,B0074XZWTK,"Good sound, great performance. Wonderful entertainment.

""Don't Choke On the Smoke.""

The cinematography makes it feel like you are there watching in person.",1403481600,,157,5.782608695652174
5055225,5,B0074XZWTK,"If you have ever wondered what the Blackberry Smoke boys sound like live, then gets this DVD. The Georgia Theater is an intimate place, but this Southern rock band is nothing but great sounds!",1402012800,,192,4.676470588235294
5055226,4,B0074XZWTK,"Liked this dvd enough to book tickets to see them but I think UK audiences will find them too rock for the country crowd and too country for the Skynyrd fans. But having said that, if you like your ass kicking southern rock with a heavy country leaning and plenty of slide guitar then you'll probably enjoy them too.",1392336000,,316,4.372881355932203
5055227,4,B0074XZWTK,"The video and audio quality is excellent, and the show is really great. I am new to Blackberry Smoke, but I like what I hear and this DVD motivates me to see them when they are in town.",1390089600,,185,3.8947368421052633
5055228,5,B0074XZWTK,"he loves it plays it all the time, I am already tried of hearing it. would recommend it to anyone who likes these guys",1388448000,,118,3.9583333333333335
5055229,5,B0074XZWTK,Gives anyone who likes their music a complete visual of the band and their talents. The audio and video are both done with great quality. Glad I got this DVD and enjoy watching it with the stereo cranked...,1384905600,,206,4.447368421052632
5055230,1,B0074XZWTK,"I was very disappointed with this DVD, the interviews are all very interesting, but they're all mixed in with the songs, they're not even tracks on there own, but tagged to the end of the songs. I wanted a concert, all the songs together; stick the interviews at the end. 5 stars for the concert footage, but for me the songs and interviews all mixed in together does not work, so only 1 star. A massive opportunity missed, could have been another ""One more from the road"", but instead its one for the bin.",1379721600,2,506,4.3936170212765955
5055231,5,B0074XZWTK,"Another good item from an outstanding seller with great customer service! Positive experience every time! Easy & stress free to buy from. Fast & secure delivery! This one is a gift and I'm sure it will be appreciated & enjoyed! Thanks!
As Far as the music goes...These guys are awesome musicians and really know how to play with perfection in their own style of Southern Rock & Blues!! Once you see them perform & hear their music, you're hooked! I saw them on Palladia and knew I needed to have their concert on DVD. Hope someday it's in Blu ray.",1379635200,,547,4.48
5055232,5,B0074XZWTK,This is a terrific band with some of the very best music I have heard in many years.  I always enjoy watching them perform.,1378080000,,123,4.125
5055233,5,B0074XZWTK,"This DVD is EXCELLENT.  The band, Blackberry Smoke is totally awesome.  Can't say enough good - can't wait for another DVD to come out!",1377388800,,135,4.583333333333333
5055234,5,B0074XZWTK,"I saw this on Palladia and became a fan immediately. If a group had been custom tailored to the style I love most, Blackberry Smoke would be it. I have been to a bunch of concerts. ZZ Top, Skynyrd, AC/DC, Hank Jr, Travis Tritt, Alabama, Ted Nugent, Willie Nelson, the list goes on. Blackberry Smoke is as good as any of those, and better than ANYTHING offered by the mainstream these days. These guys have more talent in one hand than the candy coated pop stars do in their entire bodies. I have seen them in person 3 times, and I'm not passing up the chance to do it again when they come close enough. If you have any interest in this type of music, BUY IT. They are very, very good.",1374019200,,684,4.1893939393939394
5055235,5,B0074XZWTK,Excellent music played by a talented band. I saw them in Tuscaloosa and the band is very entertaining and their talent is amazing. All their cd's are good.,1371945600,,155,4.571428571428571
5055236,5,B0074XZWTK,"I really like the Video, wonder why its not on CD, they need to play the Chicago market they bring back memories of the Southern Bands I saw here ( before the plane crash) Green Grass and High Tides, Charlie Daniels, Marshall Tucker,etc. Great Music",1371859200,,249,4.555555555555555
5055237,5,B0074XZWTK,"Great concert video, I wish it was released as a live cd not just as a video! I can't wait to see them, hopeful they will tour in Illinois!",1371600000,,139,3.8275862068965516
5055238,5,B0074XZWTK,"After I found out about this band, I was very happy to see they had a live dvd available. I know the concert airs on cable, but I did not have it at the time. I put in the dvd and popped a cold one and was amazed! There are interviews with band members between some of the songs that tell the story of how the band started, and their music philosophy. The entire show is musically great! If you are craving some good music these days (which in my opinion is in very very short supply) Blackberry Smoke is the band to see! Their version of ""Man Of Constant Sorrow"" is a rocking guitarfest! I cannot stress enough what a great dvd this is, and is one of the best concert dvds I have ever seen. Please note that you can purchase this dvd as well as their cds on their official website at REASONABLE prices, not what you see here or that other marketplace site.",1371427200,,857,4.137724550898204
5055239,5,B0074XZWTK,"very good band, excellent live ,good old  southern rocking country style.the documentary concert blend is a good mix good rock ,with a good story or two",1367452800,,152,4.846153846153846
5055240,5,B0074XZWTK,"Amazing band.  Video was well done, sound quality was great.  Enjoyed watching and listening.  Would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Southern Rock.",1367280000,,151,5.478260869565218
5055241,5,B0074XZWTK,Southern rock is alive and well and it is Blackberry Smoke that is the reason. I have since purchased everything I can get that they have done. Can't wait to see them live some day.,1367280000,,181,4.2
5055242,5,B0074XZWTK,"We stumbled on this concert one evening while rolling through channels for something to watch.  They are an amazing band and given that they recorded their new CD at Zac Brown's recording facility, that was all the endorsement we needed.",1366329600,,237,4.925
5055243,5,B0074XZWTK,"I got this for my dad per his request, he is happy with it! He watched a preview of this on tv and wanted the DVD. The DVD was only about 20 mins more content tan he already saw though.",1365897600,,185,3.65
5055244,5,B0074XZWTK,Saw the concert on Palladia concert channel and had to own it.  I watch it about once a week and even ripped the audio onto a CD for my car.  Kickass band.  No clue why they aren't more popular.,1365724800,,194,3.923076923076923
5055245,5,B0074XZWTK,Blackberry Smoke is a very amazing band.  I was hoping I was getting the outdoor show as seen on Audience TV but this is almost as good.,1365552000,,136,4.037037037037037
5055246,5,B0074XZWTK,"It's a really cool concert. It's great to hear some younger bands keeping the Southern Rock alive! I first saw the band on Paladia and liked what I heard. When I saw the video and cd on Amazon.com, I had to order them.  I hope to hear more from them and hope to see them play here in Iowa.",1364688000,,289,3.8983050847457625
5055247,5,B0074XZWTK,these guys are great must have for any fan hard working group with endless potencial this is a purchase you won't regret.,1364428800,,121,4.545454545454546

The seller shipped it 3 days after I placed the order and I got it fast!  Made it here in time!  My husband and I have been to two different live shows with Blackberry Smoke and they are amazing! This is a must see for any fans of Southern Rock or Alt country.... You will love these guys!,1357430400,,397,4.12987012987013
5055252,5,B0074XZWTK,"Just discovered this group.  The music is good ole southern rock.  Reminds me of the group Lynyrd Skynyrd.  The songs ""Freedom "" and ""Sleeping Dogs""  are my favorites",1356998400,,166,4.821428571428571
5055253,4,B0074XZWTK,"I really like B S music and I'm 70 years old!  I would liked to have captions available on the DVD, since at my age, I don't want to miss a thing.  I liked the personal interviews and extra scenes.  Glad I got the Video!",1355788800,4,220,3.8444444444444446

8510242,4,B0074XZWTK,"The good old Amazon 30 second clip is where I first heard this band, 'cause you know I wouldn't hear it on the FM nowadays.  So...I listened to pieces of ""The Whippoorwill"" and realized that ""Music as I know it"" was still alive and well.  I followed Skynyrd through the 70's, 80's, 90's and beyond, enjoyed Henry Paul and Monte Yoho's new Outlaws album and have always kept an ear on the CDB, but other than some of the excellent Bluegrass based jam-bands like Leftover Salmon, there's nowhere for a country boy to go for some new Southern Rock...until now.  Thank God for The Smoke.  Their kind of rockin' has it all: a guitar sound that mixes Skynyrd, ZZ, Georgia Satellites etc. with a touch of the late Billy Powell's style of lighting up the piano and some classic redneck songwriting, minus the current Nashville trend of trying too hard to sound Country.  Add a splash of Black Crowes and you have Blackberry Smoke. I had to start someplace and this DVD is where I chose to wade in to the world of BS.  It sounds great, although maybe not as perfect as the new ""Leave A Scar"" live album.  The set list wants for nothing and even includes ""Man Of Constant Sorrow"" which I found both interesting and enjoyable.  There are some tracks on this disc that aren't on the the new one, so if you want'em all, you need this show in your collection.  The only thing that bothers me are the interspersed interview segments.  I'd prefer a full un-interrupted show, so this only gets four stars.  Blackberry Smoke may well be the only sh!# kickin' Southern Rockers on the edge of the big-time today, but there are those of us who still remember a new band called The Allman Brothers Band. A Dixie Renaissance?  Hey...Sometimes lightning strikes twice. So Give 'em Some Love and Buy This DVD",1408579200,,1783,4.5375
