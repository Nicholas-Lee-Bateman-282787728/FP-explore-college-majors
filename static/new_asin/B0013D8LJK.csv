8250225,4,B0013D8LJK,Too much time in the movie was spent on the hair metal singer in the orange bandana.  Who cares if his heroes are Kip Winger and Dee Snyder!,1472860800,,140,4.0
8250226,2,B0013D8LJK,"Too much emphasis on drag racing and hill climbs.  Hardly none on bikes and bikers, or other offerings at Sturgis. No clear direction.",1462320000,,134,4.826086956521739
8250227,3,B0013D8LJK,Spent way too much time on the hillclimb.,1453680000,,41,4.25
8250228,5,B0013D8LJK,Great viewing in the dark and cold winter months (here in the northern states).,1421539200,,79,4.714285714285714
8250229,2,B0013D8LJK,"The DVD is boring, to much time spent on racing not enough time spent talking about the bikes and people or even the intersting rides to be had, it was just a quick skim across Sturgis. it could have been done to make the DVD more interesting. Wouldn't recommend it",1378080000,2,265,4.32
8250230,3,B0013D8LJK,It's alright if you watch it once but i would not buy it! So if your stuck inside and nothing is on its worth renting.,1359244800,,118,3.76
8250231,3,B0013D8LJK,"This a great movie, if you are looking for the history and backround of just a few events there. I.e. full throttle saloon, hill climb, and a few others.

It really did not go into a lot of detail of the event, I was hoping to see more biker interviews, bikes, events at various bars, etc.

The ""one million motorcycles"" version of this series was better, in my opinion.

The best I have seen on sturgis so far, would be ""Sturgis Uncensored"" which gives a much better insiders look at the partying, and many interviews.",1331251200,,519,4.442105263157894
