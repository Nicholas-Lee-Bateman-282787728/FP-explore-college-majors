938748,4,6304893116,"This movie is closer to movies John Woo did before he came to Hollywood. I'm talking about Hard Boiled and The Killer. These both had high melodrama and an emotionally troubled hero. Dolph does quite a good job of this and  gives a pretty good performance.

Many people criticise Dolph for not  being a good actor but when you forget that your watching him you'll  realise that he's quite good despite never having any acting lessons. This  is the first film in which I've seen him be a sort of father figure. I  think he handles dialogue well and tries his best to do as much as he can  in the mediocre roles he is offered. He should be in more high-profile  movies and should climb out of the DTV hell his career is in. His best film  so far is Joshua Tree but Blackjack is good to watch.

John Woo's style  is written all over this film. More so than Broken Arrow (in which his  style was entirely muted). Color schemes, camera tricks and slow-mo  shootouts are all present in this movie. It's a little lacking, and  confusing, in the plot department but when your having so much fun it  doesn't matter THAT much.

I heard somewhere that there is soon to be a  TV series of Blackjack. If there were I think I would enjoy it very much.  The only thing stopping this from being a high-profile hit is the fact that  it's a TV movie. But don't let that put you off.

The DVD is in Dolby  surround and is in fullscreen.",964828800,19,1417,4.271698113207547

938943,2,6304893116,"Producer/director John Woo has no one but himself to blame for BLACKJACK,
an action film/failed back door pilot that's as laughably bad as anything seen on MST3K.

In its first scene of violence, ex-bodyguard Dolph Lundgren uses clumsy martial arts moves to defeat four thugs. Why they take turns having at Dolph and getting their collective ass kicked is not apparent. Again, in a sequence where Lundgren shoots it out with a number of hired guns, they don't appear or fire all at once, but singly, which gives him more than a sporting chance to survive.

The story's equally lame.
After he's nearly blinded by an explosion, our hero develops a phobia to the color white.
Thus at times he's forced to wear very dark glasses.

The near-public murder of a fashion model is kindling for a later parking garage fracas in which one of the good guys is severely bullet-wounded and left comatose. A subsequent hospital room scene is one of the better moments.

Stupidity returns all too soon when Dolph saves the model from a pill OD not by walking her around but by doing a lively Spanish-flavored dance with her. It's revealed here that Lundgren has magical chiropractic abilities. Is there any problem ""Black Jack"" can't handle? Oh yah, the color white.

Slow motion shootouts, motorbike tricks plus all the usual explosions and immolations parade by in what is ultimately a waste of two hours. Oh and let's not forget that initial tete  tete with our main baddie, a battle that occurs in a pool of.....milk! Jack and this scenery-chewer are sure to meet again before the credits roll; the only question is: will white triumph over black(jack)?",1415145600,,1641,4.822064056939502

938945,2,6304893116,"I should've been satisfied with the few clips I found on YouTube of the main sparks in the movie, but stupid me went and bought the movie - it wasn't expensive.  This was some of the worst acting I've seen in a Dolph Lundgren movie.  His action scenes were terrific, as they usually are.  But the lead female, named Cinder, and her ex-husband, were the biggest disappointments, and therefore brought the movie down - way down.  Their acting was begging for mediocrity.  Lundgren is a talented actor and can play pretty much anyone with ease, but the poor guy had such horrible leading actors to work with, I don't know how he got through the movie.  Another critic writing for this post named the title, 'What the hell Woo!' for good reason.  You can't bring in an actor like Lundgren and expect him to perform the miracle of turning an almost bad script into a great one.  If Lundgren weren't so nice to look at, I wouldn't even waste my time writing anything.  His looks and demeanor are the only things going for this movie, so I would have to dub this a chick flick only - most guys would hate it.  So, two stars for his 1) looks and 2) demeanor.

938949,2,6304893116,"Since I was the most impressed by Dolph Lundgren out of everyone in 'The Expendables', I wanted to see more of his work besides 'The Punisher', 'Universal Soldier' and 'Johnny Mneumonic'. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of starting with 'Blackjack'. John Woo directed this made-for-TV pilot about a former US Marshall (Lundgren) assigned to protect a pill popping supermodel from a psychotic stalker. Sounds like it could be fun, right? Wrong. The acting and writing is atrocious and - worst of all - the direction by the usually exciting Woo is lifeless. Since this was made-for-TV, there's no blood, no profanity, no nudity, no excitement. But these aren't what ultimately hurt the film, that would be the absurd plot.

Early in the film - after a house shootout in which Dolph mows down a couple dozen bad guys - Lundgren gets temporarily blinded by an explosive device. In the aftermath of the explosion, he develops a bizarre phobia with the color white. Apparently this phobia has to do with the death of his father or something like that. Anyway, things get so bad that he has to wear shades all the time. Even with obstructed vision, he's still an expert marksman capable of hitting targets from great distances. As if he doesn't have his hands full what with his phobia and protecting a drug addicted floozy, he also becomes the legal guardian to a little girl whose parents died in a car crash. Dolph ain't exactly the nurturing type so parenting duties fall on his best friend/butler Thomas (character actor Saul Rubinek who is easily the highlight of the movie). Nothing real exciting happens while Dolph's on the job unless you count the scene where he saves the model after a suicide attempt by dancing feverishly for a couple of minutes before giving her a firm rubdown which results in some of the funniest ""oh faces"" I've ever seen outside of a cheesy soft-core romp. Dolph is also romancing his sexy therapist who's fond of making house calls. One important observation I made concerning Lundgren's ""phobia"" is that, even though he's paralyzed by the sight of a white deck of cards, he doesn't exactly recoil in terror when his therapist approaches him with her white bra clearly visible. All this excitement builds to the first inevitable showdown between Dolph and the assassin which takes place in a dairy full of  milk. That's right, one of the film's biggest action setpieces happens in a friggin' dairy. Really John?

This ridiculous scene - one of many - would be easier to look past if the action sequences were actually fun. But they're not, they're just boring retreads of the epic shootouts in 'Face/Off' and the awesome motorcycle chases/explosions in 'MI:2'. We've seen it all before so why should we suffer through this slog if all the action sequences are just more of the same? The only thing I found clever about 'Blackjack' was the tagline on the DVD case which reads: ""He's just been dealt...a deadly hand."" Allow me to try one of my own: If given the choice to hit or stay, hit...the eject button on your DVD player.",1290729600,3,3056,4.784090909090909

938951,3,6304893116,"At the time that ""Blackjack"" was released, Dolph Lundgren was entering a stage of his career that would be marked by a decade of mostly forgettable direct-to-video fare: all his big pictures were behind him, and it had been three years since his face had been seen on theater screens. As a last attempt to keep him above water, he was paired up with legendary director John Woo and given an action-themed version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bodyguard/dp/B0006N2EZ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bodyguard</a>&nbsp;as a vehicle. While the result isn't nearly as good as it ought to be, the movie remains a fun little time-waster and might be considered Lundgren's last hurrah as an action hero for several years.

The story: after an incident in the line of duty leaves US Marshall-turned-bodyguard Jack Devlin (Lundgren) with a phobia of the color white, he's called to protect a drug-addicted supermodel (Kam Heskin,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pride-Prejudice/dp/B0002ZH5PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pride & Prejudice</a>) from an obsessed ex-husband out to assassinate her (Phillip MacKenzie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hollywoodland/dp/B000KWZ7JC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hollywoodland</a>).

It's my opinion that John Woo should've stayed in Hong Kong. Sure,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Face-Off/dp/630512762X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Face/Off</a>&nbsp;was good, but by large, the renowned auteur has been saddled with projects that either thoroughly hindered his unique style or made a mockery of it. ""Blackjack"" is one of these projects: while it's an out-of-the-ordinary excursion for Dolph, this is amateur hour for Woo, who more or less apes his own style by lazily pushing it so over the top that it ceases to be artistic and becomes comical. You get a full blast of this with virtually every other scene, whether it's Dolph dancing with his druggie quarry to detox her, bonding with his precocious young niece (Padraigin Murphy) for the sake of mushiness, slow motion shots galore, or the highlighting of the strange escapades of the weirdo villain - all of which could've been pulled off in a cool manner were Woo not being forced to the standards of American television. Speaking of the villain, Phillip MacKenzie's character more or less sums up everything that's wrong with John Woo's western work: he's written as an eccentric psychopath, half creepy and half artsy, but comes across as a complete farce of a Woo-style baddie as he quotes Othello, watches a butterfly trapped in a jar, and intimidates Jack by playing Russian roulette with a bunch of straw mannequins (okay, that last scene was kind of cool, but like everything else, it could've been so much more intense had it been handled more tactfully).

On the bright side, this is definitely the most action Lundgren had and would see in a movie for several years. There's some karate, but for the most part, it's all about the big shootouts that the director is known for. There are three of these, and while Dolph ain't Chow Yun-Fat in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hard-Boiled/dp/B000N4SHNK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hard Boiled</a>, it's still cool to watch him leap through the air while firing from both hands with slow-motion explosions going off behind him. Halfway through the feature, there's a particularly standout scene in which Jack and his security caravan are attacked by machinegun-wielding motorcyclists in the woods and he starts blowing up the attackers' bikes underneath them. Again, Dolph won't be mistaken for a Hong Kong hero, but I'd argue that his gunfighting scenes with Woo were better than those Jean-Claude Van Damme got in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hard-Target/dp/0783227892/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hard Target</a>.

The production values are good, but the movie has a very superficial made-for-TV gloss to it. Acting is really hit & miss, seeing as Dolph does better than usual and Kam Heskin does okay, but Phillip MacKenzie and young Padraigin Murphy ham it up to particular excruciating levels. The whole color phobia angle is intriguing (if not fully exploited), and because of it, we get the once-in-a-lifetime scene of Dolph having a fight in a dairy factory and literally swimming in milk. The film is worth its cost just for scenes like this, but fans of both the star and the director ought to know that both of them can do much better.",1212278400,3,4652,5.938805970149254

Naturally, it wouldn't be a Woo film if all this didn't lead to a whole lot of gun fights, motorcycle chases, and a shoot-out in a milk factory (?).
This isn't exactly John Woo's finest hour but it's not all bad either. Lundgren is pretty wooden in the lead but an appearance by Fred ""The Hammer"" Williamson makes for a nice touch.

While battling his fear of milk, playing cards and his girlfriend's silk blouse, he is able to overcome New York city's toughest sniper...who cries at the sight of supermodels and hasn't really shot many people at all.
Dolph also shows his versatility in this film, as he adopts lovable 10-year-old neice, Casey, who displays about as much emotion when her parents are killed as the sole of my shoe does when it squishes a bug. But Lundgren plays well off a sexy, drugged up supermodel who wins his heart as he helps salsa dance her out of a Percodan coma. And we can't forget Dolph's cigar smoking D-cup wearing psychologist who gives housecalls in evening dresses and quotes Confucious, saying ""you must face your biggest fears.""

7879287,2,6304893116,"Keep in mind that I love John Woo movies, am crazy about Dolph Lundgren movies ( as cheesy as most of them are) and thought that Kate Vernon was incredibly sexy in this movie  ( unnecessarily so, as you will see), and I couldn't take my eyes off the gorgeous Kam Heskin.

With all that in favor, I still couldn't give this movie more than 2 stars:  it was a mess....mainly due to very poor editing of scenes, from scene to scene, you kept getting the feeling that you were missing something, and you were, because this was initially a pilot for a TV series and it has that feeling and disjointed composition.  I believe it was hastily thrown together to market it as a regular movie, and I will bet anything that John Woo did NOT have final say in how it was done.

This is another one of those "" the bad guy is impossibly resourceful, can get into anything and anywhere, has unlimited resources""  etc, despite the fact that he is nothing more than an angry ex husband ( spoiler, sorry), and a failed actor.  Yet, he miraculously has unending technical knowledge, fighting and armament skills, and mysteriously, in one scene, has a veritable army of assistants willing to motorcycle directly into the line of Dolph's fire and sacrifice themselves...why? How?  none of it is explained, naturally....and it also plays the typical  "" the authorities as all stupid and clueless"" card to the hilt.

Who has a psychologist that dresses to the nines and stares wantonly into your face, as does Kate Vernon in this silly role. Boy, therapy has sure come a long way! LOL.....well, they sure try to ignite sexual  tension between her and Dolph, as they also do with the lead girl, the impossibly beautiful Kama Heskin, however, Dolph is up to his usual wooden acting and makes all of that fizzle away.

Thrown in some schmaltzy scenes with a cute little precocious girl of whom he ends up with when her parents die offscreen in another clumsily handled plot development.  Oh, right:  a freelance upscale bodyguard is instantly qualified to be a parent and take custody of a parent-less child??

I tell you, this is just a total mess of a movie...yet, I had to throw in one star for the patented over the top John Woo action scenes, and another star for the gorgeous ladies.",1505520000,,2263,4.580645161290323
