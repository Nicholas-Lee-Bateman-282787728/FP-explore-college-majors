2319186,5,B0009U6XCU,"This is an enchanting, well-photographed film full of humor, wit and compassion. The filmmakers do an excellent job of storytelling as they take the viewer behind the scenes of the opera and tell the tales of the would-be divas. You don't like the opera? Not a problem. This movie can be appreciated by anyone who has ever had a dream unfulfilled but dares to dream on. Bravo!!!",1143158400,8,378,4.656716417910448
2319187,3,B0009U6XCU,"This is a well-photographed, at times interesting collection of stories about chorus members in the San Francisco Opera.  The emphasis is on homosexual members.  And a good many issues are ignored, including the formal education and training of chorus members and the economics involved.  One of the most amusing scenes is of the wealthy patrons lining up at the opera house door to be photographed.  This film is strictly for opera lovers.",1137196800,2,440,5.069444444444445
2319188,5,B0009U6XCU,"This movie is so charming and captivating, I was spellbound until the end.  You don't have to be an opera lover to be fascinated by the stories of these singers who would love to be in the spotlight, but for the most part are part of the musical background.  Each vignette is unique, and the personalities are so varied.  But each has the goal of glorious singing, and we can't help but care about their struggles to ""make it"".  See this film!!  And spread the news.",1072656000,9,466,4.372093023255814
2319189,5,B0009U6XCU,"One of the most painfully hilarious documentaries ever made. This is the real-world progenitor of Christopher Guest's ""Waiting for Guffman"" and is one of those extraordinarily rare examples of life besting art. If you don't see the gut wrenching poinancy of these poor chorus schleps giving it their all, each with not inconsiderable talent undercut by a tragic flaw--epitomized by the one baritone's comment that God had played a cruel joke on him by making him loud, but unartistic--you just don't get what life's about. A great documentary that works on many levels; GET THIS MOVIE!",995068800,11,585,5.104166666666667

8066519,5,B0009U6XCU,"I love this film; it was moving and perfectly captured the struggle to hold on to a dream in a highly competitive arena.  Where I live people fling out ""follow your dreams and success will follow"" type thinking.  It is magical thinking.  Following your dreams in the face of statistically likely failure is what makes these people brave and interesting to watch.  We all struggle with steady income vs. a seemingly unreachable dream, especially when we question our own talent, experience and other requirements of success.  I tremendously enjoyed the hopefulness and fears of people taking that plunge.  It is in many ways a ""feel good"" movie and a great date night film :).",1456876800,,675,4.87719298245614

8066522,2,B0009U6XCU,"One has to wonder how many of these rave 5 star reviews are by the chorus of singers in the film? Documentary films have progressed tremendously since this film won an Academy Award 21 years ago. It's no "" The Thin Blue Line"", which came out three years earlier and revolutionized documentary film making. The Thin Blue Line was wrongfully disqualified by the Academy from receiving nominations because of the re-enactments, or was it because of the re-enactments of the re-enactments? I don't think re-enactments raise an eyebrow now.

Many of these reviews are of the VHS tape version and anybody rating that either did the review a long time ago when documentaries were not as well made as today, or they are so behind the times they don't have anything recent to compare, like thousands of documentaries released on DVD first.

I live in San Francisco and have known or met many singers like these chorus singers. I watched this a year ago and wondered how it got an Academy Award. It is pretty unmemorable. I guess they were a lot easier to win for a documentary 21 years ago, or the director had a great PR person like ""The Artist"" had. Maybe the success of The Thin Blue Line so upset the Academy that they decided to reward only the status quo for a few years. Does Ernest Borgnine get to vote on documentaries too? If not now, I bet he did when this won.

Nowadays, the competition is fierce for feature length documentaries. I have forgotten the specific details, but being a gay man, I do recall there was a very compelling background story for one of the gay male singers uncovered in this film, but the director chose to ignore it. That was frustrating, It would have been much more interesting than what wasn't ignored. The cinematography is boring (the wife/partner did it). People are starting to understand you don't have to accept boring cinematography just because it is a documentary, but they still succeed today with boring cinematography. That is changing as the bar is raised, even in short, no-budget doc films.",1334361600,,2036,4.697478991596639
8066523,5,B0009U6XCU,"Loved-loved-LOVED this movie!  A friend loaned me his and I had to purchase one for myself.  What a fantastic chronicle of the under-appreciated chorus of an opera company.  I was absolutely blown away to learn of the incredible backgrounds of these people.  I was equally impressed with their knowledge of their beloved art and the dedication they give to it. What an eye-opening experience.  I feel truly enlightened and appreciate way more the path in which these incredibly talented people take.  If you even just like the opera, you will love this movie!  Bravo, everyone!",1320192000,2,577,5.010526315789473
8066524,3,B0009U6XCU,"I'm a big fan of doumentaries, especially of this type, that attempt to show personal stories of individuals involved in some artistic endeavor.  I just watched Young at Heart, which is an amazingly moving view of senior choristers.  Another amazing documentary of this type is Shaksepeare Behind Bars, which shows the making of The Tempest in a men's prison.  Both are extraordinary.

So perhaps its unfair to compare this worthy attempt to those.  Here we see interviews with several members of the San Francisco opera chorus, interspersed with scenes of the chorus in performance.  I'm an opera lover and especially fond of the sound of the chorus, so I enjoyed those parts very much.

Some of the subjects captured my attention more than others; the fellow who escaped the horror of his slum life in the Bronx was especially moving.  I was also interested in the plight of the young woman who left the chorus to make her way in Europe, with very little money.  The others had more or less interest to me.

I would have liked more resolution of the lives....did the poor girl get work?  How did the fellow performing for the first time as a soloist do? We see him approaching the stage door, but the film leaves us there.

I think this will have appeal mostly to opera lovers and singers.

There is an interesting extra feature showing the acceptance speech of the couple who made the film.  The man went on for quite a while, leaving the woman no time at all to speak.",1290816000,4,1472,4.611538461538461
8066525,5,B0009U6XCU,"What a heartwarming, lovely documentary!

While there's a similarity to Waiting for Guffman, this differs in that it is real, and that the people featured are amazingly talented and well-spoken. And even if they are not ""stars,"" most of them seem to have worked harder pursuing their dream of making music than I can even comprehend.

My favorite is the soprano (?) chorister who wistfully says, ""I'm playing a peasant, but my costume is silk because it wears well. It's sturdy. We can't get them wet, we're not allowed to sweat in them, because they are silk.  But that baritone (principal)...he can wipe his face on __his__ costume and it's ok."" But I also like the baritone quoting Anna Russell.  And the trucker trying to learn ""Madamina"" while on the road.  (Listening to his voice lesson is exasperating. He sounds great to my untutored ear, but his teacher, paid to be a perfectionist, only finds faults.) Then there's the baritone who sang some choral piece in Latin for his audition, and laughs while he reflects that they should have let him go right then.  He seems the most at peace with his decisions and his life.

It seems to me that this would be a great film for anyone with a dream: baseball, music, whatever.  Or even if you don't have a dream.  It's still fun.",1202774400,8,1280,4.628318584070796
