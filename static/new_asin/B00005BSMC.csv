7937985,5,B00005BSMC,"It is a crying shame that this series was not continued on DVD. Highly recommended, but you will have to ""read"" the remainder of the story in graphic novel form.",1411948800,,161,4.4
7937986,1,B00005BSMC,Don't waste your time or money on these. A majority of these Marvel DVD graphic novels just don't play properly because they freeze & skip constantly. I sent them all back but the replacements ALL had the same issues. These are garbage. You've been warned.,1359244800,,256,4.711111111111111
7937987,2,B00005BSMC,"Marvel Comics scored a winner with the publication of The Ultimates.  A retelling of the classic title The Avengers, this new look at the old characters lent them edgy quirks that really brought their personalities to life.  The art was interesting, the plot contained some surprises, and the action was exciting.

But that was the comic book, and I'm writing a review for the DVD version.

I'd have to say that the DVD is okay as long as you never read the comics.  It essentially comes off as a long Saturday morning TV episode, with a perfunctory plot and little character development.  The art is flat, uninteresting and utterly forgettable.  Added to that is the miscasting of the talent to provide the voices, with Bruce Banner's faint Bronx accent more suited to an apartment house's super than a super brain who is Earth's last scientific hope.

Rent this dog through Netflix and save your hard earned for the Spiderman 2 DVD.

I read The Ultimates regularly, and I'm from the camp that thinks Marvel Comics should re-tool their whole market in the ""Ultimate"" line of storytelling.  But this digital comic book thing will never get off the ground unless they can (by some miracle) get celebrities to do the voice-overs.",1141948800,,561,4.636363636363637
