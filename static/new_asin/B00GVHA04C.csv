6120175,5,B00GVHA04C,"This is a great workout if you like barre workouts. Suzanne is a wonderful, motivating instructor with great tips and cues on form. Her DVDs have helped my form in running and other cardio workouts. BarreAmped Boot Camp is different from BarreAmped in that there are cardio intervals in between sculpting moves. The cardio is usually a version of the move you just did, just bigger or faster. It really gets the heart rate up, and I worked up a good sweat (always a good sign, in my book). I pre-ordered my DVD from Suzannes website, and waited anxiously for 2 months for it to get here. I was not disappointed!

Boot Camp Intro  2 min: Suzanne explains in the intro that BarreAmped Boot Camp uses interval cardio and sculpting moves. She introduces the other ladies with her and explains who to follow for modifications. She also explains the DVD set up. There are previews of each segment. You can watch this on YouTube.

Boot Camp Warm Up  3 min: Suzanne starts with a few deep breaths before going into classic knee lifts, with arm swings and twists. Next is leg lifts to the rear and chair pose with pulses and heel lifts before lifting. This warm up is almost identical to the warm up in the BarreAmped DVD.

Boot Camp Arm Work  11 min: Each person is using different weights here  1, 3, or 4 lbs. I used 3 lbs, and they were definitely getting heavy by the end! The first exercise works the front of the arm with variations of bicep curls. Next, work the shoulder by bending the arms in a 90 degree angle and doing exercises that move the shape of the arm within the shoulder. Then, you go into pli position and do lat pull downs. The back shoulder, upper middle back, and triceps are next while you hold a hinge over at the hips. The last few exercises get harder and harder to finish with whatever weights you started with. I was burning at the end!

Boot Camp Thigh Work  15 min: The first half of this segment focuses on plies. You do a few plies to warm up, then releve on one side and do holds and pulses before the first cardio interval. It really gets the heart rate up, because you are using big movements with your legs and arms. Then you repeat it on the other side before lifting both heels and doing plies with big movements, holds, and pulses. Lunges are next with full range, pulses, holds, and heel lifts. The cardio for this one is a lunge kick, followed by lunge twists. The last exercises are in parallel with hip movements before the stretch.

Boot Camp Seat Work  14 min: Lunge overs are first with all the variations and some cardio. That standing side really burns! Variations are straight leg, bent leg, wrap around (little circles), and up and out. The last exercise is curtsy lunges, slow and fast. You really need that stretch at the end of this one.

Boot Camp Core  18 min: Warm ups and stretches are first, followed by full plank - bending the elbows, then the knees. Forearm planks are next, with forward and back shimmies, then alternating knees down. Next, you do side planks with hip lifts. Then you repeat it all on the other side. Cardio for this one is mountain climbers  yikes! Next is down dog to up dog, followed by more mountain climbers. Then you go into bicycles and bridge. I was sweating more than I expected to from this one  I guess my core was really warm. This one ends with twisting stretches.

Boot Camp Stretch  10 min: I love to stretch, so I always enjoy this part. Side stretches, pretzel, triangle, and repeat on the other side. You end with cobbler stretch, or wide straddle if you are able. I think that Tighten, Tone, & Torch and BarreAmped have similar stretches. This one is different from both of them.

Tutorial  5 min: Suzanne describes good form for the lunge, lunge overs, up & back, and mountain climbers. These are great tips to watch before you do the workout for the first time.",1389225600,217,3855,4.450284090909091
6120176,5,B00GVHA04C,This was the first time doing Barre and I really liked this DVD.  It is fun to change it up.  All the sections are individual so you can focus on what you want to,1505260800,,162,3.735294117647059
6120177,5,B00GVHA04C,Absolutely incredible and well-rounded! The first week I worked up to making it through all the workouts including the warm up and stretch. Now I'm mixing and matching the different boot camps. Boot Camp core is my biggest challenge. I've even got my husband doing a few of them with me he hits the gym 3 times a week in between those days he's running or doing the stairs at work. He could definitely feel the boot camp arms and the stretch. High reps and controlled movement can be just as effective! Thank you!,1504483200,,513,4.468085106382978
6120178,4,B00GVHA04C,"This is a great video, especially if you're someone like me, who can no longer do step aerobics or anything high impact.
The instructor is pleasant and you can really get a good workout.  I've added this to my daily workout rotation, which includes alternating between going to the gym and walking, in addition to video workouts.",1501891200,,329,4.771929824561403

6120182,5,B00GVHA04C,I am an intermediate level.  This is a great workout for this type of activity.  I will feel muscles tomorrow that I did not know I had.  Gets the smaller muscles.  You will sweat if you are doing the exercises correctly. Worth the money,1498435200,,237,4.318181818181818
6120183,5,B00GVHA04C,"You'll definitely feel the burn!!! Intense but in a good way! I personally enjoy the arms section of BarreAmped Bootcamp (that's one of my problem areas). I've only been doing the workout for about a  week now, every other day, and I already see results. I haven't lost a ton of weight but I definitely can see definition from behind and in my legs and my arms have taken on a more tone look. I should note that on the days that I don't do BarreAmped, I usually do pilates and some strength and cardio; however, this dvd is worth sticking to it. I'm looking forward to seeing what my results look after a month.",1497916800,2,611,4.3130434782608695
6120184,5,B00GVHA04C,"I love Barre workouts but the studios near me don't incorporate cardio.  I'm glad that I found this DVD as I love this workout.  It could be more intense in places but if you use proper form, it is a very strong workout and Suzanne gives great direction.  I liked this workout so much, I bought it for my sister.",1496188800,,312,4.166666666666667

6120188,5,B00GVHA04C,"This is my first Barre DVD and I love it.  No high impact and very challenging.  I love how the DVD works through each muscle group one at a time.  When I through the thigh segment I am so relieved but I feel so good afterwards.  My goal is to have a body like Suzanne Bowen.  She is easy to listen to and provides great instructions.  Her saying ""Down a few inches and up"" is Very cute!",1492300800,2,387,3.961038961038961
6120189,5,B00GVHA04C,Wish I'd found this sooner - it's a great total body workout. I love that it's low impact and does a lot to strengthen your core - it's done wonders for my lower back pain.,1491264000,4,172,3.942857142857143
6120190,5,B00GVHA04C,This is a new favorite of mine.  Superior instructor with great cueing and flow.  Light weights can burn!,1490400000,,105,4.777777777777778
6120191,5,B00GVHA04C,"Fantastic workout with plenty of instruction on form and execution.  I've purchased several workout videos in the past - so many of them approach their routines as though you're as trained and knowledgeable as they are.  Many are all about reps and pace.  Suzanne sets herself apart from the rest with continuous instruction on correct form, while keeping the pace and reps spot-on.  It's so encouraging to feel the benefits of a workout minus the aching back.",1489968000,6,460,4.935064935064935
6120192,4,B00GVHA04C,"Excellent workout!  My only issue is with the core section of the workout.  It requires a LOT of upper body (shoulder) strength which I do not have; therefore I don't receive the full benefit of this section.  As for the rest of it, you WILL sweat, and you WILL feel it!  Great home workout!",1489017600,3,291,4.333333333333333
6120193,4,B00GVHA04C,"I would have given this 5 stars except for the fact that I'm limited on certain motions I can do because of my injured knees. So I haven't completed the entire DVD. However, I am able to do some of the workouts and let me just tell you....this is a fantastic workout DVD! When I started the arms section of it, I thought it was going to be a breeze. Nope! At least not for me. My arms were burning! I like how she explains how you need not to ""squeeze the weights"" during the routines because I tend to do that. She walks you through each movement before and during the exercises. There are 3 girls you can watch; beginner, intermediate and advanced so just follow the one that meets your needs. I'm planning on buying more of her DVDs because I'm a huge fan of hers now!",1487203200,3,771,4.181208053691275
6120194,5,B00GVHA04C,"Love this DVD! Many workouts to choose from. It is not as high intensity as I thought and that's ok because after just one workout, you are sore, so you know your body is working!! Looking forward to adding this to my regular workout rotation.",1485648000,,243,4.4222222222222225
6120195,5,B00GVHA04C,"This workout kicked me ass! I did her prenatal video during and the year following birth. I finally felt guilty about working out like a pregnant lady, so I got this video and it's totally ass kicking and such a good workout.",1485129600,,225,4.380952380952381
6120196,5,B00GVHA04C,"This is a great workout! There are 4 target workouts--rear, thighs, abs, and arms. ALL of them are challenging workouts. After doing this several times per week for several months I still found these to be challenging. (I am fairly active and not new to exercise) You would think these exercises would be ""easy"" but even though most movements are not big and flashy, your heart rate goes up and I am always sweating and tired by the end. I usually feel sore for at least a day or two after! Suzanne is a very pleasant personality and gives great tips throughout to make sure your positions are correct. There are usually 2-3 ""levels"" you can pick in each exercise and I have YET to reach the advanced level. I can definitely tell I am more toned after months of use.",1483401600,,766,4.439716312056738

6120201,5,B00GVHA04C,"This was the second video from Suzanne Bowen that I have bought. I love it. I find it very interesting. I do a lot of workouts on DVD. This is near perfect in choreography cueing as well as  counts. While you might see some of the same exercises across several of her videos, it's how she strings the routines together that makes it challenging and effective all at the same time. One might need to work into this if you aren't familiar or very advanced in barre workouts.
 I work out 6-7 days a week  and I mix up workouts from  various instructors.  I have done MANY barre workouts. As a blogger + freelance writers who also features fitness commentary in the blog and have done so for other sites and magazines, it's nice to find someone who is so consistent in her approach yet will still challenge you.  Her  background sets are pretty much the same across the board.  I like how she presents the content and also that she has modified versions of each exercise.",1477699200,4,967,4.423728813559322

6120205,5,B00GVHA04C,This is one of Suzanne's best workouts.  It is doable but not easy.  She has a modifier and I must say I do look at the modifier quite often. Highly recommended!,1472342400,,161,4.161290322580645
6120206,5,B00GVHA04C,Amazing workout as always from Suzanne Bowen's BarreAmped series!  Love that she always presents different levels to choose from according to your fitness level and needs and manages to get your heartrate going WAY up there with an enjoyable workout that is non-punishing.,1471219200,5,272,5.325581395348837
6120207,5,B00GVHA04C,I absolutely love this workout!  It revamped my motivation and I could see a difference in my body after a few weeks of doing the workout 2-3 per week!,1471132800,,151,4.206896551724138
6120208,5,B00GVHA04C,"This video works you hard! At the beginning she says ""Shake to change!"" That didn't make sny sense to me at all...until I got to the first round of exercises. Oh, boy! Your muscles are literally shaking because you are using them so much. This workout paired with good nutrition will render results. There is no way it wouldn't. Ballerinas are incredible athletes and after doing this video you will have a whole new respect for their craft. I will warn that you may not walk right for a few days. There is some definite soreness involved. Also, you can break this video up over several days and pair it with HIIT or you can do it all at once. Breaking it up does help minimize the soreness, however. Instead of your whole body hurting its just certain parts. ;)",1469232000,7,762,4.45

6120211,4,B00GVHA04C,I like the subtle effectiveness of this workout. I have only just started a week ago but I can already say that the transitions are not smooth enough on the downloaded version. You have to constantly be on your computer to make sure the next part of the workout plays.,1464220800,,268,4.38
6120212,5,B00GVHA04C,She offers some different moves I haven't tried before.  Great for altering my workout routine.,1463961600,,95,5.333333333333333

6120214,5,B00GVHA04C,"I have been wanting to do a barre workout but had found a few of the classes I had taken were not very challenging.  I workout three times a week with heavy weights and do cardio other days.  I gave up long distance running a year ago to preserve my knees so I like to incorporate various exercise programs into my daily workouts.  After reading the reviews online, I decided to give this video a try.  I love it.  It utilizes weights in the workout and due to the small movements and many reps, I found I could not complete the set using very heavy weights.  Go light with the weights, I promise you will feel the burn.  This is a great total body workout or you can just focus on specific body groups if time is limited or you want to work it into a cardio workout for variety.  There is a strong core workout that will challenge even those who think they have strong abs.  The video gives examples for every exercise of less intense movements so you can complete the programs if you are just starting an exercise program.  Description and video of exercises are clear and easy to follow.",1462752000,2,1090,4.325123152709359
6120215,4,B00GVHA04C,"First off - a little about me.  I am a 40 year old mother of 2 that has worked out pretty regularly my whole life.  I am not a fitness expert, but I try to stay in shape as much as possible but also enjoy life at the same time (I eat pizza and ice cream ;-)).  Anyway - I usually get on the treadmill a couple of times a week and walk about 2.5 miles with 2 minute sprints mixed in, and I also have about 10 Jillian DVDs that I mix up along with DDP yoga.  All in all I exercise about 4 days per week and try to stay active in general.  I was looking for something to mix in with my DVD rotation because I was getting bored with all of the others.  This KICKED MY BUTT!  I am 2 days post workout and still sore, I LOVE IT!  Definitely worth buying if you are looking for something new to add in to your current routine.  I would not recommend it for beginners though.",1462147200,15,867,3.8258426966292136

6120217,5,B00GVHA04C,My best friend has been an avid  proponent of the Lotte Berk Method for years and recently told me she had found a new workout to spice up her routine.  I myself have been looking for a work out that was not as high impact as P90X so I decided to try Barre Amped at her insistence.  Now I am by no means a ballerina but I was interested in giving it a shot and I must say that I was really impressed!  The workout on this dvd helps you to feel a deeper connection to your muscles every time you do the workout.  The precision of the controlled movements helps in learning to perfect your form so that you get the most effectiveness out of the workout.  I would definitely recommend to others!,1457913600,5,692,4.126865671641791
6120218,5,B00GVHA04C,"This workout really got me hooked on barre. You will be shaking as you do it, but it is so motivating and fun! I am always sore the next day. I am used to doing HIT workouts like Insanity or Bob Harper, and while this is different, it definitely compares in intensity. Although it is low impact, your muscles will be on fire, and your heart rate really gets up there. You would never think using 3 pound weights for arms could burn so much. I burn over 400 calories in an hour, which is great for a Barre workout. The workout is really fun, and goes by fast. It is a great change of pace and has gotten me hooked on barre.

While squats work wonders, I really dread the part where it's all squats and variations of squats for what seems like forever. I love Suzanne Bowen and her videos and this one is good and challenging. I just feel like I'm never going to get out of squatting position for about half of it.

I was looking for a workout I could do will my baby napped that would provide me with toning and cardio. The best thing about this video is how it is broken up into four segments. Thus, you can choose to do the full workout or just target certain areas.

The workout is not at all easy. The first few times I did it, I actually had trouble completing it. Now, I can complete it, but I still get a great workout that leaves me sore the next day.

The workouts are concise and short.  I am a mom of 3 studying for the bar exam and still find time every day to get these workouts done.  I actually look forward to them.  I sweat, get my heart rate up and feel the burn.  I also feel energied after without feeling my adrenals being taxed.  I purchase from Amazon weekly and have NEVER posted a product review.  I felt compelled to review this video since it's a game changer.

6120232,5,B00GVHA04C,"One of my go tos. It is a little less challenging than I prefer, but it is perfect for my ""rest"" days where I'd just like to get moving and do low impact for an hour. But don't confuse low impact with no cardio because it will definitely get your heart rate up. Just not as much as her Cardio Fat Burn video. (Which I also have) And despite this, I do think that it helps and doing it consistently will give you results!

One of my friends (who has a 6 month old) and I do this at least once a week. She loves it because it's perfect for getting back into fitness, not overwhelming. Another thing I do love about this is that she includes stretching into each segment rather than just at the beginning and end of the video. (I usually do all the segments..I'm not sure if they are meant to be broken up or not) Overall, I'd definitely recommend it to a friend!",1442016000,,860,4.119047619047619

Most exercises are 8 or 16 reps, so buy the time the burn is really bad it's over.  There are 3 people to follow, each at a different level so it's easy to modify.  I see results already.

Its not for beginners unless you already have a good level of physical strength and stamina. But, you can easily build up to doing full workout in time.",1441065600,,278,4.58
6120236,5,B00GVHA04C,I love Suzzanw Bowen workouts! I did her prenatal workout throughout my entire pregnancy and I stayed in fantastic shape! I love the barre amped boot camp. It's about an hour long (yikes) but is worth it and very challenging!,1440892800,3,225,4.65

6120238,5,B00GVHA04C,LOVE this video! I really feel the burn and am sore for days after! The low intensity kicks my butt. Unlike other videos I am able to concentrate on her moves while exercising and not getting lost. I have seen muscle gain through this video and will buy others of hers! This is unlike those other videos that have you jumping around your living room feeling like a weirdo in-front of your dog.,1440028800,3,393,4.397260273972603

6120240,5,B00GVHA04C,"I am new to barre (having done ballet, yoga, and Pilates before, but not barre). I felt like this was a really good mix of all of those three. The next day I felt the burn and it was awesome! A great workout and great instructor. Suzanne walks you through each move and encourages you even when you're muscles are shaking like crazy through the routine. I enjoy this video and look forward to more purchases!",1436054400,,408,4.381578947368421
6120241,5,B00GVHA04C,"Admittedly, I just finished this workout for the first time, but I felt compelled to write a review right away. It' so nice to have bought a workout and feel it was the next best thing to taking a real life class. Suzanne really knows what she's doing and is quite encouraging. This video is not gimmicky, but quite straightforward. Her assistant trainers in the background seemed to know the workout very well (I didn't catch anyone cheating!) and offered appropriate modifications the whole time. There are bursts of low impact cardio that kept the workout from getting too dull. The one issue I have with this workout is the music, so after I've done it a few more times with instruction I will most likely do it to my own music. If you are on the fence about this workout, like I was, I think you should take a chance on it. Suzanne is there for you every step of the way, with instruction on proper form and excellent execution of each move. This DVD even comes with a tutorial for the moves!",1436054400,,997,4.423913043478261
6120242,4,B00GVHA04C,"This is a very clear, easy to follow, strengthening workout for the whole body.

I'm giving it only 4 stars instead of 5, ONLY because if I can do an entire video the first time through without having to build up to finishing it over time and/or without really getting my heart rate up, it doesn't qualify as being hard enough to call itself ""Boot Camp"", in my opinion.  I know difficulty of workouts is so subjective, so to give you a better idea of my fitness level, here's a bit more info:

I don't need to lose weight, but I tend to be very sporadic with my exercising. For example, during the summers I hike/backpack long distances up a lot of elevation in the Rocky Mountains so I tend to get more fit, but in the winters I might get lazy and lose much of my summer progress. Or, I may do exercise videos several times per week for 6 weeks and then nothing for an equal amount of time. So, in other words, I go up and down with my fitness levels and strength. When this video arrived and I used it, I had only started up with videos again that week, after almost 2 months off. So while I have a certain foundation of fitness that beginners wouldn't have, I would not say that I'm in shape enough to be able to make it fully through a tough ""Boot Camp"" video without having to take breaks.

So in other words, if you're in pretty good shape, just look at this as something that will be a good ""maintenance"" workout, but not one that will push you past where you already are.

My one complaint is that I wish the ""cardio"" segments were actually real cardio that got your heart-rate up more. You basically just do something similar to what you were just doing with the weights, only a bit faster and bigger movements. I was hoping they would be HIIT bursts, which they aren't. But again, for some people they might be. And, the video never says they are, so I can't fault it for that. I was just hoping I'd get a little more cardio in along with the strengthening.

Overall, this is a great video. It's just a little on the easy side for anyone who is wanting to be pushed or has a foundation of fitness already. But, I still highly recommend it.",1434672000,8,2149,4.2420537897310515

If you like pure barre, this is a great disc to get. the core workout is 18 minutes, so I opted to skip that and used a 10 minute core workout from another DVD, but this is my favorite barre DVD that I own so far. The music is awful and boring (just background noise). I play my own while doing this. It is easy to follow along if you have done barre before without the sound. I would recommend watching it through first if you are new. You will need light weights. I used 3 and 4lbs. There are modifications for beginners.",1427673600,,579,4.132743362831858

This was a great workout and the best part is that Suzanne Bowen's voice, pace and instructions are so pleasant.  This isn't the type of workout DVD where you are so sick of the presenter after the first few views that you never want to do it again.

We are returning the DVD's because we feel they take way to long to complete, they aren't enjoyable, and they aren't very effective. Jessica Smith TV has great workouts online.

The pause between the segments allows me to take a sip of water and set up the mat before the core and stretch.
I will be purchasing the barre amped cardio and the tone and torch.  Hopefully, there will not be too similar.",1420934400,,466,4.4186046511627906

I appreciate that Suzanne gives clear instructions and that she has two girls behind her (one for the modified, and one for the more intense workout) so you can adjust each exercise as needed.

That all being said, I use the 'seat' and 'thigh' workouts fairly regularly and feel that they have helped me be a normal-ish size 2 months after giving birth. But the 'core' workout is a lot of planks, and it's my arms that give out long before my stomach muscles do, so I haven't been able to do the complete 'core' workout yet...but that's me being weak, not a knock on her workout.

Another thing I like is that the camera angle tends to stay far away so you can watch all movements clearly as Suzanne and her helpers move into them, and the only equipment you need is a mat, a chair and light weights!",1420588800,4,926,4.167597765363128

6120283,5,B00GVHA04C,"Like many of the other reviewers, I am an avid barre exerciser.  I bought this DVD as an addition to my usual rotation and because it advertised some cardio benefits.  The first time I did it I was a little disappointed that the thigh and seat sections did not work my muscles in the very targeted way that Bar Method and other DVDs do, but I've found after doing it several times the intensity really builds through the 70 minutes.  Suzanne's moves seem to integrate different muscle groups rather than focusing on just one.  By the time I get to the core section I feel very challenged.  I like her focus on planks in the core--they're very effective.  I am sore the next day.
Suzanne is a great instructor (I remember her from the old Lotte Berk videos).  She's very efficient at getting lots of pointers in throughout the workout.  I bought this also because I am recovering from a running injury and thought I would need the cardio--the DVD doesn't disappoint here either, although I also feel that the cardio challenge builds throughout the workout",1412208000,2,1054,4.629032258064516

I could surely tell that Suzanne was working every muscle in the body..even the toes! ;-)  She provides a good mix and balance for the core, arms, seat, thighs, etc.  Be sure to follow her instruction on form and you should be good to go!

6120299,5,B00GVHA04C,"I'm a big fan of the barre workout trend. I've used the Ballet Beautiful series, Xtend Barre, the Exhale barre DVD, Leah Sarago's Ballet Body, I've been to Barre3 classes as well as generic barre workout classes. I've taken some regular ballet classes as an adult, and while I love the classical music and French terms and discipline and pink tights while in a real class, when I'm doing a barre ""workout"" I want something a little peppier. This DVD incorporates the principles of barre work and then takes them up a notch. It's fast-paced with upbeat dance music and (though normally I HATE when people say this and I never believe them) the workouts really do go by quickly
. Suzanne is one of the most personable DVD instructors I've seen- she's not sugary sweet or fake or overly bubbly- I feel like the way she speaks in the DVD is the way she speaks in real life. She's definitely encouraging but she's also very quick to offer phrases like ""I am shaking like a leaf right now"" or ""this is tough for me too"". It's helpful to know that someone in incredible shape isn't just breezing through the workouts like they're nothing. And speaking of- I love that she is lean and toned and shapely but not unrealistically skinny like some of the other ballet instructors you might see.
 The way the workouts are divided makes it easy to break them up and do one or two if you don't have a lot of time. The warmup and cooldown/stretch are also separate, which makes it easy to add them on to whatever combination you choose. The workouts are challenging- I workout regularly and am an fairly good shape and though I've used the DVD several times I still find myself having to stop every once in a while to wince and say ""whoa"". Her line about ""shaking to change"" isn't just a phrase- she means it! But at the same time I feel like the length of the workouts makes them doable- when I feel like I want to collapse it helps knowing that I only have 5 or 10 minutes left in the segment.
  One of my favorite things about this DVD (and I don't know if this is offered with every purchase of this title) is that on the back cover there's a code to enter to get a free month of streaming workouts via Suzanne's website. So if you start to get bored with the DVD you can go online and access tons of additional segments taught by Suzanne. I personally love that kind of variety.
 I've purchased lots of exercise DVDs- ballet, yoga, pilates, aerobics, strength- and this one is definitely the most used of my collection.",1403654400,11,2508,4.41036717062635
6120300,5,B00GVHA04C,Barre perfection! Suzanne Bowen is such an awesome instructor on form and really knows the moves to get results fast! Lots of modification cues for less or more advanced and she is extremely likable and fun to work out with. This method proves you don't need to punish yourself and risk injury for great results. I've been doing her streaming and DVDs since January and am hooked. I've seen amazing results in the tone and shape of my body and I feel great.,1403654400,4,457,4.518072289156627
6120301,5,B00GVHA04C,I used to workout hard core all the time and I was left in constant pain. Finding BarreAmped and Suzanne Bowen Fitness streaming has changed my life...NO MORE PAIN. I have gained great strengths physically and mentally like nothing else. Suzanne is clear and positive in her teaching. A very creative and interesting workout....worth every penny and more. It is amazing not enough words for how much I love it.,1401840000,8,410,4.871428571428571
6120302,5,B00GVHA04C,"1. The moves are simple, but I consider them challenging. I honestly thought I wouldn't be shaking or sore.
 I am a fairly active person & thought this would be a low impact workout (not challenging enough). Since the moves looked so  simple to do.

2. I felt the workout in not only the targeted areas, but throughout my whole body! while each workout is targeted towards one area barre works the whole body.

3. The short workout times makes the workouts fun and great for someone pressed for time. The longest workout on the DVD is 18 min and no workout on the DVD is longer than that. Even with short workout times results can be felt.

4. Suzanne Bowen makes the workouts easy to follow and keep up. She is a great video Instructor, and not many video instructors make me forget I am home and not at some gym taking a barre class.",1400025600,2,835,4.326923076923077
6120303,5,B00GVHA04C,"I have been looking for a low impact workout to mix in with my kickboxing and Jillian M. style videos and this is it! I have been working out 5x a week for about 5 weeks and I felt the need to mix in some low impact to give my joints a break. This Barre video is great because it uses moves somewhat similar to Jillian but adds a low impact twist. At first it may seem boring or mundane but by ""circuit' two you will be sweating and shaking. I think it is a great video to perhaps use for that last workout of the week when you are a bit worn because it is slower and more focused. My only caution is that if you have foot issues you may want to preview it before purchasing since she does a lot of foot flexer moves, or perhaps just wear a strong support shoe instead of going w/o. I have no idea how many calories this workout burns but I did walk away sweating after that final core rotation!",1399507200,,895,3.977777777777778
6120304,5,B00GVHA04C,"Over a year ago I lost seventy pounds starting with a Martial Arts class.  For me mixing it up keeps me sane.  I have a spinal fusion and was always told I wasn't strong enough to do many things.  As I lost the weight and grew stronger I gained a lot of confidence.  I love my martial arts classes but recently added dance.  I have two left feet so this was no small task.  Then I read about the barre classes.  I became interested in several but it was Suzanne Bowen's streaming website that got me hooked. I felt leaner, stronger and noticed mainly a huge improvement in my posture.  I then got this and her other DVD's in this series.  I do a section from this one everyday.  Now, for me, barre is important for my body mind connection as they say.  With Suzanne I feel the burn, I shake but always feel good afterwards.  She takes great care in cueing and technique.  I am not a Barre expert but this one has helped me stand up straight better than my mom ever could. Great Amazon service as well....",1399334400,8,1004,4.221052631578948
6120305,4,B00GVHA04C,"As a personal trainer I can honestly say this is a very effective workout and easy to follow.  I love 'barre workouts' as the isometric movements really do work, you feel them right away and you get serious results fast!",1398384000,,220,4.5
6120306,5,B00GVHA04C,"I have been following her workout dvds for years to: get in shape, lose baby weight, tone up after winter you name it and I have followed them. My first one flat belly fast did it daily with a healthy diet and result was amazing. This is on top of my list it really kicks b-t, arms yes who doesn't want toned arms and shoulders and leg work wow I am so glad she has the tutorial to show the form for correct lunges and mountain climbers. I really like the core workouts- thank God no crunches, Best part is the stretching which really kept me from getting hurt or sore. I intend to follow this few times a week with cardio to get in shape for summer.",1398297600,5,650,4.0859375

All the other mama workout treat you like you're made of glass. This DVD leaves me sore for several days and I can feel it working to life my butt instantly. Only wish she put more emphasis on pelvic floor work for alignment etc like in the prenatal DVD. She's my fav bar instructor by far.",1396915200,,411,4.215189873417722

I would get all 3 -- they are different enough to alternate and you will definitely get a good workout with all of them.  I have been a home exerciser for years -- and barre type exercises are my favorite.  These DVDS are better than the Bar Method by far, and I would rank them better than Physique 57.  You will feel your 'sore' muscles the next day.",1395100800,55,470,4.177777777777778

I was sore for several days. I really enjoyed it and am looking forward to trying Suzanne's ""Torch and Scorch"" video next",1393977600,,294,4.566037735849057
6120310,5,B00GVHA04C,"I'm on a barre kick these days and I was very excited to try Suzanne Bowen's workouts.  I am an advanced exerciser who does mainly heavy weight training like P90X and intense cardio like Insanity.  In an effort to diversify my workouts, I've branched out into barre.  Talk about a humbling experience!

Barre Amped Boot Camp combines barre moves with low impact cardio moves so you can sculpt your body and burn more calories.

Why I love this workout:

* Suzanne is a delightful instructor.  She obviously knows her stuff and is meticulous about stressing good form.

* The fun factor.  You do the exercises and feel a burn, but you don't do a million repetitions.  Just when you think you're going to die, you stop and go to a low-impact cardio move.

* The exercise progression. Suzanne has you doing a slow version of the move, so you can really focus on getting your form perfect.  You then speed up the move so your heart rate gets up.

* The low impact cardio gets my heart rate up there.  I especially love that this is true during the core section.  Suzanne puts in mountain climbers, which I don't like, but I like what they do for my body.

* Room to grow with this workout.  One of the background exercisers is doing an easier version of the moves, while the other one is doing a harder version.  Suzanne is doing something in between.

* The flexible workout structure.  You can do all segments for a 71 minute workout, or mix and match individual sections.  The sections are:  Warm Up, Arm Work, Thigh Work, Seat Work, Core and Stretch.

* The tutorial.  It's especially critical in barre workouts to maintain meticulous form.  Suzanne reviews several of the moves and provides very detailed instructions on keeping your form.

* The interesting backdrop.  It looks as though it is filmed in Suzanne's studio.  There are brick walls and large windows.  The windows are very bright, but I love to watch the traffic outside the windows.  This helps distract me from the `pain' of the workout.

It's a funny thing about this workout, sometimes I find it really tough and other times, not so tough.  I think when I really, really focus on my form and squeezing my muscles, I'm getting a more thorough workout and my muscles really feel it.  I never feel wiped out when I'm done, but as the day progresses, I feel my muscles getting sore.  I love that feeling!

I don't consider this to be a cardio workout per se, the low-impact cardio moves help the blood flow to the muscles you just worked and help to get rid of the lactic acid.  It's all good.

I consider this to be a solid intermediate barre workout and highly recommend it.",1392854400,127,2641,4.5190677966101696
6120311,5,B00GVHA04C,"I love this DVD too!  Full body workout that you actually feel the next day.  The cardio is great!  I like that it's not crazy, jump around cardio, but controlled & focuses on form (whole DVD does).  Would def. get this DVD to go along with the regular one to change it up, but also because it's a really GREAT workout & I love cardio!",1392508800,5,335,4.107692307692307
6120312,5,B00GVHA04C,"Suzanne Bowen's Barreamped Bootcamp was perfectly challenging.  It has all the standard barre requisites of tiny pulses with multiple repetitions.  The upper body section was nicely choreographed.  The moves she selected segued well.  I used two pound weights and I felt the burn several times during my routine.  I could go up to three pounds at this point in time and I most likely will the next time I do this video.  The workout had all the typical ballet type moves for the lower body.  It was challenging but Suzanne's encouraging commentary made me want to do more.  She is detailed and thorough in her in her instructions.  She vaguely reminds me of Karen Voight with her teaching style.  I have done Tracy Effinger's Squeeze videos, Tracey Mallett's Booty Barre, The Bar Method videos.  Squeeze, Booty Barre, and the Bar Method are all fantastic workouts as well. This particular DVD is good for the days when I want to concentrate on form, technique, and medium paced barre workout.  It moves fast enough so that I don't lose interest.  The background music does not drown out Suzanne's voice which is nice.  The production quality is excellent and that is a big deal for me.  I recommend this video for anyone interested in adding more barre workouts to their routine.  I am happy that I took a chance and ordered this workout.  It exceeded my expectations.",1391472000,54,1368,4.777777777777778
6120313,5,B00GVHA04C,"This is a tough workout, even Suzanne and the women working out with her are shaking throughout.  But it's also really enjoyable.  I think the instructor's personality can make a huge difference as to how much I will enjoy and come back to a DVD and Suzanne seems not just very competent in her instruction but upbeat and pleasant.  There are two BarreAmped instructors working out with her, showing beginner and advance modifications, which I thought was really helpful.  This is not a ""voiced over"" DVD, which I also appreciated.",1390521600,3,531,4.866666666666666
6120314,5,B00GVHA04C,"I bought the two new barre dvd that Suzanne created and I like them, specially this one I found this bootcamp to be more challenging than the the BarreAmped one.  I could really feel my muscles been worked, plus this one includes cardio which will elevate you hart rate up. I love it very effective exercises. Thanks to barre and ballet exercises I have been able to develop long lean muscles that I love, I do include cardio in my routines.",1389744000,11,441,4.444444444444445
8627871,5,B00GVHA04C,This workout DVD is worth it! So many great workouts in 1 DVD. I love that you can combine one or if you only have time to do one its managable due to the time being anywhere from 10-20 mins per workout! This is worth buying!,1530748800,,225,3.9130434782608696

8627874,5,B00GVHA04C,"I love all Suzanne Bowen BarreAmped workouts but I will say this one is on the tougher side, especially if you're a beginner. She does offer modifications, as there are two other ladies in the video, one showing a more advanced level and the other one modifying to make it easier. I personally like to follow Suzanne (the instructor) but I need to work on strength, flexibility, and balance first before I can get through the segments without cheating.",1520812800,,452,4.734177215189874

It may be a little advanced for someone just getting into fitness, but there is a modification shown for each exercise being done that makes it easier.",1517875200,,417,4.225

8627877,5,B00GVHA04C,"LOVE this workout. Can be broken down into short workouts based on body part, or can be done all together. I call it my ""non-sweaty"" workout because I can do it at the end of a workday and not really have to shower while still getting a great body burn. You can totally feel your muscles shaking and being stressed (in a good way). In fact, if you look closely, you'll see one of the girl's legs behind Suzanne completely quivering. Suzanne really make this an enjoyable workout. It's one I've added to my weekly library to vary it up.",1510617600,,535,4.36

8627879,5,B00GVHA04C,3 15 minute work out that can be done seperately or together. Very low impact but with some nice results. (My husband even likes to do the workouts occasionally),1508889600,,161,4.586206896551724
8627880,5,B00GVHA04C,"This workout routine yields amazing toning results for a small amount of time invested. I have two children under two. I used to weight lift and I now have zero time for the gym, or really anything I can't do in my living room. I also needed low impact for my joints. The 15 minute segments look like nothing, but the burn and shake are incredible. Essentially, you are working muscles to fatigue as you would with weights, but in stead, isolating with small movements and high reps, and holy balance Batman...it is hard to maintain form, your posture will improve along with it.  I shake every single time, and the segments are short enough to get at least 1 done a day. It requires mental grit as well, as there are few breaks. As far as cardio, it is okay. It gets your heart pumping, and I break a sweat, but it's not comparable to an intense cardio session. My legs have more definition from doing this DVD once to twice a week, than they did when I was doing leg press, extensions and curls at high weights/max-out three times a week at the gym! And the seat workout...it works. This picture compares my post baby body and then results after about 3 months of this workout 1-3 times a week. I can't speak for core results, as I just started them 6 months post partum to allow my rectus abdominus muscles to heal.",1508544000,15,1318,4.3795918367346935
