5116245,5,B0080QOJSU,"I had wanted to buy this set for awhile,because of the good reviews here,and that I used to watch The Ann Southern Show as a kid,and always liked her.
I waited till they were on sale at WB.
I got them yesterday and they were far better then I thought they would be.
For some reason I thought they were made by WB,probably because the only movie I have with Ann is ""Brother Orchard"",by WB.
But they were made by MGM.
I also thought they were kind of like Torchy Blane,kind of adventure comedys,but they are dramas,some tear jerkers!
Now I want to get the second set!",1367712000,,565,4.289719626168225

If you love Ann read the poem about her in the book, FACES AND SEASONS by Stephen Baldridge-Louck on amazon.com",1359590400,6,393,4.549295774647887

That's how I became inthralled with this wonderful actress. In this set of films, she is still young...they were filmed before her TV shows...and she still very beautiful. Her comic timing is impeccable. One of the best comedic actresses there ever was, IMHO!

If anybody wants to learn about the Golden Age of Movies...the comedies especially, please watch these movies. They are in Glorious Black and White and they are well worth the price of admission.

NOW, if one of the power's that be would please, please, please release Private Secretary and The Ann Sothern Show to DVD, I'd be a very happy person!!!!!!!",1354060800,,766,4.795454545454546
5116248,4,B0080QOJSU,"MAISIE is based on an interesting premise. Take the same girl with the same personality traits and put her in various situations (ranch, congo, gold rush, etc.) and see what happens. You really have to suspend belief because each time she meets and falls in love with someone different, so when you move on to the next movie you are wondering what happened to the last guy. I loved Ann Sothern in her TV work and so I was curious to see these. They are Warner Brothers Archive films, so there are usually no extras, but you get a good copy that will hold up well on a small screen.",1352332800,2,581,4.290909090909091

She meets a man who wants nothing to do with her but because of her honesty, integrity, strength, spunk & willingness to stand up for herself they fall in love & all ends well. These were B pictures, the bottom half of a double feature. Made at MGM at it's height but with second string writers, directors, costumers, etc. So, why the five stars you're asking? Beacuse of Ann Sothern. She's a delight. Absolutly unique star, personality, persona, what have you. The films may not be classics but she was a classic & a joy to watch. I will definately be buying the Vol. 2 set.",1347494400,29,709,4.419847328244275

I purchased volumes One & Two and enjoyed watching  them again.  Maisie is a hardworking girl trying to make the best of any bad situation in these comedy dramas.

The multiple disc sets I purchased were in good condition and played well with a good picture and sound.  Warner Brothers has been putting together several great sets of classic movies that were not only fun to watch in their time but still enjoyable today.",1413763200,,559,4.54

The end - they live happily ever after.

Maisie has a bubbly/adventurous but very grounded personality (played perfectly by Ann Southern), the supporting characters are great (leading men and the other supporting cast), the plot lines are fun, and the action is funny and completely implausible but so worth watching.",1405900800,7,665,5.027272727272727
5116264,4,B0080QOJSU,"The picture and sound quality is magnificent. Ann Sothern is perfect in the role of Maisie. The DVD box set is crafted to ensure the safety of the DVDs, which are DVD-R format. Regrettably, I purchased my set directly from Amazon and they chose to pack it poorly and carelessly and the outer case and one of the discs got smashed. A friend of mine was with me at the time the package arrived and he laughed when he saw how careless the two box sets were packaged. So I was only able to watch a few of the movies, not all of them. When I complained to Amazon, they insisted they don't pack items poorly and their defensive action took me by surprise. So I was stuck with damaged merchandise. Still, of the films I did watch, the picture was superb even on a LARGE viewing screen. (If you want to avoid poor packaging, which is an increasing problem with Amazon shipments when orders come directly from them, you can buy this set from Warner Archive direct on their website.)",1402876800,11,973,4.3812154696132595

5116267,4,B0080QOJSU,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I kept ignoring all the Maisie movie titles as they seemed superficial, supercilious, and rather bland entertainment. However, this plot was so insane I found it most appealing to my great amusement.

If you have a Navy Fly Boy friend who can handle any helicopter with adroit skill, have him or her watch this one, they will just bowl over with laughter especially with the er, cell phone scene in the helo....

How empowering for women it must have been to be seen in such a capable light to read blueprints, weld, build behemoth warcrafts, AND have superb secretarial skills!! Ann Southern is a delight in her transformational role from frump to triumphant and is most endearing. I look forward to extending my hand to the remaining series I have lost out thus far.

Great to see the 1941 aerial views of downtown Los Angeles and the Rose Bowl which I have attended recently. High recommend!! Enjoy.",1389657600,,944,4.737804878048781
5116268,5,B0080QOJSU,"Ann Southern (1909 - 2001) was an astonishing 92 year old in 2001, and the MAISIE series shows her dazzling personality close up!
--------------------------
by David ""Tex"" Allen, January 2, 2014
---------------

I screened MAISIE (1939) starring Ann Southern and many memories of seeing the incredible star of that movie over the years of my life (I turn 70 in 16 days!) returned.  The memories were/are all pleasureable.

The late Ann Southern (1909 - 2001) was born Harriet Lake in North Dakota and died at age 92 in Idaho.  Not a typical Hollywood movie star, but really.....who is or ever was!  Movie stars are all like snow flakes, every one different and distinctly unique (to be redundant intentionally....emphasizes my point!).

Her only child, actress Tisha Sterling (c. 1948 - ), is about my age (I was born in 1944), and starred with young Clint Eastwood in one of his early 1960's hits titled COOGAN'S BLUFF (1969).  Tisha played a hippie girl.....I also spent some time (not much) as sort of a hippie in NYC during the 1967 ""Summer Of Love.""  Ann Southern's daughter did a good job in COOGAN'S BLUFF, and I watch that movie often when I want to remember hippie NYC in the 1960's.

The electric Ann Southern is best revealed in MAISIE (1939) and other movies in that series which went on until 1947.

The MAISIE series was a ""B"" movie effort always made cheaply, and which depended on the dazzling and wonderful and always interesting (and oddly sexy......tiny girls only  5'1"" tall are usually not sex stars) Ann Southern.

It is a pleasure to sit back and watch Ann ""do it,"" like a sure fire Al Jolson type stage entertainer so packed with predictably crowd pleasing electricity, the audience was always happy, the performances always a success.

Ann Southern was the quintessential performing artist......AND....pay attention....she lived to a VERY old age,  She might have lived another 10 years to age 102 if she hadn't lived in Idaho in her 90's, rather than, say LA Calif. or NYC.

Smart lady, and it shows in the MAISIE (1939) movie which is all about Ann Southern at age 30 being magnetic in a ""B"" movie and stuck with dull but reliable Robert Young as a leading man/ straight man (latter cast as Marcus Welby, M.D., and FATHER'S KNOWS BEST's leading man father......two likeable but dull and predictable guys people could rely on).

I admire movie stars who make it into old age....girls mostly like Kate Hepburn, Lillian Gish, Gloria Stuart, others who got past age 90....and very few males...Bob Hope, George Burns, Eli Wallach.  Woody Allen is not yet 80 in 2014, but is sure to make it past 90.....both his parents lived past 90 and his Dad made it to age 100.

Ann Southern was 18 when she did her first silent movie extra work, and her stardom period began in 1939 when she was 30 with MAISIE (1939.....the most important year in the history of Hollywood movies, maybe any movies!).

She got to MGM in 1939 after work with other studios during the late 1920's and 1930's.

At MGM, she was given the lead in a ""B"" comedy about a brassy, energetic showgirl --originally intended for Jean Harlow (who had just died, and thus couldn't ""do"" the role)--that wound up becoming a huge hit and spawned a series of sequels that ran until 1947.

Ann also appeared in such well received features as Brother Orchid (1940), Cry 'Havoc' (1943) and A Letter to Three Wives (1949). After 1950 the roles dried up and Ann turned to television and another hit series, playing the meddlesome Susie in the 1953 series Private Secretary (1953). I remember seeing this show on black and white TV when I was 9 years old.....

By the 1950's, Southern had gained a lot of weight, and always wore solid black dresses which de-emphasized her portly body, and showed off her always lovely, interesting, and reliably beautiful face.

Being fat in her middle age didn't stop her from being one of the biggest TV stars of the 1950's...the rightly labelled ""Golden Age Of Television.""

The PRIVATE SECRETARY series was canceled in 1957 and Ann came back in The Ann Sothern Show (1958), which ran from 1958 to 1961.

In 1987, when Ann Southern was 78 years old (!),  she would be nominated for an Academy Award for her role as the neighbor of Lillian Gish and Bette Davis in The Whales of August (1987).

Both her co-stars were older than Ann in this famous movie starring geezer pre-WWII movie star actresses (Gish had starred in BIRTH OF A NATION in 1915!).

Ann Southern's  famous words about  her co-stars in ""The Whales of August"" (1987) were  ""Lillian is a person first and then a movie star. Bette is a movie star."" (Compliment about Lillian Gish, bad review of Bette Davis, in case you can't read between the lines).

RIP, Ann Southern (aka Harriet Lake of both North Dakota and Idaho!).

You were one of the best of the best and the MAISIE (1939) movie proves it......among other movies and TV shows you did (and songs you sang....Ann sung THE LAST TIME I SAW PARIS in a 1941 movie which song got the Best Song Academy Award in 1941, thanks importantly to Ann!).

Ann Southern (1909 - 2001) was one of the best performing artists of the 20th century, and MAISIE (1939) shows why in a (justifiably famous) ""B"" movie!",1388620800,11,5217,4.677984665936473
5116269,5,B0080QOJSU,"The Maisie Movie Series is a  prime example of forties fluff that depends almost entirely on the likeability of its star.  And Ann Sothern is one of the most likeable actresses you are ever likely to find.

Her career spanned the 60 years from 1927 to 1987 and included stage, radio, movies and TV.  She not only had this starring 10 movie series, she also had two starring TV series of 100 episodes each.  Whatever she appeared in, her presence added much more than her diminutive 5' 1"" stature would suggest was possible.

The Maisie Ravier Series is not high drama.  The stories revolve around a plucky out of work night club/vaudeville performer who gets stranded in various places and picks up work as a maid, personal assistant or whatever is available.  Everywhere she goes she gets entangled in the personal problems of the people around her - people who have personal dilemmas that would rival the most complication situations of any soap opera.  She encounters crime, wartime intrigue and death, and falls in love with a new boyfriend in each movie.

Each movie features a stand-alone story with a different location, cast, and plot line unconnected to other movies in the series.

Through it all, Ann's Maisie remains the single constant.  She is intelligent, positive-minded, fast-talking, attractive, dressed to the nines in sweetly feminine forties fashion,  and always triumphant in the end.

If you love Ann Sothern, you will love the whole series.

The entire ten movie series is presented in two DVD-R sets:
