8683161,1,B00OC6S334,"Well, love Bones, but after viewing all the seasons, and getting to The Ninth Season, Disc Six, discovered that it was completely cracked and would not play for viewing. I have contacted the Seller twice now and they have not responded at all!!! Completely shocked and saddened by this as I purchased the complete program, all seasons and they were quite costly!!!! 23 Feb 2017 As of this date this Seller has not responded to my request for them to replace one (1) Dics that was broken when I bought the Complete Series. My guess is they knew it was broken as it was the last disc of the last season and knew it would be out of exchange range for me to get any type of assistance. BUYER BEWARE OF THIS SELLER",1487376000,,709,4.338345864661654
8683162,1,B00OC6S334,"The one star is not for the series-the show is great!  The one star is for the price of this set.  Why spend 184.00 on 9 seasons, when you can buy all 10 seasons at the price of 10.00 each?  Which, of course, only adds up to 100.00.  Even if you want to pre-order season 11 at 39.98, it's still a hell of a lot cheaper than 184.00.  Can you spell RIP OFF?",1471478400,,355,3.808219178082192
