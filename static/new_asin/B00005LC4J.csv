1621273,4,B00005LC4J,"Well, Universal released these two great classic horror films, Dracula's Daughter and Son of Dracula together on DVD.  On Laserdisc, Dracula's Daughter was released with ""Ghost of Frankenstein"".  ""Son of Dracula"" and ""Son of Frankenstein"" were released individually on Laserdisc.  The pairing of the films for DVD makes much more sense, with Ghost of Frankenstein being released with Son of Frankenstein and the Dracula films being released together. It is also more economical for the buyer to make two purchases instead of three and still get all four films.  Both vampire films are quite good and a must for any classic horror collection.  If only to hear Gloria Holden say that she ""does not drink...wine!  What does not make sense, however, is why all these Universal films have gone out of print on DVD less than a year after they were released.  The same goes for the Universal 1940's ""Mummy films"" on DVD.  The Laserdiscs were available for years!  Ditto for the VHS tapes which have had multiple releases. Many people are just now buying DVD players as I speak and are going to be very dissapointed not to be able to buy the entire Universal Monster Classic collection on DVD!  If anyone has more information please pass it on and let Universal know we want these movies made available on DVD.",1028592000,7,1302,4.824324324324325

1621275,4,B00005LC4J,"Everybody knows that Universal went from producing some of the most stylish monster flicks of all times (in the '30s) to producing some of the dumbest and cheapest (in the '40s). ""Dracula's Daughter"" inhabits some weird boundary zone in between. It's actually a rather dull story, filmed on the cheap, but enlivened by the performances of its actors and an underlying plot subtext that can only be described as lesbian vampirism. It still has enough of the grand Universal style of the 1930s to merit an occasional viewing. ""Son of Dracula,"" on the other hand, is '40s Universal schlock at its campiest, and quite enjoyable as camp. Lon Chaney, Jr., is a very beefy Count Dracula. (OK, OK, ""Alucard"" as he's known in the film. When I was about 10, I thought that was the height of clever chic.) In this flick, he's menacing the American South which, given the date of the film, is almost completely populated by people who were rejected by the WWII draft for some reason or other. Not exactly juicy pickings for a vampire you might say, and you'd be right. Somehow it works as a movie plot, certainly better than the plots of any of those truly dreadful Frankenstein and Mummy spin-offs that the studio seemed to crank out every other month during the war. Anyway, I like vampire movies where the ""hero"" gets the girl, and the Count succeeds here beyond his wildest dreams only to have the girl (by now Undead) turn on him in a neat plot twist that proves that somebody working on this movie had a real imagination. It doesn't bear a lot of analysis, but, hey, that's pretty much the point about horror films. If you take them seriously, ""well, I warned you ...."".",1011312000,7,1664,4.625
1621276,4,B00005LC4J,"This DVD puts together Drac's two offspring, ""Dracula's Daughter"" and the ""Son of Dracula"" (although it IS Dracula, not his son. Oh well).
These two films often wind up low on fans' lists of favorite Universal Monster Movies, and are dismissed as second rate. I beg to differ- these two are actually some of the more original films made by Universal.  Especially ""Son"", where Dracula is not the prime mover- one of his victims is!  The story has some very interesting twists and turns, and is one of the most clever of the Universal Monster movies.
Much is made of Lon Chaney Jr's portrayal of Dracula as a well fed and burly vampire.  True, but he also brings a brute quality to the vampire.  This is one vamp who is a dangerous adversary physically, if not mentally.
A nice addition to anyone's horror collection.",1001894400,20,815,4.638888888888889
1621277,4,B00005LC4J,"Once again, Universal Pictures have released another double feature DVD: DRACULA'S DAUGHTER and SON OF DRACULA.  The first film is a direct sequel to the original Bela Lugosi classic, in which his sinister daughter (Gloria Holden) carries on his dreaded legacy.  The film begins with the arrest of Professor Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan repeating his classic role) for the ""murder"" of the count!!  Only Van Helsing's friend, Dr. Garth, played by Otto Kruger can help him.  The twist in this story is that Holden's vampire WANTS to be cured of her bloodlust as she seeks Garth's help.  The cast is solid in this stylish thriller.  Van Sloan is his usual rational self as the vampire hunter.  Kruger adds warmth and a little humor to his rather typical role as the hero.  Holden's cool beauty is put to great advantage in her title role.  In the other feature, SON OF DRACULA, the mysterious Count Alucard (read the name backwards, folks)comes to the American South to seek out ""new blood,"" so to speak.  He enlists the beautiful owner of a local plantation, played by Louise Allbritton, to aid in his nafarious plot. Caught in the middle is the owner's fiancee, played by Robert Paige.  Lon Chaney, Jr. plays the sinister vampire.  While he is a little too well-fed for an undead monster, Chaney does have his effective moments and conveys the physical power of Dracula.  Ms. Allbritton is wonderful as the fascinated beauty who flirts with the undeath that Drac brings.  Scream queen Evelyn Ankers is unfortunately wasted in the minor role of Allbritton's sister.  The film does move a bit awkwardly at times, but there are many effective moments including an eerie scene in which Dracula rides his coffin across a fog-enshrouded swamp.  Overall, both films are fun, fast, and filled with their share of old-fashioned chills.  Highly recommeded for horror film fans.",1000944000,6,1867,4.913738019169329
1621278,5,B00005LC4J,"Dracula's Daughter, staring Gloria Holden, is the first sequel to Bela Lugosi's Dracula. The movie starts with the final scenes from Dracula, where Edward Van Sloan continues in the Van Helsing role (he is arrested for the murders of Dracula and Renfield). As Dracula's daughter, she is condemned to be a vampire but wants to be free. She seeks the help from a psychologist, Otto Kruger, that advises her that she must confront her problem if she wants to be free.
In Son of Dracula, Lon Chaney Jr. plays Count Alucard; Dracula spelled backwards, the second sequel to Bela Lugosi's Dracula (after Dracula's Daughter). Alucard is set on establishing himself, out of Transylvania and into Louisiana, by marrying the daughter of an upper-class family. He proceeds by turning his new wife into a vampire.

Both films have a gypsy fortune teller, and a mish-mash of Hollywoodisms that have nothing to do with legendary vampires or werewolves.  DAUGHTER is aimed at an adult audience, its quality and pace surpassing 1931's DRACULA.

1621301,5,B00005LC4J,"Dracula's Daughter & Son of Dracula, DVD

Legends of vampires goes back thousands of years in the literature of classical Greece, India, and China. Before the germ theory people believed sickness was caused by divine wrath for sinfulness, or from a curse by a witch or sorcerer. A victim of a vampire has these symptoms: pallor, fatigue, weight loss, and death. They are the symptoms of ""consumption"" (tuberculosis). Consumption was a nearly fatal disease until the discovery of antibiotics in the mid-twentieth century. Bram Stoker's novel ""Dracula"" was a constant success since its publication in 1897. It told of the threat from a foreign ruler who sought to exploit the people of Great Britain (an allegory for the Kaiser). Read the book as the movies are the simplified and condensed version of the novel.

Horror movies find an audience during bad economic times. The novel was adapted for a stage play and then became a successful Hollywood film in 1931. Actually there were two films, one in English (modified for the British Empire market), and one in Spanish for the South American market. This led to many sequels in the 1930s and early 1940s. Bela Lugosi became best known for his role in the 1931 movie, but many others have played this fictional character. The historical Dracula was a 15th century Warlord of Wallachia who was successful in battle against the Turkish armies of Sultan Mehmet II after the fall of Constantinople. The Turks continued to threaten Europe until the late 17th century (the Siege of Vienna in 1683).

""Dracula's Daughter"" (1936) continued the original story set in England with mostly new actors. What if Dracula's daughter arrived to continue to prey upon the people of London? This is not as good as the original, but is an average horror story. Some read overtones into this movie.

""Son of Dracula"" (1943) is the best of the sequels. A mysterious foreigner arrived in America and married the daughter of a wealthy man. But there is a romantic triangle that complicates this story. Can Professor Laszlo prevent the exploitation of people?",1477094400,,2083,4.959885386819484
1621302,4,B00005LC4J,"These are interesting movies -- as much for their historical value as for their horror. They're dated and sometimes rather shocking to modern tastes. I've seen both movies several times; they were favorite repeat items on the late night TV horror flick circuit when I was growing up.  I think what makes the old horror movies especially spine-tingling is the theatrical acting quality of the stars --who learned their trade on the stage or in silent films. Lon Chaney Jr.'s eyes glow with evil intent and his words are pregnant with menace -- each one seeming to hover in the air with a weight of its own. Gloria Holden is poignant and spellbinding. That much exaggeration of character would be scorned by a modern actor, but these old film stars carry it off with aplomb.

What is a lot of fun is watching these with the advantage of the internet. I was constantly stopping the movies to research the career of some obscure character actor. They were all worth the time I took to discover them but the biggest ""find"" for me was the old gypsy woman, ""Queen Zimba,""  who gets a few prophetic lines in the beginning of Son of Dracula. Gee, who was she? Her name was Adeline DeWalt Reynolds. What a fascinating woman!",1476057600,,1214,4.611111111111111

1621329,4,B00005LC4J,"Two great classic Universal Horror films. ""Dracula's Daughter"" is spooky & only the substitute of a dummy for Bela Lugosi in Dracula's cremation scene (he was originally supposed to make a cameo appearance as the count, but it never happened) spoils the dark charm of the film. Okay, the hero's wisecracking assistant is pretty annoying too, but you get used to her after a while. ""Son of..."" is a later Universal effort (and pretty much a ""B"" movie) with stocky Lon Chaney Jr as the count (NOT his son -it's just the title, folks!) and he's surprisingly good, but for his hysterics when confronted with the rising sun (spoilers!).

1621331,4,B00005LC4J,"""Son of"" is about as scary as an episode of Scooby-Doo, despite a clever script by Curt Siodmak, nifty direction by his brother Robert, and a solid cast of Universal contract players. The problem is Chaney. He can't help coming across as a big, goofy American teddy bear. That said, I can't help enjoying this kind of schlock when it's done well, which this is. ""Daughter of"" is another matter, a true horror classic. The murky plot doesn't hurt a thing, because the top-notch cast commits fully to the hokum, elevating the material considerably, and star Gloria Holden is so good that you really believe in vampires until The End comes up.

1621334,5,B00005LC4J,"Initially, I was worried Dracula's Daughter would be treated solely as a comedy, considering the silly banter between the two constables who arrive on the scene just moments after Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) finished staking Dracula.  With two bodies to account for, they think it best to transfer Van Helsing to Scotland Yard where he asks for a psychiatrist (Otto Kruger as Dr. Garth) instead of a barrister.  Enter an incredibly needy vampire given to self-loathing (Gloria Holden as Dracula's daughter Countess Zaleska).  The moment she appears things picked up considerably.  In spite of the fact that Gloria Holden felt the part was beneath her dignity (she thought Horror films were declasse), she played the role with a certain verve.  She was fortunate to be paired with Irving Pichel as her brooding sidekick Sandor.  The two proved quite deadly as Sandor trolled for victims to feed the Countess.  In desperation, she seeks a psychiatrist to help her break free of Dracula's control.  Dead and gone, it soon becomes apparent that she can't go on blaming daddy dearest for everything she does.  There's a moral in there somewhere.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  *****

As for the second feature, Son of Dracula, I wasn't as enamored with it in spite of the excellent use of atmosphere and the way the vampires changed into mist or bats.  I liked the story, which plays like a who-dun-it when poor Colonel Caldwell (George Irving) is quickly dispatched so one of his daughters can get her hands on his house.  A lot of great set pieces were included, like Count Alucard's coffin rising up from the swamp and the Count sailing over the water to his partner in crime Kay (Louise Allbritton).  My main issue was with the casting of Lon Chaney, he just wasn't suave enough to play a count (or a duke for that matter).  Fortunately, they kept his appearance to a bare minimum.  I'd give this one at least **** (for that great ending if nothing else).",1414022400,,1960,4.785714285714286

But a few of my favorite films aren't available on bluray and may never be, including Dracula's Daughter. So I ordered it this Halloween. I was pleasantly surprised by how good it looked -- this is one of the best DVD transfers I've seen of such an old film, and looks better than some blurays in my collection. No need to say much about the film itself -- as others have commented, it's an under-appreciated classic.

Was this a coincidence? Or was it the fact that this early vampire movie had a strong female lead that still holds sway after all these years??
 It was too bad that the original story was not filmed; see special features.  Perhaps a bigger budget would have helped propel this movie into the realm of a popular vampire classic with the general public.

1621363,4,B00005LC4J,"The undead progeny of Bela Lugosi's Count Dracula rise from the dead in this very good collection of vampire thrillers.

""Dracula's Daughter"" was a movie that seemed to escape me during my childhood. I remember most of the films involving the Wolf Man & Frankenstein's Monster getting frequent revivals on television, yet I never saw ""Daughter."" But I was glad to get to know this film once I did see it. Gloria Holden was a very captivating presence as the ill-fated Countess Marya Zaleska, seeking release from her cursed bloodline but realizing (after a few murders) that there is no release from the curse of Dracula.

And the Countess doesn't discriminate when it comes to her victims, she feeds on men & women equally. I'll leave it up to the psycho-analytical minds of the world to conjecture about the underlying sexuality of the Countess' attack on the art model Lili. Certainly it was a very provocative scene for a 1936 horror.
4 1/2 stars

As with the Daughter, ""Son of Dracula"" was also a film that I had never seen & had heard so many bad reviews of I was expecting something along the lines of Ed Wood when I finally watched it, but much to my pleasant surprise, the Son was a very good vampire thriller, far better than its reputation would have you believe.

Now granted, I'll give you that Lon Chaney wasn't the most convincing Hungarian, especially one who is supposed to be related to Bela Lugosi, but the whole film shouldn't be judged by that. And Chaney himself wasn't a washout as Count Alucard, he has quite a few effective moments, especially as it pertains to displaying the supernatural power of Dracula.

The Son also boast some fine supporting performances, most notably Louise Allbritton as the unfaithful wife of Alucard, Robert Paige was not the usual dull-as-dishwater romantic lead you usually see in these types of horror films, and J. Edward Bromberg & Frank Craven round out the cast nicely, not to mention some great photographic effects by the great John Fulton.

""Son of Dracula"" is worth repeat viewings & far better than most critics would have you believe. 4 stars

""Son of Dracula"" review:
Well here I was a Halloween night after watching some football and the Yankees had presumably put away the Phillies. My kid and I had just seen the remake of ""The Stepfather"" (not quite as good as the original) and I still felt I needed a jolt of black and white horror. As I recall, this sequel to the early Drac films was pretty good. As it turns out, not so much. Granted, ""Son"" has some impressive sets and production but the thing just isn't scary or particularly interesting. Lon Cheney, Jr. should have stuck with the Wolf Man character, because he just doesn't get it done here. No real power, whimpy actions and for most of the movie he flies around in his bat configuration. Fave, Evelyn Ankers shows up but doesn't do much but just look good. This Count Alucard (that's Dracula spelled backward...duh) is properly done away with. Good ridance.

""Dracula's Daughter"" review:
Nothing scary or very enveloping in this sequel to Dracula from a few years earlier.  IMDb says the story was ""suggested"" by film pioneer David O. Selznik who is credited as Oliver Jeffries.  Gloria Holden is creepy as the daughter but there's no explanation as to how she came to be.  The wooden stake that ended her life was an arrow!  A vampire killed by an arrow?

Both films suffer from less than exciting plots and the formulaic 'sequel/quickie' approach in film-making.

1621378,4,B00005LC4J,"""Dracula's Daughter"" and ""Son of Dracula"" splendidly transport us back to the stylish, gothic world first created in Universal's original ""Dracula"" with the venerable Bella Lugosi as the vampire Count. The original Count is absent, however, from these tales, which instead explore the efforts of his prgoeny.
In ""Dracula's Daughter"", we are introduced to Countess Marya Zaleska, an artist and aristocrat who desperately seeks freedom from her father's legacy. In her attempt to overcome her own addiction to blood, she becomes obsessed with a psychiatrist friend of Van Helsing. Unfortunately Zaleska cannot break her addiction and, in her struggle, she falls into her family's pattern of cruelty, kidnapping and death. Gloria Holden plays the subtleties of the part wonderfully, by turns detached and desperate, the Countess is an eerie but empathetic presence in a beautifully designed world of deft, expressionist shapes and shadows, gothic splendour and modern art sensibilities.
""Son of Dracula"" moves the action to Louisiana, where a southern belle obsessed with immortality brings a ""Count Alucard"" to the country to make her a vampire. This story involves another delightfully complex vampiress as well as the new Count - cold, charming, mysterious and imposing. He is brought to life by second generation horror great Lon Chaney Jnr. amid a Southern Gothic setting of old plantation manors and swamps.

1621380,5,B00005LC4J,"Make no mistake, this movie is creaky and slow. It is old, and it is not a great cinematic triumph by any means. Nevertheless it is a gem. And it deserves to be seen as a classic of the genre. Gloria Holden is powerfully compelling as the tortured daughter of Dracula, an elegant and sensitive aristocrat who dreams of somehow escaping the curse of her vampire nature in order to embrace life. That she is a painter adds to her mystique. And the scene in which she seduces a lonely and vulnerable young female model in her studio is chilling, without recourse to special effects. Like all good horror films, this one has a strong moral point of view. Vampires are evil and must pay for what they are and what they do. Yet one finds here all the promise of the vampire concept which will be endlessly explored in later books and films. Here we have a supernatural monster who was once human and remains somehow human, a thinking and feeling abomination that is doomed to suffer excruciating torment as the price for the promise of eternal life. The vampire here is a metaphor for the outsider, the outcast, the lonely one in all of us, and the predator in all of us, too. The tragic dimension of the vampire is much more deeply explored here than in the original Dracula, and the atmosphere of the film, set in a very foggy London, enforces the overall theme of romantic gloom. I recommend this to anyone who wonders why vampires fascinate so many, and especially for those who want to understand the early twentieth century horror classics that inspired countless later films. I also find this an entertaining film. There is a delicacy and poignancy to it that has enduring appeal. I would love to see a faithful remake of this film, but until that happens, if it ever does, there is nothing quite like the original. Enjoy.",1258675200,16,1823,4.560975609756097

Gloria Holden is dead on as Countess Valeska, eerie and seductive.  It didn't need to have special effects to make it scary.  I don't think the ""wine"" line she says was meant to be a pun on Dracula, but if she had said it the way Lugosi did:  ""I never drink . . . wine,"" then it would have been a hoot!  In Son of Dracula, you do have those wonderful special effects which may seem primitive today, yet still remain original and creative.  Plus the tingling music and Gothic atmosphere make it all the more creepy.  Note: There are those who wonder why it's called ""Son of Dracula"" when he's called Count Dracula.

1621384,4,B00005LC4J,"""Son of Dracula"" succeeds on many counts, (no pun intended) by virtue of its absolutely serious approach towards its material. Unlike other Universal horrors of this period, with their unfunny comedy relief antics, (bumbling, pop eyed police inspectors, burgomasters etc.) director Siodmak wisely eschews such sch-tick, and foreshadows the tragic ending of the story, with an increasingly oppressive sense of doom. In other words, unity of mood.

Indeed every aspect of the production is put at the service of conveying this doom, from George Robinson's highly expressionistic, shadowy photography to Vera West's (Hollywood's most under-appreciated designer) costume design.

The casting is excellent. It has been rightly observed that Lon Chaney Jr. is not an entirely comfortable choice for the Count, and it is certainly true that his Midwestern dialect and general deportment is not even remotely aristocratic. Still, his virility breathes menace, and in a scene where he traps a character in a basement, he evokes genuine dread. All told, he passes muster, and even more so, when you think of what a hokey disaster someone like John Carradine would have been in the part.

Robert Paige is superb--his increasingly manic desperation in the role of the suitor ""Frank"" goes a long way in lending the yarn credibility. In many ways it's his film. Evelyn Ankers is as always, very easy on the eyes, and though she is given little to do here, she does it fetchingly.

Which brings us the the protagonist, Kay Caldwell, (Louise Allbritton) the melancholic daughter of an aristocratic line, and the proprietress of its creepy plantation mansion--""Dark Oaks."" This is a juicy assignment, and Miss Allbritton runs with it to the full.

From the moment she arrives on the veranda, a striking brunette clad in a billowing, peignoir like gown, she delineates her literally spell-bound character by offering the audience a spell bindingly detached characterization.

Who can resist her otherworldly gaze, as, staring outside of the frame, she smoothly articulates her certainty in telepathy, eerily chiding Miss Ankers for scoffing at ESP, and later her asperity at local gossip: ""What can they know of these occult matters?-blind fools!"" Visually, she is unforgettable, aided by Vera West's outr costumes, (even Miss Allbritton's day wear is mysterious--as witness her scalloped black waistband peplum ensemble with black under-dress, in the will reading sequence) and a black wig, which connects her with another black wigged anti-heroine from that same year--Jean Brooks in Lewton's ""The Seventh Victim.""

To abet these characterizations, and to conceal what seems to be a somewhat paltry budgetary outlay by Universal, director Sidiomak fills the screen with interesting visuals--Miss Allbritton's unforgettable trek through the nocturnal bayou to visit the gypsy, the gypsy's ensuing death in a bat attack, Chaney gliding across the misty swamp, and unsettling, shadowy close-ups of an unhinged Mr. Paige speaking through the bars of a prison.

Photographer Robinson is with him all the way, and composes and lights his shots to consistently interesting effect, (note the superb introduction to ""Dark Oaks,"" with the camera panning through a creaking gate at night, whilst the whole frame is overlaid with the violent twist of brambles and vines) by foregrounding his shots with interesting objects on right or left--thereby lending depth and texture to his visual tableaux.

The ending with Mr. Paige finding his former love, Miss Allbritton, literally buried within the childhood detritus of her own attic, to which, after placing his ring on her finger, he sets afire, provides a fitting finale. A finale of marked and deeply felt tragedy, as a darkly romantic musical score swells, the camera treks in on Mr. Paige's blank, despairing gaze, his empty eyes lit by the shadows of the flames.

""Son of Dracula"" is a deeply romantic dark dream of a film. Recommended.",1233964800,3,3963,5.30622009569378
1621385,4,B00005LC4J,"Well no, there's nothing on the level of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bride-of-Frankenstein/dp/078323502X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bride of Frankenstein</a>"" contained in this collection, but these movies aren't as awful as they might sound.  Sure, Universal was a factory back in the day, pumping out sequels without any real concern for the content.  Still, there's some very good stuff to be found here.

Dracula's Daughter is, in my opinion, the weaker of the two Dracula sequels.  Perhaps it's just too much of a departure from the original premise, featuring an almost likable vampire who enlists the aid of a psychiatrist to cure her of her blood addiction.  There's little development in plot or character, no honest progression from point A to point B.  Still, the acting and directing are both adequate, and Marguerite Churchill (Janet) really steals the show as the goofy, vivacious love interest who speaks her mind and cuts her over-serious boss down to size whenever she gets the chance.  Add to that a truly unusual premise (even when it fails to deliver much), and some incredibly sexually charged subtext, particularly when the Countess abducts a young woman under the false pretense of having the girl ""model"" for her.  This is one odd-ball film, full of concepts, sexual issues, and gender politics that were way ahead of its time.  Not a great film in and of itself, but it certainly deserves a viewing.

Son of Dracula is a much stronger film in contrast.  It comes dangerously close to being an incredibly impressive film, with stunning special effects (we actually SEE Dracula transform into a bat, as well as turn into vapor), an incredibly complex, emotionally charged plot, and some breath-taking acting (particularly from Robert Paige and Louise Allbritton).  Unfortunately, there are two things that prevent the film from achieving greatness.  The first is most certainly Lon Chaney Jr., assuming the role of Lord Alucard (Dracula backwards).  Chaney never seems comfortable in the cloak, portraying a weirdness that is too subtle and unfocused for the role he is attempting to undertake.  He's never an impressive character, neither as monster nor villain.

Perhaps the bigger problem with Son of Dracula is the camera work.  Director Robert Siodmak is clearly a master of the technical aspects of directing.  Movement and camera angles are almost always highly impressive, as well as smooth and unimposing upon the film.  However, in a picture that contains such strong elements of passion, desperation, fear, insanity, and (of course) the supernatural, the camera always resists these forces, maintaining a stubbornly grounded and literal perception of the scene.  The film always feels too realistic, unwilling to surrender to escapism, never daring to achieve something artistic and powerful.  This is particularly disappointing in the final scene, which could have easily been immortalized as the greatest, most moving moment in Universal Monster Movie history had it been shot differently.

All in all, Dracula's Daughter and Son of Dracula are both worthwhile sequels that hold their own merit.  While I would probably never watch Dracula's Daughter a second time, the first time viewing experience was certainly worthwhile.  In contrast, I expect to return to Son of Dracula again and again.  It's almost a brilliant film, and ""almost brilliant"" is still good enough for me.",1216425600,11,3455,5.389199255121043
1621398,4,B00005LC4J,"Dracula's Daughter is a very nice movie.  The plot is solid, and the actors and costumes really shine.  The main actors in particular are all impeccable and fabulously adorned.  The actors themselves seem to embody the true emotions of their characters.  This is much better than the trite and see-through acting of many similar movies from the same time period.  Dracula's daughter is also not gory or extremely scary, which seems quaint these days.  I would give Dracula's Daughter 5 stars by itself.

Son of Dracula is a fun movie for the period, but it doesn't seem overly serious.  The acting and scenes are rather desultory - nothing too clever to uncover here.  Of course, Son of Dracula is not even the first sequel after Dracula, so this is no surprise.  I would give Son of Dracula 3 stars by itself.",1192838400,,810,4.680851063829787

1621400,4,B00005LC4J,"Universal's ""Dracula"" franchise was one of the studio's most popular and profitible.  This DVD bundles together two of the better titles, ""Dracula's Daughter"" (1936), and ""Son of Dracula"" (1943).

DRACULA'S DAUGHTER has always held a fascination, largely thanks to Gloria Holden's nuanced performance in the title role.  Countess Marya Zaleska (Holden) is a beautiful member of the aristocracy with a dangerous secret; fits of uncontrollable bloodlust and the need to stalk and kill pretty young girls...not to mention a biological link to the old Count you-know-who.  The sexual ambiguity of the Countess adds lots of dark layers in this moodily-lit horror favourite.  The performances are very strong, particularly Otto Kruger, Marguerite Churchill and Irving Pichel as the Countess' menacing servant.  Gloria Holden's subtle performance in the title role is a marvel to witness.

SON OF DRACULA is the more offbeat title of this double feature.  A wealthy Southern heiress with morbid fixations (Louise Allbritton) decides to marry card-carrying vampire Count Alucard (Lon Chaney Jr.) despite the objections of her boyfriend and family.  Of course, the Count's true motive is to re-establish his reign of terror in a new country.  The performances of Lon Chaney Jr. and Louise Allbritton (who seems to relish her role of the off-kilter heiress) save this film from total failure.  Scream queen favourite Evelyn Ankers also has a substantial role here.

Two great ""Dracula"" titles in one nifty package.  You can't go wrong!",1190073600,,1525,5.383966244725738
1621401,3,B00005LC4J,"Anything worth doing... is worth making a bunch of sequels to.

That's what Hollywood has always thought, anyway. And in the case of Bela Lugosi's classic ""Dracula,"" it resulted in two decidedly disparate sequels. While ""Daughter of Dracula"" is creepily erotic and darkly intriguing, ""Son of Dracula"" is just a tepid, lifeless remake of the original, more or less.

""Daughter of Dracula"" is an immediate sequel, taking place only hours after the end of the original film. A beautiful Transylvanian vampire Marya (Gloria Holden) -- created by Dracula -- arrives in England to confirm that her ""father"" is permanently dead. She mesmerizes the cops, steals Dracula's body, and cremates it with the help of her creepy servant.

With her ""dad"" burned away, Marya hopes to escape her immortal torment, and live as a normal woman. She even enlists a psychiatrist to cure her of her hunger for blood. But she can't escape her bloodlust, or her longing for the love of Jeffrey Garth (Otto Kruger) -- and when she abducts his girlfriend, the only one who can stop her is Van Helsing (Edward van Sloan).

""Son of Dracula"" has few tangible links to the original story, despite its basic similarity -- a mysterious Count Alucard (whoa, that's original) arrives in the American South from Budapest. The count (Lon Chaney Jr.) was invited by an occult-obsessed heiress, Katherine ""Kay"" Caldwell (Louise Allbritton), to help her overcome her fear of death.

And of course, odd things happen -- Kay's dad drops dead, and she falls madly in love with Alucard, much to the chagrin of her ex-boyfriend Frank (Robert Paige). Imagine how upset he is when he accidentally shoots her, and she doesn't die -- leading to a battle between the mystery vampire count and the humans who are trying to stop him from setting down roots in the New World.

Basically one film is the best example of a sequel, and the other is the worst kind -- one enhances the original story while telling its own, while the other is basically a stale retread with a silly anagram. I can only see dear ol' Dracula being proud of one of these apparent offspring, although technically we're never told Alucard's origins.

And direction also varies, ""Daughter""echoes the original ""Dracula's"" murky, eerie atmosphere, full of old-world exoticism, dark London flats, midnight pyres and gothic visuals. Unfortunately ""Son"" has pedestrian direction on par with a mid-level melodrama, with lots of cape-waving in place of spookiness or atmosphere. The creepiest thing is that old voodoo priestess.

Holden deserves heaps of praise for her performance -- she manages to pack in poignant longing, hope, desperation and a bit of lesbian bloodlust into her performance, making viewers repulsed and pitying toward the countess. Chaney, sadly, turns in a horribly wooden performance; he's too husky and ruddy to look like one of the undead.

But in both cases, we get some solid supporting performances -- Allbritton as the passionately weird heiress, Van Sloan as the relentless, intelligent Van Helsing, and Irving Pichel as Marya's murderous, malignant servant, who wants her to stay a vampire and make him into one too.

With their fingers tipping into Bela Lugosi's film, ""Dracula's Daughter"" and ""Son of Dracula"" draw heavily on the vampire mythos with varying results. One is sublime, one is too dull to be ridiculous.",1182038400,,3361,5.028776978417266

Although it picks up exactly where Lugosi's Dracula ends and features that film's Dr Van Helsing, this odd but effective sequel is less stagy and more atmospheric that the first film.

BTW, this DVD also features Son of Dracula, a more formulaic sequel starring Lon Chaney Jr.--not so hot. Chaney plays ""Count ALUCARD."" --Get it? ALUCARD? Nudge-nudge?",1170806400,,462,5.416666666666667
1621403,4,B00005LC4J,"Dracula's Daughter is little known and even less scene. I cannot recall having ever seen it on TV, or at least not for many years and is one of the most ignored Univeral horror films.

Dracula's Daughter is the direct sequel to the 1931 classic although it did not appear until 1936. The film opens mere moments after the events in Dracula as two English constables enter Carfax Abbey and find the body of Renfield lying at the bottom of the stairs after being killed by Dracula. They then see Professor Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan0 emerge from the crypts and admitting to driving a stake through Dracula's heart. A Wax dummy stands in for Lugosi.

Van Helsing is arrested as they do not believe his tale of Vampires. Van helsing contacts an old friend Dr. Garth (Otto Kruger) to aid him. Garth agrees and soon meets a mysterious, dark haired woman who introduces herself as Countess Zaleska. She also seeks Garths aid but she wants release from her curse as a vampire, the daughter of Dracula!

When Garth figures out just what the Countess is he refuses to help but Zaleska and her servant Sandor kidnap Garth's assistant and take her back to Transylvania and Castle Dracula which we get to see again. Zaleska offers to release the woman only if Garth will allow her to turn him into a vampire and to live as her immortal lover.

This was an interesting movie. Gloria Holden as the countess was every bit as mysterious (well almost) as Lugosi with her aristocratic look and penetrating eyes. She was well-cast for the role. The film doesn't have the gothic atmosphere of the original but Director Lambert Hillyer infuses it with more sexuality including a rather strong (for the times) lesbian sequence where Zaleska invites a prostitute to her studio to pose rather provocatively and ends up killing her in a rather sexually charged scene.

Van Sloan is relegated to a rather minor role this time and his scenes are basically at the beginning and end of the film. Irving Pichel plays the very creepy servant Sandor and famed gossip columnist Hedda Hopper has a minor role as well. This is really Holden's movie, however. How exactly she is related to Dracula isn't explained but one can surmise that she isn't his daughter in the literal sense since she's mentioned to have died only one hundred years ago while Dracula had been dead for five hundred years. Holden is quite statuesque and mesmerizing in her performance and this is a very underrated sequel.

With 1943's ""Son of Dracula"" the Dracula series officially became 'b"" movie fodder as most of Universals horrors of the 1940's were. The movie opens with Count Alucard (Lon Chaney) coming to stay at the southern home of a wealthy and rather morbid heiress Katherine Caldwell (Louise Albritton) whom he met when she was in Hungary. Katherine has become smitten with the Count and after he kills her father, she asks only to be given the home, while all the rest of the estate can go to her sister Claire (Evelyn Ankers).

Katherine slips away to a nearby swamp as the Count's coffin rises from the depths of the swamp and he emerges in a cloud of mist which was a very effective special effect in its day. The two are married and Claire breaks the news to her fiancee Frank. Frank confronts them back at the house and tries to shoot the count, but the bullets simply pass through him, and kill Katherine who was standing behind. Soon Professor Brewster realizes that Alucard is Really Count Dracula and contacts a Hungarian professor Laszlo for assistance to help destroy the vampire.

Son of Dracula does have some things going for it. The additions to the vampire mythology of turning to mist is very effective and allows Dracula to sneak up on his enemies or to escape when Laszlo shows him a crucifix when Dracula tries to strangle Brewster. The film also shows Dracula levitating across the swamp which one makes the guess was basically his mist form given shape. Son doesn't have the gothic trappings of the original but the set pieces are still fairly effective. And of course any movie with Evelyn Ankers is always a treat.

Unfortunately a major drawback is star Lon Chaney Jr. While Chaney was fine playing the tortured Larry Talbot, Dracula is a role that requires much more charisma and presence, particularly sexual presence which Chaney was sorely lacking in. He comes off much too stiff and monotone in delivering his lines and there's not a hint of Hungarian accent to him.

Also there is no ""Son"" at all here. He proclaims himself as Dracula and while maybe this was intended to be more in title than literal, there was still no explanation on he being Dracula's son. But then, Continuity was never much of an important factor to Univeral back in those days.

Certainly no classic, it is one of Universal's better B movies of the 1940's. Call it 3 1/2 stars.",1111968000,,4838,4.686690223792698
1621404,3,B00005LC4J,"Look, this film picks up where Dracula ended (in more ways than one). Right after Van Helsing drives a steak through Drac (in the original film) this movie begins. After being arrested by Scotland Yard for Drac's ""murder"" Van Helsing never tries to contact John Harker or Professor and Mina Seward. Why not? Those three were alive at the end of film one and surely they could help Van Helsing prove Drac was inhuman. But they no longer figure into things by this movie. As for the rest of the film I hate the lesbian angle of Drac's daughter fixated on that pretty girl, Lily. Unless the filmmakers were saying that homosexuality is unholy (which it is according to the trusted Holy Bible), then I like it. Sexist attitudes (of a more traditional kind) against women abound in this film but hey it was made nearly 70 years ago so whaddya expect?",1098144000,,845,4.565789473684211
1621405,3,B00005LC4J,"Here you have the first two sequels to Universal's classic 1931 masterpiece Dracula; these two films could not be more different.  Dracula's Daughter is a surprisingly original and thought-provoking film, beginning where the original Dracula film stopped but going in a direction all its own.  Son of Dracula, on the other hand, has nothing to do with either of the two previous films apart from the name of Dracula, and the only threat posed by Lon Chaney, Jr., in the role of Count Alucard (that's Dracula backwards, a subterfuge that gives you a pretty good idea of the lack of intellect of Chaney's Dracula) is his supernatural ability to bore audiences to tears with his impossibly bland performance.
Dracula's Daughter presents us with the interesting proposition of Dracula's vampiric daughter longing to be freed of the curse that afflicts her.  With Dracula's death at the hands of Van Helsing, she seeks to free her mind from the influence of her nefarious father, actively seeking the aid of psychiatrist Dr. Garth (Otto Kruger), who just happens to be a former student of Van Helsing and the one man Van Helsing has called upon to help defend himself from the charge of murdering Count Dracula.  Countess Marya Zaleska (Gloria Holden) carries herself well and exudes a persona of aristocratic bearing and silent danger as she fights in vain to break away from the reality of her undead inheritance.  This film eventually takes us all the way back to Dracula's Castle in Transylvania and leaves the viewer with the sense that he/she has seen a worthwhile and surprisingly stimulating vampire film.
Son of Dracula, on the other hand, leaves the viewer with a sense of disappointment and disdain (which only manifests itself when the viewer actually awakens from the sleep-inducing stupor of the whole experience).  Not only is Lon Chaney, Jr., in his role as Count Alucard given a convoluted, boring script in which to work, he proves himself incapable of generating one ounce of spark from his performance.  Lon Chaney, Sr., may have been the studio's first choice to play Dracula back in 1931, but Chaney, Jr., is hopelessly unconvincing as 1943's Son of Dracula.  Viewers are treated to several (too many, actually) special effects shots of Alucard transforming himself to or from his bat form, and it soon becomes apparent that the fake vampire bat has more presence and personality than Chaney, Jr. musters up in the vampire's human form.
Both films are worth watching, if for no other reason than the fact that they are, after all, classic Universal ""monster"" films.  Dracula's Daughter is an interesting, enjoyably original type of film; some people even find Son of Dracula appealing - for reasons I can't possibly comprehend.  The only good thing I can say about Lon Chaney, Jr.'s portrayal of Count Alucard is that it helps show just how amazing a performance Bela Lugosi gave in Universal's original Dracula motion picture.",1084665600,,2944,4.989795918367347
1621406,3,B00005LC4J,"I really enjoyed Dracula's daughter.  The story revolves around the female lead trying to free herself of the vampire curse and it flowed really well.  It was nice to see a somewhat original story line tied in with Universal Dracula mythos rather than a rehashing of the same old story.  The female lead played her role quite well, and it was interesting to see a powerful female character in the time when most females leads were basically victims.  That's not to say that she wasn't a victim herself, as I did feel sorry for her at some points, but then her true nature would rise and show itself.
Son of Dracula wasn't as good for me.  I just had a hard time with Lon Chaney Jr. playing the role of Dracula with that pencil thin mustache.  He kept reminding me of a used car salesman.  I know he played almost all of the Universal monsters at some point, but he'll always be the Wolfman to me.  I like how the characters involved actually plotted to use Dracula's power against him.
