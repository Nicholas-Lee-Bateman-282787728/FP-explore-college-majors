1342070,4,B00004REOH,"Set 2 of THE SANDBAGGERS series is perhaps a cut above Set 1 - therefore, 4.5 stars.
We rejoin the career of Neil Burnside (Roy Marsden), the lonely, driven, insubordinate and brilliant Director of Operations for Britain's Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). Neil's fiefdom is small but crucial. He controls the ""Sandbaggers"", a select group of agents, no more than two or three, who are always on call to race to global points of crisis in MI6's struggle with the KGB and set thing aright. And sometimes they fail. However, this British television miniseries, which aired in 1978 and 1980, is not so much about Burnside's war with foreign adversaries as with those in London - his own boss, SIS Deputy Chief Peele (Jerome Willis), and the craven politicians in Whitehall and Number 10 Downing Street.
Of the six episodes in the set, perhaps the best is ""At All Costs"", wherein one of Neil's two Sandbaggers is caught in an espionage sting in Bulgaria, wounded by gunfire, and now lying alone, bleeding, and paralyzed in a Sophia safe house. For all his faults, Burnside is 100% committed to the safety of his agents. So now, in company with his last remaining Sandbagger, the Director takes the dangerous course, much to the keen displeasure of Peele and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, of going behind the Iron Curtain to Bulgaria's capital to get his man out.
I consider the least deserving episode is ""It Couldn't Happen Here"", which perhaps reflects the British scriptwriters' overly dramatic and sensationalistic view of America's penchant for guns and political assassination. In any case, Neil's CIA London colleague, Jeff Ross (Bob Sherman), who is usually quite level-headed, now comes across as a wild-eyed conspiracy theorist with the FBI as the Machiavellian villains. And U.S. senators drop like flies. To me, the episode was over the top.
In the last episode, ""Operation Kingmaker"", the MI6 Director General (""C"", Richard Vernon) is forced  into retirement with health problems. While considering his own career prospects and the fate of his department, Neil must now conspire to back the least unpalatable of two possible successors to C's chair. And no matter who gets the Prime Minister's nod, it's going to be dodgy going for Burnside in Set 3.
Marsden's Burnside is one of the most intriguing protagonists in recent memory. Undeniably wily and capable, he's also cold, ruthless and conniving. He's definitely the man you'd want running special operations for your government's foreign intelligence service, especially if you're the agent at the sharp end, but not a snake you'd want slithering through the grass at your garden party.
THE SANDBAGGERS is first rate entertainment. I look forward to viewing Set 3, the last, but shall be saddened when it's over.",1080432000,16,2783,5.06318082788671
1342071,5,B00004REOH,"The high quality of Sandbaggers 1 is totally maintained in Sandbaggers 2.  The acting is superb, the director holds a tight rein with his cast and knows how to work with the story, and the screenwriter continues to bedazzle (he will depart us in the next series (3) when he mysteriously disappears with pilot and plane over the wilds of Alaska, although 3 of the episodes will still have his artistry).
I do not know if Roy Marsden received any award for this series, but he certainly should have.  I can't think of a more apt word to describe his performance than ""Perfect.""  And I do not use that word loosely.
And so we get to know his character, Neil Burnside, better and better.  And we find that here is a man who will sacrifice anything in life, including those he loves most and his own character as a human being (and one does not doubt that even his own life may be added to this list) for his mission, a free world which at that time was threatened by the Soviets.  And Willie Cane, excellently played by Ray Lonnen, stays very close in his shadow.  Are these men extreme idealists (even heroes), or do they share a brutal psychopathology?  Perhaps both?  It is for the viewer to surmise.
So hold on to your living room chair, and keep a strong stomach, especially during the first episode, and the remaining episodes will continue to grasp your attention unto the final one, the most ironic of all of them.  It's worth the ride to see one of the finest espionage series of all time.",1075075200,12,1494,4.443223443223443
1342072,4,B00004REOH,"James Bond-like portrayal of the intelligence business may have broken new ground in its time, but the Sandbaggers series paints Bond into a corner as pure fantastic escapism.  Rather, the reality of the business is continual risk-taking, running through mazes whose wrong paths can be deadly, lack of support or understanding from those who most benefit from actions taken, a steady stream of surprises any of which might be the last, and yes, complete disavowal of one's mission should it fail.  The dialogue was written by intelligent people for like types, and while episode quality varies from B-- to A, each one has its poignant message(s) as well as drama.  Overall, one of the better picks for action/drama, though you will never see Bond in the same light again.",1059696000,5,771,4.961240310077519
1342073,5,B00004REOH,"As understated and gritty as only British drama could be, The Sadbaggers series is an excellent view into Cold War politics from the sharp end. What is lacking in special effects and the glitz associated with Hollywood productions is more than made up for by stellar performances by Roy Marsden and Ray Lonnen. Written by a former British intelligence agent who mysteriously disappeared during the run of the series, bringing it to an untimely end, the series takes a fingernail-chewing, edge-of-your-seat look at the men, and women, who were on the front lines of British foreign intelligence. A must see for fans of BritDrama and Cold War intrigue but it may, honestly, disappoint viewers who are expecting The Hunt for Red October or the escapism of James Bond.",1049760000,3,764,4.9765625
1342074,5,B00004REOH,"""At All Costs"" alone is worth the price of this set.  If you love TV which features crisp dialog, cunning expository writing, and flambouantly theatrical acting, this is for you.",1042156800,3,178,4.933333333333334
1342075,4,B00004REOH,"This story was written by a person that served in MI6.  This makes it very realistic.  This includes the politically skilled but espionage incompetent upper management that hamper the effectiveness of the agency.  (Called toadies in British slang.) It also includes morally grey area operations and the ambiguous situations the agents have to make decisions in.  There is a minor problem in the occasional interjection of very biased political statements in the character's mouths by the author.  This usually occurs in contrived situations that would not happen in real life.
The writer disappeared without a trace after the 3rd season and so there was no 4th season.  The last episode had to be written in an ambiguous way to connect with either no 4th season or with one.",1029456000,4,774,5.0078125
1342076,5,B00004REOH,"You can't imagine how excited I was to hear that ""The Sandbaggers"" was gloriously released on DVD!  I hope that now this program will receive the long-awaited praise and recognition it richly deserves.  Rarely do we see a TV show that recognizes that there are intelligent people out in the audience.  ""The Sandbaggers"" did just that, with excellent writing, excellent acting (Roy Marsden is brilliant!), and excellent direction.
I first came across ""The Sandbaggers"" when I was in junior high in the early 90's (I'm now 23).  I absolutely loved staying up late at night to watch the PBS Mystery programs on Fridays.  Back then, I'm sure most of the dialogue and plot went over my head, but I still enjoyed the show.
An exceptional show such as this might tempt people to do a remake of the series, but let's stop that thought right there.  This program's a classic.  Let's not tamper with greatness.
Due to the poor quality of the original material, the sound slightly fades in and out throughout the DVD series, but don't let that stop you from buying this gem.",1020902400,3,1063,4.713513513513513
1342077,5,B00004REOH,"Having never seen the Sandbaggers' series prior to getting the two boxed sets, I have never had the privilege of seeing the ""missing episode"" that would have (and should have) come at the end of the first series.  Although I am quite ticked off with the distributor for not including that episode and would dearly have loved to see it, I don't want anyone to be disuaded from getting this second set on that account.  The missing episode is indeed pivotal to the development of Neil Burnside's character and to the choices he makes in subsequent episodes, but one is still able to get a rough idea of what the nature of the ""special relationship"" was.  For one thing, the first episode of the second series opens with a brief recap of what happened at (I assume) the end of that missing episode.  For another thing, the nature of Burnside's relationship with a certain individual is alluded to often enough in the second series that one soon gets a clear enough picture.
Of course, it's not the same as actually seeing the episode (and I ought to mention that its omission is an oversight that has, I understand, been remedied on the DVD version).  Nevertheless, the omission of that episode in no way detracts from the quality of the episodes in this second series--at least it ought not to.  Each episode is an independent entity fully capable of being enjoyed on its own merits, and each is (once again) absolutely first-rate.
My advice is this:  If you've enjoyed the first series, by all means get the second series, for the episodes are every bit as intelligently-written and consummately-acted as those in the first series.  I'm not saying you won't be ticked off (as was I) at the omission of that one episode, but you will still enjoy the second series.  I highly recommend it!",1017273600,7,1786,4.662420382165605
1342078,4,B00004REOH,"Having never seen any of this series, I was captivated by the characters and story themes. You could begin to feel like you knew each character in a personal way.  The episodes were very realistic in their portrayal of  ""the Cold War"" espionage scene.  However, for a new viewer to  connect between Coll. 1 and 2 completely was not possible since the pivotal  episode,""Special Relationship"",was not inserted.  What a mistake!",964915200,7,425,5.0
1342079,4,B00004REOH,"This is an excellent show, and I'm glad it has finally made it to video.  The only disappointment I have is that between Collection 1 and Collection 2 (which are in episodic order thankfully), the episode ""Special  Relationship"" is missing.  This is a pivotal episode, and I hope it  makes it into the next collection.",955411200,6,318,4.7272727272727275
