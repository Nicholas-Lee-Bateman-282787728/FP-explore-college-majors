Packaging for the Incredible hulk, the episode booklet, the mini poster, 2 single sided discs, and I had worried as I had purchased the box set of the other Marvel 1966 heroes but this one includes the individual title pages with the recap. Although I was thinking the recaps are maybe not needed as the episode they recap is just before them on the disk I still like that they were included and I did want the 3 episode title pages. The theme song and closing music is at the beginning and end of the 3 episodes however, and I agree that works fine. This presentation may not be for everyone but then what is? If like me you are in region one all you should have to do is use your computer DVD and when inserted the program for viewing should pop up a screen asking if you want to change to region 2. You may be limited on changes so take note. I read that someone did not like that the recaps were not included on the others (Cap., Thor, Shell-head, and subby) but like I said, I didn't miss the recaps as much as the title screens. I hope others from the US see this, I know we have been waiting for the license people to get it together and let these out to us; funny, I had to go to the UK to get my Marvel Super-heroes. Hey, whatever works. so to recap, 5 stars for packaging, 5 for one sided disks, 5 for features, and 5 for the UK for getting them out, I would give all the above 10's if I could.  In conclusion; as Stan would say, EXCELSIOR!

The Thor in the box set is 2 dvds and the complete series (13 episodes), with the exception of the sub-set title screens and the recaps. But instead of playing like 3 - 7 minute episodes it plays like an 18 minute episode. To recap you get basically the 39 mini episodes.
Between the 4 in the box set ( Cap, Thor, Ironman, Sub-mariner) and the Incredible Hulk set I like them both.",1226620800,,1888,4.127717391304348

7885937,4,6305251517,"From what I've seen of this reissue series (Thor and Hulk), it's a great example of exuberantly shoddy Sixties science fiction - in terms of lovable cheeziness it compares well with Star Trek, its hallowed contemporary. In  fact, I suspect Bruce Banner's lab and Doc McKoy's sick bay shared a few  sound effects.
Everything about the cartoons is laughable by today's  standards, of course, but that's what makes them so darn funny. Hercules'  dialogue had me flopping off the couch in tears, slack with laughter. And  the fights aren't as goofy as you'd expect, either!
Good stuff.",947462400,5,581,4.948453608247423
7885938,3,6305251517,"The latest round of Marvel Super Heroes video releases by Fox Home Video missed a golden opportunity by not realizing the audience for these videos.  Released twice before (as kiddie videos) by Prism Entertainment in 1985  and Best Film and Video in 1992, I can tell you first hand that modern kids  don't like these the way 1966-68 kids did.  Instead, Fox should release  these as a comic collector's edition targeting the original audience now  grown up.  This Thor tape is an adaptation of the comic books,  ""Journey into Mystery"" #124 & 125 (Enter Hercules) and  ""Journey Into Mystery"" 103 & 104 (Battle of the Gods).  The  art is recognizable as that of Jack Kirby, Don Heck, and Joe Sinnott.  The  animation is bad, but the art is great as are the voice characterizations.  Fox should look for the entire ""Marvel Super Heroes"" tv series  including the original ""Merry Marvel Marching Society"" theme song  and make a proper box set with historical notes and credits to the writers,  artists and voice actors.  Each is an adaptation of a silver-age comic  book.  They have no kid value, but these videos do have historical value if  Fox would work a little harder.  I saw these cartoons originally on  ""Captain Satellite"" from KTVU San Francisco, and KCRA in  Sacramento in 1966.  Fox really missed the boat.  These videos have value,  but not for the kids of today.  How about a box set Fox?  Do it right!",927849600,25,1410,4.68724279835391
