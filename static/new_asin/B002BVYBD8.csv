8361987,3,B002BVYBD8,"First off Mark John Sternal is a very good instructor and does teach in a real basic way and uses as very simple style of playing. I don't feel the material in this DVD is worth the $8.00 I paid unlike the Easy Metal Guitar DVD, but on that note it would have been a better buy to have had the material on the Easy Guitar tricks DVD included with or on the Easy Metal Guitar DVD. Also what is lacking on both DVD's is a downloadable PDF file of the riffs. In order to practice the riffs over and over you have to watch the DVD's over and over. The one really good thing I like about both DVD's is how you can work through the material at a slow, medium and fast pace. I was also hoping to learn how to do a unison bend as I seem to have a hard time with that, but he did not demonstrate that. I did like the taping material. So I give the DVD 3 stars.",1269302400,9,851,3.840909090909091
