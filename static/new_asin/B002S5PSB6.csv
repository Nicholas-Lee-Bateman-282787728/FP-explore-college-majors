8379093,5,B002S5PSB6,was purchased as a gift.  No complaints,1423440000,,39,4.571428571428571
8379094,1,B002S5PSB6,"Don't bother with the public domain episodes of ""The Lucy Show."" You're throwing away your money. The audio and video quality isn't very good. Buy the official season releases of ""The Lucy Show."" We already have seasons one through three out. Season four should be out sometime in March 2011. You won't believe the difference between the shabby quality of the public domain episodes and the unbelievable quality of the official releases. It's like they were filmed a month ago. In addition you get great bonus features. So stop buying the same 30 episodes. I was fooled twice and decided to wait for the real thing.",1291420800,,615,4.811320754716981
8379095,1,B002S5PSB6,Yet another rip off with the same old 16mm scratchy transfers under the guise of public domain.  Wait for the legitimate CBS/Paramount season sets with beautfiul new transfers and awesome bonus features.,1256860800,3,203,5.34375
