8271285,5,B0018UCLGC,"I came to Amazon.com because I wanted to buy the movie.  I loved its twists and turns with believable characters and a great plot.  But it's not available here for a USA format.  I saw it on TV because they [stupidly] said on cable that it was in Norwegian because I can understand Norwegian,  It's in Finnish of course, a very original tongue that is not Scandinavian at all.  It was refreshing to see them speaking superb English when they were talking to ""foreigners"" who were NOT American or British.  I sat next to a Finnish woman last night in a Morrocan Restaurant, so I was in a Finnish mood anyway. The acting was so good, and the outcome was unexpected. I really want to own it.",1301097600,,688,4.377952755905512
8271286,3,B0018UCLGC,"A wife realizes her professor hubby is seeing a young student of his.  She decides to follow said student.  Seeing that the girl runs a jujitsu class, wife naturally enrolls and begins to learn the art of fighting.  She also befriends the girl.  The screws tighten as we wait for the wife to spring her trap on her husband and his lover.  ""Black Ice"" is beautifully photographed and the nuance of the plot lines don't bludgeon you over the head like our typical Hollywood fare.  There's more emotion, doubt, and overall anxiety going on beneath the surface of the wife than just plain revenge.  Definitely one to purchase...if you can it find for less than what that one Amazon monopoly Scandinavian DVD retailer sells all of his overpriced DVDs at (hey, not naming names, but you can figure it out).",1285545600,2,800,4.671428571428572

Black Ice is one of the worst and most disturbing attempts at film that I have ever come across.  The movie was produced by Abortion Bin Productions on a $1600 budget.  The film looks as though it was shot using a 1980's video camera, the acting is awful, and the use of color filters make certain scenes difficult to make out.

Now that it's been established that the production quality of the film is abysmal, on to the plot itself.  Black Ice is the story of Evelyn, a young woman who becomes a psychotic murderer after losing her virginity.  There's plenty of nudity in this film, lots of gore, numerous sex scenes that are borderline porn, and a serious bit of necrophilia.  Evelyn rapes another woman, performs oral sex on a frozen severed corpse penis, and makes love to a monster with a goat's skull for a head.

The entire cast doubles as the film's crew, and has virtually no experience in film.  That's with the exception of Sadie Atkins, who has previously appeared in such movies as Chloroformed Girls  , Naked and Struggling, and Beautiful Barefoot Girls (I'm not making this up).  The only redeeming quality of this two-hour movie is that the score, mostly piano compositions and electric guitar, is actually decent.  I also appreciate the fact that a gorgeous full-figured woman, J.C. Howe (aka Jessie Howe), was cast as Evelyn.

Some movies are made just for shock value, only they tend to be shot with a decent budget.  Black Ice's cinematography is terrible, and the story is pointless.  It's tasteless, it's offensive, and it's little more than soft porn for fans of necrophilia.",1269043200,3,1721,4.766891891891892
