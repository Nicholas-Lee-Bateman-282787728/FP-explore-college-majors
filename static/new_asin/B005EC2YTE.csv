8468111,1,B005EC2YTE,"I purchased this set along with another set offered from Direct Source and all can say is they should be ashamed of putting these terrible looking and bad audio movies out on DVD ,not a single one of the six films on these DVDs are worth watching well one film Border Shootout has a okay picture  but it is a very poor film ,the other films have terrible color saturation and sometimes a very black looking hard to see whats happening picture,so save your money and don't waste it on any Direct Source DVDs.",1377302400,,507,4.3936170212765955
