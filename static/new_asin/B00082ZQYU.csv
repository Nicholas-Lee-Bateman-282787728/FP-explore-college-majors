The descriptions of the settings in the Nebraska winters are so realistic that I was cold reading this in 90 degree weather!
I look forward to reading this author's other books, The Middle Man and Tower Maker.",1351036800,,461,4.634146341463414

2257001,5,B00082ZQYU,"It's no spoiler to let you know this is a tragic short story.  You're signalled from the very beginning, first by the pacing and look of the scenes, and then by the very dialogue from the pivotal character.  And I believe that this was intended by the original author, Stephen Crane, that you have a good idea of how the story will end, and the value is in watching and realizing why things happen this way.
This film from the American Short Story series is based on a classic Stephen Crane short story.  A Swedish taylor along with a cowboy and a journalist stop over at a hotel in Nebraska during a blizzard.  To pass the time, the hotel keeper's son challenges the group to a game of cards.  It becomes evident during the game that the taylor is a very fearful person, convinced that the west is like that portrayed in dime novels, populated only by violent men.  The combination of his fear and the reactions of the others leads to tragedy, and it's for the viewer to analyze and decide why this all occurs, whether it is the fault of the taylor or of the others.
David Warner as the Swede shines in his role, but each actor carries his role brilliantly.  The pacing of the drama is slow and somber.  And sound is used very effectively.  The clinking of the music box, the sound of the cards being dealt during the game.",1028246400,9,1324,4.371428571428571

8055382,4,B00082ZQYU,"I swear I read a different blurb for the video than the one that is there now. The one I read didn't understand the story.

That being said, I like Stephen Crane. I hadn't read this one, though. My conclusion is that the Swede was irrational from his fear. Then he got drunk besides. He was a menace. The cheating was an angry reaction to the way the Swede was behaving; but, it was irrelevant because they weren't playing for money.",1473897600,,433,4.345679012345679

8055387,3,B00082ZQYU,"I noticed that some of the reviews for this film are actually reviews of the book. Something obviously got mixed up somewhere. I am thinking that I might have greater appreciate for the book, actually. I just could not get into this film - I wanted to - couldn't. I give it 3 stars... for just ok.",1435881600,,297,4.228070175438597
8055388,3,B00082ZQYU,"Short stories already jump off the page, making a movie in the mind. So it's a challenge to take the 28 pages of Stephen Crane's The Blue Hotel and put two minutes per page onto the screen. A young James Keach (brother of Stacy Keach) plays straight man Johnnie Scully to David Warner's paranoid, fickle weirdness as ""The Swede"". In this mixture of Agatha Christie plot, Western setting, and unreasonably low excitement, director Jn Kadr teases us into thinking we'll be getting Ingmar Bergman. But no, it's just a made-for-TV movie. Western tragedy, smaller than life.",1416182400,2,569,4.9375
8055389,4,B00082ZQYU,FIlm follows short story. ONly a few changes! FIlm was better than story. The film shows how people can create events with their attitudes.,1367798400,,139,4.833333333333333
