975711,5,6305180261,"For true Guns N' Roses fans, this is a must have. Watch all of the classic videos from the original lineup through the Use Your Illusion lineup with Gilby, Matt, Dizzy, and the ladies singing backup. Axl's machine had to keep growing (I assume to keep in step with his ego), but by the end, that Use Your Illusion Tour lasted 2 years plus, because it took two years just to break even! But these videos are classic. The trilogy is here: Don't Cry, November Rain, and Estranged, and they are truly great videos. November Rain, Estranged, and Welcome To The Jungle have always been my favorite videos the band made. Even a couple of deep cuts, like Garden Of Eden, and Since I Don't Have You (with a cameo by Gary Oldman!), along with Dead Horse. Wow. All in all, a great collection. And I hear that Axl is releasing Apettite For Democracy 3D in movie theaters this summer. So for you fans of the ""new"" Gn'R, you can see it on the big screen.",1420502400,,940,4.346590909090909

975978,5,6305180261,"Welcome to the Videos by Guns and Roses, well really Axl Rose's performance in front of the Camera is an amazing show in itself.  Of course the Video is the Bands performances that would warrant keeping around, I'm sure there are more!  This is an Amazing Show.  I came along long before Guns and Roses and was not privy to their shows and never went to see them live.  I would say, I'd never been a adamant fan by any standard.  I am now.  Axy Rose is old and Fat now, probably barely alive compared to what he could do in his prime.  One cannot burn their candle at both ends without costing themselves something.  Some in the trade die long before they should and he surely will pass before he should and we wish he could at least stay viable while we see him still around.  Saul Hudson, better known by his nickname Slash, is still kicking around and one of the best of his profession, as is Jeffrey Dean Isbell, known by his stage name Izzy Stradlin, Michael Andrew ""Duff"" McKagan and at this writing as far as I know, Steven Adler also.  This is a wonderful DVD showing the talents of the Band.",1373241600,2,1100,4.296116504854369

976082,5,6305180261,"If you're a GN'R fan like me I think you should definitely consider adding this to your collection.

I love almost every video on it (except for the last one that's some really old cover song).  Also not a fan of ""Gaden of Eden"" in which Axl tries to sing as fast as humanly possible for no apparent reason.  Otherwise it's exceptional.

If you're reading this you almost certainly view GN'R as one of the greatest metal bands of all time.  I'd rate Axl as one of my two favorite male singers/performers.  Bruce Dickinson is the only guy I feel can manage to surpass Axl's stunning talent.",1271808000,,589,4.457943925233645
976083,4,6305180261,This DVD contains every G N'R video ever made with the exception of You Could Be Mine. This is a great collector's item which Guns N' Roses fans will be sure to enjoy. This DVD contains videos the band made that were never aired on the music channels and this was a real treat. I would give this DVD five stars but they failed to include You Could Be Mine which is one of my favorite videos. Overall good buy.,1262822400,2,409,4.125

976268,3,6305180261,"Why is ""You Could Be Mine"" not included here?  Maybe it's related to Arnold or the song being in the movie, but it's very unsatisfying to watch this and see no YCBM on it.  Also, I wish Sweet Child O'Mine could have been the full version of the song (without the truncated intro), but that's not the band's fault I would guess, but the record label.  Anyway, this is a standard DVD so it looks lame in terms of picture quality, but converted to 320x240 AVC and playing on my PSP it looks great!",1199145600,,494,4.23404255319149

This is the group that showed even metal could have top hits. It's too bad that personalities caused the group's collapse with the original members when their music was at its best.

No booklet (which is usual for DVD's). Not even internal cover art.

No extras. No interview footage. No insight into the creative process.

If you don't like the style of the first part of this review you may not like the idea of this release. Or the lack of one. What annoys me is that it would of been good to have had something other than the songs to entertain the viewer with. That might of been a nice idea. Or they could of made this a double disc and transferred the Makin' videos series onto DVD to add value. It probably would of been a nice idea. They could of used some of the millions they've earned off the buying public to put some extra value into this release with at least a booklet or something. Or some behind the scenes footage from the making of some of these videos. Now THAT would of been a really nice idea.

I wholeheartedly recommend buying this DVD for the sheer brilliance of the enclosed hard rock/heavy metal music. You simply can't go past the visceral Welcome to the Jungle, the simply brilliant Sweet Child O' Mine or the genius of concept with November Rain. You can't but nod your head in appreciation of a band that was swimming in money still coming out with videos like The Garden or Dead Horse or having the intestinal fortitude to try something like Estranged.

My issue is not with the music, but the lacklustre packaging and almost arrogance of the powers that be that we'll buy this no matter what. And you know what grates? That they are right. This is really great music and some great video making with ideas and soul. It's a pity this package didn't have some. Actually, don't buy it. Download it.",1195171200,3,1720,4.447619047619048

Unfortunetly, You Could Be Mine was not included, nor is there any interviews or behind the scenes of the videos.

976428,5,6305180261,"...a few complaints. This is a direct copy of the VHS tape and there is no remastered audio or video. (5.1 surround and a less grainy image would have been nice.) There are no special features, although is anyone really surprised that the band didn't get together for a commentary?

If you don't have the VHS tape this is a good thing to get, regardless of its mediocre quality. It's better than watching them on MTV, no? The interactive menus are better than I expected, anyway. At least some thought was put into it.

The videos themselves? Ace stuff, even if the Use Your Illusion videos got a bit pretentious. And although I love Estranged, the video represents GN'R at their most commercial.

WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE -- GN'R at their most hair metal, this video is raw and loud; awesome stuff. Jim Carrey spoofed it in the fifth Dirty Harry film, ""THE DEAD POOL.""

SWEET CHILD O' MINE - My favorite GN'R song and video, if only because it was my first. Axl's dancing is cool.

PARADISE CITY -- Great song, but I've never cared much for the video. Goes on a bit too long with the same stuff.

DON'T CRY -- Good video. A bit too much though.

NOVEMBER RAIN -- Their second best.

ESTRANGED -- Brilliant song, very good video, just a bit too ""clean"" and un-GN'R'ish at times.

THE GARDEN -- The only music video where they aren't shown performing the song. A seedy trip through Sin City, so to speak.

GARDEN OF EDEN -- Loud, silly fun - I love it.

DEAD HORSE -- Very cool, Axl plays guitar.

LIVE AND LET DIE -- Another UYI music video. I wish they'd made more Appetite ones, but this is still good.

SINCE I DON'T HAVE YOU -- The worst GN'R video. Gary Oldman plays Misery, and it's an embarrassing ordeal. It almost ruins the song, which is great.

If you're a fan of GN'R you should get this collection because it's a must-own, simple enough. The only two videos it doesn't feature are You Could Be Mine (from the T2 soundtrack) and the X-rated It's So Easy (which featured S&M stuff and was banned or something). I downloaded those two off Limewire, You Could Be Mine is absolutely awesome. Hopefully once the legal issues are settled in the future (if ever?) they'll be included on a new re-issue of the DVD. Perhaps by then the ex-bandmembers will have all made up and we'll be treated to a commentary. But oh hell, who am I kidding? We have a better chance of a Chinese Democracy. (Ha, I'm so clever.)",1118361600,18,2410,4.423076923076923
976429,4,6305180261,"A nice summary of what GNR did with their music videos back when they were together as a band producing rocking tunes, Welcome To The Videos has the classic videos that sent GNR on top of the world as stars, and also their Use Your Illusion videos, some of which in a sense depict their decline in popularity.

Obviously Welcome To The Jungle, Sweet Child and Paradise City are all classic. Patience may be the ultimate video in this set, with the great shots of Slash strumming the guitar, and Axl swaying back in forth for his classic lyrical deliveries. Now let's take a look at our Illusion videos. It really is a crying shame that they were blown apart from criticism with these truly incredible releases, but at least the music is still alive. As for the videos from that era, they weren't all that great. For example November Rain, although as sensational a song it is, is criticized for being a corny video, and I wouldn't disagree. Garden Of Eden is also a waste of time with the video, a good screecher, but with little work gone into the video itself. Don't overlook the DVD though, featuring the classic Estranged, a very heart felt song, moving in so many aspects. Knockin' On Heaven's Door could've been better, but Live And Let Die certainly marks the spot as does The Garden and Don't Cry.

In summary, the videos are fairly strong, however, in a sense this is a troubling release for the fact that as a viewer, you're forced to rely on each and every video to be classic due to the lack of content. Extras definitely should've filled up a seperate disc with interviews, and maybe some live excerpts to treat fans. Overall, recommended to diehards for purchase, and it should be rented by other GNR fans or rock n' roll lovers.",1118275200,2,1743,4.547770700636943

Probably my favourite GN'R song is ""Estranged"", and the elaborate video makes for a very enjoyable musical and visual experience. The only disappointing thing about this DVD is the lack of any extras whatsoever! In addition to this (or is ""addition"" an oxymoron in this case? Should I put the thesaurus away?) the video for ""You Could Be Mine"" is absent. Apart from this fairly minor criticism, Welcome to the Videos rocks.",1113696000,,587,4.547169811320755

All my other music DVDs have much more on them and I wouldn't say it was a waste of money but some more things should've been put into this package.

976529,4,6305180261,"Let me start off my review by saying that I am a huge music buff, and the first time I ever heard Guns 'n Roses' 1987 album ""Appetite For Destruction"", I was inspired to keep up on my music studies.  So, even though Guns 'n Roses is not popular anymore, considering the fact that every member of Guns 'n Roses working on their new album is a replacement member of G&R (except for Axl Rose),""Welcome To The Videos"" is a great treat for all fans of Guns 'n Roses.  This DVD has thirteen videos that Guns 'n Roses shot, all of which are great.  While ""Welcome To The Jungle"" remains the best song by Guns 'n Roses, the best video on this DVD is ""The Garden"", which is the exact same thing as ""Welcome To The Jungle""- except it is about New York instead of Los Angeles.  Also, Shannon Hoon sings background vocals on this song, and Alice Cooper even makes a few apppearances on this song singing lead vocals.  The only video on here that should not have made the cut was the video for ""Garden of Eden"", and other than the fact that this DVD is missing the videos for ""Civil War"", ""It's So Easy"", and ""You Could Be Mine"", this DVD is still excellent.  Sometimes you might even get a behind the scenes fact for each video before/after they show the video.  Also,look for cameo appearances in some of these videos by Dave Navarro, Pamela Anderson, and Gary Oldman.  Another interesting thing worth mentioning about this DVD is that in some, not all of these videos, Axl Rose either looks like Dana Strum (the bass player for Slaughter), David Lee Roth, David Spade, Kurt Cobain, or Jon Bon Jovi(no,I'm not kidding), and you will even get to see some of Rose's childhood pictures in the video for ""Live and Let Die"". In addition to this DVD I also recommend Van Halen's ""Video Hits Volume One"" DVD.  I am glad that this DVD was released.  This is a good collection of Guns 'n Roses videos any G&R fan will like.  Axl Rose should be the next President of the USA!",1110326400,,1954,4.370165745856354

The videos are as amazing now as they were when I was a kid.  ""You Could Be Mine"" is the only video missing, which I imagine is because it had clips from Terminator 2, and there was probably something about rights.  Anyway, the only really disappointing thing about this collection (which it seems is everyone's peeve with this DVD) is that there are absolutely NO extras on this disc.

976691,3,6305180261,"Oh we remember it well, the day 'Appetite for Destruction' was released. Everyone everywhere thought Guns n Roses would be long lasting like Aerosmith or the Rolling Stones. We can only look back now and laugh (or cry). For a band that had so much potential, everything went wrong. They were possibly the last band that had a shot of having a thirty year career. This DVD shows all the videos this band made during their all too brief existance.
The problem is, the videos are in chronological order. Is this a bad thing? For Guns n Roses it is. When a band releases a debut album that they can never live up to, and you see rotating band members, and Axl getting sillier and weirder, the interest in this collection wanes as the songs go on.
The first three, Welcome to the Jungle, Sweet Child O' Mine, and Paradise City show the classic lineup, the best the band ever had to offer. Then we get Patience. An accustic number that Guns released to appease fans that were anxiously waiting for 'Appetite II"". Well from here on out we get the Illusion videos. New drummer (what is he like 50 years old?), new guitar player, keyboardist (who the hell are these people?)

976694,4,6305180261,"I am, and always will be, a monster fan of Guns N' Roses. As a 16 year old listening to ""Appetite For Destruction"" in 1987, I thought the sky was the limit for this band. They were young and talented, and I was convinced they would become one of the greatest acts in rock n' roll history, and not just the hard rock genre. To me, Axl Rose was the next John Lennon. He seemed to possess it all- a unique voice, exceptional songwriting skills , and a captivating stage presence. Unfortunately, he and the other band members never lived up to the promise of ""Appetite For Destruction""- internal tension, drug use, and the increasingly egotistical behavior of Rose ultimately resulted in a complete implosion of the original lineup. These days, only Rose remains, and there has not been a new Guns N' Roses album in more than ten years,as fans of the original GN'R find it difficult to refer to Rose's new lineup as Guns N' Roses.
The ""Welcome To The Videos"" collection has been available on VHS since 1998, but finally hit DVD in 2003. The best videos are from the early, ""Appetite"" era- watching ""Welcome To The Jungle"" brought me all the way back to 1987, at least temporarily. Back then, the band was hungry, living the true ""sex, drugs, and rock n' roll"" lifestyle. Guns N' Roses took over MTV in the spring of 1988 with the video for ""Sweet Child O' Mine"", which catapulted the band into mainstream America, and both the single and the ""Appetite"" LP to number one on the charts. GN'R closed out the 80's with clips for ""Paradise City"" and ""Patience"", and as the 90's approached, GN'R seemed ready to lay claim as one of the great rock bands of all time.
The two ""Use Your Illusion"" albums, released in September 1991, spawned nine videos, including ""You Could Be Mine"" which does not appear in this collection, likely because it contained several clips from the film ""Terminator 2"". The videos for ""Don't Cry"", the epic ""November Rain"", and ""Estranged"" attempt to form some kind of three part story. None of them make complete sense, but ""Rain"" is gorgeous to look at. Prominently featured in the clip is model Stephanie Seymour, Axl Rose's then-girlfriend. However, these videos and the others from the ""Illusion"" albums reflect the changes occurring within the band; two original members were gone by then, and the once ferocious intensity which carried Guns N' Roses to the top in 1988 was slowly but steadily in decline. Videos for ""The Garden"", ""Dead Horse"", and ""Garden Of Eden"" are all throwaways, without any memorable images. None of those songs were released as singles, so why were there videos for them? Worst of all is the band's final video effort, ""Since I Don't Have You"", from ""The Spaghetti Incident"". Featuring actor Gary Oldman as the devil, the video presents the band members frolicking on a beach with women, while Rose is tied up and gagged for some reason. It essentially completes the band's downfall- no longer hungry, GN'R were now rich and uninspired, a trend which still carries on as fans continue to wait for Rose to release ""Chinese Democracy"", complete with new band members, delayed since 1999. This video collection garners four out of five stars from me, based on the strength of Guns N' Roses early videos and ""November Rain"". I'll always love the music of Guns N' Roses, but definitely not all the videos.",1072828800,13,3346,4.7213675213675215

976872,5,6305180261,"I agree with Michael Zoglio -- the exclusion of ""You Could Be Mine"" is disappointing.  Chances are they had trouble clearing rights to footage from Terminator 2:  Judgment Day (which is now distributed by Artisan, I believe), which had been used liberally in the video, since the promotional value of ""You Could Be Mine"" has long passed.  Too bad, because that was a great Guns N' Roses on-camera performance.
There's still tons of great music video filmmaking here.  ""Sweet Child O'Mine"" is a bare-bones performance video, but superior because it's free of the hyperactive post-modern techniques that characterize music videos today.  And I seem to remember the girl in the video is Axl's ex, Erin Everly, who had inspired the original song.  ""Welcome to the Jungle"" is chaos incarnate, with Axl's prominent hairdo and psychotic performance sending the song over the top.  ""Patience"" has Slash's pet snake and Axl's subdued studio performance, ""Don't Cry"" began the band's experimentation with narratives in its videos, and of course ""November Rain"" is one of the greatest videos ever made, with a grand stage performance (Axl doing his Elton John, sitting at the piano with Roger McGuinn-flavoured 'granny' sunglasses) juxtaposed with beautifully shot narrative footage, and the dizzyingly gorgeous Stephanie Seymour.  The small moments in this video (Seymour licking wedding cake from Axl's finger, best man Slash losing the wedding ring) were beautiful to behold, and Slash's guitar solo outside a hilltop church is still rock n' roll at its most sweeping.
Guns N' Roses were one of the great on-camera performance bands of its time and this DVD release was long overdue.  Essential music-video viewing.",1068249600,3,1707,5.2463235294117645

A casual fan of the GREAT SONGS & MUSIC these videos represent would enjoy it, but then...
Where is You could be mine??? Don't Cry (alternate Lyrics)?
This is just a plain rehash of the VHS and they did not even care to enhance the sound a bit.  Dolby? well, the VHS is also on Dolby Stereo.
Wouldn't have it been great if they had added some commentary by ""the band"" or at least the video directors, since ""the band"" is made up on one loose brained guy who cannot even fulfill a overhyped tour.
Ok, but what about adding previously released material like the Making F&*#ing vVideos Series (available on VHS).
Anyway.. if you have cared about G N' R on the last ten years, you must be already used to being ripped off, and love give Mr. Rose some more money for hos lunatic paranoid, drug-, shrink-addicted years.
Advice?  Not neccesary, if you still care about GN""R, I repeat, you are used to being ripped off.  But if you did not tape any of these videos on mTV while they were OVERplayed a decade ago, or did not get sick to death of watching them, or did not purchase the equivalent VHS release, and you have 15 bucks to throw away, they get this.  I was dying to get it, expecting ANYTHING more than the VHS release has... but now, I guess I'd rather go into my old cardboard box and look for those old taped MTV shows... if I have even 15 minutes to throw into this ""band"".",1067299200,4,1808,4.305882352941176

Although he became more of an introvert throughout the 1990s, Axl Rose is an amazing songwriter and a creative genius.  You can see the natural progression from their first videos like ""Welcome To The Jungle"", ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" and ""Paradise City"" with their natural rawness to the deeper, more in-depth hits like ""Don't Cry"", ""November Rain"", and ""Estranged"".

As a  matter of fact, the videos attached to these songs helped me understand  them better. I really liked the dolphins in Estranged! This video brought  back some really good memories and I'm hoping GNR will overcome their  personal differences and start recording again. Of course, being a true Axl  fan, I enjoyed seeing him in the videos but most of all, appreciate his  song writing ability and his ability to express himself in a sensitive way,  especially in estranged. The quality of this video is excellent.  There is  concert footage, but the songs are as they were recorded on the albums they  came from.

977145,5,6305180261,"First, I'd like to address a brief comment to the troglodytes that felt it necessary to 'review' the video and give it one star.  While there are always twits online, I find it especially offensive when they purport to  review something they've never seen, could not understand, and are unable  to access -- and then trash it for all to see.
  Guns N' Roses is not a  band for little boys who 'wanna be bad' -- it's a very grown up band, and  the lyrics are some of the best I've ever heard. Complex, emotionally rich,  layered with observations about the difficulties of life, emotional pain,  the confusion that plagues us all at different times -- all of this,  powered by Axl Rose's brilliant voice (which can sound like a dozen  different voices, his range and ability to alter his sound is well nigh  incredible) and the power of the music, particularly, of course, Slash's  guitar.  Not to give short shrift to the rest of the band, they too give  the music its uniquely powerful sound.
  If one is a bland,  conservative, individual wearing blinders that allow him to see nothing but  'good = guy in a suit' and 'bad = long hair and tattoos' then one will not  listen or appreciate Guns N'Roses.  One of the reviewers apparently was of  this ilk -- he couldn't see past an appearance that disturbed his deeply  middle class bourgeois values.
  If, however, you don't give a whit  about the length of someone's hair (what possible relevance could hair  length have to musical ability?) or whether the individual has a penchant  for obtaining tattoos (and why would one care about that either?  Tattoos  are a *personal* choice.  Not a musical judgment, for christ's sakes), then  one CAN listen and CAN _hear_ the brilliance.  November Rain.. Estranged..  Don't Damn Me.. Listen to the lyrics.  Every single song, every single  video, all brilliant.  W. Axl Rose is indeed a 'genius' (I mean that as  more than hyperbole, he is certifiably brilliant, IQ wise, any way you wish  to look at it) and the lyrics to the songs show that brilliance just as a  tiffany setting shows the brilliance of a well cut diamond solitaire.
  My only hope is that with the current lineup, the new material will have  the power of the old, and I deeply wish that the band would go back to its  old line up -- surely the individuals who left to pursue individual  projects now realize that they aren't getting anywhere very quickly (not to  insult them, it is merely that this group of people make incredible music  TOGETHER).  Even Slash's 'Snakepit' leaves one feeling not quite fulfilled.  The guitar is brilliant, but where are the stunning vocals, the raw power  and catharsis of that voice?  The same problem, I fear, will emerge when  the new material comes out.  We will have Axl's vocals.. but without  Slash's guitar, who knows what they'll sound like.

My review of the  video?  Highest possible, buy it and watch it often, read the words, learn  them by heart, sing along at the top of your voice in your car with the  Guns N' Roses CDs on.  My review of the band?  The *best* band that ever  was.. and my musical tastes are very wide and varied indeed.  Still, if I  had to pick a winner, it would be, it always would have to be, Guns N'  Roses as it existed either at the time of Appetite for Destruction, or  later during Illusions l and ll - Let's see those lineups back, and ASAP.  Buy this video.  You will not be sorry, and if its for the Guns N' Roses  fan in your life.. they will love you forever and be stunned at your wisdom  and good taste in gift giving. :)
