8313564,5,B000REMUO8,"As someone who likes jazz and has for many years, I found this tape and the companion Volume 2 to be welcome additions to my collection.  If you don't like Playboy, don't let that deter you from giving this festival a look.  Many of the segments can be found on Youtube, which provides a way of previewing the tape contents.  The festival was in 1982, but the tapes were released in 1984 so there may be some variation as to dates.",1270425600,,431,4.296296296296297
