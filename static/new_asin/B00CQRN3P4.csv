5735100,5,B00CQRN3P4,I don't think I can add anything to all the great reviews . . . but it seems like almost a miracle to see a  movie where the hero is an actual boy instead of yet another anthropomorphic character. Something that both my daughter and son can enjoy without resulting in more requests for princess dress ups.,1447372800,,305,4.350877192982456
