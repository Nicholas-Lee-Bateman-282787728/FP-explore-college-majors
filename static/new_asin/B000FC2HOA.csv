8120630,4,B000FC2HOA,"The vast majority of musicians perform through a crafted persona. Very few entertainers are genuine enough to be the same person both on and off stage. Johnny Cash was such a music maker and another was Ali Farka Toure. As Marc Huraux's film shows, Ali Farka Toure was the same man when recording in Europe, touring in the US and attending to his mayoral duties in Mali. Not a biography, this film documents Huraux's brief time with 'the African John Lee Hooker.'

The film showcases a healthy helping of live performances. At its heart, ""A Visit to Ali Farka Toure"" features many revealing conversations. At home or in bush bars, riding in cars or boats, Toure shares many of his life experiences and aspirations. Occasionally, the director injects insightful commentary while helpful subtitles translate Toure's words into English.

8120631,5,B000FC2HOA,"While most people do recognize that the Blues and Rock & Roll have West African roots and origins, the profundity of this fact is often underestimated. This DVD does a lot to present a type of African music not commonly thought of (i.e. not drumming). In following Ali ""Farka"" Toure around and in interviewing him, it is plain to see how integral this music is to the culture it emerges from. I would recommend that any fan of American music procure a copy of this film so that they may attain some completeness in their knowledge on the subject.",1162857600,5,546,4.525252525252525
