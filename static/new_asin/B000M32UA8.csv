8165914,5,B000M32UA8,I practiced martial arts for a long time devoutly. WuDang Tai Chi is the best style I ever came across. Good video for beginner.,1451779200,,128,4.375
8165915,5,B000M32UA8,"The master in this and the other esoteric series, is Grand master  YOU XUAN DE, he is the 14 generation descendent of wudang san feng sect, and was Master's Zhong Yun Long, kung fu brother...for the beginner in wudang kung fu, there was NOT an  ""authentic"" thousand years of wudang techniques....the one who said that is lying...the wudang temples were empty in the early 1980's and there was ONLY 1 old monk living there, after the shaolin temple revival (following jet li's 1982 movie, there were around 5 monks living at shaolin also), they brought martial artists from around china to teach martial arts at the temples....2 of the earlier monks at wudang, the venerable  Guo Gaoyi and Zhu Chende were 13 generation, before them, there was a missing generation... Guo Gaoyi was the master of Grand master  YOU XUAN DE and of Master's Zhong Yun Long both 14 gen. and  Zhong Yun Long is the master of 15 gen. guys like Xuan-Yun Zhou,  Yuan Xiu Gang, Chen Shixing, zhong xue chao etc....even them do NOT teach the exact same technique...they add their own versions...and moves..try studying with 3 of them and you will notice that. And that gets to my point of the importance of this dvd and the others in these series: they are well explained and the taiji here is as good as any other, practice, feel the chi, and be one with the DAO.",1266451200,2,1336,4.592436974789916
8165916,1,B000M32UA8,"For anyone who speaks Chinese, the problems with this DVD are instantly obvious.  In the introduction to the program, Master You Xuan De says that he created this form in the 1990's upon the request of the Chinese government, who wanted to create a standardized form for teaching foreigners.  Interestingly enough, that part of the introduction is not fully translated into English.  For me, this instantly raised the question as to why they didn't want to film the original, authentic Wudang Taiji.  Any student of the Chinese arts will be familiar with the scenario where different material is presented to Western vs. Chinese students.  Fortunately, in the U.S. there are many teachers who openly present the authentic Chinese arts, Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming, and Wudang Daoist Zhou Xuan Yun come to mind as examples.

The forms in the DVD are also not demonstrated by You Xuan De, and are shown by his student You Xiao Long (possibly a relation, as the family name You isn't that common).  I have been told that this is true for all of the DVD's in the Wudang Esoteric Kung Fu Series. This leads me to question how decent You Xuan De's martial arts are, if he doesn't want to show us himself.",1233187200,10,1190,4.719806763285024
