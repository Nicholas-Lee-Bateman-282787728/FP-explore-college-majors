2181859,2,B0006D3HCO,"Damon Medic believes that this may be one of the worst movies ever made.  It begins with a little girl placing Oreo Cookies at the end of a pier.  She goes to see the cookies in the morning, and the cream centers are missing.  The girl exclaims, ""I knew it!""  The movie goes downhill from there.  I truly believe that the producers ran out of time, and were told to ""just put it out anyway.""  The loose ends in this film are numerous.  If you want to see one ridiculous film, perhaps the worst ever, buy this movie! You won't be disappointed with regards to the low expectations.  It fulfills them all!

2181861,2,B0006D3HCO,"It seems that underwater mysterious sea or lake creatures that are friendly to the one little girl or boy who believe it them have been in vogue for a few years.  This is just another one of the same basic story, with nothing particularly innovative or new.  Therefore, this is just another average such movie.  However, I am grading it down a full grade because of the utterly unnecessary use of swear words, not by the adults, but by the kids as well.  It isn't often, but there is no excuse for such language in what purports to be a family movie.  Also, in one instance Ashley suggests that one of the young boys has been ""playing with himself.""  Why is that in a supposed family movie?  Finally, the psychiatric group seemed a bit too corny for me or for my grandson who watched it with me.

Mee-Shee isn't completely free of bad language, but I think it is a better move all around than this one..",1211760000,7,903,4.365269461077844

2181863,5,B0006D3HCO,Distracted Dad reidentifies with his inner child and thus his children. It teaches about how illegal dumping of toxic waste into lakes can be  harmful to all life. It introduces a native tradition and shamamistic priniciple of shapeshifting.  The native elder tells the little girl in the story that the reason Orky the magical creature came to her was becasue she believed in Orky and that when she grows up to not just listen to her head but also her heart because her heart is the best part of her.........Great story.,1195171200,4,521,4.714285714285714
2181864,4,B0006D3HCO,"After years of searching for this movie, I finally accidently stumbled upon this at the store and was thrilled.  A workaholic dad takes his kids on vacation, the kids make a new friend in the lake, nearby plant pollutes lake, destroying new friends home, kids save the day,  Yadda Yadda Yadda!  Still, the story is cute.  The kids, led by then unknown Joshua Jackson are cute, and the main critter is cute too.  Good family movie also stars Mark Harmon.

I purchased It because it was recommended by others on Amazon and am delighted I did.  The story, itself, is not what made it memorable but rather the one sentence that Mark Harmon tells his daughter near the very end of the film, that was important to me.  So now, I repeat it to myself some days, when I need it.",1387065600,,472,4.222222222222222

2181919,5,B0006D3HCO,This is a very cute movie . We saw it on T V  with our granddaughter who's 6 yrs  and it was a great hit.  Good thing we had recorded it.  She must have watched it 50 times or more.  It made such an impact on her that she found a very large granite rock  which weighs  30-40 lbs and named it Orky!!  We have carried that rock all over California and even put eyes on it.  Well worth it!,1353801600,,386,3.725

2181921,4,B0006D3HCO,"""Magic in the Water"" is a fantasy movie about a family from Seattle who goes on vacation to a small community in Northern Canada. This community is a tourist attraction because it is supposedly the home of a ""mythological"" creature called Orky. The father (Mark Harmon) is a psychiatrist with his own call-in radio show. He only brought his two kids (Joshua Jackson, Sarah Wayne) on this vacation to please his wife. He mostly ignores the kids until his ""encounter"" with the ""creature."" I did not think Mark Harmon was really believable as the father. It's just my opinion, but he seems miscast in this role. His daughter Ashley (Wayne) loves the beauty of the lake and trees and tries to get her brother and father interested, but they just complain about how bored they are. I believe the reason this movie works is because of the way it gets us to suspend our beliefs and for a little while accept the fact that there are things we don't understand about nature and life and fantasies. The real magic in this movie comes from the extraordinarily charming and believable performance by the beautiful young actress Sarah Wayne. She elicits a sense of wonder through her desire to believe that the creature is real. Her enthusiasm is infectious and we find ourselves joining her in her adventure. I don't want to reveal any other details about the events of the movie. I'd rather the viewer had the pleasure of doing this for themselves.

There are more than a few similarities between ""Magic in the Water"" and another movie ""Mee-shee the Water Giant,"" although the movies were released ten years apart. First, they are both Canadian movies. Second, the creatures in both movies have a similiar appearance, although they were not created by the same people. Third, both creatures live in a cave below the surface of a lake. Fourth, both creatures are threatened by ""outsiders."" Fifth, just as Wayne is the ""magic"" in ""Magic in the Water,"" the young and very talented (and cute) Daniel Magder is the star and the ""magic"" in ""Mee-Shee."" Sixth, and lastly, both movies received Dove Awards from the Dove Foundation. Watch both movies back-to-back and see what you think. I already have.

In conclusion, don't let the negative parts of my review desuade you from watching ""Magic in the Water."" I was only trying to fulfill my obligation as a reviewer by including these statements. It is definitely worth watching. And as much as I liked it, I could not bring myself to give it five stars. I really didn't think it was at a five-star level. But I still recommend it highly. So, go find the movie and search for your own magic. While you're out, look for ""Mee-Shee"" and make it a double feature. It doesn't get any better than this. And don't forget the popcorn.",1343001600,3,2757,4.7060041407867494

But the big bonus was, we wondered about the gorgeous locale and watched the credits very carefully . . . Kaslo, B.C.  We went the next summer - stayed a week in a camp across the lake, and spent another week cruising the interior of B.C. & Alberta.  I could go on and on, but suffice to say it was one of our most memorable vacations - kids thought it was great too.

So - buy or rent the movie, and then visit Kaslo!",1225411200,,658,3.946969696969697
