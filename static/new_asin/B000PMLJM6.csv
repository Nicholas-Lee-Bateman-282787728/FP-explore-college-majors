8192672,4,B000PMLJM6,"Sergeant Preston Of The Yukon is very entertaining (76 of the 78 episodes are in color), with outdoor scenes which were filmed in Colorado. The quality of the transfers ranges from great to okay visually, with the sound sometimes below par. Even so, I had never seen this show before the DVD release, and I found myself always rooting for the trio of Preston, his dog, Yukon King, and horse Rex (the latter of whom only appeared in season one). The two black and white episodes, which are from season three, may well have been initially filmed in color, but only exist in monochrome here. This mega series set is substantially cheaper than what I paid for the individual seasons.",1181692800,14,679,4.666666666666667
