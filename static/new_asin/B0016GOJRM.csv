8262296,5,B0016GOJRM,"Roja is a classic of Indian, or more correctly Tamil Nadu, cinema. It marks the first film score penned by the now famous A. R. Rahman, and is the first in a trilogy of films about politics and relationships in India. Its followed by ""Bombay"" and ""Dil Se,"" both of which I highly recommend any fan of foreign films see.

Roja is a young woman from a small village who marries a man who originally came to ask for her sister's hand. At first Roja is insulted and bitter about this, but when the misunderstanding is cleared she and her husband form a close and loving bond. The bond is tested when Roja's husband is kidnapped by terrorists and she is thrust into the politics and bureaucracy of war and government.

The movie as a whole is breathtaking and the music is addictive (most of it has a treasured spot on my ipod). It is well written and beautifully shot (in fact the director chooses the same cinematographer for many films), achieving the wonderful affect of having you truly care about what happens to the characters. At the end I found myself wondering what happened to everyone when it was over, as if they had really lived the story. It is not the light genera that viewers usually see in Bollywood films, so be prepared for some tough content. I can say with complete confidence it is a must see for any film fan.

WARNING: I have bought this film twice on dvd and each time received a copy of the film from Bollywood Entertainment USA, dubbed in HINDI. The original Language is TAMIL, and there are major differences in the way it looks when it is spoken. You can tell sometimes in the dialogue that it has been dubbed (when the speak rapidly or really zoom in on someones face), but it only becomes annoying during the songs, when the audio and mouths rarely match up. If this is a pet peeve of yours don't buy this dvd. I believe Bollywood Entertainment USA is the only company that has released the dvd in region one, or the other format that plays in standard USA and Canada players (there may be an all regions dvd somewhere, or a region 3 in Tamil, but I have not come across any). I wanted to give fare warning, because it was the only thing that disappointed me.",1311552000,3,2187,4.408415841584159
