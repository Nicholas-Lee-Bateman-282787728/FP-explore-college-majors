8237977,3,B0010KG27O,"Excellent two DVD set for beginners. It really covers all the basics for someone buying their first electric guitar. Lee Hodgson walks you through some scales and explains timing. He stresses practicing with a metronome. He is right. It is painful, but really important. It will give you a sense of timing which is essential to playing with others.
 Good DVD, though I wish it went more in depth with music theory. If you are an intermediate player, this may not help you much. Still, it's a keeper.",1307318400,,499,4.670454545454546
