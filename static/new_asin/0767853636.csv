This is a comedic musical--so be ready for lots of showtune-style music and a few good laughs along the way.

17790,5,0767853636,"Outside of ""Wizard of Oz,"" this may be the best children's musical ever made. Besides being enjoyable for children of all ages, adults can revel in this wonderful look at the early 1930s in America. John Houston, one of the top ten American directors ever, was in his 70s when he made this, yet he still had his amazing skill set to produce a wonderful story within a wonderful world. Aileen Quine as Annie is terrific in a definitive performance, but you can't overlook Carol Burnett as the often inebriated Miss Hannegan. She got a Golden Globe nomination, but deserved an Academy Award for best Supporting Actress.
Admittedly, the movie jumps in unexpectedly directions. It is easy to lose interest during some of the middle musical sequences. However, there are so many interesting and comic sequences that the entire movie will paint a long term smile on your face each time you see it. I have seen it at least seven times and each time I knew new things.",1473465600,5,960,4.686390532544379

17863,2,0767853636,"Movie musicals aren't easy. Some of the biggest directors have failed trying to film them. Sir Richard Attenborough is one, with his A Chorus Line that had all the zip of Gahndi. John Huston is another, with this version of Annie.

Yes, the actors could not have been cast betterbut they can only do so much with clunky direction and a ridiculously rewritten script. Sorry, but a high-altitude chase involving elevated bridges and helicopters is not what this story needed.

To see this material filmed right, look to the Emmy Award-winning 1999 TV movie by Rob Marshall (the director-choreographer who would go on to win the Oscar for Best Picture with Chicago). It features smart scriptwriting that actually improves on the original musical by finding the heart of the show instead of slathering on the sensational, and a cast of Broadway royalty with a ton of Tonys among them. They include Victor Garber as Daddy Warbucks, Audra MacDonald as Grace, Kathy Bates as Mrs. Hannigan, Alan Cumming as Rooster, and Kristen Chenoweth as Lily St. Regis. It's the best film of this musical, period. See it. https://www.amazon.com/Annie-Alicia-Morton/dp/6305870187",1471564800,,1157,5.181818181818182

17895,3,0767853636,"This is a seriously flawed version of the musical, only really saved by the strength of the source material. The move from Winter to Summer did not help the plot, and the insertion of a wholly unneeded chase sequence ending with a death-defying hang off a bridge (not to mention the almost cartoonish yet brutal violence) takes a great musical for kids and - if you can imagine - dumbs it down for adults. The audio quality is so incredibly varied, you can have somebody sounding like they were recorded live on the day speaking with somebody who sounds like they're coming out of a period radio. The dance sequences are generally good, though seemingly inserted into the film with a crowbar. Choosing John Huston as the director was a big gamble... one which did NOT pay off. But enough good stuff comes through from the score and casting that many of its flaws (Punjab? Really? And check out the dueling stereotypical ethnic music styles as the Asian driver and the African Punjab have a dance-off in ""We Got Annie""!) are only slightly bothersome as opposed to the horrorshow they would be were the original musical not such an inherently great show.",1470700800,,1152,4.707920792079208

18334,4,0767853636,"This is my first time seeing this movie as an adult. Overall, I would say that I still like it. Much of what I remember as a child still holds up today. My one criticism, though, having now seen it through the eyes of an adult, is that it is unnecessarily long. Some of the songs I loved as a child, are now annoying. I think cutting one or two of them would have brought the run time down to just under two hours, and that would have made it more watchable. I would suggest that the song between Mr Warbucks and Miss Hannigan was not really needed. I would have handled that scene with dialogue only, in the same way the Grace Farrell/Hannigan scene was done. Otherwise, I still think this is a good movie, and I should note that it was my childhood introduction to the amazing Tim Curry.",1463961600,,789,4.231788079470198

18622,4,0767853636,I am 34 years old and I had never seen this movie. I of course knew the songs which had me imagining the movie was a lot lighthearted than I thought. This movie has a lot of sad themes that conflict with the bright music that conflicts with its own lyrics. There was a message behind the message. In between Mrs Hannigans crippling alcoholism and the public's willful ignorance of orphans being abused and threaten I feel as if there was a background commentary that sung to the woes Americans faced in that day and still continue to face now.,1457222400,,543,4.44

For those of you who are following this thread, there IS a Letterbox Widescreen version of this film in existence. It has only been released on LASERDISC in the ORIGINAL aspect ratio of 2:35:1 which is the original LETTERBOX format with Black Bars on top and bottom which shows the ENTIRE film as it was SHOT.
************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Sony Pictures Home Entertainment is clearly after a MONEY GRAB with this Blu Ray release.  The studios that do this really tick me off.  Unfortunately, many of the people in the general public are not aware of the differences between Pan and Scan, Anamorphic Widescreen, Full Screen, Letterbox, or understand ASPECT RATIO or how a film was SHOT and why it was shot that why by the director.
Until Sony Pictures Home Entertainment releases the LETTERBOX version of this that was released on Laserdisc, I will NOT be buying a DVD or a Blu Ray of ""ANNIE"".  I will stick with the Laserdisc.",1454284800,,1211,6.503105590062112

Saw the film in its original theatrical run, was ready to leave the Uptown Theater in D.C. but realized Carol Burnett still had more to do, so I stayed.  Been reading the reviews here and don't understand the business about the aspect ratio.  If the reviewers had only the DVD version and not the Blu-ray, then maybe so.  This is what the High Def Digest review says regarding that:
30 years can show a lot of age on some movies but Annie is a breath of fresh air for a catalog title. The films 2.40:1 framed production design and muted color scheme shines bright and clear with a beautiful restoration. The picture maintains a wonderful film-like appearance with a solid grain structure that maintains depth and detail without compromising black levels. There is slight softness in the overall image, but Id wager that is by intention as fine detail doesnt suffer. For a musical it offers a lot for the eyes to see and enjoy.  Would love to hear comments/clarifications on this.",1444694400,,1454,5.223175965665236

19000,5,0767853636,"""Annie"" is a 1982 musical-comedy from Columbia Pictures. Based on the Broadway musical it tells the story of a little orphan (Aileen Quinn) who is chosen to spend a week with a billionaire. However, one week turns into many and as the little orphan tries to find her parents an evil scheme is concocted by the orphanage's tyrannical caregiver Miss Hannigan (played to hilarious perfection by beloved Carol Burnett) and crooks. Packed with songs like ""It's a Hard Knock Life"", ""Lets Go to the Movies"" and the iconic song ""Tomorrow"" Annie is a wonderful family film filled with laughs and suspense.

""West Side Story"" which is a classic. Hope this doesn't date me too much.",1430352000,,517,4.232323232323233

19851,3,0767853636,"My wife and I watched this in order to prepare for a live performance in our town (Fort Myers, FL ).  We enjoyed the movie.  Carol Burnett was the most interesting character as Miss Hannigan who runs the orphanage.  I think you would enjoy watching this version.  Go ahead it was fine.

But here is why I give it three stars instead of four - it cut out several songs and completely extracted Christmas from the plot!

When we went to see the touring version of this musical we were surprised to see that the entire story was written as a Christmas story.  No hint of Christmas in this version.  And at least one of the three songs that was cut out of the movie was so good that it should not have been cut.  Oh yes, it was the one song that found fault with democrats.  No problem with lines about republican stereotypes, but someone may have been a bit sensitive about the line ""those dirty rats, the democrats.""

To be honest I was a bit offended that the movie producers would remove the Christmas angle - as Annie's visit with Daddy Warbucks was a Christmas-time publicity stunt.  The cynicism of using Christmas to sell an image, then the warm feelings and grandeur of the mansion decorated for the holiday as Warbucks is transformed into a caring and loving human being through the outcast child!  Salvation of the human spirit through a child ...  haven't I heard that somewhere before?  I wonder if there have been any other movies using that holiday to rake in the dough?  Hmmm...
It must have sounded too crazy for this producer. - I am sad he missed it.",1424476800,,1565,4.43859649122807

I rented it to watch with my 5 year old son thinking he'd cherish the memory as I did. To our surprise, we were both appalled at the immodesty in behavior and dress throughout the film. My son even averted his eyes and told me he didn't feel right watching it because it was inappropriate. I was in denial because of the memories I had and could hardly believe it. We shut it off. As I reflected on it, I realized that the movie was filthier than anything I've ever let him watch before and remembered some of the unsettling feelings i had when  I watched it long ago (particularly a drunk and immodestly dressed Carol Burnette). I feel terrible for having to be corrected and convicted by the innocence of my son. I have since renewed my vigor in strictly monitoring everything that comes into my home. Annie is a liberal, immodest, and indecent film that is inappropriate for children.",1424390400,2,1009,4.483695652173913

20027,3,0767853636,It is on par with other movies from the 80's some of it makes sense some of it doesn't. I personally enjoy the movie flaws and all. Let me explain miss Hanagan thing she ie proof some people are neither good nor bad. I personally enjoy the movie. And please tell me upon rewatching it to realize I been mixing up Tessie and Duffy for long time. The mouse seen was what made me figure out Duffy was one of them just a little bit older then Molly Duffy is part of weird trio of 7-8 yr olds. And how I realized Tessie was older one was how when Pepper said Tessie help me move this.  I guess J know now and Iknow what some ppl fail to realize is technically Tessie and Pepper if don't do whatever are told to are of age they could be kicked out because they are considered workers at about 12 or 13. it may have been filmed in 80's but movie is based in 30's so they may seem bit mean but really aren't just doing it so they don't end up scrounging the streets. In the digitally bought one their is little swearing thru out the movie but their was no actual swearing during bridge scene. .,1423180800,,1086,4.051162790697674
20028,5,0767853636,"This movie stands the generational test of time!

As a child, my wife watched this movie until the VHS tape literally wore out. She has it memorized from start to finish. It's her favorite musical and she adores it.

Now, our daughter just watched this for the first time as she's turning 4 and the magic transcends into her generation. She was captivated by the entire show. From start to finish she was locked to the screen, dancing along with every song.

As an adult, and a guy, I'm still impressed by this story as well. It's just a good story with a feel good ending. (If you don't know the ending by now...come on. It's 30 years old. I can't be accused of putting up spoilers at this point. In other news, Vader is Luke's father and Rhett Butler doesn't give a damn)

As for the format, I viewed this on the Amazon FireStick with a Prime Subscription. I was happy with the aspect ration through the FireStick as this movie was shown in it's original widescreen presentation. No pan and scan or chopped edges. I've not been able to find the film on DVD with the original aspect ration in tact. This is a musical with lots of color and dancing and elaborate sets. It should never be viewed in a pan and scan format. But the aspect ration is true on the FireStick, FireTV, and online.",1423180800,,1288,4.376569037656904

20056,2,0767853636,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Annie"" (1982)

[After watching the 2014 version of ""Annie"" I decided tonight to go back and watch the original 1982 version again. I hadn't seen it since I was a kid, and I remember loving it when I was little. This review reflects my adult perspective on the revisiting. I realize that this review will make a lot of die-hard fans very angry with me.]

1. What did I just watch? OK, the songs are just as catchy as they were. And fine, Carol Burnett still rules.

2. But the movie itself? The movie is utterly ridiculous. And weird. And there is entirely too much dancing. Most kids today wouldn't have it.

3. I realize that this movie is based in the Depression, and is based on the original comic, which had different social standards. But I still find the movie disturbing in ways that were completely over my head when I was 11.

4. This movie is blatant capitalist propaganda. It openly worships money and power, and demonizes the poor. It even manages to make fun of communism.

5. I was horrified to now understand the context in which the song ""Tomorrow"" was used - to encourage the President of the United States to distract poor people from paying attention to their situation.

6. In this movie, money is always the solution, and people are essentially property.

7. Besides being classist, the movie is sexist and racist.

8. The character of Punjab is a car crash of gasp-inducing stereotypes.

9. But they all smile and sing about it, so that counts for something, I guess.",1422057600,3,1518,4.568265682656826

This shows she does not have the ability to play a wide range of personalities.  Please do not defend her by saying that is ""Carroll Burnett ... people do not want to see her as the bad guy"".  She is not playing herself she is playing miss Hannigan!  Plus even when this movie came out most people who watched it would not have said ""Oh no she cant play a bad guy"".  Heck most who watched it do not know her.  (Today most don't even know John Wayne who was more famous).  why change the story line?",1421193600,,678,4.083333333333333

20315,4,0767853636,"When this movie came out, it was considered a pretty good version of Annie. It captured the original feel of the play. Most of the principles were well-played. They did mess around with the original play, deleting certain songs and adding others. Finney plays a gruff Warbucks. Love his acting. His singing isn't quite as good. Annie is perhaps a bit too bubbly to be believable--comes across as trying to be Shirley Temple--but she sings pretty well and this being based on a cartoon allows one to forgive a little emoting. I love the villains. Carol Burnett does her famous drunk shtick throughout most of it, but it makes sense that the kids drive her to drink. I did not care for her supposed redemption at the end of the movie. It would be better to see Mrs. Hannigan get her upcommance.
Check out the Disney version from the 90's. Still not perfect, but much closer to the original.",1420329600,,888,4.591194968553459

I downloaded it on Amazon Prime for my little granddaughters to watch when they were visiting.  The quality of the sound was so bad, I thought something was wrong with my speaker system, or some little fingers reset something and screwed it up. But, no, that was not it.  I checked my system with some other movies, tv shows and music on Prime and everything was fine.  Went back to ""Annie"" and again terrible sound quality.  The girls lost interest in the movie about 1/3 of the way in, and I'm sure that had to do with the sound.

Great movie for families, however there is some language that maybe parents don`t want their children hearing.

One star for Carol Burnett, and one for Ann Reinking's all too brief dancing. I like the 'We've got Annie' dance number, even though it's completely out of the wrong period that the film is set in. The film though, in trying to blow a paper thin stage show up with a third rate score into an elephantine extravaganza, completely loses what little charm the show had. But many people love it, so I'm happy for them.",1409097600,,574,4.528846153846154

21715,5,0767853636,"Who doesn't like Annie?!?  The songs are amazing and so timeless they're being sampled in rap songs by guys who've probably never seen a musical.  It's also great to watch again as an adult and marvel at Mrs. Hannigan's overtly sexual behavior and alcoholism, and her treatment of the children.  Owing to these fun attributes, I cheerfully doubt Hollywood will be destroying this with a film remake anytime soon!

OHMYGOOOOOD...I was wrong.  There's a ""contemporary"" adaptation coming out this year produced by Jay-Z and the Smiths (Will/Jada).  Oh dear...",1403049600,,556,5.191011235955056

21721,3,0767853636,"There is a new version of Annie coming out later in 2014, but I wanted my 13 year old daughter to see the old version first.  This version is really just a movie re-creation of the stage play.  The little girl who plays Annie is adorable and the rest of the cast is OK.  Carol Burnett is hilarious as a drunken, bitter old lady who runs a girls school and doesn't find her heart til near the end of the movie.

Most of the film is solid fun- we love the singing, dancing, and acting- but Miss Hannigan brings the whole thing down with her abusive, alcohol bingeing, promiscuous ways.

I watched clips of it of the song on YouTube and then rented the movie using Amazon video services. I rented the original Annie from 1982 in HD; the video and audio quality was good; I watched the movie with my family and we all loved it! We all shared a few tears here and there.

My daughter is going to be in a local theater production of Annie and so I thought I would order the movie for her. Before I did, though, I reviewed the other more recent version. It doesn't even compare to this version. The musical numbers were so much more magical in this one. Aileen Quinn's version of Annie just SPARKLES with life. She's not playing the role of Annie, she IS Annie. In fact, every single role in this film is so perfectly casted. I was shocked to find out there were more musical numbers from the broadway Annie script that were not in this movie (which is a good thing. I wasn't a fan of the other numbers). This movie is perfect. It's cheesy, over-the-top, tear-jerking, but nobody could have played these roles any better.

I agree with the editorial review, its like the movie was filmed in a void. There is very little heart to it. And then they have the scene toward the end where the Rooster character is chasing Annie up a tower!! Excuse me, but this is supposed to be a charming little story, and not some thriller. And then they also take one of my favorite numbers from the show, NYC, and replace it by that insipid ""At the Movies"". The dance numbers, mostly by Reinking, were also terribly overblown. The TV movie version with Kathy Bates was far superior.",1375315200,,660,4.330645161290323

22095,4,0767853636,"This review is for the widescreen Blu-ray version of Annie starring Albert Finney.

I saw this movie back in June of 1982.  It was made to be viewed in a theater.  On a TV screen, it tends to look a bit overcrowded.  I can't recall ever seeing a more active musical with literally a cast of thousands.  And with the startling use of depth of field, you have way too much to look at in some of the more expansive sequences.  The two stars (Finney & Quinn) are practically lost in the opulent circus/party scene with all the lights, a b-zillion people, a fountain, acrobats, fireworks, and an elephant!  There is such a thing as too much.  As for the music, a lot of my favorite songs were cut and replaced by lesser efforts.  I've always thought the casting of Carol Burnett as Miss Hannigan was a bit strange.  Albert Finney (Warbucks) was loud, Ann Reinking (Grace Farrell) perfect, Edward Herrmann dead on as Franklin D. Roosevelt.  And then there's the redoubtable Geoffrey Holder as Punjab, also perfect.  The biggest surprise for me was finding out that Shawnee Smith (The Blob, Becker, and Saw) was one of the orphans!  As musicals go, this one is a sentimental favorite.  Supposedly, there is a remake in the works.",1366329600,,1222,4.597222222222222

We recently rented the Disney version and I thought it was wonderful, but unfortunately they cut a substantial number of songs.  Victor Garber was great, as well as Audra McDonald.  Anne Reinking as Grace, in this version, really doesn't have a great voice and I winced through ""I think I'm gonna like it here"". It really was awful.  Albert Finney seems to just scream the entire movie, I don't know why any child would want to to be adopted by him.  This version is just way too long, they really needed to edit a good 20 minutes or even more from this mess.  My kids and I started losing interest about 90 minutes in.  Also, they neglect to use ""NYC"", one of ,h favorite songs in the show and substitute it with a subpar song called ""Movies, Movies"" or whatever and omit ""Herbert hoover"" as well.  Then they add some other numbers like ""We got Annie""' etc and what is the point of Punjab?  Ugh.  Just terrible.

I only wish the Disney version didn't cut any songs because hands down, it's a better version.  Combine that with the 30th Anniversary soundtrack and I think you'd be much happier than owning this DVD.",1358726400,,1369,4.338582677165355

The new edition looks and sounds great.  I love and dislike this film all at one time, if that makes any sense.  There are moments that it is glorious and moments when I wonder what was going on in the director's mind.  But, with that said.....the good far out-weighs the bad in this film....the cast is marvelous and so is the music.  I have long been a fan of the stage show....so my one big complaint about the film is the changing of the ending from Christmas to July 4th. If my memory serves me correctly this film was a summer release, so that may the reason for the change of holiday.  Christmas just works so much better in the story.  In any case, just getting to see Carol Burnett, Bernadette Peters, and Tim Curry perform their numbers is worth the look-see.  Albert Finney is also a very good Daddy Warbucks......I have friends whose little girls just love this movie.....and though I do not ""just love it""......I find it entertaining and a nice addition to my collection of musicals on Blu-Ray.

Annie is nothing short of a classic, and this film provides a highly charming Annie whose adventures are fun to follow. Perhaps in part because its musical aspect makes some scenes less heartbreaking.

22223,5,0767853636,"""Annie"" has had a spotty history on home video.  Unless you were lucky enough to have a widescreen laserdisc in the 90's, or the widescreen DVD that was available shortly in the early 2000's, you've most likely only seen the film in an awful pan-and-scan presentation with 40% of the picture missing (and the opening credits squished into the frame).  And if you were lucky enough to have either of the widescreen versions, you wouldn't have the bonus features from the later full-frame ""anniversary"" DVD release of 2002.

Sony has finally given ""Annie"" fans the presentation we have hoped for with this 30th Anniversary Blu-ray edition.  I won't go into a review of the movie; it is what it is.  But how is the Blu-ray...?

Video

A!  ""Annie"" has never looked better.  There may be a few people who saw a 70mm print in 1982, but if that isn't you, it's probable that this is the best you've ever seen.  That being said, ""Annie"" was filmed in the early 1980's, and so it looks like a film from the early 1980's.  A little more grain that we might be used to, but kudos to Sony for staying true to the look of the film and not trying to eliminate the grain with over processing.  The picture is sharp and natural, with the orphanage scenes looking suitably drab and monotone, and the mansion scenes nicely detailed.  Watching it with my daughters (who have only seen the widescreen DVD), there were several scenes where they said ""I never noticed (insert detail here)!""  That's a sure sign of a good presentation.  There will no doubt be some flaws that are noticed for the first time (several scenes exhibit an odd oversaturation on the light bulbs in the mansion, which I suspect are in the film source), but all in all the HD video is superb, and sure to please any fan.

Audio

A+!  The English audio is presented in DTS MA 5.1, (not Dolby Digital 5.1), and again, it has never sounded better.  From start to finish, the sound is full and rich, with good use of all channels. Even my subwoofer got a workout, with the bottom-end of the musical numbers shaking the room. Rumor has it that some 70mm theatrical presentations had ""directional dialogue"" (where the voices follow the actors across the front speakers), but that is not the case here (it is always from the center channel, as is now common).

Extras

Yes, there are extras on this disc.  It includes the ""My Hollywood Adventure"" with Aileen Quinn, a 12 minute featurette from 2002 where she shares her memories of getting the part of Annie and filming the movie.  It is very well done, with some good archival and behind the scenes footage.  In the absence of a more in depth documentary, this will have to do.  The Blu-ray also includes the music video for a contemporary pop version of ""Hard Knock Life"" by the group ""Play"", whom Wikipedia informs me was a Swedish girl group from the early 2000s (both the ""My Hollywood Adventure"" and music video are from the 2002 DVD).

There is a good presentation of vintage ""Annie"" trailers and TV commercials from 1982; two trailers and three commercials.  Frankly, the trailers are pretty bad, even judging by the standards of 30 years ago.  But it's great to have them here.

This disc does not have the ""Act Along With Annie"" or Trivia game from the 2002 release, or the ""Original Movie Art Gallery"" or ""Talent Files"" from the widescreen DVD release.

There is also a ""Sing Along Blu-ray Exclusive"", which I didn't look at, and a trailer for ""Arthur Saves Christmas"".

Thanks to Sony for giving us such a great version of this oft maligned film.

And the possibility of watching a movie with English subtitles was a great way to learn English and to understand the picture much better than any language translation because there are expressions which just can't be translated. Either you understand it or you don't.

22267,4,0767853636,"It began with an 1885 poem by James Whitcomb Riley and led to a 1924 comic strip by Harold Gray, ""Little Orphan Annie"" was a series that may have focused on a young orphan girl, but the storyline was geared for adults as it was political.

But by 1930, when the storyline was made into a radio show and in 1977 when it was made into a Broadway musical, suffice to say, Annie became part of America's pop culture and known for songs such as ""Tomorrow"", ""Maybe"" and ""It's the Hard-Knock Life"".

So, with the Broadway production of ""Annie"" coming to a close, in 1982, Columbia Pictures released ""Annie"" based on the Broadway musical.  Directed by actor/filmmaker John Huston (""The Maltese Falcon"", ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"", ""The African Queen""), the film would star an ensemble cast which included Albert Finney, Carol Burnett, Ann Reinking, Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters, Geoffrey Holder, Edward Herrman and the film debut of Aileen Quinn.

VIDEO:

""Annie: 30th Anniversary - Sing-Along Edition"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 aspect ratio).  While the film slightly has that aged '80s film look, outdoor scenes look vibrant, Annie's red dress to anything with bold colors tend to really pop.  And you can see the stubble of Albert Finney's bald head.  But for the most part, this is probably the best that anyone is going to see of ""Annie"".  I didn't notice any artifact problems or severe DNR.  There was a fine layer of grain and for the most part, the film does look on Blu-ray.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Annie: 30th Anniversary - Sing-Along Edition"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA, Japanese 5.1 Dolby Digital, Italian LCRS Discrete Surround, French, German, Spanish Stereo.  The film is primarily a musical and features dialogue.  Because it's an older film, I expected it to be more of a front channel soundtrack and I was right.  The dialogue and music is crystal clear and with songs that feature bass, there is a good dynamic range when it comes to the musical soundtrack.

Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Arabic, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""Annie: 30th Anniversary - Sing-Along Edition"" comes with the following special features:

  Sing-Along  - For those who want to sing-along to the film or a song, an exclusive for the Blu-ray is the sing-along (ala karaoke) for the musical scenes of the film.
  My Hollywood Adventure with Aileen Quinn - (12:04) Aileen Quinn reminisces of her time filming ""Annie"" and featuring video clips of behind-the-scenes of the making of the film and the promotion for ""Annie"".  Note: This is the same featurette for the 20th Anniversary of""Annie"".
  Trailer and TV Spots - Featuring the theatrical trailer, the behind the scenes making of the theatrical trailer and three TV spots.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Back in the early '80s, ""Annie"" was one of the first films I watched on cable.  At the time, ""Annie"" was a big part of American culture thanks to the Broadway play and the music.

While ""Annie"" may not be as well-known for younger audiences of today or even young adults of today, ""Annie"" was one of those feel-good, rags-to-riches story featuring memorable music and at the time, a commanding performance by wonderful talents such as Carol Burnett, Bernadette Peters but also from Albert Finney and Tim Curry.  But the film's true talents were young Aileen Quinn and the magnificent song and dance performances by Ann Reinking.

The look and the feel of the film felt like New York during the 1920s and the direction by filmmaker and actor John Huston was rather well-done.

As for the Blu-ray release, for those who want to sing along with the music or learn the lyrics, can easily do so with the exclusive ""Sing-Along"" feature.  And for those who don't own the previous ""Annie"" releases, will surely enjoy watching an older Aileen Quinn discussing her experience of working on the film and the various talents at the time.  As for video and audio quality, there is no doubt that this is the best version of ""Annie"" to date.  While I wish there was more use of the music for the surround channels, it's still crystal clear coming from the center and front channels.  While the picture quality didn't look too aged or feature heavily use of DNR.

But what it comes down to is one's nostalgic memories of ""Annie"" or one wanting to watch a family friendly musical on Blu-ray.  I used this film as an actual introduction to musicals for my nine-year-old, but the concept of why characters were continually singing and dancing and not enough conversation made him a bit impatient.  But I suppose growing up and being exposed to live musicals, especially watching ""The Carol Burnett Show"" as a young child of the '70s, helped ease me to appreciating ""Annie"" a bit more.

Overall, Annie"" is a family film filled with memorable music, wonderful dance choreography with a talented ensemble cast.  But also featuring  a heartwarming rags-to-riches story that families can easily appreciate and enjoy.",1354320000,4,5056,4.904593639575972

22289,3,0767853636,"Ugh.

So the only good things I can say about the Blu-Ray version of ""Annie"" is that it's widescreen and has better picture quality than the previous version of the DVD, and it's not expensive.

I bought this one because our daughter loves the movie, but the DVD version looks so bad on a HD HDMI TV. The DVD picture is god-awful really.

I was hoping the Blu-Ray would solve that. Well it doesn't really. While the video is now 16:9, the quality is just still not up to Blu-Ray standards. You know when you've gotten a classic, and they go back to the film and remaster it and it looks awesome on Blu-Ray? Well they didn't do that here. But to be fair it is much, much better than the DVD version.

And for a ""30th Anniversary Edition!"" they added 2 things- ""Sing-Along with Annie"" which consists of, you guessed it, the portion of the movie with the song with subtitles. Lame. And the Ultraviolet version.

Other than that, you still get the Aileen Quinn look-back from the regular DVD, as well as the laughably terrible ""Hard-Knock Life"" remake by ""Play"". Terrible.

So, if you want widescreen and better picture quality, then buy it, but if you're expecting the stops pulled out, especially in light of the Broadway revival, don't.",1349136000,6,1235,4.5656108597285066

22294,1,0767853636,"I can't speak for the stage musical but this film does not faithfully represent the comic strip by Harold Gray. While dir. John Huston slipped in a few (weak) references that only a dedicated Gray fan would understand, the film overall is a terrible adaptation.

Daddy Warbucks is a tireless enemy to crime in all its forms & devotes his life to bringing justice to criminals who escape legal punishment. That is what Punjab & The Asp are for, they are efficient assassins who step in when ""Daddy"" needs them. Annie isn't a cute singing moppet, she is a pint-sized adventuress who endures true hardship & tragedy and often joins in Warbucks' fight against crime. Punjab is not a sideshow conjurer, Gray's world is filled with *real* magic, miracles, and supernatural occurrences. The drunken carpet-baggers in this movie would be no challenge at all to the real Annie or Warbucks, and if they crossed a certain line, the real Daddy Warbucks would send the Asp along in the night to make sure they would never hurt children again.

It pains me to write this since I am a huge John Huston fan. I can only imagine what he would have done with the real source material, not a musical that steals its plot from ""Silas Marner"" and requires these dignified, intense, often dark characters to stop and do a little song & dance every five minutes.

Skip this & read the Fantagraphics reprint series. That's where the real Annie can be found. If you like stories with intelligence, action, adventure, mystery and a touch of philosophy, you'll love the original strip by Harold Gray.",1347667200,,1572,4.7299270072992705

""Mrs. Hannigan was too...""
Well, I don't know what to say about this. It couldn't be ignored, but I considered it to add to the plot(unlike some movies which just throw it in there), and it wasn't excessive.

22393,1,0767853636,"I grew up on the ""real"" annie, meaning the original broadway version, and never liked this 1982 aileen quinn ""annie"" film, directed by john huston. I never saw the 1999 Disney one until last night, when i watched it with my four year old daughter.  she wanted to see annie and i made the mistake of showing her this john huston film-- VERY dark, unappealing, and the arrangements of the songs are not good. carol burnett, whom i LOVE, played a very dark version of miss hannigan, drinking, floozing, and actually quite scary and creepy-- totally inappropriate for young children.  i think aileen quinn is extremely unappealing as annie, with none of the charm of andrea mcardle or any of the broadway annies.  the next morning when my daughter asked to watch this again, i had to tell her the dvd was broken, because i just felt it was too dark, and charmless-- even the costumes and sets were without magic (and the jeffrey holder sub-plot is just silly).  My daughter was furious and begging to see annie again, so i did some reading of reviews here on amazon, and found the other one-- the alicia morton/kathy bates version.  it's like night and day!  that one is much more true to the original broadway version-- alicia morton as annie is charming, adorable, a great singer-- tough and sweet, but not saccharin like aileen quinn.  the costumes and sets are charming, the musical arrangements are great, all the performances are strong, and it is great for young audiences.  i am usually not a fan of Disney-fied musicals-- but they did a GREAT job with this one.  and the andrea mcardle cameo was a huge treat for a fan like me.  i had to give this one star for respect for carol burnett, albert finney, and john huston, but i give it a big YUCK for the execution, and the performances. an even bigger yuck for quinn and her hair!!

The other performances are universally appealing, and everyone in our family likes this version much better than the Disney retread issue with Kathy Bates & Co.

I know it's difficult to transfer a stage play to film, but Annie would seem to be easier than most, as it already has a big cast and multiple settings. This just isn't a very compelling movie for three reasons: 1) They added songs and took out others. The new songs don't have the ""oomph"" of the original show tunes. In a word, they're boring. 2) John Huston's direction drags, drags, drags. 3) I'm going to say it--Aileen Quinn just didn't have the spark Annie needs. She has no edge, no genuine spunk.

22470,4,0767853636,"Annie has been a family favorite for years. The songs are catchy, and there's plenty of glitz and glamor to spare. The positivity is the best part; even though Annie is obviously in a miserable place, her can-do attitude and her optimism are as good for a bad day as a bowl of chicken-noodle soup is for a sick friend.

Every single song is downright catchy. I often find myself humming them. And as for the choreography, it's usually wonderful and unique.

Although I've heard that some have issues with the casting, I've always found it completely believable. Carol Burnett definitely does the best job among her fellow actors, so much so that it's difficult to see anybody else in the role of Ms. Hannigan at all. Bernadette Peters is quite excellent, and Albert Finney makes a grand blustering Daddy Warbucks. ""Annie"" herself is just perfect: what a great little actress!

The story itself is very basic, but very enjoyable. The idea is that a ragamuffin of an orphan is ""adopted for a week"" by the richest man in America, and they end up becoming the best of friends. It has the air of a fairytale; many elements of the story, like the characters of the Asp and Punjab, are colorful and fantastic indeed. Now, if you'll excuse the fact that Annie's good luck is a little too good (the whole universe seems ready to bend over backwards for her), you'll find her character and story quite enjoyable. Perhaps this is because she's so kind to everyone around her; she never seems to become too saccharine. In any case, when I was a kid, I liked to imagine that I was Annie... street-smart, optimistic, opportunistic, and talented, too.

There are negatives, unfortunately. If you're looking for tight choreography, well, Annie doesn't quite deliver. ""Hard Knock Life"" is full of acrobatics that never quite mesh, and girls whose moves should, and do not, match up. However, this incongruity usually seems limited to the dancing of the kiddos; the adult routines are downright lovely. It's like they weren't as picky with the children's accuracy, which is a bit sad.

There are also some parts of the film that just makes one feel a bit queasy. Burnett plays her scenes to perfection. Perhaps she plays them a little too perfectly! Ms. Hannigan is a low-life drunk, to be sure, but wow! Burnett gave the character a bizarre likability and attractive personality; nonetheless, I always found myself eager for her scenes to be over, even when I was a kid. She's the epitome of depression, and her scenes--as well as those of the post-Annie orphanage--are always big let-downs. They are stark reminders that Annie's fantasy is just that: a fantasy. The ending doesn't really make up for it, either. What could (and should) be a happy joyride all the way through is tainted with this sick reminder that this is just a movie. Now, I don't expect all of my entertainment to be happy, but in a movie like this, the effect is jarring, and the only word I can use to describe it is ""bipolar."" ""I'm a happy wish-fulfilling movie where everyone's dreams come true and every single person in the universe can jump into song and dance at any moment! OH NO, WAIT! I'm reality now! Death waits for you with cold fingers!""

Really, as much as I have gone on about them, the negatives are slight in comparison to the overwhelming positive air surrounding Annie. I watched it religiously as a child and the wonder still hasn't worn off on me today. I pop it in regularly when I need a pick-me-up.",1238976000,3,3478,4.684124386252046

22494,4,0767853636,"What's not to like?

The singing is spotty, the musical numbers are all over the place, the little girl is highly annoying, the film is borderline preposterous and Albert Finney looks bored but we never are (bored that is).  The great thing about `Annie' is that no matter how bad it really is you can't help but like it.  I've seen this movie a hundred times (granted I was very little for the majority of them) and I could watch it again tomorrow (bet you're bottom dollar).

There are a few versions of this classic story, but this one is my favorite (even if it is the worst as many claim).  It's the one I grew up on so maybe I'm a tad biased, but whatever, I enjoy it immensely.

The film tells the story of orphan Annie who escapes the clutches of the evil Miss Hannigan when billionaire Oliver Warbucks decides to let an orphan live with him in his mansion for a week; and Annie is that orphan.  After a week of fun and games (and singing and dancing) Oliver decides (with a little prodding from the lovely Grace) to adopt Annie, but there is a problem.  Annie is waiting for her mother and father to come back for her, and so Warbucks decides to help her in every way he can to find her parents.  What Hannigan and her evil brother Rooster have in store for Annie (and Warbucks) is another story all together.

Okay, so like I said, the singing is spotty (Finney, I love you but really?) and the dance numbers are somewhat spastic (some are great, some are ridiculous) but it all works and it is all entertaining, no doubt.  Little Aileen Quinn is an annoying little child and a really bad actress but she can sing (if that really was her) and her renditions of `Tomorrow' and the like are really nicely done.  Albert Finney, like I said, is bored.  He yells a lot and sings out of key but I just love him.  Really, the best thing about this movie is Carol Burnett who is all sorts of hilarious in this movie.  She give Hannigan the right balance of well intentioned cruelty to make her a character you love to hate.

I will say that some of this movie is far from appropriate for children, especially when Tim Curry and Bernadette Peters (I love her here too) are on the screen (they tend to get rather risqu) and there is some language that I didn't remember but all in all it is something that your children will love (my daughter, too young to really pay attention, was captivated by the singing).

Embrace it for all its faults and relish in the campy qualities it possesses.  Sure, there are a million other musicals that are far better than this one, but honestly, what's not to like?",1230595200,,2600,4.3478260869565215

To me, Annie is family fare, and this movie had some elements not appropriate. There was one expression of profanity, the remainder were some suggestive dance sequences I was embarrassed to have my daughters see. And considering my daughter was an orphan in the play we did, she was taken aback at some parts of the movie, too.

And the time the movie was made showed its dated-ness. I thought the musical sequence where the driver (an Asian) and Punjab (an Indian or Pakistani played by Caribbean Geoffrey Holder) dance was stereotypical in its portrayal.

Sure, John Huston is long dead, but what about the living?  Why not round up Carol Burnett, Albert Finney, Aileen Quinn and some of the girls for a real commentary track?  Grown-ups need in-depth making-of featurette documentaries, not sappy retrospectives narrated by Aileen Quinn as if she were talking to a bunch of grade-schoolers.  And grown-ups emphatically do NOT need cheesy sing-along and act-along with Annie features, or insipid trivia that any 8th-grade graduate could do.

It almost made me cry to realize that I was missing a third of the action in most of these shots.  Had I realized that, I never, ever, would have paid for this DVD.  Let that be a lesson in always reading the packaging carefully, and never presuming for a moment that DVD manufacturers are in tune with the needs that grown-up consumers have for their movie merchandise.  I would have given this sham of a product 0 stars if I could have, but I can't bear to give so few stars to a movie I love so much.

Looks like all I can do is keep the old tunes in mind, and modify them just a little . . . ""Tomorrow, tomorrow, maybe we'll get a better DVD release tomorrow -- it's only a day away!""",1192320000,5,1961,4.423398328690808

22572,4,0767853636,"Having been lucky enough to see the original on Broadway I was looking forward to the transition to the silver screen.  Unfortunately most of the magic of the musical was left in New York and never made it to Hollywood.  The songs are, of course, very good, though they did drop one of my favorites, ""NYC"", from the score and added the, in my opinion, inferior ""Let's Go To The Movies"".  Aileen Quinn does a very credible job in the title role.  Albert Finney, as Daddy Warbucks, and Carol Burnett, as  Miss Hannigan, also do a good job.  Ann Reinking, as Daddy Warbucks' secretary, proves to be one of the best dancers around.

22590,4,0767853636,"By now, everyone probably knows the story of Annie (Aileen Quinn), the little tomboy who longs for her real parents to take her away from the orphanage. Instead, she is adopted for a week by billionaire Oliver Warbucks (Albert Finney) under the care of his secretary Grace (Ann Reinking). They fall in love with her and try to help her find her real parents who we find out are really dead. The orphan home's caretaker Miss Hannigan (Carol Burnett), her criminal brother (Tim Curry), and his moll (Bernadette Peters) decide to impersonate Annie's parents to get the cash reward, but the orphans get wind and try to stop them.

No other version compares to this one; the cast is outstanding. Quinn is appropriately innocent, but belies intelligence under her curly red hair. Burnett is wonderful as always, playing a personally triumphant part; her parents were both alcoholics. Curry plays a menace truthfully, and yet he's still a bit likable- at least in the beginning. Even Peters' role stands out; she was wonderful during this era. Although musicals tend to be a bit silly sometimes, this one straddles the fine line between fantasy and believability very well. Viewers of any age can find themselves enraptured in every bit of the story.

And the music! It has really earned a place in Americana. Who doesn't know the hopeful song ""Tomorrow?"" The music has become so popular that even Jay-Z sampled ""Hard Knock Life."" Some of the lesser knowns are amazing as well. ""Little Girls"" features many clever lines. ""Let's Go to the Movies"" is very fun and serves as blanket praise for the classic movie era. ""You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile"" is catchy and wonderfully represents old time radio advertisement songs. ""Easy Street"" is tons of fun thanks to Burnett, Curry, and Peters and their comic performances.

There are certainly flaws, the most glaring having to do with the time period. The opener hails the year: 1929. However, the film does not stick to that year. It includes Franklin D. Roosevelt as a character, and yet he was not elected president until 1932. Furthermore, the New Deal discussed in the film did not come about until 1933. Also, the film everyone goes to see in the theater is Camille from 1936. Even the most avoidable of mistakes occurs. In the beginning of the film, one learns that Annie is ten years old, but later, when reading her birth certificate, one learns that she was born in 1922. However, one with no interest in history could easily ignore these mistakes as they do not detract from the story.",1174435200,12,2545,4.8192219679633865
22591,1,0767853636,"This version of Annie is dark and mean-spirited.  Carole Burnett plays a

nasty drunkard Miss Hannigan with no redeeming qualities.  The child playing Annie looks the part, but her acting is not great.  People try to

kill Annie in this movie.  It may be true to the cartoon, but it's not something I want my daughter to watch.

The Disney version is far superior, though it takes a few liberties and deviates from the standard script, including a budding romance between Warbucks and his secretary.

Audra McDonald is luminous, Victor Garber is the father everyone wishes they had, Cathy Bates and supporting cast are funny, and Alicia Morton is believable and sincere. There is even a cameo appearance by Andrea McArdle, the first Annie on Broadway.  Unless you are a true cynic, the Disney Annie will tug at your heartstrings.  If you want a nice video with positive values to share with your little girl, the Albert Finney Annie isn't it.  Get the Disney Annie instead.

22640,5,0767853636,"Some of my earliest childhood memories include watching this version of ""Annie"" with my older sisters and cousins. We could never get enough of it, and quite frankly I think this movie is what spawned our rather humorous attempt to act out the play ourselves in the basement.

In any case, this film has been brought back in a Special Edition DVD for whole new generations, as well as previous generations who remember it from their childhood. It seems a lot of people have given this version heat, mainly for deviating a bit from the original Broadway storyline, but I believe this is arguably the best ""Annie"" you could get your hands on, for a reason that another reviewe here, ""Kelli,"" already indicated.

The acting is passionate. Purely, genuinely, and undeniably passionate. I don't know where they found that little Aileen Quinn, but she embodies absolutely everything that this character is supposed to symbolize. She is plucky, sweet, tough as nails, and underneath it all, she's just looking for a family to call her own. She probably fits her given role better than any other child actress in any movie I've ever seen, and I mean that sincerely. She is just amazing. For that matter, every single cast member appears to have poured their entire soul into their roles, with acting that contains remarkable depth and incredible spirit.

The song and dance numbers, too, are a phenomenol addition to this film. A few original new songs are added to this version, including ""We've Got Annie"" and ""Dumb Dog"" (which I personally didn't love and found to be a bit out of place, but it was still pretty cute). There are clearly professional dancers and talented voices galore to accompany every song, making it an ideal musical experience for the whole family.

It appears that many people prefer the recent TV version of ""Annie"" with Alicia Morton because the plot is faithful to the Broadway musical version. That may be true, but in my opinion that remake did not stand the slightest chance against the acting of this 80's version. Albert Finney and Aileen Quinn work beautifully alongside one another, with Finney giving a perfect portrayal of a workaholic man who is constantly seeking to push Annie away but eventually recognizes that she is the daughter he always needed. Ann Reinking (Grace Farrell) plays the nurturing motherly role to a ""T,"" and of course, the classic and hysterical Carol Burnett helps Miss Hannigan steal every single scene she is in. The orphans are all well cast, each with their own distinct personalities and all notably expressive in front of the camera. (They really did get lucky with the kids in this movie; all of them were very genuine and a talented group of little actresses). A beautiful story indeed, brought to life impeccably on screen and a pure joy to watch. It's one of those movies that truly does just make you smile, and the approach these actors took with their roles is the main reason for that.

As for the Special Anniversary DVD Edition...it is not anything major, but it does include some good stuff. The popular teen group ""Play"" sings their own version of ""Hard Knock Life"" (which, if you know the 4 teens who make up this girl group, it is a perfect song for them), there are some ""Sing and Act Along with Annie"" sections, and most notably, you get a short featurette with an all-grown-up Aileen Quinn. Long-time fans of this movie will absolutely love to see her come on-screen and talk about her experiences with the film and how the newfound fame impacted her life afterward. (I personally love the flashback video segment where Carol Burnette hugs Aileen and says ""Aileen, can I put you in my bag and take you home with me? I can't be mean to this kid!"") Judging from this featurette, Quinn seems very personable and easygoing, and there's no doubt that playing Annie must have been a very special memory from her childhood.

The DVD is absolutely worth getting if you love this movie. It has some nice special features and, of course, the actual film will always remain a classic in itself.",1146268800,28,4059,4.766714082503556
22641,3,0767853636,"So much for special edition. Enough complaints have been made about the lack of widescreen format - unforgiveable in any musical since the dance numbers nearly always take up the whole screen.

My biggest complaint is that there are actually lines REMOVED from songs - in ""The Hard Knock Life"", Molly's orders to ""Strip those beds! Scrub that floor!"" have been erased, although there is still a camera close-up that clearly shows her mouthing the words. In ""We've Got Annie,"" a whole series of servants' exclamations are similarly gone. There are several other omissions that slip my mind currently. Why on earth would the editing team take out these lines? If they were going to remove anything, it might at least have been the two exclamations of ""g-dd-mn"" at the end, which are the only occasions of this movie turning un-kid-friendly and were entirely unnecessary. What were you thinking, Columbia?

Get this movie by all means, but get the widescreen version. I don't know whether it shares the problem of ommitted lines, however, and until I do, I'll stick with my old much-loved VHS.",1145836800,13,1090,4.918478260869565

22644,3,0767853636,"I have loved this movie since early childhood.  But I was a little disappointed in the Special Anniversary Edition of the DVD.

There is a nice little extra feature with Aileen Quinn, but I wish it had been longer and more in-depth.  The rest of the extra features were pretty useless and uninteresting to anyone over the age of about 5 (granted, this movie is for kids...).

My biggest complaint, besides the lack of SPECIAL features, is the fact that the language dubbing doesn't match the closed captioning.  If I put on closed captioning in Spanish, it translates the English version of the movie.  But if I switch the audio to Spanish, it doesn't match the captioning- the songs are completely different in Spanish, and I'd like to know the words to them in other languages, but the dubbing isn't of a quality high enough to be able to decipher anything over the music.  And the captioning offers no help at all.

Because that's such a bizarre complaint, and most people won't notice or care, I'm still giving it 3 stars- great movie, one of the special features was interesting.",1136764800,4,1084,4.668421052631579
22645,5,0767853636,"ANNIE is better today than when it came out.  Little Aileen Quinn seems like a real child, and whenever the camera is on her, there's always some real emotion in her face and in her voice.  Her singing voice isn't perfect, but it's real.

Too bad the movie doesn't keep its focus on the children more.

Carol Burnett is insane in the part of Miss Hannigan, sheer genius, and she staggers, coughs, sucks down booze like Lee Remick in DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES.  Every time she sees a man she gets high, her endorphins flying around the room.  She's got to be the easiest girl in town, and she makes it all seem natural.  It's a brave performance, and I notice that when she reforms at the very end John Huston has her do so in miniature, at the bottom of the screen while quarreling with Rooster, almost as if to say, he doesn't believe it either.

Most of the numbers are very well done, except perhaps for the bizarre ""I Think I'm Going To Like It Here"" sequence.  Sorry, I just don't believe for a minute all those servants cavorting snd dancing with the sheer joy of serving Oliver Warbucks.  It's a spectacle without any foothold in reality.  What are we supposed to think about the plutocratic rich?  My sympathies are with the bearded anarchist who throws the bomb over the balustrade, the assassination attempt thwarted by that darn Sandy.  The whole moral of the story is, as Ann Reinking suggests to Albert Finney, that his priorities aren't correct.  ""Why do you love only money and power and capitalism?  They'll never love you back.""  The truth is, they do love back.  The movie could have shown that capitalism is, not too put too fine a point on it, evil; in fact, viewed at in one way, ANNIE is a spectacular, near Brechtian demonstration of the evil of money.

Everyone's very good, excepting perhaps Ann Reinking, who plays the sweet, refined Grace Farrell, Warbucks' secretary.  Reinking is a fine dancer but not a movie star, no way.  Even on stage she seems ill-at-ease.  She was the 70s version of Ann Miller, and both of them hailed from the same Land of Wood.  She's got one number, ""We Got Annie"" in which she shows off the dancing Fosse taught her.  Everything else is just splinters.

I remember how awful this movie was said to be back in the day, but give it a shot, there are some wonderful elements to it, and dream of the day when we can see it wide screen to appreciate the inventive choreography in the ""Hard Knock Life"" number, which looks so difficult and anarchic.  If this isn't John Huston's very best film it's in my top 3 or 4 by him.  Is that impossible to imagine?",1132012800,2,2603,4.461864406779661

This movie is worse than Anne of Greene Gables!

That is saying a ton! What could be worse?

Anne of Green Gables takes a whole day to watch and the sheer torchure of Annie outdoes Anne of Greene Gables 50 million times more in just 90 minutes!

If you like musicals don't see this movie.

If you like movies don't see this movie.

If you like DVD's don't see this movie.

If you like television don't see this movie.

If you like life PLEASE don't see this movie.

I think you get the picture now!

And if you have seen this movie you probably know what I am going through. We ought to form our own support group and get help and a possible recovery from most of it since it is not fully curable. THE PAIN! THE PAIN! THE PAIN! THE AWFUL PAIN!

If Daddy Warbucks offered to leave me with his entire fortune to see this movie I would say no!

If PoonJab used his all his magical powers to make me watch this movie it would not work.

22650,5,0767853636,"I actually saw this musical in New York as a kid (in the early 1980's), and I remember sitting in the audience wishing I could play Annie - I think most girls my age were wishing the same thing...

Then, several years ago, I saw the DVD version of this musical, and I fell in love with it all over again.  Each member of the cast is absolutely perfect for their role, and they each play it to the hilt!  The music is great, and it's quite hard to stop yourself from tapping your feet and singing along!

Annie is about a little girl who was left at an orphanage when she was a baby.  The living conditions in this place are absolutely horrible, and the woman who's supposed to be looking after these kids doesn't seem to care about them in the least.  All she cares about is money, booze and men!

In comes a wealthy man who always takes a child from the orphanage each christmas and lets them live in his mansion for a week.  He usually chooses a boy, but this time he sends his assistant to get the child, and she spots Annie right away, & chooses her to come to this amazing palace.

Annie is such an adorable kid - inside & out - that the entire staff at the mansion fall in love with her, and eventually, even the millionaire's heart melts for her.  He's decided that he wants to be her father.  But the ""den mother"" of the orphanage wants to stop this at all costs, and she devises a plan to make a lot of money, and get Annie back all at the same time.

Will Annie ever get to be adopted?  Will the nasty orphanage ""mother"" get her way?  What about all of the other kids that are stuck in that horrible place - what will become of them?  I won't answer any of these questions, as I don't want to ruin it for you if you've never seen it.  Suffice it say that this a wonderful movie, and the endings not one to be forgotten...

I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys musicals, as well as those who are looking for a great movie for ""family night"" - it's one of those movies that the whole family will enjoy.",1124496000,,2030,4.124681933842239
22651,1,0767853636,"""Annie"" was one of the best Broadway musicals of the past 30 years. It relied on content and talented performers instead of high-tech sets and lighting and un-taltented stars. Andrea McArdle as the loveable orphan was actually 13 as the perfect age to play Annie, who was I believe 12 in the stage show. She had a great voice and was tougher than the usual little girl. As Oliver Warbucks, Reid Sheldon was comic and warmhearted and as the beloved Miss Hanigan, Dorothy Loudon was a cynical, boozing broad, just as the charachter was written.

In 1982, Hollywood put its rather dull and child-like stamp on ""Annie."" Not only does this Annie- Aileen Quinn have a horrible voice, but is also cutesy and phony. Albert Finney as Warbucks, although he looks the part, doesn't act the part. There is no pompus humor. As Miss Hanigan, Carol Burnett get the drinking part right, but that's about all she does through the whole movie. Ms. Burnett, although rather funny throughout the film, acts like a drunk through the whole thing. The characther is more than than.

I am a huge fan of Bob Fosse, and Ann Reinking is one of his best dancers, however for this film, her taltnents were not shown. She was miscast for the role of Miss Farrel.

The story was completely revamped to make Miss Hannigan look like a nice charachter. There was also no Arab servant in the stage show.

The music was changed drastically. Did you know ""Tomorrow"" was actually a scene change song in the Broadway show? Well here it is song constantly, terribly as well. ""We Got Annie"" was planned as a song in the Broadway show, but here is sung by a bunch of people who we don't care about. It isn't particulary good here anyway.

And ""Dumb Dog"" doesn't even count as a song. Although the song about the contract invovling Warbucks in Hannigan was comic, it too was dull.

""Annie"" is perhaps the worst stage to screen musicals. How could they ruined this well-written masterpiece?",1121904000,2,1946,4.642441860465116

The original 1977 Tony Award Winning musical Starring Andrea McArdle was simply magnificant!! McArdle is a child genius with an above average voice. She could carry the demands of an Alto and Aileen Quinn basically could not whatsoever!! What I cannot stomach is that so damned many people creamed over this film. It was over-budgeted and awful and as a former star myself; it was made for the pure driven desire of the almighty dollar. The Only reason an Oscar was nominated is because this was one of Houston's last musicals before his death and many of you really are not aware of how Hollywood is so very political in the decision making that goes into nominations and clout. I so very agree with the other (very few) appreciative viewers who have compared the stage version to the film version in that the spirit of Art and Talent just was not there. Finney tried the hardest to make this work and why in the heck would Houston remove the best scores from the original Broadway smash. Talent is very hard to come by and for anything to work; one musn't be so inspired about the money alone. The best films were made by the conviction of the artist. I mean CHICAGO was THE BEST adaptation and can you see the difference? I am glad that it was made for children but to take it seriously as a Oscar Winner is just plain ridiculous. Why do you think that you can purchase the movie for .98!! Great for those who have NO musical background and derive the simplicity of ...well..whatever.

22676,5,0767853636,"I have done reviews for the new ""special edition"" DVD of ""Annie"" and also the Disney remake from 1999.  Both of these were only worthy of 1 star but the actual film from 1982 really deserves 5 stars in my opinion.  ""Annie"" was my favorite movie when I was a kid.  It was always a special treat when my Dad would allow me to stay up late to watch it.  At one point I had actually memorized the entire film line for line.  For a little girl it's a fun movie with great songs.  Now that I am older I can watch the film with new appreciation and really wonder why it didn't get better reviews when it came out.  I may have figured out why that is though.  I believe it had to do with the comparison between the movie and stage musical.  The people who loved the live show seem to be partial to that where as most people who have only seen the movie, like me, think it's great.  I believe the movie stands on it's own when not being compared to anything and had that comparison not been an issue it probably would have received proper reviews.  I understand how people can be partial though.  I definitely am when it comes to this film because it's what I know.  Still, I can't see how certain aspects could go unnoticed.  As I was older I was really able to appreciate Carol Burnett's performance as Miss Hannigan.  I can't imagine anyone making this character come more alive.  She's detestable while being entertaining at the same time.  Disney really missed the mark on this character when they remade to movie.  Another element I can really appreciate as an adult is the relationship between Annie and Daddy Warbucks and how it developed naturally throughout the movie.  He starts out incredibly hard hearted, but through the charm of a dirty, almost homely, little orphan he sees there is more to life than just money and power.  She truly wins him over.  Because of all these things I still love watching this movie through the eyes of my inner child.  It can cause me to get a little misty eyed, but maybe it's because I am a sentimental sap.  There is just so much to enjoy from beginning to end.  I am especially glad I was able to get a copy of this DVD edition before it went out of print because believe me, widescreen is really necessary with this movie.

The reason I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 5 is because of 2 reasons:
1. Miss Hanigan's drunk scenes. Aren't they, um, a bit inappropriate for kids?
2. The dances keep showing their underwear in the dances. They might have at least gave them petticoats or such, or been a bit more careful. You can do a 'kicking dance without showing your unmentionables. Oh well!

Turns out that Mr. Warbucks hosts an orphan in his home every year and this year Grace decided that he needed to host a girl.  Mr. Warbucks soon finds his home and his life turned upside down by this lovable girl and her sunshiny disposition, but Annie still believes that her parents are out there somewhere and may give up her one chance at happiness to find them...
This is by far my favorite version of Annie and I adore most of the songs that are in it.  It is true that they changed the story from the musical and left out a couple of songs, but they just kind of took out all of the political stuff, which most children wouldn't understand anyway.  Annie definitely has the feeling of the Great Depression era though, especially through the costumes, which are very dingy and dull looking.  However, the actors really sparkle in their roles and do a wonderful job.  My favorite is Carol Burnett as Miss Hannigan - she is hysterically funny!

22712,4,0767853636,"Growing up, Annie was one of my all-time favorite movies.  I sang all the songs, played runaway orphan with my friends, and watched the movie over and over on Betamax (for those of you born a bit later, that's like a VHS tape, only smaller).
I was tempted to buy Annie as soon as it came out on DVD, but chose to wait for a version with some decent special features.  Lo, it is here, but there is one thing that I'm really surprised is missing.... where's the behind-the-scenes feature, ""Lights, Camera, Annie!"" which aired on TV back in 1982.  It included auditions for the role of Annie, dance rehearsals, cast/crew interviews, choerography and blocking of ""It's a Hard Knock Life"", a screen test of Aileen Quinn and Albert Finney and vocal rehearsals of ""Easy Street"" with Peters, Curry and Burnett.  That's the kind of thing that should be on a Special Edition DVD, so I'm surprised that since the footage exists (I still have my Beta tape, and surely it exists elsewhere), that they didn't use it.
As much as I appreciate that there is a new version, it seems to be primarily catering to kids.  It would appear they neglected the adults who grew up with the movie and still think of it fondly, and would have appreciated more special features of the behind-the-scenes, as opposed to contemporary interpretations of songs and sing-alongs.
Incidentally, why is this being presented as an ""Anniversary Edition""?  Annie came out in 1982, so it's the...22nd Year Anniversary?

I didn't know til I read other reviews that it is so much of the picture- I never saw this movie in widescreen to know the difference.  To satisfy everybody, and watch one when you don't want the distraction of the black bars, and one when you don't want to miss any of the picture, the special edition should have both versions.  Some dvds do have both versions.  Maybe the'll come out with a version with both on it, and all the extras.  Until then, you can buy this for the full screen edition and the extras, as well as the widescreen edition- without the extras.

22739,1,0767853636,"""Annie"" is the original movie based on the highly successful Broadway musical, based on the highly popular comic strip character - little orphan Annie. I'm going to refrain from reiterating the story herein, because I have already reviewed the previously issued DVD. Herein, I am taking the opportunity to lambast Columbia Home Video.
TRANSFER: IT'S NOT WIDESCREEN. Enough said! You can't squeeze a 2:35:1 aspect ratio image into a 1:33:1 t.v. screen so you get what film buffs, such as myself, have been screaming about for years - a chopped up version of the movie (affectionately known as pan and scan)that in no way captures either the scope of the image or the director's original intent. This short coming alone leads me to fail this DVD on all accounts. That the cropped image is quite often blurry, at times hopelessly out of focus, and truly a weak transfer for its color balancing, contrast and black levels, is inexcusable. I'd really like to know why Columbia decided to re-release this movie on DVD. Certainly, no updates to the image quality have been made and worse still - the film is missing 50% of its picture. Misguided doesn't even begin to sum up Columbia's blunders on this disc. Also, the audio remains the same strident mix as before. No audio clean up or noise reduction leads to dialogue sounding way too forward and unnatural, while the songs screech, rather than sing, across your speakers.
EXTRAS: Some, but not enough to make you forget that ""Annie"" is just about the most miserable looking DVD experience you've seen in a long while.
BOTTOM LINE: To Columbia executives: get a clue! Get a 'really big' clue. To the consumer - save your money!",1071964800,33,1673,4.8125

While I agree with many of the previous reviewers that ANNIE is corny, poorly plotted, etc., I think that they've done something right that makes all that production values stuff unimportant.
My grand-daughter invariably joins in the singing of almost every song.  She gets up and dances with Annie, Molly and the gang during every dance number, and she still, figuratively, sits on the edge of her seat during the big chase scene.  She, unlike the more sophisticated reviewers here, is in love with Molly.  She cries when Molly cries, and feels better when Annie soothes Molly.
What more can one ask from a movie about a little red-headed orphan girl than that other little girls fall in love with her story and want to see it over and over.

22758,3,0767853636,"Based on the comic strip, ""Little Orphan Annie"" which later became a Broadway show that, of course, finally became a big budget movie, ""Annie"" is the 1981 musical from producer Ray Stark and director John Huston.  Odd, that neither had much experience with the musical genre until this film.  Some of their inexperience shows up on the screen.  The dance numbers are butchered in the editing and some good talent, though competent in their roles, are wasted nevertheless with a genuinely simple handling of the subject matter.  But what about the transfer - Columbia has made the film available in both full frame and the original widescreen format, enhanced here for 16X9 televisions.  For the purposes of film purists, this review will concentrate on the widescreen version of the film.  Colors are rich and nicely balanced.  Blacks are sometimes weak but nothing that leads to any great disappointment.  However, there are some framing issues, specifically during the ""Let's Go To The Movies"" musical number in which it appears as though someone has accidentally reframed a full screen version of this sequence, instead of using the 2:35:1 aspect ratio image.  Actor's heads are cut off and there is some interfield jittering as the camera pans to capture the action.  Otherwise, the rest of the film appears to have the proper widescreen image framed.  The ending of this movie is still its best part, with a gala party at the Warbuck's mansion yielding rich colors and bold blacks.  Fine grain, dirt, chips and scratches inherent in the original camera negative are visible but not distracting.  Some scenes are softly focused but again, these are brief. The stereo soundtrack 2.0 is ample but scratchy in spots and strident with a slight hiss in others. No great shakes overall but still worth the price for those who truly love this tuneful, though at times top heavy, musical motion picture.  As pure film, this version is still better than Disney's direct to video remake.",1046736000,2,1981,4.981762917933131
22779,5,0767853636,"Now, I usually give a minimum of stars to poorly done movies, but some films are such so distinctively, exquistely, and deliciously that they are enjoyable enough to receive 5 stars. No one movie exemplifies this sort of film more than ANNIE. 50's B-movies? Too obviously bad. Parodies like The Rocky Horror Picture Show? Too aware of their cleverness. Only Annie blends all the elements of corniness to perfectly form a wonderfully, decadently bad movie.

From the opening scene with that small red-haired child lamenting in a self-indulgent display of musical depression to the closing scene involving small tap-dancing orphans, horses and fireworks, Annie is an amazing display of cheese.
The plot, as you must already know, centers around the delightfully irritating lil' orphan Annie (played to annoying perfection by that wee child never to do anything ever again, Aileen Quinn), a spunky little orphan with a will of iron and a heart of gold, who is, against the odds, chosen by the head of the household of the inconceivably wealthy Oliver Warbucks (Albert Finney brilliantly mastered the art of ""hrumph""ing) to stay at his New York mansion for one week-- and one week only. While at first ""Daddy"" Warbucks is insensitive to the young girl's plight, after a while she starts to warm his little greedy heart. The rest of the cast also plays this movie out splendidly, including the anal retentive, prudish Grace Farrell (played by Ann Reinking) who hyperventilates when Annie tells her she has never played tennis, and who has such intellectually stimulating lines as ""Oh, fiddle faddle!"", and the incompetent Molly (played by Toni Ann Gisondi) who has not the ability to sing, dance (she tries, oh, Lord, she tries), nor cry on cue.
And that's not all. No, no, that's not even the beginning. Watch and you'll see such historically accurate portraits such as the happy, bouncy, (and for some reason completely white) world of 1930s New York, and how a (possibly) mentally deficient red-headed munchkin inspired Franklin Delano Roosevelt to (gasp!) end the Great Depression. Where else will you see FDR, Eleanor, a frightening bald man and a perky little child singing a gratingly catchy inspirational tune around a portrait of George Washington? Nowhere else, that's where.

The music is catchy and easy to learn, so opportunities for parody are limitless. Plot holes and filming mistakes are abundant enough to be funny but not obvious enough to be pretentiously aware of their corniness.

Annie not only has an optimistic view on life but she teaches the other people around her to keep hope alive. Albert Finney is the perfect actor for the part of daddy Warbucks. Albert Finney plays a gruff man who simplty enjoys making money until he meets Annie.  Annie is the movie that will bring a smile to your face and make you realize that dreams can come true if you keep hope alive.  Annie is a great movie that the whole family will want to watch over and over again!,1026518400,,644,4.297520661157025

The only person who could ever play Annie to perfection would be Aileen Quinn, she was made for the role and the way she performs in this movie just makes Annie come alive. Carol Burnett was so hilarious as the role of Miss Hannigan even my mother agrees that no one else could play the part more beautifully than her. As for Tim Curry as the role of Miss Hannigan's twisted brother Rooster couldn't have done it any better, he really knows how to be an evil character. As for Albert Finney as the role of Oliver Warbucks the selfish millionare well his acting is very believable and he does an amazing job. Finally Ann Reinking as Grace Farell did a beautiful job, her character was so sweet and endearing and just the way she played it was perfect. All in all the songs were just brought to life, the acting was believable, the sets were amazing, the costumes were perfect, this movie has it all.",1024531200,13,999,4.405405405405405
22788,1,0767853636,"Has Never Seen the Original Stage Version.  This movie is a preposterous mess and it flopped for one simple reason: it bears little to no resemblance to the brilliant Broadway production of the late seventies.  The musical is full of fun and life, but the people behind this movie decided to go for a more cinematic version which was much darker and could and probably frequently does scare young children.  We have here Miss Hannigan, Rooster, and Lily actually succeeding in capturing Annie (which never originally happened).  We even see the young orphan hanging on to an upraised bridge for dear life (an eleven year old actually in deadly peril?! For shame!!!!)  The added characters (Punjab and the Asp) added nothing but stupidity to an already horrendous film.  How can anyone criticize the Disney film of a few years ago?  It is much closer to the stage version than this monstrosity (and it included one of the best songs cut from the theatrical release - N.Y.C.).  I find it fascinatingly questionable that a cast of this caliber could have been involved in this disaster.  Some of Broadway's legendary performers (Ms. Burnett, Ms. Peters, Ms. Reinkin) should definately have thought twice.  Perhaps they were anticipating a rebirth of the movie musical and went about it totally in the wrong way.  I am so glad that I was involved in a stage production of Annie as Rooster.  One has to wonder how involved Mr. Charnin and Mr. Stousse were in this venture.  I recall seeing only that it was based on their original stage musical (however loosely).",1023667200,6,1558,4.833962264150943

BUT, Albert Finney shows wonderful character development (there's none with Warbucks in the Disney version).  Annie is much spunkier (perhaps overacted, but any spunk is better than no spunk).  Carol Burnett plays Miss Hannigan with comedic genius.  I shudder to even compare her to Disney's ""politically correct"" Hannigan played by the slothful Kathy Bates.  How can you go wrong with Tim Curry and Bernadette Peters, too.
The choreography is athletic and spirited in this version.  The disney version's choreography looked like a poor camp production.
Yes, there are some mix-ups in the setting of the buildings in the background as well as some other things, but this is a very enjoyable musical which, thanks to its whitty script, score, and talent, succeeds on many levels.

Aileen Quinn IS Annie; she becomes the character both inside and out. When you watch her in this movie, it's pretty hard to imagine anyone else who could have done better. She's spunky, sweet, caring, and feisty--that's who Annie is, and that's what Aileen Quinn brought to the character. The singing was outstanding too--this is a great movie for children as well as adults....I've been watching it for as long as I can remember and I still love it.

This 1982 gem is a classic big-budget movie musical, with all the exuberance that the genre implies. How can you help but smile at the thought of fifty orphans simultaneously breaking out into dance numbers?

Ten-year-old Aileen Quinn sings her heart out to the catchy tunes and will have you singing too, despite yourself. Albert Finney is a walking caricature as billionaire capitalist Daddy Warbucks, who learns that there is more to life than money. Anne Reinking puts in a good showing as his assistant, and you'll recognize others such as Bernadette Peters. But Carol Burnett steals the show as the drunken orphanage proprieter who hates little girls but goes ga-ga over any male, from the local cop to Mr. Bundles the Laundry Man.  (This is rated PG rather than G for a reason!)

Very young kids may be frightened by a chase sequence in which the bad guys try to kidnap Annie, but there's plenty here to entertain both children and adults. As a child, I watched it a hundred times without catching allusions to the New Deal, the Bolsheviks, and bathtub gin.

Do not let your kids grow up acquainted only with Disney's dull 1999 remake of Annie! The 1982 movie is twice as exuberant, larger than life, and makes for much better entertainment.",1018051200,26,1352,4.716101694915254

The orphanage is a dump in this one, which is what it's supposed to look like. The mansion is gorgeous, which it is supposed to look like. The cast is so much better in this one, too.

Annie, played by Aileen Quinn, is a red-headed orphan who dreams of life outside of the orphanage. Away from orphanage's head-caretaker. Miss Hannagin, played by Carol Burnett. Through some clever nugging Annie is chosen to stay with ""Daddy"" Warbucks, Played by Albert Fenny, for a week. Things take off from there.
Rounding out the great cast are Ann Reinking, Tim Curry, Bernadette Petters and Geoffery Holder

The director, John Huston, has turned the show into a huge, bellowing blockbuster, with huge fanfares and leaping dancers. The show is really a simple tale of a girl in search of her parents, and who finds a home in the arms of a millionaire.
The climax, with Annie dangling over a bridge thing, is completely unrealistic.

They kept her ditsy in the Disney Version. I will have to say that the Disney Version should have not had a black love interest for Daddy Warbucks. I'm not trying to be racist but it just doesn't make sense for the Depression era to have a mixed relationship.  They should have gotten Rebecca Luker(Miriam the Librarian on Broadway and a friend of mine. She would have been perfect for Grace. Not too impressed with Ann Reinking in this version as Grace. At least Audra McDonald in the Disney version can sing the way it should be. Ann is more of a dancer.

They may just come to love it as much as I did  then and do now.  ""It shines like the top of the Chrysler  Building!""",955152000,5,586,4.079646017699115
22861,5,0767853636,"One of my favorite movie's. I enjoy the songs,the laughter,the character, and the lines. I like the songs Tomorrow,We Got Annie,Its A Hard Not Life and Dumb Dog. When I watched this on The Disney Channel I've only got to  watch half of it.",954979200,2,239,4.431818181818182
22862,5,0767853636,"Since I was very small, ""Annie"" has been one of my very favourite movies.  I love everything about it- the music, the dancing, the story....it's just perfect!  I agree that there are one or two scenes with  a bit more ""adult"" content, but nothing too inappropriate for  young kids (my parents let me watch it at age 4 and they were VERY picky  about that kind of thing).  All in all, a wonderful family musical that I  could watch again and again.  I highly recommend it!",949881600,2,471,4.395348837209302
22863,4,0767853636,"When I first saw Annie at the tender age of 8, I was head over heels in love with it. As time wore on and I entered my preteens, I began to get annoyed with ""Tomorrow"" and sadly put the movie behind me. That  is... Until recently. I watched it again with same enthusiasm as I did when  I was 8. Only this time, I had a whole new appreciation for it. It truly is  a classic... with broadway stars like Bernadette Peters, Tim Curry and  Carol Burnette. This original Annie, played by Aileen Quinn, set the image  for Annie. When one thinks of Annie, they think about the curly red hair  orphan and distinct characters singing memorable tunes like  ""Tomorrow"", ""Little Girls"" and ""You're never fully  dressed without a smile"". Ask any kid in the USA to sing a song from  Annie and they could. It is definately a classic.",949622400,5,817,4.357615894039735
22864,5,0767853636,"I saw this dazzling movie with my family when I was 10 years old and the dance routines will truly blow you away! Annie is quite a spunky young character who found herself flying through such hair-raising adventures,  including the heart-stopping part where she is dangling in empty air from  an open drawbridge (reminds me of the very similar one in the downtown of  Tampa where I grew up). However, there are some parts in this movie that  may be a bit sleazy for young kids, like Carol Burnett acting like a brazen  whore in front of Daddy Warbucks and Rooster hungrily smooching his  dumb-blonde girlfriend after they kidnapped innocent young Annie. But  overall, it's a truly dreamy Norman Rockwellesque ride through The  Thirties.",947462400,3,736,4.879032258064516
22865,5,0767853636,"I cannot imagine how someone could hate this movie. Until now I have seen 79 musicals and would pronounce ANNIE as the best one! If somebody complains about Aileen`s appearance they should reconsidder that Aileen was  just a child herself and had to act, sing and dance. Do you know what that  means for a child?  She had school beside that. I think the producers had  their reasons for selecting her from thousands of girls. I think ANNIE is a  master piece and Aileen did herwork as the leading role more than good. I  have watched the movie almost 10 times now and cannot see any faults.  People keep comparing the movie with the stage musical and are saying the  movie left out so many nice songs, well, they should think about the length  of a movie and of a stage musical. It is easier to turn off the TV than  walking out a theatre. Therefor a movie has to be shorter, which means it  has to cutt out songs. I think that all the staff did great work and that a  masterpiece like that will not come in the nearer future! Whatch the movie  again and then comment!  You will find what a great movie Annie really  is!",947289600,2,1120,4.291866028708134
22876,5,0767853636,"I love this version of Annie, and I have seen the broadway version many times with local acting groups.  Granted there are some songs missing and that was not good but some of the new songs are great such as  ""Sign"" I have seen this movie tons of times and I still love it.  I like the new Disney version of Annie but felt that it lacked something.  I guess my impression of Annie has always been based more in this movie and  I just couldn't get into the other one.  I just love Annie but I don't  think that some of these other reviews do justice to this movie.  I guess  everyone just needs to see it for themselves.  I own both versions and  watch both of them but I have to say I enjoy this version more.",946944000,2,709,4.028776978417266
22877,5,0767853636,"I've always loved htis movie since I was a kid, and still love this movie. Even though this movie had some flaws, thoes flaws wewe quickly replace, let me give you some examples.
1. It didn't focus on the depresion that  much, but did have a five minute scene focusing on it.
2. it cut out 5  songs from this musicla, but replaces them with 5 show-stoping numbers,  such as (and my personal favorite song) ""Sign"" wich was made up  by Carol Burnett and Albert FInney.
  Now compare it ot the'99 Diney  virsion. 1. THis version has the radio studio scene with ""Bert  Healy"" during ""Your Never Fully Dressed"" were the Disney  does not.
2. This version has a 6 minute version of ""Easy  Street"", with The villins by themselfs, while the disney version has  about a 4 minute number with them dancing in the street, so it's easy to  focus on whats going on in the backround.
  Now these, and other  factors, can tribute to the conclusion that this version is by far more  better then the Disney. another thing I like about this version is it has  an All-Star cast, with such actors Carol Burnett, Albert Finny, Tim Curry,  and a special apperance by Peter Marshall of game show fame. THis relly is  truly THe best version ever",946771200,3,1219,4.459090909090909
22878,2,0767853636,"A terrific, outstanding cast couldn't save this one.  Rule #1 in transferring musical to screen--never, EVER tamper with the numbers.  For some reason, the musical was completely retooled for the film, with half of  its best numbers dropped.  If you've never heard or seen the original  musical production, this version has nothing to do with the actual broadway  show.  Consequently, it's way inferior.  What made the musical great was  that it wasn't just about ""Annie,"" but Christmas and the Great  Depression.  There's nothing about that in here, so the movie loses all the  poignancy of the original.
Rule #2--to make a successful show to screen  transfer, the numbers have to be shot in a fantasy style.  Sounds corny,  but I'm telling  you--it works (See the modern version of ""Pennies  From Heaven."" As gritty as the storyline is, it works as a musical  precisely because the numbers are shot so unrealistically). When you shoot  a musical in a completely realistic style, no matter how good it is it will  never have the magical feel that makes musicals feel so special; the film  will just look like a regular movie with a bunch of dopes singing out of  context for no reason.  That's exactly what happens here. There's no magic  or charm in this ""Annie,"" although the cast had enough of it. Oh,  well--what a shame--this could have been better than it was.",946339200,11,1367,4.813852813852814
22879,3,0767853636,"Having read many of the other bad comments about this movie, I was lead to believe that maybe my own first impression could have been wrong. But then I went and watched the movie again. Wrong! I was right. The movie is great.  I really do not understand how any one can NOT like this movie. AND I HAVE  SEEN A LOCAL PRODUCTION OF ''ANNIE'' RECENTLY. The play, like the 1999  movie is quite nice, but it just doesn't have that spark, and liveliness  that this movie does. What would lead others to call this movie ''charmless  and dull'' is beyond me. I do not agree at all. I have read many reviewers  trying to persuade potential viewers into seeing or buying the new 1999  movie version. ( I have also read an extremely biased nasty review by a  ''Lori.'') I have news for all those desiring to see the new version: it is  a sweet, nice version. But there is no comparison. That movie perhaps does  have a better sense of setting than this old version.( and the play I saw  did have an enjoyable song called '' We'd like to thank you Herbert  Hoover.'') After seeing the play, I wish some of the songs could have been  included here. But the play seemed missing something. People call this  movie ''overblown... happening in a void, overacted...''But this movie was  really TRYING. The actors were confidant, and gave STRONG performances. (  While Alicia Morton as Annie, gave a quiet, calm, quite lifeless  performance, and Andrew Garber as Daddy Warbucks can never compare with  Albert Finney.) I do agree some good songs were left out- and I wish those  had been added here. But certain scenes:( the car chase, the interaction  between Hannigan, and Warbucks) are sorely missed in the new version. This  movie does add a lot of things to the musical. But new characters, and  overlaying, enthusiastc plots make the movie multi-faceted to me anyway.  Plus a lot of songs such as '' We've got Annie'', ''Sign'', and '' Dumb  Dog.'' are very enjoyable. All in all, this seemed to me a nice movie, and  very enthusiastically produced.",945475200,6,2035,4.6016713091922
22880,1,0767853636,"Here's a movie musical that almost no one feels middle-of-the-road about, you either truly love it, or you truly hate it.  Most people who love this film don't seem to have been exposed to the play, with its great  song-stack, straight-ahead plot, and well-drawn characters.  The mega-buck  film version, directed by John Huston, was crafted to make the material  more ""cinematic"" and more exciting.  Not entirely bad goals, but  not well executed here.  Trashing the score wasn't a good idea, and tacking  on a chase-and-resue climax wasn't a good idea.  In fact, other than the  splendid casting, and a couple of the numbers (""Little Girls"",  ""Sign"", ""We Got Annie"")this whole movie wasn't a good  idea.  Inflated beyond reason, wasting a very good Broadway score, and  under-utilizing the pros in the cast, poor ANNIE arrived on screen having  to prove herself all over again.  Producer Ray Stark honestly believed that  this film would be his greatest success.  Putting a faithful adaptation up  there on the screen might have given him a run at that goal, but as it is,  the movie is a disaster of immense proportions.  Watch the superior Disney  / ABC-TV version instead.",945302400,15,1177,4.953608247422681
22881,2,0767853636,"Having seen the original Broadway stage production with Andrea MacArdle back in 1978,this movie version directed by John Huston is a MAJOR disappointment. The movie version should have been a wonderful expansion of  the stage original, but this was not to be. Bordering on disaster, the  movie ANNIE has little to recommend it. A former review posted here by  Carolyn says it all. The movie replaced great songs from the stage  original(NYC,etc) with horrible new ones (DUMB DOG, WE GOT ANNIE, LETS GO  TO THE MOVIES,etc). There is nothing in this film that evokes the 1930s  Great Depression era the movie takes place in (where is the HOOVERVILLE  sequence). The movie in loaded with errors in regard to time and place. For  example, if Warbucks' 5th Ave Mansion is as expansive as shown in the  movie, it would have to located in Central Park; the movie Annie attends is  CAMILLE which never played at Radio City Music Hall and premiered in 1937  (not 1933 when the movie takes place, in fact RC Music Hall opened in late  1932); in the stage version the chracters attend a performance at the ROXY  Theatre which is as it should be; the New York in the movie ANNIE is a  mixture of unconvincing Hollywood sets and poor location shots which have a  1970s look and feel(why so many modern buildings in the background). Annie  as performed by Aileen Quinn is a pint size Ethel Merman who looks strong  enough to take on an army, she exhibits little heart and comes across as a  phony. Most of the other cast members are wasted or under perform thier  roles. Which brings me to the awful finale as presented in the move; the  stage version ends at Christmas while the movie becomes a summer circus;  Miss Hannigan is carried off to jail in the original while in the movie she  is seen drunkinly riding a circus elephant. What were producer Ray Stark  and John Huston trying to do? It baffles me to this day. Watch the ABC  Disney version of ANNIE it is not as good as the stage original but much  better than this awful movie version.",943660800,16,2032,4.562326869806094
22882,1,0767853636,"What an AWFUL movie adaptation of such a fun, charming musical!  The film is so syrupy, it oozes along at 2 mph.  I loved the original musical & have the Broadway cast cd, I saw it on a 1979 National Tour, and in a 1987 DC-area production, I played Cecille the maid, a ""lovely Boylan  sister"" and Frances Perkins in The White House.  So I'm very familiar  with the original musical.
First big mistake:  John Huston as director.  BAD CHOICE.  A lot of good songs like ""We'd Like to Thank You,  Herbert Hoover,"" ""Annie"" & ""NYC"" were cut, and  their replacements like ""Sign,"" ""Let's Go To The  Movies"" & ""Dumb Dog"" are much worse!  This musical is  supposed to be set in December 1933.  It's The Depression folks.  So why  set it in a movie set that screams sunny, small-town California!  The  5000 or so orphans that climb out of the woodwork of the orphanage:  what  were they - finalists in the Kiddie Olympics?  Everybody is doing  difficult flips & huge leaps & tumbling.
Albert Finney was  miscast.  He could not sing in the movie musical ""Scrooge"" and he  cannot sing here.  I suppose that's a big reason why the songs Daddy leads  or solos like ""NYC"" or ""Something Was Missing"" were  deleted.  He looks & sounds VERY uncomfortable in the role.  Carol  Burnett does nothing with the Miss Hannigan role.  How original to play her  as constantly drunk & constantly vamping the men.  Tim Curry is  absolutely too creepy as Rooster.  Just a few years after playing the  bizarre cross-dresser Frank-N-Furter in ""The Rocky Horror Show,""  that's all you can think of when you see him in this (he can do better,  folks.  I saw him do a wonderful job as the lead in the musical ""Me  & My Girl"" on tour and he was NOT creepy there).
Bernadette  Peters once again plays a ditzy vamp here, which is pretty much the only  role she can  play, and it gets old.
A previous comment mentioned that  the orphan girls kept flashing their underwear.  Add to that the maids in  Warbucks' mansion flashing their slips, panties & garter belts in  ""I Think I'm Gonna Like It Here"" & ""We Got Annie"".  Ann Reinking is a better dancer than singer, songs were transposed to a  lower key to fit her husky alto, & the director gave a millionaire's  secretary implausible & gratuitous dance numbers to give her something  to do.
The movie has a goof somebody should have corrected:  if it's 1933, why are they showing the 1937 film ""Camille"" at Radio City Music Hall?  A great film choice for a 10-year old kid, too...
In the musical Annie is supposed to  be 11, but is always cast older to convey the street-smart grit needed for  the role.  Aileen Quinn was 10 when cast, and no matter how well she  tap-danced & sang for the audition, she was too young & naive in  the role to give Annie any real scrappiness or depth.  Her performance only  adds to the cloying sweetness.
In sum: a waste, a movie & soundtrack  to be avoided.  Instead, PLEASE buy or rent the 1999 Disney television  movie.  It is MILES better, much more faithful to the musical, better cast  & MUCH better directed!  Or even better, see a local production of the  original musical.  See what you are missing...",942537600,15,3153,4.479573712255773
