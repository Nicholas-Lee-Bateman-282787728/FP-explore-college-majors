His process is quick and in the end you learn how to accomplish a very tight rendering of a production quality cityscape. This artist is immensely talented and his years of experience shows in his work, being able to follow his process is a real treat!",1356134400,,396,4.671428571428572
8131205,2,B000GETV5A,"I bought this DVD expecting a series of step by step tutorials on Matte Painting. What I got was a very talented and accomplished artist speed teaching Matte Painting concepts. As best I can figure the video speed was increased by ~3x  in order to fit all the contents on one DVD.  The audio track is at normal speed, but most of the painting is done in full screen mode so its impossible to see the work flow. Occasionally you can see what option was set, or setting was clicked but most of the time you can't. Had this DVD came out of warp into sub-light speed, and showed work flow, I would have given it five stars.",1196640000,5,619,4.237288135593221
