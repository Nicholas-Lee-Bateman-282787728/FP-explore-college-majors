For a movie with a very small budget of $7,000, it sure has great pacing, memorable characters, pleasant humor and over the top action. Originally, this movie was going to be direct to video in Mexico until executives at Columbia Pictures loved the film and released in theaters. Rodriguez became a well known director and started the Mexico trilogy with El Mariachi being the first installment. The sequels were Desperado and Once Upon a Time in Mexico. This movie's main language is Spanish but the VHS copy I own is an English dub (even a 2001 reprint) and there's also a subtitled version as well if you all want to hear the film's original language with English subtitles.",1489536000,,751,4.875
8182249,3,B00000F3XT,"Once again, when I put in a search for Colin Mochrie, El Mariachi comes up.  But Colin is not in the movie.  I don't know why this happens.  Same with Tell Me No Lies.  He is supposed to be there, but is not.  Not in end of movie credits on either movie.  Puzzling.",1017360000,,265,3.9056603773584904
