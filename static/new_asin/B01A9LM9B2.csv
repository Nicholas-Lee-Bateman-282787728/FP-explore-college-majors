7595806,3,B01A9LM9B2,"We can all sit around and profess our love for Hitchcock and his cerebral thrillers that changed cinema forever. But films like ""Disturbia"" show just how unhip the old man is becoming. This is quite obviously a ""Rear Window"" rip off with our hero here Kale (Shia LeBeouf) being restrained to his premises by a police tag as opposed to a broken leg. He gets bored, notices a strange neighbor, suspects foul play, gets in over his head. Only now everybody is 20 years younger and the main focus is keeping the camera fixed on the hot young things as they slip in and out of their bathing suits. There is a lot to like here but an enjoyable first half gives way to a generic suspense thriller that is really only tacked on because we the people demand it.

Kale is in trouble because after his dad's death some smart mouthed teacher cracks wise about it and subsequently gets his clocked cleaned for his trouble. I found it odd that Kale's mother thought that defending her late husband's honor was less important that protecting some lame know-it-all's jaw, but what do I know? And since Kale is not spending his house arrest time constructively (this is implied by showing him playing X-Box, watching trash TV and spending alone time in the bathroom. . .but I digress) all of his modern amenities are taken away by his mother, leaving him and his unoccupied brain to spy on the neighbors. This part of the film, a razor sharp commentary on the suburbs (it is apparently filled with perverted little boys and mass murderers) is darn good. I also really liked Kale's interactions with his friends Ronnie and Ashley as I found them to be realistically centered on sex, technology and insults. You will, however, have to forgive them the scene lifted directly from ""Girl Next Door,"" wet blonde hair and all. But as time passed my generally good mood gave way to a sense of aggravation. Why did the three acts have to be carved in stone? Why was everything so predictable? Why did they even include the horror aspects? Once I realized that everything would go down exactly as I thought it would my positive review turned into a negative one.

As with all Peeping Tom movies the director here (DJ Caruso) felt the need to point out that we the viewer are also watchers. This is especially effective here as we the viewer ogle Ashley's body we have to watch the somewhat disturbing shot of Kale doing the same thing. I'm sure this point was lost on most of the popcorn-munchers (especially the linebacker seated directly next to me) but it was a neat touch to be simultaneously jealous of and repulsed by Kale's hair sniffing. To make matters worse the Ashley character is one dimensional, just a tease with control of her sexuality well beyond her years.  Not that Kale minds as his attention turns from infatuation into possessiveness.  LaBeouf's performance is awesome as that rarest of creations, a Hollywood character I actually sympathize with. He just wants to have fun and spend some time with the ladies, and he does not want the cops, teachers or parental figures to get in the way. We all know by now that he is a star in the making, but this film confirmed his actual acting ability to me. ***",1180224000,2,3197,4.603508771929825

7595829,2,B01A9LM9B2,"It is a ""Meh"" movie that is a decent time killer. Most of the time I spent analyzing the kid that is played by Shia Lebouf and wondering what mental disorder he must have that keeps him in a near constant state of hyperactivity, boredom, and some catastrophic crisis. After being couped in his house a few days he begins acting like a spoiled 10 year old that has had 15 or so high caffeine beverages. He then decides that it is alright to become a stalker simply because he has nothing better to do. I began to wonder who is more disturbed in Disturbia the kids or the serial killer. They should have used this movie as a how to not parent handbook. ""New Mom's do you see what Shia's mother did? Yeah, don't do that.""",1495756800,,718,4.248175182481752

7595834,3,B01A9LM9B2,"It seems to me like when this movie came out.  It got a bad rap for being a copy of Rear Window.  I saw Rear Window for the first time about ten years or so ago.  And I think this is better.  I didn't really know who any of the actors in this were.  Although David Morse is one of those actors who when I see him I remember his face but cant think of what he has been in.
Any way it looked like Shia LeBeouf was going to be a big star and then he started having personal problems.  Anyway he plays a teen who was with his Father when he got killed in a car accident.  And never quite comes to terms with it.  Then gets under house arrest when he hits a teacher.  His Mom takes his t.v. away,  So he starts spying on his neighbors.  He learns the routine of his neighbors including two kids who are pirating porn.  There is also a new girl that moved in next door.  A very stunning Sarah Roemer who keeps her curtains open at night and the lights turned off.
A woman turns up missing and he starts suspecting that another neighbor might have been involved.  The neighbor also starts suspecting that he is being watched.  This is a very suspenssful movie.  Although when the neighbor starts getting close with the Mom.  About the last thirty minutes turn into a straight ahead horror movie.",1487721600,,1288,4.170731707317073

Kale manages to escape the wreck but Daniel is unfortunately killed. One year later, near the end of the school year, Kale still traumatized by his father's death has become very unmotivated and uncaring in his school work.

After assaulting his Spanish teacher following a remark he made about his father, a sympathetic judge lets Kale off easy by sentencing him to a 3 month duration of house arrest for his summer vacation. Boredom quickly strikes but is somewhat eased when cutesie, Ashley Carlson moves in next door with her parents. Kale begins spending most of his days, spying on Ashley's every move with a pair of binoculars he has. After witnessing what appears to be a murder at his eerie neighbor, Robert Turner's house, Kale begins to wonder if Mr. Turner is the same person responsible for the local murders that have been getting reported in the news. As Kale delves deeper into his search for answers, his quest becomes a matter of life and death, not just for him, but those associated with him",1472688000,,1184,4.803921568627451

7595858,3,B01A9LM9B2,"DISTURBIA from 2007 began promisingly, but deteriorated toward its end.  The idea of updating REAR WINDOW from 1954 to the 21st Century is sound (instead of Jimmy Stewart confined to a small apartment with a broken leg, we have teenaged Shia LeBoeuf electronically confined to his house and yard for the summer after slugging a teacher who goaded him).  The principal actors are all fine, especially LeBoeuf in the troubled lead role, Sarah Roemer as his would-be new girlfriend, and David Morse as the suspiciously behaving neighbor who ""only wants privacy.""  Unfortunately, the movie turns from interesting psychological interplay to something like a routine stalker movie in its last quarter, complete with a hostage and chasing through the basement.  DISTURBIA is entertaining -- but hardly surprising.  People who have seen neither movie would probably be much better off with REAR WINDOW.",1466553600,,894,5.3120567375886525

Before Shia was live streaming himself watching his own movies, he was acting like nobody's business.
As a troubled teen dealing with losing his dad, he gets into an unfortunate situation where he's on house arrest. This leads him to observe his neighbors in an attempt to break his boredom. Sounds good as long as it's the new girl next door but he shortly realizes another neighbor might not be just the quiet lawn cutting man he appears. As the news plays clips of women being murdered, he has to find out if his imagination is getting the best of him or something much more horrific. The music is quite good as well.",1447286400,,748,4.427536231884058

7595927,5,B01A9LM9B2,"I love Hitchcock's Rear Window and the whole idea of seeing a murder but being able to do nothing about it until it's too late.  (That was creepier than I had intended.)  While Rear Window has more of a psychological twist, keeping the darkness hidden to creep out viewers, Disturbia uses action, thrills, and a great performance by the whole cast to keep you freaked out about what is happening.  This film is made for a younger audience than Rear Window and has a teen twist which keeps it from reaching the sophistication in Rear Window.  Still this film keeps the thrill alive and adapts the story very well, supplying exactly what we want in a modern thriller.  Is the ending predictable?  Yes.  Is it good regardless?  Oh yes.",1433462400,,732,4.62015503875969

7595983,4,B01A9LM9B2,"Americans HATE teenagers lately. There's a great This American Life where John Hodgman asks a woman if, granted with a superpower, she would have any desire for a teenage sidekick. I paraphrase here just a little bit. ""Yeah, sure,"" says the woman, ""Someone with powers that complement mine, that would be good.""
""No,"" says Hodgman, ""The sidekick wouldn't have any powers.""
""Oh,"" says the woman, with an air of repulsion. ""You mean it would just be a...teenager...hanging out with me? No. No.""
There's one star who has done an extremely good job at getting around this antipathy, Shia LaBeouf, and for good reason: he can really act. He's not the only one, but he has really excellent chops and they're on display here.
And Denzel Washington may be the most famous alumnus of that incredible show, St Elsewhere, but my favorite is David Morse, for performances like the one he gives here.
And what red-blooded, heterosensitive male can object to the brilliant Sarah Roemer prancing around in a skimpy string bikini. Not me!!!",1417305600,4,1024,4.92485549132948

7596011,5,B01A9LM9B2,"While the filmmakers don't call this a remake of ""Rear Window"" (there was actually a lawsuit over this issue), this movie does provide a nice twist on this classic tale.  Kale Brecht, played by Shia LaBeouf, is placed on house arrest after he punches his teacher, the man having made a snide remark about his recently deceased father.  While confined to his house, Kale takes to spying on his neighbors and comes to believe that the man living next door, played by David Morse, is a serial killer.  This film is full of witty dialogue, especially from the teenaged actors, and most of it is funny.  You might think it's just another slasher film, and I'll admit that the ending sort of goes down that road, but it overall strives to be something more.  Overall, it succeeds.  The kids are likable...and more importantly, relatable.  David Morse is wonderfully creepy.  The plot never slacks off, though it does lag very slightly at times...personally I'd rather have that than if there was constant danger and suspense from beginning to end.  And it's not just some film about teenagers.  I liked it.  You might too.  Go ahead and give it a watch.  Enjoy.",1404000000,,1155,4.715
7596012,5,B01A9LM9B2,"I really liked this movie! Shia LeBeouf plays a boy who lost his father in a car wreck. After that he doesn't care about anything and gets into trouble for punching out his Spanish teacher. He is stuck at home for weeks wearing a security bracelet that will send out an alarm if he leaves the house. During that time his mom takes away the video games and tells him to clean the house. When he's done with all that, he spends his time looking out the window and notices his next door neighbor doing suspicious things. What happens next ?

7596016,5,B01A9LM9B2,"The movie is a great thriller with a good amount of comedy sprinkled throughout. I think many teenagers would get a kick out of this movie. Not to say adults won't. I just believe this movie is geared more toward the 12-25 age group. But like I said everyone can get something out of it. Shia Labeouf's character in this movie Kale is 17 and I found I myself (being 18) could relate to him in a lot of ways which always makes for a better movie in my opinion, because you have somewhat of a personal connection tied in with the character from that point out. And there's even a little romance in there. When a hot girl moves in next door the Kale he finds himself very interested in her. And who could forget the possible murderer living next door to Kale! If you like suspense, thrillers, romance, and comedy all rolled up into one. I highly recommend this movie.",1397952000,,864,4.339506172839506

7596035,3,B01A9LM9B2,"I'd give the film 3-1/2 stars if possible instead of 3. In spite of a court ruling otherwise, it's so similar to Alfred Hitchcock's classic thriller, Rear Window, that it reeks of being a shameless remake using high school teens and a different premise to confine the protagonist to his room with little to do but spy on the neighbors. It's obvious the low levels of profane language, graphic violence portrayed, and mild sexual content were deliberate to get an MPAA PG-13. It allows marketing to include targeting the Jr. high and high school freshman/sophomore demographic. Horror film aficionados accustomed to the more typical ""R"" rated movies in the genre may find it tame as a result. In spite of this, its pace keeps moving without bogging down, with a good level of action and builds suspense well, maintaining it until the end, even if the general outcome is fairly predictable to maintain its appeal to a wider audience demographic.

Blu-ray transfer is very good, including the excellent audio -- to be expected for a 2007 film. Extras include a ""making the film"" featurette, deleted scenes and a few outtakes, plus a music video. I would give it 3-1/2 stars if possible and primary reason for the downgrade is its excessively strong similarity to Hitchcock's Rear Window when the story could -- and should -- have been more original. The PG-13 rating is entirely appropriate and would have no problem with young teens viewing this film.",1379116800,,1449,4.890243902439025

Having now seen it, I am happy to say that the creative staff carried it off and made an entertaining movie. No, Hitchcock's ghost need not haunt the filmmakers for outdoing him, no fear of that, but, on their own turf, they made it work. The young actors playing the two key and one supporting role, do a good job, and the adult cast manage to hold their own. The gimmick of house arrest to duplicate the effects of Jimmy Stewarts broken leg, is a good touch, particularly the notion of a limited range of activity. Recommended not only for teens but for the general audience as well (barring the youngsters who might be reinforced in the, apparently, prevalent notion among them, that nobody has a right to  privacy and anything you want to film and transmit is fair game, including your own naked body).",1364688000,,907,4.552147239263804

When there is 50+ years in-between the original and the re-make you know it's going to be so different, that they are hardly the same movie anymore. The only similarity in fact, is spying on a neighbor whom the lead suspects is a serial killer. Shia LaBeouf shines in what is his first major leading role. Right from the beginning you can see how likeable he is on film, destine for stardom. David Morse is also great as the neighbor. Morse is always very intense and makes every movie he is in that much better, he is an extremely underrated supporting actor.

In this updated version, the hero is bound to his home via house arrest and an ankle bracelet, instead of being confined to a wheel chair.

7596061,4,B01A9LM9B2,"Disturbia was not the resurgence of the suspense thriller genre, but for what it set out to be, I think it serves its purpose quite well. This is a well-done, teen suspense flick. It's good to entertain for a couple hours every now and then, and not much more. But that's all it set out to do, so that is quite alright. In fact, ""quite alright"" is a great way to describe this fun little movie. Why people feel the need to constantly insult Shia Labeouf is beyond me. I don't find him to be the douche bag that many others call him. But what do I know? I don't track the man's every move. As far as this film goes, I liked him a lot as the lead. His hot-headed, youthful charm added a lot to the movie, in my opinon. For how frequently these types of teen thrillers turn out to be duds, I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem. The humor is sophomoric for the most part, but still fresh. The suspense is great. I never really clinched up like I did the first time I saw it in the theatre, but i still enjoy it nevertheless.

Shia LaBeouf has always entertained, and David Morse and Carrie-Anne Moss are established and admired performers. I enjoyed it all, and I thought Sarah Roemer had more depth than many others. Certainly, suggestions of Hitchcock, which is not a bad thing, but also a bit of coming-of-age stuff, teen situations, etc. I had no problem with that. I thought Aaron Yoo as Ronnie was consistently appealing. Without everyone trying to make comparisons and point out what's wrong, I would only like to say what's right; mainly,  enjoyed it a lot, with no pre-conceived prejudice. I enjoy movies about kids doing good stuff; the Percy Jackson film was enjoyable and I hope there's another. I'm 62 years old, and am tired of the angst-ridden stuff about mean and rotten kids. This stuff is prevalent. I'd rather be entertained about good kids, hoping there might be a future for ALL kids. ""The Spiderwicke Chronicles"" is another that I admire; kids will always be misunderstood, but will prevail, if only in the movies. Food for thought.",1306972800,,1174,4.840796019900497

At first, the main character seems like a ""bored out of his mind kid"" whose imagination about his next-door neighbor is ""running wild"" as he's carried away by his spying observations (so seems like nothing at first).  But, then, the story-line picks up and the movie gets better.

It's not a DISGUSTING movie (there's really no bloody-gore) and the end is how, in MY own personal opinion, a movie SHOULD end.  The story-line has a good beginning, a fairly-good climax (suspenseful) point, and a GOOD ending..and I truly mean an ENDING, meaning there is an actual END and not a cliff-hanger making way for unlimited sequels. It's a bit of a ""teeny-bopper"" movie, (as the main characters are HS teenage kids) but it's a GOOD story-line with a good END, I think people can enjoy!",1295827200,,860,4.706666666666667

7596076,1,B01A9LM9B2,"Wow. Simply wow. Remake? please. It's a remake in that the film makers take a Hitchcock film, add in a bunch of rubbish chick flick scenes, high-tension instrumental music with the ever so clich timed crescendos, and advertise it as a thriller. Give it a mysterious, exotic sounding name like Disturbia and you guarantee a box office hit for fools. Seriously, Hollywood, the people-popping-out-of-nowhere kind of scares is stupid and lame. Stop doing it. That's not a thriller. That's like a twelve year old kid hiding behind a door and yelling boo right when you walk in and getting a boner off how much of a scaredy cat you are. DJ Caruso ought to be ashamed. This should've won the raspberry for the worst editing job in the history of cinematography. The first twenty minutes of Disturbia were an absolute waste of time. The whole part with Shia getting father and son time, then showing all the traumatic experience of his father getting killed - seriously just cut it down to five minutes and get on with the suspense, speaking of which is virtually nonexistent. The relationship between Ashley and Kale, however, was something the director decided to develop upon quite thoroughly. . . IN A THRILLER?! Are you kidding me, if this is a thriller then so is Scary Movie.

I watched the ""Bart of Darkness"" Simpsons episode so I know basically what's about to happen. Main character is somehow stuck inside his house, he suspects his neighbor of murder, goes to investigate and bad guy goes down. The only thing different here is a hot girl is added into the mix. Do thrillers these days work on craft anymore? Or do they rely on the marketing team to advertise a potentially good plot to cover for bad direction and a hopeless script? I can't say it was the acting. The script was so terrible I'm not sure if high profile actors like Shia LaBoeuf were needed.

In both Transformers and Disturbia, they decided to add unbelievably hot women to act as Shia's strangely empowered bimbo. Basically they serve no other role than the fodder for the pubescent boys part of the audience who have nothing but to masturbate to sensually clad models and side boob shots or other such implicit nudity. Cheesy ""The Notebook"" inspired lines like ""when I look at into the world I'm only looking at you"" - then they go upstairs to makeout - make it hard to believe otherwise. And seriously all those shots of the hot girl taking her top off, doing yoga, changing into her bikini like she's a penthouse model - lame. What a cheap move to attract the testosterone induced mass. The most injurious slight about this is it's PG-13. Yea like Alexander Pope said, ""Drink deep or taste not the Pierian Spring.""

I'm sorry to give it one star. I'd love to give a film whose plot had so much promise two stars, but the only thing motivating to finish this movie after the first thirty minutes was so I have the right to criticize it. Characters were so pathetic, I didn't give a damn if the bad guy actually killed them off. And thanks for making these films so realistic. I wish a hot girl like that would move in next door to me so I can deliver some cheesy one liners and therefore fool her into thinking I'm a sensitive nice guy who wants more than to have sex with her.",1284422400,4,3252,4.565068493150685

7596078,4,B01A9LM9B2,"Though Disturbia has its quirks and its problems, it is a great film that is well beyond what I thought it would be. When I first watched it in the theaters I was enamored over Shia LaBeouf's performance. He seemed natural, and he didn't seem like he was playing any other part but himself which was a perfect fit for me. He has found his niche early and will most likely stick with it for a while. The natural triad of young characters definitely personifies the typical high schooler in summer vacation in the suburbs. It fits well, to say the very least.

The story itself focuses around the triad of teenagers, Kale, Ronnie, and Ashley. After Kale gets put under house arrest he spends his time stalking, or spying, on the neighbors, finding out everything about their lives. He starts to recognize the signs of a killer in his neighbor Robert Turner. The trio set to work trying to prove this as true but are often preoccupied by other ""more important"" teenage things. Mixing humor with drama, romance, and horror gives this movie a certain appeal to any kind of watcher.

The serial killer himself, Robert Turner, is played by David Morse. He has a very Hannibal Lecter, Anthony Hopkins, look to him. He's polite, dresses nicely, is always presentable, and yet he's a sociopath. He has this sexually disturbing aura to him and we know from the get-go that he is the killer, beyond any shadow of a doubt. His first lines address a rabbit stuck in a trap in his garden and it gives us the thought that perhaps this is how he speaks to his victims.

The final scene is short, but chilling. Reminding us of Buffalo Bill's basement, only in modern day suburbia. Hidden walls and additions to homes, walls of dirt with rickety floorboards that hold bodies. It certainly causes one's flesh to crawl.

The movie's drama need some help since it is oftentimes melodramatic but it is well put together and has a nice flow of events. Really, that's my only complaint. Well worth the watch!",1275955200,,1983,4.609065155807365
7596079,4,B01A9LM9B2,"DISTURBIA is a fun modernization of REAR WINDOW, updated for the Information Age of video games, webcams, and cell phones. It finds a troubled young teen who is sentenced to house arrest after a violent episode at school. With nothing left to do, he takes to watching the neighbors, but finds out more than he wanted to when he witnesses a series of suspicious activities taking place next door. For a polished Teen Horror flick, it delivers plenty of action, comedy, and suspense in a pretty little package. Shia LeBeouf hits his stride as the average, everyday boy next door in a winning performance that is single-handedly responsible for the overall success of the picture. The script is smart and well written considering its target audience, which allows for a greater appeal to both the teen and older Horror crowds. Where the film makes its greatest misstep is in its largely overblown finale, which would have been much more effective if it had been scaled back to a more subtle end. While it doesn't reinvent the wheel, DISTURBIA makes for an entertaining watch with a fresh twist on the voyeuristic theme laid out in the Hitchcock classic.

7596080,2,B01A9LM9B2,"It is amazing how any of the previous reviewers can compare this competent, OK movie to the classic REAR WINDOW. I would call this mindless comparison just blasphemous.
The only similarity in both of these movies is a house-bound man observing all his neighbors with his binoculars.
This movie begins nicely and with a strong bang, with the flashback of the father dying in a car crash that almost seems intentional, (the future killer?). It continues to move at a nice pace, but it soon moves to the ridiculous stage, and later, to the all-too-predictable ending.

7596081,4,B01A9LM9B2,"I didn't expect much of this film when it came on TV the other night - I thought it would be another pathetic teen movie and that would be it...but I can admit when I am wrong.

Kale was a surprising sympathetic character considering his situation of being under house arrest. Ronnie, his best friend, was entertaining and full of life - Ashley was of course the drop-dead gorgeous girl next door (my only complaint, the cast were rather ""normal"" people next door - why couldn't they cast a normal sized girl instead of one who looks like a model?). But that was perhaps my only critism of the movie.

It was well paced, creepy in places and even during the climax had me fixated on the TV screen. Sure the story may not have been all that original but it was nice to watch a movie without hearing offensive language in every sentence or with overused blood and gore.

When he punches his Spanish teacher at school, he is sentenced to three months of house-arrest during his vacations. Kale snoops his neighbors with a binoculars and video camera for killing time, and becomes a voyeur of his next door neighbor Ashley Carlson. When Ashley sees Kale and his friend Ronnie at the window, he tells out of the blue that their neighbor Robert Turner seems to be a wanted serial killer from Austin, Texas. The trio sneaks around his house, and Kale begins to suspect that Mr. Turner might really be the murderer.

With the main character trapped in a house gazing through a pair of binoculars, we have sort of a contemporary teenage twist on Rear Window, although with much more aggressive killer.

Kale Brecht (Shia LaBeouf) is serving home detention for slugging his teacher.  The transmitter on an ankle bracelet, keeps the seventeen year old from leaving the boundaries of his suburban yard.  With lots of time on his hands, he takes to spying on his neighbors, particularly Ashley (Sarah Roemer), a hot blonde that has just moved in next door.  Before long Ashley, and Kale's friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) are engaged in the surveillance of neighbor Robert Turner (David Morse), a mysterious guy with strange habits, they suspect of being a serial killer.

And Turner has the uncanny habit of popping up where you least expect, in the Brecht kitchen after helping Kale's mom Julie (Carrie Anne Moss) with car trouble, and later at the window of Ashley's car.  What happens is fairly predictable, but still suspenseful and funny.  Turner's home with its secret torture chamber and burial vault cellar, is too much to take seriously.  The killer's demise, while a little unsatisfying, is thankfully swift.

Shia LaBeouf's (Transformers, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) performance is excellent, and his career seems to be on the fast track to stardom.

7596086,3,B01A9LM9B2,"Take away the beginning and the end and you have a good solid thriller that's truly enjoyable for both teenagers and adults. Almost everyone agrees with the absurdity of the whole-killer-gone-mad-in-his-secret-dungeon at the end. The scene when Shia's character realises that his mother is going in the killer's house just as he's watching the picture of a corpse in a video shot earlier in that same killer's house, well that scene could've been the start of a great psychological finale. After all, nobody would've cared what shia's character thought anymore. The police wouldn't have come a second time or at least, they would've taken their time. He would've been alone. And you manage something where his video goes kapout! And he doesn't have a proof anymore. His mother is in the house of a killer. Only HE knows it but nobody believes him... Something like that. Instead, they just went crazy with that ridiculous killer-gone-mad thing. very sad.

And the whole intro with the father is COMPLETLY USELESS! A waste of time, a waste of money and we learn nothing that we wouldn't have understand later on, everytime Shia's character goes in his father's office. Plus, it goes against the rythm of the film. I can't believe that Spielberg (who's part of the film's producers) let this happened! You start the film at school and you introduce Shia's sleepy character with the punch in the nose and it's perfect! You start with a Bang! and you understand later why he did it. It's screenplay writing 101!

AND, AND, AND, AND, AND this darn commercial-bad-habbit of finishing a movie with a smile and a joke! What the hell is that? The guy and the girl just went through Hell! They almost died and he saw his mother being almost killed! Still, he finds the strenght to laugh and joke and wink? Like nothing happened? And if he gets the girl at the end, it then means that this whole nightmare was the best thing that's ever happened in their life, no? How can you write such a fun and cool movie and end it like that?

Makes you wonder about the logic of having more than one writer in a movie.

  I will agree that there was a lot of top of the line products shoved in front of your face.  I saw it as a semi typical attempt to say that this is what the average american teenager has available to him for entertainment.  I know for a fact that most do not so it was an attempt for the manufacturers of these products to put them in your face so you too will want to spoil your home bound teenager with.
  This said I feel this is the only negative thing I want to say about the movie.  Now I am 60 years old and I loved it.  I do not care about the products placed in front of me so it was completely lost on me.
  I looked at the movie as a coming of age formate movie, the first love.  The finding out there is mor to a person than the items they have and play with.
  Shia character find his heart throb, his love at first sight.  Then as luck would have it it was a Rear Window take off that I think worked well. In an entertaining way.  If you were to look at this as a reality sort of thing it would be a joke to have all of that happen the way it did.  but this is a movie for entertainment value only.
  I think it worked for that alone.
  Like I said I would not be writing this if were not for the first negative review I read.  I can see the point of some of the comments and if you really want to be critical then yeah OK I agree in away. But a reality check needs to be added.  This is a creation of Hollywood. It is a movie right?  It was not a reality video, so give it a break.  It is for entertainment only it is not a documentary.  There are things that are not perfect.
  If you want to really compare it to Rear Window, thenI am sure there are some that can and will complain about that movie.  I liked it too so I can not and will not.

7596090,2,B01A9LM9B2,"If silliness is your cup of tea, may I heartily recommend DISTURBIA?  The premise is simple enough:  A distraught teen upset over the tragic death of his father (Shia LaBeouf, isn't your 15 minutes about up?) gets a summer-long sentence of house arrest for slugging a snooty teacher (who had it coming, if you ask me).  Confined to his house, and with nothing better to do, he decides to pass the time of day spying on his neighbors--particularly the silent, brooding neighbor next door (David Morse).

Does anyone ever bother to wonder how this teen has more high-tech equipment, cameras, handhelds, and gadgets than the FBI?  Setting that aside, once the LaBeouf character and his pals (Sarah Roemer and Aaron Yoo) push the brooding neighbor too far, this movie dissolves into nonstop nonsense (dungeons, secret rooms, floating body parts, for goodness sake).  The ending is predictable, but not what I would have wanted for DISTURBIA.  The teens were so obnoxious and overbearing I was cheering for the bad guy to catch them.

7596097,4,B01A9LM9B2,"Those looking for the serious slasher pic suggested by the previews, be warned: The most shocking scene in disturbia occurs in the first 10 minutes.

Overall - teen hormones feature more prominently than blood and guts, and voyeurism and the accessibility of technology almost play greater thematic roles than murderous next door neighbors. All of this doesn't mean disturbia is not worth watching. On the contrary, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it, and you may be as well.

Shia will be onscreen almost constantly, so you have to be able to enjoy, or at least have no problems tolerating, his patented brand of befuddled charm. Being thoroughly familiar with the electronic accouterments of a modern teen's lifestyle will also help you 'get' this movie. Sarah Roehmer adds some sizzle as the hot girl who moves in next door and David Morse doesn't have to try too hard to turn in a decent performance as the villain.

Good production, good chemistry and a fun script make disturbia a winner, just don't expect a scarefest. DVD includes making of, outtakes, and a VH1-esque pop-up video setting that quizzes you  on pop-culture references and influences (kind of fun actually).",1224115200,3,1196,4.965
7596098,3,B01A9LM9B2,"D.J. Caruso, like many modern-day film directors, must obviously hold the legendary Alfred Hitchcock in high esteem. You would have to have been sequestered in a cave your entire life or be totally blind to miss all the many creative liberties Mr. Caruso has taken with the Jimmy Stewart classic, ""Rear Window,"" to assume anything less. Having said that, however, I still must say I enjoyed this movie far more than I previously anticipated. Christopher Landon's screenplay, while somewhat predictable, still manages to throw enough surprises at you through its performances.

The aspiring Shia LaBeouf takes front and center stage here as young troublemaker, Kale Brecht. Kale, when he's not spying on his neighbors or causing fire and brimstone to rain down all around him, is actually quite the average and overall likeable kid. With the tragic death of his father serving as the motivation behind his unfortunate scuffle with a high school teacher, Kale has landed himself a three month house arrest. It is during this excruciating stretch that he begins to suspect his next-door neighbor might actually be the same elusive serial killer he's been following on the local news.

That's honestly the main story, right there. I will kindly refrain from spoiling anything further for those who still have yet to see this for themselves.

Now, I may normally not adhere to this type of film. But I was very pleasantly entertained. The clever nods to Hitchcock, as I've already mentioned, along with the collective contributions by La Beouf and David Morse, are what really helped hold my attention. This, plain and simply, is the sort of movie you watch with friends on a Friday night. It's not going to win over the gore hounds or those looking for grindhouse style shocks. This is PG-13 mainstream quality fare, at best. But it's also a motion picture I can freely admit I had fun with.",1222646400,3,1887,4.946372239747634

It is not suspenseful, and certainly not surprising. It is as predictable as you can get, yet I still found myself enjoying it.
Perhaps it's because of the uber talented Shia Labeouf. He is a hugely capable young actor who conforms well to any role he plays. In Disturbia, you really get a sense of who his character is and you can't help but like him. He puts 100% into this film and I think that is why the film works as well as it does.
 I also really wish they used Carrie-Anne Moss more in this film. I really like her as an actress and would have loved to see more of her in this. All in all, a decent popcorn film, but not terribly thriller like or suspenseful. Also, the blooper reel is sadly lacking. It almost seems like a pointless tease.",1222646400,,922,4.238636363636363

On the other side, he spies his enigmatic, new neighbor, which he soons suspects that he's a serial killer.

7596102,5,B01A9LM9B2,"This film is great.  To have a thriller done without gore and with actual suspense, quality acting is rare these days.  At first glance one assumes the film caters to the teen age group but it is a film for everyone.  Adults will enjoy this just as much.

Shia LaBeouf started with independent films and this was his first high profile film.  He is the star and he shines here.  The film rests on his shoulders and how his character deals with all that occurs to him.  He provides a fully drawn out, three dimensional interpretation with a lot on his plate.  We understand how he got to be on house arrest and we care.  His character is real, a true teenager - he is intelligent, sarcastic and loves the ladies.  In other words you must believe in this person for the premise of the movie to make sense and Shia carries this off with flying colors.

Comparisons to Hitchcock make sense but the familiar theme is done in a new and original way.  I must admit that when I first saw the film I really enjoyed it but found the ending a little subpar.  Upon second viewing it all clicked for me and I thoroughly loved it and loved getting caught up in the slowly building suspense and quality acting.

I must reiterate how rare it is to have a suspense film without gore and it works here very succesfully.  The characters carry it and you will be on the edge of your seat.  You will also ask yourself how much should you really want to know about your neighbors.

I am 47 and recommend it for all adults who love quality suspense and Shia LaBeouf is a definite rising star to keep your eye on.",1219795200,2,1589,4.296296296296297

Kale is then put under house arrest with an ankle bracelet to track his movement.  His mother disconnects his iTunes, computer games, and TV, so Kale passes his time by spying on all his neighbors, including the new and very beautiful girl next door, Ashley.

Ashley comes by to make friends with Kale and his best friend Ronnie, and gets into the spying game with them.  Then Kale notices some strange things going on with the neighbor who lives behind Ashley, a odd man who lives alone.  Kale thinks he sees the neighbor brutalizing a woman in his house, and suspects a bag in his garage to contain a body.  He becomes so paranoid he even sends Ronnie over to the house, then fearful for Ronnie he breaks his house arrest (for the second time) to run to Ronnie's aid.

The neighbor, played by the extremely talented David Morse (The Long Kiss Goodnight, The Rock, The Green Mile) is cordial and courteous to the police as they take Kale back home.  Then Kale's mother goes next door to ask that he not press any charges against Kale.  Kale snaps.  Has Kale gone off the deep end from cabin fever, or is what Kale has seen real?

While the movie starts out a bit slow, the tension will slowly build as Kale's paranoia grows.  A typical plotline is saved by Morse's great acting.  One thing I didn't like is the filming of the ending scenes; they were filmed in such darkness that its hard to tell exactly what's going on and who is where in the room.  Not a bad movie, but not the best either.  Rent instead of buy.  Enjoy!",1219363200,,1701,4.4006410256410255
7596104,3,B01A9LM9B2,"As a fan of suspense films, this little movie caught my eye when it was released in theaters April 13, 2007. Disturbia stars Shia LaBeouf as Kale, a teenager who is placed on house arrest after striking a teacher in school. His outlash was the latest on many that occured in the months following his father's death.

After his mother disables his technology (iTunes subscription & X-Box Live), he turns to spying on his neighbors to pass the time. This voyeurism leads to his paranoid thinking that one of his neighbors just might be a notorious serial killer. Stuck with an ankle monitor that alerts police every time he leaves his yard, he's stuck watching his murderous neighbor carry out what might be a series of murders. Throughout the course of the action, he develops a crush on neighbor Ashley (Sarah Roemer) and is helped along the way by his class clown friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo), his link to life outside his house-arrest restrictions.

Disturbia has some good chills and a few scenes will make you jump out of your seat. In the end, it devolves into pretty familiar territory with basic slasher-film style suspense, as Kale tries to take down his neighbor (played by David Morse) and solve the mystery without ever leaving his yard.

At the end of the film I found myself feeling as if I had just watched a longer ""serial killer"" episode of a typical television procedural, such as Criminal Minds or CSI. The first two thirds leave you wanting more and sets you up pretty good before the typical killer-chases-Scooby-Doo-like-gang ending. However, the film does most of this in a pretty stylish way.

Disturbia opened at #1 when it premiered at the box office with $23 million, which quickly covered it's $20 million production price tag. It stayed in the top spot for the next two weeks. Comparisons and inspirations for this film are drawn mostly from Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window, and comparisons have also been struck between the movie posters for both films. The Burbs is also mentioned as an inspiration.

The most memorable aspect of Disturbia may be the casting of rising star Shia LaBeouf, who just months later would star in Michael Bay's Transformers.

7596108,3,B01A9LM9B2,"I normally am not a big fan of movie re-makes. I especially was a little apprehensive about a Hitchcock remake.  After seeing the remake of Psycho a few years ago, I came to the conclusion that because the movies were made so well, and you know the outcome of the movie it's probably better to just leave these movies alone and move on to something more original.

But Disturbia has changed my mind on this.  Disturbia is a modern retelling of Rear Window, and is honestly a good movie.  It gives you just enough of the old Rear Window to keep the connection, but introduces a whole host of new plot twists that keep you guessing.  On the whole It's not as good as rear window, but It would be really difficult for it to be considered in the same area of greatness.

Here's why I liked it:
  1. The Actors are GREAT!  Shia LaBeouf is great!!! This kid seems to be catching a lot of breaks in some very popular movies lately, but he's only getting those roles, because he is such a good actor, and this movie is a great example of that.  Also Carrie-Ann Moss was good in the movie as well.  Close to the end I couldn't help but think while she was being attacked by David Morse, ""Hey, this is Trinity, and she should be kicking your butt(the matrix)""

  2.  The movie is very suspenseful for pg-13 and I found David Morse very mysterious and spooky.

In short this movie is a great Teen suspense movie, that is done so well not just teens will enjoy liking it.",1214438400,,1459,4.289377289377289

The feeling of suspense and urgency was almost too much at times (in a good way!) as a teenager under house arrest begins to suspect that his neighbor is a serial killer.
He proceeds to investigate in ways that make you yell at the television, shamelessy spying on his neighbor with binoculars and the use of his friends.
I loved the tense moments throughout, and I also like the fact that I found myself unsure of what the real story was.
Is his neighbor a serial killer?  Definitely.  Wait....maybe not.  Wait...I think he is....

It was a dark comedy almost, to the point of it being juvenile, filled with adolescent angst and cakewalks through suburbia. I found the suspense sophmoric and the teenagers roles mundane and unremarkable. The accolades that people give Shia are unwarranted. How people can see this kid has an amazing career based upon his role in Disturbia is bordering on the ludicrous.

I understand being influenced or inspired by another movie or director, but come on. It's so similar that Disturbia should have been called The Darklings and touted as a remake.

7596112,4,B01A9LM9B2,"This movie started working right from the beginning. The most emotionally intense moments occurred during the opening sequence, but it was still a very engaging film. A nice balance of humor, drama and thrills.

The mystery builds nicely as the main character, Kale (Shia LaBeouf), passes his time during house arrest by spying on the neighbors. He develops a love interest with an attractive girl next door (Sarah Roemer), and connects his other neighbor, Mr. Turner (David Morse), with a running news story about a serial killer from Texas. The girl and Kale's friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) join him in investigating the mystery, putting the clues together, and staking out the mysterious neighbor.

They go as far as to monitor his stop at a department store while Ron breaks into the Turner's car to retrieve the code on the garage door opener so they can later gain access to the house and check the contents of a bag, which Kale suspects contains the remains of one of Turner's victims.

The suspense escalates as we learn the sinister truth behind Mr. Turner's activities. Kale inadvertently breaks the boundaries of the tracking device strapped to his leg, and as a result the cops just consider him a trouble maker, with too much time on his hands. It's almost too late when they realize that he is telling the truth about his neighbor's hidden evil.

In all a great film, decent acting and comic relief, especially from the quirky, energetic Ron. His endearing antics and personality make the film that much more entertaining. Veteran actor David Morse serves up a creepy yet subdued and charming performance which belies the darkness at the heart of his character.

Shia LaBeouf brings a likeable John Cusack style to his character, and Sarah Roemer is incredibly alluring. The only thing that seemed flat about this film was the presence of Kale's mother. Her character isn't established enoughfor us  to be too concerned for her. Personally I was more concerned with the well being of Ron, Kale and the girl. The film works, but I felt the mother was the weakest character. See for yourself.

In all a great modern thriller, very well done. Production is tops, featuring dramatic lighting, excellent camera work and great direction. A well told tale.",1211673600,3,2259,4.897905759162303

7596116,3,B01A9LM9B2,"Shia LaBeouf is the new `it-boy' in Hollywood I presume.  First we have `Disturbia', the `Transformers' and soon the new `Indy' flick.  In `Disturbia' he takes on the teen-horror flick and does so well enough.  `Disturbia' is not brilliant, and it is nothing new, but thanks to some well placed intensity it does serve it's purpose in getting under our skin.

Kale Brecht is a tad bit troubled after losing his father to a devastating car accident.  His bottled rage leads him to slugging out his Spanish teacher and lands him under house-arrest.  With a lot of spare time on his hands Kale finds himself spying on the neighbors.  There's the little boys across the street that watch adult movies while their mother isn't around.  There's the hot young thing across the street named Ashley.  And then there's the creepy next door neighbor, Robert Turner (not to be mistaken for Robbie Turner, the doomed hero from `Atonement'), who may or may not be a crazed serial killer from Texas.

Following the formula of obvious inspiration `Rear Window' yet incorporating a whole vast array of new age gadgets and tricks, `Disturbia' manages to become its own little movie instead of a tired copycat.

Shia LeBeouf is believable here as the hero.  His teenage curiosity and immature approach is realistic and engaging.  Sarah Roemer is so-so at best as his love interest Ashley.  She's pretty, I'll give her that, but she's not too impressive on the acting side of it all.  Aaron Yoo, the sidekick best friend, is funny and entertaining.  The real star though is David Morse who is just brilliantly on point as the creepy next door neighbor.  He's always a brilliant villain and here he doesn't disappoint.  I really wish he would get some high profile gigs.  Carrie-Anne Moss is a little lost here (the script has no use for her until the very end) but that doesn't mean she doesn't try.

In the end `Disturbia' comes off a little `Rear Window', a little `Domestic Disturbance', maybe even a little `The Cell' (it's all in the ending) but it's all its own movie.

7596118,4,B01A9LM9B2,"Shia LeBeouf is outstanding in this movie. Besides being an eye-catcher to the ladies, he actually shows good emotion throughout, the key scene being the car crash.

He's on house arrest for punching out a totally disrespectful teacher who stepped out of line. Instead of doing anything productive, he plays army games online with the headset and all, mimicking one of the many interests of my eldest brother, eating so unhealthily and trying oh so hard to stay out of trouble while unable to do anything at all.

The neighborhood he happens to live in is anything but boring. There's a cheating spouse over yonder, a hot new neighborhood girl next door (Ashley) and a possible killer across the street who mows his lawn all too often.

It's a suspenseful thriller at heart but you really wouldn't know that unless you looked at your guide or heard about it previously to watching the film. The actual action slowly, slowly comes about. But it's all worth it in the end.

Without destroying the major highlights of this movie I will say that this movie takes many turns; some that you will predict easily and some that will leave you speechless. There were only a few moments where I wasn't that interested in the movie and I still don't understand the ""low"" rating here.

In fact, I liked the movie so much, especially by the ending that I will refuse to look at a lot of negative reviews here. I usually look at both, tend to check out the 3's and 2's first but won't do so for this one.

It is what it is and I found that interesting. The characters were well-rounded, the questions I had throughout the movie were answered (minus maybe one) and the acting was more than decent.

Worth your time and recommended.

4.3 stars.

End note: Ashley playing hard to get was one of the most awesome personal parts in the movie. What Shia admits to her on the roof when she holds his Ipod was the true highlight in this aspect as well as one of the highlights of the movie period.

The alternative music that Shia jammed to in this film was pretty good. I didn't actually know any of the artists because I tend to listen to poppier rock but one of the bands sounded like something my cousin would listen to.

7596119,4,B01A9LM9B2,"Many years ago, Alfred Hitchcock showed viewers what could happen when we spy on the wrong neighbor and find out some business we weren't supposed too. Now, decades later, director D.J. Caruso thinks we all need a refresher course in this fun, stylish, and entertaining little thriller. While this movie may not be wildly original, I saw it the same day as ""The Hitcher"" re-make, so it seemed like a breath of fresh air!.

17 year old Kale(Shia LaBeauf)suffers a horrible tragedy early in the film. A year later, things are obviously different for him. He gets in trouble for punching a teacher at school, and is sentenced to 3 months house arrest(complete with an ankle monitor that would make Martha Stewart jealous). Basically trapped with only so far he can go from his lawn before it goes off, Kale ends up spending his time spying on his neighbors. A hot new girl named Ashley(Sarah Roemer)moves in next door and, while romance blossoms, something else pops up. A neighbor named Mr. Turner(the great David Morse), may or may not be a serial killer. And Kale and his friends may or may not be next.

The movie is pretty well set up, and the idea of the leg monitor and having restricted access to the outside world was a fun idea that is used to it's worth. It creates some fun moments, and some genuinely suspenseful ones as well. These moments of the film are pretty effective and well planned. We've all pretty much seen it before, but director Caruso and his talented cast make it a lot of fun, with characters and situations we actually like. It's all very slick and entertaining.

I am not one that has yet jumped on the Shia bandwagon, but it is clear that the guy has talent and is going somewhere. His Kale comes across as a genuine kid who has been through something. His buddy is the comical relief, and Sarah Roemer as Ashley is a beauty. Carrie Ann-Moss has the typical role as Kale's mother. But it was David Morse who made the movie to me. His face looks like it has a history. One minute he seems very quiet, shy, and like he couldn't hurt a fly. The next second you are unsure. Could this guy kill someone?. He gave the best performance of the movie for me.

""Disturbia"" isn't treading new ground, but it delivered a pretty fun, well made, entertaining thrill ride that I enjoyed quite a lot from beginning to end. The performances were acceptable(some more than others), and the direction slick and polished. An updated, modern day version of ""Rear Window"" that should be given a look.

Good in that, his new neighbor turns out to be an attractive female around his age, and he develops a relationship with her as the story goes along.  Bad in that, you guessed it, one of the neighbors is a killer.

Throughout the movie you're left guessing whether this supposed killer is actually doing any killing, or whether the teenager is just imagining all the things he believes he sees.

When his Mom Julie initiates a disciplinary programme of no X-Box, no iTunes and no TV, Kale takes to spying on his neighbours for amusement. Enter new neighbour family the Carlsons and their pretty daughter Ashley, who, drawn to Kale, begins to investigate the possibly murderous goings-on of neighbour Robert Turner.

Shia LaBeouf and David Morse give great performances as Kale and Robert respectively: LeBeouf in particular is one of the better young actors working in mainstream movies today. Morse's is-he-or-isn't-he-crazy neighbour is most effective, and the pair create believable, watchable characters. The rest of the cast is reduced either to mere cameos (Carrie-Anne Moss, Viola Davis), or becomes another forgettable teen face in a forgettable teen movie (Sarah Roemer, Aaron Yoo).

The script is very very bland.

Directed with great style by mostly-TV's D.J. Caruso, ""Disturbia"" starts off well, with fluid storytelling and a nice tension to the opening scenes. It's got some nice sequences in the middle, too, when Kale, Ashley and Kale's buddy Ronnie are spying on Turner. And the ending is well-made with some pretty believable tension.

Sadly, the rest of this 105 minute movie is mere filler for comparatively few scenes of interest, and it's difficult to force one's eyes open while Angry McTeenager is trying to seduce Generic Sunkissed Girl, or larking about with his very own Ronald Weasley-style sidekick. ""Disturbia"" is billed as a teenage ""Rear Window"": teenagers would be better off with the original. This movie, well-directed as it is, is massively boring when the action cools down: sadly, this accounts for most of the scenes in ""Disturbia"".

But how can he prove it when his mother wouldn't listen and the police are unsympathetic? He can trust only his best friend Ronnie and a new girl (and love interest) Ashley.

You will find the basic situation of ""Disturbia"" is too similar to that of ""Rear Window,"" in which James Stewart's hero is trapped in his room because of his broken leg, but that doesn't mean that ""Disturbia"" is a worthless clone of Hitchcock's masterpiece. Well, you may call it a rip-off, but ""Disturbia"" succeeds as thriller (not completely though) and it also has some really funny moments. The main characters, three teenagers in particular, are memorable, thanks to the fine acting from the stars Shia LaBeouf, Sarah Roemer and Aaron Yoo. If you say Shia LaBeouf is on his way to be a big star, yes, I think so too. The film is also shot with stylish camera, but not in the showy way.

Sadly, like Director D. J. Caruso's previous films, ""Disturbia"" loses its narrative power in the final chapter where things happen in a more conventional way. Another disappointment for me is Carrie-Anne Moss, whose character as Kale's mother becomes a cipher in the film's second half. And at some point some characters behave in a too incredible way - David Morse's character, I think, talks too much - but maybe you find it differently. Please see it for yourself.

7596130,4,B01A9LM9B2,"Disturbia is one of those rare suspense movies that I actually enjoyed. I am not one who typically likes Teenager movies, although this year has been the exception. First the Invisible, and now this one.

In essence, it's a remake of an old classic Alfred Hitchcock movie, called the Rear Window.

Both movies have several themes in common - someone essentially trapped inside their home due to circumstances, and out of boredom they begin to spy on their neighbours.

Growing up is difficult for everyone. I remember how tough my teenage years were. You've got pressure from your family to do well in school (that is, if you have a family that cares), you have to deal with peer pressure, bullies, and of course the worst part of growing up - raging hormones.

To make things even worse, throw a tragic loss into the mix and it is nothing more than a recipe for disaster.

That's what happened to the Kale Brecht (portrayed by Shia LaBeouf). In high school when he loses his father right before his eyes in a tragic car accident, he ends up retreating into himself.

His marks in school suffer and after his Spanish Teacher ends up making a comment about his father, he loses his temper and hits the teacher.

That ends up leading to him being charged for assault and placed under 3 months house arrest.

Now, as a parent of a teenager myself, I know how tough things are. The hormones are especially difficult to deal with, and they turn even your best child into a rebellious monster.

Well, not monster, but you get the picture.

I know that when my kid disobeys, I punish him by taking away his privileges. And that's exactly what happened to Kale. His mother (portrayed by Carrie-Anne Moss) cuts off his I-tunes and Xbox live.

And to make a point, she even cut the power cord to his television. Thus increasing the tension between the two of them.

So, boredom sets in and he begins to spy on the neighbours in order to keep himself from going crazy. In a few short weeks he discovers how interesting his neighbours are - trouble makers, obsessive compulsives, even infidelity!

Now, the movie is quite entertaining, with several scenes of laugh out loud humour, and even a little bit of sensuality when new neighbours move in and Kale notices the beautiful and very well built daughter. She does spend a lot of time lounging in the pool, after all.

The suspense begins to build after Kale listens to reports about missing girls and suspects it's because of his one neighbour, after realizing that the car he drives matches the description of the vehicle last seen with one of the victims.

With the help of his best friend Ron and the lovely girl from next door, he ends up setting of a chain of events that culminates in one very intense confrontation.

Oh, and his friend Ron pulls off one hell of a practical joke - something that I'd love to do myself!

So, as a teenage flick goes, I enjoyed it and found it to be worth seeing.

I also took the time to watch several of the bonus features that were included on the disk. It had your typical deleted scenes, of which none really helped progress the plot, so I can see why they ended up on the cutting room floor.

I did enjoy the outtakes, the second one in particular. I was disappointed though that the Serial Pursuit trivia pop up game didn't work on my disk. It kept brining me back to the main menu.

The music video for the song `Don't make me wait' by This World Fair was ok.

Speaking of music, I didn't really care for the soundtrack. Hey, I'm more of a heavy rocker than pop, and the music didn't really catch my interest. But as I've stated many times in the past - this is strictly my opinion, and no one else's.

The DVD is worth checking out.

Honestly, that was the only expectation I wanted fulfilled.  Not that I think this kid's a bad actor or anything, but his character, Kale, is exactly like Spike from Transformers: a rude, disgusting, horny prick who frankly deserved to be knifed by the end of this flick.

I find it amazing that we're supposed to believe Kale's been constantly suffering after a tragedy early on in the movie, but by the very end, it's like nothing's happened to him at all!  This movie is filled will holes and scenes that ultimately add nothing to the plot.  My biggest gripe: Haven't ANY of these characters heard of 9-1-1?  Everyone has a cell phone that practically lives on them like a symbiotic parasite, but suddenly nobody can call the police.  Gimmee a break.  And I have a hard time believing the tech-savvy Kale in the film wouldn't have had the entire incriminating video of the killer on YouTube by the time the badguy made it to his front door.  I try to check believability at the door, but Disturbia pushed and pushed until it broke at the scene where the girl very obviously follows the killer and we're actually supposed to believe he doesn't see her snapping photos of him at the hardware store.  (As if a killer like that wouldn't already own a shovel.  Why would he need to buy one right after the murder?  Ridiculous.)

It's got everything in it, a bit of comedy, drama, a little love thing goin' on, and then of course the suspense of the unknown, and the ending is great. Awesome flick!

7596134,3,B01A9LM9B2,"'Disturbia' was an interesting, if somewhat mediocre horror/suspense film that follows the 17 year old Kale (LaBeouf) and his unusual experiences in his upper middle-class suburb. The film starts with a beautiful scene of father and son fishing in the mountains (presumably out west somewhere). This appears to set the stage for the portrayal of the idyllic American existence, only to be shattered by tragedy minutes into the film. The troubled young Kale reacts to this tragedy by acting out and manages to get himself put under house arrest, which leaves him with plenty of time, and little to do. One of his hobbies is spying on his neighbors, and in between the adulterer across the street, and the new hot girl next door, Kale begins to suspect that his neighbor is a wanted serial killer. Is he right, or is his imagination getting the best of him?

I'm not sure if the film's intent was to portray suburbia in general as some dark, morally corrupt place, just beneath the veneer of middle-class respectability, but I can see how one could make that inference. Or maybe it's just an isolated, Hitchcockian story about a serial killer and I'm looking way too deeply into it. Either way, the film was moderately entertaining, even though it was a bit slow going at times and didn't really do anything original.

This was my first time watching this kid LaBeouf, and I think he was pretty good. His portrayal of a generally good-hearted, but troubled teenager was very believable and his personality actually reminded me a bit of myself at that age. In fact, the film brought up some bittersweet feelings about my own upbringing in suburbia. Overall, I would say that although 'Disturbia' is nothing particularly memorable, it serves it's purpose as an entertaining and suspenseful thriller. 3.5 stars.",1196467200,2,1806,4.898692810457517

7596137,2,B01A9LM9B2,This may be appealing to teenagers...MAYBE. The story line was weak and typical....run of the mill. I did not find it to be suspenseful...mildly entertaining.,1195171200,2,158,5.36
7596138,4,B01A9LM9B2,"For the longest time I avoided Disturbia; it seemed nothing more than a knockoff of the Alfred Hitchcock classic Rear Window. I figured it would nothing more than a lame knockoff aimed at an audience that probably have never seen Rear Window and possibly never even heard of it. But I started hearing some decent reviews and I finally gave in.

But I have to say Disturbia was the surprise movie of the year for me. I must say I quite enjoyed it. It never reaches the greatness of the movie it was inspired by, but Disturbia makes for a fun thrill ride and is one of the best thrillers to come out of Hollywood for quite sometime.

The screenplay by Christopher Landon & Carl Ellsworth was actually very well written. The characters actually have depth. They weren't the typical cardboard cut out characters most of these movies seem to have. The characters are likeable and have depth. The screenplay isn't ground-breaking nor does it put any kinda twist, but the script works quite well overall.

Director D.J. Caruso does a bang up job; I personally very much disliked Taking Lives, which was directed by Caruso, but I'm a big fan of The Shield, which he has directed quite a few episodes of. In TV it's more about the writing than the directing. But even with that said I was still curious to see how Caruso would fair and he really does an excellent job. The pacing is overall very good, while there might be a slow moment or two Caruso is able to keep things moving at a good pace and never lets the pace lag.

The plot does start off slow; while there are little hints of things to come it's not until about the 40-minute mark when things start to pick up and once the hour mark hits Disturbia takes off. In many ways, the possible murderer plot is sort of the subplot, which I found quite interesting. Most of the movie really deals with Kale played by Shia LaBeouf and how he deals with being under house arrest.

All the actors are pretty good as well; none of the performances are Iconic or anything, but all the actors do a solid job and are quite believable. David Morse was the stand-out though; he plays the role to near perfection. He's a very good and much underrated actor.

Disturbia is predictable there is nothing here we haven't seen before. It follows the basic format of this genre, but it still makes for a fun time. Unless you haven't seen many movies you should be able to tell how the movie will play out from beginning to end, but if the movie is well written and well made it's easy to look past that and Disturbia is well written and well made and again makes for a really fun time. Disturbia will obviously play best with the teen crowd, but it's still a movie anyone can really enjoy.

In closing, what Disturbia lacks in originality it makes up for in the shear fun of it. A lot of PG-13 movies are very much toned down and treat the viewers like idiots and a lot of R-Rated flicks rely on shock value. So it's good to see a movie like Disturbia that isn't toned down and doesn't treat the viewer like an idiot, but relies on story-telling and suspense.",1194825600,2,3087,4.405263157894737

7596142,4,B01A9LM9B2,"Shia LaBeouf, whom I have loved watching on screen since Holes, plays Kale who has recently lost his father in a car accident.  After one of his teachers makes a stinging remark regarding his father, Kale punches him and ends up spending the summer in house arrest.  He becomes bored and decides to start spying on his neighbors.

One of his neighbors appears to fit the description of a serial killer they are tracking on the news.  As Kale keeps on eye on him, Kale grows more and more convinced that the neighbor is the man that everybody is looking for.

There are two good things I can say about this movie.  The first is the acting skills of Shia LaBeouf who just shines in any scene he is in.  He is convincing and passionate throughout this entire movie and further proves what a first class actor he is.  The acting by the others are pretty good, but the other teenagers can be a little over-the-top at times.

The other thing is the last twenty minutes of the film as everything comes to its climax.  Wow!! I was literally on the edge of my seat the entire time.  It is well worth sitting through the first hour of this movie in order to get there.

Which leads me to the negative aspect of this movie, which is the first hour and change of this movie.  It is boring!  Worst, it is predictable.  Nothing great happens that catches you off guard and they spent waaaaay too much time focusing on Kale's love interest Ashley, played by Sarah Roemer.

But then, again, the ending makes it worth it.",1193788800,,1504,4.394927536231884
7596143,3,B01A9LM9B2,"Don't be put off by the 50's B-flick title of this film. This is actually a fairly good thriller involving teenagers whom both young people and adults can care about.

The two lead teens show themselves to be capable of a romance that's much more interesting than the simple grope-in-the-back-seat-of-a-car you usually get whenever any high-schooler is featured. These two actually talk to each other, and, (dare I use the word?) - ""share"" meaningful parts of their histories. Then when the newfound girlfriend makes common cause with Shia LeBoeuf as he begins to suspect his neighbor of being a serial killer - she does it, not just as an adjunct girl out to ""get"" a guy - but as someone with a truly independent curiosity. As a result, we viewers are in turn sincerely moved to make common cause with these teens, and peer with them through the binoculars at the ominous goings-on across the street.

This movie takes its time in general, which also contributes to making it a stand-out from other teen movies. Its emphasis on character development is evident from the start. ""Disturbia"" opens with a daringly lengthy scene in a high-school Spanish class. I'm glad the Director didn't buckle under all the pressures now put on moviemakers to ""pick up the pace,"" because this scene is important. It not only shows how the lead character comes to be placed under house arrest - a necessary condition for his growing awareness of his neighbors. But the schoolroom scene also sets the tone of the movie in a subtler way. It shows the sadism of the teacher, coming out like a cat's claw from its padding. So we see how someone who is generally esteemed in the community - actually enjoys exercising a warped control behind closed classroom doors where he's been granted dominance. And so it turns out to be with Shia's neighbor.

There are some problems with logic in this movie. Would a teenager in fact be kept out of school and put under extended house arrest for punching out a teacher?

The biggest breech of logic here though involves the serial killer himself. It seems very unlikely that anyone would continue giving vent to his homicidal impulses so blatantly, so near his windows, even after he knows he is being watched. This puts the villain improbably over the top.

Then there are some loose ends left dangling. For example, exactly what becomes of Shia's  pal, a role played with appealing verve by Aaron Yoo.

There are a lot of bonus extras on this DVD, including an interactive pop-up. The trivia squibs activated by this option don't add much to the film. They tend to be altogether too trivial. And the Director's commentary is a little loose, with D. J. Caruso taking some phone calls in the middle of his narrative, thereby allowing a further trivializing annoyance.

However these flaws weren't enough to spoil my appreciation of what is an essentially pretty good movie. Then seeing another movie with an obliquely similar theme at around the same time coincidentally enhanced my appreciation of both movies even more. If you want to see another film on the subject of surveillance, I recommend ""The Lives of Others."" This latter is a German film about surveillance in a police state. Coupled with ""Disturbia"" which shows surveillance starting out as a giddy teenage entertainment, you get a strangely stereoscopic effect on the theme of watching others from a distance.",1193616000,,3391,4.844559585492228

This story had potential!

In the classic sense of a hitchcock thrillers, this movie would have done so much better if they didn't try and fit as many branded products into the movie so that the studio wouldnt have to put a dime in. A real shame since so many great movies now give up a lot for the sake of product placement in the movie.

What product placement you say? How about our hero lebouf in question is sitting at home eating smuckers and twinkies while playing his xbox 360 and swilling cans of red bull while he stocks his ipod with ""60 gb of his life"" while filming his neighbour serenade his mum with a panasonic camera in his mustang which was dented but suddenly its not when all the while he cant help but perv on his neighbour who drives her father's BMW X5 chatting to her friends on her nokia while his strange but quirky asian friend (note: they had to have an asian kid in it! how else will you represent a minority in a movie full of gadgets? Blacks and Mexicans, it seems, wouldnt fit) with HIS nokia phone multi tasking and his cRaZy hair do playing his PSP drinking red bull too eating dominos who winds up breaking into a lexus and walking around with a little slugger baseball bat to help save the day while helping to spy on his friends neighbour with some cool branded binoculars.

I mean this is how much the movie sold itself out: the final line of the movie is our hero lebouf and his love interest, making out while his friend is filming them who then turns around and says ""This is so going on youtube""... and they just continue as if he's not there?!

WOW. What a meaningful and appropriate line for this two hour advertisment! What a creepy way to end it too, as if the movie director didn't see the point in showing that despite vouyerism got everyone into this whole mess, ""its still ok to do so cause we have to work on theme a bit LOL"".

What a waste of time, and there I was thinking how awesome would it be if Labeouf made this whole story up in his head, became the actual stalker and wound up killing his neighbour, the girl he likes and then bricks on his friends chest while they serenade each other over how stupid they thought the audience and Labeoufs neighbours were. Thats about all that would have excused this movie from being one big advert and would have had a standing applause from me.

Ignore this movie, go spend your money on something like an original hitchcock movie, there are no product endorsements and there is actually focus on the acting!",1192924800,4,2729,4.3392156862745095

7596147,3,B01A9LM9B2,"One thing is sure.  ""Disturbia"" now joins ""Wrestling With Ernest Hemingway,"" ""The Saint of Fort Washington,"" and ""The Twonky"" as one of the worst titles ever.  Concocting a new word is an obvious attempt to create an aura of mystery over what is at heart a by-the-book melodrama.  Fortunately, the film itself is better than its dimwitted title suggests.
 ""Disturbia"" is best described as a thriller, though the thriller part doesn't kick in until about halfway through the film.  The best thrillers have always been popular with audiences because they combine an intriguing story and charismatic characters with suspense, the ingredient that holds them together.  ""Disturbia"" follows that pattern.
 Kale (Shia LaBeouf) has been put under house arrest because he attacked his Spanish teacher.  The court orders that he remain confined to his house for three months.  A bracelet attached to his ankle monitors his movements in and immediately outside his home.  If he goes beyond a certain point, the police will be notified and they will come a-running.
 Initially, Kale vegetates, playing video games on his X-Box, watching TV, turning his room into a personal disaster area, eating globs of peanut butter drenched with chocolate syrup, and longing for contact with his friends.  Kale's mom (Carrie-Anne Moss) -- disgusted by the way Kale views his court-ordered incarceration as a romp -- cuts off his electronic entertainment, insisting that the vacation is over.
 With nothing else to do, Kale takes to watching his neighbors.  There's Mr. Turner (David Morse), whose habits are routinized and predictable; new move-in neighbors Ashley (Sarah Roemer) and her family; and a pack of unruly, irksome kids who delight in tormenting Kale.
 Once director D. J. Caruso establishes the characters and sets the plot in motion, he switches gears when Kale believes he's seen Mr. Turner engage in very suspicious behavior.  Kale involves best friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) and Ashley in his suspicions, placing all three of them in danger.
 ""Disturbia"" owes much to Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window.""  In that film, Jimmy Stewart -- immobilized by a broken leg -- passes the time by spying on his neighbors when he believes he's seen evidence that a man across the courtyard has murdered his wife.
 ""Disturbia"" scales down the characters to teenagers to attract a young audience, and that's fine.  And though Mr. LaBeouf is no Jimmy Stewart, he is a likable actor whose naturalness suggests a sort of Everyman teen.  Imperfect, troubled, shackled  -- both physically and parentally -- he must act against considerable odds to reveal the truth about a mild-mannered neighbor.
 La Beouf is effective as Kale, making ""Disturbia"" an enjoyable viewing experience.  His acting is natural, his mannerisms appropriate and thought-out. He projects arrogance, anger, nervousness, embarrassment or fear, as required, and does so believably.  Since he is not yet overly familiar to movie audiences, he registers as a real kid who gets himself into a situation that spins out of control.
 Morse continues his career as a sinister, threatening, dangerous individual as Mr. Turner.  Soft-spoken, with kind eyes, his menace is conveyed not through overtly but by deliberate, psychological terror.
 What disappointed me most about ""Disturbia"" is its very predictable third act, which follows the path of so many thrillers before it.  There is little cleverness in its staging to match the film's thoughtful build-up.  It looks as if everyone -- especially writer and director -- coasted downhill for the movie's final scenes.  In fact, the viewer knows exactly what will happen just by the sequence of thriller movie clich&eacute;s.  The payoff hardly matches the set-up.
 Though ""Disturbia"" is far from a failure, its interesting house arrest plot point, its presentation of characters, and its overall fine acting leave the viewer annoyed that the film's lame climax is not worthy of the rest of the film's quality.",1192665600,,3988,5.22992125984252
7596148,4,B01A9LM9B2,"I am not normally into this kind of movie, but I bought it as a gift for a friend who loves Alfred Hitchcock and all sorts of horror/suspense movies. He said that it is the closest thing to an Alfred Hitchcock movie he has seen in a long time. Very creative and suspenseful!",1192665600,,274,4.188679245283019
7596149,5,B01A9LM9B2,"I knew that Disturbia was loosely based on Rear Window, which is essentially a murder mystery from the perspective of a peeping tom.  The protagonist is confined to a house and thus can only interpret his surroundings through sight and sound at a distance; he eventually comes to suspect that his neighbor is a murderer.

That's about all there is in common between the two films.  Disturbia has to do some fancy footwork to get the concept to work today.  With kids having more freedom and more information access than ever before, isolating a character is a challenge.  This is true of most horror these days--ubiquitous cell phones mean it's more difficult to create the sense of isolation so critical to horror.

But Disturbia pulls it off.  Kale (Shia LaBeouf) and his father Daniel's (Matt Craven) fishing trip is cut brutally short by a car accident that kills Kale's dad.  Kale is emotionally isolated from his peers at school, who can't possibly understand what he's been through.

Flash forward a year later and Kale, who seemed bright and cheerful, is now an introverted, angry young man.  When a high school teacher pushes his buttons, Kale responds with violence. That violence puts Kale under house arrest, physically isolating him. Thanks to his ankle bracelet, Kale can't run more than a few hundred feet without the police being alerted.

Kale's mother, Julie (the delectable Carrie-Anne Moss), wants to ensure that this house arrest is punishment.  After all, how many kids would be perfectly happy sitting indoors, playing Xbox, listening to their iPod, and watching television all day?  Julie revokes all entertainment privileges, leaving Kale with nothing to do but stare out the window.

This is all happening during summer vacation, so Kale's now socially isolated too, with only his friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) as company.  That means no parties and no dating.  Never mind that his hot neighbor, Ashley (Sarah Roemer) leaves her blinds open and is fond of taking swims in skimpy bathing suits.  Or that she likes to host parties for the cool kids.  Kale couldn't attend if he wanted to.

Kale's isolation is complete and now on par with L.B. Jeffries from Rear Window, who was physically disabled and a photographer to boot.

Disturbia cleverly turns the first part of the film into a teen drama.  Kale has a crush on Ashley, who eventually discovers that he's spying on her and boldly comes over to visit.  She too is isolated, having just moved into town--surely every teenage boy's dream of having the first shot at a hot girl!

Once the Scooby gang of Kale, Ashley, and Ronnie is established, the plot really starts rolling.  Robert Turner (David Morse, looking more dangerous and creepy than ever) also moved in next store.  When the murders of a serial killer with a fondness for redheads are broadcast on the evening news, Kale starts to wonder about his neighbor's late night activities.

What ensues is an exercise in YouTube-culture.  Kale sets about spying on his neighbor with zeal.  Ashley and Ronnie get in on the act, following Robert around and even breaking into his car and house.  Disturbia asks us: when is it okay to violate someone else's privacy?  And doesn't the right to privacy mean that very bad people get to do horrible things in private?

Like any good thriller, Disturbia relies heavily on its actors.  LaBeouf carries the film, alternately sarcastic, voyeuristic, pathetic, bored, romantic, and angry -- just like so many teenage boys.  Morse turns his sad, lonely demeanor into a creepy vibe that makes you feel dirty just listening to him.

Older thrillers had the luxury of time.  With shorter attention spans and less tolerance for reality-straining conventions, once the tipping point is reached, Disturbia turns into an all out slasher-fest.  And that's oddly appropriate, even cathartic, for thrillers of the millennial generation.  Once the truth is on video, it spreads like wildfire.

There's a moment in the film where Robert calmly explains how he likes his privacy and why it's so important to him.  And that's the moment where the generation gap is drawn in Disturbia: Robert, the silver-haired Boomer, disturbs the younger generation with his need for privacy.  Kale, the Generation Y millennial, doesn't comprehend the notion at all. Disturbia is as much a thriller as it is a commentary on a culture clash between two different generations, forced to figure out how to coexist in modern suburbia.",1192579200,,4467,4.9757085020242915
7596150,5,B01A9LM9B2,"Though I'll always be partial to the Alfred Hitchcock version, this is a good modern day re-make.  I love the way the story develops sympathy for the kid early on.  He's not just a trouble maker with a perversion, a series of events beyond his control leads him to his house arrest, and the boredom that leaves him nothing to do but spy on his neighbors. Very good action, and I loved the humorous sidekick...

7596152,3,B01A9LM9B2,"Disturbia begins with a sequence of pure exposition built on the classic father/son bonding experience of fly fishing.  The set-up seems a little overdone with the coming-of-age Kale Brecht receiving fatherly wisdom in the serenity of a mountain stream.

The moment, predictably, is not to last, and after a bad accident we flash forward one year to find that Kale Brecht is a lousy student with emotional problems, who earns himself a summer of house arrest after lashing out at one of his teachers.

When Kale's unsympathetic Mom (played by Carrie-Anne Moss) orders him to clean his room (after killing his TV and shutting down his iTunes and Xbox 360), Kale becomes desperate for external stimuli, and begins his metamorphosis into a teenage voyeur.  He points cameras and binoculars all over the neighborhood, and soon knows quite a bit more than he probably should about his neighbors.

His spying quickly leads him to the discovery of a gorgeous girl next door named Ashley, who spends a lot of time swimming and lounging about in skimpy outfits, much to the delight of Kale.  As a bonus, she isn't at all creeped out by Kale apparently spying on her, or the fact that he has obviously had a bit of a run-in with the law.

Ashley and Kale become friends, and joined by Kale's horny tagalong Ronnie, the trio soon begins to suspect their neighbor Robert Turner (played by the always-creepy David Morse) in connection with a crime that's reported on the local TV news.  Turner's car matches an eyewitness description, and Kale sees him dragging a suspicious package into his garage.

A cat-and-mouse game transpires with the characters trying to discover information about the alleged killer, while the movie clumsily reminds us of Kale's limiting predicament.

The movie is obviously inspired to a large degree by Rear Window, and its imitation is unapologetic at times.  However, where Hitchcock's classic made the characters resolve the situation within the strong confines of the film's initial premise, Disturbia eventually abandons it in favor of an awkward search-and-rescue mission involving Kale and his mother that feels tacked on and out-of-place.

Despite the movie's primary flaws (It's too predictable, it lacks any real chills or scares, and the romantic relationship between Kale and Ashley is wholly unconvincing), Disturbia still does a decent job of keeping the film from becoming too much of a Rear Window rip-off, all the while updating it for today's younger viewer.

For those who haven't seen Rear Window, this movie may even come across as better than it actually is.  For those who've seen and admired the Hitchcock classic, however, it is barely any more than a pale imitation.",1192060800,,2708,5.029082774049217
7596153,4,B01A9LM9B2,"One year after the death of his father, Kale Brecht (Shia LaBoeuf) is placed under a 3 month house arrest after striking his school teacher. Languishing at home, Kale begins to go stir crazy. Falling prey to the ""natural side effects of chronic boredom,"" he constructs an edifice of Twinkies, converts his room into a kingdom of trash, and resorts to the always fun yet seedy diversion of spying on his neighbors. This latter activity reaches its most rewarding pinnacle when rebellious superbabe Ashley (Sarah Roemer) moves in next door. Before long, however, things take a turn for the sinister as Kale begins to suspect that his other neighbor, the quiet Mr. Turner (David Morse), just might be a kidnapper and a serial killer.

Shia LaBeouf, star of this picture, is on some kind of a hot streak and is probably the busiest young actor around these days. I thought he was good in THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED and provided the humanizing element in TRANSFORMERS. But, in between those two films, he also starred in DISTURBIA, a well-made teenage Peeping Tom thriller which gradually unfolds its mystery even as it heightens the tension.

Not to say that this film belongs in the same rarified air inhabited by classic Hitchcock films, but DISTURBIA does pilfer from the master in two senses. One, of course, is the premise it borrows directly from REAR WINDOW. The other is the construction of the film's narrative. What did Hitchcock say? ""There is no terror in a bang; only in the anticipation of it."" SUBURBIA is an exercise in suspense building. Unlike some of the more generic and slapdash thrillers which instantly show their explicit and gory hands, this one takes its time to get to the graphic blood-curling. It lulls you with its pace and rhythm; it sets you up and makes you susceptible to the whims of your imagination.

There's an investment in Kale's character. Time is granted for the audience to get to know him and sympathize with his loss, frustration, and pain and with his sense of entrapment and displacement. In fact, the plot takes a side trip into John Hughes country when next door dream Ashley is introduced. Enter teen angst and teen hormones and teen dilemmas. But then Ashley also provides the impetus for Kale to seriously poke his nose into the goings-on surrounding the mysterious Mr. Turner.

When things start to happen, they're initially insignificant and unremarkable. There is momentary news on the telly of a woman's kidnapping. Then a dented Mustang rolls up coinciding with the vehicle description on the news. A neighbor's late night date takes a turn for the worse. Something icky is dragged down the stairs. And, gradually, niggling suspicions begin to seep into Kale's mind.

The cast, it's a fine one. David Morse is dang good at playing villains and brilliant at exuding bad vibes. Whenever I watch him in these kind of roles, I'm unsure of him. I never quite know what he's up to. There are two scenes with Morse which stand out for me: one in Kale's house wherein Mr. Turner meets Kale face to face for the first time, another in which Mr. Turner creepily terrorizes Ashley in her car. Both scenes pulsate with a quiet, terrible menace as projected by Morse. Lovely Carrie-Anne Moss plays Kale's mother and I could wish that she were on the screen more, but, in retrospect, the film's not really about her. But, still. Sarah Roemer, who should probably start doing other stuff than horror/thriller flicks, has got that sexy Jessica Biel thing going on, in looks and in screen persona. There's a bit of wildness in her Ashley which quickly devastates Kale and every other male in the vicinity.

The film's success depends hugely on Shia LaBoeuf, and I think he pulls it off. The things that happen, the things that his character ends up doing - LaBoeuf is such a natural actor that you buy into what Kale is thinking and feeling so that when he ends up pulling those crazy stunts, well, you're with him. Shia effortlessly carries the film.

The special features are plentiful but nondescript: a film commentary by the director and cast members LaBeouf and Roemer; 4 deleted scenes totalling 4 and a half minutes (three of which focus on Carrie-Anne Moss's character); the ""Making Of"" featurette (15 minutes long, it also mentions how Morse deliberately didn't speak to Shia for the first few months of shooting - ahh, method acting); a Serial Pursuit Trivia Pop-Up Quiz; Gag reel (kind of lame, especially the fishing outtakes); the music video: ""Don't Make Me Wait"" by This World Fair; a photo gallery; and the theatrical trailer.

It's been a while since I've experienced a thoughtful, well-executed teen thriller. I might have to go all the way back to SCREAM. DISTURBIA is head and shoulders above the shabby likes of the recent WHEN A STRANGER CALLS and BLACK CHRISTMAS remakes. DISTURBIA, with its measured tempo, sneaks up on you. You get suckered into watching these kids at play with their seemingly harmless adventure as they get spooked a little along the way, but with, really, nothing concretely nefarious surfacing. Morse's character provides occasionally chilling moments, but still you're not quite sure if he's the killer or a red herring. That is, until the last 20 minutes or so, after which all hell breaks loose. DISTURBIA hits you up with a little romance, a bit of humor, a security ankle bracelet as a key plot device, several nerve-wracking moments, a game of cat and mouse, and a touch of serial killing. And I did enjoy how Kale finally got even with his bratty tormentors.",1191888000,2,5551,4.817418677859392

Lebeouf plays Kale, a troubled kid on 3 months house arrest during summer vacation.  When a hotgirl moves in next door, Kale and his buddy enjoy the view until they see something they shouldn't.  The question is:  did they see anything?  or is isolation and boredom playing tricks on them?

7596156,3,B01A9LM9B2,"Disturbia is a modernized remake of Alfred Hitchock's ""Rear Window,"" which places it a great disadvantage from the start.  Hitchcock is somebody who just can't be credibly recreated.  The biggest problem I have with this film, though, is the fact that it is clearly aimed at teenagers.  If you are over 25 (35 in my case), you are probably going to be disappointed and a little annoyed at this film.  The lead character (a teenage boy) punches his spanish teacher in the face and is sentenced to spend his summer break on house arrest.  After his mother takes away his internet accounts and television, he decides to pass the time by spying on his neighbors.  Most of the film involves him and his buddy spying on the cute teenage girl who lives next door.  Of course a romance soon develops between them.  On the good side, once you've made it through the first 45 minutes or so, the pace of the film really picks up.  The lead character soon suspects that another one of his neighbors is a serial killer.  As him and his friends try to find the truth, the film actually becomes rather engrossing.  The final scenes of the film are really quite good.  I just wish they had made this film with an adult lead character and aimed at an adult audience.  This would have been a much more classy movie if that were the case.",1190764800,2,1319,4.468619246861925

Don't get me wrong, it isn't a terrible film and Iv'e seen far far worse; but, there films to be watched such as ""Zodiac"" which to my mind is where you would be better off spending your money.",1190332800,,365,4.013698630136986
7596161,4,B01A9LM9B2,"DISTURBIA is a hip tale about a restless middle-class teen (SHIA LaBEOUF--what a name!!) under house arrest after punching his Spanish teacher and forced to wear a leg bracelet that sets off an alarm if he goes outside his restricted bounds. When his mother deprives him of entertainment as further punishment, he starts spying on some interesting neighbors, a la James Stewart in REAR WINDOW, with plenty of modern tools, like camcorders, at his disposal. It's a gimmicky tale but it works.

It starts with a brutal road accident after a fishing trip with his dad that ends with a startling scene before the title credit. But it takes awhile for the story to get into high gear and start delivering the chills one is waiting for in a tale of this kind.

SARAH ROEMER is the pretty girl next door who is soon joining Shia in his spying activities; AARON YOO supplies plenty of comic relief as Shia's Oriental friend; CARRIE-ANNE MOSS is understandably under a strain as Shia's stressed out mother; and David MORSE is sufficiently creepy as the neighbor suspected of harboring some dark secrets.

Handsomely photographed, it's a letdown only when the shaky camera movement is used for certain crucial scenes such as the finale in a dark cellar. It seems that every filmmaker today likes to use that technique which should have been restricted to the likes of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.

The last twenty-five minutes are well staged and exciting, building up to the suspenseful climax. Shia deserves full praise for practically carrying the film with an authentic portrait of an energetic teen with too much time on his hands.

It's a satisfying thrill ride but not something to go out of your way to see.

On the debit side: The most disturbing thing about the DVD commentary by the director, Shia and Sarah, is that it's not exactly illuminating. Shia has them both counting how many times he says ""S**t"" within the space of a scene (and throughout the commentary too) which immediately cracks them up. It goes downhill from that point on. They chuckle like kids over every punch line or comic moment with little insight into the storyline. Sophomoric discussion, to say the least.",1190073600,3,2179,4.828418230563003
7596162,4,B01A9LM9B2,"Why would people think they are going to hate Disturbia?  First off any new film at all linked in any way shape or form to anything Alfred Hitchcock has done has a built in crowd of people who are going to hate it, regardless if it's good or not.  Plot wise it is in some ways taking from Rear Window as the Amazon plot synopsis says, I can see that, but pretend you didn't hear that.  Hitchcock's Rear Window is a great classic, this isn't that, end of story.

Secondly the way we see teens these days could annoy anyone.  Growing up in an age where it's against the law for parents to discipline a kid now.  Also if you've ever watched MTV, specifically ""The Real World"", which basically is the opposite of it's title.  In the show they take seven models who they know are going to disagree and are young spoiled and immature mostly, put them in a mansion, and give them a dream job without working for anything, That's the real world?  Hardly.  Perhaps you have privileged kids that grew up in the suburbs, who, have never been in a fight of any sort, acting all ghetto, claiming you best give them respect when they've never earned any, and think there tough because they saw a rap video, and think turning there hat to the side makes them a gangster.  Obviously this isn't every teenager and I'm sure every teen from every generation have their flaws, just in this day and age it's all over you tube and television with reality tv.
And sometimes you get directors and writers of horror flicks that I have to think base how they think teenagers act by what they've seen solely on MTV or the latest cell phone commercial.  Disturbia is none of those things.

The Negatives, sure there are a lot of plot holes, but before you yell them out give the film a chance, it may answer them and may not need our feedback at the screen.  Somethings get far fetched but the good out weighs the bad in my opinion.

So, what's good about Disturbia.  You have a character in LaBeouf who is actually a good and likable kid, and Labeouf shows his acting chops and great range.  He shows great anger and passion without saying much but more than a look in his eyes when a teacher makes an out of line comment about his father who passed.  Then he shows us convincing rage when his friend plays a joke on him.  None of it is over the top and it's all believable.  When his mom walks up behind him in his room as he is peering out the window and scares him, he doesn't yell at her and say something like, ""like mom like what are you doing in my room like totally get out"", he's cool with her and jokes with her ""your like a ninja or something"" and it's actually funny.  You have to give credit to the writers who apparently know teens beyond what they see on MTV and write relatable lines and scenarios for Labeouf that he adds to with his acting talent.

To recap, you get a good entertaining thriller from literally start to finish, with a script that is teens could relate to in a horror/thriller like Apatow does with comedy.  And a rising star in Labeouf with that it factor who grows beyond the Disney kid, or the project greenlight guy, and keeps moving forward.  He also pulled of a hilarious hosting job on SNL earlier in the year as well.  I would recommend this for some good fun and entertainment and I think teenagers, the one's we like, will love this film.
It may not be this artistic film but I actually bit my nails, no lie.

The Hd dvd looked and sounded amazing as usual.",1189900800,2,3474,4.315870570107858
7596163,2,B01A9LM9B2,"As everybody knows by now, Disturbia was pretty much a modernized remake of Hitchcocks 'Rear Window"" for the teen scene.

For all practical purposes nothing of substance happens for the first 50 minutes of the this film, thus suspense is never really built like in Hitchcock's work.

When things start to happen, it does so in a largely irritating manner due to the two (2) criminal sins too many film makers commit today........

1) Keeping the story going by having everybody do the dumbest actions possible.

2) Ignore the laws of physics and reality.

If you are watching a murderer thru binoculars from across the street and the very moment you set them down, you turn and find that killer standing in your 2nd floor bedroom then somehow that killer is either magical or owns a molecular transporter.
All thru this movie, the killer appears and dissapears instantaneously near our main characters even if they just saw the killer 100 yards away only 2 seconds earlier.

I suppose this was done to ""surprise"" the audience, but it comes across quite silly.

7596174,4,B01A9LM9B2,"First let me point out I have been a fan of Alfred Hitchcock since the 1950s. That said anyone claiming this movie stole from his ""Rear Window"" hasn't seen Hitchcock's movie in awhile or doesn't get it. I have seen all the Hitchcock remakes and movies following his style. I regularly go back and watch Hitchcock's movies and I just didn't see it duplicated here. Far to many things that are quite different from the original but even if there was a similarity because it is based on it I think Hitch would have gotten a kick out of this movie. I found it very entertaining and well acted. The directing, sets, and effects were nicely done. It reminded me of the better teen thrillers with much more put into suspense and not so much in gory hack and slash and heavy metallica. Fans of the movies like ""The Lookout"", ""Cellular"" and ""Phone Booth"" will probably enjoy it.

A young man is devastated over the loss of his father in an auto accident so he commits a few minor misdemeanors and ends up under house arrest with a foot monitor. While watching his neighbors, his best friend drops by regularly. They meet the new girl that moved in next door and start hanging out together. He starts noticing some odd things after hearing about a girls disappearance and a early model Mustang with a dent in it. It seems one of his neighbors drives such a car. As he observes more he becomes more suspicious and concerned for his mother and girlfriend. I recommend this movie. You don't have to be a teenager to enjoy this movie. I recommend this for purchasing since it has good replayability and most teens and adults will enjoy it.

7596176,2,B01A9LM9B2,"First things first, the only similarity this 2007 movie has with Alfred Hitchcock's classic voyeuristic thriller, 1954's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rear-Window/dp/B00003CXC7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rear Window</a>, is the basic concept of a temporarily immobile protagonist who sees highly suspicious activity from a distance only to find he may be endangered by what he may have witnessed. Other than the central plot device, the comparison falls apart since director D.J. Caruso (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Salton-Sea/dp/B00005JKM2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Salton Sea</a>) seems intent on making a teen-oriented thrill ride driven by angst and hormones. The focal point is teenaged Kale Brecht who has to spend his summer under police surveillance through a motion-detection ankle bracelet. The laborious set-up for this situation takes a good half-hour, though this is likely the best part of the film as it begins with a car crash visceral in impact and impressive in technical execution.

Reeling from the tragic results of the accident, Kale punches his Spanish teacher in the face, for which the bracelet is his punishment. Increasingly bored and incorrigible, he has his electronic toys taken away by his exasperated mother, leaving him nothing to do but watch his neighbors with binoculars. Two figures new to the neighborhood come into focus - Ashley, a comely neighbor who becomes Kale's object of pubescent desire, and Mr. Turner, a taciturn bachelor whose suspicious behavior peaks Kale's interest and imagination. What happens next is unfortunately predictable and downright lazy, as screenwriters Carl Ellsworth and Christopher B. Landon eschew much of the psychological elements of the supposedly tense situation in favor of overly familiar, crowd-pleasing scare tactics.

The violent, drawn-out finale is beyond absurd and further saddled by the restrictions of the film's PG-13 rating. In a role almost identical to the one he plays in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transformers/dp/B000NU2NJ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Transformers</a>, Shia LaBeouf brings energy and at times surprising gravity to Kale though not enough to compensate for the script's shortcomings.

Even though he has the funniest lines, Aaron Yoo's role as goofball best pal Ronnie is poorly conceived to fit the plot machinations, and bereft of her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Matrix/dp/B00000K19E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Matrix</a>&nbsp;coolness factor, Carrie-Anne Moss seems ill-used as Kale's put-upon mother. With his soft voice and unshakable manner, David Morse looks like he is having a good time playing Turner, but the character's revelations toward the end unravel any momentum of fear he was able to muster before.

The 2007 DVD has the standard set of extras with the most prominent being a rather flat, undisciplined commentary track from Caruso, LaBeouf and Roemer and a marginally better fifteen-minute making-of featurette. ""The Making of Disturbia"". There are four deleted scenes, all serving to deepen the relationship between Kale and his mother, and a few outtakes, mostly around the opening fishing sequence. Also included is the theatrical trailer, a pop-up quiz that is really a series of pop-up bubbles and a Caruso-directed music video of ""Don't Make Me Wait"" by This World Fair.",1188777600,5,3804,6.42578125

7596179,4,B01A9LM9B2,"""Disturbia"" isn't original.  It isn't too scary or gory either.  What it is, though, is a fun popcorn yarn about a teen named Kale (Shia LeBeouf) who's placed under house arrest for taking out a little internal anguish on a Spanish teacher.  His mother (Carrie-Anne Moss) takes away his television, his music and his X-box.  What's a bored teen living in suburbia to do to pass the time?  Spy on the neighbors, of course.  It helps that his newest neighbor, Ashley (Sarah Roemer), is a knockout and takes regularly scheduled swims and rooftop reading breaks.  Once he has all of his neighbors' daily lives timed perfectly, he introduces his friend, Ronnie (Aaron Yoo), to his voyeuristic world.  The duo gets caught spying on Ashley but she ends up befriending them when they tell her that they believe one particular neighbor, Mr. Turner (the underused David Morse), might be a serial killer from Texas who was never captured.

This sets the film into motion.  The three friends try to uncover the truth about their very private neighbor.  The only problem is that with each clue they find that might lead to the truth, Turner seems to be one step ahead of them.  Things get even crazier when the police think that Kale is crying wolf over everything.

What I really enjoyed about this film is that it's very funny.  I'm not talking about it being funny in a sophomoric, slasher movie way, there's some very smart humor here.  Director D.J. Caruso keeps the humor spread just thin enough to keep the suspense at an acceptable level.  The cast is very likeable.  LeBeouf has an ever-present goofiness about him, but when he needs to be afraid or angry, he pulls it off perfectly.  Morse is sneaky and sinister at the same time.  Whether he's a murderer or not, the guy will creep you out.  Moss is solid, but has a very small role to fill.  LeBeouf's pals do a good job as well.

The DVD doesn't have much to offer outside of the film that's worth more than one look.  There's the standard ""Making Of"" featurette, outtakes, a forgettable music video, deleted scenes, and a photo gallery.  The digital transfer is good, and the audio is nice as well.

Overall, ""Disturbia"" is a very fun suspense flick.  It's not Hitchcock-caliber, but then again, so few films are.  If you want Hitchcock, don't watch ""Disturbia.""  If you want a good film to watch for a quiet evening at home, this film's the one for you.",1188604800,15,2405,4.6350710900473935
7596180,4,B01A9LM9B2,"As thrillers go (especially ones garnered toward the younger population) they're either hit or miss. With the revival of teen horror/thriller films, most as of late have been a rather large rotting pile of miss. In the beginning, I was highly skeptical and quite annoyed with Disturbia, especially when it gained so much success in the box-office. [""Shallow teenagers strike again"" I thought.] So naturally, my curiosity was aroused and thus I decided to find out how I would like the movie myself. If you don't concern yourself with the popularity (or a particular someone starring in it) of this film, or its surprising success given its genre, then you just might find yourself enjoying the Non-Rear Window-'inspired' ---its not a remake of the elder film, as most people assume though its obviously inspired by it--- film. Honestly it reminded me of ""What Lies Beneath"", another Hitchcock inspired film, minus the cheating/vengeful husband and lurking ghosts). Unlike ""Stick It (2006)"" it nearly manages to fall away from its cliche Teen-movie atmosphere before tumbling back down the slope into mediocrity.

The beginning of the film introduces us to Kale Brecht (Shia LaBeouf) on a fishing trip, of his own volition, with his father, Daniel Brecht (Matt Craver), attempting to catch an illusive fish to no avail. The two are heading home when they become the unfortunate victims of a car accident (caused partly by a distracted Kale, partly by a large SUV, though its debatable) which only Kale manages to survive. Fast forward one year later, we find a depressed Kale asleep in class and unable to answer a seemingly simple question in his Spanish class. However, Se&ntilde;or Gutierrez (Rene Rivera), unwilling to let Kale off the hook when given an undecided answer and decides to guilt-trip the boy by inquiring ""What would your father think?"" and his rightfully popped in the face for his troubles. Although justified, Kale is let off easy by the courts and is placed under 3 month house arrest for the assault. Should be easy right?

Not for Kale.

Kale's attempts to keep himself busy are derailed when his stern-but-loving mother, Julie Brecht (Carrie-Ann Moss), cancels his iTunes and X-BOX Live memeberships (he doesn't even consider playing games offline. Idiot) and cuts the cord to Television when he decides to get smart with her [that was priceless scene]. Now without a 'constructive' thing to do, Kale takes vengeance on the washing machine and dishwasher, whilst attempting to get news from the outside world via Ronnie (Aaron Yoo), but to no avail. After peering upon a young woman, Ahsley Carlson (Sarah Roemer), moving into the Suburbs with her family and immediately taking attraction to her, it is then, that Kale dares to venture into his father's study to retrieve his red-tinted Binoculars and do some spying on the neighborhood --- or rather peep in on Ashley through her open window. (Apparently the Suburbs don't have a problem  with thieves and peeping toms.) He pays little attention to the docile Robert Turner (David Morse) until spots Mr. Turner coming home one night with a dented 1960's/1967 era Ford Mustang as described like the one missing in a murder case of a young woman. Aided by newcomer Ashley and best friend Ronnie, Kale attempts to unravel the mystery enshrouding Mr. Turner when, what started out as a game to dispel boredom becomes far too real for him to handle.

Post-House Arrest, DISTURBIA focuses the first half-hour on Kale's painfully obvious inability to cope with the fact that he is virtually cooped up in his house without the simple pleasures of an out-and-about boy, save his Sixty-Gigabyte iPod and Television. It takes its time to build on Kale's character, which at times felt like I was watching an obnoxious, sometimes moody ""Shia LaBeouf"" and not ""Kale Brecht"", [I.E., the character felt far too similar to the personality the actor emits to the public instead of 'Kale', a character we know little about aside from the beginning of the movie], before introducing the romantic interest played Sarah Roemer. Ironically it doesn't even focus on the source of Kale [and Julie's] problems (his dead father). The plot is nothing of the unexpected nature, the trailer tells you right off what its about to an extent, but it is handled intelligently. In the first time watching it, the film does make one jump with the sudden raise in tensity in the music or the usual one-time only cheap scare ploys. Instead Disturbia plays off its story to the audience in a way that doesn't behave as if the viewer isn't supposed to know what's going on. It also manages to surprise you every now and again with tiny plot twists or deceptions. However, as this 104 Minute movie reaches the climax, the slow and steady pace is dropped for a rushed ending of the expected kind and that disappointed me greatly. The movie is great and yet the editor and director decided that they were tired of taking their time and just dropped all semblance of patience and destroy the atmosphere (cut out ""What Lies Beneath""s chloroform scenario/bath tub scene and you've got yourself an unsatisfying ending to a otherwise excellent movie). Either that or they ran out of ideas on how make the movie another hour longer. With the way it ended, with its lame cliche-happy ending suck-face session, DISTURBIA really made me believe they could've gone another way with it.

The acting in this film is top notch from some of the actors, while others are just less than convincing. First off, Carrie-Anne Moss as Julie Bracht makes a convincing mother whom, for once, isn't portrayed as stupid and completely unawares of the situation her son has gotten himself into. However, Moss' character is under utilized in this film and watching the Deleted Scenes (""Do you want to Talk?"" - ""I Forbid it"" - and - ""You Are Breaking my Heart"") showcase this point clearly with amazing scenes between Moss and LaBeouf. These scenes also touch on the fact that Julie was supposedly dating Mr. Turner and how the loss of her husband created a rift between mother and son. David Morse, the memorable bad-cop from ""16 BLOCKS"", is convincing as the unsettling Robert Turner, a seemingly kind man and understanding person. Like, Carrie-Anne Moss, Morse is also an under utilized actor who performs to the best of his abilities with so little he has for a character. Aaron Yoo as Kale's quirky and typical sidekick buddy [in way of EVEN STEVEN's Twitty], Ronnie (the only main character in the movie with one name aside from ""Greenwood"") is funny and convincingly serious though moments like that are few and far between. Shia LaBeouf, surprisingly, has managed to become a convincing actor since ""HOLES"", and while his past and recent (when I say recent, I meant ""Surf's Up"" recent. He was excellent in TRANSFORMERS) films are shy of interesting or compelling, and while his performance in this film is good, the character he plays is a more mellow version of Sam Witwicky, only Sam Witwicky is the more interesting character. Whilst the circumstances between the two characters are majorly different, their quirks and end results (geek gets the girl) are practically the same. LaBeouf's performance in DISTURBIA is nearly identical to that in TRANSFORMERS. He's got a ways to go before he becomes a truly great character actor, but he defiantly is one of the better actors of his age. And lastly, Sarah Roemer's presence in this movie is completely forgettable (but given her movie resume in the industry, I'm not surprised). Her performance Ashley Carlson is composed of slanking about in that would-be sensual way with her shoulders half-hunched, drawling out her words, and appearing shallow to the rest of the world while Kale sees a much more complex person. If Ashley was 'more than meets the eye' then the writers should've portrayed as such, instead of the actually shallow ""your mom's hot"" conformist romantic interest. The only time she actually hit me was a character of some depth is when she was spying on and went against Mr. Turner at the end of the movie.

Acting aside, Geoff Zanelli's score for DISTURBIA is without a doubt a score I would invest money in buying. Naturally, it reflects the atmosphere and the characters it surrounds, with quirky up-beat themes to tense and action packed themes suitable for a fleeting thriller movie such as this. The theme used for Kale and Daniel's fishing trip is probably the best amongst the more lighter themes (aside from 'Poofoot' ^_^). The 'Voyeurism' theme, while symbolical and emotionally moving, was missused in wrong the scenes and played almost repetitively whenever Ashley Carlson would show up, which was irritating to say the least. Another irritating, yet amusing, and repetitive theme used is the one whenever Kale would enter his father's study (especially after he lays out the guidelines of his Ankle's monitor's 100ft limit and sees Ashley again). As for the 'Various Artists' soundtrack; If you want a bad soundtrack just pick up Disturbia's second CD Release. While I commend the use of elder bands (from the year 2000), the music chosen is terrible, especially the theme for 'Kale and Ashley' they decided to make a Music Video for (do you see a pattern here?). Compared to the awesome pile of crap they call music they have featured in this, TRANSFORMERS - THE ALBUM is a gem (and it is).

So all in all, DISTURBIA is an great movie, but with a little more time spent on fleshing out the characters and the storyline overall, it would've been excellent. But as it is, its probably one of the better thrillers of 2007 since ""Premonition"". ---- [a 4 out of 5] ------ [8/30/31/07]",1188518400,4,9675,4.913149847094801

Although I usa a PS3 as my primary and only Blu-ray, it does the job very well!!! I purchased this title mainly because of its great storyline, cinematography, and the fact that its one of the last titles made on Blu-ray before Paramount's switch to HD-DVD which I think was a huge mistake!

There are going to be spoilers here so if you don't want to read any than stop now.  This movie starts off with a big dramatic car accident.  It is basically pointless.  They use it as a reason for the child (who is in the accident with his dad who dies) to get in trouble later in school.  A teacher says something about his father and he hits the teacher.  Then they show him in court with the teacher being put under house arrest.  Now he can't leave his home because of a ankle thing. (like lindsey lohans)  So now that 20 some minutes of your life have been wasted watching this, it only gets worse.  He thinks he sees a neighbor kill someone and he is trying to prove it.  With the help of some girl who he watches through his window at random times.  The entire movie NOTHING and I mean NOTHING happens.  It's an hour and 40 plus minutes of the boy and girl trying to find out if this guy really did it.  Then the end is one of the worst endings I have ever seen.  I will not tell you about the end though.  That will be for you to watch.  When you are done this movie, you will be sitting there thinking uh.... what.  I am not going to say don't see it because everyone likes different things but I think the age group for this movie is 12-16.",1188259200,3,1389,3.9927272727272727
7596183,3,B01A9LM9B2,"Three months before Shia LaBeouf's leading role in the Summer of 2007's blockbuster Transformers, he appeared in Disturbia.

""Every killer lives next door to someone"" is the tagline on the movie poster, and the movie's trailer expands on the spoiler-tagline by coming right out with the detail of how a high school senior (LaBeouf) living under house-arrest discovers his neighbor is a serial killer. So all that's left untold for viewers in Disturbia is what LaBeeouf's character and friends do about it.

Disturbia makes frequent attempts at humor, but most of the intended funny moments border on corny. The target audience of this movie clearly comes off as 13 - 24 year olds...the Scream crowd&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scream-Trilogy-Boxed-Set/dp/B00004W20F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scream Trilogy - Boxed Set</a>&nbsp;. But Disturbia is far from how well done the Scream films were done. Kids and young adults will find some of the humor in Disturbia amusing, but serious thriller fans will tire quickly of some of the campyness.

There are some good, thrilling moments in Disturbia, but the suspense is lost in how predictable the movie is...especially after how much of the plot is deliberately given in advance to viewers that saw the trailer.

Overall the movie was good, and the I-just-have-to-see-what-happens-next factor kept me interested enough to be entertained.

7596185,5,B01A9LM9B2,"A very smart, suspenseful, well crafted thriller. A sort of re-imagining of Hitchcocks's classic, ""Rear Window,"" make no mistake that this is a successful movie in it's own right. Besides the basic premise of a person that is confined to his home, consumed with boredom, spends too much time looking out his window at neighbors, and might have seen his neighbor murder somebody, ""Disturbia"" has it's own characters, which I might add, are very rich in character development. Shia LaBeouf was tremendous here. I have heard the buzz about him, but this is the first movie I have seen of his. He is going to be a huge star. He gives a knock-out performance here, and has a very likable presence, and very handsome in a non-typical Hollywood way. He gives both emotionally and physically to this role. Playing the main character, in house arrest, as he and his friends try to put the puzzle together, LaBeouf and his co-stars Dominic Daniel and Aaron Yoo have great chemistry here. The villain is fleshed out pretty well, and is pretty creepy. The suspense keeps building until the action packed conclusion, which was a bit typical, but still works. I really recommend this movie and look forward to future films starring Shia LeBeouf.",1188000000,4,1231,4.838862559241706
7596186,4,B01A9LM9B2,"This was an excellent movie. Shia LaBeouf is the standout star of this year. Ten years from now he will have a resume' to rival that of Tom Crusie ""before his eggs quit flipping, if you know what I mean"". He has the talent  and screen presence to be a leading man for a long time. He is a good/going to be a great character/action/romance actor. I truly believe the sky is the limit, unless of course he gets drunk and mows down three old broads going to the grocery store.  His girlfriend in the movie really had this Jennifer Beale thing going. The movie probably would have worked better had his best friend became Chinese sausage meat.  I am always critical of slasher/horror/thrillers having so much blood and guts to the point where it desensitizes the viewers. I would say that is the exact opposite of this one. We did not get to see not one murder. One murder would have educated the viewers of the threat to all of our key players. After all the neighbor from St. Elsewhere, who, by the way did an excellent job, is a serial killer. The cameras should have been inside the house when he butchered the red-head, even if he had to murder her later on in the movie. If there is a murderer in a movie, we really need to SEE one , not know that one has taken place. We needed to see blood once, not blood and guts or entrail eating or neighbor disembowelment.  This did subtract from the  movie.

A mail lead usually does not work in this genre, but Shia is young enough and innocent enough to pull off the ""don't hurt the deer in the headlight"" that every audience yearns for in thrillers. The crash sequence pertaining to his father , in the begining, was excellently done. The subsequent rebellion and angst was performed perfectly. I loved this movie. One other thing would have helped this movie. If the teachers' cousin, the cop, had been more of a butthole to LaBeouf's character, we would've appreciated his death a little more. If the officer, had helped LaBeouf in the end, changing our opinion of the officer, then getting beaten a little more before his neck problems, this would have made us even more satisfied when the killer got his.

All in all, a very good movie, with a break out star, in a break out role. Transformers didn't hurt either, but I hate those d*&)? gobots.",1187913600,,2294,4.447619047619048
7596187,4,B01A9LM9B2,"This film finds a way to make a kind of post-traumatic stress / cabin fever with a touch of paranoia thrown in entertaining.  Not a slight achievement.  The film opens with Daniel Brecht (Matt Craven) and his son, Kale (Shia LeBeouf) fishing and showing us their happy family life.  On the way home, things become shockingly bad.  A year later it gets worse when Kale decks a Spanish teacher who is upset at Kale's being so withdrawn.

A judge sentences Kale to a summer home detention with a 100 ft radius ankle bracelet monitor.  His mother (Carrie-Ann Moss) takes away his video games and TV.  The boy is left to watching his neighbors through binoculars.  It is a Hollywood convention that if you peel back the surface of suburbia all kinds of disturbing things are going on.

One of the neighbors he watches is a new move in named Ashley (Sarah Roemer).  His friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) joins the observation, and, of course, Ashley catches them and joins their little paranoid band.  They focus their attention and neighbor Mr. Turner (David Morse) who is a very private person who loves to mow his lawn.  Kale becomes convinced he is something very sinister, but his friends do not want to go down that path.

The rest of the movie is about exploring those fears and allegations while being trapped within a 100 ft. radius of the monitor.  The comic relief is provided by a mischievous group of kids who live on another side of the house.  They are typically obnoxious pre and early teen boys and, what is the saying?  Oh, yeah, hijinks ensue.

The movie does create a fine sense of confusion by not letting you know exactly which way it is going to go with the plot until it actually has to make a choice.  I think the culmination of events is handled quite well and everyone leaves pretty much OK.  The movie is sufficiently rude for our time without going over the edge into being raw or obscene.

This is without a doubt one of the worst films I have ever seen. It's definitely the worst film of 2007 so far... Before I sat down to watch this film I had been mislead to believe that this would be some kind of thriller... In actuality, this film takes the worst elements and clich&eacute;s of every teen drama ever made and meshes them together into a nice little inoffensive package. Yeah, sure, essentially this film is about a killer who lives next door and an average teen who foils his plans and blah, blah, blah... But, there is nothing remotely interesting about this flick and it's submerged in so much putrid banality that one cannot help but to think ""hey, haven't I seen all of this before in another movie starring Tom Hanks?"" And yet this film is about a hundred times more watered down and it is loaded with the kind of sickening, corny sentimentality that can only be found in the likes of a made for TV Lifetime special. With that said, anyone equating this pile of cinema dung with the flawless classic Rear Window is just an idiot. I had been told that this was a modern day Rear Window but, if anything, it's just a hollow representation of that great film. While Rear Window had you at the edge of your seat this film has you rolling your eyes thinking to yourself ""how come no one I knew in High School acted like the characters on screen? And why must Hollywood always stereotype teenage guys as being sex crazed idiots?"" This is the type of film that represents everything that is wrong with cinema today.

7596189,4,B01A9LM9B2,"Based on Alfred Hitchcock's `Rear Window,' `Disturbia' has all the hardware you'd might expect. Instead of just binoculars and an old fashioned flash camera, we have cell phones, computers, and video cameras. Not just relying on technology, the movie is a thoroughly enjoyable voyeur fantasy. Starting from ""the girl next door"" to unsettling sights across the way, Kane (Shia LaBeouf), an older adolescent, has had troubled times. With a father dead in an auto accident in which Kane was present, he is shackled to a detector on his ankle in a house arrest for ""popping out"" his teacher who made a dishonorable remark about his recently deceased dad. Mom is loving and understanding but won't put up with much.

All the technology points to his neighbors. First it's attraction (Carrie-Anne Moss); then, it's suspicion, for Robert Turner, whose kinky escapades with loose women come and go, giving mixed messages. Much like `Undertow' in the sense that Kane's troubled past gives him hardly a leg to stand on, the protagonist finds himself in trouble up to his chin. 'Disturbia' has some familiar components including some false scares that are overly reminiscent of 'Halloween' and other horror/ thrillers, but the editing is so expert, one seldom cares. Thoroughly entertaining, the cast and screenplay keep the story real, and director D.J. Caruso keeps the pace admirably slick and believable.  Furthermore, Shia LaBeouf is a wonder as the thoroughly believable and effective role as Kane.

Teaming up w/ Ashley and his friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo), Kale sets out to find evidence that could prove his theories about the odd Mr. Turner. DISTURBIA is a taught thriller w/ good doses of humor to help give us a false sense of security. As others have said, REAR WINDOW immediately pops into mind here. However, other movies have used similar themes. For instance- THE BURBS, FRIGHT NIGHT, ABOMINABLE, and of course, DePalma's BODY DOUBLE- all have the same basic elements, done in drastically differing ways.

When his Mother (Carrie-Anne Moss) takes away his television and video games he finds he has nothing else to do but watch the coming and going of the neighbors with his trusty binoculars.

Things begin to look up when a new family moves next door with an attractive girl (Sarah Roemer) his age however things take a turn for the worse when he starts to suspect another new neighbor (David Morse) to be a serial killer. Has his house arrest finally gotten to him, or does he know something that everyone else is unaware of?

Critique: `Disturbia' is a blending of two earlier films that you've probably seen, the classic `Rear Window' from '54 and the cult classic horror `Fright Night' from '85. `Disturbia' does add some nuances of its own to the mixture, the best being the talented Shia LaBeof who's performance alone makes this movie worth watching. He sure likes to do alot of running in his films, mark my words Shia is destined to become the next Tom Cruise. If you enjoyed the two previously mentioned films you should enjoy this one as well. Consider it 'Fright Night' without the fangs and bat wings.

7596194,4,B01A9LM9B2,"I suspect that a large segment of those who watch ""Disturbia"" are not going to be aware that it is inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's classic ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rear-Window/dp/B00003CXC7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rear Window</a>"" unless somebody tells them.  But the parallels would have beeen obvious to me thirty minutes into the film and my perspective is that of someone who knows the original and is willing to see a different take on the story.  The screenplay by Christopher Landon (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Another-Day-In-Paradise/dp/B00000IBL1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Another Day In Paradise</a>"") and Carl Ellsworth (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Eye/dp/B000BVM1S2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Eye</a>"") maintains the basic premise of Cornell Woolrich's short story: someone confined to seeing the world by looking out their window becomes suspicious of a neighbor they discover is a murderer.

""Disturbia"" begins with a pair of scenes to set up the premise in a rather unusual way (Ironically we had caught the start of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Final-Destination-2/dp/B00005JLZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Final Destination 2</a>"" on television this afternoon).  The whole idea is to justify having Kale (Shia LaBeouf) confined at home with that ankle monitor and it is an interesting choice to have the highway scene and the schoolroom scene be the two halves of the equation.  There are a lot of ways of setting up the situation and there are some implications for the character and the story by setting it up this way.  Because this is the 21st century it is also necessary for Kale's mom (Carrie-Anne Moss) to strip away his ties to the Internet and other media and technology to make him willing to pick up a pair of binoculars and start spying on his neighbors (""reality without the TV,"" as he calls it).

Two people in particular attract Kale's interest once his lets his voyeuristic side loose.  The first is Ashley (Sarah Roemer), the girl who has moved next door with her family.  Kale has a great view of her bedroom and gets to watch her while she changes and when she goes swimming, but he is also intrigued by the fact she spends more time on her roof reading books than inside her house.  The other person of interest is Mr. Turner (David Morse, who certainly has played more than his fair share of villains since he was the idealistic young Dr. Jack Morrison on ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/St-Elsewhere/dp/B000GPPNO2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">St. Elsewhere</a>"").  Watching the news instead of his computer Kale picks up on a story about a missing woman and sees a connection to Turner.  The more he watches Turner, the more connections he makes and the more he pushes Ashley and his friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) to go where he cannot go to further investigate.  Of course, this is a most dangerous game and things turn deadly.

Directed by D.J. Caruso (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Salton-Sea/dp/B00005JKM2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Salton Sea</a>""), this 2007 film does a good job of playing out the exigencies and constraints of Kale's home confinement to make the story work, with ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf"" added to complicate things .  Unlike Hitchcock, who was working with looking out at a courtyard at a bunch of apartments with large picture windows, Caruso is using a neighborhood where houses have smaller window and those windows have curtains.  This means Kale's view of what is happening in these other houses in never quite as clear and it forces Caruso to find other ways to allow Kale (and the audience) to get a picture of what is happening.  The end game of ""Distrubia"" goes a way bigger than ""Rear Window,"" which I suppose is a necessity for a modern film, but which does not result in a better finale.  But by the time you get to the final act you have long abandoned trying to make everything in ""Disturbia"" match up with ""Rear Window.""  Ashley is her own character and not a teenage version of Grace Kelly, and Ronnie is definitely not channeling Thelma Ritter.  My major concern is that when we get to the tipping point, the moment where no matter what else happens the villain is not going to get away with it, things escalate.",1187395200,,4924,5.717808219178083

Anyway, you have the rebel teen who is of course an electronics whiz and his goofy buddy, Ronnie, who stole the scenery every time he was on camera.  He was hilarious. (Kind of stupid, but Hilarious).  The bad guy neighbor was okay, but really not that menacing.  Heck, he could have kept the whole thing secret if he'd just shrugged off the interference by the snoopy kids next door.  Ashley, played by Sarah Roemer was nice to look at, but when it came crunch time, where was she?  She could have just been a second buddy for Kale.  Another reveiwer got her performance right on: She played the part like a deer caught in the headlights.  And then there are the police in this film.  What community is this?  This kid with an ankle bracelet steps out of his yard and twenty seconds later it seems like the entire S.W.A.T. team is storming the front lawn.  Heck, I lived in Cleveland where you have to set off a flare and put up a searchlight to attract a patrol car.  I can't imagine that kind of response to a teenager walking away from his front yard wearing an ankle bracelet.  Then when it does count, the police just kind of say ""ho-hum, I'll get to it when I get to it.""  Officer Gutierez was asking for it if you ask me.  Anyway, this is definately worth a rental.

7596196,4,B01A9LM9B2,"The movie opens with Kale and his dad, a writer, fishing in a river and heading home (empty-handed) in their SUV with Kale driving.  Kale is 16 or 17 and obviously loves his dad very much.  A car behind them passes them driving recklessly and causes Kale to run into another car, lose control and flip the SUV.  Kale and his dad are injured but doing fine.  However, another oncoming car strikes their upside down SUV on the passenger side where Kale's dad is.  Kale gets out and runs around to the other side.  We, the audience, are spared seeing the dad but it is obvious from the expression on Kale's face that he is dead and it is not a pretty sight.  We go forward a year and Kale is in Spanish class at the end of the year and they are having an oral test.  Kale is obviously not paying attention and the teacher, Mr. Gutierrez, gets (in my opinion) a bit sarcastic with him and brings up Kale's dad.  Kale punches the teacher.  The teacher presses charges and Kale is put on 90 days house arrest.  He has to wear an ankle bracelet and can't go beyond 100 feet from the central monitor.  This means even the edges of his lot are not accessible on all sides.

Kale's mom takes away his X-Box and his iTunes capability so Kale is very bored.  He sees new neighbors moving in and goes out as there is a blond, sexy girl he wants to meet.  He steps on dog doo that was set on fire by some neighborhood boys of 10 or so.  He is frustrated he cannot do anything to them.  Kale also has a friend Ronnie who comes over to help relieve his boredom.  Kale shows Ronnie from different sides of his room and the house how he can see his across the street neighbor, the neighbors  on each side of him (the blond girl on the one side and an older man, Mr. Turner, on the other) and behind.  Kale gets to meet Ashley, the girl next door, when he violates his 100 foot limit and the police come!

Kale also watches TV a lot and sees a young woman is missing and the suspected vehicle that she left in is a blue 1960's Mustang with a dent on the left fender.  Mr. Turner has a blue 1960's Mustang with a dent on the left fender.

How Kale watches his neighbors including Mr. Turner and gets Ronnie and Ashley involved in what may or may not be happening and the final climax is very well done.  I found a few holes but at the same time it was pretty believable overall.  I also enjoyed Carrie-Ann Moss of the ""Matrix"" movies as Kale's mother.  David Morse at Mr. Turner was amazing as usual.

As soon as it came out, I immediately drove to Blockbuster to rent a copy. Sadly, a rental is all Disturbia is worth.

The premise of the movie amused me at first: a kid (Shia LaBeouf) is under house arrest because he punched one of his teachers, and he suspects that his neighbor is a serial killer. It sounds like a formula for success...but wait: they have to throw in a cheesy romance side-story and a handful of useless scenes that do nothing to progress the main plot. I won't give away the ending, but it is so utterly predictable and disappointing, not to mention there is a fight that takes place in the dark where I couldn't see anything that was happening (probably to tone the violence and blood down to keep the rating at a PG-13 level for the tweens.)

Once in a while we get a horror film that has all the ingredients to be a success. Perhaps it uses things that are not new, but with an excellent cast, chilling moments and strong storytelling, everything else works like a dream. Disturbia is about a boy who cannot legally leave his house, but believes the neighbor next door is a serial killer and with the help of his friends, he gets to investigate this individual. This is without a doubt, one of the best horror films of the year.

Story:
Wrathful boy Kale (Shia LaBeouf) is a high school student who lives his life as a renegade. He lost his father in a freak car accident--in a way he blames himself for this tragedy. A year passes by and now our boy is in a Spanish class where suddenly he punches his teacher for making a comment about his father. After committing this crime, he is sentenced to house arrest. A small alarm is attached to his leg, so if he leaves the perimeters of his house, the police will come. His mother Julie (Carrie-Anne Moss) is tired of Kale's behavior and accepts the punishment.

What is there to do for Kale? He cannot access the internet and he cannot leave his backyard. Suddenly a brand new world is wide open outside his window. He gets to observe people around the neighborhood. Things neighbors do are very interesting for Kale. Even a new girl just moved in. She becomes the focus of attention to Kale and falls for her. This quite neighborhood is about to change. Mr Turner (David Morse) lives next door, but he hides a secret that soon our young friend is about to find out.

Review:
Probably inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window. Disturbia is without a doubt, one of the best thrillers of 2007. The beginning might be slow for many, but this is because director D.J. Caruso wants to build Kale's character and he does a hell of a good job. He makes us care for Kale. We get to understand why he behaves the way he does, but his worried mother tries to reach out to him without success. He prefers to hang out with his friend Ronnie--Kale shows him things that go on around the neighborhood. Things get pretty interesting when he meets the girl next door Ashley. Kale loves to watch her in a very voyeur way. The suspense builds up once Mr. Turner is in the picture. At first we get some ""false alarms"" about his persona, but little by little, a new world of terror appears right in from of them.

Disturbia, besides the excellent plot and good acting, has moments full of suspense. The slasher film formula used is not new, but works. The great finale is a roller coaster of chilly moments that will keep you glued to your seats. I guarantee it.

The Verdict:
Disturbia works because of many reasons. It's well acted, has an excellent story, thrilling moments and a romantic touch. One of the best films of 2007.",1186963200,,2831,4.478682170542636
7596201,4,B01A9LM9B2,"In this film, Shia LaBeouf proves that he can carry a film alone.  In this twist of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"", LaBeouf plays Kale who is under house-arrest after an incident at school with his Spanish teacher.  So, his life revolves around the lives of his neighbors.  Kale has a special interest for his hot neighbor, Ashley, and arranges his time as peeping tom when Ashley swims in the pool and exercises in her room with blinds open.  Eventually, creepy neighbor, Mr. Turner, spooks Kale and he quickly recruits his best friend, Ronnie, and next-door girl, Ashley, to do some investigation.  Although this plot is predictable, the whole suspense is played out quite nicely between all the characters.  Overall, not overly-gross for those who are squeamish to this type of movie.  Amusing dialogue and entertaining with this modern take on ""Rear Window"".  I was especially amused by the techno gadgetry from simple electronics around the house.

For the DVD extras, you will find that outtake scenes are quite brief (only 2-3 minutes) compared to other films on DVD.  I was expecting at least 10 to 20 minutes of outtakes.  The ""Making of Disturbia"" special is pretty much what you would expect from a studio.  The same comments are made by the actors on the commentary as in the special.  Also, the commentaries are pretty uneven since the actors break into interruptions from phone calls and comment on food that they're eating.  Well, I guess that I would be pretty bored analyzing each scene to death as well.  The director, Shia LeBouf, and Sarah Roemer do provide some entertaining conversations especially about Shia's experience with creatine for beefing up before ""Transformers"".

7596204,2,B01A9LM9B2,"Alfred Hitchcock just won't go away. It has been 30 years since Hitchcock directed his last film, ""Family Plot"", but his work still seems fresh and original as it continues to inspire young directors. In 2007 we have already had two Hitchcockian rip-offs, ""Vacancy"" and this film.

 ""Disturbia"" follows Kale (Shia LaBeouf) who is sentenced to three months house arrest after hitting his Spanish teacher, after the teacher made insensitive remarks towards Kale's dad who passed away in a suspious car accident in which Kale was also part of.

 Kale is about to go stir crazy after his mother, Julie (Carrie-Anne Moss) takes away his x-box, TV and itunes, now Kale may actually have to do something constructive! But don't worry, Kale is not going to fall for that, he creates a nice diversion for himself by spying on his neighbors who include a new family to the neighborhood and their very pretty daughter, Ashley (Sarah Roemer) as well as Mr. Turner (David Morse), whom Kale suspects is actually a serial killer responsible for the recent disappearances of several young girls.

 Now if the idea of a person locked up in their house, spying on their neighbors and thinking they have unwittingly stumbled upon a murder scene reminds you of anything it should be Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"".

 ""Rear Window"" has Jimmy Stewart as a wheel-chair bound photographer whom after spying on his neighbors thinks he has seen one of them kill their wife. Now, with the help of Grace Kelly and Thelma Ritter, the trio will try to solve the case the police seem to ignore.

 I guess that makes Shia LaBeouf the Jimmy Stewart of this movie, Sarah Roemer is our Grace Kelly and LaBeouf's best friend in the movie, Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) is our Thelma Ritter. Of course the obviously fault with the film, when compared to the work of Hitchcock is, the movie isn't nearly as suspenseful or well crafted.

 ""Disturbia"" suffers from two problems. Number one it goes for cheap scares. It follows the basic formula most thrillers follow and because of that it leads us to our second problem. The movie is predictable. We know Mr. Turner is going to be the killer and Kale was right all along if for any reason, does it seem logical for a movie to take us down this path, build up all this ""suspense"", devote so much time to this idea, and then suddenly it turns out not to be Mr. Turner? Also, what other suspects does Kale have? So, since all the chips are placed on Mr. Turner being the killer, it simply must be.

 So okay, right now you are saying, well you know what moron, when I saw ""Rear Window"" I knew Raymond Bur was the killer. Here's the difference. Since we know how the film is going to turn out, the only thing which will keep our interest will be the characters. It's all we have left. Unless the film is smartly written and strongly acted we have no reason to continue watching. And that is where ""Disturbia"" goes wrong. I didn't care about these characters. Whether they live or die had no impact on me. I was never fully involved in what was going on.

 Shia LaBeouf seems to be getting a lot of work lately. He has already created a persona for himself. In nearly every film he is in he plays the same character. The geeky, well meaning, loser who lust after the pretty girl who doesn't notice him. In his world he think he is cool, to the rest of us, he is out of touch. Watch him in ""I, Robot"" or ""Transformers"" and you will see what I mean. I'm not saying LaBeouf has no talent. He does, but just like any other actor, he needs a good script. His persona worked in other films, but here he doesn't seem compelling on-screen.

 The rest of the cast actually out shines LaBeouf. Supporting players like Roemer and Yoo are far more interesting to watch. Yoo is given better jokes and Roemer is simply better looking than LaBeouf so my eyes tended to follow her more when the two were both in a scene together.

 The film was directed by D.J. Caruso. Caruso is a good director. A few years ago he directed a Val Kilmer movie called ""The Salton Sea"". It was a truly great film. He followed it up with an Angelina Jolie thriller, ""Taking Lives"", which I didn't like. But Caruso has talent. He can direct a scene and know how to get the most from his characters as was the case with Kilmer and Jolie. But what hurts him here is the script. Carl Ellsworth co-wrote the film, and even he too has done better. He wrote the thriller ""Red Eye"" which worked much better. That film had interesting characters and had a few suspenseful moments.

 ""Disturbia"" may have a nice look to some but really isn't a very engaging picture. The cast and director are both talented but there is little anyone could do with this weak script.

 Bottom-line: An Alfred Hitchcock knock-off that isn't anywhere near as suspenseful as the master's films. Good cast and director but the weak script brings everything to a halt.",1186876800,6,4897,4.532349602724177

I'm the world's biggest Hitchcock fan, and well past my adolescent years, so I wasn't expecting a lot from a new flick that every critic in America said was ""REAR WINDOW with teens."" But this film actually works on its own merits, and the chief merit is Shia LaBeouf. I haven't been this impressed with a new talent since I saw Keisha Castle-Hughes in WHALE RIDER, or when I saw 15-year-old Matthew Broderick in the Broadway play, BRIGHTON BEACH MEMOIRS, some 25 years ago. This Shia guy is the real deal, and I have a feeling DISTURBIA will go down in the books as the film that really broke him out to a long, high-profile career.

Older folks, take note: This is not your average ""teen thriller,"" nor is it a simple ripoff of Hitchcock. It is a clever,  exciting new entity, expertly directed by D. J. Caruso. And the young lead is a perfect combination of Jimmy Stewart in REAR WINDOW (in the first 75 minutes) and Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (in the final 30 minutes), and every bit as good as both of them.

7596210,4,B01A9LM9B2,"DISTURBIA  is a fine little thriller of a movie. Though some viewers are commenting that it is merely a takeoff on REAR WINDOW and finding it not up to that caliber - and if that bothers potential viewers then be advised, for this viewer it is more a film that addresses our progressive invasion of privacy by high tech instruments, and as such the film makes an important statement.  Writers Christopher Landon and Carl Ellsworth have produced a solid script that manages to capture teenage angst and view of the world and with director D.J. Caruso the story is propelled along with a hold-your-breath pace that makes for a very entertaining and scary movie!

Kale (a very fine Shia LaBeouf) had  a great relationship with his father (Matt Craven), but in a hideous auto accident Kale witnesses the death of his father, an event that disturbs him so greatly even a year later that he misbehaves in school and eventually is put under house arrest wearing an alarm bracelet on his ankle.  Kale's mother (Carrie-Anne Moss) tries to cope with the 'incarcerated' Kale, but tires of his aimless wasting of time and energy. Out of boredom Kale stares out his windows with binoculars, observing the neighbors, not the least of which is an attractive young Ashley (Sarah Roemer). Kale's best friend  Ronnie (a very promising Aaron Yoo) is Kale's only contact with the outside world and when the two boys spy on Ashley in her swimming pool, they together find more sophisticated means of voyeurism.  And, once Ashley visits Kale the three join in spying on a strange neighbor Mr. Turner (David Morse), finding him similar to a media-described serial killer.  From there the plot thickens and quickens as the threesome made dangerous discoveries and end up in an investigation of scary proportions.

The final fifteen minutes of the film are a bit over-the-top, but the rest of the movie is so well done that the ending can be forgiven.  There are some fine cameo roles by Viola Davis as the detective in charge of Kale's house arrest,  Jose Pablo Cantillo as officer who is stuck with responding to Kale's multiple infringements of his house arrest, among others. Shia LaBeouf is young in his craft but demonstrates a fine screen presence and a lot of polish: he carries the movie well.  This is not a major film (though it did very well at the box office!), but is a surefire entertainment!  Grady Harp, August 07",1186617600,,2405,4.766265060240964

The storyline of ""Disturbia"", familiar though it may be, is entertaining enough.  For film buffs, and especially horror film fans, there is another entire dimension to the movie in the form of brief ""revisits"" to other classic horror and suspense films.  You'll find bits of ""The Ring"", ""The Shining"", ""The Blair Witch Project"", ""Seven"", ""Saw"", ""Psycho"", and a host of others.  I was left wondering whether the director managed a Hitchcockian cameo appearance, but alas, have no idea what he looks like.

His hot new neighbor Ashley (Sarah Roemer)  has a feeling he's watching her but chooses to join in and spy on a neighbor that Kale thinks might be the neighborhood woman snatcher. David Morse (16 Blocks) plays that neighbor perfectly since he never plays it as if Kale might actually be wrong about him. He's pretty weird and creepy and doesn't try to get us to like him.

  The movie reminds me of other movies such as Rear Window and even Monster House. Rear Window with of course a man stuck in his house with nothing better to do but spy on neighbors. But Monster House with how the 2 friends are watching a house nextdoor and the girl they both think is cute comes over and becomes their friend.

It was too dark to see what was going on in the basement. If this was an intended technique, it really didn't work with me. Who was killing who with what weapon and... what the hell just happened? It was funny when it didn't intend to be. When the lead character was zooming in on the still video image his Korean friend had caught, parallel to his mom leaving the neighbor's house, was very suspenseful and a great climatic scene because it answered all questions you had throughout the movie... but as the rest...just plain cheesy. Don't get me wrong, it is still worth watching for some odd cheesy value. Something was missing. It lacked the intensity of a great suspense thriller probably because of its silliness.

It's ""Rear Window"" with a few other conventions tossed in.

One, you could run straight to the murderer's house where you thought your mom was held hostage to rescue her. Two, you could run to your neighbor's house to call police for help. What do you think a ""normal"" kid will do? The main character in this film selected choice number one. Not only he was able to free his mom, he also managed to kill the murderer too! Yeah right!

I felt that the neighbor's part should have gone to an actor who was more ordinary, reasonably attractive perhaps (think Mark Harmon playing Ted Bundy). There were some laugh-out-loud moments, where teenage boys were accurately and hilariously portrayed by the main character and his best bud.

Still, this movie suffers from a case of celluloid schizophrenia worse than any I have seen in a long while. It begins as a sort-of Lifetime for Teens after-school special as the film focuses on a young man's inability to grieve for his lost father and his consequential misbehaviors that run him afoul his school and the law. Transition now to teen comedy, as Shia and company (his plucky, funny, o-so-stereotypical Asian friend and his up-and-coming swimsuit model girlfriend with a brain and a heart) play ""Let's spy on the neighbors,"" to break the monotony of his house arrest. Only in the second half does the thriller aspect of this movie emerge. You have to survive the silliness to get there, but when you do, there's a good movie here. And worth the wait.

  Directed by DJ Caruso, this movie is a thriller that has you at the edge of your seat. Shia LaBeouf (Kale Brecht) plays a teenager that pops his Spanish teacher and then is on house-arrest for 90 days.

I did like the actors and actresses that were in it.  Catherine Moss, I mean she kicked soooooo much booty in the Matrix so we reallllllllly cannot go wrong having her in the film.

*********Spoiler Alert***************

Ahem...okay people there are some things we need to realize here, and one is how law enforcement handles these things.  ""These things"" you ask me, what are these things?  These things are like how the cops handled the bag in the garage scene.  Okay that was even on the previews so I am not giving too much away there so gimme some credit!  So, the first part is handled good but after the driveway/discovery scene...no.  Sorry people but you cannot have anything like that on the premises and it would be brought into great question.  For one, that is a health hazard and it does not matter ""what"" it is, if it ain't breathing it needs to be in da ground.  Secondly, Mr Turner (the crazy neighbor) had an answer when asked the question...no he was not even asked he just immediately explained why how what where and so forth.  That explanation in itself would bring into great question just how messed up this guy is.  When something like that happens you place it outside of the roadway to avoid causing a traffic accident, and then call the local Fish and Game office in the local area.  You see they keep tabs on things like that, statistics ya know?

****************Spoiler Alert**********************

Allllllllrighty then!  Next up we have the way it finished up, starting with the visit by the kids mom.  Okay Why or how would Mr. Turner do that?  Well the movie would have you think he suspected someone was on to him.  The problem is with this, is that there was no way he knew that friend of the boy's even saw anything.  You saw the entire layout of the house, this guy would know if that kid was able to film something.  I guess in Mr. Turner's case it was better to be safe than sorry.

**************Spoiler Alert (it is okay, I Am almost done)**************

Awrighty friends, so the parking garage scene when the girl was leaving after following him to the hardware store.  Nope, sorry friends because as soon as that guy got into that vehicle and touched her she could have had him in a whole heapa (yes, HEAPA is a word, it means mega heaps or gigantic piles of) trouble and by the time he got out of jail his house would already have new people buying it from a foreclosure.  So, how did he fake out the scene with the call girl leaving?  I saw as you did, now c'mon did he really have that great of legs and a nice figure enough to be able to pose as her walking to the vehicle?  Of course not, those broad shoulders and thick legs, combined with some cord like forearms and a lumberjack's walk would have given him away in no time.  Sorry I cannot see that guy wearing high heels people.

7596224,3,B01A9LM9B2,"Ever watch a movie that you think will be terrible like the recent genre has been dishing out only to find it's actually...good? Well in Disturbia's case I wouldn't use the word ""good"" but considering the amount of bad horror/thriller films released lately, you're kind of surprised Disturbia's at least memorable. While it does have its flaws and spots of stupidness on some characters' part, it's fairly engaging if sort-of familiar thriller.

Kale Brecht is a 17 year old kid who loses his dad a year earlier when their vehicle gets into a pretty brutal car accident. Now, he's still pretty sore and emotionally turned off which doesn't help when his Spanish teacher makes a comment about his dad, prompting Kale to hit the guy. Instead of jail, he's put under house arrest with an electronic bracelet attached to his leg which alerts the police should he leave his yard.

Now completely bored since his mom cancelled his iTunes and XBox-Live, he decides to start spying on some neighbours, including new hottie Ashley. But there's someone else in the neighborhood, namely Robert Turner who Kale believes is a serial killer. With the help of Ashley, his friend Ronnie and some high-tech gadgets, Kale tries to figure out whether his neighbor really is a wanted killer.

First off, it's nice to see a thriller actually develop characters and ideas rather than just go off to the races and start amping up the tension. While it doesn't really work because the characters are still one note by the end of it, you still gotta appreciate a more slower opening. But that doesn't mean the characters are exempt from dumb ideas and illogical decisions. For instance, why put a camera on a car when you want to actually film something else, and then there's smaller stuff like why be bored because your X-Box is taken away yet not hook it up to a different TV? Or keep manipulating the camera to get better views when it's already hooked up to the TV. Or why he takes so long to figure out how far the safe distance is from the bracelet receiver?

The film though at least is a bit more active than its obvious spirit and homage to Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"". But whereas that film had an incapacitated James Stewart, Kale is more active and just as likable thanks to Shia Lebeouf who has that everyman quality without being that sort of too-bright-for-his-years wisdom most have. Everyone else is fine but no one particularly special. While David Morse seems the logical choice for the soft-spoken Mr. Turner, it seems like lazy casting since he's played shady characters before so there's not a lot of doubt on whether he really is the killer or not. Then we have a character, played by former Muchmusic VJ Amanda Walsh who practically disappears from the story and yet didn't contribute anything anyways. Why bother including her?

It's suspenseful and its certainly better than stuff like the Texas Chainsaw prequel and Saw III but taken on its own, it's a pretty good but not exceptional thriller.",1186444800,4,2995,4.774131274131274
7596225,3,B01A9LM9B2,"With a starring role in the new Transformers film and a significant role in the upcoming Indiana Jones installment, Shia LaBeouf is being groomed as the next big thing. He made Disturbia just before these blockbusters and this little thriller was a surprise success at the box office as audiences gravitated to what critics rightly labeled Rear Window for the new Millennium.

It's hard to assess LaBeouf's ability as an actor as he's not given much to work with. The script is merely serviceable with thinly-sketched characters and clichd dialogue. Veteran actor David Morse does the best job with the material as he oozes genial, soft-spoken menace in every scene. He wisely adheres to the less-is-more school of acting. Carrie-Anne Moss gets the thankless role of the mother who has to show her delinquent son some tough love while making friends with the next-door neighbour psycho. Her bland character makes one long for her sexy freedom fighter in The Matrix films.

Like David Lynch's Blue Velvet, Disturbia explores the dark underbelly that exists under the sunny facade of contemporary suburbia with LaBeouf as the amateur detective/voyeur, Morse as the evil psychopath and Sarah Roemer as the wholesome but not too wholesome girl-next-door. This film also evokes Brian De Palma's Body Double, a thriller about voyeurism and murder but unlike both of these films; it doesn't have the content or the style to separate itself from your average thriller.

Director D.J. Caruso tries to keep things interesting visually but he's kept in check by a PG-13 rating, essentially making Rear Window for teens. It's a change from his usual adult fare (Taking Lives and Two for the Money) but not in a good way. Disturbia falls back on tired clichs that we've seen a million times before, like the bad guy who feels the need to explain himself instead of killing off the hero thereby buying just enough time for the protagonist to regain the advantage. That's just sloppy, lazy screenwriting, folks.

There is an audio commentary by director D.J. Caruso and actors Shia LaBeouf and Sarah Roemer. Caruso answers a call from his wife early on to take an order of stuff to pick up afterwards which kinda sets the tone for this track. I mean, c'mon! At least have the forethought to turn off your phone beforehand. It is this lack of commitment which, in turn, makes you not really care about what's being said...which ain't much in all truthfulness. Avoid at all costs.

Also included are four deleted scenes that flesh out Kale's relationship with his mother and builds on the tension that exists between them. The other scene features a bit between Kale and his best friend that was rightly cut.

""The Making of Disturbia"" is your pretty standard featurette as the cast and crew gush about one another. Caruso says that he wanted to make a John Cusack romantic comedy mixed with a thriller (?!). He also wanted to explore the nature of voyeurism with the advent of contemporary technology.

""Serial Pursuit Trivia Pop-Up Quiz"" allows you to watch the film with a subtitled trivia track which is a nice added feature that helps distract you from what's happening in the film.

There is brief ""Outtakes"" reel that features some goofy improvisation in the scene where Kale and his dad go fly fishing.

There is a music video for ""Don't Make Me Wait"" by This World Fair that mixes footage of the band playing with clips from the movie.

Also included is a ""Photo Gallery"" with promotional stills and behind-the-scenes photographs.

Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.",1186358400,10,3563,4.911813643926789
7596226,3,B01A9LM9B2,"I liked this film, I would've given it 4 stars instead of 3 had it not been for the tone of the first half of the movie.

The first 51% of the movie spends so much unnecessary time focusing on the theme of ""angst-ridden, misunderstood teen meets the attractive, slightly eccentric, rebellious girl, who is seemingly part of the 'normal' crowd, yet is introspective and ordinary enough to understand and befriend that teen, who she becomes romantically interested in, afterall, what other outcome could there possibly be when two people like this meet each other."" Does that sound like the beginning to a suspense/thriller, or a melodrama like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Garden-State/dp/B00005JNC2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Garden State</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-United-States-of-Leland/dp/B0002I8372/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The United States of Leland</a>?

On top of that, they made the first half of the movie a comedy. There's nothing wrong with any of these elements, but they didn't belong here. They should've used all that time to build suspense and intrigue, instead they put so much time into painting a very very detailed picture of his life (which is usually a good thing), and his relationship with the girl. What was the payoff in that? She played ZERO role in the finals acts of the film. See what I mean about wasted screen time? By the time they started focusing more on the key aspects (the neighbor), half the movie was over.",1186272000,2,1560,5.837719298245614
7596227,4,B01A9LM9B2,"Remember how much fun it is to watch all the eccentricities of your bizarre neighbors? Well if you can't, Disturbia will have a whole new generation peering out their windows, keeping a neighborhood watch on all of that suburban madness.

Like Rear Window and The Burbs before it, Disturbia is a whodunit mystery that mixes humor, action and suspense when a group of obsessive neighbors believe that one of the local residents has been murdering beautiful girls in the night.

Is it just their imaginations playing tricks on them or is a cold blooded killer really lurking next door? That is the question that director D.J. Caruso poses for the audience in this Hitchockian thriller. As Shia LaBeouf, the young star of Disturbia, falls into a panicked state of paranoia, so does the audience, allowing Caruso to capitalize on every bit of tension. While Caruso's previous efforts like Taking Lives and Two for the Money have been relatively bland and unsuccessful, thrills and chills seems to be an area the director succeeds in, accomplishing quite a few big scares with very little blood and violence.

While parts of Disturbia certainly suggest the twisted horrors of gross out, exploitation flicks like Hostel and the Saw series, it successfully brings these concepts home to the eerie calm of suburbia without the over-the-top gore. Disturbia is all about tension, and rendering the film's lead character helpless within his home, under house arrest, is an ingenious update to the broken leg which kept the hero of Rear Window dependent on the investigation skills of others.

While Disturbia seems to provide the role that will finally free LaBeouf of his Disney Channel past, it is the remainder of the film's young cast, Sarah Roemer and Aaron Yoo that share some of the budding star's spotlight. Though Aaron Yoo provides some great comic relief, and ""perhaps"" one of the best jump scares in the whole movie, it is the young, summer romance between Labeouf and Roemer that really gives the film a much needed credibility boost that separates it from other teeny bopper, horror pictures.

When the mostly bikini clad, girl next door tempts LaBeouf with a kiss just outside of his house arrest perimeter, you can't help but feel teased too. When the duo finally does make their romantic connection it is a classic example of a slow build relationship coming together in an example of an iconic on screen kiss, perhaps the best between two young actors since The Girl Next Door.

In an era where remakes and PG-13 horror films rarely ever meet even the lowest of expectations, Disturbia is a picture that defies these conventions. It is scary without being trite. It is funny without being campy. Most importantly, it doesn't damper Hitchcock's original concept. Disturbia lovingly updates the story for the Ipod generation to enjoy. Just when we thought it was safe to enjoy suburban life again, Caruso reminds audiences just how weird and exciting the mundane can truly be. Who needs high concept pictures when every day life can be so terrifying?

Lets face it, ""Disturbia"" may be updated, but its characters are just over used anechdotes of the failed horror movies of today. 16 year-old underdog, sexy girl, mother who doesn't believe boy til end and of course the killer.

Now lets observe the differences critics should consider:

Lead Male Character:

Kale-a boy who is under house arrest for PUNCHING OUT HIS TEACHER. If I'm correct, that would never happen in reality. He spies on the girl next door because his mommy takes away his toys.

Jeff-a photographer with a broken leg, has limited mobility after an accident on assignment. He can't do anything except eat, drink, be with his girlfriend and watch the neighbors. Much more believeable

Lead Female Character:

Ashley-A girl who lives next door to Kale and feels attracted to him when she catches him watching her strip. CREEPY. She easily believes Kale when he says his neighbor is a serial killer and follows him all the way.

Lisa-A sophisticated model who loves Jeff and would go with him to a jungle if he were assigned to go there. She detests his voyeurism and wants him to marry her. She doesn't believe Jeff about the neighbor Mr. Thorwald at first until she notices something that the cops just shrug off, he has her jewelry. ""Why would she just leave her jewelry if she is going on a trip?"" She has strength of her own because she is Jeff's access into Mr. Thorwald's house.

The Killer:

Mr. Thorwald-A salesman who is married and after he kills his wife because of an affair he is having and his wife's nagging. He shows no obvious signs of the murder he has commited and he does his best to hide every shred of evidence against him, including his wife.

Mr. Turner-A neighbor who acts like a nice guy, but really isn't. He just killed a woman and left a dent in his car. A dent, Kale can see very easily as can we. Then he kills another woman in his home after he is being searched for and where Kale can see the murder taking place. He isn't exactly subtle or smart when it comes to hiding the proof that he did it. In fact it is so obvious that it makes the movie less suspenseful. What does he do, wait til someone finds out his secret and kills them. Then he's left with another murder to not clean up.

The story in ""Disturbia"" is just straight forward because we know everything and the film tries desperately to mirror Hitchcock. While ""Rear Window's"" story takes a while before everyone's convinced enough to try and catch the killer. It even comes to the point where the killer hides the evidence so well he has Jeff second-guessing his theory at one point.

8746756,5,B01A9LM9B2,"Four and a half OBSERVANT Stars. Disturbia is a young adult/adult dramedy about a teen who goes through a traumatic experience that evolves into him getting a court sentence and a home ankle monitor. He begins casually watching his neighbors, especially one particular house. When the film is good, its very good and humorous, but its about 15 minutes too long, which causes it to ramble a bit. The cast is superb and the direction Is first-rate. Starring Shia LeBeouf, David Morse, Sarah Roemer, Viola Davis, and Carre-Anne Moss, with Aaron Yoo, Jose Pablo Cantillo, Matt Craven, Brandon Caruso, Elyse Mirto, and more.  Directed by D. J. Caruso.
