8175361,1,B00083BAGC,"I bought this DVD because I wanted to see Eyes in the Night.  I saw it on TCM and never got to see the ending.  It is on this DVD along with 3 other old black and white mysteries.  IMPACT is a good and unusual mystery and I enjoyed it.  QUICKSAND was a pleasant surprise: Mickey Rooney, at about age 29, played a straight dramatic role in an interesting, rather fast-moving mystery. I don't remember him in anything but musicals and the Andy Hardy series, and I don't think that any actor could have done better in this dramatic role.

That is the last good thing I can say about this DVD.  The two other mysteries, EYES IN THE NIGHT and HE WALKED BY NIGHT were so dark that I couldn't see most of the scenes.  Perhaps it is just my copy, but I have rarely seen such unwatchable movies due to either no remastering or badly done ones.  On TCM, ""EYES"" was very clear and easy to watch and hear, so there must be a reason for such bad releases.

This DVD was released by Treeline Films.  I will never buy anything again from this company.  There is no excuse for such a botched item for sale.  I have only seen one other DVD that has absolutely no markings on the DVD itself, it is in a plain case with a loose paper around it as a label, and the 4 movies are on one disk with 2 on each side. I believe that the other very bad DVD was also by Treeline.

Pay more for a good copy of EYES IN THE NIGHT, which I really liked! Edward Arnold plays a blind detective with a trained German Shephard who solve a murder-mystery.",1357084800,,1517,4.119047619047619
8175362,4,B00083BAGC,"Passport Video presents ""THE ULTIMATE FILM NOIR"" (1945-1953), --- (Dolby digitally remastered) --- ten tantalizing tales of Film Noir on five suspenseful discs --- featuring top performances from the '40s and '50s with outstanding drama and screenplays, along with a wonderful cast and supporting actors to bring it all together ... another winner from the vaults of Film Noir Hollywood gems.

Film noir is a cinematic term used primarily to describe Hollywood crime dramas that set their protagonists in a world perceived as inherently corrupt and unsympathetic...Hollywood's classic film noir period is generally regarded as stretching from the early 1940s to the late 1950s...Film noir of this era is associated with a low-key black-and-white visual style that has roots in German Expressionist cinematography, while many of the prototypical stories and much of the attitude of classic noir derive from the hardboiled school of crime fiction that emerged in the United States during the Depression...the term film noir (French for ""black film""), first applied to Hollywood movies by French critic Nino Frank in 1946, was unknown to most of the American filmmakers and actors while they were creating the classic film noirs..the canon of film noir was defined in retrospect by film historians and critics; many of those involved in the making of film noir later professed to be unaware at the time of having created a distinctive type of film.

Five-disc collector's set includes ""SCARLET STREET"" (1945) (95 mins/Universal Pictures), featuring Edward G. Robinson, Joan Bennett, Dan Duryea and Margaret Lindsay --- ""DETOUR"" (1945) (67 mins/PRC), featuring Tom Neal, Ann Savage, Claudia Drake and Edmund MacDonald --- ""THE STRANGE LOVE OF MARTHA IVERS"" (1946) (117 mins/Paramount Pictures), featuring Barbara Stanwyck, Van Heflin, Kirk Douglas, Lizabeth Scott and Judith Anderson --- ""WHISTLE STOP"" (1946) (85 mins/United Artists) featuring George Raft, Ava Gardner, Victor McLaglen, Tom Conway and Jorja Curtright --- ""HE WALKED BY NIGHT"" (1948) (80 mins/Eagle-Lion), featuring Richard Basehart, Scott Brady, Jack Webb, Roy Roberts, Whit Bissell and James B. Cardwll --- ""TRAPPED"" (1949) (78 mins/Bryan Foy Productions / Eagle-Lion), featuring Lloyd Bridges, Barbara Payton, John Hoyt, Russ Conway and James Todd --- ""IMPACT"" (1949) (83 mins/United Artists), featuring Brian Donlevy, Ella Raines, Charles Coburn and Helen Walker --- ""D.O.A."" (1950) (83 mins/United Artists), featuring Edmond O'Brien, Pamela Britton, Luther Adler and Beverly Campbell --- ""QUICKSAND"" )1950) (79 mins/Samuel Steifel Productions / United Artists), featuring Mickey Rooney, Jeannie Cagney, Peter Lorre and Barbara Bates --- ""THE HITCH-HIKER"" (1953) (71 mins/RKO Pictures), featuring Edmond O'Brien, Frank Lovejoy and William Talman --- and the documentary ""THE BEST OF FILM NOIR"".

Film noirs tend to revolve around heroes who are more flawed and morally questionable than the norm, often fall guys of one sort or another...the characteristic heroes of noir are described by many critics as ""alienated""; in the words of Silver and Ward, ""filled with existential bitterness.""...certain archetypal characters appear in many film noirs--hardboiled detectives, femmes fatales, corrupt policemen, jealous husbands, intrepid claims adjusters, and down-and-out writers...as can be observed in many movies of an overtly neo-noir nature, the private eye and the femme fatale are the character types with which film noir has come to be most identified, but a minority of movies now regarded as classic noir feature either...crime, usually murder, is an element of almost all film noirs; in addition to standard-issue greed, jealousy is frequently the criminal motivation...a crime investigation--by a private eye, a police detective (sometimes acting alone), or a concerned amateur--is the most prevalent, but far from dominant, basic plot...in other common plots the protagonists are implicated in heists or con games, or in murderous conspiracies often involving adulterous affairs...false suspicions and accusations of crime are frequent plot elements, as are betrayals and double-crosses...amnesia is far more common in film noir than in real life, and cigarette smoking can seem virtually mandatory.

This collection of ""The Ultimate Film Noir"" (1945-1953) --- still has the magic that we remember from those bygone years --- but as long as we have the labels and networks who play and show these wonderful films of yesteryear, they will never be forgotten --- plus the Bonus of Best of Film Noir on the final disc --- and a great job by Passport Video for this release --- looking forward to more of the same from the '40s and '50s vintage...order your copy now from Amazon or Passport Video, stay tuned once again for more remarkable films from the vaults of classic television and Hollywood during the Golden Era of Film Noir --- All My Heroes have been Gumshoe Detectives!
