8534243,1,B0091JJ2GY,"I love the Velvets, and Cale and Reed solo, but this is a really terrible product.  Bootleg quality footage from Bataclan, has audio dropouts, and only runs 20 minutes.  Actually, so little care was put into this, that they couldn't even get the track order correct, because Femme Fatale is on the dvd twice, and the cover art is even wrong/deceptive (wrong year, whole band?).  Also, there are some serious synch issues in spots.  Where is the rest of the footage from this show?  You'd be better off avoiding this entirely, and getting either Lou Reed's Schnabel ""Berlin"" dvd or the Cale 2DVD set from Rockpalast.",1366070400,,615,4.764150943396227
8534244,1,B0091JJ2GY,Quality is terrible.  The music/singing doesn't  line up with the music...running time incorrect as parts are repeated ... Not worth the money...more a curiosity piece...,1360972800,,170,5.76
8534245,2,B0091JJ2GY,It is for collectors and big fans like me only. There are only five songs and the quality is poor.,1356220800,8,98,3.95
8534246,1,B0091JJ2GY,"The description says that the DVD is 41 minutes. In reality it is 21 minutes, and is the same material that you can see on Youtube, sloppily thrown together on a disc, with no added value. Avoid.",1355270400,11,195,4.297297297297297
8534247,4,B0091JJ2GY,If you are a VU fan you will want to have this dvd be warned however Waiting For The Man goes in and out of sync. The audio is clear the video looks more vhs than dvd but all in all I think Its great.,1353628800,4,200,3.466666666666667
