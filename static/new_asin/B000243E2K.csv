2060818,2,B000243E2K,"This is BSG the second season from the early 1980s.  The show was brought back because of popular demand and a chance to cash in on Star Wars Hype.  The fist season is B Grade cheesy fun but this season is barely watch-able.  All that time to get to earth and this is the crap we got.

The new BSG is far better than these originals.  The new series achieved the potential we all new BSG had in it.

It is till worth a look.  Have a look at The Shape of things to Come if you like this.",1190592000,2,486,3.8484848484848486
2060819,5,B000243E2K,"After the advent of what Ronald D. Moore tried to pass off as Battlestar Galactica, hindsight is casting a more favorable light on Galactica: 1980. With Ronald D. Moore failing to cast aside his Star Trek training wheels when tackling a project called Battlestar Galactica, he has earned the merit badge of having created the worst incarnation of Battlestar Galactica ever. Star Trek with the Iraq War and Soap Opera cliches thrown into an embarrassing mix.

This has elevated Galactica: 1980 to an enjoyable and canon version of Battlestar Galactica. There is more imagination in the first five minutes of Galactica: 1980, than there is in Ronald D. Moore's entire career. Kent McCord and Barry Van Dyke make enjoyable and credible leading men as Troy and Dillon, as they chase after a renegade council member known as Xavier who turned evil. Lighter moments are provided with children from the fleet, who could have provided a stronger anchor for the series had their parts been better written. Robyn Douglass makes an attractive co-star and is credible in her role as well. Like Battlestar Galactica before it, Galactica: 1980 could have been much better had there been no network interference in the script. All of the Fun Galactica gadgets are here, with the addition of flying motorcycles called Land Probes which were planned for an actual episode of Battlestar Galactica. They were obviously built at the time of the series cancellation, and saved for Galactica: 1980.

The first episode delivers wonderful ideas, including a cool set-up of following Xavier through time, highlighted by a supposedly filmed episode of Xavier romancing Cleopatra in her own time. Like Battlestar Galactica, Galactica: 1980 didn't have the opportunity to truly become a water cooler discussion series, because ABC-TV wouldn't let it. What we have in the 6 episode collection of Galactica: 1980, is some wonderful ideas spread throughout the six scripts, interspersed with cheesy moments and other unnecessary nonsense that was the mandate of commercial broadcast television at the time. Galactica: 1980 is more entertaining and fun to watch than Ronald D. Moore's series, and anything else on television right now. In hindsight, this series is alot better than how people remember it, and is aging better than how most Science Fiction television
series tend to age.",1190419200,8,2354,5.175853018372703

2060822,5,B000243E2K,"This is an excellent little ending to Galactica 1980, one of the worst sci-fi series ever made. It ties up the loose knot of what happened to Starbuck, and even the Dr. Zee character(Starbuck's son) was mildly likeable...for once. I didn't become a Battlestar Galactica fan until after realizing the importance of religion, and it was good to see the author of the script, Glen Larson, adding a spiritual character to this final episode, thus keeping true to the spiritual core of his saga (even if his theology doesn't match mine).",1090368000,6,532,4.857142857142857

2060853,3,B000243E2K,"Imagine if the original Trek was given a fourth season, but due to budget cuts the Enterprise was back on Earth in 1970.  Kirk has a beard and Scotty is in some scenes but most of the, uh, action is on Earth with a couple of redshirts who go around mostly encountering bad acting, cringe-worthy kids, discarded A-Team or Scooby-Doo plots (the evil robot is loose on Halloween! The Galactica kids have super powers! The evil land owner has built a dam!).  I saw this first when it came out when I was 10 and I thought it was weird then and it hasn't really gotten any better.

Still, there are several things I actually like about it.  The flying motorcycles (yeah yeah but still), the two-seater vipers, the Galactica UFO ship, the new human-looking Cylons and the time-warp elements.  Honestly if Glen Larson had continued the plot of the first three episodes, where evil Galactican Xavier goes back in Earth's past and Troy and Dillon try to stop him, well you basically have the plot of Timeless then, and that would have been far more interesting than what we got.",1505347200,,1068,4.570680628272251

2060878,1,B000243E2K,"I just finished watching ""Battlestar Galactica"", and wanted to watch the further adventures of the crew I had grown to love.

What a mistake!!

""Galactica 1980"" is just awful. Almost every choice made is not only the wrong one, but it's completely toxic. The Cylons couldn't have conceived a more diabolical plan to destroy ""Galactica"" than this show. While I would say the original ""Battlestar Galactica"" aimed at capturing the young fans of ""Star Wars"", I honestly don't know who ""Galactica 1980"" was aimed for?

""Galactica 1980"" finds the Battlestar orbiting Earth, but fearing that they've lead the Cylons to the small planet they want to avoid being detected, so they send down Dick Van Dyke's son and the guy from ""Adam12"" to get into wacky adventures with flying motorcycles. Yes...really. Toss in some super kids that pop in and out of several episodes and this show is just a mess. To make it worse they aren't even stand-alone episodes, it's like a series of 3 episode story arcs. Almost everything fans of the original series enjoyed is absent from the new show.

I will say that the only redeeming episode of this show is the final episode where we discover the fate of ""Starbuck"" from the original series. But you don't need to watch the proceeding 9 episodes to enjoy that single show, so bypass picking up the entire series, and just seek out ""The Return of Starbuck"".",1477612800,,1383,4.7740585774058575

2060936,3,B000243E2K,"considering the once unique grandeur of the original Battlestar Galactica, it's not hard to see why this lagging attempt to follow it up has long been a favorite whipping-boy of so many critics and other ""experts."" it deftly demonstrates the perils of both low-budget sci-fi and the imperfect spin-off series. even it's handful of supporters have to admit that it just didn't measure up. (there are those who say it is noteworthy only because the three-part pilot's time-travel angle inspired producer Don Bellisario's later smash Quantum Leap.)
but i have to say, the extreme rancor strikes me as a textbook case of kicking someone when they're down. i mean after all, virtually none of the original cast made it back, and the budget was ruthlessly slashed by more than two thirds. so really, how much of the old magic did it ever have a chance to reestablish?
they did manage to devise a new premise that fits well with their new budget: this last outpost of the ""Colonies"" finally discovers Earth, only to find themselves with a whole new Sysiphian task in preparing an easily panicked society to accept and welcome them before they can reveal themselves. and because the Cylons have kept up with them, they too need to be kept at bay. between the two, Galctica's hands just might be the fullest they've ever been.
the major stumbling block is that the cast, which had to be almost completely rebuilt from scratch. Lorne ""Adama"" Greene and Herbert ""Boomer"" Jefferson are the only veterans they managed to rerecruit. this proves easy enough to explain by noting that several decades have elapsed. (apparently the original took place in the '40s or '50s.) it just might've worked if not for the highly unlikely conclusion that elder statesman Adama had somehow managed to outlive several dozen people in the so-called ""prime of life."" (one or two maybe, but his whole frickin' bridge crew?)
speaking of which, i wasn't quite right about that. Dirk Benedict was coaxed back for the final episode, ""The Return Of Starbuck."" a shipboard wunderkind psychic finds some wavelength where he can learn how Starbuck crash-landed on a desert planet along with the Cylon he was attempting to engage, and how the castaways have to learn to live together. it's nothing terribly revolutionary (it basically feels like a prototype for the film Enemy Mine), to say nothing of the fact that the absence of Richard Hatch's Apollo leaves a bit of a Tonto-without-The-Lone-Ranger aftertaste. but even so, it's easily the one most likely to entice fans of the first season to look into this one.
not that the new cast is exactly worthless. Kent McCord and Barry Van Dyke are as engaging a set of partners as any production has ever offered. granted, under the circumstances they feel not so much like a Luke Skywalker and Han Solo as a Sgt. Friday and Officer Gannon, but they nonetheless have the chemistry this sort of thing depends on. it's a shame their promising partnership was wasted on this dead-end rather than given a series of it's own.
and for what it's worth, my fellow Sherlock enthusiasts might like to know about a guest appearance from Jeremy Brett.
so basically, it's terrible when compared to with the majestic original season, but passable enough when judged on it's own merit.
to say nothing of the fact that it could be a whole lot worse - it could be sloppy enough to make Plan 9 From Outer Space look like a Spielberg production - and still beat the hell out of the dreadful ""reboot"" series of the 2000-aughts. (not much of a distinction i grant you, but sometimes ya gotta take what you can get.)",1451174400,,3601,4.790996784565916

I loved the original series, but this falls far short of what was done there. For the completist and Galactaca enthusiast, this is priced right to add to your collection. The only eposide I fully enjoyed was the last one - The Return of Starbuck. How he wins over a Cylon warrior and the companionship that results is inspired. There are good parts to the other episodes as well, but on the whole they don't really satisfy the hardcore Galactica fan.

2061106,3,B000243E2K,"I am surprising myself here by taking up a lance - a blaster? - in defense of GALACTICA 80, one of the most reviled shows in the history of television and for the last 35 years a source of continuous irritation to fans of the original, classic series. Let me start with a full disclosure: I grew up watching GALACTICA (`78) and loved it, and like every other kid of my generation was delighted that they were bringing it back...at least until I saw the first few episodes of 80. My reaction, and the reaction of all my friends, went more or less as follows:

""What the hell IS this? Where is Starbuck? Where is Apollo? Where are Balthar, Cassie, Athena, Sheba, Tigh, Jolly, and in fact just about the entire cast? Where are the big space battles? The alien planets? The huge numbers of extras and lavish sets? What happened to the `wagon train in space' format? Who are these stupid space kids? Who is this wretched idiot Dr. Z and why is Adama taking orders from him? Why is Wolfman Jack here? AND WHY FOR THE LOVE OF THE LORDS OF KOBOL ARE THE PLOTS ABOUT WATER POLLUTION AND FARMING? THIS IS MORE LIKE ""QUINCY"" THAN BATTLESTAR GALACTICA!""

I'm now 41 years old and my reaction is basically the same. From the bloodygodawful disco-ized version of the original musical score to the painfully stupid idea of taking an action-oriented syfy series and turning it into a kind of CBS after-school special about social and environmental issues, GALACTICA 80 is in many ways excruciating. Minus Richard Hatch and Dirk Benedict, minus Cylons (mostly) and base-ships, minus the cool suede uniforms and hot women....minus well, just about everything and everyone... calling this GALACTICA amounted to a cynical act of fraud. And if you look at this series as ""Season Two"" or even a continuation of the original, it will scald your eyeballs, pierce your soul and inflict S.B.I. on your inner child.

But here's the thing. GALACTICA 80 can be enjoyed. Really. Truly. It can. I'm not kidding. The trick is (drum roll)...you have to forget that the original series existed.

That's it. Just forget BATTLESTAR GALACTICA ever graced the airwaves and enjoying GALACTICA 80, even if it's only on the level of camp, kitsch (and, perhaps, cautionary tale) is possible. How do I know this? I just watched the entire series on a whim and, after I controlled the initial gag-reflex, surprised myself by finding it mildly entertaining if dragged out of the shadow of its unwilling parent.  It's really nothing but a kind of half-intentional comedy with some dramatic elements thrown in, a kind of PROJECT U.F.O. crossed with QUINCY and THE HULK. Dillion (Barry Van Dyke) and Troy (Kent McCord) are clueless foils stumbling over human society, herding annoying super-children before them, and occasionally having semi-cool adventures while encountering Nazis, evil businessmen, and the all-too-occasional Cylon. If you even for a moment remember the original series you will suffer a kind of vertigo and be tempted to barf, but that as I said is the trick. FORGET the o.s. entirely, and - here's the trickier part of the trick - don't watch the best episode, ""The Return of Starbuck"" at all. Save that for when you binge on the real Galactica and then pretend, through slight use of the fast-forward, that it belongs to that series instead. Because it is the only one, thanks to the appearances of Dirk Benedict and Herbert Jefferson (Boomer), which has the o.s. feel.

Now, BG-80 lasted only ten episodes, and several of them are beyond redemption. The opening half of ""Galactica Discovers Earth"" feels like a student film shot on the decayed remnants of the orginal set, ""Spaceball"" is an unintentional joke, there is a sequence involving the brat-kids in ""Space Croppers"" which is unendurable, and some of ""The Night The Cylons Landed"" is so dumb (Wolfman Jack is an integral part of the plot...sigh...) as to be almost beyond human ken. What's worse, Lorne Greene (Adama) has to play second-fiddle to the odious Dr. Z, one of the worst characters in the history of television (does anyone else want to see the Cylons slaughter him?), which robs the series of any dignity it might have possessed. Yet it's also undeniable that the seeds of other, more successful shows were planted here, including QUANTUM LEAP, THE A-TEAM, and even the reboot of GALACTCA (what with its human Cylons). So even if you can't enjoy this failed experiment for its own sake, you can feel slight gratitude that it may have inspired better series which followed.

Human cylons are introduced in this show, and the potential for the show being a thriller is great as the Galactica finds Earth and humans are not so advanced.

In 1979, the original show was canceled, but was so popular that a write-in campaign compelled the network to revive the show.  (Sad fact:  A young viewer also committed suicide over the show's cancellation.)

Unfortunately, the revived show's content shows too many of the episodes are geared to 5 year-olds and with a hyped up sense of melodrama that wouldn't convince 5 year-olds.  It's as if the network was planning on destroying the show.  From the 3-part premiere (featuring Robert Reed delivering dialogue that was a magnitude worse than any Brady Bunch episode), to the human cylon episode that felt like a pointless Halloween party special where all the guest stars were in costume, probably to hide their true selves.

Had G:1980 been given the same feel as the first season, it would have held up better.  But even in 1980, critics passed on this revival.

2061165,5,B000243E2K,"Even though I was a big enthusiast of the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy, somehow ""Battlestar Galactica"" got by me.

Now my nine year old son is a huge ""Star Wars"" fan, so I bought him ""Galactica 1980"" not quite knowing that it was a very different series than the original 1978 series.

As I'm skimming through the reviews here, I'm seeing that quite a few fans of the original 1978 series feel quite strongly that the 1980 continuation or ""spin-off"" did not do justice to the original. Of course, having never actually watched the original, I can't comment on that point, one way or another.

I will say this though: my nine year old son LOVES this series. Despite the strong feelings being expressed here, it should be noted that ""Galactica 1980"" was obviously created with children in mind.

Along this line, kids like my son, who like ""Star Wars"", airplanes, cars, scouting and so forth; will get a kick out of flying motorcycles, space ships, robots and ""super scouts"". The story lines are fun and innocent. Parents needn't worry about foul language, scantily clad women or violence.

For me, it's also a treat to see Lorne Green of ""Bonanza"" fame in another fatherly role; as ""Captain Adama"" is somewhat along the lines of ""Ben Cartwright"", except in outer space instead of the Old West.

The first nine episodes concern two guys from outer space named ""Troy"" and ""Dylan"" and their wacky Earth-bound adventures. Meanwhile ""Captain Adama"" and ""Doctor Z"" remain on the space ship, but stay in contact with ""Troy"" and ""Dylan"" to give them advice and to occasionally help them. The tenth and final episode is a departure from the format and takes place on an unknown desert planet, and it concerns a different character named ""Starbuck"" who, I guess, resumed his role from the original 1978 series.

As noted by others, the final episode, ""The Return of Starbuck"", is actually quite profound.

Here again, I'm reviewing this series based upon not having a great deal of familiarity with the 1978 series or the remake from the early 2000s.",1386633600,,2039,4.789173789173789

2061189,1,B000243E2K,"I loved Battlestar Galactica as a child; however, Galactica 1980 is horrible with the exception of the last episode which stars Dirk Benedict as Starbuck.  The acting is horrible, the story arc is all over the place and there are big gaping holes in episodes.  (For instance in one episode a professor is being held at gun point in the daytime.  Our heroes are racing off to save him.  The next frame shows the professor safely in a car with Air Force personnel and our heroes standing outside a fence at night.  Missing scene???)  The storyline is that our wandering travelers have finally found that shining planet known as Earth.  The problem is the Cylons have been following them the whole time and are in danger of finding  it as well.  The first three episodes are part of the premiere.  In it a grown up Boxy (now known as Troy, Boxy was apparently a nickname) and Dillon go down to Earth to chase Xavier (a fellow Galactican) who is trying to speed up Earth's technology by giving superior firepower to the Nazis.  Yes, time travel is introduced.  Too bad they couldn't go back through time and bring back my beloved Apollo.  They never do explain what happened to him; we are left to presume he is dead since Boxy is looking at a picture of him and his mother in the beginning of the first episode.  After three episodes, the time travelling is dumped and Troy and Dillon end up taking a group of children to Earth.  They have the capability to jump higher than average Earth children due to the different atmosphere.  This comes in useful when they have to play a baseball game to save a camp or sew seeds to save a farm in later episodes.  *roll eyes*  We constantly see Troy, Dillon and the children making themselves disappear due to some new technology.  This and the flying motorcycles Troy and Dillon drive/fly gets old really fast for me.  As if all that weren't bad enough, Adama, is now told what to do by a kid named Dr. Zee.  It is like they removed his brain when they put that awful beard on him.  No one else from the original series exists besides Adama and Boomer, who is now a commander.  Adama makes some mention of those that have not survived the journey at the beginning of this series.  Apparently no one survived save him and Boomer.  There is no mention of Sheba, Bojay, Jolly, Col. Tigh, Apollo, Greenbean, Cassie, Boltar, either of the doctors or anyone else from the original.  This series is probably supposed to be about 15-20 in the future based on Boxy's age and they supposedly hadn't encountered Cylon attacks in years, so where did everybody go?  We did see Ana Alicia in an episode, but not has her character from the original.  She played the daughter of a farmer on Earth.  Starbuck's absence is explained in the final episode.  I would suggest you save your money and search for the final episode ""The Return of Starbuck"" online.  I wish I had.",1375401600,2,2893,4.5163776493256265

This second round of the original BG made the first series look good. This is so bad that it verges on being a classic, an object lesson on how not to make a SF TV series. Laughable sets, terrible acting, corny plot lines, it had the lot. We won't even consider the silly Dr. Zee... I think I survived about four episodes before I could no longer stand it.

Like many others the best show was the last one. The 'Return of Starbuck' was a very good story and explained the origin of Dr. Z. I wish more of the shows could have been like this one and not so campy.

At the time, I thought it was the biggest abomination out there, and an insult to fans.  That was the mind of a 10-year-old.

Having tried to get into the 2003 remake, I could see what RDM was trying to do with the human cylons.  I actually LIKED that episode of Galactica 1980.  Human cylons, Wolfman Jack... hey what nore could a guy ask for?

2061290,3,B000243E2K,"J. McDonald is absolutely correct that the final episode in this two disc set is ""The Return of Starbuck"".  Despite criticisms from fans of Battlestar Galactica (BSG), this series (contrary to the box, it is not the ""final season"" of Battlestar Galactica, but more of a ""continuation"") is not bad at all.  The problem with it being a separate series is that with the budget slashed from the original BSG, they trimmed the cast down to four regulars (the four seen on the box), with the highest paid one being Lorne Greene (also the only one from the original series to be in all of the episodes of this ""sequel"" series).

The show follows the former ""Boxey"" from the original series (now called ""Troy"") and Dillon, as they land on Earth and attempt to advance civilisation enough so that the planet can help the Galactica and their crew defend against the menace of the Cylons.  They are assisted in their quest by Commander Adama from the original series (Greene) and child genius, Dr. Zee.

The thin packaging won't take up much room on your shelf, and many of the episodes are written quite well.  If you're a fan of the original BSG, and are expecting it to be similar, it's not, but if you take ""Galactica 1980"" on its own, it's a very nice series.

Skipping ahead to ""The Return of Starbuck"" won't hurt your enjoyment in terms of the continuity of the series, either, so feel free to watch that episode first.  It's probably the episode that best ties in ""Galactica 1980"" with the original series.  It's also vastly better than the remake.",1343606400,,1545,4.609489051094891

Granted, for anyone fond of the old show, as corny as it seems to get with every passing year, it was nice to see the old Galactica and some familiar faces, nostalgic to lament the long lost Starbuck and friends whose memory has had years to fade for the aged and weary Adama. But that's about it. The new faces make a valiant attempt, but trapped in this reboot they really stay in same the old rut.  It's set mostly in our real life 1980 earth, so there is no new science or fiction, very little we were not already aware of at the time. It you saw the old show, loved the new show, and consider yourself a BSG fan, go ahead and watch this.

2061294,4,B000243E2K,"This is the only episode of the 2nd and short season of Battlestar Galactica available on VHS. The episode tells the story of what may have happened to Starbuck (Dirk Benedict) after he crashed on a desert like planet, following a battle with the cylons. This episode aired after the announcement of the cancellation of the show. Judith Chapman, who guest starred in several other Glen Larson shows (Buck Rogers ""Olympiad"" , Magnum P.I. ""Black Orchid"" and several Fall Guy episodes.)plays the part of the woman who gives birth to the genius child known as Dr Zee (played by Patrick Stuart who later went on to play Will Courtland on All My Children) The episode is available on DVD now as part of the 2nd season set called Galactica 1980 and its opening title sequence was changed to ""Battlestar Galactica"". The video quality is comparable to the DVD despite being duplicated in the LP (Long Play) speed, requiring tracking adjustments on some VCRs. (This practice was common on many titles in the Universal library, that were leased to Goodtimes Video) For years it had been the only Galactica 1980 episode available on VHS.  It was followed in the late 90s when parts of five of the 10 episodes were re-edited into a poorly edited movie ""Conquest of the Earth"" which mostly included scenes from the 3 part pilot intermixed with the plot of the 2 part episode, ""Night the Cylons Landed"". This title can claim that its the unmodified version of the Galactica 1980 series on VHS( There were several unauthorized bootleg versions of episodes supposedly available from Universal in UK but they were good quality bootlegs, but never officially released).",1338681600,2,1650,4.871886120996441
2061295,3,B000243E2K,"Like many Battlestar fans, I was disapointed with the way Galactica 1980 was done.  I recently saw the episodes from Galactica again and I still feel the same about it now as when the series first aired.  I do agree that the last episode about Starbuck is the best from the 1980 series.

  I have not read all the reviews yet, so I don't know if anyone has mentioned this.  But I remember in the early 80s a channel from the Califonia Bay area aired a series of Battlestar movies on tv.  Some were multi part episodes shown together like the first movie, the Gun on Ice Planet Zero, etc.  Others were individual episodes connected together, such as Murder on the Rising Star and the Young Lords, Fire in Space and The Magnificent Warriors.  One of movies that was made of two individual episodes was The Return of Starbuck from Galactica 1980 and Experiment in Terra from the original Battlestar series.

  The movie starts of with the Return of Starbuck, following the episode the way it aired in 1980 up to the point where the pregnant woman was found.  At this point the program takes a different turn.  All footage and reference to the mysterious woman is eliminated and instead goes to where Cy and Starbuck have the shootout with the other cylon warriors.  After that instead of Starbuck being stranded on the planet as seen in the Galactica 1980 version, Starbuck gets into his makeshift ship made from the wreckage of his viper and blast off to rejoin the Colonial fleet.  Here the show transitions into the episode Experiment in Terra.  I clearly remember seeing this and being happy that Starbuck at escaped from the planet and rejoined the fleet.  I don't know who specifically handled the producing of these movies, but it seems that with last one I just mentioned, the people behind it wanted to erase the mistake of leaving Starbuck stranded on the planet and the greater mistake of having the Doctor Z character in the Battlestar cannon.

  I'd like to know if any other Battlestar fans out there remember these tv movies, what they thought of them and if they might one day be put on dvd.

  As for the Galactica 1980 set, it is worth having for the Starbuck episode alone.  I much prefer the other version where Starbuck escapes the planet and I hope that will be on dvd one day.",1337817600,2,2296,4.568627450980392

2061308,3,B000243E2K,"I was a teen when this series aired in 1980, and old enough to know how bad it was even back then. I had watched the original '78 series and although I liked it, I realized it was not the best written or produced show. This sequel series, on the other hand, was an ill-conceived and hastily thrown together mess which really tarnished the reputation of it's predecessor.

So why did I buy it? I only really got this series to replace an old EP VHS copy of ""The Return Of Starbuck"" I bought back in the late '80s. As other reviewers have said, this episode is really the only reason to get this series, and it was worth the price I paid for it ( less than $6.00 ). I will say that rewatching the whole series has been fun in a ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"" kind of way. The plot holes and implausibilies are so numerous that there should be a drinking game based on the show. I promise you...anyone who tried it would end up in an alcoholic coma.

The quality of the DVDs themselves are 'okay'. Typical for DVD releases of many older Universal television series, the prints are not perfect nor do they appear to be digitally remastered or enhanced in any way. Honestly, this series does not really merit any extensive remastering effort, so the picture quality is fine as it is.

Bottom line; If you're a ""Battlestar Galactica"" completist, or enjoy watching television shows that are train wrecks, then by all means buy this set ( just don't pay more than $10.00 for it ).",1333065600,23,1470,4.377289377289378

It makes the survival of earth and the Galactica unlikely. But the show isn't all doom and gloom.

2061313,3,B000243E2K,"Being a huge fan of the original show, I was glad to see Galactica 1980 released on DVD mostly for its wonderful final episode ""The Return of Starbuck"", an episode that is just as good as any from the original series. This is a must-see for any Galactica fan.

As for the rest of the series, it is worth watching just to see how amazingly bad a show can be. Galactica 1980 had three fatal flaws. The first was a premise that changed kept changing (first it was about upgrading Earth's technology, then it was about time travel, and then it was about children with super powers). The second was that none of the premises worked. And the third was that it aired during Sunday at 7pm which at the time was designated a children's hour timeslot. Very little violence was allowed, which killed any real chance of drama. Even worse, a certain number of ""educational beat"" were required to appear throughout every episode. It's amazing to watch the story come to a grinding halt while a character says something educational. During a car chase: ""I perceive that this vehicle is powered by an internal combustion engine, and an internal combustion engine, primitive though it is..."" Okay, that isn't the exact dialogue, but you get the point. In the episode Space Croppers, we get lectures on Chicano history, how to grow plants called legumes, and how rainful is produced! You have to see it to believe it.

If I were a writing instructor, I would use Galactica 1980 as an example of how NOT to write drama. In any story, it's important to create powerful villains and put the heroes in situations that are difficult to deal with. But all of the villains in Galactica 1980 are weak. The Colonials have so many advantages over the people of Earth - spaceships, super powers, invisibility fields - that they are essentially invincible, thus robbing the series of any possible drama. In Galactica 1980, there are no worthy villains. The bumbling cops and incompetent military personnel never have a prayer of apprehending Troy and Dillon, so there's no suspense. And it's certainly not funny to watch Earthlings constantly being confounded by extra-terrestrials. Yet that is what we get time and time again throughout the series.

Also, conventional storytelling says that when you have a character trying to solve a mystery, you want the audience to move along at the same pace as the character. If the audience knows more than the character does, they find themselves simply waiting for the character to catch up, which is boring. Unfortunately, Galactica 1980 violates this basic rule of storytelling as we're forced to endure the U.S. military's investigation of the ""aliens"". We know everything, they know nothing, and thus there is nothing even remotely interesting about it.

In the end, Galactica 1980 is worth watching just to see a spectacular trainwreck.",1322438400,21,2855,4.868312757201646

But that didn't ruin that show; nor did z ruin  this one either. It was however a sad end to the galactica story though. Unlike the really good 2000's version of bg which kicked tail.  Lorne Greene is excellent however , and he died about 7 years after this  show or so , and thankfully he was able to star in something else before that came. But galactica's legacy was marred a bit by this one IN SPITE of that I still find this a at best decent show with a few excellent episodes.

2061316,1,B000243E2K,"OK. I'm a big fan of the original series & its recent remake. I bought this out of nostalgia for the series I faintly remembered as a child. I was shocked again & again not only by the bad acting but the cringe-worthy scenes. They spent more money on licensing footage from other sources than on the production values they filmed.  In the beginning of the pilot, it shows Earth being attacked by Cylons as a tease as to what may happen in the future. I actually recognized a number of the scenes from the 1970's movie ""Earthquake""! There is even a scene that shows Nazi era military types going into a bunker that came from a different movie - when these characters were seen inside the bunker, they were wearing different clothes & even the type of film was different! I couldn't believe Lorne Greene agreed to get involved in this production - he must have desperately needed the money or the producers caught him murdering someone & they blackmailed him into doing it. Within 10 episodes, really 6 since 7 episodes are 2 or 3 part episodes, there are major characters changing actors, a sappy assemblage of alien children, with names like Stardust & Moonshine, that need to be ""saved"" that can do funny tricks like flying in the air with an unseen trampoline under them, all the children are dressed in matching scout uniforms - probably due to the need to reduce wardrobe costs, the children's sing-song was often inaudible - maybe singing in an alien key undetectable by human ears - and the few audible musical notes were wispy & inane, the arch-villain & a Cylon attend a Halloween party hosted by 70's radio DJ Wolman Jack, repeated ""humorous"" scenes of earthlings' reactions to the flying motorcycles  done over & over again to the point of beating a dead horse), the wannabe news reporter that is a totally implausible mess of a character, & Robert Reed in a fro! Adding insult to injury, my favorite character of the original series, Starbuck, appears in the final episode that is essentially a ""why can't we all be friends"" message with a Cylon.

Odd how no-one seems to mention this...",1316563200,2,370,5.379310344827586
2061328,2,B000243E2K,"The Original Battlestar Galactica was a ground breaking series.  Even people who did not like it cannot argue about that.  It was the first well written Science Fiction to actually have a good budget and it showed.  Sure, by today's standards the special effects were not the best but when it originally aired, in its own time, it was outstanding.  I would not have watched the ""reimagined"" version had it not been for loving the original.

However, Galactica 1980 did not meet the high standards set by the original series.  Overall, it looked as if it had been thrown together just to get something on television.  Galactica 1980 is a perfect example of idiot network executives canceling a show only to realize that they made a mistake and then trying to correct their mistake by shoving some cheap trash down the throats of the American public.

Wait - I can't come down off of my soapbox just yet...

After watching the complete series I took a few moments to contemplate and do some soul searching.  Did I love the original series so much that I started Galactica 1980 not wanting to like it?  the final answer is a resounding NO!  I really wanted a continuation of the original and started Galactica 1980  with that attitude. I was disappointed almost from the start.  Why?  Let me ""break it down"":

Acting:  The major characters of Troy, Dillon, and Jamie were adequate.  The best I can say about them is that they did not detract from the story.  However, Troy and Dillon did not come close to having the humanity and warmth of Apollo and Starbuck.  Commander Adama seemed wooden and a little bored with his part.  The two young men who played the child ""Doctor""(can't remember his name)were absolutely awful.  The twelve children who played the ""Super Scouts"" should never have been allowed to be on the set - even Boxey from the original cast was better and that's not saying much.  As for the rest of the cast and extras I did not see one performance that was not poor at best.

Special Effects:  I cannot condemn most of the special effects since they were just rehashed from the original series.  Some of the action that I remember seeing over and over again in the original were back and were used over and over AGAIN!  When special effects were created for Galactica 1980 they looked as if Ed Wood had been hired to do them.  One memorable tragedy was when Troy and Dillon had to go EVA to repair their Viper.  The special effects people didn't even try to hide the wires.  They were so obvious they were laughable.  The only good special effects were the flying motorcycles and they were best when seen from a distance.  (One quick note:  Troy and Dillon could not decide which of the two switches on the cowling to use to extend the wings.  It really didn't matter - both switches worked exactly the same.)

Story/writing:  Really not that bad.  It was not BSG quality but slightly enjoyable just the same.

Would I recommend it?  Maybe!  If you are looking for 1980's prime time television then this may be just for you.  However, if you are looking for quality programming or (like me) want a sequel or spinoff of the original BSG then pass it up.

-SPOILER ALERT!-

The Return of Starbuck did, actually, have the same flavor as the original BSG but I wouldn't buy the whole set just for this show.  Starbuck didn't return.  That was the biggest letdown for me.",1315094400,2,3381,4.580267558528428

2061335,5,B000243E2K,"It's great to finally have this show released onto DVD.I was a little apprehensive that they might have chopped up the episodes(like they did with several earlier VHS releases back in the '90s).Thankfully,they were all the complete and unaltered original shows that I remembered. Many of the episodes of Galactica:1980 were actually better than several original Battlestar Galactica episodes,the most memorable of which for me was ""The Return of Starbuck"".It's too bad that the show wasn't able to provide quality episodes like the Starbuck story every time,but we all know how things like a limited budget can affect things like that. The original show cost $1 Million dollars per episode and often failed to deliver the goods,so what coud you really expect with Galactica:1980?.Both shows might have done well if they had delivered more interesting and better storylines. The best episodes of Galactica:1980(Listed in broadcast order)were:
Galactica Discovers Earth,parts 1,2,&3.
The Night The Cylons Landed,Parts 1&2.
The Return of Starbuck.
Unfortunately,as with the original Battlestar Galactica,they saved the best episode for last(I consider the BSG episode ""The Hand of God"" to be among the very best episodes of the original show. It was the last original broadcast episode until the debut of Galactica:1980).One thing I never uderstood is why they got rid of Apollo,Starbuck,Athena,Colonel Tigh,and all the others. Kent McCord(Troy) and Barry Van Dyke(Dillon) were Ok,but I liked Richard Hatch(Apollo) and Dirk Benedict(Starbuck) a whole lot better than those other two guys. Hollywood people make a lot of stupid decisions by changing casts on shows like this,especially when the original cast is what made the show work in the first place(just look at Airwolf-the same thing happened in season 4 with Barry Van Dyke once again replacing the main character,Stringfellowe Hawk, who was played by Jan Michael Vincent. Of course that show also suffered a major budget cut ,and was moved to the USA Network for its' final season ,and we all know how that worked out.)
Overall,in spite of its' inherient flaws ,Galactica:1980 is a good old fashioned Sci-Fi romp and it's great to see it again and to finally own it on DVD.Buy it if only for The Return Of Starbuck. At a cost of less than $11.00(I paid $10.54 with shipping)it's well worth the price of admission.",1305590400,,2368,5.234210526315789
2061336,2,B000243E2K,"It's amazing what a few decades of time will do.

When I was a kid, I really enjoyed Battlestar Galatica and was deeply saddened when it was canceled. Galactica 1980 was awful, even for kids. The production values and acting was very lacking, especially when compared to the original series.

A number of people reviewing this series mentioned ""The Return of Starbuck"" as the only redeeming value. Well, I agree it's the best episode of the set, but it still pales in comparison to the original series. Yes, it has Dirk Benedict as Starbuck. And there's the intriguing idea of a human making friends with a Cylon in order for both survive. But... that's it. As a kid, I loved this episode. As an adult, I was disappointed in how lame it was compared to what I thought I had remembered. The acting is delivered like the actors are just reading lines for rehearsal. They don't even really seem to care. Would you, knowing this is the last of it? Even Lorne Greene, who had such a long and successful acting career came across as novice-like. Of course, the writing was terrible and the actors had to struggle with that. But still...

[SPOILER ALERT]

Then there's the production values. We have two spacecraft that supposedly crash landed on a desert planet. The crash sites consist of various set pieces propped up against each other on a flat ground. No deep ruts in the ground from impact. No carbon residue from massive fires. No mangled metal. Even the Cylon Centurians were sitting in their chairs upright, the chairs resting on the flat undisturbed ground. Then get this... the Centurian heads off into the desert and finds Starbuck a woman... who is pregnant no-less. She doesn't speak for seven days, then suddenly starts talking and tells Starbuck she came from another dimension. Cy didn't say to Starbuck, ""There was a shimmering light and this woman materialized right in front of me. So I picked her up and brought her here."" He just brings the woman with no explanation given, because none was really asked. Later, she gives birth, remarkably with no blood, no trauma. Just a few cries. Then the woman tells Starbuck that they need an escape pod built. So, he and Cy build a small craft using parts from both ships. It's a joke. The thing is completely non-aerodynamic. The canopy doesn't even close completely shut (we can see a large gap). Like that thing is space worthy, let alone capable of flying in an atmosphere? It launched anyway, tracking very close to the ground, looking like it'll never get off the planet. But somehow it does. OK... so, then there's the show-down. A Cylon Raider lands with 3 Centurians emerging. Just when it looks like Starbuck has met his match, Cy steps out and greets them. Yeah, he actually starts picking them off in the open (ridiculous, actually--why not wait until they have their backs to him?), so the last Centurian gets off a shot and mortally damages Cy. Starbuck is left alone... Doomed to die? We see one last shot of him lugging his backpack on a hike, stopping and then gazing up at the sky in hopelessness. Uh, buddy... remember those Centurians? They came in a Cylon Raider, a craft you once flew with Apollo! You can pilot it, man. But no, this was not considered. To me, this was blatantly ridiculous. He had an obvious way off the planet and he doesn't take it.  I may demand a bit more plausibility from sci-fi, but even being light on this episode it's hard to overlook this glaring flaw.

[END SPOILER]

Anyway... it's entertaining to see the character of Starbuck one last time, even if it was a sub-par performance.  We never ever saw a ""tame"" Cylon and this episode was able to shake out that idea and give it a try.  That gave it a certain charm.

About the only other amusing episode is when the Cylons arrive on Earth. A prototype Cylon Raider crash lands, with a humanoid Cylon and one surviving Centurian. They conveniently land on Halloween, so they blend right in. It's rather amusing... for a while. The remaining episodes are extremely dated, boringly long, and wince-worthy many times over.

What really makes it difficult to ""swallow"" the whole Battlestar Galactica series was what came before it.  I mean look at ""Star Trek"", the original series.  Given the budget they had back then, look at the production values they achieved.  The quality of direction and acting.  It's an amazing work.  Of course BSG is based on a very different premise.  And it was heavily influenced by the appearance of Star Wars.  But perhaps it was also the times... the 70's produced a painful number of mediocre TV series.  ""Galactica 1980"" is certainly one of them.  It's a good laugh for nostalgia's sake.

I grew up with the BattleStar Galactica, and was used to the confident commanding leadership of Adama, very definitely missing from this 1980 series. He gave the impression of being completely reliant on the wonder boy. The earth activities of Boxy and his off-sider were very definitly in G-Rated comedy level, but having said that, we actually enjoyed the light hearted laughs through-out as they sort to acquaint themselves with the unknown Earth customs. The space motorbikes were great, and the invisable-visable effects also. The earth characters, ie, the girl reporter, and verious others slotted into their roles with ease. Shooting back in time to world war 11 was a novel addition. The only time the series got anywhere near the origional, was in the very last episode with a reinstated Star-Buck. It was very good.

2061350,4,B000243E2K,"Watching this series of 10 episodes was a bittersweet experience for me. I remember watching this show as a kid and loving it, so in that sense it was a blast from the past. However, at the same time, this second coming of Battlestar Galactica was much lampooned by fans of the original series and rightly so. While the original Battlestar Galactica was really an amazing show for the time with a futuristic feel, Galactica 1980 comes across as a cheesy late 70s or early 80s show. It has much more in common with shows like CHiPs and the Dukes of Hazzard than the original series. By now, the wrangling over budget, casting, content and producers for this show are well known. I will just comment on a couple of the pros and cons of the show. On the negative side, it's obvious that there was a lot of re-use of scenes and clips from the original series as well as attempts to cover up the lack of sets, characters and effects of the original. There were only two regularly appearing characters from the first series and only Commander Adama played a significant part in most episodes. Finally, the arrival at Earth and the back story were handled somewhat abruptly and unevenly. On the positive side, the three main characters, Troy, Dillon and Jaime Hamilton are likable and do a pretty decent job of acting. I think the story lines and production quality improved somewhat towards the end with some of the latter episodes being fairly decent.

It's understandable why fans of the original series were unhappy with this show and why they often prefer to imagine it never happened. However, if you are one of those who didn't get quite enough with the original series and wish it had never ended, this might be of interest.",1275609600,2,1725,4.618892508143323

The rest.....not so much.....

I'll admit that I haven't seen all the episodes, but from what I saw the series just doesn't work.  This show could be for kids, and that's why it doesn't work.  There's nothing wrong with a kids show, but Galactica doesn't fit in the realm of a saturday-morning children's program, as 1980 appears to be.  There aren't as many cool special effects, stock footage from the original series is annoyingly used here and there are plot holes (for example, Troy and Dillan visit Earth in the two-parter first episode.  Some time later they tell the children of the fleet that because they were raised on ships, the atmosphere and gravity will be different for them on Earth and thus they will posess the power to jump really high and whatnot.  This is a good idea, but why didn't they incorporate this into the first episode?!)

Compared to the original Galactica, 1980 is bland, unepic, and too goofy.  The only real good parts are the comedy scenes when the ""Galacticans"" get confused with Earth technology and culture.

Besides the constant reuse of the same cut scenes over and over for special effect, and the seemingly every shortening cast & changeout throughout, the storyline itself is also poor.

2061388,4,B000243E2K,"I'd heard for many years how awful this show was. Well, it is, kind of. But I liked it. I was very entertained by even the most (for that time) politically correct episode (there are many environmentalist issues at hand since ""higher intelligence"" deals with we ""dumb modern day humans""). It's about the Galactica finding earth and then two guys making sure earth is safe from Cylons, that is, making sure that we could in fact battle Cylons if they happened to attack, and follows their adventures in a modern day society with their special space skills, and flying motorcycles, and bionic children. And a cylon actually lands on earth and kidnaps Wolfman Jack. Now if I were to have read this a month ago, I'd think there wouldn't be any way for it to be good... But every episode keeps you interested, somehow. Seeing Robbie ""Cousin Oliver"" Rist and Robert ""Mr. Brady"" Reed in the same episode (although never on screen together) was kind of funny. Kent McCord as the grown up ""Boxey"" is good; Barry Van Dyke (son of Dick) as his sidekick (McCord is the ""Apollo"" while Van Dyke is the ""Starbuck"", per say) isn't good at all. Van Dyke is about as wooden as a log cabin as far as acting goes, and his voice sounds like an FM dj. ""Adama"" played by Lorne Greene and ""Boomer"" (who has basically replaced ""Col. Tigh"" as second in command) are the only original cast members, and it's kind of relaxing to have them there even though they aren't involved much since they stay in space, and most of the show is on the ground. ""Starbuck"" (Dirk Benedict) is the center of the final episode. The entire series (including the original) ends with our hero ""Starbuck"" (the ""Han Solo"" of BG) stranded on a barren planet. A total cliffhanger, leaving me to realize the show was canned while trying to ""tease"" the studios into letting it stick around. And do we ever get to hear about what happened to ""Appolo"" and his sister, or ""Cass""? Anyhow, this show had time travelling, space dog fights, and a very, very cool visual-scenerio of Cylons blowing up earth. Pretty neat. And as I've mentioned, the stories are involving.

The amazing music, the Cyclons, the cast, the writing and the incredible miniatures created by John Dykstra - the genius behind  the spaceships in Star Wars - brought an epic, cinematic approach to television never before seen.

I recommend this only as a ""completion"" to your original BSG collection, and for the handful of cool episodes mentioned in the other reviews.

As far as the ""new"" Battlestar Galactica, I can only say one thing:  CHEESE.  The CGI is the WORST.  The acting is third rate, and the writing is a FAR cry from the original series.  I suffered through three episodes on the Sci-Fi channel and refused to watch it again.  It may even be worse than 1980.  It just cannot recreate the magic and genius of Glen Larson's original.  Sorry.",1208217600,,927,4.754716981132075
2061395,2,B000243E2K,"'Galactica 1980' proves you should never overstay your welcome on the TV screen.(Something the new 'Battlestar Galactica' writers and executives better take note of!)

Sadly the potential of BSG finding Earth is realised but in a very disjointed and confusing way.

At the end of the orginal series, Apollo picks up the TV transmission of the 1969 luna landings via an old radio and starchart observation dome mounted topside of Galactica's hull. Unable to decipher what it is, Apollo leaves it alone and that's the end of the original series...

No doubt TV executives were convinced that an arrival to the long lost planet would work...However many of the original charcters, mainly Richard Hatch, refused to sign up and so the new series is based ten years after in our year 1980.  This time it's Apollo's son 'Boxey' who is actually named Troy and his close freind Dillon that are the lead men. How on earth they managed to convince Lorne Green to reprise his role as Adama is unknown to this reviewer. He is left an old man with no serious role execpt to constanly talk into his dictator.  A new charcter, 'Dr Zee', child genius helps explain why many people suddenly turned off...

The series starts off alright with the discovery that Earth is woefully unprepaired for the potential of an intergalactic war. In a rolling three episode storyline a plan to travel back in time to 1944 sees the charcter Xavier, a renegade fleet commander attempt to help the Nazis inmprove their rocket technology, it is Troy and Dillon that save the day.

After that, the entire series starts to slide into mediocrity, that even half way through I'm sure the TV executives at Universal were now saying enough!  The inclusion of a Children's storyline ruined everything and a brief forray into the Cylons finally landing ends in stupidity.
Surprisingly the axe fell at the one of the most intriguing episodes, 'The Return Of Starbuck' with Dirk Benidict reprising his role to explain the 'birth' of child genius, Dr Zee.  The last few seconds of this episode sees Starbuck staring aimlessly out over the desert as the final credits roll.  Ending what should never have been made!

If you are looking for epic space battles...there aren't any.  If you want to see what everyone looked like in 1980, bring a sick bag...

They skipped the mystery of actually finding Earth and suddenly are already there.  Then the Cylons pop out of nowhere after 30 years and force them to lead them away.  How did they stay in range of Earth while flying away from it?!  It was nice to see Lorne Green, but all he does is play 2nd fiddle to 'Dr Zee', Gone is the imaginative and decisive Adama of old.  It is also a treat to see Barry Van Dyke as dillon.  He does a wonderful job of getting into trouble trying to assimilate into Earth culture.  He even accidently robs a bank!
  The plot eventually thickens with advanced cylon and human ships being introduced as well as human looking cylons.  I think if the show had been allowed to go on and the writers had been willing to change the formula to advance the plot (that is, make real changes to Earth), they might have had a good story to tell.",1206835200,2,963,4.329608938547486

I was 6 years old when this series came around and it didn't enjoy the reruns of the original Battlestar Galactica, so my memories of Troy and Dillon (the new Starbuck and Apollo) were sparse at best (it's like when Dukes of Hazzard had those other cousins show up or Airwolf had a whole new cast suddenly show up....crazy 80's TV clones).

Overall the episodes are pure low budget 80's sci-fi trash-- vaguely reminiscent of Star Trek IV in its disturbing blend of heavy handed environmentalism (the ""Super Scouts"" episodes) and high school theater quality time travel (the pilot episodes with a generic Nazi Germany romp).

The opening 3-parter features guest star Robert Reed, and a scene with Brion James and Mickey Jones.  The 2-parter ""The Night the Cylons Landed"" features Wolfman Jack and William Daniels (the original voice of KITT from Knight Rider).  That episode also features the first appearance of a Cylon in human form.

And there is the ""Return of Starbuck"" episode where in addition to getting Starbuck back for another hour, there is Cy voiced by Gary Owens (Adult Swim views know him) and Judith Chapman (Gloria on Young & The Restless) as Angela.

Dennis Haysbert is briefly in the ""Space Croppers"" episode.

The whole story line with the kids (half of them were related to Glen A. Larson) went on too long, but this was produced more as a kids show originally.

Kent McCord and Barry Van Dyke do a good enough job, their only crime is they weren't Apollo & Starbuck.  Viewers will also get a laugh at the re-cycled footage.  Every time Troy and Dillon fly off on their cycles, they show the same shot of them going over the same LA landscape.

The obvious is of course, ""The Return of Starbuck"".  A totally delightful episode with one of the favorite characters from the original show; a Cylon that acts all jealous when a woman appears- one he found for his human companion; a baby that gets born; a hint that Angelica is actually one of the Super Race; and finally, why didn't Starbuck escape in the Cylon fighter that came looking for his rebuilt Cylon friend, Cy.  Instead we see him stranded on the desolate planet all alone.

Other gems, two scenes in different shows with Adama and his grandson Boxey, renamed Troy.  A lovely song sang in ""The Super Scouts"" and ""Spacecroppers"", not to mention the growing sequence with the same song done instrumentally.  The big name stars of the time who were on the show, the continual stealing of police cars making one wonder if they were hinting at the fact that Kend McCord, who played Troy, had once been on Adam 12, and the birth of the humaniod Cyclons like the ones on the new series.  Not to mention the fact that what we would consider normal, often caught the Galacticas by surprise.

The best gem, for Dark Shadows fans, is in ""The Night the Cylons Landed"".  Lara Parker, dressed as a vampire, is driving in a car with her husband, as a clown, on Halloween night.  She sees the human like Cylon, Roger Davis, and one big metal one.  They stop the car and she gets out.  Roger Davis takes a couple steps backward.  She laughs, takes out the fake teeth and explains she's not really a vampire and offers them a lift into town.  Now, the reason this if funny is because Lara Parker, Angelique on Dark Shadows, was once a vampire and Roger Davis, Jeff Clark, was her victim.  Whether the scene was an accident or planned as an inside joke, that's hard to tell.  But it is funny if you know the reference.

What is annoying:
Depending on the child genius Dr. Zee to solve all the problems and making Adama seem like an idiot.
The fact they depended on gimics like the force fields that hid the people, ships and motorcyles for detection.
Too much use of stock footage.
The flying motorcyles.
No sense of character from the leads.
Plot problems between the three hour pilot and the second episode, like dropping the time travel aspect, Jamie, the human woman who helped them, back on Earth with no explanation, and the fact they can jump high.

If you want to purchase this to keep your collection complete, than I would suggest it.  But keep in mind that it is not near the quality of the original show.",1201046400,3,2765,4.523138832997988

The reason it got pulled in 1978 was, from one rumor, if that was George Lucas threatened to sue for copyright infringement or something like that. The original series was popular and rated highly.
The Return Of Starbuck gives one an insightful clue, they should have brought back the entire original cast. Dr. Zee for the most part was a bit useless. The stories of some of the episodes were aimed at ecological imbalances that have only recently come to be the forefront of our future.
I wouldn't recommend this series too highly, although considering what they did when bringing back Battlestar Galactica a few years ago I would recommend the entire original series (Starbuck a woman? Boomer a woman?< no, I don't think so.) over that ""thing"" any day. Especially if you are a purist of the original series of any television series (i.e. comedy, drama, etc. included).
Bring back the original Apollo, Starbuck, Boomer, Athena, Jolly, etc. and make it a true revival of a very popular sci-fi series. After all that is what attracted the younger audiences who never saw the series when it aired originally back in the late 1970s. Rest In Peace Lorne Greene (THE Commander Adama.

I'm a big fan of sci-fi when a future society interacts with our modern day, and that is basically what this series is.

Though the cast is all but gone from the original series (only a year or so before), there are some familiar faces.  Many have called Galactica 1980 some of the worst science fiction ever made, but I have a different opinion.

Galactica 1980 did not do justice to the drama of the original series.  It had many hokey special effects (some recycled from the original series, which actually helped tie the two together) and some pretty cheesy story lines, but what it did do was to give a little closure to what was a really great series.  There are familiar contract actors that many of us grew up with from many other television series, along with familiar scenery from shows, such as CHiPs and The Dukes of Hazzard.

Galactica 1980 ends abruptly and a bit strangely, but it does give us die hard ""original"" Galactica fans a little more (The Return of Starbuck).  It is nice to watch those programs from the late 70's, early 80's that however imperfect they are, the bad guy always get it, the good guys are really good, and the show is over at the end of the hour.  Whatever the show lacked and however badly it was exectued, Galactica 1980 was still fun to watch.

When SCI-FI Channel aired the show about 10 or so years ago, only the first couple episodes opened with the Galactica 1980 title. Part 3 of the pilot and the remaining episodes were retitled as Battlestar Galactica.  So when the uncut original episodes appeared on DVD one would think that the original masters would have been used.  Nope. Not that it matters as long as they only change is the credits and not the edited versions shown on SCI-FI. Their was an episode or two where the directed by credit was incorrectly spelled. Apparently it was never noticed when the remastered the source. Okay enough of the technical stuff...hows the show itself.  Well as weird and hokey as these episodes were, they still had a an interesting story to tell. Most BSG fans cringe at it and deny its existence but it is still part of the saga. At least they (MCA) didn't release the theatrical release of the series ( aka Conquest of the Earth)which was a 100 minute poorly edited and redubbed with mismatched voices and included parts of every 2 part Galactica 1980 episode except where they added a ""twin"" genious child to explain why the character of Dr. Zee was played by two different actors Robbie Rist(of Brady Bunch, which also starred Robert Reed who also stars in Galactica 1980)  and Patrick Stuart (who went on to play the evil Will Courtland on All My Children). The premise as the story goes is Galactica finds Earth after 30 or so years (originally called yahrens) most of the original characters are assumed dead,(killed by the cylons?), with exception of
Adama and Boomer ( who hasn't aged 30 years) and Boxey, now called Troy, played by Adam-12 veteran Kent McCord. Joining him is a pre-Diagnosis Murder Barry Van Dyke. The show doesn't really explain very well what had occured in the 30 years, except for a brief bit in Adama's opening credit monologue, and of course, the highest rated episode of the series where the assumed fate of Starbuck ( played again by Dirk Benedict)is explored.
Its too bad Richard Hatch was unable to sell his tale that was rumored to bridge some of the story gaps between the two series (but not too much) I don't blame Larson for the lameness. its ABC's fault for rushing the show and then putting it in the early family hour time slot which restricted the action and dialogue.

It was the best of series,..the worse of series...
Ok, it was a bad series. As an admirer of the original series, I eagerly waited for the series after the first Galactica went off the air. Largely, I was disappointed with the resulting production but remembered enough to pick up the DVD. The changed concept created a forgettable series with mostly forgettable characters. The young Dr Zee, while designed to appeal to the younger audience, did not resonate positively and added to the series`failing.
For the record, it is still `bad`, but retains enough of the appeal of the original series to draw completists in. Some people will never watch `Spaceball`, and that`s a good thing. But the discovery of planet earth by the Galactica and the resulting battles are memorable. With the cylons in close pursuit, the Galacticans must introduce technology to combat the potential menace that arrives in `The Night the Cylons Landed``.
The series lasted 10 episodes, climaxing with the appearance of Starbuck in the `Return of Starbuck` ending a short run that inspired the Sci Fi Channel masterpiece. The two disc set includes:
Galactica Discovers Earth
The Super Scouts
Spaceball
The Night the Cylons Landed
Space Croppers
The Return of Starbuck
The cast of Galactica 80 featured Kent Cord as Commander Troy, Lorne Greene as Adama, Barry Van Dyke as Lieutenant Dillon, Herbert Jefferson as Boomer, and James Patrick Stuart as Dr Zee. Dirk Benedict, Brion James, and Dennis Haysbert guest star.
As a short stop off for the Glen Larson series, it was a slight detour. Thankfully, it lasted so few episodes. It did serve to introduce Barry Van Dyke to audiences who later performed with his father in Diagnosis Murder.

Also,the executives wanted the show to be more kid friendly so Dr Zee is introduce. The pilot 1st 3 episodes are actually quite good dealing with time travel. True the writers have to comply with the family aspect of the show,so the episodes have very little fight scenes (would not be able to film it any way due to limited budget). After learning ABC would  not renew the show, the producers filmed the last episode ""The Return of Starbuck"" to wrap up the series as a whole.

2061503,3,B000243E2K,"Galactica: 1980 was produced very quickly as ABC needed something for the Sunday evening timeslot.  As a result the first three-hour (or three part) episode, ""Galactica Discovers Earth"" isn't too bad as a lot of money was thrown at it.  However, the change in the characters put off a lot of viewers who had enjoyed the previous series, ""Battlestar: Galactica"".  The remaining seven hours of shows varied considerably, as the show was put into the Saturday morning timeslot and had to comply with strict FAA standards for morning shows.

The episode ""The Night the Cylons Landed"" was okay, featuring DJ Wolfman Jack, although not serious sci-fi it was at least somewhat entertaining.  The last episode, ""The Return of Starbuck"" is the only truly good episode in the entire series, as it returned to the characters of the original Battlestar: Galactica series.

However what really killed the show were the painfully bad episodes featuring the ""Super Scouts"", which make the worst episodes of ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" seem classy by comparison.

Although Galactica: 1980 is a separate TV show from the original Battlestar: Galactica, outside of the US the show used the name ""Battlestar: Galactica"" as it aired after 1980 outside the US and the original title didn't make sense.

2061514,1,B000243E2K,"Though in my title I describe this as THE PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE of TV SF, there is one major difference:  PLAN 9 is often regarded as so awful as to be entertaining in its awfulness.  GALACTICA 1980 is just awful and its awfulness is of the painful variety.

Several reviewers have noted that this series is usually considered one of if not the worse TV SF series ever made.  I think it is worse than that, arguably the worst TV series ever made.  Certainly it is the worst series I have ever seen.  It illustrates the impossibility of doing a SF series with no budget.  Not that they didn't try.  They imagine, for instance, that the children going to surface of Earth would thrive physically on the surface of a planet with less air pressure.  As a result they can bound utterly absurd heights into the air, resulting in some of the most stupid looking stunts in the history of TV.  In the initial episode, as local police search the areas where they are hanging out, the kids all bound high up into a huge tree.  The police don't see them at all, even though they are all dressed in bright yellow capes (supposedly scouting uniforms [?]) and are tossing fruit at the police (!).  And some of the characters are just horrid.  Dr. Zee might make my list of the worst characters ever created.

Another reviewer mentioned the Halloween episode, which is painful indeed.  But truth be told the worse parts are the result of painfully awful writing.  Honestly, this series is bad on every conceivable level.

I did not like BSG 1978.  Compared to the current BSG, which is pretty much without debate not merely the best SF series ever but one of the great TV series ever, it was dreadful.  But compared to GALACTICA 1980 BSG 1978 was a masterpiece.  I can just imagine how painful watching this series must be to fans of the earlier series.  I don't think there is any possible debate that GALACTICA 1980 is the worst spin off ever.

There are a few curious guest appearances.  Lorne Greene reappears throughout as Adama and Herb Jefferson reprises Boomer.  Dirk Benedict returns as Starbuck in the series' most famous episode.  A very young Dennis Haybert puts in an appearance.  Wolfman Jack appears as himself in a couple of spots that can only be termed tragic.

I will add that my heart broke for Kent McCord throughout this series.  He is an actor I like and it is painful watching him in this.  Luckily, he later snagged a recurring role in one of the best TV SF series ever, as John Crichton's father in FARSCAPE.

The only positive thing I can say about this clunker is that it didn't last very long.  I think the only people who could even remotely be interested in this series are BSG completists, those who are such over-the-top fans of either the great-new or bad-old BSG that they are willing to wade through anything at all relevant.  I managed to work my way all the way through the 1978 series, as bad as it was, without actual agony.  Boredom, yes.  Pain, no.

The new stars (and I use that term loosely) were ""pretty"" but were essentially cardboard and mostly interchangeable, lacking any character development (which, as a ""Galactica"" complaint, says a lot -- there wasn't much character development on the original series either, but in comparison to the ""1980"" roles, the original characters come off as Shakespearean in depth).  Further, there was too much of a ""cutesy"" focus on kids.  Only one episode stands out and that would be ""The Return of Starbuck"" in which Dirk Benedict reprised his role and we learned what happened to that character.

2061520,1,B000243E2K,"Following the collapse of the original Battlestar Galactica, someone must have come to the conclusion that perhaps the reason the show never caught on was because like ""Wagon Train"", there did not appear to be an end in sight. Every Galactica episode always ended with the promise that Earth would be found and everything would get better. So, why not do it?

The result was quite possibly the worst TV series ever made! Having the Galactica finding Earth should have meant that the doors of creativity were wide open. After all, there was no guarantee that the Galactica's Earth was ""our"" Earth; they could have done anything! Instead, the decision was made to relocate to suburban Los Angeles, while simultaneously downgrading the viewing audience to 8-10 year-olds. In doing so, they committed three big mistakes:

1) It cost them the faithful viewers they already had.

2) The time-slot (10:00 PM) was inappropriate for such viewers, since most children would already be in bed. VCR's had not come into general use at the time.

3) Children who do watch TV science fiction wanted simple storylines with lots of action (compare with Larson's previous success, Buck Rogers) which Galactica 1980 did not provide, thus alienating the ones who did tune in.

Also, virtually all the special effects, such as dogfight scenes, consisted of previously used footage which was simply recycled. If the producers figured, ""No one will ever know,"" they were mistaken. Veteran fans felt ripped off, and quickly abandoned Galactica 1980. Others would soon follow.

Compounding these problems was the loss of popular characters such as Apollo, Starbuck, and Tigh, who had been firmly established in the previous series. Then there were the moralizing scripts with thinly-veiled lectures on political correctness, environmentalism, and religious stories, garnished with sloppy editing and bad science. There was also the problem (frequently encountered in science fiction) of 'deus ex machina'; the god out of the machine--the idea that all problems can be solved with superior technology. This put the Galactican humans in the position of being moralizing gods trying to correct the wayward, Earth-bound humans. Either Executive Producer Glen Larson was unaware of this problem, or he didn't care about it, because nearly all the Galactica 1980 scripts fell into this trap and never climbed out.

Worst of all was the constant shots of Galactican children, flashing so many dazzling smiles while cavorting on the ground that the viewer often wondered whether he was watching an hour-long toothpaste commercial! The giggles, laughter and general inanity of the young characters overloaded the stories with so much saccharine that it was almost impossible NOT to turn off the television!

Universal's decision to release Galactica 1980 can only be seen for what it is: a deliberate attempt to cash in on the revised Galactica's success. This is nothing less than shameless hucksterism, but it's entirely in keeping with what we've come to expect from Hollywood in general. Nevertheless, I would call this ""cruel and unusual punishment"" for anyone foolish enough to buy this product. If they do, they'll be sorry!

In the nutshell, Battlestar Galactica 1980 was probably one of the grossest mistakes ever conceived by network TV, a literal rape of the original show and concept. The script was bad, acting was pretty lame, production was cheap and entire premise is so unbelievable that it was with a sigh of relief when this show finally died. The show was really geared toward little kids since they introduced this genius child, Dr. Z or whatever. I guess he is running the Colonial Fleet now. I hope that interest in this show is dying as I write.

However, all wasn't a total loss here, Lorne Greene still managed to hold some dignity to the show even with his Santa Claus beard. He must really needed a paycheck.

And as one previous reviewer stated, there was one good episode in this series, ""Return of Starbuck"" that proves that if the collective minds do get together, even a totally lame TV show can produce at least one good showing.

As a vivid fan of the original Battlestar Galactica series, I watched this show until it got cancelled. Then I pretended that it never happened, almost like a trauma victim. However, if I see it in a bargain bin for next to nothing, I might get it just for that one episode so the entire thing won't be remembered as an bad dream.",1193529600,53,1564,4.484210526315789
2061522,5,B000243E2K,"Galactica 1980 is a great show, provided that you don't set your standards too high. The show actually does more justice to shows such as Bewitched and I Dream of Gene than I does to Battlestar Galactica. It can be very entertaining, but it lacks action and is sometimes kind of cheesy. On the plus side, it is very family friendly and a good show for children to watch. That is a feature that is becoming harder and harder to find in a lot of science fiction.
  The casting for the show is poorly thought out. All of the younger cast from Battlestar Galactica, such as Richard Hatch, Anne lockhart, are gone and their characters presumed dead. However, Lorene Greene is still playing Commander Adama. How he survived and everyone else died out is a mystery. The show also features Terry Carter as Colonel Tigh. For those of you who liked Kent McCord on Seaquest and Farscape, you will like him in his staring role on Galactica 1980.
  Although this show may be no Battlestar Galactica, it is still perfect for finishing any Battlestar collection. (Don't forget about Buck Rogers, also done by Glen Larson.)
  The show consists of 10 episodes, (6 if you group all the 2 and 3 parters together). The best episode of them all was the last one called The Return of Starbuck. This episode, featuring Dirk Benidick, was the one episode that did do justice to the original Battlestar. That is an episode that no 70's Battlestar Galactica fan should be without. The other 9 episodes mostly deal with environmental issues. Although they can be funny, they are mostly children's episodes.

(PS. I you ever wanted to see a motor cycle that can fly like a viper, this is the show to see it in.)",1193529600,3,1683,4.59
2061523,2,B000243E2K,"Battlestar Galactica was an attempt to create an exciting space drama on a weekly schedule. To an extent, it did and collected a large loyal fan base. The budget was high and the sets and effects looked great. Despite efforts, ratings slipped and the show was not renewed. A feeble attempt was made to bring the show back for a second season. The budget was slashed and the time slot required it to be made for the family with educational elements. The revised effort lasted less than half a season. To appeal to the family, children were featured as a vehicle for the educational elements making it more like the bad Disney efforts of the early 1970s.  There were a few good episodes, especially the last one where Starbuck is featured in a flash back episode. Also a 2-part featured Wolfman Jack who was popular at the time. It was also fun to see Cylons on Earth. The flying motercycles are still popular with the fans and the visual effects held up well for its day.

Galactica Fans must buy this disk set. I bought it because I worked on the show. Enjoy.",1193097600,2,1059,4.481865284974093
2061524,4,B000243E2K,"I must have seen every episode of this series when it came out as a seven year old boy back in St. Louis and I LOVED it! Sure it has some campy moments, but so did the original, and maybe it played up to kids a little too much, but hey I WAS a kid. I saw this entire series awhile back on the Sci-fi channel and loved every episode. There was so much potential! It should have lasted longer! This DVD collection is a must buy for me.

P.S. The ""Return of StarBuck"" episode is great, but the Holloween 2-parter is a much more fun episode and is where HUMAN Cylons appear for the first time.",1192406400,5,589,4.034188034188034
2061525,2,B000243E2K,"Basically, you should buy this entire box-set for a single episode. ""The Return of Starbuck"". Your original Battlestar Galactica collection isn't truly complete without it. No matter what is said of this series as a whole, this one episode truly captures the feel of the original series.

What about the other episodes? Well, let's just say that on many occasions, critics have selected Galactica 1980 as the worst sci-fi tv series of all time. How could it turn out so horrid? The budget was slashed to just a fraction of the amount spent on the original series. Also, many of the episodes were aired in an early time slot (I believe it was 7:00pm) which placed restrictions on the content of the series (writers had to avoid writing too many action scenes or even the most innocent adult themes). Galactica 1980 was basically a rushed effort, pushed forward and then severely hindered (by various network executives) on a mission to recoup from their mistake of canceling the original series.

This series may have been a train wreck, but the final episode (The Return of Starbuck) is a bittersweet tribute to the original series. A must have!

P.S.

This is being sold as ""The Original Battlestar Galactica's Final Season"". It must be noted that the original series was cancelled after the first season. While Galactica 1980 can indeed be considered a continuation of the first season, it is in fact a seperate TV series. Most fans of the original series pretend that Galactica 1980 never happened :)

2061526,1,B000243E2K,"I remember back in 1979-early 1980, hearing the commericals for a new show, ""Tenspeed and Brownshoe"" and the announcer saying ""right after Galactica.""  Did I hear right?  When I heard the commercial next, and heard that end phrase, I went wild.  My favorite show of all time is coming back!  And I was going to premiere around my birthday.  What a nice present from Universal.  Then I saw the first episodes...

Folks, save your money.  The only good episode is ""The Return of Starbuck.""  And if that was not a fake beard Lorne Greene was wearing, somebody shoot the barber!

In Galactica fandom, we even ignore this $#&$^^#.  Please save your money and buy the reimagined episodes instead.

I would love to give this no stars, but I can't.  I grudgingly give it one star.",1192060800,3,772,4.62962962962963
2061527,3,B000243E2K,"Like it or not, It's part of the original series which isn't complete without it. As with all series and sequels you can find fault in some parts and love others. I prefer the original series to the new but I still watch and collect both. I think the new series would have been better if they had kept those cool uniforms of old BG. and not turned them into Earthman suit and ties. They are supposed to be from a different world not present day Earth. And bullets in space, what happened to the laser guns? One addition I do like is the saying "" So say we all"".
Love it or not BG 1980 is part of Galactica and I have pre-ordered my copy.
The original is still the best! If you don't agree don't buy it.

2061528,1,B000243E2K,"Wasn't this the one where the two lead guys tooled around California on motorcycles for 99% of the show?  And NOT in super-cool space ships?  (Ships that, as I recall, were only seen in footage canibalized from the original show?)

I have only vague memories of this show, but what I clearly remember was being a very peeved ten-year-old.  Irritated because they'd turned my beloved Battlestar Galactica into a crappy CHiPs knock-off.

But perhaps the fog of time has obscured my memory of it.  Perhaps it's really the Citizen Kane of television shows and I'm maligning it unfairly.

But I doubt it.",1191888000,5,599,4.813725490196078
2061529,4,B000243E2K,"I am probably a minority here, but I actually enjoyed this series.  We have Barry VanDyke and Kent McCord as well as Lorne Green (as Adama).  The effects were as good as the original series.  One can't help but wonder what ever happened to all the other main characters.  However, we do learn what happened to Starbuck with an episode that features Dirk Benedict reprising his role.

Give it a chance.  If you ask me it is far better than the current reincarnation of Battlestar Galactica.",1191456000,3,489,4.627906976744186
2061530,5,B000243E2K,"G:80 wasn't the best. Most episodes sucked. It jumped the shark. It was kiddie Galactica with worse plots than Superman III and IV.

But we got Adama (with a fake beard) Boomer, Boxey (now Troy), and even Starbuck showed up at the last minute. Plus Wolfman Jack!

The original concept for this series was with Adama, Starbuck, Apollo, and Baltar (having been cleared of genocide and promoted to president of the Council of Twelve). But the scripts we so bad that Hatch and Benedict wanted nothing to do with the show. So ABC changed things.

So if you miss the original series and are tired of Moore-Ron's version with Vipers that shoot bullets (Huh?) that takes itself too seriously, and is afraid to be campy, rewind and bit for some fun and stupidity.  If anything, buy this for the final episode ""The Return of Starbuck"".  G:80 was also the first BSG series to feature humanoid Cylons.

2061531,1,B000243E2K,"Galactica 1980 has to be the worst sci-fi ever produced for television.  Yes, even worse than Buck Rogers or Planet of the Apes (the series).  I wouldn't go back & rewatch this show even if you paid me.",1191196800,,202,4.2894736842105265
2061532,3,B000243E2K,"Galactica 1980 is a must-have for the BSG TOS fan. Most of us couldn't understand why they didn't include these 10 episodes in the original box set in the first place. They could have considered it a bonus disc if they were embarrassed. In any case, it is a delight to finally see the entire original series be complete with this release.

BSG 1980 was indeed a disappointment for me when it first aired, but I remained a fan and tried to overlook some of the silliness of things like the BSG baseball team.  Adama's change from leader of the fleet to a mere servant of the all-knowing Dr. Zee bothered me also. But there is some good SF here: eps. Galactica Discovers Earth (3 eps.), The Night the Cylons Landed (2 eps.), and The Return of Starbuck are highlights of the show for me.

Everyone seems to be in agreement that The Return of Starbuck episode was great -- a leftover piece from the previous year. An audio commentary from Dirk Benedict on that one would have been amazing.

Complaints department: Out of desperation, I already have this series taped from TV and transferred over to DVD. I would gladly buy this very attractive-looking 2-disc set for my collection, but I need something to grab me, any reasonable excuse will suffice. I'd even take some episode trailers, attractive subtitle text, or a couple of deleted scenes if they weren't going to give us commentaries or a featurette. Hopefully, a few more details about the release will indicate at least a small extra of some kind.

Update 3-Oct-07:
Disappointing news from [link censored] regarding bonus features:
""Coming as a 2-disc DVD the release features the original fullframe presentation of the show with its original mono audio track. No extras will be included on the release, sadly when it hits retail stores on December 26 for $[price censored].""",1190851200,3,1829,4.757097791798107

This series was guilty of so many sins of television (so many there's no point in going through all of them) that it couldn't help to be awful.

Worth your time only if you're a BSG completist (hence the two stars) but otherwise follow the course of many BSG fans and consider this not in continuity with the original series and stay clear.",1190592000,5,557,4.46078431372549
