5721806,4,B00CFQBQ6E,Watching Dragon Knight reinforced my fascination with the Sword-and-Sandal genre.  Visually brilliant scenes & an engrossing story make this a MUST-WATCH movie!,1374192000,,160,6.2727272727272725
5721807,5,B00CFQBQ6E,Very happy that this film is getting released. Easily one of my fav sword and sandals films i have ever seen,1373068800,,108,4.190476190476191
5721808,1,B00CFQBQ6E,"An amazingly senseless and stoopid film that has no place to deservedly self-destruct. Absolutely nothing makes any sense in this film and it goes totally nowhere. Awful story, casting, acting, production, filming, etc., etc.

I have the bedrock feeling they made this film up on the fly, from moment to moment.

A very irritating film. I could only take 43 minutes.

Give it a miss.",1385078400,,383,4.861538461538461
5721809,2,B00CFQBQ6E,"Not at all what i  thouhgt.  did not keep my attention.  b rated movie, just not  my kind of movie",1384128000,,98,3.75
5721810,5,B00CFQBQ6E,"Pretty entertaining, with a story that is pretty likable with the knight being conflicted with how he measures up to warrior tales and people's expectations of how a knight should be and accomplish. Would watch over and over. If people would give this a chance they might be surprised, just don't expect an action packed film---but rather one with a unique twist on past knight tales and stories we've seen before.",1383782400,,414,4.845070422535211
5721811,2,B00CFQBQ6E,"I was expecting this to be a little old school but was more disipointed when it dragged on, even for a French film. (Doubed)",1381708800,,124,4.208333333333333
5721812,1,B00CFQBQ6E,"If I were ever asked 'which is the worse movie you have ever seen
' I'd have to say Dark Knight is it! Don't waste your money!",1381708800,,126,3.7037037037037037
5721813,1,B00CFQBQ6E,This movie is lacking a strong developed theme.  The story meanders along as if the writer was trying to figure out what to do next at each turn in the events that occur.  The actors are weak in creating their characterization of the characters they are supposed to animate.  If you decide to watch this poor excuse of a movie then you are wasting 4 dollars.  I am disappointed in this movie and in relying on those write ups that gave high marks for this failure of a movie.,1376524800,3,475,4.303370786516854
5721814,2,B00CFQBQ6E,THIS FILM WAS A FARCE IT REALU HAD VERY LITTLE TO DO WITH CRUSADERS.  A C MOVIE AT BEST. I8T WAS BOARING,1376438400,,104,3.727272727272727
5721815,5,B00CFQBQ6E,"I don't usually go for this kind of film, but was surprisingly pleased to watch this.

The production values are high, and the wide shots of the beautiful European countryside are breathtaking.

I am always happy to stumble upon rare, previously unavailable films, and this fit the bill.",1375747200,,287,4.958333333333333
5721816,1,B00CFQBQ6E,"There goes another $3.99 out the window. Ten minutes into the flick was all I could take. A few fast forwards hoping I was mistaken and finally the pain was over. The only redeeming feature in this movie are the locations were it was filmed. Everything else was second and third rate at best. Its only entertainment value is in watching people like myself squirm in discuss at having wasted money on another monotonous B movie, which there seem to be a lot of these days. If you've more money than sense or no sense at all this could be the movie for you.",1375142400,,555,4.346153846153846
5721817,3,B00CFQBQ6E,"The art on the dvd box is pretty misleading. It shows Daniel Auteuil crouching with sword and shield while armies battle in front of a castle in the background. The last sentence on the back of the box says ""Prepare yourself for a descent into a brutal hell, where armies clash and blood flows like rivers, and where a sharp blade is the only means of defense against an army of evil."" None of that happens in the movie. The movie starts out with a young boy named Felix who read stories of the hero knight turned mercenary and wants to accompany him and learn to become a knight himself. The knight is on a mission to return a squire to the Pope for money meanwhile another knight/mercenary and his 20 or so men (maybe that's the army the cover talked about?) is also in pursuit of the squire. The story revolves mostly around the knight and how he's really not what he's cracked up to be in the stories the kid read with his shady past and what not. There's only a handful sword fighting scenes so if you're looking for some epic battles you won't find it here. All and all it's still a good story though. Only thing that kind of irked me about the movie is that it's english dubbed. The dubbing is terrible. I wish there was an option in the set up to just have it with english subtitles instead.",1374537600,2,1299,4.284552845528455
8581397,2,B00CFQBQ6E,Don't expect to see anything like what the movie cover description.  Hardly any action.  Strange movie.  Some reviews attribute the low ratings to the dubbing as opposed to having subtitles.  I was falling asleep during this movie.,1508544000,,231,5.162162162162162
8581398,2,B00CFQBQ6E,Not very good plot,1464393600,,18,3.75
8581399,1,B00CFQBQ6E,acting stunk,1431388800,,12,5.5
8581400,1,B00CFQBQ6E,Should be offered free of charge.  The movie did not meet my expectations that was based on the brief description that was provided.  I was very disappointed.,1426636800,,158,4.814814814814815
8581401,1,B00CFQBQ6E,"There was not enough liquor to deaden the pain.  The movie was awful!  After I saw it all the way through, I simply threw it in the trash.  I normally pass DVDs on to friends.  This one I could not.",1421712000,,198,3.875
8581402,3,B00CFQBQ6E,"I have not finish it, no subtile.",1418428800,,33,3.857142857142857
8581403,1,B00CFQBQ6E,Perhaps the worst film I have ever tried to watch.  Amazon should be ashamed for charging a fee.,1414540800,,96,4.333333333333333
8581404,1,B00CFQBQ6E,there isn't anything positive i can say....awful,1405987200,,48,6.0
8581405,4,B00CFQBQ6E,"This movie caught me unaware. The first few moments seemed chaotic and a bit rushed for this genre but what followed was a pleasant, well filmed, interesting and believable medieval romp through 14th century France. Not many reviews here yet I feel the overall rating for a film of this quality is far too low to be accurate. There are few films in this genre that do not succumb to the tendencies to stick to the old formulas, big explosions, excessive posturing and the suspension of disbelief. I own the criterion bluray of Marketa Lazorova, a film which is critically acclaimed, mind you. Dragon Knight shares a lot of it's qualities with that film. The pacing, straight-forward acting, realistic period detail and dialogue are all present, as well as the sparse combat action. The scenic landscapes and settings are priceless in both films and tend to add authenticity to a good but not great story line. Much better IMHO than quite a few more expensive, more widely advertised movies of this type. 4 stars.",1392595200,,1012,4.82183908045977
8581406,1,B00CFQBQ6E,"This is not a B movie, it is Z movie! The story is lousy and they should have left it in French for the dubbing is horrendous. I cannot believe that an actor as good as Daniel Auteuil accepted to play in it. Do not get fooled by the photo on the cover of the DVD!",1390435200,,263,3.7142857142857144
