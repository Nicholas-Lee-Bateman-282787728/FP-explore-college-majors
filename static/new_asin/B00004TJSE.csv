1350576,4,B00004TJSE,"I ordered this DVD ...just last week, and I am happy to report I received the 5 episode DVD. There is a lot of different information in the previous reviews as to just how many episodes this DVD will contain...specifically, will you get the 3 episode edition that ""forgets"" to include 109-110 (2 great eps in my opinion...great background/character driven episodes)
Well, I called the source...Funi. According to the rep there, this DVD was officially re-released about 6 months ago, and they are now ONLY distributing the 5 episode version. ...P>AS far as the DVD itself, the Trunks saga is probably my favorite to date (of course, I am relatively new to this DBZ craze)...the DVD is done well, not a lot of frills, but hey, it's packed with 5 episodes. And it's a great lead in to the Androids Saga (available ...as a box set...also a great view)
Hope this helped.",1052784000,12,866,4.703947368421052
1350577,5,B00004TJSE,"I just received my DVD from Amazon a few days ago and I am glad to say it is the new version that includes all 5 episodes 106-110.  I am writing this review to update the info posted by Amazon which appears to be out of date.  This is one of my favorite DBZ DVDs to date because of the variety.  There is not much fighting, but after the mind numbing repetitiveness of the earlier Frieza series, where they managed to stretch a 5 minute battle over several DVDs, this is a very welcome break.
This is the correct info from the back of my DVD
TRUNKS - Prelude to Terror [Ep. 106, 107, 108, 109, 110]
Welcome Back Goku - After handily beating Frieza and his evil father, King Cold, the mysterious stranger announces the exact time and place of Goku's arrival on Earth. But can this young Super-Saiyan predict the future?! Gohan and the others are determined to find out!
Mystery Revealed - After testing Goku in combat, the mysterious stranger reveals his true identity! But what does his timely arrival portend?! In a startling conversation with Goku, this powerful emissary from the future tells all!
Goku's Special Technique - The future has been written -- or has it? That's what Goku and the rest of the Z Fighters must decide as they learn of Trunks' ominous warning. The Androids are coming! And they just might be bringing the end of the world along with them!
Z Warriors Prepare - Gohan's learning some new tricks. Vegeta is pushing himself to the breaking point, and Yamcha's struggling just to keep up as everyone prepares to face the looming Android menace! But will all of these preparations be enough?
Goku's Ordeal - Chi-Chi wants a car! And Goku must take a day off from training to enroll in driving school! These two mighty warriors may be the Earth's only chance of survival, but what are the chances they'll learn how to parallel park?",1039564800,10,1853,4.558558558558558
1350578,5,B00004TJSE,"First off, I just need to say whoa.  This is the best DBZ DVD avaliable to date.  The DVD's format is great and these episodes introduce a crucial character to the story, Trunks, but this isn't the reason I give it five stars.  Have any of you noticed that there are two episodes missing between this DVD and the Android episodes?  Funimation has recently revamped this DVD to include five episodes, instead of coming out with a two episode DVD.  Compared to any other DVD in the series, this is simply beautiful.  I feel for you who have already blown [the money] on the three episode version of this, but with the price cut and the extra episodes it's worth the second purchase.",1018828800,2,680,4.487804878048781
1350579,5,B00004TJSE,"This movie is totally awesome, but you should watch 'Mysterious Youth' before this. (You'll have a better understanding) My friend told me about DBZ and at first I thought I'm really not going to like this but I watched it to please her. Now I'm hooked on it! Trunks is soooooo HOT! Even for an animation! I like the way he tells Freeza, ""Oh I know what I'm up against...and believe me I'm not scared!"" ^_~ You have to watch this and 'Mysterious Youth' The thing I like most about DBZ is that almost all of the episodes have a funny part! ...",1018742400,,542,4.271844660194175
1350580,4,B00004TJSE,"This video finally shows that freeza-sama dies at the hands of a super saiya-jin.  I personally loved seing what happens to King Cold-sama. I won't say anything else because you just have to see it to believe it. However, if it wasn't for the Japanese dialogue this DVD I would not recommend buying it.",1016755200,,302,4.592592592592593
1350581,4,B00004TJSE,"For the first time in the Dragonball Z series, the plot switches from a bunch of super fighters in karate suits flying around trying to outsmart each other like G.I. Joes to a deeper storyline involving personal reflections and the power one person has to make a difference in the world; enter Trunks Briefs, the Mysterious Super Saiyan that defeated the mighty Frieza in a flash.  He has come from 20 years in the future; a future terrorized by ruthless androids without a goal, or even compassion for the lives they take.  Trunks becomes one of the deepest characters in the entire series.  The first video of the Trunks saga begins with yet another return of the shameless Frieza and barely introduces Trunks, who gives Frieza his just deserts.  In this tape Goku returns for comic relief and a heroic leader presence and we are FINALLY truly introduced to Trunks as a person.  He leave the Z Fighters and returns to his own time, now veiwed not as the Mysterious Youth, but as a brave young man who has sacrificed life and limb to change what ""might have been"" and make a better world.",1011398400,,1089,4.592783505154639
1350582,5,B00004TJSE,"Trunks:Prelude to Terror was another excellant Dragonball Z video. Eric Johnson, the voice actor who portrays Trunks, does a wonderful job of bringing real depth of emotion to his character,he realistically conveys all of Trunks rage and suffering of having lived in a future dystopia ruled by sadistic, bloodthirsty Androids, and his hope for a better future. On the down side, the battle with King Cold was, sadly, no contest, one would have expected a better fight from Frieza's father, but Trunks defeated him in less than five minutes, without even getting his hands dirty. And killing someone who's injured and begging for his life is something I just can't stomach, even if he is evil. Other than that it was an excellant and often humorous video, Goku insulting Vegeta's hated pink shirt, Yamcha's terror at the thought of marriage, Goku laughing out of control learning of Trunks' mismatched parentage, and Krillin suddenly becoming a big headed ladies-man when he put on Roshi's sunglasses, to name just a few scenes.",1006732800,,1027,5.047058823529412
1350583,4,B00004TJSE,"The beginning of this DVD was filled with some great action.  After that, there is a good conversation between Trunks and Goku.  I don't know if I'd want to watch this over and over again though.",1006387200,,195,4.388888888888889
1350584,5,B00004TJSE,"In this episode, the mysterious youth reveals his real name.  TRUNKS!  He tells Goku that his old nemesis, Dr. Gero, Trunks came from the future to warn Goku and the others of even greater threat.  Trunks tells Goku from this new terror that they've killed Piccolo, Vegeta, Yamch, Tien, Krillin and 13 years later they get Gohan.  Also, Trunks gives Goku an antidote for a future heart virus he's going to get.",992822400,,410,4.652777777777778
1350585,5,B00004TJSE,this was 1 of funimations better dbz dvd's it was especially cool that trunks is starring in his 2nd dvd where he is on  the cover in this dvd he meets goku and tests goku's strength we also find out that his parents are VEGETA and BULMA (amazing),992736000,,247,4.145833333333333
1350586,5,B00004TJSE,"This tape starts off with a mysterois young boy destroying the monster Frieza!  Well if that's a shocker than you'll be surprised by how fast the young boy disposes of King Cold!  After the Super Saiyan takes care of the two vilians he looks at the whole Z gang ofering them to come wait for Goku to arrive on Earth.  Well when Goku arrives the mystery boy asked to see Goku alone.  As they talk it turns out the boy is realy Vageta and Bulma's son from the future!  Well if you think that's a shock then you should hear what else he has to say, and it is not preaty.  As the boy leaves he gives Goku an antidote to save him from the evil heart virus that will kill him in the future.  After Trunks leaves Piccolo tells the story of what trunks said to the rest of the gang so they all get ready train for the evil Androids.  Oh and Goku tells his story of what happened to him after he took out Frieza.  He also learned a new technique but you'll have to find out abou that on your own.",992131200,6,987,4.02051282051282
1350587,5,B00004TJSE,"Well, Dragon Ball Z is not an Anime for children, it is true we may include all people ages to see this Anime, but we must see it in a different way. We must feel it, see it, hear it, sense it ... DBZ takes us to the deepest of our imagination. We must be able to aprecciate from every point ouf view -- Soundtracks, Animations, Originality, Imagination, The Perfect Atmoshpere --that it transmits us !
This DVD can show us some of that magic potion ! :) The Japanese Version is the true Dragon Ball Z, it's unique !! The voices, the sounds, the musics ! The image is very good considering the DBZ age, only the sound could be in 5.1 ... but, that wouldn't be the original ! :) The English Version in some aspects does not deserve commentaries, the english soundtrack is very bad ! that's not DBZ ! That's some of the american cartoons BGM music ! DDDUUUHHHH ! Truely not good ! The only thing that is worth are the characters voices, they are +/- good but ok ... Well we also have some Extras ! A 20 minute Recap of all the DBZ history till the episodes in this DVD ... as well as some commercials of some DBZ Sagas in VHS, Toys, and the Official DBZ site ! :) ... The Menu is +/- animated but overall this DVD is worth ... because it has that magic potion I talked to you a little while ago ... :) Specially in the Japanese Version !  This DVD has 3 Episodes, from the death of Freeza on by the hands of Trunks till the beggining of the training to face the Androids ! Enjoy ! :)
Well, hope this review has helped you, and sorry if it was too long. But DBZ deserves this and a lot more ... it was ... it is ... and it will always be part of my life ... and GRAB this idea ... Dragon Ball Z is not a cartoon for children who watch TV when they come home from school ... ... ... ... ... it is an Art that shows one thing ! ... Life is worth living it !
Bye everyone ! :)",990316800,,1870,3.9340369393139842
1350588,5,B00004TJSE,"I enjoyed the japanese version very much. I live in Europe and I always had to watch the french dubbed and cut version of the DB Trilogy. To be honest, the dub sucked and the cut even more. Finally i can lay my hands on the original, sooooooo much better version! You lucky americans! Thanx amazon for world wide shipping!",976579200,,322,4.383333333333334
1350589,4,B00004TJSE,"After he cuts Frieza in half on the last episode, whats left then to cut him into tiny pieces, and blow him up. King Kold helplessly watches in horror. Hes next. In his nutshell of a brain, he thinks Trunks only killed Frieza cos of his sword. King Kold asks Trunks to see it, and then attacks him with it. He didn't get very far, cos Trunks stops him in his tracks by holding the sword back. He then shoots him in the stomache, and (only in the uncut version) blood shoots out of his mouth. He then blows him up, then he destroys Frieza and his dad's spaceship. He then turns back from Super Saiyan to Saiyan, and asks the Z Fighters to wait with him for Goku's arrival.  They wait for 2 hours, and Goku finally comes back. Trunks tells him about the andriods, and that hes the son of Vegeta and Bulma(Goku thinks thats histarical). He then leaves in his spaceship, bidding farewells to everybody. After Trunks is gone, Piccolo informs Goku that he heard everything. ""What did he say Goku?"" -- ""oh, nothing that important."" -- ""Thats funny!"" (Piccolo) ""It all sounded pretty important to me"" -- Piccolo then tells everybody what Trunks said to Goku (except that his name is Trunks, and hes the son of Vegeta and Bulma). Goku shows everybody his newest techineque (Instant transformation), and everybodys off to training for the arrival of the Andriods.",975024000,,1353,4.567901234567901
1350590,5,B00004TJSE,I would recommend buying this uncut because you see Freiza split in two and they also cut some blood out to. Really cool. It does drag on a bit but it still rocks.,972777600,,163,3.9696969696969697
1350592,4,B00004TJSE,"Finally, we get to see DBZ in its uncut format and in original Japanese dialogue. The American voices have gotten better, but they just can't compare to the Japanese vocals especially when doing power moves. The dvd is nicely done with the usual features...Play movie, chapter search/select, bonus material, and language/subtitle select. This being my first purchase of the newer DBZ discs, I didn't know that there are two sets of subtitles. One set is for the English vocals and the other is for the Japanese track. No wonder the subtitles kept going eventhough there were no Japanese vocals to be heard. The picture quality is as clear as you can get, but you will notice that the quality of the dbz episodes has degraded over the years. Maybe someone will start remastering these over time cause they do need it. Still, it's a great dvd. Trunks arrival and his conversation with Goku over who his parents were is priceless. You get to see just how much the Z fighters love to challenge themselves in fighting as thye begin their training. DBZ has never been a deep series, but it's fun to watch for fighter type anime aficionados.",972604800,8,1134,4.732323232323233

1350594,5,B00004TJSE,"This is what the American Dragonball community has be salivating for, for  years now.  Pure, uncut, original music and dialouge.  Everything that  makes the series great is here, and it's the beginning of the best saga in  DBZ in my opinion.  A Must Buy!",968976000,2,254,4.659090909090909
1350595,4,B00004TJSE,"Not all that much more, I was impressed with this newer batch of DVD's,  and hope the next bunch comes out this good...  It says I can't spoil the  plot, but that means that I really can't say much about the little quirks  in the DVDs, which mostly are little purist things to begin with...  When  the Cell Saga comes up, we have some huge moments though, and I think the  DVD's really let the American viewer see them the way they were meant to be  seen (Yea, that music in the FUNi dub isn't the original) and the very very  cool ""Unmei no Hi (Spirit Versus Spirit)"" moment, which shouldn't  give anything away, but spark a fire for these DVD's to come out.",968976000,,659,4.241935483870968
1350596,2,B00004TJSE,"Now, I am a collector of anime anad have been a big fan of Dragon Ball Z for a long time. But I would beg you to see the real Dragon Ball Z before  buying this chopped up, edited version. I know that it says uncut, but it's  really not. I'm not saying that violence is good or anything, but I am  saying that this was a show that was originally meant for adults in Japan  and was brought over seas by Funimation and turned into a little kiddie  show. If you do not want to see the real Japanese version, then be my guest  and buy this video, but if you would like to see the real thing, pick it up  at your local comic book shop. But, since Funimation is clearly not going  to ever bring the real thing over seas in subtitled, uncut Japanese, then  DBZ will never have the charm that it was meant to have.",965865600,3,805,3.98125

Afterwards,  Trunks reveals to Goku who he is and why he came from the future. The news  is startling and not all of it is good. He reveals the horror he lives in  and that it will haunt Goku and his friends soon. We also get to see the  Z-fighters begin their training in anticipation of the androids that are  coming.

1350600,5,B00004TJSE,"Plot Summary: After single-handedly defeating Frieza and King Cold, the mysterious stranger announces the exact time and place of Goku's return to Earth - two hours in advance. The Z warriors ponder just who he is and what  his plans are, when Goku suddenly arrives, just as predicted. The youth  wastes no time, immediately asking to speak with Goku privately. After a  quick test to prove that Goku is all he's said to be, the stranger reveals  who he is and his mission here. After his departure, the story is related  to the rest of the Z fighters, and we also find out at long last just how  Goku managed to survive the destruction of Namek.
Comments: This tape  sets the stage for the Android series, and includes several great action  scenes as well, which immediately increases its entertainment value. Fans  familiar with the original Japanese episodes will notice a significant  amount of alterations to the dialogue, but only a handful are really  glaring, and even those aren't enough to truly detract from this great  tape. Anyone even remotely into DBZ will want to pick this one up, as it is  both entertaining and informative in that it introduces us to plot elements  that will be key in many more episodes to come.",963187200,4,1232,4.723004694835681

Frieza comes with his daddy named King Kold. Trunks defeats both of  them. He knows that Goku is coming and waits for him. HE was supposed to  wait for three hours (I think). He talks to goku and gives him medicine so  he won't die from a heart attack. Now, if they didn't show on the video,  this is a spoiler: Trunk's is the son of Vegeta and his mama is Bulma(she  didn't marry Yamcha! Boohoo!). This is also the start of the whole Cell  saga. I've seen almost all of the Dragon Ball z episodes (I missed a few  from the cell saga) and I think  that the Majin Buu saga is the best. I  could see all of this because Thailand is in Asia and they show it  practically everywhere in Asia. The only bad thing was that I could only  understand a little(about 40%) because it is in Thai and I don't know a lot  .  well, this what I think of this tape.",961545600,6,999,3.984848484848485

If anyone knows where to get the 5 episode DVD, I would be greatly in your debt.",1323648000,,249,4.1020408163265305
7922662,4,B00004TJSE,"This dvd is a must for dbz fans. It even has 5 episodes instead of 3 and that is awesome. I would buy this trunks dvd because in my opinion it is one of the best sagas on dbz.

My only problem with the dvd is that the picture seems kinda grainy. It seems like the picture could be clearer and fine tuned but this also beats the 3 episode VHS version by far. So if you want the trunks saga, be sure to buy them on dvd.",1132012800,2,417,3.7386363636363638

7922664,5,B00004TJSE,"This DVD comes with 5 spectacular episodes, making it an excellent edition to your Dragon Ball Z Collection. The first episode concludes Trunks's fight with King Kold. (Well, it technically shows the final death of Frieza, but that is also shown in the previous DVD along with the rest of the fight.) Anyway, the first episode on this DVD has the fight with King Kold and then the part where Trunks takes everyone to meet Goku. In the second episode, Trunks and Goku talk and he reveals some pretty astounding secrets. Make sure to watch the third episode in Japanese, if you decide to watch any of them in Japanese. The English one actually says completely incorrect information. (Yeah right, it won't take them three years to collect the Dragon Balls.)
Anyway, that's the first three episodes. The other two are filler but still very fun to watch. (Actually, they are some of the best, specifically the second.) The fourth episode on this DVD details how everyone prepares for the upcoming battle, including Vegeta's training in 400G. It's pretty exciting to watch all that happens. The last episode has Goku and Picollo learning to drive, which is really funny and exciting too. As for the DVD itself, it has no bonus features, but most Dragon Ball Z fans should be used to this. It is a great DVD to buy, so make sure you do!",1074729600,4,1329,4.659574468085107
7922665,5,B00004TJSE,"I bought this DVD expecting to receive the later version with all 5 episodes like other customers who wrote reviews did. However, about a week before christmas I received it and it only had 3 episodes on it. I was very disappointed and sent it back and purchased it somewhere else that had the copy with all 5 episodes. Amazon was fair regarding the return and is suppose to reimburse me - even for the return shipping. Just make sure you call or verify somehow that the copy you are purchasing has all 5 episodes if that's what you are looking for.
The Trunks saga is by far some of mine and my sons favorite episodes. Definetly a must have for any DBZ fan.",1073174400,6,658,4.314516129032258
