I must say that it is a good and competant piece of film making. But I must also say that it is not 'great'. I am really kind of middle of the road about it so I gave it a 3 star review. It lacked a lot of the laughs that I thought we might see but it did show the 'Catch-22's', the run around and the almost ridiculous rat race that is Hollywood.

I would recommend it to fans of the show and to fans of documentaries. It is not for everybody.",1201564800,,571,3.7983193277310923
7958655,4,B0000633TT,"While my initial reason for buying this movie stemmed from watching the hilarious Kenny vs Spenny show I found that Pitch was a deeper look at the 2 men- Kenny Hotz and Spencer Rice, and their plight in Hollywood. If you are looking for the same sort of jousting against one another as on KvsS you will not find it here although the squabbles in the movie seem to forshadow what was to come. The movie is great, and it shows just how hard it is to do ANYTHING in the 'biz.' The ending left me feeling for the guys but as any K & S fan would know, the discouragement they faced in Pitch did not stop them. We got Kenny vs Spenny and I am looking forward to see Kenny's newest movie ""The Papal Chase."" I think this movie belongs in the collection of any fan of Kenny & Spenny.",1125792000,5,774,4.098684210526316
7958656,4,B0000633TT,"This isn't an Al Pacino movie, but an independent film by two wannabe film makers (Spencer Rice and Kenny Hotz) who are caught in the act of disrupting the Toronto International Film Festival to sell a comedy script they had written about a Mafia Godfather's accidental sex change. Anyone interested in the movie business or writers trying to sell a script will love this comedic 81 minute documentary.
This 1997 film includes cameos by: Al Pacino, Matt Dillon, Roger Ebert, Eric Stoltz, Ileana Douglas, Fred Williamson, Norman Jewison, Arthur Hiller, Neil Simon
This was originally released on DVD in August 2001. Maybe this 2002 version will contain more supplemental materials than the trailer and film maker bios?",1014595200,13,717,5.136752136752137
