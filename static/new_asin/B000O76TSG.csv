8183274,5,B000O76TSG,What can I say?  It has Brink Stevens in it!  Winner!  Plus a chemistry set is used in this movie.  Cuddle up to your partner; make mad passionate love; and ignore the movie.  If you do not ignore it then your brain will turn in to pudding.,1504656000,,240,4.0212765957446805

8183276,1,B000O76TSG,"AVOID AT ALL COST (this, coming from a b-movie fan). Soundtrack is unique, but when the music plays I feel like Im at a personal concert, and when theres dialogue, I feel like Im at a library and listening to it from half the hall over. The music in this movie is also overplayed, and almost exhausting. The plot itself is non-existant, which is disappointing. The first five minutes sets up this intriguing premise that greys were created to govern men, then were killed, and now these immortal women are recruiting the assistance of a laboratory (operated by 2 men) to clone the DNA and implant it in a pregnant woman to resurrect this second coming of the Grey reign. The following 75 minutes is comprised of 5-10 minute meaningless displays of strip dances, naked women rubbing each other (extremely repetitively and monotonously), maybe a sex scene... And then maybe a full 30 seconds of random plot devices peppered throughout (WE HAVE TO DO THIS BEFORE MIDNIGHT! stands out in my head... why before midnight? Why not tomorrow?) Just a trainwreck of a movie. I wasn't expecting an excess of nudity (didnt read the reviews prior, big mistake), but Ive never been more disappointed in it when it was in my face for an hour and a half. Ive seen adult films with deeper plots than this, and with better acting to boot. If you want to be bored, or train yourself on the virtue of patience, watch this. Otherwise, move on to something better.",1398988800,,1442,4.658823529411765
