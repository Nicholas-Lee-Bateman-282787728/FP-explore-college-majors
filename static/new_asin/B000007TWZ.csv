This is a kewl band and the video captures that. The songs & lyrics make ya think. In a way, they're the opposite of the Smiths. Morrisey has a way of making stuff sound depressing (when it's not) and TBS make everything sound jolly & happy & upbeat (when they're not). 'Woman in the wall' is a good example of that (dealing with a murder) but listening to their albums reinforced that with others too (36D, old red eyes is back, bell bottomed tear etc). I agree with the other reviewers; this is a must-have.",998611200,,647,4.4
7905293,5,B000007TWZ,A fantastic video for any South fan! It's brillant from beginning to end (especially the last song  Woman in the wall).,945820800,,119,4.666666666666667
