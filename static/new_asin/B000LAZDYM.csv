8160470,5,B000LAZDYM,"i used to think this movie was the best, i had an open mind and i viewed the messages in this movie with such
i watched it at least once a month, sometimes twice and it really brings back old memories when i look at the box art for it here on amazon, but sadly im an old prune now at the age of 39, and i don't got time to relive the fun of my youth by buying this movie and watching it again
im old i got kids and im a christian so this sorta *evil* content doesnt work for me anymore, i would rather recommend a movie for those with *mature* tastes, like Oklahoma!, Carousel, South Pacific, The King and I, Flower Drum Song, The Sound of Music and many other movies that only appeal to those over the age of 70 and living in asorted nursing homes

or in real life we can also discover that growing up has nothing to do with your taste in movies and just say that as we grew up we found bigger and better things, regardless this movie is one of the fondest memories of my youth and im very happy that its out on dvd so i can relive what i never really thought id get to see again... how if they can just bring back the old mego toys id be set",1190678400,,1143,3.8846153846153846
8160471,4,B000LAZDYM,"Here in the Western Hemisphere we (collectively as a people) have a mis-conception about animation. When whe hear the term 'Animation' we immediately think 'childish' or 'kids-stuff', well this simply is not the case... never has been.
  YES most animation in the past 30 years has been geared towards children; but what about the great shorts that pre-ceded the cinimatic features of yesteryear? Geared towards adults. Much of the humour in old Bugs Bunny and Tom & Jerry cartoons is lost on the young or has been censored out.
  Rock 'n' Rule is an animated movie that attempts to bridge that old schizm. No, it's not perfect... but it is damn good. The music DOES fit and it is a single coherent story.",1188777600,,705,4.7073170731707314
8160472,3,B000LAZDYM,"I suppose that this was Canada's attempt to repeat the success of Heavy Metal.  Unfortunately, Rock and Rule falls quite short of HM's status.  The songs are supplied by certified geniuses, Rick Nielsen/Cheap Trick, Lou Reed, Debbie Harry and Iggy Pop, but all of these artists were at a nadir at the time of this movie.  While their worst songs are still much better than most artists' best songs, those used in the movie just aren't great and they don't fit into the movie really well.  It is hard to determine if the songs were meant to relay plot aspects or are merely background mood setters.  The lone exception is Lou's ""My Name is Mok"", perhaps the highlight of the film.

Basically, Mok is a super rocker who wants to bring in a demon from another dimension but needs a voice of specific timbre to make it happen.  If that sounds cheesy, you should hear the dialog.  The ""humor"" is sophomoric and most adults will find the script asinine.  After all, the characters are mutated rats, cats and dogs (though I can't tell which are which).  I guess I was in a different mind frame 20 years ago when I first watch this film.  That being said, fans of REAL animation will probably enjoy it.  No annoying CGI here!  The animation and ""My Name is Mok"", coupled with nostalgia, are the reasons that I can warrant the three stars.  For better plot lines and music, check out HM or American Pop.",1177459200,,1394,4.50199203187251
