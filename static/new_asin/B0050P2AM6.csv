8451588,3,B0050P2AM6,"I am rating this 3 stars because while the subject matter and Hillman's presentation of it is 5-star (or maybe 4-star), the majority of the DVD is comprised of audience members asking him questions (sometimes ad nauseam). Unfortunately, this is so weighed down by audience participation that it takes away from the brilliance of the subject matter. There are really only a few questions/observations by audience members that add anything of significance to the discussion.

One thing is certain: this 2-DVD set is ridiculously overpriced for what you are getting. It could have easily been edited down to 1 DVD by editing out much of the audience participation.",1388966400,4,661,5.12037037037037
