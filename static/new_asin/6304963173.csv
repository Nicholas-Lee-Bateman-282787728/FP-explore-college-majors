950261,5,6304963173,"Vittorio De Sicca's heartbreaking film, The Bicycle Thief, is by far the best film of all time.  Strong acting, direction, and a story that moves swiftly and ends all to soon.  You are abrubtly drawn emotionaly to this  film and it's charcters.  Just goes to show, they don't make em like they  used to.",932688000,2,303,4.537037037037037
950262,1,6304963173,"All right, I've read some great reviews for this movie, (granted it was very well directed) but 1.5 dreary hours of this guy looking for his bike is not my idea of entertainment.  They didn't give us anything.  They could  have at least had the boy triumphantly say, ""Oh poppa, look... I finda  the bell!""  And oh how joyous their night without sheets would have  been!  Every now and again they would give you a glimmer of hope (hope that  the movie was going somewhere) when Rici finds a lead, but it always ends  up being a dead end.  I thought the point of movies was to entertain, not  to remind you that life can suck.  I think most people out there believe  that life sucks without the help of brooding Italian film makers.  The  movie should have ended after about 40 minutes on the one minor high note  it had: It was in the restaurant when Rici realized that life can suck when  you're poor but 'what can ya do?'  So he splurged on a nice meal and some  wine to get himself and his prepubescent son drunk! (The movie barely gets  one star for the excellent directing)",932601600,14,1077,4.316582914572864
950328,1,6304963173,"I understand the film to be a representation of a certain genre of what is called Italian neo-realism. I also understand the film-makers had no intention of making this as 'entertainment.' However, the bleak despair of the film is not one that appeals personally to me. Artistically and as a piece of film-making, it is can be fascinating, but the story is one of despair, frustration and hopelessness that pretty much ends right back where we start in the beginning. I understand the film could be of interest to both film students and to students of intellectual history, so I'm not discounting it, just giving a personal reaction. Rather than watch this movie, I think my time would have been better spent reading the works of Flannery O'Connor.",1474761600,2,748,4.8515625

On the surface, it's about a desperate, impoverished man's hunt for a stolen bicycle; getting it back means keeping his job and supporting his family. Dig a little deeper, this Italian neorealist film shows the viewer what it's like to be a poor person up against, swallowed by, then spat out by the system during 40s era war-torn Rome. That ending is really something. Generally hailed as a masterpiece, and I couldn't agree more.",1444262400,3,510,5.083333333333333

However, it was odd that this man  sought almost every avenue available to him in order to locate the bike- even theft, but two wrongs don't make a right.  It is difficult to say whether or not I would have done the same thing or not. I would have taken more care in safe-guarding the bike, that is, he asked a small child to watch the bike when his wife went in the building to pay the psychic.

950447,3,6304963173,"In Rome, Italy in 1948, the economy is depressed and jobs are very few. A former bricklayer manages to get a job putting up posters, but he needs his bicycle back from a pawn shop, and trades in his bedding for it. On the first day of his job, a young man finds his bicycle and steals it. The man, who has a wife, son, and baby, desperately searches for it.

The man goes to the police, but can do no more than file a complaint, and they won't waste valuable time looking for a stolen bicycle. His young son helps him, along with some dopey friends of his, but no luck. They go to a church, to a clairvoyant, and get no results. Even finding the thief fails-they cannot prove he did it. The movie ends with the man broken by his sufferings.

The movie is said to be Marxist, but it is difficult to understand why. The implied message is that the law, elected politicians, the church, even a group of political agitators, give this poor man no relief. The movie tells what doesn't help the protagonist, but does not say what would. The movie may attack religion, democracy, and capitalism, but that is all it does. A relic rather than a classic.",1434672000,,1144,4.316279069767442
950448,5,6304963173,"Very high on my list of favorite films of all time, Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves packs an emotional punch every time I see it.  As opposed to many neorealist films of the time (many of which I also greatly admire) which tended to focus on poverty as though it were an insurmountable force of nature, and which viewed the struggles of the poor working man through an almost morbidly romantic lens, De Sica and screenwriter Cesare Zavattini examine the same subject in a way that points the finger squarely at the individual and at society at large for creating and perpetuating the hardships that the characters endure.  This is true not only for Bicycle Thieves, but for De Sica/Zavattini's other neorealist projects as well.  The result is a poignant examination of human nature that prods at our own conscience while we are forced to ask ourselves how far we would be willing to lower ourselves to fulfill our own basic needs of survival.  De Sica's films are usually devastatingly emotional and quite depressing, but always at their center is a deep and profound love for people and a (perhaps hopeless) wish for everything to work out okay for them.  And always in some ways, there are small victories for the protagonists of his films, even if it wasn't the victory they were looking for.

This Criterion edition of the film is fantastic.  The print and transfer look better than I've ever seen it look, although the film does certainly show its age, with some scratches and lines showing up from time to time.  The audio is fine.. the original mono Italian soundtrack appears to have been cleaned a bit as well, as there is minimal noise or hiss which allows the beautiful score to work its magic free of distractions.  The second disc has promising special features, which I admit I haven't gotten around to viewing yet, and the package also comes with a 75 page booklet with numerous essays, both contemporary to the film and more modern, including writings by director Vittorio De Sica, screenwriter Cesare Zavattini, legendary film theorist Andre Bazin, and Sergio Leone, who as I learned from his essay, had a small cameo in the film.

All in all, this Criterion release is among the best in their entire collection and is a necessary addition to any serious film lover's shelf.",1432857600,5,2295,4.7727272727272725

He later spots the thief and pursues him into a brothel.  A policeman arrives, but cannot do anything.  The closing of the movie is a very powerful ending when he is tempted to steal a bicycle himself, continuing the cycle of theft and poverty among the lower level economic class.  The story is so direct.  The character is driven by class and economic need.  The film is in Italian with English subtitles.  In the starting part of the film, he comes out of the crowd.  In the concluding part of the film, he goes back in the crowd.  A viewer of the film can feel very sympathetic toward the main character in the film.

Small gestures and petty crimes take on the burdens of fate.  Desperate, relatively negligible decisions lift the protagonist to the status of a tragic hero.

950633,5,6304963173,"Vittorio De Sica s 1948 film Ladri di Biciclette (The Bicycle Thieves) has generated enough acclaim in its life that its hard to justify writing another review of it. Nonetheless, as an aspiring screenwriter, after I came across a 1950 NY Times article by Arthur Miller that praised the film for its simplicity, I though Ladri di Biciclette would be worth examining for the purposes of learning about simple filmmaking. How to make a great film based on a simple story with very few characters. Arthur Miller calls this one-track conflict of a film to be very close to a lyrical masterpiece.

The plot is simple: Jobs are scarce in Rome yet the protagonist Man fortuitously procures one. This job requires a bicycle which the Man also fortuitously procures. During the the Mans first day on the job his bicycle is stolen. The rest of the film focuses on his crusade to find the stolen bicycle and thereby remain employed.

There is a real aesthetic beauty as the Man and his Son tramp the streets, the camera follows, and the city dominates. Rome is so influential that characters lives, their interactions, and their relationships are molded and shaped by her. As the man follows clues to track down his bicycle he transverses what seems like the whole city. Moving from one Roman neighborhood to another, new scenes mean new characters, and new characters mean new conflicts.

There are many touching scenes between the Man and his Son, but one especially where we think the Son has been hurt. This scene reaffirms that the Mans true priorities are first and foremost with his family, but within seconds the Man is pulled right back into the chaos of the hunt for the bicycle. Throughout the entire film injustice reigns, paired with the utter simplicity of the films production, Ladri di Biciclette is a truly remarkable achievement. An example of unadorned, simple cinema.

950774,5,6304963173,"Over the years whenever they come out with a list of the top ten best movies ever made one movie the always seem to place on the list is the 1949 film ""The Bicycle Thief"". Made in Italy by Vittorio De Sica it is a very beautifully written and directed film with a simple but compelling story. It is also a look at post-war Italy rebuilding itself after its defeat in WW II and the economic depression the country faced after the war. The story centers on one man, Antonio, who has been out of work for some time but suddenly is offered a job. There is one hitch to him getting this job however. He needs to have a bicycle to be able to get to work. No bike, no job. Problem for Antonio is he hocked his bicycle awhile back because his family needed the money. Because he is so poor Antonio doesn't have the money to get the bicycle out of the pawn shop. With help from his wife Antonio gets together the cash needed to get back his bike and start his new job the next day. Things start out fine for him on his new job putting up movie posters going from location to location on his bicycle. Then while at one spot up on a ladder putting up a poster a man walks by and steals Antonio's bike. Antonio gives chase but there is no way he can catch up to the thief taking off on his bicycle. Desperate to get his bicycle back Antonio tries everything, from going to the police to report the theft to going to a friend for advice and how he can get his bike back. His life and family depends on Antonio getting his bicycle back. Through it all Antonio is going through every emotion from desperation to despair and everything in between. The film looks at a man slowly losing his dignity as he faces the fact he is going to lose his job thanks to someone stealing his bike. Needing to provide for his family his dignity finally sinks so low Antonio resorts to trying to become a bicycle thief himself.

There is nothing fancy or contrived about this movie. It is straightforward story of a man trying to provide for his family and what happens to him as he does. One factor that makes this movie so good is the actor who plays Antonio, Lamberto Maggiorani. Maggiorani gives a brilliant performance. He gets you to care about him and become involved in his story. What makes his performance even more remarkable is that while he has a presence about him that made Maggiorani look like he was a seasoned actor ""The Bicycle Thief"" was his acting debut. Even more remarkable still was that Maggiorani wasn't even an actor but a steel factory worker who was asked to play the lead part.

If you are a fan of action movies then this won't be the film for you. This is not a fun entertainment kind of movie. This is a movie that looks at and explores human feelings and emotions. It looks at the realities of life and doesn't sugarcoat anything. This is a movie where the action doesn't come from guns being shot or explosions going off or fistfights with karate kicks and punches being thrown. If you want that kind of movie go buy ""The Expendables"". The action in ""The Bicycle Thief"" comes from the spoken word. This movie grabs you by the heart and makes you care about the main character and what is going to happen to him and his family and worry for him as he grows more despondent of his situation. This is a film in its most artistic form. And while action movies like ""The Expendables"" will leave no impressions on you as soon as it is over ""The Bicycle Thief"" will linger in your mind and make you never forget it. Everyone should see this movie at least once. I highly recommend it!",1374105600,,3580,4.302222222222222
950775,5,6304963173,"The setting for this movie is Rome at the close of WWII. There were very few jobs available.
Crowds of unemployed men in search of work and a paycheck huddle in the cold around
each and every viable business in the city. In spite of it all, Italians remained a happy, high energy
people. The story line is realistic as are the main characters. The times were tough.
We see what it means to struggle for food and shelter in order to keep
families afloat.  The photography is striking and beautifully choreographed
early in the movie. The film's visual prowess takes a back seat
to the story line during the later half of the film. The story is simple, its message
is powerful. I recommended it to my daughter who was born in 1973, approximately 30 years after this film was made.
It is tough for her generation to relate to black and white films
and life in the 1940s -the aftermath of a world war. This was a time that was
somber and grey. The story follows the relationship between a father
in pursuit of work and his young son. The father finds a job but must have a bike in order to get to work.
He can't afford public transportation. This happy, optimistic fellow scrapes together the
funds needed to get his bike out of hock. From this point on, the story unfolds.
His bike is stolen along with his ability to provide for his family. After that, the man
finds himself tempted to steal a bike to save his job.  While, I am not inclined to label this
one of the great movies of our times, I recommend it heartily.
It is a poignant film that tells us a great deal about how it was
to live in Rome after World War II with many stores closed,
and both food and jobs were scarce. The man in this story
is a family man. He must come to terms with behaving in a way
that will leave a permanent blot on his father-son relationship.",1372896000,2,1827,4.277456647398844

950777,5,6304963173,"It took a special director to shake the Academy Awards voting panel awake and make them take notice of great foreign films.  Vittorio de Sica did this with Shoeshine, one of the early Neorealismo films (the same year Rome: Open City was released - which is actually considered the first Neorealismo film).  In 1947 the Academy awarded Shoeshine a special/honorary Oscar for best foreign film.  Two years later the Academy would again award de Sica, this time for Bicycle Thieves.

One of the most important elements of this film was de Sica's decision to use only untrained actors (ironically, many went on to appear in later films).  Hence the neo-realistic style.  Other trademarks were (and probably most importantly) stories depicting the struggles of the lower class, the working classes, or the poor.  Also, de Sica shot almost exclusively on location (not using sets). There is a heavy dose of existentialism in this style as well.  So why is this film so important?

Rome Open City really centered around the events taking place in Rome during World War 2.  It was set in a specific time with events that could have only taken place during that time.  Bicycle thieves on the other hand, is a story that could easily be applied to many times, many place, and many people.  The allure of this film is the honest and open look at humanity and their struggles.

The film itself is solid.  The pace is moderate, but rarely does the film seem slow.  And it is really only in comparison to later films that the viewer really sees anything that could be improved upon.  Especially when comparing the film to the later Fellini and Antonioni films.  De Sica was influenced greatly by previous filmmakers (especially Chaplin), and it shows in this film with several shots.  And of course de Sica would leave a lasting impression that would influence filmmakers for decades, and even until today.

Oh and if you can't tell by the title, the film is about a gang of bicycle thieves.  Antonio Ricci is worker trying to secure a job.  He does get an offer, only he must have a bicycle to perform his duties.  His wife pawns several belongings in order to pay back the pawn shop to get his bike out of hock.  During the first few days of his job, his bike is stolen.  Ricci then sets out to find his bicycle, knowing that without it he will lose his job.  In the next day we follow Ricci on his search along with his son.  Ricci seems to find the person who stole his bike, but due to circumstances, can do nothing about it.  The system breaks down for Ricci.  In the end Ricci has a moral choice with major repercussions: does he then steal someone else's bicycle thereby becoming a thief himself and causing another individual to go through the same turmoil he recently experienced?  It's an open ended experience (I won't tell you what happens), and no matter which choice he made the viewer would undoubtedly understand the long term effect here.  One person steals from another who then steals from another and so on.  Where does the cycle end?

Philosophical, thought provoking, and beautifully filmed, Bicycle Thieves is a stellar film.  The Criterion re-release is amazing.  This is perhaps not a film everyone should own, but a film that all fans of 1945-1965 cinema should at least watch once.",1370563200,,3295,4.682926829268292

950780,3,6304963173,"This is a post-WWII story of a poor father searching about Rome for his stolen bicycle, without which he will lose a just-acquired job, after over a year of searching. It's frustrating first because he failed to take any precaution whatsoever to prevent the theft of his bicycle (absent a simple padlock placed on the chain, he could have tied a rope from one wheel to the other), failed to follow up on the address given him by a supposed confederate of the thief's, and constantly went around in circles like he didn't have a brain in his head. Then he constantly loses whomever he is pursuing.

Another frustration - the role of the supposed confederate made no sense whatsoever. The plot didn't need someone to throw the father off the trail - any bicycle that can't easily 'outrun' pursuers isn't worth having.

Finally he's driven to steal someone else's bicycle that's sitting out by itself and being watched. (The hundreds of bicycles massed together awaiting owners at a soccer game would have been a much safer target.)",1360627200,3,1029,4.775280898876405

950835,5,6304963173,"The main body of this film follows a man, Ricci,  as he is searching for his stolen bicycle in the city of Rome. He does not live in the city. He lives outside of the city where he and his family live in poverty. At the beginning of the film, he is offered a job, but the only way for him to do the job. He is able to obtain the bicycle by pawning off some of his families belongings. Ricci starts his work hanging posters around the city the next day. The bicycle is a sign of hope for this family. Ricci and his family have lived in a cycle of poverty their entire lives. Ricci even says early in the film that he has been cursed since the day he was born. The bicycle appears to be a sign that the curse has been lifted. Well, that actually isn't the case because the very first day on the job the bicycle gets stolen. As he is searching for his bike, he turns to the government (the police) to help him, and it does no good. He also turns to religion (a seer) to help him, and that also does no good. Ricci hits rock bottom and think that his only option is to steal someone else's bicycle. He is that desperate. What choice does he have? His only choice is to take matters into his own hands and the only option that seems possible at the time is to steal someone else's bike.

Everything in this movie was very well done. The acting was great. I really liked the little boy who played Ricci's son. The music was very subtle but set the tone for the movie and helped the movie to flow very nicely. It seems to me that the theme of this movie was ""things are bad, but they could be a whole lot worse"".

950836,1,6304963173,"Note: I created another review but I didn't like it. So I created this new review to express my opinion more clearly.

Post-WW2 Italy, 1947. Antonio has finally found a job. It requires putting up posters. But he needs a bike to do it. After selling his bedsheets to get his bicycle out of the pawnshop, he starts his job. At his first day at work, his bicycle is stolen. Antonio is crushed. He has a wife, a baby, and a son less than 10 yrs old to support. The only thing he can do is find his bike. So he and his young son Bruno go in search of the bicycle.

 Note: for a brief moment, I wondered why Ricci didn't borrow money for a new bike from friends or family. A bike costs 6,000 lira. His job has him making 12,000 lira a month. He was good for the money. Still, in movies, as in real life, people hardly ever take the most logical way. That's what makes movies and life so interesting. I guess watching this movie, it depends on the perspective you watch. In Africa, India, and China, for example, people live in worse conditions. I'm sure they would look at this movie and this post-WW2 Italy is a much preferable place to live; especially considering in Africa, China, and India, many people don't have access to electricity, clean water, and unemployment rates are as high as 80% or more. I guess it depends on the perspective a viewer has when watching this film.

A few weeks after watching this film, my depression began to worsen. I was working in a box-making factory from 11pm to 7am Mon-Fri and I hated it. The job was a dead end. My love life was a dead end. My friends were drifting away and I had debts up to my eyeballs. My mother tried to lift me up but I didn't pay any attention to her. A little over a year after seeing the Bicycle Thieves for the first time I saw Nights of Cabiria. That film is about a nave prostitute who never gives up hope that her true love will come one day and bring her happiness. Throughout the movie she is ridiculed, ignored by potential lovers, and treated harshly. Still, she never gives up hope and goes on smiling in face of her troubles. After watching this movie, my depression began to lessen noticeably and I remembered my mother's words, ""If no one loves you. Then you must love yourself. If you do not have the patience to love yourself then why should you expect others to have the patience to love you?""

I liked Nights of Cabiria for its emotionally uplifting tone. The main character has admirable strength and fortitude. She's a prostitute, in the lowest class of society, yet she not only believes she deserves a better life, she actively seeks one. One can only wish her good luck and thank her for her inspiring attitude. After Nights of Cabiria, I don't really care for the Bicycle Thieves. It was too dreary for my taste. Unfortunately, whenever people say this, the intellectuals are quick to pounce on your opinion, ""This movie is meant to make you think. If you want a lot of explosions then watch a typical Hollywood movie with the predictable happy ending.""

The assessment that Hollywood movies always have a predictable happy ending is preposterous. Just look at these films: Psycho; Citizen Kane; Dirty Harry; The Hustler; The Wild Bunch; The Godfather Trilogy; The Postman Always Rings Twice; Carrie; Von Ryan's Express; Night if the Living Dead; Seven; Goodfellas; From Here to Eternity; The Killing; Usual Suspects; Rocky; Saturday Night Fever; The Shining; Planet of the Apes; Sweet Smell of Success; The Defiant Ones; Emperor of the North; The Swimmer; 21 Grams; etc.
I just named 2 dozen Hollywood movies without predictable happy endings. I could name dozens more and most film buffs could too. Yet whenever a European movie gets the label of being dull, people are quick to contrast it with mainstream Hollywood and claim Hollywood is nonsensical and predictable. I never see people use this argument when comparing movies in other countries; it's always with European movies. Honestly, the movies coming from European countries are the bleakest, most depressing, dullest, and nihilistic stuff I've ever seen. I tend to see movies from all over the world too.

Detractors of the Bicycle Thieves will label it dull and depressing. The lovers of the film will say it is intellectually stimulating. However, sometimes a dull movie is just a dull movie. Hollywood movies like Sweet Smell of Success and the Hustler didn't have explosions and the typical Hollywood happy ending. Yet I found those movies intellectually stimulating as well as emotionally uplifting. Can intellectuals stop saying things like, ""if you don't like intellectually stimulating movies then you should watch movies with mindless explosions like Transformers""? That kind of elitist comment turns people off more. Can't someone like Transformers and an intellectual movie like Citizen Kane?

All in all, I don't recommend this movie. I recommend Nights of Cabiria instead. After watching Cabiria, I watched the Bicycle Thieves again. I couldn't stop shouting at the screen, ""Come on, Ricci. Be a man. Your wife and son have more hope than you do. You're supposed to be the father. Be strong and let everyone know things could be all right."" I couldn't believe it. I was actually shouting while watching this dreary movie. Cabiria has a protagonist that has unbreakable strength. It isn't macho, chest-beating bravado. It is quiet dignity that smiles bravely in the face of emotionally trying obstacles. It is an intellectually, emotionally stimulating movie that had a great impact on my life. I hope you'll pick that up instead and enjoy it.",1333065600,9,5602,4.750256937307297

Drama, Crime, 93 minutes, Italian Language
Directed by Vittorio De Sica
Starring Lamberto Maggiorani, Enzo Staiola and Lianella Carell

This film shouldn't work. The story is so simple and the actors aren't professionals. But I kept hearing about the film and gave it a try when I found a copy at my local library. That proved to be one of my better decisions.

The story is set in post-war Rome. Jobs are scarce and people queue desperately each day for the chance to earn enough money to feed their families. Antonio Ricci (Maggiorani) accepts a job one morning, but one of the requirements is a bicycle. Although his has been pawned, he lies and says that he has one. His wife helps him pawn other items and he manages to get the bicycle back. That doesn't sound like much of an event, but it's a triumphant moment in the film.

Antonio is so happy to have the job hanging posters and the joy and relief is evident on his face. We feel happy for him. The problem is, someone steals his bicycle. By this point, we are fully invested in the story and the loss feels personal. We realize how important the bicycle is to his survival. The police don't seem interested so Antonio searches the streets with his son.

The film is ranked No. 85 in IMDBs Top 250 at the time or writing and not one of the films above it has fewer votes. It's a shame that it hasn't been seen by more people. I understand that it's over 60 years old, in black and white, and that the language is Italian, but the story is so pure that it's worth seeing. Let's hope for a Criterion Blu-ray release in the near future.",1330473600,3,1635,4.3861386138613865
950838,5,6304963173,"My daughter turned me onto this movie, which was required watching in her college Italian class.  I was sold when she told me she involuntarily cried a bit in class.  The fact that someone under age 21 could be moved by an old black & white movie in a foreign language sold me.  I'll admit up front that we are an Italian-American family but I don't think you need that ancestry to appreciate this movie.  In its own quiet way, it paints a clear picture of post-WWII Europe -- no food, no jobs, no hope.  When the main character goes to the pawn shop to retrieve his bicycle and you see cavernous rooms full of sheets and other household and personal items that people had to sell in order to survive, it is beyond comprehension for those of us who have grown up in comfort and the relative affulence of the US.  And the little boy in the movie is simply amazing.  He is an old soul occupying a child's body.  Whether he is at his job pumping gas or running around Rome after his father, his little face moves seemlessly from adoration to worry to hurt.  When he is mopping the tears from his face with a handkerchief, I found myself doing the same.  Movies like this should be required viewing so future generations don't lose sight of what happened during the world wars.  When I see all these various ""Occupy"" groups camped out in public places in major cities around the US, pretending to be roughing it in protest against corporate entities, they are still working their modern conveniences of cell phones, ipads and propane stoves.  Suffering and pain depicted in movies like the Bicycle Thief gives you a whole new perspective on your good fortunes.  A great companion piece to read after watching this movie is the book ""Christ in Concrete"" -- the timing is off a bit, but it almost picks up where this movie ends in 1931 New York with the flood of immigrants looking for work.

950840,5,6304963173,"It's great. It's perfect. It's as perfect as a crystal formed in weightless space. It's the purest distillation of Italian neorealismo, defined as ""a style of film set amongst the poor and working class, filmed on location using nonprofessional actors, depicting the difficult economic and moral conditions of post-World War II Italy, reflecting the conditions of everyday life: poverty and desperation."" There isn't a scene or a sound extraneous in ""Ladri di Bicicletti"". It's potently emotional without being in any way sentimental. The realism is absolute; one can say, yes, that was Life in that place and that time. But it's more than a documentation of poverty in post-war Roma; it's a universal story of the balance of needs between a father and a son. It doesn't preach any social agenda or ideology. It just reveals.

The Roma I knew in the mid-1960s was already a 'boom town' compared to the Roma of Vittorio de Sica's 1948 ""Ladri di Bicicletti"". In 1948, the avenues were empty of cars and the banks of the Tiber were all weeds and rubble. There must have been tourists, but they didn't cross the bridges to Trastevere. In the '60s, the same streets were jammed with Fiat 500s and plagued with Vespas rather than bicycles, and today Trastevere is as gentrified as Brooklyn Heights or Boston's South End. But I can testify that the flea market at Porta Portese, on the back side of Trastevere, was exactly the same in 1968 as it's shown in the film. There's the real 'eternal city', though I understand that the flea market only happens on Saturdays now.

Lamberto Maggiorani, the father in 'Bicycle Thieves', was a factory worker with no acting experience before ""Bicycle Thieves"". Even though the film made him modestly famous, he tried to return to factory work, only to find himself as unemployed as his film character. He took to acting as a career out of necessity, and performed in 15 more films from 1948 to 1970 .

This is the bike he needs to keep his job and in turn feed his family. The Bicycle Thieves is an excellent film. Once you start watching it you will not look away. The man and his clever son go on a journey through the city to find the bike. In order to discover what they truly find you will have to watch the film for yourself. The reason for this is because it is the type of film that will relate to people on individual basis. This story could have a different meaning for everyone. It is about life and experience. If you are a fan of film in general you will appreciate The Bicycle Thieves.

It wouldn't have mattered,though. This film is as vital as... No, more vital than... anything brand new. There are no catchphrases or carefully crafted humorous moments telling us how to feel. Heck, even the score is slight and unintrusive. All this leaves the audience with is the brilliant performances recorded for us to enjoy for all time. I re-watched the film recently, and it touched even deeper places than it did in the past... given current worldwide fiscal events.

950914,5,6304963173,"What distinguishes a great film from a very good one?  That is just about impossible for me to define. There is cinematography, sound, script, pacing....all those things.  But for me, what distinguishes a great film from a good one is the manner in which it teaches us about ourselves. Compare the black and white photography of Henri Cartier-Bresson with digital snapshots and you will understand what I mean.

I will tell you this.  In 100 years, this film will still be relevant, even fresh.  In 100 years, William Shakespeare's ""Merchant of Venice"" will be fresh.  Why?  Because the themes and the articulation of those themes in their various mediums are timeless.

Another reason this a great film? The director uses unprofessional actors who offer deeply personal performances that are so realistic.  (The father is a real steelworker in Italy...his son is played by an ordinary boy,  I can't imagine EVER forgetting Lamberto Maggiorani's face - that is how strong his portrayal is).  Quiet heroism, desperation, parent/child bonding, fear....this is what really happens.  And now that we are in a dangerous economic recession, the major theme of the movie resurfaces again. That theme is DIGNITY.  By that I mean dignity under trial...not in a trial in a court of law, but in a trial of the pressures of facing unemployment in an uncaring, urban world.  This was a post-war film.  Italy lost.  So many citizens who belong to the country that loses a war face bitter unemployment when the war is over.  The big generals and the politicians (usually) survive. But the others have to struggle and little choices can mean life or death decisions.

Most people know the general plot of the film...but that is not what makes this film great. It is all in the details.  There is a touching scene when the father Antonio Ricci learns that he has lost his bicycle, yet he takes his young son to a restaurant, and they enjoy a meal of pasta and wine together. Just beautiful.  There is another scene in the rain when the man is standing between students for the priesthood and they talk around him as if he did not exist. Just the look of the students who are weak and girlish versus the man who is rough and proletariat makes a tremendous impression. There is also the scene where Antonio's wife makes the hard decision of sacrificing the sheets upon which the family sleeps to make just enough to help her husband get his bicycle out of the pawn shop; those sheets were her dowry...and the sacrifice is real and noble.

One of the themes of the film is the world of feet versus the world on wheels.  All through the film we see trams and cars and buses and bicycles, and then we see the persons who walk and walk.  It is as if those who can afford
traveling by wheels are in a different class from those traveling by foot.  This was almost a Marxist film without any propaganda - at all.

So for a film that is about reality, not dreams, you can do no better than choose this masterpiece. A final word about the Criterion version.  If you want to see this film, forget the other prints, and insist on the Criterion version...because the restoration is magnificent.  This time, it really makes a difference!",1297123200,2,3206,4.668449197860962
950915,3,6304963173,"This is a complex review for me to write, because the movie was brilliant:  beautifully acted, beautifully tense with emotion, great story line (though a drop slow at points), a fantastic view into a world gone by (poverty stricken 1940s Italy), and great cinematography.

But for all the good story that it was, I just am so bothered by one of the film's deeper implicit messages:  that it's okay for these poverty-stricken, desperate, emotionally primitive, non-self-reflective people to be having children.  I am tired of any film that espouses this message.

The parents, two of the film's main characters, had their entire life devolve into insane desperation, including violence against their older child, over the loss of a stinking bicycle, and yet they, within the past year, felt themselves ready to have. . .a second child?  Naturally the film makes no mention of that.  Hardly any film today would either.  It's the pink elephant in the living room.

The back of the film's DVD case says that this film is distinguished by its ""emotional clarity, social righteousness, and brutal honesty.""  Well, in part it is, but only to the degree that it doesn't offend our precious conventional denial. If the film were truly shooting for those characteristics it would at least hint at the points I'm making here.  Not a chance.

950919,2,6304963173,"This wasn't what I expected. I guess I expected some surprising plot twists or deep insight into human desperation or modern society. That's what the reviews and the official trailer (contained on this disc) would have me believe. Well, there is plenty of footage of human desperation, but really nothing surprising or insightful. People don't have jobs, a bike gets stolen, and you get the impression by the end that maybe thievery isn't such a rare thing in that place. You could say that some parallels are drawn between people suffering on both sides of the law and in different situations. In an artsy way you might find that interesting. Probably the most interesting aspect of the movie is the way that emotions and body language are portrayed by the actors. It is very genuine, good acting. So, if you can just get into the raw emotions it's perhaps a little interesting, except that for the most part there is only one emotion: desperation.

The main problem I have is with the plot. Okay, so it's called ""The Bicycle Thief,"" so you know that a bike gets stolen. I thought the movie would show perspectives of both the thief and the victim perhaps, or that there is more to the thief than just stealing bicycles. Well, you never get to learn much about the thief. I won't give any more away, but basically the plot goes nowhere. Nothing much happens until basically the very end and even then I found it anticlimactic. The ending is totally unresolved. Basically, I spent the whole movie feeling anxious for the main character, gritting my teeth hoping things turn out for the best, and after and hour-and-a-half all I got for my nervous hope was a screen saying ""fine."" It's not just that the ending doesn't turn out for the best, it doesn't turn out for the worst either. It just isn't satisfying and it didn't make me stand up and say ""Whoa. That was incredibly deep!""

All that said, maybe the point of this film is to linger on the details of everyday life, rather than address what is ostensibly the plot. If you are interested in something that primarily glorifies the mundane details of life, then you may enjoy this.",1259020800,7,2134,4.642857142857143

Antonio and Bruno both ride their bicycles to work. Unfortunately children Bruno's age had to scrape money so families like his can put food in their mouths and clothes on their back.

The last few seconds left me utterly jaw dropped; so much so that I literally uttered the word ""wow"" and just sat there a few seconds before saying it again, this time louder.

""WOW""

Why, you may ask, does this film leave me with that feeling?  The answer is simple; it has that raw emotional awareness that so many films lack these days.  The story is simple yet so complex when you take into consideration the realty of the situation.  This man, Antonio Ricci, is just trying to provide for his family.  With jobs scarce he is relying on his bicycle (which he went through pains to get) in order to keep his job and put food on his family's table.  When his bicycle is stolen he and his young son walk the streets of Rome in search of the thief.  That is it, in a nutshell, but what a nutshell.  The film takes this man's struggle and makes it a part of the viewer.  We can feel the pain and turmoil that comes from acknowledging defeat.  What is so poignant here though is the fact that film remains brutally honest, never once creating a faux sense of self-righteousness.  Antonio is certainly a victim; but as the films finale proves, he is not a saint.

UGH.

Director Vittorio De Sica made a brave yet richly rewarding casting decision in his two leads.  Both Lamberto Maggiorani (who looks an awful lot like Daniel Day-Lewis) and Enzo Staiola were not actors.  The studio wanted Cary Grant for the lead, but De Sica decided to cast unprofessional's, which could have seemed like suicide, but in the end served as one of the films greatest selling points.  Both Maggiorani and Staiola bring such realism to their performances, realism that could not come from trained acting.  This is raw, deep, powerful and emotional connection to a situation, a situation that may have been very, very real to these two individuals.  Maggiorani carries Antonio with such defeated realism, and young Staiola is such a wonderful breath of adolescent adoration.  The way he follows his father around, consistently hopeful, is just marvelous; and his face as the final few moments are unveiled; I mean, just ""WOW"".

One thing I really liked about this film is the texture.  By that I mean that the film has a very grainy, rough appeal to it.  It actually looks to me like a silent film, complete with the cracks in the film and the frequent pops (that wonderful white noise reminiscent of your parent's record player).  I love this feel because it adds realism to the film, taking you back to, not just an era in history but an era in cinema.  In fact, this is one of those rare films that could double as a silent film, for words are secondary to the actual expressions portrayed on the faces of everyone involved.

Watch it with sound, but then watch it without and you'll see what I mean.

`Ladri di Biciclette' (`The Bicycle Thief' or, more appropriately `Bicycle Thieves') is a marvelous film, one that will stay with you for a long time.

This is one outstanding essay, exquisitely nuanced with memorable performances from the leading man and his son(Enzo Staiola). The film, along with Rosselini's, Open City, was the likely template for Pasolini's  early realism and recalls also the great works on similar themes by Louis Bunuel. No milking, no sob story...the weight of suffering empathatically carried by Lamberto Maggiorani. No landmark architecture of the papal city on show in this film. It's heart is more in the anti-imperialism of Caravaggio. Memorable sequences, dad's relief in realising his son is not the body recovered from the river when spotting his boy sitting on top of a stairway: closeup on Enzo's face when he sees his dad pinch a bike, desperate to retain his job; the interrogation of the old guy mid-congregation; the implacable truth as the doomed and humiliated father and son exit the film...I could persist, with this relentlessly framed work of art.",1244851200,,1115,5.264044943820225
951019,5,6304963173,"During the desperate economic situation of post-war Italy, a poor young father named Ricci gets a rare opportunity for employment. The job requires that he must bring his bicycle, which, unfortunately, he has previously pawned so that his wife can buy food. She strips the beds and hocs all of the family linens, so that they can get the bike out. And so the man is able to get a paying job and thus a tenuous toe-hold up to a better life. But his hopes are dashed when a young man steals Ricci's bike on his first day on the job. With his young son in tow, he begins a mad hunt through the streets of Rome to find the bike and its thief. Along the way, the two encounter interesting adventures, and see many  bikes and bike parts, but never a trace of Ricci's red bike.  In the end he becomes overwhelmed with temptation to become a thief himself.  I especially enjoyed the brilliant way that Vittorio De Sica employs themes of irony and circularity in this movie.

This film really highlights the plight of the masses of poor people in Italy at that time, and well illustrates how impossible it seems to get out of that poverty.  I was amazed when Mrs. Ricci pawns the bedlinens, at how the pawnshop clerk climbs up many shelves piled high with similar bundles. Quite a visual image! Apparently no one has sheets on their beds anymore.

I also liked how De Sica self-references ""film"" within the film. This precious job which Ricci has landed is that of a movie poster-hanger. He is outfitted with a special little cap, and carries a long ladder and a big bucket of glue, along with his rolls of posters--quite a sight all-in-all. (There is some nice subtle humor here and there).  His trainer instructs him in the importance of gluing the posters up smoothly and neatly, with no bubbles or wrinkles. In concentrating on making sure that the posters are perfect, he losses sight of his bike for a minute and it is gone.  Later, another character in the film remarks, ""I am bored with movies, so I am stuck at home.""  It was like a little self-deprecating ironical comment about film.

951021,5,6304963173,"De Sica's great film ""Bicycle Thieves"" still holds up over 60 years after its release. In fact, many today in this recession will identify with the anguish of the main character.

The plot of ""Bicycle Thieves"" is pretty simple- an unemployed man, Antonio Ricci, in post-War Rome, Italy gets a job putting up posters over the city. To do this job, he needs a bicycle, which he has to get by pawning his linens. Unfortunately, his bicycle is stolen, and the thief gets away. So Ricci looks all over Rome to try to find it, with his loyal son Bruno helping.

After World War II, Italy was in a severe economic downturn. Millions were out of work, and were lucky to have food and a home, let alone a job. Automobiles were not yet widely available except to the very well-off, so a bicycle was the main form of personal transportation for most people. Having one's bicycle stolen would seem like the end of the world to most people, especially for those who had a job that required one, and could not afford to buy another.

""Bicycle Thieves"" is probably the most famous film of the Italian Neo-Realist school of the late 40s. The Neo-Realists wanted to move beyond the immediate Post-WW2 euphoria and take a hard look at life as it really was, and used specific stylistic devices to this end. These are seen in Bicycle Thieves. For instance, the film is shot on location rather than in a studio, which was an innovation at the time. In addition, the main characters are not played by big-name actors, and all of the extras were real people. Further, this is a story about real people facing real situations. Ricci is not a Proletarian prop or an airbrushed comic character- he is a 3-dimensional person who really has hopes- and the way he acts out the dashing of those hopes is devestating.",1239148800,,1787,4.5607476635514015

951023,5,6304963173,"On the surface, this is a film about a man desperate for work to support his family that upon getting hired, needs to pawn his bedding to get his bike out of hock for his new job. It is immediately stolen, and he spends the rest of the movie trying to get it back. Seems simple enough, but through the course of the film, you are witness to the desperation and abject poverty of the times, the struggle to maintain dignity and morals, and the seedy underbelly of society who's parasitic opportunism has dire consequences for their victims. The father takes his son to a nice restaurant for a proper meal and they are scorned by the millionaires living large while much of the population is barely surviving.

The director adds an additional perspective to the importance of getting the bike back when we see the Father looking for his young son and he sees boats dragging the river for a drowned body. He fears his son may be dead. Losing a bike is one thing, but losing your only child would make it pale in comparison. His son is safe, but the point has been made. The father does the math for his son regarding how much money he can earn with his new job and how much it will mean to their standard of living, which is ultimately what's at stake, not the cost of a bike. It also means the difference between him feeling like a failure, and his being able to regain his dignity and provide for his family.

The father is finally faced with the decision of whether or not to steal a bike so that he won't lose his job. He knows it is wrong, but his family's survival, his self-respect and the admiration of his son are all at stake. Maybe this moral dilemma is lost on modern society where the biggest crooks aren't stealing for survival, but are already billionaires working on Wall St., and kids illegaly download billions of dollars worth of music and videos that they don't need, without conscience. A heartfelt movie about family, character, and values these days is the equivalent of casting pearls before swine. At least some people see this film as something other than Pee Wee's Big Adventure.

The final scene is powerful in it's simplicity. The father, hat in hand and head hung low knows that one simple act has reduced him to the level of the miscreants, his dreams for his family are dead, and worst of all he has lost respect in the eyes of his son who witnessed it all. The overwhelming shame and regret are palpable, all without uttering a word. Truly devastating.",1236816000,2,2482,4.474613686534217

951076,5,6304963173,"Despite this movie's strong placement in the annals of those deemed ""classics"", I was a bit hesitant to check it out because I'm not the biggest fan of neorealism, and, strangely enough, a lot of my friends with opinions I respect really didn't like it.  I've got to say that I'm going to have to side with those who call it a classic this time around.  More specifically, I've never before seen a neorealist film I would ever have called ""gripping"" and I've not seen any neorealist film as good since ""Roma, citta operta"".

Let me quickly go through some of the myths and the more popular interpretations: it is true that the movie completely revolves around a man and his son searching for the man's stolen bicycle, but it is not true at all that there's nothing else to it.  More specifically, it's about the man's relationship with his son as a main theme and an exploration of post-war Rome as subtext.  It is true that it has quite a lot of communist themes placed through-out, but honestly those themes are entirely engulfed in the much more personal, tragic aspects of the movie.  The more poignant political commentary is in the way the plot works, where people are forced to own property--a certain type of property--in order to get a job and thus get more property.  Truly you can't blame the movie for that, because it has a point.

What this movie is really good at is shifting the emotions of the viewers to match those felt by the protagonist Antonio Vicci.  The movie quickly establishes the importance of the bicycle and its emotional value to Vicci.  The search itself is desperate, but it is given depth by the relationship of Antonio to Bruno, his son.  As the two of them share a love for the bike and a need to retrieve it, they also share a shifting and dynamic relationship to each other that runs from full support to quiet alienation and everything in between.  The strongest moments in the film are the ones in which their relationship seem the most damaged.  The father eventually must depend on the son to share his pain.

In terms of the concept of neorealism itself, it's debatable where this movie fits.  The most clear features of it are its focus on class struggle, a taste of the melodrama, and a plot lead on by a simple, singular desire.  However, the production values are much higher than the famed ""Roma, citta aperta"", and at this point de Sica is well established as an auteur working under the awareness of a more popular and mainstream international audience.  Genre debates aside, it's a strong film that well deserves its lasting appreciation, no matter how many people find it boring or disagree with its politics.

951077,5,6304963173,"Vittorio De Sica's The Bicycle Thief (Ladri Di Biciclette), made in 1948, in black and white, is one of the all time great films, and, in its Neo-realistic cinema verit simplicity, it shows how utterly creatively bankrupt most filmmaking these days is. And by that I mean worldwide, not just the obvious flaws of the Hollywood crap factory. Lean, spare, poetic- it tells one story, but tells it very well, and that story becomes universal, and is applicable to all people who have ever suffered, or been driven to do desperate things. Its screenplay is deceptively slight, but that does not mean it is not great. Oftentimes, it is assumed that a great screenplay must be witty like Woody Allen films, deep like Ingmar Bergman films, or characteristically complex like Robert Altman films, but great screenplays can also be the antithesis of those things. A great screenplay may be like that in Stanley Kubrick's for 2001: A Space Odyssey, full of symbolism writ large, and on the other hand, it can be like The Bicycle Thief, which is symbolic precisely because it is so intensely personal.
  The film is almost pitch perfect from beginning to end, yet, as often happens, something is lost in the translation of its title, Ladri Di Biciclette, which literally means Bicycle Thieves, but in America is known as The Bicycle Thief. The original title is more literally true, as both the `real' thief and Antonio, steal bikes, and it also allows for a deeper look at their differing motivations. When we see the original thief's one room apartment- with mother and two other siblings- we see that he, too, is poor, and we have to wonder if he is Antonio on the future, with just a bit more desperation. Yes, he's obviously a skilled con man, but he may have started out pure, as well. This deeper look is lost in the Americanized title, for while technically Antonio is a thief, he is truly forced into it, lest his family will be even more degraded, while the young thief is likely merely using external circumstances to justify his black soul. De Sica wisely does not opt out for that simplistic end, though, for we still have the contrast between the professional thief, and the rank amateur, Antonio.
  Many critics have reduced this film to De Sica's supposed refutation of a simple false dualism- that De Sica is merely trying to show good and evil are relative, but the film clearly is NOT doing that, for we know, all along, that the young professional thief would likely be a con man regardless. All of his neighbors are cheats and liars, as he has likely been accused many times before, and even his mother lies for her manifestly guilty son. De Sica recognizes that there IS good and evil, but that sometimes an act that appears evil- such as thievery, can be born of different circumstances; pure evil and greed, as in the case of the young thief, and mere desperation, as with Antonio. Ironically, many of the critics who chide viewers for their supposed biases against the young thief, show their own biases in wholly missing De Sica's actual point- which is not to show that there are differing reasons for similar acts, but that the reasons CAN be night and day, yet still be confused, and that usually, and regardless, it is the honest who are screwed either way.
  Even worse, are those stolid critics with a political ax to grind. Marxists somehow got it into their heads that Antonio, who is clearly shown as living in squalor, is a member of the bourgeoisie, simply because he wears a fedora, not a cap, or because his wife has clean bedsheets, thus when he gets a job, it is symbolic of governmental favoritism for an elite class, and the young bike thief, who wears a German hat, is a member of the international proletariat, although he clearly is a member of the criminal class, and in that conflation much of Marxist theology bogs down. The theft of Antonio's bike is therefore claimed as a revolutionary act, and his lying neighbors are just good workers defending a comrade. That Antonio is left bereft, at film's end, to Marxists, symbolizes a perverse justice. To point out all the ridiculous flaws in such super-simplistic ideas would waste time, but, clearly, the only reason such absurd claims were made were because the screenwriter, Cesare Zavattini, who adapted the film from a novel by Luigi Bartolini, was a member of the Italian Communist Party, at the time. Interestingly, the film has also been seen as a very Conservative film, praised by Christian groups and even William F. Buckley's The National Review, not because it delineates good and evil, as described above, but because they see it as a refutation of Marxist ideals, in that Antonio and the other laborers do not find work degrading, but a fundament of their self worth; so much so that when the young thief kyboshes Antonio's ability to gain that self respect, he loses all hope, and is reduced to dishonesty himself.
  Neither reductivist outlook adequately deals with the many subtleties and nuances this great film portrays, and the fact that The Bicycle Thief is shorn of Freudian psychobabble and preaching is one of its strengths. Yet, it is not pure cinema, either, as many European critics have labeled it. Although the visuals convey the milieu well, they do not get inside the characters. This is where the writing and acting ability of Maggiorani and Staiola works magic. Great art is simply not so easily reducible as political panderers want it to be, and one can be thankful for that, lest The Bicycle Thief would not be what it is, nor would we still be watching it with such easy appreciation for its simple virtues.",1221696000,3,5631,4.744637385086823
951078,4,6304963173,"""The Bicycle Thief,"" a dramatic, grainy black and white Italian film released in the United States in 1949, has long been considered one of the greats, for several reasons. The strongest must be that, along with Roberto Rossellini's 1946&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Open-City/dp/6305075573/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Open City</a>, it gives us an unvarnished look at Rome, shortly after the end of World War II that the Italians definitively lost.  The city is devastated; its people are desperate for jobs, food, and shelter.

The movie was written by Cesare Zavattini, frequent collaborator of its director, Vittorio De Sica, erstwhile matin&eacute;e idol, who took his camera onto the streets of Rome, used amateur actors, and filmed in natural light.  He and Rossellini were therefore described as adherents of the ""neorealist"" school.

The plot of ""The Bicycle Thief,"" as it was called in America is, of course, well-known.  Antonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani), one of the city's throngs of long-term unemployed, finally gets a job, and a good one with the city: putting up posters.  But ownership of a bike is a prerequisite.  His wife Maria (Lianella Carell) gets his out of hock by pawning the sheets in her dowry.  On Ricci's very first day on the job, while he's hanging a poster of Rita Hayworth in ""Gilda,"" his attention wanders from the bike.  And it's gone, stolen just like that.  He and his son Bruno (Enzo Staiola) frantically search the city for it.  Maggiorani and Staiola, though both amateurs, turn in intense, fully inhabited performances. Staiola's, as the son Bruno, is extraordinarily expressive: his eyes can speak volumes.  Many critics will tell you that, stolen bicycle aside; the movie is most moving in its depiction of a strong father/son bond.  And many more will point out that the relationship shown here strongly influenced the Oscar-winning World War II Holocaust film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-Is-Beautiful/dp/B00001U0DP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life Is Beautiful</a>, by Roberto Benigni.

""Bicycle Thief"" is certainly realistic.  There's a scene where Bruno is trying to cross a street to join his father; he's brushed back twice by traffic.  As De Sica was filming on actual, live location, these two near accidents really happened, and were left in the picture.  Furthermore, Maggiorani had been one of the city's unemployed before filming, and he would continue to struggle for work afterwards.

It's said that prospective producer David O. Selznick proposed Cary Grant for the lead, and that De Sica countered by asking for Henry Fonda.  ""Bicycle Thief"" received a Special Oscar before the Best Foreign Film Category was established.

De Sica was born into poverty in a village near Rome, and grew up in always poor southern Naples.  His first job was as an office clerk, but he made his screen debut, as an actor, in his teens.  He joined a stage company in 1923, and became a theater matin&eacute;e idol; he would soon become a cinematic matin&eacute;e idol as well.  He was a compulsive gambler, and a communist (there were many of them in Italy after the War), and his politics surely influenced his work.  In 1970, shortly before the director's death, he made&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Garden-Of-The-Finzi-Continis/dp/B00005BJX7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Garden Of The Finzi Continis</a>, about Italian Jews leading doomed lives during WWII, and its attendant Holocaust, that won another Oscar.  In 1961, he made another WWII picture,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Two-Women/dp/B0002PYSYM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Two Women</a>, (based on the novel of the same name by Alberto Moravia--<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Two-Women/dp/1586420208/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Two Women</a>&nbsp;),that won its star, Sophia Loren, a Best Actress Oscar, an extremely rare one, as given for a performance not in English.  Throughout his acting career - De Sica continued to act, to pay for his movie making --he was best known for light earthy sex comedies, and played opposite the great female Italian stars of the day, Loren, and Gina Lollobrigida.

This picture was called ""The Bicycle Thieves,"" in the original Italian, as in its English release: De Sica certainly had an eye for irony. His film retains much of its power to the present day, and probably will, into the future.  Between them, ""The Bicycle Thief"" and ""Open City"" will quite likely last as long as celluloid does, giving us a closely-observed look at a great city, and its people, in defeat.",1219795200,4,4745,5.7982708933717575
951079,5,6304963173,"De Sica's ""Bicycle Thieves"" (plural, in the Italian) reminds us that hope takes many forms.  In the case of Antonio Ricci and his family, hope is a bicycle.  Ricci, one of the tens of thousands of unemployed workers in the Italian depression that followed WWII, finally gets a job in Rome as a sign-hanger.  But the job requires that he have a bicycle.  Ricci's bike is stolen his first day on the job, and he and his son Bruno embark on a fruitless search for it that occupies the bulk of the movie.  They come close to it once, but the bike--a symbol of hope--remains elusive.  Finally, in desperation, Ricci himself becomes a bicycle thief--but an unsuccessful one.  The film ends with a heartbreaking shot of Ricci's face, despairing, humiliated in front of his adoring son, and hopeless because futureless.

Many commentators have focused on what they see as de Sica's moral theme:  that poverty and the despair it brings erodes moral fiber.  Ricci, the victim of robbery, himself stoops to robbery.  But I think this misses the broader point.  In a capitalist society, given the intensity of competition, the imperative to climb the social and economic ladder, and the merciless disregard for people who can't ""cut it,"" everyone necessarily becomes a thief (hence the plural ""thieves"" in the title) just to survive.  But only a handful--the movers and shakers, the beautiful people who live in penthouses and are relatively unaffected by the economic crises periodically churned up by the capitalist system--are successful at it.  The rest of us are losers.  We may succeed every once in awhile, but sooner or later either another loser, or the system itself, will come along and steal our bikes/futures/hopes.

How can hope survive in a predatory society built along these lines, where almost everyone is a loser and even losers are thieves too?  This, I believe, is the real tragedy de Sica is exploring in this wonderful and sobering film.  In giving us the particular tragedy of the Ricci family, he points to a wider tragedy in which all of us are players.",1218326400,2,2067,4.857142857142857

There isn't much in the way of a plot - a struggling father and husband buys a new bicycle in order to carry out the duties of his new job, the bike is taken away buy a passing thief, and the father and his son go out into the poverty stricken streets of Italy to find it.

However, it is a journey that they will never forget, as they bond with one another, and the father's weaknesses are ultimately exposed out of an act of desperation. It is an ultimately heartbreaking ending that caps off one of the best films that I have ever seen.

You owe it to yourself to see this one. Thank God that the people at Criterion cleaned it up, and gave it the DVD release that it deserves.",1216857600,5,847,4.059880239520958

Halfway through the day, however, a punk kid makes off with his bicycle. The rest of the film is spent desperately searching for the bicycle or any clues that might lead him to it with his son (Enzo Staiola). In true neo-realist fashion, the film does not end where one might expect with the events neatly wrapped up. Director De Sica uses long takes and deep focus to illustrate the ordinary lives of the actors who in fact are non-professionals. There are many memorable scenes, but all of them do not seem important to the central conflict, finding the bicycle. One particularly emotional one is that when the man and his son stop at a restaurant to eat. The boy watches a wealthier family as they eat. His father cannot really afford the meal they are having and is in agony over spending money he does not have, worrying about his bicycle, and trying to enjoy himself.

I would recommend this film if only to hear the way the actors speak. I love the rhythm to the Italian language and find myself enjoying hearing it even if I do not understand what is being said.

It's the type of art-house film of which everybody has heard, but relatively few have actually seen. That's why for me, seeing it for the first time in the clean print transfer offered by Criterion becomes a transcendent experience not only for the heartbreaking story of one man's dire situation but for the rueful way it depicts the way of life among Rome's poverty-stricken inhabitants after the devastation of war. While much of the credit belongs to renowned director Vittorio De Sica (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Two-Women/dp/B000007SFB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Two Women</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Garden-Of-The-Finzi-Continis/dp/B00005BJX7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Garden Of The Finzi Continis</a>) and his frequent writing partner, Cesare Zavattini, Carlo Montuori's beautifully composed cinematography and Alessandro Cicognini's melancholy music score contribute immeasurably to the vivid portrayal of the city's unforgiving nature.

Against such a teeming backdrop, the basic story at its heart comes across as almost a parable. With the scarcity of jobs after the war, men desperately wait for a chance at any menial job. Antonio Ricci gets his opportunity when he is hired to glue movie posters around the city. The one condition to his hiring is that he must have a bicycle, an ironic point since he just sold his previous one to feed his family. When his wife sells their bed sheets for cash, Antonio can afford one, and he beams with pride over his new job. So does his son Bruno who quickly learns every nook and cranny of the bicycle. On the very first day of his new job, however, his bicycle is stolen. Antonio has a Sunday to find it before reporting back to work the next day, and the rest of the movie follows father and son on a palpably desperate search. One frustrating event follows another as Antonio grows increasingly angry, weary and desperate with his hopes fading precipitously. These episodes allow De Sica to spotlight postwar Rome in highly charged personal detail - Antonio pursuing an old man to a church mass, confronting a suspect in a hostile neighborhood, treating his son to a restaurant meal, visiting a fortune teller whose prediction is frustratingly curt. Meanwhile, the bond between father and son evolves in mercurial fashion throughout the day.

De Sica hired amateurs off the street to play the roles, which likely explains why the naturalistic performances resonate so much. With his worn fedora and constant look of intensely felt desperation, Lamberto Maggiorani fully inhabits the role of Antonio. As the cherubic Bruno devoted to his father no matter the depth of despair, Enzo Staiola really carries the moral conscience of the story in an innnocently watchful manner. During their momentary respite in the restaurant, he produces a memorable look of forlorn acceptance when Antonio says they cannot afford to eat like the family at the next table. The ending is heartbreaking without relying on cheap sentiment. The first disc contains the movie with surprisingly no film scholar commentary (Criterion's usual practice with such a renowned classic). The second disc includes interviews conducted in 2005 about working with De Sica (Staiola, close to seventy now, is among the subjects), an hour-long Italian TV documentary about Zavattini, and a forty-minute history of Italian neo-realism. The accompanying 75-page booklet is an exceptional extra containing a multitude of scholarly essays and remembrances.",1199404800,6,3865,5.538071065989848
951137,5,6304963173,"LADRI DI BICICLETTE (1948) is a remarkable movie, mainly for the
generosity of the director, in showing a large spectrum of human
emotions, and human circumstances, that reaches the core of the
feeling person, who is watching the picture in the theatre.

It is also a clearly ideological movie, a working man's movie, that
may  totally bore those living off their stock market investments and
annuities, or from the revenue of well run real estate operations and
small businesses.

In 1948, post-war Italy is faced with millions  of able bodied,
20-ish, 30-ish young, married men who simply cannot maintain
themselves in a large city the size of Rome, without the regular
income that only a job can provide. Political action is touched upon,
as we hear a party organizer underline the need for a strong public
works program, to provide needed jobs and pride to workers, deprived
of jobs and wages.

Concretely, the zero-sum game that the average man is confronted
with, is underlined. In this film, the individual has a wife and  2
kids that must be fed, the rent paid and other living expenses
covered and balanced out with earned income. Realistic aspects of
workers is underlined, as they are shown using a bus, and in many
cases and in this case, a bicycle to go to work.

Thus, the story underlines that people have a right to work, a right
to a job. We have an 8 year old boy accompany his father's torments
in trying to locate the thief who ran off with his only means of
transportation, thereby tugging on the spectators' heart-strings,
from start to finish. As such, this is an ideological movie.

Secondly, the poverty-stricken population of post-WW2 Italy is
underlined, as authentic ghettos of grown men, turn the streets into
crowded areas from one moment to the next, whenever there's a street
disturbance. The man's wife doesn't blink, when she decides to sell
her wedding linen to raise funds to recover the property from the
pawn shop, that will make a job possible. At the same time, religion
binds the poor and the wealthy together as a unified population,
during the weekly mass.

Third, some lighter moments are brought into the picture, as the
protagonist, remembering his predicament, and  distressful financial
situation still celebrates life, taking time out, by taking his kid
to a restaurant, for a meal, normally only visited by the affluent
and wealthy. The more refined table manners of those folks than his
own kid are shown, and mocked a bit. The silliness of a
fortune-teller or clairvoyant is also shown, perhaps to draw a
parallel to those believing in trickle-down economics, that by
allowing the 1% of the rich to get even richer, that somehow some of
that money will trickle down  to the needy, working man and woman,
and solve the problems of millions of starving citizens. The
phenomenon of Sunday afternoon soccer is also underlined, which is
characteristically European.

Fourth, from a visual point of view, the movie shows plenty of good
taste, and discernment in the filming locations. With cobble stone
streets, tramways, large public parks in the city, architectural
masterpieces, these elements are almost identical to those found, for
example, in Lisbon, Portugal  even 50  years later. The fact that the
technology of bicycles has not changed much in that time span  is
also remarkable. This helps the movie resist from the risk of
obsoleteness and agedness. Perhaps Piazza Vitorrio, and Fides rings a
bell for the Italians.

The ending is somewhat abrupt, and bleak as the protagonistic finds
no remedy to his immediate problem, of having no funds, and no way to
generate funds without his bicycle - not surprising as this was not a
Hollywood production.",1195948800,4,3705,4.913461538461538

As we sympathize with Antonio, possibly attempting to justify his actions in our mind, we must then analyze the young thief who stole Antonio's bike, the cause of our frustrations from the beginning of the film, and give him the same sympathy. Perhaps he was only trying to feed his family as well. Nevertheless, that didn't give him the right to steal another's livelihood, to put Antonio's family at risk. In the same way, Antonio's desperation doesn't give him the right to potentially put another man's family at risk by stealing his bike. Owning a bike becomes the conduit through which selfish survival instincts allow man to exploit man. It also leads us to ask questions like: Does one society's need justify the misuse of another society?  De Sica presents these questions to his audience by creating characters with which one can easily identify, and whose actions can be easily interpreted. It is through our reflections and interpretations that we can then know ourselves.

 The most respectable aspect of De Sica's film mastery is the way in which he gives the characters of The Bicycle Thief dignity and personal values despite their disadvantaged situation. Antonio's friends who work all night collecting garbage, then help him search for his bike all day are the epitome of compassion and friendship. His wife, as well, in her giving efforts to secure a job for him, exemplifies great consideration.

In order to retrieve his bike, his wife sells their bedsheets, and Antonio sets off to make some money. Then, suddenly, his bicycle his stolen and his whole world comes crashing down. Unable to do his job, he notifies the police who tell him that they can do nothing about it. So, he begins walking the streets of Rome with his son trying to find it. That's pretty much it; But the movie, in all of its simplicity, is so much more poetic and important. Despite not being a professional actor, Maggiorani gives one of the most memorable performances I've ever seen. Even the boy who plays his young son is unforgettable. The movie is filled with great scenes, such as the moment where Antonio spots the man who stole his bicycle and attempts to get it back, only to have the entire neighborhood gang up on him. Then there are the final scenes, where we realize that the actual title of the film ""Bicycle Thieves"" is much more appropriate than ""The Bicycle Thief."" To say ""Bicycle Thieves"" is a masterpiece would be an understatement. Many movies can be called masterpieces, but few films really embody the wonder of cinema.

This movie is important, well made on all levels, it has aged well, and it's entertaining. We know that the latter doesn't always happen in ""great movies."" Anyone who wants to begin watching films that have shaped cinema over the course of the years can start anywhere from 'Citizen Kane' to 'Breathless' to 'Jules and Jim' to 'Pulp Fiction.' Those films are all good to start with, but at some point you must see ""Bicycle Thieves.""

Some of these old black and white films bring back memories of a time when life seemed to begin every moment. It was a time after the war and people were just beginning to discover each other. The old Italian movies had a grittiness to them. A reality from far away places where life just had a different style. La Strada and the Nights of Cabiria were from this time. I feel such a pull watching them, wishing things had never become so modern. The Bicycle Thieves belongs in this catagory. The reproduction is marvelous. Clean and smooth.

951217,4,6304963173,"(Oooops 5*'s) In Italy's classic movie, `The Bicycle Thief,' sociology and story come together as one for post World War II Italians.  Convincing and with heart, we experience the pain of Antonio Ricci (Lamberti Maggiorani) as he becomes one of the lucky few to get a decent-paying job.  He is to put up posters throughout Rome, using a broom and adhesive.  If you've been there like I have, you notice that the city has bulletins and posters pastered all over their ancient walls.  To work he must have a bicycle.  He has one, but it is broken.  Determined he accepts, but he hasn't the money for repairs.  His wife sells their linen to pay the bicycle repair shop.  All is set and his life has a whole new outlook until a thief steals his bicycle while he's on the job.  He chases him, even hitching on a car, to no avail.  He has a friend who takes him downtown, and we see a whole market of bicycles, some of which undoubtedly have been stolen.  The vast majority of the movie focuses on him and his young son, Bruno (Enzo Staiola), as he goes to every corner of Rome to recover what misfortune fatefully handed to him in human form.

Containing (for then) a non-Hollywood ending and sporting perceptive social commentary, 'A Bicycle Thief' comes off as a post-depression 'Grapes of Wrath' for urban Italy.  It gets us there by easily providing empathy for the characters and telling a simple, but solid story.",1173744000,,1414,4.563492063492063

951219,4,6304963173,"The Bicycle Thief (Vittorio de Sica, 1948)

One of the things I adore about Italian filmmakers is that they know how to end their movies. Whether it's completely understated (Michele Soavi's Dellamorte Dell'amore) or so over-the-top that ""cheesy"" doesn't even begin to describe it (Argento's Suspiria), you know that you're going to get some sort of reward for the build-up. The Bicycle Thief is no exception to the rule; you see the ending coming from a mile away, but that doesn't make it any less of a payoff.

Antonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani) is trying to get along in post-World War II Italy, where poverty is rampant. He lands a job hanging posters, for which he needs a bicycle. The family has to sell the bedsheets to get his out of the repair shop, but that's all right, innit? After all, he's making money now. Until, that is, on the morning of his first day on the job, his bicycle is stolen by one of the city's ubiquitous bicycle thieves. For the rest of the movie, Antonio, aided by his son Bruno (The Barefoot Contessa's Enzo Staiola) and some friends, goes looking for his bicycle and/or the guy who stole it. Antonio, consumed more and more by the random injustice of the thing and his frustration at the indifference of the rest of the world to his plight, finally hits bottom, with the expected results.

Antonio is, at no point in this movie, the good guy. Even when he's on top of the world, having just gotten his bicycle out of hock, he berates his wife for stopping to visit a seer (in a scene that's actually one of the film's most suspenseful, since you know his bicycle's going to get stolen, you just don't know when). He berates the seer, yes, which later becomes an integral part of his character, but his wife as well, which is an integral part of his character right then. He's never all that good to his kid. He orders his friends around like Mussolini. When he gets frustrated, he takes the kid out for grilled cheese sandwiches and the two of them proceed to get plastered (allowing Antonio-- and De Sica-- a rumination on class structure, as the daughter of a wealthy patron of the restaurant catches Bruno's eye). All of this is, in a way, morbidly funny, and yet you know you're watching a tragedy, Antonio as low-rent Lear or Titus Andronicus. And Maggiorani-- who, despite having turned in (in his big-screen debut) one of the great performances in Italian film to that point, never landed anything more than a supporting role the rest of his life-- plays Antonio as if he knows Antonio is Andronicus, but not as if Antonio knows Antonio is Andronicus. That's great stuff, right there.

I've been putting off watching this for years because, honestly, I had no idea why a movie about a bicycle thief would have captured the imagination of critics and the public alike. Well, now I know, and I have to tell you, they're right. This is a fascinating study of a man's slow descent into obsession, and it's well worth your time. ****",1173052800,7,2972,4.60188679245283
951220,5,6304963173,"(This review is for the Criterion Collection release of this dvd -- not for the Image Entertainment release that many other reviews here refer to.)

""Bicycle Thieves"" (as it is wisely retranslated from the Italian for this new Criterion release) is one of the few ""perfect films"" -- by which I mean a film that is in its own way just as it should be, lacking nothing, the kind of film where even apparent missteps tend to contribute indelibly to the overall impression of a film in which nothing could have been changed without damaging the film.  Take, for example, the scenario that instead of an unknown day laborer in the role of Antonio, de Sica had gone with David Selznick's suggestion of Cary Grant (which was a condition for the film getting funded through American studios).  I have no doubt that this would have remained an interesting film, and that Grant would have done an admirable job -- but it would have been a totally different film and would have lost the fragility and vulnerability and delicacy (combined with hardness and objectivity) that make this film so precious.  We can all be grateful that De Sica chose to wait for an Italian investor who allowed him to make the film the way he and Zappatini had planned.

Without giving away anything of the plot, I will say that the conclusion of the film is one of the most powerful I have seen -- and carries an emotional weight that is earned rather than manipulated, and that can be compared only to a very few films: Chaplin's City Lights and Kiarostami's Close-up are the only films that come to mind.  De Sica strikes a very delicate balance between realistic depiction of the harsh realities of life in postwar Rome, and a humanistic vison of the resourcefulness of individuals in the face of hopelessness and the enduring power of empathy, forgiveness, and love.

The film looks better than ever on this new Criterion edition -- it seemed to me that a few shots were a bit washed out but I can only assume that is due to the condition of the available negatives.  Spots and dust and other imperfections seem to have been removed entirely, and the subtitles are quite good and easy to read.  The film alone would make this set an essential one, but the booklet (containing some excellent essays, including a very illuminating essay by Andre Bazin) and attached documentaries (one on neorealsm, one on screenwriter Zappatini, and one on De Sica) make this set as a whole like a master course on one of the undisputed masterpieces of cinema.",1171411200,89,2514,4.669683257918552

951222,4,6304963173,"""The Bicycle Thief"" is a classic piece of cinema. It was made in almost guerrilla-type fashion in 1947 amidst the deprivations and devastation of post World War II Italy.  Most of the people appearing in the film aren't real actors. Director Vittorio De Sica utilizes Rome's populace to fill the screen with people rushing en masse to and fro to simply make ends meet.  You get a tremendous sense of how flat on its back Italy was after its devastating and total defeat as an Axis power.

So, for such a classic, why the four stars? Well, because the quality of the presentation is simply abysmal.  For such a cherished piece of film history (it's a touchstone for quite a number of people), its treatment is a shame: the video is blurry, the sound a mess, the subtitles spotty and of dubious accuracy (""here's the general idea,"" they seem to say, ""you figure it out).

Additionally, the scenes of a historic Rome, the despair and economic turmoil, are breathtaking. While dialogue is certainly present in the film, I do not think it is of much relevance. The acting, plot sequencing could serve alone to convey the very, very simple plot of The Bicycle Thief.

The entire premise of the film is that of a man in a fruitless search for his bicycle. Deprived of his bicycle, his sole means of transportation, he is, in effect, deprived of a livelihood. He and his family suffer as a result.

As I must add in, too, for anyone that sees this- Bruno is undeniably likeable, enjoy his wanderings with his Dad.

I haven't seen a film in a while where everything going on translates in such a meaningful way, and I give credit here to the filmmakers, but especially the acting.

In many films I ve seen that are subtitled it takes me a couple of viewings to really get a strong concept of the story and the characters since much of the time is spent reading text and not concentrating fully on every little nuance.  Film being a powerful visually as it is, much of the great acting out there can be accomplished with subtlties and the great actors will have as much going on in their reactions as they do in they dialogue.  This is certainly no exception, and the acting in this film is tip top.  But, after one viewing, I had a great feeling as to what the film wanted to convey.  And thats with a brief nap in the middle of the film (one I take full responsibility for, due to a full stomache and a short night of sleep)!

One review said this could be the best portrayal of a father-son relationship in cinema history and there is a case for that.  The relationship fluctuates throughout the film and then the ending . . . how would we feel if we were that kid or the father?  Too many different emotions.

Looking at history of post-war Europe, the beginning makes more sense and the bicycle becomes that much more important.  Sure, this movie has communist overtones: everyone should have a bike.  But, overall the story of how one man deals with life changing incidents in such a short period of time is the ultimate character study that makes this the most rewarding aspect of the film: the gaining of a job, purchase of the bike, loss of the bike, and change in relationship with son.

The sound is a little off and the picture quality isn't great at times, but the Bicycle Thief is a film that is still a powerful examination of life even today.",1140912000,6,1033,4.576086956521739

At wits end, he steals a bicycle himself; but he's caught and is made to feel humiliated and beaten before his son.

951332,5,6304963173,"I have just seen this film again & was so impressed that I read every one of the 68 reviews about it on this site.  I'm not sure if I can add anything not already said by the generally wonderful reviews, so I won't go over the plot, theme, acting, directing, political, economic, sociological dynamics, etc., that were talked about quite adequately by the reviewers; but here are some feelings / thoughts / beliefs as I experience them:

What can one say about a film that literally takes one's breath away by searing one's lungs with the intensity of its impact as a very young man of perhaps 20 years old & then all over again almost 40 years later?  Its imagery is indelibly etched in my fore-conscious with the impact of a sledge hammer right between the eyes.  Not only is its impact not less intense, it's just the opposite; I was even more riveted this time than during the original viewing.  I was even more thrown up against the wall by its pull into the very vortex of the struggle for `meaningful existence'. It took hold of my blood & guts as a `youthful idealist' & again as a `burnt out cynic'. It solidifies why Vittorio De Sica is revered as one of the all time greatest directors of cinema.

In my mind, this film is one of the defining moments in cinema that has become the bar that all films aspiring to be considered 'great' must compare themselves with. While not a professional film critic, film is a 'meaning making magnet' in some magical manner that I have been irresistibly drawn to 'forever'.  In that context, for me, this film has obtained the status of the very best ever created. It is within that elite grouping of a handful of films that I cannot imagine could ever have been better in any way.

The fact that I am babbling like an ogling groupie is a testimony to the adoration I have for this esteemed masterwork. I'll leave it at that. This is one of the core `must see' films of all time! It is literally extraordinary & truly superlative.

As for the 2 out of 68 reviewers who did not care for it: they indicated that there was not enough `action' to sustain their interest. It's my belief that most of the really important `action' takes place `between the ears' & most films never capture that fundamental reality. I believe that they have unfortunately missed a whole universe of meaning somehow.",1132790400,7,2337,4.492924528301887

951405,5,6304963173,"The transalation of Ladri di Biceclette would properly be translated ""Bicycle Thieves"".  The title is not a niggling detail, but serves as an important plot point, and although the central action circles around a man's search for his stolen bicycle, and for the thief..there is another thief, whose life concerns us intimately.

There are, in fact, many thieves-men and boys reduced to extreme poverty, without means of support, some of whom, driven by circumstances beyond their control who make the terrible decision to betray their moral codes in order to survive, some of whom have no moral codes. Morality seems a luxury in a world gone mad. (Compare this attitude to the dialogue scene of ""apres-guerre"" in Kurosawa's post-war film ""Stray Dog"").

This terrible pressure to survive at any cost is illustrated so powerfully, you will feel the moral dilemma that faces the protagonist as a personal look into the mouth of hell.

Vittorio de Sica films a post-war Rome and its outskirts that is seething in angry poverty. There is not enough work, and the work that exists is hard. A man's hopes are dashed, his humanity disassembled bit by bit until he is driven to a rash act in which he betrays himself and that humiliates him before his young son.

Filmed with sensitivity, the images expose a Rome of the post-war moment, parts of which still look familiar today. The light, the rain, the sun, the sunset, the Tevere, the bridges, the shops and buildings,  the faces of the people crowding a tram...all of these things persist, although years have passed since the images were recorded.

What is different now, is that the poverty that persists is isolated to small areas of the city and to particular populations. What is different now is that we do not ask ""what is wrong with society that such poverty exists? "" There is the assumption that the poor are lazy or defective.

We may look to Vittorio de Sica's masterpiece to remind us of the disenfranchised who, through no fault of their own, are denied a meaningful place in society, and who can be driven to acts of desperation.

Clearly, de Sica feels the fall of the protagonist as a tragedy. He shows us a man who, despite all his earnest desire to be a good father, a good provider, a good worker in society, fails at all his attempts, and then, takes a moral fall into the abyss. De Sica films the final decision before the fall as a moment of supreme tension, extreme indecision and desperation.

What would you do, in a similar situation? This is the question that de Sica asks the audience.

This remarkably compassionate, profound film offers us the opportunity to ask of ourselves meaningful questions about our lives, our moral beliefs, our society and its inequities.",1129161600,8,2740,4.783898305084746

Its importance as a film that ushered in a new genre of art, its importance as a postwar piece...all of the notoriety that has arisen around the film is secondary to one thing: powerful storytelling.  THE BICYCLE THIEF tells a moving story about the relationship of fathers and sons, a moving story about desperation and loss, a moving story that could have been located in any time period, amidst any external conflicts.

I won't elaborate much on the plot: others have done so, but the truth of the matter is that the plot is exceedingly simple.  It simply does not matter.  Instead, this movie focuses on understated character and the ways in which external forces force different characters into trying circumstances.

This film will leave you feeling drained and contemplative.  It is not a ""pick me up"" kind of film.  Watch it with the right attitude and you will be moved, guaranteed.  I do have one minor complaint: the DVD transfer on this edition is not the best.

This is how poor people live; this is how dependent they are on something as simple as a bicycle.  When the bicycle was stolen, I felt the blow to the poor man's life: how would he and his family live?  When he tracked it down, and was ridiculed and driven away by the thief's associates, I thought that this also was true: poor people do not necessarily feel sympathy for each other; all that matters is surviving, even at someone else's expense.

That story could be happened in any city of the world.

Only problem (very minute), the subtitles aren't all that great. They often don't cover all the dialogue, especially side dialogue and songs.

There are very interesting and meticulous events in the film that make it great. One of them....
The main character, Ricci, is chasing the man who knows the thief of his bike in church, he is totally erratic chasing this man everywhere, but the second he steps into church, almost out of habit he takes of his hat.

Ricci's little boy Bruno is absolutely impeccable as well. He gives just the best performance, one can't even imagine. He is so precious throughout the movie that, you are enamored by all of his dialogue and actions.

Any who, I don't want to give a summary because it's already posted at the beginning. However, I do want to say that this movie is worth watching, it is not very long, it has incredible acting, and epitomizes the genre. Overall, just a beautiful film about poverty, desperation, family, and the inevitable and utter injustices that plague the world.

A couple of days after seeing this film I was in the garage, and I saw my bike that hadn't been used for months... I practically had a emotional break down. Check out the movie, and you'll know what I'm talking about.

Great film- cheers!

I get too scared that I might do it injustice by being pretentious and talkng out of my ass.

This is the greatest movie ever made. In my opinion Cinema went downhill after this film cause nothing ever made after this can compare.
I pray that there is one day a DVD re-release of this film that does it justice as so many of you have pointed out. Criterion, where the hell are you? The money you spent on crap like ""The Rock"" or ""Armageddon"" could have been spent here.
I have never seen a film with so much raw emotion. Watching this film for me is like an emotional rollercoaster. I must have watched this at least 100 times. This film never fades and has the power to change the lives of those who watch it. It's one of my missions in life to get people to watch this film. Every person I have shown this film to has thanked me.

951485,5,6304963173,"Imagine your family's livelihood depending on a bicycle. In post-war Italy, you compete with hundreds for a job where 25% of the work force is unemployed.  The job is yours but it requires you to have a bicycle, something so simple as a bicycle and that bicycle gets stolen on the first day. This is about the journey to recover that bicycle.

Neorealism - This wonderful Italian 1948 classic directed by Vittorio de Sica is an emotional depiction of degradation of the soul, loss of humanity and dignity. One of the best in cinematic history, it captures neorealism at its best.

Neorealism involves the use of location settings, non-actor roles, conversational instead of literary dialogue, simple camerawork and editing.  Neorealism offers a compassionate point of view with morality.

Here, we wish an innocent man, with a family to support, could find relief, satisfaction, comfort and justice. No great special effects take place, no shoot-um up bang-bang, just plain old post-war Italy depicting real life, poverty, degradation and humanity.

Desperate -  Antonio, a father and husband lands a job posting movie billboards; the bicycle is stolen! Antonio frantically scours the streets and his little son Bruno tenderly tags along to recover the stolen bicycle. Now keep in mind that little Bruno is in the picture for one reason, and without him, we, the audience, would have a more callous attitude to the ending.

We see signs of post-war economic hard times, like the rows and rows of bicycle parts or hundreds of bedsheets that were pawned.  The characters are non-actors in the real streets of Italy.  You may need to see it more than once to catch everything or to understand its deeper meaning.

Neorealism Director Vittorio de Sica directed 34 feature films and won numerous international prizes. He was honored with four Academy Awards for ""Shoeshine"" in 1947 and ""Bicycle Thief"" in 1949 and other film awards for ""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow"" in 1964 and ""Garden of the Finzi-Continis"" in 1971. He died in 1974.  I believe ""Bicycle Thief"" is one of the best.

""The Bicycle Thief"" is emotional, prodding one to think explicitly into the actions taken.  It surfaces as one of the greates movies of all time.  The VHS 50 year-old film is gritty and at times it is difficult to read the words. See it!  This is based on the VHS copy.. ...MzRizz",1086307200,16,2360,4.921717171717172
951486,4,6304963173,"The Bicycle Thief: a very simple, straightforward story, told straight, no plot-twists or fancy story tricks like false endings, etc. This is a simple story: a man who's work requires him to use his own bicycle or lose his job has his bike stolen from him. The rest of the movie is his and his son's attempt to find the thief and get the bike back.
I understand the plot, but I find it just a little hard to imagine life being so harsh as to put a man out of work for having his bike stolen. I'm not saying it's unrealistic; I didn't live in Italy after WWII. But I found it a tad extreme to be honest. It's a great movie, but I don't think it hits its point home as sharply as Rossellini's ""Rome Open City"".
The DVD is ok - I agree with some reviewers that it could (and indeed should) be transferred at a higher bit-rate with less compression. This film truly derserves the Criterion Treatment if any Italian classic does! It is a better transfer than ""Open City"", but that's not an excuse.

There was little if no music in the background to manipulate emotions from the viewer yet I was extremely moved by the silence in between the dialogue. There is no Hollywood ending.

Taking kindly to stranger but yet having the need to do the immoral; the love of the father for his son both expressed deeply here and reveals them through their eyes by both actors; the timeliness (post-WWII Italy) of the setting could not be any better to express and develop the character of this film.

951491,5,6304963173,"Widely regarded as one of the great films of all time, The Bicycle Thief is easy to avoid because even a brief recitation of the plot is so depressing.
In impoverished post-War Italy, men line up every day to see if the government has any work for them to do.  Ricci is told that there's a job for him,
but it requires a bicycle, so his wife has to pawn her good linen in order to redeem the previously pawned bicycle.  As Ricci and his wife depart the
pawnshop a clerk climbs several stories to add the linens to an immense stack, showing that their situation is hardly unique.  Despite this ignominy,
Ricci is obviously overjoyed to be able to provide for his family and to redeem himself in the eyes of his precocious son, Bruno.
Ricci's job consists of hanging posters and he needs the bicycle to transport a ladder around town. ...
The film is probably the archetypal example of neo-realism, which eschewed fictional adventure in favor of the dramas of every day life.  And it was
understood in its day, and still is by many today, to be some kind of criticism of social inequality.  The suggestion being that in a more just society,
wealth would be distributed more evenly and men wouldn't be reduced to this.  Yet the movie was also chosen for National Review's list of best
conservative films, so what gives?
It seems fair to say that, regardless of the filmmakers original intent, what is portrayed on screen is one of the fundamental reasons that Marxism
failed so completely : Marx assumed that men resented laboring and found it degrading, but in Ricci we see illustrated the great truth that men define
themselves in large part by their work; not only are they not alienated from their labor, they are desperate to labor.  Nor does Ricci appear to be a
man who wants a handout from those who have more than him.  Ricci does not seek equality; he seeks dignity, the dignity that earning a living will
grant him, particularly in the eyes of his son.  He appears to be a man who simply wants a job, and who is destroyed when opportunity is snatched
from his grasp.
I said at the beginning that this is a film you want to avoid because it's depressing, but nothing can prepare you for its violence.  No, not blood and
guts violence, but psychic violence.  In its own humble way, this is a slasher pic, but instead of a knife-wielding maniac slashing co-eds....  The violence hear is done to the soul of a man, a man who is
destroyed as his son looks on.  It is extraordinarily painful to watch, but watch it you must, at least once--it is a great, great film.

Lamberto Maggiorani's portayal of the father struggling to keep his new job is staggering in its simplicity and realism. Just by looking at his face, you can sense the whirlwind of emotions he is feeling.
The star of the show, though, has to be Enzo Staiola as the young son. He brings a sense of frivolity to an otherwise bleak landscape.

How?
He tells his story visually without the usual preachy ""western"" techniques of strained dialogue and ""Freudian"" explanations.  Most dramatic American films with serious themes love to have thier actors stand around and talk.
""Pure Cinema"" is a term that the Europeans coined and was endorsed by Francois Truffaut.  The theory is that you can tell a more compelling story by using strong visuals, as opposed to lengthy dialogue, to progress the narrative of the story. For example, The story line of the Bicycle Thief is this:  Man gets a job, but needs a bike.  Man loses his bike.  Man tries to find his bike...That's it.  Yet De Sica creates a masterpeice out of nothing by the use of stirring visuals and expertly crafted montages of previous presented imagery.
Only a handful of directors have perfected the art of pure cinema.  And I only mean a handful, maybe 6 to 8 in the 100 year history of cinema.  F.W Murnau, Hitchcock, Truffaut, Peterson, and Godart come to mind...Scorsese(too fragmented) and Welles (too egotistical) are not in that class of directors and certainly don't have or never did have the talent to express ""Pure Cinema"".
This ""classic"" should be studied by all film makers, students of film, and historians.  There is a lot of benefit of learning that you can make a film with deep meaning and heartfelt human emotion with a simple premise and an even simpler story.

This  DVD version of an important film is terrible. Image Entertainment usually  makes good digital transfers, and this disc is no exception. But the cause  of my gripe isn't the transfer, it's the print used. The copy that Image  offers on this DVD is in DESPERATE need of restoration. There are all  manner of imperfections in this print -- blotches, streaks, jumps  (sometimes for several frames!), scratches, etc. This makes for a visual  and audio shadow of a great movie. As if this weren't bad enough, the  subtitles are poor. Too many words are left out in the translation, and the  subtitles sometimes come late in relation to the dialogue. On the other  side of the ledger, the English dub is excellently done (except for a brief  section late in the film, seemingly due to the print). The voices are  expertly in sync with the lip movement, and dramatic consistency is  achieved by what appear to be Italian actors.
Since there are no special  features to speak of on the DVD, I'll share some facts about this film that  aren't included on the disc. David O. Selznick (producer of ""Gone With  The Wind"") is reported to have offered backing to ""The Bicycle  Thief,"" on condition that Carey Grant play the father. The star,  Lamberto Maggiorani, was actually a steel factory worker. When he was done  with the film, he went back to work at the factory. There he became  somewhat unpopular with his co-workers, who were apparently envious of his  newfound fame and fortune. Soon thereafter, he found himself unemployed.

It's about an unemployed  man, who gets a job offer that requires a bike, the sacrifice his family  must make to get his bike out of hock, and what happens when the bike is  stolen on the job. It's successful because I think the writers and director  focus on some universal truths--about human nature, love, pride, survival  and--yes--family values.  It's disheartening to read some reviews that say:  ""I was bored,"" ""It wasn't entertaining enough,"" or  ""Enough with the black & white.""  It's also disheartening to  see reviews from people with no concept of this film's historical context.  The poverty of post-WWII Europe produced a revolution in cinema, and this  movie was one that redefined the medium's possibilities.
