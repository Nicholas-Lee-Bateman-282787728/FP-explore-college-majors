8307856,1,B001H5O8RI,"Read the synopsis for this one and thought it would be a little different from the usual B-Movie tropes. The rumored Edison invention that would supposedly allow communication with the dead is a somewhat unique idea for a movie. Being a veteran of low-budget films (i.e. ""The Asylum"", ""SyFy"" movies of the week, Roger Corman movies), I thought I was prepared for what I would see. I was wrong. Production values are off, even from other movies of its type. The lighting is really bad which makes the sets look bad and in turn makes the whole thing look like a cheap soap opera. The ""globe-trotting"" of the master criminals (as per the write-up) is unconvincing to say the least. Story wasn't too bad for this kind of movie, but most of the acting is cringe-worthy to say the least. The ""found footage"" at the beginning of the film is sort of fun and could have been added throughout the movie as exposition. Have to advise to only watch this one to howl at its badness.",1314057600,2,969,4.511363636363637
