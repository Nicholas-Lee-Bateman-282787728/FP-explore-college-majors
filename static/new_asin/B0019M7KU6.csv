 It must have been the writing or the directors on the Star Trek series because Mr. Montgomery put in a great performance in this movie and it's one of the funniest movies I've seen all year. I just finished watching it on Showtime and will be buying it from Amazon. This movie is definitely worth your time.",1252713600,3,530,4.463917525773196

3440053,5,B0019M7KU6,I looooove this movie!  My husband and I saw this 2 day's ago and both of us got completely wrapped up in it.  The message was about so much more than IR.  It doesn't point the finger at interracial relationships as you might think by the title.  The light saber line had us cracking up as we have one on the nights tand!!!  Actually it is a really sweet love story that refreshingly tackles questions that most media and the black community just don't address while not being preachy!  It is so worth the rent.  I am buying this one though because it's worth watching again again:),1241395200,5,582,4.383177570093458
3440054,5,B0019M7KU6,"Originally, the title of this movie was The Inevitable Undoing of Jay Brooks. The distrubters forced them to change it to I'm Through With White Girls since they felt it was more catchy. So don't let the title fool you.

Now to the review. This was an extremely enjoyable film about what happens when a person thinks that their problems in love are due to one thing and they find that their problems are due to themselves. I don't want to give to much of the story away, but Jay Brooks is a guy who comes to the conclusion that his problems in love are due to the fact that he has only dated white women. What he finds though is that his problems are of his own making and that race and class had nothing to do with it.

I enjoyed this movie because it is not a stereotypical movie. There is in fact a funny scene where two people see each other as stereotypes. The movie is a colorful mix of characters surrounding the love story two people who themselves are figuring things out and in the process help Jay Brooks figure out himself. The film is also about growth for several characters in the movie and also about what one will do for love and how it can cause one to overcome their deepest fears.

Buy this movie if you love quirky, funny, romance movies.",1235174400,24,1259,4.281512605042017
3440055,5,B0019M7KU6,"Horrible title for one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. At best the charm this this movie exudes compares to ""Slumdog Millionaire"", at worse a Tyler Perry movie. Even so it is very funny and even, makes fun of Tyler Perry-type movies where Black people are only portrayed as Lawyers, Pro-Athletes or Best-Selling Authors. Here you get all of that and more. The characters are well drawn in a multitude of dimensions and flavors. In fact the movie has absolutely nothing to do with the title after the first few minutes. Like Slumdog Millionaire it charms us from the way it shows the struggle of a lovable underdog fitting into the cookie cut out complexity that is commercial society whiles trying to find the truth about himself and love.
I don't even know how I found this movie on Netflix, furthermore I don't even know why I bothered to see it since the title suggest something of a lowball Wayan Brothers comedy. But the viewer reviews were 100% positive and I too will add my 100% positive.
That said, someone needs to change the title of this movie if it will ever be taken for a serious comedy. This one is up there with the best of them (Also reminds me of 40 Year Old Virgin)",1235088000,14,1198,4.45
3440056,5,B0019M7KU6,"This will have to go down as my favorite movie I've seen this year. It was on cable at the crack of dawn one Saturday morning and I watched it from about the midpoint to the end thinking it was going to be corny...needless to say, I ended up watching it again later that day so I could see the entire thing. I thought it was funny and the characters were well developed. Great flick!",1233532800,4,383,4.12
3440057,5,B0019M7KU6,"As a French-Canadian woman married to a mixed-race man -- a graphic artist no less who likes some nerdie pursuits such as comic books, writing his own graphic novels, coin collecting, Japanese war movies -- I was astonished to see a movie that would make as its central character someone like Jay Brooks, with his glasses, sketchbooks and line of creative patter to the world around him.

""I'm Through With White Girls"" might sound like something along the lines of Spike Lee's ""Jungle Fever"" (who knows with such a title)? Actually on first impression, it doesn't make much of a deal out of interracial dating per se, showing how common it is in modern-day Los Angeles.

The texture of the film at first is a bit like a student film project, with some of the audio muffled and a lovely simplicity. However, as Jay moved from his white girl phase to the hilarious ""Operation Brown Sugar"" and ultimately to the girl of his dreams, a biracial Canadian writer named Catherine with Valley Girl elocution, the film grew on me more and more.

Jay's mind is so nimble, and his friends including a white hip-hop fan so appealing, that there is much to like here.

There is fabulous dialogue throughout -- who knew an Arrested Development writer was involved?

I don't want to spoil the fun by quoting many specifics of the dialogue, but you just have to love it when Catherine asks Jay to name the prime minister of Canada before she will accept a date, and when Jay can't and says ""Are you going to make me beg?"" and he adds, ""Beg like Mars Blackman or James Brown?"" This retort eventually sets up a lovely denouement.

Can't think of any film that I watched on a whim that was more of a sleeper than this. I can tell by the other reviews here that this is a hit with others who are not graphic artists, writers or in an interracial relationship, because there are some universal observations in ""I'm Through With White Girls"" about family, friends, attraction and commitment worth spending time on.",1233360000,7,1992,4.612994350282486
3440058,5,B0019M7KU6,"Wow, they really chose the wrong cover art for this DVD.  They're trying to make it look like a Tyler Perry flick, which it decidedly is not.  It's really a quirky, hip indie film with lots of personality.  What it may lack in production value, it more than compensates for with excellent characters and a sincere and fresh examination of racial issues in our culture.  Let me also mention that this is a romantic comedy from a uniquely male perspective, dealing with things like fear of commitment in a way that most Hollywood romantic comedies don't really seem to get (except perhaps High Fidelity).  In conclusion: don't let the cover art fool you.  The studios seem to be aiming this movie at the wrong target audience.  The right audience, in my opinion, is 20-something hipsters, particularly guys.",1227398400,10,805,4.8321167883211675

I was priviledged to catch this film at the American Black Film Festival last year ('07) and it was definitely an audience favorite. To all the ""white"" folks who might be put off by the title: Don't be! Courtney Lily who wrote the film has also written for the shows Arrested Development, Everybody Hates Chris and My Boys and the same quirky, tounge-in-cheek style is apparent throughout.

The film is definitely different and/but? it works in every way.

I liked it again. It was about an awkward black guy in his late 20's or early 30's wanting to find a black female. He grew tired of having relationships with different white females. He went on speed dating with random black females but unsuccessfully. Therefore, he asked his cousin's fiancee to hook him up with a black female.

3440070,1,B0019M7KU6,"Whattttt? Huhhh? What the effff?

I thought this was going to be funny, like the robbed-by-the-Academy Wayans Bros. classic, ""White Girls."" As a white girl, that movie speaks to me. It's the song of my people. I wrote a letter to the Academy about how the Wayans Bros. were robbed of a certain short gold statue by The Man, but nothing came of it. What about all those touching scenes in pajamas, where the White Girls (undercover), slowly begin to understand how women really feel when men disappoint women in relationships? How we cry and lose our self-esteem? Then they braid each other's hair and validate each other, and begin the journey to self-respect (and understanding between the genders).

Then the White Girls teach some boys a lesson at Hoops! Then it's a Dance-Off!! Whooooo! But not before we sing along to that one classic song that was used as a Zales ad forever! Umm.....  how does that go.... I know there's tinkly piano....

There wasn't anything like that in this movie. It was totally stupid and not at all like White Girls. I still think it's totally racist that the Wayans Bros. never received a phone call from a short golden man named Oscar for that fine piece of ground-breaking cinema.

THIS MOVIE IS NOT AS GOOD AS WHITE GIRLS. It's NOT like that movie at all. It should NOT have that title in it! Very misleading, ladies.

Sucked! (If you loved ""White Girls"")

3440120,2,B0019M7KU6,"How about a movie titled ""I'm through with black girls.""  Or ""I've had my fill of Asian women."" Or ""I'm tired of Hispanic chicks.""  The title is both sexist and racist, and it wouldn't be tolerated by any other ethnicity, would it?",1345766400,2,231,4.476190476190476

But it turns out the title was just for shock value. The opportunity for commentary on the pitfalls of black/white relationships was squandered. We don't actually get to see the main character in any sort of relationship with white women. Instead this movie is about the main character's insecurities and fear of commitment.

And that HAS been done, too many times, and usually better than this. This film can be summed up with one line from the script: ""It's not about color or class...and you know it."" Except you know, when it's about ALL of those things.

3440146,1,B0019M7KU6,"I really wanted to like I'm Thru With White Girls (ITWWG), but sadly, my high expectations for the film were not met. I saw the movie listed here on Amazon, and opted to give it a peep (the fact that it was less than a buck didn't hurt either).

The only impactful scene in the whole movie for me, was the bus scene, where Jay is sitting between a white girl and a black girl. I've found myself in that very same scenario before (and not just on the bus; at work, at events, etc). However, this less than one minute scene, the ""romantic institution"" conversation and the bar scene where Jay and his white buddy are discussing why Jay doesn't date black girls are the only scenes are relevance in the whole film.

I say ""relevance"", because the film is called ITWWG. I expected the film to confront all the myths and stereotypes about interracial dating (the Asian girl scene came close, but no cigar), while promoting black love. But in all actuality, this movie went the weak route, and dealt with the ever clichd commit-phobic man. As other reviewers have said, the title is totally deceptive; this film could've been called ""I'm Thru With The WRONG Girls"", or some such, and no one would've been the wiser.

The characters were incredulous, to the point of being caricatures. For instance, Jay comments on the type of Brothas that Black women go for in lieu of him: the ""alpha male, football player-meets-lawyer"" types. If only that were true. I personally fit more or less into that category (not a lawyer, but professionally employed, educated and athletically built). I'm more like Jay's friend Drake in the film, and I've had many of the same dilemmas that Jay was having. Jay's character was so far to the left, that it made that aspect of the story unbelievable. I mean, of course nobody was checkin' for a Mars Blackmon-meets-Pee-Wee Herman-meets-Lupe Fiasco wanna be, with commitment issues. News flash: not all of us are commit-phobes either. The only thing Jay and I have in common, is our affinity for Sci-Fi. But unlike Jay, I don't walk around looking and acting like the action figures I collect. Again, Jay's friend Drake is more apropos, as the closet geek disguised as a ""normal guy"". And that would've been a far more compelling story.

Likewise, Catherine comes off just as unbelievable and stereotypical as Jay does. If a ""Half-rican"" girl with strips of colored yarn in her hair (really? You couldn't find an actress with REAL dreads? As a dread-head myself, I'm offended), and a lifetime of psychological issues is the best Jay could accomplish with ""Operation Brown Suga"", then there's not much hope for guys like me who have struggled to gain acceptance with Black women.

Just like Jay is not the every-brother, Catherine is not the shining example of the free-thinking black woman. Fortunately for me, after an adult lifetime of failed attempts, I was finally able to connect with such a woman. And yes, she actually looks, talks and acts like a Black woman.

Another thing that bugged me about the film, was the tired, clichd portrayal of Black families. Really, hasn't the ghetto vs ""bougie"" story been done to death? There is far more diversity amongst the Black community, than just those 2 sides of the cultural spectrum. But apparently movie makers and authors are not aware of that. Oh, and how is a Mango Lassi an ""exotic drink""? It's basically just the Indian version of a fruit smoothie. There are Black folks out there, that eat more than hamhocks and collard greens, you know. It'd be nice to see us get a fair representation in the media every now and then. By the way, jokes about the ""Itis"" were funny when Dave Chappelle and the Boondocks did it. Now it's just redundant. Also, what was up with the 2 main characters smoking all the time? Granted, it worked for the most part as a plot device, but is that really the message we wanna send, that it's cool to puff cancer sticks 24/7? Yeah, I'm good on that.

This is why I don't frequent black cinema. Upon first seeing the title, which tickled my pro-Black fancy, I'd really hoped the film would promote Black love. Even though Jay did get the girl in the end, the girl he got looks, talks, and acts precisely like every other girl he had before, so what was really the difference? I get that the film was trying to be funny, or hip, or whatever, but all that was missed on this viewer.

if you have ever dated or contemplated dating interracially, or just plain old questioned the existence of ""real love"", then this is a must see romantic comedy.",1281916800,,668,5.466019417475728

3440153,4,B0019M7KU6,"Many moments of enjoyment. Quite a few laughs. Many corny lines by some has been virtual unknowns or perhaps a more applicable statement may be, a visit to some D list actors/actresses. Johnny Brown (Good Times'-book man,buffalo butt) Is still acting. The characters' lines are amateurish, lame and unfunny for the must part, yet the storyline does culminate by sending a serious message that saves this movie. A comedic approach to a serious and somewhat profound subject that I therefore recommend.",1264809600,,500,5.185185185185185
3440154,5,B0019M7KU6,"This movie was GREAT! Not the typical Black film, but VERY California centered. It deals not only with interracial dating, but also issues of mixed ethnicities, class issues and what is considered Black or not Black. It has interesting characters, and through most of it is highly amusing. I loved this movie.",1262908800,,309,4.961538461538462

8274496,5,B0019M7KU6,I am a 35 year old black woman who's spent my whole life being the only black person surrounded by white people. It was as if J took my experience and and a movie out of it. I too made a declaration to never date another white guy. I did however end up marrying a white guy 10 years ago ad it was the best decision I ever made. I would love to see other projects from this person.,1463875200,,380,3.8227848101265822

8274498,5,B0019M7KU6,"This film gives a humorous and serious look at interracial dating and those who feel the need for acceptance. Jay feels ostracized because of his tastes in music, culture and women. He learns a valuable lesson, nonetheless. This film says what a lot of people think, but are afraid to say.",1460160000,,289,4.686274509803922

8274501,4,B0019M7KU6,I enjoyed this movie.  It really shines a light on the difficulties it is easy to encounter in dating.  Shows that in order to date successfully you must have yourself on the right wavelength first.  It also shows that love comes in all forms of acceptance.  I thought the plot was well written.,1456790400,,295,4.509433962264151
