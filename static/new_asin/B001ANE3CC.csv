8278133,5,B001ANE3CC,"I've seen a lot of snowboarding movies, most are heavy on style, low on substance.  That's not always a bad thing when you are getting amped for the slopes, but sometimes after watching the hundredth handrail you long for something more. Craig Kelly was an early pioneer of snowboarding. After winning world titles, massive sponsorship deals, Craig left it all behind for the true backcountry experiences and to pioneer freeriding.  Amazingly, success still followed.  He didn't stop there and was on the way to becoming the first mountain guide on splitboard before he was killed in an avalanche.  It's Craig's amazing evolution as a rider, his introspective philosophy, and his endless quest further into the soul of the sport and of the mountains that make this movie a compelling story worth watching more than once.  I'd recommend having this in your library if you are a snowboarder looking for a deeper connection to the sport.",1380067200,,934,5.0

This is for you. Well done documentary with incredible footage, and some of the most influential riders, Kiethe Wallce,Steve Mathews, and the list goes on.",1337472000,,390,4.213333333333333
8278136,5,B001ANE3CC,"I am not one to claim heroes in my life. I began to snowboard at the age of 18. Craig Kelly taught me to ride. I have been a disciple of his riding style and philosophy ever since I discovered the purpose of camber radius. This dvd is an important piece of history on the evolution and progression of snowboarding by one of its greatest masters. get it, study it and practice. you won't regret it.",1329350400,,397,4.2368421052631575
