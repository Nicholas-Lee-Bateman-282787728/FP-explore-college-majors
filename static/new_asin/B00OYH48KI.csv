8685327,3,B00OYH48KI,"The only real problem is that these two DVD's for the Nikon Df are simply not enough to cover the huge amount of subject matter.  The thick manual that comes with the Nikon Df isn't even enough to adequately cover the subject.  Hell !  You could make this material into a semester-long course for credit in a photography school !

So ... even with that restriction, these DVD's help and aren't bad for the price.  I would recommend them but they should be used in conjunction with the Nikon Df manual that comes with the camera.",1440806400,,528,4.458333333333333
