8234666,4,B000Z16G1Q,"The original ""Conan the Barbarian"" was a much imitated/copied film in low budget filmmaker circles in the early '80s, especially in Italy.  One such rip-off that is largely unknown and has been lost to time is ""the Invincible Barbarian,"" which saw its initial Italian release in 1982 before being picked up by an American distributor under its repackaged and dubbed version, complete with phony American names inserted in the credits, in 1983.

The film concerns an ancient star prophecy in which a boy is predetermined to be the ""Chosen One,"" and he is indeed born to his mother while an evil horde of barbarians slaughters his village, his birth mother included.  He is thus raised by a sect of warrior chicks, most of whom are totally hot in their skimpy short skirts attire.  His remaining goal is to avenge his mother and village's untimely death against the said band of lunkhead nasties.

That in fact is the main strength of this film, is the preponderance of long-legged Italian babes wielding swords and shields, that and the cheesy and badly dubbed dialogue that is vacuous enough to be entertaining.  And the final third of the movie is graced by the presence of one Sabrina Siani, who was at her peak here at age 19 and appeared in a number of similar low budget sword epics during 1982-83 (not to mention the post-apocalyptic trash entry&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2020-Texas-Gladiators/dp/B000MGHAN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2020 Texas Gladiators</a>).  Fans of Sabrina may have been disappointed by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ator-The-Fighting-Eagle/dp/B007HMCQ6A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ator The Fighting Eagle</a>, in which she remains fully clothed throughout, or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Conquest/dp/B0002C9DJU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Conquest</a>&nbsp;(1983), in which while she appears nude, her gorgeous face and blonde hair is obscured by a gold face mask.  Not so here.  ""the Invincible Barbarian"" may be the most choice footage of Sabrina available, as she plays a breeder slave here who is stark naked (other than a primitive g-string -- I guess they had those in ancient times also) for most of her screen time.  The Italians had a reputation for being explicit like this and maybe this is why this film has never seen a DVD release (though you can find decent DVD-r copies for sale on the internet if you search for them).

All in all, while there are some slow spots in the story here and there, I had a rather good time with this one for its high camp appeal and revealing images of Sabrina in her absolute prime.  The Italians deliver on some tacky exploitation yet again.",1315008000,6,2758,5.603365384615385
