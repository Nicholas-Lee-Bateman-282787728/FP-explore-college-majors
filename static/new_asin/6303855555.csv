723145,1,6303855555,"I realize that we know longer live in a culture that appreciates the richness of the English language.  I understand that the average person does not spend his or her free time reading classic 19th century novels.  I  also understand that sensationalism sells.  However, I do not understand  how a movie as sexually charged and inane as this version of ""The  Scarlet Letter"" made it past the cutting room.  Demi Moore reduces  Hawthorne's riveting and complex character of Hester Prynne to a 17th  century sexpot.  Gary Oldman changes the perpetually guilty milquetoast,  Arthur Dimmesdale, to Mr. Right.  The richness of the novel was completely  disregarded to be replaced by a cheap thrill.  Horrible!",919728000,5,704,5.115044247787611

723265,3,6303855555,"Scarlet Letter
 The book I read for my last book project was The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne. This book is set in the 17th century and it is about a woman named Hester Prynne being punished for adultery. She had a child out of wedlock and this was against the beliefs of the time. Her daughter was named Pearl. She is named this because she is pure and perfect unlike her mother. Her mother has a Scarlet Letter A embroidered onto her chest so that everyone knows, for the rest of her life, that she committed adultery. The townspeople did not believe that she should keep her daughter, because they think that she is a devil child because of her mother committing this crime. The reason Hester committed adultery was because her husband was gone for long periods of time and she found a new guy in Boston, where she lived, and she couldn't handle her husband being gone any longer. When I was reading this book I got confused a lot but I felt like Hester Prynne would not have been punished if she did this in todays society just because it has changed so much. I really recommend reading this book. I feel like it is really hard to read but it is information filled and is good to know these kinds of things.",1494460800,,1220,4.3744493392070485

723270,1,6303855555,This movie had nothing to do with the novel The Scarlet Letter. I doubt either star had read let alone understood what the significance of the Scarlet Letter would be.

723486,2,6303855555,"After just reading Hawthorne's book by the same name, I found the liberties taken with the story to be over much.  I can see expanding the tale to tell the back story on the romance between Hester and Arthur.  But I would love to have seen the movie makers stick more closely to the plot.  Of course that probably wouldn't see well, so the ending was grossly altered.  However I did think Demi Moore's portrayal of Hester was quite believable.  But, changing the outcome of the minister's guilt for his hypocracy, resulting in his death, in exchange for a free thinking couple who saw themselves pure in God's eyes who lived happily ever after did a disservice to the plot.  In the original, it was Arthur who dies, not the doctor.  And while the doctor seemed to be getting revenge by his continual vexing of the minister, the subtleties of his wiles merely heightened the guilt of the other.  In the end the doctor showed kindness to the love child of the offending couple, seems out of character had vengence been his main motive.",1453593600,,1033,4.576086956521739

723567,1,6303855555,"If you are a devotee of the wonderfully ill-conceived and unintentionally hilarious (as I am) it's impossible to extoll in sufficient detail the pleasures that await you in this famously absurd production of The Scarlet Letter. A cast of wonderful distinguished actors, a big budget, great gusto, glorious production values--this one has it all, except for, well, competent direction and a script that expresses any clue about Hawthorne's novel. What we have here is a kind of spirited hallucinogenic mashup combining (1) a Classics Illustrated version of a couple of scenes from the novel, (2) a late-twentieth century take on the Salem Witchcraft trials, and (3) a fever-dream combo of King Phillip's War and the climax from the Errol Flynn version of Robin Hood. I won't spoil the Turkeyfest with too much detail here: let me say only that the jaw-droppingly ludicrous love scene alone is worth the price of admission, as magical editing keeps moving us back and forth between  Dimmesdale and Hester's tender mating in-the-grain-bin and shots of Hester's servant Mituba (yes! change one letter and you have a historical figure) as she disrobes and steps into Hester's roomy redwood Puritan Special hot tub, all the while while lasciviously eyeing a spray-painted Red Bird Of Passion who perches atop the tub. It's not clear quite how these two are going to commune beyond their inexplicably suggestive eye contact, but a bird can dream, I guess. Golden Turkey fans, it gets no more glorious than this :-)",1446854400,4,1507,5.076612903225806

Pretty much everything else was completely different. I can understand the changes though. It would probably have been difficult to create a movie about two people that committed adultery and felt really bad about it, then considered running away together right before the guy died. That movie wouldn't have been very appealing to the majority of the population in the 90's. Overall, it was a decent movie.",1430697600,2,565,4.957894736842105

It looks like the screenwriter basically took Puritan New England, threw it in a blender, and then they filmed what spattered out. The basic story of Hester Prynne and Dimmesdale is 'sort of' here, but they added in witchcraft, devil's marks and even an Indian attack that kills Hester's old husband just to liven things up.
As someone who teaches this book, I will never use this movie in class-too confusing and silly. The PBS version, while not the best filmed thing in the world is a faithful adaptation (no Indian attacks, for one), and although it is less exciting than this version, it is way better.",1418342400,,756,4.69172932330827

It's more like a modern ""Variations on a Theme by Nathaniel Hawthorne,"" or one of those Fantasias that 19th- century composers used to write with a famous, much-older melody as a starting point.

That said, I enjoyed this movie quite a lot. The depiction of late 18th/early 19th century Native American civilization on the Northeastern Seaboard is vividly and richly imagined; don't think I've ever seen this in a film before. Gary Oldman, as a wonderfully sexy and yet perfectly pure young Rev. Dimmesdale, probably would have pleased Hawthorne on the whole, and his chemistry with Demi Moore's obviously anachronistic, but compelling, Hester Prynne is delicious (their scene in the barn is very hot indeed).

Finally, something has to be said about the gorgeous John Barry score. What lovely, memorable film music!

The oversexualization of Hester's bath scene, the mute slave woman watching her like a peeping tom followed by the physical examination of the same slave woman by the hideous witch hunters/religious men was offensive and totally unnecessary. [Why not have one of the suspected young white women strip and be touched by those men?] The low ratings and poor box office returns were deserved for this film.

724593,3,6303855555,"Okay, it wasn't that bad. The soundtrack was gorgeous, very Dancing with Wolves.

The first half of the movie helped to clarify what Hawthorne's novel, the Scarlett Letter, left vague and unclear. The rest of the movie, however, seemed to miss what the novel intended by a mile.

The last scene should have been Hester, Arthur Dimmesdale, Pearl and Roger Prynne all on that scaffold together, with Arthur dying, clutching his heart. This is a very rich, layered and operatic scene. It was non-existent in the movie.

Sometimes you wonder if the people who produced the movie even read the novel. Arthur Dimmesdale's character, specifically, is supposed to be losing strength because he's weakening under living a lie. But he looked powerful and strong to me, running around, riding a horse. Arthur was also supposed to be seen clutching his heart on occasions (it's to signify the pain he is under while choosing to live a lie). This is all very clear in the novel, and you don't even have to read all that closely to pick up on these key actions.

And when you start cutting and changing from what the novel intended, then the rest of the story starts to fall apart. The second half of the novel picks up when Pearl is 7 years old. In the movie, by trying to do the whole thing while Pearl is a baby, we miss out on some deeply thematic and layered scenes. In the novel, Pearl is a feisty child, she refused to let Arthur Dimmesdale kiss her, because she can't understand how Arthur can hug her in private, but ignore her and her mother in public. Since Pearl is a baby in the movie, instead of a precocious 7-year-old, she can't express much of this, can she? No.

Character transformations. Weak! The novel mapped this out for the screenwriters, too! But because of all the changes, the character transformations go virtually undetected. In the movie, Hester is defiant and powerful from the beginning. That's not the case in the novel. Sure she's defiant, but it's very nuanced, but nonetheless, Hester is still weak in the beginning. And towards the end of the novel, Hester gained more and more strength, while her lover, Arthur Dimmesdale, weakens, and so did Roger Prynne as a matter of fact; Roger was consumed by his own jealousy. These transformations happened toward the end almost one after the next, like a symphony coming to a close. This is what makes the novel a classic.

But for what it's worth the movie was entertaining, at least. But read the novel, it is a first-class opera!",1339891200,,2498,4.665909090909091
724594,3,6303855555,"Literary purists will understandably take exception to this adaptation of Nathaniel Hawthorne's book (which proves something of a tawdry bodice-ripper).  On the other hand, if one can look past this, the Scarlet Letter is engaging and passionate filmmaking.  Although Demi Moore is not especially interesting in the role of Hester Prynne, Gary Oldman delivers one of his better performances in the role of the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale.  The supporting cast (including luminaries of the British stage like Joan Plowright, Roy Dotrice and Edward Hardwicke) are even more impressive.  Robert Duvall is thoroughly hair-raising as Rodger Prynne (who returns to Hester a raving madman after years in the wilderness).

Though set in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the film was actually shot in the Pacific Northwest (and one wonders what all those giant Douglas Firs are doing in New England!), but this is all part of the stylized (albeit sometimes over-the-top) approach of director Roland Joffe.  John Barry's score bathes the film in lush, aural splendor, and forms a pleasing compliment to the shimmering photography of Alex Thomson (Excalibur).",1338595200,,1144,5.435028248587571

724599,1,6303855555,"Hawthorne is likely spinning in his grave. Were it mathematically possible, I'd give this cinematic train wreck negative zero stars and then apply an exponent!!!  However, since that is an obvious impossibility, I'll just confine myself to offering up the following diatribe; here it goes:

This horror show disguised as an ""adaptation"" of the greatest American novel ever penned was indeed painful to watch. Having read Hawthorne's brilliant masterpiece numerous times, this movie was an abysmal disappointment...indeed a bastardization of a classic! When approaching a great literary-work-turned-motion-picture, I quite frankly, do not expect it ever to live up to the book; however, this screenplay missed many apparent opportunities to explore a number of themes that would have made the visual presentation of the novel much more riveting. To inject 20th century characterizations into a drama set 3 centuries prior (in the Massachusetts Bay Colony) was absolutely ludicrous. Having said all that, the greatest insult to the novel, was the alternate ending the director concocted, with Hester and the Rev. triumphantly riding off into the sunset! How utterly absurd, and yes sophomoric, and yes too ""Hollywood!""  The screenwriter's justification of these 2 characters diminished the power and the significance of the story's premise. By contrast, the novel's ending conveyed the strong message of sin and atonement Hawthorne intended; Hester having become liberated through her own penitence, while the Rev. Dimmesdale became encumbered by consuming infirmities due to his keeping his iniquities hidden from public examination. I've enjoyed reading The Scarlet Letter since high school, and I completely concur with the evaluations of my fellow reviewers who decry the tragedy of this failed attempt at bringing to film one of the greatest seminal works of American genius. Thank you all for your thoughtful and inspired comments. Nathaniel Hawthorne's moving masterwork of the human condition, i.e. man's struggle with fleshly appetites and the consequences thereof in juxtaposition to the redemptive work of contrition has been reduced to a convoluted macabre farce of who hangs and for what...only to hang no one in the end due to a senseless and contrived Indian uprising. I understand the concept of creative license, but to stray so terribly far from the original text sadly marginalizes Hawthorne's powerful message of transgression and redemption, hypocrisy and tolerance.

From a very small part as a taxi driver in Bullet to major parts in the Godfather films, Robert Duvall should have been seen more in The Scarlet Letter as he is such a superb actor.

I quite often look at who is doing the music score for a film.  If it is the like of John Barry, Jerry Goldsmith or James Horner you know it is one to see and even add to the collection.  In this case it is the late and great JOHN BARRY.  He should have been nominated and received yet another Academy for this score.  He was able to make the film speak it's story line via music and give the beauty of the British Columbia locations the correct interpolation with the dramatics of the script.

I feel the only fault was that the picture was not presented in the WidescreeN (2.40.1) format.

Out of 5 stars I give THE SCARLET LETTER a big 4 and with sincere thanks to Amazon for making it available to me.

724601,5,6303855555,"I know there is a lot of controversy about this movie, mainly with the fact that it has nothing to do with the book. I have seen a very old film that I would guess is from the 80s or earlier that follows the book pretty closely, I watched this in school a long time ago. As for this rendition, it is just taking a few key concepts from the book and the rest is from the writers imagination.

You're probably wondering why I gave this movie 5 stars. Well, for one, it has Demi Moore and Gary Oldman. Demi Moore is not one of my favorites, but she fits this role nicley. Gary Oldman has not been in many substantial roles in movies, but I like him in anything he does. Not to mention, he is gorgeous in this movie...and you get to see quite a bit of him...let's just say it's not for the kids. Either way, I thought both of them did an amazing job and they have great chemistry with each other that is perfect for their roles. You can feel the emotion in every scene.

Now, I would say this is more for the girls than the guys. It's a great movie to watch alone with a bowl of popcorn and tissues close by. I have never read a romance novel, but I would say that if you like those, you will surely appreciate this movie. This movie deserves at least one run through.

It was an excellent film, albeit not exactly faithful to the original novel, and though this really irks me when it comes to other adaptations, I was quite fine with the liberties taken here, though I think a movie version can be done that is closer to the source material. The music by John Barry (the James Bond films, ""Somewhere In Time,"" ""Dances With Wolves"") is just beautiful. Demi Moore, Gary Oldman and Robert Duvall were wonderful, as always. Since Mr. Hawthorne is silent as to the circumstances of how Hester Prynne and the father of her child met, I think it's entirely plausible that it could have happened the way this version depicts, but everyone has their own interpretation of events.

***CONTAINS SPOILERS***

For the record, I've never read ""The Scarlet Letter."" It's in my TBR pile, but I doubt I'll get to it anytime soon.  I've read other Hawthorne and not been that excited by it. I'm familiar with the synopsis of ""The Scarlet Letter"" so I'm aware the film varies tremendously from the novel.

I like this film.  It's entertaining.  I regret missing it on the big screen.  The rental is pan and scan and I know the location shots would be far more stunning in widescreen views.  It's not the greatest film I've ever seen, but it's an attractive historical romance with a lovely soundtrack, solid casting, gorgeous costumes, and a better than average storyline.

The script suffers a bit, attempting to combine witchcraft scares and Indian conflicts into the plot.  The issues got spead a bit thin in places.

Hester Prynne came across as this extremely proud, independent, self-sacrificing woman.  This is cool given the film's romantic bent, but it got a bit much.  No matter what, Hester stands up to injustice, even when it costs her dearly.  It crossed the line from heroic to ridiculous, especially after the birth of her daughter, Pearl.

Arthur Dimmesdale (portrayed by Gary Oldman) is an artless, charming, innocent man.  A bit too conveniently innocent at times.  The script does its best to portray Arthur as a good man and a passive figure in the more dramatic events in the story.  He comes across as very gentle, intellectual, and sensitive. But it's hard to look past his more cowardly moments.  The storyline suggests Hester is the more dominant figure in the couple and she essentially chooses to challenge the establishment while demanding her lover's silence to protect him.  The script also takes artistic license to create urgency on Hester's part -- Arthur will suffer death by hanging should Hester name him the father of her child. This is understandable, but not really admirable in a romantic hero.  He's no ""alpha male"" by any means.

Robert Duvall (Roger Prynne/Chillingworth) ""takes over"" the film an hour or so into the action.  He's a disturbed, menacing, soft-spoken villain with an inner Jack the Ripper lingering oh so near the surface.  Conflict boils between him and Hester and adds to the story's tension.  The film is worth watching simply to watch the incredible tightrope balance Duvall walks in portraying this villain, equal parts sinister and sympathetic.

Support casting is excellent.  I wish the writers could have come up with a more original name for Hester's female slave, Mituba (a nod to Tituba of the Salem witch trials.) One success of this film was the ability to create a diversity of characters much like a real life small town community.  Not everyone in the colony was a starched shirt and a hypocrite, I appreciate that.

Another problem: the film seemed to want to comment socially on feminism, racism, religious discrimination and hypocrisy.  Witchcraft trials and Indian conflicts (echoing ""Last of the Mohicans) spread the plot a bit thin considering the heated love triangle between Hester, Arthur, and Roger. The expansion on Hester and Arthur's love story and Roger's derrangement eat miles of word count and screen time,leaving these other features feeling a bit ""thrown in.""

The dialogue is interesting and eloquent and the cast executes it nicely.  I think the conversations sound like credible conversations historical people might have.  The soundtrack and lighting is dreamily beautiful.

Costume lovers will eat up this film.  Like the diversity of the colonists (social class, economic status) various styles representing the era feature prominently throughout the film.  Moore's costumes are gorgeous (I don't know how realistic, but lovely to look at.)

The film contains very brief nude scenes (all three main characters) and a love scene that was probably pretty standard for its time.  I found it a bit long but tasteful, more sensual than ""porny."" There are also two brief scenes featuring sexual abuse (attempted rape) I felt the film could have done without.

I liked this film and recommend it as an entertaining historical romantic drama.",1301788800,2,4173,5.0541727672035135

724687,1,6303855555,I am a bit baffled that this film is labeled an adaptation of Nathaniel Hawthorne's masterpiece.  The only things it shares with the novel are characters' names and the time period.  This film single-handedly dismantles an American classic.  Classics should NOT be tampered with.  This is a laughable attempt at making a film from this timeless novel.  I find nothing redeemable about it at all.,1285977600,,395,5.015384615384615
724688,1,6303855555,"In its defense, this film version of ""The Scarlet Letter"" states upfront that it is ""freely adapted"" from the Hawthorne novel. I felt warned. I did not, however, feel prepared for the eventual massacre of some of Hawthorne's richest themes in this tale.

The opening scene makes it clear the story will veer far from its source material when we are introduced to Native Americans and the building animosity between them and the local colonists. We then meet attractive and self-assured Hester Prynne (Demi Moore) as she arrives from England, part of the latest batch of villagers to come under the thumb of Puritanical leaders. As Hester looks for a seaside house for her and her husband, who has sent her on ahead, she is waylaid by a licentious young man. He's not the first to cast an eye upon the fair maiden, and soon the town's minister, played by Gary Oldman, becomes equally enchanted by this headstrong woman. Their obvious attraction for each other is held in check by propriety, morality, and the ever-watching eyes of the religious authorities. Later, though, evidence indicates that Hester's husband has been murdered by Indians, and she is free at last from those domestic restraints to pursue her shared attraction with the lonely minister.

We are over 2/3 of the way through the story before it shows any signs of following the book. Yes, the first hour and fifteen minutes could have happened, as part of the story's setup; and yes, Moore and Oldham are competent actors for this script. Sadly, however, the ham-handed attempts to build racial and religious tension fail to catch the subtleties in Hawthorne's writing. In fact, there are probably less than five lines of dialogue taken from the actual book. Robert Duvall overacts his part. The lighting is romanticized. The violence is upgraded. The sensuality is on full display. A strange element of voodoo is thrown in for greater drama. As the movie steams toward its climax, the director seems hellbent on throwing aside all of that which made Hawthorne's message work. In fact, the lead characters ride off into the sunset (saved in the final moments by a scene stolen from ""Robin Hood""), whereas the book shows Hester being freed by her daily confession of sin while the minister's very health is threatened by the concealment of his own own.

I'm a big Hawthorne fan, and ""The Scarlet Letter"" is my favorite of his novels. I'm also a fan of some of Demi Moore's movies, and Gary Oldman has some fine moments (such as in the recent ""Book of Eli""). What could have been a fantastic pairing with a strong script falls prey to Hollywood's insistence on more action, more sex, more violence, and less depth. This shows little resemblance to its source, and even less respect. It is a disgrace of a film.",1276387200,6,2775,4.813417190775682
724689,1,6303855555,"Sign 1 that they just didn't care: Hester's ""scarlet"" letter is GOLD!  So the title is summarily completely smashed into irrelevancy by a mere STUPID DESIGN CHOICE.

There's a very strong implication around the movie that SOMEONE involved in the whole making of this film either did not read the book at all, or did not read the book and received a brief summary from which they began to pick and choose what to film.

And for what?  What's the purpose of making a film version of a complex moral tale and classic, and proceed to completely miss the point while crafting their own incoherent tale within a context that not even the director understands---What's so bad about a 17th century (or 19th century, as the director once stated) woman having an affair with a REVEREND, even if her husband is missing?

Unless you and your spouse have an open-relationship where you both have sex with others outside of wedlock and are fine with this, then this is a question that rarely needs to be asked, ESPECIALLY in 1600s PURITANICAL America!

Arbitrary scenes of Hollywood-style sex and sexual titilation are there just for whatever, and the end scene involves TOTALLY RANDOM INDIAN ATTACK! as a Deus Ex Machina to save the cuddly heroes who are too pretty to be executed by stuffy Puritans!

Hilarity reaches peak levels when Demi Moore defends it by claiming ""Well, not many people have read the book!""  Even given the propensity for some 80-90% of High School Students not reading a REQUIRED READING book by going through cliff notes or relying on other kids to help them, it's a very strong case to say her statement is false to a degree of laughing out loud.

And again, what was the point of making the letter on her dress GOLDEN?!

I was worried that Demi Moore might not have the range to handle the role of Mistress Prynne, but she is excellent... She is strong, passionate, intelligent and damaged... In another place and time she might have been a leader; in this movie she is quite believable as the woman who defends her love at all costs... Gary Oldman looks perfect as Reverend Dimmesdale... He projects force and sexual magnetism along with the guilt for his sin...

The film opens in 1666 when Hester Prynne (Demi Moore) arrived in the Massachusetts Bay Colony filled with hope that here, at last, in this new World, would come the freedom to worship without fear or persecution... She didn't suspect that beyond the trees there is a savage land of savage passions dark and untamed, and that soon she will face a scornful community in which she will forever be shamed by the scarlet letter...

Mistress Prynne rejected the idea of staying in the congregation until her husband's arrival and looked for a house of her own... She finds a beautiful and frightening place, just as 'Eden must have been so untouched...'

On one Sabbath morning, Hester met Reverend Dimmesdale (Gary Oldman) who helps her when her cart got stuck in the woods... She truly enjoyed, few minutes later, his sermon ... It was rare, for her, to find a man so young and fiery who could speak with such force of passion... She was moved by his passion...

Dimmesdale thought that comprehending God was going to be his greatest challenge, but--after he met Hester--he was not the man he seems to be... He lost his power before this seductress beautiful woman... He lived in this township his whole life and his purpose was clear... But now he would risk everything--his life, his ministry, his soul--just to spend a few moments alone with her... After he asked her why that morning in the forest, she didn't say that she is married, he wondered how she were able to see so deeply into his nature...

From that moment, two hearts were there struggling against a love that grew stronger with each passing day...

Hester was courteous enough but her tongue knew no rules... She earned more than a few reprimands in her life for speaking too bluntly... With a frightening strength, she challenged her persecutors and stood up to their hypocrisy, refusing to reveal her lover's identity...

""The Scarlet Letter"" compels us to recognize the shadow side of our lives, including this passion that pushes us beyond our limits... The climax also compels us to contemplate about whether there is anything that we would be willing to die for...",1234224000,,2697,4.762312633832977

Underestimating the intelligence of movie audiences and overestimating Demi Moore's odd, narcisstic comment, this movie fails to entertain, with literary and historical accuracy, and turns into a shrill preformance by Demi.

Based on the novel by Nathaniel Hawthorne, The Scarlet Letter is the tale of Hester Pryne, a young woman who has come to the new world to join her Puritain bretheran in their establishment in the New World.  Here, Hester settles in, sent ahead by her husband to set up a home.  Hester meets the Dimsdale, the town minister.  Fighting the obvious attraction they feel for one another, they bond over their love of books and the written word.  They will inevitably have an affair, Hester becomes pregnant, and is forced to live in shame and humiliation with a red letter A pinned to her chest.  She refuses to reveil her child's father's identity, and the good reverand lives in secret shame over their affair.

I gave this movie a shot thinking that as the book (yes, I read the book, Ms. Moore!) begins with Hester being in prison having just had her child.  I was looking forward to seeing how the relationship began, but it was trite.  Their love for one another is obvious, I'm surprised no one suspected things.  The story falls apart from there, as we get into an odd subplot with the tensions between the native Algonquin Indians (which was not in the book).  Hester's husband comes to America, as promised, and is captured by the natives.  Thinking him dead allows Hester to indulge in the affair with the minister which she didn't seem to have much concern for in the book.  There is no concern on the part of the good reverand for relations between his community and that of the natives, and, certainly none on the part of Hester's husband in condeming his unfaithful wife and her child.  I won't go from there about how the rest of the story deviates from the book and goes into a poor movie, because that's what it was, poor.

If they had devised this plot as an independent movie rather than saying it was based on the book, maybe it would have done a bit better.  But because they attached Hawthorne's name to it, it was a huge disappointment.",1186272000,,2316,4.676543209876543

724859,3,6303855555,"The first thing you have to do to get anything out of this movie at all is to forget the book. Completely. The movie so 'freely adapts' the book, that really all that remains of the book's plot is a ghost of a germ of an idea about a Puritan woman who gets pregnant by someone who is not her husband. That's about where the similarity ends. Secondly, you must be willing to approach this movie with something of a split perspective: on the one hand, it is a perfectly enjoyable story of romance; on the other, it has some really funny moments that were not intended to be funny at all. Like the love scene. It's both hot and hilarious at the same time. All that falling (catch the symbolism!) grain everywhere...goodness! Hope it didn't get anywhere...sensitive. Another hilarious scene is when Robert Duvall holds up baby Pearl screaming ""THE DEVIL'S OWN CHILD!""  And that dance he did with the deer carcass...kinda bloody but still funny as hell. Finally, realize that this movie is unabashedly a Demi-fest, as in see Demi look Defiant, see Demi look Witchy, see Demi look Sexy.... you get the idea. And sometimes you'll wonder if Gary Oldman wasn't having to hold back a chuckle or two himself.

If you can keep all that in mind, and admittedly, that's a lot of leeway to give this movie, but if you can do it, go ahead, and enjoy this movie on its own terms. Someone else here said it: it's escapism, pure and simple. It is NOT the book, but I don't think it ever intended to be.

Dimmesdale  and  Hester did  commit fornication- as it cannot really be called adultery as they believed Hester's husband to be dead- that does not make what the townspeople in their so-called ""New Jerusalem"" did to ""punish"" Hester right or even morally acceptable in the sight of God.  I found the majority of the locals to be judgemental, overly strict and downright vindictive and jealous from the very moment Hester came to shore early in the film.
Not to mention that her husband-who  it turns out was taken by Indians and who shows up later in town-  is no man of God either, and is so filled with revenge for Hester's infedility  with the Reverend (spied upon by a peeping tom in the form of Hester's maidservant) that he becomes blinded by hate and places the uneasy but workeable truce between the towns folk and savages  in serious jeopardy.
THE SCARLET LETTER is a moving and all too human tale of people judging one another and being filled with so much hypocrisy that they will do anything to appease what they wrongfully assume to be the will of God-even if it hurts their fellow man. Indeed the only redeemeable part of the town was the old maid who takes pity on Hester-even after the trial and perseuction commences-and aids her in childbirth, while the disheartened Dimmesdale must keep his vow of silence over being the father of Hester's child even though it makes him sick inside-and all the while a vengeful, evil man lurks in the shadows to avenge himself on them all!

Gary Oldman-of Harry Potter fame as Sirius Black as well as being known for his portrayals of Ludwig Van Beethoven and a young Commissioner Gordon from Batman- and Demi Moore (known for her work in such hit films as Ghost, G.I.Jane, Striptease and more)  star in this fascinating journey into the heart of man and a woman who fate has conspired to bring them together- only to tear them apart.

724997,5,6303855555,"The theme of ""The Scarlet Letter"" is timeless. We are reminded of the beauty of Nathaniel Hawthorne's vision throughout the 1995 film version, even if it is not an exact adaptation of the text. The film would be more accurately described as a re-imagined form of the novel, committed to screen with just as much passion and originality. The film, like the novel, is a vision all its own, and those faithful to Hawthorne's original work will likely be unhappy with the film for that reason.

However, the most faithful film adaptations of novels are rarely the most entertaining--for then, what would be the point of a film version if nothing new and insightful or creative could be added?  A film version of a novel offers very little room for creativity and expression on the part of the writers, because everything is taken from something previously written, so often writers are inclined to leave their own mark on a masterpiece--in this case, ""The Scarlet Letter.""

What results is a film with the same underlying theme, but with an entirely different execution. ""The Scarlet Letter"" is an inventive and arresting enough film that it should be judged with some separation from the novel. The film possesses certain qualities that make it nearly a masterpiece, such as John Barry's score, rich with deliriously lush strings and recurring melodies. The cinematography is another asset--grand with vivid colors and picturesque, romantic scenery. Puritan settings are recreated with eye-catching splendor.

It is the romantic nature of the film, as well as the timeless message, that will hold the viewer. A strength of the film is that, although the central love story is heightened, we never lose sense of the story's meaning: ""Who is to say what is a sin in god's eyes?"" (the last line of the film). This is still a controversial view, and perhaps the book did not make that outright claim (for the novel is open for interpretation). The film, however, does make that interpretation, and it is a powerful one that may explain some of the controversy surrounding the film. In this day, with such political topics as gay marriage on the table, this subject is more relevant than ever (and very controversial).

Demi Moore is the star of ""The Scarlet Letter,"" and Hester Prynne was unquestionably the most daring role of her career. I feel many have been unfair with their appraisals of her performance. Moore is a very good, but perhaps not great actress. She was wise to approach Hester Prynne with restraint, but her performance is not without nuance. It is a sensitive, unforgettable performance and Moore's finest achievement.

The film does have its flaws, undoubtedly. The character of Matuba is under-developed. Some of the sex scenes are over-the-top, such as the use of candles as phallic symbols. Robert Duvall is slightly hammy as the insane doctor, held captive and released by Indians. There are some unnecessary scenes and some unnecessary dialogue, which suggests what the film needed most was a good editor (and perhaps that would have made all the difference, as the film runs well over two hours).

The flaws of ""The Scarlet Letter"" can easily be over-looked, if one is open-minded to a new vision of Hawthorne's work and the still-controversial theme (and interpretation the film takes). Religious views sometimes imprison us from being with the people we truly love--in Hester's case, she was unable to be with the man she loved (and the father of her child) because of a sin known as adultery and the punishment (death, banishment, the scarlet letter ""A"" for adultery Hester had to wear on her dress as a symbol of sin) Puritans provided.  But is that really right--to punish for god?  That is what the novel and film ask us, only the film leads us to an answer (and a happy ending).

The film is controversial because it answers the question.  If you love someone, the film tells us, it is okay to be with them even if in religious opinion it is considered a sin. It was a bold statement, and in my opinion a true and beautiful one.

Let us remember what Oscar Wilde once said about works of art (which this film surely is) that spark debate: ""Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex, and vital.""  If one applies that to the novel, written over a hundred years ago, then we know that the theme is still timeless. And if applied to the film--we know it was completely new. Something to be said for a film that takes a 150 year-old theme and makes it new again.",1118793600,5,4519,4.778205128205128
724998,4,6303855555,"Freely adapted from Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel, it retains some elements but mostly reorients the story completely. The love story is kept, except that it was secret in most of the book and is made public for us the audience from the very start. The vengeance part of the story is emphasized by the Indian war that this vengeful ex-husband starts out of pure perversity since he has nothing to win out of it, far from it, since it will mean his own end in his own guilt like a revenge turned sour. The witch part is definitely emphasized too, even too much, but does not reach the level of the Crucible, even if it is in a way the same pattern that is followed. Here the film does not miss but rather avoids the fundamental point of the Crucible : witch-hunting was a political activity covering the greed of some landowners for the land of their neighbors. And we completely miss the nature part of the original story. All these drawbacks and shortcomings are compensated with a lot of love, passion, frustration and desire. The two main actors are brilliant in expressing the most extreme passion repressed and hidden away with pure willpower and maybe some condescending rejection for this society that was born in the dream of the freedom of a New Jerusalem and ended up in the drama and tragedy of the darkest and cruellest human passion, hatred based on jealousy. The film is probably a brilliant success at showing how righteousness can easily become criminal sectarianism, if not even worse if there is anything worse like fundamentalism. But in the end I missed nature's light that I remember is flashing and shining in this story. The end is nothing but a flight and not an escape. One can escape such a situation only by transforming it not running away like some fearful doggy.

725128,1,6303855555,"We are watching this movie in English class, and I believe our teacher remarked, ""Hawthorne is turning in his grave."" Too true. Unfortunately, Puritan society has been remade into a place that is only scandalized when it suits them to be. The rest of the time we simply have lots of random nudity, violence, and sex.

Demi Moore, playing Hester Prynne, is a rebel from the beginning. She angrily stands up to her elders and betters, and does many things that ""are just not done!"" She follows an unrealistically colored red bird into the forest, where she sees Dimmesdale skinny-dipping. She is enamored by this, and suddenly she looks like a wild woods-queen (her hair is down, she wears a garland of flowers in her hair, etc.) She returns only to find out it is the Sabbath, removes the wreath, and sets off to Church.

Apparently, Puritans have no problem with their minister being late to his own sermon, for Dimmesdale has time to stop in the woods and help this unescorted maiden with her cart (deeply stuck in mud). Then he boyishly suggests they change horses, he'll ride hers and she'll ride his (oh, how romantic!) and they show up at Church. There, and later over some Bible books, they bond.

When Chillingworth is apparently killed in an Indian attack, Dimmesdale decides to come to Hester's house in the middle of the night to break the tragic news (even though he finds out early in the day.) She is instantly horrified, and grabs Dimmesdale and pulls a curtain, where she talks in hushed whispers as her chest throbs. Then she pulls him and they end up in the shed, where they make love in the slowest sex scene imaginable. In the meantime, Mituba, some random servant Hester has, decides that what her mistress is doing is sexually stimulating, and we have flashes of her undressing in front of the unrealistically colored red bird. Hmmm....

Chillingworth, in the meantime, is not dead, but made to run the gauntlet as all the Indians beat him with sticks. Then we have images of him dancing around with a slaughtered wild animal (or animal skin) on his head. Hmmm, again...apparently, for Chillingworth to feel revengeful he needs to be insane and have no dignity at all...otherwise how COULD he feel such a basic human emotion as jealousy...

Some scenes of Dimmesdale mortifying his flesh...blood running down poles...Hester giving birth...etc...

Apparently, this continues into a stirring political speech for women's freedom in the end, and Dimmesdale and Hester are together to lead the rest of their highly implausible, improbable love lives together, in their staunch and pathetic happiness. By the end, I doubt many of us care about them at all--but never fear, for it's the unrealistically colored red bird that matters, you know...for it embodies Satan, or so it seems! After all, it's Scarlet,too...they kept to the book, well, kind of...*drips some more sarcasm*

725130,1,6303855555,"Fans of Joffe's ""The Scarlet Letter"" plead with people to disregard the book and take the movie on its own merits.  This is absurd reasoning, as a remake of any sort invites comparisons by its very nature.  It is particularly pointless in this case, because even if there had been no novel to compare it with, ""The Scarlet Letter"" would still have been an embarassing flop.

Although obstensibly set in a 17th century Puritan community, the movie makes no attempt whatsoever to establish time and place through characterization or action.  Demi Moore's character is a free thinking, independant woman who befriends her pagan neighbors (who act like stereotypical hippies) and politely ignores the scorn of the town elders.  In other words, she's a cool 90's chick.  Gary Oldman is a strong yet sensitive type with a goatee, respectful to women and the local native tribes.  He's a cool 90's dude.  Granted there have been independant thinkers in every age, but this degree of anachronism makes about as much sense as a caveman invenitng a computer out of rocks and hides.

Since Demi and Gary are both free-thinkers in a repressive (i.e. uncool) society, you just know they're going to get together as soon as Demi's husband dies.  When she ends up pregnant though, and her husband turns out to be alive, she just accepts the situation and moves on with self-assured smugness.  Of course, her uncool neighbors can't accept this situation, but no matter how much they condemn her, it only makes Demi's resolve stronger.  For his part, Gary longs to reveal himself as the father (sensitive guy that he is) but Demi insists that he remain quiet so she can nobly go endure the community's ire alone.  Of course, you just know they'll end up together in the end.

Perhaps the worst thing about ""The Scarlet Letter"" is the numerous missed opportunities to inject emotionally mature drama.  Demi's character is a born and raised Puritan, shouldn't she feel some guilt and shame over her situation?  Why is Gary, a man from a patriarchal society, submissively letting Demi tell him what to do?  Does the Puritan community have any sense of structure and purpose besides condeming people?  Unfortunately, none of these angles are explored.  Instead we are supposed to focus solely on the juvenile, ""this couple is too cool for their environment"" plotline.

Yes there is a steamy sex-scene, but so what?  Perhaps if they had steered the movie more in this direction, they could have made it a stimulating (but still silly) bit of erotica.  Unfortunately ""The Scarlet Letter"" was intended to be drama, and with its sophmoric story and absurd characters, that is a pretense it simply can't live up to.",1111104000,54,2689,4.88962472406181

While I have seen other criticisms that it did not adhere closely to the novel, I found that to be a plus because you could read so many things into this movie such as understanding how the conflict between the settlers and natives may have been largely a communication issue.

The story is about Hester Prynne (Demi Moore), a young wife who travels to the new world to prepare for her husband's arrival. She ends up in a conservative community, who are rather shocked with her modern ways of dealing with certain things.
When Hester's husband travels to the new world, he is believed to be murdered by the Indians. She falls in love with the Reverend Dimmsdale (Oldman), whose feelings match hers. Out of their love, a child is conceived. However, since her husband hasn't been proven dead, the child is seen by the community as being born out of wedlock.
The conservative and very religious communion demands Hester to name the father of the child, which she denies. She's locked up in prison and has her baby there, while Dimmsdale is torn over whether to step forward as the baby's father.
Hester then is freed but ordered to walk around town wearing a Scarlet Letter 'A', which is meant to belittle her whereever she goes.
Shortly after the child is born, her husband (Robert Duvall) suddenly reappears, and tries to incite the indians (whom he befriended) to act against the community. Single-handedly, he manages to offset the fragile peace that was between the two peoples.
Moore doesn't do too bad of a job as Hester, Duvall is good as the husband, but Oldman still manages to steal the show. All in all, even though I don't enjoy romances, the movie managed to keep me amused.",1079827200,7,1602,4.644366197183099

I was deeply engrossed from the first scene, and could not tear myself away. Demi herself is amazing, but the screenplay and the scenery, the production and the details pulled me right into the story and would not let me go until the very last scene -- and I absolutely loved the ending!

One should be able to tell this movie will be unimpressive by the mere fact that the first half of the movie was a complete fabrication by the writers and the second half was a ravaged form of what was once an awe-inspiring story.

A woman who is in the new colonies, by the name of Hestor Prynne, falls in love with the local pastor, who shares the same feelings for her. When her husband comes back-whom she believed to be killed-chaos results when he discovers that she had sex with the pastor and having a baby.
The movie is barely based on the book, the script is anemic, and the acting is one-dimensional-need I say more? But the movie has beautiful cinematography, beautiful actors and the score is superb. That's the movie's saving grace. If the movie had steered more towards the passion of Hestor and the pastor, and not to the baby and Hestor's long-to-be-believed-to-be-dead husband, it would have been a touching, moving romance.

725364,5,6303855555,"To begin with, I have never thought Demi Moore anything but a pretty face & a great bod. I have always liked Gary Oldman, but never thought of him as a sexy leading man.  When this movie came out, I avoided it, because I always considered it a waste of time to see Demi Moore movies.  Recently, I caught this movie on cable around 3 in the morning, and I was totally blown away, by the chemistry of Moore & Oldman.  It was so erotic!  Sometimes a movie like this is wonderful because of all the guilty pleasures it offers.
Does everything have to be true to the mark all the time?  I have always enjoyed Hawthorne's books, and when I read the Scarlet Letter in High School, I hated it, but then what can you expect from a 16 year old?  A couple of years ago I reread the book and it's really great, however, that did not diminish one bit the enjoyment I derive from watching this ""freely adapted"" version.
I guess one could say, that there were lots & lots of inconsistencies regarding authencicity, like Hester's ""Conciousness raising group"" and the fact that she would go into town & buy soap instead making her own.  Also, no Seventeenth Century woman in her right mind would think Arthur Dimmsdale was a ""catch"", in fact, I can't think of any Twenteith Century woman that would.  But who cares?  Reverend Dimmsdale was very sexy & so cute!!!  If I was Hester, I would have been dragging him into the barn way before she did.  The only criticism I have is that it would have added to the story to draw out the development of Hester & Arthur's relationship longer to give the story more romantic tension.  Also, I would have liked to see more love scenes.
In closing let me say that The Scarlet Letter is like a really fattening snack that has no nutritional value.  You know it's really no good, but you eat it anyway because it's delicious.",1005004800,3,1844,4.3882352941176475
725365,1,6303855555,"It's an amazing country where an actress can build a multi-million dollar career without having made a single decent movie. Since I just saw The Scarlet Letter on video (AGAIN-- I also saw it in a theatre; I'm a masochist, and I forgot to take my purple pill that day). I'm speaking of Demi Moore.
This is at least the fifth version of Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel, so I suppose the producers' biggest problem was differentiating their version from the earlier ones. ""Oh, I know!"" exclaimed some bright young executive. ""Let's show Pearl's conception!"" We'll do the sexy version. Now you have to understand, even by Victorian standards Hawthorne is long winded, so I think that if Hawthorne had wanted us to know what happened before Hester went to prison, he would have told us. And told us, and told us. But since Ms. Moore only makes films where she gets to roll back her head and writhe, alterations were necessary.
And let's get one thing straight: Hester Prynne was no proto-feminist, no Sylvia Pankhurst purposefully having an illegitimate child as an up-the-establishment of marriage. Hester made exactly one mistake in her whole life. In every other respect she was the model Puritan goodwife. That was Hawthorne's whole point, that we should judge people on their good works, not on the worst things they've ever done. But you'd never guess that from this film, which I can't even recommend to insomniacs, because just when you're getting comfortable, somebody lets out one of those soulful screams that, in this film, substitutes for character development.
Aside from lousy acting, though, this is more than just a departure from the book; this is a fatally flawed film. From the moment Hester arrives in the colony, she is scandalizing people left and right. She lives alone, and then buys herself a BATHTUB (gasp! nekked before the LORD) a HAT double gasp!!) no bonnets for this independent woman. You can actually see her HAIR (triple gasp!!!) and the hat is adorned with a very long, white feather, which if it's historically correct, someone in costuming is having a good laugh, because it must be a turkey feather. The Hester of this film is a tar barrel away from being run out of town before she ever turns up pregnant. There were other colonial towns, some more tolerant than the one where she lived, and there were Native tribes willing to take in Europeans. Hester had plenty of places to go, rather than stay around and take abuse.
The Hester of the book stays around because she believes in the ideals and the religion of the colony, doesn't believe there's a better place to go, believes she has sinned, believes she deserves what she has gotten, and wants to stay there and raise her child there, because a child already tainted with illegitimacy needs all the help she can get. Moore's Hester, pregnant, and knowing she could be arrested, would probably have packed up her bathtub, pulled on her hat at a rakish angle, and been gone by sunup.
The screenwriters, or the producers, or both seem not to know this. It's hard to say they are simply ignorant; my suspicion is that they think the public is. I am delighted that this picture flopped, because Hollywood may have gotten a message about what it can get away with.
For lack of anything better to do while I sat through this mess, I tried to recall all of Demi Moore's movies.
First, was Ghost, which might as well have been called All Good-looking White People Go to Heaven. In Scarlet Letter, she writhes
in hay; Ghost, she writhes in clay. Indecent Proposal? that's the one where she does her writhing in a pile of money. In Disclosure, she writhes on a mahogany desk. I didn't see A Few Good Men, but I saw the posters of her in her dress blues. Does she writhe in them? THAT might be worth $6.50.

I never read the Hawthorne novel, but plan to soon, and am certain that reading it will not somehow diminish my thorough enjoyment of this film.
Demi and Gary Oldman radiate a palpable HEAT between them from their first scene together. All the actors involved do an excellent job, including Robert Duval and Joan Ploughwright.

725443,3,6303855555,"There's a disclaimer which flashes on the screen at the beginning of this 1995 film.  It says it is ""freely adapted from the novel"" by Nathaniel Hawthorne.  Then it goes on to tell the famous story through the eyes of twentieth century feminism, sexual freedom and politically correct happy endings.  I must admit I never did read the book, but I've long been aware of the general plot, set in 1666,  of an adulteress forced to wear the scarlet letter ""A"".
Demi Moore is cast as Hester Pryne, the adulteress, and we all know what's going to happen to her.  She's been sent to America to establish a home; her husband is supposed to be following soon.  She shocks the good people of the Massachusetts Bay Colony when she insists on living alone, with the help of a couple of bondsmen and a female black slave.  I doubt if Hawthorne's book then had the local minister, played by Gary Oldman, do a little nude swimming on Hester's property.  I also doubt that Hawthorne had her peeking, getting excited and sensuously soaking in a bathtub, displaying her own nude body and thinking about the pastor. The couple declare their love for each other but it is only after they think her husband dead that they consummate their relationship.  Her pregnancy is a crime and she spends the last six months of her confinement in a horrible prison.  Then she is forced to wear the scarlet letter and is shunned by all.  She refuses to name her lover, and so Oldman sulks around town, looking guilty but keeping his mouth shut.  This is a great role for any actress, but Demi Moore just can't handle it. She might have a nice body but the expression on her face seems to be frozen, incapable of the subtleties, passion and despair that the role calls for.  Gary Oldman is slightly better, but his portrayal of the weakling pastor is also one-dimensional.
The film is saved, however, by the role of Robert Duvall, who appears late, but yet steals the show with his impassioned portrayal of the wronged husband bent on revenge.  He dominates every scene he's in and a single expression on his face tells more about his character than the combined performances of the rest of the entire cast.  The story is a good one, and it moved fast enough to hold my interest, especially since there were some action scenes added that Hawthorne had probably never intended.  That's why I can't recommend it unless you're willing to just relax and watch a well-plotted historical romance with mediocre acting.",981936000,43,2477,4.646788990825688
725444,2,6303855555,"As a public service to high school students who has been assigned to read The Scarlet Letter and decided to watch this movie to cheat, I have one word of advice: don't. (Unless you are certain that your teacher majored in secondary education instead of a real subject. In that case, go ahead. She or he won't know the difference.)  This film has only the most tenuous connection with the Hawthorne novel. The novel was a study in contrasts between the hypocrisy of the Puritan clergy, people as superstitious, arrogant, and self-righteous as Hollywood types with causes, and the nobility and courage of a ""fallen woman"" willing to undergo public humiliation to protect someone she loves. This is, instead, a romance novel, a bad romance novel, on film. As far as I can tell, the new-and-improved plot exists mostly to give Demi Moore a excuse to get rolled in the hay. Her ability to fake (I assume) an orgasm is impressive, and she cries on command very well. Other than that her performance was embarrassing to watch. She really ought not to attempt period pieces. They often require acting. The only reason I didn't hit the eject button about a third of the way through was the fine supporting cast whose performances only heighten the contrast with Ms Moore. There are actors and actresses, and there are movie stars; Ms Moore is the latter. (Why is it that so many British actresses can do flawless American accents and most Hollywood stars do British accents so badly it is like listening to fingernails on a blackboard?)

725445,3,6303855555,"Before I begin writing this review, it must be made clear that this critique is based not on the movie's relevance to the classic novel, but on it's own story. To attempt to compare the novel and the film is quite absurd; within the first three minutes, it is clear that the script takes an entirely different approach. But, if you can suspend disbelief and the plot of the novel, and view the movie with a clear and open mind, then Roland Joffe's rendition of the Hawthorne work is a credible film. Big-name actors play the characters, and cinematography, set design and music are all able to carry the movie on their shoulders.
Demi Moore is Hester Prynne, who is condemned to bear the weight of the letter ""A"" on her bosom for adulterous acts, and later refusing to disclose the name of her fellow sinner. Gary Oldman portrays the hypocritical Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, who must keep his crimes a secret in order to watch over Hester's well-being. Robert Duvall plays the sinister Roger Prynne, whose presence creates an overbearing wave of tension for Hester and Arthur.
The movie begins with an Indian burial of the high chief, whose death is laid at the hands of the Puritan newcomers; Dimmesdale is the only one they trust. Soon, a new wave of immigrants arrives at the colony, among them being a beautiful young woman named Hester. No sooner does she arrive that she starts creating scandals around the towm: locating a house for herself on her own and purchasing a bathing tub that soon has everyone talking (remember, these are Puritans we're talking about). One day, while tending to her garden, she spies a small red robin which leads her deep into the woods to a river, where she watches a handsome man bathing. On her way to church that day, her cart gets stuck in the woods, and she is offered help from that same man, who turns out to the Reverend Dimmesdale.
This starts a game of stolen glances and lustful thoughts, until Hester's husband is soon believed to be dead in an Indian attack. The two lovers make love that same night, bringing about Hester's pregnancy and incarceration for adultery. She refuses to disclose his name; he wants her to in order to suffer with her. Upon the birth of her baby girl, Pearl, she is branded with the scarlet letter and becomes the target of public shame. And when her presumed dead husband comes to town under a new identity, things can only get worse as he begins his search for the man who he believes ruined his marriage.
And there you have it: a story with the skeleton of the novel and new muscles to work with. All in all, this is not a terrible story; there are some instances of disbelief, but not enough of them to keep it from failing as a good story. The Indian subplot seems a bit stretched, but that is the case with a lot in the film, so better to stretch everything at once than one thing at a time.
Actors give good performances, even if their accents seem a bit muddled. Moore is a superb Prynne, embodying the true courage that the character possesses. Oldman makes a good Dimmesdale, but his performance could be a bit better in places. Duvall is truly marvelous as Roger, and he succeeds in making us hate the character that brings nothing but mayhem to the lives of the colonists.

Sure they tweaked the end of the book in the movie, but  besides that the rest of the movie was outstanding.  As for the R rating,  sure it has nudity, it also has violence.  Hey although rated R The Last of  the mohicans doesn't have nudity, but does have violence. And another  thing... What's wrong with nudity?  Sure people don't scream bloody murder  when hollywood portrays someone being decimated, but the first showings of  topless people people run in all directions.  Come on people, what gives?",941587200,3,817,4.640845070422535
725589,5,6303855555,"When I rented this movie for the first time I watched it six times in seven days. It captivated my heart instantly. Gary Oldman played the role of  a life time. Once you lay eyes on the ""Reverand"" you won't want to  take them off. Sexy,captivating,misterious,heart stopping and breath taking  this character will strike your attention and you will want to see more and  more of him. Demi Moore also acted like I have never seen her act  before. Some people may say that it is a ""chick flick"" only  because it is romantic.  I disagree. My boyfriend loved it and even shead a  tear or too. There is not much else I can say. ""This is the best  Romantic/Drama movie I have ever seen."" Watch it today! You won't be  sorry!",940896000,6,717,4.363636363636363
725590,5,6303855555,"Sorry folks, but I am one of those weird people who go to see a movie for the only purpose of being entertained.  Drama, Tragety, Comedy...it makes no difference.  Did I enjoy the film.  The answes is YES!  Was I  entertained? YES!  Did I feel for the characters?  YES!
I never read  ""Hawthorns book"" and never care if I do. What ""I"" saw  was a man thrown into a complete questioning of everything he believed to  be true.  Until Hester, everything had made sence in his world.  Now this  ""love"" for a married woman was a direct contrast to all He  believed in.  To all he WAS.  And yet,  he loved and (believed in) her too.  The line "" I am in hell"" summed it all up.  He knew not how to  place one belief over another. So he walks a road, that he sees has no sane  end.  One reviewer on this page called him a ninny.  I was glad (for once)  to see a non-Rambo, sensitive performance...especailly by Oldman  (Air  FOrce One) who can do the macho thing quite well.  I particularly liked the  scene with the books and the ink...how REAL.  In his nervouseness of seeing  her,  he drops books gets ink on himself, and feels a bit stupid about it  all.  Is this a ninny?  I think it is  a real reaction, of a shy minister,  not knowing what to feel or do.
Demi Moore??? at times she was good but  at times both character and accent slipped.  I think she could have skipped  the accent. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio come to mind for me in this  role.
Again...non movie snob I am...I measure a film if it touches me.  This one did, particularly Oldmans character.
And the heck with  Hawthorne...to have these people die for the ""crime"" of love  would have been very real for this time peroid, but frankly would have  ""wrecked my day"".  Remember I seek only entertainment for my few  bucks....I get ""reality"" for free every day.
Lets see someone  make a movie on the flat tire I had on the freeway last week ...or the  wonderful conversation with the TOW guy :) Very real, very boring!
In  great writing, tragety seem a mainstay. but in OUR real world we see so  much injustice, so much pain.  What is ""wrong"" with a happy  ending?
As for the reviewer who said he thought it was funny.....great,  you can view it as a comedy.  Once you may your two bits...its your  choice:)",935020800,13,2266,4.304556354916067
725591,4,6303855555,"I read all of the reviews for this film and even amazon trashed it!  Here is my question.  If you read the book, and you know that whenever they turn a book into a movie it's going to be an obvious abomination, what the hell  are you expecting. Cast all preconceived notions aside and just enjoy the  flick! The Scarlet Letter was a wonderfully acted and directed spectacle  for the eyes.  I am not really what you would consider a ""Demi Moore  fan"" but I think she did a remarkable job here.  The scene where  Matumba is bathing is enriched with metaphorical images that strikes a  chord in the imagination department, all the while as the movie's integral  scene is taking place between Demi and Gary Oldham, is this not cinematic  splendour?  Yes I will admit, I never read the book, maybe that is why I  enjoyed Scarlet. Overall, this is a descent movie.  It takes you back in  time and lets you relive the puritan hell days on earth, all over again.  A  great Thanksgiving movie, wouldn't you say?
We still love you Demi!",932774400,4,1026,4.454054054054054

The fire and steam ...without so much silliness that Hollywood thinks we need ... you know have to see much to know or imagine what is happening. Such a great book and this movie is a great take on it! well done. I had this on VHS and had to add it to my updated collection. I love Gary Oldman. so many other great actors in it. I love Robert Duvall ... normally but his character in this one will turn your skin out. he will make you silly. he is just a men not kind man in the movie. if you what a nicer Robert movie ... see Days of Thunder, Gone In Sixty Seconds (if you are a Nicholas Cage and Angelina Jolie fan 2?), or Something To Talk About (Dennis Quaid or Julia Roberts)",1515024000,,817,3.8402366863905324
