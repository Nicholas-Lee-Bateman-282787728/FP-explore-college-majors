8708588,5,B00UW43R4U,"I started watching this program on SBS TV in Australia and was very disappointed when it did not appear. I also have "" The Young Inspector Montalbano' and enjoyed that also. I hope they continue that series too.
I love all the Characters in this series and the story line. There is a comical edge to this series which is very entertaining.
Should you buy this wonderful Series i am sure you will enjoy it as much as i do.
The Inspector is a very convincing, talented and intelligent problem solver when it comes to solving crime.
His peculiar relationship with his Amore is also quirky. Why marry, this is the perfect romance. They live apart and each time they see each other it is like a Honeymoon. Marriage can often times get in the way of a happy Relationship. This certainly suits a very busy Police Inspector who is always busy fighting crime.
He lives in a wonderful home close to the Beach side. I believe his life style is rather perfect and i am also stunned at how old & beautiful Sicily really is. I have been to Rome, Milan, Lake Como, Mantova, San Benedetto Po and Modena to visit my Mother's remaining Siblings in 2007. Most of my time was in LOMBARDY. My Mother's Siblings and my Cousins still speak their LOMBARD dialect which was fascinating for me.
I learned that Italy united some 170 years ago and the modern Italian language is actually Toscano. The capital City being Florence which would be a wonderful cultural centre.
Yes you could visit other Provinces but LOMBARDY speaks to me. I just loved my time there.
Lake Como was just beautiful and i would love to see it again.
This caused me to want to learn more about Italy and started with the greatest, The Romans some over 2000 years ago.
I was fortunate to stay in wonderful & renovated Accommodation.
I also make notes to learn Italian better than i now do. So it is handy to watch and listen.",1456876800,,1872,4.476608187134503
