8605613,5,B00EI6PQH4,"My girls love Mike the Knight. This short DVD contains only two episodes from the Nick Jr. cartoon and a few bonus features. Amazon doesn't always do a good job on their DVD episode listings so here are the episodes that are included on this DVD:

1. The Mighty Shield - Mike wants a bigger shield, but it isn't as easy to use as he thinks it will be.
2. The Many Knights - Magic creates multiple Mikes that don't seem to want to listen.

Bonus features:
1. Huzzah for Glendragon Music Video
2. Meet Mike and His Friends
3. Mike the Knight Theme Song",1383523200,14,550,4.228571428571429
