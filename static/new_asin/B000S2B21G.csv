Cant wait for the 6 season!!!! I wish it did not take so long for us Americans to get it over here!",1192924800,3,263,4.076923076923077

2879048,5,B000S2B21G,The Inspector Lynley Series are one of the best mystery shows to come over from the UK.  The acting is top notch and the stories are way above average. Each season as been better than the last.,1192579200,4,193,4.216216216216216
2879049,4,B000S2B21G,"This fifth series of the Inspector Lynley Mysteries (PBS calls it Series 6) continues with stories written for television, not based on Elizabeth George's novels. This series conclusion allows the television series to align with the books somewhat, so that future episodes could once again be based on books, if Elizabeth George and the show's producers were so inclined. The first episode picks up after last year's cliffhanger, with Detective Inspector Lynley (Nathaniel Parker) on suspension and separated from his wife Helen. Helen is a presence this season, however, and is now played by Catherine Russell. I don' t know why Helen should be difficult, but this bit of casting is worse than the last.

Lynley and Detective Sergeant Havers (Sharon Small) look conspicuously unlike previous seasons. Lynley looks a bit greasy, older, and worn in a new, longer hairstyle that was wisely trimmed after one episode. Sharon Small is sporting long, flowing locks of lovely red hair and a fairly fashionable wardrobe. Sharon Small was always the most attractive woman in the series. Now she isn't hiding it. But this eliminates the contrast that made Lynley and Havers an odd couple. If they're both handsome and content, neither are interesting. Lafferty (Paul Hickey), the forensic pathologist who was introduced last season, is still around. And a new character, DC Winston Nkata (Shaun Parkes), does a lot of spade work. Episodes are each 85 minutes long, on 4 separate discs.

""Natural Causes"" finds DS Havers adapting to yet another new boss and partner as Inspector Lynley awaits the hearing that will hopefully reinstate him to active duty. Blunt, pushy, and pregnant DI Fiona Knight (Liza Tarbuck) and Havers investigate when Edie Covington (Mary Stockley) drowns, her car apparently pushed into a lake, after she and her lover argue in the Kent countryside. Friction develops between Knight and Havers when Knight insists that the culprit must be Edie's estranged partner, while Havers wants to pursue Edie's opposition to a lucrative real estate development as a possible motive. Lynley finds it difficult to sit idly by and insinuates himself into the case, at first doing research, then much deeper.

""One Guilty Deed"" takes the detectives to a working class seaside resort town where Havers vacationed as a child. DI Lynley and DS Havers are frustrated when Roger Pollard (David Hepple), their key witness against London organized crime boss Michael Shand (Tom Gerogeson), is murdered on a beach in Essex. Havers gleefully arranges accommodations in a trailer park that brings back childhood memories while they investigate the murder. Pollard was from the town but left 25 years ago under shady circumstances. Something compelled him to return, placing his life in danger, to see old friends Danny Gill (Stuart Laing), now a successful entrepreneur, and Carly Baker (Esther Hall), who manages the trailer park. This mystery feels particularly contrived and sensational.

""Chinese Walls"" brings us back to London, where Emily Proctor (Isabella Calthorpe) is found stabbed to death in Hyde Park. Emily had worked for prominent civil rights lawyer Tony Wainwright (Samuel West), whom she had enthusiastically admired since her teens, until leaving his employ a few months before under murky circumstances. Since then, she worked for her half-sister Lisa Conroy's (Georgia McKenzie) internet business, where she had picked up an unwelcome admirer. Family secrets, Emily's relationship with Wainwright, and her unseemly admirer provide an abundance of suspects. This mystery offers twists, turns, and improbable circumstances without going over the top, making it the best of this series.

A press photographer called Peter Rooker (Richard Copestake) is found shot to death in a London alleyway in ""In the Blink of an Eye"". He was having an affair with the wife of powerful and controlling newspaper owner Eddie Price (Danny Webb). But the trail of suspects also leads to Peter's dangerous and daring past. Nina Delic (Ania Sowinski), a woman whom he had rescued as a girl from war-torn Bosnia, was found hiding in his apartment. Now she is on the run from unknown enemies, out of Lynley and Havers' reach. This mystery is mercifully less melodramatic than the first 2 of this series, but the list of suspects is too short and the mystery too straightforward to be entirely satisfying.",1192406400,49,4391,5.213881019830028
2879050,5,B000S2B21G,"How very nice it is to have another season of ""Inspector Lynley"".  As I have indicated in my previous reviews to seasons 1-4 of this series, I'm very besotted with this Murder/Mystery series along with its leading characters of Detective Inspector Lynley as played by Nathaniel Parker and with especially Detective Sergeant Havers, as played superbly by Sharon Small.  They are at the ""top of their forms"" in season five (5).  The ""cliff hanger"" of Season four (4) is, of course, resolved with Lynley being reinstated (not a surprise) and he and Havers are reunited to solve more dastardly murders which they do so very well.  Lynley is also reunited shortly with that wife of his who is a little less dreary than in previous episodes mainly because a ""new"" actress is playing the role.

Season five (5) (on four (4) discs running about 86 minutes each with one episode per disc) is really very good with scripts that are very well written and directed.  The stories kept me highly entertained from their beginnings to their ends.  I was always unable to solve the mystery in my mind until ""all was revealed"".

  Be advised that the murder/mysteries in Season 5 are very involved and do require much attention to details; the viewing audience is not ""spoon-fed"" clues, suspects, etc.  In other words, this season offers some really good mysteries!",1191801600,29,1347,4.8384279475982535

Barbara Havers was not how I had envisioned her.  She was suppose to be overweight and not attractive.  Inspector Lynley was not ""lord"" enough and his girlfriend, Helen, was suppose to have been a beauty and this Helen was not that beautiful.  I suppose ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder"" so maybe she was beautiful.

2879071,5,B000S2B21G,"Natural Causes: Lynley is on suspension, but that doesn't stop him from unofficially partnering with Havers - against her boss' wishes - to root out a murderer. Consequently he secretly goes undercover - but with no backup.

One Guilty Deed: A mystery from the past haunts the present as Lynley, back on duty, joins Havers on a holiday (of sorts). A witness is killed at the Essex marshes, so the detectives set out for Havers' childhood holiday site to investigate - and wind up discovering another.

Chinese Walls: This episode begins with us, the viewers, as eye witnesses to a murder as we race along with a young girl trying to escape with her life. A completely surprising murderer is indeed revealed in the end.

In the Blink of an Eye: A photographic journalist is murdered, possibly due to his coverage of the Bosnian War. Investigating the crime brings personal tragedy into Lynley's life.

My personal opinion (and it's just one) is that Lynley and Havers' partnership seems better in this series, more cohesive, with more mutual reliance and respect. The writing, acting, and twisting plots kept us riveted.",1279324800,,1119,4.904761904761905
2879072,1,B000S2B21G,"Much to our dismay, Inspector Linley 5 does not offer close captioning or subtitles unlike earlier series or Inspector Linley 6. We watched it but missed over half the dialogue. For a recent series like this, I do not understand why the close captioning is missing and why they reinstituted it the following season. Very disappointing when one relies this and all of a sudden it isn't there.",1274572800,2,391,4.764705882352941
2879073,5,B000S2B21G,"I finally got around to watching this series again, and I'm glad to say I truly enjoyed it. The camradrie, intelligent and witty dialogue, and suspense continue in this series.
In the first episode, Lynley faces disciplianry repercussions from his actions in the last episode of the previous series. As a result, Havers has been bouncing around working with other DI's. The first episode is the humourous of the four. Havers finds herself working with a pregnant DI that likes officers that takes charge, which like it or not, Havers usually does anyway. It's comical to see the relationship take a turn, when the DI has to be hosptilized and Lynley, whom has already ingratiated his way into the case, is assigned by Knight to work for now Acting DI Havers.
The last three episodes are back in London and have that dark, gritty feel to them. Lynley picks up the relationship with his wife Helen, whom returns in the persona of another actress, one that is not only completely different in appearance, but also in demeanor. I don't usually enjoy when a character is replaced by another, but since the character of Helen hadn't been around for several episodes, it really didn't bother me this time, though I was scratching my head for several minutes wondering who this new woman was, though she was called Helen by Lynley. Perhaps, Lesley Vickarage had other contractual obligations, wanted too much money, or simply didn't wish to return to the role. Either way, the new actress did a fine job, I thought. At least, she seemed to have less of a snooty attitude and seemed to be more in charge of her life than the previous actress had tried to portray.
Sadly, in the last episode of this series, tradegy befalls Lynley again. And when this happens, I can't wonder where on earth his family was when he needed them? Doesn't he have a mother, sister and brother? Where are they? I understand that for such a quick ending, the producers may not want to bring other actors in, but there wasn't even mention made of why he was all alone in the end when such a tradegy occurred.
This series does a good job of moving forward. Havers and Lynley no doubt have beat the odds of not lasting in their working relationship, and their friendship continues to develop through mutual respect and admiration. They have no problems referring to each other as a friend. If you enjoyed the other episodes of this show, or are new to the show, or just a fan of the genre, I highly recommend obtaining this one for your shelf. This show had so much going for it. I can't believe that they won't be bringing it back.",1267920000,4,2596,4.609071274298056
2879074,5,B000S2B21G,"I really enjoyed this series, I have always liked murder mysteries and the actors & plots in this series are superb! The series was made for PBS and has 4 different stories of 90 minutes in length. Overall I would recommend any of the Lynley series except Season 6, and this is only because I haven't had the chance to see it yet!!! Season 6 only has 2 dvds because the show got canceled in mid season. This is a shame considering some of the garbage that is still on the air.
This series is well worth having in your video library!!!!",1249430400,,535,4.254901960784314
2879075,2,B000S2B21G,"I can't help it, I don't like it when they bring in a new actress to play the same character.  Especially having watched the seasons back-to-back, it's hard for my brain to reconcile the fact that this very different woman is the same character.  And to top it off, if there's anything more annoying than a brooding and angry Lynley, it's a happy in love Lynley.  Maybe I'm just a little biased against his characters, being a Havers fan.

In fact, I quite enjoyed the nearly Lynley-less episode where Havers was teamed with another (far more interesting) pregnant DI.  I would have enjoyed seeing just the two of them working together for a few episodes, without Lynley pushing his nose into everything.  His character comes off as pathetic and needy, a sharp (and disappointing) contrast to the books and his earlier role.

Perhaps it's meant as a metaphor for life and role-reversal, and perhaps I'm missing some deeper meaning.  But I'd just as soon these very well-written mysteries be solved by Havers alone.  I'm still watching, and I'll watch next season, but it's in spite of Lynley and not because.  And if Lynley and Havers ever get together, as many people seem to want, I'll wash my hands of the series.  She deserves much better.",1240963200,3,1243,4.734883720930233
2879076,5,B000S2B21G,We enjoyed all of the Lynley series tremendously. I'm only sorry that the series will end soon. If are a fan of the British mystery series this is a must see.,1222732800,,158,4.129032258064516
2879077,4,B000S2B21G,"Although it was nice to have a new chapter in the Inspector Lyley series, I have to say that I was just a little disappointed that this season and the final one were somewhat Americanized - the characters a bit more glamorous, the settings less gritty.  Having said that, I will also admit that series five and six were nonetheless thoroughly enjoyable.  It was good to see Havers beginning to realize that she's a formidable detective in her own right.  Too bad Lynley is too much of a prat to see it!",1221436800,,502,4.434782608695652
2879078,5,B000S2B21G,"Inspector Lynley and his stalwart sidekick Detective Sergeant Havers return for a fifth season of solving intense and complex mysteries.  The original awkward partnership of the aristocratic Lynley and the working class Havers has been transformed by time and shared experience into a nuanced relationship as fascianting as the crimes they investigate.

In ""Natural Causes"", Lynley is on suspension, and Havers has been paired with an unctious and very pregnant female DCI.  Havers and her new partner will investigate the apparent suicide of a young environmental activist.  When the case proves to be a complicated murder, a frustrated Lynley pitches in and goes way out on a limb to help solve the case.  At episode's end, he will face a reinstatement board.

In ""One Guilty Deed"", the two detectives are assigned a murder case in a down-at-heel seaside resort once frequented by Havers as a child.  Lynley and Havers must work out housekeeping arrangements in a crowded trailer while wrestling clues out of uncooperative locals.  The disappearance of a young boy years prior turns out to be the key to the present crime.  Havers' success at finding the connection leaves her dangerously vulnerable to the killer.

In ""Chinese Walls"", Lynley and Havers plunge into the internet porn industry to solve the murder of a young barrister, while Lynley resurrects his relationship with his estranged wife Helen, played in this set by a new actress.

In ""Blink of an Eye"", Lynley and Havers work the murder of a burnt-out war photographer turned papparatzi, whose past may have caught up with him.  The suspects include a magazine publisher, a limo driver, an ex-para, and the photographer's Bosnian ward, all of whom had motive and opportunity.  Lynley pulls in Helen to profile the killer and assist in the questioning, with tragic results at the conclusion of the episode.

""Inspector Lynley Set Five"" offers everything we have come to expect in this series: tough, complex crimes with few clues and messy solutions; location shooting that adds depth to the stories; and crackling good give-and-take between Lynley and Havers as they work the cases.  This set is very highly recommended to fans of the series as excellent entertainment.",1221436800,6,2235,5.118457300275482

With the British accents and the fact that I view it while working out on a treadmill, the lack of closed captioning pretty much made this set worthless to me.  I could not follow the stories without it.

2879082,5,B000S2B21G,"""You want to know how someone died, find out how they lived, how they loved."" -- Natural Causes

This delicately etched and excellently acted series on PBS's ""Mystery"" is my favorite. Nathaniel Parker's Inspector Thomas Lynley and Sharon Small's Barbara Havers are eagerly awaited with passion each season by this viewer like nothing else on television.

Now in its fifth season, the series based on Elizabeth George's characters has grown and matured into something really special. The mysteries are always well-written and the lead characters have been allowed to let life and what each brings to the table change both themselves and each other.

The dashing Lynley was originally paired with Havers because it was taken for granted he would not be distracted by her; a quite offensive presumption. But the two quickly found there was more to each other than their reputations, and proved a great team. They also became quite close, their deep friendship and affection for each other rarely dwelled upon but always there beneath the surface.

One of the great things about the series has been its lack of stagnation, It is only natural that Havers has given the dashing Lynley depth and complexity while he has given her a softer appearance over time. After four seasons Havers has her hair down and looks terrific. And it is perhaps due to his relationship with Barbara that the separated Lynley has come closer to once again being with his wife Helen, winningly portrayed by Catherine Russell.

Season five began with Lynley suspended pending an inquiry into brutality charges. Barbara has been paired with a new D.I., a very pregnant one a bit caustic regarding Lynley who, for his part, does not endear himself to her when he unofficially starts helping and thinks she is overlooking promising leads.

""Natural Causes"" began the season in fine style, and even some fun, as towards the conclusion Havers is the D.I., Lynley doing her bidding. The final episode of season five finds a murder in Soho tied to Bosnia, even Lynley's Helen lending a helping hand. But this bookend to the season will turn tragic, Lynley discovering an entire world can change in ""The Blink of an Eye.""

Deeply intelligent and richly mature mysteries with carefully nuanced performances, the Inspector Lynley series began with a promise it has lived up to. Nathaniel Parker and Sharon Small have been marvelous and memorable in a series fans cherish in the same manner as Lynley does his Bristol. Smart and atmospheric, Debbie Wiseman's opening music setting the tone for each intriguing installment, Inspector Lynley is a series mystery fans can't miss.",1203897600,5,2636,5.018306636155606
2879083,4,B000S2B21G,"Love Lynley, love Havers, and both their specific troubled lives---they are a perfect ""statement"" of how the class system works for everyone---the aristocrat needs their loyal, practical, and grounded-in-reality sidekick. They are a visual statement, and a ""power"" statement as well. Havers has mundane worries and limitations, Lynley has the burden and misery of centuries to carry on his shoulders, has suffered a lot, and we don't begrudge him his rank and income and perfect town-house.
BIGGEST mistake is the mis-casting of Helen, who was a perfect foil to Lynley before---but the new actress in the ""non-role"" now looks awful in every respect---that is, trashy by anyone's definition. Having to suffer through her brief scenes and look at her dishelved appearance nearly ruins the episodes. Lynley is gorgeous, lonely, eligible and should be hounded by a bevy of classy titled Debutantes by now---looking at him with this actress beggars belief.",1199923200,2,951,5.346666666666667

2879087,3,B000S2B21G,"I have to say that I still enjoy this series but that my affection for it is largely due to Ms Small, whose character Inspector Havers has developed amazingly well over time.  She almost singly handedly carries the series in my opinion.  Faced with a variety of real life problems, she seems to have grown with her trials as a real person would.  She`s vulnerable without being sappy, caring without being clingy, and tough as nails when she has to be.  She's a survivor; she has a history and consistancy.  Hers is a very complex character, as those of real people usually are.

My problem with this series is the same as that with the Inspector Jury series.  The gothic romance hero gets more and more annoying because he never seems to learn anything.  He remains as screwed up as he starts out.  While the secondary characters are allowed to grow and mature into normal people with occasional problems, the hero wallows in self criticism and self pity and creates more problems for himself with every decision.  The urge to say ""get help"" is overwhelming.

I find no fault with the actor playing the role of Lynley, but the writers need to carry him beyond the dark, brooding, gothic romance hero he started out.  Either that or send him back.  Instead, their answer to the difficulty of his womens-romance origin is simply to make him look a little seedy and pathetic--to show he`s a ""sensitive kind of guy"" maybe.  They either need to work with the actor's strong points, which are his elegance and aristocratic features and bearing, or create a new character.  The latter probably would not carry the magic of the relationship with Havers.  The solution is almost certainly to let the character grow; it`s not as if he can`t.  He grew a great deal when he needed to face the issue of his mother's attachment to his father's former doctor and to his own failure to ""be there"" for his younger brother.

Lynley is a member of the aristocracy, but where's the gliz and glammer of the roll.  What does it really mean?  What duties are historically his?  What relationship does he have with the royal court if any? My feeling is that his family predates that of the present monarchy by centuries.  What does that mean?  What does being Lord of the Mannor mean to those who live in the region that is his?  Do they like him or are they indifferent?  Does he have any real roll to perform or is he just an anachronism?  Does he have enough money to manage his estate, and what does that mean?  What is the family history?  Why does he seem so apologetic about having a family that has had roots in England--and probably in France as well--since Heck was a Pup?  Where is the glamour that having an aristocrat as a central character should provide the series.  Does Havers get involved in this aspect of his life?  How does she deal with it?  What kind of interesting flash backs to the history of his family could be interjected that might tie to the present generation in interesting ways?  Was there a Havers-like character in the family's past?  What happened to her.  Is there a present collateral branch of the family establish by illicit romantic liasons in the past?  How do they relate to the ""legitimate"" branch of the family.  Are they close, indifferent, hostile?  Doesn't anything goofy or funny ever happen to an aristocrate?  Or do they just brood.

Either the writers have to let go entirely of the gothic romance aspect of the character or they have to make good use of it.  The emotional mess thing really gets old.",1194134400,16,3531,4.594551282051282

Continuing to buy the series, though the writers decided they could improve on Elizabeth George's plots, I enjoyed the characters though the plots suffered.  Without captioning, this will be the last that I purchase.",1194048000,14,472,5.424657534246576

Note that this season includes a completely different actress as Helen, who (IMHO) isn't as talented as the Helen we saw in sets 1-3.  Lynley is also somewhat less convincing in this series - lots of byplay that doesn't really move the story forward, but is needed for background. Worth watching, certainly, but something is missing in this set that is less convincing.",1502668800,,445,4.779220779220779
