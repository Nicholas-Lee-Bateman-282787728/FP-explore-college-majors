8458736,4,B0055SVP0G,"This is an amazing DVD.  You know why?  Because the author takes you step by step through every song featured, just like Andy Aledort would do.  I have bought some guitar DVD's in the past where the author basically just plays the song and barley explains anything.  Not the case here.  Very good DVD.",1329436800,15,301,4.5
