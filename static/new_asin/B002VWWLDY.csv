4001914,5,B002VWWLDY,"It is difficult to review one set of this magnificent series. So I'll apply this to the whole package, which I bought on separate sets. There are other options to purchase this series. The dvd's themselves are of average quality in sound an image. I imagine due to technical limitations when the series was produced. However little effort has been put forth into bringing them up to today standards. The material, scant. If you want more material to enhance your enjoyment, I highly recommend Arthur Bishop's ""The Complete Morse"". An excellent companion to the series. Colin Dexter's stories (albeit toned down a bit, for TV in those days)are excellent. There are some ups and downs in the quality of the screenplays, but overall superb. Some of the best young talent at the time, names that are now very familiar wrote the adaptations. John Thaw is excellent as Morse, so is the rest of the steady cast. The ""guest"" cast is also excellent, at times with great Shakesperian actors. The production around Oxford excellent. Overall still the best series of its kind produced for TV. I just don't see another one dethroning it. Coming close perhaps.",1355443200,2,1146,4.8820512820512825
4001915,4,B002VWWLDY,"I came to the Inspector Morse series by way of Inspector Lewis, and discovered that Kevin Whately (who is amazing as DI Lewis) also used to play DS Lewis in Inspector Morse. He is one of my favorite actors, and of course, John Thaw is one of my all-time favorite actors in investigative dramas. Thaw's Morse is compelling to watch - he loves listening to operatic music, enjoys his quality pint of ale, is easily smitten by a pretty face and intelligence, and is meticulous and astute in his deductive reasoning. All in all, Morse exemplifies the consummate detective, and most of the Morse episodes are of superior quality in terms of writing and acting.

Greeks Bearing Gifts
This is an episode that requires the viewer to pay careful attention as the plot is convoluted with two murders and plenty of suspects. First a Greek chef turns up murdered, and then later his unwed sister, who has a toddler, also turns up dead, seemingly by the same means. As the list of suspects mounts, Morse puts his nose to the grindstone to try and unravel the tangled web of this case.

Promised Land
Hmmm...this was not one of my favorites of the Morse episodes, primarily because I hated the change in setting. I love the Oxford setting and having become rather fond of it, I was none too pleased by the change to Australia. Here, Morse and Lewis pack up (reluctantly on Lewis' part) and head to Australia on a case. Being the opera buff that he is, Morse has purchased tickets to Der Rosenkavalier at the Sydney Opera House. There's scenic footage of the attractions but the plot itself is too convoluted and I found myself a rather disengaged viewer.

Dead on Time
This is another stellar episode in the Inspector Morse series of crime dramas. In Dead on Time, Chief Inspector Morse (John Thaw) and DS Lewis (Kevin Whately) get called in to an apparent suicide. The dead man, Henry Fallon, turns out to be the crippled husband of Susan Fallon (Joanna David) who was the love of Morse's life at one point in time. Just as the detectives wrap up the case and the coroner's inquiry turns in a verdict of suicide, Henry Fallon's physician, Dr. John Marriatt calls them in and voices his suspicion that the death may not be due to suicide at all, given Fallon's physical limitations.

The detectives then turn on to the obvious suspect, Fallon's son-in-law, who had been in debt to Fallon. But is it really as simple as that? Things get complicated by Morse's obvious partiality to Susan, and it becomes evident to Lewis that Morse is letting his feelings for Susan affect his thinking and handling of the case. This episode tugged at my heart particularly because Morse shows his true feelings for a woman here. Susan is still very much the love of Morse's life, and even though he clearly wishes for them to be together, things are not so simple on Susan's part, and her feelings are a bit more ambivalent. It is rather sad to watch Morse get thwarted in love, especially knowing what a good man he is and deserving of happiness. This is a rather bleak episode in the series but makes for an engaging watch nevertheless.",1351123200,7,3107,4.613019891500904
4001916,5,B002VWWLDY,"This is Set Seven of eleven ""Inspector Morse"" Sets. Each Set has three episodes/discs. Don't confuse these eleven ""Sets"" with the previously issued (but still available) ""Collection Sets"". Each of the six ""Collection Sets"" cost more, as each has more episodes/discs than these Sets.

This Set's three episodes of Inspector Morse are among my very favorites. They were first aired in March 1991 and February 1992. The gap occurred because the 1st two episodes were the end of the ITV Series 5 (the English called them ""series"" instead of ""seasons""), while the last episode of this set was the 1st episode in ITV Series 6.
Episodes:
Greeks Bearing Gifts
Promised Land
Dead on Time

GREEKS BEARING GIFTS:
Young Nicos Capparis is expecting a guest in his 2nd floor flat. He speaks Greek with the 1st floor tenants, the elderly Papas', as he lets in his guest, but the Papas' don't really see who's going up the stairs with him. Too bad, because that same someone, wearing black leather gloves, strangles Nicos and slips out unseen.

In the meanwhile, Sergeant Lewis and his wife Valerie are trying to have dinner at the Greek restaurant, The Acropolis. Service is incredibly slow, and Lewis finds out why. Nicos was the chef!

One of the snapshots in the murdered man's living room is of is of Nicos' sister, Maria, and her new baby. Another photo is of an ancient sailing ship. Morse and Lewis follow up on both of those. It turns out that the ship is a best-guess reproduction of a B.C.E. trireme, built as a co-operative venture between England and Greece. And in tracking it down, Morse encounters a ""marriage made in heaven"".  Or is it?

Trivia:  This episode was written by Peter Nichols, based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. Dexter's walk-on is where he's in the college porter's lodge when Morse leaves, after dinner with gossipy Jerome Hogg. This is the only Inspector Morse episode where Lewis's wife has lines:  She has been taking Greek language lessons, and practices by ordering for Lewis and herself at The Acropolis.

I am fond of this episode due to my nerdy interest in ancient history. I remember newspaper and magazine articles about the real-life trireme reproduction, used to carry the Olympic torch-bearer on one leg to Athens for the 2004 Summer Olympics. As is briefly explained in the Morse episode, nobody was really sure how a trireme worked, as it's only mentioned/shown in a few extant writings, carvings, and pottery illustrations, though it was probably the most common, powerful and maneuverable warship of the 500 B.C.E's. I recommend the extensive entry for ""trireme"" in wikipedia; here's its last paragraph, concerning the real-life reproduction:
""The builders of the reconstruction project concluded that it effectively & conclusively proved what had previously been in doubt, i.e.- that Athenian triremes were arranged with the crew positioned in a staggered arrangement on three levels with one person per oar. This architecture would have made optimum use of the available internal dimensions. However since modern humans are on average approximately 6 cm (2 inches) taller than Ancient Greeks (and the same relative dimensions can be presumed for oarsmen and other athletes), the construction of a craft which followed the precise dimensions of the ancient vessel led to cramped rowing conditions and consequent restrictions on the modern crew's ability to propel the vessel with full efficiency, which perhaps explains why the ancient speed records stand unbroken.""

PROMISED LAND:
We start out watching people show up for Pete Matthew's funeral. But why are men with walkie-talkies and cameras hiding behind gravestones? And among them are Chief Inspector Morse and Chief Superintendent Strange! Strange is worried. Pete died in prison of AIDS, after being fingered by Kenny Stone as the get-away driver in a robbery that ended with a policeman killed. New evidence has come up indicating Pete was NOT the driver. Pete was convicted solely on Kenny's evidence, so Morse needs to meet with Kenny for ""clarification"" of his testimony. Kenny and his wife, Anne, have been set up in Hereford, Australia, under the witness protection program, with the new names of Mike and Anne Harding. Morse insists Lewis has to accompany him to Hereford, New South Wales, Australia, because ""I can't carry my bags, can I?""

Something is up in Hereford, though. Anne's mother has been scared into a stroke or heart attack, nobody's seen Kenny/Mike for days, and then their teenage daughter, Karen, is kidnapped. It looks like their cover has been blown.

Tension mounts to an poignant end, with Morse reeling under grief and guilt.

Trivia: This episode was written by Julian Mitchell, based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. This is one of only two ""Inspector Morse"" episodes that has scenes filmed outside of England.

DEAD ON TIME:
A repairman is fixing the phone wiring in a fine house. When he's done, Henry Fallon, confined to a wheelchair, calls his wife Susan, to tell her the phones are working now. Next, we see him dead from a bullet to the head, an apparent suicide at his desk, discovered by his son-in-law, Peter Rhodes. When Morse enters the room, he sees a photo of Henry's wife, Susan, on the desk, and he goes very very still.

It is apparent that Morse and Susan knew each other. And it must have been serious. At first, she is concerned with not giving the totally disconcerted Morse false hope. She tells him, ""When Henry's things get sorted out, I shall be going away from here. I think you should know that."" Just how she does that will break Morse's heart a second time. But before then, she does have dinner with him at his house. And more than dinner?

But here are Morse's questions: Was Henry's death a suicide? Was the death of Peter's wife, who was Henry and Susan's daughter, an accident?

Trivia: This episode was written by Daniel Boyle, based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. Dexter's walk-on is where he's an attendee, with Morse and Susan, at the Schubert reception. In this episode, we really get a look at Morse the man, not Morse the police officer. And with the sad ending, Lewis really has his back.

In ""The Story of Morse"", a 50 minute documentary special, Joanna David, who plays Susan Fallon, talks about Susan's dinner at Morse's house. ""There's a commercial break just at the crucial moment, so that the world watching it will be able to form their own opinion, whether they did or whether they didn't ""do it"", as it were. You asked me what I thought. Well, I think that they DID."" The next morning, at the station, Morse does have an uncharacteristic peaceful happiness about him.
