8675283,2,B00MXYG45G,"Its Keith Urban, so its hard to screw something up, but they managed to make a pretty poor ""documentary."" This video is basically a few really old clips that nobody wants to watch. Video quality is poor at best. What music is on there is someone recording with a hand recorder from decades ago. Poor positioning, ect. The ""Keith Urban: Love pain and the whole crazy world tour"" DVD blows this out of the water. Not to mention it comes with two for less than the price of this.",1487203200,7,476,4.359550561797753
