7886142,4,6305237220,"I recently watched the video and was starting to skate beforehand.  The video gave me lots of helpful tips and techniques to use in playing.  All the stuff to do with skating I wanted to know how to do was explain very  throughly.  I can cut corners faster, pick up speed on corners, skate  backwards(major plus) and a lot more!  I recommend this video to anyone  wanting to skate better, even if they're not playing hockey and just skate  for recreation.  I hope this helps all you out there.  I plan to also buy  all the other videos in the series.",952387200,12,550,4.346534653465347
