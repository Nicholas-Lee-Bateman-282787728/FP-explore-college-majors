4830625,5,B005LVO6QC,"This was a great film, I would recommend this film to anyone that has an interest in design, art or anything to do with either. I appreciate how much work the film makers put into digging through all the archive to make this such an amazing film to watch.",1324339200,8,255,4.224489795918367
4830626,1,B005LVO6QC,"I was excited waiting for this video in my mailbox. Watching it I fell asleep. Although biographical details and a survey of their contributions is important, it was too long and this documentary did not focus on their greatness: their home and the chairs they designed. That Charles Eames personally did not want to be known as a chair designer is not enough reason to divert from the the great contributions of their studio team. Moreover, the individuals that spoke about their personal and professional engagement with the Eames, were very uninteresting and pedestrian. I am sorry I spend my money on this unilluminating video for the initiated and unfocused presentation for the uniniated. It's not a video that would get anyone interested in the Eames's work.",1324339200,7,765,5.031496062992126
4830627,3,B005LVO6QC,"This had so much potential and some of the interviewees were truly great and interesting, however several were not.  One designer ruined this documentary with her obnoxious narrations and very gossipy  rhetoric.  Both Ray and Charles would be mortified to see their personal lives aired in such a fashion.  This was like watching a current talk show more than a documentary on two great designers.",1324080000,9,397,5.061538461538461
4830628,5,B005LVO6QC,"I lived most of my life with art, creative thinking, innovation so other minds on a much more versical level fascinate me, feed me.",1383523200,,131,4.5
4830629,5,B005LVO6QC,"Though this documentary may have gone into too much detail about the most private parts of their lives, I believe this is one of the best investigations into how Charles & Ray worked, who they worked with, why they did things the way they did, and gave us a good idea of the breadth of projects they worked on and contributed to.",1377043200,2,329,4.32258064516129
4830630,4,B005LVO6QC,"Widely advertised as the first film since their death this film about the Eames's looked promising. Although it is in many ways an interesting documentary, shedding light on the vast amount of projects researched and designed by the Eames, as well as their interest for everything beautiful,  it turned out to be a bit disappointing.
However, for someone who thinks the Eames mostly designed chairs it is enlightening enough and well worth the money, the four star rating is for those people.
The DVD I received played ok on my european DVD player which is a bonus for us Europeans.",1374796800,,582,4.82
4830631,4,B005LVO6QC,Interesting documentary but I really think it's not focused enough on everything that Eames did.  It's a good overview for someone that doesn't not much about Charles and Ray.,1360454400,,175,5.0344827586206895
4830632,4,B005LVO6QC,"A good overview of the life of these both designers.
Objective and you can feel the energy in their office",1357430400,,106,4.35
4830633,5,B005LVO6QC,"I am ashamed I did not know more about this couple and their impact on design! After seeing this, I will never look at furniture (or the world) the same way. Wonderful documentary that I HIGHLY recommend! If you are a fan of design, mid-century anything, or just beauty, you will like this film!",1346544000,3,295,4.481481481481482
4830634,5,B005LVO6QC,"Bought the dvd on january 14th and got it 10 days later. Instead of estimated february 1th.
The dvd showed evrything i expected..  Very saticfied.",1327968000,,146,4.84
4830635,5,B005LVO6QC,"This is a great movie about the life and work of Ray and Charles Eames.
Although at some point it has some very personal interviews and point of views, the final result is a very deep and complete overview of their work/life and the role they had in modern design.
A must see movie for designers, architects and others interested in the creative process.",1325721600,10,354,4.546875
4830636,3,B005LVO6QC,"Charles Eames is best known as the designer of the molded chair - originally designed in 1946 in plywood  (to make it affordable for the post-WWII generation - it is now the standard seating in airport lounges (though now in newer materials). This is all I knew of the Eames name before watching this 84-minute film that aired as part of the ""American Masters"" series on PBS. After watching this DVD version of the film, I can say I know a bit more about the man - and his wife and creative partner Ray - in his post-1946 years. But I can't honestly say I know much about their earlier life and where their talent - and eccentric lifestyle came from.

The Eames were involved in not only designing furniture but Ray was a painter and Charles was involved in making experimental films. Their home in Venice, California is an architectural masterpiece and - apparently a tourist attraction as well.

What we learn from the many interviews - which complement the archival footage of the Eames duo at work as well as in filmed interviews - is that their created a working environment in their studio that encouraged teamwork, but did not give credit to members of the team. All that recognition went to Charles. Many former Eames studio staff are interviewed (quite of a few are, frankly, not very engaging personalities) as are art critics and historians. The one name you may recognize is film Director Paul Schrader (best known for ""Taxi Driver"") whose most relevant comment is among the six deleted scenes (totaling 13 minutes) on the home DVD version of the film. He describes how Charles Eames guided him in one important scene in ""taxi Driver"".

While I did enjoy the film and learned more than I knew before, I was left wanting to know more (and hoping for a more ""engaging"" production). If you are an architecture or design lover and know the Eames work, you'll really get more from this production.

4830637,5,B005LVO6QC,"We screened this film to fifty+ design enthusiasts last night in Sacramento, CA -- Ray Eames' home town -- at the local American Institute of Architects chapter office. Our purpose was to educate attendees and celebrate our native daughter, Ray, and the remarkable work she and Charles did, along with their devoted team. The film provides an intriguing glimpse into their creative process and dedication.

I highly recommend this film to anyone who in interested in the Eameses' lives and prolific work, which ranges from architecture, furniture, film, textiles, art, industrial design to other intellectual and creative pursuits. This film celebrates their work and humanizes them -- not only highlighting their triumphs but also what went on behind the scenes. We received great feedback about this film from people who attended our event.",1324339200,4,842,5.330827067669173
