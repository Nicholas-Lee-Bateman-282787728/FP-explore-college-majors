8043608,5,B0006V5PO4,"This selection of jury-selected films from youth and indie filmmakers is just fantastic. I worked for a company that curated indie social-issue film and video for the library, educational and grassroots activist markets for many years. I've seen alot of indie film, and I heartily believe every collection should have the Media that Matters DVD's.

IF YOU'RE a YOUNG FILMMAKER (or friend, teacher or parent to a young filmmaker) you will love this, and you should know about MediaRights.org who organizes the competition.

IF YOU'RE an EDUCATOR of young people, this is excellent, excellent material for provoking discussions.

You can buy the dvd and go to their website - they have tons of resources and tips on how to host a screening party, etc. As for the actual films, they'll crack you up, make you choke up, they'll anger you, inspire you, humor you, intrigue you. I think my personal favorite is the ""Bush for Peace"" segment, where they took footage of Bush's address and edited it in a very clever fashion.

Mind you, these films are not all about poking fun at politics - some of them are about minimum wage, some are about bullying, some are about exploring and resolving problems in communities, some are about US history, and many of them were made by young filmmakers!

A really great collection. Buy it, enjoy it and make sure you check out the companion informations on the MediaRights.org website.",1105660800,17,1415,4.879166666666666
