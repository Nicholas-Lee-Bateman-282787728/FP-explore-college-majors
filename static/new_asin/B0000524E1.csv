1388582,5,B0000524E1,"This has to be one of the best investments I've made lately.  If you are a Five fan (especially Americans, like me) you need to have this DVD!  The multi-camera angles are awesome!  And the performance itself is just great.  I wish I could have seen them on tour live, but this was the next best thing!  There is a lot of extra footage, including '5 weeks with Five' and a Backstage Pass.  The lyrics option is also cool.  Buy this...I would not want to be without it!",1027987200,,468,4.25
1388583,4,B0000524E1,"If you enjoy 5ive and haven't been able to see them headline a concert (aka American fans) then this is a definite must. This is from last year's Invincible tour which ran through the UK and Europe. Like the Editor's notes, this has 15 of 5ive's songs, and 5ive-cams (two songs only - Everybody Get Up and If Ya Gettin' Down) you can choose to have the cam on your fave 5iver. The concert is great, full of energy and cute moments. The DVD also includes pictures, a Backstage pass where Scott shows the dancers', musicians', and 5ive's dressing rooms, along with production, wardrobe, and the like. Also, they show Live And Kicking's Five weeks with 5ive. This shows the guys rehearsing for their tour, their stylist shopping for things like J's preferred boxers, and outfits for the tour. They show clips of the boys in Russia and England. The video for ""We Will Rock You"" is also included. You also can have different options for surround sound and stereo sound for the concert, along with lyrics being displayed on the bottom of the screen. Filled with great moments with the guys, and well over 2 hours of them, this is a *must.* I got it as a birthday present and I enjoyed it. You will too. ~Any questions regarding this product, email me.~",986169600,,1246,4.566964285714286
1388584,4,B0000524E1,"Some people may think FIVE is a regular boy band, like many others, but that is not true. They surely sing pop music and have dance routines, but that's not what must be noticed when you see them performing live. Five has great singers, with lots of rap introductions to their songs and some interesting  lyrics. This DVD contains their full concert from the ""Invincible tour"" with the best songs of their 2 CDs. From""everybody get up"" to ""Two sides to every story"", the show has great moments.
You can also find in this DVD a 25 minutes documentary previously shown in BBC. It's called ""Five weeks with five"", showing their trip to Russia, their reharsal. There's also a backstage area showing people from their crew in Manchester stadium, right before the beginning of the show.
Unfortunately, this DVD only brings the video ""we will rock you"". I think they should have included in this release the videos of ""don't wanna let you go"" and ""keep on movin'"".",984441600,,957,4.696428571428571
1388585,5,B0000524E1,this is the best tour videos ever.  this DVD allows you to go backstage with them and take a look at one of their tv shows only shown in Europe. it also lets you see how great their concert is.,976406400,,193,3.825

7929805,5,B0000524E1,"This DVD really does give the same effect as being there i went to the concert the night this dvd was filmed and believe me you cant get better than the 5 Funked up hotties. the extra footage (5ive weeks with 5 was televised her in the UK on BBC1 of a saturday morning and itis great to have them all on the same dvd as the concert.
  Its a shame now to know that the boys have split as they were one of the best in the industry, but as long as you have their dvd and vhs releases their memory will live on forever!!!!",1075852800,,518,3.8773584905660377
7929806,5,B0000524E1,"This DVD proves it....This is honestly the best dvd released by a music group. the name of the dvd says it all 5ive: Live

15 very outstanding songs, sung and performed with incredible energy by 5ive...in Manchester. They also talk between some of the songs which has alot of very funny moments with the guys, and they interact with the auidence.
***-2. 25 minute documentary ..Five weeks with 5ive it shows the preperation they had to go thru before the tour. The rehearsals and costume fittings and singing rehearsals. It's presented by 5ive member Rich. There is also alot of funny moments in this documentary as well.
***-3. a short backstage tour before the show. Your Tour Guide is 5ive member Scott. He takes you on a tour behind the scenes and introduce you to important people behind the scenes. He also let's you see the guys dressing room and watch them hang out before the show.
***-4. Bonus promo video: ""We Will Rock You"" *sensational* their remake of queen's ""we will rock you"" is crazy cool.
***-5. Optional on-screen lyrics ( cool feature you can sing along with the concert)
***-6. Photo Section.. look at pics of 5ive
***-7. 5ive-Cam- the DVDS best feature...For two of the songs ""Everybody get up"" & "" If Ya gettin Down"" their is the special feature..the concert was recorded using one camera for each 5ive member so you can watch your favorite 5ive member even when he isn't singing the lead.
Overall this is a kick A** dvd and i advise any 5ive fan to buy this dvd and relive the glory days of the best ... group to ever rock the world!",1052784000,2,2295,4.389671361502347
7929807,5,B0000524E1,"I, luckily had the experience of seeing Five live (In 2000, when they visited Auckland), and it was brilliant. Getting this video and seeing the concert was just like reliving the night itself. Which shows how good this video is (I can't afford a DVD player).
The concert on the video is from Manchester, to 12,000 fans. The WHOLE concert is included, so no you're not getting ripped off at all. The track listing for the concert is:
1. Battlestar
2. Shake
3. Everybody Get Up
4. When The Lights Go Out
5. It's The Things U Do (My favourite!)
6. Got The Feelin'
7. Until The Time Is Through
8. Slam Dunk Da Funk
9. If Ya Gettin' Down
10. Serious
11. Two Sides To Every Story (Another of my favourites!)
12. Don't Wanna Let You Go
13. Invincible
14. Keep On Movin'
15. We Will Rock You
15 high quality songs, most are big hits or the best songs off their two albums that were out at the time. My favourite songs were the two I mentioned above, and the finale ""We Will Rock You"". You get loads of great close-ups of J, Sean, Ritchie, Abs and Scott and they talk loads between the songs, it's very funny.
Also included on the video is the mini documentary ""Five weeks with Five"", presented by gorgeous Five member Ritchie, this is a behind the scenes look at the preperation of the tour. It's very funny and informative.
Overall, a brilliant video. You get 80 minutes of viewing pleasure, a whole concert and a documentary. Great stuff! A must for any Five fan.",1041033600,,1458,4.363970588235294
