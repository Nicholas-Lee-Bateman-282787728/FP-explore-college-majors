8523876,3,B0081AWVBM,"The film starts out as a serious cop/crime story where Jesse (Mel Jackson) takes a rookie cop (Matthew Armstrong) under his wing. Jesse has ex-wife and drinking issues. Afterwards, the film moves into weak horror and winds up as bizarre campy when Huggy Bear (Antonio Fargas) must help our rookie cop rescue Jesse.

The film takes place in New Orleans and indeed voodoo plays into it. The genre of the film jumped around from crime action-drama to horror to whatever. The voodoo ending with women and Fargas jumping about was major league camp and had me laughing. It didn't really tie into the style of the rest of the film.
