It was nothing like it sounds...All it does is rehash his first accusation of molestation and BASHES him the whole way through, calling him a pedeofile (sp?).  It was so awful that it just upset me all over again!  Please do not support the ugly media which once again condemns, accuses, and bashes this innocent, loving, caring man.  In addition the DVD IS MISLEADING.  It says it's a M.J. DVD, however, this DVD has two other clips having nothing even to do with Michael Jackson!  The story about Michael is only about 10-15 minutes long!!  I want my money back!",1315440000,3,712,4.438461538461539
