8434812,5,B004LTB816,Very good.  Very professional presentation.  Henry Jung,1453075200,,55,6.714285714285714
8434813,5,B004LTB816,"Near the beginning of these videos, they comment that they're intended not as a primary training tool, but more as a technical reference. For what I watched of them, they seem to me to fit that bill quite well. I bought them to gain a better understanding of techniques for saber; I discovered that a saber for competition fencing differs from a saber used for personal defense. For that reason, I'll need to purchase another video, but these still seem a solid reference for those seeking competition.",1435017600,,502,4.781609195402299
8434814,5,B004LTB816,"I bought this fencing DVD series over a year ago. I studied it intensely and found it to be very useful as a beginners. Learn Fencing/Leon Paul DVD series are one of the best beginners guide to basic fencing. First of all, It's a great technical reference guide for beginners. It covered stances, footwork, guard/line positioning, parries, disengage and other bladework. I liked that it explained and shows correct execution and also shows some common mistakes while executing the movements. Also good for beginners to learn fencing terminologies - talk the fencing talk. I highly recommend getting this fencing DVD series.",1418256000,,623,5.178217821782178

8434816,5,B004LTB816,"This item usually ships from the UK, but the vendor (Russel Swords) is reliable, highly rated, and service is very fast when you buy here on Amazon.

This series is the BEST EVER as an intro to all three categories of fencing (foil, epee and sabre). In fact, I teach knife combat at blade combat dot com and the series is full of both the practical and ""streetwise"" aspects of training and technique. We use dozens of books on fencing and knife fighting in our classes, but NOTHING is the same as a great DVD (other than live practice!).

There are very few DVDs on fencing out there as it is, and some of the event discs can run in the hundreds of dollars. This series is well worth the price and covers all aspects, from scoring and rules to techniques, lunges, parries, ripostes, counter/counters, counter/beats and many other advanced combinations, in addition to the basics.

Aldo Nadi was perhaps the greatest living fencer ever, and his techniques are used as strategy in this series. Even though he was born in 1899, his techniques were adopted by Fairbairn and many others, due to the fact that he not only consistenly won, but hardly ever was even hit. That's important in real life! The complicated foil rules are all created to try to avoid a ""tie"" -- which in the real world means we both lose.

Some great reprints are available on Nadi's books here on Amazon, although some of the originals are now considered rare and go for hundreds when you can find them. An example is:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nadi-on-Fencing/dp/0486443752/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nadi on Fencing</a>.

8434817,5,B004LTB816,"These DVDs were very good. The different camera angles helped my understanding immensely. They are simply great with their consistency, understanding, and excellence. The best part was the shipper's service! I received this DVD BOX SET in three day!!! That was not Prime, just standard shipping. Great Buy and very much worth writing a review over.",1328745600,5,348,5.232142857142857
