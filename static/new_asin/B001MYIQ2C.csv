3703162,1,B001MYIQ2C,"Even if you like cheesy scary movies, you should still to PASS on this one.

Not even worth going into the story/plot in this review it's just not worth it.

Poor quality picture, crappy acting, crappy script, very tedious to sit through and if you make it to the end without turning it off, you're rewarded with a very unsatisfying ending.

(And while the only other review on Amazon rates this rather highly, 9 of 10 reviews on Blockbuster.com agree with me).  This is not a popular movie FOR A REASON.",1347062400,3,504,4.5054945054945055
3703163,4,B001MYIQ2C,"Excellent psycho-thriller!  Just watched ""Green River"", an indie film from Vanguard Cinema.  It was great, if you like murder mysteries in the backwoods.  Quite tense.  Convincing acting and superb character development.  I would have given it a full 5 stars, but the background sound effects had much too many repetitive crow sounds.  Well worth a cuddle-up on the couch viewing with your loved one.  Just loved the trio of main stars...and the ""cherry"" restored Chevy Malibu.",1263945600,4,477,5.197368421052632

8322535,5,B001MYIQ2C,"excellent writing and directing.

a superb psychological murder mystery with the supernatural horror aspect thrown in as a red herring.
very clever plot twists and meaningful character development which adds to the labyrinth of misleading clues; not just the usual superficial pigeon holing of personalities for its' own sake.",1431129600,,326,5.653061224489796
8322536,3,B001MYIQ2C,what they said this was about was not what i was watching....this chick wasn't looking for her sister....she kept saying her sister ran away and were did this out of the blue pshycho woman come from....that part of the storyline made no sense but i do tend to give people the benifiti of the doubt...even if there were some real storyline issues like the wrote this when they were drunk or high.....still give it a shot....you may find it much for interesting then i did,1422662400,,470,4.541176470588235
8322537,1,B001MYIQ2C,"Made no sense, the ending left me as confused as the plot.  Poor character development, no twist and confusing ending.  The only reason I bother to leave a review is because I came here hoping to find a spoiler explaining the end, with no such luck.  Save your money, and time!",1407542400,,277,4.392156862745098
8322538,1,B001MYIQ2C,My question after seeing this movie is how does schlock like this ever get the greenlight? Only thing worse than the script was the acting,1398643200,2,138,4.56
8322539,2,B001MYIQ2C,"What was obviously meant to be an interesting twist on the psycho-killer-vs-girls-in-the-woods genre turned out to be an amateurish, hackneyed thriller that will likely leave you feeling guilty for having invested your time in it.

Good-looking Charisma brings her whiny, mouse-faced friend Allison to her hometown of Green River, hoping to put to rest her trauma over having lost her sister to a cult that has caused the disappearance of many local women.

The supposed cult is the MacGuffin here, as it really only serves as a motivator for what should have been a psychological character study, but is actually a dopey bore.

Out on a nature hike, Allison loses a little tin of what apparently are anti-homicidal-maniac pills (they make those?), because just a few minutes later, she begins to act maniacally homicidal.

Soon, she leaps to the conclusion that the local fish and game warden is actually the killer of all those missing women. So, she runs him down with his own truck, shoots him twice and sends him floating down what I would assume is the eponymous river before the two girls drag him back to his own cabin and tie him up.

There, he remains taunted and tormented by Allison while Charisma goes for help. But Charisma gets lost in the woods. In what may be the most incoherent scene in an already confused and rambling movie, Charisma begins to hear the ghostly voices of children for no reason at all. The voices are never explained, or ever referred to again.

Meanwhile, the punishment the old man takes at the hands of Allison is almost comical. She puts a gun to his head, insults him, teases him sexually, even threatens to cut his privates off.

What was the director thinking? That the audience is at the edge of its seat at this moment, whispering breathlessly to themselves, ""God, I wonder if the fish and game warden is going to make it? Please, let the fish and game warden make it!""

In reality, the viewer won't give the schmutz between their ballsack and inner thigh if the fish and game warden makes it or not. We're never given reason to care about him as a character, or the girls either, for that matter.

And in at least that area, that's not the writer's fault. Everything else is, but not that. Every actor in the film turns in such a uniformly bad and careless performance, it's like they were pulled straight from a college video project, handed the ""Green River"" script and told to get in front of the camera the same day. They don't care, so we don't care, either.

Oh, and there's a twist ending. But it will come as a surprise only to those people who read the back of the Cocoa Puffs box and are surprised to learn it contains no actual cocoa.

If you read my other reviews on this site you'll see I'm rather forgiving of even the worst direct-to-DVD nonsense, but ""Green River"" was a chore to sit through, even for me. Send this one down the river, folks.",1353715200,8,2905,4.588803088803089
8322540,3,B001MYIQ2C,"The actors in this movie did a great job, but the story, the script, the sound were all just blah. The story made no sense and the conclusion made no sense. The only plus in this movie was the actors.",1348185600,4,200,4.025
