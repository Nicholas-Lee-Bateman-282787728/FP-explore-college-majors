8652874,4,B00443NDHQ,"First impression after one try: Instruction is simple, clear, and upbeat.  There is an intro, warm up, workout, warm down, and bonus section.  Once you complete each section, the DVD takes you back to the menu, where you have to select the next section and hit play again, rather than it automatically taking you through all sections consecutively.  However, I didn't mind so much as I was glad for the 10 second break between sections.  This is a strength training workout, but because of the pace at which the routine is performed and the frequency of changing positions, it is also a solid cardio workout.  No need to do separate cardio in my opinion, on days when you do this workout.  It is fairly comprehensive, with the main focus being on abs.  I like that this series is progressive. I looked at the stuff you are doing by the 6th DVD, and it requires extremely advanced ab work, so this series is definitely intended to give you a rock solid core.  The next day after completing this workout, I felt soreness all over my abs, which had been worked from multiple angles.  I also felt major soreness in the pushup muscles of the arms and chest, and soreness in my calves, and felt it mildy on inner thighs.  There were glute exercises (leg raises and wall sits), and they felt intense at the time, but my glutes were not sore the next day.  Overall this is an excellent core workout, great cardio, and descent workout for arms and legs.  I like that he warms you up and warms you down, which is good for the body.  I would supplement this workout with some additional arm work, and maybe a little more leg work, as well as deeper stretching than you get in the warm down.  I will probably do this workout every other day, add the extra arm stuff on the same day, and then on off days, do yoga for stretching and very light conditioning, and maybe some running for cardio.",1413763200,,1879,4.456140350877193
