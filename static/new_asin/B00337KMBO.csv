The video itself puts a truly wonderful perspective on Demis' music, because the live group with all the accompanying sound effects from that era really give it a nice and very strong acoustic. A cd was a very pleasant surprise, and it features songs that are not on the DVD, so that was cool also. This DVD/CD is a definite must if you enjoy the work of Demis Roussos.",1454889600,,616,4.356521739130435
