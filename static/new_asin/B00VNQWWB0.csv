8710724,5,B00VNQWWB0,"Have been waiting to get the ice cream show forever, because it was out of stock. Now I get to enjoy it, as well as several other Rick Sebak documentaries for little more than I would end up paying for one new movie. These are entertaining and insightful. Truly enjoyable and rewatchable. Sebak is so entertaining and pleasant that I sometimes run his dvd's just when I need to have the sound of someone else around. Very nice!",1439078400,5,427,4.487179487179487
8710725,4,B00VNQWWB0,"I'm not sure why PBS home video chose to wait till August (8/4/15 actually) to release this DVD. By the time people can get it, the summer is more than half over. But it's still fun to watch. (By the way, I received an advance screener for review from PBS.)

The DVD is a compilation of four (almost) hour-long shows that were produced by WQED (Pittsburgh) in 1996 and 1999 and were shown on mostly local stations. I remember seeing at least the hot dog episode and the ice cream one too. I think they may have been offered as pledge-time premiums by PBS stations but this is the first time that all four are combined in one package.

Because two of the shows are nearly 20 years old some of the places no longer exist so I'd suggest googling them before you head out to find them. And there is a bit of irony in ""the Ice Cream Show"" when the amiable host Rick Sebak visits The Creamery at Penn State University and learns that their ""biggest selling flavor"" is ""Peachy Paterno"", named after the late Joe Paterno - PSU's legendary football coach. The university removed the statue of Paterno after the child-sex scandal, so I'm guessing the flavor is now gone too!

If you remember these shows, you'll enjoy seeing them again (I know I did). Just know the production dates of shows though. (They are noted in fine print on the back of the DVD).

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
