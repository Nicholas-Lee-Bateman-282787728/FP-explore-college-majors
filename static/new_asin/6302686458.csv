8221138,1,6302686458,"This supposedly lighthearted comedy was terrible from start to finish.  Though filmed in Paris, every character has a fake vaguely ""European"" accent that is totally annoying.  It concerns the upcoming nuptials of a lawyer (Patrick Dempsey) and an aspiring painter (Kelly Lynch).  The first major problem with the movie is that there is absolutely no chemistry between these two actors.  Dempsey is in dire need of a haircut, and Lynch's sense of eclectic, bohemian attire is nothing short of absurd.  The plot involves her very wealthy family and his family of fishmongers trying to get along.  As a joke, someone invites the Pope to their wedding, and for various unexplained political reasons, he decides to attend.  Unfortunately, by this time the engaged couple has called off the wedding for various farcical reasons (jealousy over perceived dalliances with others, mainly.) The rest of the movie involves a p.r. man trying to convince the warring couple to pretend to get married with the Pope officiating.  At this point, the viewers do not care what happens to them.  A thin plot, poor acting, and bad accents round out this deplorable, predictable film (and I use the term ""film"" loosely).  Don't bother with this one!",1038787200,2,1227,5.059701492537314
