1383655,4,B00004ZDFL,I thought the movie was great.  Hackman and Freeman are very convincing in their respective roles.  Very interesting use of juxtaposing keeps you guessing the whole way through.  I'm not going to give the ending away but I found it very confusing.  It's keeping me up at night.  If somebody has the answer please email me at maldons@yahoo.com.,979084800,,343,4.844827586206897
1383656,4,B00004ZDFL,"Okay.. this was a good movie.  normally in a murder movie the true suspect is revealed.  not in this case. gene hackman was the suspect, but it turns out @ the end that he was completely innocent.  I wish it was a better ending - a little more suspense.  other than that, good movie...",978825600,,285,4.222222222222222
1383657,3,B00004ZDFL,"After seeing the two stars of this movie, I couldn't help but be urged to check this out. I figured it may be slightly boring, but of course a well-acted film. Turns out Under Suspicion is actually extremely attention getting, especially due to the fact it bases around a night of serial murder interrogation. Hackman, a well-respected lawyer with a glamorous lifestyle and wife, makes a report of a dead body to his friend, police captain Freeman. All the evidence starts to turn toward Hackman, and their friendship is never the same again. If you have patience and enjoy the finest acting performances, definitely take a look at this film.",978566400,,642,4.845454545454546

1383683,5,B00004ZDFL,"This movie was a pleasant surprise. In the early part, I thought it might be one of those ""vanity projects"" for Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman, who produce it and act in it. Things start off a little affected, shallow superficial, with the writing and acting even seeming a little clumsy at times. But in retrospect, that was the nature of the characters' relationships at the beginning of the story.

Let's cut to the chase. There are agendas all over the place. Underlying resentments surface in the course of the movie and true characters are laid bare through conflict among the major players. Roles that are sympathetic in the beginning are decidedly less so by the end. Multiple characters gang up on a character who seems slightly oafish in the beginning but who emerges as the one with the most personal integrity by the end (whether you agree with his values or not). Suffice to say that there is much ambivalence about old loyalties and relationships.

It's a amovie about the things people do to friends and loved ones when personal needs and insecurities get into the picture - and the lengths to which people go to hurt those with whom they once were close, when resentments have festered. Ironically, although both of the central figures voice their belief that they are honest in their actions, their tragic failure stems from their inability to be honest with each other.  It's also a cautionary tale about failing to recognize the limits on trauma that relationships can bear and that no matter how much you wish you could change things after the fact, there's a point at which the ties are irretrievably broken. During the course of the story, everyone's past histories with each other factor into the way events play out, and things that happened earlier in the movie begin to make more sense.

It gets intense; it's not an easy film to watch on an emotional level, but by the 2/3 mark, I was completely immersed and couldn't look away. It's difficult to watch the other characters systematically and methodically coordinate to destroy the remaining character (the title of the source book is ""Brainwash""), only to sow the seeds of their own destruction in the process. The landscape is littered with emotional devastation at the end; An engaged viewer will share in the sense of desolation. It won't allow you to be a passive observer.  Like I said, difficult to watch, but definitely worth it. This movie is not light fare and it will affect you.

Acting, direction and production are all top notch. Gene Hackman is well suited for his role and your attention is focused closely on him at the end. Outside of Melana or Ville Marie, this is Monica Bellucci's best work IMO. Her strengths have always been  communicating with her eyes and non-verbal language generally. Opportunites are presented for display of a full palate of postures, body movements and their timimg, etc , and all are exercised. It escapes me how she can appear so vulnerable, vengeful and innocent at the same time.

When the movie was over, I replayed the end sequence four times.  I sat and breathed for a while and then watched the whole thing again from the beginning. Knowing what you do at the end completely changes your perspective of things that were said and done earlier. I reflected on this movie for two days, an unfamiliar phenomenon in my personal experience. I recommend this film highly. I had watched a streaming video of it originally, but plan to buy the dvd now.",1461196800,5,3476,4.770382695507488

He certainly seems so. He is sweating during the interrogation. He likes young girls. He has not had sex with his wife for two years because she suspects him of having had sex with her young niece.

Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman deliver great performances and Thomas Jane and Monica Bellucci solidly contribute to the movie. The reason I rate this movie so highly is the authenticity of mind bending and misdirection that can occur in awful and traumatic events. The flashback sequences provide valuable perspective. Better put yourself in the place of an accused. I would never want to be accused of this kind of crime, but I have seen others accused of crimes that in fact they did not do.

The acting is wonderful, except for Monica Bellucci (who is usually great in everything else, so I don't know what happened here). The plot is tense and intelligent, and although most of the movie takes place in one room, the dialogue is so interesting that you'll hardly notice.
Unfortunately, the movie's downfall, and the reason why I can't give it 5 stars instead of 3, is that the ending doesn't make sense. I don't know what the point was supposed to be,  but I didn't get it. If they had chopped off the last few minutes, the ending would have been perfect.",1359417600,,704,4.543307086614173

The crux of the movie is this: When she thinks he killed the girls, she spits at him. When he thinks she killed the girls, he sacrifices himself to save her. Perhaps Hackman's character is like the ship's captain you trust ""with your life but not your wife.""

  A CRAPPY STORY - MADE EVEN WORSE BY THE VERY UNSATISFYING ENDING.
  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!
  ********************

WHY did these 2 big stars bother to make this movie?  Whatever they saw in it is beyond me.  Perhaps it was written by a mutual friend and they felt obligated to lend their names/talent?

Freeman is a cop, Hackman is a rich audit? attorney. 2 young girls have recently been found dead (raped and strangled) - Hackman called in and reported discovering the 2nd body as he'd been out jogging.  His story doesn't quite add up and on top of that, his car's license plate had been noted in the vicinity of the first body and his story doesn't jive for that day either.

Hackman acts guilty from the get-go, Freeman is sure they have their man.

His trophy wife (some 30-years younger) comes into the station to see why they are holding him and discovers what he is suspected of. She admits to suspecting him of making advances to her pre-teen niece, and gives the cops permission to search the house while they hold her husband in custody.

  *********** SPOILER *************

they find incriminating evidence and he is confessing when another cop comes in saying they found a 3rd body and have the man who did it - who also has photos on him of the 3 crime scenes.  He IS the guilty party and Hackman is now off the hook.  And you're left wondering why HE acted so guilty, had photos it appears he took of the 2 victims, and why he was admitting guilt.
  ******* END OF SPOILER ******

A CRAPPY STORY - MADE EVEN WORSE BY THE VERY CRAPPY/UNSATISFYING ENDING.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.",1345680000,3,1617,4.557491289198606
1383726,4,B00004ZDFL,"Under Suspicion (2000) is a re-make of a French film Garde  vue (1981) directed by Claude Miller and starring Romy Schneider, Michel Serrault, Lino Ventura and Guy Marchand. It was based on the British novel Brainwash, by John Wainwright. I did not see the French film simply because I can't find it but I've seen Under Suspicion more than once and enjoy it every time even though I know how it ends.

As a thriller/mystery/crime investigation, Under Suspicion (2000) teases a viewer and more likely would leave a fan of the pure genre disappointed but as a psychological character study which uses the mystery and serial murders investigation as a device to explore the darkest places of human desires and relationships, it is very good. Besides, watching for almost two hours the duel of wills, intellects, and despairs between noble as always Morgan Freeman and exceptional Gene Hackman is a treat. The director's approach to narrative that allows the viewer to be placed along with Victor (Freeman) inside the flashbacks of Hackman's character, Hector, is interesting, unusual, and fresh, and adds to an uneasy and dark atmosphere of the forbidden and deeply hidden desires and fantasies. As great as they both are, for many years after I saw the film for the first time, it was the striking beauty of then relatively little known to the American viewers, Italian Monica Belucci that I remembered vividly. The film director, Stephen Hopkins wanted to cast Monica Bellucci after watching Malna (2000) while on an overseas flight. I am glad he did. She did not get lost next to her celebrated partners in the film. I also think that moving the action to San Juan, Puerto Rico during the San Sebastian Street Festival that is celebrated every third week in January was a good idea. The carnival atmosphere of music, vibrant colors, and grotesque masks strikes the dramatic contrast with the harrowing devastating experience the main characters of the movie go through and the place in life they find themselves after the investigation is over. Will they ever forget?",1342396800,2,2067,4.971098265895954

Had to post a review here in light of previous ones that knock the ending. It's not wrapped up in a little neat bow that makes you happy. Its the necessary conclusion when considering everything that has been pushed out into the light about Henry's(Gene Hackman) life up until now and what comes after all this.

The visuals, the cinematography, the in-your-head scenes walking through their flashback thoughts during tense arguments while other characters are in their watching and looking for inconsistencies.

And I love the variations of the theme music that plays during the movie, very emotive. Too bad the official soundtrack doesn't have any of it.

1383729,3,B00004ZDFL,"This is a suspenseful tale with good acting and many twists and turns. Hackman and Freemen are excellent. The plot was sound for most of the film, and it held together...until the end. The problem is that the movie (which is to say, the screen play writer) violated a cardinal rule @ endings--one must provide the viewer with an ending that is satisfactory/coherent/makes sense. This movie leaves that out. I'm not saying that an ending cannot be ambiguous--but it at least has to say something.  Here, we get a twist at the end that is not explained, then the movie ends.  Also, there's just too mush in here that is unbelievable--Hackman's a lawyer in the film, yet allows himself to be questioned for hours without consel?

Proof after proof is supplied to show that there can be no question of this man's guilt. With these great actors and such an interesting plot, how can this fail to be a box-office smash?

To begin with, there is absolutely no connection between the human drama unfolding and the time and place of the events, which merely serve to add an element of color to what basically is a three-person drama, four if you want to include the mediocre acting of Freeman's assistant. I believe the producers chose San Juan at Carnival time because they were afraid that audiences would reject a claustrophobic and rather stagey drama which could as easily take place within one single room, anywhere on the planet.

This would have made a great one-hour radio drama or TV movie. Freeman breathes life into his part, but my admired Gene Hackman falls progressively apart somewhat as though this were a play on the London or New York stage. Monica Bellucci is a fascinating and beautiful enigma, whose motives never become clear.

In the final analysis, the film ends up confusing the spectator. Why should we have to go back and see it again, to try to find out what really happened, and how it could possibly have happened? It's a darned shame!",1291593600,,1850,5.194630872483222
1383732,4,B00004ZDFL,"""Under Suspicion"" is a story of a harrowing cross examination that claws to prove that an esteemed lawyer has murdered a 12 year old girl.  Henry Hearst (Gene Hackman) is a lawyer living in Puerto Rico with a beautiful young wife.  Harry is brought into the local police station before a Charitable Fund-Raising event he has agreed to support and give a speech.  The local police captain (Morgan Freeman) and his eager assistant Detective Owens (Thomas Jane) ask Harry what he was doing before he discovered the body of the young murder victim.

Harry has trouble keeping his story straight and as clues add up against him the angst of his situation builds.  Then after two long hours of dredging up painful personal stories and nebulous evidence, the final scene falls flat.  Evidently the message is ""Who is telling the truth?"" Don't jump to conclusions.

1383733,1,B00004ZDFL,"I consider myself, at best, an average movie buff and deficient in the word-smithing skill of a professional movie reviewer.  I enjoy good suspense and thrillers. I also almost always enjoy movies with either Gene Hackman and/or Morgan Freeman. However, I just saw UNDER SUSPICION on network television (Jan. 2010) and thought it was horrible. Only after the fact did I realize that the gist of this movie was simply to show 110 minutes of family therapy involving Hackman and his wife (Monica Bellucci) with Freeman as the therapist.  In an attempt to make the therapy less boring, the movie uses the device of a psychological murder mystery, an investigation set in a police station.  But the device fails miserably.

An experienced lawyer like the one Hackman plays would NEVER sit around in a police station, hour after hour, being grilled by policeman Freeman. It's just not credible. And THAT is the sum and substance of what this movie is about, Hackman (and his wife) being grilled by Freeman in a police station, an exploration of their inner motivations.  Even worse for credibility: Hackman and Bellucci trade places on either side of a one-way mirror in the police station, listening and watching as the other is grilled by Freeman.

In any event, I almost couldn't watch the entire movie, but did so with the hope the ending would redeem the movie, make sense of it. No way. The ending is worse. Just as one of the protagonists finishes confessing, another police officer bursts into the room with news that the real killer has been caught!

1383735,5,B00004ZDFL,"""Under Suspicion"" is a truly remarkable film that addresses a taboo issue. The film is well head of its time, which will ensure it remains classic for years to come.

Based on John Wainwright's 1960's book ""Brainwash"" and the 1980's French film ""Garde a Vue"" or Police Custody. The book title gives you a hint of the plot which neither film title does. Whether the American movie is loyal to the French film or British book I do not know, but the European influences are readily apparent.

One can expect superb performances from Hackman and Freeman, but one should also expect that such actors can choose superlative plots. Under Suspicion is a complex plot which explains why so many do not see it. If anything it is too complex.

One of the advantages of film over print is that a film can use multiple Points of View far more readily that print.

The first point of view is that of the junior detective, ably acted by Thomas Jane. Horrified by the crime - rape and murder of two children, blinded by prejudice, the detective jumps to the gut belief a rich dirty old man must have done it. The detective reflects the mob mentality.

The second point of view is that of the senior detective (Freeman). Both detective and suspect (Hackman) are of similar age, know each other and have similar marital problem, so a battle of wills develops between them. This is common plot device used to encourage the audience to identify with the characters but in this film it detracts from and confuses the plot.

The film opens with a plot device intended to create tension. The suspect is on his way to public speaking engagement when called in for questioning. This is implausible and again detracts from the plot. The device becomes effective when the senior detective's boss puts pressure on the detective to release the suspect to fulfil the engagement.

The evidence against the suspect (Hackman) is circumstantial. However the suspect's explanation of the events is confused and self-incriminating, which serves to convince the Senior Detective of his guilt. Hence the title of the French film - Police Custody.

At one stage the plot `thickens' leading the audience to suspect the male suspect is guilty of under-age sex, but his wife is guilty of murder, driven by jealousy. This plot line is made implausible by the beauty and young age of the character playing the wife, Monica Bellucci.

The subtext of ""Under Suspicion"" is classically French. Many Hollywood films seek to capture the beauty of French film when seeks to get behind the headline ""Lock your daughters away - Paedophile on the rampage, raping and murdering little girls."" French film often deals sensitively with the cause of such issues. The problem is not Hollywood' failure to portray the issues but the audience demand for likes of Scream 1, 2 and 3.

The subplot, the theme of the film, is played out by the suspect (Hackman) and to a lesser extent by the wife (Bellucci). The subplot is brilliantly portrayed by Hackman. Whether he is guilty or not is irrelevant by the end of the film. The suspect is coerced into believing he is guilty. Hence the book title ""Brainwash"".

The Point of View of the wife, told more than acted, reveals the sub-plot and the theme of the film. She first met the suspect when she was twelve and he was a 30 year old adult. His hobby was photography. She delighted in the attention of his camera lens. As she grows she accepts his patronage to attend university and finding men of her own age wanting, she returns to seek him sexually. Passionately in love, they become the celebrities of their town, until one day she sees him paying the same photographic attention to her niece. Blinded by jealousy she believes his intention can only be sexual. In her jealous rage she freezes him out. His sexual deprivation, his love of photography, merely serve to provide motivation to the circumstantial evidence. If his wife, the one person he loves, can believe he is guilty, then he must be. Hence he confesses to something he had not done.

""Under Suspicion"" is a gripping and frightening film. Its shows how innocent people can be made to feel guilty and be found guilty by social prejudice, ignorance and misunderstanding. More frightening is the potential sequel to the story. That a person made to feel guilty, but found not guilty, can and probably will proceed to commit the crime with impunity. Both themes have been portrayed in other books and films. I do not know of a film which portrays both themes with the subject of paedophilia. Lolita is probably the closest one can get. Under Suspicion fires a warning shot across society's bows. It warns that the more society is blinded by moral indignation, which is happening with paedophilia, the worse problem will get and innocent people will be destroyed by the prejudices of the lynch mob.

All film functions to reinforce or question society's values and attitudes. Society, even in 2009, is not yet ready for the questions raised by ""Under Suspicion"". Brilliantly acted, directed and edited, `Under Suspicion' is undermined by the commercial demands on contemporary cinema. But it has got to be 5* for its courage alone.",1244246400,7,5178,4.791479820627803
1383736,4,B00004ZDFL,"Attorney Henry Hearst (Gene Hackman) has dream life--a gorgeous trophy wife Chantal (Monica Bellucci), a mansion on paradisical San Juan Island. partnership in his firm.  Then he discovers the body of a little girl and reports it to the police--as any good citizen should.

Captain Victor Benezet (Freeman) is a hard-working police captain who investigates the first death and discovers more. He calls Henry to the station on the night of a prestigious charity event for questioning along with his subordinate Detective Owens (Thomas Jane).

The problem comes when Hearst's story doesn't quite stack up.  On the night of a benefit ball where Hearst is supposed to speak, Benezet calls him in for questioning.

Benezet is under a lot of pressure.  Hearst is a powerful man on the island and a friend of his boss.  Plus, he's the keynote speaker at the fundraiser--and the island needs the money.  Hurricane Lucy has just ripped through and despite the party atmosphere, they have a cholera outbreak, open pits for sewers and the other plagues a storm leaves behind.

The questioning is rough, revealing omissions in Henry's story, plus his life isn't quite as much of a dream as we'd once believe.  We see the story unfold  through testimony, flashbacks, and current happenings.  Henry and his wife sleep in separate bedrooms--regarding the alibis: ""We don't ask those kind of questions anymore..."" Henry regularly visits young prostitutes, because: ""Someone opposite Chantal. A prostitute will give you a great deal for a little bit of money..."" Henry has a fondness for young children--he 'raised' Chantal to be the woman of his dreams...

But--did he do the crime or didn't he?  I was almost on the edge of my seat wondering through the whole film.  Both Hackman and Freeman give stellar performances and the story is fascinating, but I think I could have done with about 20 minutes less film somewhere.

If you're a fan of intense, interpersonal drama, this film's one for you.  You see lives laid bare under the white lights of an interrogation room. ""Under Suspicion"" definitely opened my eyes about police questioning.

1383740,5,B00004ZDFL,"The title foreshadows the subtle reality behind the film, missed even by some professional critics. Hackman plays Henry Hearst, a noted attorney, and rather well-off, to say the least, and a close friend of police Captain, Victor Benezet, played by Morgan Freeman. Hearst's much, much, younger wife, Chantal, is the erotically, gorgeous, Italian star, Monica Bellucci.  Thomas Jane plays a not-so-bright, detective, with a desire for violent solutions to gaining a confession. Hearst, is apparently, incredibly wealthy, and on his way to be the be key note speaker at an event at the request of Captain Benezet's boss, when he is asked by Benezet to stop by headquaters for ""ten minutes, or so,"" to help out with the case of two murdered teenage girls.

Ten minutes stretches into hours and a cat and mouse game between the obviously brilliant lawyer, Hearst, and the cagy, Benezet, ensues. Benezet has his pal squirming, and Hearst's gorgeous wife has shut him out of her affections, over what she saw as his attempts to seduce her teenaged niece, so the introduction of Benezet's evidence of Hearst's possible dallaince and murders of girls about the same age as the niece who is object of Chantal's apparent insecurity, (or was it an excuse (?) for her to rebel  against, or reject, her older husband), gives her cause for reflection. As the torturous grilling goes on, the stress on the participents becomes almost unbearable. Hearst and Benezet are featured in innovative flashbacks of the sort one sees regularly on CSI Miami, and as the tension builds, tempers flare, violence seems right around the corner, and one wonders, where is the lawyer's, lawyers(?), as the duel works it's deceptions into the psyche of the suspect, witnesses and Interrogators.

Hearst's guilt/innocence, glides back and forth with every new revelation of each member of the drama. I shall not spoil, the conclusion for you, but the acting, direction, script, and settings are flawless and the ending is somewhat unexpected, though we guessed correctly, our companions did not.

What floated under the radar, hence my title, was the lustfull envy of both Benezet and the young, violence prone, detective at Hearst's wealth, position, intellect, possessions, prominently including his luscious and much younger wife, Bellucci as Chantal. One can see the roiling covetousness of the antagonists of Hearst, and the feeling rises, that one sees so often now days, of a lawman making every effort to nail a wealthy and fortunate man, at the expense of justice. Benezet, seems determined to wreck the rest of Hearst's life to satisfy his jealousy and his young assistant seems to care little about anything but throwing a few punches and maybe getting closer to Chantal, also Benezet's, seeming, but more reserved desire. Mankind's error is that the interpretation of the word ""covet"" does nor merely mean desiring what another has, but acting maliciously upon that desire, to steal it away, whether or not they benefit from their action.

It is the old case of penis, cash and prominence, envy, of men locked in jobs which pay is nominal, who lust after what they cannot have and another, whose grass may not be as green as they think and desire.

You cannot go wrong with Freeman, Hackman, and Stephen Hopkins masterful direction, exposing lust, uncertainty, disloyalty, distrust, immaturity and  envy. Watch Hackman, in the final scene, display his self-respect, despite what must have been a heartbreaking realization.

The only questionable thing, which seemed a bit ludicrous in this taut drama, is why Hearst, a skilled and successful attorney, did not immediately clam up and call a criminal attorney. It appeared to be an author's less than honest, contrivance, a shill game, which covered up a weakness in the plot-line which would have alerted Allen Shore-James Spader-Boston Legal, had this been written by David E. Kelley. Kelley would have reconstructed the plot to compensate for the oversight or laziness, or the attempt to put one over on the audience. He would have post-haste ended the interrogation and cut to a trial instead. The proper answer by Hearst to the first subtly suspicious question should have been, ""Either arrest me, release me, or I will call my lawyer, Right now!""

The dessert is that even the measured glimpses of the alluring Monica Bellucci, remind one of all besides the art, the food and land/seascapes, that is good about Italy.",1170460800,3,4450,5.075239398084816

The plot drags along somehow maybe because there is not much suspense or action and the ending is predictable. There are no scenes which touch on human emotions and the characters are not very likeable. But it is worth watching just for the acting of Freeman and Hackman. Both actors are brilliant and sure made the best out of their roles. The theme is nothing new. For me it was a bit strange that a character like the one Gene Hackman is playing couldn't hold out such an interrogation without getting completely confused and disconcerted about what had really happened.

1383743,2,B00004ZDFL,"Like its French inspiration, ""Garde a Vue,"" this Stephen Hopkins film attempts to follow the tack of a psychological thriller but fails. It might have taken the path of a pure who-dunnit except that it is far too slow, caught up within its self imposed venue and contains entirely too much trivial talk.

I'll mention, for purposes to be addressed later, that the the film is an adaptation of the English novel ""Brainwash,"" by John Wainwright, but unlike every novel's predisposition, this film makes no attempt to 'set up' the characters so the audience might witness their methodical exposure. Freeman and Hackman are intermittently engrossing during the very long 101 minutes it takes to reach the end - and it is ever the ending the writer has in mind. The bulk of the story is a setup for the ending, so, if the story isn't spun out adroitly, the ending becomes pointless and you've wasted 2 hours and seven bucks.

Hackman and Freeman certainly have the chops to work in a more tightly wound presentation, but their characters need more meat on their bones so the audience even cares that one or the other's flesh is being stripped away in front of our eyes. We're never given the opportunity to meet these protagonists, form any opinions or understand either characters essential facade, so, in the end we just don't care what happens to either of them.

Hackman, meanwhile, exemplifies the socially prominent tax lawyer whose penchant for young women gets him in a lot of trouble.  Monica Bellucci is delicious to look at, and has the chops to sustain her role; Thomas Jane adds some gruffness to his somewhat egotistical detective.  I found director Stephen Hopkins' ""gimmick"" of juxtaposing the interrogation with the actual flashbacks a unique and entertaining change of pace; it kept us confused as to whose story to believe.

1383747,5,B00004ZDFL,"In this movie, we clearly see how Gene Hackman, who has it all in every sense of the word, has his life basically brought to a head for him.  Hackmans character has been charged with the murder of two girls, and certainly it is plausible that he is guilty.  The inconsistencies in his story, his troubled relationship with his wife (who was herself a young girl when he met her), and his penchant for photography as well as whores, get him into a great deal of trouble and simply add to the suspicions.

The power of the tale does not lie in the fact that there is a straw man.  Hackman's credibility does deserve to be questioned, for he is truly a troubled individual and his many peccadilloes deserve an explanation.  At the same time, the accusing officer, Morgan Freeman, has good reasons to doubt Hackman, but as the movie progresses we also see that part of Freemans motivations stem from his own personal insecurities, particularly vis-a-vis Hackman himself (access to wealth and power, among other things).

No, the film is taut and well-constructed, but it teaches us an important lesson:  acussations should be dealt with directly.  If anything, the power of the film lies in that because Hackmans character was directly interceded to answer for his supposed malfeasance, we are able to see not only his defense, but also his gradual acceptance of the accusers version of the facts.  However, we see in the end his true motivation for many of his, albeit, very suspicious actions: love for his wife, who it appears does not love him back or has become so consumed by jealousy (perhaps) among other problems of her own, that she is unable to see his love for what it is.

Hackman's acquittal in the end does not come without a heavy price for him, and not just because his reputation has been tarnished.  He does, to some extent, deserve the mistrust and scrutiny to which he was subjected, for he was not without fault.  Moreover, had things not come to a head at that particular juncture, it is not clear where Hackman's life would have gone: it is not implausible to think that he could have eventually done the things he was accused of.

However, the accusers motivations remain unclear, and the sense of love that motivates him is so strong that, at least for the final moment in the film, it is they who are diminished, and he fearful to watch in righteous anger.

In my opinion, at the very least, the directness with which he was confronted does credit to the accusers, for they at least were clear and honest.  Any other approach smacks of hypocrisy, of an overly established sense of propiety from the accusers, of an intent to do harm.

In the end, they both save themselves through a mutual desire to, together, establish a truth that is necessary for justice to be brought forth.",1102291200,2,2802,4.6417004048583
1383748,3,B00004ZDFL,"Under Suspicion was a bit of a disappointment, considering the magnitude of the cast consisting of heavyweights such as Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman, and Monica Belucci (!!!), though it's a far cry from being a bad movie.  The potential for a great movie was definitely there.

In short, Gene Hackman's character is under suspicion by the police (Morgan Freeman) for raping and murdering two teenage girls on the island of Puerto Rico.

It's a good plot, a great setting and a wonderful cast, but the leading actors (who also happen to be the producers...) seem to be lacking that special chemistry.  Moreover, Gene Hackman fails (surprisingly!) to convince in his role of Henry Hearst.  The young cop with the chip on his shoulder was a bit of a clich, and as for the dialogues they could have been greatly improved.

In addition, Morgan Freeman ""accompanying"" Gene Hackman through the scenes during the unravelling of the story did not add to the overall entertainment; it was done as a novelty to add originality, but it would have been better if they hadn't.

Most importantly, however, it is really the weak dialogue and the chemistry (or lack of) between the two main heroes that takes away the most from what could have otherwise been an amazing movie.

1383750,4,B00004ZDFL,"The heavyweight casting of ""Under Suspicion"" might be so impressive that it ultimately hurts the film.  Certainly the idea of having Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman in a room going after each other in a lengthy police interrogation is going to be worth the watching, but given who the principles are director Stephen Hopkins may be stacking the deck too much in terms of how we resolve the film's ambiguities.  After all, we fully expect Freeman to be playing a good cop and you can never really look at any character Hackman is playing without wondering what he is really up to.  The tag line for this film only serves to emphasize this idea: ""Everyone has secrests.  Some of them are crimes.""

This 2000 drama is a remake, after the peculiar manner of such things, of the 1981 French film ""Garde  vue.""  This time the setting is in San Juan, Puerto Rico, which allows the film to have an exotic element while retaining the rules of American jurisprudence.  During the celebration of San Sebastian's Feast police captain Victor Benezet (Freeman) asks prominent attorney Henry Hearst (Hackman) to come in and answer a few questions about the statement he gave about finding the body of a murdered girl.  This is the second such murder in the last couple of weeks and the police are trying to capture what they fear is a serial killer.  But as Hearst answers Benezet's questions more and more holes appear in his story, which raises even more questions about not only what the lawyer was doing when he discovered the body, but what other things he has been up to in recent weeks.

Clearly we are to think that Hearst is guilty, but from the start we have the feeling that there is more that is going on here than meets the eye.  But the more Benezet uncovers Hearst's questionable interesting in ""young"" women and his troubled marriage with the beautiful Chantal (Monica Bellucci), the more we become convinced that there is something missing, some key piece to the puzzle that we do not yet understand.  Herding us in this direction are the frequent pronouncements by Det. Felix Owens (Thomas Jane), who is investigating the murders, that Hearst in absolutely guilty.  This guy in trying to drive the nails into the coffin way too soon and even sabotages the interrogation in his eagerness to get to the part when Hearst gets executed for his crimes.

The fact that this is a criminal investigation obscures that what we have here is a psychological drama.  Benezet believes that he can find the truth by unraveling the layers of lies and obfuscations that Hearst has created about his life and personal habits.  Step by step the interrogation strips away not only Hearst's secrets but his toupee as well.  To get Hearst to crack Benezet brings Chantal Hearst into the process, hoping that she will allow them to search the house and asking her questions that illuminate more lies in what her husband has been telling the police.

Part of the attraction here is that Hearst fights back.  He knows that Benezet has recently been divorced and is able to put together some telling guesses about the glass house in which the captain is living.  Hearst knows how the game is played and is sharp enough to know when the police are overplaying their hand.  He is a respected member of the community, supposedly giving them ten minutes of his time on his way to give a speech at a fundraiser, and he knows that bringing him down could make the careers of Benezet and Owens.  But the main strength of the paper is that whatever the shortcomings of the script Hackman and Freeman make you pay attention.  I would have loved to have seen them do this as a stage play, without the Hopkins constantly showing us in flashbacks what the two men are talking about, and letting these two heavyweights carry the entire thing.

In the end, what you think about ""Under Suspicion"" comes down to whether or not you buy the ending.  I can see how many viewers would have problems catching and understanding the ""why"" for what happens.  I picked it up the first time simply because I was paying more attention to a look in the eyes more than what was being said at the crucial moment.  Be fully prepared to watch this film twice, so that you can reassure yourself that what happens at the end comes both logically and emotionally from all that comes before it.  I think you will be able to see how it makes sense, although you might not appreciate that the came comes to an end with a quiet surprise rather than a big shock.",1094342400,6,4500,4.618090452261306
1383751,2,B00004ZDFL,"I first caught this movie by chance on the Bravo network. It seemed like it had the makings of a great film, and Freeman and Hackman do a fabulous job. Although it can at times drag on, due largely in part to the permanent setting of the police office, the dialogue and dynamic between Freemand and Hackman is intense and engrossing.

I was really looking forward to the ending, as the plot up until that point kept building up the suspense and had me asking a million questions. Then it happened, and it made no sense. Hackman's character confesses to a murder he didn't committ and a lot of other stuff happens that makes no sense. Right after watching it I got on the internet to see if somewhere somebody could explain what the heck the ending was about, and all I found was dozens of other people as confused as I was. Some sites mentioned that the director said that the whole reason Hackman's character confesses to a rape/murder he didn't committ was because he couldn't stand to live if his wife really thought he was such a monster. That explains a little, but there are still huge holes. So if he didn't do it who did? Some random guy who is never identified is hauled into the station and it is clear that he is the murderer, but it also seems like the wife had something to do with it, possibly to frame her husband and also maybe because she was upset when she saw him laughing and talking with his young niece. But really, is that reason enough to try and frame him as a perverted murderer? And if it was all her idea, then why does she seem so shocked by everything?

My best guess is that she wanted to divorce him because they were in a loveless marriage, and she was sick of him lusting after young girls, but she couldn't just have a regular divorce because he husband was a powerful man and it would have been a mess. At the same time she had a feeling (and she was correct) that her husband had a fasciantion with young girls, so I guess she got in cahoots with some murderer and planted all this evidence to incriminate her husband so she could divorce him easily. Thats why he says at one point ""I can't believe she would go to all this trouble to make a point"", he knows what she is doing, she is framing him because she is bitter, neglected and whats a divorce, and he know it. He gives in and says he did it because he doesn't want to deal with her anymore, and realizes for the first time that she really hates him and would go to extreme lengths because she really thinks he is a monster. It might also be because he knows that he is sick and perhaps he feels guilty.

I love a movie that makes you think, but the ending of this one forces the viewers to completely invent a reason for the ending because there are no explanations that actually exist in the plot.",1085443200,6,2792,4.274102079395085

Some of the reviews here about the movie's unexplained ending baffle me because I think that the power of suggestion was precisely the point. I'd also have liked to have known more about a few things, but that's a minor gripe. It's a near-perfect film, had they just tied some loose ends in the finale for the general public.

The script doesn't bother to explain this obvious point.
The obvious answer is that they wouldn't have a movie.... but isn't the writer supposed to devise some credible explanation? That's why they make the big bucks, after all.",1045785600,,648,5.240384615384615

Compounded by this interrogation-style movie, we expected to have a treat.  In many ways, this movie meant to do well with a great location such as Puerto Rico, the female star in the form of Monica Belluchi (who found fame in an Italian movie, & also as a beau to Bruce Willis), & not to mention a director, Stephen Hopkins who gave us ""The Ghost & The Darkness"", starring Michael Douglas & Val Kilmer.  Sad to say that I was disappointed with the outcome & it was quite akin to ""Snake Eyes"", a dud starred Nicholas Cage & Gary Sinise.  The interrogation was constant in a room, & there were flashbacks from those three main characters.  Camera tricks were used to make it interesting but the premise of this movie was so thin & that after two hours, we couldn't help it but exhausted by the ordeal.  This movie explored also the strained relationships between Gene Hackman's character & his wife, & also testing the friendships between Gene's character & Morgan's character.  Anyhow, to have those two as executive producers as well, they really missed the target by a wide margin.  No wonder this movie went straight to the video market.

1383757,2,B00004ZDFL,"Despite the fact of the excellence of acting of Morgan Freeman and the interesting performance of Gene Hackman, this movie comes off as a mishmash.  The theme of sexual abuse of a child is such an emotionally loaded one that it needs to be treated with great sensitivity.  In ""Under Suspicion"" (US), it is exploited to further the plot.  Hackman as Henry Hearst is great in the scene where he confesses that he ""likes them young"" as his young wife watches through the glass.  Thomas Jane is explosive as the young detective who can't control himself.  Monica Bellucci as wife Chantal comes across as an ice princess, covering all emotions from A to B.  The DVD version doesn't offer much more, no deleted scenes.  The discourse on the filming is embarrassing.  Freeman and Hackman talk about how much they loved the French film (Garde a Vue by Claude Miller) on which this was based.  Because US is so poor, it's sad to see how little enthusiasm can accomplish.  They liked the tension between the characters; and that was good.  Perhaps this is why the two stars, who were also the executive producers, were blinded to the fact that the film also needed a coherent plot and an ending the audience can take with them.  As a result, this comes off as more of an artpiece than a movie.  We could retitle the film ""Under Depression,"" which is how I felt after wasting my time watching it.

1383758,5,B00004ZDFL,"I admit!  The ending threw me off. Thinking that I missed something, I reviewed the last ten minutes.  No change.
Here's my take on the ending...
When Detective Owens stumbled in on Hearst's interrogation to deliver the seemingly incriminating photos to Detective Benezet, Owens cleverly stated that Chantal took the initiative to lead the detectives to the incriminating photographs. Owens' statement was not true because Chantal clearly had no knowledge of the photographs before Owens discovered them for himself in the darkroom. Since Hearst heard Owens statement, Owens unknowingly tricked Hearst into thinking that Chantal had discovered the photographs prior to the murders.  At this point Hearst assumed that Chantal murdered the young girls out of jealously and rage, notwithstanding the fact that the victims were precluded by the fondness Hearst kept for their neice. Because of his inequities, Hearst felt responsible for her actions.  To protect his wife, Hearst began to confess.",1023926400,7,993,5.470588235294118
1383759,4,B00004ZDFL,"Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors. Gene Hackman ranks right up there as well. That is why I watched the movie; that has something to do with why I enjoyed it because frankly I can't see someone like Arnold or Bruce playing either of the characters in this movie. But there's more to it than enjoying two actors I respect perform at their best.
It is obvious before this movie is too far underway that both these men are superb at what they do. There isn't a lot of action, so if you like car chases and bombs exploding, this one isn't what you're looking for. I enjoyed watching Freeman and Hackman verbally duke it out with the control moving back and forth between the two men through to the end. Just when I thought I knew what the truth was, the tables were turned and I was back to square one. I like books and movies that incorporate psychological undercurrents, and who doesn't like seeing the great and powerful brought down a peg or two? I wasn't prepared, however, for the extent to which this movie explored the fact that nothing is ever what it appears to be.
I would not recommend this movie to all my friends because some of them just don't have the patience to stick with this story. But for those who appreciate this kind of developing story built upon with insightful revelations that change the way in which the characters are viewed, I highly recommend it.",1016582400,4,1385,4.456692913385827
1383760,3,B00004ZDFL,"From the way its distributor, Lions Gate, yanked it out of theaters after just a handful of play dates, you'd think Under Suspicion was a disaster. Perhaps from a marketing standpoint, it was. To people who love movies, though, anything starring Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman is worth a look-see, and Under Suspicion, while marred by a few slow spots and a rather weak ending, is no disaster. I can assure you that sparks fly when Hackman and Freeman are on screen together.
The setting is present day San Juan, Puerto Rico. Police Captain Victor Benezet [Freeman] is investigating the murders of two young girls. A big problem is that the finger of suspicion points at Henry Hearst [Hackman], who is not only one of the island's most respected citizens, but also an old friend of Benezet's. On the night of a big charity event at which Hearst is the guest of honor, Benezet calls him in for a short question and answer session before the event. The interview turns into a lengthy one in which Hearst's life unravels before his eyes. The plot line concerns two things. The first is whether or not Hearst is guilty. The other is an examination of how brutal an investigation into one's private life can be. With today's high tech police technique's, even the innocent can become the guilty because of other things the process can reveal.
Even though this is not their finest movie, Freeman and Hackman are at their finest. They are the type of actors who do not give a bad performance, regardless of the strengths or weaknesses of the script. Each has always been smart enough to combine a good work ethic with his genius. Also noteworthy is Thomas Jane as Detective Owens, although he is handicapped by having to play a very stereotypical character, the type you are all too happy to see leave the scene. Monica Bellucci, who plays Hearst's much younger wife, is a major star in her native Italy. Her role requires little more of her than standing around looking exquisitely beautiful, which she does extremely well.
I think Under Suspicion is most appealing to those who enjoy a good play. While director Stephen Hopkins does take some advantage of the glorious Puerto Rico scenery, much of the movie takes place in two rooms of the police station. This gives it a stagy feel, which some people do not at all enjoy.",1016323200,13,2318,4.697788697788698

The story was interesting, and the ending had a strong double twist.  The script was fairly well developed, but the story lacked ""umph"" and requires some patience to get through.
Location Underused:
The Old San Juan and the general Puerto Rico locations were extremely underutilized.  In fact, except for a handful of passing shots, the movie could have been shot anywhere, in any studio.
The location was an enticement for me to purchase the video, and the lack of local ""color"" left me very disappointed.  There are so many incredible locations, breath taking views, interesting local haunts that would have made the movie more interesting, better developed the story and plot and given the viewer more twists to play with.  But, they were not used.

That being said, a viewer might well miss or overlook some details that helped ""unravel"" the plot (if so, you better watch this movie at least twice to fully enjoy it -- as in the case of ""The Sixth Sense""). I won't go too far and give away anything, but let me remind you to pay close attention to how Hearst (Hackman) reacted when being presented with the photographs of the girls, because his face and his words explained everything.

1383764,4,B00004ZDFL,"I went into this movie thinking it would turn out to be something like THE USUAL SUSPECTS.  While that film is really good, UNDER SUSPICION far, far exceeds the genre many people think it belongs in (much like Sean Penn's THE PLEDGE, also a tremendous movie).
UNDER SUSPICION is not a tricky whodunnit movie.  It has the look and feel of one, it even has a (slightly) twist ending as others have pointed out before.  But in the end, there is no Kaiser Sose revelation.  I think many people were disappointed by this (as many were with THE PLEDGE).  Many people were also upset about the ending, which when you think about it was completely obvious and fitting with the story.  I personally don't think it had a twist ending.
At any rate, this movie is really good.  It's not perfect (which is why I gave it four stars) but it's pretty close.  Many movies can, at the end, be confusing.  Being confusing is hot very hard.  But when a movie has you questioning whether what you think is right, what you think really happened, and what the point was, you know it's a good movie.  I'll admit I was a little miffed at the ending, but a couple minutes later, when it hit me, my jaw dropped.
If nothing else convinces you to see this movie, the fact that you get to see Gene Hackman do such a tremendously great acting job should be reason enough.  The man is an underrated genius, and UNDER SUSPICICION proves that fact once again.",1012521600,2,1425,4.417624521072797
1383765,4,B00004ZDFL,"For me, any film that has me wondering, without total bewilderment, at the end of it I have to say bravo.  I am yet to figure out what motivated Hackmans' character to do what he did at the end of the film.  But to me this is a film focused on the process and the layers revealed as the onion is peeled rather than the final solution.  As such the ending was neither a disappointment nor brilliant.  It just is.
The mystery of the crime is just a backdrop for playing out the essence of these characters.  We are privy to see some of their deepest secrets, fears, and desires revealed.  Who's honest vs who's lying.  Upright or immoral?  Intriguing if not completely satisfying.
And I realize that this was not a stellar film but it is one that is much more memorable than most modern fare.  All I can say is watch it for yourself and make your own decision.  And if you're a guy just seeing Monica Berlucci is sufficient reason to watch it because she is just off the hook.",1007510400,2,974,4.273224043715847
1383766,2,B00004ZDFL,"It seems to me that ""Under Suspicion"" was inspired by the great French film ""Pure Formality"". There are a lot of similarities between them. In both movies there is a ""duel"" between a suspect and interrogator. Both movies are set in the police station. In both movies there is a psychological drama and an unexpected finale. Also there is a love story and a final redemption of the main character. But the French movie has an otherworldly and mystical twist while ""Under Suspicion"" stays totally secular.
Although ""Under Suspicion"" is not a complete lemon, the ending is a big disappointment. On the other hand, in ""Pure Formality"" not only acting is great; but the ending also is awesome. If ""Under Suspicion"" is worth watching at all, it is only because of some interesting filming techniques and great soundtrack, inspired by the Puerto-Rican Carnival.

The supporting actors are his wife and a detective, each with their own agendas.
As the evening lengthens against the background of a local holiday and the aftermath of a hurricane and a charity ball at which Hackman is supposed to be the featured speaker, tension builds with man and wife watching each other questioned but not able to hear what is said.
 The movie direction is surprising and effective, moving characters as observers to scenes as they hear what happened. The ending seems confusing because of all the lies and expectations that have been built up as Hackman's character is shredded. All four characters play to win and nobody does.

1383770,3,B00004ZDFL,"'Under Suspicion' is one of those movies which is, to put it honestly, mediocre. It stars two fine actors (Morgan Freeman & Gene Hackman), is quite innovatively directed (by Stephen Hopkins), and has an interesting setting (Puerto Rico during a carnival). The plot, on the other hand, comes across pretty standard.
  This is basically a police interrogation, familiar to many as it has been rendered time and again on television and in other movies. It is done well, by all involved, but it has also been done before. Hackman and Freeman, and the direction of Hopkins, lift the telling of the tale up a notch, but it still feels like old ground. There has been crime commited (in this case two murders), there is a prime suspect (Hackman), and so he and the overzealous policeman (Freeman) square off for a close-quarters interrogation.
  This sort of scenario, though well-worn, can make for a really good movie, so I sat back and soaked it all in. The film kept me riveted throughout, until the ending came along. Now, I am not here to give anything away - don't worry. But what I will say is that the picture suddenly went from its entire focus of a ""Did he do it?"" interrogation flick to ""Let's pause and reflect upon these characters, their lives, their hopes, their troubles, their fears, their desires, their angst"" - etc. etc.
  A movie which wants to end so poignantly must be sure to make the audience care about the characters. Maybe other viewers did. I did not, as I took this movie as a mystery/thriller. Most mystery/thrillers are simply plot-driven, and I saw no exception with 'Under Suspicion'. In a mystery/thriller, most of the actions taken by the characters are usually scrutinized for how they affect the *plot*, not the characters themselves.
  I don't know if I've expressed my thoughts on the matter very well - perhaps not. But my final word on the film is that it is enjoyable and engaging until the last 5-10 minutes. Just be prepared for what some may deem a possibly disappointing ending.",993859200,6,2019,4.732193732193732

1383775,5,B00004ZDFL,"I always knew Gene Hackman was a superb actor but he eclipses even himself in the complex layering he gives us of a man under suspicion of double rape and homicide.  It reminded me early on of a French film I had been oddly unmoved by, 1981's ""Garde a Vue,"" and then I learned this was a remake of that film.  Usually, we Americans ruin it when we remake French films but this time I think it is quite the reverse.  One reason is Hackman and the other is that the director and writers have opened this film up so it lost its stagey aspects and moved well beyond the confines and restraints of the police station. Hackman is interrogated by Morgan Freeman, no slouch himself in the acting department.  However, Freeman's police captain character simply does not have the complex nuances of Hackman's.

Picture a man who absolutely hates his life, although he is rich, at the top of his profession and married to a beautiful but much younger woman.  What might this man do to release himself from the deadliness of his daily life?  Would killing two girls release him from the grips of this being-dead-while alive state?  Or would he be more likely to shoot himself in the foot or walk in front of a bus?  What extremes of human behavior will he go to in order to break out of walking around like a zombi? This is the fundamental question you have to ask yourself about Hackman's character throughout and he indeed has you vacillating on predicting what he did do.  When you run the entire film back through your memory, the ending, which I cannot tell you, completely fits.  The end makes total sense if you tuned in throughout to each particle of the character that Hackman gave you, starting with the time he first picked up the phone to call the police.  He, after all, is a lawyer who should know better than to open a door he wants to keep shut.  Or does he?

1383777,2,B00004ZDFL,"You might wonder how with a cast that includes Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman and Thomas Jane (Boogie Nights) can this remake of the 1981 French thriller Garde a Vue fall flat.  It's obviously not in the acting, and Lost in Space director Stephen Hopkins does a suprisingly good job at the helm.  So it's got to be the writing, right? Well, not exactly.  The writing is actually pretty good for the first hundred minutes or so, but it's when they try to pull the rug out from underneath us with it's obligatory twist ending (which is quickly becoming the biggest cliche in screenwriting), that things go array.  The dialogue builds tension in a brilliantly subtle way but then they shoot themselves in the foot with a climax that makes everything that proceeded it seem meaningless.
Freeman plays a Puerto Rico police captain who reluctantly calls in an old friend to be questioned regarding the murders of two young girls.  Hackman's the prime suspect, having found the second body and spun an inconsistent story that doesn't match the facts of the case.  The give and take between the two as Freeman unrelentingly interrogates Hackman's character is a marvel to watch and the only reason to see this movie at all.
Henry (Hackman) is the subject of this psychological rape as he's mercilessly grilled by the captain and his overzealous partner (Jane) into pouring out his every indiscretion to them.  His story is picked apart and scrutinized until he's on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  I suppose that's what the movie wants to be all about.  It's not much interested in being a crime thriller but has much loftier goals in mind.  It wants to turn the looking glass on a corruptible system of police work, even when it's inadvertent, that puts such a strain on the accused.  That's the real intention of of film, to suggest that the crime's not in the criminal offense itself but in being held under suspicion (thus the title which was modified from the novel ""Brainwash"" by John Wainwright).
During the course of the movie Hackman has his civil liberties stripped away one by one, and by focusing so intensly on his ordeal it undermines the fact that two children have been violated and murdered.  This would be a tense, taunt suspense thriller is only it weren't for those last five minutes which try to be reflective and thoughtful but instead come off as a ridiculously forced conclusion.  In retrospect I realize that the resolution has it's intended purposes, but I still can't help but feel like the authors wrote themselves into a corner that they inevitably had to cheat their way out of.
The acting is good, so good in fact I almost hate to give this picture a negative review, but it does little to salvage a scattered plot.  Hackman's thoroughly impressive in the way he allows Henry to be torn down without compromise, never allowing his ego to get in the way of the story, though he probably should have.  Freeman is equally good, proving once again that he can play just about any part he so desires.
And the directing's beyond reproach.  Hopkins makes clever use of the camera, allowing the audience to become a part of the story as he tells it.  He's very liberal with flashbacks, permitting the questioning parties (Freeman & Jane) to intrude on the moments as Henry's reliving them.  This is about as creative as movies get, which is quite impressive but only makes me dislike the film even more.  The fact that such highly original moments are wasted on a plot that's going nowhere only serves to make the finished product more distressing.
If you missed this one in theatres you're not alone.  It was barely released stateside, which should give you an idea of just how awful the ending truly is.  A real disappointment.",985651200,3,3745,4.730769230769231
1383778,1,B00004ZDFL,"With Hackman and Freeman as stars (and Executive Producers, no less), expectations are high that this will be a well-acted and tense piece of work.
Instead, two minutes into the film the dialogue has already announced itself as painfully stiff.  The film is utterly devoid of the twists and turns that make a thriller, thrilling.
Hackman's anger at being accused, ebbs and flows for no known reason. Freeman's dignity is undermined by inane writing. And his overeager detective-sidekick is pure characature.  The only clues are completely spelled out and since the ending is in no way foreshadowed--even in retrospect--you feel completely manipulated.  In fact, the only reason I continued to sit through the movie was in hopes that the ending would redeem what came before. It surely didn't.
The direction, where someone's idea of art was to sporadically overlay the interrogation into the scenes of the crime, just made the lunacy more vivid.
Even in a time of bad movies, this one takes the cake.  That it didn't see much theater time suggests it is possible to reach a low beyond which distributors won't go.
I'd love to know why Freeman and Hackman attached their names as actors and executive producers to this total fiasco, and if I can't get back the $3.75 I paid to rent it, perhaps this at least serves as fair warning to others.",983836800,10,1339,4.859649122807017

The delicious Monica Bellecci is seductive and compelling as Hackman's wife.  The question at hand is:  Did Hackman murder two young girls?  The format is very stagey: most scenes take place in a police station, with flashbacks and possible scenarios fleshed out in interesting ways.  As a mystery, the film is average.

1383782,4,B00004ZDFL,"Puerto Rico is the unlikely setting for UNDER SUSPICION, a who-done-it that's essentially a stage spotlighted for two of America's finest actors, Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman. The latter plays a police captain, Victor Benezet, investigating the recent rape and murder of two young girls. Hackman plays lawyer Henry Hearst, Victor's erstwhile friend, and now the prime suspect. This film features less of Hollywood's usual recipe of thrills, and focuses more on the personalities of the two principals as they verbally spar back and forth as Benezet attempts to close the case. Thomas Jane plays a young homicide detective who'd rather beat a confession out of Hearst  than obtain one through the finesse of interrogation. The magnificently sensual actress, Monica Bellucci, plays Hearst's much younger wife Chantal, icily unavailable to his physical affections after deciding that he was having an affair with her teenage niece. Or was he?
The duel begins when Benezet requests that Hearst stop by the police station to answer a few minor questions. After all, it'll only take ten minutes or so, and Hearst will not be delayed attending a charity fund-raising dinner across the street, at which he is to give the main toast at the behest of Benezet's boss, the police Superintendent. Talk about pressure to get on with it.
Initially, the plot seems nothing more than a revamped COLUMBO script, as a weary police officer tries to winkle a confession out of a canny adversary. But, it's more than that, even beyond watching these two old pros, Hackman and Freeman, display their acting skills. As Hearst recounts his alibis, which are portrayed to the viewer as flashbacks, the director inserts the Benezet character into those scenes, as if he were physically present, allowing him to ask more questions of Hearst as his alibi unfolds.  This is an ingeniously clever effect that I've not seen in any film previous. And then there's the stunning beauty of Bellucci as she plays Hearst's Ice Queen. Wow! (Yeah, I know, mine is a guy fascination, just like in Monica's splendid Y2K film MALENA.)
The ending is totally unexpected. (""Huh? Say, what!""). And, profoundly sad, if one considers the ties that continue to bind in a love relationship gone sour.",980812800,27,2252,5.051075268817204
1383783,5,B00004ZDFL,"Wow, what a great film.  Produced by Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman this remake of ""Garde A Vue"" (and based on the book Brainwash) was totally captivating.  Henry Hearst (Gene Hackman) is asked by friend Captain Victor Benezet (Morgan Freeman)to stop by the station and answer a few questions.  The day before Henry discovered a body of a young girl and a few details needed to be sorted out.  But what starts as a conversation turns into a long interigation where Henry becomes suspect and a hidden past is revealled.
I love the way this movie was shot.  The director Stephen Hopkins(Lost In Space)used an unusual way of showing the interogation where the crime scene was reinacted while Henry described it.  Gene Hackman deserves an award nomination for his performance in this film.  Its not often he is cast as this type of character.  In the begining of the film it looked like the usuall Hackman but his character turned from a strong willed person to weak, frail and scared, and he did it perfectly.
The dvd has both wide and full screen options, Stephen Hopkins and Morgan Freeman commentary, making-of featurette and theatrical trailer.

1383784,4,B00004ZDFL,"I watched the movie, was a little thrown off by the ending, but here is what I think was going through Henry's head:
Henry is a stubborn man from the middle class who is living his dream life, especially from the outside looking in. He has money, power, some local fame, & a trophy wife. The reality is his marriage is in shambles. Remember what he said about getting divorced, he would be ruined finacially, losing his house, half his money, and half his share of the law firm. Socially he would be regarded as a fool because he let go of a young attractive women, and, As Morgan points out, the only reason he is on everyones A list is because of his wife. Seeing the insurmountable evidence against him, his way of bowing out of his marriage gracefully (ugh) was to confess to the murders. This sounds stupid, but, rather than give up everything he will be taken where he won't have to deal with any of the repercusions(sp?) of his break-up.
thats about the only semi-rational reason I can come up with. Mike",979689600,2,1011,4.440860215053763
1383785,5,B00004ZDFL,"One has to suspect that any film starring and produced by Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman is going to be good.  That assumption would not lead to disappointment in this case.  This is a terrific psychological crime drama with an excellent story, great acting and powerful directing.
Henry Hearst (Gene Hackman) is a prominent and wealthy citizen of San Juan, Puerto Rico, who found the body of a young girl who had been murdered.  Police captain Victor Benezet (Morgan Freeman) is a long time friend of Hearst's and asks him to come down to the station answer some questions and tie up some lose ends.  What ensues is a blistering interrogation where it is clear that Hearst is the prime suspect.
The script is smart, probing and full of nuance.  Subtle hints in both directions make us continually re-evaluate Hearst's guilt or innocence as the interrogation twists and turns.  The ending is a surprise and quite abstruse, requiring some reflection to fathom.
Stephen Hopkins' (Lost In Space) direction is fabulous.  The camerawork is excellent, using various perspectives and jump cuts to lend power to the dialogue.  I would have liked to see more character development of Captain Benezet to understand his obsessive motivation of trying to nail Hearst.  Also, it seems a bit incongruous to have this set in Puerto Rico and have so many obviously American characters.  Nonetheless, the work by Hopkins is first-rate overall.
The acting is superb.  Morgan Freeman gives a brilliant performance, worthy of an Oscar nomination in my opinion.  His dogged pursuit of Hearst never lets up as he is slowly eaten alive by his fixation with proving Hearst is the murderer.  Hackman's performance is equally outstanding.  His is the most complex and mentally tortured character in the film, and he portrays Hearst like a rat on an electric grid.  Italian star Monica Belucci is mysterious and lovely as Hearst's suspicious wife in one of her few American films.  The only mediocre performance comes from Thomas Jane as the detective.  He is unable to match the rhythm and intensity of the rest of the cast.  This part probably should have gone to a Hispanic actor in keeping with the setting.
This intense and clever film keeps the audience guessing throughout.  I rated it a 9/10.  It is an entertaining film for the thinking viewer.",979171200,67,2327,4.933161953727506
