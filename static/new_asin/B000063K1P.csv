7959220,4,B000063K1P,"This is my 7,5/10 mangaupdates review for the manga of which this is an direct adaptation. The anime is based on the first 40% of the source material btw: This manga is directly comparable to the first few South Park seasons before that show turned into biting satire and a masterpiece. The author also changed after he moved on but not for the better as this remains his best work with ""Wanitokagegisu"" (8/10). I also turn to America and Europe for (sex) comedy's but this one succeeds as it puts black/toiled humor first and titillation second. The humor will probably turn off the general audiences and the quirky art won't help but the first half (basically the amine) can be true comedy gold. Some of the rape jokes overreach, the story goes on too long and does not quite finish (hehe) but that part should get a translation too as it is still interesting. I don't get why the author decide to set this at a middle school or why the (surprisingly functioning ) romances aren't resolved but readable ecchi is rare so i will crown it the as maybe not as the king but certainly as the jester in the land of the blind. ""Genshiken"" (8/10) mentions the manga btw. and the also reviewed ""Love in Hell"" and ""The Penisman"" by ISHIDA Sui should be your next destination.",1426204800,,1266,4.532751091703057
7959221,5,B000063K1P,"I enjoy this in your window humor. We need to open our mind to this kind of humor. Looking around the world sometimes we forget to laugh, But not with this one. It got me laughing. Its adult humor so don't want the young ones asking you.",1371081600,2,237,4.0638297872340425
7959222,5,B000063K1P,"Its not like today's anime, it adult funny with tons of subtext in it. What's not to love about it.",1356652800,,99,4.0
7959223,5,B000063K1P,"ping-pong club (make way for the...) is the most HILARIOUS ANIME SERIES i have ever seen. i have been watching anime for over a decade (im not a n00b), and i have seen it all. the humor is filthy, outrageous, and down-right obscene, but it is done SO WELL and SO HILARIOUS, if you don't laugh, you must be a PRUDE and/or easily offended.

As to the 14 yr old that hated it so much, some people just don't understand (or aren't OLD ENOUGH to understand) witty vulgarity and offensive parody at its finest...gender also doesnt make a difference. im a chick! i was a teen when i first saw ping-pong club and i died laughing. TO EACH THEIR OWN. however, this is a DEFINATE MUST for those who love HUMOR, esp. raunchy and offensive humor. the animation/art is perfect for the type of anime it is, really fits with the characters and the situations. I LOVE IT. i wish i owned it DVD, what an awesome collection that would be!! also, if you like GOLDEN BOY, you will love PING-PONG CLUB. it never stops being funny, even after all these yrs.",1112140800,,1034,4.385416666666667
7959224,4,B000063K1P,"This is one of the funniest series I've ever seen. (...)
Ping Pong Club is the funniest Anime you'll find.  Well atleast it's for me.
I really have nothing to say except that if you liked south park you'll love this.

7959225,5,B000063K1P,"Finally, Software Sculptors releases the first volume of the Ping Pong Club. You may ask yourself, just what is the Ping Pong Club? Well, it's exactly as it sounds. A group of boys have their own Ping Pong Club in school, but it's more than just that.
CHARACTERS
Maeno: The funniest of the bunch who constantly tries to amuse the club with his antics.
Izawa: Maeno's partner in comedy.
Takeda: The captain of the Ping Pong Club. Pretty much the only sane one.
Tanaka: The cirle-headed ... of the group. Constantly fantasizes.
Tanobe: The stinky American member of the group. For some reason, he is the only one who doesn't realize he smells.
Sachikawa: The pretty boy of the group. Yet, he hides a terrible secret.
Shimazaki: The principal of the high school and a big rooter for the boys Ping Pong Club.
This volume contains the first 8 15-minute episodes of the series. Here's a rundown.
Episode 1: The Ping Pong Club has a test of manly-hood.
Episode 2: Tachikawa tries to force the boys team out of their club room for the girl's team.
Episode 3: The boy's Ping Pong Club tries to fight back to win their room.
Episode 4: The boys come up with a way to get their room back. Underground porn.
Episode 5: Girls start falling for the boys, but this can only mean bad things to come.
Episode 6: The boys club gets a new manager who is a friend of Takeda.
Episode 7: Thanks to one of Maeno's stunts, he must go out and buy new ping pong balls. But can he be trusted with all that money?
Episode 8: It's hot so the boys go to the pool. But with an agressive female instructor watching them, will they live to enjoy it?
The extras are quite nice for this release. We have english audio commentary by the voice actors for Maeno and Izawa on Episode 5. But this is a character commentary. In other words, the voice actors retain their roles to make comments on their same roles. Confusing, huh? We also have textless opening and closings and as a special bonus, footage from the 2001 Big Apple Anime Fest.
Overall, these episodes can hold their own in comedy and highly recommend this title to anyone who wants to get into anime, but dosen't like it ultra-serious or sensitive. It's delinquint humor at it's greatest.",1030320000,5,2212,4.477722772277228
7959226,5,B000063K1P,"First off I would like to say I am a big fan of this series so my review may be a little biased.
If you have ever seen any episodes of the ping pong club you know It has very off the wall sick humor which may not appeal to everyone but it is this kind of humor that makes this show so good. This dvd contains episodes 1-8 so if you haven't seen the ping pong club yet you should start off with this one.
Now you would think a series usually takes a few episodes to get warmed up and start getting good but this series starts off in the first few minutes to get really good which really suprised me because i started watching this show from episode 23 (i think)and thought the first episodes would be mellow, which they are far from. Now this particular anime series is the funnest show I have ever seen both from movies and anime mainly because it crosses so many boundries that you don't see in american movies or cartoons.
One more thing I highly recommend that you watch the show with japanese dialogue and english subtitles, it's MUCH better then the english dubbing.",1030233600,2,1071,4.254901960784314
7959227,5,B000063K1P,"Any anime that pays homage to Lupin the 3rd is a good anime in my books.
I'll let the other reviews tell the rest of the story.
'nuff said.
(Actually, it isn't. If South Park offends you, you'll probably suffer a heart attack while watching this. If South Park seems tame to you, you either MUST buy this, or you have seen this.)",1015286400,,329,4.238095238095238
7959228,1,B000063K1P,"This is the WORST thing I've ever seen, I'm 14 and trust me YOU DON'T want to see this unless, your a guy... But then also guys there is a warning in here for you also, IT'S not for people into Fushigi Yugi, Sailor Moon, No Need For Tenchi/Tenchi Muyo, Gundom Wing, Outlaw Star, Card Captors/Card Captor Sakura, NGE, and any type of Anime that is WAY romantic, action packed, a thriller, a tear jearker, or a drop dead funny show/movie/whatever! I SOOOOO give this a BIG FAT 0 rating, they course almost NON stop, there is A LOT of blood and other things I'm not going to mention incase kids are reading this! I saw this at my friends, adn HATED it! It's her older brothers, and now we understand WHY he told us not to watch it with him.. heh heh ^-^' (Not my idea!)",1001289600,,766,4.217687074829932
7959229,5,B000063K1P,"The opening credits are super, the song is so catchy that I had to chase down a copy of the soundtrack (not easy when it was never released in the country I live in).
However, the Ping Pong Club videos are not for the  faint of heart.
I saw this video for the first time at a Christmas party  that got a little weird - and the video fit the people, I suppose.  It was  a shock from the usual anime, as we are all serious lovers of shows like  Rurouni Kenshin and Earthian.  Those shows focus on beautiful animation,  deep plots, and occasional (more so in Kenshin) comedy pieces to lighten  the mood.
Ping Pong Club is about comedy.
Not to say the animation is  BAD - it's a different style certainly, but interesting in its own way.  It's the humor that's the focus of the show; I don't remember 8th grade  being like this!
Basically, the cast consists mostly of hormone-driven  8th grade boys, all with sick ideas of humor and ""normal ways to court  girls.""  Nudity, sexual fantasy, and cross-dressing fills this video.  If you like that type of humor, it's hillarious.  If not - well, this video  isn't for you.
For people who do enjoy some of the weirdest anime to be  released by Software Sculptors from Japan to the US (thank you!) - who can  forget Maeno and the ""turle"" scene?  Yow!",928108800,2,1290,4.362869198312236
