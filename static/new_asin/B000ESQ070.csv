8113896,5,B000ESQ070,Very good overview of Costa Rica Parks and Wildlife. Nothing much about the people but great narration by John Forsythe. I have watched this over and over. I absolutely love this country.,1224288000,,187,4.875
8113897,1,B000ESQ070,It's too bad there isn't a zero star rating.  This DVD doesn't work.  There is no sound and you can't leave the main menu.  I explored the DVD with my computer and discovered that in the audio folder there are no files.  A big disappointment since its advertisement makes it seem just right for my interests in Costa Rica.,1173571200,3,322,4.406779661016949
8113898,2,B000ESQ070,"Recognizing the limited availability of video adequately covering Costa Rica this DVD may meet your needs, but potential purchasers should be aware of the following:

1.) While the DVD release date or copyright in 2006 may imply recent release this does not accurately reflect the production date.  Actual footage is of older vintage.  That is not to say that the content is not a decent quality.  However, be aware this title may be a bit outdated.

2.) These DVD's are duplicated on DVD-R media and are NOT compatible with all DVD players in all regions.  To avoid a DVD that does not play correctly (or at all) verify any intended player is capable of handling DVD-R media before ordering.

3.) Lift up your senses.  Quick investigation of all reviews provided by Rocky Mountain ""Lisa"" on March 3, 2006 will reveal an identical voice of enthusiastic approval for all LMXMEDIA releases available through Amazon at the time of this review.",1148515200,4,940,4.867924528301887
8113899,3,B000ESQ070,"First, I am well acquainted with Costa Rica because of my

travels there and to Central America. I liked the content

of the DVD even though it is somewhat lacking in variety but they do show things like Cocos Island (the island of the sharks)of Jurassic Park fame but they don't show Mt. Chirripo or Cano Negro. In essence, they only show the major tourist attractions.

To it's credit,it does not come accross as an Infomercial like some other DVDs on Costa Rica.

John Forsythe is a good narator and he is easy to understand unlike some of the Globetrekker narators.  You will see a lot of Costa Rican nature on this DVD and the quality is very good but not out-standing. The DVD states it was was released in 2006

This is why I only gave it 3 stars:

1.) I could not get the interactive menus to work on

  2 of my expensice DVD players. This must be a flaw

  with the technology used in creating the DVD. It did

  play on my daughter's cheap $ 50 unit but without the

  menu system being functinal.

2.) I got the DVD interactive menus to work only when I tried

  playing the DVD on my computer and then only when using

  Real Player which is not my preferred method of watching

  movies.",1145664000,4,1200,4.2792792792792795
8113900,5,B000ESQ070,"I have this on VHS along with the Belize and Maya one, so glad to see them on DVD now!!! They are so well done and very informative. If you like to escape to exotic places in reality or even in your mind, the Ecotravel films are a must have. Really breathtaking vivid shots of the land and wildlife with amazing music which corresponds so well with the visuals, very pleasing to the senses. You will play them over and over and get lost in them. SOOOO thrilled to get them on DVD!!!",1141344000,,482,4.193548387096774
