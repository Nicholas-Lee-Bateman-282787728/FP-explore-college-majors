8489156,4,B005Y5NP7Q,"This is an independent film from writer and director Jamie Thraves. It tells the story of Tom (Tom Fisher), who at the age of forty decides to leave his wife and small child for no discernable reason. He just gets on a train for London and bins his identification and beds down on the street - as you do.

He then gets attacked by a gang of homophobic thugs who think he is gay. That encounter leads him to A and E and as is fairly typical it is full of an odd assortment, including Aiden Murphy (Aiden Gillen) who takes a shine to Tom. Whilst Tom is withdrawn and obviously troubled, Aiden is over the top gregarious and the sort of person you can often encounter on public transport - the `nutter on the bus' type.

Aiden takes Tom back to his flat which he shares with his `girlfriend' Linda (Riann Steele), she is a street wise and savvy low end of the market prostitute, who also knows a good deal when she sees it. She injects some visceral realism into the whole proceedings.  Aiden makes money by doing anything which includes renting out `Treacle' a neighbours cat for mice hunting in `greasy spoon' cafes.

This is a very quirky film, but it is also a comedy, a study in the human condition and mental health problems. Aiden Gillen is just excellent and caries the film with the weight of his performance and what at first for me was a very irritating character actually becomes likable because of his over whelming positiveness.

This was made for 30,000 which means some corners are slightly rounded, though not necessarily cut. There are a lot of questions that are ignored let alone being addressed, but to mention them might be a plot spoiler. That said I really enjoyed it, the music is good too, including the under appreciated `Fanfarlo'. At eighty five minutes this held my attention throughout and made me laugh and cringe in places, I wish Jamie Thraves all the best for his next venture",1320624000,3,1908,4.518840579710145
