8263921,5,B0016PWN5I,"Bob Clark was a wonderful movie maker and a fun personality. It is obvious from this film that he loved to make movies and loved to have fun making movies. And he made some wonderful movies. Of course, A Christmas Story being the most known, but on the flip side, there is Black Christmas, which is also very good. This is a great tribute to a great man.",1363046400,,354,4.220588235294118
