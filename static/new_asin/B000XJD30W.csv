3003676,4,B000XJD30W,good quality production ...good script ...a bit like polanskis repultion but lacked the genius of that film ...all in all a good effort ...ms moss did a very good job with a very demanding roll the weak element was the cops ...they would have arrested her for frankies murder and shot her dead for not dropping the gun hence the missing star,1482796800,,341,4.516129032258065

3003750,1,B000XJD30W,"It's just a pity that I can't select less than one star!  Over time I have found that any movie with the title of a part of the house is usually bad, you know, like The Kitchen, The Bathroom, The Hall Closet.  The Attic is no better.  It is a short story desperately attempting to become a movie, and falling hard to the pavement as it makes this attempt.  There are way too many sub plots that draw you in but go nowhere.  At the end, when you find out what the reason is, there is yet another sub plot stuck in, just to confuse the hell out of you some more.  I have said this before and I remain firm in my belief that if you are going to endeavor into sub-B par movies, at least have some gratuitous nudity to push the star rating up to at least a one.",1477785600,4,756,3.9407894736842106

However, a root canal would be more enjoyable. The plot could have been decent; all they needed were writers! Pfft! Thinking more on it, the movie could have been decent enough, all they really needed was a good script, actors, a director, and a good production team.

The acting was; um horrible seems about right, but ... Maybe they took lessons from William Shatner? If not, they definitely gave their all (and then some) for nothing! It's a good thing it's included with Prime, or I would have really feel screwed. Even for a bad movie, it's just bad. I tried to find at least one redeeming factor here, but there are non to be found. I don't know if the positive reviews are from fans of the actors, friends or relatives of those who made it, or what. I don't really care, either. I know that I thought this movie was utter crap. Based on the 2.8 stars I see as of today, I am not alone.

3003808,3,B000XJD30W,I am a big fan of Elisabeth Moss but would have preferred Alexandra Daddario in the lead. She would have seemed more plausible and endearing in this part. She was hardly onscreen at all and that was disappointing. The story was okay but Elisabeth Moss was miscast in the leading role. Ii would have given it Four Stars if Alexandra was the star. She deserved it and is a fascinating stunner.,1467590400,,391,4.52112676056338

3003876,4,B000XJD30W,"I'll have to agree that the story was good, but a movie is only as good as it's directors and editors. They were some stellar actors in this movie so we cannot blame them, I think they did the best they could. It's true that the interweaving of a lot of plot turns was not done carefully. This lowered the movie from very good to just like. There were also some cheap effects going on like the Wicca symbols that suddenly appeared in the attic. Really? Florescent paint under a  strobe/black light? I felt like I'd been transported back to the 70's. It held my attention though because I was waiting for the ""great plot twist"" that would explain all....instead it was just a murderous crazy girl who WAS made crazy by an entity in the house but they NEVER went into that.

3003893,2,B000XJD30W,"Barbara Streisand is one of the greatest singers of our time. Beyonc is a pretty good singer, an excellent dancer and one of the most beautiful women on earth. The thing that they have in common is that I can't stand their music. If Streisand or Beyonc come on the radio I promptly switch the channel. Great talents that just don't do it for me, just like this movie. Good acting, direction, dialogue, camerawork etc., and a creepy, eerie plot that I usually find very engaging.  Despite all this, I never got into it and the movie seemed to go on forever. Really awful, but I couldn't say why.

The movie had so much talent in front as well as behind the camera that surely I couldn't go wrong with picking this one out of the sea of stinkers out there in stream land?
I found the writing to be the ""biggest looser"" in this movie because the story doesn't really go anywhere and when it does at the end you have been waiting throughout the entire movie for it and other things to happen. As I mentioned before it starts our fast for a good setup, but then meanders along until the end and along with Moss's affliction that doesn't make much sense to me considering what was going on in the house?
The production values were quite nice except for some acting, direction and again the writing for a movie in this genre and helps this rate 2 stars instead of 1 star.
This was a terrible waste of talent and viewers time to watch what should have been a really good horror/thriller movie with a good cast.

3004207,1,B000XJD30W,"After moving into her family's new home, a college student Emma (Elisabeth Moss) starts seeing things. Apparently all these spooky images have something to do with herself and her father (John Savage). Terrified Emma refuses to go out, feeling that she is gradually losing sanity while her only hope is John Trevor (Jason Lewis), a local detective and possible love interest who offers his help to unravel the mystery and end her plight.

The plot of ""The Attic"" may look pretty nice, but the end result is just horrible, absolute mess that you will regret spending your time watching. Characters behave illogically with lots of overacting that is not fun to watch. Poorly written and edited, the film is not scary at all, not a single moment. There are even several major plot holes that actors are desperately trying to ignore.

The film is directed by Mary Lambert, best known as director of Stephen King horror ""Pet Sematary."" It was 20 years ago, and though the film is not a classic, it is still mildly entertaining. Now she made ""The Attic,"" a plodding and confusing horror film that is devoid of scares, even unintentional laughs. My advice: Avoid this one.",1272758400,2,1165,4.82
3004208,2,B000XJD30W,"The Attic (Mary Lambert, 2008)

This is another one of those movies with endless promise that failed completely in the execution. Lambert (The In Crowd) gathered together a sterling cast and presented them with a script (by Tom Malloy, also responsible for The Alphabet Killer, co-written with Robert M. Reitano, an Emmy-winning editor) that desperately needed another few rewrites.

In this one, Emma (Elisabeth Moss from TV's Mad Men) and her family--father Graham (John Savage), mother Kim (Catherine Mary Stuart), and mentally challenged brother Frankie (Love 'n Dancing's Tom Malloy)--have moved out to the country. Emma hasn't left the house since the move. Part of it seems to stem from agoraphobia (one of the places the script could have used a bit of work was in illustrating this better), and the other part from an encounter she had in the attic; when exploring, she uncovered a mirror that seemed to show her not a reflection of herself, but an entirely different person who looks exactly like her. Her inability to leave the house handicaps her when it comes to investigating, which becomes necessary when weird things start happening, but she finds a tenuous ally in a local detective, John Trevor (Sex and the City's Jason Lewis). Together, the two of them have to find out what the deal is with Emma's supposed twin before the twin comes for her family, and for Emma herself.

While the ending is pretty predictable (and the plot twist in the final scene you should be able to see coming from a mile off), that doesn't necessarily make for a bad movie; if there had been anything before that to offset it. There was certainly enough of a chance for that to happen, with so much starpower here, but everyone comes off flat and uninspiring. I normally like John Savage in just about anything, but even he couldn't save this one. Elisabeth Moss gets a lot of screen time, and she's gorgeous, but that's about the only thing I can say to recommend this. **",1246233600,17,1969,4.785294117647059

At the end, when you find out what the reason is, there is yet another sub plot stuck in, just to confuse the hell out of you some more.

This lowered the movie from very good to just like. There were also some cheap effects going on like the Wicca symbols that suddenly appeared in the attic. Really? Florescent paint under a  strobe/black light? I felt like I'd been transported back to the 70's.

I found the writing to be the ""biggest looser"" in this movie because the story doesn't really go anywhere and when it does at the end you have been waiting throughout the entire movie for it and other things to happen. As I mentioned before it starts our fast for a good setup, but then meanders along until the end and along with Moss's affliction that doesn't make much sense to me considering what was going on in the house?
The production values were quite nice except for some acting, direction and again the writing for a movie in this genre and helps this rate 2 stars instead of 1 star.

3238701,4,B000XJD30W,like the film a lot. the movie itself isn't as scary as I'd thought it to be.. Wasn't scary at all. More of a psychological thriller..,1378425600,2,134,4.1923076923076925
3238702,1,B000XJD30W,"I watched this movie on Fearnet.  Yes.  It is horrible, but I love the part where Emma's psychologist is talking to her in her room about if she'll ever get better.  He tells her thats her choice if she wants to get better.. which she replies ""Who the hell do you think you are?  How dare you.  How dare you!  You listen to me you smug bastard.  Do you think I want to see these things? Do you think I want to be in this house?  Dont come in here with that smug look on your face and tell me I have a choice.""

3238703,4,B000XJD30W,I would definitely recommend The Attic. It's a great movie. It will keep you suspenseful throughout until the end. You won't believe the ending.,1327622400,,144,5.041666666666667
3238704,1,B000XJD30W,"After moving into her family's new home, a college student Emma (Elisabeth Moss) starts seeing things. Apparently all these spooky images have something to do with herself and her father (John Savage). Terrified Emma refuses to go out, feeling that she is gradually losing sanity while her only hope is John Trevor (Jason Lewis), a local detective and possible love interest who offers his help to unravel the mystery and end her plight.

The plot of ""The Attic"" may look pretty nice, but the end result is just horrible, absolute mess that you will regret spending your time watching. Characters behave illogically with lots of overacting that is not fun to watch. Poorly written and edited, the film is not scary at all, not a single moment. There are even several major plot holes that actors are desperately trying to ignore.

The film is directed by Mary Lambert, best known as director of Stephen King horror ""Pet Sematary."" It was 20 years ago, and though the film is not a classic, it is still mildly entertaining. Now she made ""The Attic,"" a plodding and confusing horror film that is devoid of scares, even unintentional laughs. My advice: Avoid this one.",1272758400,2,1165,4.82
3238705,2,B000XJD30W,"The Attic (Mary Lambert, 2008)

This is another one of those movies with endless promise that failed completely in the execution. Lambert (The In Crowd) gathered together a sterling cast and presented them with a script (by Tom Malloy, also responsible for The Alphabet Killer, co-written with Robert M. Reitano, an Emmy-winning editor) that desperately needed another few rewrites.

In this one, Emma (Elisabeth Moss from TV's Mad Men) and her family--father Graham (John Savage), mother Kim (Catherine Mary Stuart), and mentally challenged brother Frankie (Love 'n Dancing's Tom Malloy)--have moved out to the country. Emma hasn't left the house since the move. Part of it seems to stem from agoraphobia (one of the places the script could have used a bit of work was in illustrating this better), and the other part from an encounter she had in the attic; when exploring, she uncovered a mirror that seemed to show her not a reflection of herself, but an entirely different person who looks exactly like her. Her inability to leave the house handicaps her when it comes to investigating, which becomes necessary when weird things start happening, but she finds a tenuous ally in a local detective, John Trevor (Sex and the City's Jason Lewis). Together, the two of them have to find out what the deal is with Emma's supposed twin before the twin comes for her family, and for Emma herself.

While the ending is pretty predictable (and the plot twist in the final scene you should be able to see coming from a mile off), that doesn't necessarily make for a bad movie; if there had been anything before that to offset it. There was certainly enough of a chance for that to happen, with so much starpower here, but everyone comes off flat and uninspiring. I normally like John Savage in just about anything, but even he couldn't save this one. Elisabeth Moss gets a lot of screen time, and she's gorgeous, but that's about the only thing I can say to recommend this. **",1246233600,17,1969,4.785294117647059

Hideous performances, hideous dialogue, hideous plot and a nonsensical twist at the end all combine to make such an epic pile of garbage I'd really like to see a ""Making of..."" about it.  I want a postmortem on this thing: how did it happen?  How can we prevent such things in the future?

8228528,4,B000XJD30W,"I see some pretty raw reviews of The Attic.  This must prove I'm a movie dunce.  Reviews are all according to opinion.  In my opinion, the movie is captivating.  There's pure horror in who's who, among the characters.  Admittedly, the plot is a little slow as various therapists, a psychic and several seem to help her but are not.  You'll wonder why someone doesn't realize what's going on and help Emma, the main character.  Nevertheless, I got that sick feeling in my gut, as this is truly a creepy movie.  Nobody is loyal to Emma, you'll realize.  In the very end is an unexpected twist.  As a ""movie dunce,"" I give it four stars.  There's no bad acting in any character.  The plot is a little strange.  I'll watch it again.",1499472000,,728,4.465648854961832

8228530,1,B000XJD30W,Ten minutes into the movie and I straight up thought I was watching a porno. The actors delivered every single one of their lines in a weirdly sexual fashion and I was just waiting for the weird sex stuff to happen. Really disappointing...,1489276800,,239,4.5813953488372094

Seems to be some chick, who sees another chick who hasn't slept well, then chick 1 falls over in Charlie Chaplin fashion, smacking her head on something every time, then we do the round of ""gay guy playing a cop-badly"" then ""doctor who looks like a homeless guy"" then ""obnoxious parents"" then ""therapist-also homeless meth-head"" then ""Rain Man rip-off brother""... and round and round it goes. Its meaningless; camerawork is bad; effects are laughable; much of the acting is terrible (though not all) and I think its kinda old - saw an old style CRT tv in there, they haven't been around for a while now. The utter and complete lack of even the most fleeting and trivial ""creepy"" moment in the entire thing has to mean Avoid At All Costs... not even worth it as part of Prime!",1488153600,2,866,4.487341772151899
