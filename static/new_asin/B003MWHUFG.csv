4156272,4,B003MWHUFG,"For more than a quarter-century, during the halcyon days of radio and early television, actress-playwright Gertrude Berg ruled the airwaves as Molly Goldberg, a kindly Jewish mother dispensing homespun wisdom to her family and neighbors in the Bronx. Berg told Edward R. Murrow that she spent more time as Molly Goldberg than she did as Gertrude Berg, and this was the plain truth: she wrote, produced and starred in more than 5,000 episodes of ""The Goldbergs,"" making her one of the true creative dynamos of American entertainment history. At the peak of her fame, Berg was second in the public trust only to Eleanor Roosevelt. Unfortunately, the blacklist damaged her career, and destroyed that of her co-star, Philip Loeb, who subsequently committed suicide. Also, the poor picture quality and erratic distibution of the kinescopes of ""The Goldbergs"" guaranteed that Molly Goldberg wouldn't remain a household name, as Lucy Ricardo and Ralph Kramden did.

""Yoo-Hoo, Mrs. Goldberg!"", Aviva Kempner's fascinating and touching documentary, reclaims the story of Molly Goldberg and her creator for modern audiences. Along with vintage clips from the radio and TV programs, Kempner presents interviews with Ruth Bader Ginsberg, Norman Lear, Susan Stamberg and other luminaries who testify to their love of Molly Goldberg and the importance of having a radio and TV character who reflected the reality of their own lives. ""Yoo-Hoo, Mrs. Goldberg!"" is an apt tribute to an unjustly forgotten pioneer of situation comedy.",1257379200,33,1516,5.343096234309623
4156273,3,B003MWHUFG,"An interesting niche film primarily for nostalgia buffs with a strong emphasis on the 1950's and the birth of modern television. Because it is comprised essentially of film clips and interviews, it is a little draggy at times. There is a socio-political component as well-- with a through account of the Jewish-American immigration experience, Jewish humor, McCarthyism, feminism, etc.  The creator of this film is apparently undergoing some of the financial stresses of production, so if you do decide to view it in a theater, you will be supporting her efforts.",1251331200,11,563,5.186813186813187
4156274,5,B003MWHUFG,"I loved every minute of it.  I watched the show as a little girl.  It was historically precious, and a fascinating view of a truly incredible woman.  A very valuable tribute. So glad I saw it. Passed it on to my daughter and her husband.",1369785600,3,237,4.222222222222222
4156275,5,B003MWHUFG,"...but you do have to appreciate the child-of-immigrant-parents' struggle to educate herself, to find her voice as an author, to plug her radio scripts to NBC, and to portray her people, always in a positive light, despite the rampant anti-semitism of the time.

Gertrude Berg is revealed here as someone of enormous energy, drive and creativity. Despite her immigrant roots and the racial prejudice against her fellow Jews, she managed to write and act in her own radio show based on her fictitious family, the Goldbergs. They faced assimilation problems typical of all immigrant families of the period who were seeking, and finding, the American Dream. What a concept! Too bad Molly's brand of patriotism can't be taught to all immigrant families who currently struggle with their identities as Americans. Berg's view of Jewish immigrant life in the Bronx circa 1930 through 1955 revealed these new citizens to be 100% American through and through.

This film was enlightening, interesting and above all entertaining. I enjoyed watching it a second time with the director's commentary turned on. Don't miss this look at a broadcasting pioneer; you'll be calling 'yoo hoo' to your own neighbors.",1362182400,4,1196,5.191709844559585

4156282,3,B003MWHUFG,"I have a question for anyone who don't mind answering it.  Here is my question.
I ordered The Goldbergs ((2DVD Pack) and absolutely give it a great big 5!  It runs 262 mins and I get 2 in a pack for only $6.00 and change.  The other DVD  is only 92 mins long and you get a single DVD and it costs $19.00 . Are the episodes in the 92 mins (short) worth the money and are they as hilarious as the $6.00 for 262 mins long?

During these days of recession , I am trying my best to shop wisely, something I have had to learn to do.  I will be grateful to anyone who has ordered BOTH and can give me an opinion.

Tk You So Very Much

4156283,5,B003MWHUFG,"You don't have to be Jewish to love ""The Goldbergs.""  This film is a simply wonderful documentary about a self-made Jewish woman (whose real name is Gertrude Berg) who - through force of personality and hard work - stormed into the radio business in the 1930's and then persuaded the producers to allow her to make the first TV family ""sitcom"" before ""I Love Lucy"" or ""The Cosby's.  Gertrude Berg invented the genre and was the queen of television for years.  The movie includes quite a few clips of some of her actual episodes;  Many will be curious to see the TV shows in full. (Now that is possible with a new DVD collection). My best friend who grew up in the 1940's opined that this was his favorite television program.  Perhaps Gertrude Berg will get her much deserved re-recognition  in the 21st century.  I was terribly impressed that Gertrude Berg wrote a new TV episode EVERY NIGHT, then directed her co-actors in the morning, became the leading star, and then completed filming that episode in the afternoon.  Then, in the remaining hours of the same day she wrote her next episode and did this thousands of times.  Let's face it...that is a brilliant accomplishment that no one - male or woman - has ever matched!

What made the TV show so interesting is that Molly bridged two worlds - between the old immigrant way of life and the New World of American consumerism;  All along, she retained those important family values of honest work and community compassion.  Why did the TV show go out of fashion?  Did the New Americans merge into mainstream culture so completely that old time values became less interesting on television?

The documentary is also important for its frank discussion of blacklisting. The television husband of Molly Goldberg took his own life when he was not allowed to work any longer during the McCarthy witch hunting years.

I would not miss this film! Another documentary by the same director is the critically acclaimed ""Life and Times of Hank Greenberg"".  He was a very important athlete who broke racial barriers in professional baseball for the Jews but is much less known than Jackie Robinson who did the same for African Americans.  Last, but not least, for those who like Jewish cooking, don't forget to buy [on Amazon] a copy of ""The Molly Goldberg Jewish cookbook"", a volume that recreates those delicious Jewish recipes of the 1930s - 1950's.",1276905600,21,2392,4.766990291262136
8400518,5,B003MWHUFG,"Wonderful piece of history and an amazing woman - creative, powerful and intelligent. She impacted EVERYONE who has ever watched a TV sitcom or listened to the radio.

8400519,5,B003MWHUFG,"I won't rehash most of what has been written about this terrific film already, but there are some things I would have liked to have learned about from the filmmaker.

For example, the audience gets to see Gertrude Berg's grandson and granddaughter both being interviewed, but what happened to Berg's actual son and daughter? Had they passed away? Did they decline to be interviewed?

Another point not mentioned was that the FBI cleared Philip Loeb's communistic attack as false. His reputation was cleared not long after Loeb committed suicide. Why was that not included in the film?

I also found it surprising that there was NO mention of a Broadway musical starring Kaye Ballard called MOLLY which also featured Eli Mintz once again playing Uncle David. The musical ran on the Broadway stage at the Alvin Theater beginning September 27th for 40 previews to its opening on November 1st in 1973 for a total of 68 performances, later closing on December 29th. I know it may not be a lot of performances, but it is certainly worth mentioning.

I actually wanted to recommend to viewers to take the time to watch the film twice: once by itself and once with the audio commentary by Aviva Kempner, the filmmaker. It is filled with much information that added to my appreciation and enjoyment of learning about The Goldbergs and about Gertrude Berg.",1512950400,,1346,4.839130434782609

This satisfies my nightly Molly Fix..  I am mesmerized by her nuances and those of the cast.  She has only been dead 50 years!!!!! but it is timeless and better than Lucy.
