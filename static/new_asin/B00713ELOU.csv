great cameo by Jason Bateman makes it great for the parents too. Has some scenes from the TV series but mostly new stuff great flick i would recommend to anyone who likes this series",1362009600,,218,4.317073170731708
5046597,5,B00713ELOU,"Was what we were expecting.  Was ideal for the child
we purchased it for.  The shipping was timely and we
did receive it with no damage or returns necessary.
Thank you.",1357257600,,168,4.387096774193548
5046598,5,B00713ELOU,"Kiddo loves it, as she loves all Gabba stuff - and it doesn't get as annoying as Dora or Blue's Clues.",1357084800,,102,3.9047619047619047
5046599,2,B00713ELOU,"My kids love this dvd but I have a couple gripes. First, the Gabba DVD's that are released all the time only have 4 episodes. That's not bad, but when you are spending $10-$15 or more per dvd for every 4 episodes it adds up. It does make you feel like you are being nickel and dimed for each and every episode and that's why I am giving this dvd release 2 stars

Yo Gabba Gabba is now on its 4th season but we have not yet seen a single season released as a whole in the US. This is very frustrating. This is probably because of Nick and not the fault of the maker's of the show, but they should know that we parents are waiting ever so patiently for full seasons to purchase (even those of us who already own the dvd's trust me)

Not only that, but another HUGE issue is that parents like me who have Gabba on tv several several hours a day appreciate watching it in HD as it is a LOT easier on the eyes. Right now if you want to watch it in HD you have two options:

1. Record it on your DVR the day a new episode premiers on Nick (not Nick Jr. which is SD only and does not premiere the new episodes in HD). They will only air new episodes ONCE on Nick in HD and if you miss it guess what too bad. I wish they would air more on Nick instead of shows like Spongebob being on 24/7 on that channel but that's another issue for another day

2. Stream it/purchase it in HD. Netflix seems to be the best option for streaming HD episodes. Season 1 is not available in HD anywhere you look for it so beware of that first of all. Seasons 2 & 3 are available in HD on Netfilx which is wonderful but goes against your internet monthly data caps everytime you stream an episode which is NOT wonderful lol. You can purchase episodes in HD on your Xbox/Roku from Vudu etc. BUT THEY ARE EXPENSIVE ESPECIALLY IN HD! Not only that, but you will come across another problem which is that only certain episodes for certain providers are available for purchase in HD. So even if you wanted to purchase in HD the whole of season 2 or season 3 certain episodes of those seasons WILL NOT be in HD

So please, if anyone important is reading this, please do 2 things: First release full seasons of the show on disc. Secondly, Release them in HD (even season 1) on bluray format, and don't wait until my kids are too old to care to do so

My family loves Gabba so keep on making new episodes and releasing new content! Thanks",1344211200,15,2402,4.089171974522293

5046602,4,B00713ELOU,"This DVD contains four episodes of Yo Gabba Gabba. The first is a new one called ""Super Spies,"" and, as a parent of a child who loves YGG, I was pretty thrilled to see some new content (I am sure she was too)! The other three episodes are older-- ""Mystery,"" ""Space"" and ""Big."" The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five is because I really had hoped for more new material, or a longer episode.",1335484800,17,405,4.205128205128205

5046607,5,B00713ELOU,"I love Yo Gabba Gabba. I wish the program was more widely available. It was on Netflix and we watched it all the time. The toys and the party gear are hard to find. The clothes are extremely hard to find, and even if you have Amazon Prime you still have to pay for episodes. My wish would be for all the seasons to be available on DVD, but until then, we will settle for these compilation DVDs to sing along with the Yo Gabba Gabba gang we love so dearly.",1465344000,,455,4.010989010989011
