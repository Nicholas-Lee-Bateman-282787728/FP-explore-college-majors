5970518,3,B00F8LQ64A,"There have been so many versions of Abel Gance's masterpiece. And it's not a film that's conducive to television (even wide screen TV, although that's better). This is because although most of the film is a silent film aspect ratio such as 1:1.37, the last reel opens up to an image of three screens side by side (so instead of the screen tripling in size as it would, impressively, at a theatrical presentation, the image would have to compress at the top and bottom and get smaller, suddenly, to accommodate the extra width.

That said, I would still buy a DVD or (better) Blu-Ray of the fullest version possible, if only it was available. British film historian and restorer Kevin Brownlow (my hero) has spent most of his career reconstructing the ""complete"" Gance version of the film, occasionally releasing a version more complete than the last version he had reconstructed. The first one I saw was finished in 1973 and I saw it at the American Film Institute. But I was one of the really lucky people, who saw the final version Brownlow signed off on. It played ONLY in Oakland, California, where the historic, art deco theater, The Paramount, was able to accommodate not only the orchestra, which played Carl Davis's stirring musical score live (conducted by the composer) but also two additional screens which were built specifically for the final reel. The marathon screening lasted all day, with a morning short break, a lunch break, and an afternoon short break -- in other words, in four parts, each running 90 minutes or more.

All of this means that there are obstacles to putting this out on home video, certainly, but I still have my fingers crossed that it will eventually happen. I wouldn't bother with this (current) version or any other version than this final Brownlow one, with score by Carl Davis. If it was really treated royally -- say by Criterion Collection or Masters of Cinema -- there would be extras, interviews, variant scenes . . . not to mention the beautiful visual quality of the restored print I saw in Oakland. A guy can dream, can't he?

In short, if you really really need to see it, you COULD watch this version, but know you are only seeing a fraction of the film, and probably with an inferior musical soundtrack and picture quality. NAPOLEON really is one of the great cinematic achievements of all time and should be seen right. Or at least as close to ""right"" as it can be on a home television screen.",1394409600,37,2447,4.686046511627907

I own the LaserDisc version and live in HK. I have seen poor quality Chinese Video CDs - 1990s technology. They are better.
Every scene in which there is any fast movement or action degenerates into a set of poorly resolved blocks of digital noise. And this in a black and white film.
I could do far better myself.
The engineering of the transfers is incompetent.
This should not be on sale.
Perhaps the Coppolas will reissue their version, weak though it is, to avoid it being sucked down by this Korean failure.",1361664000,26,719,4.538461538461538

I first saw this movie on TCM turner classic movies w/Coppola score. For whatever reason (greed usually)) this movie and especially this version of the movie has NOT been available to anybody in the world except in KOREA!! Lucky them! It was available as VHS or lASERdisc. Fear not they have ENGLISH subtitles in the top menu to replace the automatic Korean subtitles. I suppose if you prefer to go without subtitles it's a minor perturbance. I prefer subtitles so it's perfect for me. Anyways, this is a Korean Release with the magnificent  Coppola soundtrack (albeit in mono) - which is the preferred perfect to the new score that has been performed only live to an extended cut of the film- performed only 4? times in San Fransisco last year. It costs supposedly 800,000 dollars for the orchestra. Well save your money BROWNLOW and Mix the damn music to DTS-MA or Dolby ATMOS. It is criminal to withhold this film from ""the masses"". The battle to release this film has everything to do with the soundtrack /score battle. This movie - a consensus 5 star film is the stuff of legends and is being taught at film schools at this moment.
I for one am glad that this never made it to DVDs. This is a release that warrants BLU-RAY with 12 soundtracks. (Surround /stereo/commentary tracks for 2 different scores)
The default should be in DTS-MA Coppola then the ""new"" version by Carl Davis which is good unto itself  should be second or produced on a separate Bluray. What compulsed the film restoration guru Kevin Brownlow to replace an already great score is beyond me except for being petty or greedy. WHY has he kept this film from BLURAY?????",1360454400,8,1859,5.210702341137123

5970529,1,B00F8LQ64A,"Firstly - no-one can dispute the greatness of this movie, and that clearly deserves 5 stars.  However, this DVD is sadly not the way to see it.  It is a copy of the old Laserdisc version, and therefore you have a film of almost 4 hours long not even filling a single, single-layer disc (DVD5)!  The digital artifacts are sometimes dreadful (the image gets extremely 'blocky' during some of the sections with lots of motion (the early snowball fight being a good example).

On a more serious note, this Korean DVD version is actually a bootleg - the company (Premier) do not have the rights to distribute the film.  I used to sell this DVD on ebay, but was  then informed by none other than Robert A Harris (responsible for restoration of Vertigo and Lawrence of Arabia among other films) that the DVD is an illegal copy.  The American authorities are currently trying to take steps to stop this Korean company from producing this DVD.

If you are desperate to see this film, buy yourself a multi-region DVD player (you won't regret it!), and track down the Australian DVD (Region 4, PAL) or Spanish DVD (Region 2, PAL).",1144800000,,1119,4.616161616161616
5970530,2,B00F8LQ64A,"As has been said before on this page, this is one of the greatest films in history.  Reconstructed by Kevin Brownlow  [he wrote an interesting book on the subject] and cut down to the current length for the Coppola release in the US[the score on this disc is the U.S. score by Carmine Coppola].  Brownlow's restoration has, apparently been superseded by an even longer French restoration, but even the Coppola release is a must see masterpiece.  At least it should be.  This DVD appears to be taken from the Image laserdisc version which was released back in the 80s. The transfer is mediocre the image detail fuzzy the sound muddy. The oversall quality is that of a VHS tape].  Sure the movie is 80 years old, but if you look at other silents of that age [e.g. Brownlow's restoration of Ben Hur on the 3 disc special edition; the current edition of the original Ten Commandments; the Image DVD of Intolerance] you will see how good a DVD presentation of an old film can look even if the materials are not perfect. Someone Criterion? Image? needs to do a proper transfer from good film materials with a proper 16:9 transfer of the triptich sequence.",1144540800,,1149,4.607843137254902
5970531,3,B00F8LQ64A,"Napoleon (1927) is my all time favorite movie. It must be seen to be believed. In 1926-27 french director Abel Gance put together a film which for it's time was a incredible piece of film making. He wanted not only for the viewer to watch the film but to experience it like never before. He experimented with everything. He would put cameras all over the place for effect, and also use multi images which were superimposed over one another. He filmed parts of the movie in technicolor, parts of it in 3D(for which footage is said to still exist to this day in the vaults in Paris), and with stereo sound, all which was unheard of in 1927. He was the first director to use a widescreen process (30 years before Cinerama even existed). This movie was originally 8 hours long. Gance over the years edited, cut, and shortened the film. It was considered lost until a reconstruction took place in 1981. The current version of the film is around 226 minutes long. There was another reconstructed version clocked in around 5 1/2 hours long that was shown in 2000 in France. The 226 minute version of the film is only available in Australia, and South Korea(222 minutes) on dvd. If it will ever be released in America on dvd is unknown. Movie director Francis Ford Coppola has ownership rights to the film and for some reason or another has not allowed a dvd release in America as yet. This is a film that must be handled correctly for a appropriate dvd release. Much more footage has been found (since 1981) and much of it is in better condition than in this 1981 version. I am still happy that at least it is on dvd at present. For now the Australian dvd is preferred over the South Korean dvd for a couple of reasons. First the picture quality is better on the Australian dvd. Second it is shown at the correct speed. The picture quality and speed of the presentation on the South Korean dvd is terrible. However, the Austrailian dvd is in the PAL format so it cannot be played on a US dvd region 1 player. You can view it on a PC with a dvd rom if you wish but a film with this magnatude and epic proportions should be shown on the biggest screen possible for full effect. The South Korean version is the only way to view this film on a US dvd player because the dvd is region free and in NTSC format. So in closing hopefully this movie will get a full restoration (5-8 hours) in the near future(I hope), and will be available to one and all to be watched in all it's full glory.",1138579200,4,2475,4.347732181425486
5970532,5,B00F8LQ64A,"We all know that this is a great movie, a major milestone in the history of moviemaking. I would like to comment on the DVD quality.  We should be greatful that this movie is available on DVD at all. Korean edition is the only one available at present in NTSC format. The only other one is the Australian edition (PAL, region 3). I have seen both of them and they are very similar. Let's not forget that this movie is almost 80 years old and unless a major restoration is undertaken (by Criterion, for example), we should not be complaining. The quality is not that bad. It did not interfere with my enjoyment of this masterpiece.",1136678400,2,630,4.431034482758621
5970533,5,B00F8LQ64A,"A grand epic, almost 4 hours in length, that is virtually a history of the cinema up to that point in time. Written and directed by Frenchman Abel Gance, the movie traces Napolean's rise from school boy to the success of the Italian campaigns. (Gance thought of this as only the first part of a six-part production, but the other 5 parts were never made.)

Every technique known to movie makers is incorporated in this picture: quick cutting, multi screens (his use of the three-panel screen augurs cinerama), tinting, montage; the camera is alive in action - always moving. The scenes are breathtaking, whether whirling around the dancers (some partially naked) at a ball, or on a battlefield, or during the famous snowball fight at the picture's beginning, or in a small boat at sea - we feel a part of every scene. Cameras were mounted on horses to capture exactly what a rider would see and feel, and in one scene he put a tiny camera inside a soccer ball and hurled it to similate a cannonball.

We are almost mesmerized by what we see unfolding before our eyes. The full orchestra score, composed in 1981, is also excellent and adds immensely to the power of the screen images. (This is the only movie ever shown in the French Opera House in Paris.) The movie is a beacon for what cinema could do and be, a unique and separate art form (similar to what CITIZEN KANE did for the sound period). Brilliant and a true masterpiece.",1133222400,,1432,4.5680933852140075

8613076,4,B00F8LQ64A,"So sorry there are so many games played regarding this film. Certainly I wanted this Blu-ray 5.5 hour version with all the commentaries. But the version available does not play on standard U.S. players, and I was not about to buy a region free player then pop $75 for this film. Since I had a laser player I got the very decent laser disc with the score of Carmine Coppola; not blu-ray quality but much better than VHS and many DVDs. Well done film and quite innovative given that it is a silent film. But it is disappointing in that it covers Napoleons life only through 1797 missing the most important part of his life. it should have been called YOUNG NAPOLEON. Four hours is plenty given it missed the meat of his sordid career.",1513728000,,732,4.42962962962963
8613077,5,B00F8LQ64A,". . . was for a multi-region dvd player I purchased (here), solely to watch the BFI (4) dvd set of Napoleon I ordered from AmazonUK ($27 there).

The restoration: brilliant, groundbreaking, magnificent, epic. ALL the accolades are warranted. I just completed my first watch, and look forward to the next 5.5 hrs time investment. A few notes:
- one must first go to 'set-up' and choose audio in order to hear score. Not that big of deal (though some have found it to be!);
- Unless one understands the significance of this film, one will not appreciate a 5+ hour s i l e n t film. I suggest showing 'Act 4' (the last 58 min.) to
  the uninitiated. With just a smattering of their 'host's' narrative, this final act can suffice as a primer as to what makes this film (and its director) so
  splendid, including the lightning-fast edits, in-camera special effects, and of course the amazing triptych sequence;
- don't get hung up on the 4:1 triptych 'size': as soon as the intertitle shrinks, pause the dvd and move your chair real close to your TV. It does work!
- extras are a bit limited, but substantial. Fascinating to see/hear the master himself in Brownlow's '68 ""Charm of Dynamite"". Take note of comments RE: lost footage, and the condition of the clips shown: makes one truly appreciate living in this age (and then being able to OWN a copy of such a masterwork). Carl Davis' interview also quite interesting, RE: score sources, own compositions, and live conducting. 32 pp. booklet. A nice video collection of stills and special collections (incl. original program, in French and English). Assorted triptych options (to view singularly, and includes alternative single-screen ending). Will at some point watch film with Paul Cuff commentary.
Final take: an absolute treasure, more than worth the price of a new multi-region player. I disdain the attitude of some to treat as rubbish earlier releases of dvds; however, my bootleg Korean copy I will not be revisiting. The BFI is truly stellar, and since one cannot have it released in this country('s Region 1/A), one SHOULD go elsewhere to procure their copy.

Stunning - no other word for it - absolutely stunning! And for those film buffs, the cinematography is ground breaking.

Seems many films nowadays rely on CGI and story lines that have already been done - what I love about silent films is how much work went into capturing someone's vision, especially given that it was such a new medium.

Every aspect of this film was the mark of genius - nothing was overlooked or half done; everything worked in tandem.
