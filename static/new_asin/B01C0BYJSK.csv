8752017,5,B01C0BYJSK,Yes. And Yes Again in so many ways... at almost 70 I appreciate it in so many ways but because it's ageless depth I sent it on to a 20-something good person as he begins his own journey: a caring gift if only if about planting trees is understood..,1496793600,,248,4.081632653061225

8752023,5,B01C0BYJSK,"I saw this film at a film festival and was deeply moved - by W.S. Merwin's poetry and also his choices in life. The fact that he's been planting a tree every day for over 40 years, and now cares for one of the largest private collections of palms in the world is remarkable. The film will speak to anyone with an interest in poetry, environmentalism, Buddhism, the creative process, how to live a moral life... I can't recommend it highly enough!",1461715200,18,446,4.451219512195122
