2322597,5,B0009UVCKS,This really goes into what REALLY happens to the pit-bull breeds here in america and other places. I bet if more people knew what was happening to this lovable & loyal breed they'd think twice about their witch hunting. It was so horrible seeign the photos and footage of people fighting & abusing these dogs. They even hooked up a losing dogs to jumper cables!! These kinds of people need to be stopped!,1186876800,11,404,4.5479452054794525
2322598,1,B0009UVCKS,"I haven't seen this, so I can't properly review it. But since this actually appeals to people with compassion and empathy, I wanted to point out that one can also buy items PROMOTING animal fighting on Amazon. Please don't shop here if you care about animals at all!",1183420800,29,266,4.5625
2322599,5,B0009UVCKS,"As an owner of two rescued pitbulls I really liked this documentary.  First of all, it shows how pointless breed bans are when you have people that abuse and use these dogs swearing they will NEVER stop even if the breed is banned demonstrating the people who own this breed for ill intentions are often criminals anyways.  The cruelty these animals suffer is immense.  As a person well-versed in the reputation these dogs gotten I wish they would have spent at least a few minutes discussing what is one of the biggest problems facing this breed--overbreeding and poor breeding.  This produces unsound animals (physically and mentally) and bad breeders place these dogs in the worst and most irresponsible hands thus making them a danger to the community.  This has a much greater effect on society and on dog owners than the underground world of dogfighting.  Overall, it is a great film.",1170979200,6,890,4.860927152317881
2322600,4,B0009UVCKS,I bought this movie thinking there was going to be a lot more positive info than there was. Need less to say I was shocked when I started watching this movie. My boyfriend and his friend could not watch the movie they got up and left. I made it through the hole thing dispite my crying. I knew that fighting went on but knowing about it and seeing it is two differnet things. This movie is not for the weak it definitely made me love my American Pit Bull Terrier more than I all ready do. Also made me appreciate the breed more than I all ready do.,1159315200,10,548,4.083333333333333
2322601,5,B0009UVCKS,"I believe every person who owns a pitbull or is remotely interested in the breed owes it to themselves to see this movie. It's a ballsy look at the inhumanities of this evil ""sport"". It's made me love and understand my dog's nature even more!",1153785600,9,242,4.4
2322602,3,B0009UVCKS,"The video would be educational to a novice audience, but anybody experienced with the apbt would have know most of the information provided. On the other hand the film was an eye-opener and was very descriptive in showing the ignorance of the supposed ""Dog-Men""  of the world, and their overall abuse of a beloved breed of dog.  Overall a good documentary, and would suggest it to anyone wanting to better understand why the breed has been frowned upon and the people that make that possible. Definately for an older audience.",1140220800,17,526,4.833333333333333
2322603,5,B0009UVCKS,"Please watch this documentary. It is very powerful explaining how it is the humans on the other end of the heavy chain that causes the aggression in these poor dogs. ANY dog can bite, people have to stop being racist and learn the truth behind the problems, this video shows you that we are our own worst enemy. I adopted my dog from a shelter. She was used in fights as she has scars on her face, puncture marks on her legs but despite her horrid treatment, she still loves everyone. If my Pitbull can forgive why can't we?",1136419200,25,524,4.303030303030303
2322604,5,B0009UVCKS,This movie is an extraordinary documentary about the underground world of the American Pitbull Terrier and it shows why we have so many aggressive pitbulls not because of the breed but because of the owner and nobody else.,1127606400,16,222,4.868421052631579
2322605,5,B0009UVCKS,"This film was very well done, and while there are scenes where you see parts of actual dog-fights and other graphic images, the majority of the film consists of moving interviews with animal care experts and revolting interviews with actual dog-fighters.  Clips of the dogs they claim to love so much being viciously attacked and torn apart in the bloody pit clearly demonstrates their lack of compassion and makes one wonder what kind of person ""loves"" their animals in this way.  You will watch in disbelief as these men swear they love these animals, and in the same breath make it perfectly clear that when a dog stops winning, that dog is killed  - there is room only for winners in the pit.  This movie is a heartwrenching eye-opener to those less familiar with the cruel and bloody sport of dog-fighting, and sheds much needed light on how commonplace this brutal activity is.",1125619200,55,883,4.751633986928105
2322606,5,B0009UVCKS,Did not realize until this video that pit bulls was once a popular family pet. Shame on the ones that ruined the good reputation the pits once had by turning them into fighting machines.,1375660800,,186,4.5
2322607,5,B0009UVCKS,"This movie gives the history of the pit bull, what it is capable of, and what it could be like in a loving home !",1364515200,,113,3.56
2322608,5,B0009UVCKS,An inside look at dog fighting by the actual pit masters perspective. It's interesting to see what is going through their heads to actually justify their actions with the dogs.,1364428800,,176,4.9
2322609,3,B0009UVCKS,I hate people like that and I wish someone will stop them. Who would want to do that to such a beautifull,1360713600,,105,3.8181818181818183
2322610,5,B0009UVCKS,"This documentary was astonishingly eye-opening and heartbreaking.  It painted a brutally frank picture of dog fighting, and was very difficult to watch at times.  Now I am trying to figure out how to get as many more people as possible to watch it.

It is going to take videos like this, to open people's eyes to the horrific abuse these dogs endure, and to get it into people's heads, that these dogs are VICTIMS, not monsters.

Many thanks to the folks who went to the trouble to put this together, and to everyone who took the time to watch it.",1360713600,,547,4.44
2322611,4,B0009UVCKS,This provided me some insights into the culture of dog fighting and what pit bulls have endured.  Not a Disney movie.,1359849600,,117,4.571428571428571
2322612,5,B0009UVCKS,"Despite what the 1-star reviewers have to say about this movie without having first watched it, this is an extremely EDUCATIONAL movie! It is pretty cool how both sides of the dog-fighting world are represented. It was interesting to hear from an actual ""dog-fighter"" & how that horrible underground world works. I think everyone should have to watch this movie & THEN maybe something more will be done to end this epidemic that plagues our beautiful Pitbull dogs that we know & love :)",1357084800,,486,4.7976190476190474
2322613,5,B0009UVCKS,"This is an INTENSE DVD...  SO glad I ordered it.  I am a hard-core pit bull aficionado, however.  This has some seriously disturbing footage; super educational, even if you are already very educated about the breed.  Loved it.  Glad I bought it; and it came right away.",1308528000,,269,4.638297872340425
2322614,4,B0009UVCKS,"I first watched this in my Animal Control training class for animal cruelty.  As a long time Pit Bull advocate; it was a look into the mind of a dog fighter.  I think it showed some good footage of the people involved and how the animals are treated if they don't win.  For the people who claim to love their fighting dogs, they have a wierd way of showing their love when killing their dog for losing.  I think the public should be exposed to the realities of animal cruelty and fighting is but one way.",1269302400,,504,4.21875
2322615,4,B0009UVCKS,"Good documentary - only 60 min long. Would be interesting to address other issues associated with dogfighting, such as the link to domestic violence or narcotics/weapons trafficking.",1257724800,,182,5.777777777777778
2322626,1,B0009UVCKS,"I encourage all of you reading this review to do as I have done and quit buying from Amazon.com.  Until Amazon stops selling materials where animals are tortured and killed, responsible citizens will go elsewhere to do their business.",1231459200,6,234,5.0
2322627,5,B0009UVCKS,"I recommend this for all dog lovers (over 14) and all Pit bull owners. This is one of the reasons our dogs get such a bad rap. Be prepared though, this DVD is intense and not for those who are weak stomached. I have watched it three times and i recommend it to everyone who I talk to when i take my pits to public venues. It is harsh, but it is happening. It is going on in our society and we need to puch for this to become a thing of the past.",1231200000,2,445,3.74468085106383
2322628,5,B0009UVCKS,"First of all, let me just say: This movie does NOT promote dog fighting and does NOT encourage anyone to engage in this illegal activity. If you have not seen this film then please do not comment solely based upon the title and Amazon's description of the film.

I watched this video knowing fully what I was in for, i.e an education about the horrors of dog fighting. I watched it because at the time I was a police officer that very often dealt with animal abuse cases and I wanted to familiarize myself with signs of animal fighting for potential arrest and prosecution. There are very graphic scenes of dog fighting, the murder of the fighting dogs by losing owners, and actual interview accounts by fighting dog owners about this sick thing they have the audacity to call a ""sport"". What a lot of reviewers that bemoan this film neglect to say is that the movie is not only about dog fighting. A very large portion of the movie actually casts an incredibly positive light on the American Pit Bull dog breed and shows how brave, courageous, and loved this breed of dog has been throughout the years. Several examples of this are given such as the Pit Bull has been on the cover of Time magazine (I think it was Time) in a positive way seven times, more than any other dog breed let alone animals. It also talks about how the greatest border patrol K-9 is, in fact, a Pit Bull that had been rescued from a dog fighter/breeder.

Yes, this movie does bring to light the evil horrors of dog fighting, but it also talks in depth about the efforts being made to combat dog fighting and how the mass media has painted a very incorrect view of the American Pit Bull. I think that if you work in or volunteer with any humane society or SPCA or if you work in the law enforcement field that this video should be required viewing during training. It is not pretty and I'm not ashamed to say that I found myself crying at times, but it's a hard truth that people in these fields need to be confronted with if they are going to do their jobs without any disillusions.",1231113600,28,2058,4.384816753926701
2322629,5,B0009UVCKS,"This is a well put together documentary, but can be very disturbing. I have mixed feelings about this subject, but strongly agree with most most people when I say these ""dogmen"" have no love for there dogs and are in this for the money. Men like these have ruined this sport. This DVD depicts some cruel and shocking images. With images and video of curr culling, which is something no human can condone. It goes to show that amatures and people who use there dog for fashion are cold hearted ignorant people. And are hurting the dogs more that should be allowed. I found the video of the kids fighting dogs on leashes to be the worst part. This video made me think there should he harder laws and I condone dog rolling.",1230249600,2,720,4.421052631578948
2322630,3,B0009UVCKS,"I purchased this DVD from Amazon last week and it was worth watching. It showed me what i already knew about these psychopaths who claim to love their dogs and provide them with a life of misery. As the owner of APBT's in the past and currently owning 2 that were rescued it makes you wanna get up off the couch and knock out these thugs they interview in this documentary. Both sides of the coin are presented but the case for the fighting dog owners is weak and pathetic. Its all about money and nothing else. They look at these dogs as nothing more than a bag of crack to earn them money. My wife had to turn away and couldn't watch the whole thing due to the graphic images of maimed and dead animals. Unfortunatly as the animal control and rescue people they interview state,the punishments are way to lax when they get caught and the pits just move to new locations with more ignorant,cold hearted demonic losers participating in what they call a "" sport ""...Your heart will ache for these poor dogs who have no choice but to live a life of torture...I only wish they would turn on their "" owners""",1230163200,11,1103,4.359223300970874
2322631,5,B0009UVCKS,"First, let me say that this DVD is AGAINST dog fighting. Those of you that haven't seen it and are just reviewing it because you think it's promoting dog fighting need to take a pause and have a second look. The documentary is made to educate the public on WHY dog fighting is wrong and what goes on behind the scenes. I watched it for work after my boss lent it to me (we investigate animal cruelty cases, including dog and cock fighting) and it really made me realize the importance of my job. It's really a great video and if I had a copy of my own I'd be lending it to every friend and neighbor I could so that we could STOP these crimes against animals and the detrimental effects this ""sport"" has on our society.",1228953600,5,718,4.2101449275362315
2322632,5,B0009UVCKS,"Off the chain is a in-depth look at  APBT's as a family dogs , fighting dogs, and historic dogs. The APBT is a breed mis understood by the masses, a breed given a bad rep but stupid owners and dog fighters alike. Off the Chain shows how the APBT came to be America's #1 banned breed it takes you to the pit's it shows this wonderful breed fighting for it's life and being pitted, This video awakens a whole new world of the APBT as a lover of this breed for since before i could read, It makes you realize the true ignorance of dog fighters, they say they love their dogs, that they are helping the breed and fixing it, IT makes you mad to see these so called dog men say these things and gives you a even more sense of this breeds ability to love humans so much that they are willing to fight for their lives in a pit.

2322634,4,B0009UVCKS,"This is exactly what you expect to get, a horrifying look into the world of dog fighting. The owners are ignorant to the abuse they inflict and the dogs do what they are trained to do, kill.  Some of the scenes will turn your stomach, one in particular as a 200+lbs man standing on the neck of a 30lbs dog. Not to spoil the ending for you but justice was served when they disclosed what each owner was sentenced too, mostly fines and probation. No mention of Michael Vick for you football fans.",1208304000,4,494,4.311827956989247
2322645,5,B0009UVCKS,"I was shown this video at a class while in the Police Academy... It was an eye-opener on how ""big"" is this cruel world of underground dog fighting. These supposedly ""professional dog fighters"" are completely ignorant and lack any sense of morale or compassion. Punishments on these crimes must be more severe. Imposing higher fines would be beneficial since, as you will see in the video, this is what really motivates these people. Money, as well as a sense of power they - someway - lack in their personal life... It also addresses the issue of aggressiveness in pit-bulls and dispels the myth of pit bulls being inherently ""attack-dogs"" very eloquently. The movie is very graphic and emotional... By the end of the day I had decided to get a pit bull.",1203638400,7,754,4.71969696969697
2322646,5,B0009UVCKS,"I own this dvd myself, and it is also recommended by the Humane Society of the United States as a ""must see""  Its true there are scenes of actual dog fights and training that are very brutal, but to those who care about dogs, and what is happening all over the world,it is a wake-up call.  This so-called ""sport"" of dogfighting MUST come to an end.  If a shocking movie such as this helps to bring a stop to the cruelty these dogs endure both in and out of the pit by raising awareness to the problem, then I highly recommend it.  I have a Rottweiler X Pit Bull mix who is a Canine Good Citizen, titled Agility dog, and working Therapy Dog.  With excercise, training, and a responsible owner, Pits and Pit mixes can be some of the best dogs there are.",1200700800,4,751,4.223776223776224

8066966,1,B0009UVCKS,"We are to imagine that we've learned all there is to know about dogfighting by watching a lot of half-brained criminal street thugs doing their thing?

Initially the film treats us to famous pit bulldogs Pete the Pup and Stubby the war hero -- then reminds us what wonderfully respected pets and companions the dogs were ""back in the day"" -- and all the while failing to remind us that if not for the dogfighting breeders of old the breed wouldn't have come about in the first place. And so the TRUE history of the breed: FIRST came the game-bred fighting dog, SECOND came the dogs' heyday during which not only were they being professionally fought and tested by the original stewards of the breed but being generally respected as well, and THIRD and at last relegated to such street thugs and criminals who bear little or no resemblance to such men as created the breed in the first place.

In short, it took serious, dedicated sporting men to create that whole breed of dog which is the American Pit Bull Terrier. Street thugs couldn't have done it. There are, in fact, TWO breeds of dogfighters: the old pros of the past who created the APBT and the street thugs who are destroying it. There are the TWO kinds of dogfighting, the one comparable to a professional contest between two bantam-weights in the ring -- and the other comparable to the most brutal of street fights. And, irony of ironies, it took BOTH sorts of dogfighting to bring us to the pit bulldog's present state of affairs -- the first being what created him in the first place and the second of which is destroying him.

There's lots more to consider about the history of dogfighting in this country, but that of course is the stuff of books. Time consuming doing the research, but perhaps it's worth it. Or, of course, we can simply watch a film like this one and imagine ourselves fully informed on what the APBT is all about. And then how nice for us.",1425859200,,1926,4.528735632183908

The ""dogmans"" dialogue made my skin crawl, I can't understand the appeal of animals tearing each other apart for entertainment, all the excuses of it being tradition, the dogs wanting to fight etc were all weak.
