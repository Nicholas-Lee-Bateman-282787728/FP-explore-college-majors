4435881,5,B004NJC0R0,"Ken Burns, the undisputed master of the TV documentary, has done it again.  This 3-part 5-1/2 hour PBS series kept my eyes glued to the screen while my own impressions of the world of prohibition, which were mostly gleaned from stories my parents told me, became real through the old film clips and the excellent narration and historical perspective.

Looking back, it seems as if the nation was crazy to actually pass a law that prohibited alcoholic beverages in all its forms.  But times were different then. In the small town Americana of 1919 men were getting dead drunk and abusing their families.  For the first time in history, women asserted themselves and organized the Women's Christian Temperance Union, marching in the streets and eventually influencing legislation. It was different in the cities however, where an immigrant population did not see liquor as a menace.  Thus began the age of Prohibition and the biggest crime wave and social change that America has ever seen.

This documentary tells it all with excellent film clips, fine historical research and clear and focused narration.  I loved every minute of it, learned a lot, and revisited old stories told to me as a child.  This series is absolutely spectacular, I give it my highest rating and am delighted that it is now available for purchase.",1318982400,47,1321,4.9457013574660635
4435882,5,B004NJC0R0,"Ken Burns is a great documentary film maker and he give us an in depth look at what was one of the greatest fiascos in our history!  Filled with facts, humor and the eye opening truth, Prohibition is amazing!!  Highly recommended!!",1318291200,3,231,4.609756097560975
4435883,4,B004NJC0R0,"PBS documentarian Burns shares the byline credit this time around with his business partner Lynn Novick. The script is again by Geoffrey C. Ward, based on a a 2010 book: ""Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition"" by Daniel Okrent . As noted by a previous reviewer here there are factual errors and they should be blamed on Ward. Burns is more interested in the collages he creates from thousands (literally - just look at the ed credits) of stills that he mixes with some silent film footage with newly added sound effects (""talking pictures"" were not common until 1927 - except for experimental film). Then he adds famous actors reading quotes from people relevant to the story at hand.

The show is divided into three parts and these are each placed on a separate DVD in the 3-disc package. The parts run about 100 minutes each. There are just over 90 minutes of ""bonus features"", consisting of a seven-minute ""behind the scenes"" (music scoring, the celebrity voices), deleted scenes (about 25 minutes) and 16 interview segments (totaling 53 minutes) of raw footage with timing counters.

There is no booklet or other informational insert in the package that is more generic than other Burns DVDs from PBS.

Burns is discussing a subject - not necessarily a time period - and spends the first third of the program just leading up to why prohibition occurred.

While some of the facts are wrong, so is the music - at least for the period. Many of the songs you will hear in the background are from the 1930s, not the `teens or the twenties. But most folks won't notice - as they won't notice the factual inaccuracies.

Burns does ""slick"" and ""visually appealing"" films and this is just another one of those. It's worth spending time with and - if you liked what you saw and heard on TV, the DVD gives you more of it; it's just not ""dressed up"" like it was on TV.

4435884,5,B004NJC0R0,"I am not an historian nor am I usually interested in documentaries. I accidentally turned the channel on the t.v. and was immediately captivated by the history of the prohibition era. I read the last review. I can't dispute the author's factual accounts, but from what I saw and learned the minute details that were missed or left out were irrelevant. I say that because even though the last reviewer tells of inaccuracies I think that the amount of information that was given left me with a passion to want to research more for myself. It's like having bad teachers and wanting to drop out of school then the next semester you have a dedicated teacher. That teacher can't teach you all you'll ever need to learn but gives you the thirst to want to learn more. So much to want to leave a review and purchase the Blu-ray. That's what I got from it.",1317859200,93,847,4.470967741935484
4435885,3,B004NJC0R0,"Lavishly produced, including recreated period music and a treasure trove of photographs, the latest ""documentary"" from Ken Burns manages to narrowly miss the mark. In most American colleges and universities, Burns would receive an ""A+"" if he submitted an essay resembling his television documentary adaptation of Geoffrey Ward's script, but that would be due to carelessness or an inattention to detail on the part of his docile professor.

The production is marred by numerous historical errors and omissions, large and small, including some which were repeated in print on the companion PBS web site: Dean O'Banion did not live until 1926 as he was killed by rival gangsters in November of 1924; a montage of Chicago gangsters murdered during 1926 and 1927 gang war includes ""Machine Gun"" Jack McGurn, who was actually killed a decade later; The political comeback election of Mayor William Hale Thompson, Jr., in 1927, was described as a ""landslide,"" but, in truth, he was elected by a much smaller margin (about 83,000 votes) than he had obtained in his initial 1915 mayoral race; similarly, the 1928 Democratic presidential nominee, Governor Al Smith of New York, was not defeated on account of the immense popularity of the Republican presidential incumbent since Herbert Hoover had not served as president prior to 1929; Hoover had served as a cabinet member (Secretary of Commerce), but he was elected to his first and only term in office after the incumbent president, Calvin Coolidge, chose not to run in 1928 (N. B. This inaccurate presidential information was posted on the companion PBS web site); the documentary praises Frances Willard of the Women's Christian Temperance Union while politely ignoring her bizarre lifestyle (cross dressing in masculine attire and conducting numerous lesbian affairs with her intimates who affectionately called her ""Frank"") which marked her as something of  a fanatical crackpot as well as a prohibitionist.

I could go on at further length, but what would be the point? One would think that Burns and Ward or their staffers would simply engage in some basic fact checking.

The series presents a composite history of prohibition which repeats many oft told yet widely accepted canards and embellished generalizations while occasionally creating brand new mistakes. The historical analysis provided is flavored with the leftist biases so common to historians and commentators who favored the New Deal Democratic Era to the Republican Twenties.

I so wanted to enjoy ""Prohibition,"" as I had liked some of the previous historical documentaries that Burns had made, but this one did not quite measure up.",1317772800,86,2650,5.25531914893617

In high school we were taught the beginning and ending dates and that it worked poorly.  The effects of the prohibition are with us today.  It did not give birth to the mafia in this country but it certainly was the steroid shot that increased its power and influence.to an astounding degree. Giuliani and Co. seriously wounded it but it morphed and is still with us today.  As multi-national corporations?",1499299200,,524,4.977011494252873
4435902,3,B004NJC0R0,"There is perhaps the ability to learn a thing or two about life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Prohibition seems not to be about any of that but more about the desire to oppose a true desire to be free of pain, to be free of suffering, and in fact to be satisfied with life as nature provides in its raw form. It is a truly terrible slight to learn that the largest organ in the human body outside of your skin is your liver. This miraculous organ does the duties so important to a persons well being that once you learn just how magnificent the liver like the human body is this story should truly make you wonder. The Liver is perhaps the only organ in the human body that can regenerate an entire leaf, even its entire two leaf body. It is a detoxifying filter that if anything that is not good for you tries to harm you it will move to filter it, stop it from going any further. There is so much unmistakable love that came from our creator that when you learn of just what your liver does it will be a day in glory.  It is a vital organ to be certain and without it the human being will die. It is as suggested a terrible slight to know that of all the yeoman duties that the liver performs there are many ways that the liver can be damaged and its ability to do its job can be impeded. One such way is by physical trauma. I can recall stories told of former World  Heavy Weight Boxing  Champion Muhammad Ali when immediately following one of those terrible fights with say, Joe Frazier, Ali after the fight urinated blood. This would be an example of a physical trauma to the Liver, however, it is mostly a shame to learn that this resilient even magnificent organ can be felled by another way and that would be to overwhelm the Livers natural capacity to detoxify the body. Alcohol can damage the Liver and if the host persists Alcohol will kill the Livers ability to detoxify. The host inability to know better is directly tied to an influence that has no basis in the truth nor is there any representation in life other than to provide an escort to a premature departure. The unmistakable suffering that the consumption of alcohol has provided is such a discredit to society as to be a shame. The repeal of the Volstead Act represents one of the true injustices of the 20th Century. This malady has cast such a shadow across all of society that there is a pamphlet that appears to have been written by a  particular church's Pastor. In the Pamphlet, it states some 6 or so very violent crimes ranging from Homicide, Robbery, Arson, etc... the place as a percentage that Alcohol plays in the commission of these particular crimes was a shock. The pervasive slight that this consumption of Alcohol and the place Alcohol represents is due to a world that loves not and it loves not due in part to the corruption that allowed for the repeal to have occurred. A dirty and corrupt world has underwritten the place that this toxic poison now has. The human heart is not here because it will be quited by the Toxic poison that is killing the host.""Prohibiton"" is not entirely necessary to view. I do not think that there is not a man or women alive given the respect of privacy and the dignity to place perhaps on paper that would not share this terrible wrong that Alcohol has manifested. This is what ""Prohibition"" is about, it is about a challenge that was created out of not wanting to be referred to as a ""Nation of Drunkards"". It was born out of the shame that reasonable men and women saw in their very communities. Married men unable to control any inhibition, would drink themselves drunk then spend all their money and cost family, which included children to suffer. Suffer to such an extent that failure, yes failure was its father. The film ""Prohibition"" does not answer anything as much as it gives no chance for anything other than more of the same injustice to occur. This need not be an answer but ""Prohibition"" is not fate. I think this is an important distinction ""Prohibition"" is in a manner of speaking not you nor me. It is further to know, like I suggest we know,  in our collective psyche that Alcohol is a dangerous and deadly Toxic poison. There is no natural predilection to consume an alcoholic beverage and its consumption may have as much to do with not knowing why an individual consumes Alcohol, as would be to know why was it necessary to repeal the Volstead Act?  The consumption of Alcohol in this opinion is a un-natural act, at the very least the consumption of alcohol is unnecessary. I do not think the viewing of ""Prohibition"" is necessary.",1497052800,,4589,4.450653983353151

4435922,5,B004NJC0R0,"My father gave me the DVD set at the beginning of the year and just got around to watching it a few days ago.

The documentary was put together very well. I am a huge fan of the era and this movie gave me many interesting events and people to research. For instance, I had ran across mentions of ""rum row"" but had never really paid much attention to it. The way that it was presented in this documentary made me see that there was a story that might be worth pursuing. Another is the Purple Gang of Detroit. I had actually never heard of them before.

Burns touches on the origins of AA, the women's movement, what prohibition did for women, how women helped introduce (and later kill) prohibition, major players in bootlegging, entrepreneurs who found loopholes and were able to work w/ liquor quasi-legally, and much more.

Burns eloquently points out the flaws in attempting to mass-restrict a vice, simply b/c a small percentage of the population cannot act responsibly. Someone interviewed (a recovering alcoholic) in the film pointed out that it was, and is, wrong to stop everyone from drinking when only 10% of the people have a problem with alcohol. The proper approach is to help and treat the 10%.

As was stated in the film, everybody drank when it was illegal to do so. But when it was legal, it became much harder. This can easily be extended to cover the topic of drugs today, down to the finger-pointing between groups that blame traffickers for drug use epidemics and traffickers place the blame right back on the users. I've seen a couple of other reviews that already touched on this so I won't comment further on that, but I invite you to read Michael Tullberg's comment (War On Drugs, the Prequel) and David Smith's comment (A documentary with a very strong point of view).

This documentary will be enjoyed by anyone who is interested in the roaring 20's, prohibition, and the history of alcohol. It is also sure to spark interest in anyone who possesses no background knowledge of the era.",1463875200,,2012,4.640449438202247

From seeing Ken Burn's documentary any person, here in the United States, or anywhere around the world, can learn about ""The Great Amercian Mistake.""  What can a person say about the experiment.  Prohibition remains one of the biggest flops in American History, and the only time an Amendment to the Unites States Constitution, the 18th Amendment, was repealed, by the 21st Amendment.  Prohibition had good intentions, just by the wrong people to listen to.  After both reading the book and watching this documentary I learned that deeply religous people shouldn't always be listened to.  Often their views are far from the right thing to do.  Prohibition didn't change the United States for the best.  In the end, it created far more problems that it solved.  Deep down, my view is that those who planned and designed Prohibition truly didn't grasp the idea of the idea of how to enforce it, and the challenges to enforcing it.  In the end, Americans rights to enjoy an occasional drink triumphed over those who wished to tell the United States it could not have alcohol.  Prohibition did lead to the invention of Alcoholics Anoyomous, so in a way, Prohibition is a good thing.  It is also ""the Great American Lesson,"" in how Americans have the right to decide how to live their lives.

4435967,4,B004NJC0R0,"Any Ken Burns documentary is going to be smart, well made and educational. This one is also fun (in the plus column), but lacks the emotion, ambition and power of his very best work, like ""The Civil War"" or ""The Central Park Five"".

Made with a ton of great movie footage and stills, and lots of tid-bits about the history of drinking in America -- it's out of control pervasiveness among men, especially working class men, that led to the push for prohibition that puts the now ridiculous seeming constitutional amendment in a somewhat more understandable light. That in turn explains the odd confluence of its backers, from religious conservatives, to well meaning social progressives looking to save the poor from themselves, to blue-blood WASPS who hated working class immigrants who drank more openly, to women fighting for the right to vote, and who saw how often alcohol contributed to domestic violence.

The film also does a great job in showing how a law that tens of millions of citizens will simply ignore is much worse than no law at all, as it sows the seeds of disregard and contempt for the law, as well creating a fertile ground for criminals to give people what they want in a black market. Much the same arguments are going on in the US right now about other ""vice"" laws, from marijuana, to prostitution, to proposed laws on fatty and sugary foods.

One of the central questions of any democracy is how much and where does the government have a right to intrude into people's lives for the greater good. It's an important and complicated question, and one the series does a good job of raising.

But at over 5 hours it starts to run a little thin, and the points and stories start to get a bit repetitive. I'm glad I saw it, and enjoyed myself quite a bit, but unlike many documentaries by Burns (and his equally talented brother Ric), I don't think I'll feel a need to re-watch it anytime soon.",1416960000,,1914,4.604105571847508

It takes a very close look at the circumstances surrounding prohibition and it's effects, and does so with keen insight. Alcohol may not currently be on our radar regarding the ""War on Drugs"" but it is enlightening to see what happened when it was, and how that compares to modern day views on alcohol and other drugs we now consider ""legal"" or ""illegal"".",1406419200,2,480,4.593023255813954

I always remember my grandmother and parents talking about Prohibition but never really knew the history behind it and how formerly law-abiding citizens became law-breakers in the face of the scofflaw rebellion of this ridiculous amendment. Prohibition was a prime example of how useless it is for a society to address a social problem without looking at root cause...a problem that still exists today among radical political factions. I found the photographs fascinating...especially of the flappers because I saw photos of my grandmother as a young woman wearing clothes like that and immediately understood that she and her girlfriends were most likely among the speakeasy set. This is a well-organized documentary that should be shown in every high school as part of their American History curriculum. Outstanding!

That is to say, through his eyes we are well rewarded to stay with him as he uncovers new perspectives on a period of the twenty century many of thought we knew from reading F. Scott Fitzgerald and occasionally hearing jazz recordings of the time. While Fitzgerald is a fantastic way to learn about that period, it is not the compleat story but once you have watched this DVD, you too will gain a wonderful new insight into a time, a mood, and a place similar to the one Jay Gatsby and friends lived in but with more depth.",1399593600,,755,4.478260869565218

4435993,5,B004NJC0R0,"Like most people, I have no direct memory of prohibition.  It has always seemed to me a stupid, and ultimately failed attempt to enforce morality by law.  Of course, morality is always enforced by law--don't kill, don't steal--but trying to enforce prohibition seemed wrong-headed.  For one thing, drinking was common even among ""good"" people, and would require messy and problematic enforcement.  Furthermore, the problem did not seem to be drinking, but rather over drinking.  Why not enforce laws against the latter and leave the former alone (as our dwi laws do)?
After watching this documentary, I changed my mind.
I found out I was completely underestimating the ubiquity of alcohol abuse, and the havoc it caused on families and women and children--not to mention animals, prior to prohibition.  I was thinking of alcohol abuse as it exists today, which left me unprepared for how it existed then.
Here's what I think after watching the video: Prohibition was a brave, compassionate, and necessary attempt to rescue families and worker productivity and children.  It was not a failure, because it changed even to this day the way we view alcohol.
We dropped prohibition, but something valuable stuck with us.",1394841600,11,1215,5.137055837563452

When I finally received it, I hurriedly unwrapped it and put disc 1 into my DVD player and had trouble just getting it to boot up!  I never got it to get to the menu screen, nor did I get any of the other discs to work.

I called up Amazon, returned it, and asked for a replacement copy.  It was screwed-up too.  I returned it and got my money back; I would have preferred a working DVD copy of the program.

4436002,5,B004NJC0R0,"Alcohol has been with humanity since the agricultural revolution.  It is used in everything from gas tanks to religious ceremonies.  Yet, in a spasm of moral violence, the United States banned alcohol for a little more than a decade.  The laws which did so were the 18th Amendment to the US Constitution and the Volstead Act.

With three separate films, and using stock footage and photos of the key participants as well as riveting historical commentary, Ken Burns traces the ""Dry"" movement from its origins in a Congregationalist sermon in the 1860's to becoming policy.  Once the policy goes into effect however, America doesn't become sober, instead the society drifts into moral decay.

As always, a great film from Ken Burns.",1374710400,,731,5.0

Learning about the years building up to Prohibition and the roles of the Women's Christian Temperance Union and the Anti-Saloon League was fascinating as was the section on the 1928 election and the vitriol directed toward Governor Al Smith.  I do think the end of Prohibition was treated a bit summarily.

Obviously this was author's intent but one cannot watch and not see echoes of current debates in the ones mentioned in the documentary.  Whether it is the question of banning something (like the War on Drugs or debates on gun control) or the intense divide in this country between rural and urban and between pro-immigration and anti-immigration, the disc is a reminder that most of the questions the U.S. has grappled with have been here for a long long time.",1373587200,2,899,4.973333333333334

4436026,4,B004NJC0R0,"I read Okrent's book, `Last Call' (on which this documentary is based) last year and I thoroughly enjoyed it. And I enjoyed this documentary quite as well.

There are three dvds in here, for a total of more than 6 hours of footage. The first dvd covers the birth of the idea of prohibiting alcohol from Americans' lives, back in the 1800s: how people lived, what they drank and how much, how this affected everyday life, how the first prohibition movements worked. The second discusses the life of the 18th Amendment: how it was lobbied by the anti-saloon league, the way distrust towards immigrants played a big part in it, how this changed the life of people, especially youth. The last dvd addresses the way gangsters profited from the law, how this took away the trust of people for the law and order and especially for Prohibition, how when the Great Depression kicked in the 18th Amendment was finally repealed.

There is a huge amount of images from the time discussed. Mainly photographs in the first dvd, but a huge amount of it. So many videos in the other two, coming from Twenties films, but also non-fiction footage and even some personal photos and video. I love this.
Beside interview with experts - including Okrent - there are a number of interviews with people who were young during Prohibition. Oral history is incredible. People who remember often have a very different view, their tales have a different mood from the commentary from experts. And the one always enriches the other.

There is a thing where the documentary goes in a different direction than the book. Where the book focuses on everyday life and the way Prohibition affected it, the documentary focuses more on personalities. Politicians, anti-saloon league members, judges, cops, personalities of different kind, including journalists and gangsters. Where the book only touches upon these people's life and involvement in Prohibition, the documentary gives a full portrait of them, and I liked a lot the way stories mixed with images. It gives a very strong feeling for the era.

So, maybe there is nothing particularly new about the info the documentary provides: it's the same as the book, is basically the same as so many other books about Prohibition. But I loved the footage. In a way, it was like being there.

4436029,5,B004NJC0R0,"As Ken Burns explains in his remarkable 6 hour presentation ""Prohibition"" when the Eighteenth Amendment went into effect on January 17, 1920 no one was quite sure how it all was going to play out.  The road that led to the passage of the Volstead Act in 1919 had been a long and arduous one.  The American Temperance Society had been calling for such a law for nearly a century.  Through an unlikely coalition that included both conservatives and progressives what was deemed the ""Noble Experiment"" would wreak havoc on the nation for a dozen years.  ""Prohibition"" chronicles the history of the temperance movement, the forces that coalesced to make the national ban on the sale, manufacture, and transportation of alcohol a reality, as well as the tragic and unanticipated consequences of it all.  Furthermore, Burns devotes a considerable amount of time to the considerable role that women played in making it all come about.  This is a riveting tale that managed to hold my attention from start to finish.

So what were some of those consequences that I referred to?  For those engaged in the business of winemaking at the outset of Prohibition in 1920 precious few options were available.  With the stroke of a pen their world had been turned upside down.  Federal law allowed for the manufacture of ""sacramental"" wines but this market was clearly very limited.  Some growers would be forced to sell their grapes for juice while others chose to plant other crops like apricots just to survive.  The fact of the matter is that no one in wine country believed that prohibition was going to last as long as it did.  As time wore on more and more families became desperate.  Denied the ability to earn an honest living many vineyard owners turned to the only option the felt they had left--bootlegging--and sold off what wine they had on hand to hotels and speakeasies.  The same would be true for distillers. Under the cover of night these previously law-abiding citizens shipped illicit vino and spirits to major cities such as San Francisco, New York and Chicago.  With all of this of course came great risk.  If they were nabbed by the federal authorities they were subject to stiff fines and possible arrest.  In many cases federal Prohibition officers would descend on their property and empty their tanks into the local river or creek.  Years of hard work literally went down the drain in just a few minutes.  Some of the footage Burns offers is just heartbreaking to watch.  Meanwhile, many local law enforcement officers, clearly sympathetic to the plight of their friends and neighbors, would attempt to thwart the feds.  It was an unsettling and messy situation that made thieves and liars and criminals out of a whole host of people. In his film Ken Burns introduces us to small-time whiskey jobbers, well-heeled bootleggers and a whole host of gangsters who would would step in to fill the void and make millions doing it.  And of course a major part of the story was the gang violence that would emerge across the nation, most especially in Chicago.  Burns spends considerable time covering this aspect of the story and the footage is incredible.  While the so-called ""Drys"" certainly ruled the day in the 1920's it was becoming abundantly clear by the dawn of the 1930's that their considerable influence was waning and that it was only a matter of time before Prohibition would come to an end.  Ken Burns does a workmanlike job of covering this aspect of the story as well.

As is almost always the case in a Ken Burns production,  the still photos, vintage footage and music presented in this film are quite extraordinary. No one does it quite like Ken Burns.  I enjoyed it so much that I was even motivated to watch the bonus features. One of them captured jazz legend Wynton Marsalis and his band recording much of the music that you hear in ""Prohibition"".  As I recall Marsalis composed quite a bit of this music especially for this film.  Great stuff!  Another bonus feature showed Tom Hanks, Paul Giamatti and Patricia Clarkson recording some of the narration for the film.  These features make you appreciate just how complex and time-consuming a task it is to put these films together.  I found ""Prohibition"" to be a comprehensive, informative and highly entertaining film.  There seems to be no aspect of this subject that Ken Burns failed to cover.  There is an awful lot to learn and to enjoy here.  In my view,  ""Prohibition"" is history at it's best.  Very hightly recommended!",1354579200,,4505,4.793774319066148

4436032,4,B004NJC0R0,"Sick & Stupid Score: 2/4*

As the saying goes, If you only have a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

Thus, this documentary attempts to view approximately 80 years of American history as one long battle over alcohol.  Every historical issue, from the abolition of slavery to  women's suffrage to World War One, the income tax, political corruption, gangland violence, and the Great Stock Market Crash--indeed, every event of any significance in American history from approximately the 1850's to the 1930's--is somehow related to or correlated with alcohol consumption or alcohol abstinence.

Aw, go on Ken.  There has to be other forces at work in modern American history besides Wet vs. Dry, right?

Historical tunnel vision aside, this is a thoroughly enjoyable documentary.  If anything, the archival footage is worth the price of admission alone, especially watching the girls go from corseted black lace ankle-length dresses to thigh-high, garter-flashing flapper outfits.  Whew.  The combination of voting rights and bootleg whiskey was totally liberating.

4436033,5,B004NJC0R0,Ken Burns has done it again. His work is fantastic.  Highly recommend this DVD.  Interesting and informative.  You will not be disappointed.,1347148800,,140,5.2727272727272725
4436034,5,B004NJC0R0,"Prohibition lasted from 1920 to 1933. Ironically this period say an increase in alcohol consumption. But most importantly, it gave power and money to organized crime. Burns absolutely captures the mood of this time period.

One of the best parts of this collection is that Burns and his researchers went back to many years before prohibition and followed the initial stirrings of the anti alcohol movement. He takes us to mid 1800s Kansas, Ohio, and other places where women formed groups against alcohol sales while promoting suffrage. By the end of the first disc, Prohibition is going into effect. The second disc really gets into the events of the actual years during Prohibition. Not only do we look at the most notorious gangster of them all, Al Capone a.k.a. Scarface, but we also see organized crime rings cropping up all over the country. Many were founded by ex-cops, ex-lawyers, and ex-politicians.

The story is wonderfully narrated by many talented people, including Tom Hanks, Sam Waterston, John Lithgow, Samuel L Jackson, and Blythe Danner. The narration is particularly well directed and placed. Burns and co-director Lynn Novick are seasoned veterans of documentary directing (she also worked with Burns on The War). Their talents show a masterful touch. We never really get the feeling that we are being taught something, but instead are brought into the stories and times as a silent observer. When you finish the documentary, you really get a sense that you learned something but you just don't feel it was forced on you.

Another great benefit of Burns' directing is that we see views from all sides of the story. We do see the reasons why Prohibition came into effect. We also see the impossibility of enforcing these laws in a non-totalitarian state. There isn't really a 'lesson'. Burns and company aren't saying ""Look how foolish this Prohibition thing was!"", but instead they are showing the causes leading up to this time and the effect the laws had on the United States, and even the US allies such as Britain.

While this isn't quite the powerhouse that ""The War"" was or the epic story that Burns told in ""Lewis and Clark"", it is nonetheless a great documentary of a pivotal time in American history. Burns and Novick really do a wonderful job of bringing life to the black and white photos and grainy short film clips. It's a time in history that most Americans are passingly familiar with, but it is so interesting to actually get into the heart of the story and see all of the good and bad associated with this time.

One note: I am watching the Blu-Ray edition checked out from my local library. While I am a fan of Blu-Ray in general for the clarity and the audio, I do feel that it is rather unnecessary for this documentary. Most of the old photography isn't meant to be crystal clear. I do recommend the HD version (streaming or Blu-Ray), but I feel like the story wouldn't be any less amazing in standard definition.",1341100800,3,2955,4.786274509803921
4436035,5,B004NJC0R0,"My favorite comment in this documentary is offered by Pete Hamill, American journalist, novelist and essayist, who said basically if you want people to brush their teeth, pass a law banning toothpaste. And then people will do everything they can to acquire toothpaste illegally, and they'll brush their teeth just to spite the law. The unforeseen consequence of Prohibition is that once you take away a person's right to do something that people have always done, people will feel the desire to want it much more intensely, in the same way if you deny a child all sweets, the kid will be sneaking chocolate inside his jacket sleeves. Hamill later says he doesn't drink, but he would probably take a swig in front of a government building if the law ever forbade him from doing it. Encouraging moderation is not the same as banning something completely.

The other comment worth noting concerns repeal crusader Pauline Sabin who had been entrenched in republican politics prior to 1928. Republican congressmen would vote to adhere to the strictest of prohibition laws as laid out by the Volstead Act and then go to one of Sabin's parties demanding a drink. She concluded that the United States had become ""a Nation of Hypocrites"", which is the title of the third installment of Burn's documentary. Sabin becomes an unlikely hero who would sway the country against Prohibition and the eventual repeal of the 18th Amendment of the Constitution, the only amendment so dignified. Ironically, Daniel Okrent points out that today alcohol is somewhat harder to come by than during Prohibition because of liquor laws, underage drinking laws, etc. When alcohol was strictly forbidden, there was nothing in place to regulate it, except for raids on speakeasies and private distilleries.

Based in part on Daniel Okrent's ""Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition"", Ken Burns and Lynn Novick's ""Prohibition"" is a thoroughly entertaining, simultaneously humorous and ""sobering"" look at one of the strangest episodes in American legal history. The documentary is in three parts, the first chronicling the birth of the temperance movement which began in the 1820's almost a century before the ratification of the 18th Amendment. No question that alcohol was a problem for some people, mostly among the rural poor, but the temperance movement decided alcohol itself was the problem and vowed its eradication by the late 19th century. The first part ends with the ratification of the 18th Amendment to the US Constitution prohibiting not only the sale but importation of alcohol. Part two concerns the passage of the Volstead Act designed to enforce the amendment, and the immediate consequences of trying to stop people from drinking, and the antithetical results, such as lawlessness and bribery. The third and most sobering of the episodes chronicles many of the unintended consequences, such as the violence erupting in Chicago and the night club craze. The documentary ends with the movement for the repeal of the 18th Amendment.

The unforeseen catastrophes of the 18th Amendment which were designed to heighten American morality and assuage drunkenness turned America into one of the most alcoholic-driven nations among the industrialized world. Americans drank more booze, partied more, got more drunk, and flaunted the law more often during Prohibition than at any other time in the nation's history since after the Civil War, even as compared to the present time. Possibly only the 1960's are somewhat comparable to the mayhem of the 1920's.

The irony of ironies that the decade begun by the Temperance Movement's victory with the passage of the 18th Amendment to the US Constitution in 1919 would be nicknamed the Roarding Twenties and the Jazz Age. This was not a decade known for drinking milk. This was a decade characterized by cocktail glasses in the hands of flappers dancing on tables to the evocative music of Duke Ellington and Count Basie. Men would be raising giant mugs of frothy beer in underground establishments called speakeasies. Only Prohibition allowed the likes of Al Capone and Lucky Luciano to become wealthy gangsters, almost movie stars by today's standards. The leaders of the Temperance Movement, particularly the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and the Anti-Saloon League, were appalled when their daughters ran off to speakeasies and night clubs to partake of the forbidden fruit. Strangely, Prohibition helped usher in the Night Club culture of America which has continued unabated ever since. All the great night clubs famous for their booze, music, and dancing such as the Cotton Club and the Stork Club, were incepted when alcohol was supposed to be illegal.

For some reason, I didn't think Prohibition permeated into so many aspects of American life during its enforcement from 1920 through 1932. People could open small businesses in their basements and make a fortune through bootlegging, and then be hauled away under the Volstead Act. The rise of the Chicago Gang syndicate became a prototype for similar syndicates across the country, all vying for their bootlegging territory. At one point, citizens were legally compelled to snitch on neighbors suspected of bootlegging. The story as presented by Burns/Novick is as compelling as any action thriller being produced today. A great movie of American history, with all the elements that make a great story. Essentially it's a legal thriller with sex, violence, and lots of booze. Lots of it.",1331251200,3,5480,5.166666666666667

Since much of the story occurs after the advent of motion pictures this program incorporates many moving picture clips and so is much more dynamic than some of the Ken Burns programs that cover earlier historical periods.  The story line is compelling.  However there is a definite editorial point of view that runs through the entire series which I understand to be ""one cannot legislate morality and because of this prohibition did more harm than good"" and though not explicit I see a suggestion that the current anti drug laws are similarly flawed and doomed to failure at great cost to the country, its people and the respect for law.

It's a three part as follows: (1) ""A Nation of Drunkards"" describes how immigration, alcoholism, women's suffrage and the temperance movements led up to the passing of the 18th Amendment, Prohibition.; (2) ""A Nation of Scofflaws"" addresses how the enforcement of Prohibition was inconsistent and caused unintended consequences, including making criminals of a large portion of the population.
(3) ""A Nation of Hypocrites"" follows the gradual swing towards repeal of Prohibition as the Great Depression focuses attention on other priorities. There's an impressive cast of narrators here: Jeremy Irons, Oliver Platt, Paul Giamatti, Adam Arkin, Tom Hanks, Capmbell Scott, Samuel L. Jackson and John Lithgow. Overall narration was done by Peter Coyote. Mostly told through period footages and with music from the 1930s.

One side comment, since I haven't seen this mentioned in other reviews: At the very end of the documentary, the voice-over states that in the past 75 years there has never been a constitutional amendment that imposes one set of moral values on America, implying that we have learned the lesson of Prohibition, that morality cannot be legislated. I was surprised at this statement, given the ""War on Drugs"" that has been ""fought"" for decades. Of course, no constitutional amendment is involved, but is this really different than the war on alcohol of years ago? Are we enriching criminals and undermining respect for the law by making marijuana, for example, illegal, in the same manner as the Prohibition years brought us Al Capone and the speakeasies?

4436064,5,B004NJC0R0,"""Prohibition"" is a must-see for anyone interested in this documentary directed by Ken Burns and Lynn Novick. This is an in-depth study of how circumstances were right to amend the Constitution and prohibit the sale of alcohol in 1920.  Burns and Novick did a thought-provoking job of raising the questions of the role of government versus individual rights, issues we still face today.",1319932800,3,385,5.111111111111111

8436685,5,B004NJC0R0,"So well done and very interesting! I see many similarities with alcohol prohibition and today's drug war. Prohibition seems to be a total failure and a socially irresponsible public policy. Control means actually having control. Prohibition relinquishes control to those in the black market. Prohibition endangers our citizens, corrupts police, politicians and our court system. It erodes our justice system and confidence in our Government. Prohibition provides black market criminals with a lucrative source of income. Prohibition creates allot of propaganda and ""fake news"" eroding trust in the media and Government to provide actual honest information. Prohibition makes problems worse and is very poor public policy. I enjoyed the film and I thought it was very well done.",1510790400,,777,5.593220338983051
