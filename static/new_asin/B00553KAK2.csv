4571603,5,B00553KAK2,"As any boy who came of age in the late 60's or early 70's can tell you, The Herculoids was probably the greatest thing to ever hit Saturday morning television.  In an era when funny, talking animals shows were starting to give way to more adventurous fare like Johnny Quest and various superhero shows, the Alex Toth-designed Herculoids delivered the goods better than any other series.

For the uninitiated, the show followed the adventures of humanoids Zandor, Tara and their son Dorno on the planet Quasar.  A unique assortment of creatures aided them: Zok, the flying dragon; a giant with rock-like skin named Igoo; the fireball-shooting triceratops-like Tundro; and the amusing blob-like Gloop and Gleep.  Trouble came (and came often) in the form of invaders for whom the planet Quasar must have seemed the ultimate prize.  Hideous monsters and robots of all sorts set their sights on the heroes' homeworld, and were met with deadly resistance.  You want morals at the end of your cartoon?  Forget it. . .the Herculoids were going to defend their turf, and justice was final on planet Quasar.

This two-disc set collects all 18 original shows (technically, 36 episodes, since each half hour is comprised of 2 segments of 10 or so minutes each).  There is a very brief featurette about the series, in which various modern artists and writers gush about Alex Toth, and celebrate the boyhood fantasy charm of the show (one commentator points out that the Herculoids was pretty much non-stop stuff blowing up).  And that's the gist of the series, really: monsters, ray guns, lots of action.  As a fan from childhood, I was happy to see that in today's PC world of bland animated kids' shows, The Herculoids holds up very well.

As is becoming more and more common, these Warner Archive discs are manufactured DVD-R's, meaning it is possible that customers may experience some playback difficulties in some machines.  I played both discs on my DVD recorder/player and my computer using WMP with no problems.  The prints used are of good quality, although the occasional debris does pop up.  As classic animation remains a niche market and sells no where near as well as modern shows, I'd imagine this is the best release we'll ever see of The Herculoids.  Certainly it's a no-brainer for fans.  And for parents who aren't overly considered about the cartoon violence, I think it's still a fine choice, especially for young boys.",1308355200,101,2429,4.91421568627451

I suppose HB will restore these episodes at some point for blu-ray and cash in again, but the remastering should have been done for this initial release like many of the other shows from the same era such as johnny Quest, Spiderman and the like. It's good that this old cartoon is available for home entertainment, but compared to many of the HB cartoons from that era, it's not a recommended purchase.",1514160000,,545,4.934782608695652

The human family of Zandor, his wife, Tara and son Dorno, team up to protect their planet with Zok, the flying Dragon that shoots electricity? out of his eyes and tail. Igoo, the giant rock cgorilla with great stragth and rock like skin, Tundro who is a pseudo Rhino that shoots energy rocks from his horn and lastly Gloop and Gleep Stretchable Proto matter.

4571658,5,B00553KAK2,"Until the mid-1980's, Bill Hanna and Joe Barbera were undisputed masters of Saturday morning TV, and this fondly-remembered classic is one of their high moments. The series follows the last human family trying to defend their alien planet from a mostly interchangeable gaggle of monsters, mad scientists, and space pirates. To do so, they have the help of the Herculoids: alien creatures with strange powers: Igoo (an invulnerable gorilla-like creature with vast strength), Tundro (a rhino/dinosaur hybrid-looking thing with a built-in cannon), and Zok (like a dragon, but with laser eyes rather than fire breath). And let's not forget the amorphous twin blobs Gloop and Gleep.

Although short-lived, the series was beloved by the fans and rightly remains so, even if the animation gets repetitive quickly (you try making a cartoon on that kind of budget) and the writing is for the most part bland and generic 1960's sci-fi twaddle. Perhaps one day we'll finally get these guys on the big screen; the fans have earned it.",1468454400,7,1022,5.119760479041916

4571708,4,B00553KAK2,"I'm just so glad to finaly have another rare Hanna Barbera Alex toth action cartoon! These have been really hard to get and I am glad to have Herculoids and Moby Dick and Mighty Mightor to add to Space Ghost, Birdman and 1960's Jonny Quest dvds!! These 1960's action cartoons have moments of comic humour with the dramatic action that remind me of Max Fleicher's Popeye, Superman and even MGM's Tom and Jerry cartoons! I think both Ed Barge and Irv Spence, animaters on Mighty Mightor worked on Tom and Jerry! I hope SHAZZAN, another Alex Toth designed Hanna Barbera cartoon series will appear in this Warner Archive collection very soon PLEASE!! Remastering would make this still better but I appreciate the high quality prints here! But get these 1960's Alex Toth cartoons that were made before Action for children's television took the bite and fun out of tv animation! Bruce W. Timm brought it back with Batman the animated series in the 1990s!!",1430179200,,949,4.7926829268292686

4571752,5,B00553KAK2,"The activists who would go on to ruin broadcast television for children no doubt had this show in mind as an example of how NOT to do things; twice every week in back to back ten minute or so episodes, villains would invade the Herculoids' domain (or the domains of friends) on the Planet Amzot, from other planets, from other domains on the same planet, from underground, and once from the future.  In response the Herculoids would kick their butts!  No agonizing, no attempts to understand why they were hated, no ""Can't we all just get along?"", just lots and lots of villainous machines and minions being smashed or blown up and villains being defeated and sometimes even killed because they had violently barged in where they didn't belong.  Though nobody was rubbing your face in it, there was a clear Cold War theme running through it: except when they were riding to the rescue of similarly attacked friends, the Herculoids were just minding their own business in their own land when some villain decided they were in the way and had to be eliminated, and the Herculoids (quite naturally for the time, it only looks odd from today's warped PC perspective,) responded with maximum force and terminated the problem with extreme prejudice.  Of course no gore was shown but there were lots of crashes and explosions where not a trace was left behind.  Occasionally villains would return alive and spoiling for a rematch (with the same outcome) in later shows, or Zandor would opine that maybe we hadn't seen the last of them yet, but even so it was an impressive body count for a Saturday morning kid's cartoon show.

At the core were three barely dressed, primitively armed (energy rock slingshots and Zandor's Captain-America-like shield) humans: Zandor, Tara, and Dorno.  Then came the human intelligence or better beast friends who were so devoted to them: Zok, the laser ray dragon; Igoo, the giant rock ape; Tundro, the 10-legged, energy rock firing rhino; and Gloop and Gleep, the formless, fearless blob creatures.  What made the fighting so interesting to me then and now was the tactics.  The beast Herculoids were generally invulnerable to attack while the humans were not, but the villains were not pushovers.  The trick was finding the right combination of beast powers and tactics to solve the problem: Zok was triple laser Death from Above along with scout and fast transport, Tundro was grenade launcher and Ramming Speed along with armored transport (at least from the front), Igoo was super powered Punching and Throwing and Weaponizing found objects (he made and deployed a boomerang successfully in one memorable scene.), Gloop and Gleep were Special Teams, the ones the villains could never even partially counter and as the only ones truly capable of defense of others, served as bodyguards for the humans.  (One of their most spectacular exploits came in ""The Crystalites"" in which they teamed up to become a rescue tank.)  The best show of all IMHO, containing the two best episodes, was number 11.  A creepy episode about giant soldier ants ""Destroyer Ants"" was followed by the creepiest villain of all in ""Swamp Monster"".

The Alex Toth designs were quite wonderful though the animation was quite limited.  The music and sound effects were recycled from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jonny-Quest/dp/B0001MZ7J6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jonny Quest</a>&nbsp;show, including the voice actor who played Race Bannon (Mike Road) now being the voice of Zandor.

Defects?  Well, in watching the shows straight through, the repetition becomes a lot more apparent, and attempts to vary the formula were not always successful (The Herculoids meet knockoffs of the ancient Romans complete with Emperor Neron in the somewhat embarrassing ""The Gladiators of Kyanite"" and knockoffs of the Vikings in the considerably better ""The Raider Apes"").  With no time in the episode to spare for such things to be ferreted out Zandor usually knows the villains and their nefarious intentions on sight so we can get straight to the fighting.

The Sexism: This show is nearly a half century old, and it shows, particularly in its treatment of women.  There are only three female characters in the whole show: one is a scenery chewing villainess (Queen Skorra), one is a helpless (if brave) rescued hostage (Princess Serena), and the third is Tara, Zandor's wife and Dorno's mother, whose primary contribution to the fighting is to require one of the Formless Wonders (Gleep or Gloop) to be detached from the main force in order to guard her and/or to be captured by the villain and have to be rescued.  Even when brainwashed into being ""Ruler of the Reptons"", Tara doesn't get to do anything.  Now, to the creators' credit that changes in both episodes of the last show.  For once (well, twice) there is no, ""Tara, you, stay behind, and Gloop/Gleep, you stay behind and guard her.""

In ""The Island of the Gravites"" Tara not only accompanies the army to the battlefield, but Zandor directs her to scout ahead on Zok's back.  In the meantime, Zandor manages to get himself captured, and Tara herself leads the rescue party, without any lip from her son. Then in the following episode ""Malak and the Metal Apes"" Zandor and Gloop sneak into the enemy fortress while Tara commands the other Herculoids to break into the fortress and join them.  It wasn't much, but it was a start.

The series was revived 14 years later in 11 episodes as part of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Space-Stars-The-Complete-Series/dp/B00FNR9ZN8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Space Stars: The Complete Series</a>, and while these are at least watchable, they have had the mindful violence toned down and replaced with a more mindless peacefulness.  Frankly, the only change one can honestly call an improvement is the conversion of Tara from useless impediment into equal partner in the battles for their home, but it comes at too high a price.

Note: The only extra in this bare bones collection is a short documentary ""The Herculoids: The First Family of Planet Quasar"", which is mostly gushing by animation historians and younger animators inspired by it.",1408838400,4,6224,5.1590457256461235

4571767,3,B00553KAK2,"Without a doubt, one of the greatest 60s Saturday morning programs! If you check out my other Saturday morning Hanna-Barbera show reviews, you'll see that I rarely rate them so well, so you can actually put more stock into these reviews than those that give them all 5 stars (and, no, MOST of these are NOT even 4 stars, making these other reviews questionably sentimental hogwash). The Herculoids stands head and shoulders above many other shows due to it taking a bit more time on its animation. Alex Toth had a bit more of a budget than shows to follow. Also these programs in the late 60s were slightly more mature, leading to the networks dumbing down those coming later. If you like superheroes, the Hanna-Barbera shows of this period - original heroes or not - were much better than the licensed ones that other studios produced from comic book publishers.",1407628800,,863,4.7218543046357615

He marries they have a son on the mostly primitive planet of Amzot. A place that is very popular with those who wish to use it and exploit it. They have a loving family. In one scene Zandor and Tara his wife are sleeping next to each other. Very risqu for the 1960's especially for a Saturday Morning cartoon.

These were among the ""violent"" cartoons that were purged by busy body people. After that toons got real boring to me for a long while.

4571828,4,B00553KAK2,"As a kid I loved this show.  Still do because of the Alex Toth character designs and the great use of the Jonny Quest underscore by Hoyt Curtin.  My only issue with this and a lot of the HB releases of their classic super hero shows is that they are incomplete in a few ways.  Little ways, yes, but to us fans, it's often frustrating.  Opening scenes are cut from all of the episodes in this set.  There should be a little scene setting up the first story of each episode before the opening credits.  You can notice the absence when some of the stories, after the title card, already have one of the Herculoids in danger.  Also, the running time of each show varies from 19 1/2 minutes to 21 minutes, showing that the opening scenes varied in length.  The second story in each episode has it's teaser scene intact. Also missing are the commercial bumpers, which are fun, and which you can watch on Youtube.  Overall, though, a fun set for us Late Boomer kids.",1373587200,2,959,4.372881355932203

4571835,4,B00553KAK2,"I am a big fan of The Herculoids and always have enjoyed their adventures. Part of my love for the series is because I immediately saw that their creation was partly influenced by THE FANTASTIC FOUR! All of the Non-human characters have the powers of the FF and yes, Tara and Zander actually resemble Sue and Reed, although Zander has a little Captain America in him, too! Just thought I'd toss that in as I haven't seen the resemblace mentioned by other commentators.

Also, is this TRULY the Complete series? Or just those episodes from the 1960s? Does this collection include the later episodes from the early 1980s? I thought the original series had better music, but in the 1980s incarnation, TARA was more involved in the stories, often flying on the back of Zok, The Flying Dragon--and NOT just in the closing credits either!",1368921600,,832,4.7379310344827585

4571851,5,B00553KAK2,"For me The Herculoids is part of what I consider a golden age of cartoons.  That golden era also includes Bugs Bunny and his pals, the Spiderman '67 series, The Pink Panther show, and some of the other classics from Hanna Barbera.  What all those series have in common is great characters, artwork, sound effects, voices, and music.  There's been some other good animated series that have come out since that time but for me the above are still the best.

One series that I don't think they've released on DVD yet is Hanna Barbera's Fantastic 4 which must certainly be up in the top 5 greatest cartoons of all time.  It see they finally released Frankenstein Jr. last year.

The Herculoids and The Fantatistic 4 have two of the prettiest girls that have ever appeared in cartoon history.  One is Zandor's wife Tara who wears a dress that is only held together by a few strategically placed threads and the other is Sue Richards, the Invisible Girl.  The Superman and Batman animated series from Warner Brothers also have a lot of pretty girls including Lois Lane and Batgirl.

Besides Zandor probably the most valuable members of the Herculoids team are Gleep and Gloop, the fearless formless wonders.  Their abilities are very versatile and have never been duplicated by any of the bad guys.

I don't know if The Herculoids is shown on TV anymore and even if it is it may get butchered by the TV stations so they can cram a few more seconds of commercials in.  I saw an episode of Bug Bunny one time where they screwed it all up in an attempt to edit out what I guess was considered too violent.  Any kid who is stupid enough to watch Bugs Bunny and then do what they see Daffy Duck do deserves to get killed.

Either the Herculoids have to save a weaker people from bullies, or some idiot decides it would be cool to mess around with the Herculoids.  Either way, the Herculoids win, usually by smashing, blasting, melting, and/or squeezing.

There's no ""origin"" story.  Why does Xandar and his family control these animals?  Are these species native to the Herculoid's planet?  Why does Xandar jump off screen, land in a new screen, bounce back and forth between vertical vines like an idiot, then spring off screen again every time he leaves somewhere without a monster companion?  Can Tara do ANYTHING?  Why does Xandar allow his son Dorno call him by his first name rather than ""dad""?

4571855,5,B00553KAK2,"First, I wish to extend grateful thanks to the other posters, especially A. Gammill, for their synopses of this durable animated series.  This allows me to get to the theme of my review - the reason for the original (not the diluted '80s version) Herculoids' success - excellent teamwork.

  Each of the five Quasarian creatures (the laser-emitting flying dragon Zok, the mighty granite gorilla Igoo, the multilegged, energy-rock shooting ceratopsian-like Tantro, and the versatile protoplasmic blobs Gloop and Gleep) by themselves were a powerhouse and could handle an army single-handedly (single-pawedly?).  But under the expert control of their leader Zandar (with capable wife Tara and son Dorno), they operate together like a fluid sports car, combining their splendid powers to infiltrate, scatter, defeat, and repel ANY enemy rash enough to invade their beloved Quasar.  The A-Team has nothing on them.  Just watching these creatures work together for a common, noble cause was immensely enjoyable.

  I agree with posters who argue that it's time for some Hollywood big-budget director to bring ""The Herculoids"" to glorious life.  The blockbuster elements are all there (compelling characters, fantastic monsters, destructive battles, plottings, schemings).  What are they waiting for?  Only one suggestion: any movie adaptation should include an origin story - how Zandor and family encountered the Herculoids, how they bonded with them, and how they trained them to be a top-notch fighting team.

4571860,5,B00553KAK2,"Before there was cable television, with kid friendly channels like Disney, Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon, the only way kids (like me) could get their fill of animated TV shows, was Saturday mornings.  Every weekend, the big 3 networks (ABC, CBS and NBC) loaded up their Saturday morning programming slots with animated shows that would begin around 6:00AM and last until noon.  In the 60's, Saturday morning cartoons were dominated by ""super hero"" themed shows  primarily due to the growing popularity of the characters appearing in the Marvel Comics line of (comic) books and the prime time ABC (network)  hit ...... ""Batman"", which ran on 2 consecutive evenings each week. Literally over night, animated shows that were once dominated by wise cracking, talking animals like Bugs Bunny, Mighty Mouse, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Atom Ant, Ruff and Reddy, Secret Squirrel, Yogi Bear, Rocky and Bullwinkle, etc., were shoved aside to make room for super hero themed shows.  Since I was an avid comic book reader during this time period, I found myself in a perfect storm of entertainment.

The Amazing Spider-Man and The Fantastic Four were Marvel Comics Saturday morning offering.  DC Comics gave us The Adventures of Superman, which not only featured the title character, but also showed stories featuring other DC heroes such as Superboy and his ""super dog"", Krypto, as well as Aquaman and Batman.  The TV networks created their own (super hero) characters and featured them in their own Saturday morning shows.  That group included:  Space Ghost and Dino Boy, The Herculoids, The Impossibles and Frankenstein Junior. Shazzan!,  Johnny Quest, Mightor and Moby Dick .  The Lone Ranger and Tonto also reappeared in animated form, but this time in a ""Wild, Wild West"" type show that featured  maniacal  villains capable of creating killer robots and other sorts of diabolical devices capable of wiping out entire towns.

What all of the above (chatter) is leading to is ...... these great shows, I grew up watching, are now available again for viewing on DVDs, minus the advertisements aimed at kids.  (Yes, silly rabbit......Trix ARE FOR kids).

 I still find these shows are very entertaining and fun to watch.  Each show runs approximately 30 minutes, so they make for a nice way to end the evening so I will usually watch 1 of 2 shows right before going to sleep.  The good guys always win.  The bad guys are vanquished and for a a half hour or so, it's Saturday morning, I'm 12 years old again, the weekend is just starting, and all is right in my world.",1329264000,4,2557,4.927570093457944
4571861,5,B00553KAK2,"Back in the mid to late 60's and 70's Hanna-Barbera was releasing some phenomenal cartoons. The list is too long to start naming them with some of my personal favorites being ""The Herculoids"", ""Jonny Quest"", ""Space Ghost"", ""Mightor"", ""Valley Of The Dinosaurs"", the best ""Fantastic Four"" cartoon ever created, ""Frankenstein Jr."", ""Young Samson"", ""Scooby Doo Where Are You?"", ""Shazzan"", ""Clue Club"", ""Wheelie and The Chopper Bunch"", ""Birdman"". I was born and the late 60's and grew up with these amazing cartoons. With Filmation and Krofft coming along in the 70's, Hanna-Barbera still remained unchallenged. Here is my Top 5 cartoons ever created (not in order): ""Speed Racer"", ""Jonny Quest"", ""The Herculoids"", ""X-Men"" (90's version by Saban) and ""Voltron"" with ""Transformers"" and ""Robotech"" coming in close. ""The Herculoids"" (with the exception of the 80's episodes) is a cartoon that can never be duplicated or even remade for that matter. The feel of this cartoon is incredible. The action scenes are epic. The creatures are amazing. It is with much gratitude that I give thanks to Warner Brothers for releasing these legendary classics. If I have to order these one at a time, I will. Hanna-Barbera, Trans-Lux, Ultraman, Filmation and Krofft define my childhood. ""Land Of The Lost"" was incredible. I routinely put on these classics for my children to watch. And I tell them ""THESE are cartoons"". There were some really good 80's cartoons like ""Thundercats"", ""Thundarr"", ""Voltron"", ""Tranzor-Z"", ""G.I. Joe"", ""Transformers"", ""Smurfs"", ""Robotech"", ""Spider-man and His Amazing Friends"" and the ""Super Friends"" (even though this debuted in the late 70's). ""The Herculoids"" is a MUST-BUY!!!

And Gods help you if you accidentally landed on their planet.  A very dangerous place to be, and oddballs showing up constantly to take it over for some reason.  Must be some prime real estate.

Now some may say The Herculoids are no different to todays mainly violent products. I would beg to disagree. The Herculoids violence was no different from that seen in the Looney Tunes 'toons, what you would call cartoon violence, lots of explosions lots of conflict but nothing you could take seriously...just a lot of fun.

Difference is that The Herculoids is a more serious affair, though much about it is very tongue in cheek, with some quite marvelous beastly characters supporting the Quasar based family against a large number of equally marvelous protagonist beasties.

For me this was the end of the age of fun cartoons, though the later rise of The Simpsons and Futurama thankfully started to bring some fun back in more recent years.

I should have pre-ordered this yesterday when it was $23.99, instead of just adding it to my shopping cart.  (I think it was 40% off).
I know that today (23 AUG) the price sprang up to $35.99 and discount of 10%.  Oh well, that's what Blockbuster is for.",1314057600,6,316,4.508771929824562

That said, the plots of each episode were basically the same: bizarre invaders from outer or inner space try to take over the planet Quasar.  These attempts at planetary domination are foiled by Zandor, his wife Tara, their son Dorno, and their assortment of super-powered animals.

There's no need to explain the creatures' powers inasmuch as others have done so.  It can only added that the series' creators came up with some highly original creations.

Much of the show's appeal also comes from the use of themes composed by Hoyt Curtin for ""Jonny Quest"" as well as original compositions, including one of the most exciting opening themes ever created for series television.  His arrangements are excitingly fitting for a sci-fi-adventure and often incorporate jazzy themes that add to audiophile's pleasure.

The sound effects are also another of the show's pluses.  Sci-fi fans will quickly recognize sounds ""borrowed"" from George Pal's ""War of the Worlds,"" as well as from other sci-fi staples.

Thankfully, Warner's chose not to include the 11 episodes from the 1981 revitalization.  That much-inferior show suffered from ""watering down"" of the violence  making it more ""kid friendly,"" a weak score, and even more ""limited"" animation.

The DVD compilation only has one extra: a brief documentary on the making of the series.  The discs are easy to navigate, allowing the viewer to ""play all"" or individual episodes.  There are no subtitles, English or otherwise.

With Hollywood searching its archives to ""reboot"" old movies and television shows, the time is right to take a look at ""The Herculoids.""  If any show deserves the big-screen treatment, it's this 60's series.

Just think what computer animation can do with Zok's laser blasts or Gloop and Gleep's transformations!",1313539200,37,1856,5.174496644295302
4571871,5,B00553KAK2,"As much as I dug Space Ghost, the Herculoids were simply my favorite mid-60's cartoon!  There was nothing like it (then or now).  Individually strong, together invincible - and they functioned as a unit!

Simply the best (I'm 7-9 years old again - well, almost)!

Thanks for finally releasing this, I've only waited 43 years!

I rate ""Herculoids: The Complete Series""...Five stars!",1311897600,56,381,5.080645161290323
4571872,4,B00553KAK2,"I've always thought that Hanna-Barbara's THE HERCULOIDS (1967-1969) not only had one of the coolest names ever, but was possibly the greatest concept for a Saturday Morning adventure cartoon ever devised.

Zantor (Mike Road) is something of an intergalactic Tarzan, living on the jungle planet Quasar with his mate, Tarra (Virginia Gregg) and son, Dorno (Ted Eccles). Unfortunately, their home appears to be the target of choice for every evil being in the universe (it's never explained why), and they are constantly besieged by armies of alien invaders, equipped with the most advanced weapon technology in the cosmos. Although this family of tree-dwellers would appear to be seriously outmatched, Zantor and his family have five secret weapons: a giant stone ape named Igoo, a flying, laser-firing dragon called Zok, an armored, ten-legged rhino/triceratops creature named Tundro, and two, shape-shifting, sentient bags of protoplasm, Gloop and Gleep. Whenever their lush jungle homeworld is threatened, these heroic monsters team up to defend Quasar and make short work of their interstellar enemies.

Extremely popular (it was repeated on the networks well into the late 70s and on cable for decades after that), and fondly remembered by those who grew up with it during their childhoods, THE HERCULOIDS is a great action/adventure cartoon - and how could it not be? A space Tarzan, heroic monsters, hordes of cool alien, robots and flying saucers/rocketships - it's got everything!

Each episode is made up of two ten-minute stories, and they're all pretty much the same, with minor variations. That repetitiveness means that the show does not lend itself to prolonged watching in single sittings - but then, it was never intended to be watched that way in the first place. Still, despite the repetitive nature of the plots, the incredible character and creature designs of comic book artist Alex Toth help keep it fresh. The man's imagination was boundless, and the variety of alien menaces that he came up with was astounding.

Long desired by fans, THE HERCULOIDS have finally made it to DVD courtesy of the Warner Archives manufactured-on-demand service. All 18 episodes of the original 60s series are included on 2 discs, presented in their original 1.33:1 ""full-frame"" television aspect ratio. The transfers are acceptable but not outstanding, with faded colors on some episodes, scattered occurrences of print damage like scratches and specks, and fairly omnipresent grime. In other words, no restoration or remastering appears to have been done, and these episodes look pretty much the same as they have in reruns for years. Audio is a clear but flat Dolby Digital mono. There is one extra: a brief retrospective featurette that previously appeared on Warner's SATURDAY MORNING CARTOONS: THE 1960s disc.

If you're a fan of 60s Hanna-Barbara adventure cartoons - and/or this cartoon in particular - the Warner Archive edition of THE HERCULOIDS is long overdue, and should make a welcome addition to your DVD library, despite the less than stellar presentation and slightly high price. It appears to be complete, and none of the various image imperfections seriously impair the viewing experience. If you're not already a fan, I still recommend it - but bear in mind that all 18 episodes (36 stories) are almost exactly the same. The real enjoyment of THE HERCULOIDS comes from the endlessly imaginative characters/creatures and the comforting familiarity of the plot(s).

Personally, I love it and am thrilled to have it on DVD. Recommended.",1310688000,6,3555,5.239015817223199
4571873,5,B00553KAK2,"This is a really fun show to watch but makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Why are Zandor and his family living on a planet by themselves and their ""monster"" buddies? Don't they want to have any friends! Will Dorno get a girl friend if there is no one there. Why are they always under attack by some nasty sadistic maniac. How did they become buddies with the Herculoids anyway? I love Igoo whose solution to every problem is to bash it into submission! My other favorites are Gloop and Gleep.

It gets even more absurd for example there is an episode where people from the ""future"" come to destroy Zandor and his friends. Now why would someone from the future want to destroy people from the past? Aren't they gone already; what is the point!

It is so weird that I love it!",1308787200,5,777,4.426573426573427
