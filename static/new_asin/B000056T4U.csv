7932673,4,B000056T4U,"This is a decent Survival primer video, with useful information for the beginner.  It glosses over many survival techniques, and gives insights on how things are done and why.

They could have gone into more detail on some of the techniques presented, but overall, this is a worthwhile purchase.",1242691200,,295,5.0
7932674,3,B000056T4U,"This DVD is a pretty nice starter for wilderness survival. entertaining to watch the cheesy scripted dialogue. It gets 1 1/2 stars off for lacking humility- but it is watchable and has some great info.

Other than that, most of the methods are unpractical in a survival situation, synthetic materials are almost always used in the aid of fire making and shelter building.

There are a few valuable bits, there is a segment on making traps, and making fire by friction which could be applied. There is also an extensive speech by a medical expert, with many valuable tips.

If your new to survival, save your money for something like the Ray Mears programs, Ron Hoods Woodsmaster series, and Survivorman is an entertaining show. This DVD is still recommended. 3 1/2 stars.",1185840000,,771,4.825757575757576
7932675,3,B000056T4U,"Well, this isn't a bad DVD. I believe it was originally published as ""17 Ways to Build a Fire Without a Match."" The fire starting techniques are great but everything else is right out of any exhaustive survival book. So, the main focus is on fire starting. If the price is under $10 it's a worth while buy in that aspect.

On the other hand, if you into survival stuff checkout the Ray Mears DVD's. Excellent material. Ray goes to all corners of the world and stays out in the elements to show you it can be done, even the arctic. You may have to get these DVD's on the Amazon.uk site and they may be in PAL format.",1172448000,,615,4.168067226890757
7932676,2,B000056T4U,"I write this having some prior camping/adventure expieriences over the years and I got this dvd thinking it would be a good refresher ""course"". Although it covered all of the basic concerns of survival, it was not very organized and all topics left out details that could be important. I would like to see (or even make) a series of dvd's that show a survival expierience in detail involving different environments. Survivorman is a good concept (and is entertaining) but he could take that a step further in details. I think this dvd could be a good boy scout resource, but it was not for me. I will probably try to resell it.",1170720000,3,627,4.557522123893805
7932677,4,B000056T4U,"I love learning, so wanted to see what people really do when in a pinch. This gives several ways to get shelter, make a fire, signal for help (mirrors work further distances then lights or smoke in daylight), some basics on injuries, sample of what foods to eat & which to avoid & more. They show you what you need in a kit or what to use in nature including some indigenous methods. I surprisingly wasn't bored at all & like another said, there's so much info, I will watch again to soak it in more.",1129075200,4,500,4.21875
7932678,3,B000056T4U,You get about what you pay for.  Some interesting tips.  Nothing ground breaking here just some basics.  Not much help if you're really in a pinch and didn't bring your pre-made kit with you.,1102204800,,191,4.5588235294117645
7932679,3,B000056T4U,I enjoyed this DVD. It was simple but you need to watch it more than once to get everything down. The fire making processes were in my opinion the most informative. I only wish that they spent more time on food gathering practices. This is a great compliment to the wonderful book Field Guide to Edible Wild Plants : Eastern and central North America (Peterson Field Guides). It can be found here at Amazon as well. This DVD is helpful for the avid primitive camper or the paranoid traveler that fears crashing in a remote area. Learn and enjoy!,1097193600,6,545,4.515151515151516
7932680,5,B000056T4U,"I am an assistant scoutmaster for a high-adventure scout troop in Texas. This is the best single-tape survival video I have seen. We have watched it several times in our scout meetings, and each time we come away with something new that we learned. Unless you are looking for a multi-tape detailed surval video series, this is the tape to have. Also it fits the scout survival merit badge curriculem exceedingly well.",1049932800,13,417,4.805555555555555
