8591015,5,B000IZJQYS,I love this movie. Everytime I watch this movie I love it. My kid love it too. They have become a big Amitabh fan after watching this movie.,1302393600,,140,4.035714285714286
8591016,1,B000IZJQYS,"I had the same problem as the other reviewer and told Amazon and they sent yet another copy of the DVD with the same problem, the cover is correct, the disc print is correct, the data for the movie ON the disc is for Deewaar 2004. The original 1975 Deewaar Directed by Yash Chopra is what it should be. Great movie, pity that Amazon cannot sort this problem out. They are the best out there!",1234915200,3,391,4.226666666666667
8591017,1,B000IZJQYS,"This movie is misleading:  The cover image and star list, as well as the plot synopsis suggest that this is Deewaar(1975).  However, the film is Deewar(2004) which is described in the editorial review.  The DVD case is likewise confusing, with the incorrect cover image, but correct summary on the back.  Both star Amitabh Bachchan.  Confusing! Make sure you are buying the film that you intended to!!

(as a side note, I have not watched this film (2004 version) yet, so I don't know how it rates!)",1177545600,5,499,4.744186046511628
