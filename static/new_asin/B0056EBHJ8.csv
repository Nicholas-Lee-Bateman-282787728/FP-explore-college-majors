4587958,4,B0056EBHJ8,"Have you ever thought that when a band breaks up and the lead singer goes solo, something is lost?  That's how I felt about this DVD.  It's entertaining for a car guy, but it is not so much an extension of Top Gear UK as just a side note.  Jeremy seems to have less spark in this flick than he brings to the regular show.  The automotive hardware is impressive and still a lot of fun, but I think overall it would have been better if all three presenters had been there.  If nothing else, it proves the formula of Top Gear requires three presenters, not just one, no matter how Jeremy he is.",1342656000,,591,4.149122807017544

8459467,5,B0056EBHJ8,Jeremy Clarkson. A television presenter. He drives cars. He talks about them.,1414454400,,77,5.5
8459468,5,B0056EBHJ8,It kind of irritates me that he has such a great job. What awesome cars! I am a speed junkie and would love to drive any one of these cars!,1398729600,,139,3.6666666666666665
8459469,4,B0056EBHJ8,"Exactly what the title implies, Clarkson takes us on a grand tour of some beautiful machinery available circa 2008 and has a ball trying to discuss which is the best. The cars look gorgeous and very expensive and the tracks they are blasting around on also look like a drivers delight.

While this is all perfectly vacuous it is also entertaining. Some curve balls are thrown in for good measure as some less than stellar supercars are looked at and Clarkson is his usual caustic self when openly discussing problems with cars that, for the price, you'd think should have no problems at all.

Of course nobody is really going to use this DVD as a buying guide and with the passing of time these cars recede into the distance anyway. But that isn't the point, the point is to entertain rev-heads. And DVD does this easily.",1398384000,,821,4.578231292517007
8459470,5,B0056EBHJ8,"Once again Jeremy does a great job in describing how the cars sound and feel, while with his vast knowledge of cars and his quick wit he informs and entertains us.",1373673600,,163,4.290322580645161
8459471,5,B0056EBHJ8,"Being as I am a huge petrohead (and track geek), I love almost everything Jeremy does.  The cars are awesome.",1360800000,,109,4.45
8459472,4,B0056EBHJ8,Another great present for someone who already has everything and loves Top Gear.. also a great price.  Who wouldn't love Jeremy?,1360195200,,128,5.095238095238095
