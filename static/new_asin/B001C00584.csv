8285393,4,B001C00584,"Clipping Adam is a very moving story about a 14 years old boy dealing with an incredible loss. One that no one can truly understand unless they've gone through it themselves. The story takes place 2 years after the accident and shows a still very grieving family headed in the wrong direction. Adam on the verge of high school, needs to turn a corner, and attempts to do so with the help of a new best friend and a priest. It didn't sound very appealing to me either, but I decided to give it a shot and I am sure glad I did. Evan Peters is terrific in his debut performance. This movie is heart felt, genuine, and real. It showed me the best way to get over your problems, no matter how big or small is with the help of others. Hiding away and drinking, or not cutting your hair is never the answer. A truly inspiration film, with no Hollywood influence or unwanted story-lines. I highly recommend it!",1361664000,,902,4.311764705882353
8285394,5,B001C00584,"A well-done, heartwarming story about a jr. high school boy grieving the death of his mother and little sister in his own way. It's sometimes funny and always genuine as he is befriended, hassled, helped, and ignored by the people in his life. For those who know Evan Peters only as Tate and Kit on American Horror Story, it's a chance to see him at the start of his acting career, in another sensitive performance, as a 15-year old trying to come to terms with tragedy and honor his mother's and sister's memories.",1352246400,3,515,4.548387096774194

8285397,3,B001C00584,"Clipping Adam is a family film about a young teen boy's attempt to deal with a family tragedy, yet still fit with his peer group.  There is conflict with an older teen bully who tries to forcibly make Adam cut his rather untidy hair.

The conflict with the bully is resolved and Adam attains increased maturity and demonstrates it by having his hair clipped to prepare for school.",1266192000,6,380,4.573529411764706
8285398,5,B001C00584,"Clipping Adam
Despite what he says, Adam is not ""fine"". The summer before freshman year should be a time full of possibilities, but Adam struggles with a dad that is drunk, due to the fact that he can't deal with the death of his wife and daughter from a auto accident. Adam has not cut his hair for 2 years, and deals with a high school bully that hates long hair. Fortunately, Adam finds help from friends, a catholic priest, and his grandmother.  I found the ending very different than expected.",1263945600,17,498,4.472527472527473
