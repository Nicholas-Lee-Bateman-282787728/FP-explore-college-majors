195103,5,1573628174,The black people in the movie were exploited to my unsatisfaction.  There should have been more exploiting and more Leprechaun.  His lines were superb and matched those of young Ernest Hemingway.  There should be more  Leprechauns because those of us that don't fit in need more role models.  Pirates forever.

195107,5,1573628174,"If you're a fan of the ""Leprechaun"" series, or like campy horror in general, this movie is a MUST RENT!  The second-best in the series, in my opinion (nothing can top the original), this movie boasts a story which  has been told a million times over:  inner city youth struggling to get out  of the projects come close to having their dreams come true, only to have  their worlds fall apart at the hands of an evil Leprechaun.  Classic stuff.  It's kind of like ""Friday"" with a Leprechaun thrown in the mix.  Lots of slapstick comedy throughout this one, and a few more hilarious  firsts for the Leprechaun as he immerses himself into the seedy urban  underworld.  The ending boasts a scene that is way beyond cheesy, but has  to be seen to be believed.  The story actually wasn't THAT weak, but it  also wasn't so involved that it deprived me of what I was paying to see -  the evil Leprechaun in all sorts of ridiculous situations.  Ice-T was  entertaining as well as ""Mack Daddy"", the gangsta rap producer  who owes all of his success to a magic flute he stole from the Lep over a  decade before.  Highly recommended for fans of the series and people who  generally like ""dumb but funny"" stuff.  If you're looking for a  serious horror flick, go rent Halloween.",954374400,8,1264,4.495575221238938

195124,5,1573628174,"I started watching the Leprechaun movies on a lark over a decade ago. A friend and I would just pop in a VHS when we'd meet up and just talk over the boring or slow parts. So first, I have to say that the best way to watch these movies is in chronological order. If you do, this one by leaps and bounds is everything you could possibly expect from the series. We really didn't know what to expect about this strangley-titled one. This really lived up to its potential. It had all of the scenes you could possibly hope for and more. Think about what a dated, racist, offensive, gorey, B-movie about an evil leprechaun who murders people and only talks in limericks could possibly contain in it. Yes. That scene was in there. Every scene that should have been in there was in there. **SPOILER ALERT** The Leprechaun even becomes a pimp in this one and raps. **END SPOILER**

Your expectations should probably not be that this is Oscar bait - what the hell is wrong with you. It's called Leprechaun: In the Hood. This movie is the essence of the Leprechaun series. If you don't want to make the investment and learn the Leprechaun mythology by watching the earlier ones, I can understand that. But this one really felt like a sucker-punch of awesomeness.

This is either one of those movies you get or you don't. A movie can actually be incredibly bad and still an awesome movie. I can't believe the stuff they got away with in this one.",1417132800,,1434,4.448669201520913

195139,5,1573628174,"LEPRECHAUN
IN THE HOOD

I will admit right here and now that I am a huge Leprechaun fan and proudly own all of the films in the series. From the first with Jen all the way to the second Hood flick after this one, I enjoy them all. This one in particular is really fun because not only is The Lep in the Hood but Ice T is also here and joining in on the fun. I ask you this question, what could be better than that?

Three young rappers who are trying to make it big and get out of their neighborhood can't really make out why they are falling behind on their dream. It may be because they are trying for a positive message, well that is if you believe everyone else around them. That is until they break into Mac Daddy's office [Ice T] and find a flute and accidentally release the Leprechaun. He had been turned to stone by Mac Daddy years earlier when he took flute. The flute helps the boys as it makes everyone listen and love their music, but it draws the Lep towards them more and more. So now they are on the run from both the Leprechaun and Mac Daddy as well. Just another day in the hood.

I can't help it I am a sucker for these types of B movies; there is just something about them that make me think of a happier time. This series in particular was just always fun because of Warwick and his performance. Of course none of them were every really scary but the dark humor in these and the crazy kills always entertain. This one in particular is really funny because now not only is the Lep rhyming but he is also rapping. Of course I also like that Bad Azz from the DPG makes a cameo appetence here in this film as does Coolio.

Directed by Rob Spera who also made the first ""Witchcraft"" and ""Bloody Murder 2"" keeps things moving nicely and the film never feels long or anything. And the guys playing the wanna be rappers do an excellent job in this movie and are well cast. Ice T of course is the man as he always is, and Warwick holds it down as the Leprechaun. If I had to break it down into one statement it would be if you love B horror flicks then this is for you.",1363824000,,2081,4.068292682926829

195142,5,1573628174,"Okay this movie is a hilarious and fun horror trip, you have awesome actor/rapper ( Ice T ) who with a friend in an underground subway line break through a wall in search of a magical golden flute that can control peoples minds when played. They find more then that they also find the pot of gold and the leprechaun ( Warick Davis ) who was turned into a statue thanks to the 4 leaf clover necklace around his neck. Ice T's friend takes it off and the little monster is free again but during a struggle and as luck would have it the necklace that was sent flying during the struggle lands on the little devil right around his neck turning him into a statue again

Later on three young rappers seeking to get a recording contract go to Ice T aka Mack Daddy who has since become a big time record producer, they do clean positive rap but boss man Ice T wants them to perform hardcore nasty stuff. While there they see the leprechaun inside a glass case sitting on the floor. They don't want to do hardcore rap there is a disagreement then they leave. Late at night the three break into Mack Daddy's office to rob it while searching the glass case is broken and the leprechaun is set loose upon the earth he reaks bloody havoc and leaves a trail of bodies in his quest to retrieve his flute and gold, the leprechaun and Ice T wind up in a battle, and trying to survive the boys wind up in a life and death battle against Mack Daddy, and the leprechaun

During his search the leprechaun goes to a neighborhood where he is introduced to new things reefer being one of them and the little devil smokes marijuana loves it and get's stoned he is hilarious. He also has his own harem made up of the sexiest prostitutes in the neighborhood under his control. High on weed he is a fun loving joking holy terror, and one lecherous lusting little dude, this film also features some great rap music, at the end the leprechaun/Warick Davis performs a rap piece that is really quite good while the girls dance,

I strongly suggest when watching this comic horror masterpiece make sure you aren't drinking anything because you will be laughing so hard it will fly out of your mouth ( Leprechaun Back To The Hood ) is good and it's actors are top notch but I favor this one. I am very happy with this",1336608000,,2282,4.314685314685315
195143,5,1573628174,This movie was another I couldn find in my town and we had to have it to finish the collection of my bf's. It was just as interesting and funny as the others. we watched it many times over so above all another great buy.,1334188800,,220,3.911111111111111
195144,2,1573628174,"The fifth in the increasingly ridiculous ""Leprechaun"" series, ""Leprechaun in the Hood"" goes where no other movie ever dreamed to go before. That originality garnered the movie a bonus star in my rating, but make no mistake, this is a tough slog no matter how big a fan of Leprechauns, Irish superstitions, rap, Ice-T, or Coolio (!) you may be. The film opens with a terrible poem (""No one is safe from a Lep in the hood!"") and immediately flashes back to the 1970s with Ice-T (as ""Mack Daddy"") and another hood in stupendously hilarious afros (not to mention the clothes and shoes) getting in a fight with Warwick Davis who is reprising his diminutive role as a brogue-spewing menace, this time with the bonus of rap being thrown in the mix. I very much enjoyed the opening fight scene, particularly the novel use of an afro pick. The scene sets up the rest of the film as Mack Daddy gains the Leprechaun's magic flute that can mesmerize people, as well as the Leprechaun himself who is perfectly inert as long as his necklace is on.

Fast forward to 2000 and Mack Daddy is now an urban kingpin and rap mogul. He is stereotypically nasty, which is why it's odd that three aspiring rappers headed by ""Postmaster P"" (A.T. Montgomery; the ""P"" is for ""positive"" as they only do life-affirming rap...ponder) pursue him to get a record deal. You see they need money to buy musical gear to go to a contest in Las Vegas. (Now there's a business plan!) The positive intents don't get them far, as they steal Mack Daddy's flute and unlock the Leprechaun, which results in a flurry of ridiculous subplots and dialogue (Davis even fires off a Tiger Woods joke!) Please enjoy Ice-T and the Leprechaun getting wasted in a public bathroom, a wholly unexpected tribute to ""Goldfinger,"" a particularly horrifying dancing restaurateur, a long and pointless cross-dressing component, a blind grandma, a genuinely offensive depiction of a sanctuary church (totally unsatisfactory in every conceivable way,) and a rapper who is also conveniently a chemical engineer (right...) all leading up to that comic payoff: Leprechaun in the fridge (which could perhaps be another in the series now that I think of it...it wouldn't be more boring.)

I didn't find a sympathetic character in the lot, and the faster the Irish terror could dispatch everyone the better as far as I was concerned. I did enjoy the plan deduced from reading ""Leprechauns for Dummies"" (hint: it involves smoking four leaf clovers,) though I did not enjoy the terrible conclusion involving Postmaster P and the Leprechaun in a brogue-riddled rhyming contest, which segues into some of the most painful closing credits in memory.

The trailer is the only significant extra, and I would advise simply watching that and throwing the DVD away. You'll get the idea and it will be a lot less painful. There are a few entertaining concepts in the film and the plot is audacious to say the least. I don't recommend ""Leprechaun in the Hood"" as the entertaining scenes are few and far between and the interstitial space is a long and harrowing road.",1330992000,2,3084,4.804143126177024
195145,2,1573628174,I love Leprechaun but this movie is boring. This is the worst one yet. Ice t is barley in it and he doesnt do much any way,1300492800,,122,3.5555555555555554
195146,1,1573628174,"Meaningless National Holidays are the best, aren't they? We, Sid the Elf, certainly think so. They give us the chance to, among other things, watch a ton of B and consume a copious ammount of food. If there is a better combination, other than the trifecta, Sid has yet to find it. So, we decided to honor Christopher Columbus in the best way possible by double-dipping B and getting some unbelievable Italian take-out to honor the famous Italian explorer. The first selection was Leprechaun in the Hood. We can admit that we got suckered in by even the slightest possibility of seeing the leprechaaun(Sid's Irish cousin) chase Ice-T around with a pink turkey baster. Well, that didn't happen. So we were disappointed by that and by the film overall.

This film started with a scene set in the 70's. Ice-T's character Mack Daddy(lots of thought went into that one) and an equally fro'ed buddy went on a treasure hunt in the cave of the Irish elf. They take the necklace from around the leprechaun's neck which awakens him from his state of stone. The leprechaun procedes to stab Ice-T's buddy in the throat with a 'fro pick and he attempts to kill Ice-T, but honestly, who hasn't? Anyway, Ice manages to get the necklace back onto Irish Sid's neck and turn him back to stone after stealing the leprechaun's magical flute that mesmerizes anyone who hears it. Then we flash-forward to the present(2000) where Mack Daddy is a big-shot record producer, presumably due largely to his magical flute. One of the groups eager to catch Mack Daddy's eye and play his flute were three complete wackbags from Compton. Now, this flick took the early 90's Compton thing and tried to make it play in 2000. This probably wouldn't have worked even if the group in question here wasn't trying to convey a positive message using a ""gangsta rap"" style. Not surprisingly, Mack Daddy didn't sign the three cool cats. So, they decide to rob/trash Mack Daddy's house. In the course of the robbery, Mack Daddy takes a bullet and the leprechaun, who is in stone form sitting in a glass case in Mack Daddy's office is freed. Also, the rappers take Mack Daddy's flute. So these three now have Ice-T and the leprechaun chasing after them in order to get the flute back. The guys then decide to hide out with a drag queen, take a few pointers then cross-dress, themselves as Sid is quite sure they had previously done many times. They end up using the flute to proceed in the rap world and...ok we'll be honest, we started fast-forwarding at this point because even we couldn't take it anymore. We only stopped at two points in the rest of the movie. One was when we spotted Coolio(yep, he was available) and decided to throw some easy jokes his way. The other was undoubedly the highlight of this movie and probably all of the Leprechaun movies. The Leprechaun burned a unit. Really, just a holistic, watershed moment in Sid's B-watching life.

What we really don't understand is how this film went wrong. There was an elf as the main character with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Surviving-the-Game/dp/B000031EG1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Surviving the Game</a>&nbsp;alum Ice-T as a major focal point. Coolio even made an apperance which led to a ton of good cracks. Running the risk of sounding inarticulate, this movie was just plain stupid. The rappers were unbelievably unlikable and they reeked of ""If this isn't my big break, I have 50 years of Mickey D'd ahead of me"" desperation. The plot was ridiculous with the inexplicable cross-dressing/drag queens. And there wasn't enough leprechaun. Irish Sid was only in about a half of the film. We needed to see a lot more of that little mainiac running around offing people with a potato or a magic bottle of Jameson's or something. We grew tired of the rapping and internal strife within the rap group aspect really quickly. Just a terrible film all around. Take our word for it, if we couldn't even make it through the entire film, it's utterly awful. Don't waste your time. Well, unless you'd get a kick out of seeing Irish Sid puff. That was a phenomonal 10 seconds.",1224201600,5,4138,4.851485148514851

Shows that writers sometimes can't come up with legitimate dialogue and think that everyone in the world likes to use the F word in every sentence.

Aside from that though, the leprechaun franchise is worn out.  The little leprechaun is always after his gold and the people who steal it are usually numbnuts or just simply stupid.  The rap ""music"" in this film is bland and boring; the effects dimestore quality and hopefully even though there IS still another hood movie out, we won't be subjected to any more.

195150,3,1573628174,"I am a fan of the Leprechaun series. I think the little guy is both scary and funny. Some of the movies are good, some are not so good. First of all, your common sense has to go out for a smoke while watching these films. I enjoyed 'In Space' and 'Back to the Hood'. But this one 'In the Hood' just isn't as good.

Sure it has it's moments. The film starts out promising enough with Ice T dressed like Rolo from Sanford and Son and sporting a Hendrix afro, but not even Mack Daddy can save this film.

The stereotyping is deliberate and hysterical. Who can't laugh when Lep says ""Steal me gold youlittle hoods, ye got more balls than Tiger Woods!"" Other moments of true comedy are when the blind grandmother is feeding Lep and accidently pulls his eye out with a fork, and the 'Church Rap'. The lyrics are dismal to say the least. ""Jesus loves me this I know, if He don't I'll find a hoe."" Brilliant.

Leprechaun has a lot of powers in this movie., He can make your gun heat up so that you drop it, he can make your insides explode, he can make you turn your own gun on yourself, and he does a little 'Invasion if the Body Snatchers' too. He gets his small band of ""Fly Lep cootchie girls' to do his bidding.

The plot (yes there is one) is as asinine as they come. Not only does Lep have a pot o' gold, he has a magic flute. No matter how bad your music is, just blow the flute and everyone will think it's the greatest music they've ever heard. It's every rapper's and garage band's dream come true. Three young rappers with a positive message go hard core and use the flute to go to the top. However, only one survives. He does this by dressing up like a woman. Uh, you'll have to see this part yourself.

As much as I love lep though, there's one thing that he must never, ever do again. I like to see the little guy kill and mame, but Lord, don't let him sing again.",1137456000,2,1871,4.115068493150685
195151,4,1573628174,"I have now seen everything..Irishmen and lovers of Gangsta Rap/ghetto movies now have something in common..'A Lep in Da Hood, the true O.G'..wow!! From the movie title and the fact that the Original Gangsta himself, Ice-T, stars in it, you should already realise that this is not going to be a good movie, if you expect anything else, then maybe you should cut down on that medication.
Anywhoos back to the movie, it has everything you could ask for from a low budget extravaganza, terrible acting, crass racial stereotypes, nausea inducing rapping and even worse rhyming from Da Lep. For the 'icing on the cake' you have a preposterous 'plot', which in no shape or form makes any sense whatsoever. In short this movie is atrocious, so bad that you can't help but enjoy yourself. The director is from the 1980's Sam Raimi school of movie making i.e. 'we'd like to make a scary movie, but we have a seriously low budget, so we are going to just settle for taking the piss' etc. It is hilariously bad, even more so in the rare scenes when it supposed to be serious. Thank God, there are still directors out there, who don't take themselves or their work seriously. What a great world we live in!
If you are looking for a good scare, look elsewhere, but if you consider yourself as I do, a connoisseur of bad movies, then you are in for a treat.  If you, also like myself, posses a `cringe inducing' DVD collection, the kind that you are even afraid to show to your closest relations because it is so bad, then you must buy this, otherwise your life will not be complete.",1121212800,6,1568,4.5017543859649125
195152,5,1573628174,"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS***

It has been said that good movies are merely entertaining whereas great ones alter the way we think and feel about things. Leprechaun 'N the Hood is a great movie. Writer Doug Hall had a message he wanted to convey, and thankfully he came into contact with a director the caliber of Rob Spera to help him bring it to the masses. Spera was able to relay Hall's vision in a manner that was both entertaining and touching. The reason this film resonates with the audience is due to the characters and how they develop throughout the story. The plot revolves around three aspiring rappers and their dreams of fame and fortune as their ambition leads them down a road of pain and despair. As part of their Machiavellian plot for stardom, they are reduced to robbing a famous rap producer and end up stealing a magic flute that guarantees their success in the rap world. At the same time, they also inadvertently awaken the vile leprechaun. Our first impression is that the leprechaun is an abject and detestable creature, and perhaps he is. By the end of the movie however, the viewer can't help being moved to anything but compassion for him. It isn't so much that the leprechaun evolves during the movie, it is more that the viewer evolves as the story progresses. As Leprechaun 'N the Hood unfolds, we come to accept that the deplorable leprechaun resides within all of us. We realize that everyone has a leprechaun within, it is only a matter of how well we contain it and what events could lead it to manifest itself. In the case of Postmaster P., it is his greed and ambition that unleash the Leprechaun, and we all see the horrific results. Unlike ridiculous Hollywood fodder such as ""It's a Wonderful Life"" this movie will have a profound effect on viewers because the characters are realistic. They have real faults and weaknesses, and we can truly learn about others and ourselves by understanding them. This is a movie ideal for parents to watch with their children and then discuss afterwards. From the opening scene to the heart wrenching conclusion in which the leprechaun explains his plight in a poignant rap of his own, this movie will change the way you look at yourself and those around you. As the leprechaun explains in his song ""I hate to resort so soon to magic, I haven't been la! d in so long it's tragic."" Tragic indeed.",1096329600,48,2372,4.6610978520286395
195153,4,1573628174,"Alright, this time, the Leprechaun is in the hood.

It starts off with the Leprechaun introducing the new item of magic (his flute) and then Mack (Ice T) appears. It turns out someone sold his associate a ""crappy map"", but it turns out the map was correct when Mack threw his associate through a wooden wall. He found the magic flute he desired and his associate found gold. Things go wrong when the guy takes the medallion that kept the Leprechaun frozen, though. However, Mack gets lucky.

A few years later, Mack is a rich ghetto tycoon thanks to that flute that entrances whoever hears it, and three young men are vying to get into the rap business with their brand of PSA rap. There is Post, the moralistic one, there is Butch, the intelligent one, and there is Stray, the ambitious one. In their hopes to become stars, they end up at Mack's feet, but he blows them off when they are hesitant to change to gangsta rap. Angry, they end up robbing Mack, and this starts off a chain of events that will eventually unlease the Leprechaun.

This movie is not as good as the original (are there any Leprechauns that are?), but it kept me entertained, so that's enough. It has the usual plot holes, such as why did Mack left his flute hanging around at his house when he usually carried it everywhere with him?

One thing I thought it did great was show the main characters' true colors later on. In the beginning, Post was moralistic, but his greed soon overcame him later on. On the other hand, Stray learned what greed could cost him.

Good movie and I recommend renting it at the least.",1096070400,,1588,4.462068965517242
195154,4,1573628174,"WELL, THIS ONE ACTUALLY DID IT. THIS SEQUEL SURPASSES ALL OF THE LEPRECHAUN MOVIES THAT'VE COME BEFORE IT. IN AN UNEXPECTED TWIST, THE LEPRECHAUN RETURNS, BUT THIS TIME, HE GOES AFTER A GROUP OF RAPPERS THAT'VE STOLEN HIS MAGIC FLUTE. VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE FIRST FOUR MOVIES. THIS ONE, UNLIKE THE LAST FOUR, HAS A SHARP SENSE OF HUMOR. ICE-T DOES A GREAT JOB OF PLAYING MACK DADDY, WHO IS THE SUB-VILLAIN OF THE MOVIE. NOT AS VIOLENT AS THE FIRST FOUR, BUT IT'S STILL KINDA VIOLENT. HAS SOME GREAT RAP SONGS. HELL, THE LEPRECHAUN HIMSELF EVEN RAPS AT THE END OF THIS MOVIE! A MUST-SEE FOR ALL HORROR FANS.

195155,2,1573628174,"Until we learned that another ""Leprechaun"" film would explode onto the public's consciousness at the end of 2003, ""Leprechaun in the Hood"" a.k.a ""Leprechaun 5"" appeared to be the final installment in a series that had long worn out its welcome. The first three movies weren't all that bad in terms of entertainment value, with Warwick Davis developing his shtick against the backdrop of bad acting from unknown thespians, increasingly cheesy situations, lamer jokes and sight gags, and gorier killings. The amusement value of the ""Leprechaun"" franchise came to a screeching halt with the release of the fourth film, where the miniscule fairy turned up in a film set in space with disastrous results. Apparently scared by how bad a product they had turned out, the friendly folks at Trimark waited almost four years before returning to the land of the leprechauns. The result? Y2K's ""Leprechaun in the Hood,"" an idea so outrageous, so full of pitfalls from the start that even trash cinema lovers stopped breathing for a heartbeat. Now we await the return of Davis in ""Leprechaun: Back 2 Da Hood"" and wonder where it all went wrong. Whatever it means, we are light years away from a fresh-faced Jennifer Aniston running from the malevolent monster back in the halcyon days of 1993. The phrase ""You can never go home again"" never resonated so strongly.
However pedestrian this film is, it is important to state that ""Leprechaun 5"" is vastly superior to its immediate predecessor. After watching the diminutive demon cackle his way through space, I didn't know what to expect from this film. I knew I would get some killings and see Davis deliver ham handed lines in a thick Irish brogue, but I swore I would toss my DVD player through the window before I endured a repeat of the fourth movie. Don't get me wrong: this movie still ranks as mediocrity incarnate, but it is at least watchable. Perhaps the appearance of Ice-T and the three actors who played the young rappers looking for a big break helped move this picture along. Even the guys who played the money grubbing minister and the cross dresser who has an unfortunate encounter with the leprechaun provided a few chuckles along the way. Overall, the performances here are head and shoulders above several entries in the series (look back to Bridget's wooden delivery in ""Leprechaun 2"" as a comparison).
The plot, such as it is, now finds the tiny terror once again turned to stone and vulnerable to thieving humans in search of gold. Enter Ice-T as Mack Daddy, a street thug with an Afro the size of a mountain who has heard that this statue hides some valuables. He especially wants to get his hands on a tiny golden flute that has the unique power to instantly spellbind anyone who hears it. In the course of securing the magical instrument, the leprechaun wakes up when Mack Daddy's accomplice takes a necklace off of the statue (shades of ""Leprechaun 3""). After a pitched battle that sees the pimp taking weapons out of his afro (sigh), the little imp is re-imprisoned and we flash ahead about ten or twenty years to the present day. Mack is now a big shot record producer, always on the lookout to sign hot new gangsta rappers on his label. Around his wrist he wears that magic flute he stole so many years ago, and most people have no idea where his money or his talent come from. Postmaster P, Stray Bullet, and Butch, three kids who formed a group to sing songs with a positive message, certainly don't know about Mack's magical success story. When Mack Daddy gives the three a chance at stardom, Postmaster P turns him down because he doesn't want anything to do with the negativity of gangsta rap. Mack kicks the kids out, but the three come back at night to rob his house in order to get some money so they can afford to compete in a talent competition.
Regrettably, during the course of the robbery Mack Daddy takes a bullet and the leprechaun, sitting in a glass cage in the middle of Mack's office, is once again freed to maim and kill. It turns out that Mack Daddy didn't die, but the kids stole his flute and he wants it back. So does the leprechaun, who promptly kills anyone the three rappers encounter after the robbery. The rest of the movie is a series of ridiculous situations involving these characters as they try to stay one step ahead of the others. Throw in a cross dresser, a naughty rap song about Jesus at the local church, a funny black grandmother, fly girls from hell (sigh again), an ending so incredibly stupid that I slipped into a coma after I watched it, and you have all the elements of an incredibly cheesy production that plays more like a slapstick comedy than a horror film. ""Leprechaun in the Hood"" is definitely for diehard fans of the series only. Again, at least it is better than part four.
The DVD for this movie is the same as any other Trimark ""Leprechaun"" disc: some trailers and a good picture transfer. Again, there is no commentary for the movie from Warwick Davis. You have to admit that after watching a few of these movies, you would love to hear what the lead actor has to say about his character. As bad as some of these movies have been, I really don't blame Warwick Davis for reprising his role as the leprechaun. Parts for the permanently diminutive are scarce in Hollywood, to say the least, so beating this dead horse for yet another paycheck is something I would do in similar circumstances. ""Leprechaun"" cannot last forever, can it?",1068940800,4,5456,4.654922279792746
195156,1,1573628174,"What seems like a fun idea on paper can often be a disaster when played out. Such is the case with this monstrosity of a sequel. How can you go wrong with The Leprechaun going to the hood and trading one-liners with Ice-T? Well, this movie is so packed with awful ideas and poor sterotypes that you wonder who would ever allow it to go into production? Clearly, whoever wrote it is not a fan of hip-hop nor has ever actually been to any type of urban area because they come up with ideas that members of either community would find insulting.
Ice-T is a rap mogul/gangsta with the highly original name ""Mack Daddy"" who steals the Leprechaun's flute and uses it to succeed in the rap world. Don't ask me how! A trio of lame rappers named Butch, Postmaster P, and Stray Bullet steal the flute and end up unleashing the Leprechaun. They spend most of the movie hiding out in either the church or with some goofy ""drag queen"". For some reason, the writers find quite a bit of humor in grown men dressing like woman as for reasons that make no sense, the bumbling rappers dress up like broads and go back to find Mack Daddy. If you manage to sit through this hour and a half of trash, you get rewarded with a Leprechaun rap. Doesn't that make it all worth it?
If you're a big fan of cross-dressing or some rather racist humor (Leprechaun even pokes fun at Martin Luther King), this one will blow your hair back. This has to go down as one of the dumbest horror franchise entries that I have ever seen.",1060128000,3,1496,4.327402135231317

Oh my god, and IceT pulling a baseball bat out of his afro to battle the leprachaun, the maker's of this film must have had a ball doing it.
And the three young bumbling rappers were cast perfectly for this, they excelled at creating a comical trio, sort of ghetto stooge style.

Plus, it even has the rhyme master himself, ice-T.
This is essentially the plight of the good guy rapper Postmaster P, whose music is truly horrible...that is, until he steals the leprechaun's golden flute from Mack Daddy (Ice-T).  But this leprechaun wants his flute back...and he's rapping the whole way (with a little backup vocals by the ""zombie fly girls"").
This movie was also obviously made for TV, as the transitions clearly reminisce of commercial breaks.

Well, it wasn't.
Once again, I had subjected myself to a big, steaming heap of bad.
The pacing was awkward, the jokes [weak], and the script awful.  Yet somehow, despite this movie being a veritable manure pile, there were a couple mushrooms of goodness hiding within.  Once or twice, I guffawed without ever meaning to, because a joke or two would strike home.
I think my favourite was when the rap-star[hopefuls] were corralled into singing for a church.  The lyrics went like this:
Jesus loves me, this I know
And if he don't, I'll get a ho.
Lovely!
But one or two funny bits and a handsome male cast just don't make it worth paying money for an hour and a half of mind-numbing badness.

The movie itself has a storyline that you won't see ANYWHERE else.  The special effects were surprisingly well done.  The cast was very likable.  The ending was satisfying and VERY funny.  The extras on this DVD were also nice, especially considering the small budget of the film.

Over the life span of the Leprachaun movies. We've seen him in the back woods, outerspace, now the hood! It might not be a logical step, but it makes for an oddly entertaining movie. I think the movie can be summed up by the beginning. Where the Lep is freed from frozen state and quotes ""free at last, free at last, thank God almighty I'm free at last"" with a laugh. There is a lot wrong with him quoting Martin Luther King, but it's funny! And there's quite a bit of humor people will find offensive, there are stereotypes played up, but remember it's all in fun. For a good part of this movie the lep isn't even in it. I think the 3 homies add much to it, and Ice Tee is a riot. But the Lep as always, takes the cake. We have him rapping, we have him smoking marajuana, and even a mack, with all his ladies. This is a flick you cannot take serious, and while it's humorus, it's more of an underlined offbeat humor.
