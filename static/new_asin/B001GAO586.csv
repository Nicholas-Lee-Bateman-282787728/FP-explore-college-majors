8304661,4,B001GAO586,"Great video outlining the guitar approach of Brownie McGee. The tutorial is broken into segments that allow the guitarist to learn each part separately. It is up to the player to put them all together. The lessons are all in the Key of E and A as Brownie used a capo to adjust for key signatures. Brownie was one of the last true blues men and learning his approach will add to your knowledge of the instrument. This style will force you to fingerpick and will provide some easy and fun alternatives to your playing. Your buddies are going to ask what you are doing because this approach will add a lot of tonal qualities that most living room pickers don't achieve. Check out Hans Olson out of Phoenix, Arizona for the next generation of blues plays. Hans played with Brownie during the 80's and incorporates a lot of these techniques in his music. Enjoy!",1479772800,,856,4.529032258064516

8304663,5,B001GAO586,I wanted to learn a guitar style that would sound good playing by myself. Brownies style is great to learn from. Happy goes into detail about this great bluesman and his style. I'm learning all I can about he done his songs and this breaks it down real nicely into easy to learn portions. I highly recommend Brownie Mcghee's style of playing to anyone interested in learning country blues guitar.,1407974400,,396,4.671428571428572
8304664,5,B001GAO586,Happy moves it right along. There's a lot to learn on here and he doesn't waste time getting the point across.,1370822400,,110,4.285714285714286
8304665,5,B001GAO586,"This is another excellent DVD package from Homespun. Happy Traum really showed me what it is I love so much about Brownie McGhee's playing, and having watched McGhee play Goin' To Kansas City over and over on YouTube, I'll tell you, he is spot on in his teaching. Traum does not get bogged down in what the right hand is doing, so if you're going to get this, you already need to be solid in your alternating bass. If you're familiar with the style, this is a great resource to learn some new riffs, tricks and songs.

I'd say this set is similar to Roy Book Binder's ""Blues By the Book"" DVDs, in that it approaches things from a riff-first/song-second way. With this style of guitar, that is very helpful and practical approach. This also gets you to thinking about using the same riffs in other country blues songs that you know in the same keys. Everything is in the key of E and key of A -- the two positions Brownie mostly played out of. Nothing is overly difficult for someone with good command of their righthand thumb, you'll start picking up some great riffs, turnarounds, shuffle variations, and solo ideas right away -- which was exactly what I was looking for. I'm sure I'll go back to this sometime in the future, when I feel like my playing is getting stale, and find more good ideas.

If you need help with your alternating thumb and a more basic grounding in country blues, I picked it up mainly from Stefan Grossman's DVDs, and the Happy Traum DVD on Mississippi John Hurt -- which I think is a terrific basic place to start. I am sure Traum's other DVDs, which have been mentioned here, would also be a good place to begin. I own several Homespun DVDs and Vestopol DVDs and have not yet been disappointed. I would rate this slightly more difficult than Blues By the Book, or Grossman's ""Country Blues"" series. There are some quick chord changes, so you'll want to be solid on your lefthand chording, and a few optional things that require some stretches -- but overall, I didn't find anything to be as difficult as I suspected. Maybe Happy just makes it simple, or maybe I'm just getting that good (I don't know).",1289865600,,2131,4.489690721649485
8304666,5,B001GAO586,"You can't go wrong with Homespun, this DVD is no acception. Happy Traum is an amiable and knowledgable teacher who explains the blues in an easy going, 'come and sit down by the fireside' fashion. He introduces each song by explaining it's background and Brownie's way of playing.

There are seven blues in E on disc one and two in the key of A on disc two plus original audio excerpts of Brownie's playing. Happy introduces each key by explaning the basic chords, rythm, baselines, leadlines and turnarounds. Then he moves on to the songs going from straightforward to the more intricate ones.
The plus in these DVD's is the typical Brownie style, turnarounds, chordshapes, baselines and some lovely intro's which make his style unique and gives him the drive in his playing. My favorite's are Sporting Life Blues, Living With The Blues in the key of E and in the key of A both Paw Shop Blues and Careless Love. This doesn't mean the others are less valuable, each song has it's place in the blues repetoire.

In conclusion I can say I have learned some new turnarounds, intro's, chordshapes and baselines that are usefull in any style of guitar playing. The booklet has the music and tab and also the lyrics of the songs. Good value for money.

8304667,5,B001GAO586,"Another gem from master teacher, Happy Traum!  This double DVD set teaching the songs of Brownie McGhee is a generous double helping of teaching and anecdotes from our country's premier acoustic guitar teacher.

Happy takes us skillfully through each song, breaking it down to digestible parts, anticipating where his student might stumble, and finally bringing home a wonderful product.

Sportin' Life Blues is my favorite and one that has been recorded by many artists, including Traum himself.

Like other DVDs from Happy Traum, this DVD is not only a wonderful instructional DVD, but it is also entertaining.  If you have Happy and John Sebastian (from the Lovin' Spoonful) teaching the songs of Mississippi John Hurt, you already know that the DVD is not only instructional, but simply enjoyable to watch, sans guitar.

Happy gives us some of Brownie's favorite licks, and makes the student fall in love with these songs.

Although Happy would certainly disagree, many of his fans believe that the student has far surpassed the teacher, and Happy's own versions of these songs are, in many ways, superior to the originals.  It is not just the recording, but the beautiful interpretation of the songs; that wonderful voice of his, and the playful manner in which he adds his own signature to these songs.

Like a kindly grandfather, invite him into your living room, use your pause button often, and learn some wonderful songs that your friends and family (and audience?) will love.
