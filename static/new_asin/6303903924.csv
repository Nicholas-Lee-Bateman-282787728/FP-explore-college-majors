722125,2,6303903924,"From a content perspective, ""Kansas Pacific"" holds up pretty well.

I bought this print of the movie because it was the most expensive and hopefully, therefore, the best transfer. However, this DVD has (1) awful video quality (NO detail in shadows and very poor sharpness) and (2) poor audio quality (noisy and low fidelity). I had recently seen a FAR higher quality print of this movie on cable. It is hard to imagine that either of the other two DVD prints of this movie could be worse than this one.",1234396800,10,502,4.5777777777777775
722126,4,6303903924,"Kansas Pacific is a surprising little film--about an hour and a half of modest production values and modest plot that comes off surprisingly well, despite some print damage marring the quality of the on-screen experience.  Sterling Hayden (The Godfather, Dr. Stangelove) plays an Army captain sent out on the QT on the eve of the civil war.  His mission to get the Kansas Pacific built to supply Union forts in the west is vital but brings him into conflict with KP boss Barton MacLane and daughter Eve Miller.  The three must eventually team up to fight Quantrell's raiders, determined to stop the KP at all costs.

The acting is great, not only from the stars but from the small supporting roles like engineer 'Smokestack' and the KP police scout.

There's a trio of great 'build the American railroad' films out there and this is one.  It lacks the awesome cast and direction of Union Pacific or the technicolor Randolph Scott in Santa Fe, but it holds its own.  Indeed.  Worth more than one watch.",1223942400,6,1001,4.712643678160919
722127,2,6303903924,"This production falls comfortably between poor and below average. The acting is only a little better than the plot deserves, the lead actors - Sterling Hayden and Barton MacLane - being let down by a poor script. The love angle to the story is indifferently supplied by Eve Miller.

The main ""star"" is the supposed railway, a military line under construction just before the outbreak of the American Civil War. Based loosely on the transcontinental railway that broke ground shortly before the outbreak of the War, the road in this film is intended as a supply line to the cavalry's western outposts. A rough bunch of Confederate spoilers makes several attempts to destroy it. Needless to say, they don't succeed. Actually, they didn't need to: the rails are laid in such a desultory fashion that it would have required the rest of the 19th century to finish the job.

The budget for this railway was even less than that for the movie. The small track-laying crew appears to have only one (little) locomotive and there's a lack of heavy lifting equipment. In one scene the engine and freight cars are blown up beyond repair in a narrow pass, blocking it. A short while later we see a maintenance crew rummaging around a few broken bent and twisted rails; the train has magically disappeared. The whole enterprise resembles a rather disorganized afternoon picnic, with none of the hustle and bustle of a genuine ""end of track."" There is much chucking about of dynamite, and that's another problem with this film: the stuff was  not invented (by Nobel) until the War was over.

If you're looking for a western or a historical treatment of  railways, skip this one.",1104710400,5,1662,4.7972027972027975

722295,3,6303903924,"Kansas Pacific, 1952 film

""Bleeding Kansas"" was a scene of conflict over the slavery question in the late 1850s. During this time a railroad was being built to the west. It could become a vital link for the US government. Some Southern groups tried to prevent it and were opposed by Northern interests. The movie shows men working on the railroad. A steam locomotive halts because of damaged tracks, the saboteurs shoot at them. The Kansas-Pacific is a military project [government funded, as many were]. Captain Nelson will be sent out as a troubleshooter. Back in Kansas a woman telegrapher records a message to restart construction under a new construction engineer. Skilled workers are hard to find. There is a fight in the street for action. We learn about Quantrill's scheme to delay construction by sending his men to work on the railroad. Men are hired for work, some of them will be armed guards. Logs are placed to hold the iron rails in place. [Steel rails are more durable.]

One worker stumbles and is discharged. Nelson suggests an improvement. Quantrill plots his sabotage. A train brings in supplies. A fight between two men distracts the others so the explosives are set off by a rifle shot. The saboteurs steal dynamite and run away on their horses. There is a chase with shooting. Nelson finds the men who stole the dynamite and retrieves it. His offer of double pay recruits more workers. The next day there is another sabotage attempt that fails. Shots are fired, ""Smokestack"" is wounded. The work goes on. Cannons are used to destroy the train. More repair work is needed but there are fewer men now. Supplies, troops, and ammunition will arrive on the next train, its schedule is kept secret. Railroad guards are sent out to prevent another attack. This train has soldiers and a cannon to shoot back! The railroad guards attack as will, defeating the saboteurs. Nelson fight Quantrill and captures him. The train proceeds to its destination. ""I'll be back"" says Nelson to Barbara. ""He'll be back"" repeats ""Smokestack"".

This is an average movie, comparable to a TV movie from that era. It is loosely based on history but avoids controversy or anything that would make you think. Just where did those cannon and ammunition come from? Moving them requires teams of horses, aiming them requires a skilled and experienced gunner. There is little background on the town in this movie. They used post-Civil War firearms in this story.",1415664000,,2452,4.875299760191846

Everyone takes railroads for granted but people don't stop to realize th hardships they went through to get them where they are today. Blood sweat and tears made America.
