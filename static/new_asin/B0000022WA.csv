1176579,5,B0000022WA,"The original film of : ""The Parent Trap"" is one of the greates of all the Disney classics.  The film is brilliant with Brian Keith, and Halley Mills, and is garenteed to make you laph. It is by far the best film  Halley Mills has done, and the trick photography is absolutly wonderful!  The only way this film can be topped is by the 1998 remake , which is  believe it or not...even better than that this incredible wonderful  classic! This film is a WINNER!",917308800,,458,4.341176470588235

1176583,5,B0000022WA,"This is a great getaway movie. This is one that can be watched several times before getting all the nuances. According to the film credits, this movie is based on the Doppelganger. Others say that is was done before as 1954 British film ""TWICE UPON A TIME."" Any way you look at it this is a unique film tat will never be duplicated or equaled.

Hayley Mills plays Sharon McKendrick/Susan Evers twin sisters. They were separated when their parents divorced, and they rediscovered each other in summer camp. Maureen O'Hara plays the mother, Margaret 'Maggie' McKendrick, who is strait laced Bostonian, until younger female competition arises. Joanna Barnes plays, Vicky Robinson, the competition. I won't go through the whole cast but I especially liked Leo G. Carroll as Rev. Dr. Mosby. He was there watching every time you turned around and not reacting, as they would expect him to act.

The film was shot in California. That is why it looks funny that Sharon (supposedly from Boston) is driven to the camp and Susan (supposedly from California) is flown to the camp. I don't recall seeing redwoods in New England. The pictures that the twins show each other of their parents look like movie photo Promotion shots.

For a different Hayley Mills in a film with her real father, John Mills, ""The Chalk Garden"" (1964).",1504742400,,1316,4.84

I am truly floored at the talent of Hayley Mills as well as the rest of the actors/actresses! if ur looking for a clean fun, nice, and entertaining movie, this is sure to be the one. even tho the story is far from being realistic, the charm, sweetness and talent makes up for it! so have fun and start watching the story of Sharon and susan!!!",1504137600,,376,4.309859154929577

1176604,3,B0000022WA,"Okay...I'm MORE than a little conflicted as I write this review due to the fact that this movie was a staple in my childhood home, and an all time favorite of my amazing mother of 8 who has since passed. She and my awesome dad were married for 51 years, until the day he passed...so why the family history story??? Now I understand why parents who remained married through thick and thin, enjoyed watching this movie with their children...but I had the unfortunate incident of watching it with my own two little girls (who happen to be BIG Hailey Mills fans after seeing Pollyanna) and having to explain that not ALL parents SHOULD get back together after they divorce....ESPECIALLY when one parent is ALREADY REMARRIED with a child together (as their father remarried for his THIRD TIME to a woman he met on Craig's List)!!! After the show it was AWFUL. ..(I even shed tears as I overheard them plotting and contemplating how THEY were going to ""trick"" THEIR mommy and daddy into getting back together). So I definitely CAUTION parents of divorce, (or even parents in ANY sort of alternative lifestyle)  to think twice before allowing their young children to see this movie. My girls are six and seven, and it really ended up being a painful experience for ALL of us!!! Not sure it sends the right message, (as much as I believe couples SHOULD stick it out through thick and thin) since sometimes, divorce IS necessary (especially in cases of neglect, abuse, and continuous infidelity). I really loved this movie growing up...but it really is intended for a specific audience.",1484006400,,1577,4.7765567765567765

1176613,3,B0000022WA,"This is an entertaining movie that the whole family can watch. It does deal with the topic of divorce, and two siblings are secretly split to each live with separate parents. Young children may have trouble with this movie. If your children are old enough and mature enough, you can have a simple conversation about how it made for a fun story, but in real life if two parents secretly separated their twin children, and later those kids found out, it would be confusing and emotionally traumatizing to say the least.",1479254400,,517,4.6923076923076925

1176682,4,B0000022WA,"Though both are good, I think the original is slightly better.  The remake tends to PC things in a way that the original didn't.  The original includes the mother (played by the inimitable Maureen O'Hara) socking the father in the eye.  There's a hint at the ugliness of divorce and spousal abuse that's glossed over in the remake.  The remake also writes out the role of the minister, presumably to avoid offending non-Christians.

Plus, the ranch and Boston house seem more realistic than the winery and wedding gown boutique (I'd much prefer the latter, but they seem so over the top that they're not believable).

Both are very entertaining, but for originality and non-conformity, I have to side with the original.",1465171200,,719,4.900826446280992

It's a really nice multigenerational crossover film for the era and today. I have many wonderful images burned into memory of this film. So many classic moments. This film was a first with the special effects it employed and presented a progressive family dynamic.

1176839,3,B0000022WA,"Looking for something light and fun, but not outrageously silly? Little Hayley Mills hit the ground running in ""Tiger Bay"" & was literally the quintessential ""glad girl"" in ""Pollyanna"". Now, in ""The Parent Trap"", she brings just the right amount of both light humor and a little pathos in another one of Disney's groundbreaking technical achievements, playing twins. Technically, the real achievement is when the ""twins"" sing together in one scene. This was pressed into a single by ""Hayley Mills & Hayley Mills"". Fun film, with both Brian Keith & Maureen O'Hara playing it straight, but with a twinkle in their eyes. This can be a relief if you've ever witnessed the Disney films that are either too much one way or the other. It was also great to see 1930s character actors Charlie Ruggles (who's great here) and Una Merkel (who I've always adored). In fact, from the start of the film, you may find yourself recognizing a good number of character actors throughout. Arranger/composer Frank DeVol appears as the Boy Scout leader. DeVol composed & arranged music for both film & TV - going by just DeVol - working regularly on the program ""My Three Sons"", as well as some acting - like appearing as the narrator for Jerry Lewis' ""The Big Mouth"" and as the bandleader on the cult TV program, ""Forever Fernwood"". What better way to spend a lazy afternoon than with a classic Disney picture? Enjoy.",1439424000,4,1396,4.796680497925311

1176880,4,B0000022WA,"This was a great Disney classic.  Charming and full of fun for the whole family it followed the story of two identical sisters Susan Evers and Sharon McKendrick who were separated as babies when their parents divorced and one went with each parent.  The two meet accidentally at a summer camp and become friends.  One is from California and the other from the east.  When they finally find out they are sisters they set out to trick their parents and try to get them back together.  Both are single, but Dad is about to marry a gold digger and that just has to be ""submarined"".  Hayley Mills did a great job playing the twins and Brian Keith did well in his first comedy outing.  Definitely worth a watch, very entertaining. -- Incidentally Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara made two movies together in 1961.  The comedy ""The Parent Trap"" and a western ""The Deadly Companions"".",1428537600,,874,4.62987012987013

The story, although entirely improbable on so many levels, is still just as charming and delightful as I remember from my own viewing as a child in the seventies.

I was struck, however, at what a truly awful little actress Hayley Mills was at this stage.  Just a little robot going through the paces.  Especially with the really fine performances of the other Actors.  And yet, I still love Hayley in this movie.  Weird, right?

The later remake is also charming and one of the few really decent remakes of a Disney film.  But this is the original and every kid should see it.

(I wonder why I never asked, as a child, why Hayley Mills had a British accent if she was born in California and grew up in Boston with a decidedly all-American family?)",1420416000,3,828,4.466666666666667

You know the story . . . twins meet up at summer camp having been separated by divorced parents each of whom kept the other child a secret from her sister. The girls, played by unbelievably adorable Hayley Mills, concoct a plan to reunite the parents; Outdoorsy Dad, Brian Keith, lives in California and proper Mom (Maureen O'Hara) in Boston. Hilarity ensues.
But here's what's fun to notice all these years later--Dad's spectacular home in Monterey (check out the tile work in the bathroom).  The modest and cute swim suits on all the girls at camp. No teeny bikinis here. Can't say I ever noticed before that Mr. Brian Keith was quite the fine figure of a man. No surprise but a reminder that Maureen O'Hara is beyond gorgeous. And check out the peau de soie shoes that match her green traveling outfit; people dressed up to fly back then. At camp Susan, the California twin, has photos of dreamy boys like Bobby Rydell and Ricky Nelson, as relevant today as Justin B. will be 50 years from now. Annette Funicello sings with the opening credits.

1176962,4,B0000022WA,"When compared with the newer version, the older one is a little more innocent. I don't like the drunk mom in the new one, for example. On the other hand, in this one,  the bickering between the parents is more intense, the mother-in-law is very domineering (and totally removed in the new version), the styles are very 60s, and the attitudes and stereotypes are equally old fashioned. The ending in the newer one is also much more credible. Their marital problems are perhaps more simple to facilitate the quick surprise ending. In the older one, the couple seems like they will still require some counseling to really work things out by today's standards. I seemed to have overlooked all these issues when I was younger. But I still really like the whole idea, and my daughter and I had fun watching it together as a daddy-daughter date.",1398124800,,838,4.700680272108843

1176968,5,B0000022WA,"This, the original Parent Trap, is one of the very best movies ever made. Besides the superb acting by all of the cast (in particular, Charles Ruggles' screen presence and ability to carry scenes is spectacular) the directing and screenwriting are pure genius. One of the many subtle things going on in the screenplay is that each twin unknowingly has inherited a special, unique talent from the other parent; Mitch and Maggie are equally unaware of it since he and she haven't been around their other daughter since shortly after their birth to notice. And if there was any doubt that each parent still loved each other through all of the years of their separation, the near-the-end scene in Mitch's kitchen proves it in two ways: One, Mitch has in his music collection the song that was played in the little Italian restaurant where Maggie and he went on their first date. And two, well, take a look at what is on Maggie's ring finger as she bites her nails (ah, so that's from where Susan got her nail-biting urge!) in emotional reaction to Mitch's telling her that he misses her more than anything else in the world. Superb! This movie lovingly reaches into every heart, and is a must-have.",1394668800,,1194,4.690476190476191

and while the 4 year old did waver a bit in the middle, the older boy was completely engaged from start to finish, occasionally pausing the film to ask questions and make sure that he understood which twin was which, and the intricacies of the plot. To say that my boys, who are avid Phinius and Phirb and Adventure Time fans enjoyed this film is saying more than a father could ...and what a lovely introduction to slower paced and well acted entertainment after what we see being churned out for children these days.
What I would like to add is, don't plop your children in front of this movie and then go do something more important, if there is a message in this movie, it says that your children are what is important ...so sit down with them and watch the movie with them, it will only make you closer and deepen a love that is already there.",1383955200,2,899,4.294117647058823

1176994,5,B0000022WA,"The best part of this film is Hayley Mills' double performance.  The rest of the cast is likewise packed with great actors: the incomparable Maureen O'Hara as the twin's mother, Brian Keith as their hapless father bent on marrying a gold-digger (Joanna Barnes), Charlie Ruggles as the easy going grandfather, Cathleen Nesbitt as the controlling/overbearing grandmother, Una Merkel as the housekeeper who never offers her opinion, and Leo G. Carroll as an easily amused reverend.  This movie is filled with memorable scenes (my favorite being the exile to an isolated cabin with the entire company of girls following the twins and whistling the march from The Bridge on the River Kwai).  A fun film, as long as you can get past the notion that two parents would be selfish enough to separate sisters as though they were property or a couple of wedding gifts to be divided after the divorce.  All that time lost, that can never be made up, would make for a wonderful grudge and/or years of therapy.",1377129600,,996,4.841176470588235

This is where the bright young ladies decide to take action, and switch places in order to bring their divorced parents back together again.

First because as an adult watching both movies I found the tension between the parents more interesting and believable in the Double Trouble version and second because the print quality of the newer Double Trouble version is/was superior to the vault version of the original. The contrast of print quality is striking because Disney restored the vault version of Pollyanna also starring Hayley Mills and it looks brand new with sharp images, excellent color and a print that is not faded at all whereas the vault version of the original Parent Trap does not have as sharp images, has darkened slightly and the color while good is clearly not of the same quality as the restored Pollyanna vault version. The acting in both Parent Trap versions is excellent including both Hayley Mills and Lindsay Lohan. So would recommend Double Trouble version for first viewing and if you get hooked as I did going for the original version second.

What is amazing to me is how many vices are present in this movie.  We always seem to refer to the 50's and 60's as the innocent years, but I was surprised to see the 'smoking' grandfather, the 'drinking' minister and the amount of yelling and screaming that went on between Mitch and Maggie.  What I found the most disturbing was the  face slap by Vickie at the end of the movie.  You really don't see any of these things in the newer version and for my childen's sake, I'm glad.  I have always liked both Hayley Mills and Maureen O'Hara and they are really terrific in this movie.  Brian Keith is his usual self - I've never been very impressed with his acting abilities.  Overall, I'm a much bigger Dennis Quaid fan and thought he played the part of the father very well - a much more touching version.

One thing that I did discover, which I thought was very clever on Disney's part was casting Joanna Barnes, who plays Vicky in the original, as Vicky Blake, Meredith's mother in the remake.  Her use of the word 'pet' in both movies is what made me think it might be the same actress and sure enough, it is!  Maybe everyone else realized this, but I did not.  Bravo Disney.

I still think this is a classic Disney movie, but after having seen both of them recently again, my vote is for the newer version.",1162512000,2,1488,4.3478260869565215

It is then that they discover they are identical twin sisters separated long ago.  Now their talent for pranks is turned against their parents as they decide to switch places with one another.  This way they can meet their other parent and then reveal the deception and force mother and father to meet again.

No sooner is the switch enacted than trouble is brewing.  The father seems bent on marrying again.  The deception is revealed and the two groups come together.  But there is still the matter of the father's girlfriend to deal with.  She is a gold digger with no redeeming qualities and she becomes the target of the twins' talent for pranks.  Of course all works out in the end and everyone is happy (well, almost everyone).

A strong cast combined with new technology allowing Hayley Mills to interact with herself make a very firm foundation for this tale.

The movie may be sugary sweet, but it is a real tribute to children, parenthood and love. Brian Keith (Mitch Evers) and Maureen O'Hara (Maggie McKendrick) divorced when their twin daughters were very young. Each took a child--one parent lives free and open California style (he), the other lives in stiff Bostonian style (she). Their children reflect their respective parents lifestyle. By a fluke the girls end up in the same summer camp, of course they (Sharon and Susan) meet; and that's when the fun begins. After initially disliking each other, they find they have more in common than their disturbing identical looks. Once connected, they decide that their parents must be reunited. However, neither is counting on papa Brian Keith having a gold-digging sweetheart (Joanna Barnes) and her greedy mother lurking about. Never mind, the girls soon take care of that. The Parent Trap has some hilarious moments. Some are laugh out loud funny. Just watch Leo G. Carroll as Reverend Dr. Mosby.

The movie has a superb cast, Una Merkel is Verbena, Mitch's very wise and knowing housekeeper, Cathleen Nesbitt and Charles Ruggles are the wonderful and doting grandparents. John Mills (Haley's father) appears briefly as Mitch's golf caddy.  I was happy to see that the movie is now available on DVD.

1177054,5,B0000022WA,"Will modern children like it?  This is a 50 year old Disney movie about

a divorced couple with  twins. The twins meet at camp and trade places.

The plot is classic, almost Shakespearean.  The actors are all better

than the Disney average.  The music, if you call Bobby Darren's work music, is

so dated that it sounds like a parody, but that will not be noticed by

the target audience, which is kids and nostologic oldsters.

  The 8 and 10 year old that watched it with me were literally bouncing

around the room since they found the film so funny and exciting that they

could not sit still.

  Well, that's the bottom line.  They insist it get 5 stars.  Anything more to be said?

  Yes.

  Those two kids are white, live with both their biological, married parents, and

have been brought up to believe that marriage is good, and divorce is bad.  They are

the optimal audience.  If that doesn't describe your kids, ""The Parent Trap"" is probably

not a good idea.  Movies like ""The Parent Trap"", provoked the making of ""Mrs. Doubtfire"",

which is usually floating around in Kid's Movieland.  If your kids have seen that, your

might want to show them ""The Parent Trap"" so that they can make some sense of the Robin

William's long weepy speeches there.

  One other yellow flag.  One of the marital problems, which in the end is just ignored, is

that the wife occasionally socks the husband in the eye.  This is not treated as a

physical abuse, or even a serious issue, and attributed to the wife's fiery Irish background,

signalled by red hair.  If your kids have had to deal seriously with this problem, this movie

might not be for you. Other stereotypes of the era are there as well.  Both husband and wife

are fabulously wealthy, dress up for dinner, and don't do any work.  There are plenty of loyal

domestic servants, but they are all white so the at least there is no ""Mammy"" problem with the

dialogue.

  This is a popular story and there have been many remakes, but all the ones I have seen

are terrible.  I am told that the ""pre-remake"", a 1950 BW German film, is quite charming,

but unless your kids are bilingual old-movie buffs, that's irrelevant.  What makes the remakes

terrible is what saves this work, which is that it is not a message movie, is not at all preachy,

and there are no moral lessons wrapped up in fake dialogue.

  This is a old fashioned Disney film, so there is none of the flatulence/groin humor

kids have come to expect from the Disney experience.

  The DVD is sharp and nice as far as the movie goes.  The controls follow the typical

Disney method:  Every time you put the dvd in the machine, they block your controls and

force you to watch a ream of advertisements before you can get to the main menu, where

'play' is down in the corner of the screen and hard to get to, so that if the kids make

a mistake they instead get the features, which are, of course, more advertisements.  Of

course, the 'play' key is blocked.

If you stop the film, that counts as if the dvd has been ejected, so when you restart you

have to watch all the advertisements again, as well as the charming FBI warning threatening

you with not only a 250K fine but 3 years in jail.  For kids movies this is a especial pity,

since they will typically watch the same movie many times, and so are stuck not only watching

long loud advertisements in a movie they own, but the same ones, over and over and over.

You might want to spare them the pain and make a videotape of just the movie for day to day

watching.  (Ask you teenagers how to do that.)

Of course, being a Hayley Mills fan, as well as a fan of 60s and 70s Disney style, I must rate this (the original) A+ and the best of them all. Hayley pulls off the the twin stunt without a hitch.

Have a multi region or Region 2 DVD and want to pay about the same and get Italian and German dubs bundled with what you'd get here? (menu selectable for Eng, Ita and De audio) search amazon.de DVDs for ""Die Vermhlung ihrer Eltern geben bekannt.""

DVDs have a catch, you need a Region Free or Region 2 player for that, since Hollywood wants to control your TV. (It's an intentional lockout placed by the industry called ""Region Codes"", not an incompatibility) They always short-change people in DVD's ""Region 1"" (which are sold in the US and Canada) out of a wonderful opportunity to hear the same movie in European languages.

For that film Kstner himself wrote the screenplay and participated in it as the narrator, providing interesting and funny comments.

But the plans of Sharon and Susan are crushed because their father is getting married to Vickie Robinson (Joanna Barnes). Sharon and Susan try to rekindle the romance between their parents by recreating their first date. It doesn't exactly work, however, and Sharon and Mrs. McKendrick plan to leave the next day.

Since I'm sure you know how great the movie is and can read other reviews for that, I'll concentrate on the special features of this DVD, some of which aren't even mentioned above.
? ""Caught in the Act: The Making of the Parent Trap"" is a good documentary (about 30 minutes), including interviews with Hayley Mills, Maureen O'Hara, director David Swift, Joanna Barnes, and more. It provides a lot of background details on how the idea for the film came about, selecting the cast, fine-tuning the screenplay, etc.
? ""Disney Legend: Hayley Mills"" is a 25-minute feature all about Hayley, and it's quite good. It includes photos and home movies from her childhood as well as interviews with Hayley, Maureen O'Hara, Dean Jones, Kevin Corcoran, David Swift, Nancy Olson, and others she worked with at Disney. Hayley talks about her family, her experiences at Disney, and her departure from that Disney image in the late '60s.
? ""Seeing Double"" is a short feature on the split-screen technology that allowed viewers to see two images of Hayley Mills side by side at once. This technology was quite innovative and experimental at the time, but it worked beautifully.
? The Sherman Brothers featurette is a short but interesting bit of facts and trivia on two men who wrote songs for many memorable Disney films, including ""Mary Poppins"" and ""The Parent Trap.""
? ""Lost Treasures: Who's the Twin?"" is an interesting feature about Susan Henning, the girl who played the double for Hayley Mills in the film (in scenes with the camera over her shoulder or to her back). Now that I know to look for her, I can plainly see in several profile shots that the other twin is NOT Hayley. Watch the fight scene at the dance closely too. Henning is a warm presence and gives some little-known facts about the film and about Walt Disney.
? ""Let's Get Together"" is a music video of the two Hayleys singing the song from the movie.
? The Donald Duck animated cartoon, ""Donald's Double Trouble,"" is a Disney short filmed a few years before this movie, but it's a cute bonus.
? Other special features include theatrical trailers, TV spots, radio spots, a lengthy Parent Trap photo gallery, and a 1961 Disney studio album.

? The film's audio commentary by Hayley Mills and director David Swift is also a great feature. Hayley reveals many interesting tidbits about her experiences on the film, her relationships with her costars and Walt Disney, and how she views the film today. Swift offers his own recollections on Hayley's performance and other background information on the film. For example, the scene where Brian Keith finds the bra hanging on his shower was almost censored!
The widescreen transfer is wonderful. I'd never seen this film in its original aspect ratio, so this was a treat. The abundance of special features make this DVD edition truly wonderful. (I had no problems with it playing in my DVD player, either.) This is simply a fun family film that you can watch over and over.

Frankly, Disney's products seem to have so many problems, I doubt I will ever buy another one. Many of their movies are in the wrong ratio, some are terrible transfers (""Old Yeller"" in particular, and also the Chinatown scene in ""The Love Bug"" comes to mind), and now I've had this set and ""The Great Locomotive Chase"" which have had ""playability"" issues.
For a company with such a great library of old movies, it is really sad that they put out such an inferior product. As I would love to include them in my DVD library. But one shouldn't have to concern themself with worrying whether a DVD is going to play or not when they purchase it.",1087689600,4,1223,4.693023255813953
1177065,5,B0000022WA,"I am a fan of Disney movies, and this is on my list of favorites.  Nothing can beat this original!
Hayley Mills plays two different roles in the movie...as a set of twins separated at birth.  It's similar to a Prince and the Pauper type story, but neither child is necessarily poor or living a bad life.  One sister lives in California with her dad and the other lives in Boston with her mom.  They find out that they are related only because they HATE each other at camp and get banished to share a room for the rest of camp.  Then they make it their mission to get the parents back together and find out why they were separated in the first place!  It's comical and touching.  Probably very far fetched, which makes it all the more fun to watch.",1086739200,2,747,4.25531914893617
1177066,5,B0000022WA,"The movie's very entertaining on its merits, despite being a tad dated in the new millenium. However, in the perspective of the 60's, quite well done. The one thing that has ALWAYS bothered me about this movie and critical responses to it is the underlying fact that what these 'parents' did to their children, splitting them up, never letting either know about the twin or even seeing the other child for 12 years, is just HORRIBLE and, worse, is virtually a non-issue with the family. Yes, it is mentioned, but never truly explained nor could it be: such an action is never justified or defensible. This is also true of the recent remake, and perhaps Hollywood should concentrate a bit more on common sense, morality and true family values rather than 'entertainment.'",1086307200,,770,4.840909090909091
1177067,5,B0000022WA,"I love this movie so much that it's surprised me that I've taken so long to review it. But this movie is GREAT!
It's about two girls, Susan Evers and Sharon Mckendrick, who meet at summer camp, and are shocked and surprised to find out that not counting their hairstyles, they look exactly alike! The initial curiosity leads to feuding and the girl's wind up in an isolation tent alone...for the rest of the summer.
Rain, wind, and an open window eventually break the ice, and Susan and Sharon begin to get to know each other. But when Sharon shows Susan a picture of her mother, Susan instantly recognizes it as her mother, and the girls discover that they are SISTERS!!!!!!!
To make a long story short, Susan and Sharon switch places in a wild attempt to get their parents back together. But their plans are nearly crashed when their dad announces his intent to marry a vain, uppity lady named Vicky. Can Susan and Sharon rally together and get their parents back together before something awful happens? Watch this exciting movie starring the adorable Hayley Mills as Susan and Sharon, to find out!
Hayley Mills has got to be one of my favorite actresses, and this has got to be the best film ever. She is just so good!
The DVD is just filled with extras, and if you want to see another DVD with the same amount of extras, see 'Pollyanna', another one of Hayley Mills movies, which is also awesome.
A couple years ago Disney made a remake of the Parent Trap, and although the special effects are probably much better, you can't reproduce the same charm that Hayley Mills gave us when this movie first came out. The original is always the best!

Finally, when I turned 19, my parents bought it on DVD for me as a birthday present.  I do not get to watch my movies much, but I love this one.  It is one I never did grow out of yet and I don't think I ever will.  It is the story about two twin daughters, Susan and Sharon, who meet at a summer camp and find out that they are twins.  They then come up with a plan to switch places to bring their separated parents, Mitch and Maggie, back together.  Susan goes to Boston and tries act like a refined young lady while Sharon goes out west to be a tom-boy girl.  They run into some problems, but they are able to bring their parents back together in the end.  This is a funny, loving, and a wonderful movie to watch, especially for young teenage girls.  It may be some-what out-dated, but it is still a great and touching movie.  Please, parents, if you are shopping for your young girl, buy this movie for them.

1177072,4,B0000022WA,"Although the split-screen technique had been around for a decade or so, it was usually more noted for its failures than its success, and the actor required to play dual roles usually took tremendous heat for their failure to create two physically identical but distinctly different characterizations on screen.  But with THE PARENT TRAP, with the difficult dual role resting on the shoulders of an extremely young star, Walt Disney struck gold.  It would be the single highest grossing film the studio had released up to that time, and even some forty years later the baby-boomers who flocked to see it in 1961 regard it as one of their favorite movie experiences.
But THE PARENT TRAP has a lot more going for it than mere nostalgia.  The cast is really, really good, featuring the ever-likable Maureen O'Hara and Brian Keith in leading roles and a host of great character actors (including Leo G. Carroll and Nancy Kulp) in minor roles.  And then there is Haley Mills.  The daughter and sister of noted English actors, Mills was no newcomer to the screen when THE PARENT TRAP went before the cameras--she had even picked up an Oscar for her earlier Disney film POLLYANNA.  Even so, this was no guarantee that she could pull off the feat of double roles, something that had daunted even the legendary Bette Davis.  But she did.
The story has been told so often that surely every one knows it by now.  A wife delivers twin daughters--but shortly afterward divorces her husband, and each wins custody of one child.  The children are raised without any knowledge of each other's existence... until they unexpectedly bump into each other at summer camp, put two and two together, and devise a scheme to get their parents back together again.
Even today, and in spite of its familiarity, it's an amusing idea, and while the actual script is weak in spots the cast, and especially Haley Mills, makes the most of it.  There's plenty of slapstick, lots of laugh-out-loud scenes, and enough charm to beguile all but the most cynical viewers.  And Haley Mills clearly demonstrates why she was regarded as the single most gifted child actor of her era: although she plays both Susan and Sharon with the same edge of mischievous fun, they do indeed come off as completely different personalities.
Of course, digital technology has left the old split-screen technique in the dust, and today its easy to see the flaws in the technique that weren't so obvious at the time.  And the quality of the film transfer is not the best: while this isn't the worst transfer I've seen, it is full of artifacts nonetheless.  Even so, the appeal of the story, the cast, and most particularly Haley Mills make up for a lot, and this Disney double DVD comes complete with a host of bonuses (including a making-of documentary and an audio commentary track by director David Swift and Haley Mills) that fans will enjoy quite a bit.
If you were a fan of the film then, you'll remain a fan of it now.  And if you want to introduce your family to a truly charming movie experience, you couldn't make a better choice.

Here is the main story line.

1177074,5,B0000022WA,"I'll grant you that The Parent Trap is gushy, syrupy, silly in parts and far-fetched. But none of it makes the slightest bit of difference, because this is a truly classic film! It's a microcosm of the 60's and for anyone who grew up in that crazy decade, you will adore the clothes, slang and general feel of the movie. Hayley Mills delivers her best performance in dual roles as wealthy twins who meet by chance at camp. They had been separated as tiny tots and only realize they are sisters when they compare photo of their parents. The scenes at camp are a little contrived, but they still will make you laugh.
The best parts of the movie are with Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara, still beautiful and charming in the role of the mother. The twins plot on how to reunite their parents and their vicious tricks on witchy Vicky (Keith's fiance) are hilarious. The camping scenes are really funny and even though a little mean-spirited, who wouldn't root against the vain, frivolous Vicky? Keith and O'Hara have real screen chemistry and their scenes together are delightful.
I have seen this movie dozens of times and never weary of it. Kids of all ages should love it, and so should the seniors and anyone in between. A true Disney classic!",1059868800,3,1241,4.594594594594595

I watched it and would not let him or my husband interrupt me while I was enjoying it. Yeah, there are some syrupy bits, but overall its a classic in my collection.

The movie is from Erich Kastner's ""Das doppelte Lottchen"" (Lisa and Lotte-The English title.) In the book the girls are about nine years old. In the Hayley Mills version the girls are 13 years old.
 There is a lot of typical Disney slapstick. The best part is when the girls finally realize that they are sisters. That was a major ""Hanky"" moment. The movie features Hayley Mills as the twins (who the previous year won a special Oscar for ""Pollyanna"". ""Parent Trap"" made Hayley Mills a pop culture icon. It also featured Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara as the parents. Some of the slapstick is mean spirited, but in all it is fun. Most of the movie consists of the girls trying to get their parents together again.

I actually had tears going when I was younger and I saw this movie. When I ordered it on DVD, I thought ""there is no way Im still going to get emotional at this age"". I was wrong. Althought the movie starts out a bit corny, you cant help but get into Haley Mills superb acting. Many things about this movie hit a soft spot. The long lost twins coming together by fate and finally finding out the truth about their past. The daughter who finally got to see her mother and grandfather after never seeing them. The parents finding out that they still love eachother and can't live without eachother after years of serparation. It touches you in a special way for sure, but at the same time its so much fun! As with most of Walt Disneys movies, everyone in this film was casted perfectly. Ya know, this movie still makes me laugh a bit too. One of my favorite little parts of the movie is when the girlfriends mother says ""is this the one you call peanut face""? hahaa.. I remember how embarressing it was being called names like that when I was little.
Hayley Mills is really great and Im a true fan. The 2 disk DVD is excellent top notch quality! It has behind the scenes, commentary with Hayley Mills, a great classic donald duck cartoon and more!

Haley Mills plays twins, separated at birth but determined to get their divorced parents back together after they find one another at summer camp.
The transfer (thank heavens!) is anamorphic widescreen.  But the image is often pixelated and riddled with annoying dirt, scratches and color inconsistencies that are inherent in the ""split screen"" process shots (the technical term used to make two people appear out of one) in particular.  Yet this problem could most certainly have been minimalized or even corrected using today's digital wizardry. Sadly, we don't get that kind of committment from Disney Inc. so we're stuck with a print that at times is very harsh to look at.  Overall, colors are weak, though consistent.  Black levels are low and contrast is at times wanting. Audio, though dated, is nevertheless well represented. For extra features, Disney Inc. gets an ""A"" plus, plus.  There are documentaries, interviews, short subjects, musical tracks and a host of other interesting offering that really make the film come alive.

I think all DVD's should be.  But the EXTRAS!! WOW, they put it all in here.

The 2 disc set has much more than is listed here or on the packaging. It is loaded with surprise features, but you have to hunt for them.
A featurette ""Disney Legend Hayley Mills""; Featurette on the double used for behind the back shots called ""Who's the Twin""  with a recent interview from her; ""Seeing Double"" is a mini-documentary about the process used to make it appear to be 2 girls when there were one in may shots; A great interview feature with recently deceased animator Ward Kimball, and director David Swift; About 17 minutes from a classic Disney TV episode from 1961 ""The Titlemakers"", featuring work on the films title shots and music; several archive galleries with studio fan cards, costume design sketches, lobby cards, invitations, film production letterhead,  posters, magazine ads, screenplay, and the complete exhibitors campaign book;  audio features with production photos such as a Radio Spot from the original release, two songs, and 2 interactive ""Sound Studio"" demonstrations. There is a touching feature on the songwriting team, the Sherman Brothers, responsible for many of the memorable songs from movie history including Mary Poppins, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, and the non-Disney ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"". More features include ""Lets Get Together""; Another behind the scenes documentary with tons of modern interviews of the stars and film-makers called ""Caught in the Act, the Making of the Parent Trap"". Also more production archives; and the 1961 Disney Studio album which is a video showcasing all the Disney created in 1961 from Parks, to TV, to theater; Also included is the original theatrical cartoon released with the film.

To find all of these is not easy, so make sure you poke around and push on every icon you can and play the things that do not sound intersting since they can lead to another menu of goodies.

Thank you! Thank you, whoever at Disney pushed to treat this DVD like this. The extras have caused me to rave about the Vault Disney series to everyone I know and buy extra copies for my loved ones as Christmas presents. I hope all Disney fans buy tons of these so Disney understands it is worth putting the extra work into a DVD.

1177087,5,B0000022WA,"The original version of ""The Parent Trap"" is definitely my favorite Disney movie ever and it is also pretty high on my favorite movies of all time list. This is a cute movie about a pair of twins (both played by Hayley Mills) whose parents were divorced shortly after they were born. They were split up and never knew the other existed. Then one year they were both sent to the same summer camp, where they met and discovered what happened, so they decided to switch places in order to bring their parents back together.
Hayley Mills does a great job playing two different characters. You have to understand that this is a pioneering film. The idea of one actor playing the parts of the two main characters was unheard of at the time this movie was made. With the technology we have today, this is a much easier process than it was 40 years ago. There was a lot of tricky camera work involved here. In fact, if you look closely, you can see a couple of times where an arm or a hand or something gets cut off because Hayley Mills went past the imaginary line in the middle of the screen.
There are lots of special features on this new DVD to make it worth buying. The second disc is full of documentaries with background information on the making of the film.

I am also sorry to say that it didn't exactlymake it a priority to watch the classic version either. But then the Vault Disney collection were announced, and I had a sudden urge to see how good this movie is, supposedly.
I have to agree with almost all of the previous reviews: ""The Parent Trap"" is a great Disney classic. Although I prefer live action Disney classics that do not take place in ""modern"" settings, the story and the great acting by Hayley Mills really won me over. She does an excellent job protraying the twins, SO good that I am having trouble remembering to type ""she"" and not ""they"". The twins are two seperate individuals and you can tell that Mills did some homework to make each character it's own.
The Vault Disney DVD offers a wide variety of bonuses, the best of which is the Making Of The Parent Trap. I also liked ""Hayley Mills: A Disney Legend"", which chronicles Mills' professional career at Disney. Another great bonus is the ""Disney 1960 Album"" which shows clips of all the projects that Walt Disney oversaw in that year. I also enjoyed a 20+ min segment of a vintage Disneyland episode, which was used to promote the movie in 1960.",1027900800,,1267,4.51304347826087

What makes this DVD edition stand out is that it has an entire second disk of extras!  As a person who is interested in documentaries and old film reels I was amazed how Disney made a superb disk of extras.
If you are thinking of upgrading your VHS copy to DVD, this is the time to do it.  Disney has made a DVD edition that others should be measured by.
It has commentary by the director, Hayley Milles, the making of the movie and profiles the ""hidden"" twin for Hayley's from behind shots.  If you look at the movie closely, there are a few shots where you can see the the actress full face on.  This alone justified the DVD purchase for me.
A fun movie with many fun extras.",1021593600,7,822,4.210191082802548

It is of course widely different from the original as the settings have been completely transferred to the US, it is almost like watching a completely new movie. And Hayley Mills is doing a really good job at playing both twins.
I can highly recommend it, even to those of you familiar with the original German story. It has lost nothing in Disney's hands.",1021334400,,512,4.637362637362638

Just trust me and get this one---it comes very close to the Platinum Edition of Snow White that was released last year.  Enjoy!",1021161600,2,427,4.234567901234568

What I didn't expect was that it's one of the best DVD's I own.  It's great to see the film on disc one in letterbox.  Prior to the film is the Donald Duck short that was seen in theaters when the film was released!  The extras on disc two are phenomenal!  This is where the magic really happens.  There are interviews with Hayley Mills, Director David Swift, Hayley's double Sharon (yes her name is Sharon like the character) and related pieces with The Sherman Brothers, Ward Kimball, Kevin Corcoran and others which make it a must for every Disney fan.  Plus there is tons of footage, clips, photos, music, drawings and storyboards, and so many clips from the disney archives. All this, but there are also documentaries about the film itself, discussions about the split screen effects, and more.  It's obvious that the folks at Disney took their time and did their homework.  Congratulations to the producers listed at the end of this DVD on a job VERY well done!  Hope to see more soon.",1020816000,7,1125,4.4926108374384235
1177093,5,B0000022WA,"Disney is finally becoming smart and are releasing their classics for the first time on DVD.
I was very impressed with the Parent Trap 2 cd set. The commentary between the director David Swift and star Hayley Mills was VERY interesting. Hayley talks about how difficult it was playing two parts as well as many other pieces of trivia and interesting facts about the movie. The sound is really good since it is THX certified, and the picture is crisp and clear. The behind the scenes documentary is a great plus along with the animated short that is included as well.  There is alot more extras than are even listed on the back.  There is a jukebox that plays songs from the movie, a documentary on the woman who played Hayley's twin, and much more!
 You will want this movie for your collection, because it still has the charm of a Disney classic with a twist of modern technology with TONS of extras included. I was very satisfied with my purchase and I highly recommend that if you like this movie or have it on vhs, get the DVD while you can!",1020816000,25,1045,4.432291666666667
1177094,5,B0000022WA,"Kudos to Disney for reaching into thier non animated archives to put out great special editions.
Parent Trap was one of the Non-Animated films from Disney I've been waiting for (another is the first couple of Herbie:The Love Bug movies. The first ""Love Bug"" is confirmed for next year!).
Most of you reading already know the story and how much you like it.
Now, you can rest assured that that movie has gotten a great DVD treatment.
It comes in a new transfer in animorphic widescreen (for the first time on video, the credit sequence is not slightly squeezed like it used to be on pan and scan tapes and laserdiscs).
The color is as vivid as I would expect from a mid 60's technicolor film.
It also comes with a 5.1 remix. The mono soundtrack is not included but the 5.1 mix is quite appropriately understated and seems to use only the original sound elements (unlike JAWS and Superman's 5.1 remixes).
It also comes with a Donald Duck cartoon that will show before the start of the movie (or you can select it from the menu)just like they did in the theatrical release.
The extras include documentaries, commentary with the director David Swift and Hayley Mills, trailers and TV spots, radio spots, soundtrack deconstructions, an interview with Hayley Mill's photo double, still galleries and more.
This release is clearly made for the adult collector while still being all importantly kid friendly.",1020729600,,1400,4.789256198347108

Don't ask me how I've managed to watch it, beginning to end, so many times in my life without driving everyone I know crazy, but by the 100th time I've seen it, it's not like I'm going to stop any time soon. In fact, as I'm writing this review, I'm watching it again...  I first watched it when I was six, catching it on the disney channel when looking for something to watch. It was pretty late in the movie, and I found out the ending before I ever knew who any of the characters were.  But I was hooked. I taped it when I caught it again - by then age eleven, and years and years later, it's not like I'm going to stop watching it. I told everyone who had never seen it, ""See it! Now!"" and even met Hayley Mills when she was travleing in ""The King and I"", telling her how I loved the Parent Trap. She nodded, gave me her autograph, and said, ""Thank you.""

1177102,5,B0000022WA,"As Disney and Haley Mills go, this is a fun movie for the entire family. Kids everywhere need to have control over their lives, whether they do or not; so this whole crazy scheme works.  Parent Trap is just that, a clever plan cooked up by twins,  Sharon and Susan (Haley Mills) who at first try to eliminate the other at summer camp only to discover they have the same parents, both of whom never remarried.  (The camp girls whistle Bridge on the River Kwai while following them to their private exile, cute)  There are very subtle things throughout the movie, Grampa (Charles Ruggles) flicking his cigarette ashes in his palm, only to dump the very ashes onto the beautiful carpet in the same breath. The grandmother is a bit much for me, a bit too haughty for my taste, but perfect for the part! The split screens are enough to fool a casual glimpse, but don't look too hard at the double, she has to be there for certain scenes, but is thinner in the face and her stature is off, it's great though because......Haley plays both parts well enough to make you believe she's both children, only it makes me think the parents are complete fools and never noticed the girls before because they pay no real attention to the differences in Sharon and Susan after they return from camp; their accents, eating habits, stares like they've never layed eyes on the parent before..... (I realize it's supposed to be that way, it's just when the housekeeper knows immediately, this should clue in dad or Hecky, not just the dog) It's a cute, wild ride trying to get Brian Keith to dump his gold digging fiance', Joanna Barnes.  The twins ""submarine"" her during the camping trip, enough to make you crave the ""payback"".  Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara are a perfect couple to play their parts.  (I only had one small problem in my own mind when I saw it with my grandkids; Maureen punching Brian Keith in the eye and blackening it.) I tried to explain why it's alright for the woman to hit the man, but not the other way around, but said it was just a movie, rather uncalled for, her Irish temper aside.  Forget that part and enjoy the movie, I've seen it hundreds of times in the last 40 years and have chuckled every time.",969926400,,2213,4.487562189054726
1177103,5,B0000022WA,"With its simplistic, idealistic vision of two, disparate but equally  appealing lives (Sharon and Susan) and their equally attractive and  appealingly perfect parents, The Parent Trap is one of the all-time best  Disney live-action films.  Hayley Mills has an undeniably magnetic appeal  in her dual role, and, as the antagonistic parents, Brian Keith and Maureen  O'Hara generate real sparks, and real chemistry.  You will root for them as  much as their twin daughters.  Sweetly innocent and at times laugh at loud  funny (all scenes at camp; the camping trip with harridan homewrecker and  golddigger Vicki), this movie promotes an outrageously unbelievable -- and  un-PC philosophy -- but today, in some ways, it feels even more relevant as  a valentine to parenthood.  No wonder it was re-made two years back (the  remake, though charming, has none of the grit and sheer exuberance of this  original) -- this is the dream fulfilled for most kids of broken homes, and  there are more of those now than when this film was initially released in  the 1960s. While it may seem easy to dismiss the Disney machine as  saccharine and not rooted in reality, this movie exemplifies Disney's  artistic ability to combine real, identifiable humor and pathos in a  package that is appealing and retains its innocence at the same time.",968198400,5,1326,5.018433179723503

1177105,5,B0000022WA,"The Parent Trap is one of the best family movies ever made.  Hayley Mills shows that she is a terrific actress by playing the dual role of Sharon McKendrick and Susan Evers.  The plot is simple.  Mitch Evers (Brian Keith)  and Margaret McKendrick (Maureen O'Hara) get married, but realized they  have made a mistake.  They decide to divocre.  However, Margaret is  pregnant with twin girls.  When they divorce, one twin goes with Mom and  the other with Dad.

At first they don't get along, and are  sent to the isolation cabin where they have to spend the entire summer  together.  While there, they realize they are twins, and come up with a  plan to get their parents back together.
This movie is a timeless classic  that will entertain viewers of all ages.  Adults will love it for it's  romance while kids will enjoy the comedy.

I know it word for word, and can actually quote the  movie for someone at any time, which I have done quite a bit, along with my  sister, Jennifer.  The Parent Trap stars Hayley Mills playing twin  daughters of a divorced couple (Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara).  The  girls, who have long been separated, meet accidentally for the first time  at summer camp.  After discovering they are long-lost twin sisters, the two  concoct an outrageous scheme to switch places in an effort to get their  parents back together.  Personally, I don't like the new Parent Trap.  The old one is just... classic.  Although, I have done a ""survey""  with my friend, Elizabeth (another fan of the old one), and found that kids  born from 1990 and up seem to like the new Parent Trap better than the old  one, while it's opposite with people born from 1989 and below.
