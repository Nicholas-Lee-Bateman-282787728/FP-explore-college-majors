8467949,4,B005E7SFJC,"Another MGM ""Made to order"" United Artists film of late 50's. This is a good one with crystal clear B/W photography and good sounsd. A good plot, if familiar, and average but well acted by that oft used, but seldom praised, Western hero Howard Duff, with stong support from Bill Williams and Lita Baron, with Douglas Fowley (hardly recognisable), Jack Pickard, and wm. Phillips. The action is good and whilst I write as a long standing fan of Westerns of this period and budget, I think most fans will enjoy. If you do know the film and are wondering whether it's worth it - Well - it is expensive, but I say go for it while you can. Recomended to all Western fans of it's type. (Does that make sense? It's just that it's not ""The Magnigicent 7""!!)",1349654400,3,748,4.427536231884058
