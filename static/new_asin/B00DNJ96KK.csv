5836264,4,B00DNJ96KK,"To Jennifer is a very interesting experiment by Director James Cullen Bressack (Hate Crime, My Pure Joy, 13/13/13) as he made the entire film on an iPhone 5.  This is significant, especially for those looking to get into film but worry about not being able to afford high end equipment.  Bressack proves that you have the equipment you need in your front pocket.  The gimmick of using a phone to make a film wouldn't work if it isn't well made though, but here that is not the case.

The film itself, starring Chuck Pappas, James Cullen Bressack, Jody Brown and Jessica Cameron, is shot like a video journal.  The lead character Joey (Pappas) is recording this journal to his girlfriend Jennifer (Cameron) he enlists his friends to help him film this journal as he travels to meet face to face with Jennifer to confront her about cheating.  This all starts out fine, and as the viewer initially we feel for Joey.  We've all had that experience and we are along for the ride.  I do not want to get into spoilers because this movie relies heavy on suspense and there is plenty of that in To Jennifer.  The acting is very effective and I want to point out Jessica Cameron as Jennifer.  She is fantastic and emotional in her role and to me a huge stand out.

I do recommend To Jennifer because it is a dark and suspenseful film.  It is not the fast and in your face style that Bressack's film Hate Crime is, this one is a slow burn so you have to stick with it and you get a powerful payoff if you do.  I say it is well worth watching.",1383004800,,1531,4.329824561403509
5836265,4,B00DNJ96KK,"Indie horror movies are usually very predictable. This coming from someone who reviews them for a living. And has seen many. And by the time the film has gotten 15 or 20 minutes into the thick of things, you already have an idea about how it'll wind up concluding. TO JENNIFER though takes you on a quirkily-somewhat-predictable ride for the early portions of its program. But in reality, it's predictable to the viewer only as an illusion. Because what's yet to come is very UNPREDICTABLE! In the most earth-shattering way possible! By the time the film reaches its third act, and eventual conclusion, you're left asking yourself...WOW, how'd I NOT see THAT coming?!

5836266,5,B00DNJ96KK,"A found footage road trip with plenty of arguing, hookers, drugs, a tranny, comedy, panic attack, and watching a crazed ex-boyfriend wanting revenge on his cheating girlfriend...so he thinks. Some things unravel at the end, but not in an overzealous way. After a moment you'll be thinking, so wait he, so how did, oh man! This is why watching TO JENNIFER a couple times is worth it. Plus, producer, writer, director, and editor James Cullen Bressack entertains us playing the role of Steven. Friends on a road trip all have their own personalities that can and will clash, but Steven always somehow made a bad situation comical with his sarcasm.

You'll probably be able to relate some of your friends with the characters in the film. I felt like I was watching one of my friend's video from college. Except instead of IPhones, we had a video cameras that would rest on your shoulder.

TO JENNIFER was actually believable, the mishaps, insulting and mocking each other, having fun and their commitment to helping a friend when their girlfriend cheats on them. As the film moves along, Joey's obsession and anger grows. We learn early by his panic attack on the plane that he's a little unstable. Therefore, his outbursts and reactions are believable, but not exaggerated too much.

Just a few of my highlights:
* I'm going to Google ""how to hack Facebook"" just like Joey did. It sounds so much easier to find out if your girlfriend is cheating on you than a stakeout.

* Prostitute scene. ""Turn the camera off again and I'll d__k slap you...or I'll have her d__k slap you"" as camera pans over to the tranny.

* ""He tried to get me to sleep with a tranny prostitute'"" ""ha-ha, classic Martin""",1377820800,3,1690,4.695945945945946
5836267,4,B00DNJ96KK,"To Jennifer is the story of Joey, a young man who is convinced his girlfriend, the titular Jennifer, is cheating on him. He enlists the aid of his cousin, Steven and his friend Martin, and together they plan a road trip, to catch Jennifer in the act. They are also filming the entire thing with Steven's iPhone, and plan to show the film to Jennifer, so she can see the heartache she's put Joey through.

Strictly speaking, I suppose To Jennifer is a ""found footage"" style film, which as we all know are a dime a dozen these days. To do something original, or even different these days is damn near impossible. It's evident from the very beginning that a lot of thought went into the filming, which makes the fact that it was done entirely on an iPhone even more impressive. The plot isn't needlessly convoluted or over thought, but at the same time isn't non-existent. There's even a twist or two, and character development! Character development in a ""found footage"" movie, that was shot on a cell phone. Tell me that isn't a talented writer/director. Still, as good as To Jennifer is, it isn't without a couple of minor flaws. The pacing slows in a couple spots, when scenes would run a bit long. There were also a scene which, while humorous, seemed un-necessary. The other disappointment was that about halfway through I knew what was going on, and if you're paying attention, you will too.

Still, those minor issues aside, To Jennifer is still an incredibly well made and entertaining film. It didn't pack the emotional punch that Hate Crime did for me, but the ending still managed to get to me. That's something I can't say for most of the films I watch. James Cullen Bressack is a name that we will all be very familiar with in the near future. We need more people like him making films.",1374364800,2,1797,4.560371517027864

5836272,1,B00DNJ96KK,"While it deserves props for being the first film entirely shot on an iPhone, To Jennifer is still just a bad movie.

The ending is completely obvious from the first five minutes, but you have to plod through nearly an hour and a half of NOTHING happening to get there. And then when the story actually progresses, it ends within a minute or two of getting to the actual conflict. And worse, it ends like EVERY found-footage movie ever.

5836281,4,B00DNJ96KK,"How do I feel about To Jennifer? The story was a truly smart and creative out play that twists into an even more creative nightmare. I-even though I don't watch reality television-found myself completely absorbed in the affairs of Joey and Steve. I also related to the fact of trips with unpredictable people not going quite the way I expected, and finding it almost impossible to conceive the desired outcome. I never had it result in such a gruesome resolution, but still I related to the entertainment value of a screwed up turn of events. Added to the fact that Steve found everything happening too funny to take serious, or to see any signs of the true horror in front of him, made the film seem more like watching Youtube video of goof offs- which was clever. You never see the wall until your about to hit it and then it is always too late.

The acting in this film isn't really polished but don't mistake it for amateurish, because the unpolished feel of the characters just lends to the notion that it is a documentary situation of regular guys on a mission. The use of the iphone5 as a filming format is brilliant, and is probably what made the most of this movie viewable, considering it is a slow build to the terrifying outcome as opposed to a set em up  knock em down horror film. The hidden motive that lay under the falderal of the story,(because face it-whining over a break up and wasting energy to pursue this type premise is foolish),  was perfectly timed in its slow reveal. It wasn't until the rundown hotel and hookers that I started to question the lead character Joey. By then  I was so hooked on watching everything play out that, when the ending came, there was no way to prepare for the impact.

I found myself once more held in tight anxiety and awe as Bressack brought back that familiar feeling of horror that I normally associate with his work. It was an experience that started from beginning to end in Hate Crime but wasn't accentuated until the last scenes of To Jennifer, but the effect was the same powerful experience. I think Bressack has found a niche in horror filmmaking. It plays on realism, twists it into almost surrealistic nightmares that, almost feel to real, and yet are completely entertaining. Even in there brutal exposition, of how the really scary s*** that happens is a result of really scary people and not monsters, Bressacks films -To Jennifer no exception-always manage to define a true sense of horror lying in Man.",1432598400,,2475,4.603174603174603
5836282,1,B00DNJ96KK,"So terrible. Way too much screaming from Joey. None of the characters were likable or entertaining to watch. This cinematic experience has been painful. The motel they were supposedly staying in looked like somebody's bedroom in their mom's house. The door to the outside was obviously like a closet or something? I mean, c'mon, it was still carpeted on the outside. And how are we to believe that they got a room in that place that was clearly no longer open??
**SPOILER ALERT**
I don't understand where the text from the beginning came from if he was just crazy the whole time? Did he send it to himself?
Why did the cops never show up? Are we to assume he killed her too?
why would his cousin go into the house with the guy that just murdered his friend?!?! Especially when all the lights were off and he couldn't find him? That means it's time to LEAVE.",1424304000,2,857,4.464968152866242
5836283,3,B00DNJ96KK,"I considered giving this movie just two stars because the character of Steven irritated me so badly but then I kind of looked beyond that and realized that as annoying as he is, he is bellievable  I think we all have one of those guys in our lives, love 'em or hate 'em.  Chuch Pappas is a real find.  He could go from scruffy skater dude looking to drop dead handsome and his voice is one I didn't mind so much listening to.  I have to admit that this is one of the most believable found-footage films I've seen...until the very last few seconds.  I can't say this was a twist ending for me as I figured that out almost immediately as I think most viewers would, so the ending wasn't a surprise but the superfluous sound effects kind of ruined it.  I'm trying to get my opinion across without leaving a spoiler so once you watch, if you do, you'll get what I'm talking about.  All in all, the characters were believable and the acting was pretty good for the most part.  It's not horror though, I guess it would be called drama/suspense?  Not sure about that one since it doesn't fit neatly into one category.  I think it's worth the watch but you may want to fast forward through some of the overdone bits.

5836285,1,B00DNJ96KK,"Sometimes when actors can't act well, they (for some strange reason) think that they'll sound more convincing if they curse every 7th or 8th word. This was one of those movies. The more intense the scene, the more they cursed. (And, in SUPER intense scenes, they'd curse every 4th word--but not a variety of curse words, just some form of the words f_ck and GD--while screaming at the top of their lungs.) The main two guys decided that the audience would better believe them if they continually said GD or f_ck.

There clearly was no script, just a general outline. When an entire movie is improvised, and the actors are inexperienced, they usually tend to do just this. Instead of having to think creatively, they instead use f_ck as a crutch to get their point across. Of course, it never works, as was the case in To Jennifer.

The plot holes in this ""movie"" were immense. (SPOILER ALERT) In the final scene, the main character goes into the house to find Jennifer. He kills the guy Jennifer is with, then sits in the room for about 5 minutes doing nothing. (We know this, because the killer's buddy goes around the house for these five minutes trying to find him.) The buddy walks into a bathroom, with a flashlight, then takes a left. He sees there's a vanity in front of him, yet still jumps when he sees the flashlight's reflection in the mirror. (Truly illogical. There's also the fact that the lights don't work, except for a hallway where the lights are working. Yet, in a room where the lights don't work, there's a fishtank with the light on.)

Instead of going out the front door and leaving the house for help, Jennifer goes out a door leading to the garage. Then hides. For about five minutes. (This is all off camera.) She doesn't open the garage door either! She just hides. Oh, but she's called the police. They're ""on their way."" And the killer, when looking for her, just assumes that she's still in the house while trying to find her. Never even thinks that she's walked out the front door. It's all so illogical.

I, like most reviewers here, would not recommend this movie. And looking at the 5-star reviews, most of them mention the writer/director/lead actor. Usually in the first sentence. They talk about how brilliant he is. They all mention him by full name. Sure. Nothing fishy about that.",1420761600,10,2320,4.610169491525424

Joey defines spastic. When Joey isn't shouting at the camera or someone, the film shows a partial face Joey quietly lamenting. Apparently they wanted to get the contrast of his personality.

5836293,4,B00DNJ96KK,"i didn't expect much given the reviews but I gave it a shot, watching it (not during prime time viewing hours) while I had to do some mindless tasks. So, the feel of the film is kinda like a Bad Lieutenant/Maniac/Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, types of movies. You feel like you need a shower after spending time with these characters. Most of the interactions between the characters seem natural, like you are peeping in on someone's (degenerate) life (degenerate is not an insult). The intensity of Joey's need to get to Jennifer forebodes something that 'something more than what meets the eye is afoot'. That, along with the conflictual situations he got into along the way, created an atmosphere of ' nothing good will come of this' that fully emerges around the 'latter middle to beginning of the end' part, when they stay at that condemned hotel when his friend goes home and lets him use the car. I knew that we had made a sharp left at that point and it did not disappoint from then on. The rest of the film exposed the deranged underbelly beneath the seemingly normal facade. I liked that. The movie is really not bad for what it is: a microbudget, independent, gritty/seamy/fringe walks of life, shot on iphone. You need to adjust your expectations bigtime if you expect anything like that to blow your mind. I appreciate the seamy, underbelly type characters, and the depraved and twisted stories that go along with them. There was nothing in the movie that severely undermined the effect it was going for. The acting was competent and the scenes were adequately shot. I've seen far, far, worse. For that I rounded up to a 4. I'm glad I grew up a horror fan in the golden age of horror, when we appreciated anything that was able to take us on a strange trip.

5836308,2,B00DNJ96KK,"OK, so I gather that this film was shot entirely on a iPhone 5. That's impressive. And the producers managed to get the film distributed on DVD. That's impressive, too. But neither of these facts makes the film enjoyable. There's also a good twist here that links the beginning and the end well. In fact, it's a really good idea. But the ending is botched and the middle is annoying, at least to me.

The problem here is that the premise of the film is that a man has discovered that his girlfriend is cheating on him, so he decides to make a film for her so that she can see the effect her infidelity is having on her. He and two friends go on a semi-aimless road trip that includes all sorts of bizarre events, most notably a pair of prostitutes. And throughout far too much of it, Joey simply screams. The film, according to the commentary, is supposed to explore the theme of madness, but undifferentiated shouting that goes on far too long did not convey to me madness; it just became annoying.

I do appreciate the difficulty of guerrilla filmmaking. And I appreciate the cleverness of the ending. However, starting with a script would have helped. (That's not hyperbole or sarcasm.

This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  First of all, the plot makes no sense.  There are two guys that make a video diary of themselves traveling to a girls house who has ....I guess cheated on one of them.  Ummm....why would the girl sit down and watch the video in the first place if she was cheating?  It makes no sense.  Next the characters are awful. I wanted to kick both of them in the neck the second they came on screen and started mumbling into their cell cameras.

5836313,1,B00DNJ96KK,"In truth this film probably deserves a 2 or perhaps **at most** a 2.5 star rating, however I feel obligated to give it 1 star in order to bring its overall rating closer to its true value... 2/5 stars.

Granted, it's a budget independent film shot on an iPhone. I'll give you that. So what? The plot sucks. I mean truly, truly sucks. The story seems like the brainchild of a demented 12 year old... no depth, no intrigue, and no actual horror here, at least no element of human fear or commentary of human psychology. There was so much potential, but the film totally falls short on exploring the human psychology of the protagonist, nor does it invoke any fear or any abstract thought in its audience. What a disappointment.

The dialogue also sucks. I can't imagine what the script looked like. The highlight of the dialogue in this film is the expletives, which comprise about 40% of all spoken word you'll hear (and probably the best 40% at that). That, and the acting is mediocre. Nothing makes me want to watch these people. The only thing I enjoyed watching was the fight scene where the protagonist gets beat up.

All in all, AVOID this movie. Total waste of time. I understand my review sounds critical for an independent budget film etc, BUT that's no excuse for poor dialogue, awful predictable contrived story, and mediocre acting.",1388534400,25,1343,4.658227848101266

It makes you enjoy just what you are watching. It's a character in the film, all by itself. And, being done on an iphone is all the more impressive!

You sit and you watch the story, and the characters throughout, and while there are hints of predictability, it also turns against what you think is coming making it a good film. It has moments of humor, realism, fear and even confusion. All bringing you in to continue to watch.

5836316,3,B00DNJ96KK,"Im a pretty big fan of found footage films in this genre. While most people seem to be sick of the novelty of them, I cant seem to get enough of them. Im not sure what attracts me to them exactly, but different is good (most of the time) and found footage is just different enough for me.

James Cullen Bressacks To Jennifer is an outstandingly original film with one hell of a hook! Boasted that it was filmed completely on an iPhone, the production value isn't for big film fans. What this movie does manage to pull off is a relatable story for the every man. What would you do, if you suspected your girlfriend of two years of cheating on you? Well, Joey would enlist his cousin Steven and his buddy Martin to go on a road trip, filming every second of it. Hoping to catch his lover Jennifer in the act, confront her on film, and upload it to YouTube. Thus, opening her to internet scrutiny and exposing her for the heartless woman she is.

The beauty of found footage is that it allows you to pull off things that normally would involve lighting, cinematography, and convincing edits. James Cullen Bressack exposes all of the best things this sub-genre has to offer. Also, its nice to see an ff film that doesnt revolve around the paranormal.

If you are a fan of independent horror, then youve probably been following this young directors work. If you havent, he might just move up on your list after watching To Jennifer.

This film gets the Rottin Roger Demarco seal of approval with 2.5 love songs out of 5.",1388361600,2,1515,4.438848920863309
5836317,5,B00DNJ96KK,"James Cullen Bressack has been able to create another independent horror gem in the form of ""To Jennifer"". This ""found footage"" is a heartbreaking tale that deals with the story of Joey and his concern that his girlfriend, Jennifer, of two years, is cheating on him. With the help of his cousin, Steve, and Steve's best friend Martin, they take a cross-country journey to find the answers to Joey's questions. On the way, they find action, adventure and maybe a tranny. Throughout the film, you get to have a better understanding of who these people are, as well as Jennifer. This as far as I will give towards any synapses and there will be no spoilers, since I encourage many others to check out this little indie horror that could. Once again, James is able to give the viewer an interesting characters in the form of Joey, Steve and Martin, all of which you do not want to take a road trip on with. This is a definite recommendation and I would encourage horror fans to give James's films a buy. Support independent horror.",1388361600,,1027,4.586956521739131

You're not sure which direction the plot will go, but you know terrible things will befall the three guys filming a video diary to expose a cheating girlfriend.

5836320,4,B00DNJ96KK,"This 2013 suspenseful POV film written and directed by James Cullen Bressack gives you a renewed appreciation for the POV style while also satisfying anyone hungry for some real life horror.

This story documents a riveting road trip taken on by a guy named Joey (Chuck Pappas) who fears that his girlfriend Jennifer (Jessica Cameron) is cheating on him. With all the confusion and hurt that would erupt from a failing 2 year relationship, this trip gets strange. Accompanied by his cousin and a helpful friend, the entire trip is recorded and planned to be the perfect send off for the unfaithful Jennifer.

The POV technique brings about concern for some people, and with so many films using it poorly, I couldn't blame you. With that said, this film brings the appropriate feel to the table. Its shot in a very smooth manner that gives the viewer a genuine experience. Youll find that even though it is POV, youll focus more on the story and characters versus the style of the shot.

The story itself is believable as well. There isn't anything over the top or in your face which in turn allows you to actually get sucked into whats going on - youll listen to the characters and believe whats going on. Youll find that by the end of the movie you're more on the edge of the seat than you thought you were/would be. The film starts off so innocent, yet picks up steam - don't you worry. It was nice to see a movie that let the found footage feel real versus applying something crazy into the storyline for some sort of superficial satisfaction.

When its all said and done, youll understand the special character that Joey is, and if you stick around for the credits, youll truly come to realize how scary our technologically connected society can be when intertwined with a psychopath.

The style might not be new, but the story is. The particular iPhone usage and relationship drama is very relevant and something that I would assume is easy to relate to in our day and age. If allowed to actually follow the characters, youll understand a greater appreciation towards the story. Much is lost if you quickly categorize this as just an indie POV film - with that said I consider it a solid film that was fun to watch!",1388275200,3,2220,4.581863979848866

Whether its their clever and original story or a great villain/surprise twist in the end that somewhat makes up for a boring hour leading up to it. Then some are classics like VHS, Clover field, Quarantine, Chronicles (My all time favorite) and Trollhunter. But this one my friends...wow.

I'm sorry but there isn't a single nice thing I can say. Nothing at all that I enjoyed about this movie. The fact that it even became a movie and was put on my Amazon Prime which I PAY for was a complete joke and travesty. I LOVE amazon but come on guys, how did you let this garbage get through your streaming service? I'm currently writing a screenplay for my own found footage movie, so if there's anything nice I can say, its that this movie gives me the confidence that my movie will succeed and go far. So yea, I guess To Jennifer actually did one good thing besides waste and hour and a half of my life which I can never get back. To think me and my gf wanted to watch a nice little movie and this is what we got. Anyway back to the review. Halfway way through you already know how it's going to end. Nothing surprising with the story really that hasn't been done or greater. The characters are all annoying. And if your expecting some big cool ending I'm sorry guys.

8595031,4,B00DNJ96KK,"At first,To Jenniferseems like just another found footage video. If it weren't in the ""Horror"" section of Amazon Prime, it would have been unclear if this were a crime video or what. Since it was, that was the expectation.

In the beginning, seemingly normal guy Joey talks about how he got an accidental text message from his 2-year-long girlfriend Jennifer,something like ""How about you come finish what you started last night ;)""He explains how he plans on bringing his cousin Steve with him to his hometown (I'm not entirely sure if the movie ever said the name of the town) to record on video the events leading to him catching Jennifer cheating. A few snags are caught, because Joey soon starts having some emotional outbursts, little by little, which leads the viewer to realize things just aren't right about him, or his situation.

Their friend Martin who picks them up from the hospital, is stoner and a party animal, and he convinces a reluctant Joey to go out partying and try to ""forget about Jennifer."" However, Joey is unable to follow through with Martin's attempts to get him some action, and he hides out in the bathroom and documents himself vulnerably telling Jennifer he could never cheat on her like she did to him. It seems very real and despite thoughts that ""something's not right here.""

The movie is pretty predictable, as most films in this genre tend to be. The tone, and the way it is shot entirely with an iPhone, make To Jennifer unique to its class. The acting was decent considering, particularly Chuck Pappas who plays Joey. He does a remarkable job going from nice, sweet, heartbroken guy to mega-crazy psycho in a moment's notice. He sings a song during the end credits that not only adds crazy creep points, but also inspired a Google search for more.

Anyway, I couldn't give it a 3 because I thought it was unique, it wasn't too much shaky-cam, and the acting was decent considering the genre. It didn't make me want to take some migraine meds, and I didn't want to throw anything at the TV out of annoyance at anyone (except perhaps Martin). I would give it more like a 3.5 but I rounded up. If you're a fan of the genre, I recommend this. If not, you might want to skip this one if you're worried about the beginning being a bit boring.",1477267200,,2278,4.603448275862069
