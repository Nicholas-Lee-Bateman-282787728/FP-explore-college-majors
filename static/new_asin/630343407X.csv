7846434,5,630343407X,"This is a terrific video that I have watched countless times. Fascinating observations and anecdotes about Mr. B from the ballerinas who worked closely with him. The chronological progression from his first ballerina to his last gives you an idea of the scope of his career.
I wish this was available on DVD.",1196121600,2,308,4.830188679245283
7846435,5,630343407X,"I value this video so much and have watched it countless times. I love hearing about the development and early years of the New York City Ballet from the dancers who were there and helped make it possible, Mary Ellen Moylan, Maria Tallchief, Melissa Hayden and Allegra Kent.
As they describe these early years and their own development as dancers there are stiils and some footage of usually poor quality- which is why their recorded memories are that much more valuable. Filming images then wasn't as easy as it is today! But their memories of the excitement they felt dancing and working with Balanchine are strong. So strong that a couple of times Allegra Kent slips and speaks in the present tense.""Exciting"" and ""Exhilarating"" are two words they all use at some point to describe their experiences.
 There are also interviews with Merill Ashley and Darci Kistler- the latter being the youngest dancer made principal in the history of the NYCB.In part, I would think because as she says, ""Balanchine said to me, 'You know, I don't have much time.'""  Notably missing is Suzanne Farrell, arguably Balanchine's greatest muse. But the dancer's who speak of her are honest and diplomatic in describing her presence in the company and how it effected them. And there is included a short clip from Apollo showing Ms. Farrell with Peter Martins.
If you are a fan of ballet and of Balanchine's work, I really believe this is a ""must have"".",977184000,38,1434,4.82520325203252
7846436,4,630343407X,"This was good for its in-depth interviews with the women who danced for Balanchine (Maria Tallchief, etc).  For someone looking for more studio footage, however, this may not be the video for you.  While certainly  interesting, it is interview- heavy.",957657600,28,251,5.225
7846437,5,630343407X,"Not only was George Balanchine one the most influencial people of our century, he was an innovator, entrepreneur, choreographer, and most importantly an influence.  In this video you will learn about the  unmeasurable impact this ""artistic director"" had on the ballet  world, as well as his impact on the human spirit.  You will see from the  interviews the emotions he derived from his dancers.  The enlightenment  portrayed , as well as the tears shown help you to realize how Mr. B not  only changed ballet as we know it, but people as well.",946339200,17,544,4.774193548387097
