8687340,5,B00PC088K2,"As this is extremely hard to get these days, I went through a lot of pain to locate this plus the episodes/ovas and ended up spending a lot. There's ONE fault with this, and it's not the fault of the seller, it's the fault of who distributes this now - Warner Brothers. Only You, the first movie in the series was 100 mins (actually 143 if you add the trailer that came after the credits). The version in this box set is the 90 min one, WB doesn't have the rights to that 10 extra min version for some reason. Very stupid, they should ante up the money and find a copy of it.

Regardless, these look beautiful. They're not redone to the point of looking soft and bright and fuzzy, they're just cleaned up and you can see the grain in the animation. We are talking about 30 year old films now, the audio is good, and clean and all of them are 2.0 PCM Stereo, with the exception of Beautiful Dreamer which also boasts a 5.1 Surround track as well.

It's a shame this ended with an inconclusive ending (no spoilers to be given - either buy this and watch it or look it up on the Internet) but otherwise, it completes the set if you get the TV Series and OVAs as well.",1498176000,,1164,4.146017699115045
