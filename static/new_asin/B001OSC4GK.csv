3736220,5,B001OSC4GK,"I'm pregnant and we wanted something to show our 7 year old what was going on in my belly. She'd seen all the books and flyers I had, but I think this made it seem a bit more real to her. A lot of the imagery is computer animated, but the real footage is pretty cool. An adult who's read up on pregnancy would only learn a little from this, but for a young person this has a lot of amazing info.
For our daughter we did skip the very beginning, where it was talking about ejaculation, etc, and started her off where the egg was already fertilized and traveling down the fallopian tube. We also skipped the live birth at the end. She loved watching this, though at some points it did seem to drag a bit.
When she decided to watch the ""Animals"" disc in the set, I had to do quite a bit of proactive editing (""Close your eyes, quick, while I fastforward this part!"") because it shows each of the different animals mating. While this is natural and I saw that kind of stuff when I was younger than her, she's been more sheltered than I was and isn't quite ready for it yet. Forgive me if it's there and I missed it, but I kind of wish there was a setting for young kids I could select that automatically skips those sections.
Overall I'm happy with this set and would buy it again. It's been great getting to share with my daughter all the little things that are happening within me over the next few months :)",1317513600,8,1406,4.172794117647059
3736221,5,B001OSC4GK,The 3- and 4-D computer enhanced photography makes this set unique.  I was totally spellbound.,1278633600,3,94,5.266666666666667
3736222,4,B001OSC4GK,"I am really happy with obtaining such a material. It shows the journey of that little baby in details, the real images, and simulations are just something that you can differentiate, I would recommend this product for everyone, it answers a lot of questions, and it raise a lot of interesting facts.
Thanks NationalGeographic, and thanks for amazon, the shipping was another aspect that Amazon used to show their professionality...",1265760000,8,431,5.171428571428572
3736223,5,B001OSC4GK,"I had watched the videos on the National Geographic Channel a couple of times and thought they would be helpful in my profession,  I am a pastor and counsellor for a small church and use the videos for premarital counselling, as well as, one on one youth education.
After attempting to purchase the set from the producer without success, I found them on Amazon.com, they are top quality videos.
I personally feel every young lady and man twelve years and older should view the information contained in that documentary.",1263859200,12,519,4.831460674157303
3736224,5,B001OSC4GK,"This is an excellent film detailing conception and subsequent development of a new human being.

3736256,5,B001OSC4GK,"Amazing set of DVDs.

One of my best friends found out she was having twins, so I sent her this video set.
She was absolutely thrilled by everything she saw and learned from this documentary.

If you know anyone about to be having twins or triplets, this makes a very thoughtful gift, as they will learn what is happening inside their own body.",1394064000,2,344,4.444444444444445

8331392,5,B001OSC4GK,Fascinating. I used this in my 7th grade class. It was informative on many levels. It was well worth the multiple class sessions it took to watch.
