7928456,4,B00004ZERG,"This is a collection of four episodes of the Showtime series The Hunger.  Each episode is complete and introduced by David Bowie.
In the first story we have woman and her doppelganger.  One thinks the other will try to kill her and the other is having strange dreams about a smallpox outbreak.
The second story concerns the last witch in a long line of powerful witches.  She is casting spells against a man who stopped loving her.  Things get strange when her mother hires a new personal nurse.
The third story concerns a man who must oversee the demolition of his estranged father's house.  But a secret room is found in the basement containing a strange brass bed and items of occult design.
The final story has two researchers conspire at an agricultural firm.  New technologies could make the company a gigantic fortune but one executive stands in the way.  An ancient seed encased in amber might hold the key.
Each story is complete unto itself and can be watched separately.  This is a Showtime series, so there is plenty of nudity and sex that makes this unsuitable for many viewers.",1071100800,8,1091,4.675392670157068
7928457,3,B00004ZERG,"This is not the vampire movie with David Bowie, Susan Sarandon and Catherine Deneuve, but rather a collection of 4 episodes from the 1997-1998 and 1999-2000 Showtime series ""The Hunger"".
Produced by Ridley Scott (of ""Blade Runner"" and ""Alien"" fame) and his brother Tony, and hosted by Terence Stamp in the 1st season and David Bowie in the 2nd, the series was always well-filmed and produced but somewhat hit-or-miss in its scrips and acting. Nudity is a staple.
The ""Bump in the Night"" DVD has these 2nd season episodes:
1) Brass - the bed and brass mirror of a dead satanist reveal dark secrets for his son. Also features a babe witch!
2) The Night Bloomer - weirdo plant lady with an ancient seed seduces ambitious marketing exec into a rather farfetched plot to get rid of their lousy boss.
3) The Diarist - Woman tries to save a man from his previous lover, a witch bent on revenge. Best of the 4 eps on this DVD.
4) Double - Tank Girl Lori Petty stars as a woman who finds she has an identical double. They both suffer strange nightmares, which leads to a struggle for their souls. From a story by Karl Edward Wagner.",1029196800,6,1123,4.482926829268293
