8114540,5,B000EUKZT2,"As I recall, this webpage doesn't give the namees of the songs.  The songs in this 45 minute DVD live compilation are:  Le Cheval,  Les Vieux, La Chanson de Jacky, Ne Me Quitte Pas, Amsterdam, Mon Enfance, Mathilde, Ces Gens-La, Jef, Les Bonbons 67, Le Plat Pays.

Jacques Brel who died of lung cancer from too much smoking in about 1974 was lucky in many ways.  One way he was lucky is that there is a plethora of recordings on CD and even hours of his ""live performances"" on video with him performing on stage.  Thus, even after 30 years it's almost as though he's still with us.

He was certainly ""a great singer/songwriter""---no question about it.  If you are new to Jacques Brel, this moderately priced DVD would be a good place to get to know his art.  The ""problem"" is that he sings in French and some of us don't know the French language.  I really believe you have to read the words of these songs as he sings them to get the full impact of what he is singing and communicating.  Because there are no translations included in this DVD,  the English speaking person needs to seek out the translations somehow.  Perhaps some of the translations are on line.  Another way to obtain the translations is to purchase a double CD called ""Infinitement"" also on Amazon.  If you get the NON-import version translations are included.  Thus if you get BOTH the DVD and the CD you can hear M. Brel and SEE him--and your investment will be well rewarded by exciting performances of well written and beautifully orchestrated songs.

PS:  The format is listed on the Amazon website at ""NTSC"" which is the format for North America.  PAL is for Europe.  I was informed by a friend today to whom I loaned this DVD that it would not play on at least ONE of his DVD players---a player that is about 5-6 years old.  I tried the DVD again on my 3 DVD players and my computer.  I found that the DVD worked on my computer with Windows XP and ""Power DVD"" and it worked on 2 of the newer of my DVD players but it would NOT work on my 6 year old DVD player.  So, if it doesn't play on your DVD player I hope Amazon will accept it for refund and return...or you could spend another $20 at your local DVD store to get it ""transferred"" to NTSC.  Good luck! boland7214@aol",1196035200,4,2314,4.373239436619718
