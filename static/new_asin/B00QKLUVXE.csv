8691783,2,B00QKLUVXE,"This is a `film' from French director Alain Guiraudie who got a lot of attention for `Stranger by the lake'. In this film from 2009 we have a 43 year old tractor salesman Armand - who is gay and likes to cruise the local beauty spot for `older men' falling in love with a 16 year old girl.

Her father does not like it and neither do the police. So they go on the `run'. This basically means panting about the woods in various states of undress then stopping for a bit of al fresco rutting.

Now there are some very well observed conversations about love and relationships and the whole point of life. They are by far the most appealing aspects to this movie. Where it falls down is in the sheer lack of credibility of the plot. The idea that any police force this side of North Korea has the power or manpower to behave the way they do here is ludicrous. The love story is also badly realised and the running away scenes are not even pretentious enough to be laughable.

This is a film where you could watch segments on fast forward and you would not miss a jot. I found it massively underwhelming and a bit insulting to the intelligence to be honest. This is one I should not have bothered with as I felt a lot of the problems with the aforementioned `Stranger by the lake' are prevalent here too. I will not be beating a path to watch any more of Mousier Guiraudie's future efforts. But if you can suspend belief for an hour and a half and enjoy `bear' types in the woods then this may be worth a punt.",1452902400,,1505,4.21875
