1900936,3,B0000A1HPQ,"I believe that most people buy a ""Best of"" title mainly to see some of their favorite skits.  Don't set your expectations too high here.  This is just 76 minutes long, which includes outtakes, tv interviews, a dress rehearsal, and some recognizable skits.  One can always argue about what should be on a ""Best of"", but this is so limited as to leave one convinced that this was made short to allow for other ""Favorites"" to be bundled up by producers for other DVD's to be released later.  Disappointing.",1062374400,8,503,4.617977528089888
1900937,5,B0000A1HPQ,"Out of all the Saturday Night Live collections that I have viewed, this one is the most consistently funny.  Like some of her fellow SNL alumni, she may not have carved out a film career for herself, but she still does some of the most side-splitting routines.  This DVD contains two Mary Katherine Gallagher sketches, her Betty Broderick monologue and her meeting Tina Turner; her Sally O'Malley ""I'm 50 years old"" bit with Danny De Vito; her spot-on impression of Courtney Love; the giddily over-the-top sketch about ""joyologist"" Helen Madden; her impression of a spaced-out Elizabeth Taylor randomly spewing out lottery numbers; her Jeannie Darcy bit in the elderly ward (""Don't get me started""); and the ""Schweaty Balls"" sketch with Alec Baldwin.  Some of the other routines, such as the Veronica & Co. clip, the Anna Nicole Smith scene (poorly developed) and the airport bar scene with Will Ferrell, are less consistently funny.  However, the first 45 minutes or so of this DVD more than compensate for the last 20 minutes.  If I wanted to cheer up a friend, I would give him or her this DVD.  In fact, I know that I will give it to some of my colleagues in the future.  This DVD is heads above my Dana Carvey, Steve Martin, and Will Ferrell DVDs.  How much do I like this Molly Shannon?  Don't get me started!",1060905600,5,1315,4.682608695652174
1900948,2,B0000A1HPQ,"This DVD was disappointing. The 65 minutes of skit material here is generally just not that funny, although I enjoyed the last one on the disc (Molly and Will Ferrell on a first date at an airport lounge).  I skipped through a lot of them.  It's hard to believe that SNL didn't have a lot of better material to include on this disc.  Molly is really talented -- consider, for example, her appearances on Will and Grace (hilarious).

1900993,5,B0000A1HPQ,"In my opinion, SNL was at its tops when Molly Shannon was part of the cast. The way she portrays her hilarious characters keeps you laughing throughout the whole DVD. They put together a great compilation of her greatest skits, however, I was bummed when the DVD was over. I wanted MORE! Luckily, the bonus features, such as the Conan interviews are just as funny... especially the one about Gary Coleman! If you enjoy a good laugh then this is a great buy for you!",1182816000,,465,4.482352941176471
1900994,1,B0000A1HPQ,"Very disappointed with this collection of Molly Shannon. There were so many more worthy skits she did on SNL. There was only one skit I enjoyed - the Sally O'Malley skit, but it wasn't the best of this series and probably inserted due to Danny DeVito's appearance rather than the quality of the skit.

The other skits were just not funny.",1182643200,,338,4.540983606557377
1900995,3,B0000A1HPQ,"This DVD is, of course, hilarious.  Molly Shannon is one of the most talented performers to grace the SNL stage.  I think they could have chosen some different skits, though. I can't understand why they chose something like the Blind Date skit over one of the Dog Show episodes or even the teen Goth show, I forget the title.  Even though the DVD lacks, somewhat, it's a worthwhile purchase if you enjoy her work.",1180742400,2,413,4.554054054054054

I have to say the take off of NPR with the Christmas ""Schwetty Balls"" is still one of the funniest SNL sketches I've ever seen.  And sad to say that the DVD's last skit about dating was not one of the sketches I would have included.  They should have replaced it with another one with Mary Catherine Gallagher.  Don't get me started. ...Don't even get me started!  But there is no doubt, Molly Shannon is one VERY funny woman (and so is my wife)!",1175385600,,567,4.456310679611651
1900997,3,B0000A1HPQ,"There are some very funny skits on this DVD, but whoever chose the ""Best"" certainly had a different perspective than this viewer. There are also a number of duds here, and unfortunately, not a number of her very funny skits.",1168300800,,224,4.625
1901003,3,B0000A1HPQ,"Saturday Night Live -- The Best of Molly Shannon is a worthwhile look back at Molly's fine stint on the show. Most of Molly's best characters are highlighted (Mary Katherine Gallagher, Sally O'Malley, Veronica) but the show's missing something.  As many of the SNL Best Of programs, some of the artists' best, edgiest sketches are left out in favor of safer, sometimes boring material.  How did the Dog Show sketches (with Will Ferrell) not make the cut?

The DVD ""extras"" are good.  Check out Molly's two appearances on Conan.  Funny stuff.",1161302400,2,541,4.9010989010989015
1901004,1,B0000A1HPQ,"This DVD was pure torture.  It made me more and more angry as the minutes ticked by.  I was so dissapointed that I wrote this review even though I rented it in the first place.  While Shannon was great on SNL, the producers somehow managed to cobble together all of her least funny material for this DVD.",1159660800,6,304,4.298245614035087
1901005,3,B0000A1HPQ,"My two all-time favorite SNL actresses are definitely Molly Shannon and Gilda Radner, so I was psyched to see that SNL was putting out DVDs focusing on its actors. I rented this DVD at my favorite video rental store and figured I'd buy it if I liked it. Now, I'm not so sure I will.

For one thing, I was expecting this collection to be more comprehensive than it actually was. It seemed as though the skits presented were just a sampling of Molly Shannon's best. Where are all the Mary Katherine Gallagher skits? This collection only features two and they are not the best, in my opinion. (My favorite skit, that I was hoping to see, feautures a production of West Side Story that goes horribly wrong with Mary Katherine Gallagher pulling an imaginary gun and yelling, ""Stay back! Stay back!"")

The skits that are included are quite good and there were several that I had never seen before. Sally O'Malley, the 50-year-old Rockette wannabe skit is hillarious. Also, Molly's imitation of Courtney Love is dead-on.

Hopefully, if I watch some of the other DVDs in the series, I might be able to catch some of the skits I was missing. Maybe if the DVDs do well enough, SNL will put out a volume 2 of Molly Shannon, featuring more skits. For now, this is an okay but not great collection. I give this DVD three stars, but in my opinion, Molly Shannon gets 10 stars. Superstar!",1150588800,,1373,4.528225806451613
1901006,5,B0000A1HPQ,"I must say that honestly, this is one of the funniest collections of comedic characters ever.  Molly Shannon is pure genius when it comes to her characters and their development.  Reading other reviews, it occurred to me that her humor is best saved for those of intelligent standing.  Her comedic style and timing are overtly funny and perfectly maneuvered by those of higher intellect.  In an era of people that enjoy mainstream mediocre comedy movies, like Wedding Crashers and Old School, Molly Shannon's comedy stands above the rest.  Her humor is best appreciated by those that think Joey from ""FRIENDS"" is nothing compared to the wit of Chandler. Molly Shannon never goes for the lowest common denominator (unfortunately not like some of her colleagues on SNL sometimes) in her humor. The more I watch this DVD, the more I laugh.  Jeannie Darcy is by far one of the most quotable characters in television comedic history.  Her impressions of Courtney Love and Elizabeth Taylor are uncanny.  This CD is a must for the intellectual viewer, whose sense of comedy exceeds the slapstick and idiotic nature of mainstream comedy today.  In short, ""I Luv it... I Luv it... I Lu-----v it!",1145232000,4,1186,4.919597989949748
1901007,3,B0000A1HPQ,"This dvd was OK. They had a couple mary catherine sketches; not the funniest ones, but they were alright. The rest of the sketches were kind of funny too. If you buy this dvd expect some warm tingly feelings or a slight giggle, but no loud chuckles here. If you really want the best of molly shannon, buy the Superstar dvd instead.",1142467200,,331,4.354838709677419
1901008,3,B0000A1HPQ,"I would like to know who chooses the 'best' moments for all of these 'best of' collections! This collection for Molly definitely doesn't show a LOT of her funniest moments on SNL. Where is Goth Talk and Dog Show??? I was disappointed, and usually am, when I purchase these 'best of' SNL collections. The only decent ones so far would be that of Will Ferrell (the 1st one) and Jimmy Fallon. It really makes me angry that whoever chooses the skits to put on these DVDs makes some very poor choices. In reading some other reviews, I know I am not alone here.

Let ME do the job!!",1133568000,4,576,4.333333333333333
1901009,5,B0000A1HPQ,"For seven years Molly Shannon ignited the ""Saturday Night Live"" stage with a comedic falir not seen in any female cast member since Gilda Radner. Whether performing one of her memorable recurring characters, impersonating an annoying figure in the news perfectly or engaging in intense physical comedy reminiscent of Farley and Belushi, Molly could always be counted on to garner gargantuan laughs from the audience.

""The Best Of Molly Shannon"" captures all of her best moments from those seven years, focusing, as most of the best - of's do, on her famed recurring characters. And what a gas they are - from Mary Katherine Gallagher to Helen Madden to Terri Rialto (in the classic ""Schwetty Balls"" sketch with Alec Baldwin), they are all hilarious and adorable, just like Shannon herself. Also, four great impressions of her are here. There's her famed Courtney Love imitation in which the Hole singer hosts her own talk show with hysterical results. There's her as Elizabeth Taylor hilariously reading the lotto numbers on ""Weekend Update"". Anne Miller and Debbie Reynolds (played by Cheri Oteri) interviewing Frank Sinatra (played by Phil Hartman, another ""SNL"" all time legend) on ""Leg Up"". Then there's Anna Nicole Smith on ""FANatic"". Well, I personally think there's a better sketch with her as Anna out there, but this one is pretty funny.

This dvd is not perfect. For starters, two of her most popular recurring characters are missing. They are Circe Nightshade from ""Goth Talk"" and Miss Colleen from ""Dog Show"". They could've cut out ""Jeannie Darcy At St. Joseph's"" and ""Veronica And Co."" in favor of these two much funnier sketches. (To be fair, there's a great ""Goth Talk"" on ""The Best Of Chris Kattan, but ""Dog Show"" has been a hold out for all the best - of's, appearing in only a 10 second clip on ""The Best Of Will Ferrell"", which incidentally is also hilarious). And they definitely could have cut out the airport bar date sketch at the end and replaced it with either her Meredith Vierra impression on ""The View"" or a complete Monica Lewinsky sequence (there's only a 50 second clip shown in the beginning of the disc).

Overall, a great sampling of Molly's work on ""SNL"". Other than the two Conan O'Brien interviews and the Margaret Healy bit, the extras are nothing great. What would have been nice is if they included Molly's audition tape. But still, it's hilarious. Molly is a cast member who deserves a volume two. But until then, this will so do.",1110153600,8,2472,4.8530805687203795
1901010,4,B0000A1HPQ,"Will Ferrell and Molly Shannon were like two peas in a pod on ""Saturday Night Live."" They had good chemistry and when they combined forces they could induce plenty of laughs. Of course, Will Ferrell is equally funny without Molly Shannon. ""The Best of Molly Shannon"" proves it is exactly the opposite for her.
Yeah, she's a funny lady, but she pales in comparison to such ""SNL"" comediennes as Gilda Radner, Jane Curtain, and even Chery Oteri, who is very goofy. Molly Shannon's ""Best Of"" collection is fine, I suppose, but I didn't laugh that much -- and not nearly as often as I did with Will Ferrell's ""Best Of"" DVD.
Here she plays her most famous (and mostly original) characters: Salley O'Malley, Mary Katherine Gallagher, Courtney Love and Anna Nicole Smith (in a disgusting but funny segment with Ben Affleck), among others. But they're never exactly laugh-out-loud funny; I smiled a few times. I enjoyed some of the gags. But I was only really laughing when Will Ferrell was interacting with Molly.
Whether or not they are good films is definitely arguable, but there's a reason that Will Ferrell has been cast in virtually every mainstream Molly Shannon film. They go together. She cameos in his movies, he cameos and/or stars in hers. Remember ""Superstar""? Remember ""A Night at the Roxbury""? Maybe they're not good, but at least Lorne Michaels was smart enough to realize that the two have some sort of chemistry.
I noticed that Molly Shannon likes to move around a lot. I watched the Conan O'Brian interview with her (included on the DVD), and she absolutely could not sit still at all, just like her ""Joyologist"" character, who, in the DVD's outtakes, flipped over her chair from moving around so much.
She's good as Courtney Love, and Molly Shannon is undoubtedly a good comedic actress, but to say that she deserves her own collection of best moments at this point in time is a bit presumptuous, especially considering the fact that classic ""SNL"" actors have yet to appear in any sort of ""Best Of"" DVD collections. (Or am I just not finding them on Amazon and in the stores?) Besides, most of the compiles sketches aren't even that great -- or is it just that Molly Shannon herself isn't that great? I hope it's the former.
If you're a fan of Molly Shannon and/or ""Saturday Night Live,"" I would definitely pick up this DVD. I bought it for fourteen dollars, and I've got to say that I'll probably return to it once and a while for some good grins. But not nearly as often as I am already returning to ""The Best of Will Ferrell,"" which still stands as the best ""Saturday Night Live"" DVD I own at the current time (only three, but I'm getting there).
""Saturday Night Live: The Best of Molly Shannon"" runs 76 minutes. It contains outtakes, a deleted dress rehearsal scene, a picture gallery, two TV interviews with Conan, and so on. It is not rated, but contains some language and sexual content/partial nudity. The feature's guest stars include, among others: Val Kilmer, Matthew Broderick, Gabriel Byrne, Tina Turner, Alex Baldwin, et al. It is now available on video and DVD.",1069977600,9,3088,4.720370370370371
1901011,4,B0000A1HPQ,"Molly Shannon's presence is sorely missed on ""Saturday Night Live"" but not you can relive some of her finest moments with this DVD. Although I personally would have chosen some different sketches , this DVD is sure to put a big smile on even the grumpiest of faces.
Included are:
""Mary Katherine Gallagher""- Mary auditions for the school variety show and sings ""Sometimes When We Touch"" and does a Meredith Baxter Birney tv movie monologue. (with Gabriel Byrne)
""Helen Madden, Licensed Joyologist""- ""I love it! I love it!"" Helen appears on ""Pretty Living"", hosted by Ana Gasteyer. (with Matthew Broderick)
""The Courtney Love Show""- Courtney's got a talk show, and she interviews Julie Andrews (played by Christine Baranski)
""Elizabeth Taylor""- Elizabeth picks the winning lottery numbers on Weekend Update (""Gladiator!"")
""Jeanne Darcy""- the very unspontaneous and over rehearsed comedienne makes an inappropriate appearance at a nursing home.
""Monica Lewinsky""- Monica addresses court, with Hillary watching.
""Sally O'Malley""- Sally auditions to be a Rockette! ""I'm 50 years old! And I like to kick! Stretch! And kick!"" (with Danny DeVito).
""Veronica & Co.""- The European supermodel has a talk show whose set is located in the middle of a fashion show runway (with Val Kilmer).
""Delicious Dish On NPR""- Molly & Ana Gasteyer as the very low-key hosts of a radio cooking show. This is the famous ""Schweaty Balls"" episode (with Alec Baldwin).
""Leg Up!""- Molly as Ann Miller, and Cheri Oteri as Debbie Reynolds.  (with Phil Hartman as a very cranky Frank Sinatra)
""MTV FANatic""- Molly as Anna Nicole Smith (with Ben Affleck as an obsessed fan who looks to Anna Nicole for a mother figure).
""Mary Katherine Gallagher""- Mary meets the real Tina Turner by hiding in her dressing room. (with Alec Baldwin)
""Rae Murphy""- an awkward blind date at an airport bar goes horribly wrong (with Will Ferrel and Chris Kattan).
""Dress Rehearsal Sketch""- that was cut from the final broadcast features Molly as an odd, accent loving girl who brings home date Bill Paxton to meet her parents (with Ana Gasteyer and Horatio Sanz).
Also features a photo gallery of Molly in different costumes, outtakes: Molly as Xena, Princess Warrior (with Brendan Frasier), as Helen Madden (with Ben Stiller), NPR's Delicious Dish (with Alec Baldwin), 70's Ladies In Bar (with Calista Flockhart), Dog Show! (with Will Ferrell- it's just a teeny blooper clip), and Jeanne Darcy on Weekend Update.
Two more goodies: two appearances on Conan O'Brien.  On the first one she discusses how Courtney Love didn't seem pleased to be parodied and how Gary Coleman once trapped her in his hotel bathroom and tried to put the moves on her; the other appearance is with Will Ferrell and she talks about dating and a new sketch she was working on called ""Hot Cocoa Girls.""
Great collection! I would have given it five stars had it included some ""Goth Talk"" and ""Dog Show"" sketches on it. My absolute favorite Mary Katherine Gallagher sketch isn't here either (Gwenyth Paltrow was the host that week)- but it'd be nearly impossible to include everyone's favorites. I'd say that Molly Shannon definitely deserves a second ""Best Of"" DVD!",1065744000,70,3183,5.0494296577946765
