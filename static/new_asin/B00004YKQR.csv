1376241,4,B00004YKQR,"Yes, the movie concept is highly unlikely.  However, we are talking about Disney, and they are willing to stretch a persons imagination.  This movie does just that.
Katie Sagal gives an excellent performance as Smart House...well, the disembodied voice of Smart house.  Well, Disembodied until towards the end...Watch the movie to see what I mean.
Also, Ryan Merriman (Ben Cooper), gives an superb performance was a very self-disciplined, angry young man.  His mother is dead, and he and his sister and father have done well since her passing.  Ryan is the one that keeps the family washed, feed and ready for each day.  This young Actor [merriman], is such a sight to watch.  For a young man of 17, he is a fantastic site to see on the screen.  His acting is top rate.  He could be pulling in bigger roles.  I hope to see more of him in the future.",984528000,4,849,4.562913907284768
1376242,5,B00004YKQR,"I love Disney Channel Original Movies! They are a gret source of entertainment! This is the story of Ben Cooper Whos mom is dead. So he does all the house hold chores. He wins a ""Smart House"" that does it all for him so that he can do fun stuff with friends! But when he tries to give the house motherly characteristics, his plan backfires and the house creates a digital image of a woman known as PAT. PAT puts the family under house arrest and it's up to Sarah, the houses creater and Ben's dad's love intrest, to save them! This movie teaches kids to be open to new ideas! I recomend that you rent it today!",982108800,6,610,4.177966101694915
1376243,5,B00004YKQR,"I don't really like made for t.v. movies too much. But Disney makes some pretty good ones. This is the story of Ben Cooper. His mom passed away when he was young and his dad works a lot so he gets stuck with some pretty big tasks that 14 year old boys shouldn't have to deal with. Such as cooking dinner, cleaning the house,etc... So when there is a contest to win the worlds first ever ""Smart House"", a house that does everything for you such as cook, clean, etc..., Ben tries with all his might to win. And he does! But it turns out to be a lot more than he's prepaired for. When Ben tries to give the house human emotions and characteristics of a mother, his plans go hay-wire, causing the house to create a digital image of a woman. When the dad falls in love, the house gets jealous and puts the family under house arrest. Literally! It's a pretty funny movie. I like when the house does Ben's homework and beats up the class bully! Rent it today at your local video store because this price is really high!",981763200,7,1012,4.221649484536083
1376244,5,B00004YKQR,"Even though the plot was a little flimsy, I liked this movie.  Ben Cooper enters a contest on the internet to win a house, but before you know it, things start to get wacky.  I remember Ryan Merriman (Ben) from Deep End of the Ocean---he has a lot more screen time in this film.",979689600,2,278,4.12962962962963
1376245,5,B00004YKQR,"When Ben's mom dies he never really gets over it,His dad works and Ben's the cook. You could even call him he maid. He finds out about this house that can do everything you can think of. His dad starts dated ""for the family"" so ben enters like 50 times and they win. The crator""Sarah Barnes"" and the dad fall in love and you need to find out what ben does,and how he lets a woman come into their not so perfect lives!",977270400,,417,4.036144578313253

1376448,5,B00004YKQR,"Disney produced an excellent DVD product and the contents of this movie which is good entertainment for the young and old.  The Disney producers have a gift for using comedy as a means to illustrate matters in a household in distress with recovering where a Mother has died and the benefits but also limitations of modern computer technology.  This is hi-tech comedy at its best, but also with a very important lesson no computer or technology can take the place of the personal touch and decent humaneness.  Included in this comedy-tech mix are numerous episodes of the normal problems of youth growing up in home and school in tandem with the challenges of parenthood - and
a guardian's role.  Disney deserves more than 5 stars for this movie that provides positive, humorous, decent family entertainment.",1408320000,,807,4.955555555555556
1376449,5,B00004YKQR,"I use to love this movie when i was a kid and still do. DCOM movies were my favorite when i was growing up and they still hold value to me to this day. I really wish Disney had released more of their DCOM movies on DVD. They should get on board with Amazons createspace MOD program like Nickelodeon and release their prime DCOM movies from the late 90s and early 2000s. I would love to see Dont look under the bed, Phantom of the Megaplex, and My date with the Presidents daughter on DVD. Although Amazons MOD releases are usually pretty cheap, i would definitely pay in the $30 range for those films to add to my DCOM collection since i already have the Halloweentown double feature, life size, hocus pocus, and of course, Smart House. I would also love to own Under Wraps but since its rare and out of print, the usual price is $100.
Anyways, i highly reccomend Smart House to anybody looking for a nice family film from Disney with a futuristic twist. Really good movie with a huge heart and a nice message.

Was that movie you saw when you were little really as great and stupendous as you ""fondly remember"" it, or was it, well, Cats VS Dogs?

This is no exception. Smart house is thrilling. I just love the prospect of living in a house that can whip up a strawberry banana smoothie and can wake you up to the final buzzer of a championship game.

For those that don't know. Ben enters to win a smart house because his mom died a few years ago and he doesn't want his dad to get any ideas that they need a mom. Ben thinks that winning the smart house will make life easier and prove that the coopers are perfect just the way they are. Ben's dad, starts to like the inventor of the house, and Ben reprograms the house to be the perfect ""50s"" mom.

Then the house goes CRAZY and attacks.

This is a movie for one of those days where one does not wish to think at all, and everything on the boob tube is too depressing.  I will admit that buried in the core of this bit of fluff is a cautionary tale of Artificial Intelligence run amok, and if one dwells on that, the movie is as scary as the evening news.  Otherwise, it's just a run-of-the-mill Disney formula family-needs-mother pic.  The technology portrayed may, like that of Jules Verne, come to pass in the not too distant future.  Much of it is available today, if one can afford it.  I, for one, am not holding my breath.",1267920000,3,646,4.297520661157025

1376495,5,B00004YKQR,"SMART HOUSE is a great Disney Channel Original Movie. It is about a thirteen-year-old kid, Ben Cooper (Ryan Merriman) who lives with his single father and younger sister. Ben is sort of a computer brain--he's not a genius, but he goes nuts over computerized stuff. He tries to keep the family well-organized and on track so his father won't start dating other women and make them apart of their family, he thinks they don't need a new mother since their mother died. Anyway, Ben is always entering contests...hoping that someday, he'll win one of the contests and it will help make his family better. Ben enters a contest which the winner receives a brand-new house that is totally computerized--nobody has to do anything, there is a computer that does it all for them. Ben surprisingly wins this contest, and he and his family moves into it. Sarah Barnes (Jessica Steen) is the woman who created this house invention. And when Ben's father starts dating her, Ben gets upset because he thinks that his father will marry Sarah and Ben doesn't want a new mom. Then, when the computerized home, which has a voice called P.A.T. (Katey Sagal), gets out of control, P.A.T. turns into the form of a woman who claims to be the Ben and his sister's mother and tries to take over the house and the family! Ben, his father, his sister, and Sarah Barnes must stop P.A.T. from ruining the house and the Coopers.
This was a very fun movie, and LeVar Burton from ""Star Track"" fame directs it. Though kind of unrealistic, but who really cares? The acting is great, especially from Ryan Merriman and Katey Sagal. There are lots of great special effects in this movie, and the dialouge is really good.
