5322345,4,B009EL6JII,"The French language sure sounds good when hearing about love, whether it's the romantic kind, or the twisted and broken kind of familial love presented in the film Sister. This sad tale of the relationship between a brother and sister trying to survive within a few miles of a ritzy Swiss Ski resort could've devolved into a story of the one percent versus the 99 percent. Fortunately for us, writer Antoine Jaccoud and writer/director Ursula Meier chose to focus on a young boy and what he will do to get love from, and give love to, a sister who doesn't deserve or appreciate his devotion.

Ironically enough, 12-year-old Simon is the one keeping the fragile hold he and Louise have on their lives. He's the 'organizer,' as Louise calls him, who's resorted to stealing items from the ski resort that he in turn sells, then uses the money for rent and food. Simon takes advantage of his young age, blending into the crowd with that kid-like cloak of invisibility that renders him imperceptible to the adults, while other kids just assume he's one of them. This makes it easy for him to walk away with the valuable equipment carelessly left lying around.

Mottet-Klein is a powerhouse actor in a very small package; he has taken this film and carried it on his very capable shoulders. A majority of Sister is spent following Simon around, watching as he hustles his way with the confidence of someone much older. Seydoux is spectacular as the wayward Louise, who really has no direction in life at all, and instead of taking care of her younger brother, has developed an unnatural dependence on him while she makes one disastrous decision after another.

The script is well written, the performances are fantastic, and although it bogs down midway through, the writers throw in an unexpected twist that makes up for that short period where the mind wanders a bit. This revelation is done so smartly, without the overly dramatic flair that most films would've utilized, and it makes the behavior of brother and sister up to that point even more shocking. A nice little added bonus, for me anyway, is the appearance of one of my favorite actresses: Gillian Anderson (The X-Files). She plays a mother on vacation with her kids who befriends Simon, but soon finds out that her kindness was taken advantage of by a kid who is more comfortable lying and swindling than he is being honest with himself and others.

This is a bare bones DVD release presented in 1.33:1 standard definition, but still does a fine job of displaying the beautiful Swiss Alps. Sister is a French language film with easy to read subtitles accompanied by the beautiful spoken dialogue. There are no special features available in this release, which is a shame; I would've enjoyed hearing more background on this wonderful little film.

  'Sister' is the Swiss entry for both the Academy and Spirit Award nomination in the best foreign language film category. It's a very well-acted, bleak portrait of the relationship between a 12/13 year old boy, Simon, and his older caretaker, Louise, played by La Seydoux.

  HUGE SPOILERS AHEAD. For a good part of the film, we're led to believe that Louise, is Simon's older sister, after Simon claims that their parents were killed in a car accident. Eventually, however, it's revealed that Louise is actually the child's mother.

  Most of the plot takes place at a Swiss ski resort, where Simon mainly pilfers expensive skis and ski accessories from well-off, unsuspecting tourists and supports himself and his mother, by selling the items (principally to employees at the resort). Along the way, Simon befriends a British resort employee who helps him sell some of the stolen merchandise. On one occasion, a tourist catches Simon stealing from him and the child suffers a beating, resulting in a bloody nose and bruises on his body (do you really believe, no one at the resort would have called the police on their cell phone, when they saw an adult attack a young child?).

  Louise makes it clear to Simon that she never wanted him and refuses to hardly parent him at all. The unloved boy is so desperate for affection that he offers her money, if she'll just cuddle him in bed. Meanwhile, Louise refuses to support the two, and for most of the film, selfishly takes money from the boy to support herself. She also seeks out abusive boyfriends, ignores the effect those relationships have on Simon and often leaves the child to his own devices.

  It becomes rather clear that Simon's criminality is tied directly to Louise's neglect and extremely poor parenting. You'll have to suspend your disbelief quite a bit to believe that there are people as extreme as Louise. In real life, wouldn't a narcissist like Louise, simply make sure Simon goes to school, to keep him out of her hair? And if he ends up as a truant, the authorities would have no problem shipping him off to reform school. Yes I know she's supposed to be out of it, but it just seems a little too convenient, that no ever reports her and little Simon gets away with his pint size theft routine, for so long.

  And also what exactly is director Usrula Meier's overall point? That without love, kids can end up with some really bad problems? Even before Simon poaches the watch, causing Louise to lose her job, we pretty much realize that Simon's downward spiral will not reverse course (in other words, we GET the point that this indeed, is a TRAGIC situation, way before the denouement). Yes, it's clever and dramatic to show the two going in opposite directions on the cable lift at film's end, symbolizing that Simon will not get the help he needs from his mother, but how about letting reality intrude into the story for a minute? The appropriate ending would be for some social workers to intervene and place the child in foster care or some kind of institutional setting. But this film is more about hitting us over the head about the 'tragedy' of this grim relationship, instead of establishing a proper verisimilitude.

  'Sister's weak point is the rather one-note, simplistic portrait of the mother from hell. Are there people like that in real life? Maybe. But usually there's some kind of motive (is she a drug addict? Prostitute?)--it's all so sketchy. Why not find out a little bit more about her? Or is she so one-dimensional, that there's nothing more to learn?

  What keeps us interested is how far Simon will sink into the morass of criminality. In that respect, Meier is more successful in fascinating us as voyeurs in a crime drama, than the more unexplained and obvious dissection of a broken relationship between mother and child.",1358380800,6,3871,4.7604790419161676
8540617,5,B009EL6JII,I really liked this movie--very compelling.  Both the boy (Kacey Klein) and especially Lea Seydoux--very good acting.  One of her best!,1524787200,,135,5.380952380952381
8540618,5,B009EL6JII,Quite an interesting theme is well performed by younger actors. Gillian Anderson's supporting role is a significant one that provides the adult intervention needed by the youth characters. Consider owning this film because these characters' complexities become more apparent after mulitple viewings.,1514592000,,299,6.142857142857143
8540619,5,B009EL6JII,"Once again, this film is burden of proof of why European/foreign-made films are superior to any and all ""garbage"" that is produced and made by Hollywood and the so-called indie movie industry in the U.S. And the reason that I for a very long time now, have stopped watching or caring for anything that looks and smells of ""Hollywood"" and its  corporate greed (i.e., devoid of any humanity and artistic merit).

Swiss-based ""L'enfant d'en haut"" (from 2012 and directed by Ursula Meier), which was released here under the title ""Sister"", is a perfect example and the antithesis of the aforementioned! This film is a moving, powerful testament and exploration of the ""human spirit"". Now, one may ask, but don't the producers and financial backers of said film want or demand a ROI from said film? All very true points indeed. However, the filmmaker (Ursula Meier) unlike her American counterparts, obviously couldn't give a S..t about the commercial/business aspects of said enterprise.  Now, do you see the major cultural difference here. The filmmaker in this case, was not motivated by financial considerations, in other words---""in it for the money"" (like the Hollywood prostitutes). No, she was motivated and driven by artistic integrity and humanitarian concerns: embracing a vision and objective in being true and honest in showing the human condition. I don't want to give the story away, as some reviews here have sadly done so. I will however, give you a quick synopsis. This is the story of 12 year-old 'Simon' (Kacey Mottet Klein) who fends for himself and his older sister 'Louise' (L&eacute;a Seydoux) by stealing from the rich vacationers at a posh ski resort not far from the public-housing-block where they live (in the region of Valais).

""Rosetta"" (from 1999) by the Dardennes brothers of Belgium is a film that easily comes to mind. I have to say that the young actor that played 'Simon' is truly gifted. For those of us whom still consider themselves human beings first and foremost, be prepared to shed some tears by the stirring wave of ""ethos and pathos"" that you will experience in empathy for 'Simon' when watching this film. A very sad but true reflection of the ugly reality that still exists in this world, even in a super-rich country like Switzerland. I highly recommend this film.

This was a Franco-Swiss co-production. The DVD picture and sound quality is excellent. NTSC, French (English subtitles), NR 97 mins.

ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTRESS AND HIGHEST AWARD WINNING IS LEA SEYDOUX . AS USUAL SHE SHINES IN THE ROLE SHE PLAYS.",1477526400,,293,4.140350877192983

8540623,4,B009EL6JII,"`Sister' or `L'enfant d'en haut' to give it its proper title is one of those amazing films that quite often pass us by. It is essentially the story of Simon played by an amazing little actor Kacey Mottet Klein. He lives with the `sister' of the title or rather he exists with her. She is what we used to call a flibbertigibbet or moreover a woman who like men a lot - probably too much. This means she finds it hard to hold down a job and a man. When she gets in the mood she just disappears and leaves the young boy to his own devices.

Simon has thus devised his own ways of getting by and as this is based in a Swiss skiing resort he makes a living by stealing from the tourists and selling to the kids at school, or the local workers or anyone with a few Euros to spare. He is thus the provider. We also have a side story involving one of the local cooks, Mike played by Martin Compston (`Donkeys' and `Soulboy'). The two of them live in some crummy tower block which is surrounded by open space, so why build such a horrible thing?

This is from director Ursula Meier who is also a writer and actress, and she has made a simple yet extremely compelling film. The young lead is heartbreakingly good as is his selfish `sister' played with a right balance of guilt and extreme self interest by Lea Seydoux (`Inglorious Basterds' and Robin Hood'). This is in French with a fair smattering of English, good sub titles and last for 97 minutes. It does have one of those endings that make you want to know more; so some may find it less rewarding because of that. However, with all good to great films it is the journey as much as the destination that matters and if you use those criteria this is really well above being just `good'. I was absolutely taken with it and was giving it five stars but because of the issue I mentioned above I am going with the four, I can however still highly recommend this fine piece of film making.",1396656000,3,1930,4.241847826086956

8540625,4,B009EL6JII,"I've recently gotten into watching Lea Seydouxs movies after seeing her in ""Blue is the Warmest Color"" and going through Netflix first I found this one.  It really doesn't give you any resolution.  Thats my one pitfall of the movie.  It's basically about an older sister and a little brother who make their money off a ski resort.  The brother acts as the financial provider for his sister by stealing, ripping off the tourists and selling it back to other ones.  The sister largely spends her time running around with guys.  His crimes eventually catch up with him and when his sister finally gets with the program and gets a job as a maid, he comes in and steals from the people shes cleaning for, therefore screwing things up for her.  In the end their in separate lifts looking at each other and your left not knowing what will happen with either one of them.  Will they meet back up, will they lose each other again?  You're left in the dark.",1394064000,,947,4.491228070175438
