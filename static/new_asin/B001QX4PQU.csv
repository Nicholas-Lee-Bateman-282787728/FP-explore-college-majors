3771506,4,B001QX4PQU,"This workout is a collaboration between Miranda Esmonde-White, founder of the Classical Stretch technique, and her daughter, Sahra Esmonde-White. Miranda does not appear in the workout itself; rather, Sahra is shown as the lead demonstrator while Miranda instructs via voiceover. During the brief introduction, Sahra explains that the workout, which is designed for athletes to increase flexibility, is more lower body focused; this was my first disappointment, as the Essentrics web site, suggests a more lengthy upper body segment than is actually included on this DVD. Miranda notes that the exercises in the DVD are meant to be ""progressive""--ie, you should not perform the segments out of order or independently of each other. Finally, Miranda recommends using the DVD 2-3 times per week for best results.

In addition to the Intro and Participants descriptions, the Main Menu offers options to select individual chapters (Standing/Floorwork/Barrework/Splits) or Play All. When you make your selection, you also have the choice of instruction with both Music & Voice, Music Only, or Voice only. Sahra works out with a group of 2-5 other athletes (the number varies for each segment) in a large, very bright studio with full windows in the background (in fact, the light coming in from the windows is a bit TOO bright, making the participants appear dark).

The first segment, Standing, is 20 minutes long, the first half of which is upper body work. This section begins with a very brief (<2 minutes) warm-up that consists primarily of gently rolling the shoulders to get the blood flowing. The upper body work continues to focus mainly on the shoulders, upper back, and chest through flowing but more intense movements, including rounding your body forward and then actively pulling to each side in turn. Side-to-side lunges are also incorporated into the upper body work. Next comes approximately 5 minutes of ""Tai Chi plies,"" a very typical part of most Classical Stretch workouts; Miranda cues the group to tense and release the quad and hamstring muscles and has them perform some of the work on their toes. The standing segment concludes with 5 minutes of ""airplane"" work for the hamstrings, a nice section of forward bends and twists. Miranda then instructs you to get a mat for the 20 minute floorwork segment. This begins seated for a butterfly stretch, then moves to lying for baby (aka thread the needle) and an IT band stretch. Coming back to seated, Miranda leads the class through a series of seated forward bends to stretch the hamstrings. Next is a sequence of quad stretches (aka pigeon pose), and then the floorwork concludes with lying leg lifts, 32 total on each side.

The final portion of the main workout is the Barrework, which is 9 minutes long; Sahra and the two male athletes joining her use a chair for this section. The first part of the barre work involves stretches for the feet and calves, with the participants using the barre for balance only. In the second half, Miranda leads them through a series of hip stretches with one foot placed on the seat of the chair. This brings the total time of the workout in at 59 minutes, but there is also a bonus portion, the Splits. Miranda cautions that the bonus segment should NOT be attempted unless you have warmed up with the main workout first. The Splits segment starts out with an intense hip opener, frog pose (called ""froggy"" by Miranda), held for 2 minutes. Next, the group performs a wide-legged split at the wall, also held for 2 minutes. After this, Miranda cues some additional standing psoas and hamstring stretches and then has the participants attempt the splits, first on one side, then the other. This bonus segment is just 8.5 minutes long.

Overall, although I did like this workout, I had a few disappointments with it. As mentioned above, there was not quite as much upper body work as I was led to believe there would be; in particular, I missed Miranda's unique arms work. I also missed Miranda!  Although she provided voiceover instruction, there was no way for her unique, quirky personality to shine through. In the end, although this DVD is definitely very well-done, I'm not sure that this workout offers anything new and improved over Miranda's Full Body Volume 1 or Volume 2.  However, this might be a good choice for those who like the idea of the Classical Stretch workouts but who find Miranda's live personality to be a bit too over-the-top.

ETA:  I have since tried the other Essentrics workout,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Essentrics-Workout-Arms-Abs-Waist-Toner-Legs-Butt-Thigh-Thinner/dp/B001QX6KTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Essentrics Workout: Arms, Abs & Waist Toner / Legs, Butt & Thigh Thinner</a>.  Although Miranda Esmonde-White directs this production, it is cued live by her daughter, Sahra Esmonde-White, who is featured as the lead instructor.  To me, the live instruction makes a huge different.  If Sahra had cued this DVD herself, I think I would have enjoyed it much more.",1249516800,22,5054,5.128797083839611
8336805,5,B001QX4PQU,"Bought this dvd & a few others for my daughter & son-in-law who are both a year past major surgeries. Formerly, they were both avid bicycle riders year round. They thank me over & over for both Miranda & Sahra's workouts which have helped them rebuild stamina with the added bonus of flexibility & range of motion.  My son-in-law got a good laugh when a co-worker was having difficulty trying to to pick up his eye glasses he knocked on the floor & my son-in-law did a Sahra lunge to get them. His co-worker said ""Man...you're flexible""!!",1439337600,,538,4.546391752577319
8336806,5,B001QX4PQU,Best stretches for those of us who are not quite athletes' but do exercise on a regular basis.  I jog  or bike 6days a week and do strength training.  As I have gotten past 50 I noticed that the muscles become tighter and hence more soreness and injury.  This is one of the best DVD for stretching especially the leg and hip areas that I have come across.,1431302400,,355,4.176470588235294

8336810,5,B001QX4PQU,"For my regular exercise routine, I prefer some of the other Essentrics/Classical stretch DVDs, but as a deep full body stretch, this one is great.  I have often used it when recovering from minor pulls or strains.  My husband, who often has groin & leg injuries from playing hockey or soccer also loves this DVD.  He gets significantly less injuries when he's doing the DVD on a regular basis.  I think he feels more comfortable doing this one, because there are male athletes in the video. I like the fact that this DVD gets to often forgotten, but very important areas such as the toes & feet.  I always feel great when I finish this DVD, especially my back & shoulders.  I absolutely love all the Essentrics & Classical Stretch DVDs that I've tried, this exercise program has toned my entire body dramatically & increased my flexibility & mobility.",1418947200,6,851,4.677852348993288

8336813,5,B001QX4PQU,"As a healthcare professional ( physical therapy), I would recommend some of these exercises to higher level patients. A lot of athletes are injured during the eccentric part of a muscle contraction or have poor stretching habits. The DVD has great utilization of some of the techniques that we use including muscle energy techniques/PNF/isometrics. The use of rotation etc is a great way to release muscle tension and sometimes scar tissue. I will definitely be purchasing the other DVDs. I am a runner in addition to other sports that I enjoy and I use this DVD for ITBand/ TFL, hamstring....etc stretching.  It",1385251200,11,612,5.0

My Chiropractor had given me several stretching exercises to do so I purchased this as well.  It is an excellent workout and does stretch out all the major muscle groups.
