4654872,5,B005CW5E2A,"If Mother Teresa had dropped acid and joined a circus she could have been a bit like Wavy Gravy. Wavy, who lives with his Hog Farm commune in a rambling Berkeley, Calif., house, is a Bay Area fixture and a holy man with a world-wide vocation to help heal and tickle the sick, bring sight to the blind and keep all of us chortling. ""Saint Misbehavin'"" is more than a biography of this counter-culture hero; it's a documentary that sends chills -- happy chills -- up and down the spines of friends and others familiar with Wavy; and it introduces the rest of humanity, at least the conscious portion of the population, to a clown with a mission to bring us all to some higher plane where laughter is more important than ... than you name it: disease, poverty, hunger, greed and general all-around uptightness!

I met Wavy in the mid-Sixties, when he was using the name his parents had given him, Hugh Romney. He was a performer, a one-time Beat poet who'd turned his on-stage rant into a hilarious comedy act. As the 1960s progressed and what came to be known as the counter-culture -- energized by opposition to war in Vietnam, by conditions hardly a step above slavery in the American South and, in many cases, including mine and maybe yours and in particular in the case of Hugh Romney, psychedelic drugs -- raised its smiling face along with its consciousness. Hugh Romney became Wavy Gravy and began a long and often strange trip that brought him around the world, across the Himalayas in one of those old buses preferred by traveling saints, clowns, fools and minstrels in those days, and eventually to Hog Farm headquarter in Berkeley. Along the way he brought doctors, medicines, fun and music to remote villages and to huge hippie festivals and maybe even to you, if you were alive in the tumultuous (as they always say) years that followed he may well have touched you.

Whether you were there or not, ""Saint Misbehavin'"" is an inspiring, thrilling story of a true hero, a man who deserves, at least, a counter-culture version of the Nobel Peace Prize. It's a professionally made film that does not look like it was shot by a bunch of acid-heads who were having trouble with the focus knob. I thank the filmmakers for helping introduce Wavy Gravy and his magic to a larger audience. We need clowns!",1322006400,3,2306,4.635696821515892
4654873,5,B005CW5E2A,"Watch this movie and be inspired and entertained by the spirit of life, according to Wavy Gravy. Wavy is the not so innocent bystander ringleader of a marvelously loving group of groovy people who only wish the best for their co-habitants everywhere. This is what love for humanity is all about, as Wavy and his friends actually take action and live life for peace and the betterment of their fellow personages. No brag, just fact.

Saint Misbehvain' should be required watching for every young adult to inspire them to repect, love, and support their fellow earthlings with peaceful exuberance and passion for a totally better world. This movie is about more than just some Merry Pranksters and the hippies who policed the hoards at Woodstock. It is about a clown and his parade of do-gooders, who cruise the U.S. on buses spreading a gospel of peace and love, and then ultimately cruise more thousands of miles on buses from England to Bangladesh in pursuit of bring peace and health.  Along the way in places like Iraq, Iran, and Afganistan, where Americans were once welcomed, admired, and loved, their tie dye parade is embraced by the most unlikely and seemingly least compatible of audiences. World peace is possible.  Just watch!

By the way Wavy's co-conspirator, Larry Brilliant, ends up sticking around after the trip to help put an end to infectious diseases in India, while Larry and Wavy ultimately form the SEVA Foundation[...], which is an organization that has brought eyesight to the blind by way of free clinics throughout India and the world for over three decades.  And kids, check out Camp Winnarainbow [...], and be sure to send your parents, too.

Congratulations to Michelle Esrick for directing the process and getting to the masses!

Not bad for a bunch of hippies, eh?",1320278400,5,1796,4.907590759075908
4654874,5,B005CW5E2A,"A piquant movie, while sweet, too, in a delectable way. Lovingly assembled by director Michelle Esrick and profiling Wavy Gravy as an icon of hippiedom, sure, but also as a figure who's more, much more than that.

The film revels in the breadth of Hugh Romney's world-improving activities (yes, that's Wavy's boring given-name!) And yes, his altruism is as both broad and simple as that. He's been about Improving The World ever since he first rocketed to fame as the voice of the Woodstock music festival in 1969.

Whether he's in whiteface or not, whether he's raising funds for eye-surgery in India, or teaching young wannabe circus artists at a performing arts camp, he consistently emerges as a quintessential ""holy fool"". But gratifyingly, the only time Wavy is actually called a saint (apart from in the punning title) it's in awed tones from the alternative guru Ram Dass, a.k.a. Dr Richard Alpert.

Esrick has pulled off an extraordinary feat - not least in finding astonishing archive footage and magically weaving out of it an evocative tale of our times. It traces this one-time Greenwich Village poet (contemporary of Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and the others) ... on through his trekking with others across Europe, finding themselves doing charity work in Nepal ... and finally to his present-day life of undemonstrative but dedicated service to humanity.

The whole of Saint Misbehavin' is suffused with wryness - in just the same way that Wavy takes his purpose seriously, but not himself.",1315267200,12,1499,5.008032128514056
4654875,5,B005CW5E2A,"Lovingly done, and gives a real flavor for the checkered history of the still vibrant humanitarian and, uh, clown.  The title fits not because he's a saint in the old fashioned sense, but he is a master of word games and bad puns.  I even saw him make it rain once around a droughty solstice fire in Berkeley, when he cranked up his ektar and sang ""I'm dreaming of a wet Christmas"".  A true Master of Ceremonies in a Shamanic/ hippy sense.  Lots of lessons to take into the next millenium.  Watch and learn.",1314489600,14,507,4.351063829787234
4654876,5,B005CW5E2A,"Wavy Gravy in a truly enigmatic figure.  Beat poet, friend of Dylan and The Dead, stage presence at Woodstock, but also father, leader, spiritual guide and embodiment of true goodness and love.
  Michelle Esrick spent many years gathering material and interviews for this film, and what she produced is a rich tapestry that will leave you with a smile and a wish to ""put your good where it does the most"".
  If you are a ""child of the 60's"" you will love the music and the nostalgic vision of where the seeds were planted for much of what's good about the world today.  If you came along later you will really enjoy this rollicking tale of hippiness.
  In short, you are going to love this film!!",1312761600,16,696,4.468253968253968

4654880,5,B005CW5E2A,"If you attended Woodstock (or, more likely, saw Michael Wadleigh's Academy Award-winning 1970 documentary, instead), you require no introduction to perhaps the most colorful and memorable personality from that event, the Hog Farm's Hugh Romney, aka ""Wavy Gravy"". What you probably don't know, however, is the back story of where he came from before and where he went after Woodstock. This inspiring documentary relates all of this and seems to confirm that at least some who composed the 1960s counterculture were motivated by transcendent values that they have continued to live by since. If anyone from that era deserves the title, ""saint"", Wavy/Hugh is surely one. A must-have modern companion to the famous documentary period piece.",1419811200,,736,5.353448275862069

4654897,5,B005CW5E2A,"I was blown away by the archival footage, the interviews, the serious purpose and mission behind Wavy Gravy's wacky persona.  For me it was easy to dismiss this court jester until you learn that he was integral and involved in almost every meaningful cultural development in the late 20th Century, from Lenny Bruce to Dylan to Woodstock to anti-Vietnam and on and on.

 When he put on the clown outfit he was liberated to share his vision of love and peace in a culturally accepted way.  He is smart, loving spiritual and the filmmakers have done a remarkable job of  documenting Wavy's lifelong mission to improve the world and ensure everyone has their basic human needs.",1338595200,2,673,4.767241379310345

4654904,5,B005CW5E2A,"I have had the pleasure and honor of getting to know Wavy Gravy over the last 28 years and what I thought I knew about this man is nothing compared to what is on this DVD.  Here is a person who absolutely walks the walk even more than he talks the talk...He has a voice that calms hundreds of thousands at one time (Woodstock: ""What we have in mind is breakfast in bed for 400,000!"")

He is the ""leader"" of a 40 year old ""Hippie"" commune now based on a 700 acre ranch just north of Laytonville, California...with many of it's original members still living there at 60+ years of age...but he is NOT a cult leader!  He encourages anyone who will listen to not listen to him, but to listen to their own hearts and be the best human that they can be! I have done more volunteer work for many charities just trying to emulate 1% of what Wavy does/is.

Knowing and listening to Wavy has made me a better human...he is a true teacher who does NOT want followers, he wants you to listen and become your own leader! He is the head ""Pastor"" for ""The Church of Fun"" (What a novel concept! A church pastor who doesn't want you to believe in ""him!"" and doesn't want YOUR money!)

He and his soulmate Jahanarah, started Camp Winnarainbow at Black Oak Ranch, a performing arts camp where kids of all ages can learn to juggle, tight rope walk, be a clown, sing and dance and almost anything else you can think of at a circus...There is even an Adult Camp for one week each year for ""kids"" aged 18-100+ (the year I went in 2006 the ages ranged from 18 to 84! I was 54.) It was really BIG FUN!!!

Would I blindly do anything that he asked me to do? No, and to be honest he wouldn't ask me too or want me too.

What you get from watching this movie is a brief look inside the world of a true clown with a heart of gold whose only motto is ""Toward The Fun!""
