5425885,4,B00AIA86OY,"This is a typical B movie mystery. The big clue is blatantly obvious, but only after the mystery is solved. This is simple fun....enjoy",1362787200,5,135,4.666666666666667
8551902,2,B00AIA86OY,"The concept is good-a tenor singing in an opera production at the Hollywood Bowl is told by a fortune teller not to sing his aria the next day or he will die. Of course that is exactly what happens, and there is a long list of suspects: two mistresses, a Russian tenor who wanted the role, a maniacal composer whose composition the tenor wouldn't sing, the aggravated production director, and others. The police are called in to figure out how the tenor died and if it were foul play.

A young policeman, his chemist girlfriend, and the clownish police chief all try to solve the mystery, if they can stop fighting one another. The movie has its laughs, but with an unfortunate-and least credible-resolution. But it was only meant to be a B movie, as other reviewers pointed out, so we shouldn't expect much.",1485648000,,808,4.611111111111111

8551906,4,B00AIA86OY,"She a hurtles by very-a fast, yet stops to include the entirety of the Il Trovatore (?) duet also heard in NIGHT OF THE OPERA, and lots of grandiose overacting by Carillo, with McHugh stealing the scenes as his long-suffering assistant / PR man. That swami in the turban on the cover gets one little scene by contrast, and there's no seance, just a dire warning - a couple of interlocking murder attempts / red herring and Chester Morris as either the smartest or dumbest of all detectives. I liked his cute romance with the very blonde Madge Evans, one of those ingenues who came and went with such regularity, she's one I could see more of willingly, but where is she? Oh well, whoops! It's over. But if you love the period and love mysteries then you should get this, why not - I bought it for around $5 on streaming and it looks terrific.",1434412800,3,842,4.403846153846154
8551907,3,B00AIA86OY,"As happens often to promising A-list actors, Chester Morris was quickly relegated to starring in budget pictures for double bills. ""Moonlight Murder"" is typical of those 1930s mystery genre efforts. It is less a showcase for Morris' infectious good humor and screen energy and more a romp for Leo Carrillo, who finished his career as Pancho to Duncan Reynaldo's Cisco Kid. Portraying a temperamental opera star with two women crazy for him, Carrillo eats up the limited 66-minute screen time in a less serious and more comic opera tone. He and personal assistant Frank McHugh seem to be competing for the comic sidekick role. The setting is the Hollywood Bowl where the opera is performed and the murder committed. Since this is a 1936 MGM picture everything is soft-peddled. A mad composer threatens Carrillo if he doesn't sing his arias. An understudy mad to be a star looks guilty. A frustrated orchestra conductor has a murderous gleam in his eye. An hot-tempered diva mad about Carrillo looks guilty. How about the mild-mannered doctor who treats Carrillo? Who done it? All is revealed at the finish.",1412985600,,1105,4.978378378378379
8551908,4,B00AIA86OY,"Impudent plainclothes copper Steve Farrell has a cherished motto - ""Don't leave a stone unturned"" - that he dusts off occasionally. Except, at this moment, he's paying no heed to the motto, what with his being too distracted with chasing skirt to focus solely on the current murder case. Moonlight Murder is an economical 1936 MGM thriller that takes the then novel approach of staging a baffling whodunit during a Hollywood Bowl production of Giuseppe Verdi's ""Il Trovatore."" It's a curious juxtaposing of the high brow and the unsavory.

Maybe celebrated tenor Gino D'Acosta (Leo Carrillo) shouldn't have dismisssed that sinister swami's ominous augury: a divination that cautions D'Acosta that to perform at the next night's opera is to invite his death. But there's D'Acosta, feeling immortal, pooh-poohing the swami and carrying on carousing and womanizing. Even the ""maledictione"" - a curse embodied in a wax doll (of himself) impaled with a sword - only gives him slight pause. The show must go on, never mind that in his wake the great tenor leaves behind a trail of ruined hearts and festering jealousies. Omigosh, that swami was prescient!

It's a wealth of red herrings and a healthy gallery of suspects that challenge Detective Farrell (Chester Morris). Is it the swami whodunit? Or the cuckolded men? Or maybe it's the disgruntled composer and asylum-bound madman Bejac (J. Carrol Naish), him what recently took a knife to D'Acosta. Besides the police chief he's forever yanking out of heavy slumber, Farrell's allies comprise D'Acosta's best friend, kindly Dr. Adams (Grant Mitchell), and his alluring niece/assistant fresh off Johns Hopkins, Toni Adams (Madge Evans). And if Farrell doesn't get his act together and lay off the flirting with Toni, there just may be a demotion to lowly beat cop in store.

3.5 out of 5 stars. Running at just a slice over an hour, the film doesn't mess around. It briskly goes from scene to scene, advancing its plot. Maybe the two most noteworthy things about this movie are that it's ahead of its time with regards to depicting the application of forensic analysis to help solve a homicide and, oh by the way, that the practitioner is a woman. Also startling is the murderer's motivation which comes out of left field. Moonlight Murder is worth a watch if you've got an hour to kill. Veteran mug Frank McHugh provides chuckles as the opera star's majordomo who sings like he's getting punched in the face yet harbors operatic aspirations of his own.",1407024000,,2499,4.973684210526316
8551909,5,B00AIA86OY,"I liked this movie for several reasons. First, I bought it because Leo Carillo and Duncan Renaldo were both in it. They were the pair from the CISCO KID TV series which I watched when I was a kid. I was surprised with the turn around here. Leo Carillo was excellent as the arrogant womanizing tenor and Duncan Renaldo, as the handsome jealous dancer, did his best with a smaller part. As far as the rest of the cast, Chester Morris plays a good detective (he also played Boston Blackie) and had believable chemistry with the heroine and the actor who plays the chief of police. J. Carrol Naish was unrecognizable as usual in a part where you are asking yourself 'who played the mad man?' See him in 'Charlie Chan in the Circus' to see a real character actor who can disappear into a role. Second, the scenes of the Hollywood Bowl and the production scenes of Il Trovatore take us back to the 30's and California history. Third, the murder mystery was good - lots of people wanted to murder the victim, so it's a good guessing game. I also became interested in seeing the whole opera, although I am not a fan of opera in general, and ordered a blu-ray of Il Trovatore because of the scenes I saw here. This movie will be a nice companion piece to that in my collection. Fourth, on the production side, I was surprised that the movie played better on my 46"" than it did on my 9"". Usually an old movie plays better on a smaller screen. But the grandeur of the opera scenes was way better on the larger screen. Considering this is a DVD-R, I didn't expect that. So all-in-all a pleasant way to spend some time. I would recommend it to fans of opera, history and 30's murder mysteries.",1381276800,9,1680,4.3706070287539935
8551910,4,B00AIA86OY,"My dad used to tell me about this movie which he saw as a child. I snatched it up out of curiosity and found it a fun little who-dunnit. There is quite a bit of opera singing throughout, which I enjoy but be forewarned if you are not an opera buff. The modus operandi has to be unique among murder mysteries.",1370563200,3,308,4.065573770491803
8551911,4,B00AIA86OY,it was a pretty good movie but i'm not really into musicual movies.  but other than that it was pretty good,1363910400,,107,4.095238095238095
