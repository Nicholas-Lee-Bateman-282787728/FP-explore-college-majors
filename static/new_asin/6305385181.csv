7888252,2,6305385181,"Based on the underground Victorian novel, ""A Man with a Maid,"" this film wastes a good deal of time with nonsense like Jack the Ripper hiding out in a hidden room and watching as Jack seduces Alice, the lady who jilted him. Sadly, the results, and the silly 3D gimmicks do little to recreate the erotic scenes from the original novel. Perhaps someday someone will do a proper X-rated adaptation of ""A Man with a Maid,"" but the Groove Room isn't it.",1234656000,2,448,4.475609756097561
7888253,3,6305385181,"WHAT THE SWEDISH BUTLER SAW (aka THE GROOVE ROOM and TICKLED PINK) was made in the 1970s and was shot and released in polarized (clear glasses) 3-D. The VHS is flat; however a 3-D DVD under THE GROOVE ROOM title is available. Unfortunately, it has been converted to the inferior (red/cyan glasses) anaglyph format, which looks nothing like the original 3-D did. Some scenes have some interesting depth but the anaglyph conversion isn't the best. Don't judge 3-D by what you see here, the film didn't look like this in theatres with the polarized glasses.

A flat 2-D version is also included, and most viewers will probably stick with it. An audio commentary by the director and producer is also included and worth a listen.",1086307200,14,724,4.792

I'd call it an utter turkey, but that would be an insult to respectable turkeys everywhere. They did not use real actors for this, instead substituting cardboard figures controlled by string (Just like the Phantom Menace!) Ah, hell, why am I reviewing this? It's softcore porn and pretty terrible at it. The tickling scene isn't bad, though. Buy it for a practical joke like I did. :)",1020902400,10,486,4.662790697674419
