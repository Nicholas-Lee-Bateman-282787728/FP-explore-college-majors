1379901,5,B00004Z4VK,Well it's Matchstick Productions what else could you expect but the best from them and it defenitly is the best ski movie to date.  It combinds the sickest new school tricks with the freshest powder shots in just about anywhere you could think of.  This is a must have for all skiers.,980121600,,284,4.4423076923076925
1379902,4,B00004Z4VK,"The opening sequence is probably the coolest part.  Make all the cut scenes like that too. (Yeah, I know it costs a lot, that's what makes it good)
I've watched this through twice now since I got it and am left wondering how it compares to Global Storming, last years big MSP release.
Overall, the footage is cool, if not a bit boring (repetitive) by the time you get done watching.  I recommend watching it in spurts whenever you get a free ten minutes or so if you really want to get juiced.
Ultimately, this movie was made to show off some of the big names, not provide a lot of Matrix moments, something MSP should work on in the future. Ex. The slo-mo chopper shot near the beginning, very cool. Do whatever it takes to make the viewer feel like they're right there.
The tunes were good, but again, after reading what went on Global Storming, I feel like they should go with what sounds good, not just what's new this year.
Enough trash, ski movie still gets the point across.  It's a pretty solid four stars.",975628800,,1014,4.382978723404255
1379903,4,B00004Z4VK,"Ski Movie is not released yet. But last years DVD from the same company ""Global Storming"" is first rate Snow Porn! If the new flick is at least as good as GS, it's a solid ""BUY"" recamendation from this snow junkie. I give Global Storming 4 stars.",969753600,5,246,4.25531914893617
7928067,5,B00004Z4VK,"Had this previously, a roommate stole it, had to have again, the best ski and soundtrack ever",1416787200,,93,4.529411764705882
7928068,5,B00004Z4VK,probably the best extreme skiing movie ever.,1405728000,,44,5.428571428571429
7928069,3,B00004Z4VK,"Should have done a little more research into it before buying as a present... For me, a key part of good ski movies is great music. This movie had a LOT of heavy metal. It went well with the movie but as a 90s child, it's not my ears' favorite sound",1389830400,,249,3.9019607843137254
7928070,4,B00004Z4VK,"The movie is fantastic, I was happy with the quality of the used DVD.

Fast shipping and really well packed.  THANKS!",1233619200,,117,4.523809523809524
7928071,5,B00004Z4VK,"I give this one 5 stars but if you only buy 1 ski movie, make it Ski Movie 2: High Society not this one. I have about 40 extreme sport dvd's (mt biking, skiing, crusty series, etc...). For winter action, this is the best.

PS: If you kind find it, MIND The addiction (16mm) is also great.",1177718400,,288,4.052631578947368
7928072,3,B00004Z4VK,A fair ski movie.  Probably was the best until ski movie 2 came out.  Nothing so far has equaled the energy and sound tracks of the ski movie 2.,1125100800,,144,3.9310344827586206
7928073,5,B00004Z4VK,"This has been my favorite ski movie for the last couple years, and is only beaten by the newer TGR movies.  This movie is a much more extreme version of Warren Miller's movie (although ""Fifty"" was great) but without the constant commentary and humor.  You can tell the movie is made by some great skiiers.
All the skiiers are great skiiers, from Les Trois Philipes to pretty boy Moseley and Seth Morrison - no Tommy Moe or Picabo here.
The soundtrack alone is worth buying, with bands such as Methods of Meyham (Tommy Lee), Crazytown, Long Beach Dub Allstars, Popa Roach, Sum 41, and more.
Definitely THE first ski movie to own. btw- JP Auclair is sick.",1003708800,2,653,4.572649572649572
7928074,5,B00004Z4VK,"""Ski Movie"" is quite possibly the best ski movie I have ever seen, this blows some of Warren Miller's work out of the water. This DVD is packed full of insane snow action. Scott Gaffney (director) also threw in some comedy to the movie making it a great mix. This DVD/VHS is a MUST HAVE for the true skier.",991872000,,306,4.203389830508475
7928075,5,B00004Z4VK,This is the best Movie i have ever Seen,988675200,,39,3.4444444444444446
7928076,4,B00004Z4VK,"MSP definately saves skiing again.  Even my boarder friends were gettin amped with the sick tricks.  Being an avid skier who refuses to even try boarding, I thought the movie was worth owning.  I have watched it a number of times and still enjoy it.  It is a great movie to watch when my ""flatlander"" friends come and stay at my place to ski Mammoth Mountain.  It gets everyone pumped.  Shane McConkey rules.",984355200,,408,4.52054794520548
