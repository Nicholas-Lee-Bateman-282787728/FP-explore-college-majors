8017032,1,B0001WTVVG,This movie was the greatest waste of money - David Caruso is not even in it!  What a scam!!!  Why is it advertised as being one of his movies?,1393545600,,142,3.8620689655172415
8017033,1,B0001WTVVG,"Don't waste your money.  If you are a David Caruso fan, know this:  he's in it for about 15 seconds, and that's it.  This thing is horrible.",1283644800,2,140,4.111111111111111
8017034,1,B0001WTVVG,"This was stupid.  Even though I knew some of the people in it, it was still a waste of time.",1197244800,,92,3.6
8017035,1,B0001WTVVG,"I was very disappointed with this movie.  The summary of the movie on the cover indicates David Caruso as the main star, his picture is on the front.  Except he is only in the movie for about a minute.  The movie is supposed to be a comedy.  There may be one scene that is humorous, but for the most part it's a drama and a very poor one.  I wouldn't recommend anyone waste their time with this movie.",1174867200,2,401,4.089743589743589
8017036,1,B0001WTVVG,"I remember seeing this movie way back when -- ok, I'm dating myself -- but still, it was a fun movie when you see the whole thing.  THIS dvd version is the worst I've ever seen -- of ANY movie!  It's grainy and soft, made off of what looks like a scratched up, cut up, 16mm local television station print -- that they dragged around the parking lot first.

Let's start with the DVD box:  It inadvertantly (?) excludes the star, Brian Kerwin who gives a magnificent performance as a confused teen of the 60's who finally sees the light and instead gives a full size picture and starring credit to David Caruso who is only in the thing for like 47 seconds!  They even made up a name to credit the director who was in fact Paul Frizzler.

The transfer is full screen which means that it cuts off the sides and during the main titles, names are falling off the edges and are illegible.  And there is a lot of action that occured on the sides that help tell the story and the jokes that are missing.  It's like pan and scan withouth panning or scanning!

At the end of the reels it goes to black for a few seconds every 10-15 minutes, there are jump cuts when bad word are uttered or they are ""scrambled"" aurally.  And entire sections are hacked out that were some of the funniest moments, that now make the story incongruous and hard to follow.  Too bad as the film actually had an interesting point of view and some good acting by the stars Brian Kerwin, Cooper Huckabee as the ""experienced"" best pal, Stephen Furst as the bumbling buddy and a few others.  Alos, a lot of original music of the period that today would be hard to come by in a movie of this budget.

I really wish someone would put out a good version of this film as it was, like I said earlier, really a funny, well made film originally.  I'm really surprised that Amazon would sell such a piece of crap as this, a real abomination compared to what it could have been.",1154044800,6,1931,4.269230769230769
8017037,1,B0001WTVVG,"1 star is 1 star more than this movie deserves.  I ordered this movie from another site I won't name.  I'm a BIG fan of David Caruso and I have at least a dozen movies with him in them.  I'll list all the movies I have with David Caruso in them at the end of this review.  Anyway, I wanted to add this one to that list of movies.  Well now I wish I hadn't added it to the list.  This movie is BORING, David is only in 2 VERY SHORT scenes, the picture is grainy and snowy, the color is very poor.  Plus at the beginning when they're showing who's in the movie, it looks like someone set up a camcorder and recorded the movie off a tv playing a VERY OLD VHS tape of the movie in their VCR and they set up the camcorder too far to the right.  Some of the names of people in this movie you can't even see the first 2 or 3 letters of their first and last names.  Save your time and your money...DON'T ORDER THIS MOVIE!!!
As promised here's all the movies with David Caruso in them I have: Black Point, Hudson Hawk, Jade, Deadlocked, Twins, Session 9, Elmore Leonard's Gold Coast, Proof of Life, King of New York, Mad Dog and Glory, First Blood, Getting Wasted, Thief of Hearts, Officer and a Gentleman, Cold Around the Heart.",1149638400,8,1220,4.092436974789916
