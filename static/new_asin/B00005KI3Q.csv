1619913,5,B00005KI3Q,My daughter likes this video very much. She watches from start to end with full concentration. The songs are continuous and most lively.,1006992000,,136,4.956521739130435
1619914,5,B00005KI3Q,One on those videos that the kids watch over and over. My little girl loves it.,1006646400,,79,4.0
1619915,5,B00005KI3Q,"When my new baby boy was about 6 months, I broke out some of the videos that I saved from my daughter, who is now 10. My son was taken with this video in particular. He is now 1 year old and knows by the FBI warning what video is about to start. He not only gets excited (time after time after time...) but throws kisses when the mother kisses her son goodbye in the very beginning of the video. I highly recommend this video. I am going to order more. I have contacted this company and they do not sell through the stores any longer so this is the place to find these Kidsongs videos.",1000339200,3,585,4.051724137931035

1619948,5,B00005KI3Q,This DVD has been played so much that I'm surprised it still works. My children watch it over and over and over and over.......but I have to say I love it too because it first came out in 1985 when I was a child. Anytime there's that nostalgia associated with a product it just makes it that much better. Oh and the disc repeats on its own so no restarting it when it's over!,1471305600,,375,4.081081081081081
1619949,4,B00005KI3Q,I bought this item for my 2 yr old grandson. His mother used to watch this on VHS tapes when she was a baby. He loved the music. Only problem is adults can tell this was transfered from tape to DVD. Every now and again it skips a little but still good for the little ones,1470700800,,271,3.857142857142857

1619955,1,B00005KI3Q,"Worst sing along video yet.  If you want your kid to watch songs being sung at light speed and constantly changing camera views, this one if for you.  This was terrible, the camera did not stay on one view for more than 10 seconds at a time.  You could barely tell what animals the kids were holding or watch the kids dancing, because the camera was jumping around non-stop.  All the songs were sung in double time - probably to fit them in the alloted time, but my kids couldn't learn them or sing along because they were so fast.  My kids are 3 and 1/2 years old and love to sing and dance.  There was no rhyme or reason to songs - they just went from one to the other - absolutely no plot in between.  The songs were all songs I knew, but were sung so fast, even I couldn't follow along.  And the camera changing constantly would give anyone a migraine.  Terrible editing.  Just a bad video.  Too bad, as I liked the songs.",1454457600,,926,4.175141242937853

1620022,5,B00005KI3Q,"One of my students' favorites for Rainy Day Recess as well as when we are doing our Farm Unit.  They like the fact that the songs are short, catchy (read old standards WE learned when we were kids) and there are kids singing them.  One of the original 13 - sorry the newer ones just aren't quite as good.  Great for any Early Childhood Teacher, parent, grandparent.  You will have great fun watching together - and if you're really energetic, you can act them out (after watching them with your child a few times).  Enjoy!",1407369600,,522,4.4526315789473685

My students cheer when I put on this DVD.  Several very fun kids' songs on it for the young and young-at-heart.  Plus, being inner-city kids, I believe they enjoy taking this imaginary ""field trip"" to Old MacDonald's Farm!",1389916800,,372,4.3478260869565215

Now she's 27 & has a 15 month old daughter.  I ordered this in the new DVD format. When we turned it on, the baby immediately stopped what she was doing & started dancing & ""singing"" to the songs! It's still a great video, It's not outdated & still so enjoyable!",1362960000,,415,4.1875

1620064,5,B00005KI3Q,"This is one of my children's favorite kid DVD's.  They're mesmorized by it and often start singing the songs from it while we're driving in the car.  It is absolutely darling.  It's somewhat dated, but it doesn't detract from how adorable these kidsongs videos are.  Recommended highly for imaginative, playful children.  Probably not that great for ""brainey"" type children whose parents push ""academics"" on them before they learn to crawl. Parents who claim their children are ""brilliant"" at 2 years old probably won't appreciate this old-fashioned type of children's entertainment. If your children like true child's entertainment which doesn't try to push academics on them, this is a wonderful DVD.",1352419200,,702,5.345454545454546

My 2 year old twins called it the ""E-I-O"" movie, and wanted to constantly watch it! Its got fun songs to sing along to, alot of other kids on the screen to watch dancing around. Best of all, its mom friendly, with these DVD's you just pop them into the DVD player and they play on their own, and replay until your kid gets sick of it!

I was so happy to find it on DVD and couldn't wait to play it for my 18 mo. old grandson. He's a little too young to sing along yet but he loves it too! He was very entertained and was clapping, dancing and making the animal sounds. I'm very happy with this DVD!",1346630400,,397,4.037974683544304
1620087,5,B00005KI3Q,"OMG!!! First of all let me just say that I am now 24 years old and my mom bought me the Kidsongs VHS tapes when I was a youngster. Old Macdonalds Farm was by far my favorite. When I found out that they were on dvd I didn't hesitate to order them for my 2 year old. SHE LOVES IT! Heck, I love it! The series are all well put together. As a child I remember feeling as though I was on some sort of singing and dancing field trip! My baby girl sings the songs all day long, it has even helped her vocabulary. I would recommend this series but moreso this dvd to anyone who has young kids or works in a daycare. It is definitely and oldy but oh so goody!!",1340496000,,651,3.8656716417910446

My son is autistic and enjoys music but many kids programs don't interest him. I borrowed the dvd for the weekend and it only got turned off when he fell asleep. He loves this video and even sings the songs. A big plus is that the dvd keeps playing automatically.

1620094,3,B00005KI3Q,"My 2 year old daughter loved ""Kidsongs - Baby Animal Songs"" so much that I bought this product sight unseen. I have to say I am a little disappointed. Baby Animal Songs is really good and mesmerized my daughter (I give that video 5 stars). For this one, she makes it through about 5 minutes and starts yelling ""nooo!"" I have to say that it is a little dated, but beyond that, it is also sort of creepy, especially the scarecrow character. I also think the songs are ordered wrong and it starts a little too slow. Your kid may love it, and it definitely is better than most of the videos out there, but my picky daughter didn't care for it.",1274745600,,639,4.245901639344262

for her 1st Birthday. At 12 months old she just loves it. She bounces to the music, loves the ducks, horses, cows. She also

loves the previews of all the other KIDSONGS DVD""S. She doesn""t take her eyes off the screen, and she's happy,pointing,jabering

1620126,5,B00005KI3Q,"My daughter (2) loves this DVD and the previews of other DVD's are whole songs so it's like having bonus features instead of advertizing. Cows, horses, sheep, wagon rides, chores and recreation - very well done.",1233187200,,211,4.888888888888889
1620127,5,B00005KI3Q,I bought this for my dd because of how much I loved it when I was a kid. She absolutely adores it- they basically go from song to song quickly enough to hold her attention.,1232582400,,172,3.942857142857143
1620128,4,B00005KI3Q,"I am a Grandmother now.  My daughters had lots of videos they watched when they were younger but this one tops their MEMORIES.

I recently purchased for my new Grandbaby!",1231632000,,170,4.633333333333334
1620129,5,B00005KI3Q,"I actually first saw this video when I used to babysit...15 years a go!  I looked all over for it now that I have my own 1 1/2 year old son, and I was so happy when I finally found it.  He absolutely loves it! He dances whenever it comes on and tries to imatate all the kids.  It's great for teaching children about animals as well.  It's a great alternative when you can't bear to watch Elmo one more time!",1229990400,,407,3.9876543209876543
1620130,5,B00005KI3Q,My 17 month old has burned a hole in our dvd player with this dvd!  She absolutely LOVES it!  She says all of the animals sounds before they even come up.  Looks like it was made a long time ago but definitely worth it.,1222732800,,219,3.9318181818181817
1620131,5,B00005KI3Q,"I grew up watching this on video and my mom recently gave me a stack of Kidsongs Videos that she was going to through away.  I'm so glad she asked me first because my 20 month old, busy boy, who never sits still has loved sitting and watching these videos.  I'm so excited to have found them on DVD  so he can enjoy them for many years like I did.",1221523200,,347,3.9285714285714284
1620132,2,B00005KI3Q,Would not recommend this to a freind. Boring I made the kids sit through it once and then it was put away for ever!!!,1210204800,,117,3.9166666666666665
1620133,5,B00005KI3Q,"A few months ago my 2 year old daughter (who never wants to watch tv/movies) chose Kidsongs ""A visit to Old MacDonald's Farm"" to check out from the library. She absolutely loved it and was very mesmerized by it. After checking it out every week for over a month I ordered it from amazon.com. I run a Montessori preschool out of my home and showed it to the children one day for movie friday and now that's all they want to watch! They love to sing along and go through the motions. My daughter has become obsessed with Scarecrow (the host of the movie) and will be a scarecrow for Halloween. I've yet to show the movie to a kid that doesn't love it. I also recommend the Kidsongs Circus movie.",1193616000,5,693,4.297709923664122
1620134,3,B00005KI3Q,"This is our second Kidsongs video, and while the songs are all good, I'd recommend the parents to avoid this one if your child's afraid of clowns.  The scarecrow, a central character in the video, is not exactly a cuddly, reassuring presence.  Furthermore, his facial makeup is like a clown's.  My 2.5 year old son's afraid of clowns, as many kids are, and thus he doesn't like to watch this video.",1191456000,6,398,4.577464788732394
1620135,5,B00005KI3Q,"One of our very favorite kidsong episodes!!

Great entertainment (looks dated, especially the costumes and make-up).

The singing, dancing and kid participation are just excellent !!

We love this one even with the dated look.",1175817600,3,226,5.4
1620146,5,B00005KI3Q,My grandkids are crazy about this video.  They have watched it over and over.,1168300800,2,77,4.5
1620147,5,B00005KI3Q,MY daughter loves the songs in it. She is 2+ and after an active day she gets to relax watching it. I recommend this to kids who love music.,1162512000,5,140,3.8620689655172415
1620148,3,B00005KI3Q,"Its pretty good for something from 20 years ago, however, I was worried my toddler would get A.D.D. watching it because the scenes are constantly changing and erratic. My toddler enjoys ""Toddler Tunes"" and ""Silly Songs"" by cedarmontkids much more.",1160352000,2,247,5.2
1620149,4,B00005KI3Q,"Yes, this is the one I remember. As a child, I loved this video, but my 2-year-old...not so much. Maybe he'll grow into it. I think the pace of it is just too slow for him right now. It would be great if Kidsongs would reproduce some of these classic sing-alongs with an up-to-date style.",1134259200,2,288,4.254545454545455
1620150,3,B00005KI3Q,"My 18 month old triplets love animals but his video isn't one of their favorites.  They do love Baby Einstein's Baby Mac Donald, A Day on the Farm...  That's one of their favorites!",1126051200,,181,4.454545454545454

1620152,5,B00005KI3Q,"My 1 year old twins generally need to watch a new video at least twice before they like it but they were enthralled by this video from the beginning. Perhaps it is because they were already familiar with some of the songs, and perhaps it is also because they see lots of children singing in the video. Whatever the reasons, my girls really enjoy this video, and personally I think it is great too, and very suitable for the little ones. I highly recommend this video to anyone with infants and young children.",1072224000,14,509,4.483870967741935
1620153,5,B00005KI3Q,"I've been working 3 years at a daycare center, and I recently brought all of my daughter's old Kidsongs Videos to work. The kids LOVED them! A Day at Old MacDonald's Farm is a favorite of theirs. The kids have watched A Day at the Circus and A Day at Old MacDonald's Farm so much I've had to buy new ones! They sit there and sing along to almost every song. They would watch Kidsongs videos for HOURS on end if I'd let them. They LOVE kidsongs. I strongly recommend any Kidsongs Video for children and the child in you! Kidsongs are definately Preschool Pleasers.",1043020800,3,563,4.371428571428571
1620154,5,B00005KI3Q,I got this music video for my son who is 2 years and 10 months. He loves going to the farm and looking at farm animals. I read the reviews and decided to give it a try. Christmas morning my son opened his present and demanded to watched it right away. He could not stop. He absolutly loves it and gets very excited every time he watches it. It truly brings the magic of going to the farm. I love to watch my little one when he watches his video and see how his eyes glow of delight.,1041897600,,482,3.9285714285714284
