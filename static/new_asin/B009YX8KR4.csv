5373135,3,B009YX8KR4,"Another ""slice of life"" movie ... unfortunately, the life we're seeing a slice of is depressingly boring, until she hooks up with a younger man. They seem to fall in love, but she is not really ready for a May-July relationship (she's not really THAT much older than the guy and much of the time she acts like a moody teenager). In general, the movie is enjoyable, has it's funny as well as poignant moments, but the ending may be a let down for some--you may want a little more closure than they give you.",1356739200,,506,4.336842105263158

5373137,4,B009YX8KR4,"""Hello I Must Be Going"" (2012 release; 95 min.) brings the story of Amy (played by Melanie Lynskey), a thirty-something who has just moved back into her parens' house after her husband left and divorced her. Amy hasn't legt the house in three months and doesn't get up before noon. In other words: depressed. Amy's dad, who is a lawyer, is trying to woo a potential new client, and at a dinner party with the potential new client and his extended family including his 19 yr. old stepson Jeremy (played by Christopher Abbott), Jeremy and Amy develop an instant crush on each other. Soon therafter, they have a fully blooming affair. Inevitably, one day, they get found out. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: (1) it must be Melanie Lynskey weekend for me here in Cincinnati: I just saw her yesterday in a (much smaller) role in ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" and now today she stars front and center in this movie. It is easily one of her best roles ever, like she was made to play this role. If the movie gets any legs in the theatres, she might be a contender for an Leading Actress Oscar Nomination. (2) While the subject matter of the movie certainly is nothing new, it is brought to life by screenwriter Sarah Koskoff and director Todd Louiso (a Cincinnati native I might add, graduated from the Cincinnati School for Creative and Performing Arts). (3) Check out also the very nice original soundtrack, which is courtesy of Canadian singer-songwriter Laura Veirs.

Last but not least, if you are wondering about the movie's title: Amy is watching a number of Marx Brothers films throughout the movie, reminding her of happier times in her youth when hanging out with dad. The tile comes from a song by Groucho Marx of the same title in ""Animal Crackers"". (And incidentally, it is also the source for the Phil Collins album of the same name in the early 80s.) In all, there is nothing earth-shattering about this movie, but that didn't stop by from really enjoying this divorce and family drama from start to finish. If you are in the mood for a quality indie-movie, ""Hello I Must Be Going"" is highly recommended!",1349481600,11,2227,4.621212121212121
5373138,4,B009YX8KR4,"This is pretty standard romantic comedy fare; the most amusing part is the May/December romance (well, not really December...) which features a (sorta) older woman and a younger man.

A recent divorce has to move back home because her husband wanted the divorce and she has never held a job. Now she is caught in a spiral of embarrassment, ennui, and agoraphobia. Her well-meaning parents are anxious for her to get out and start to take an interest in life: she hasn't left the house for three months. They decide to throw a party for one of Dad's clients to pave the way for his possible retirement, while at the same time, to motivate their daughter to change out of her old t-shirt and meet some new people.

We meet:
  * Melanie Lynskey (""Ever After"") is Amy, sorely in need of an antidepressant; she mixes her metaphors and says, ""I had the rug pulled over my eyes.""
  * Blythe Danner (""The Lucky One"") is Ruth, her mother, who reads Dr. Seuss to her grandchildren and longs to have some ""alone time"" with her husband on a lengthy cruise.
  * Christopher Abbot (""Martha Marcy May Marlene"") is Jeremy, the best anti-depressant our heroine ever tried! He tells his mother he is gay so she will quit trying to set up blind dates.
  * John Rubinstein (Lots of TV) is Stan, who really IS reluctant to retire and Gallivant the Globe with his wife.
  * Julie White (""Inside Out"") is Gwen, the former classmate who never knew our heroine existed, but now she's in her face.

We sometimes forget that it might not be all that great to be nineteen again, particularly when the woman you love views you as a boy toy.

I liked the soundtrack which included ""Oh the fox went out on a chilly night, prayed to the moon to give him light, He'd many a mile to go that night, before he reached the town-o, town-o, town-o....""

 Amazon.com will notify me when the DVD is available.",1348444800,15,1868,4.482248520710059

5373194,2,B009YX8KR4,"I am unsure why this has such a high rating.  Yes, it is well acted and when people call it a 'slice of life' that is an apt description, but those 'slice of life' films can be kind of depressing.  It was well acted and it didn't lose my attention but again, as I said,  just sort of depressing slice of life. It was relatable, true but a bit too realistic for my taste.  If you watch this, I hope you like the 'F' word because you are going to hear it about 300 times.  It was to the point of ridiculous.",1515974400,,505,3.911764705882353

Yes, like some others reviews pointed out, it was a bit formulaic, and the storyline was pretty predictable, but I loved the onscreen chemistry between actors Melanie L and Christopher A. This also was very relatable for me, and for many twenty-something or thirty-something folks, who are still figuring out life. I loved that the film evoked different emotions. There were sad scenes, awkward and comical scenes, and scenes that just frustrated you. All in all, a cute movie that I would recommend.",1515715200,,540,5.078651685393258

I am now in love with Melanie Lynskey after watching this film. And hopefully there will be more roles like this for women in the future where instead of being objectified they are given platforms to reveal and explore humanity.",1515628800,,491,5.0

This is a charming, smarter- than-you-might-imagine story about a recently divorced 30-plus Amy (Melanie Lynskey), hard-pressed to come up with a scintilla of self-confidence. Smart as a whip, winningly approachable and dear, shes  a notorious non-completer. Enter 19-year-old sensitive, accomplished Jeremy (Christopher Abbott) and the self-appraising universe shifts.  The 2 leads are phenomenal, the entire cast top-notch. A quality movie in all disciplines. Sometimes a film neednt be heavy to be worthy.  Loved it!",1515283200,,690,5.669902912621359

5373215,4,B009YX8KR4,"The story of a young woman going through a major life transition, not simply recovering from divorce, but something much deeper is going on -- while she finds her way through, lessons about love are learned. It's an indy film about upper-class people living on the edge, the clients they need to get and keep in order to continue on, the family relationships in which you find out what people think about you, and what you think and feel about you. It's a character study, and relationship drama, well scripted and acted, directed. Some sex scenes, but not explicit, some yelling, some swearing, some things break, but it's not violent. Yay. You don't know what's going to happen, and the end is a bit surprising. Melanie Lynskey is quite credible in this performance, as are they all. Enjoyed the Marx Brothers contributions, too. If I were rating the film instead of whether I liked it, think it's ok, or loved it, I'd give it a 3.5* out of 5*.",1514160000,2,946,4.603550295857988

5373246,2,B009YX8KR4,"Same quirky low budget Hollywood filler film. This is one of those movies about a insecure, quirky, loser adult woman that has poor judgement and coping strategies. She gets involved with someone that she probably shouldn't only to learn in the end that 'love conquers all"" and ""everything will be ok"". If you're depressed this a film for you. If you're not, it will make you depressed. It even has the Simon & Garfunkle like film score to get you all ""Apple-ly"" about the subject matter.",1512777600,,488,4.686046511627907
5373247,2,B009YX8KR4,"This was....not good. The acting was alright but the plot, the setting, the entire heartbeat of the film -- was boooo-ring. It's like, ""Oh! What will I tell my parents?"" Who gives a sh*t, you're 30-something years old.

Watch this if you want to feel like the director is ""finally telling your story""... but your story took place in a house that had a circular driveway with a marble fountain in the middle of it. If you strip it down to its core, okay, I can get behind the story -- undergoing this dramatic life shift against your will, having to give up all the comforts of adulthood and move back in with your parents, depression -- that story is intriguing. I like that, I can relate to that. But as soon as you center it around these two people who just don't know what to do with themselves despite the fact that they've been given every possible opportunity in the world for success, it becomes something that's really hard to sit through. And even that little recap sentence makes it sound more interesting than it is. It's not even as interesting as how I just described it.

Also, *spoiler*, that scene at the end where he runs and hides in a dark room and then tries to exit through the porch door but it's locked, and then he goes: ""I didn't think you were going to be here."" ..? Um, it's her dad's retirement party dude. Pretty sure she's going to be there.

Bottom line, as a viewer, the whole movie I was just like: Grow up. Especially the dude: Grow. the f. up. There are way too many men walking around this earth who are just waiting, acting like children, hoping for a sucker to come and scoop them up. This is where you see one of those, enjoy.",1512604800,2,1665,4.347266881028939
5373248,4,B009YX8KR4,"I liked the cast, the acting, the writing, and the sets.  I didn't like the slow plot that much, but it was well-acted enough to sustain my interest.  In the end, it just seemed like a bunch of spoiled rich people's slice of life.",1511654400,2,230,4.204545454545454

5373280,4,B009YX8KR4,"This small budget film stars Melanie Lynskey, formerly famous as the next-door neighbor to Charlie Sheen's character in Two and a Half Men, and since the demise of that long-running TV show trying to establish whether she can or cannot do serious acting (in the lead role) in a full-length movie, not only deliver funny one-liners.  Yes, she can.  [And I know, it's not her first either]

She gives a fine and nuanced performance to her part, in this non-comedic 94 minute story about a young woman recovering from a divorce, about her parents and their problems, her friends, and about her unexpectedly beginning a relationship that intellectually she tells herself cannot possibly be long-term, and really would best be avoided altogether.  And, about what this relationship teaches her that she hadn't learned at home, nor in college, nor in her first marriage, about love relationships.  There are no characters here without their flaws (just like in real life) but there is something here about love meaning overlooking or accepting the flaws, and about growth.

I didn't see this as just a love story, nor as a comedy, nor as a drama [aka: Depressing Movie, or Lifetime TV movie] but as a good character study (or several of them).  There is nothing flashy about the cinematography, the plot is modest, and there are no Lines for the Ages, but there's plenty of close-ups on the faces, which really requires the actors to ACT, in order for it to work.  It works.  [Perhaps the least well-drawn character is the lead male, which seemed a little two-dimensional compared to the rest of the main characters].

I also liked the drama between the mother and the divorced daughter and the way the movie touched on how parents of adult children sometimes judge them by their failures in life. One of the best lines was when Jung was quoted as saying:  ""The greatest tragedy of the family is the unlived lives of the parents.""  This tells you what forces play into the family dynamic.  The humor comes up in the frantic sex scenes, which are fun and also well acted.  You feel that breathless excitement as they bring each other to life.

5373304,4,B009YX8KR4,"I'm sure it will get compared to Silver Linings Playbook but it is not as good.  While SLP has the Hollywood happy ending it is also more realistic.  I'm a little tired of watching rich people cope with their problems.  I know their problems are the same but it's hard to care about a poor little rich girl.

The movie is well acted and Melanie Lynskey is great but the whole resolution at the end felt like a film school project.  In spite fo all this, I liked it because of Lynskey's performance and felt it was compelling.

Four stars seems a bit much but according to Amazon, it means only that ""I like it,"" which is true.",1369440000,5,626,4.262711864406779
5373305,2,B009YX8KR4,"Probably supposed to be a rom-com, but is pretty feeble.  Once again a woman is shattered by being dumped, she lies around doing nothing until she is re-energized by a new guy, she gives a ""Now I'm free of you"" speech to the old guy and marches off to start a new independent life.  Nothing about this movie is different from many similar movies.  And if a woman is supposed to discover how she can make her own decisions and live her own life, why does it always seem to take a guy to trigger this process?",1368489600,2,507,4.206185567010309

Christopher Abbott was wonderful eye candy but that shouldn't take away from his performance, which was extremely believable.  Blythe Danner was great as always.  The movie is basically about life falling apart and learning to start over and find out what makes you happy.",1366243200,,416,4.816901408450704

Not that there is necessarily anything wrong with that premise, or the one depicted in this film, but this is a niche movie and some people will like it and some people won't.",1364860800,,361,4.46969696969697
5373308,5,B009YX8KR4,"Life is messy.  Sometimes things happen that force us to reevaluate our messy lives and in the end force us into reckless behavior.  This is explored with depth and a deft hand in `Hello I Must Be Going' a semi-tragic romantic comedy that introduces us to a recent divorcee with excess baggage to spare.

`Hello I Must Be Going' tells us the story of Amy, a young woman who has been living with her parents ever since her husband left her.  She has been reduced to a sobbing mess and hasn't left the house in months, spending her days watching classic films and mopping around the house in oversized men's tee-shirts.  Her mother, the ever positive (but in that way that makes you feel so negative) Ruth, pleads with Amy to make some changes.  Spruce up, cheer up, put a dress on!  We have friends coming over for dinner and this is a big deal for your father SO DON'T RUIN IT!!!  What Amy gets from dinner is priceless though, and just what she needed, or was it?  Yes, Amy meets the 19-year old Jeremy; an actor who hates acting and pretends to be gay so him mother won't try and set him up with anyone.  Jeremy is attracted to Amy and Amy is consumed with this tingly feeling that comes from being desired and being naughty (since he's quite the younger man and the situation could potentially be devastating for their parents).  Soon the affair erupts and Amy's already fragile emotional balance is thrust on it's head.

So much about this film works on so many levels that I'm saddened it didn't receive a bigger push when it was released.  I mean, how many people actually have heard of this movie?  Melanie Lynskey anchors this film with so much heart and soul.  She embodies Amy and lets her breath, running the gamut of emotions in a way that feels so natural.  What is so beautiful about Lynskey's performance is that she is able to find such depth in a character that could have been a clich.  She adds so many beautiful touches (the happy moments in particular are so special to the development of her character).  She understands how to shade her portrayal with enough childish touches to create a fully realized woman.  She is jaded, she is pained, she is justified and yet she can't communicate these feelings correctly in a house filled to the brim with people so detached from the reality of life.

The rest of the cast is certainly up to par, with Blythe Danner playing an aged variation of what I perceive her real life daughter Gwyneth Paltrow to be like, and I loved every minute of it!  She devoured her scenes and played up the `oppressive yet in a way that she doesn't feel is oppressive' angle marvelously.

I'm in love with this film.  One of the best of the year, for sure, and a hidden gem for the many, many people who don't know yet that it exists.",1363910400,3,2778,4.446640316205533

- characters have no substance whatsoever
- chemistry between Lynskey and her love interest is seriously lacking
- extensive use of cliches (she is looking to re-invent herself as a person after years spent in a bad marriage, he is pressured by his family into being someone he does not want to be, yada-yada)

A tale of a young, newly divorced woman, hiding out in her parents' home, who finally decides to take some risks. A fling with a much younger man sets things in motion and enables her to face her demons. Along the way she discovers that her parents' marriage may not be what it seems to be. Old loyalties change and there are several delightful twists at the end. A romantic, poignant and funny at times film that leaves the viewer with something to think about. A great cast.

5373330,5,B009YX8KR4,"Although this film might be seen as formulaic, it's the two female leads that make it work. Amy is quirky & slightly puzzled & lost in wonder. Her mother is so grounded she can't seem to ever get off the ground. There are dreams & nightmares but they are real life for the characters in this movie & you get to watch how they deal with those moments because like all dreams & nightmares, they tend to come to a quick end. I wouldn't call this a slice of life but compressed life. I'm really glad I watched it & I'll watch it again. Melanie Lynskey is a wonderful actress & she has a natural beauty that reminds me of Kelly MacDonald & Emily Mortimer. Although I know it will not impress her to find this out, she has added another fan to her circle that I am certain is very wide & quite full.",1358553600,4,793,4.122580645161291

I liked this one. There was a good cross between typical rom-com scenes and truer to life indie scenes. Very understated and never hysterical, but I laughed a bit and smiled a lot.

Those around her can't really see this and in their view she just lingers in suspended animation (like sleep walking). The young man ""Jeremy"" being an artist (artist can and do see the world differently) sees a lovely young women who is alive (with emotion) in the moment, while the rest of the people around them are sleepwalking through life, doing what is expected of them, in their little routines. Suddenly two passionate people who find themselves alive and in the moment, finding love and sex, passion and honesty. The girl, Amy really struggles not fully aware until a pivotal point (latter in the movie) where she fully understands that only in the darkness of her pain is where the little fragile light of love's candle was able to illuminate what it really means to be loved and to love. So from the misery of her mourning to the ecstasy of love she realizes that she has to hold on to this new found wisdom and not sleepwalk through life but start living awake with passion. As the story ends Jeremy is going to college and Amy to finish her graduate work in photography, leaving us to wonder if we are sleepwalkers? As for Amy and Jeremy, will they go back to sleepwalking through life or find the true nature and live an authentic life? Will they find real love with someone else or have the courage to find each other again?",1522281600,,1520,4.432142857142857
