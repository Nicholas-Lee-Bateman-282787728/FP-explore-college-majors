962342,5,6305080089,"My one-year-old boy loves this video. It's composed of the parts of the show he really likes; mostly dancing Teletubbies, and ""baby sun face."" The tubbies do a follow the leader dance, a splashing dance,  and a stomping dance, plus a few others, I think.
As soon as I put in  this video, my son started dancing, without any encouragement. Now, he's  starting to try to trot when the video comes to the ""trot-trot""  part. This video makes him laugh and smile a lot, and calmed him down a lot  when he couldn't sleep the night before a surgery. While the things it  teaches aren't what most would consider ""learning objectives""  (dancing, trotting, waving bye-bye) it's definitely right at my son's  learning level. A great investment if you have a kid age 10 months to 18  months, I think.",945043200,18,788,4.611510791366906
962343,5,6305080089,"Ignore all of the conflict you hear about the Teletubbies.  This is a wonderful, educational, fun show for infants and toddlers!  My 8 month old pays complete attention to the entire show and can sit through almost of  the movie.  She recognizes the Teletubbies in the store and lights up.  In  this video, there is lots of slow action and cute music that she really  seems to be able to follow and understand.  I recommend this video for any  child from birth to about 3 or 4.",920851200,4,477,4.390804597701149

962530,5,6305080089,"As the parent of an extremely active and easily bored 7 month-old, I don't know what I would do without this video.  Our daughter absolutely LOVES it.  With all the expensive equipment we have to entertain her, this ...video is the only item that holds her attention for any length of time.  When she starts to cry, we happily reply with, ""Time for Teletubbies!""  Our vocabulary at home now includes ""jumpy catchy ball"", ""hee-ya"", and ""again, again"".  Our little one squeals, laughs, giggles, and ""talks"" to this video...even though she can't mimic the movements yet, she is definitely interacting and not just being stuck in front of the television.  She gets a little bored with the real-life segments, but we can always fast-forward to the songs and dances.  We have other Teletubbies videos, but this one is almost all music, and is definitely the least annoying.  I want to give this video a BIIIIG HUUUUG!",1051315200,7,911,4.832258064516129
962531,5,6305080089,"My little boy from about 18 months and continuing to about age 2 1/2 was a big fan of the Teletubbies. Because of this, and the fact that he liked music and dancing, we picked up this video for him. It was a big hit. In fact, if does want to watch a Teletubbie video, this is usually the one he'll choose even now.
This is just a collection of the dances you see on the other videos, television shows, and a few new ones thrown in. There is no talking except for the announcer naming the dance. There are not any really silly antics such as bumping into each other, etc, unless it's tied into the dance. The music is fun and upbeat.
Both of my children enjoy dancing to the music and trying to do what they see the Teletubbies do.
I realize that there is some controversy over the Teletubbies, and I realize that many people don't like them in general. However, I didn't pick this little video up for myself, I picked it up for my child. He likes it and now so does my baby girl (age 15 months).
I tend to believe that kids should play with toys rather than sit in front of a tv. However, there are times that you want your child to be entertained for a few minutes. If this is the case, then I have found this to be a good video for that.",1023753600,8,1239,4.061224489795919
962532,5,6305080089,"My daughters (now 2.5 years and 13 months)have always enjoyed the Teletubbies and this video is their favourite.  Probably because of all the music and dancing that goes on in this video ... and quite easy dance moves that they can follow along to.  This video keeps them busy while I can take a shower in peace in the mornings.  My favourite part of the video is not actually the Teletubbies but the video of the children doing the ""boom boom dance"".  The girls and I love dancing to that!  One your young Teletubbie fan will enjoy!",1017619200,,533,4.453608247422681
962533,5,6305080089,"I do not understand my 18 month old daughter's incredible love for this video. She likes Elmo, enjoys a couple of other videos we've shown her, but her overwhelming excitement the minute this tape comes on screen is hypnotic to watch. It's like there is something going on in this program that only a little girl can see. And, her excitement does not dissipate as the program plays. She would, if permitted, watch the entire video over and over again.
I am not one for letting her get caught up in video watching, but frankly, she not only watches the tape, she dances to it, jumps up and down with it, overflows with emotion at the sun-baby, laughs at the bunnies (the real ones) and stamps her feet with the tap-dancing little bear.
So, as the title of this review states, ""I don't get it, and I don't care"", my little pumpkin' thinks the Tubbies are the coolest thing (next to dad, of course). :)",1005782400,7,899,4.454545454545454
962534,4,6305080089,"After reading the rave reviews in this section, I purchased this video hoping for that long-awaited relaxing coffee break. But as I slid in the video hoping to see my toddler become absorbed by the fun, I was disappointed to find that she insisted on Mommy joining in with her on the dances! I now cannot put on the video without having to participate all the way to the end.
But I realized that maybe it was less coffee breaks and more exercise that I had really needed. Following through with all the dances as best you can is quite a work-out.
And yes, she does love it, for all the reasons mentioned by the other reviewers. All the more chances for me to shape up!",973123200,9,668,4.309523809523809
962535,5,6305080089,Hello. I am 24 and a student from China. I started watching the teletubbies in 1997 when it started. Their antics moved me and I now know more English than ever before. It amazed me how even the people who missed  out on their childhoods in English speaking environments can pick it up in  just a few weeks by locking the door to you're flat and watching  teletubbies videos over and over again. This video enabled me to speak  perfet Englis and I'm forever grateful to it.,963705600,2,473,4.402298850574713
962536,5,6305080089,"My 18 month old daughter loves this tape!  Since she started watching Teletubbies, she is learning more words. She loves to see them dance and all the kids dance...specially Loretta. The hour long video gives me the  chance to get some laundry done or just read a book while she watches  contently. I even have it playing on long trips in my van's VCR. She now  wants anything Tubbies and to keep her from watching tv too much, I buy  tubby books and read them to her instead. Or while she plays, have tubby  music, and she enjoys it all the same",958089600,7,546,4.303921568627451
