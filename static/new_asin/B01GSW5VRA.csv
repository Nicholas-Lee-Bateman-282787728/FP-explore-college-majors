Not sure if it was the disk or the New 4k player",1480636800,,111,4.333333333333333
7767586,3,B01GSW5VRA,"Picked this up at Costco today for $20. It's not bad. Fairly lightweight, not too in-depth. There are some very good underwater shots of beluga whales, narwhals, and an amazing underwater shot of a bowhead whale with its mouth open, swimming and eating. The wildlife is the best part, but there's not a ton of it, just a few minutes. I was disappointed that the underwater shots were not in 3D. Some decent landscape shots. The story of the researchers is pretty generic, if you've watched nature documentaries, you've seen most of this stuff before. For me, not quite worth the purchase price, but I'm very glad to have that bowhead whale footage.",1479427200,5,648,4.743362831858407
