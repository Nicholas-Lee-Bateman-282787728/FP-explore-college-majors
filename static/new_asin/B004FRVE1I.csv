8428235,4,B004FRVE1I,"This Children's DVD is one in a series of nine about the New Testament. Each DVD in the series is self-containing; the DVDs in the series do not need the previous or following DVD to tell the story, but collectively contributes to telling the entire story of Jesus. The animation is classic Japanese, but the stories on each DVD are slowly told to the point of dragging the pace. The nine DVDs could easily be reduced to four or five. The series itself starts off slow with ""A Child is Born"" and ""The Young Jesus"" DVDs, and only starts picking up with the ""Jesus is Tested"" DVD. The whole concept and idea of the series is good, but it is not well and efficiently executed: viewers (especially children) may get bored with all the inefficient scenes that does not really add anything to the story. Still, it is a good collection to own and watch to introduce children to the New Testament, especially if the prices of the DVDs are kept fairly low ($5 or less).",1436140800,,960,4.4602272727272725
