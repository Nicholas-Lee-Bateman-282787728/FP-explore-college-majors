6300226,5,B00IVLRAPS,"As an octogenarian, I may have entered my second childhood in enjoying Dinosaur Train.
However, it embodies the standards of happy family life, affection, fun, wit, poetry and cleverness
that I appreciate.  It's nice to have Ptaranodon laughter echoing through the house, to
share the adventures of Buddy, Tiny, Shiny and Don, and to discover the distinct personality traits
of each of the characters.",1475107200,2,401,5.265625
