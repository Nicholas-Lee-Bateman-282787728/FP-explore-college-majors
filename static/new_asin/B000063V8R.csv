My husband is a very serious star trek fan and has series 3 on tape. But he is now trying to collect then on dvd,as and when we have the money.",1019520000,2,281,3.9473684210526314
1693044,5,B000063V8R,"o.k. now the series is great. After the first two so-so seasons we finally got the Star Trek we wanted. Not a carbon copy of the original but something with life and energy. If you want to defend the first two seasons that is fine but, this one and the ones that follow are far superior. I'll probably pre-order this one before I even go buy the others. If you liked the show but do not want to shell out three hundred dollars just to get to the good stuff then start here.",1016323200,8,473,4.096774193548387
1693045,5,B000063V8R,"This is the season that started it all, the year a half-hearted imitation of a legend began building it's own legacy.  From the feature film quality episode ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" to the mind blowing cliff hanger finale of ""Best of Both Worlds"", the third season of TNG had it all.  It turned my friends and I from occasional viewers into die hard fans.  You can shell out the money for the first two seasons if you have to be a completist, but you really only need to start with this set to have the best of what sci-fi on television has to offer.",1015804800,5,550,4.372549019607843
1693046,5,B000063V8R,"Now this is where it gets interesting! After the shortened and varied second season, The Next Generation finally gets going in the third season. Not only is the writing brilliant but the production values have had a shot in the arm. The revised title sequence is much stronger and the title music is re-mixed. The entire ship looks and sounds better too, with the new uniforms with the collars (much better).
A new director of photography was brought whose lighting technique allowed them to get rid of that ""this is obviously filmed in a studio"" look when creating planet side sequences. This season also has some of the best scores to accompany the series before it became a constant rehash of the same orchestral sequences later on in the programme. Ron Jones does a particularly excellent job, especially with ""The Best of Both Worlds"" and newcomer Jay Chattaway's score to ""Tin Man"" turned a mediocre episode into something more emotional.
This season shines with great episodes such as The Enemy (Romulans!), The Defector (real spy thriller stuff), The Hunted, The High Ground (terrorist episode). There are however 2 stunners: ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" and ""The Best of Both Worlds."" Alternative timelines and the Borg have always made some of the best episodes - Yesterday's Enterprise gives Tasha Yar a chance to return for an episode where the Federation is still at war with the Klingons. The Best of Both Worlds is the high point of the entire series - great story, great effects, great music, and that feeling of ""they can't do that"" when the ""To be continued...."" line appeared on the screen. Great stuff.

1693103,3,B000063V8R,"It feels like The Next Generation really hits it's stride with season three. The first season was gratuitously cheesy, the second season pretentious (and still cheesy), and it's finally when we get to the third season that the cast and crew seem to hit their stride. Characters are more enjoyable and believable, with all of them having rich, entertaining background stories to explore.

I will admit that the season starts fairly weakly. The first episode, 'Evolution', with Wesley's nanobots, had me wondering how on earth he wasn't reprimanded and booted from Starfleet (heck, later in the season he's made an ensign. I guess who cares about the destruction and near death caused by his pet project.) 'The Survivors;, with the elderly couple on the desolated planet (and that awful music box... someone take a phaser to it!) was another chore, and ""Who watches the watchers"" was the pinnacle of obnoxious anti-religious storytelling.

Things get a little better with ""The Enemy"", with some fascinating cold war/brinkmanship with the Romulans, then subsequently take a dive with the horrendously goofy and cringe-worthy episode ""The Price"" (and please, no more 80's-style aerobic classes in the Enterprise corridors... isn't there a holodeck for working out?)

""Yesterday's Enterprise"" was an enjoyable return of Tasha Yar, although the fact that both Enterprise's would just happen to be in the same spot in the universe where they would run into one another seems horrendously implausible. Cool, yet implausible. ""Sarek"" was a great connection with the original series, although the episodes around this one just feel like cheesy filler until we get to the penultimate cliffhanger, ""Best of Both Worlds"", with the anxiously-awaited return of the Borg. Fantastic episode, but it does raise the question: what on earth is wrong with Riker that he doesn't take his own command? Even after the cliffhanger is resolved in season 4 ep. 1, we still don't get a clear answer. He's qualified, he's been offered his own command, and he's down three years at least with the Enterprise so far, so what's his deal? Its not until the LAST TNG film that he finally get's his own command? Why did it take so long for him to finally accept promotion?

In any case, this season is a mixed bag. Good to see Next Generation find it's groove, but not without a few awful episodes along the way.",1488240000,,2377,5.010126582278481
1693104,2,B000063V8R,"Some of the episodes were really interesting plots. Too many of them however, were therapy for old feminists or social justice warriors. The best feature of the prime video player is the feature that lets the viewer advance to the next episode which I did many many times. There was 1 episode in the series later in the life of the show that was particularly embarrassing and racist. It was about the relocation of American Indians from a planet they had only settled 20 years previously. The Indians looked like they were dressed to play parts in a 1950s western and talked the same way. Supposedly the time frame was a couple of centuries into the future and yet the Indians were dressed and acted like they were in a Wild West show from the 1800s. This was a common feature of every season of the show. Be ready to hit the next episode button.",1486598400,,846,4.464516129032258

1693138,5,B000063V8R,"It's Star Trek TNG. Basically, you can't go wrong.  Some of the strongest episodes come from this season, the character driven episodes where you gain more of a clear view on some of your favorite people on the show.

The writers do repeat similar themes regularly this time around - mediations and court rulings spring to mind. They also didn't seem to know what to do with one or two of the characters this season, and regretfully, you rarely get to see some of the lead 9 characters. The familiar young faces of actors that went on to be more notable are always fun to spot though.

The episodes are almost always fun to watch and are nicely self-contained so you really don't need to have watched any of the previous episodes to be able to enjoy with out feeling lost.

1693528,4,B000063V8R,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" had a rocky start -- the first season was a wasteland of pretension, and the second season was merely mediocre.

But the third season was where the series bloomed, fully coming into its own with new writers and a lessening of Gene Roddenberry's eccentric viewpoints. It still had some issues and a few self-righteous moments, but ""Star Trek: The Next Generation: Season 3"" moved the story into far more intelligent, well-developed ideas and political strife, as well as the return of one of Star Trek's greatest villain species.

Doctor Crusher (Gates McFadden) returns to the Enterprise just in time for her son Wesley (Wil Wheaton) to accidentally endanger the ship with his science project -- he had his nanites communicate with each other, and now they've evolved into intelligent life. This would be less disastrous if the ship weren't right next to an about-to-erupt pulsar, and an attempt to kill them didn't lead to deadly retaliation.

And that's only the start of the series. From then on, they have to deal with stubborn colonists, Q (John De Lancie) being stripped of his godlike powers, accusations of murder and treachery, ancient blood feuds, a booby trap, an escaped super-soldier, the creation of a gynoid, a living starship, a mysterious pair of senior citizens, kidnappings, shore leave gone awry, and an awkward crewman who seeks social acceptance on the holodeck.

The highlights: the arrival of the legendary Vulcan diplomat Sarek (Mark Lenard) heralds sudden outbursts of violence among the crew, and the sudden appearance of the Enterprise-C leads to a radically altered timeline. And finally, the cybernetic aliens known as the Borg begin their devastating invasion of Federation space, with a very familiar face as the herald of their arrival...

One of the best aspects of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation: Season 3"" is that after two seasons of stifling moral certitude, it was time to examine serious moral dilemmas and issues once again. Oh, sometimes it's a bit too simplistic (""The Hunted""), but most of the time they deal with some serious issues worthy of the Star Trek ideal, such as the repercussions of the Prime Directive, the implications of new life, and the responsibilities of great power.

There's also a stronger interstellar political undercurrent to this season, with the brewing unrest in the Romulan empire that ensnares the Enterprise more than once, as well as hints that the Klingon empire may be destabilizing as well. It's not quite the arc-driven storytelling that is now much more common in TV, but it adds a feeling of depth, realism and intelligence. And even the standalone episodes are simply better quality -- one episode is essentially a science-fiction retelling of ""Rashomon,"" using the holodeck as part of a criminal investigation.

Flaws? Well, there are a few dud episodes. Some episodes have echoes of the insufferable sense of superiority that suffused the first episode -- for instance, ""Who Watches The Watchers"" has a distinctly anti-religious flavor, and ""The Bonding"" is all about how ""superior"" people are immune to grief. And if you feel it, just repress it.

This season also saw the return of Gates McFadden as Doctor Crusher, and her warmth and passion are a welcome change from the second season. Indeed, the cast had clearly all grown into their roles, and each character has their own distinctive quirks and oddities -- Picard is an introvert with an impressive personality, Geordi has rotten luck with women, Wesley is becoming overly scholarly, Riker's horniness leads to a murder investigation, and Worf's powerful sense of honor leads him into conflict with his own people.

There are a few flaws, but on average ""Star Trek: The Next Generation: Season 3"" is a powerful, well-written string of science fiction stories -- and it ends on one of Star Trek's finest hours (and cliffhangers).",1477785600,2,3904,5.078003120124805

""The Survivors"", ""Booby Trap"", ""The Defector"", ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" -- all classic episodes that shaped the following four seasons. And, of course ""The Best of Both Worlds"", which spring-boarded the show from a syndicated curiosity to a bona fide hit and set in motion events that would affect the show and its movies. There's not a bad episode in this season and there are several great ones.",1468540800,,544,4.860215053763441

1694087,5,B000063V8R,My wife and I enjoy this series especially since we bought the DVD's for all 7 seasons.  We've seen all the shows and we enjoy watching an episode or two now and then on prime video.  Once you get familiar with the characters it's really an interesting series for all of us Trekies.,1468454400,,282,4.30188679245283

1694089,5,B000063V8R,"As Scotty would say, I was a wee lad at the time the original series aired in the sixties, and when they returned Star Trek to TV in the fall of 1987 I was so psyched. The first two seasons were good, but in my opinion the show really found itself in season three. So many good episodes  Yesterdays Enterprise, Deja Q, Sins of the father, Hollow Pursuits  but the best was the unexpected finale The Best of Both Worlds. Great heroes need great villains to play off, and after two seasons of development, we now had the Borg. First appearing in the second season episode Q Who?, in they came heading to Earth in most formidable fashion.

And what happens? With Riker saying Mr. Worf  Fire! that episode, and the season, ended with TO BE CONTINUED  and I almost lost my mind. I believe that was the first time Star Trek had ever employed such a true cliffhanger. Im looking at the clock saying; Ok, 10 minutes left, how are they going to wind this up? Alas, they gave us the summer of 1990 to contemplate, no internet, no social media, it truly was the best of both worlds  a perfect blend of aggravation & exhilaration. And remember, to consider this a great twopart tale is to forget the powerfully poignant epilogue Family, which had Picard on shore leave back home in France dealing with the psychological aftermath.

Now ... Mr. Worf  this was great television!",1468281600,2,1364,4.493927125506073

1694124,3,B000063V8R,"Star Trek Next Gen. is aging gracefully, considering this show debuted in 1987!

Sometimes, on an empty afternoon, a visit to the 24th century, as imagined at a time when I was at the peak of my career and too busy to watch this stuff, can be diverting.  The best episodes are whimsical, imaginative, even poignant.  Too bad the Artificial Intelligence envisioned by the likes of Elon Musk is so much more malignant than the gentle, somewhat naive
Mr. Data ...

My biggest problem is that, according to Brent Spiner, Will Wheaton's adolescent character was intended to represent a typical fan!  No wonder the plots are so tech-heavy and sexually lame.  I think I would enjoy an all-new Star Trek projected 300 years into the future from our current technology base aimed at intelligent ADULTS of BOTH sexes!",1467590400,,807,4.811594202898551

And the female... with one thousand people on board she's the only one who walks around showing off the boobs she wishes she had. She is topless dresses or night gowns and her sole purpose?

1694568,4,B000063V8R,"I'm going to write a single review for all 7 seasons:  STNG is a worthy successor to the classic series.  As Roddenberry's influence faded I think the series got better, for one, Wesley Crusher was allowed to be a real character rather than some idealized son Gene never had.  The plots generally revolve around technology unlike Deep Space Nine where the plots are more character driven.  Overall I like STNG and often go back to watch some of my favourite episodes.  Still, I think Deep Space Nine is generally a better series.  There, Starfleet come across as more human with both good and bad; STNG has a tendency to portray Startfleet as high tech boy scouts.",1454284800,,664,4.681034482758621

But episode by episode you get drawn in to the atmosphere of the Enterprises  space travels and confrontations with exotic cultures.

I really enjoyed the general (time-travel and alternate timeline) sci-fi themes of this episode and I think that the enjoyment is amplified by surviving the first couple of seasons.  Tasha Yarr is suddenly important and poignant, for some reason the lighting and cinematography becomes better, and there's a cool glimpse of other Federation starships (warships?) from other time periods and their technology. A lot of rare battle-scenes and existential issues from Tasha, too!",1438560000,,586,5.290322580645161

1695015,5,B000063V8R,You know all of us have to live with reality everyday. When I come home from work I enjoy casting off the cares of the day and becoming lost in a well made show involving sy-fi fantasy with a good story line. Any of the Star Trek series always do that for me. Plus it always gives me a little hope that perhaps if we don't destroy each other we may actually be able to go to the stars someday.

1695050,5,B000063V8R,Love the whole Star Trek franchise from the original series I used to watch with my grand father as kid all the way up to the new movies. I think The Next generation is my favorite though as it has a great cast that fit their characters perfectly and are not over acted like Shatner did. It is not over the top with special effects like the movies either. There is not one actor in TNG that I look at and can say.. nah that person is nothing like that character is supposed to be..  To many shows now days you watch have people playing the roles where they just don't fit who they are playing either physically or personality wise.,1434412800,,631,4.214876033057851

Each episode is interesting, and leaves me wanting to know more about the featured character. The last episode is a cliffhanger that involves the Borg.

The writers feature documentary w/ Seth McFarlane was pretty good except for McFarlane himself.

1695101,5,B000063V8R,"Season 3 is where Star Trek The Next Generation really hits its stride. This is where the show goes from ""fun sci fi reboot"" into full fledged ""Let's debate if Kirk or Picard is the better captain""

Right from the start of season 3 the whole crew just feels more cohesive, like the actors have fully gelled one another. The Dr. Pulaski experiment is over and Gates McFadden is back as Dr. Beverly Crusher. The rest of the crew just feels like a solid team. Worf is in charge of security and is the chief weapons officer (Like duh....he's a Klingon. Go with your strengths) It's all just where the series becomes a solid sci fi staple.

Episode 15 of season 2, Yesterday's Enterprise"" is where The Next Generation formally comes into it's own as a sci fi series. This is the episode where the Enterprise-C comes through a time rift that changes history. The special effects department really figured out what it was doing on this episode and it was off to the races from there out.

As for the digital presentation on the Amazon FireStick......it makes the show worth rewatching. The print is cleaned up and looks fantastic. It's not HD because the show wasn't shot in HD originally. It's still presented in a 4:3 frame (black bars on the sides of a modern widescreen TV). But it's cleaned up so it's a crisp clear image like you've never seen. Additionally the special effects have been enhanced with more modern technology available to add a sense of realism to the space scenes. This is done in a positive way, not a ""Let's make Greedo shoot first and add a bunch of CGI Banthas everywhere"" way. Nothing is really 'changed' about the special effects, just cleaned up and enhanced a bit. It's the kind of clean up that should have happened to Star Wars. So don't worry about Trek being ruined by change It's not. It's actually made better.",1429747200,,1840,4.569696969696969

Q, John de Lancie, makes an appearance or two during Season 3. Already one of the most successful reoccurring bad guys in the new series, Q plays god to humans as if they were pawns on his personal chessboard. De Lancie plays the part with such conviction viewers grew to hate him regardless if his role.

1695179,5,B000063V8R,"As I have mentioned in my previous reviews of the first and second series of STTNG on Blu-Ray, I feel somewhat reticent to repeat what has been endlessly stated (and often with such better eloquence) than what I can say, and there is virtually no aspect of the show that has not been endlessly discussed, dissected, and debated. My review here therefore will not serve to try and recover all this content, but focus primarily on the remastering aspect of the series for its release on Blu-Ray.

In short, the show has never looked better. The rescanning from the original 35mm film stock of the series, coupled with the computer- and manually-based retouching of that rescan has resulted in a production that you would swear you had never seen before. Ive commented on what I call the 80s brown that seemed to lightly layer across the entire series when it was broadcast for the first time on TV, and that, to me, in spite of the superlative effects of ILM and the obvious work put into the art and design of every aspect of the show, almost seemed to date the show right as it was broadcast. Sometimes, to me, the show screamed: This is the 1980s!

Well, thats all gone now. The rescan and remastering is so good, so well executed, and so superbly crafted that the show looks like it could have been filmed just last week, as opposed to a quarter of a century ago. Uniforms jump out at you. Detail is everywhere. Blacks are deep and rich and colors pop from amongst them. Even equipment which, obviously the product of a 1980s mindset trying to look futuristic actually do now look futuristic! And dare I repeat it: the resolution and detail is simply incredible. To watch this new release on Blu-Ray is to experience the show as never before, making it a completely new experience even for those who endlessly watched the reruns of the syndicated content in the 1980s and 1990s. Lets just say this again: this is not just some slap-happy re-release on the next fad media: this is a complete renovation of the shows appearance that is startlingly good.

A number of fans point to Season Three as one of the best, if not the best, season of the entire run. Im not sure I can say that with any certainty myself, as STTNG struck me as excellently done from beginning to end. But there is no doubt that this season has some truly amazing episodes in it. There are huge surprises in store for the watcher, and threats never before introduced at any point in the Star Trek franchise to date. There is a more relaxed use of comedy, too, and characters are further extended as both the actors and the production staff and the writers more fully understand and mold what each character represents within the show. Its a great season, one that everyone on the show was proud to produce, and it is best enjoyed only if you have been able to watch the first two seasons in order first.

The cost of these episodes, too, has come down, which makes the whole thing more feasible, and they go on sale sometimes, as well. And while I am relatively certain we are going to turn right around and see this content re-released with the 4000-line resolution technology recently introduced, this won't be for many years, and, quite frankly, the reproduction quality is now so high that we might not want to see more resolution than what we have here. So, I cant give this anything less than my highest recommendation. To watch it is to see it as though you never saw it before. There are some good bonus features, too, including lots of voice commentaries and so on, and these are great, but the real value is in the technical quality of the release, one that will be impossible to miss.  Five stars.",1423699200,,3679,4.534638554216867

There isn't much spirituality in TNG. The Star Trek that goes the most into the spirituality and beliefs of its characters is Deep Space Nine.

Episode Synopses Follow:
1. Evolution  The Enterprise is sent with an eminent physicist to investigate a stellar explosion. This is not a supernova type event but a smaller one that take place every few centuries. As the Enterprise draws near, a computer malfunction jeopardizes the experiment and the safety of the ship. One of Wesley Crushers science projects got a little bit out of hand.
2. The Survivors  The Enterprise responds to a distress call from a colony world. On arrival, the find the planet obliterated except for one small patch of green with I building and 2 survivors.

Meanwhile, Counselor Troi is greatly affected and pained by music she hears in her head. The ship, the destruction, Trois illness are all related somehow to the survivors.
3. The Ensigns of Command  The Enterprise gets a message from a hostile and reclusive race called the Shelliac. One of their planets is infested with humans. They must be removed within 4 days or they will be destroyed. The infesting humans are the descendants of a lost colony ship that went off course and they are unwilling to be moved. To make things worse, the Shelliac seem to be a race of legalistically inflexible sticklers for the letter of the treaty. The only way to make them see reason is to batter them with legalisms.
4. Who Watches the Watchers  The Enterprise sets out to help an anthropological observation station keeping tabs on some primitive proto-Vulcans. Before the ship can arrive, though, the station has a power failure that exposes their blind to some natives. The curious natives investigate leading to all sorts of Prime Directive issues when one of them is injured. Then Enterprise, without meaning to, becomes the foundation of a new religion.

The dead archeologist is survived by her young son aboard the Enterprise who is now all alone. Lt. Worf is the officer who was in command of the away team on which the death occurred and he feels the responsibility of command keenly. He wants to make amends with the young son of the archeologist. In doing so, he runs into cultural differences between the two species. The ghost makes things difficult too but is she the ghost of the dead mother or the ghost of the dead alien civilization?
6. The Enemy  The Enterprise is investigating a crash site and find the remains of a destroyed Romulan ship and a survivor in critical condition but Lt. LaForge gets separated from the away team and marooned on the inhospitable planet. An electrical storm makes finding him difficult and the Romulan patient, the Romulan rescue ship and the strange circumstances of the Romulan presence in Federation territory not to mention the other Romulan down on the surface with LaForge keep things interesting.
7. Booby Trap  The Enterprise is investigating the area of an ancient space battle where two species wiped themselves out and find an old battle cruiser that is a relic of that battle. The captain loves old ships and insists on going over to investigate himself. As he does so, The Enterprise starts having technical glitches. When the captain returns, the problems get much worse very quickly. It seems the Enterprise has stumbled into the same booby trap that killed the derelict they had discovered.
8. The Price  The Enterprise is serving a host for some delicate trade negotiations. A stable wormhole has appeared in the system of a race that otherwise has little to trade and the Federation is bidding for its use against another race when the Ferengi show up and want to put in their own bid. The most troubling thing about the negotiations is that few of the concerned parties are willing to play fair.
9. The Vengeance Factor  Some outlying posts of the Federation are having trouble with marauders. The marauders are an offshoot of a planet that finally made peace after centuries of tribal wars. They are the ones who did not want peace. Capt. Picard is trying to bring them all back together to stop the trouble. The leader of the planet from which they came is a pompous sow.  They themselves are barbaric but both sides are willing to try. They have only to learn to trust each other and root out the saboteur who wishes them to fail.
10. The Defector  A Romulan scout ship crosses the Neutral Zone headed to Federation space it is being chased by a Romulan war ship bent on its destruction. The Enterprise intercedes and saves the scout to find a defector with news of a plot that could ignite a war. One thing is apparent: the defector is not what he seems.
11. The Hunted  The Enterprise is visiting a planet which is interested in joining the Federation. While there, they learn of an escape from the local maximum security prison and lend a hand in the recapture of the prisoner. The prisoner is strange in terms of motivations and outlook. He is extremely violent yet a pacifist. As his story unfolds, it becomes apparent that his crimes are more of existence than of commission.
12. The High Ground  The Enterprise is visiting a planet with terrorist problems. The terrorists set off a bomb and Dr. Crusher tries to save the wounded. While she is doing so, she is abducted by the terrorists. The terrorists have a new weapon at their disposal but that weapon comes with a price. This is a thoughtful episode but detestable in that it serves as an excuse for terrorism.
13. Deja Q  The Enterprise is trying to stave off a catastrophe where a moon orbit is decaying and threatening a planet when Q returns. He claims to have been stripped of his powers by the Q Continuum. In an uneasy alliance, Q agrees to help the Enterprise stave off the destruction of the planet. He will do so using his knowledge but has no power to use along with it and he has to contend with species who have learned that his powers are gone and are seeking vengeance for past wrongs.
14. A Matter of Perspective  A space station blows up as the Enterprise is beaming Cmdr. Ryker back aboard. He is reticent about something that happened while there. An officer of the planet below the station then wants to take Ryker into custody on suspicion of murder. The Captain must decide whether or not to extradite Ryker to the planet below. He decides to used the holodeck to recreate the incident from each partys point of view.
15. Yesterdays Enterprise  The Enterprise encounters a mysterious cloud emitting strange radiation. All of the sudden, the Enterprise crew finds itself in an alternate reality face to face with the battle damaged Enterprise-C. Some things are similar and others are very different and only Guinan seems to be aware that all is not as it should be in this new reality. The two Enterprise crews have differing perspectives. The C crew is at war with the Romulans; the D crew is at war with the Klingons.
16. The Offspring  Data comes back from a cybernetics conference with a burning desire to be a parent so, with some of his newfound insights, he creates an android child for himself. This brings on all the frustrations of parenthood with a precocious child. More frustrating still is the attitude of a Starfleet admiral who considers Datas daughter to be property capable of expropriation.
17. Sins of the Father -  In a situation analogous to when Cmdr Ryker was seconded to a Klingon ship, a Klingon is assigned temporarily as first officer to the Enterprise. The newcomer seems intent on harassing the crew and coddling Worf to the fury of both. There is a method to his madness. He has a hidden connection to Lt. Worf. They are brothers and he bears tidings that auger ill for the entire family. Worf, as the oldest, is the only one in a position to answer the charges which bear upon the familial honor. There is skullduggery afoot and plots within plots that lead to the Klingon High Council itself.
18. Allegiance  Capt. Picard is mysteriously abducted from his quarters on the Enterprise and finds himself in an unknown location with 3 other captives. Meanwhile, a doppelganger of the captain remains on board and acts strangely, violating mission orders. The real captain with the other prisoners is intent on finding out why they have been captured and the fake one continues to act more and more strangely and even make moves on crew members. There is something strange going on and it will take the real Picard to figure it out.
19. Captains Holiday  The captain is overworked and in dire need of a vacation so the crew conspires to force him into taking one. In the grand tradition of vacations everywhere, everything that can go wrong does go wrong. Intrigue piles upon intrigue to leave the captain wishing for the deck of his starship again. The time travelers just add to the chaos.
20. Tin Man  The Enterprise is sent to investigate the possibility of a new life form that lives in space. It is utterly different from anything else known. To aid in contact, a telepathic specialist is sent. There are two problems, though. The telepath is unstable and the alien is in an area claimed by Romulans.
21. Hollow Pursuits  One of the engineering crew is not working out. Hes late, fails in too many of his assignments and generally tries to slide by with the minimum effort. Publicly, he is meek and unsure of himself but in the fantasy world of the holo-deck, he is the master of all he surveys. Ryker and LaForge want to transfer the problem child off the Enterprise but the captain wants them to train him into a valued member of the crew.
22. The Most Toys  While using a shuttle to transfer some dangerous cargo, Data is abducted and the shuttle blown up in what appears to be an accident. The kidnapper has nothing more nefarious in mind than to add Data to his collection of unique toys.
23. Sarek  The Enterprise is assigned to transport a famous ambassador to a diplomatic event. He is the stuff of history. He is Sarek, Spocks father. He is extremely old now and on his way to his final mission before retirement but there are problems. His staff seems over-protective and the ambassador is a recluse. The Enterprise crew begins to behave in a strangely aggressive manner as well.
24. Menage a Troi  There has been a big diplomatic/trade conference hosted by the Betazeds. All consider it to have been a success and even the Ferengi are satisfied but one Ferengi wants more. He has taken a liking to Counselor Trois mother and wants her. Her mother, on the other hand, is pre-occupied with getting Troi married off. The Ferengi interest is motivated by more than just lust. They assuming having a telepath handy will aid in trading and the potential for profit means they are willing to commit crimes to obtain that potential.
25. Transfigurations  While surveying a planet, the Enterprise finds a crashed escape pod with a barely alive survivor. The survivor is an alien with an unknown physiology and his condition is too critical to transport without the aid of a volunteer to be linked to him to provide support for his autonomic function. Lt. LaForge is that volunteer. After getting to the sick bay of the Enterprise, the patient recovers at a remarkable rate but has no memory prior to awaking there. Simultaneously, LaForge experiences a newfound confidence with women and others begin to experience healings in his presence. The mysterious man is plagued by energy bursts that pain and frighten him and is dreadfully afraid of being returned home. When a ship from his home world is encountered, it all begins to make sense, at least in the context of this story.
26. The Best of Both Worlds, Part I  The Enterprise investigates a distress call from a colony and finds only a vast pit where the settlement used to be. All signs point to the Borg as being the culprits and the Federation is not yet ready to handle that threat. If thats not bad enough, a tactical advisor is assigned to the Enterprise who is angling for Rykers job as first officer.  The first season cliffhanger seemed to be a drop of millimeters. The second was non-existent. This third season cliffhanger poses a drop sure to leave you queasy.",1407283200,,12619,4.7003168854685375

Maybe because the images are clearer than ever, not only do I see the two vertical seams on the front of the Star Fleet uniform and Wesley Crusher's pimples (which I never knew were there before), but I can also see more nuances in the actors' expressions.

In Sarek, the scene where Picard confronted Sarek alone, the latter was so angry and shaken, it really touched me in a deep level. Credit to Mark Lenard's heartbreaking performance, but I never felt this way before watching this episode on TV or DVD.

Definitely worth the upgrade.",1395532800,,729,4.466165413533835

1695343,5,B000063V8R,"I have noticed, if you have the patience, that all of the Star Trek TNG seasons tend to drop in price, some as low as $50, a real deal. The fact that they carried over all those great bonus features from the DVDs AND gave us new material for the blu rays is a real victory. To get better versions at cheaper prices that the original DVDs is mind blowing. It makes you want to get all the seasons, which in time, I may do. It's still $50 each. So if you want to see if this Blu Ray upgrade works for you, you can't beat Season 3 with classic like ""The Offspring,"" ""Deja Q,"" ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" and the ultimate cliffhanger ""Best of Both Worlds Pt. 1.""

These are just some awesome episodes that really defined the series, and led it to being the top-rated show in sindication for several years.  By season 3, all of the ""growing pains"" of the first two years are past.  Costumes and makeup are settled, the actors seem comfortable in their characters, Beverly Crusher is back on the 1701-D where she belongs, dialog is better, and there are some great scripts.  This season ends with Part I of ""The Best of Both Worlds.""",1387843200,,585,4.388888888888889

1695411,5,B000063V8R,"This is the season where Star Trek:TNG really took off in terms of storyline and character development.  The Blu Ray transfers seem to be pretty crisp;  I am watching on a large plasma and the colors really pop.  This is kind of remarkable considering the age of the shows (~20 years, give or take).  I would recommend waiting until this set is on sale - at least under $50, because it seems to regularly be in sale.  The only downside to this set is that they did not add in the much-anticipated Wesley death that the fans wanted.",1386374400,,531,4.377551020408164

1695413,4,B000063V8R,"I've been a fan of this show since the 1980's when it first aired.  It got a slow start - Picard was all-too wimpy, Riker was a letch, but  by season 3 the writers and cast were in their groove.  My kids glued into the re-runs and today if nothing compelling is on the tube, we'll get into Amazon Prime and pull up an episode of STTNG - Season 3 has some classic episodes.

From the DVD release, this HD version have slightly better resolution,  but the original filmed in a 4:3 aspect ratio so it will always be dated.",1385769600,,519,4.15
1695414,5,B000063V8R,Season Three is great.  What you really is that still in the 1980's people in the technical know still could not anticipate the level of technology we would find just a few decades later.  The 24th century version of tablets and touch screen computers is kind of funny compare to the things that came along just five years after the series was completed.  Also you will notice the films were high quality but still shot in old TV format and not modern wide screen which was available at the time.  It is very quaint.,1385337600,,516,4.457446808510638
1695415,5,B000063V8R,Season 3 was when TNG found it's feet in regards to character development and quality stories.  Great to see HD restoration treatment finally be completed on this season.,1385337600,,170,5.071428571428571

1695427,4,B000063V8R,"I simply love TNG. By season 3 the cast is well developed and there are far less of the ""what the..."" episodes. There is also starkly less copying of original Star Trek episodes. The show starts to hit stride here before the first of the inarguable classics - the final episode of season 3. The season finales from here on out are as good or better than the feature length films!",1385078400,,379,4.352112676056338

1695429,5,B000063V8R,"By season 3 things were really starting to click. I already have a DVD copy of all 7 seasons. But the COLOR of the Blu-Ray alone makes it worth the price, not to mention the enhanced clarity and sound.",1384214400,,201,4.17948717948718
1695430,5,B000063V8R,We are such big fans of the 'Next Generation series.  Captain Piccard & crew are so much more mellow than the cast of the original 'Star Trek' of the '60s. We always enjoy watching this newer version!!,1383868800,,201,4.4324324324324325

1695432,5,B000063V8R,"What can one say, other than...WOW! CBS Digital did an amazing job of taking Star Trek: The Next Generation into the 21st century. The picture and sound is incredible. They have kept everything original, recreating faithfully any effects that were not available from footage, or was missing. The model shots that ILM did back in the day of the Enterprise D during TNG's run are amazing. I feel there is a reason that TNG has been brought to Blu-Ray: it had the longest run of all the ""Trek"" TV series, and was the most popular show in syndication. To this day, this classic show is still being shown in reruns around the world. You have to see this show in Blu-Ray to experience it to the fullest. One of the best episodes of Season 3 was ""Sins of the Father."" This was the beginning  of a series of fantastic stories revolving around Worf, and the Klingon Empire. Another favorite was ""Deja Q"", where the infamous villain Q loses his god status, and must learn humility, and what being human is all about. And who could forget ""Yesterday's Enterprise"", with the Enterprise C coming through a time rift. That fateful episode had severe consequences in future seasons. This was just one of many examples of why TNG was such a success.",1383609600,,1233,4.6045454545454545

1695434,5,B000063V8R,"Unfortunately I am completely biased when it comes to Star Trek. I totally love everything about it and so will always give 5 stars. I have not yet had any bad experiences with the sets I have bought. I bought the ""orange faces"" boxed set this time but did notice that the ""grey boxed set"" is cheaper than the one with the orange colored faces so I will go with the grey boxed sets in the future. Price is my only motivation for doing this though.",1383264000,,447,4.209302325581396

1695454,5,B000063V8R,The Next generation has the best captain  of any Star Trek series. The cast is good as are the stories. Particularly good are stories where force will not solve a problem.  The captain's method of dealing with such problems is well worth watching.,1381708800,,247,4.72093023255814
1695455,5,B000063V8R,"What can I say, I am a trekkie and not too much can compare to TNG. While I love/like all of the different series that they have produced so far, TNG is probably the best. Acting, directing and pretty much everything about it was good. Of course not every episode is not a 10, but overall it was a great season.",1381622400,,311,4.114754098360656
1695456,5,B000063V8R,"It's Star Trek what else do you need to say. These remasterd  versions are really beautifully done. This will show your  HD system just what it is capable of.  The 5.1 soundtrack is really good. The quality of the transfers are much better than anything you have ever seen broadcast before. Buy it and be prepaired for a viewing experience. Just watch out for when Capt. Pickard looks down and the glare from his balding head. Have sunglasses ready.  Just joking. If you love Star Trek TNG, these transfers will take you where you have never been before with the whole crew.",1381622400,,574,4.598039215686274

1695473,4,B000063V8R,"This is the season where the show really found its footing.  After an OK first season, the second season really didn't get any better.  The third season writing improved dramatically.  The redesign of the uniforms, some of the sets, and the return of Dr. Crusher greatly improved the show.",1380758400,,289,4.857142857142857
1695474,5,B000063V8R,"I don't buy a lot of DVDs or Blu Rays but Star Trek TNG is that one show I can watch over and over.  I really miss a good show that has truly self-contained episodes that don't really have to be watched in a specific order or have cliff-hangers every single episode, such as Lost or 24.  This was good quality writing and for the most part, decent acting.  I'm looking forward to the later seasons.",1380672000,,398,4.2105263157894735
1695475,5,B000063V8R,"Many fans cite this as the season where TNG truly hit its stride. Not only do I agree on that sentiment, but I also believe that this is the best of all the seven seasons produced for that show. Just after two awkward seasons that went through some growing pains, and before later seasons would get too caught up on the techno-babble nonsense with A and B plots that had nothing to do with each other (""In Theory"" becoming the first of that type later in Season Four).

What makes this a very good season isn't just a very good line-up of episodes that range from solid to excellent, but that there is a much heavier emphasis on the main characters. Michael Piller stepped in as the new show runner starting this season and made an excellent point that the reason viewers tune in isn't just for some good sci-fi stories but also because of the characters. It's the camaraderie, the family of characters that viewers want to see grow and deal with a situation in their own unique way. Episodes like ""The Bonding"" that really get into characters, see what makes them tick. It's this emphasis that began in the second season with episodes like ""The Measure of a Man"", but never has it been done better than in the third season, which even brings back Tasha Yar for one more episode to give her the best treatment she ever had on the show.

As for the blu-ray discs themselves, they're excellent. The new features do a great job of getting behind the scenes on what really drove the season into becoming the classic that fans hold dearly. To get an even more unique sense of the family bond between the cast, the gag reel is a highlight. For any Trek fan, this is a must have. If you can only pick one season to purchase for TNG, this is it right here.",1379980800,,1748,4.3919753086419755

Add onto that all the past DVD special features plus new Bluray content and a price well below the old DVD season sets and they just got it right all around this time.... only would have like more commentaries.

If you have a blu-ray player with HI-DEF tv then you should think about purchasing these sets.  If nothing else rent one and see for yourself.  If you love this show like I do you will find it hard not to want to replace your old DVD's.  The series didn't even look this good when it first aired!

Colors are more vibrant and true to life and the extra features are a very welcome addition.  It seems that even all of the previous DVD special features were all preserved, as well.

If I had to come up with a complaint at all, I would say that I'd love to hear more commentaries.  If each episode had a director's commentary, I'd be in heaven.  But, this not being a perfect world, I will not dock it any stars because of this fantasy.  :~)",1374883200,3,719,4.313432835820896

- Typically 4 Episodes per CD, with Episode number/name on them individually.
- Menu interface is well organized and very well done (i.e.options, scene selection, episodes have auto-playing mini-clips above their titles)

I'm very happy with this product and recommend it to anyone looking to complete their collection. I took a gamble buying the full set of this version, but I found it was truly worth it. Did I mention I love this show? I tend to forget the show was filmed in the 80's and early 90's. A lot of love&talent went into this show, not just from the actors/actresses, but the sets, sfx, costumes, and the incredible writers.

The third season of STNG is one of my favorites. There are so many good episodes. The blu-ray image quality is so far above the DVD's that I notice odd things.

You can see details you never knew were there! That's not always a good thing, on some episodes, like in the first season, you can clearly see the stunt doubles. You can also see the makeup lines on some of the aliens. This in no way makes the show any less enjoyable. One thing I was very impressed with was the remastered special effects. They ""blend in"" great with the show. I was worried that it would be painfully obvious that the special effects were done this year yet the show was filmed in the late 1980's-early 1990's.

It's amazing how much they improved the original image quality! Where the enhancements really shine is in the space special effects. They didn't just clean it up, they added detail to improve upon what was and bring it up-to-date. For example, planets which had originally been featureless now have topography and atmospheres and moons and rings, etc... planetary rings! There was one episode where I noticed that not only did the planet now have a rings, but the Enterprise cast a shadow on the ring that moved with the Enterprise as it orbited! How cool is that?! That's a small detail and they didn't need to do that, but they did, and it was cool! There's lots of little improvements like that - and bigger improvements as well. Does the on-ship sets & tech still look a bit dated? Of course; the show ran from '87-'94 and there's only so much they could do, but they did everything they could and it looks great.",1372204800,2,964,4.514285714285714

1695610,4,B000063V8R,"I've purchased all the Next Generation blu-ray sets so far and have yet to be disappointed.  I'll skip the review of the actual show; we all know that season 3 is when Next Gen really hit it's stride and became the show we love, so why rehash that?  The episodes look and sound fantastic, new details that you never noticed before, and there are several episodes that feature multiple commentary tracks.  All the previous DVD extras seem to be here, and the new content is (inter)stellar.

First off one of the most anticipated features for me was the inclusion of the footage featuring little person David Rappaport in the episode ""The Most Toys"".  The actor tried to commit suicide while filming the episode and was replaced by Saul Rubineck.  I was always curious about how the episode would have been, but frankly (with all respect for the dead) Saul's performance is simply better than Rappaport's, and it is very apparent in hindsight that David is having personal issues as his performance isn't at the top of his game.  Still it's great that is was included and is  very interesting to see.

This season set was pushed as ""the writer's set"" with most of the new extras dealing with the show's incredible writing staff.  We get an hour long round table discussion with the writing staff hosted by Family Guy's Seth McFarlane.  I hope we see more of these s this was truly enjoyable.  It's a very informal talk about the season and it's just a treat filled with great trivia (they almost killed Will Riker off?!?!?!).  The other extras also go in depth into the season with the actors, with plenty of trivia, anecdotes and discussion.  A long gag reel is included again, and while I LOVE the fact that each season is getting a season specific gag reel this one is fairly light on the laughs and is not one of the better ones.  But just the fact that it's included is awesome.

Ok, so why only 4 stars out of 5, you ask?  Very simple.  On the same day this set was released there was also another Next Generation release.  The Season 3 cliffhanger finale and it's Season 4 conclusion were released as a re-edited ""movie"" on a separate blu ray, ""Star Trek: The Next Generation; The Best of Both Worlds"".  This release has it's own set of extras, a gag reel from that episode, etc.  These extras go into detail on what is arguably one of the most well known episodes/cliffhangers EVER, and NONE of these features are included in the Season 3 blu-ray set, so if you want them you have to buy a totally separate blu-ray of an episode YOU NOW ALREADY HAVE to get the extra features.  This comes off as a pathetic cash-grab and I strongly hope that CBS rectifies this by including these features on the Season 4 set.  It may seem like not that big of a deal, but when I purchase the pricey box set of a season I already owned on DVD and it's not 'complete' I find that very irritating.  Oh well.

That major issue aside, this is a great set overall, just remember that it is NOT complete.  ;-)",1371254400,,2992,4.474169741697417

A real easy way to descibe the picture. I was eating breakfast with my 12 year old yesterday and one of the TNG episodes (Sarek, happens to be in season 3) was on TV. Off hand, he commented that it looked really bad and it didn't have a lot of detail compared to the BLURAY version I had bought.

Pros-
The episodes are so beautiful, it's like watching them for the first time.  The sound is great on my 5.1 audio system, and the visual effects are stunning!  It's great to see the Enterprise D in such gorgeous detail. All the planets look real, and not just like blurry land masses covered by wisps of atmosphere.  All the alien ships show detail that only the model builders themselves ever got to see before.  Totally awesome, and a must buy for any fan of the show.

Con-
If I had to find something negative to say about this set it's this; Bare bones labeling on the discs.  On my previous DVDs form all the Trek series, each disc had a list of what episodes are on it.  Makes sense when looking for a particular episode.  Not so here.  The discs only give season and disc number, and in order to find what disc the episode you're looking for is on you have to physically remove the paper insert from around the outside of the case which has the episodes listed on the inside!  Ridiculous!  Bad enough not to have labels, but not even to list the episodes on the back of the case, or on an insert inside and in easy view is beyond silly, it is in fact moronic.  The show itself is excellent :)

Bottom line-
Buy this set.",1369872000,2,1320,4.270161290322581

1695663,5,B000063V8R,"When Star Trek: The Next Generation entered its third season, it was in trouble. The critical reception to the show's second year had been mixed, producer and effective showrunner (under Rick Berman) Maurice Hurley had left and the cast were unhappy with the removal of Gates McFadden as Dr. Beverly Crusher. As the third season opened, Rick Berman had to hire a largely new writing team, a new showrunner and had to bring back McFadden to appease the rest of the cast (particularly Patrick Stewart). Fortunately for his show and for the fans, Berman was lucky. The new showrunner was the talented Michael Piller and amongst the new writers were the young and energetic Ira Steven Behr, Rene Echeverria and Ronald D. Moore, all of whom would go on to define Star Trek for many years to come.

Because of these changes, Season 3 was produced in a state of chaos. Scripts were being completed mere days before filming, leaving little time for pre-production. This can be seen in the reduced amount of location filming this season, with almost no time to book location shoots ahead of filming. However, there's a noticeable improvement in special effects thanks to the introduction of new, smaller and easier-to-shoot filming models of both the Enterprise and the Romulan warbird (which makes several appearances). New, considerably more comfortable uniforms are also introduced, to the evident comfort and relief of the actors.

But what really makes the season work is the superior writing. Piller was keen to introduce more scenes of character interaction and development to the show. The guest cast are moved away from being the centre of the show, with their impact on the regular characters being more important. There's more continuity, with a recurring Romulan threat throughout the season (The Enemy, The Defector, Tin Man) and Worf's Klingon background being developed more thoroughly (Sins of the Father). Having been proven to be a sentient being in Season 2's excellent The Measure of a Man, Data's evolution continues through several episodes before peaking in The Offspring, where he tries to build a new android 'daughter'. Comedy is allowed freer reign, particularly in Deja Q, Captain's Holiday and Menage a Troi, which all feature a few good laughs (Deja Q may be the funniest episode the show ever did).

But the third season's strong reputation relies on its two absolute stand-out, inarguably, stone-cold classics. Yesterday's Enterprise is a time travel story involving parallel universes which remains fully comprehensible, features one of the best space battles the show ever did and finds an intelligent and non-cheesy way of bringing back Tasha Yar. The writing is strong, with lots of moments of subtlety (the alternate Riker and Picard don't get on) and some impressive production values and details, such as the revamping of the Enterprise bridge.

At the end of the season we also get The Best of Both Worlds, the show's first season cliffhanger and still the best one Star Trek's ever done. The return of the Borg, the outstanding music, the character interplay between Riker and newcomer Shelby, the effects and the doom-laden, hopeless atmosphere combine to make for one of the franchise's finest hours.

Conversely, there are only a few weak moments in the mix. The Price, The Vengeance Factor and The Most Toys are quite dull, whilst The High Ground is a commentary on the Northern Ireland Troubles which misfires completely due to the writers' poor understanding of that conflict. Who Watches the Watchers? sabotages a good premise and some excellent Enterprise scenes with some dull guest cast performances. But it's more surprising how good the show has become compared to the first two seasons, with even minor episodes like The Survivors and The Hunted coming to life and being enjoyable in a way the smaller stand-alones of the first two years struggled with.

On a technical basis, the HD upscaling of the show is again amazing, with the same team that handled Season 1 doing the job. That means some more beautiful 3D planet renders, some outstanding effects recreations and superior reproductions of the show's colours (Season 3 is more colourful than the first two seasons). After the slightly disappointing Season 2 upgrade (the company responsible for that is not being re-used, interestingly), the S3 update is even more astonishing. For a season that was driven so much by writing changes, the extra features do a great job of focusing on the writing team and how they went about creating the best show possible and avoiding the mistakes of the first two years.

Ultimately, the third season of Star Trek: The Next Generation (*****) is outstanding. The writers, actors and crew are all on the top of their game, dragging the so-so show of the first two seasons up in quality to become something truly impressive. The season is available now in the UK and USA.",1368230400,8,4907,5.020884520884521

This did not happen if I let the credits play out fully. A minor annoyance, perhaps, but, given the cost of the package, I expected a debugged product. Maybe they got in a hurry.

Still, criticisms can be leveled at the high price point, which is the only thing giving me pause about this collection.

1695690,5,B000063V8R,"I'll never forget being at a friends house when they told me they wanted to watch Star Trek TNG before we head out to the bar . I was a huge fan of the original series and of the movies . I had seen about 8 episodes of TNG before this night and was unimpressed . We did not know that this nights episode was the season ending cliffhanger ""The Best Of Both Worlds"" pt 1 . Wow ! I was hooked and could not wait til the next season . Over the summer I watched the reruns of season 3 . At first I felt that some of the episodes were a little dull , but I found myself getting to like the characters , just like in the original series . Then I really began to like the show . After seeing the episode ""Yesterdays Enterprise"" I new this series could end up being as good as the original series . The creators found their mojo . Season 4 began the following season and it was one great episode after another until the series ended . Is TNG better that the original crew ? WHO CARES ! To be able to create two outstanding series based on the Enterprise is truely an amazing achievement . The bluray edition is wonderful . Since I already own season 3 on dvd I can tell you the picture quality is Improved . As with the dvd , picture quality varies and sometimes within the same episode . The new DTS Master Audio is fantastic . One thing I always like about the audio is the engine hum you hear whenever they are on the Enterprise . It's just one of those little things that make it seem more believable .The DTS mix is about the same as the dvd as far as channel seperation is concerned , but the audio has more impact on the bluray . Looking back I can't believe this show almost got past me . But then again , I was also a late-comer to ""Lost"" and ""Seinfeld"" .

1695691,5,B000063V8R,"In Season Three of The Next Generation you can tell everyone hit their strides, the actors, the producers, the writers, the directors, everyone.  The storytelling in the third season is so rich,the characters became consistent, and the infusion of more drama and comedy made it feel so much more alive than the first and second seasons.

The number of standout episodes in the third season is staggering.  Brent Spiner stood out this season.  His work in ""The Offspring"" took Data to a whole new level.  I also enjoyed ""Deja Q"" because Data gets to laugh.  ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" is an obvious winner, as were ""Sarek,"" ""Sins of the Father,"" and ""The Enemy.""  I really can't think of an episode from the third season that I just didn't like.

As with the first two blu ray season sets, the VAM (or extras) on this set are spectacular.  Seth MacFarlane's conversion with Ron Moore, Naren Shankar, Rene Echevarria and Brannon Braga (Inside the Writer's Room) was engaging to watch.  It was nice to get the writers' perspectives on what worked and didn't work, series rules they had to follow.  The other interesting aspect of that documentary from a fan's point-of-view, is to get perspectives and insights of people who were just as involved as the actors that we never saw.  The other documentary, the three part ""Regeneration,"" is informative and full of new information.  Some of the commentary on the three-part documentary is very frank ... many of the people interviewed really speak their mind about what was going on and what they thought.  I found the tribute to Michael Piller very touching.  I wonder if Season Five will have a tribute to Gene ...

The picture quality is top notch.  To those who complain about the MSRP of $130 per season set ... Amazon has never charged anywhere close to that much.  Season Four is currently for sale for $90, just like the first three when they were made available to pre-order.  If you wait to pre-order, you will likely be able to pre-order close to the release date for about $77 (which is what I pre-ordered Season Three for), and then Amazon will refund your card the difference.  Season Three was priced on release day at $59.99 (that was yesterday), I already have the refund on my card.  $59.99 is not unreasonable when you consider the amount of painstaking (and expensive) work that goes into remastering TNG into HD.  As for the newly produced bonus material ... producing these documentaries and reunions and new interviews is also not a cheap endeavor, and to put it into perspective ... when TNG first came to DVD in (I think) 2002, maybe it was late 2001 (?) those season sets cost about $120 per set and there was no deep discount for them.  Back then you paid MSRP if you wanted them.  TV on DvD was a relatively new concept.

That said, these sets are not for casual fans.  Casual fans or new fans really aren't going to get much out of these newly recorded interviews, reunions and documentaries.  If you are a casual fan I would simply suggest watching them in HD on Amazon Prime after the Blus come out.  You can watch the whole series but they will only broadcast in HD the seasons that are actually available in HD.  I love my Netflix membership, and I'm grateful Netflix carries all the Trek series but the picture and audio quality for Trek on Netflix is bad.

If you want to experience Trek in true HD, if you want and enjoy all of the newly recorded and newly found bonus material, then buy these sets.  They are well worth the price.",1367366400,4,3509,4.6294498381877025
1695692,5,B000063V8R,"This review is in response to those giving this product one star for being too expensive:

I got my set today and have watched three episodes so far.  Even though I already own the first two seasons in Blu-Ray, I'm still totally blown away by the quality of the picture.  It is just amazing to see such a clear image and vibrant colors and updated special efx.

Things I've noticed so far that I could not have noticed from the regular DVD's : In the first few episodes Wil Wheaton has some really bad acne problems going on and every tiny little mole and pimple show up amazingly clear (okay so that's NOT so awesome, but it's there), I've noticed a smudge of eyeliner under Dr. Crusher's eye for an entire scene, a dirt stain on the Captain's sleeve, but my favorite thing to do is to pause the playback when they show computer text on the LCARS screen.  You could never read what the designers wrote until now, and let me tell you, they had a really warped sense of humor.  I was actually laughing out loud at some of the things they wrote in ""Ensigns of Command"" for the Sheliac Treaty.  I won't spoil it, you'll have to discover it yourself.

And finally, along with the hi-def bloopers, we finally get to see footage of David Rappaport as the original Kivas Fajo in ""The Most Toys"".  Again, that alone is worth the price of admission, a very rare (albeit sad) treat for TNG fans.

I don't have a lot of money, I'm out of work on disability and have to make every penny count.  But I can tell you I would have gladly paid more for this set of episodes, and I can't wait until the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th seasons to come out.  I'll never get tired of watching TNG in this format, it's truly beautiful work they've done in putting all this together!

EDIT: You know I just realized something that some of you might already have figured out, ALL of the 1 star reviews, with the exception of one (so far) are not even reviews for the Blu-ray set!!!
If you look carefully at the sub-headings, you'll see that all those reviews are either for the DVD or for ONE episode from Amazon's Instant Video!  These reviewers were reviewing the right thing but AMAZON lumped those reviews together with the Blu-Ray reviews.  So I have no doubt that when a person reported poor quality video while trying to stream one of these episodes, if you don't look closely enough you won't even realize they are not talking about the Blu-ray set.

NOTE TO AMAZON:  Could you please do a better job of organizing these reviews.  You are putting these 1 star reviews mixed in to this product that are not even meant to be here!",1367280000,32,2602,4.374220374220374
1695693,5,B000063V8R,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" truly hit its stride with the third season. With the addition of Ron Moore and others to the writing staff, the third season flew into uncharted territories with a series of strong stories, acting, direction, performances and episodes that dealt with morally complex issues such as terrorism, the definition of humanity and even an echo of Rashmon in one episode.

The transfer done by CBS here is nothing short of exceptional. I did note some minor issues in two shots of ""The Hunted"" but that is the only episode so far in the set. Occasionally, some close ups are a bit soft but I suspect that has to do with the photography of the show for those shots.

There is one shot uprezzed from the original videotape for ""The Survivors"" as the elements couldn't be found.

The show finally settled on a film stock that would provide nice, sharp and vivid detail without the excessive grain of the first two seasons. That, along with a new director of photography, allowed the look of the show to be both distinctive, textured and rich something that wasn't as evident on the original DVDs or the original broadcast of the show.

The restoration team has managed to find that fine balance between the darker textures of the show and bold colors of the show. The visual effects look top notch throughout and where the effects team that worked on the restoration for the planets, there's an astonishing level of detail.

As with the first two seasons subtitles are provided in English and other multiple langauges and the menu allows you to select from many langauges as well for the show itself.

The special features include a commentary on ""The Bonding"" by Ronald D. Moore, Michael and Denise Okuda; ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" by Ronald D. Moore, Ira Steven Behr, Michael & Denise Okuda plus another commentary track by director David Carson; ""The Offspring"" commentary by Rene Echevarria, Michael & Denise Okuda; ""Sins of the Father"" commentary by Ronald D. Moore, Dan Curry, Michael & Denise Okuda. We also get a number of terrific featurettes including ""Inside the Writer's Room"" moderated by Seth McFarlane and a three part documentary entitled ""Assimiliating Star Trek: The Next Generation"" both in HD. There are also tributes to the late writer Michael Piller, the scenes shot with the late David Rappaport for the episode ""The Most Toys"". We also get all the original episode promos as well as the special features from the original DVD sets.

CBS has done a terrific job with this set making up for some of the shortcomings evident in the season two Blu-rays (and, despite those shortcomings, the season two set is still worth picking up)and the quality of this set continues to bode well for the rest of the sets in this set.

Highly recommended.",1367280000,9,2782,4.829831932773109

By now, the crew has formed a noticeable camaraderie. This is science fiction at its finest with unique characters, exceptional stories, and great special effects for its time. I loved experiencing these adventures again, restored on blu ray. I received this season for review, but enjoyed so much that I had to go out and buy the previous seasons on blu ray as well. My favorite new addition was the featurette ""Inside The Writer's Room"" moderated by Seth MacFarlane. And of course, I can't get enough of gag reels.

1695695,1,B000063V8R,"Before anything, I need to acknowledge that I do not own, nor have I viewed, this product, nor any other TNG season on DVD or Blu-Ray.

I am writing this review as somebody that recently watched this show from beginning to end on Netflix, where the entire series is available for streaming for any and all Netflix subscribers, I find it jaw-droppingly insane that each season of this show has a retail price of $130.  Currently, this season is on sale, at 70% off, to bring the price down to $60.  That is STILL insane.

The pricing for this product is absurd, toxic, and unnecessary.  If one were to buy the entire series at this 70% off sale price, it would be $360, though that is impossible; as of about halfway through 2013, this show is less than less than halfway available on disc.  At retail, purchasing the series on Blu-Ray would cost $910 plus tax.  That is MADNESS when ANYBODY with an internet connection could watch the -entire- show for a subscription costing about $8 a month.

I love this show completely and utterly.  It's an amazing monument to human imagination.  But anybody that purchases any season of this show at this price point, no offense, should seriously look into several bridges that I'm selling.",1367193600,7,1229,4.648148148148148
1695696,5,B000063V8R,"Already one of my favorite Star Trek series, season 3 reaches ""new heights"".  Every episode has depth, intensity and even a bit of humor.  The season culminates with an unforgettable encounter with the Borg--a must see!",1367107200,,219,5.055555555555555
1695697,5,B000063V8R,Arguably the best season of the whole series. The Best of Both Worlds is rated among the top cliffhanger episodes on tv of all time.,1367107200,,132,4.32
1695698,1,B000063V8R,"I have been ordering the new Blu Rays as they are released, and I will continue to do so.  The upgraded picture quality is fantastic and the value added material bonus features make it worth it.  Here's what I don't understand about these newly repackaged DVDs.  I appreciate the new artistic rendering on the packaging, but why are they over $50?  The Blu Rays are supposed to retail for $119 per set, but they are never that much.  They're usually around $60 on release day and rarely over $80 at any other time.  Why would anyone spend over $50 for these newly repackaged DVDs when they could get the Blu Rays jammed packed with new bonus features for not much more?

If they really want to market the re-released DVDs to people who don't much care for Blu Ray, or for people who don't have a Blu Ray player, why not lower these DVD sets to something reasonable like $25-$30 per season?",1367020800,8,889,4.450617283950617

Not only are the stories uniquely STNG, the photography is colorful and richer. The promos for the set show amazing detail. This will undoubtedly be one of the best Bluray releases of the year!",1366416000,2,358,4.698412698412699

1695704,5,B000063V8R,"I watched this series when they first came out and loved them dearly.  Now, I am sharing them with my teenage son, and he is really enjoying them also.  Good, clean, inventive fun!  I am fond of all the Star Trek programs, but The Next Generation is my favorite.  It has so many really well-developed and interesting characters.  Watching them interact together, facing interesting and unusual, often very difficult challenges, and overcoming them using courage, ingenuity, and persistence is rewarding.  These programs offer good discussion starters for big picture ideas, morals, and themes that foster relevant and helpful discussion with developing young people.  This series provides great entertainment and valuable bonding time with my son.  I recommend it for kids 10+ (or younger depending on your kid).  Some situations and aliens might seem scary to the very young.",1365897600,2,876,5.2898550724637685

1695789,5,B000063V8R,"The basic premise is that some humanoid is found under wreckage on some generic planet, and Dr. Crusher and her awesome medical team save his life. Interestingly enough, this alien is a total nice person, but has no memory. Details emerge from the crew's investigation that include evidence of a battle, and that he was running away from something. Further, clues are dropped that his entire being is slowly undergoing a change (a painful one at that). Aside from his incredibly fast recovery abilities, this alien also has the ability to heal others! But it isn't only physical healing, he also is able to heal things such as a lack of self-confidence, as in the case of Geordi. (As this was going on, I could not help but feel the writers took an inspiration from a certain famous character from the Bible's New Testament.)

Well, the story goes on, and the crew takes a liking to this fellow, but Picard of course, has to protect his crew and ship. This is apparent when the alien's pursuers show up and threaten battle with the Enterprise if they do not hand over John Doe (as the crew has come to know him). Sure enough, at the last possible moment, John, the alien, remembers what he was about all along--he was undergoing a metamorphosis that his species undergo, but their government had been oppressing for generations. John undergoes his metamorphosis, and turns into a creature of light (again, a Bible reference?), and he totally shows his enormous power and prevents any further conflict between the two species. Picard, and the crew, are amazed at this metamorphosis, and John goes on his way. I think the title of the episode gives away the source of inspiration for this episode.

Despite any possible inferences of the source material, this is a well done episode where the crew's humanity shows through, even in the presence of all the fabulous technology. And of course, the concepts of healing, and allowing change are explored. Good pacing, good acting, and wonderful moments with worth and Geordi. However, some of the writer's moments (like in the opening sequence) I found my eyes rolling and questioning the logic of it, but not anything major to at all distract the enjoyment of this solid episode.",1348099200,,2224,4.804177545691906

My siblings and some of my husband's  siblings grew up with the Original Star Trek. I believe this STNG series are just as 'fascinating' as the old ones.  The characters are very well played by the actors and really seemed to enjoy their parts. We are collecting all seven seasons if possible; they are that good!

1695791,3,B000063V8R,"This episode raises a few interesting questions and serves as an allegory for veterans. While it was interesting watching the prisoner run around the Enterprise and the crew largely unable to capture him, I kept thinking to myself ""with all that technology, they can't apprehend this guy on their own ship?"". There were a few moments as well when I was thinking ""ok, what's the point"". But again, we see Picard's humanity appear, as he clearly asserts his authority to reject the planet's request for Federation membership based on the fact that veterans of a war have been cast off inhumanely.

Interesting episode overall.",1346457600,2,624,5.0
1695792,5,B000063V8R,"The premise of the episode is that Picard is kidnapped and replaced with an identical impostor on the ship. No one seems to notice the impostor, but this Picard's unusual behaviors such as singing a beer song with the crew starts some eyebrow-raising. Meanwhile, the real Picard is held prisoner in a holding cell that includes a member of a non-violent species, a member of an anarchist species, and a Starfleet cadet. As expected, Picard does not accept his conditions and leads his fellow inmates in attempts to discover a way out. As the impostor's behaviors progress in unusual manners, the senior officers begin to talk mutiny. This goes on for almost the entire episode, leaving the viewer very engaged as to what will happen next.

Ultimately, the real Picard figures out that the Starfleet cadet in the captivity room is in fact one of the captors. It is then revealed that the 3 captives were being studied so that the aliens can learn about leadership under stress. Picard is finally returned to his ship. It is at this moment that the episode has a satisfying conclusion: Picard outsmarts the alien captors and actually locks them up in a force field. He then lectures to them a bit, and then releases them with a sturdy ""Now, get off my ship!"".

Themes explored include the question, ""can all of a mind's memories and experiences be copied into a perfect replica of the person and expect that person to act as usual?"" Command and leadership are also explored. Interesting to watch is a slightly different version of Picard at work (more lighthearted and apparently affectionate). Great episode!",1345075200,,1607,4.84

This is a fantastic episode! Could have easily been a two parter. The most exciting battle scene so far in the series up to this point. Even young Wesley Crusher who is a full ensign here does an awesome job at the helm. I can't get enough of Geordi yelling ""Coolant leak! Coolant Leak! Anti-matter containment critical, warp core breach imminent!"" The supporting guest stars from the other enterprise did a spectacular job, the other captain in particular, her actions were indeed honorable. But most importantly this episode is the one that gives Tasha Yar an honorable farewell, instead of being killed off senselessly by an evil garbage bag monster earlier in the series. Memorable quotes from this episode include the title of this review and when picard shouts ""not good enough dammit! not good enough!"" I remember watching as a kid and that line has always stuck with me, Patrick Steward's acting chops are very impressive indeed.

1695813,4,B000063V8R,"Here it is! The breakthrough season of The Next Generation. With the addition of collars, all of the officer's now look like they're in adult outfits. Crusher's back with an incredibly absurd hair cut (didn't she learn from the one thing Wesley does right?) The shows music heads in a completely new direction - from synthesized dreck to more ambient and tonal accents.

Most importantly the writing moves from space viruses and aliens of the week to more personal character driven stories. This season contains some of the best episodes in all seven, including The Best of Both Worlds and Yesterday's Enterprise. In fact this may be the best season of all seven - even more hilarious as, due to the writers strike that caused a shorten second season and birthed a clip show, the writers had virtually no episodes written.

Does that mean it's totally devoid of suck? Well...perhaps on the level on the first two seasons, yes. Still, there are a few episodes interspersed in Season 3 that really don't add much by way of character development or mythology, or are just plain awful.

My purpose in writing is to speed someone right to the meat and potatoes of the series. I've marked the bad episodes that lack any details about the overall series mythology ""skip"" - the one-offs that aren't necessarily great but might be worth coming back to ""skippable"" - episodes that are good or contain required information about the series mythology, ""watch"" - and the episodes that would be great in any season ""must watch.""

Evolution - Skippable - That darned Wesley falls asleep at his desk while experimenting with microscopic robots called nanites. Instead of eating him they escape and start eating the ships computer. Crusher returns for some nice exchanges between her and Picard. The writing is solid (except for the term ""food slot"" - hadn't we already coined the term ""replicator"" by now?) Still, this episode is unusual in that it is mostly about the guest star rather than any of the crew, in this case Doctor Paul Stubbs, the astrophysicist whose one chance at greatness is being ruined by the nanites. There are better episodes beyond.

The Ensigns of Command - Watch - The crew is contacted by a reclusive race that is colonizing a planet now inhabited by descendants of a lost group of human explorers. Because of radiation on the planet the only person who can beam down is Data. A few common series cliches crop up here including female characters who find Data's childlike obliviousness sexy, as well as stubborn inhabitants of a planet that don't seem to realize: THEY'RE IN THE FUTURE. Everyone can vaporize you from space. Still, this is a pretty good episode in which Data's character grows a layer or two.

The Survivors - Skippable - A mystery episode. The crew answers a distress call from a federation colony to find the surface of the planet completely obliterated except for a house on a tiny patch of land. Inside is an elderly couple that refuses to leave despite the barren planet. Meanwhile Troi starts being driven mad by music...and so will you. If not by the music then by Deanna's relentless screaming and crying. It's not a terrible episode by any means except for the taxing requirements placed on Deanna's acting ability. There is a wonderfully chilling moment at the end of the episode when we discover what it is the couple has been hiding, but once you know the secret the episode isn't worth much beyond the final five minutes.

Who Watches The Watchers - Watch - A group of scientist are studying a race of bronze age proto-vulcan's when the holographic generator that keeps them hidden from the natives malfunctions. Leland Palmer, one of the proto-vulcans, is injured and in a stupor, sees the Captain and crew saving him. When he comes-to again on the planet he starts a new religion worshipping his god, ""The Picard."" This is a fascinating episode in which the show reveals itself to be almost overtly atheist, or at least anti-religious. In an effort to reverse the damage done by their exposure Picard spends an afternoon giving one of the proto-vulcans a tour of the ship culminating in a wonderful scene where he demonstrates to her how any technology sufficiently advanced enough is indistinguishable from magic.

The Bonding - SKIP - If you thought that what the show needed was a fresh infusion of child acting than here is your episode! A redshirt member of an away team dies on a mission. While getting counseled through the loss by Deanna, the away member's son starts to get visits from his deceased Mom. It's not a TERRIBLE episode by any means and there are some nice scenes where Worf, a fellow orphan, tries to reach out to the child. Gabriel Damon, the son, doesn't do an awful job but doesn't really have the acting chops to carry this heavy material. In general, the episode suffers from the same problem most of the other episodes have that focus on a guest star character: it's just not all that interesting.

Booby Trap - Watch - This a is mythology episode referenced later. The Enterprise is cataloging the ruins of a planet that was the final battle of two species over a thousand years. The crew happens upon one of their battleships in pristine condition, at the same time fall into the same energy sapping booby trap the crew of the ancient vessel did. To help him figure out a way to escape Geordi recreates one of the Enterprise Warp Drive designers on the holodeck, Dr. Leah Brahams, and becomes attached to her. It's a nice character building episode for Geordi and lingers a lot building chemistry between the crew members. It's a joy to watch Picard's glee over getting to live out a boyhood fantasy he had while building ships in bottles. The ""relationships on the holodeck"" theme had been touched on earlier in 11001001 where Riker met Minuet - but unlike where Riker lingered bizarrely over his digital date here the results are much more believable when Geordi realizes his infatuation and decides to step away.

The Enemy - Watch -  Geordi finds himself marooned on a planet, the captive of an injured Romulan named Bochra. The planet plays hell with their different physiologies, blinding Geordi and paralyzing Bochra. As the episode progresses, Geordi, who has the means to save them both, eventually earns Bochra's trust and willingness to see through mutual hatred. For the most part, antagonists in Star Trek episodes are lacking in complexity. Their evilness tends to lack motivation as they're in the story simply to provide conflict. This episode contains both. The scenes between are convincing exchanges between two people whose dislike is based on systematic cultural propaganda and not each other. However, on the bridge the more prototypical Star Trek conflict is occurring between Picard and the one-armed-Romulan, Admiral Tomalok. Tomolak is the stock xenophobic Star Trek adversary, lying at all times, unreasonable, and reckless - a contrast to Patrick Stewart's measured and even-handed Picard. The nicest bit in the entire episode though occurs with Worf's refusal to donate some mojo in his cells that could save a second Romulan dying in sick bay. Despite numerous pleas from different crew members the writers don't sell Worf out and have him see the error of his ways. Instead Worf refuses and we learn something about his character. The Enemy is a nice episode breaking a bunch of new and interesting ground with only a few of the nagging problems of the first two seasons.

The Price - Skip - The Enterprise hosts a group of alien's negotiating for the rights to a stable wormhole. One of the negotiators, Devinoni Rall, who has an uncanny knack what he does, begins negotiating his way into Troi's pants. After Troi lets herself be seduced in several creepy scenes of spectacularly bad chemistry, she finds out that Rall is actually half Betazed too. This presents her the ""complicated"" choice of having to protect the creepy unethical negotiator she's now sleeping with or do her job. Simply a bad episode, not a terrible one. Wesley is barely around, Lwaxanna never appears, and Troi never has to cry. Still, it's a shame that often times the writer's only ideas for what to do with a Troi-centric episode in these early seasons is to have her be romanced...badly. The prelude to this cringe-worthy romance between Devin and Troi consists of him coming to her office and within 30 seconds running his hand on her arm and messing up her hair. When I tried that at my last job I ended up unemployed and writing episode guides for 17 year old television shows. WTF Star Trek? You lied to me! (side note: technically this is a mythology episode. There's a scene where two Ferengi get marooned in the Delta Quadrant. They return later in an episode of Voyager. I'm still giving this one a pass though.)

The Vengeance Factor - Skippable - The crew is negotiating a peace between a species with butts on their heads and marauders they cast out a hundred years before. The marauders, who look like members of The Kiss Army, are starting to show up dead and one of the servants of the negotiators is the cause. Just kind of a dull episode with a nice premise buried beneath a convoluted setup: The servant in question, Yuta, is a 100 year old genetically altered assassin whose entire life has been about killing. That might have been an interesting premise with implications about personal identity and self-determination. Instead it takes twenty minutes of exposition about this species before we even realize that Yuta matters to the plot at all. There's a nice scene toward the end when Riker confronts her but it isn't worth sitting through the entire thing.

The Defector - Skippable - The Enterprise receives a distress call from inside the Romulan neutral zone and comes to the aid of defecting Romulan, Admiral Ja'Rok. Ja'Rok says he has information about a Romulan base in the neutral zone intended to be the spearhead to an invasion. The crew must try to figure out if he's telling the truth. This is another episode focused on someone other than a primary cast member however in this case, thanks to a quality performance by James Sloyan, this one is actually pretty good. In a Romulan-centric season Sloyan brings some diversity to the Federation enemy by playing Ja'Rok as a patriotic countryman who sacrifices everything for what he believes to be the greater good. In his jousts with Picard we see two men who want to trust each other but are too worn by years of cultural hatred. It's all enjoyable and the episode teases some epic-ness-ness but ultimately doesn't go very far, ending up a small blip in the series. A good one to circle back to if you find yourself addicted. One thing that starts to irk me at this point in the series: Why in all the universe is the One-Armed-Romulan the only one the Enterprise always seems to run into?

The Hunted - Skippable - While considering a planet's application for entrance into the Federation, the Enterprise becomes involved in the recovery of one of their escaped prisoners. Troi senses he may be more than he seems. Her discovery leads to the Enterprise being embroiled in a conflict between a society and it's cast offs from war. Kind of. James Cromwell (Zerphram Cocrane) plays the Prime Minister of the planet seeking Federation entrance and, while it's nice to see him there isn't a lot for him to do with this part. For the most part the writing in this one is a little misdirected. The action in the story is centered around the prisoner, Roga Danar, running rampant through the ship. The problem is that since the story has painted him as such a martyr we never really feel any sense of danger because we know the writers wouldn't have him kill anyone (though it might have been a little more interesting if he had.) There are some nice Machurian Candidate and brainwashing ideas here that are toyed with briefly when Data and Danar have a conversation about their mutual programming and being more than the sum of their parts. Mostly the episode is about action and the ending is an anti-climax.

The High Ground - Skippable -While delivering medical supplies, Beverly gets abducted by terrorists whose enigmatic leader wants her to find a cure for a transport system they use that's killing them. I really WANT to give this one a watch. It's fantastic new ground for the series. Beverly and Finn, the leader of the terrorists, have conversations about the nature of terrorism, the difference between a terrorist and a revolutionary is just the difference between winning and losing. In fact the episode seems strangely pro-terrorist, especially when Data tells Picard that according to his research, terrorism seems an effective way of promoting social change. There's also a nice bit at the end between Picard and Beverly when Beverly thinks they might die and touches on their relationship that's always just below the surface. The problem is the scenes that aren't between Picard, Beverly, and Finn are flat and cliched. In order to provide Finn's intellectual terrorist an adequate counterbalance, there are a number of scenes between Riker and the head of police, Alexana. Alexana is an impassioned officer...a little TOO impassioned - her melodramatic ramblings border on Tasha Yarr's Season 1 suck. And after such interesting discussions on the moral ambiguity of terrorism the writers try and wrap a happy bow around the episode by having a child terrorist lay his weapon down at the end and Riker and Alexana share a platitude. Icky.

Deja Q - Must Watch - Q is made human as punishment from the continuum. Picard grants him temporary sanctuary on the ship and assigns Data to follow him for the duration of his stay. This is one of the top ten episodes of the series, easily the best pure ""Q"" episode (considering Q-Who was really about the Borg.) Q's brief struggle with being human is funny and incredibly well written. The scenes between John De Lancie and Brent Spiner are addictively watchable and the episodes finale is clever and pitch perfect.

A Matter of Perspective - Skippable - Continuing Season 3's overall trend of, ""Yeah...that was Ok,"" is A Matter of Perspective. The episode actually begins with a great teaser. The crew is researching the progress of a Doctor Apgar who is looking into harnessing Kreiger waves on a Federation space station. We see the bridge of the ship with the space station on the viewer. Riker's voice comes over communicator saying he's ready to leave. As he does, the space station explodes. After the opening credits, Riker is accused of the Doctor's murder by the local police, whose governmental politics are (GASP) guilty until proven innocent. Picard convinces him to hold an investigation on the holodeck where Riker's visit to the destroyed space station is recreated, as seen by various members of the ship and station personnel. It's an interesting idea but the Riker created in the police recreations is such a mustachio'd twirling lunatic that it kind of ruins any of the suspense in the episode. Part of the promise of the opening tease was that we didn't get to see exactly what happened on the space station, which means that we don't KNOW if Riker is guilty or, short of that, culpable for something. It's an opportunity to at least see the ordinarily blandly stalwart first officer in another light. However about the point that the sheriff's holo-decked version of Riker yells, ""YOU'RE A DEAD MAN APGAR!!"" we know the episode isn't going to be revealing any interesting nuances to Riker's personality. It would have been much more interesting had the recreations built a plausible setup based on what we already know of Riker's character. Doesn't matter anyway because Wesley solves the problem for everyone. Swing and a miss.

Yesterday's Enterprise - Must Watch - When most Trek fanatic's I know list their top five, Yesterday's Enterprise is in there someplace. While not one of my personal favorites, it is one of the best hard sci-fi episodes in the series and an incredibly important episode in the show's mythology. The Enterprise is investigating a temporal rift in space when a vessel from the past slips through, altering the present. The Federation is now at war with the Klingons, Tasha is at tactical, Data Worf is gone, and the only one who realizes anything has changed is Guinan.  She pleads with Picard to send the vessel from the past back, something that they both know would mean the deaths of everyone on board. It's a great alternate history kind of story where the ordinarily plushy universe of Trek gets a little more dystopic, including an oddly gory battle at the end. One of the reasons to watch the show.

The Offspring - Watch - Data creates his own child, a daughter named L'al. If you haven't seen this one go watch it right now. When you're done come back and we'll talk about it. Seen it? All right. I like this episode but didn't we cover this in Measure of a Man? If Data is a sentient self determining being then it would follow that so is his offspring. Yet here again we have some cliched Federation honcho demanding that an artificial person be moved against their will. It's a contrivance simply to lend the story some conflict and is completely unnecessary and a little anti-climactic given...how the episode ends. The real joy in the story is in Data's relationship with his daughter and exploration of parenting. Had the story really needed a conflict to hold our interests it could have been Data's battle with L'al's ""sickness"" throughout the entire episode which eventually resulted in her death. As long as we're splitting hairs here about a decent episode: Hallie Todd's performance as L'al is incredibly grating. She spends most of the episode doing a robot voice rather than exuding the childlike essence that Brent Spiner does so well with. Regardless, it's a wonderful episode and I still get dust in my eyes at it's conclusion everytime. Must remember to not chop onions whenever I watch this one...

Sins of the Father - Watch - Worf meets his younger brother and returns to the Klingon homeworld to defend the honor of their father, accused of being a traitor against the empire. This is an incredibly important episode in Worf and the Klingon's story arc. We are introduced to the Klingon government and it's inner-workings, Worf's brother, and the House of Durass. It's all very well and good if you like Klingon's but whenever I watch these episodes I end up fixated on the same thing: How the hell did the Klingon's achieve space travel? They're portrayed as such murdering back-stabbing petulant cave men. It doesn't make sense to me that a species who never appears to demonstrate any intellectual prowess what-so-ever could have even made it to the rocket age. Still, this is one you have to watch.

Allegiance - Watch - Picard is kidnapped and replaced with a doppleganger. While the real Picard struggles to figure out a way to escape his prison with three other captive aliens, his double takes the Enterprise into danger. I'm going to use the excuse that this is the first episode that introduces the nausigans...that's why it gets a Watch and not a skippable. The nausigans are an intimidating looking alien that are somewhat significant in Picard's story arc later in the series. Really though I just like this episode. The real Picard ends up in a fascinating Cube-esque scenario he needs to figure his way out of, and his double plays nicely against our expectations of Picard. His scenes are fun and sometimes cringe inducing. The ending doesn't quite provide the payoff that the setup promises but it's still an enjoyable ride in getting there.

Captain's Holiday - Watch - In this season's special features there is an interview with Patrick Stewart in which he says that he felt his character was becoming a bit dry. Picard's roll on the show was becoming little more than that of a negotiator - someone who stood on the bridge and talked. Apparently this was the reason for Captain's Holiday: keeping the show's anchor cast member happy.  So, Picard is burnt out and forced to take a vacation by Crusher. He heads to Risa and tries to spend some time reading and relaxing by the pool, but ends up with a woman named Vash searching for a relic left by a time traveler. Frankly, it's a pretty lame episode. There are a couple of nice bits between the crew and the Captain in the first ten minutes but otherwise the story is mostly devoid of humor or any intrigue. There are a pair of time traveler's that are trying to retrieve a relic, a ferengi that I think is supposed to be funny (he isn't), and a makeout session that doesn't make a ton of sense. In fact when Picard kisses Vash, her personality seems so in contrast to his own that it's almost as though he's just doing it to either shut her up or have a fling...which isn't really keeping with Picard's character. It's all kind of a mess but Vash reappears later in this series and another. Watch with a friend or a bottle.

Tin Man - Watch - The Enterprise takes a psychic diplomat named Tam Elbrun on board who is to help the crew make first contact with a ship that might be a living being. Tam has a volatile personality sculpted by years of being overwhelmed by his powerful psychic ability he is  unable to turn off. This is an episode you see often in trailers and retrospective's concerning the series. The art design and special effects used to bring Tin Man to life were some of the most interesting in the series to that point. Some of the best music in the series also finds it's way into this one. Tin Man's journey through space isn't painted with loud fanfare or obvious strokes, but with subtle strings and woodwinds almost as though he were a whale floating in the ocean. However what makes this episode interesting to me is Tam and his ability to read thoughts that he can't turn off. In his scenes with the crew we see him responding to things the crew say to him out loud as well as what they're saying in their own heads. We get a sense of what an awful, self-esteem destroying life it must have been to be constantly assaulted by the things people think but don't say. It's a compelling and thoughtful episode.

Hollow Pursuits - Must Watch - Hollow Pursuits introduces Lieutenant Barclay. Barclay is a new transfer to Geordi's engineering team, shy and reclusive. Geordi can't stand him but is instructed by Picard to draw the reclusive engineer out of his shell just as strange malfunctions begin occurring on the ship. In doing so, Geordi discovers Lieutenant Barclay has a bit of a holodeck addiction. It's a theme that the series has been screaming for since the holodeck gained the ability to simulate people. A holodeck is potentially a more addictive escapist medium than television, video games, or drugs combined. Finally we get an episode that deals with it in a somewhat realistic, if amusing fashion. It's a wonderful episode that digs a layer or two deep beneath the conventions of the universe to consider the ramifications of it's inner workings.

The Most Toys - Watch - Data is captured by a collector of rare items named Kivas Fajo who makes the crew believe he was destroyed in a shuttle accident. Perhaps one of the best guest star appearances in the entire series, Saul Rubinek plays Fajo with such energy and self love that it's hard for us not to love him too, despite his status as Data's captor. The best sequences in the episode occur in conversations between Fajo and Data where he tries to make Data behave more like a piece of property than a captive. Fajo's manipulations serve as a wonderful medium for exposing the outer limits of Data's personality that we see only brief glimpses of throughout the series. Despite a mostly humorous tone throughout the episode (due to Saul's giddy performance) the ending has a chilling moment and leaves the viewer to decide what Data might be capable of, as he stares blankly into the faces of his comrades who are wondering the same thing. It's a complex and thoughtful episode.

Sarek - Watch - The famous Ambassador Sarek comes on board the Enterprise to negotiate a peace treaty. When he does, strange emotional outbursts begin occurring among the crew and it seems that Sarek's questionable emotional state may be the cause of it. The episode bridges the gap between some of the original shows lore and the Next Generation and there are some fun sequences including a brawl in Ten Forward. Perhaps most famous is a sequence that could have been a throwaway in an otherwise mostly average episode. Picard, under the duress of Sarek's psychic emotional baggage, freaks the hell out and Patrick Stewart shows everyone he could read the classifieds and make it sound like Hamlet. In his rants we hear bits and snippets of events in Sarek's life to which we have no background or insight and yet we feel the anguish and regret of Sarek's lifetime in Stewart's performance.

Menage a Troi - SKIP - Lwaxanna, the Ferengi, and Wesley create a trifecta of badness in this slap-sticky scholck ridden monstrosity. Lwaxanna, Troi, and Riker are kidnapped by a horny ferengi that wants Lwaxanna to read his opponents minds and play with his lobes. Wesley saves the day. It isn't season one bad but it's close. As usual in these terrible episodes, Patrick Stewart provides the lone moment of redemption as he's forced to fake a smitten rage at the ferengi to get Lwaxanna back. When he tells Wesley to set course for Betazed at Warp 9, we feel his pain and are hoping for an equally speedy end to the episode. Oh and that plucky Wesley gets a field promotion to ensign. Avoid this mire of misguided camp at all costs.

Transfigurations - Skip - Beverly suffers the Florence Nightingale (Lorraine McFly?) over a patient the crew finds crashed on an alien planet. The patient suffers from amnesia and is experiencing a cellular mutation. As the crew investigates this John Doe's past he and Beverly form a bond. There isn't a lot of fun to be had in watching the Dr. Crush on this character. In fact I found her scenes between Troi and Wesley to be a bit shallow as she struggles to make a simple crush sound more profound. It doesn't help that John Doe speaks in slow deep bass like he's just fallen out of a romance novel or a self-hypnosis tape.

The Best of Both Worlds Part 1 - Must Watch - One of the top ten episodes of the entire series. The Borg send a single ship toward Earth. At this point in the series the Borg had only been seen in the single episode where Q tossed the ship into their territory. Before the movie and Voyager sapped them of almost all of their fright and intimidation (the shark in Jaws is scariest when you DON'T see him) this was how bad-ass the Borg were. One single vessel could assimilate all of humanity. With this two-parter the show reaches an epic level of story telling not yet seen even in the movies.

Some of the series' best episodes can be found in this season, including ""Sins of the Father,"" ""Defector,"" ""Sarek,"" ""Offspring,"" Yesterday's Enterprise,"" and, of course, ""Best of Both Worlds.""

Enter season three: bigger budgets, better scripts, better acting, better costumes, better music - basically, better everything. The writers here have started to fuse the great adventure found in the best Trek episodes with some really solid character development. Picard is more nuanced, Data develops, Crusher makes a welcome return (I always liked her relationship with Picard), and Worf starts to get more of a backstory. Added bonuses: in this season you'll find the all-time Trek classics ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" and ""The Best of Both Worlds, Pt. 1.""

The first half of the season was remarkably uneven, with some decent episodes, but many were unbearably slow, like The Defector.  Yesterday's Enterprise is the episode that is commonly cited as the show's turning point, but I would like to give some credit to the episode that preceded it, Q Who.  The god like alien Q is stripped of his powers, leaving him a vulnerable human being.  Q is actually developed for the first time since we met him in Encounter at Farpoint.  This was not the writer's intention, but I believe Q's dependence on his powers is analogous to our dependence on technology.  We see Q's selfless side for the first time, as well as some good Data moments.  Data laughing is one of my favorite scenes ever.

The season concluded with The Best of Both Worlds, one of the best cliffhangers in television history and arguably the best episode in the series.  Overall, I think the fourth season is superior because of the third season's weak first half, but this is still the season to start with if you want quality TNG.",1282262400,,1165,4.616504854368932

First and foremost, Beverly Crusher is back!, while I didn't mind pulowski at all, she was quite cool, but let's face it, Beverly is an excellent character, and this show needed her presence, her relationship with Data is much better than Pulowski's was, as well as her relationship with Picard.

Secondly, the uniforms have been changed, AND FOR THE BETTER, they look SO much better in these than the previous ones, much more fitting.

Third, a bit of the intro sequence has changed, for the better as well, where it was changed was all the space phenomena before Picard has his speech, and it looks so beautiful.

I cannot express in words the excellence of this season (and the series from here on out), it's just so well done, genuine, and original, whereas most of the first season plots seemed like a bad rip-off of TOS, (and don't think I am putting TOS down, because I certainly am not, thats what got me into Star Trek), but enough of the 1st season, this season is where someone should start if they want to check out this series, although season 2 is pretty good as well, but it doesn't hold a candle to this season.

Standout episodes for me.

Evolution, Booby Trap, The Survivors, Who Watches The Watchers, The Defector, The Hunted, The High Ground, Deja Q, A Matter of Perspective, Yesterday's Enterprise (of course), The Offspring, Sins of the Father, Tin Man, Hollow Pursuits, and Sarek.

The only sub-par episodes for me were 'The Bonding' although it would get interesting near the end, and 'Captain's Holiday' had much potential, with the story, but I don't think it worked, at least it didn't for me.

1695868,5,B000063V8R,"""There are times, sir, when men of good conscience cannot blindly follow orders.""
-- Jean Luc Picard to Admiral Haftel, ""The Offspring""

Of all the Next Generation seasons, Three may be the most difficult one to define.  It's easy to point out the fact that it's a far more polished season than its predecessors, featuring immensely superior production values in terms of lighting, color balance, and costumes that lend a more dignified look to the show.  Beyond that though, things get muddled.

Season Three undergoes a massive change of identity, most likely due in part to the arrival of new head writer Michael Pillar and a change of executive producers as Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry let go of the reigns due to his declining health.  The new guard behind Next Gen seemed very concerned with making Trek more respectable and less fantastic.  So, while the production values were enhanced to bring about this affect, the direction of the series seemed to follow, largely de-emphasizing the prominence of science fiction in most episodes (with several notable exceptions) and honing in, instead, on political, ethical, and personal drama.

This works amazingly well in several groundbreaking episodes including ""The Survivors,"" ""Who Watches the Watchers?"" ""The Enemy,"" ""The Defector,"" ""Booby Trap,"" ""The Offspring,"" and ""Sins of the Father"".  The Offspring, in particular, is one of the most powerful dramatic episodes in the entire Star Trek franchise, while ""Sins of the Father"" lays the basis for Worf's personal struggles throughout his tenure on Next Generation and Deep Space Nine.

There are also several episodes that play up a more character-rich and light-hearted side of Trek, including Luwaxana Troi's abduction by ogling Ferengi in ""Menege a Troi,"" Q's amusing tenure as an ordinary human in ""Deja Q,"" and Picard's less than laid back vacation in ""Captain's Holiday.""

Unfortunately, this season also contains many relatively dull and dreary episodes that necessarily result from this first attempt to lend more dignity and restraint to a formerly far-out science fiction series.  It's difficult to decide how to fill 45 minutes of episode run time when the phasers aren't firing and there's no hostile force threatening the ship. As a result, while I'd be hesitant to call any episode in this season bad, there are many that I simply consider skippable.  Each has a strong concept at its center, but most simply run too long and fail to provide enough dramatic action.

However, just as Next Gen is beginning to feel almost uncomfortably restrained in this season, the writers deliver two of the series' best remembered fantastic science fiction premises: ""Yesterday's Enterprise,"" and ""The Best of Both Worlds P.1"".  Both are, perhaps, so utterly successful because they blend the fantastic with rich, realistic human drama and polished, respectable production values. Even if the rest of the season were a total wash, these two episodes would warrant the purchase of this volume by themselves, clearly benefiting from all that the new creative team brought to this season.

Finally, by the end, Season 3 achieves a new apex of excellence for Star Trek, delivering balanced episodes with compelling human drama at their core while framed by solid, enjoyable science fiction premises operating in the background.  The strongest of these are ""Hollow Pursuits,"" which introduces us to the unforgettable Reginald Barkley, and ""Sarek,"" in which Mark Lenard reprises his role from the original series.  Then, of course, the series concludes with the already mentioned ""Best of Both Worlds p. 1"" which, though primarily centered on an action-intensive plot, does incorporate significant emotional drama for the characters and viewers alike.

So, while Season Three brings production values, realism, and political and personal drama to the next level, the end result is uneven.  There are many dull moments in this season, yet one can't deny the quantity of exceptional episodes that are spaced out between them.  You're not going to love every episode that Next Generation Season Three has to offer, but the highlights of this season are amongst Trek's finest.",1238976000,2,4180,5.238380809595203

Season 3 is generally remembered for three fan favorite episodes - ""Deja Q"", ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" and part 1 of ""The Best of Both Worlds.""  But I think what is remarkable is that there are almost no bad episodes - the only read duds are ""The Price"" and ""Menage a Troi"".  Instead, you get a mix that's split about 50-50 between episodes that you'd characterize as very good or better, and episodes that are solid, watchable but unremarkable.  That's different from season 5, where the quality dispersion is much wider.

Besides the fan favorites, there are two remarkable episodes I would like to single out as personal favorites - the classic military thriller ""The Defector"" and the wonderful ""The Offspring"".  I would put those up against any other episode in the series.

1695887,5,B000063V8R,"There are several compelling reasons to purchase this set:

This is by far the best of several great NG seasons; writing is crisp, the dialog is visceral, the tempo is great, and the shows are generally as good or better than you will find in earlier or later years.

The characters' development is proceeding on all fronts, human, Klingon, and crew-wise. The production, writing, and directing is nearing its peak.

But, as important as any of these are, don't forget ILM (div of LucasFilms) did the special effects. This is as high a quality of special effect as you will ever see in television. It is guaranteed with all the computer and CGI junk as there is now, you will not see better sci-fi action than this. MANY OF YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN THE ORIGINAL Next Gen SHOWS IN HI DEF. YOU MUST!! It is leaps and bounds better than other versions.

Many of us trekkers are just now getting the high quality 1080i or 1080p high def televisions. You will not believe how much better the quality of Next Gen is until you see it on one of these hi def sets. Get one with HDMI and upcoding, and it will up-convert your standard def show like Next Gen DVD TO HDMI and 1080i or p. It is unbelievable!! As good as the VHS tapes were, as good as you can record Trek off TV nowdays, the factory stuff with the Dolby Surround encoding cannot be beat. Many movies do not have the quality of these Trek shows. Some of these shows had as much as 3 Million in special effects budgets- for 1987 that was a ton of money. Some blockbuster films did not have much more budget than a single trek show!

So, add this new compelling element, top quality video, to the OTHER strengths of Season Three Next Gen and you have an all time winner. No collectors set of videos would be complete without Year 3, the Third Season, of Star Trek Next Gen. It is excellence personified. The stereo is near perfect, audio mixing is the best I ever heard (check out the subwoofer content in engineering scenes), surround is first class, the directing, writing, acting, and direction, cannot be beat for TV, and the special effects are as good as you will ever see. You can bet there will never be another Trek Next Gen. But if you have a high def television, you are in for a treat, as this is historic. The Pinnacle of television.

This is the complete package for Sci Fi and Trek fans. You get the action, the effects, the cerebral, philosophical nature of Trek, and video that cannot be beat, 19 hours of it, for 62$. Mighty hard to beat. Gene, the Great Bird of the Galaxy, would be proud. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to some really classic trek and sci fi and at least get season three. If you are a trek fan, this one season is the least you can try out.

1695892,5,B000063V8R,"In my opinion, Season 3 is when the Next Generation came into it's own and established it's own identity apart from the original series. Most of the characters have fully developed and come into their own. As enjoyable as her character could be, Dr. Pulaski has been thankfully replaced by Dr. Crusher's return. Pulaski provides memorable moments but she was clearly a ""Bones"" pastiche. As another reviewer has noted, the Second Season ended abruptly and on an uninspiring note. Season 3 hits the ground runnning and doesn't stop. This season contains several of my favorite episodes and establishes several story arcs that will span the next several seasons, such as the Klingon/Worf saga. Standouts: The Defector, The Hunted, The Enemy, Sins of the Father.

The season also includes our second favorite episode of the series, ""Q Who"" where Q is banned from the continuum and forced to become human.  That episode was pure fun!  The biggest disappointment of the season was the return of the wimpy Dr. Crusher.  We had really hoped that Dr. Pulaski would last for several seasons at least (if not the entire series!); she was so much better and stronger in the role as Chief Medical Officer--her you could believe people would follow as a leader in a military operation!

Overall, the third season was a very good one, and it was exciting to see it end with a bang (and a cliffhanger!), ensuring its continued existence... very satisfying for those of us who wish the original series had seen the same continued success.",1175990400,2,1124,4.704081632653061

The DVD menus are easy to use with 4 episodes per disc.  They are shown in order of air date, but the episodes are not always numbered in order.

1695927,5,B000063V8R,"After two OK seasons, Star Trek: The Next Generation finally hits its stride in the third season. When people mention that this is one of the greatest TV shows ever made, the third season is what they're talking about. Each episode is crisply written, well-plotted, and multilayered. The show's powers have grown enough to take on more of the massive and difficult-to-film topics that the second season hit only intermittently. All around, the show has finally become completely consistent and satisfying.

Character-wise, season 3 continues the developments introduced in season 2. Riker remains the risk-taker, and Data's arc toward humanity is developed wonderfully, especially in The Offspring. First-season casualty Tasha Yar makes her first of several reappearances in Yesterday's Enterprise, generally considered one of the best TNG episodes (though considered overrated by myself). The tension between Worf's Klingon heritage and Starfleet commission is explored in greater detail, especially in Sins of the Father.

Most every episode in this season is at least entertaining, and picking highlights is difficult. Who Watches The Watchers is a beautiful and suspenseful treatment of Trek's most difficult dilemma - accidental human interference in a developing culture. The Defector features a dangerous political game between the Federation and the longtime antagonist Romulans. The Hunted is an extremely action-heavy episode with a twist of meaning between the numerous fights and chases. The Offspring is an excellent companion piece to season 2's The Measure of a Man, with less intellectual depth but more emotional resonance. Captain's Holiday introduces a new facet to Picard's often-muted personality.

About the season finale, The Best of Both Worlds, a great deal has been said. This was one of the first TV cliffhangers to go between two seasons, and certainly one of the most effective as well. It's a bold stroke, and the final line of the season is guaranteed to stick in your head until the episode's resolution at the beginning of Season 4. All in all, this is the first essential season of this excellent sci-fi show. Highly recommended. Just be warned, if you're in for this one, you'll be in for Season 4 as well.",1153872000,4,2241,5.307042253521127
1695928,5,B000063V8R,"The Star Trek Collection is a worthy hobby and certainly the largest of the television series DVD Collections (The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise). At around 1100 minutes per box (a few hours less than the TOS seasons) we are still looking at approx 30 boxes with 700 hours of viewing. That is 1 month of non-stop Star Trek. No DVD series comes remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and build up on each succession over the years. By the end you will have a very serious anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next few years. It is a cherished memory that served your fathers and will serve your children also. Our very planet, Earth, has advanced because of Gene Roddenberry's admirable concept. Roddenberry nailed the premise of the series when he said that he wanted to create a show with characters that we could look up too. `The Bridge' members are like our family. Watch what they do. Then go and spend your life striving for the same on Earth. What engineer, medic, scientist, teacher, worker can not say that Star Trek has not influenced them? The show is this significant in the development of our species. Even Christians respect and quote its authority and it is not hard to see why. The DVD case is not quite as fancy as the TOS (The Original Series) cases. The TNG case is supposed to resemble a TNG crew briefcase. The case opens to reveal the disc booklet inside a sleeve. Sliding the disc booklet out of the sleeve and flipping it open reveals a spread of 7 discs. There are 4 episodes per disc. However the last disc, disc 7, only has two episodes, for a grand total of 26 episodes (TOS has 8 Discs, 30 episodes). The rest of disc 7 is devoted to Star Trek interviews and trailers with the usual expected extras...and then some more. The episodes are ordered not in the sequence they where filmed, but in the sequence that they aired, however each episode has been numbered according to the order they where filmed in. This means on one disc you have shows 4, 2, 12 and 1, in that order although Season Three was aired fairly much according to the chronological produced order except for episode one and two which are switched around. The sound has also been remastered to 5:1 Dolby Digital! Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained.

Star Trek, The Next Generation (TNG), Season Two continued with the amazing impact TNG had when it was first broadcast but made it more Enterprise based with less beaming down than Season One. Season Three corrects this somewhat critical tilt with Season Two by reintroducing us to lots of planet based exploration stories... and good ones at that too. Season Three has a whole new opening sequence to improve on the first computer generated images of our solar system as Captain Picard utters the immortal words... `To baldly'... I mean... `To boldly go where no man'... I mean... `To boldly go where no one has gone before.'  It was the dawn of the 90s and since CGI had undergone some development, the improvements can be seen not only in the new opening sequence, but with better looking planets (complete with moving gaseous atmospheres) and major enhancements in particle effects. Towards the end it undergoes new model development, lighting and subspace effects of a movie budget look. The crew uniform has changed with a new type of collar. Most of the main characters from Season Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker (now with a bigger belly), Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Worf (letting his hair grow even more), Commander Deanna Troi (with more makeup, costume changes and even an aerobics outfit [that really isn't as good as it sounds]), Lieutenant Commander Data and Ensign Wesley Crusher (new hairdo). Dr. Beverly Crusher is back (initially with a terrible hairdo that gets better) and Doctor Katherine Pulaski has been dropped from the show never to reappear again. Pulaski's disappearance is not officially explained (in reality Diana Muldaur was told her character was not working and she was offered a role in L.A. Law instead. McFadden was asked to rejoin the series again) the crew do act like she has just left because her time was up with Dr. Crusher making reference to Pulaski's work in Episode four. Commander Lieutenant Tasha Yar makes a surprise guest appearance for one episode! Dwight Schultz (Murdoch from the A-Team) makes his first appearance as Lieutenant `Reg' Barkley, who would have a reoccurring role. Colm Meaney is here again as Miles Edward O'Brien, Navigation, doesn't have much of a role boost since Season Two, while the Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan character of the wise El Aurian, the bartender in 10 Forward, has her background further developed. Season Three of TNG is mostly about nanotechnology, colonization, super aliens, the prime directive, orphans, ancient space booby traps, Romulans, wormholes, peace negotiations, defectors, super humans, terrorism, Q, court inquisitions, parallel universes, AI, Klingon high councils, captivity experiments, time travellers, biological space crafts, morale, the first law of robotics, Vulcans, Sarek, evolutionary speciation, and the Borg. Unlike Season Two there is much more planetary exploration and lots of alien encounters. There are loads of unforgettable episodes in this Season, ""Evolution"" where nanotechnology takes over the Enterprise, ""The Survivors"" is a mystery about a single household that is the only structure to survive an alien invasion on a whole planet, ""Who Watches The Watchers?"" is about the prime directive failing when the Enterprise team are spotted and kidnapped, ""Offspring"" sees Data creating another sentient android, ""Sins of the Father"" has Worf return to his Klingon homeworld to defend his family honour, ""Hollow Pursuits"" has Lt. Barkley fantasizing about crew members in the Holodeck, ""Sarek"" is about the Vulcan of the same name from Star Trek: The Original Series, who is back for what looks like his final peace negotiation, and of course the pot-boiler end episode of ""The Best of Both Worlds, Part I"" (widely acclaimed as one of the best Star Trek episodes ever!) marks the grand entrance of Locutus of Borg onto the scene. The bottom line for TNG: Season Three is that it is often cited by fans as the best TNG Season and is probably the first of the Seasons to really be worth the price tag demanded of these very expensive box sets. In Season Three everyone seems to have matured, included the writers who are giving us exactly what we want and the series has a serious enough budget to make every episode look like a movie, especially towards the end. There is lots in this season to enjoy and of course not since J.R. Ewing had been shot did we get the kind of cliff-hanger episode that ""The Best of Both Worlds, Part I"" would deliver on, meaning every Trekie (and who wasn't at this time) across the planet from LA to Hong Kong had to wait all summer to learn how Picard could be saved. There is no time to loose!!! Onto Season Four.... wooosshhhh.",1148774400,12,7160,4.858428805237316
1695929,5,B000063V8R,"Who would have guessed? After a DISASTEROUS first season, and a not much better second season, who would have thought that Next Generation's third season would be a tour-de-force of great acting and storytelling? And yet, that's exactly what happened. Coming off the writers' strike of season 2, Season 3 roared out of the gate with the return of Gates McFadden as Dr. Crusher. Season 2 had seen Crusher replace by the hated Dr. Pulaski, whose Enterprise tenure was thankfully only one season. In addition, Whoopie Goldberg as Guinan was featured prominently as a supporting character in this season, which added immeasurably to the ensemble cast dynamic. The introduction of Worf's continuing Klingon saga in this season was the start of Next Generation's continuing storylines, and the dark nature of the Klingon story arc was fantastic. In addition, the scriptwriters and the actors finally 'found' the characters after two wildly uneven seasons, and the classic portrayal of the Next Generation characters would begin right here in season 3. The true shining moments of season 3, however, are the cliffhanger season finale (which truly introduces the Borg after a cameo appearance in season 2), and one of the greatest Star Trek episodes of all time: Yesterday's Enterprise (featuring the return of Denise Crosby as Tasha Yar). Add in the expanded characterization of all the main cast, the SUPERB storylines, and the fact that there is not a single bad (or even average!) episode in this season, and you get the finest single year Star Trek has ever seen. Season 3 single handedly turned Next Generation into a television legend. If you like sci-fi, Next Generation's season 3 is an absolute MUST OWN. Following up season 3 was the equally impressive season 4, which is also mandatory viewing. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!",1146700800,3,1831,5.127090301003345
1695930,5,B000063V8R,"The DVDs themselves are of good quality; I've rented many seasons' worth and reminded myself which stories throughout the run were good and which were not...

$50 per season is on par and is a good price.  (So what's coming soon that's compelling people to buy these current sets?)

Wish I could afford it; thanks to the prices of necessities gone up so much (food, shelter, and distilled petroleum products being slightly more important than Captain Picard standing around as if he hasn't spent a penny in decades...), $50 is still an effective $100 out of my pocket in the end.

Don't get me wrong, the entire series IS fun and seasons 3 and beyond have their appreciable values as well; but they are a change...

Evolution:  A terrific season opener that reintroduces Dr Crusher with aplomb.  Wesley starting the problem is a big boost too.

The Ensigns of Command:  Another home-run with this entry of Picard having his hands full; fighting a stolid species of inflexible corporate bugs while finding means to persuade a bunch of colonists to vacate the planet that the inflexible corporate bugs claim ownership too.  Very good story indeed!

The Survivors:  An oddball, but highly enjoyable and well cast.  Especially if you've never been keen on Troi.

Who Watches the Watchers:  Badly dated and preachy, but it's got enough set pieces to remain worthy.

The Bonding:  I think, as with When the Bough Breaks, this one features kids on it as a result of a candy bar write-in contest...  It's a bit soapy, and why the alien wants to cajole one little kid seems silly...

Booby Trap:  Shades of season 2, but this one is back on form with good ideas; especially with seeding an idea to be followed up next season.  Though, in reality, the ship caught in the trap would not survive a thousand years...

The Enemy:  Utterly perfect, with one problem:  No Vulcan, a race that is a blood-brother to the Romulans, has the blood type needed to save the captured Romulan - yet Worf, a Klingon - is the sole person who CAN save this Romulan?!  Talk about shoehorning rubbish science into a scenario that's otherwise excellent, even with the silly uberdrama...  Maybe he should donate some blood and have it transfused into a poodle and see if the poodle survives.  That's what it boils down to.

The Price:  Even today, the romance subplot is heavyhanded, but the Ferengi get just desserts with their meddling.  :D

The Vengeance Factor:  Well done story about blood feud.

The Defector:  I used to love this one, but rewatching it reveals the uberdrama petty soap opera it sadly is.  It DOES have potential and a few surprise twists, but Picard taking all that time to instill excess drama into a situation that warrants fast response?  At that point I'd be cheering for the opposing team!!

The Hunted:  A decent parallel to Vietnam vets; and hasn't dated much by today's standards either.

The High Ground:  Whew boy.  This anti-terrorism story doesn't fit well today.  It's too one-sided...

Deja Q:  Another Q episode.  How can't it be good?!  CLASSIC!  Q becomes human and the interplay with the crew is classic.  Especially when Guinan hears about the development...  Picard saving Q's bacon by the end is to be expected, but well handled.

A Matter of Perspective:  Pity we didn't have that in the terrorism story.  :rolleyes:  This one is far worse for having it...  best left forgotten.

Yesterday's Enterprise:  Classic.  Nice to see Yar back.  Also sets up a concept to be revived later on, which all things considered is brilliant.

The Offspring:  Remake of ""The Measure of a Man"" and the story, much like Lal, self-destructs because it's 100% derivative.

Sins of the Father:  Continues the Worf saga.  Until season 6 then DS9, this saga is fun.

Allegience:  Preachy and predictable, but has some nice set pieces.

Captain's Holiday:  More Ferengi?  A few nice set pieces and comedic moments, but naah...

Tin Man:  Another classic.  Reuses some f/x from Star Trek The Motion Picture, but it's easy to relate to Tam and especially To the Tin Man entity.

Hollow Pursuits:  Unworthy of any spite accorded to it; and Dwight Schultz is inspired casting.  great story on a man who isn't like the rest of us.  Pity we don't get more background info on him, but it is highly underrated.

The Most Toys:  Another well-handled gem.  The toy collector getting his just desserts in the end, too...  Great Data-centric story.

Sarek:  A plot so good that it got reused in Deep Space 9...  Sarek comes aboard and Picard mindmelds because Sarek is past his prime...  also sets up for a later story too...

Menage a Troi:  garbage.

Transfigurations:  An anti-xenophobia story.  A typical entry but has its momenets.

Best of Both Worlds:  A bit soapy at times, but there's no real reason to even begin to dislike it.  The Borg never improved after this story (apart from a novel released in 1991 that isn't considered canon...)",1138406400,6,4925,4.769689737470167

1695932,5,B000063V8R,"Nominated for 58 Emmys, including one for Outstanding Drama Series, Star Trek: The Next Generation fulfilled all the potential and promise anticipated of a long-awaited successor to the original 1960s series - Star Trek. Created by a former L.A. police officer, Gene Roddenberry, the Star Trek TV series morphed into a franchise famous for the unprecedented fanatical devotion of its audience. Lasting only three seasons during its original network run, Star Trek struck gold with its syndicated reruns, launching a number of motion pictures featuring the original cast as well as novels, comic books, collectibles, and reams of Star Trek-related memorabilia. Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987) became the first TV series to follow on the heels of the original, and its success would spark the creation of three additional series - Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993), Star Trek: Voyager (1995), and Star Trek: Enterprise (2001). But The Next Generation remained the most popular spin-off. Despite new characters and new episodes, the mission remained the same as before - ""to boldly go where no man has gone before..."" And to continue the rich tradition of the Star Trek name - a mission Star Trek: The Next Generation accomplishes with relative ease...

Star Trek: The Next Generation takes place in the 24th Century, almost one-hundred years after Captain Kirk's crew set out to explore strange new worlds. Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart - I Claudius) commands the USS Enterprise-D and its diverse crew of humans, cyborgs, and varying life forms. Accompanying him on his voyage is an entirely new cast of passengers and crew including Commander William T. Riker (Jonathan Frakes - North & South), Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner), Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton), Lt. Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby), Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn), Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden), and her son Ensign Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton)... Together, they struggle against numerous obstacles to carry out the mission of the USS Enterprise: ""To explore strange new worlds... To seek out new life; new civilizations... To boldly go where no one has gone before!"" This pioneering attitude, coupled with imaginative and brilliantly-produced alien worlds, provides Star Trek with its unique allure and special place within American pop culture - especially those episodes from the original series, widely regarded as the most popular of the Star Trek franchise...

The Star Trek: The Next Generation (Season 3) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""Evolution"" in which the crew of the Enterprise is tasked with escorting a top scientist to an area where a star is set to explode. But their voyage is hindered by a computer malfunction plaguing the entire star system... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""The Enemy"" in which Geordi finds himself stranded on a dangerous planet with an irate and injured Romulan while the Enterprise's rescue attempts are thwarted by a Romulan ship, and ""Sins of the Father"" in which Worf and his brother must work together to keep their father, who has been accused of treason, from being convicted of feeding vital information to the Romulans...

Every episode in this third season is at least solidly entertaining (okay, I admit I have a soft spot for the one where Mrs. Troi is kidnapped by the Ferengi), with at least six or seven episodes being among the best the series has ever done.  Stand-outs include ""The Offspring"" (Data creates an android daughter); the trippy ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" (a time anomaly re-writes history, resulting in Tasha Yar being alive again); and ""The Best of Both Worlds, Part I"" (the Borg return).  A suggestion:  if you buy this set, be prepared for a season-ending cliff-hanger, mainstays of ST:TNG from season three onward.  This means you might want to have the season four box set ready to go in order to see how the Enterprise gets out of the deadly situation with the Borg seen in the final moments of season three.  About the DVD's: picture and sound are sharp and clear, and the extras are often fascinating.  I especially enjoyed the surprisingly candid interviews, where cast members discuss what they liked and didn't like about the ways their particular characters were handled by the producers.

1695959,5,B000063V8R,"Let's face it...the Second Season for Star Trek: The Next Generation was by far the weakest of the seven, but it did manage to keep the show moving.  It introduced the BORG, a villain that would remain a part of Star Trek all the way through Voyager and even into Enterprise.  At the end of the second season you saw only 22 episodes due to a strike by the writing staff.  Everyone was wondering how the third season would shape up and if the show would rebound.  Boy did it rebound!  The third season began with a brand new writing staff including Ronald D. Moore and Michael Pillar and began the series on its final five SUPERB seasons.  In the third season we saw the return of Denise Crosby and Tasha Yar and we got a deeper and more personal look at the BORG.  Season three also marks the return of Gates McFadden and Dr. Beverly Crusher (GREAT MOVE!).  Season three truely ushered in a new era of Star Trek Storytelling.

  However, look at episodes: ""Yesterday's Enterprise"", ""Sins of the Father"", ""The Child"", ""Tin Man"", ""Sarek"", and the career making episode for Wesley Crusher, ""Menage a Troi""... these are the best episodes of the season and the through-lines of the season is an admirable accomplishment.",1051488000,3,572,5.540229885057471

The crew finally seems to attain that comfortable, friendly chemistry that eluded them in the first two seasons.  Picard has mellowed, Troi stops being a sex symbol and becomes credible and Worf finally gets more screen time.  This season combined the perfect blend of drama, action, suspense and character development.

Yesterday's Enterprise and The Price are alone worth the cost of this collection.
The audio and video quality of the DVD is movie quality.  This is a fabulous entertainment value for anyone interested in Star Trek in my opinion. Frankly, the episodes are far better than the original series, and the DVDs are far less expensive. All of seasons 1-4 are worth owning in my opinion, but the 3d is the best as between these.

I purchased this collection for two reasons: (a) I can watch ALL the episodes in chronological order [as they aired], and (b) so that I can watch it again and again. The bonus features that are included with the boxed sets adds to the interest I have in the show. Some people may not enjoy behind the scenes featurettes because it could detract the excitement of the story, but it's the opposite for me -- it adds to the enjoyment.
Because the collection is distributed on DVD it will display great picture quality as I'm sure the producers intended to be.

They hired Michael Piller, who from then on showed what a consistently good writer can do.  They finally got rid of the terrible spandex uniforms, which from what I've read were actually causing the actors physical problems.  They changed the main title, lead in for the show.

The Best of Both Worlds Part 1
With Best of Both Worlds, we received the first and inarguably the best cliffhanger of the entire series.  If you were like myself, watching these shows every week as they came out.  You were probably in agony over the summer to see the season four opener and find out if they got Captain Picard back.  This like all the other seasons is worth the hefty price for the DVD.  In addition to having all the wonderful shows, there are plenty of extras.",1031443200,8,1425,4.6414342629482075
1695976,5,B000063V8R,"Star Trek: The Next Generation didn't really hit its stride until the middle of the third season. After the shaky first season and the short second season, in the third season we finally get to see some The Next Generation in all of its glory.
Unlike most of the 1st and 2nd season episodes, the third season took the time to explore more of the backround of the characters:
1) Worf's backround was thoroughly explained in ""SINS OF THE FATHER."" In that episode we meet his long lost brother and learn more about his true father.
2) Another noted episode is ""THE ENEMY,"" where Geordi is stranded on a desolate planet with a Romulan. It's great to see the La Forge character actually do something besides speaking techno-babble.
3) ""THE OFFSPRING"" was a great Data episode and ""SAREK"" showed that Patrick Stewart is a magnificent actor.
(Keep in mind that there are also other character-driven episodes to watch that are also enjoyable.)
That aside, there were many action-packed episodes:
1) In ""THE HIGH GROUND,"" the Enterprise must battle terrorists after they kidnap Dr. Crusher. A great scene is when the terrorists come aboard the Enterprise and try to hijack it by force so they can destory it.
2)Another action-packed episode is ""THE HUNTED,"" which is about a genetically superior veteran of planetary war that comes aboard the Enterprise. The last 10 minutes of this episode are some of the best minutes I'sve ever seen in an TNG episode.
For comedy lovers, there are also some humurous episodes that let the crew lighten up for a few episodes:
1) In ""DEJA Q,"" Q comes aboard the Enterprise with all of his powers lost, but no one belives him. The ""going away present"" that he gives to Data at the end is great.
2) In ""MENAGE A TROI,"" Riker, Troi and her mother are captured by Ferengi. Troi's mother ends up giving ""ear foreplay"" to a Ferengi and Picard is forced to use his knowledge of poetry.
And finally, to the classic of the season, ""THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS, PART 1."" Just a little better than the second part, this episode is the best overall epsiode. It has great music, stellar acting, awesome special effects, some good action, and THE BEST ENDING EVER TO A TNG EPISODE. The last 7 minutes are outstanding.
Overall, the 3rd season of TNG isn't only a great one; it's the season that started TNG on its four-season greatness. (Seasons 3-6) Finally TNG has hit its stride.

The interior folder for the DVDs, the small fold out booklet, and the listing of which episode is on which DVD is the same as the other two seasons. The difference happens when you put the DVD in. Instead of showing clips of the episodes one after another, the screen is divided into four sections, with clips of each episode playing simultaneously. I think this is a nice change, it's a bit distracting to try and watch all four sets of clips, but if you're looking for one episode in particular, this cuts down on the waiting.
The third season is essentially like the first two, there's special features on the last DVD, and the episodes are laid out the same way on each disk.

One thing that I do personally disagree with in these stories is that the crew completely ignores the possible of God.  I think this is clear in the episode ""Who Watches the Watchers"" where Picard tries to show what disastrous effects believing in God causes.  And although I agree a lot of bad has been done in the name of God, I do believe God is the creator and that he is ultimately in control of our lives and the universe.

The Booby Trap (Picard saving the ship at the end is priceless and that music matches perfectly), The Defector (the suspense if the Romulan will attack or not and the surprise Picard has for them), The Hunted (nice to see someone give our heroes a run for their money and the message on war), Deja Q (Q being human and having new experiences very good), Yesterday Enterprise (man that is one of the best all time!! This is one of the best what if, time-warp episodes), Sins of the Father (the beginning of what I call the Klingon saga, this is the springboard), Hollow Pursuit (Barclay's fantasy world), and the Best of Both Worlds (every Trek fans know about that one!).
The interviews that they have on the DVD are very cool especially how this was a season where they had lots of new writers and basically writing on the fly. It also features heavily Michael Piller. He gives his insight on a lot of the episodes and why the Best of Both Worlds was so good. When he talks about it, makes a lot of sense!!

1695984,4,B000063V8R,"By it's third season, ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" was, undoubtedly, a great series.  Some of the series' finest episodes were made during this season and it is considered to be arguably the finest season of television the people of Star Trek have ever done.  That said, it's still a bit of a shame to see them not pull out all the stops for the DVD release - the format that's made for bells and whistles.
Aside from the twenty-six episodes of the series - for which there is little reason to go into detail here given the large number of other reviews that discuss the episodes in detail - the seventh disc of the set features four extra segments - a season overview, a look at the changes in the crew in Season Three, and two ""Departmental Briefings"": this time around focusing on episode production as well as the usual ""Memorable Missions"" segment.  They're all great segments and they do a great job of bringing the behind-the-scenes community to life.  These segments especially illuminate what Michael Piller - who would go on to be one of the most influential backstagers on ""Next Generation"", ""Deep Space Nine"" and ""Voyager"" - brought to the show when he signed on board that season.  Much of the interview footage was shot new for the episode and it highlights and gives anecdotes for many of the episodes.
All that said, though, the set - as with the previous two - seems to be missing something.  There are no episode commentaries, no scripts, no storyboards, no deleted scenes, and no TV ads.  While much of what would be covered in some episodes' commentaries is in the extras segments, it would still have been very nice to see a play-by-play analysis of ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" or ""The Best of Both Worlds, Part I"" - or even ""Who Watches the Watchers"" by Executive Producer Rick Berman and the aforementioned Michael Piller - or by Michael Okuda or Jonathan Frakes or any of the other Trek actors and creators that make the show so great.  Likewise, there must be an absolute ton of material in the vaults - segments cut for time, episode promos, screen tests, etc. - that are still waiting to see the light of day.  To really wow us with a box set, it would have been nice to have more of that in here.
Nonetheless, this is still a wonderful DVD set and certainly worth owning - even by the casual Star Trek fan.  As many others have said, Season 3 was the breakout season for the show - it's worth having on DVD.",1025654400,12,2436,4.528473804100228

After an often cringe-inducing first season, and an uneven second, the third go around is simply wonderful to watch. The entertainment value is high, and the show finds new ways to grow and become deeper and more complex. The production values appear to be higher, and the chemistry between the characters becomes fully realized.
There is so much I love about ""TNG"" starting with this season: the set design, the photography, the acting, the stories, the entire look and feel of the show. Patrick Stewart is great as Captain Jean-Luc Picard, and Brent Spiner as Data is another favorite. The entire cast manages to form a highly engrossing ensemble.
Some of my favorite stories from this season are: ""The Defector"", in which a high-ranking Romulan takes the high road and attempts to warn the Federation of impending attacks. The ending is heartbreaking. ""Sarek"", which features the venerable Mark Lenard as Spock's father, is another heartbreaking, but also profound story. ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" is simply a classic. The Enterprise C travels forward in time through a rift in space and meets Picard's Enterprise D. The plot developments, character interaction, and final outcome are some of the best underpinnings to a television episode I've ever seen. The sacrifice of both the Enterprise C and alternate-Universe Enterprise D gave me chills. And, finally, who can forget the absolutely excellent season-ender ""The Best of Both Worlds""? The story is simply pounding, the acting wonderful, and even the incidental music adds a rich, tense layer to the proceedings. An all-around solid, entertaining season. A promise of more good things to come.
I have so far been impressed with the DVD releases of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"". The third season set should be no different. The picture is crisp and the sound is clear. The format and its content are very much worth the money and the attention.

This episode set the trend for T.V. finales that most shows who copied this format failed miserably.  Nobody does it better than Star Trek, and none has been better than this episode.  This episode alone generated more speculation, more impatience, and more debate and discussion across the nation during one summer than any Star Wars movie could.  It kept people guessing for three months, including the writers, about the outcome.  These two episodes alone are worth the price.  Excellent acting, great stories, and nail-bitting suspense makes this season of Star Trek TNG the must have gift of the millennium.  I can't wait to get mine.",1023062400,,1247,4.880952380952381
1695988,5,B000063V8R,"In the first episode we see the return of Dr. Crusher.  I can't tell you all how much of a relief it was to see her return this season.  I was so glad they got rid of the annoying Dr. Pulaski when Beverly came back.  The Pulaski character was annoying like nails are on a blackboard.  Plus she was too condescending towards Data.  Please, someone warp her to the nearest blackhole and shove her out an airlock.  Then the return of Tasha in Yesterdays Enterprise...worst thing they could have done.  I actually did like her until she left ST:TNG to pursue a career on the big screen.  (I feel it did help the rest of the characters evolve though, when she did leave.) Then, she did what she could to get back on the series after her movie career was a huge flop.  Can anyone really remember a movie she was in.  Lets see, does a glow-in-the-dark condem mean anything to anyone.  They should have left her in dry dock.  Well, the studio let her come back...again (in future episodes) where she plays her own daughter, which is a Romulan, and who has huge chip on her shoulders towards the Federation for the death of her mother.  Hmmmmm, wasn't it Tasha who wanted to return with the Enterprise-C to help make her death mean something and to help the undermanned crew of the ship.  I guess Tasha didn't instill that ethic of altruism in her daughter before she died.  If anything, the studio should have used her daughter to unite and bring The Federation and The Romulans closer together instead of keeping them enemies.
Otherwise this was an excellent season.  The characters have become the crew of the enterprise that I will always think of them as.  The actors seem to have grown into their characters and all that needs to be done with them now is to have the characters evolve.  There is a lot of excitement this season too.  Here are a few plots...Geordi falls in love with a holographic Dr. Brahms while trying to save the Enterprise, Data gets to have an away mission by himself, Deanna's mother, Lwaxana, returns for a visit only to be kidnapped with Deanna by the Ferengi.  Data creates himself a daughter in ""The Offspring"".  I am very excited to get this season on DVD.  Especially with the season finale where we get to see the return of The Borg and our first glimpse at Locutus of Borg.  I think this season is a must for any fan, besides to steal a phrase...RESISTANCE IS FUTILE.",1022716800,,2395,4.480369515011548

1695990,4,B000063V8R,"I really do not notice things like the crews quarters or uniforms, I have to say. I enjoy a good story and sometimes the various Star Trek series have provided them. Sometimes they are really dumb also. I am not sure if all of the viewers realize when they are watching the show as intensely as some of the other reviewers here apparently do, but these Star Trek characters are fictional. Nevertheless, good character creates good television and one episode in this volume rates as the best Star Trek episode ever of any Star Trek series. ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" is a marvelous not to be missed work of television drama. I am sure that the intense viewer will find even more enjoyment out of this episode than the casual viewer, but even a first time watcher will find it to be excellent. So for that reason I recommend this dvd set. A good season for a good show.",1022544000,,865,4.515923566878981
1695991,5,B000063V8R,"As so many out there like to say: This is definately one to see.
The Next Generation finally establishes itself with its 3rd season running as one of the most astounding quality series to ever hit tv-screen. It has some very fine shows such as ""The Defector"", ""The Offspring"", ""Sarek"", ""Yesterday's Enterprise"", ""Deja Q"". Not to mention to any serious Fan is the overall excellent episode ""The Best Of Both Worlds"", marking the long awaited return of one of the most thrilling villains of the Star Trek-universe: The Borg. This episode works just wonderful in any way. I often thought, that this would have been a truely great blockbuster-movie, at least a hundred times better than ""Star Trek:Generations"", if they had used its plot for the big screen instead for television. The idea of having Picard become the leading force of the Borg Invasion is perhaps as easy as it is threatening. Special commendations go to composer Ron Jones; the theme he provided for the Borg surely makes one shiver and raises tensions to the utmost levels. Season 3 sets the high standard for the other seasons to come, and I'm still grateful for this remarkable series with its quality to enlighten us, to entertain us and to make us wonder about mankinds nature and the nature of the universe itself.",1021248000,4,1284,4.8144796380090495

7959831,4,B000063V8R,"This is a review of the product, not ST:TNG

Not Widescreen! Also, other seasons list as Fullscreen. These are neither. The listings should be corrected as they are misleading. The original film was 4:3 Aspect ratio and no changes to this were made. Although the remastering was superb, you will still see the bars on either side of your screen, unfortunately. Not even sure they can successfully remaster this in wide or fullscreen if they tried. Had the picture not been so clear and impressive, this review would be 1-Star.

Also, several episodes are lacking in the clean lines and smooth textures. There exists a grainy effect which is a bit disappointing. One would expect 1080p to be clear.  For example, you will notice on some of the fly-bys or beauty-passes, you can clearly make out the deck plating (aztecing) and clear stenciling of ""Enterprise"" on the connecting dorsal near the pod bay. Others, not so much. Romulan ships have the grainy or ""snowy"" effect. But other scenes are fantastic, clear enough to see the hair on Picard's ears, or the dimensions of the com badges. I wonder what explains the inconsistency.

For the most part, they hit the mark (but no further). In other areas, not so much.

All that said, Deanna is as beautiful as ever!",1520380800,,1262,4.770642201834862
