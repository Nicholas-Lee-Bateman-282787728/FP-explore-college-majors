8562471,5,B00B4RB796,"This is by far the best movie I've ever seen about the inquisition era in Europe. The film is b/w, dark and grim, but absolutely fantastic in depicting the times when the inquisitors had a total power over the believers. The actors are very good, the script and cinematography just excellent. The film works on several levels : as a historical account on the horrible times of the inquisition and as a political allegory concerning the reality of the Eastern Europe condition during the communist rule (the film was made in 1969). Anyway, this is the film that shouldn't be missed. Much more interesting than greatly overpraised ""Marketa Lazarova"". For my money, this one is much better.
