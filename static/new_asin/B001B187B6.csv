Spooky Sooga Village is a magical place snuggled between ancient rituals and modern monkey business, full of ninjas, monks, noodle chefs, magic potions and cursed clothing. Where else could you meet a girl like Pucca--the supercute, superpowered, pint-size kung fu queen.

Pucca, her ninja love Garu and their friends Abyo and Ching are ready for a fun night of Halloween Tricks and Treats. But with jumps and surprises around every corner, our mini martial artists may have to kung fu kick (or kiss) their way out of trouble.

Spooky Sooga Village is a witches' brew of mischief and mayhem for every spook and ghoul!
