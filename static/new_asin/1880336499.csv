201883,5,1880336499,"Though I have 36 bone-jarring years studying and teaching the martial arts, I am still learning. After viewing this double tape set on Muay Thai, I found ways to improve my elbow strikes (Master K has knocked out many people with his), ways to increase the penetrative power of my knee strikes and ways to increase the whip and sting of my roundhouse kick.
Master K is a wonder to watch and, more importantly, he is an expert at passing on his knowledge to the viewer.
I highly recommend these tapes.",978220800,4,500,4.5054945054945055
201884,5,1880336499,"If you are interested in learning one of the most punishing martial arts available, then this set of videos is an excellent introduction for you.  Master K (the instructor) is a 62 year old veteran of more than 70 Muay Thai fights and a retired champion from Thailand.  He has a very high  standard which he brings to his teaching and this is evident from the  videos.
I have trained with Master K for two years and have learned a lot  from him.  While you will not learn Muay Thai from these videos alone, they  carry a lot of useful information which can be used to help improve your  technique.",957139200,10,597,4.363636363636363
201885,5,1880336499,"The format of this DVD is more seminar or class workout than a step by step instructional. You can tell by watching Master K that he's spent a lot of years in the ring. He has to be in his 50s but he demonstrations kicks and strikes full power on his students and knocks more than one of them across the floor. As he coaches students, demonstrates and explains the techniques here, he drops in a lot of important little tips and insight. I've watched this DVD three times now and each time I find something else to take back to the gym and work on. This isn't a DVD for beginners but if you have some ring experience, you'll definitely find some wisdom here. Well worth the price of admission.",1149033600,4,693,4.297709923664122
201886,3,1880336499,"This dvd is done so that you are ""there"" with the teacher while he teaches his students. His explainations as well as the subjects talked about are vague. Don't expect specialized, detailed instruction with this. Still though, there are several bits of helpful advice throughout. But, its definately not worth forty bucks.",1143417600,,322,5.211538461538462
201887,4,1880336499,"Unfortunately for this DVD, I viewed the four-set DVD's by Saekson Janjira first.  That was a magnificent example of well thought out presentation and teaching ability.

Compared to the Janjira series, this single DVD seemed disjointed and not thorough in explaining and showing the various techniques.  That is understandable - you can't cover in one DVD what another covers in four DVD's.

Overall, this is a good DVD that covers a lot of territory including various techniques, combinations, history and ritual.",1101427200,5,514,5.308641975308642
201888,4,1880336499,"The only reason I hgave this a four star rating is that it is not catered to beginners and not exactly an instructional tape. It is filled with pearls and gold nuggets though. If you are a beginner you may want to try duke roufus's set. By far, the best technically beginners set is muay thai beginning and advanced sets by Surachai Sirisute, founder of thai boxing in this country. Getting back to Master K's videos- these are videos of Master K working with his students using the thai pads and heavy bag. After getting a basic knowledge of the basic muay thai techniques these tapes can be referred to for a treasure chest of pearls and gold nuggets. They are an excellent resource to any martial arts library and gave me a great deal more of the finer nuances of techniques and when/how ot throw them. This video would have gotten a five star rating but they did not because they don't express they are more for intermediates than beginnners. Besides that I don't believe you can go wrong by purchasing anything fom Master K.",1100217600,11,1029,4.537634408602151
201889,5,1880336499,"I'm surprised by some of the reviews here. I was really impressed by Master K and his teaching. The students on the tape are a pretty typical class - a few beginners, a few average guys and a couple of really tough looking guys I would not want to meet in the ring. The instruction is solid, especially if you have some experience. I really liked the little tips and tricks that Master K tossed out throughout the two videos. A few times I had to rewind and listen again because his accent is a bit hard to understand, but that wasn't a problem most of the time.
The reviewer who wrote that the filming was random and shot with a camcorder must have some kind of axe to grind because the filming is excellent quality for a martial arts vidoes. I've seen some amaturishly filmed tapes and this isn't one of them. If you're into Muay Thai or looking for some supplemental full contact training, check out this tape.",1010102400,2,913,4.376470588235295
201890,1,1880336499,"I have trained at a real Muay Thai camp and have to say that Master K is not exactly what I would call a household name in Thailand. In fact, he is pretty much unknown.  That does not make him a bad teacher, though.  What I was not impressed by was the athletic ability and the shape his students that he used to demonstrate the different techniques.  Most of them were slow, sloppy, and looked incredibly amateurish. To me, that speaks volumes about the quality of the instructor.  The video quality as well was very poor.  It looked like someone took video from their Camcorder and then ran it through their VHS and voila! I would recommend going to a camp in Thailand or Fairtex here in the U.S. if you are really serious about Muay Thai.",998006400,3,741,4.37956204379562
201891,4,1880336499,"I bought this video after seeing a taping of some fights of Master K's students.  Now I can see why they fight so well!  This training tape is a little random, but still amazing.  I just ordered his book and hope it is as good as this video.",995068800,,241,3.9791666666666665
201892,1,1880336499,"I just started taking kickboxing (Muy Thai) and thought this would be a nice supplement to my in-person training, but I was disappointed to see that there was very little instruction, and lots of random shots.  I was expecting an explanation of each move, and some sequences that you could follow, but this video was not made like that.  Although the instructor is a true master of the art, the video people that made this are true amateurs.",984096000,4,441,4.641025641025641
201893,5,1880336499,"I had the privilege of training with Master K about one and one half years ago in Lorton, VA. I am a longtime trainer in the martial arts and went to Master K with 15 years of Japanese karate under my belt...He taught me plenty. I regret that I had to leave so soon. Although I was only able to train for a little over a year before moving away I thoroughly enjoyed my time learning from Master K. He is an excellent instructor and an accomplished fighter and backs his teachings with many years of experience. These videos take you directly into the class of master K. They are a must have for any serious student of Muay Thai. Highly recomended.",978998400,2,647,4.311475409836065
7800809,4,1880336499,I watched the video when it was on prime. I liked it. Please Amazon bring back some of these martial art videos. I'm ready to buy them.,1493510400,,135,4.037037037037037

7800815,5,1880336499,"I agree the student are amateur because they are. However, you'll find those type of students in any martial art class. If you look closely in the video you would know that it's not a solely Muay Thai class, the gym is a joint class with other martial arts like TKD  (the huge korean flag in the background). But Master K knows his stuff. He is an exceptional teacher and for someone his age to strike so fast is inspirational! Those students are most likely not regular students as well.",1394755200,,488,4.4222222222222225

7800817,4,1880336499,Good overview of some of the muay thai moves.  I could really tell that Master K loves what he does; passionate about bringing his knowledge forward to the world.  Thank you.,1386374400,,174,4.580645161290323
7800818,2,1880336499,"Master K is awesome, no doubt, but this dvd is merely an overview of Muay Thai and not an instructional teaching aid. And, since it is very expensive as far as dvd's go, you would be real wise to look elsewhere. The instructional dvd's to get, in order, are Duke Roufus boxed set, Razor McCullough boxed set, and the ones by Saekson Janjira(volumes 1 & 2). All 3 are exceptional and the Razor McCullough 3 disc set is the same price as the Master K seminar dvd.",1169251200,,461,4.310344827586207
