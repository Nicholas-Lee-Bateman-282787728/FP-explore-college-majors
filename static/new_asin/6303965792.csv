743355,5,6303965792,"I really enjoy this movie. Most people would (probably) cheer on the good guys, but I liked the vampire ""Max"". I wish ""Rita"" (Angela Basset) would have gone on and joined up with him. She could have had anything & everything she wanted.",975974400,3,236,4.511627906976744
743356,4,6303965792,"This was a suprize to me, I had my doubts before I saw this movie, but was happily suprized with the result.  Eddie Murphy portrays a Vampire that is truely scary and Angela Bassett is the woman he desires to be his Vampire Queen.
Set in Brooklyn, this has an unusual twist since this is one of the first Vampire films that has an African-American as the lead Vampire since Blackula was released in the late 1960's-early 1970's.  Murphy has done a good job in portraying a Vampire who has class, dignity, strength and yet is a ruthless killer at the same time who will stop at nothing to find his queen.
Angela Bassett plays a tormented-haunted police officer who is an outcast in the police force, and she is trying to find answers to her life.  Yet there is a secret to her past that will leave her with a life (or death) changing choice to make.
The humor is good, and Murphy dosen't use his usual sense of humor which he is famous for, which enhances this film.  Overall, this is an entertaining movie that is worth watching over again.",973987200,5,1040,4.401041666666667

Personally, I believe this is one of Wes Craven's top 3 movies he's ever done. Nightmare and Serpent / Rainbow being  the other two.

744092,5,6303965792,Great classic movie,1481673600,,19,5.666666666666667
744093,4,6303965792,"Released in 1995 and directed by Wes Craven, Vampire in Brooklyn"" stars Eddie Murphy as a Caribbean vampire who travels to Brooklyn seeking the daughter (Angela Bassett) of a vampire he once knew in order to keep his vampire line continuing. Allen Payne plays her detective partner and wannabe beau  while Kadeem Hardison plays a streetwise dude whom the vampire enlists in his services. John Witherspoon and Zakes Mokae are also on hand.

I can understand why this movie bombed at the box office seeing as how the main cast is all black and this would limit its appeal, but I cant figure out why it has such a low rating since Murphy is commanding in the titular role and the movie hits all the marks of an entertaining blockbuster horror flick. Furthermore, the two main protagonists (Bassett and Payne) are great and their characters have a compelling romantic thread, not to mention Hardison is amusingly effective as the vampires ghoul; Witherspoon is also notable.

Some people complain about the mixed tone, but the mixture of serious horror with comedy was done in 1990s Arachnophobia and it was a minor hit. Its a difficult thing to pull off but Vampire in Brooklyn does so absolutely convincingly.  Yet the producers of Vampire in Brooklyn  e.g. Eddie Murphy  decided to go the extreme R-rated route with an overabundance of foul language. That, plus the primarily black cast, seriously limited the films appeal. If you can handle the foul language, however, theres a lot to appreciate here, as noted above. Murphy is excellent in three different roles, as usual; and Payne is outstanding as the male protagonist, successfully engaging the viewer.

The film runs 100 minutes and was shot in Brooklyn.

744745,5,6303965792,"This is one of my all time favorite movies.  Vampire in Brooklyn can be best described as a comedy thriller which is important to know right off the bat.  If you are a into a serious vampire genre film, this is not for you.  In saying that, there are so many witty lines and catch phrases that will keep you giggling while you enjoy the classic Dracula seduction story set in the 1990's in Brooklyn.

It's been compared to Blacula (1972). It's rare to see vampire genre films wherein the main story plot is based around Africans or African Americans in Hollywood, especially since the lore is based on Dracula who is of European origins.  In my opinion any story that deviates from that is packed with a lot of imagination and guts.  I also get a strong Love At First Bite (1979) influence in this story as well, another gutsy comedy. Most people haven't seen these movies and the similarities tend to go under the radar.

The special effects are decent and not too complicated so they hold up pretty well over time.  There were good make-up transformations through out, but if you want to nitpick, there are a few probems.  For one, the character Preacher Paulie could have used a little compressed powder to reduce is shine.  I'm not sure if they wanted him to look sweaty, but it pulls me out of the story for a second.

Wes Craven delivers the horror with great sound effects and creating that ever popular scary mood with great music, an amazing score and went heavy with the smoke effects which he was such a fan of, it ended up on the poster.

Everyone delivers their best!  If I wanted to nitpick, I would say that Angela Basset may have been too powerful an actress for the part, but there are some scenes where she delivers incredible reactions, such as when she vamps out for the first time and freaks out.  Wonderful job!",1451433600,9,1833,4.481927710843373

It begins with a history of Nosferatu, a family of vampires, and the branch in the Caribbean. An old vampire goes to Brooklyn to find the remaining survivor. A ship arrives unexpectedly! Whats happening? A man gets on the ship to investigate. Only dead bodies remain, and a wolf that changes into a human form! Elsewhere a man is thrown out of his girlfriends house. Julius is threatened, then a man appears. Two load collectors get an early retirement. Julius finds a new friend, who needs to find a special woman. The officials investigate the bodies on the ship. What is that language? A police dog goes to the wrong person. A police woman searches the hull of that ship and makes a discovery in a coffin!

Julius finds a room for the coffin, but his new friend doesnt like mirrors. There are scenes of horror - or a nightmare? Julius has a new taste for natural organic food. Later Police Officer Rita is told about her parentage. Rita meets Max in a club. At night she has a nightmare! Nikki, her roommate, left after meeting a new man. Rita goes to meet Preacher Pauley for a consultation. He talks to the church members outside the church. Its a strange sermon! [Is this believable? A parody of a famous preacher?] Guido makes a mistake in his choice of victims. He enters a restaurant and creates a scene! But Rita loves cats. There is a scene in the police station! Max rescues Rita from a speeding automobile. Do you like Italian? Rita is the Law.

Rita dresses up for dinner, a limousine arrives for her. Ritas police partner Justice investigates Julius. Rita visits Maxs apartment; he makes promises to her. Justice looks for Rita. They find Nikki at City Hall! Justice tells Rita about Nikki, it was like her painting. Rita kisses Justices, then grows fangs! She has grown stronger. Max tells her about he ancestry, but she wants to go back. Justice goes to consult that preacher who tells him what to do.

Max finds food for Rita but she is not hungry. Help me! Justice arrives with the preacher. There is a struggle. Justice must kill Max! Its too late for me says Rita. [The special effects are good.] Will something go wrong with Maxs plans? The body crumbles into nothingness. Rita returns to the living. Cross my heart and hope to die. Does Maxs ring have magical powers? Julius Jones changes.

This version of Bram Stokers famous novel may not be liked by all, it is a rough adaptation changed for its location, the Bedford-Stuyvesant district of Brooklyn county. Brooklyn used to be an independent city before the NY Legislature consolidated five counties into New York city in 1899. It has a certain amount of comedy (too much?) to balance its story of murder, horror, and love. There was another funnier parody of Dracula made earlier and set in Manhattan.",1436486400,,2846,4.636904761904762

It's break from some of the other ""Eddie murphy"" movies but I appreciate how he brought his ""Boomerang"" self to the role of a vampire without it seeming cheesy. I wish modern vampire movies could take a note from this one that they can have black vampires that don't look ashey and have interesting story lines instead of being so one dimensional. The cast in this movie is great in each role they place the most humorous duo being the goal & uncle.

745766,3,6303965792,"i watched vampire in brooklyn (1995), which i hadn't seen since i saw it in theaters. interesting movie. obviously, as a lover of wes craven, my desire is to love this flick; however, while it does many things well and interestingly, the movie falls a little flat. what stands out is that this is a film which provides total agency for african americans, without it necessarily being a ""black"" movie. what i mean by that is that the characters are all motivated independently of race in a movie that isn't necessarily about race. there are almost no white people in the film, and the one that is (the ever delightful joanna cassidy) is a strong woman. eddie murphy gives it his best shot, and while he is no william marshal, he does bring a nice presence to the vampire maximillian. angela bassett is her usual awesome self, and she brings both strength and vulnerability to rita. kadeem hardison is hysterical as max's renfield, julius jones, and john witherspoon gives us a typically humorous turn as julius' uncle silas. many of craven's former actors have nice cameos, like jsu garcia (rod from anoes), mitch pileggi (horace pinker from shocker) and wendy robie (woman from people under the stairs).

the relationship between maximillian and rita is well-done in the classic tradition of vampire relationships. in fact, one of vampire in brooklyn's greatest strengths is its' portrayal of romance and lost love, giving the movie a pleasant 1930's kind of vibe. and while clearly filmed on studio lots, the lighting and tone of ""brooklyn"" add to the effect.

vampire in brooklyn is an interesting movie with interesting politics and craven's ever evolving camera. there are several sequences that remind one that this is a wes craven movie, even if there are light, comedic moments, and brilliant comedians. more horror than comedy, vampire in brooklyn still falls a little flat, lacking a certain je ne sais quois. not irredeemable by any stretch, but not quite in the pantheon of craven's very best, it certainly is interesting and worth watching.",1412812800,,2052,4.944927536231884

746092,4,6303965792,"I can see why this film did not become a hit, due in part to the curiously different role(s) for Mr. Murphy.  While there is comedy here, Eddie's role is basically a serious one.  I applaud him for stretching out as an actor, taking a risk, and basically delivering the ""goods"" with his performance.  He amazes with his versatility in personas.  The film itself is just another take on the familiar Vampire theme.  I thought well done enough to provide a new slant and entertaining couple of hours of fun.  The supporting cast and co-stars do well enough so as not to detract from the story being told.  I give high marks for trying but 4 optimistic stars because, well, its not a James Cameron product here!  This effort got ""lost in the shuffle"" of releases I think, but I am out on a limb somewhat with my rating.  It just hit me right.",1396051200,,839,4.396103896103896

746694,5,6303965792,"Well I was searching the web looking for a damsel in distress movie with a hint of the supernatural and I found Vampire in Brooklyn. From the reviews I've seen and on Rotten Tomatoes this movie was supposedly terrible, not funny, bad, a waste of time...but then again everyone is entitled to their own opinion even if they're wrong.

  It starts out with an unknown ship arriving at Brooklyn Harbor but the crew is mysteriously dead. Not knowing that something came on shore, Rita(Angela Bassett) a disturbed somewhat psychic police officer and her partner Justice (Allen Payne)are called to the scene. Together they work on this case only to unravel that there is a Vampire in Brooklyn and he has his eyes set Rita. I loved this movie, it was awesome. I can say that (in my opinion) this is one of Eddie Murphy's best. Angela Bassett was wonderful and they played their roles perfectly.

  The fact that Eddie Murphy is playing as the main character as a Vampire, people would see this as a lame movie and they won't take it seriously, but I found it to be very good and I would recommend it to anyone who would love to see a movie about destinies, life, death, love, and vampires...not the sparkling kind.

746698,3,6303965792,"While this horror/comedy is another vehicle for Eddie Murphy to do multiple roles and such, the stars of the film are Kadeem Harddison and John Witherspoon. More on that later.

In the film, Eddie is Maximillion, a black vampire who has recently escaped hunters in the carriebian to find the last of his tribe who is the result of an affair between a human woman and a vampire. This hybird, of course, is played by Angela Bassett named Rita.

Allen Payne also stars as Justice, Rita's cop partner and potential lover who ends up fighting to save her soul from being seduced into a life of a vampire of Maximillion.

Kadeem Harddison plays as Eddie's ghoul and henchman while John Whitherspoon plays Kadeem's uncle. The two get into some hilarious situations and help keep the movie light. In fact, I would dare say in some of their scenes, they steal the show and help save this film.

Also featured here is Eddie playing multiple characters (like in Coming to America and Nutty Professor); he as the preacher is the funniest out of all of them. Angela Bassett and Allen Payne are great as the detectives who start to see that Angela is the one that the vampire is searching for. This film in general isn't as good as the more classic Murphy films, but it's good for those who are looking for a good time and for those who are interested in urban vampires.",1240531200,7,676,4.459677419354839

746822,3,6303965792,"Vampire in Brooklyn is good but not great. What stops it from being great? Wes Craven(the director) is past his prime here and horror comedy never works. One needs to look at movies like Lost Boys, Bones and House for prime examples. Were these movies funny? Yes. Scary? No. Horror and comedy never work but there is a chance that the horror part alone in Vampire In Brooklyn could have worked.

Story: Maximillian(Eddie Murphy) is in Brooklyn, New York in search of a daughter of a vampire to make his bride(Angela Bassett). He enlists the help of bumbling flunky Julius Jones(Kadeem Hardison) to help him find her and has to deal with an obstacle in the form of a cop named Justice(Allen Payne).

Eddie Murphy does well as Maximillian and Angela Bassett as well as Rita Veder and Allen Payne does well also. The thing that stops it from reaching its full potential is the clumsy direction of Wes Craven. Eddie is funny as usual but Kadeem Hardison couldn't have been more annoying. Even John Weatherspoon fails to gather up laughs and he was hilarious in Boomerang. If it was treated as a horror flick and left out the comedy it could have worked...maybe. For those who are saying that this is a spoof...come again? Vampire In Brooklyn takes itself too seriously to be a spoof. All in all Vampire in Brooklyn is only recommended to those that want to keep everything Eddie made before he went with these family-oriented flicks.

The problem is they tried to do both, a comedy and a horror story, and neither carried off very well. Murphy does do an excellent job as Maximillian (the lead role), and it might be one of his better performances. The other characters he played (a preacher and an Italian thug) were substandard. While Murphy's performance was great, the rest of the cast was wooden. Kadeem Hardison and John Witherspoon are the comic relief in the film.

746943,4,6303965792,"In the 1980s, Eddie Murphy single-handedly recreated the Black Action hero, replacing the old murderous superstud of the 1970s with black characters who depended on their quick wits more than their big guns.  That formula was quickly run dry, however, both by Murphy himself and the imitators he inspired.
So, Eddie intelligently decided that he needed to recreate a forgotten genre of comedy, one which Peter Sellars had mastered in the 60s, and which only Murphy could do today: he would make movies in which he played multiple characters. The Genesis began with ""Coming to America"", in which Murphy played not only the lead role, but also all the inhabitants of a Harlem barbershop. The sequences were short, but Murphy was building the road to becoming the most brilliant character actor of our day. Soon followed the ""Nutty Professor"" movies, ""Bowfinger"", and his animated TV series, ""The PJ's."" In all these Murphy played a multiplicity of roles, and played them all brilliantly (the Academy's disdain for streetwise comedies, and--well, lets just say it--their dismissal of black performers not playing slaves or pimps, are the only explanations possible for Murphy not owning an Oscar or two by now).
With these projects, Eddie was not only playing different characters, but also honing a new Eddie Murphy genre: raunchy, but intelligent; gross, but heartfelt; hilariously over the top in the particulars of plot, but firmly rooted in emotional reality. He has created or has been involved with, some of the arguably best comedies of the 1990's and onward--and has been responsible for inarguably the best comic performances of the era.
So, in this era, Eddie decided to push the envelope by mixing the new Eddie Genre with the Horror films he loved as a kid. The result, ""A Vampire in Brooklyn"", is unsettling to some because the lines between Eddie's wildly improvisational Black (or African American, if you insist) character comedy to straight vampire horror movie are so starkly drawn. There are very few instances where the comedy and horror overlap. This, I feel, is the brilliance of the film. There are no horror moments broken by a punchline or bad joke, and there are no comedy moments punctuated by some kind of sick horror gag (that has been done to death since John Landis' ""American Werewolf in London"". Now its being beated to death by ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""). The funny parts are funny and the scary parts are truly scary.  And Murphy also gets to shine in multiple well-defined character parts as well, as the shape-shifting African Vampire assumes the physical identity of several of his victims.
""Vampire"" failed at the box office not because it was a bad film--its definitely is not. But because it was too unusual a film for the limited abilities of the studio's marketing department to sell. Those going expecting to see a comedy were disappointed it contained so much pure horror, and those going to see it based on the publicity that painted it as a horror film were dissapointed it contained so much hilarious Murphy style comedy. It dies because of false expectations. Eddie's other films contained quick changes in tone as well--the shifts between bathroom comedy and pathos in the Nutty Professor films is no less abrupt than those between horror and comedy in ""Vampire"". It's just that the choice of horror as the second element mixed with the comedy is a more daring and unusual one.
Years from now, ""A Vampire in Brooklyn"" will be viewed as one of the highpoints of the second phase of the Eddie Murphy Genre.",995846400,25,3553,4.9397993311036785

746945,3,6303965792,"When ""Vampire in Brooklyn"" is played for Scares, it is at it's Best, when it is played for Laughs, it Doesn't Work as well. Eddie Murphy creates his 3 most Unmemorable characters for a film that Diverts Attention, but doesn't achieve much else, which is a Shame, because we All Know he can do Better. (""The Nutty Professor"" and ""Coming to America"")
Eddies Much Talked about Leap into Comedy/Horror isn't really as bad as a lot of people make it out to be, it Scares a little, it causes a Snigger or two, and.. Well... It has Eddie Murphy, it can't be That Bad. Let me put it This Way, It's A Little Worse than ""Beverly Hills Cop III"", and it's A Lot Better than ""Holy Man""... Yeah, that pretty much Sums it Up.
Eddie plays Maximillian the Vampire, from an Island in the Bermuda Triangle (which is quite a Clever and Unique way to explain him and his Kind) who comes to the Island of Manhattan in search of a Mate, he Limits his search to Brooklyn, and the film takes it from their. Though Eddie is never really Scary, or Convincingly Evil, he keeps a Straight face and makes the Horror bits work. Though I said about that the three characters he creates are his most Unmemorable, they are Still enjoyable enough to satisfy Eddie's Die Hard fans (the other two characters he plays are the Reverend, and the Italian Stick-up man). Angela Bassett is Above Average in her role as a Troubled Cop, torn between her Job and her Destiny. She never treats the role as Beneath her, and she gives it her All.
The Performances in the Supporting cast are Mixed. Allen Payne is Believable and Likeable as Justice, Angela's Understanding Partner. Kadeem Harrison is Annoying as Julius Jones, Eddie's Ghoul and John Witherspoon is... Well, John Witherspoon as Silas. I find Witherspoon's Humour to be Pathetic, he just Sucks the laughter out of the room Whenever he's on screen. (like he does in ""Little Nicky"", ""Boomerang"" and ""Next Friday"")
Overall, Murphy fans should find a Laugh here and there, and Horror fans should like the Dark mood and Photography. It's not a Great Effort, but it's Not as Bad as Many make it Out to be.",991094400,4,2114,4.551181102362205
