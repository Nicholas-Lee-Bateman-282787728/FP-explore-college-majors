5643541,5,B00BLA94IM,Loved these movies growing up as I child. Would be a better movie combo if Stalag 17 and Great Escape were on the same disc. Saying for the same if The Dirty Dozen and Where Eagles Dare.,1400889600,,186,4.054054054054054

5643545,5,B00BLA94IM,"One of the all time great movies, Stalog 17 is combined with one of the mot amusing war films of all time, The Dirty Dozen. Very good quality for the black & white Stalog 17 that only occasionally shows on Turner Network thus worthy of the purchase. Sralog's drama touched with humor is a classic Billy Wilder film touched by his typical intervals of humor. The film has William Holden at his best and look for James Arness' (Matt Dillion) brother Peter Graves in his best role. The Dirty Dozen is pure entertainment with big stars from crusty Lee Marvin, Ernest Borgnine, Charles Bronson, Clint Walker, Telly Savalas, Richard Jaeckal, George Kennedy,  Donald Sullivan, Robert Ryan, and many more. Contrasting films, heavy and light but a great set.",1374883200,4,749,4.8515625

5643612,5,B00BLA94IM,"This due were purchased with The Dirty Dozen firmly in my mind and it didn't disappoint me, it is an all time classic of high caliber. I purchased two copies, one for me and one for my sister who desired to have Stalag 17 in her collection. I was surprised by its quality when I viewed it. It is not as action filled as most movies that I prefer to watch but I would give it a 4 star rating despite that. It isn't so much an action picture as it is a psychological drama and that is not the genre that I prefer so perhaps it will be enjoyed more by people who prefer that category. I think that in both movies there is good character development and a cohesive and comprehendible plot, I just prefer action movies more than I do dramas such as Stalag 17.",1424563200,,754,4.101351351351352

5643625,5,B00BLA94IM,"In STALAG 17 Billy Wilder's interesting direction is both amusing, but ultimately ironic in this cat and mouse death struggle as American POWs arrange escapes from Stalag 17 that continually seemed to be sabotaged by an insider. William Holden plays an interesting character who represents the individual and whose logical mind and qualities of self perseverance are not shared for the overall good of the allied community represented in the microcosmic prisoner barracks. William Holden methodically holds back and even declines to openly rebuff the accusations that he is collaborating with the Nazis. Holden is a noble maverick akin to Ayn Rand's architect Howard Roark in THE FOUNTAINHEAD in some ways. On the other hand, Holden is very unlike George Segal's KING RAT (1965) directed by Bryan Forbes. Holden's intellect and sensibility rises above the mob mentality and awakes the dormant thought processes of his weary fellow prisoners to ferret out the real collaborator in their ranks. Thus, American ingenuity and know how are never really lost but are realized once again thanks to Holden's efforts. Holden's performance is very subtle but very powerful as is the message of Billy Wilder's film.

Such rousing sentiment endears the THE DIRTY DOZEN to so many of us. It has come and gone many years ago, but the legacy of that Dirty Dozen and the lives they touched lives on. Major Reisman, Wladislaw, Franko, Posey, Maggott... they live on. This film is timeles. This was a ground breaking film. This is an endearing film. The sounds of screeching steel along dirt roads and snow covered terrain and the distant sound of the daring heroics smashing their way to freedom, victory and more have long been silent, but the legends of these extraordinary and endearing films lingers on in our memory and give us hope that evil shall always be vanquished with a bit of tongue in cheek along the way. They just don't make them like this any more. The scripting, the rousing and memorable moving scores, the cinematography, the actors and the characters they played are indelibly etched into the psyche and the best part of our youth. I often have fleeting thoughts of these films, happy ones, of the images, the words and the music from these WWII legends. The examination of camaraderie, the morality of killing and not killing, bravery, survival, betrayal, forgiveness and getting the job done are all integrated into a logical and emotional cohesive film that is both entertaining, yet ever important in its representation of the extraordinary human qualities that can only be realized during war. Major Reisman, Wladislaw, Franko, Posey, Maggott, Jiminez, Jefferson, Pinkley...

STALAG 17 and THE DIRTY DOZEN are 2 memorable and endearing WWII films with a unique perspective. Their tongue in cheek approach further emphasizes the courage of men to rise to the occasion to get the job done and at great cost. That is the dichotomy and tragedy of war. WWII in particular seemed to hone in on the American spirit for that singular effort to vanquish evil personified by Nazi Germany. William Holden's Sgt. J.J. Sefton and the men of the Dirty Dozen are now icons of the cinema and they are also part of the breed of cinematic WWII heroes that have captured our hearts and minds as they did their part to keep the world free from tyranny and despair. And they did with such style and a wink in the eye and made us all stand up and cheer.",1416355200,,3440,4.90893470790378
5643626,3,B00BLA94IM,Bought this for my dad since they're some of his favorite war movies. Stalag 17 looked so good. It was in 4:3 ratio but the quality was what I wanted from a Blu Ray. The Dirty Dozen was a huge disappointment though. Some scenes looked AMAZING remastered but half the movie wasn't remastered to Blu Ray quality at all. It kept switching back and forth from remastered to unremastered with each scene. It actually was annoying.,1415923200,19,425,4.605263157894737
