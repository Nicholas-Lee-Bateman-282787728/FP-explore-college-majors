7689316,2,B01CS7D7K2,"This review is for the March 2017 Steelbook Blu-ray:

I hate to give this a bad review. The packaging is nice, the picture looks great. (It uses the original video, not the 2.0 update).

The only problem is the subtitles are full of punctuation and grammar errors, and a lot of sentences look as if the writer has only a passing familiarity with English. I kind of want to return it, but I think I'll keep it for the steelbook packaging.

I haven't watched the English dub.",1489708800,14,473,4.413793103448276
7689317,1,B01CS7D7K2,"I thought they might have finally made a good Ghost in the Shell blu-ray what-with the fancy cover and all, but they didn't. This is a shamefully bad release. The subtitles are rife with grammatical errors and nonsense sentences. Getting really tired of Anchor Bay doing such a poor job. Don't buy this.",1489708800,12,303,4.735849056603773
7689318,5,B01CS7D7K2,It's the same disc but different artwork on steelbook and disc. No special features. English dub can sometimes hard to hear clearly.,1489708800,,132,5.045454545454546
7689319,3,B01CS7D7K2,"After carefully comparing the 2017 Anchor Bay steelbook release to Ghost in the Shell 2.0, and the original Ghost in the Shell Limited Edition DVDs, I'd like provide some information in an effort to help others who may be considering buying this make an informed decision.

The video in this release, while inconsistent in quality, is definitely an upgrade from the original DVD (and a tremendous improvement over the original version of the film included with Ghost in the Shell 2.0).

The audio in this release is sufficient but has less options than previous releases. I noted no problems with the English dub with the exception of a few lines (while the Major and Togusa are speaking near the beginning) in which the major seemed unusually quiet. The Japanese audio is essentially as I've always remembered it with no issues to report. It is worth noting that the English subtitles seem to be similar and yet considerably inferior to those used in the Ghost in the Shell 2.0 release.

The steelbook packaging, slip cover, and disc look quite nice. Pictures truly don't do them justice. The digital version included was a nice touch.

In summary, it is a fairly nice release, however I would advise anyone who wishes to watch it in Japanese with English subtitles to hang onto your DVDs (or watch Ghost in the shell 2.0 if you enjoy it).",1489622400,3,1340,4.762931034482759
7689320,5,B01CS7D7K2,"This is a very cool way to have ghost in the shell, the steelbook is worth your money.

that being said it's the same exact disc that's in the 25th anniversary edition of the movie, there's nothing to really be gained here other than cooler packaging.",1483920000,3,251,4.456521739130435
7689321,3,B01CS7D7K2,"Like everyone else has said, this is not exactly what was advertised. This is simply a rerelease of the 25th anniversary edition of GitS in a nice new SteelBook case but does NOT include the booklet found in the original release.",1475020800,,229,4.609756097560975
7689322,2,B01CS7D7K2,">>Includes a Limited Edition Collectible 24-page book featuring an interview with Director Mamoru Oshii.

No, it doesn't include any such booklet. -1 star. This is false advertising. Sure, it's just a booklet, but it's supposed to include an interview, and the UK version includes it. Why not the US? Waited a year for this release and no booklet. I should have bough the UK version.

I am very disappointed in this release. Why was it called 25th anniversary? It's just a plain BD with no extras of any kind. Not a single bonus track or anything! No commentary, nothing special at all, just the movie in HD, with quite a few scenes that look upscaled.

The audio was screwy in many places, dropping by like half volume and then going back up again. I had my TV cranked way up for this (no 5.1 system at present, not even a sound bar). -1 star.

The visual quality was quite good, mostly. I also own 2.0 and it seems better to me than this release, although I was glad to have the original non-CGI version again. This is better than the old DVD but for an all-new BD release, 25th anniversary marketing, shouldn't it come with something?

The English subtitles are a DISASTER. Not a single word lines up with the dialogue in the film. Not a single sentence is as it should be. Not just a few mistakes, but a completely messed up translation that makes no sense most of the time. I'm glad this has English dub. If you're a hardcore fan who likes JP + subs, this will disappoint. Hard to even follow the action with such screwy language. -1 star.

I'm giving this 2 stars for the poor production quality of the release. They've had a whole year to redo the 25th anniversary disc and this is just the same stock. It's not worth $17. Get this when it drops to under $10 for a plain BD. What a boring release. What a missed opportunity. I'm irritated. I was irritated already that there's no BD of Stand Alone Complex yet, and likely never will for US market. Now this.",1461024000,16,1964,4.411602209944752
7689323,3,B01CS7D7K2,"Like steelbooks? Cool. Buy this.

If you have the previous Blu-ray (the 25th Anniversary edition released last year to be exact), well, it's the exact same thing. Weird subs and some weird sound effects issues on the English track (that only happen like twice.) So yeah, if you bought this last year, you'd be buying it again just for the case.

If you're a stupid Ghost in the Shell fan (like me) who pretty much just buys almost everything anyways, you'll love this, probably just for the case. Everyone else who bought this already and doesn't care about steelbooks, well, don't buy it because you already bought it,",1460764800,14,619,4.722222222222222
7689324,3,B01CS7D7K2,I ordered two of these steelbooks. I just got them and there is no 24 page collectible booklet that came with either one as it was advertised. I don't know if it's false advertising and it doesn't come with the book or if I just didn't get it. I'm going to have to contact Amazon.,1460592000,13,280,4.109090909090909
7689325,3,B01CS7D7K2,"I watched this film as a teen and it just never hit me with the same level of emotional impact as ""Akira"" did for example.

Beautifully animated--especially considering the release date--and crafted with a reverence that resonates in the attention to detail and the stark beauty of the characters, locations, vehicles, and motions. Unfortunately the story just didn't connect with me again this time. This harkened back to my teenage experience and vindicated what I had grown to believe had been a youthful snap-judgement.

At the end of the film we are left with a completely new character that we have no meaningful investment in.

Acolytes of this critically acclaimed fan favorite are sure to enjoy this purchase. Case is clean and cool. Comes with a digital copy.",1495843200,,769,4.9921875

7689329,5,B01CS7D7K2,"I bought this for the amazing Mondo artwork on a Steelbook, so, I didn't pay any attention to bonus features. There are NO bonus features on this disc. It's just the movie. I guess I just assumed it would port features from past releases. So if you like great art only, this is the one to buy.",1492128000,2,293,4.157894736842105
7689330,5,B01CS7D7K2,"There are a number of films making their way to the big screen these days that are either remakes or sequels to other popular films. Most become franchise films, movies that can turn into a series of films based on consumers being familiar with the title and thus ensuring that there are people ready to line up and buy tickets. Some view this as a good thing, others hate it. It all depends on how familiar you are with the original and how much it means to you.

Such will be the case when GHOST IN THE SHELL starring Scarlett Johansson comes out soon. Some will be drawn to it seeing the visuals on display in the trailer and some will come because they are fans of Johansson. But a certain number of those patrons will be there because they are fans of anime and the original telling of this story that was released in 1995. If you are unfamiliar with it then now is the time to pick up the original as Anchor Bay is releasing the original film with special packaging this week.

For those unfamiliar with the term anime it is a Japanese animated motion picture that is geared towards adults more so than children, often based on manga or Japanese comics, again aimed at adults. GHOST IN THE SHELL was one of the most popular at one time and ranks highly among the fans of the genre.

The story revolves around a counter-cyberterrorist group known as Public Security Section 9 and its best agent, Major Motoko Kusanagi. Major is not an ordinary agent though. She is a cyborg, mostly machine but part human as well. The term ghost refers to this as it refers to what others would call her soul, the human part of her that has been integrated into this body she now uses, enhanced with biomechanics.

This first story revolves around Section 9 trying to track down and capture someone known only at the Puppet Master. The Puppet Master essentially hacks into various people who have been cybernetically enhanced and then using them to commit various crimes, most often connected with stealing information and secrets from the government. Once he finishes with them he drops his connection leaving behind someone with no clue what is and isn't real in their minds any longer.

As Major and Section 9 track down the Puppet Master they think theyve caught their man, sort of. What they have is the remnants of a cyborg that he has transferred his ghost into. But before they can discover just what is really going on another section moves in to retrieve the cyborg. Even then things change as the Puppet Master finds a way to avoid capture and reach out the Major at the same time. Whether she will reach out to find what is really going on or not isn't revealed until the last portion of the film.

The movie is a visual feast for the eyes with so much to look at that youll never want to take your eyes off the screen. Displays of the world of the future mingle with non-stop action sequences that make you wonder how the live-action film will be able to repeat what you see here (though clips so far look like they may have it down). The closest I can come to describing it is to suggest the film BLADE RUNNER and the cityscapes found in that film.

While watching the film you find yourself so caught up in the story that youll soon forget the fact that this is an animated feature. It draws you into the story that well and holds you there, rooting for the good guys, trying to figure out just who the real bad guys are and wondering when it comes to robots down the line will they possess a soul or not? Since they are created by man, can that be a possibility? This is one of the best science fiction films in years because it isn't just about the technology on hand but what lies beneath as well.

As I said it is geared towards adults to expect nudity and extreme violence to be found. Nothing lewd but it is there. For this reason I wouldnt recommend it for children. But for adults this is a movie worth seeking out and for science fiction fans one worth adding to your collection.",1491609600,,3991,4.4056987788331075
7689331,5,B01CS7D7K2,"I'll only be talking about the packaging of the movie and not the movie itself. I do not know how the quality of the movie itself is (subtitle issues, audio issues, etc.).

This is an absolutely wonderful steelbook of the Ghost in the Shell. The steelbook comes with a very nice sleeve and it also comes with a digital copy of the movie which you can redeem before December 31, 2018 (31/12/18).

I don't think there are any extras included in this edition, if that's your thing you might want to consider getting the DVD version instead:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghost-in-the-Shell-Special-Edition/dp/B0002RQ2T4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghost in the Shell (Special Edition)</a>

8754078,4,B01CS7D7K2,"Great Anime like this one which premise went on to influence movies like ""The Matrix"" deserve to be preserved and given the all-star treatment on Blu Ray and that's what we get here with a very impressive steelbook release that comes with a beautiful slip case as well.  The picture and sound qualities have been enhanced over the previous standard definition DVD.  Steelbook collectors will be pleased and this suggests to me that the value of this release probably has a lot more upside value so it may be a good idea to get this now before they are sold out.  I would rank this, ""Akira"" and ""Spirited Away"" among the all-time Anime greats with ""Akira"" probably taking top place.

Great value for a great anime on Blu Ray; highly recommended!",1510704000,,744,4.656488549618321
8754079,5,B01CS7D7K2,"Reviewing the Mondo Steelbook version. Excellent transfer. It doesn't seem heavily remastered, which means imperfections can be seen (specks and such from the production). This is good or not so good (definitely not bad) depending on your expectations. To me, it made the film feel more authentic. Overall it looks fantastic. The subtitles are good, though you can tell it was made by a British individual, with terminology such as ""rubbish truck"" instead of ""garbage truck"" in the USA, and slang terms like ""yobbo"" being used. But these are very minor details, and overall the translation seems competent, but I'm not an expert on what a perfect translation might be for this movie. I didn't notice any typos or glaring deficiencies, but people can argue endlessly over the minutiae of translation.

One other thing to point out, some reviews I've read (both here and elsewhere) talk about black borders in this edition. The copy I received had no much borders during the movie. Maybe this is an issue with 4k TVs or something, or they fixed the problem in later releases, or some other factor I'm not aware of. Regardless, everything looks great on my set, which is a modest 1080p Insignia TV.

The movie itself needs no review from me, it's one of the best films ever created. Acquire a tangible copy of this masterpiece. The Mondo steelbook version looks great, both the movie and the case.",1507334400,2,1394,4.852941176470588
8754080,5,B01CS7D7K2,Modo Steelbook.  We - my daughter and I thought the steelbook version was fantastic and the SURROUND audio in english improved the movie sooo much.  The music is excellent and I've never hear a version that really sounds this good.  I would think it's the essential english version.  The sound is great and the video is great.  in this case sucks to be Japanese (stereo only).  I watched it a short while back DVD and was kind of going dated.... the fantastic audio revitalized it for me! Got to Got to Have! I like the look of the package too.
