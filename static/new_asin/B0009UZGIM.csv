I did not feel this movie was hilarious, or one I would like to see repeatedly, but it was a good, light hearted movie which I enjoyed once and might enjoy twice.",1117238400,5,298,4.137931034482759

2322252,2,B0009UZGIM,"While watching this, I realized something.  You know you're getting older when everything you see starts reminding you of something you've seen before, that you liked a lot better.

At best, this film is basically a half-assed 'Say Anything' knock-off.  At worst, you'll want to hang yourself watch Peete and Kutcher try and ""out-cute"" one another.  The truth, however, always seems to be somewhere in the middle.

Myself ... I'll take Lloyd Dobler and Diane Court any day over this fluff.",1114992000,11,489,4.987654320987654
2322253,4,B0009UZGIM,"When you think of Ashton Kutcher, you're apt to think of a movie like... ""Dude Where's My Car?"", which in my opinion was not the best of films.  It's hard to believe, but a romantic comedy such as this was actually quite enjoyable.  It starts off kind of slow, but it becomes absorbing as the movie continues on.  Warning to all the guys out there though, this is pretty much a chick flick.  I'm a guy, but I happen to enjoy the soft subtle love story every now and then.

The movie begins seven years ago when a man named Oliver (Kutcher) sees a girl named Emily (Amanda Peet) break up with her boyfriend just before a flight to New York.  They're both on a flight to New York.  When Oliver has to go into the bathroom to clean up, he's followed by Emily.  This is the first of several encounters they'll have over the years.

As the two explore New York, they have a chance to get to know one another.  A few things in the beginning start off a little too slow, Oliver tries to go after Emily and she contantly shuns him away.  Three strikes within the first twenty minutes of the film, and Oliver already strikes out.

Oliver also starts off as the sort of guy no girl in their right mind would want.  He still lives with his parents, he has no car, and he's unemployed.  The only thing he has is his charm.  The two finally decide on a bet that in six years he won't live with his parents and he'll be successful.  They drink to it, and Oliver gives up his parents phone number, claiming that when she calls, she won't find him.  Throughout the film, those six years will pass.

The film first jumps about three years into the future in which Emily's boyfriend has just walked out on her on New Years.  There's a party and she has no one to go with now.  Flipping through her phonebook, she comes across Oliver's number and decides to give him a call.  This is just the first of several times over the years they'll meet up.  Most of the time, however, it's by chance.

Surprisingly, the movie didn't disappoint me.  There were some cliches, such as when Oliver gives Emily a serenade in front of all her neighbors, and when Oliver and Emily finally decide they love each other, but then realize that ""someone"" is getting in the way.

I was also surprised that Ashton Kutcher did a fine acting job.  I'm not a Kutcher fan, and I'm used to seeing him in stupid comedies.  However, this film was sweet, and he did a good job.

Probably what I didn't like about this movie is that it's supposed to be a romantic comedy, but there aren't a whole lot of funny parts.  It has its moments, but they're too few and far between.  There's also the fact that the movie is just feels long.  Some of the more tender moments are great, but the softer parts seem to be ""fillers"" to get the movie going more.

It was surprisingly good.  If you want a decent love story, this is a good film.  Not for comedy fans, and not for your stereotypical man.  It IS a ""chickflick"" so guys, the warning here is, you may not like it.",1114819200,22,3009,4.265486725663717
2322254,1,B0009UZGIM,"A note to Ashton : Dear Ashton, why do you insist on playing the same roles over and over again?  The first weekend out and it only grossed seven million dollars which by all acounts is considered a major flop indeed. Movies that gross over twenty million in its first week is consdered average. I predict this movie will not have the legs to last 3 weeks in the cinemas and will quickly go to video. This was a very tedious, poor written movie starring perhaps one of the most boring actors ever to grace the silver screen. Ashton is no longer, not that he ever was, a big Hollywood draw. He is utterly unlikeable and annoying much in the same vain an adult who carries on like an infant is. Sorry, but you need to start considering other roles or you will be back in Iowa picking corn before you know it.",1114387200,16,806,4.26797385620915
2322255,5,B0009UZGIM,"I'm not a big fan of chick flicks since I find the majority of them fairly stupid, unrealistic and cheesy...but I was very entertained by this one. The humor wasn't forced or overdone instead it seemed effortless or almost on accident which made it real and more true to life. Ashton was absolutely adorable and the whole story was very sweet and relatable. I rarely buy movies, but I'm looking forward to buying this one. I recommend it 100%",1114214400,8,442,4.6075949367088604
2322256,5,B0009UZGIM,"This movie is cute and entertaining, totally watchable if you just want to go to the movies to have fun.  The script is well-written, and the actors do a great job of portraying the goofballs they're supposed to be.  Now, this movie will not get any awards anytime soon or make it on the Top 100 lists of any kind, but it's one of those movies that will stick with you forever.  A great watch!  Trust me, when you've been working in the movie industry for a long time, it's nice to be able to see a movie made just for the sake of having fun.",1114128000,6,542,4.084905660377358

2322427,5,B0009UZGIM,"This is one of the best romantic comedies I've ever seen. Too many others of these movies contain too much bathroom humor (of one kind or another) and references toward sex. It's enough to make you sick! A Lot Like Love has only a very small amount of this. Ashton Kutcher and Amanda Peet just work so well together in this film and there is something about them that just seems right. Something that holds you captive, like a helpless paper clip to a magnet! Perhaps it is the naturality of how they interact with each other. Maybe it is because they fit so well into every scene and scenario this movie has to offer up. And, not to mention, they are really adorable together! Anyhow, to put it shortly, whoever decided to put these two as the leads made a good decision; the feelings they exude are all very much alive and with the way Ashton and Amanda play off eachother you'd think they'd been friends for years before A Lot Like Love. From the moment their eyes first met you KNEW, and I think they did too, that some awesome force was about to rock their world! Their cute sparring and playful flirting are so much fun to watch and each time one does or says something goofy, you die laughing alongside them. Take the car scene where they are stuffing their faces with cheetos and pie; the looks on their faces are priceless and Amanda is laughing so hard you think she might choke! They are having such a blast and none of their laughter is in any way a cheesy staged act. Another priceless and incredibly sweet scene is their night in the national park (I didn't say this had NO inappropriatness...just a little! And it's easily overlooked by how real-feeling Ashton and Amanda make this scene seem.) This is such a cute movie! If you're up for laughs and some good natured romance this is the film for you. Even the guys will like it!",1464825600,3,1844,4.426470588235294

2322436,5,B0009UZGIM,"This is a very under-rated and under-appreciated film. I love this movie; I would definitely rank it in my top 5 favorite chick-flicks up there with Love Actually, The Notebook, and 500 Days of Summer. Does a beautiful job following the development of two seemingly very different characters: growing up, getting their first jobs, facing set-backs and failed relationships, all the while never losing that special (albeit largely irresolute) connection to one another. I particularly enjoyed the soundtrack, the beautiful scene in the desert, and the shout-out to the deaf community.",1460592000,2,583,5.417582417582418

2322440,5,B0009UZGIM,"This is one of my favorite movies.  It's a movie I can watch over and over again.  It really makes you think about the ""what ifs"" in life and how one random choice can move you further away from someone or closer to them.

Each character had a lot of growing up to do and really had to get their heads straight before they could be what other needs.  Each time they meet up there is something keeping them from being able to be together but at the same time, it wouldn't have worked at the time anyways.

This story line reminded me a lot of my old best friend and I.  We were great friends and great together but each time we came across one another over the years, one or the other was in a relationship.  Neither of us got our ""happily ever after"" though.  We're not even friends anymore.  When feelings come into a friendship it makes it harder to stay on a friendship level.

I was happy to use my promotional credits on this movie!",1457740800,,937,4.184357541899441
2322441,5,B0009UZGIM,"It's such a dumb, silly movie, but it doesn't market itself as anything besides that anyway.

As IMDB writes:

""On a flight from Los Angeles to New York, Oliver and Emily make a connection, only to decide that they are poorly suited to be together. Over the next seven years, however, they are reunited time and time again, they go from being acquaintances to close friends to ... lovers?""

Man, that's an awful but accurate description. The thing though is that you root for them. You KNOW this is a ""s***ty"" romantic comedy and that they will eventually get together but you still root for them. You KNOW that. But this movie does such a good job of SHOWING you just WHY they will be such great fits for one another. This movie shows them at their worst and at their best and the unsaid message is so poignant and sweet--just, that life's too short to not try to find that connection, which may be right in front of you.

It does a great job (Ashton Kutcher and Amanda Peet do convey this too) of slowly showing you WHY and HOW the two characters are drawn to each other. First, Oliver's a smitten puppy and Emily's aloof, but as Emily grows she realizes that he is what she really wants too. This is unlike other romantic comedies where half the time the characters are COMPLETELY incompatible but it makes for good passion. The slow plot development makes me think of ""When Harry Met Sally.""

I'm not a big fan of the ending. It was a bit silly, but the rest of the movie carries it to 5 stars.",1457654400,,1498,4.374100719424461

My favorite scenes are the restaurant scene where they refuse to speak to each other - FUNNY!

2322618,4,B0009UZGIM,"This is one of the best love stories you're likely to find on film. Amanda Peet is brilliant in this role. Quirky and utterly convincing. Kutcher is excellent as well, but I did not appreaciate his acting until the second viewing. And he does not match the level delivered by Peet. This is a very nuanced screenplay, so much so that it's hard to take it all in during the first viewing. Most viewers will get a lot out of a second viewing.

The one weakness is the early airplane scene. It has Peet throwing herself at Kutcher in an airline restroom (can you imagine the smell?) and before they have even met. It's so ridiculously unbelievable, and so insulting to viewers' intelligence that I nearly turned the movie off the first time I saw it on pay-per-view. The good news is that it's worth suffering through one ridiculous scene to get on with a fine film.

Another, but minor weakness is that the screenwriter could have done a lot more with the final scene. It's satisfying but lame. Kutcher's dialogue here is cliched when it needs to rise to something memorable, something with emotional gravity.",1360195200,,1106,4.637755102040816

Every time someone asks me what I would recommend for a chick flick, I ALWAYS tell them about this one! And surprisingly, no one has ever heard of it!",1356652800,,383,4.333333333333333

Two of my favorite parts are when they don't talk to each other and eat at a Chineese restaurant and spit water at each other...so funny. The other one is when he's talking about his ex and they are driving in the car, she starts singing song and makes the radio louder and louder and he keeps talking louder and louder and it's just hillarious!!!!

This is a comparable role (not the supper silly dude he loves to play). This movie is a serious dramatic comedy. Worth the $$.,1312416000,,247,4.391304347826087
2322639,5,B0009UZGIM,"I love this movie.  Judge me all you want - it's a great movie!  I love a cheesy chick-flick, but I wouldn't really classify this movie as such.  It's more than that - it's deeper somehow.  I'm not going to lie - it has its moments, but it's an honest and frank look at relationships and destiny.  Timing is everything - and I really believe that.

The story follows Oliver (Ashton Kutcher) and Emily (Amanda Peet) - and begins 7 years in the past.  The unlikely pair meet on an airplane - Oliver a straight-laced college graduate and Emily, a chain-smoking, grunge-rock free spirit.  They join the mile high club and then spend the day together in New York, where Oliver reveals his grand plans to Emily over double shots of Jack Daniels and a pitcher of beer.  In 5 years time, maybe 6, he will have his ducks in a row (or in a LINE), be a successful businesman, wealthy, and have a beautiful wife.  He gives Emily his parents' phone number, tells her to call him in 6 years time so he can prove himself to her, and he can give her his address where she can mail him the $50 he won.

Fast forward a few years later, Emily is dumped by her boyfriend, and finds herself alone on New Year's Eve.  While digging through her little black book trying to round up a date, she stumbles upon Oliver's phone number, calls him up, and thus begins a series of choice encounters the two will share over the next several years.  Everytime they reconnect, they are in different stages of their lives - both looking for something, but the timing is never right, yet a deep bond is formed that keeps them seeking out each other.

The movie is warm, funny, and oddly touching.  One of my all time favorites.  And the soundtrack is great to boot!  The first time I saw this movie, I caught the last 45 minutes or so on HBO and just knew I had to watch it..... so I bought it on Amazon.  I've watched it countless times since, and many friends have borrowed it as well.  Give it a try...... I'm sure you'll feel something.... and if not - hey, you got to see Ashton/Amanda standing in the buff - it's a win/win situation!",1298851200,,2103,4.305343511450381
2322640,5,B0009UZGIM,"This film flew under the radar screen on it's release, but was a delightful find.  The film is well-written, has a great score, and includes great performances by Ashton Kutcher and Amanda Peete. You really see the chemistry develop between these two, at first, unlikely friends and lovers.  Kutcher is believable as a kid growing into adulthood, and Peete plays the tough girl who is looking for love.  We trace their on-again and off-again encounters, while they try to figure out life.  I guarantee you will enjoy this movie.",1296345600,2,528,4.898876404494382

2322644,5,B0009UZGIM,"Great Movie(2005),Reminds me what I did when I was younger musician & unexperienced person,really got me. The DO's & Don'ts in life. Youthfulness is only one time-deal,your other half only give you one chance in the LIFETIME for your ""true Love"",so becareful when you say ""No"" to that person or your will regret your decision for life..(Love only knock once at your door)& then will be too late...otherwise you end-up marrying the wrong person......THE PLOT>>""A couple are reunited time and time again, they go from being acquaintances to close friends to be... lovers or friends again?"" Amanda Peet is terrific & Ashton Kutcher was perfect to play that Character/.Go and see it with an open mind and, if you have a heart, then you'll love it....I think it reflects perfectly how love could be in the real life. This a movie about a comedy-romance that everybody should watch.

I love the playfulness between these characters. Though their characters change in terms of career plans, priorities, and wardrobe (Emily does a 180 in the wardrobe department), they still act like the same pair of kids who had the spontaneous tryst in the airplane bathroom.

Oliver is determined to undo the ""three strikes"" against him that have prejudiced Emily against him from the get-go (at least the two that he can control).  He learns to play the guitar well enough to serenade Emily with a Bon Jovi song (or as my friends and I used to say in college, a bon jovial song), and it turns out Oliver did sort of make the first move afterall, if you count taking a photograph of a perfect stranger ""the first move.""

This movie is simultaneously formulaic and original. It was fun and zany. I was swooning over Ashton (eye candy if ever there was); I couldn't help it, he's too darn cute.

The chemistry between Peet and Kutcher is sexy and endearing. Kutcher really proves himself than being just a goofball in previous films and Peet really shows her range as an actress (I think she is so under-rated sometimes!) The story is about two strangers who meet on an airplane and don't meet until several years later, and then meet again many years after that as well.

Even the music is good. Ashton Kutcher does an excellent job playing Oliver, the man with the 6 year plan for the perfect life. Amanda Peet is extremely entertaining as the phantom girlfriend, here today and gone tomorrow, only to reconnect a few years later again and again. Amanda and Ashton are clearly having a genuinely good time together as they make this film, and you see that it's real when you watch the bloopers in the extra features.

Unfortunately, the comparisons do not benefit this film given the colorless way that first-time screenwriter Colin Patrick Lynch has spelled out the formulaic elements of the story. An additional burden falls on the attractive leads, Ashton Kutcher and Amanda Peet, neither of whom seem fully formed as screen personas with any gravitas to keep us interested in the hapless characters they portray.

Directed by Nigel Cole in a relatively adroit manner, the episodic story centers on Oliver and Emily, a case study in opposites who begin an unexpected relationship with a bathroom fling on a transcontinental flight to New York. They have a day-long romantic whirl once they touch ground but soon part with no expectation of seeing each other again. This episode represents the ongoing structure of the plot, as they continue to meet up again and again over the course of seven years, experiencing the inevitable sparks but allowing professional and romantic complications to act as a perpetual barrier to any lasting commitment.

Contrived plot turns as presented here could be at least redeemed by the charms of the stars, but this is a stumbling block. As he showed in 2005's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Guess-Who/dp/B0009RCPUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Guess Who</a>, Kutcher is simply too lightweight a presence on the big screen. Even though he achieves moments of subtlety, the overall effect he achieves is blandness. Looking a tad mature for her partner, Peet fares marginally better simply because her character arc seems more developed. Together they make a charming couple but hardly memorable nor emotionally resonant. The DVD comes with an equally colorless commentary track from Cole and producers Armyan Bernstein and Kevin Messick, along with a brief blooper reel, four deleted scenes of minimal interest, and a music video, ""Brighter Than Sunshine"", performed by Aqualung, one of many trendy artists featured on the soundtrack.",1176768000,,2859,7.073446327683616

I think there are some universal themes that make this a really decent movie.  I was never a big Aston Kucher fan but I really like the way he portrayed his character.  I ended up really rooting for him.  Amanda Peet is obviously very easy on the eyes, and she does a very nice job of showing depth and vulnerability.  I really like the ending.  I did not find it predictable, and I have seen so many movies where you get the feeling that the writer just ran out of energy, but I did not get that vibe at all with this movie.

2322696,4,B0009UZGIM,"We saw this one on a whim, being suckers for any movie with a vague title.  In fact I think we thought we were watching LOVE ACTUALLY until about halfway through the film when we realized we hadn't seen anyone playing British.  Amanda Peet is so charming on STUDIO 60 ON THE SUNSET STRIP that I figured this was worth a look.  She starts out the movie as a mess, sort of like Nancy in SID AND NANCY with dark red hair, garish raccoon makeup, and a blowsy attitude that culminates when she walks in on Ashton in the bathroom and has sex with him without a single word spoken.  She is just appalling!

However this tough girl act is just a front, it turns out, and she really misses her mom, who died young and who she visits in a NY cemetery.  The tragedy of the mom's death is the reason for all of Emily's problems which, we find out over the course of years, are manifold.  She has as many problems as there are fish in the ocean.  She can't get the blandly attractive, commitment-phobic writer Peter out of her heart, and she breaks down every time she sees him with another girl.  Well, no wonder, Peter is played by Gabriel Mann, the sort of actor you've seen a million times and he never became a star.  As he ages he is developing an unfortunate resemblance to Nancy Kulp who played Miss Hathaway on TV's BEVERLY HILLBILLIES.  In fact if they ever do one of those BEHIND THE SCENES TV movies about THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES they should get Gabriel Mann's agent on the phone.

What is it with having sex on plane bathrooms anyhow?  I've never been in one large enough to have sex with myself in it.

The movie culminates when Oliver (Ashton Kutcher) stumbles into a photo gallery in Los Feliz and recognizes himself as the nude man embracing the nude woman in one of Emily's long ago photos taken in the Mojave or somewhere.  What they needed for this computer generated photo of Ashton's butt was a stunt double whose butt looked anything like Ashton's but instead they got (I assume) Gabriel Mann to stand in.  Sorry, wrong number!",1165363200,3,2037,4.406417112299465

All by the time he's 30.

In the meantime, he and Emily don't see each other for years. Lather they meet, connect, and find that either distance or timing (or both) keeps separating him.

A Lot Like Love is a movie about finding love at all the wrong times and in all the wrong places; about how after our plans might fail, we can still find what we were looking for. This is a sweet, funny movie that I think most people will enjoy.",1164758400,2,712,4.227941176470588
2322698,2,B0009UZGIM,"Ashton & Emma nearly prevail in this fairly light-weight and not-quite-funny romantic comedy.  He's an almost entrepreneur while she's nearly a successful photographer.  They meet and nearly hit it off several times over the course of 6 years, remaining unhappy with their actual chosen mates and chosen fates until the last few minutes of the movie when more than cuteness brings them together and we all realize that true love has won out at last.

Peet is adorable, while Kutcher looks as refreshingly un-Hollywood as ever.  What sinks this movie is that it's not really so much a story as a bunch of nearly linked scenes, none of them all that deep or funny.  Our heroes meet but manage not to fall in love, and that's basically it.  We've seen this story for years, and nobody's made a real go of it since ""Harry met Sally"", which was wise enough to grace our leads with witty and intelligent sidekicks.  The dynamics of Peet & Kutcher's non-Romance seem shoehorned or artificially twisted to fit a screenplay which needs to keep the two apart until the final shot.  The two go through years of contact and non-contact but never seem to learn anything from their encounters. (Strangely for a story that stretches over 6 years, the characters and the world they live in seem remarkably unchanged, especially given how they straddle the internet age.)  The most telling scene in this flick has our leads singing along (badly at that) to a Chicago song while driving across the desert.  While it's my personal opinion that it's a horrible song, it doesn't look like the characters liked the song either or were the sing-along type or even following any motivation at all - they were just acting according to movie-cute rules.  They don't look like they like the song, so their singing it seems as arbitrary as the rest of the story.",1162080000,,1834,4.735849056603773
2322699,2,B0009UZGIM,"A LOT LIKE LOVE is a clichd supposedly romantic drama about a couple of almost-thirty-somethings that stars Ashton Kutcher and Amanda Peet. That pretty much sums up the movie there, but I'll extrapolate.

Let's face it. Ashton Kutcher really isn't an actor. He's kind of like Tom Cruise, just a guy playing himself over and over and over again in movie after movie. These movies have different plots and are in different genres, but Kutcher's the same as he was three movies before. Granted he might have a bit more intensity in one movie or he might give off an aurora of charm in another or maybe he seems a tiny bit fragile in another, but it's still just Kutcher being Kutcher, with no real acting involved. Don't get me wrong, I like some of Kutcher's stuff--he did a decent job in THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT and he gave candid camera an edge in PUNK'D. But, until he takes some acting lessons and starts to study people who can actually act, Kutcher is always going to be Kutcher.

As for Amanda Peet, well, she's hot. However, like Kutcher, Peet really can't act and if the 10,000 articles written about her most of the characters she has played have just been herself under a different name. Usually she's cast as the beautiful babe with psychotic problems or the woman with an attitude (aka = word that rhymes with witch). Peet isn't a witch in A LOT LIKE LOVE, but her character sure could have some sort of psychological problems going on.

The plot of the movie begins on an airplane. Kutcher plays a guy named Oliver (can you believe it?) and on a plane ride from LA to New York, he meets Emily (Amanda Peet). When Oliver goes to the bathroom to tinkle, Emily sneaks in and gets him to join the mile-high club. After they get to New York they spend a day hanging out together, but after departing don't meet until years later. A couple years later they meet again, have sex, hang out, and separate. The process continues at approximately 1  to 2 year intervals until Amanda, I mean Emily, realizes she love Ashton, I mean Oliver and rushes off to meet him at what she assumes is his wedding.

I guess the filmmakers were trying to make another WHEN HARRY MET SALLY for the ""younger generation"". I really don't like saying that because A LOT LIKE LOVE doesn't even come close to achieving the resonance and connection of WHEN HARRY MET SALLY. At least in WHMS there was some sort of consequences for the actions people made. A LOT LIKE LOVE is in-line with the philosophy of the fantasy world created on the television show FRIENDS where people could pretty much do anything without any consequences in the world.

I could go on and on, but I think the point has been made.

I had heard decent things about the film and watched the movie with as an open mind as I could. I was sadly disappointed and I think most other people will be, too. A LOT LIKE LOVE is basically a movie that a tiny segment of people, mainly female, between the ages of 11-22 will enjoy. Anyone older than that will be able to see through it for the drivel that it is.",1158537600,,3047,4.449820788530466

2322701,5,B0009UZGIM,"This is one of the best romantic comedies I've ever seen.  Too many others of these movies contain too much bathroom humor (of one kind or another) and references toward sex.  It's enough to make you sick!  A Lot Like Love has only a very small amount of this.  Ashton Kutcher and Amanda Peet just work so well together in this film and there is something about them that just seems right.  Something that holds you captive, like a helpless paper clip to a magnet!  Perhaps it is the naturality of how they interact with each other.  Maybe it is because they fit so well into every scene and scenario this movie has to offer up.  And, not to mention, they are really adorable together!  Anyhow, to put it shortly, whoever decided to put these two as the leads made a good decision; the feelings they exude are all very much alive and with the way Ashton and Amanda play off eachother you'd think they'd been friends for years before A Lot Like Love.  From the moment their eyes first met you KNEW, and I think they did too, that some awesome force was about to rock their world!  Their cute sparring and playful flirting are so much fun to watch and each time one does or says something goofy, you die laughing alongside them.  Take the car scene where they are stuffing their faces with cheetos and pie; the looks on their faces are priceless and Amanda is laughing so hard you think she might choke!  They are having such a blast and none of their laughter is in any way a cheesy staged act.  Another priceless and incredibly sweet scene is their night in the national park (I didn't say this had NO inappropriatness...just a little!  And it's easily overlooked by how real-feeling Ashton and Amanda make this scene seem.)  This is such a cute movie!  If you're up for laughs and some good natured romance this is the film for you.

2322703,4,B0009UZGIM,"Ashton Kutcher (The Butterfly Effect) and Amanda Peet (One Fine Day) star in A Lot Like Love, a sweet romantic comedy directed by Nigel Cole.

Kutcher and Peet play Oliver and Emily, two people who meet by chance and a quick fling onboard an airplane, who don't see each other for another 4 years, spend one day together, part ways, meet again years later, part ways again, and meet again...The movie evolves into a love story that stretches over many years but never gets a grip, more like Rob Reiner's 1989 classic When Harry Met Sally.

Like Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, Kutcher and Peet make a good onscreen couple as the chemistry evolves from one time period to another. The movie in general, with its direct appeal to the twenty-something year old audience, is easy to follow and fun at the same time.

A Lot Like Love features an excellent soundtrack: Aqualung's Brighter Than Sunshine, Jet's Look What You've Done, Anna Nalick's Breathe, Eagle Eye Cherry's Save Tonight, and Chicago's classic hit If You Leave Me Now, as well as Bon Jovi's I'll Be There For You, performed by Kutcher himself in the film. The movie also stars Kal Penn, famous for his role as Kumar in Harold And Kumar Go To White Castle.

In other words, the previews put together by the studio did not do a good job of selling this movie. The ""over the top"" has to be taken in context with the storyline of the movie as it involves the two main characters. Ashton Kutcher and Amanda Peet were outstanding in this film and the chemistry they had was first rate, which is sadly lacking in Hollywood these days.

2322706,3,B0009UZGIM,"I need to confess something to everyone out there reading this review.  While it may shock and/or surprise you, I actually began this film with some rather high expectations.  While most will point out the obvious Ashton Kutcher-Amanda Peet coupling as their reasons why this had to be a horrible film, I actually saw these two as a decent pair.  Yes friends, my name is Andy, and I am an Ashton Kutcher fan.  While That 70s Show may not highlight his career that well, I do believe that The Butterfly Effect was a strong outing.  While I have not seen Guess Who?, I do believe that Kutcher's style of humor is something that I could enjoy in my spare time.  I also saw the coupling with Peet as a bold gesture.  She is a fresh face in the ""romantic comedy"" arena that is flooded with the Meg Ryans of the world.  I also thought that the story was creative, and a definite new twist on a dusty genre.  This was, of course, before I saw A Lot Like Love.  This is what I went into the film expecting, actually, kinda hoping would happen.  Sadly, my expectations were shot down, and I was left with mediocre acting and a stringy plot.  Thankfully, there was nostalgic 90s music interweaved throughout the film to bring some hope to this disappointing plate of cinema.

Mediocrity seemed to plague both Kutcher and Peet on the set of this film.  From the material handed to them to what I witnessed on screen, they just didn't seem to jump as high as expected.  Don't get me wrong, they were better than another Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan pairing and they actually seemed rather genuine towards each other on screen, but they just didn't reach for the full potential of their characters.  I must admit, I loved their characters at the beginning of the film.  Honestly, the entire film could have been shuttered around those two opening characters and I would have been more interested, but we grew.  Sorry, the characters grew up over time and eventually they lost themselves.  I couldn't tell whether I should be happy for their changes, or depressed because they lost that youthful nature that surrounded their beginning moments.  Let me explain.  Kutcher, at the beginning of this film, had so much drive, so much energy, and so much dedication to do more in life and be successful.  Peet was a free spirit.  She seemed anti-establishment and pro-spontaneity.  You could look into both of their eyes and see genuine characters there, but then, time passed, and they got lazy.  There is no better word for this, they just seemed to loose their focus.  Perhaps it was the fault of the director, or even the writer, for not keeping individual characters throughout the film.  Kutcher continues with business, but not with the same energy.  Peet does a complete 180 and finds herself living a yuppie life with no complaints.  How did this happen in the course of twenty minutes?  We lost our characters.  By the end of the film, without giving anything away, we find ourselves looking at the same character.  Is that what the director intended?  To show that over time we, as humans, fall into a similar patter and will change dramatically for love?  I had trouble swallowing this and thus found myself getting angry with Kutcher and Peet for allowing this to happen.  Take me back to their youth anytime!

As we watched this dismal change in the characters, the plot fell into a similar unwoven sweater scenario.  By that I mean we started with a full sweater of potential, then, about a quarter of the way through (after their first meeting in NYC), a string started to cause the sweater to fray and unravel.  The plot, aka the sweater, from that point just jumped in nearly every direction.  There was yarn going everywhere, yet leading nowhere.  I watched these rather unique characters never reach their full potential due to the story coming undone.  Each time these two met, there were so many angles they could have gone, so many places we could have traveled together, so many pieces of yarn going in possible directions, but some strange reason, the director chose to ""play it safe"".  The most disturbing choice a director could make for a romantic comedy.  By ""playing it safe"", A Lot Like Love eventually fell into the same category as every other romantic comedy produced by the Hollywood recycling machine.  By the end of the film, the sweater had completely lost its shape and we are left with nothing more than clichd words surrounded by a clich moment that seemed more generic than fun.  Again, how could a film that started with so much potential, end so dismally?  You saw the opportunity, it just was became sad when Nigel Cole could not capture this opportunity and truly make a fantastical film, breaking the boundaries of the romantic comedy.

Overall, A Lot Like Love started so strong, but somehow, like an under trained sprinter, lost its wind midway through the film.  In fact, I can put my finger on the moment that it failed.  When we go three years into the future and Peet is completely yuppied up, turned from her original unique character, I knew we had fallen deep into the romantic comedy quicksand.  I am under the belief that Nigel Cole tricked me.  He packaged this film colorfully enough, he used un-clich characters and actors in the main roles, and provided a non-linear story that sucked you in within the first 15 minutes, but as you feel like this is a ""different"" type of film, it suddenly changes to your generic romantic comedy.  I was tricked, and I am writing this review in hopes others would not fall prey to the same trap.  If you have seen When Harry Met Sally, than you have seen this film!

2322707,5,B0009UZGIM,"""A Lot Like Love"" is a courageous piece of art, drenched in social commentary and dripping with keen observations of the human condition.  With this movie, director Nigel Cole earns entre into the pantheon of esteemed film directors and is hereafter worthy of mention in the same breath as Kubrick, Bergman and Kurosawa.

Cole takes the modern love story and stands it on its ear by making the young lovers, Emily and Oliver (Amanda Peet and Ashton Kutcher) mentally retarded.  The casting is sublime as neither actor must strain to play a character with a mid-forties I.Q.  Kutcher, in particular, seems born into this role.  In an early scene, he deftly captures the phases of a retarded man getting dressed: he struggles with buttons, is confident with zippers, and he goes positively bananas around velcro.

The couple meet at the Starbucks where Emily works as a barista.  Oliver stumbles in and orders a chalupa.  Emily has no patience for the retarded man who acts like...well, like a retard, so she sells him an iced espresso and Joni Mitchell Artist's Choice CD and tells him not to come back until he digs the music.  Oliver is smitten, and when he returns singing The New Radicals ""You Get What You Give,"" the sparks fly.

The young lovers must face society's scorn and disapproval.  Here is where the genius of the film is revealed as it bores into the question of what comprises true love.  The masses believe that it emerges from shared interests and outlooks on life, that similar views on politics, art and aesthetics provide the foundation for lasting romance.  ""A Lot Like Love"" blows these misconceptions out of the water by revealing that at the heart of real love lies sex - fast and frequent sex with little chit chat to spoil the mood.  You don't need to be Einstein to experience nirvana.  In fact, being Einstein could be a hindrance, especially if every climax reminds you that the universe itself is contracting.

 ""A Lot Like Love"" points out why retarded people can now blend into the culture at large.  While their functionality is no higher than in prior generations, the rest of America has throttled back intellectually, politically, and spiritually.  All you need to understand now is size.  Bigger is better.  Navigate your monster vehicle down to Costco and load up on a side of beef, a big screen TV and seventeen pounds of creamed corn.  Only one thing will shrink as this de-evolution continues: soon all of our kids will be worthy of the small school bus.  See ""A Lot Like Love"" while you still have the noodles to appreciate it.",1135987200,4,2569,4.749435665914222
2322708,4,B0009UZGIM,"A meeting of the mile high club

Love with the proper stranger

A friend to call when things are rough

There's certainly no danger

Except that every time they meet

(Albeit years apart)

It's always when someone gets dumped

And has a broken heart

Two actors with no chemistry

Still generate some heat

A dude that cannot find his car

Attracts Amanda Peet

More drama than a comedy

But yes, it's a romance

They should have cut the klutzy parts

To give Kutcher a chance

It's definitely worth a look

It's not a waste of money

The actors do the best they can

With a script that isn't funny

2322709,1,B0009UZGIM,"I rented this movie because I was in the mood for something awful, and this movie exceeded my expectations admirably.  There was literally a moment where I thought to myself, ""Okay, this movie has overstayed it's welcome RIGHT NOW!""

It's not like it's the worst movie ever.  Ashton Kutcher can manage, and Amanda Peet can act like she can manage to act, if that means anything at all.  Everyone else in the supporting roles were terrible, but I don't know if that was their fault just due to the fact that none of them were even remotely interesting or necessary characters.

Most hilarious in this film was the breakup scene between Oliver and Bridget.  It was like an school exercise in creating a generic break-up scene...  everything in it was made so perfectly precisely to be exactly like every generic breakup scene between two characters nobody cares about made before.

Very few subplots keep the action going, most of them are gimmicky.  The trip north was okay, but stuff like the deaf brother (uh...  Four Weddings and a Funeral?  Yeah...) and the graveyard scene and even, to a degree, Oliver's business, was completely a waste of time, but none nearly so much as Emily's best friend, who had to be one of the worst supporting characters of uselessness ever written.

The preview, to me, depicted the movie as being very funny and sweet. And it was--it's easily one of the best romantic comedies I've seen. Ashton plays a more subdued/thoughtful character than he usually does, and Peet plays a wild girl, and its cool to see how their characters change their hair, their clothes, and their feelings over the years. Peet is really good as Emily, the tough girl who has always had a man in her life is trying to figure out her place in the world. Her character is both vulnerable and stubborn. Ashton fans will also enjoy seeing him here - he's really kind of charming. The chemistry between Ashton and Peet is great, a cute couple. One great scene is when they are singing together on a long car ride, and other great scenes show how they support each other after a tough break up, or a death in the family, or losing a job. It all seems very genuine (you recognize parts of you or your friends in the characters).

But on the negative side the movie was predictable and didn't evoke too much emotion, which is an absolute must for romantic comedies.

All in all, the movie was a good one. Rent it, don't buy, and enjoy, because it is a fun movie (the scene where Emily runs into the sliding glass window is hilarious) and you come away with a smile.",1131494400,,480,4.217391304347826

Even though it is not the greatest flick, there are a lot worse movies out there that make it big.  If you are looking for fluff, see it.",1131148800,,454,4.421686746987952
2322726,4,B0009UZGIM,"As I am not a raving Ashton Kutcher fan, I have to admit that I was surprised by his likeable performance in this film and felt that the chemistry between he and Amanda Peet was excellent in this entertaining but yet predictable romantic comedy.

The film starts with a chance meeting in an airport between Emily (Peet)and Oliver (Kutcher).  The premise is that a stand-offish Peet bets Kutcher $50 that his dream of owning his own internet business and moving out of his parents home will not be fulfilled within six years.  The movie follows the two over the next several years and follows their ups and downs with relationships with others.

Over their several 'chance' meetings over the years you find yourself rooting for them to make a go of it...yet something always seems to be in the way.  Although Emily informs Oliver that he has three strikes against him, he eagerly works to correct the missteps.  The relationship is similar to ""When Harry Met Sally"".

The movie concludes with a predictable but palatable situation.  You will find yourself entertained, although the movie seems that it could have conveyed the same entertainment value in about 15 less minutes.  The middle of the film drags a bit.  Overall, however, I found it to be much better than what the trailer would suggest.  Not a blockbuster, but better than most in this genre.",1130803200,,1353,4.788793103448276
2322727,4,B0009UZGIM,"A very pleasant romantic comedy, A Lot Like Love, brings to the screen the love story of two young people, who meet at an airport by chance only to keep on bumping into each other before they make it work out.

It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.

Ashton Kutcher, Amanda Peet and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.  The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.

The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful!

In short, A Lot Like Love is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!",1130630400,,1158,4.674876847290641

When they arrive at their destination they go there sepaerate ways but things keep driving them together. At a bar in New York they make a bet. After the bet things keep happening throughout the seven year time period of the movie to bring them together. When it gets to the last of it we find out that Oliver has fallen for Emily but it's too late she is engaged. The big question is will Emily wake up and see she is in love with Oliver? If so will he still be waiting for her?

The cast is brillant with Ashton and Amanda as the leads. Their chemistry is beliveable and they should work together again sometime. This would be the perfect movie to rent and watch with a date.

2322731,3,B0009UZGIM,"One of the most spectacular things about this movie is the way it progresses through the years.  You really see and can identify with the way the characters grow.  I also have a lot of respect for this movie because it deals with an issue very few film makers are willing to take on: failure.  In general, the characters aren't extremely well connected, well read, or ridiculously over funded by mom and dad.  This to me added a sense of realism missing from many movies of this genre.

A Lot Like Love only earns three stars from me because the plot and love story are depressingly slow.  It is neat to see the two love birds run into each other over the years, however the plot relied too heavily on chance meetings and whimsical decision making on the part of Amanda Peet.  After their third occasion meeting I was thinking, ""Why don't you guys just stay together for heaven's sake!!?""

If there is nothing else to rent at the video store, pick it up.  This definitely is not a movie I can see owning or viewing multiple times.",1128038400,,1030,4.4361702127659575

Why would the company in NY give money to Oliver's company after that horrid office presentation....The whole idea of a diaper company did not help the movie at all and was not needed, in my opinion.  Very boring movie to sit through, but fun to make fun of if you are with a group of friends.

2322753,4,B0009UZGIM,"The only reason I watched this movie was because of the heavy bashing it received at the hands of the media. The best thing about the film is that it doesnt take itself over seriously and isn't scheming to be something it is not. Ashton Kutcher's character is realistic and boring at times. He's goofy in the film. Of course, A lot Like Love has it's share of filmy exaggeration. I loved the girl who played Emily in the film. She's hot,attractive,stupid and careless. I loved how she tries to think she's evolving all the time especially each time they show her a few years hence. Her hair keep getting longer and she becomes more polite.

Some scenes in the film spoke volumes about how embarassing things can get. I could relate to some scenes in my own life. I don't know why (might ound stupid) but there was a feeling of deja vu with a few scenes too.

THE GOOD

The way it all starts and how stupid A.K is made to feel in the beginning, the deaf guy who plays Oliver's (AK) brother, the foolishly refreshing random soundtrack, Kal Penn's 20 second conversation with a girl on how he's gonna be rich soon

THE BAD

The movie seems to drag 20 minutes before ending. I almost looked at my watch but I'm a patient little guy. Another bad thing about this film is that it may seem a bit adopted from other succesful movies to have come out in the recent past.

Watch it. If you like this movie, watch a film called ""Manhattan""",1127606400,,1428,4.349624060150376

2322755,2,B0009UZGIM,"THAT is, in my opinion, a more descriptive title for this film.

Amanda Peet, attractive though she might be, plays a character who is downright disturbed, although, thankfully, slightly less so than say, Glenn Close's psychotic 'Alex' in ""Fatal Attraction.""

Peet's character isn't dangerous per se, although her initial meeting with Kutcher involves her exchanging a couple of furtive glances while waiting for a plane... followed by her knocking on the bathroom door once they're ON the plane, and joining him for a 'quickie.'

She then acts as if it never happened, and all of Kutcher's feeble attempts to engage her in conversation following this interesting liaison fall on deaf ears.

They part ways, and encounter one another a number of times during the next seven years... and each time, I was sitting there thinking to myself: ""IDIOT!! If you WANT the girl, ACT LIKE A MAN and you'll GET the girl.""

But no. His character is an utter weeny, and I am dumbfounded as to how he managed to start a somewhat successful dot.com business. The film also lost a golden opportunity for an obvious-but-funny line, regarding this business venture. (He sell's diapers on-line.) When Peet's character admonishes him not to tell her friends what kind of business he's in, he just goes and TELLS them, ""I sell diapers."" And that's the end of it. It was like watching a balloon slowly deflate.

If *I* sold diapers, I'd be champing at the bit waiting for people to ask me what I did so I could tell them ""I'm in diapers."" After waiting a moment to gauge their reaction, THEN I'd explain myself. It was one of many lost opportunities in the film.

The trailer looked good and even though Kutcher was in it, it also starred the beautiful and talented Amanda Peet who I have loved since her role on the short lived WB series 'Jack & Jill'. I finally saw this film on DVD and I was pleasantly surprised at how good this film was. Not only did Amanda Peet give an excellent performance but Ashton Hutcher also did a good job as well.

Well, it's hard to get cuter than the guy starts to walk out of the bathroom at thirty-seven thousand feet and gets shoved right back in by the girl who locks the door behind her and initiates him into the mile-high club.  (Considering that it was Amanda Peet doing the shoving, how lucky can a guy get?)

Next you've got to have kinky and cute--either the guy or the girl.  Amanda Peet as Emily is clearly cute and (ahem, kinky), while Ashton Kutcher, the ditzy but adorable heartthrob of TV's ""That Seventies Show,"" plays it mostly straight as still-living-at-home Oliver Martin.  It seems that she was just on the rebound as she rushed him into the mile-high club, so it didn't mean a thing.  She was just proving to herself that she is still attractive.  And so, dude, good-bye.

Yes, you've got to have complications, lots of them, to keep the lovers apart until the final reel.  Shakespeare had 'em.  Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy had 'em, Audrey Hepburn had 'em, and God knows Meg Ryan and various beaux had 'em galore.  Here Emily really doesn't see Oliver as quite the alpha male she had in mind, but three years later when she finds herself dumped and without a date for New Year's Eve she comes across his phone number (he wanted her to call him in six years to find out that he was a great success with a beautiful wife, etc., and no longer living at home).  So she calls and asks him out.

Well, enough about the specifics of the plot.  It doesn't matter.  The plot is just a way to throw them together so that they find out after many mishaps, heartbreaks, misadventures and just plain old-fashioned boy and girl fun that they are truly in love.  After all wasn't it the Bard who said that ""The course of true love never did run smooth""?  (from A Midsummer-Night's Dream)

Although I am a little (just a little) too old for this movie, I did find it enjoyable.  Peet is as pretty as pretty has any right to be, and tall, handsome Kutcher has an infectious, likable quality about him, so even though the movie was not as clever nor as smart as some romantic comedies, it was nonetheless a step above eye candy, and a nice diversion for a dateless Saturday night--or actually, I think it would work even better as a first-date kind of movie or even a been-married-for-five-years movie for the both of you.

2322775,3,B0009UZGIM,"Love requires a couple of tangibles to occur - time and place where two individuals can connect.  These tangibles are common denominators in cinema history, as characters encounter one another.  In regards to love, this opportunity often takes place at the first meeting where love happens at first sight.  However, a prediction of when the occasion is to take place is not possible, as the future simply will remain unknown until it happens.  A Lot Like Love grabs the notion of love through the first meeting in a straightforward manner, as Oliver (Ashton Kutcher) and Emily (Amanda Peet) meet each other for the first time and meet again a couple of times over the next seven years.

A Lot Like Love opens with two young adults setting their eyes on one another for the first time.  Here it is Oliver and Emily whose eyes connect for the first time at the Los Angeles airport, but shy Oliver does not step up to the plate when the opportunity arises.  However, Emily grabs the opportunity to get to know Oliver through a more controversial method during the flight, which leads them into a seven year on and off relationship.

During these seven years they bump into each other by choice, as they choose the opportunity to see the other.  Yet, they separate before things get serious, and each time they reason with themselves to come to the conclusion that they cannot remain together.  However, it is obvious from the first shot of the film that they will end up together.

The director Nigel Cole whom many recognize from the terrific British films Saving Grace (2000) and Calendar Girls (2003) creates a film that this time does not reach the heights of his previous film.  The shortcomings seems to rest with the unoriginal script, which delivers a story that heavily resembles with Richard Linklater's brilliant Before Sunrise (1994) and Before Sunset (2004).  In Linklater's films, a man meets a woman on a train while they end up spending a day together in Vienna, Austria, and then ten years later reunite in Paris.  Linklater's films are much more personal and thoughtful compared to the shallow storyline in A Lot Like Love.  Yet, Cole creates a story that is both amusing and warm, but the performances by the leads are uneven and do not reach the necessary peaks in order to deliver a great film.  In the end, A Lot Like Love will entertain, but not leave the audience with a significant cinematic tale.",1124841600,,2419,4.737470167064439
2322776,2,B0009UZGIM,"This movie is suppose to be a romantic comedy....and perhaps it is, but for me it is neither enough comedy or romance to earn that title. It's actually kind of sad to see two actors try so hard to have chemistry when in reality there is very little between them. The plot line was slow, yet at the same time somewhat sporadic that I never really get a good feel on each character, in other words, although the characters undergo a lot of change over the six year period it was hard to really understand why. Anyway, there were some cute moments, but in all honesty if your looking for Ashton and Amanda to capture your attention in a whirl wind of a romance like Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams do in ""The Notebook"" then think again. In a way, it was like they tried too hard or something. Sometimes a movie is so wonderful because it's seamless, and flows so effortlessly, this movie tries too hard, and in return I ended up having to try really hard to actually care about these character and whether or not they end up together...this is a rental at best. Nonetheless the soundtrack is good. Sorry, I'm a huge romantic comedy fan, this one just didn't do it for me.",1124841600,,1168,4.387096774193548
2322777,4,B0009UZGIM,"Ashton Kutcher (graciously dropping his exasperating ""Punk'd"" persona) stars opposite Amanda Peet in this sweet, unexpectedly disarming, ultimately winning romantic comedy.  In the deft hands of director Nigel Cole, ""A Lot Like Love"" is more than the typical rom-com fare.  Yes, it's romantic and funny, but it's also poignant, subtle, and well-acted, qualities most films in this genre tend to lack.  ""A Lot Like Love"" sails along nicely, thanks to a smart and zesty script, as well as Kutcher and Peet's fantastic chemistry and nuanced performances.  It's no surprise how it all turns out, and the clichd finale is rushed and a bit of a disappointment, but there is a lot more to like about ""A Lot Like Love"" than not.",1124755200,,720,4.925619834710743
2322778,5,B0009UZGIM,"I rented this movie four times in the past week. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. It certainly wasn't the funniest movie I'd ever seen, but I thought that Ashton Kutcher and Amanda Peet had amazing chemistry on screen. I was also able to relate to the premise, which was basically about timing and how it can work for, or against you, when you meet the right person. The sound track went very well with all the scenes, and I thought that the scene with Kutcher and Peet standing naked and kissing on top of a rock  was extremely well done. I found it to be beautiful, and very sweet. He was very charming and sexy in a low-key kind of way and I liked both of their characters very much. I definitely think it's worth seeing!

2322779,5,B0009UZGIM,"I AM ALWAYS looking for a good romantic comedy. I FOUND IT!  The preview, to me, depicted the movie as being very funny and sweet. And it was--it's easily one of the best romantic comedies I've seen. Ashton plays a more subdued/thoughtful character than he usually does, and Peet plays a wild girl, and its cool to see how their characters change their hair, their clothes, and their feelings over the years. Peet is really good as Emily, the tough girl who has always had a man in her life is trying to figure out her place in the world. Her character is both vulnerable and stubborn. Ashton fans will also enjoy seeing him here - he's really kind of charming. The chemistry between Ashton and Peet is great, a cute couple. One great scene is when they are singing together on a long car ride, and other great scenes show how they support each other after a tough break up, or a death in the family, or losing a job. It all seems very genuine (you recognize parts of you or your friends in the characters).",1124064000,3,1007,4.385026737967914
2322780,2,B0009UZGIM,"I went to see this movie with my girlfriend. She laughed hysterically throughout the movie, while I was laughing as well, but about a completely different thing. She laughed because she thought it was funny. I laughed because I thought it was ridiculously stupid.

The screenplay was horrible. About every other line, I would shake my head in dissapointment. The plot must have been written without thought. The acting was alright. But I am not an Ashton Kutcher fan. If he can become a famous actor, then so can any other average person.

I must say this is one of the worst movies ever. Crossroads was a better movie than this. Don't waste your time watching this like I did.",1119830400,,677,4.633333333333334

I wouldn't recommend this movie to any one.  Sorry.",1118102400,,255,4.478260869565218

8066858,4,B0009UZGIM,Really funny and tender romantic comedy watching two young people fall in love over the space of several years and sporadic encounters.
