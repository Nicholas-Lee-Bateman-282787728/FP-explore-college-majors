However, the little ones in our home are not crazy about it. They watched it when it first arrived, but haven't shown an interest since.",1322438400,,261,4.24

7861240,5,6304062427,"One of my favorite all-time Disney animated features is THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME. This is a very worthy Sing Along Songs video to compliment it.

Songs included are:

Topsy Turvy (The Hunchback Of Notre Dame)

You've Got A Friend In Me (Toy Story)

Stand By Me from Timon and Pumbaa (not in the UK video version)

Streets Of Gold

The Dwarfs' Yodel Song from Snow White (not in the UK video

version)

Out There (The Hunchback Of Notre Dame)

Family from James & The Giant Peach (not in the UK video version)

The Unbirthday Song (not in the UK video version)

""Out There"" from Hunchback is the highlight.",1123718400,4,608,4.486238532110092

EVERY Disney Sing Along cartoon video, we own the Holiday ones and the
Character ones as well (Campout etc..).  Nothing entertains my 5 yo. and
1 1/2 yo. like these tapes do.  The music is good for them, the word
recognition is good for them, they are familiar with many characters now
(which makes going to the park WAY MORE FUN! - they don't have to have
watched every movie to know most characters). Great for little ones with
short attention spans since it changes characters with each song and the
music keeps them hopping! I feel no guilt at all letting them watch
alone while I cook or unload the dishwasher as I gaze over at my two
happy, singing, dancing girls!  Best baby sitter in the UNIVERSE!  I
also think it will help them when they are older and start to read -
They have been a staple to our VHS collection since my eldest was a
toddler! WELL WORTH THE MONEY!",1063756800,5,949,4.308988764044944
