7824181,4,6302208688,"I still can't figure out why the

NBA nutcases always want to push

'Tragic' (overrated) Johnson into

every Bird video. I really could

not give a turkey that Johnson &

Mich. St. beat Bird in that damn

NCAA Final. Also, so the Lakers

were a better team than the Cel-

tics (barely!) in the '80's. John-

son had very little to do with it!

Besides, James Worthy, Jordan's old

mate from N.C. was the real leader

of that Lakers Champ team(s) anyway!

Not Alcinder, either! Rock on Larry!",1150329600,,491,4.443181818181818
7824182,5,6302208688,"I absolutely loved this video.  I debated keeping our VCR, even though this was the only VHS I have.  Absolutely incredible, narrarated like a Wonder Years episode, this video is a must for young kids growing up, and those of us a little older who still appreciate the old days.",1079395200,,278,4.54
7824183,4,6302208688,"This is one of the best sports doccumentaries I have ever seen, and the best NBA video I have viewed.  It seems that an hour is not enough to recap the great career of Larry Bird.  Unfortunately this film was made in 1991, so his final season and Olympic experience was not covered in this video.  I also feel that it could have gone in more detial over certain events in his career.  However, it is an amazing film which makes you believe that Larry legend is truely a miracle worker.  This film tells it like it is, and is a good pick for any Celtic, Bird or Magic fan.  Watch it.",1014595200,,582,4.151785714285714
7824184,5,6302208688,"For those of you who aren't familiar with the legacy of Larry Bird, this is the film for you!  Some of his greatest achievements and highlights are on tape for all to see and is guaranteed to amaze you, from his high school  days to his NBA championship teams.  His road to basketball stardom is  nothing short of inspiring and touching, which simply adds more depth to  the legend of Larry Bird.

7824185,5,6302208688,"This is one of the finest sports video's I have ever seen.  Explores the work ethic and the will power that made Larry a champion on the court, interwoven with 65 minutes of amazing highlights of Larry's career.  This  is the video to show your child to demonstrate to them what it takes to be  a champion- because as this video documents, Larry Bird was truly extraordinary. You won't be disappointed with this video.",953683200,5,418,4.608108108108108
7824186,4,6302208688,"This film is perfect for a young basketball player. It describes the hard times that Larry Bird whent through and how he handled them. It provided wonderfull interveiws with players, friends, and Larry Bird himself. What I  enjoyed and felt was most important, was the section on Larry Birds team  play. It's a great movie to have on your shelf whether you play basketball  or not.",948931200,,381,4.742424242424242
