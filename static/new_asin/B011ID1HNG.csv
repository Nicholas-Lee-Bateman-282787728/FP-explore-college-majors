7332928,4,B011ID1HNG,"Just rented Manhattan Romance on demand, and have got to say I was pleasantly surprised. This movie is a refreshing take on the romantic comedy genre. I really like that it delves into multiple sexualities and forms of love.  Its a cool social commentary of a modern love story. I would totally have my friends come over and watch it as a fun movie night.",1445472000,,355,4.461538461538462
7332929,4,B011ID1HNG,"Loved this film! I felt like it perfectly captured the essence of what its like to date for the millennial generation. Also really liked that it followed very distinct characters with different backgrounds. For instance, it focused on a couple of Lesbian characters. The LGBTQIA community is often marginalized and stereotyped in film/television so it was refreshing to see the character Carla portrayed as a person first and a bisexual woman second.",1445385600,,450,5.263888888888889
7332930,4,B011ID1HNG,"The first thing I notice about most movies is the soundtrack and whether its pulling me into the story or taking me out of it. The soundtrack for Manhattan Romance definitely pulled me into the story and kept me in the story for every second of the film. It reminded me a lot of the soundtracks to Woody Allen films. It was so lighthearted and cheerful, and it really complemented the story, even though it was sometimes serious or even sad. Overall it was just a really honest film, which is something Ive been looking for in films for a long time.",1444953600,5,549,4.392156862745098
7332931,1,B011ID1HNG,"We did not care for this movie. The story line was boring, as well as the script, acting, and obviously low budget quality of the movie. When we rented it, we expected much more, but it was not delivered!",1444867200,,204,4.256410256410256
7332932,5,B011ID1HNG,"Romantic comedy in the same vein as Woody Allen films set in Manhattan. A well crafted film with a lot of heart and stellar performances from notable actors and characters that resonate. It's a thought provoking, entertaining journey into navigating the confusing, complex dating world in present day New York City.",1444089600,,315,5.196078431372549
7332933,4,B011ID1HNG,"A perfect sexy romantic comedy filled with the trials and tribulations of life, love and sex in the big city.  A great RomCom Indie film!  Highly Recommend.",1443744000,,156,4.7407407407407405
7332934,4,B011ID1HNG,"Im a sucker for movies set in the Big Apple with the feel of a classic Woody Allen film MANHATTAN ROMANCE provides an entertaining look at the ups & downs of dating and modern relationships in NYC. Solid performances by a great cast including Katherine Waterston (INHERENT VICE, STEVE JOBS), Gaby Hoffmann (TRANSPARENT, OBVIOUS CHILD) and Caitlin FitzGerald (MASTERS OF SEX).",1443744000,2,375,5.163934426229508
7333002,5,B011ID1HNG,"Totally unique, quirky, and original film. Cassavetes-like, if anything. Charming, self-effacing central role, well acted by the writer/director and three powerhouse female performances by Gabby Hoffman, Caitlin Fitzgerald and the extraordinary Catherine Waterston.",1522800000,,265,7.0606060606060606

7333008,4,B011ID1HNG,"As someone who used to be in the NYC dating scene for several years, I absolutely loved this film!

I must say it went beyond my comedic expectations though because it had an element of darkness to it--isolation, loneliness, confusion. However, the writer and director, Tom O'Brien who also starred in it, did a solid job of not hitting the audience over the head with anything. His scenes between Katherine Waterson & Katherine's scenes with her partner, Gaby Hoffmann, surprised me. Not only did they go beyond my expectations and avoid common stereotype pitfalls, but they brought a Woody Allen quality to it.  Perhaps it was the seamless soundtrack or the shoot locations or the fact that the main focus of the film was always about the relationships, which unfortunately, is a rarity these days.

My only qualm with the movie though is that I wanted more. I would have loved to see more of Tom O' Brien's character in his personal and professional worlds a bit more, like in the wedding scene. Seeing how his relationships with family members shaped him into who he was/is and affected his view on marriage/women; etc..would have been even all the more satisfying. In a way though, I'm glad he only gave me hints of these answer and left me to fill in the blanks.

All in all, I highly recommend this movie and look forward to this artist's future work!",1449014400,,1358,4.69327731092437
7333009,4,B011ID1HNG,"Manhattan Romance surprised me! Movies exploring friends becoming romantic aren't new, but Tom OBrien (who plays the lead and also directed the film) and Katherine Waterson have a really genuine, likable chemistry. They play Danny and Carla, best friends who wander around New York talking about their love lives. Danny dates a quirky, new age girl who believes in open relationships, and Caitlin Fitzgerald is hilarious in the role. Meanwhile Carla is in a well-established relationship with Emmy (Gabby Hoffman), also a friend of Dannys. Hoffman and Waterson really show that the couple has history, but also that their infatuation has cooled. The cast does a really great job making the characters feel real and the story classic rather than clichd. Over all, I found it a very satisfying, modern romance.",1448928000,,808,5.175572519083969
7333010,4,B011ID1HNG,"Tom OBrien wears many hats in Manhattan Romance as he not only directs but also plays the male protagonist, Danny. We follow as romantic documentarian Danny films several relationships in interviews to have an inside perspective. Danny struggles with his own relationship issues as he opens himself to different women with interesting backgrounds. His use of a lot of first point of view really enabled for the audience to feel involved throughout the entire film. Overall, it was a good film to watch and I appreciated how realistic it was.",1447804800,,541,5.022222222222222
7333011,3,B011ID1HNG,I don't know if I was preoccupied but this movie couldn't hold my attention.  It was a little slow for me.  I could relate to the characters though,1446854400,,147,4.214285714285714

8724215,5,B011ID1HNG,"I loved this movie. In a sea of predictable romances and unimaginative screenplays, this film is really refreshing. Diving into the complexities, sadness, and humor of the little moments that make up our every day life, it offers both an entertaining escape and a nudge at introspection. Watch it.",1522800000,,297,5.081632653061225
8724216,5,B011ID1HNG,"This is a really great indie film by a talented up-and-coming filmmaker/actor, Tom O'Brien. It's a character driven movie and the characters are interesting, complicated, and well-developed. If you're expecting a high-budget, big studio action/adventure, this is not the movie for you. But if you like complex characters and compelling dialogue, you will love Manhattan Romance, as I did.",1522800000,2,388,5.593220338983051

8724219,5,B011ID1HNG,"I really liked the different perspectives shown of relationships in a large urban setting.  The acting was superb, especially for a low budget film.  As in all relationships, the movie showed how relationships change and how people must adapt as a result or possibly move on.  My thanks to the cast and director for offering a fun and interesting film.",1522800000,,352,4.833333333333333
