4861786,5,B005RY7NBS,"At the heart of Rimsky-Korsakov's The Legend of Invisible City of Kitezh is an epic battle between the forces of good and evil that recounts the legend of the invasion of the city by Mongol hordes. The librettist for the work however, Vladimir Belsky, also brought Christian elements into the story from the legend of Saint Fevronya and from folklore that lift the work towards flights of spiritual mysticism and rapture. There's something of a gulf then between the realistic literal depiction of the horrors of war and the pantheistic depiction of nature that doesn't entirely come together in Rimsky-Korsakov's score, but in many ways it just makes it all the more fascinating. I'm not sure that either the conductor Marc Albrecht or director Dmitri Tcherniakov manage to reconcile the inconsistencies in the opera, but it remains a glorious, intriguing work.

The first thing to note about Tcherniakov's direction is that he changes the plot slightly in order, presumably, to highlight the contrasts in the work and perhaps find a way to bring them together. Consequently he invents an 'end of the world' scenario, where Fevroniya is not some holy fool who communes with nature in the woods, but has fled there because, in Tcherniakov's prelude description, ""after what has happened on earth, life can never go on as before"". The beautiful set for Act I and II consequently depicts a Tarkovsky-like post-apocalyptic spiritual view of nature seen in The Sacrifice, while the long central third act highlights the ugliness of drunken revelry, the horror of the invasion of the Tartars and the lamentations of the citizens at the destruction that has been visited upon them. Tcherniakov isn't able to bring the two views convincingly together in the third act, which should be the dramatic turning point but - as beautiful and uplifting as the music is - it's debatable whether Rimsky-Korsakov, the composer opposed to the religious Wagnerian liturgical touches of Belsky's libretto, manages to reconcile them either. Despite this, and despite the staging attempting to undercut the mysticism further, the third Act is still wondrously operatic.

If it all does indeed manage to come together and even raise itself onto another plane by the final fourth act, much of it is to do with the singing and Rimsky-Korsakov's writing for the voice. There are no real arias in The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh, or overt folk dances and set pieces that you might find in other fairytale works by the composer like Sadko or The Golden Cockerel. It's more through composed, with a Romantic sweep and even some Wagnerian quotes in spite of Rimsky-Korsakov's opposition. It's the naturalistic roll of the Russian consonants however, flowing out unstrained in long solid arioso singing and in glorious, glorifying choral arrangements that anchor the sentiments in the real world even as they achieve a level of rapturous transcendence. The Amsterdam production is marvellous then in that it has the deservedly much-praised chorus of the De Nederlandse on fine form, but it also has a fine mostly Russian cast that give solid, unfailing performances throughout. They are led by the young soprano Svetlana Ignatovich, who fulfils every vocal and visual requirement for the saintly role of Fevroniya, her transformation into martyrdom and sainthood at the end of the work achieved with an ecstatic acceptance of her fate.

Tcherniakov again downplays any elaborately literal vision of paradise much in the same way that Rimsky-Korsakov refuses to let the music push it too far (the direction of the orchestra under Marc Albrecht similarly restrained yet ecstatic, resisting the usual Russian bombast), but everything that needs to be expressed has been done so in the writing for the voices and in the performances here. There are hints at conflicts between the music and the staging in the short 20-minute featurette that provides an informative look behind the scenes at De Nederlandse. The High Definition transfer is superb in terms of picture and sound. The BD is region-free and subtitles for this release are in English, French, German, Dutch, Japanese and Korean.",1389744000,23,4164,5.1296023564064805

The singing and staging is OK but it is the only DVD of the opera that I know of. There are better versions on CD containing the lovely music, but this version is certainly better than the what the other reviewers seem to suggest.",1338768000,2,373,4.267605633802817

4861789,2,B005RY7NBS,"As a start, the voice and image on Disc one are not well synchronized. I am amazed that Naxos allowed such an obvious glitch to pass Quality Control and the DVD sold to the public.
Since this opera is not a frequently produced one, I made a big effort to disregard the synchronization problem. But, regrettably I still dislike this production. The stage is crowded with props and at some points with non-singing characters that don't bring anything to the scene. If there are symbolic props or movements, they get lost, and I didn't understand them. In fact, the best scene of all is in Act 4 scene 1. The stage is very minimalistic and there are only two singers. That scene has value! Tatiana Monogarova (Fevronya) is the only singer of quality in the cast. Some of the scenes are watchable only due to her voice. The orchestra is fine, but not great. The entr'acte of Act 3 is just beautiful music. It can be better played.
We will have to wait for another release of this opera to be able to enjoy it as it deserves to be.",1332460800,2,1026,4.405263157894737
4861790,1,B005RY7NBS,"Elaborate sets and costumes, spectacular stage effects, and a vivid fairytale atmosphere are part and parcel of the Rimsky-Korsakov operas. Admittedly, it's very expensive to stage them properly, but absolutely nothing is accomplished by minimalist stagings by parsimonious opera companies. To see how it should be done, check out the wonderful Kirov ""Sadko"" or the unconventional but very effective Chtelet ""Golden Cockerel"". ""The Invisible City of Kitezh"" is a great and beautiful opera, and it's a pity that its first visual representation should be ruined by a ridiculous production. I bought this video before any reviews were posted. Having read the universally negative comments, I merely sampled the recording, and this was enough to make me trade it in. I can't give it zero stars, but perhaps it deserves one star for the idiomatic singing. However, the Gergiev/Kirov audio recording is even better musically. I'd advise buying it, imagining the staging, and hoping for a film of a worthy production. Very disappointing!",1328572800,3,1030,5.364197530864198
4861791,1,B005RY7NBS,"The production is horrible. All the Russian national, local color and flavor are totally absent. The stage is littered with toy-like objects and symbols, ludicrous and ugly. So are the costumes.
Russia is portrayed as a bowl of swarming and moving lice. Very  good singing and acting do not help the production. The best part of this purchase is the disc box, unusually well made.",1326240000,12,380,4.846153846153846
4861792,2,B005RY7NBS,"I agree with other reviewers concerning the technical problems for this release.  I, too, tried twice to obtain good copies, not believing that Naxos or Dynamic would release such prints.

However, I had gone one step further.  I have contacted Naxos directly.  They have been most forthright.  I do not believe that they were aware of the problems.  They have informed me that they are contacting the principle vendors/producers and will rectify the problems.

I also agree that the production is more than confusing.  But then I am not Russian/Slavic and, perhaps, the gestures, sets, etc. mean something symbolic.  Anyhow, it is the ONLY DVD performance we have so, once the technical difficulties are resolved, I will purchase a copy.",1325980800,13,738,5.083333333333333
4861793,1,B005RY7NBS,"I recommend Amazon customers not to purchase this item.  Both copies sent to me by Amazon (the second a replacement for the first)have the same manufacturing flaw.  The audio and video tracks are not synchronized and are unsynchronizable, no matter the adjustment, on any of my five disc-players.  The defect is regrettable.  R-K's opera is a high point of Russian music.  Naxos needs to revisit its quality-control protocols.",1325808000,16,426,5.205882352941177
4861794,2,B005RY7NBS,"Here, as with Die Liebe der Danae, is the 1st commercial DVD release of the penultimate opera by 1 of my favorite opera composers.  Here, also as with Danae, a gorgeous score has been disastrously encumbered with a production filled with visual absurdities - Kitezh's Act 2 even features a gigantic ladle hanging over the stage - shades indeed of Danae's dangling piano.

Back in 1985, I was fortunate to attend a lavish, ""traditional"" production of this richly melodic work at the Bolshoi, where I was spared such absurdities (as on this DVD) as Fevronya applying balm not to Vselvod's wounded flesh but to his coat; Grishka pleading to Fevronya to loosen his bonds when he's not tied up at all! (before & after his plea, he was somehow ""tied up"" by 2 furry figures at his feet); Grishka even appears in the opera's final scene when the text & action clearly refer to him as having remained in the forest, unable to enter the city.

There's so much more that's visually puzzling it would take pages to describe it all, but here are some further examples: in Act 2, some Russians have large rectangular panels on their arms, while some Mongols have large circular panels on their backs; the set of Act 3 Scene 1, instead of showing the resplendent city of Kitezh, consists only of what look like 5 small upturned boats on stilts; near this scene's end, a batch of blue pillows are brought in to form a small pile on stage, but the miraculous mist that's supposed to appear in order to render the city invisible is itself, sad to say, invisible; Act 3 Scene 2 features 9 shaggy bell-shapes somehow (& ""somewhy"") hovering over a fenced enclosure in which the Mongols huddle; in Act 4 Scene 1, 6 silent women arrive with nets, which they play with for a while before wrapping them around Fevronya, while 3 other silent women walk around bearing yokes from which hang small cylinders painted like birchbark.

Making viewing even more painful, in all of Acts 1 & 2 (Disc 1), the video arrives a good second or so after the audio, a technical glitch that could & should have been caught & corrected before release. On Disc 2 (Acts 3 & 4), the audio & video are still not perfectly synchronized but are off by a split-second, nowhere as distracting as on Disc 1, but still noticeable.

The soloists are unimpressive, save for Tatiana Monogarova, lovely to look at & listen to as Fevronya.  The costumes, not by the set designer, look ""traditional"" & seem to have come from a quite differently-styled production.

All in all, a very dreary & misguided presentation of a wonderful opera.  I gave it 2 stars, however, 1 each for Rimsky-Korsakov & Monogarova.",1325030400,37,2648,4.631130063965885
8484414,5,B005RY7NBS,"This Blu-ray is essential for us to know one of the greatest works of Russian opera. The legend of the invisible city of Kitezh is a mature composition of Korsakov and seldom staged in the West. There is another DVD of the work with the magnificent Russian singer Tatiana Monogarova but done in a theater of Sardinia with only reasonable orchestra. In this Blu-ray /DVD we have a flawless cast, an excellent orchestra, fantastic choir and Marc Albrecht as an ideal conductor. I know that for many the staging of Dmitri Tcherniakov is not good, but for me, especially the long scene Fevronia's death is extremely convincing and expressive. For me this death scene is one of the most moving in all opera repertoire. If there is excessive savagery, with a lot of blood, this is not unreal. A Tartar invasion has much to do with the Islamic state of today. What matters is that Dmitri Tcherniakov respects the essential plot and leaves untouched the Fevronias spirituality.
Highlight the interpreter of the title role, Svetlana Ignatovich, perfect from the first to the last note. Excellent also the famous Vladimir Vaneev as Prince Yuri . Unlike the DVD of Naxos, which has a very weak performer as Prince Vsevolod in this video we have the excellent tenor Maxim Aksenov. John Daszak as Grichka is another highlight.
If you want a traditional staging watch the DVD of Naxos. But if you want to hear the wonderful orchestration of Korsakov and share a refined spiritual vision watch this Blu-Ray - DVD. I conclude by saying that the sound and picture are exceptional.",1452729600,2,1563,4.814126394052044
8484415,3,B005RY7NBS,"I'll eat my entire collection of DVD's if this can be compared to Parsifal.  Mawkish, saccharine and interminable--and I am referring to the libretto, it is not helped by a Eurotrash production that has nothing to do with what the words being sung are saying or what is supposed  to be happening onstage. I was elated in the first act, The second happens in somebody's version of a 30's Russian caf, and  In the third act there is actually a stark naked old man and a guy dressed in a Santa Claus suit, for heaven's sake!  And therein lays the problem.  Rimsky-Korsakov may have intellectually ""understood"" what he was writing about but he did not was spiritually connected to it.  Compare to ""Dialogues"" or ""Murder in the Cathedral"" or even ""Tristan and Isolde"".  That said, i must commend the impressive forces onstage and particularly two of the performers: Svetlana Ignatovitch, as Frevoniya and John Daszak as Grishka.  The orchestra and chorus were equally impressive. The staging sucked. I had read the other extant DVD is even worse, so I went for this one.  I am giving it a three, but it is actually a two.",1436140800,3,1116,4.682051282051282
8484416,4,B005RY7NBS,"The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitizh is a spellbinding opera. The singing is breathtaking, the acting superb, and the audio-video on this Blu-Ray disc was mesmerizing.  My only reservation, and reason for 4 instead of 5 stars, is the staging.  As a purist, I was hopeful, as Kitizh began in the marshes and woods, that this would be a traditionally staged production.  But, to my chagrin, each succeeding scene and act became progressively more modern, abstract and ""conceptual"".  This probably appeals to some, but not to me and I wonder, many others.  Had this been one of a dozen or so other Kitizh productions I could say ""to each their own"" (which is still the case).  But with only one or two other productions out there - no other DVD production is traditional so far as I know. They all seem to be ""modern"" and do not fulfill what I'd imagine to be Rimsky-Korsakov's vision of The Invisible City of Kitizh.
  As another reviewer commented, this emotional, sublime opera still awaits a traditional staging, we hope, by the likes of Valery Gergiev or similar personage.  Until then, I will make do with the current staging and keep hoping for a traditional production in the near future.",1425600000,3,1199,4.725961538461538
8484417,2,B005RY7NBS,"This opera is based on the Russian legends of St. Fevroniya of Murom and the city of Kitezh, the latter a city that became invisible when attacked by the Tatars. Both legends are based on actual events taking place around the year 1200. This is Rimsky-Korsakov only opera that makes use of religious and supernatural themes, while mixing Russian Christian Orthodox, Oriental, and Slavic melodies; it is arguably the composers best stylistic opera, one that he considered to be his final artistic statement.
So what is the point of transforming an almost mythical legend into a scene at a present-day pub, with the Tatars depicted by modern hooligans and thugs? The whole modernized staging is insensible to the opera itself and detracts so much from its essence that, after watching the first act, you will be better off turning off the video and listening to the soundtrack alone.
The sound is of very good quality; my only concern is that the orchestra is too loud and swallows some of the voices.  The singers are using tiny microphones, so this technical issue should not be very difficult to overcome.  Svetlana Ignatovich has a very nice voice that is perfectly suited for the role of Fevroniya.  We will have to wait for Valery Gergiev to produce this beautiful opera at the Mariinsky to hope for a really good production and recording.",1420156800,5,1343,4.85589519650655
8484418,5,B005RY7NBS,"I also would have preferred a more traditional looking production.  During the mass crowd scenes in Kitezh and the Tartar Camp, it seemed that I was watching and listening to Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk.  Yes, Rimsky can also sound quite modern.  The brief shock of seeing a 100% nude Tartar proves that director Tcherniakov is really with it as far as what modern European productions are all about.  However I was charmed by the first act in the reeds and last act in heaven.  The bear hanging a pastel, which the cow had drawn, to a tree was really cute.  I doubt there will be anything sounding as good coming out soon.  This director also has been doing Gergiev productions of this opera for more than 12 years so the traditional production we want won't come from that source.  But the music places Kitezh in quality among the best early 20th century operas and shows that RK could compose much more sophisticated stuff than Sheherazade so don't wait, try it.",1406332800,7,961,4.6117647058823525
8484419,4,B005RY7NBS,"Having just completed a modern English translation of the ""Kitezh"" opera, I would like to make the following comments.  I have no complaints regarding the quality of the voices or the video.  But I do not enjoy an opera that was set 1,000 years ago transferred to modern times in order to appeal to younger audiences.  The opera, in my opinion, should be kept at the time the composer and librettist wanted it;  otherwise Rimsky would have set it c 1900 around the time he wrote it.
Regarding the libretto translation used in this production, our translation closely followed it.  However there were a number of archaic words which would confuse readers unfamiliar with the libretto.  One calls to mind a reference to ""tree-climber"" where actually was meant ""honey-gatherer"".  Also the original stage instructions calls for one Tartar to be killed by a sword, but instead he is shot in this current production.
Also, there are very strong religious themes that run through this libretto.  Those unfamiliar with practices of the Russian Orthodox Church would understandably have some confusion.

I would recommend this DVD even with the above flaws.  This recording is probably one of the best of the few available performances on DVD or CD.",1399420800,11,1240,4.975728155339806
8484420,2,B005RY7NBS,"NOTE: The following review is taken from two postings on the AudioAsylum site. They originally appeared on May 2, 2014 and May 4, 2014 respectively. These postings have been edited for their use here on the Amazon web site.

I'd like to begin with a bare-bones plot summary of the opera, just for reference:

  Act 1: The opera opens with Fevronia in the forest communing with the trees and the animals. Prince Vsevolod, wounded by a bear and separated from his hunting party, discovers her - she notices his wounds and treats them with medicinal herbs. At first, Vsevolod is suspicious of Fevronia's ""black magic"", but through talking to her, he is stunned by the holiness and deep spirituality of her views (e.g., the forest itself is a cathedral) and impetuously asks her to be his wife. Amid puzzlement and doubt, Fevronia agrees - even though she does not yet know his name or status. After Vsevolod leaves to join his comrades, the hunting party itself encounters Fevronia and informs her that the stranger she just met is Prince Vsevolod of Kitezh.

  Act 2: The townspeople of Lesser Kitezh, a suburb (!) of Greater Kitezh, are gossiping about the Prince's choice of a low-born woman to be his fiance, and a couple of wealthy aristocrats try to exploit the crowd's unease through bribing Grishka Kuter'ma, a notorious town drunkard, to stir up more trouble. However, when Fevronia arrives with her retinue, the people acclaim her and try to drive Kuter'ma away. Fevronia's insistence that every person is worthy of love, even a ne'er-do-well like Kuter'ma, only infuriates him further. As the girls begin to sing a wedding hymn, disaster strikes in the form of an attack on Lesser Kitezh by the Tartars. Many of the townsfolk are tortured and killed, and, faced with torture himself, Kuter'ma agrees to lead the Tartars to Greater Kitezh, where untold riches supposedly lie in wait.

  Act 3, Scene 1: The citizens of Greater Kitezh await the Tartar attack with morbid apprehension, especially in view of the descriptions of the Prince's Minister, Fyodor Poyarok, who has had his eyes put out by the Tartars. Incredibly, he says that the Tartars are being guided to the city not by Kuter'ma, but by Fevronia (as, we find out later, Poyarok was falsely told by Kuter'ma)! Prince Vsevolod, his father (Prince Yury) and the people are devastated. Nevertheless, Vsevolod rallies his troops, preparing for a battle outside the walls, and asks the people to pray. Their prayers are answered with a miracle: the church bells within the city begin to ring by themselves, and the city is enveloped in a golden mist, making it invisible.

  Symphonic Interlude, ""The Battle near Kerzhenets"": Prince Vsevolod and his army are routed by the Tartars. The Prince himself dies from ""the forty wounds"" which the Tartars have inflicted on him.

  Act 3, Scene 2: As evening falls, Kuter'ma and the Tartars arrive at a lake bordering Greater Kitezh. As the Tartars descend into a drunken brawl, Kuter'ma begins to hear the church bells from Greater Kitezh and begins to go mad from his guilt. He confesses his betrayal to Fevronia, who takes pity on him and helps him escape once the Tartars pass out. During his escape, Kuter'ma continues to hear the church bells and sees the reflection of Kitezh in the lake, even though the city itself remains invisible. This drives him even more insane and he returns to take Fevronia with him into the forest. The commotion stirs the Tartar warriors, who awake to see the same reflection of Kitezh in the lake. They are seized with terror and flee.

  Act 4, Scene 1: Kuter'ma's derangement has only increased, despite Fevronia's efforts to help him obtain forgiveness through prayer, and he begins to have visions of the devil. His hallucinations become more and more crazed, and he flees, leaving Fevronia alone. Fevronia's fatigue and exhaustion begin to wear her down, but, suddenly, the forest transforms into a heavenly landscape with with otherworldly flowers and supernatural, prophetic birds, one of whom tells her that she is about to die. Prince Vsevolod's spirit appears and another bird tells them they are about to become reborn to everlasting life.

  Symphonic Interlude: Prince Vsevolod and Fevronia enter the transformed City of Greater Kitezh (still invisible!). The prophetic birds promise them eternal joy.

  Act 4, Scene 2: Greater Kitezh has turned into Paradise, populated by the victims slaughtered by the Tartars. To Fevronia's astonishment, her wedding which had begun earlier now continues amid the heavenly bliss. Even now, Fevronia can't forget the tribulations of Kuter'ma and sends him a communication wishing God's blessing on him.

There are so many observations that can be made about this plot as well as the music. One is that while RK himself fluctuated in his own beliefs between pantheism and atheism, his librettist, Vladimir Belsky, seems to have been a deeply committed Christian, and the character of Fevronia is based on a Christian saint, St. Fevronia of Murom. RK was uneasy with musical depictions of rituals, and yet that's exactly what Belsky left for him in the final couple of scenes, as well as part of Act 3, Scene 1 (when the people pray to be delivered from their imminent affliction). Because of this, these ritualistic parts of the opera are extremely slow moving in terms of action, and yet such is Rimsky's musical genius that these same parts strike many listeners (I'm one of them!) as enormously inspired. I just wish I could make other listeners who haven't heard these parts know how heart-rending they can be. (I've just been re-reading parts of Yastrebtsev's biography of RK - a unique document in the sense that Yastrebtsev was actually a close and trusted friend of the RK household and would write down his remembrances of his meetings with RK and his friends, such as Stravinsky, Glazunov, and Liadov, within days of their occurrence. The wonderful English translation by Florance Jonas, published by Columbia University Press, is unfortunately abbreviated from the Russian original, but it still runs to almost 500 pages, with an additional 50+ pages of notes.) Yastrebtsev heard each act of ""Kitezh"" as it was ""hot off the press"" (or, in this case, hot off the manuscript) along with other guests as the music was played on the piano during bi-weekly soirees in the RK household. Sometimes, Yastrebtsev's descriptions are short and succinct, for example, ""Before and after tea, Nikolai Andreyevich played through the first act of his 'Kitezh'. . . The work is first-class, deeply moving (I wept), with much that is new, especially in feeling."" In fact, the musical beauty and emotions of each new act caused Yastrebtsev to repeat his utterance, ""I wept"", as he heard these piano performances for the first time.

Yes, for some of us, it's that kind of work - deeply emotional indeed! Aside from the supernatural transformations of the opera's themes in the ""ritualized"" scenes near the end, the scene where the people of Kitezh pray for deliverance features Rimsky's moving use of Orthodox Church style writing, but with fugal (or at least imitative) treatments - so beautiful! Yastrebtsev also rightly notes the musical innovations, such as the use of a scale, the lower four notes of which are those of the Phrygian mode, while the upper four notes are those of the major scale (or, if you will, melodic minor ascending).

The one musically surprising thing to me in this work is that the music associated with the Tartars is perhaps less frightening than one might expect. I hear perhaps an underlying jollity in this music which may be considered inconsistent with the terror and torture which the Tartars inflict, although I suppose terrorists can be laughing as they inflict tortures on others. In Yastrebtsev's reminiscences, it's explained that the Tartar theme is not so much actually Tartar in nature, but rather a manifestation of the Russian reaction to the Tartar danger - which makes the underlying suggestion of jollity I'm sensing even less understandable. Even so, there's a prominent augmented second in the theme that conveys the exotic nature of the invaders quite clearly.

Sometimes, you'll hear commentators make comparisons between ""Kitezh"" and Wagner's ""Parsifal"" - and there are indeed some parallels to be made between these magnificent works. The main character in each is a nave soul, one (Fevronia) who lives in harmony with nature, and the other (Parsifal) who foolishly defies nature (killing the swan) before coming to a more harmonious relationship by the end of the work. In ""Parsifal"", Amfortas' wound is a prime symbol and component of the plot. In ""Kitezh"", the ""forty wounds"" inflicted by the Tartars on Prince Vsevolod (Fevronia's betrothed) trigger the spiritual ascent and transformation of both main characters in the last act. Musically, there are also parallels between the two composers, nowhere more so than at the very beginning of ""Kitezh"" (the ""Hymn to Nature""), which takes the rustling string figurations of the ""Forest Murmurs"" section of ""Siegfried"" and uses them to build a bridge to one of the most purely beautiful melodies in all of opera. (You can hear this section in the suite from the opera too.) The big difference between the two operas, for me anyway, is that, for long sections, Wagner evokes a kind of mental anguish in his music which Rimsky avoids, despite the horrific action in parts of ""Kitezh"".

I've written too much already about plot and musical style, but I've got to get back to the two recent videos of ""Kitezh"" which I originally planned to discuss. Basically it's a choice between a ""heart in the right place"" but low-budget production (the Teatro Lirico di Cagliari DVD on Naxos), and the more big-budget production (the Netherlands Opera blu-ray on Opus Arte), with its eurotrash revisionism. A few details of each:

Teatro Lirico di Cagliari DVD on Naxos: The orchestra seems to be just a bit lacking in size and weight, especially the strings. The animals in the opening scene are often stick figures - this sometimes gives the production a nave charm, but one ends up wishing for more. The transformation scenes at the end are just not opulent enough. There are some minor deviations from the directions in the libretto, but mostly I'm OK with the basic staging in terms of attempted fidelity to the score. The sound quality suffers in comparison to the blu-ray.

Netherlands Opera blu-ray on Opus Arte: Beautiful sound quality, and generally superior singers, although, in the pivotal title role of Favronia, I think both singers (Monogarova on the DVD and Ignatovich on the blu-ray) are equally good. The scenery can be outstanding: the opening reed landscape (which you see on the cover) is beautiful, but despite a couple of tree trunks visible, this is not the FOREST called for in the libretto. And instead of communing with the animals in this production, Fevronia cares for a group of (mentally defective?) men and boys who are completely extraneous to the plot - one adult wears a baby bonnet for some reason. When the Tartars arrive, they're packing automatic weapons. After the people in Greater Kitezh pray for deliverance from the Tartars, the poisoned Kool-Aid is distributed to the women ( la the Jonestown massacre - this is particularly disgusting). Instead of the magical, prophetic birds in the final scenes, we see a couple of babushkas pulling a sled. As you can probably infer, much of this staging here is completely repulsive, and I didn't even list all of its kinky deviations.

So how would I choose? I hate to say it, but I'd get the blu-ray (yes, this one to which I'm awarding only two stars) and perhaps just listen to it with the video off. I also just re-listened to the Gergiev/Kirov (audio only) CD's of this work and continued to be disappointed in the sound quality of that recording (as I have ever since it came out). The sound quality on this blu-ray is a real advance, but, as I mentioned, the staging is just disgusting trash. On the AudioAsylum site, where my comments first appeared, the are a couple of us who devoutly wish the following:

8484422,3,B005RY7NBS,"This fabulous Russian opera has been treated better on CD, the Gergiev recording being a top recommendation (with the historical Nebolsin recording an important addition). Unfortunately, neither this Opus Arte release or the Naxos/Dynamic release visually captures the fullness or spiritual scope of Rimsky-Korsakov's magnum opus. And that is regrettable, because each time I hear this work (and watch it), the esteem I have for it rises. It has some of the finest writing for the human voice in all of Russian opera, and, although there are no really set arias, there are extended streams of glorious music, much of it inspired by Russian folk melodies and Old Slavonic chant.

The Opus Arte, especially in Acts II and III, suffers from the plague of the ""regisseurs,"" moving the drama, which is clearly set in the time of the Mongol invasion, into the 21st century, into a rather sleazy bar room setting (especially Act II), with skin heads and ladies of the night. The director is apparently attempting to make some points about the end times, but I find it disagreeable to see such a scene when the singers continually talk of the Tartars and the Golden Horde.

The Naxos/Cagliari production, which was co-produced with the Bolshoi, at least places the action--if a bit vaguely--in the proper time frame. Nevertheless, as some writers have indicated, not everything adds up, and, again, there are some basic inconsistencies. Nevertheless, visually it is more satisfying, overall, than the Netherlands Opera production.

As to the vocalism, actually both productions are pretty good. The Fevoniya on the Opus Arte set is Svetlana Ignatovich, and she is a delight, with a bright and creamy voice that captivates from the beginning. Her Prince Vsevolod is the young and handsome Maxim Aksenov; they make a photogenic couple. Indeed, their extended scenes are quite rewarding.

On the Naxos/Dynamic set the Fevronia is Tatiana Monogarova, whose voice is a bit darker, even huskier, but still very fine. Her Prince Vsevolod is Vitaly Panfilov, who, in contrast to Aksenov, is dressed in traditional Medieval Russian garb with a beard---no young dashing prince this time. Again, the couple do well, although Western listeners may opt for the brighter voice of Ignatovich.

The remainder of the casts  are more or less good throughout. Nevertheless, the ultra-contemporary dress of those in the Netherlands production tended to put me off, despite my efforts and desire to understand what the director was attempting.

Like some of the other purchasers of the Naxos, I found the synchronization between the audio and the visual off about a second; it is jarring, and I hope that Naxos will correct it (as I wouldn't mind purchasing that set once again). Synchronization in the Opus Arte set seems just fine.

One thing I've noticed recently in some releases: the Opus Arte set doesn't give track listings in their booklet, and that is regrettable, I think. The Naxos does provide track listings.

Both sets provide background notes, and act summaries. And both put the opera on two DVDs.

For me THE LEGEND OF THE INVISIBLE CITY OF KITEZH is a truly great opera, one that deserves a truly grand and naturalist production that places it in proper historical context. Dare we hope that a third DVD set---perhaps with Gergiev and the Maryinski---will eventually appear?

In the meantime, if your budget permits I suggest you get both these DVD sets, especially for the singing and for the incredible music of Rimsky-Korsakov.",1391817600,20,3519,5.081455805892547
8484423,2,B005RY7NBS,"This Rimsky-Korsakov's masterpiece, combining two old Russian legends, is very well played by Marc Albrecht & Netherlands Philharmonic Orchestra. And Svetlana Ignatovich is stunning as Fevroniya.
However, stage director Dmitri Tcherniakov manages to destroy the story into what I believe must be the most ugly opera experience ever. Shame on him, an indignity towards all lovers of beautiful operas!",1389744000,21,399,5.779661016949152
