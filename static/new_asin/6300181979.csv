7804491,2,6300181979,"The Raven & The Black Cat, 1934 film

These two horror movies feature Bela Lugosi (Blaszko) and Boris Karloff (William Henry Pratt). Both became famous in horror movies and rarely played in normal dramas. Bela had an interesting past before he arrived in America. Boris came from a family of civil servants and was more versatile.

The Raven from 1935 tells how an older brain surgeon goes crazy over the daughter of a judge who is in love with his younger colleague. Dr. Vollin collects Edgar Allan Poes works and has a strange hobby of building machines in the basement of his mansion. But it all turns out alright for the surviving good guys.

The Black Cat from 1934 tells how travelers seek shelter in a mansion after an accident. This house is ruled by a madman! The husband finds his pistol missing! Somehow the young married couple escape this madhouse. Will a madman destroy his mansion? Is there a Bluebeard that preserves his women like canned tomatoes? Is this story simply incredible?",1439251200,,997,4.7514450867052025
7804492,5,6300181979,"This vhs contains 2 of Universal's finest horror films. Both starring Universal's most iconic horror actors, Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff.

The Raven features Lugosi as an egomaniac and Edgar Allen Poe obsessed doctor who keeps a torture chamber in his basement. He falls in love with a young girl. When he finds out he can't have her he plans to torture her along with her family and friends. First he needs help from an experienced killer. He performs plastic surgery on the killer, played by Karloff, making half of of his face hideously deformed. I won't give away the rest of the story. A must for fans of classic horror!!!

The Black Cat (having absolutly nothing to do with the Poe story it is named after) is another classic. Lugosi, fresh out of a WW1 prison camp reunites with an old friend. A friend, played by Karloff, who is the priest of a Satanic cult and keeps dead bodies preserved in his basement. Lugosi and Karloff's characters play a deadly game of chess to decide whether or not to sacrifise a girl who ends up stranded there after a car wreck. Starts off kinda slow but gets really good. Great imagery, very creepy. Another classic!!!!

Forget the Karloff and Lugosi rivalry. Lugosi and Karloff are both great monsters! Karloff gets to play a more sympathetic character while Lugosi is pure evil in the Raven and the other way around in the Black Cat.

Great, chilling stories and like most Universal horror movies contains some campy humor. Torture and satanism were quite taboo for 1930s movies and these ones definetly pushed the envolope. A must have for your horror collection!!!!!!!",1333756800,,1612,4.746428571428571
