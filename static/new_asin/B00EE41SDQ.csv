8604443,2,B00EE41SDQ,"Sound is out of sync on Meet the Parents, which is a brilliant comedy, but the sound is off just enough to spoil everything.  If your eyesight is bad enough that you can't follow the lip movements it's fine.  The sound is fine on Meet the Fockers, but that movie is more kitch than brilliance (but some people may love it, especially Barbra Streisand as sex therapist).  .
Have not watched the other 2 yet, but I remember I liked Reality Bites when it came out.  All 4 films are PG-13.",1424044800,,485,4.2967032967032965
