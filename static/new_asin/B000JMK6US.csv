8152339,3,B000JMK6US,"I was looking to purchase a collection of horror/scary movie trailers from the days of my youth.  I was planning a Halloween movie night party and wanted to start it out with a few classic, scary (and perhaps comical) ""Coming Attraction"" movie trailers from long ago. I ordered this video with high hopes. Upon receiving it and viewing it in advance, I realized I could not use it for the intended purpose. The problem for me was that this collection does not have any way to select what you are going to see. It simply has one trailer after another with no break. Some of these old trailers are quite long and I felt like after watching for a period of time, that my guests would be bored with the long and often similar trailers for movies that even I had never heard of and were ""B"" movies at best. So, this video didn't really suit me.",1289260800,3,839,4.343949044585988
8152340,5,B000JMK6US,"Great collection of Coming Attractions.  Lots of fun.  I thought it might be a little jarring going from black and white to color and from horror to science fiction, but it flows really well.  And the prints are great!!!  Wish it was longer or they turned out a few more in the series.",1212624000,,285,4.320754716981132
8152341,4,B000JMK6US,"I'm something of a collector of sci-fi and horror film trailers, and I really enjoyed seeing some of the rare clips in this collection.  I'm not bragging, but I have close to 300 trailers in my collection, and I'd never seen over half of these.  Even one, for HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL, differs significantly from the one I'd seen many times elseswhere.  And there are some fairly obscure ones: From Hell It Came, The Cyclops, Dr. Terror's House of Horrors...to name just a few.

As with most compilations of this kind, the image quality varies.  But overall, I'd rate these trailers in the GOOD to VERY GOOD category.  Sound is uniform throughout, except on 2 or 3 trailers where it softens a bit.  The only real complaint I can think of is that the clips are sandwiched together very tightly, meaning a new trailer sometimes starts before you realize the previous one has ended.  That's not a problem if you're watching the whole disc at one time, but it can be a tad annoying if you're trying to view only specific chapters.

If you're into this sort of thing, this is a worthwhile investment.  In terms of quality, it's miles above similar complilations available from Cheezy Flicks Entertainment.",1211241600,,1197,4.711538461538462
