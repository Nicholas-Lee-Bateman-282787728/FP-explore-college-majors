I purchased it for my family because there is not a lot to choose from at the theaters or on TV.  The story line was good...I loved seeing places that I have actually visited, I cried, laughed, and cheered.  It is as good if not better than ""Remember the Titans"".  My family will definitely be on the lookout for more films produced by Jenkins Entertainment.  What a great way to woo the secular world to a life of faith!",1029974400,2,523,4.148514851485149
1723831,4,B0000687GG,"I originally purchased this DVD for the extra Jars of Clay material (DVD includes the video for the hit song ""Collide"").  The score was also written by Jars lead singer Dan Haseltine.  However, after watching this film (This was the first movie of the Left Behind series I've ever seen), ""refreshing"" was the overall feeling.  The story of the Alabama football team gives an overall inspiration similar to ""Remember The Titans"" and ""The Rookie"".  After watching this, I'll have to check out the rest of the ""Left Behind"" series!",1029888000,4,528,4.898876404494382
1723832,5,B0000687GG,"Ok , first let me preface this with my attitude going in. Almost all ""Christian"" movies are found lacking.....either the story is shallow or the cinematography is weak or the dialog just seems unrealistic. This movie is NOT your typical ""Christian"" flick. It was as good as any major-budget film and the story BLOWS AWAY ""Remember The Titans"". This is probably the best movie nobody saw last year , and if you haven't seen it , friend , you are missing a great film. It really captures the attitude and presence of highschool football in Alabama. Watching it makes you wish it were Friday night so you could go back to your alma mater to pull the boys on....and you do just that while watching this movie. HIGHLY RECOMENDED , esp. for Fathers/Sons to see together !",1029801600,5,765,4.591240875912408
1723833,4,B0000687GG,"Not being a fan of the Left Behind series, I was cynical going into this movie, because I heard it was from Jerry B. Jenkins, author of that series.  However, I was pleasantly surprised, as the movie wasn't preachy or poorly done like most movies with Christians behind them.  This was a very good movie, on any scale.  The acting was terrific (if this were a bigger movie, Terry O'Quinn would get an award nomination), Lacey Chabert looked gorgeous (man, has she grown up!), and the music was amazing.
The story wasn't flawless, but by the end, I was swept up in the emotion of this small town and their passion for their football team, and I was really moved.  Do yourself a favor and see this movie, whether you like football or not.
I especially recommend getting the DVD, because I saw on the ""Legend"" website that there's a new Jars of Clay music video that they shot on the set.  Can't wait!",1028937600,9,898,4.451219512195122

1723839,2,B0000687GG,"A slow moving, boring film.  I almost shut the dvd player off several times.
The music was way too loud at times, and the acting was mediocre.
The coach was mean to the football team, and often had outbursts of temper.  He mostly insulted the team, rather than
teach and motivate them.
I really can't think of anything good in the film, except for the way a girl showed caring for nbr. 40, the hero of the story.",1388275200,,412,4.269230769230769

1723841,5,B0000687GG,"This is a movie that has gotten better the longer I think about it.  The first time I saw it I was very disappointed with what I saw as a ""double downer"" ending.  But later I've come to appreciate its general theme.  A theme involving how fighting an unwinnable fight can still be satisfying and honorable even when defeat is inevitable.

And just maybe, it is even more honorable to know that defeat is inevitable and still fight anyway.  At any rate this movie does an excellent job of promoting the idea that there are different kinds of victories and not all of them show up on the scoreboard or in the newspaper.

For a middle aged man like myself,  the overall concept that so much of our lives is spent ""managing our decline"" and that it is the ""victories you win on the way down that mean the most"" is a compelling one.  In this regard the movie shines.

Terry O'Quinn is perfectly cast as the stereotypical hard nosed high school football coach still grieving for his son after more than a decade.  He brings a great deal to the roll as a man who hates what his world is becoming yet manages to adapt and move on anyway.  The last comments by two opposing players in the aftermath of the state championship game are worth remembering and the final scene of the movie will remain with you a long time.

All in all, highly recommended.",1354320000,,1342,4.388663967611336

What I like about Hometown Legend is the way the main characters have a faith discussion without beating the audience over the head with a King James family Bible!  What Christians and non-Christians alike should take away from this movie is the point that we are all on the same team.  Whether it be as a church, family, community, in the workplace, or sports team, we are not at our best when we try to do life alone.  There are people around us that care for us, and the sooner we realize that, the better off we are.  My favorite line in the movie is when Lacey Chabret is praying and she says, ""So how about it God?  What do you say you show up and show off?""",1250294400,,1509,6.614213197969543

1723850,4,B0000687GG,"While you wait for ""Facing the Giants"" to come out on DVD, I think this film is worth another look. Despite a few faults this is basically a feelgood movie adolescents and adults can watch together.

I cringed at some of the ridiculous profanities in ""Gridiron Gang"" which were obviously added by Hollyweird types and did nothing but offend many audience members. The worst thing in ""Legend"" is a few anatomy references. No sex, no rape, just a good basic movie.

1723853,1,B0000687GG,"Jerry Jenkins ought to be ashamed. He states in an interview on this DVD that he started a movie company because he thought this was such a good story that it needed to be told. First and foremost it's a terrible movie, Christian or secular it's just plain bad. The script stinks, the characters are unlikable and weak, the directing and editing is high school quality and most of the acting is pathetic. As for it being a ""Christian"" movie you've got to be kidding me. Why? Because there's no cussing? Is that what makes it Christian? The gospel is not portrayed in any way, shape or form. In fact the way I see it it's unbiblical. We even have the main character who doesn't really profess to be a Christian but since she mentions god we assume that she must be (in fact Jesus is never mentioned in the movie) she ends up dating an openly unbelieving boy. Is that the ""Christian"" message we want to send our kids? From now on if Jerry Jerkin's name is on a movie I'm not watching it. This movie robbed two hours of my life I'll never get back. If you want to see a family movie buy a classic made in the 30's or 40's.",1137974400,6,1119,4.233644859813084
1723854,2,B0000687GG,"I ordered your movie ""Hometown Legend"" from CBD because it was portrayed as an inspirational, FAMILY movie.  Since my 8 year old LOVES football and the most recent football movies at the theaters are NOT for kids I was thrilled to see this movie advertised w/ the Jenkins name on it.  Imagine my surprise when it arrived and I saw that it was rated PG for language.  I searched the internet, however, and everything I read said it had NO bad language in it.  So we watched it.  I guess by today's standards your movie would be labeled ""tame"", but by God's standards I found it disturbing.  I just can't believe that you spent 108 minutes & who knows how much money to make a Godless movie.  Aren't there enough of those out there?  Sure, God was mentioned, but only in passing and in my opinion quite sarcastically and not as King of Kings & Lord of Lords!  There were only a ""couple"" swear words, but quite a few places of crude humor as well as a teen love story (need I mention the teen girl's attire?!).  Why?  Were you trying to appeal to the unsaved audience?  Isn't that what's wrong w/ our churches in this country?  Unsaved people don't want to watch movies just like their own.  They want to see a difference!  Why didn't you make a difference?

I can't believe that I read review after review parading this movie as a great CHRISTIAN movie.  I just don't see it.  To me it was a lame attempt at making a feel good movie w/ just a tad enough religion so that it could be called ""Christian"" but just enough of the world that it would appeal to them.  I believe in the Bible that is deemed ""lukewarm"".  I bought this movie because I believed it would be a movie my son would watch over and over.  However, that is not the case.  I'm saddened that Christianity seems to be watered down in our country and even more sad that the very people I thought were helping the cause of Christ aren't doing that at all.  At least not w/ THIS movie.

The bottom line is I expect what I saw from Disney, but not from you.  What a missed opportunity!",1108512000,12,2043,4.285340314136126
1723855,3,B0000687GG,"As a Christian, I get very very very tired of ""Christian"" movies that always stick the Gospel in your face and pound the need for salvation over your head.  I'm already saved.  I don't need to see the plan of salvation every 10 minutes to be entertained.

Jenkins Entertainment in this film, while claiming they didn't intend for it to be ""evangelical"" in nature, does exactly that.  Too many short-sighted Christians (like in some reviews I've read) like to stand in their pulpits and thump their Bibles and say any script that's not overly Christian or (GASP!) portrays Christians as real, flawed human beings isn't Christian or that the people creating the production are ""turning away from God.""  Jenkins Entertainment proves you can be evangelical without the pulpit.

This movie has some strong Christian characters...and at points I think it's very overt in it's evangelical tone...but the characters are HUMAN BEINGS.  I liked that.  They were people I could know or have known over my life.

Now, that said, I came away a little disappointed by the movie.  There were points I felt the film could have been trimmed a little bit and the flow and story of the film could have been enhanced.  I had a hard time believing Lacey Chabert in her role...not the part itself in how it was written, just the actress playing the part.  I couldn't buy her as being that character.

Overall, worth the price of a rental and a good movie for Family Movie Night.  It's also one you could watch with your non-Christian friends and not be ashamed to be showing it to them (unlike a lot of ""Christian"" films that do not even match up to the quality of made for TV movies.)",1092960000,7,1663,4.6506849315068495
1723856,4,B0000687GG,"Probably a good movie for adolescents (certainly as good as any other film in it's genre - 'Remember the Titans', 'Breaking Away', 'Hoosiers', ad infinitum) but not much meat for adults.
The one thing that distinguishes this film from the others is it's Christian flavor, (the film was apparently made by those with a decidedly Christian world view) and that's worth noting.
I have no doubt that many secularists were turned off by the repeated references to God, the explicit Christianity of a central character, and the overall lack of a profane tone to this pigskin flick. I'm sure they feel the movie was somehow besmirched by the injection of religious doctrine into a film that should have been left untainted in all it's football virginity.
What's laughable is these folks don't realize how propagandized they've been through the years by all the other sports movies they've seen.
Religion, specifically BORN AGAIN CHRISTIANITY, is a key, vital and central role to almost any successful football franchise at any level. From Reggie White to Deon Sanders to Kurt Warner, Joe Gibbs and Darrell Green (and those are just the pros!) football is led, filled with, and dominated by dedicated in-your-face Born Again Christians.
The fact you see virtually NONE of that in almost all the other supposedly `realistic' football films, (Oliver Stone's Any Given Sunday and ESPN""s The Playmakers come first to mind) is an indictment of how hostile-Hollywood has scrubbed every vestige of Christianity from it's presentation of team sports in a manner that would've made the Soviet Union quite proud.
Ever wonder about that? How come so many of the elite professional athletes are honest to goodness God worshippers, yet even the most modern  films about  these sports give, at best, a mere tip of the hat to `the man upstairs'?
You cannot overstate the influence of born again Christianity in sports today. From the most recent #1 NBA draft choice to the MVP of last year's Super Bowl, these guys have all publicly and repeatedly declared how important Jesus is in their life.
So, in that context, this film, despite being made with the hopes of at least being quasi-evangelical, is actually quite timid. (It's quite enlightening to see how Christians, even when making their OWN statement on the subject, are still so brow beaten by the hostile mainstream culture, that they tread so lightly.) Born again Christians, at least in this country, truly are a persecuted MAJORITY.
BTW, I am not joining the cheap shot choir of those judging the film for childish reasons, like the alleged use of 'piss' or 'ass' in the dialogue. Sorry, superficiality is NOT a Godly character trait.  (Perhaps, I should say is gnat.)
Overall, the film is cute, has a nice unpredictable ending with silver linings, and is bereft of most of the schmaltzy stuff that dooms similar films of this ilk.
However, the hot female protagonist is still sort of a `savior' to the unsaved football hero, which makes it no different than secular films in this regard. I mean, normally the woman flat out IS the flawed hero's savior. In this film, it's a Christian woman, but she's still nonetheless the one he `needs' to show him the way.  Implicit message: Men need women to civilize them. Let them teach us about God.  Not exactly Gen 2 if you catch my drift.
Long story short. A small step for man, but not much of a leap for The Kingdom.

1723858,2,B0000687GG,"This is the first film produced by Jerry Jenkins and his son, Dallas and their company Jenkins Entertainment. Jerry Jenkins is most known as a co-author with Tim LaHaye of the Left Behind series. The movie was released last year in limited theaters across the country and is now available on DVD and VHS. I first saw the movie at Zondervan and was excited that Jenkins was using his talents to produce Christian film.
I picked up the DVD a few days later and eagerly anticipated what I was about to see. It didn't take long for me to be let down. Don't get me wrong, the film is well done. The acting is good and the story is intriguing. The problem is that all the things that make the Left Behind series so effective as a witnessing tool are missing. As one secular, unsaved film critic put it, Hometown Legend contains ""a Christian message that is simply too soft to be effective or impressive.""
The greatest sin the film commits is the sin of weakness. The moral message is badly underplayed, in hopes of not scaring the secular audience away.
The movies most ""Christian"" character, Rachel says early in the film that a great coach is ""50% teacher, 50% S.O.B."" She repeatedly fails to use oportunities to witness to Elvis. When he says near the end of the film, ""I don't have what you have."" She merely responds, ""You can."" No gospel, no mention of Christ being what is different about her. In the end she hooks up with the still unsaved, albeit nicer and changed, Elvis. This is symbolized by a pasionate kiss. She does pray to open the movie and asks Elvis, ""Have you ever dared to think there's something bigger than you?"" This is the closest thing to presenting the gospel in the film.
Other problems pop up throughout the film. A player is hit in the groin and the coach tells his teammates to help him ""pop his nuts out."" Coach Schuler calls a player an ass and an opposing coach a piss ant. He also is a hothead. He yells at the refs, throws things, and kicks players off the team for not joining a fight after a game. He is reminiscent of a Bobby Knight on the football field. When later in the film he has the team pray before a game, it seems out of character. During a talk with the team he makes the sacreligious statement, ""Unless Jesus Christ Himself comes down here on a white horse"" the team won't win. Allusions in the film to drugs and alcohol add to the confusion.
I must say that had this been a movie made by Hollywood, I would have been pleasantly surprised that it was relatively wholesome and thankful that there was any allusion to faith in God and prayer. However, knowing it was a film produced by Christians, disappointed is an understatement.
Jenkins stated that, ""Our script wasn't preachy or evangelical."" He is definately right. Portrayals of Christians like those in this film only hinder the testimony of Christ. Our lives and message must be distinct.
In the opening scene, Rachel prays for God to ""show up and show off."" Unfortunately, Jerry and Dallas Jenkins did not do much to allow God to do either.",1081900800,9,3043,4.494584837545126

The cinematography is excellent, the acting is superb and there is absolutely no OVER acting that we so commonly see. Incredible movie! I highly recommend it for the whole family",1031529600,6,638,4.556521739130435

She really has matured and become a very beautiful woman before our eyes. So I decided to rent this movie which is one of the best sports movies I've ever watched. When the town of Athens which has has had a 12 year fottball losing streaks faces the reality their school maybe closed forever, along comes a young kid named Elvis Jackson (Nick Cornish) who will bring back the spirit of the game, and in the process take them to the championships. A very decent movie with good story-telling, and a great cast. Terry O'Quinn actually starred in a role that gave him a chance to be funny and great as the coach.",1031443200,3,729,4.367647058823529
1723865,5,B0000687GG,"I was unsure of what to expect from Hometown Legend. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. In fact, this film marks a new standard for Christian Cinema.
The story was very good. I did not find it to have any major unexpected twists, but it was different from many of our modern ""feel-good"" movies that solve all the world's problems in a couple of hours. In fact, the movie ends surprisingly. I'll not ruin it for you. Even though all the world's problems don't get solved by the end of the film, the viewer is still left with a wonderful feeling that the important things in life have been realized. This movie reflects masterful storytelling.
The characters were different than in many movies. The whole movie is from a Christian world-view, so that makes a big difference. I cannot recall anyone smoking in the film and there is no sex (not even implied sex). I was a little surprised to hear the acronym S.O.B. used. Also, one of the coaches from an opposing team uses one curse word. So, this film is pretty much squeaky clean.
The quality of this movie is why I claim it takes Christian Cinema to a new level. This is a feature length film with great editing, wonderful camera work, and fine acting. I have not seen another Christian film that was filmed this well. Except perhaps ""Chariots of Fire"" - in it's day, that film was a benchmark. I would even say Hometown Legend is a higher quality production than the Left Behind movie.
I am very impressed with film. I rented it tonight. It is going on my Christmas list. I want to own this one. I think most people will enjoy it.",1031270400,14,1590,4.448630136986301
1723866,5,B0000687GG,"****************************************************************
Finally, a film of its kind that is so very worth watching!
I have been following the production of this film for a while now.  The first time I heard about the film being made was in a small article in New Man Magazine.  It was located at the end of an article about the film ""A Walk to Remember"", which is also a film that has gained allot of respect from me.  Since I read that little article, I have been following the film's progressas much as I could via cyber space.  I also read Jerry B. Jenkins' novel Hometown Legend which is based on the screenplay.

I have always been fascinated by the artistic angle on life films take.  I realize that there are many filmmakers that are just out to make a quick buck, but then there are also those films that have been made due to a passionate drive of an individual.  That individual had experienced or has dreamed of experiencing something very grand, and so they are driven to share that imagery and experience with the others around them.  The job done on Hometown Legend is just that...a work of Passion!  Or at least, that was the impression I came away with.  In my opinion, one of the most visual producers to date is Jerry Bruckheimer.  Ever since the days prior to Don Simpson's death, I have seen how Mr. Bruckheimer has had an ""eye"" for visuals.  And I have felt that those images are what have made him and his films so attractable to audiences of all sorts, not the action sequences that the media lays to his fame.  Hometown Legend has allot of that same imagery and style.  That's why I feel that this is only the first in a long line of excellent films to come from Dallas Jenkins.  As an example, one of my favorite shots in the film comes in at 01:08:05 into the film.  It is where Coach Schuler and the team are coming out of the locker rooms and the director has this low angle shot on them and the bleachers as people wave pompoms in their direction.  That was a breathtaking shot.  Not only was it excellent visually, but the musical score cue for that segment couldn't have been more emotional.  Mr. Haseltine has an awesome eye for film scoring.  Even with the use of independent musicians, the entire soundtrack is awesome.  To top it off, that shot works so well because of the fine acting of Terry O'Quinn.  He was an excellent casting choice as Coach Schuler.  His voice is an exact match to that of Robert Duvall's...another icon actor.  Films such as this are why I personally am so interested in films and filmmaking.  Not only are they great storylines, but they have very positive undertones as well.
The only dislike of this film is not on the part of the filmmakers at all.  It is on the part of the crew at Warner Brothers Home Video.  Why would you dissapoint your loyal fans by releasing only a Pan Scan version of the DVD?  That is such an insult and a dismay.  A beautiful film such as this deserves the original theatrical treatment and nothing less.  I surely hope and pray that one day your company and all other production companies out there will one day wake up and see that there truly is a place for films of this style in our society...why not take the initiative and be a trendsetter and put these films out with a BANG!  Widescreen, commentaries, documentaries, isolated score tracks, trailers, the whole sha-bang!  Utilize the abilities of a DVD disk!
Even still, don't fret all you possible Hometown Legend purchasers out there.  Still, even in pan scan, it is well worth the money.  The DVD version includes a very entertaining commentary with Dallas Jenkins (producer) and James Anderson (director), Information on Jerry B. Jenkins, Theatrical Trailer, and a cool video from Jars of Clay!  So, don't hesitate, I guarantee you'll walk away from this film feeling like you won the Super Bowl!

Even you girls will find it extremely entertaining. The actors were awesome, the story line was fantastic, the directing obviously turned out superb. I have already watched it like Five times. I think everybody should at least see this movie. If you haven't fallen in love with it and already bought it! Its really awesome.

It is put together amazingly and the acting is heartfelt.  It has been a long time since such an uplifting movie has had the courage to openly talk about faith without becoming preachy and forceful.  I love this movie and hope more people check this one out.

I grew up in the south and it made me homesick for a Friday night football game under the lights.  The movie does an excellent job of incorporating the main theme behind the book, and it was great to see what ideas carried over and what new perspectives the producer added.  It's hard to come by a movie these days that I can recommend to anyone, Christian or non-christian, and Hometown Legend definitely falls into that category.  I love how the message of faith and God are throughout the film but presented in a non-intrustive manner.  Just enough to make everyone who sees the film think twice about where their heart is.  If you want to see a movie that will leave you with that good feeling inside I highly suggest checking this one out.  And to piggy back on a few other reviews...I absolutely LOVED the music!!",1030320000,11,993,4.387978142076503

Direction:  C+
Story:  A-
Character Development:  B-
Dialogue:  B-
Acting:  B
Editing:  B
Cinematography:  A
Music:  A
-----------------
Overall Execution:  B-
Point by point:
Hometown Legend tells an excellent story with decent execution.  The movie starts off powerfully, but in trying to tell its story, the direction loses some footing with some continuity errors and lack of character development (though nothing extravagant)  The acting was decent albeit Terry O'Quinn who pound-for-pound laid on a thick performance.
(Man...he was GOOD.)  As for the editing - it was overbearing on a couple of occasions, but overall it was slick and engaging.  The lighting and cinematography was CRISP making HL a visual treasure.  And finally, the music composed by Jars of Clay front man Dan Haseltine was excellent.  I wish there was a soundtrack!  When the direction was in danger of falling, the music was there to hold it up.
All in all, though it could have been better, Hometown Legend was entertaining, uplifting and best of all...CHEESE free.
Considering its relatively miniscule budget (only $2 million) and
coming from the mind of a first-time director, Hometown Legend is a success.  Give it a try.  You might like it.  I did.
(I bought it before I saw it and have decided to keep it.)
One more thing:  When is the widescreen version coming out on DVD???  Full screen was disappointing.",1030233600,3,1406,5.026086956521739
1723872,5,B0000687GG,"Jenkins Entertainment is going to do well, because on their first attempt they have risen above the stereotypical ""ho-hum"" of many Christian movies of the past.  Dallas Jenkins (son of Jerry B. Jenkins of Left Behind fame) has put a first class work together that any Christian should be proud to show his secular friends.
Terry O'Quinn puts on a stellar performance as the 12-year-removed high school football coach who comes back for one last hurrah.  The town of Athen, Alabama is on its last leg.  The school will be closing after this school year.  Moral is low, and the school's football team, the Crusaders, is an assemblage of ""me, myself & I"" types who've come together for one last grab at town's Jack Schuler Memorial Scholarship to attend the famed University of Alabama.
This movie captures, very well, the devisiveness of the all-for-myself attitude and shows what it means to come together as a team.  Parents with kids playing sports should get this video in front of them so they can see what can happen when minds and hearts change.
An intersting aspect of this movie is the ending (Don't worry, no spoiler here).  Just when you think you know where this movie is headed, the last 20-25 minutes steers you to a different realization.
Way to go, Jenkins Entertainment, for giving us a quality movie that will be loved for years to come.",1029974400,3,1353,4.736170212765957
