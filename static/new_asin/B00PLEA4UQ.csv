8688548,5,B00PLEA4UQ,"This is quite possibly the greatest girl group ever assembled. Understandably for some guys the mere fact that each member is stunningly gorgeous would be enough. Taeyeon has never looked better and Sooyoung should be Miss World. They have all bases covered. They can sing and dance with the best of them. They can do cute and they can do sexy without being trashy. Yes they do show legs and believe me you won't see better sets of legs anywhere else. But to me what makes them so sexy is the way they carry themselves with so much class, positive feel good attitudes, and infectious smiles. This is what's sorely lacking in the American pop scene.  Im sure a lot of female fans love them because of the sisterhood that exists among the members. But all of these qualities wouldn't be enough to make them the greatest girl group if they didn't have the songs and this is what they have in spades. I don't know who writes most of their songs but he or she must be a genius. Their songs are so catchy and you can listen to them multiple times without getting tired of them. The slower numbers really allow you appreciate how well they harmonize and how exquisite they sound when all nine voices blend together. The standout upbeat numbers are Do the Catwalk, Paparazzi, Mr. Mr., Flyers, i actually felt like i could slam dunk from the freethrow line after hearing this song, I Got A Boy was fantastic and blue jeans was more than fantastic. If you've never heard Girls Generation before, start here and you'll fall in love. SNSD forever.........",1467331200,,1543,4.5703971119133575

8688551,5,B00PLEA4UQ,"2014 was not a kind year to SONEs. Long-time fan favorite Jessica Jung was ex-communicated from the group last September due to conflicts between her and label company SM Entertainment. Although Girls' Generation will still continue as an eight-member group, the brand of Girls' Generation has lost part of its mystique. Jessica not only had her own devoted fan base but she was Girls' Generation's first initiated member. The Love & Peace concert DVD/Blu-ray will likely mark the final appearance of Jessica on any Girls' Generation home video release. That would be reason enough for you to purchase this, but there is a lot more.

I am a huge fan of Girls' Generation. If I have the money on hand, I will spend it on their memorabilia. Although I am a big fan, I do watch their concerts with an objective point of view and often they do not deliver at the level I hope they would. I am happy to say that is not the case with this concert. The girls now have a large list of songs in their repertoire. In past concerts it felt as if they were reaching to fill in the two and half hour time, but everything felt so organic in this concert. So many of the performances here are leaps and bounds better than past concerts but more details on that shortly.

I have the Blu-ray limited edition release of this item. It comes in a beautiful slipcase containing a photo booklet and a case holding the Blu-ray disc. It also contains special features not found on the standard release. Special features aside, the Blu-ray quality is crystal clear fantastic. I do not see why anyone would opt for the DVD but there is a matter of price as Japanese Blu-rays are expensive.

Let me start by addressing those of you who are wondering if any version of this release contains subtitles options. They do not. For audio there is a stereo option and a 5.1 surround sound option.

This concert was filmed during the period of July 11, 2014 to July 13, 2014 at the Yoyogi National Gymnasium in Tokyo, Japan.

I will be rating each performance with stars (*) with 5 stars being the highest.

-INTRO-
The concert begins with an introduction video package. The theme here was a museum heist .

MOTORCYCLE (**)
GOSSIP GIRLS (**)
GALAXY SUPERNOVA (**1/4)
FLOWER POWER (**1/4)

Motorcycle was not the best choice for an opening song. It did not have that start-with-a-bang impact many of their other songs have for openers such as Genie. Although I did not approve that song as an opener, I did like the fact that the first group of songs selected were not mega-hits. Yes, Galaxy Supernova and Flower Power were big singles in Japan, but they were not big enough songs to be worthy of placement higher on the concert. Pacing of a concert is difficult to plan for yet essential to having a great show. Whoever was booking this concert, good job.

The girls also seemed really nervous with these first few songs. I can understand as this was the final leg of the Love & Peace Tour and they wanted it be memorable. Fortunately they got the bad stuff out of the way first.

-MC- (Group Introductions)
No corny intro music here for each. Only straight introductions and personality. Just perfect.

YOU-AHOLIC (***3/4)
KARMA BUTTERFLY (****)
THE GREAT ESCAPE (**1/2)

After introductions it felt as though the girls kicked themselves into place and delivered solid performances. In You-aholic, they made perfect use of box props as the girls danced on top of them. It reminded me of something you would see girls do at a club, except this is Girls' Generation and they are 100 times hotter than any girl at a club. Never thought of that song being used that way but it worked. As good as that was, the girls followed it up with Karma Butterfly which had superb choreography. The circle of chairs and motions the girls made worked so well. Big kudos to whoever came up with that. That song/performance was tough to follow. The Great Escape was solid but nothing radically different from past presentations of it.

-MOVIE-
This interlude movie continues the story of the museum heist. It was a good decision for them to weave one long story throughout the night with these different segments. I will not give anything away as it is highly entertaining with good music.

LIPS (***1/2)
MY OH MY (**)
DO THE CATWALK (****1/2)

I do want to take a moment and point out that the way this was concert was filmed was commendable. Not only were the quality of the cameras they used top notch, but they got rid of the excessive music video-like camera cutting technique that would give people seizures. There are performances where they use that technique, but not nearly as much as they had in past home video releases. There are a lot of moments in this concert where the camera focuses on the girls, their expressions, their emotions, and really lets you take all that in. SM has really learned from their past mistakes and this was a huge welcomed improvement.

Lips had great stage props in the form of martini glasses. This was a really good performance and the girls seemed to be into this song. My Oh My had a cute ice cream store concept but the performance was only decent. In a way, it was good that My Oh My was average because Do the Catwalk caught me by surprise. The girls were at the top of their game and the crowd was really hot for this song. Because the song had such strong energy, it almost would have been more appropriate to use this as a closing song but no shame in having it this early. It really helped to give this concert a special vibe.

-MOVIE-
Heist story continued.

LINGUA FRANCA (**)
EUROPA (***)
GIRLS & PEACE (***)

Lingua Franca was not a bad performance but I felt it did not fit into the overall concert and could have been omitted. The songs following it were very solid performances with many fun moments. Not much else to say about them.

-MOVIE-
A cartoon sketch interlude.

TIME MACHINE (***)
NOT ALONE (**3/4)

There is no way Girls' Generation could have known Jessica was departing in about two months' time, but Time Machine almost seemed to speak to her predicament. Actually, this entire concert felt very much like her send off. So many moments in this concert feel like a tribute to her: the close up of Sooyoung holding her during Galaxy Supernova, showing a fan wearing her signature OBEY outfit from I Got a Boy (during their introductions), the closing song which I will talk about later, and many others. Of course I am looking back with the perspective of knowing she is gone from the group, but so many parts unquestionably stand out.

Time Machine and Not Alone were both good performances, with Time Machine being the stronger of the two. This is the part of the concert where they opted for slower music which was a wise booking choice.

-MC-
The girls give a speech.

ALL MY LOVE IS FOR YOU (**)

I felt two slow songs in row were enough. This one felt excessive and you could tell the girls were not as into it as the previous two.

-MOVIE-
Collage of images with cool music.

GENIE (**3/4)
PAPARAZZI (****3/4)
MR.MR. (***1/2)

The performance of Genie on this concert is not their best. The 2011 Tour is probably their best performance of that and this does not come close. However, Paparazzi is a whole different matter. There are many reasons for you to buy this DVD/Blu-ray and the performance of Paparazzi here is one of them. The girls were very much into this performance and once again the crowd was hot for it. This was an amazing performance but what was even more amazing is that this was not the best performance of the night. That comes later. Following this was Mr. Mr. which was really good, a lot better than some of their comeback stage performances, but it could not match Paparazzi's power.

-MOVIE-
Heist story continued.

BEEP BEEP (***)
FLYERS (***3/4)
GEE (**1/2)
LOVE & GIRLS (**)

I know there are a lot of SONEs out there who do not like Beep Beep. I was one of them. I used the word ""was"" because the performance here is so good it actually made me like the song. Their outfits and colorful screen animations make this all the better. Flyers was great and the girls look like they were having a blast with that song. Similar to Genie, the performance of Gee here was not their best. For some reason that crowd was not into Gee either. Love & Girls was solid.

-MC-

EVERYDAY LOVE (***)

Solid performance which served as a build up to the encore.

-MOVIE-
Encore

MR.TAXI (***)
I GOT A BOY (****)
BLUE JEANS (*****)

We all know when Girls' Generation has a concert in Japan, they have to perform Mr. Taxi. They reserved this performance toward the end because it is one of their first unique and major Japanese songs so it is only fitting that they give it a prestigious high spot on the concert. The performance of it was solid but the girls did not seem as enthused with the song as they have been in the past. Following that was I Got A Boy and it was amazing. This has to be one of the best performances of this song I have ever seen and trust me, I have seen many of them.

As much praise as I have for I Got A Boy, I have even more for Blue Jeans. This is by far the best live performance of any song I have ever seen the girls do. Everything clicked (the dance, girls' expressions, hot crowd, the song itself) and it was phenomenal. The positioning of this song on the concert was perfect as well. This was a truly special night as you could feel the event building to a wonderful crescendo and Blue Jeans was the climax. This was certainly worth the high price of the Blu-ray. I expected it to be the final performance of the night, putting the girls out with a bang, but there was still one more performance left.

-MC-
The last MC segment and the girls gave their final thank you speech.

STAY GIRLS (***1/2)

Being realistic, nothing could follow Blue Jeans. Even in normal circumstances, Stay Girls would only have been an average closer. However, having knowledge now that Jessica would not be part of the group just a few short months after this gives the song a whole new meaning. The performance resonates more powerfully and all I can think of is the journey and memories of Girls' Generation's years together as a nine-member group.

SPECIAL FEATURES

There is a final day tour diary and documentary, both are exclusive to the Blu-ray limited edition release. However, the documentary is not comprehensive. I still wish these documentary special features were much longer chronicling the conception of the concert to the execution of the show. While it was not what I was hoping to see, they were still entertaining.

FINAL THOUGHTS

Amazing. I am usually quite critical of my girls but I can honestly say this is hands down Girls' Generation's best concert. Overall, I give this concert a 9/10. My Amazon star rating is for the concert, bonus content, and product packaging. Whether you are a general K-pop fan or a SONE, make the purchase. The atmosphere/vibe of this concert, the girls' performances, hot crowd, and final appearance of Jessica on a home video release makes this product a true gem. Buy it to own a piece of Korean pop culture history.",1422403200,7,11125,4.545545545545545
8688552,5,B00PLEA4UQ,"Love these gals, can't give them less than 5 stars.  But one thing did bother me about 3rd tour versus 1 and 2.  Move around some!  For three consecutive slow songs in the middle of the set they stand (or sit) in place and sing.  It's like they're old and tired all the sudden lol.  I think they're at their best when they're moving especially when they get to the far reaches of the stage and interact with the audience.  That's certainly what they did in the earlier tours.

The video quality is awesome on bluray though the computer screen background can get a bit distracting, especially since they dance in front of it so often.  That's great for the live crowd, not so much when it's being filmed.  Minor complaints aside you need this in your collection (but get 1 and 2 first).",1420934400,,785,4.395833333333333
8688553,5,B00PLEA4UQ,"This 3rd Japan Tour - released 2014.12.24 - comes, as always, in four versions:

1) Normal DVD

4) Limited Blu Ray UPXH-29005, UPC 4 988005 849571

Note: there may also be Taiwan versions, I'm not sure what regions those disks would be in, but Japan-region Blurays will play in US players, Japan-region DVD's will not.
Note: Amazon currently has the wrong picture for the normal edition bluray. It should be mostly blue, not pink, with about a half inch of clear plastic at the top of the case.

The track lists are the same except the Limited Editions also have ""Tour Diary"" and ""Documentary: 2014 Tour Final Day tour"".
The limited editions come in nicer cases and have a photobook.

**********************************************************************************************************************

The biggest difference I see here is the movies and graphics on the stage screens are much better. I have watched the movie between Mr Mr and Beep Beep probably 15-20 times this past week. I purposely start at that movie, I love it. It is very high quality. ""Beep Beep"" was one of the very few SNSD songs I (previously) didn't like, but the graphics behind it are very good, I now actually almost like that song.

I have not watched the entire concert enough yet, I'll update more later, but for now I'll say Taeyeon is awesome at the beginning of Love and Girls, Tiffany is beautiful, and the movies are very good and most/all connected - all part of a longer movie, with a number of very good male actors.",1420156800,2,2241,4.610552763819095
