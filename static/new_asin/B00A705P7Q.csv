5391439,4,B00A705P7Q,"A nice light-hearted story with good actors; worth your time to watch.  Korean dramas are interesting in that they are like morality plays:  good and evil are patent, but believable; and oftentimes there's a lot of grey area that makes one think about and learn more of cultural values.  I enjoy them.",1365552000,3,301,4.75
5391440,4,B00A705P7Q,"While the title doesn't translate into an accurate reflection of this movie, I was quite surprised and impressed by the action and lightheartedness of the film.  Opening with a fast-paced, inventive introduction and continuing with a whirlwind plot and credible action, this movie caught me by surprise.  It's clever, interesting with a family of appealing characters, this movie may spawn other imitations or even an American adaptation.  It's a fun couple of hours and worth the time.  Highly recommended.",1365465600,,507,5.379746835443038
5391441,5,B00A705P7Q,The Righteous Thief is our first Korean martial arts action comedy. It will not be our last. Pokes fun at Hollywood cliches along the way and gives Oceans Eleven a run for its money.,1363305600,3,182,4.382352941176471

Great set up with the ""Robin Hood"" family of thieves.  Terrific villain with a penchant for toys and comic book characters.  Absolutely loved the birthday singers!

5391465,5,B00A705P7Q,"The original Legend of Hong Gil Dong was written in the 1600 during the Chosen Dynasty by Huh Gyun.  He was the illegitimate son of a nobleman and his mother was not of nobility.  When the movie starts it states that Hong Gil Dong was not able to call his father, ""Father"" nor address his siblings accordingly, that was the custom of that time. That was the life of the writer Huh Gyun, a second class, half nobility. There have been many Legend of Hong Gil Dong movies and dramas in the original historical settings.  This one of course is not, but it was very funny and entertaining.",1447718400,,585,4.398148148148148

5391471,3,B00A705P7Q,"I consider the quality as an afternoon movie martini. Namely, an acceptable movie with a decent story line and reasonable characters to pass away a hot afternoon. There were a number of light hearted moments involving the main character, his girl friend and his brother. The action scenes were reasonable, not too over the top, nor rudimentary. Not a movie that I would see multiple times.",1437177600,,389,4.909090909090909

5391510,5,B00A705P7Q,"This was a pleasant surprise.  Many Korean movies fall into repetitive traps stereotyping individuals.  This one I found broke many molds in a good way.  It has some very solid comedy, from verbal to action slap stick.  It has romance in a different way than most movies.  The biggest surprise was the action.  This is a solid action movie with a compelling story line that keeps moving, with the comedy chasing it as you go.

All in all, I would rank this at the top of Korean action flicks.  It it an action movie, but I laughed out loud all through the movie.  The verbal humor is very well written.  It took a bit to remember the prosecutor from ""My Girlfriend is a Gumiho"" series, and to me that made it funnier when I remembered his old role.  Enjoy it!",1409616000,3,759,4.35

Hong, Gil-dong is a very well known story character, from Hoh Kyun, and the character is equivalent to Robin Hood of the Western world.

Other than the lame act of the other Hong family members other than the elderly son, the plot and how the story unfold are simple but entertaining.",1406073600,,327,4.52542372881356

Funny, romance, thriller, you have it all.  The only thing is the male lead is a little short and not as good looking as his brother.  Other than that, everyone is great with their parts.  This is just as good as 200 Pound Beauty.  I recommend it.",1401753600,2,402,4.223684210526316
5391518,3,B00A705P7Q,"I agree with others who wrote that it is cheesy but fun and reminds you of a mix of Mission Impossible with Kungfu Hustle.
The movie is an action thriller romantic comedy, if that make any sense. One of the costars is the dad from one of my favorite TV shows Reply 1994 (Sung Dong-il). He plays a similar role in the movie, comic relief. Some of the stunts were obviously impossible but it didn't ruin the movie too much for me.

5391545,4,B00A705P7Q,"THE RIGHTEOUS THIEF (a.k.a. ""Descendants of Hong Gil Dong"") takes a page from the Robin Hood mythos. By day, Hong Mu-Hyeok (Lee Beom-Soo) is a mild-mannered high school music teacher. By night (and, okay, also by day when he could sneak out) Hong Mu-Hyeok is a thief. He is, in fact, the 18th generation descendant of the legendary folk hero, Hong Kil-dong, a thief who stole from the rich and gave to the poor way back in the Joseon Dynasty era (somewhen in the late 14th century).

Abetted by his family of thieves, Hong Mu-Hyeok has been pulling off daring heists, filching money from under the nose of corrupt businessman, Chairman Lee Jeong-Min (Kim Su-Ro). An unexpected complication surfaces when Hong Mu-Hyeok learns that his fiance and fellow educator Song Hyeon Hwa (Lee Si-Young) is the sister of the dogged Song Jae-Pil (Song Dong-Il) of the Seoul Prosecutor's Office. Song Jae-Pil has made it his mission to get the goods on Chairman Lee. Considering the lawful methods he applies versus Hong Mu-Hyeok's more underhanded techniques, these two are destined to butt heads.

If, like me, you'd been missing Stephen Chow's blend of chuckles and martial arts, may I suggest THE RIGHTEOUS THIEF? It's a Korean caper film and, no, it won't be as memorable - or, for western audiences, as eyeopening - as Chow's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kung-Fu-Hustle-Axe-Kickin-Edition/dp/B000QGEB12/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kung Fu Hustle (Axe-Kickin' Edition)</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaolin-Soccer/dp/B004XVMCPI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaolin Soccer</a>. Yet it produces enough gratifying moments. It's key that there are enough dramatic moments to advance the characters and the narrative. Lee Beom-Soo adroitly handles the obligatory kung fu - in the film's two big action set pieces - while also working in deadpan bits of levity (sue me, but I love the childish running gag with the helium spray). The only one more deadpan with the comedy than Lee Beom-Soo is Kim Su-Ro who plays the film's comic book-obsessed big bad. Kim Su-Ro makes sure to back up his big bad's street creds by offsetting the comic beats with the occasional exhibition of brutality. Lee Si-Young as the fiance is lovely but also very funny, whether she's doling out those aggressive kisses or having a soccer ball catapult off her head. And maybe nothing recalls Stephen Chow's lighthearted, offbeat brand more readily than the sequence in which Chairman Lee dances a tango with his secretary, and his henchmen start grooving along. I say, watch this one, man. It's goofy good.",1376611200,4,2665,5.561576354679803
5391546,5,B00A705P7Q,"If your a fan of Korean content, then you'll love this film.  Lee Beom Soo from Iris 2 is the star, and his girlfriend in it is Lee Si Young from the drama Wild Romance. They go up against Kim Su Ro from so many films the first of which I seen him in was Volcano High.  Hong Kil-Dong, a korean Robin Hood type is always a fantastic story.  This film is a great blend of action, drama, and comedy. A 2 hour film that flies by it's so good.  Buy it, you'll love it.",1371859200,,463,3.8421052631578947
