1647167,5,B00005QBZD,"Far and away the best concert footage I have ever seen or heard. An unforgettable journey, which has made me an even more zealous Jeff Lynne fan. (Which I did not think was possible)",1006128000,2,182,4.382352941176471
1647168,5,B00005QBZD,"In what can only be described as an amazing compensation gift for having their tour cancelled, ELO's DVD literally pulls all the right strings. Being a lifelong fan of ELO after first seeing them on The Midnight Special belting out ""In the Hall of the Mountain King"", I have followed them religiously and was lucky enough to see them live on 3 separate tours. I even bit the bullet and saw ELO 2 a couple of years ago. I have clung to the hope for the last 9 or 10 years that Jeff Lynne would put out some of his own music for a change and my dream was realized earlier this year with the release of the wonderful Zoom. Although the record was horribly marketed as well as the subsequent ill-fated tour, my enthusiasm for the new music was not abated. In what can be considered a gift from the rock gods, this DVD will surely be a prized possession for years to come. The great surprise of this DVD is that Jeff Lynne has only improved upon his immense talent with the passing of time. Not only does he look like he still in a 1970's timewarp with his trademark fro, goatee and shades, his voice and musicianship have never been better. His singing is unparalleled and he hits every note flawlessly. He even displays some real guitar chops on hits like Ma Ma Belle and Roll Over Beethoven. His singing on Moment in Paradise, Can't Get it Out of My Head, Telephone Line and the surprising addition of One Summer Dream literally left me teary-eyed and speechless. The new band's playing is superlative and in my opinion, come the closest to duplicating ELO's studio sound I have ever heard from any incarnation of the band. There's a generous serving of hits scattered throughout the set and a bunch of new songs from Zoom. My only complaint, would have been to jettison a few of the weak songs like Easy Money and State of Mind from Zoom and to have inserted a few other hits. I know, they didn't perform Fire on High or Getting to the Point but the addition of those 2 favorite songs of mine would have really put it over the top for me. After getting my big screen TV and home theater system last year, I have become quite enamored at collecting rock concert DVDs like Talking Heads ""Stop Making Sense"" and The Moody Blues ""Hall of Fame"". But, I always longed for a state of the art ELO DVD to complete the set. The Live at Wembley disc just doesn't cut it because of the antiquated recording technology used then which sounds so hollow compared to today's digital quality. To me this DVD is important because it captures Lynne at his zenith and I will always have this moment captured in time forever to watch while I become a decrepit old man. This is truly a great show and I hope Lynne continues to record and perhaps launch a more modest and carefully marketed tour in the near future.",1006128000,114,2791,4.4003868471953576
1647169,5,B00005QBZD,"For those of you who might have caught ELO on the VH1 Storytellers program back in June and are hesitating about picking up this dvd, let this review quickly assauge your fears.  Yes, the VH1 performance was a bit ""cold,"" not quite ""on."" BUT this dvd features a set that is on FULL THROTTLE, with great production values, great camera work, really surprising sound, and of course, Jeff Lynne. Mr. Lynne is really on it vocally for this performance, and while only he and Richard Tandy are the only original ELO members onstage, one soon forgets this the moment Mr. Lynne sings! Really, don't think twice... this concert dvd is absolutely worth having. It's like being able to see that concert that was not to be. ELO rocks!",1006128000,,723,4.6484375
1647170,5,B00005QBZD,"Let me start by saying that this DVD is a must for any ELO fan. It has many hits covering a span of years dating back to 1972. Jeff Lynne still has it, by gosh! The audio is the best for a concert recording I've heard in a while in 5.1 DTS and 5.1 Digital Surround. The video is crisp and is enhanced for wide screen TV's. It looks great on 65 inch wide screen, to say the least. All of the songs were played faithfully to the way they were originally recorded. This is probably the best thing besides actually being there. I still hold out hopes that there may still be a tour at some point.",1006041600,10,592,4.02542372881356
1647171,5,B00005QBZD,"This is a Wish come true - ELO stuff has been hard to get in the past years. Jeff Lynne ELO's Main Man is back with a BANG  this is a must for any ELO fan.
It contains all the hits from yester-years mixed with the new tunes. All I can say is ""buy it"" You won't be disapointed if your a real ELO fan. The DVD has great sound & the picture quality is Excellent.",1005955200,7,359,3.723684210526316
1647172,5,B00005QBZD,"When I bought the Zoom CD, I was initially a bit disappointed. It was clearly a Jeff Lynne solo album rather than an ELO extravaganza, although he still hadn't lost the knack of writing a great melody. This CD has since grown on me and I now love it. ""Ordinary Dream"" must be just about the best song he's ever written.
In the light of all this, I bought the Zoom DVD with some hesitation. I needn't have worried. Recorded in front of a live audience at Television City in LA, Lynne's adopted home, it is a wonderfully understated surprise. It is a magnificently laid back event for which Lynne has surrounded himself with true professional musicians, including a couple of cellos and not forgetting the rather attractive, almost Stevie Nicks like Rosie Vela on harmonies. Only Richard Tandy on keyboards survives the original band, looking as though he's turned up from his day job in the City to play with his mate.
The thing that strikes me the most is the power and perfect pitch of Lynne's voice. I did wonder how this would carry live, having been used to hearing it blended in with echo and special sound effects in the glossy productions of his heyday in the lates 70's. However, he really does have a great voice and it does make me think whether he has fully exploited this asset in the past. He has in fact got the potential to be a great blues singer.
It's hard to pinpoint why I find this concert so satisfying. It is all quite static. The music is delivered through an almost session music medium in a relatively intimate venue. Some of the special effects of the originals are sacrificed in this environment. I suppose as would describe it as the ""Jeff Lynne Band plays ELO"". I think this is why it works. It's all about the the music and the voice, not the production, and it is clearer than ever, that this man's melodies stand up in their own right. In fact they benefit from being more exposed in this way. There isn't a weak one here, old or new, and at around 90 minutes this is great value.
Jeff Lynne enhances the experience with a bit of humour and, still hidden behind permed hair, beard and shades, he doesn't look any different.
This is a 5 star experience, a wonderfully understated surprise.",1005955200,,2220,4.497524752475248
1647173,5,B00005QBZD,"I'm sick of people whining about ZOOM not being the ""real"" ELO.It seems like they were alot more concerned with the fact Jeff Lynne used the ELO title than they were about the actual music. So i'm sure they will be complaining that this isn't the ""real"" ELO performing as well. This concert is as good as it gets. The rockin DO YA leads the show off in great fashion. Nearly every song is a highlight here. STRANGE MAGIC,TELEPHONE LINE,LIVIN'THING,and TURN TO STONE are great as expected. MA MA MA BELLE rocks and 10538 OVERTURE is so good it has to be heard to be believed. MOMENT IN PARADISE,CANT GET IT OUT OF MY HEAD,JUST FOR LOVE,and especially ONE SUMMER DREAM are as beautiful as it gets. TIGHTROPE and SHINE A LITTLE LOVE both display dazzling energy. No ELO fan should be without this awesome concert...original lineup or not!",1005696000,3,835,4.610738255033557
1647174,5,B00005QBZD,"A once in a lifetime performance!  I had the lucky honor to attend this show.  I first starting listening to ELO after they had stopped touring.  Over the years they have become my FAVORITE group.  I looked for a high quality DVD of one of their previous performances, but the technology just wasn't there to capture the unique fidelity of their music.
Much like people talk of their dream of seeing the Beatles back together, or even Simon and Garfunkel, I dreamed of simply having a Dolby DTS recording of their best songs, even without a video. In the most vivid incantation of my dream, ELO would be performing in a setting much like the Eric Clapton: Unplugged DVD.
In what I would call an answer from God (and I don't consider myself a religous person), not only did they record this with an Emmy heavy production crew (Eagles Hell Freezes Over DVD, etc), but they recorded the music in Dolby DTS AND Hi Definition (this won't be available at the consumer level for some time, but it's great to know they have it). And on top of that, my wife and I were able to attend the show for both nights and sat front/center in the second row, a mere 15 or so feet from the stage and Jeff Lynne.
As far as ELO goes, the show delivered everything that I would have expected from ELO.  A clever light show, and high quality music.  Some of you may be wondering, with a number of the original crew missing, is the music different?  The answer is Yes and No. All songs sound as if they came straight off of the albums they were originally on, however, there's a streamlining of the orchestral section that does not disappoint. I am a real ELO officianado, and it sounded ""right on the money"" to me!
I'm curious what they did with the other five songs that are missing from the DVD, that were part of the show.  Maybe they are saving them for some kind of ""directors cut"" to release at a later time. I think that's my only disappointment.
What else can be said?  The only thing that could enrich my experience would be to have the interview with my wife and I immortalized on the DVD (they interviewed people before the show). I'm not counting on this, but hey, it seems someone has been smiling down on me, maybe its Mr. Blue Sky.",1004832000,4,2222,4.37378640776699
1647175,5,B00005QBZD,"Simply one of the most enjoyable concerts ever performed,
It includes performances of classic tunes from the 70s and 80s that the ELO became famous for. You realise what an innovative band they were and are .Jeff Lynnes performance tops everything he has done previously. His voice is so harmonic and has a character rarley matched by the most respected singers in the world but this is very special. It is the sort of performance you only probably see every 10 years or so. All that can be said is get it, and cherish it. In years to come this performance will go down as one of a few all time greats.
You will have to purchase it to realise the experience words can`t give it justice.

1647176,5,B00005QBZD,"I saw this on PBS.  Growing up in the seventies I was not a huge ELO fan, but the musicianship and production values of this live concert are second to none.  Although (I believe) Jeff Lynne is the only original member performing, he surrounds himself with top-notch musicians, resulting in a sound that is true to the original recordings.  This is destine to become the definitive ELO video.",1002931200,7,392,4.735294117647059

As with any concert you get a handful of songs from an album you don't know but outstanding versions of all the hits with a rousing finale of ""Roll Over Beethoven"".

All my favorite songs are there along with the ones from Zoom that I had never heard before and also enjoyed. Sometimes my husband wants some music and I go right to ELO, and he says ""please gimme a break, not ELO again"", so I will change the music. But if he leaves the room and does not know what I'm doing, I put ELO back on. I am so fortunate to have such a sweet understanding husband, that he will let me get away with this. He also enjoyed the Zoom dvd/concert very much too! And thanks to all the Amazon reviewers who gave it 5 stars, you talked me into buying it and I'm so glade you did.

I mean, this guy sounds as good as he did 30 years ago.  This is not always the case with other classic rock acts.  Jeff leads his new band with supreme confidence dawning his signature curly locks and sunglasses.  He is eternally cool.  The new band does well backing him, (most of them look like your fifth grade music teachers.)  The playlist is what one would expect,  mostly hits, (and there are plenty), with a few album tracks thrown in, (so glad he did One Summer Dream).

Even without the original band members from times gone by you would never realize that when you see and listen to the new line up.

1647248,4,B00005QBZD,I would like to see some ELO on Blu-Ray.  Their music is a perfect fit for DTS MA and Dolby True HD.  Short of that this DTS 5.1 set has to fill the surround bill for now.  Being spoiled by high definition both visually and audibly this performance leaves me hopeful that just maybe someone will dust off the ELO musical archives and give them the hi rez surround mixing treatment they so deserve.,1422316800,,397,4.337837837837838

I love the Moodies, Jeff Lynn is phenomenal in his War of the Worlds.  I am definitely spoiled by him. ELO's recordings are sensational but this DVD actually gave me a headache!  The drummer that is so great on the albums is what did it.  Maybe he was a bit excited performing for ""royalty"" but he never once gave the symbols time out!  The sound quality was really bad.  Maybe bc the performance (and technology) is so old.  I'll keep it, maybe give it away. I'll never listen to it again!

I should have been suspicious at the price that it wasn't exactly the US Version of the DVD.  I have made the mistake a couple of times of getting a DVD with the wrong region code, because I jumped too soon at a good deal.  That wasn't the case here, but it is something I should have investigated.  The concert is good though.  It is great to see Jeff Lynne and what is left of ELO performing some of their best tunes.  The audio is amazing here as it should be in this day and age.  Some older concerts and TV performances of ELO were recorded at a time when attention to the audio aspect of the production were not emphasized and they just don't hold up to repeated viewings.  This one does and I'm glad I got it.",1412121600,,859,4.095808383233533

It's great to hear the old songs and although some of the personnel has changed, it's great to hear the new songs, too. Sadly, nothing from Jeff Lynne's solo work or his Traveling Wilbury's period, but that is not too much of a worry. I wasn't expecting it - originally - and since it's not in the concert, it's not missed, TOO much, I would like to see him doing those solo songs live one day, though, if possible.

So I have a DVD that shows Jeff Lynne in several frozen positions.  On the few portions that do play, the sound and picture don't seem to be synced.  Maybe that's just because as a musician, I expect to see the snare hit at the time the snare sound occurs.  I'm 95% of the time pleased with Amazon.

There are times when the sound level varies, but that's probably a technical issue.

Best of all, it has my two favorite numbers by the band . . . ""10538 Overture"" and ""Roll Over Beethoven.""  I heard the former for the first time on a greatest hits album, and, of course, the latter on the radio.  Their rendition is the best I've ever heard, with apologies to writer Chuck Berry, and, the Beatles.  I only wish they had a violinist for the live DVD . . . it would have kicked some monster ass.",1390867200,,605,4.217391304347826

1647288,5,B00005QBZD,"As a long time ELO fan (since the 70s), I was very disappointed when this tour got cancelled back in 2001. But I am very happy they did this show to give me a taste of what we missed. I'd recommend this to any ELO fan. Live concerts sometimes aren't very good because they sound nothing like what we are used to. And this is especially true when that concert is 2 decades after the fact.

But I think Jeff Lynn & co nailed this one as well as they could. Jeff even surprised me with a few high notes that sounded exactly like they did 20 years ago (on ""Strange Magic"" for instance). There is only one other original ELO member in this.. but let's face it.. Jeff Lynn was ELO. Sarah O'Brien & Peggy Baldwin did an amazing job on cello. Drums were spot on. Base guitar all over it.... and of course Richard on keys still after all those years.

I treasure this dvd. My only complaint would be that I can't find it on Blu Ray",1388102400,,922,4.116666666666666

1647296,5,B00005QBZD,"I was hesitant to buy this even though I enjoyed the Zoom cd because I didn't want to be disappointed by the new bands attempts to play the old classics. Not only did they play them well, I think they actually played them better than the original band members. Jeff Lynne's music is timeless. It was a loss to the music loving community that this tour was cut short due to slow ticket sales. I think if they had played a couple dates, the reviews and buzz would have been fantastic and later shows would have sold out.  Great show, great production values.

1647297,4,B00005QBZD,"In the 70's ELO put on a show with lights and fanfare. They really looked like they landed from outer space. Years later here's Jeff Lynne looking like he just stepped out of the 70's. He looks great, sounds pretty good but there seems to be a lack of energy here that was present years ago. Understandable. I'm not jumping around either. They hit all the hits and the music is done well, just lackluster with little connection to the audience. And no lights, or smoke or laser beams to the sky. Just some good ELO tunes and that's ok.",1376179200,,535,4.36
1647298,5,B00005QBZD,"This concert is a work of pure genius that is produced to perfection. One can marvel at the immense magnitude of the composition, instrumentation, and vocalization.  Zooming into the living room, the DVD literally takes a music lover out of this world.  What a fabulous ride!",1375660800,,275,4.956521739130435
1647299,2,B00005QBZD,"Let me start by saying I think it's great to read the reviews - pro and con - that this concert dvd has generated. Clearly the music created by the Electric Light Orchestra still means a lot to people, even 25 years after their last studio album was released, and that passion shows in the reviews on Amazon.

That said, I have to say I was really disappointed with this concert. Yes, the musicianship and Jeff's singing is very good, but overall the performances are lacking something - and that something is ENERGY. Richard Tandy's presence is almost spectral, but in fairness even in the 1970s he was no Keith Emerson...The drummer is good at the cymbals but doesn't seem to know how to use the bass drum. Rosie Vela's backup vocals and ""dancing"" are bearable but her absence would not have been missed. And the two cellists  smirk at each other throughout the concert, perhaps sharing a private joke like ""well this isn't Mozart but at least it's a paying gig!"". I do want to compliment the guitarist, who was excellent; his solo at the end of ""Ordinary Dream"" was perfection, and maybe even better than the CD version. Too bad whenever the camera was on him I kept thinking ""that guy reminds me of somebody...Alan Price? Or maybe Neil Aspinall?? Well anyway he plays great guitar!""

 After this dvd was over I really needed a pick-me-up, so I put in the dvd of ""Electric Light Orchestra Live: the Early Years"" which has footage from 1970s concerts supporting the albums ""On the Third Day"", ""Eldorado"" and ""Face the Music."" Soon I was in ELO heaven: watching Bev Bevan make full use of his massive drum kit, Mik Kaminsky play the violin like a man possessed, and Hugh & Melvin sawing away at their electrified cellos - I could only say, ""NOW THAT'S MORE LIKE IT!!"" This is what a rock band looks & sounds like, not just a bunch of studio musicians who are earning a paycheck. And back in those days Jeff was willing to step aside from the microphone and let Kelly Groucutt do lead vocals - apparently at the time Jeff had enough self-confidence to be able to share the spotlight. Sadly, nowadays he can't  tolerate real artistic collaboration; Jeff's current state (dare I say ""Power"" Trip?) brings to mind the ""how the mighty have fallen"" saga of Sting: firing Stewart Copeland and Andy Summers so he could call all the shots, allegedly in the name of artistic freedom but the end result has been forgettable albums of easy-listening drivel. Sorry Jeff, it DOES matter who plays the other instruments, it's not only about the song-writing.

So IMHO if you love (or even just like) ELO then skip this wake for a once-great rock band, and get the aforementioned&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Electric-Light-Orchestra-Live-The-Early-Years/dp/B003UPPO26/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Electric Light Orchestra -Live: The Early Years</a>&nbsp;dvd and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Electric-Light-Orchestra-Out-of-the-Blue-Live-at-Wembley/dp/B000FP2ZQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Electric Light Orchestra: Out of the Blue - Live at Wembley</a>&nbsp;dvd as well; yes the Wembley concert is a tad over the top but all the original members put on a great show, and it even has the ""Disco-Very"" videos as an extra.",1373760000,2,3295,5.231060606060606

The string section does well with only two players,and the rest of the band are fine too,although i
can see why at a few reviews feel some of the group are distant,but richard tandy on keyboards/piano
is from the ELO days and clearly enjoys playing.

Jeff Lynne is always good,and the Zoom album contains some great song's that easily sound from those
ELO days,and as this is from a tv broadcast i did wonder if some song's were not included on this
dvd.

There is not too much video available for ELO and this is worth buying as you will find you will
play it again and again.
I would have liked to have seen Bev Bevan on the drums,but i guess that would have been asking too
much.

The picture quality is good as are the sound options,extras are only short with interviews but
still ok to include,and with the Zoom album re issued with extra tracks,there is a lot of
other re issues from jeff lynne also as well as ELO LIVE which again released with extra tracks
from this concert and two studio out takes.

1647312,5,B00005QBZD,I am not one for writing reviews but this DVD has made me do one now. Outstanding performance. I have to say that you can tell the group practiced hard to produce a flawless performance. I think they have not gotten enough credit for all the hard work they must have put in to this performance. What a shame they did not capitalize on it through a tour that was cancelled. But this is without a doubt my favorite live performance of music from my past. Count me in with those who think that this in some ways is even better than the original performances although a few more strings would have been nice. I wish I had seen this in person but the recording is great because I can watch it over and over which I have and will. The real evidence of a hit in my book is the desire to hear it agaian and again. Its tireless. Buy it.,1360195200,,827,4.111111111111111
1647313,3,B00005QBZD,"I've always enjoyed ELO's music as much as the next guy. I had seen the original band make various appearances on TV over the years, but never saw one of their full shows before. I wasn't really quite sure what to expect. Not too surprisingly ELO (this version anyway) played well enough, but wasn't very exciting to watch. This DVD is basically nearly two hours of watching eight well dressed people standing stiffly in place on a suprisingly small stage before a tiny PBS-like audience without even a basic light show to create any kind of mood to match the nice selection of music. The sound and video were nice and clear, especially for being nearly a dozen years old, it's just that the show was literally boring to watch. If the viewer is partial to opera or ballet, this shouldn't be too much of an issue, but even they may be tested. For anyone expecting any kind of visual entertainment, they will be ""brought down"" by the band's lack of personality. Maybe I was expecting too much. While there is nothing much to see here, there is plenty to listen to. If you keep that mindset, you should be fine...",1356739200,,1110,4.527363184079602

1647317,3,B00005QBZD,"This DVD contains some great live performances of classic ELO tunes. BUT the audio quality is lacking. Specifically, the audio levels are all over the place - like the automatic level control on a cheap cassette deck. Don't get me wrong, the frequency response and noise levels are great for a live recording, but the ""breathing"" and ""pumping"" effects from the varying audio levels is disturbing.

1647319,3,B00005QBZD,"DVD was basically Jeff Lynne and some session musicians. Note, this is NOT a slam. Jeff Lynne IS ELO so I was ok with this.

Also, my experience with backup singers has typically been: ""Their mic is off. They just don't know it."" NOT in this case. I thought the female backup singer was excellent. She added A LOT. Also, the other musicials were solid (eg cellists). This was plus a half star for me.

If you like ELO, you will like the DVD. Most of the hits are here. (I took a half star off for Sweet Talking Woman being absent. GOTTA be here. Especially since there were a few songs I thought were basically filler. All the other hits you expect to be here.. ARE here.)

My real problem with the DVD was the energy- or lack thereof.  It was basically Jeff Lynne playing a studio set and happening to have people watching and filming. This was also my experience when I saw ELO live way back when. Part of it is the music genre, I believe; it's pretty mellow. But I think also part of is that ELO are musicians not showmen. Jeff thanked the crowd between songs but there was no interaction. Introduce the next song and off we go. I have always believed that there are ""live bands"" and ""studio bands"". I put ELO solidly in the latter category.

Sound, video, production were solid (though again nothing spectacular.. shot of Jeff. Cut to back up singer. Cut to cellists. Cut to drummer. Back to Jeff etc. The whole band was pretty stationary.)",1341878400,,1444,4.393258426966292

The only thing I didn't like was that they didn't go right into the third verse like they did on the original recording, on do ya. That was always a dramatic surprise.
But I'm a musician, I notice stuff like that.

Not only was I NOT disappointed, I was actually astonished by the similarity in sound to the ""original"" ELO sound. Look, I am a recording artist as well. I write all my songs etc.. Having said that, if I decide to to change any band mates of any band that I put together utilizing my songs, that is my business. Now, if there is a distinct change of sound for better or worse when I am playing live, or if I decide to re-record because of personnel changes I make, then that's either my good fortune OR my fault. In the case of Jeff Lynne, its the same thing. It is Jeff that is taking the chance. The guy loves to write songs and perform. It's his life. Why should he retire or call it quits just because former band mates are no longer around or are no longer interested in performing? Why did the ""Zoom"" Tour fail? Who knows! But one thing is for sure, as a fellow musician and recording artist, I can tell you that the video I saw, and the music I heard from that DVD is as good as anything I have ever heard.

While only Jeff Lynne and Richard Tandy (keyboard) remain from the original band, it is clear that Lynne is the real backbone of ELO's sound, a true rock composer. ELO's familiar hits are brought to life with their familiar melody and harmony fully intact. The two female cellists, and Rosie Vela on backing vocals, add an element of charm. This live performance puts many of today's ""performers"" (who don't have the genuine talent to carry a tune or reproduce their own hits on stage) to shame.  So what if it was filmed in a TV studio and the DVD intro and menu screen is cheezy?  ELO fans will love it, and even my kids were mesmerized by the live performance of ELO hits that they had previously heard only scant times on CD.  So sad that this ELO tour was canceled due to weak ticket sales. From this DVD, that certainly appears undeserved. Also makes a great background video for a party or get-together.",1325116800,2,1028,4.637362637362638

This definitely ranks among the best. Superb musicanship, stage show, soooo close to studio sound it's amazing. Don't even hesitate on this for $7.49....best $$ ever spent.

1647330,5,B00005QBZD,"So, I am a big ELO fan but I realize many of the videos have Jeff Lynne, Kelley Groucutt, Richard Tandy, and Bev Bevan in polyester and big hair.  They usually look dated and, although I love the music, sometimes there is a lack of finesse and polish in the live performances as the Band ""saws"" their cellos and violins in an attempt to be ""rock and rollers"" (which they are).  Enter this ""Zoom"" DVD.  I was initially disappointed that only two of the band members are playing but, with one of them being Jeff Lynne (Tandy is the other), all the vocals were intact.  Kelley Groucutt used to provide the additional vocals and a lot of the vocal falsettos and is replaced in the video by supermodel, musician, and vocal talent Rosie Vela who not only pulls off all the required vocals but is so very beautiful in her Jeff Lynne-matching curls.  Speaking of beautiful women, what would happen if the band hired professional cello players who substituted technical perfection for the onstage zaniness of the band (see the video (not on this DVD) for ""Wild West Hero"" where these Brits are lassoing each other!)?  And what if the cello players were the beautiful and talented Peggy Balwin and Sarah O'Brien?  You will see it all on Zoom.  I know many purists will miss the original band, the bell-bottom pants, and the ""unusualness"" that got ELO where they are, but as I get older, it is wonderful to hear the songs performed as they were written and, of course, sang by the genius Jeff Lynne.",1303344000,4,1488,4.567669172932331

1647348,5,B00005QBZD,"Jeff Lynne took on a heavy Beatles influence and spun many threads of pure magic during the 1970s.  This DVD represents a great concert that he didn't have to do, being all rich as hell.  But he did, and it's  total win.  The production values are 10/10, technically and musically.  The details of the songs were laser sharp (such as the vocal harmonies on ""Telephone Line"").  They went all out.  The guy = a genius.  To those who say this performance is not ""exciting"" enough, it is to me.  They are trying to do a top performance of a superbly practiced group.  They are pros, not a bunch of braying, prancing clowns running around high-fiving and playing keytars.  There is no footage of Nikki Sixx receiving, or giving, fellatio.  Richard Tandy, an original co-writer of these songs, does a fantastic job on keyboards, quit dissing his hairdo and get a life people.  This show has a level of professionalism that confirms Jeff Lynne's high standards.  It's $11 or whatever, just get it.  I was expecting less and it won me over with its class and polish.

1647354,2,B00005QBZD,"ATTENTION, JEFF LYNNE:
GET OVER YOURSELF & PUT YOUR OLD BAND BACK TOGETHER!
NO WONDER THE TOUR FAILED!!

First, we all absolutely adore the ELO of the 70's & 80's. I was blown away with the ""Out of the Blue"" concert & album...one of the best shows I've ever experienced and I will always cherish my memories of ""The Big Night""...It really was huge!

I have shaken hands with some of those original musicians...NONE of whom are on this measley concert disc. There's Lynne & his old keyboard player: Richard Tandy is fine, no problem. He's actually the brightest ""Light"" in a room full of dim bulbs...""Electric Light"", indeed!

Lynne looks tired & sounds bored, out-of-touch. He's just mouthing his very own lyrics without a hint of inspiration or interest. Did he ""Turn to Stone""?

The strings sound fine, but there's none of that old spark--NONE of that ""Strange Magic"" that made ELO edgy & other-worldly. This sounds like a session band recruited from Radio Disney. Maybe it's too polished? I remember how ""New World Record"" sounded a little wild and very unpredictable--in 1976!

I guess that's it: Lynne is just too late to expect The Big Comeback Tour that other bands have relished. Hey, even ELO-2 had some decent moments with 3 of the old ""Orchestra"" intact: Bev Bevan, Kelly Grocutt, & Mik Kaminski turned out to be key players in that hodge-podge of otherwise stodgy Brits.

The DVD is a little bit better than no concert at all, but not by much. It's totally uninspired, flat. Go ahead and chisel it in stone: ""ELO...RIP""

RECOMMENDATION: any other live/concert disc of ELO, especially the 2 DVD's of ""Out of the Blue"". Any live CD's from the 70's sound terrific, too!

1647367,5,B00005QBZD,"This is my absolute favorite Jeff Lynne item, period.  He has NEVER sounded better and this brilliant live DVD corects the two major problems with ELO's records from the 1970's, the over the top (and often dated) production and the tendency to bury Jeff's vocals in the mix.  Here, he finally gets everything right. With the help of his brilliant musical side kick and arranger, Marc Mann (Concert for George and George Harrison's Brainwashed CD), they reduce the often complicated ELO sound down to its essential musical elements and then put Jeff's vocals right up front where they belong.  No gimmicks, no B.S. This is truly an example of ""less is more"" and it works so well that I actually prefer these versions of the ELO songs over the original recordings. Everything seems more melodic, more sincere, and more about the song and not some production trick.  Its obvious that Lynne has learned a lot from his work in the 1980's - 1990's with George Harrison, Roy Orbison, and the other greats and you can clearly hear it in the taste he now brings to his singing and guitar playing. I wish every musician and song writer could age like this.  If you are a fan of any kind of melodic pop rock, this is essential.

1647369,4,B00005QBZD,"While this is a solid performance by Jeff Lynne, Richard Tandy, and others, it lacks the energy of a truly live ELO concert ""back in the day.""  The string section ladies are clad in slinky black dresses instead of bouncing around the stage like the original band used to do.  This may partly be due to the size of the venue - this isn't an arena performance, it's more intimate, like a TV studio audience.

That being said, the music itself is spot on.  They obviously rehearsed well for this performance.  It's obviously live, not looped, but the performances are almost note for note.  Hits are included from both the Zoom album and previous ELO standards.  Includes a new saucer, too!",1246406400,,687,4.628099173553719

I have watched this DVD at least 10 times and I enjoyed it each and everytime. The performers did a great job of expressing the music in their own way.

I am very grateful that this DVD was filmed and that the sound quality is top notch. So many of the great older bands will never had a chance to a DVD of this quality. This performance is outstanding.

I really hope Jeff will someday receive the attention he deserves. A true master, like he is, is doesn't come along very often. On top of his masterful songs, he appears to be a very sincere guy, and someone who you'd really enjoy being around.

I really enjoyed this DVD and feel privileged to have watched a true musical genius in action. I grew up on ELO and always love rock music with cellos, violins, organs, etc. Tom Petty, Kansas, Supertramp, Boston, etc.

May God bless Jeff and thanks for making me feel good!",1217548800,3,860,4.464968152866242
1647375,5,B00005QBZD,"My expectations for this DVD prior to seeing it but after ordering it from Amazon were mixed. E.L.O. is easily in the top 3 of my favorite musical acts just based on their studio albums alone, but how would they sound live? Not only that but how would they sound after it being so long (over 15 years) since they had disbanded?

The performance on this DVD blew away even my highest expectations. The only downside to it was that, as with any good thing, I wish it had lasted longer. As it is, it is a solid hour and a half of pure E.L.O in top form. The newer songs from the Zoom album fit in nicely with their older stuff. Nothing is out of place.

I have never seen another performance of E.L.O. live so I can't say how it stacks up against some of their other performances as far as song list and number and identity of individual performers go, but as I said, they do everything here nicely with what seems to be a minimum of artists(just under 10, I believe) considering the complexity of the music.

If you're a fan of great music and being entertained then you can't go wrong with this DVD. I only pray that they go on tour again so I can see them live in person. Hey, I can dream.",1216252800,3,1189,4.160869565217391

The vocals were very strong from Rosie and the others as well. The filming was very good I thought too. Not cutting edge, but pretty good overall.
  I had never seen ELO in the day so I have nothing to compare them to, but have always loved their music through the years. The flip side of my opinion is that the band was in need of a...drink! Most of the band appeared so stiff they nearly looked in pain? And Jeff's sunglasses had to go!
  It is sad because that will probably be their last chance on film to show their stuff! A band that took me through high school and beyond. A band that really was different than the other main stream bands of the day. I loved it overall, and will watch it over and over, you'll have to forgive though if I just close my eyes and...Listen.  -Gavin-",1197244800,,931,4.15

I guess everyone deserves to decline with grace and dignity and Jeff has.  Collectors of ELO must have this.  New listeners of ELO need to listen to older ELO music.,1187395200,,504,4.380434782608695
1647393,5,B00005QBZD,"After working with the Wilburys, The Beatles and their various members. Jeff Lynne decided to reform ELO and brought along Richard Tandy the only former member to not go along with the lame Electric Light Orchestra Part Two project. Many people also don't seem to remember that Balance Of Power found only Jeff, Richard and Bev still in the band. This concert recorded on the first show of the band's Zoom tour is nothing short of excellent. Jeff and Richard are joined by a great backing group of performers and yes backing vocalist Rosie Vela is very pretty. The show mixes the band's most popular era(IE nothing after Discovery but something from Time would've been nice) along with several great Zoom songs. Alright, Easy Money and State Of Mind have become favorites although I like all the songs on the DVD. In fact, it was after watching this that I bought Zoom. The new songs fit well with old classics like Do Ya, Can't Get It Out Of My Head and Mr. Blue Sky. This is a classic DVD and belongs in anyone's collection who loves great music.",1185753600,8,1048,4.579787234042553
1647394,5,B00005QBZD,"This concert video is excellent for anyone who, like myself, likes Electric Light Orchestra.  I will start this review with a review, and then I'll add some comments/impressions.

I knew several of ELO's songs, but I was not an expert on the band.  I did not know, for example, that there was a female vocalist in the band (remember, this was the day of the Bee Gees, and I thought it could have been all men).  I did remember someone (maybe Casey Kasem) say that they had a violinist and a pair of celloists in the band.  In this incarnation, there was no violinist.  I think I could tell its absense on one song, and on ""Roll Over Beethoven"", the keyboards took over for the violins.

I enjoy the fact that the songs were a mixture of the old and new.  As I said, I was not an expert of the band, so 13 of the 23 songs were new to me, meaning I did not recognize 7 of the older songs (since 6 were from the album ""Zoom"").  It was not exhaustive of the old hits -- the most notable omission was ""Sweet Talking Woman"" -- but it featured all my favorites, which were ""Strange Magic"", ""Living Thing"", ""Turn To Stone"", ""Mr. Blue Sky"", and ""Can't Get It Out Of My Head"" (which was a song that, after I heard it, I couldn't ""Get It Out Of My Head"").

I really enjoyed the concert, but I wanted to make a comment on Jeff Lynne's glasses.  I knew it was something involving just him, since he was the only one who wore glasses.  I can think of four reasons why:
1.  He's always wore glasses like that -- it's part of his image.
2.  He always wears them for a similar reason that KISS wears makeup -- no one can recognize him in person.
3.  Jeff Lynne is blind, though that did not seem likely watching him perform.
4.  Those were druggie glasses; with Jeff's mannerisms in concert when he spoke between songs, I would not have been shocked to learn he was high.

This project confirms why I always liked ELO.  Besides my favorites, other songs I enjoyed included ""Just For Love"", ""Tightrope"", ""10538 Overture"", and ""Shine A Little Love"".  (I also like ""Don't Bring Me Down, but I have heard that more recently on the radio; I never heard it before when I was younger.",1184112000,,2160,4.262899262899263

Jeff's voice sounds great , and he shows he's a very good guitar player as well. I've always loved his old music ( i've been out of touch with elo's new stuff over the years), and now this dvd reintroduced me to Jeff's talent again. I've watched it many times, and will many times more. If you are a fan of Jeff's music, you will not be disapointed. Get it.",1183766400,2,455,4.3023255813953485

They shelved the tour, I believe.  If you liked ELO in the seventies, you will love this DVD.  New space ship, better looking cello players, and a superb performance and set list.  Great on the hits and they also throw in some older not so big hits, which is what I always look for.  All of the Zoom songs, which I hadn't heard but one, are all great songs as well.  Jeff Lynne is fantastic and has not changed much at all.  Looks the same and sounds the same. Buy this one and you will not regret it.",1179187200,3,651,4.193548387096774

  super hero of music.  After the release of the Zoom album, I heard

  that Jeff would go on tour.  I was on cloud nine (sorry George

1647409,5,B00005QBZD,"It's really tempting to be critical of this DVD concert because watching it reminds me that the original ELO could still perform together, if they simply wanted to (at the time of this recording, I believe ""ELO II"" was alive and well and tourning and performing ELO hits), and I am also reminded that this was supposed to be the beginning of a tour that never happened.  I would have paid to see this if only I'd been given a chance!  (I actually saw ELO II at a club a few years ago and they were great.)

Anyway, the DVD is great fun.  Play it through a big screen TV with a good sound system and just rock out!  Great entertainment for much less than concert tickets, or even the cost of gas to drive to the concert.  It doesn't pay to think about coulda-woulda-shoulda.

1647410,3,B00005QBZD,"Where do I start? I've been an avid fan of Electric Light Orchestra since their 2nd album back in 1973(ELO II), and this is NOT the Electric Light Orchestra. It's Jeff Lynne and original Electric Light Orchestra member Richard Tandy, with a group of unknowns, in an impromptu performance of some of the best songs by the Electric Light Orchestra.

I don't mean to trash or demean the talents of everyone else on the stage in this performance, partly female (and the only reason I mention ""female"" is because the original band had no female members, aside from the occasional backing studio musicians) with awesome, incredible unimaginable talent......but again, it's NOT the Electric Light Orchestra. The absence of Kelly Groucett, Mik Kaminski, Mike Edwards, Hugh McDowell, Melvin Gale and Bev Bevan are incredibly felt as you watch this performance.

The best thing to do is to play this without the video and imagine the original Electric Light Orchestra playing this set of old tunes. The ""Zoom"" songs come off great, as do the old hits, as long as you keep your eyes closed during the playback.

As you can plainly notice I do not refer to the original band as ""ELO"".....I really think that was a cop-out made by Jeff Lynne (under pressure from his record company at the time) in the early 80's to try to keep the band in the mainstream at the time. But even most of the original members I mentioned above hung around for most of the ""ELO"" years.

Jeff Lynne affectionately refers to his entourage as ""ELO"", which to me came across as meaning that anyone that Jeff Lynne decides is a part of his band is ""ELO"". As a follower of the Electric Light Orchestra this is almost an outrage. This incarnation should be called ""Jeff Lynne & Friends""! NOT ELO or The Electric Light Orchestra!

Don't get me wrong though. This is an incredible performance by the people Jeff Lynne put together for this performance. The ladies on strings and backing vocals (Peggy Baldwin and Sarah O'Brien on strings, and Rosie Vela on backing vocals) are not only extremely talented but serve as ""eye candy"" during the presentation, which is an incredible disservice to these talented and gifted artists! That may have been Lynne's strategy with the ""Zoom"" tour. He might have figured that if fans of Electric Light Orchestra wouldn't settle for the dramatic changes in the personnel of the original ensemble, they could at least be appeased by the female ""scenery""! These ladies deserve much much more credit than that. (In this light, I can't say anything bad about Lynne's recognition of TRUE talent!)

Again, an excellent performance by everyone on stage......but it's NOT The Electric Light Orchestra OR ELO!

It's as if Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr got on stage and called themselves The Beatles! I THINK NOT!!!!

I will say though....when ""One Summer Dream"" played I was transported back to 1975. This is probably one of the few times the performance of this song has been recorded live.....and it blew me away! But ""Don't Bring Me Down"" sounds as if a local bar band was performing the song!

I highly respect the talents of Jeff Lynne, but I also respect the talents of the original Electric Light Orchestra members. I deeply appreciate the efforts of Lynne to resurrect the ""strange magic"" of the olden days, but without the key members of the original band, this comes off as a ""whatever will work"" effort.

For occasional fans of the orginal band this is an excellent trip back to the past, but for die-hard fans of the original Electric Light Orchestra......watch the Wembley concert instead. Even with Wembley's lack of quality due to the age of the recording, it's still a better alternative to Lynne's re-working of the band in this quality performance.",1171065600,11,3750,4.818040435458787

I enjoy this dvd immensly the performance really captures your interest and keeps it. Watching this dvd you hear and see how this set of ELO songs is disected and presented to the audience. I really got into the music with my theatre system and I felt like I was there.

1647412,3,B00005QBZD,"I'm a lifelong, diehard ELO fan.  What this concert DVD shows is the incredible ego of Lynne in ignoring his old bandmates.  While Jeff has all the legality in the world to call himself ""ELO,"" it pains me to see him describe past concerts where he won't even use the names of former members of his band.  Jeff's solo CD effort didn't sell well and he's running out of catalog to sell for commercials.  The big tour this DVD portended to be announcing fizzled and failed before getting off the ground via poor ticket sales.

Yes Jeff, we all know you're a freakin musical genius.  Yes we know ""ELO"" is yours; lock stock and barrel.  Just smarten up and bury the hatchet with Kelly, Bev and the boys and try and resurrect the oh so glorious past.  Your old mates in ""Orchestra"" put on a damn fine live show and exhibit excellent musicianship.  If you got off your high horse and joined them it would be simply stellar.  We don't want to see that slapdash mishmash group of hired players on this DVD (and get rid of the girl Jeff, she's embarrassing).  We want to see the great ELO lineup of it's incredible peak, we want to see some Rock Gods have some fun with performing some live music!

For this aborted tour, Jeff chose old songs along with seven songs from Zoom. The band is much tighter than the original seventies lineup (at least as exhibited on Out Of The Blue: Live At Wembley 1978 DVD). To compensate for his own lack of stage presence, Jeff hired talented eye candy in the form of singer Rosie Vela and cellists Peggy Baldwin and Sara O'Brien.

Unbelievable, lighting, special effects, along with a tight, sober band playing at the top of their game, made for an experience you never forgot.

NOBODY, and I mean NOBODY could hold a candle to Electric Light Orchestra. The stage show wasn't a prop, but an intergral part of the experience. Nowdays, if you get a band with a strobe and black curtains everyone goes nuts. Record labels say the cost is just too high to put on a show like that anymore. That's why you need this DVD.

The sound is awesome, the camera work is tight, and so is the band. The 24 song set includes all your favorites, and some new material as well. I'm jumping up and down in my living room, and the neighbors think I'm nuts.

Jeff Lynne has only one peer in pop music, and his name is Paul McCartney. This is a great showcase for a great time, and if you even remotely ever liked one ELO song, you'll kick yourself for not owning this.

For those ELO fans, you will NOT be dissapointed!",1136332800,6,698,4.956896551724138

The co-singer (Rosie is it?) is gorgeous and a great singer and the string section looks great. I liked some of the new songs and generally this DVD contains a good smattering of their back catalogue. 3 glaring ommisions I guess are 'So Fine', 'Rockaria' and ' Last train to London.'I can highly recommend this.

1647444,5,B00005QBZD,"I loved ""Hell Freezes Over"", but this beats it!  Yes, there are things I'd have preferred:  more original members, violin(s), french horn(s), ""rockaria"" and ""fire on high"", and more emotion/less ""sedated dark-glasses look"", but I need to just shut up about all that now.  This is a $#&@'ing spectacular- looking and sounding disc.

Jeff Lynne is a supreme talent.  His girlfriend's voice blends perfectly with his, giving an awesome beauty to their harmony.  The celloists are incredible, and the rest of the crew is just fantastic.

Essentially every other live-performance DVD was shot by someone who should also be shot.  Terrible angles, dizzying cuts, focusing on the ""wrong"" performer, etc.  Just maddening.  This was shot by someone who knew what he/she/they were doing.  I could just relax and enjoy the video with its incredible 5.1 sound.

I've read most of the other reviews and I'm repeating some of the raves I know, but I just wanted to say this is by far the best music DVD experience I've ever had.  Buy this DVD now.  If you don't like it, something is wrong with you.  :-)",1129507200,6,1090,4.816216216216216

1647455,3,B00005QBZD,"It would be nice if he did. He stands there like a muppet without much enthusiasm.

They have done pretty well all things considered. I never thought Jeff Lynne would do an another ""ELO"" album after ""Balance of Power."" All round, it's a good dvd musically, but they don't sound as good as they used to obviously. If you want a concert to crank up in your lounge room and dance around to, this isn't the one. However, it's still a good selection of the ELO hits and they do a reasonable job covering them.

Pros

- Good sound, although they need to turn up the cello's, you can barely hear them.

- Picture quality is good

- Jeff and friends do a reasonable job covering the songs. I was suprised how good Jeff's voice sounds after all these years.

Cons

- Jeff and the rest of the band aren't very animated. It's like watching them rehearse.

- Not a very good atmosphere. If they were playing in front of 10,000 it would be more interesting. It's just filmed in front of a studio audience.",1129075200,7,992,4.324324324324325

Jeff is such a master at his craft. The images he paints with his lyrics, and the answering harmonies are just incredible. in ""Zoom Tour Live"", the band is scaled down a bit, as compared to the first ELO I saw. But you won't be missing anything here. The music is all there. And most of all, those incredible vocals. In songs like ""Telephone line"", and ""Turn to stone. There are plenty of your ELO favorites, as well as new offerings. It's great to see someone like Jeff performing and genuinely loving what he's doing. I am now a huge fan of Rosie Vela, she is singing harmony vocals,(her vocals combined with her beauty promote the term ""angelic""). There is also a great interview w/ Jeff. If I had to sum up his work, and this dvd, It could be best described as, timeless emotion.",1127088000,,947,4.237569060773481
1647457,5,B00005QBZD,"The previous ELO Live at Wembley offering suffered from poor sound capturing techniques and some rather obvious miming to hard-to-reproduce live numbers. Wild West Hero, was one of only a few of my personal favourites that been attempted quite convincingly on that production, despite the risk of live vocal harmonies. Unfortunately that number is missing from this collection of Lynne classics. Fear not, despite this omission there is plenty here for fans of the Out Of The Blue era. Freshly scored by Marc Mann, the cello arrangements (and keyboard fill ins of other orchestral textures) are thrillingly faithful to the old recordings, and where new twists are added they are satisfyingly appropriate. Modern sound techniques have captured the beauty of Lynne's unique melodic and harmonic creativity better than any previous live attempts. His new band features only Richard Tandy from the original line up, but remember ELO was Lynne's baby, he wrote and produced all of those classic pop textures. This is a fine document of many of his classics, plus a healthy bonus of new material that although not quite as memorable yet, possibly due to under exposure, doesn't sound out of place next to hits such as Mr Blue Sky, Telephone Line, Can't Get It Out Of My Head, Strange Magic, etc. There's an abundance of excellent tunes here, if you're a fan of melodic rock you won't find many better selections than this. The absence of Bev Bevan may put off those fans of the original huge drum sound, but worry not there is superbly understated but efficient playing of Gregg Bissonnette (drums, vocals) recreating the percussive drama,  and brother Matt (bass and vocals); Cellos you can actually hear, Jeff Lynne and Richard Tandy doing what they do best and refreshing and complimentary vocals from Rosie Vela. This was a concise line up designed for a tour that was sadly cut short, but delivers what I bought it for; an audio- visual document of one of the favourite bands of my youth. (The inclusion of Jeff Lynne interview and footage of excited fans at the event makes interesting viewing too)",1124323200,4,2098,4.943342776203966
1647458,5,B00005QBZD,"I was lucky enough to be at the taping of this DVD (well, the DVD is actually taken from two night's worth of shows, I was only at one of the two shows which were identical).

The concert features ELO's leader Jeff Lynne with a newly revamped ELO lineup. The planned 2001 tour was cancelled unfortunately, but this DVD was released despite the cancellation. It's sad that fans had to deal with a consolation prize, but this DVD is about the best consolation possible.

I am firmly of the belief that Jeff Lynne IS ELO. Apart from the first ELO album which was a collaboration between Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne, the rest of ELO's catalog is almost completely written, produced, and sung by Lynne. Anybody who tries to complain that this 2001 version of ELO is somehow not authentic enough is ignoring the fact that Lynne endured numerous personell changes over the years, precisely because ELO was basically his own project which could have just as easily been released under the name ""Jeff Lynne.""

The rather mediocre faux-ELO lineup that toured and recorded a few albums in the 90's as ""ELO Part II"" without Lynne is a testament to how important Lynne's songwriting, production, and vocals were and are. Note the prominent placement of Lynne's name on the cover of this DVD to alert potential consumers that this DVD is not one of the cheap ""ELO Part II"" productions.

This show mixes tracks from the 2001 ""Zoom"" album (which doesn't feature this live band; the ""Zoom"" album is pretty much Lynne solo with some guest spots from others) with plenty of ELO hits and a few relatively obscure gems (i.e. ""One Summer Dream""). Lynne put together a band here that performs the all of the numbers impeccably. Lynne's voice is in top shape, which is an increasing rarity among so-called ""aging classic rock"" acts.

The DVD presentation is top-notch as well, with a great picture shot in high-definition, an excellent 5.1 mix (available in DTS and Dolby Digital) as well as a short interview with Lynne and a few interviews with fans waiting to get into the show.

This is about as perfect as a DVD can get. It's a great presentation of a great concert. It's too bad the band never got to go out on tour. Hopefully Lynne will once again resurrect ELO for another album and tour.",1124064000,9,2268,4.643391521197008

Heck, he got an orchestra to help him on this concert and they were awesome.  The lady singer that sung with Jeff was pretty and had a great voice but it was not the same.  Don't bring me down did not even get close to the original recording.  Some of the new songs were good though.  Mr.blue sky sounded almost just like the original recording and so did telephone line.  Livin thing was a big disappointment though.  Roll over beethoven was great and sounded great.  This sounds good in sourround sound and Jeff did impress me with some of his electric guitar playing.  His voice I think has gotten a little higher over the years and id not sound quite the same.  Oh well, what do you expect if there is not other ELO members on this concert.  I liked the special feature where they interview Jeff about the band and his decison to do a concert.  Buy it only if you like a fun concert.",1119052800,3,1026,4.231958762886598

1647468,5,B00005QBZD,"This is just outstanding, and kind of amazing, really. It's sung just about as close to the original recordings as it could be. In fact, I think many of his songs sounded better as Jeff's voice wasn't covered up by too many back up vocals as in some of the originals. Even the few new songs included sounded like they were recorded w/all of the other great songs in the 70's. His voice has lost nothing, simply sensational. DVD is missing ""Sweet Talkin' Woman"", but has most everything else. Several of my friends who've watched this performance have purchased it and rave about how awesome it is. I must have recommended this DVD to over 100 people in the past couple of years since purchasing...",1102118400,4,697,4.584
1647469,5,B00005QBZD,"OK, now that you've read all the reviews about how ""Zoom"" is somehow compromised because... a) Jeff Lynne did EVERYTHING on the studio album; b) The live band roster did not include any of the old ELO band members except Lynne and Richard Tandy; c) The album, tour, and DVD all flopped consider this:

a) After Roy Wood left after the first album, ELO *was* Jeff Lynne.

b) Essentially, the various ELO bands have never been more than a cover band for Jeff Lynne's material and production.

c) The album, tour, and DVD flopped due to lack of good marketing and promotion NOT a lack of quality.

On that last point, history may look back on Zoom as one of the best ELO projects. That's because this band is better musically and stylistically than any of the prior ELO rosters. Gone are string players of questionable musical ability dragging their instruments around the stage and shredding their bows to pieces in maniacal attempts to 'look interesting'. Gone are male tenors straining their vocal chords to sound like sopranos. Gone are boring simple string arrangements trying to masquerade as 'high art'. This live band is tight, entertaining and interesting without being pretentious, bombastic, or downright dull (like the original ELO tended to be).

On the 'flop' issue, while a superb composer, producer, and musician Jeff Lynne has never been a very good business man. The marketing and execution of several of the Move and ELO albums was handicapped by this fact - just consider some of the album covers (does anyone remember how the cover of 'Eldorado' was savaged by the critics? I do. And, I'm STILL trying to figure out that belly button cover photo from 'On The Third Day'!) Thankfully for us all, ELO is a case study of how good art occasionally triumphs over bad marketing.  Why this did not happen in the case of 'Zoom' is disappointing.

1647471,5,B00005QBZD,"After the poor musical experience of watching the 1978 ELO Discovery concert DVD, I watched with fear and trepidation the ELO 2001 Zoom tour DVD.  A most excellent surprise.

While billed as ELO, it was basically Jeff Lynne and some other guys -- no original members outside of Lynne.  But who cares?  Can you name one original member other than him?

It was a truly live performance unlike the much prerecorded 1978 performance.  I'm sure the vocals were post-mixed, but they were live with incredible harmonies.  He had a female background singer who did a great job recreating much of the cool harmonies of the original recordings.  The female voice was an interesting contrast to the falsetto male vocals from the records.

They even did a nice job recreating songs like Mr. Blue Sky and Turn to Stone, which were difficult arrangements on the records.  Also, Lynne's vocals were not overdubbed and bathed in effects like I was used to.  They were live and unadulterated.  He's actually quite good.  And his in-between song banter was mildly entertaining.

The 2001 tour bombed and was cancelled prematurely (is anything cancelled maturely?) due to poor ticket sales.  It's surprising that Lynne touring for the first time in 17 years would draw so little interest.

The `arena' they played on the DVD was not expansive.  It was kinda like they moved out the booths at the local Country Kitchen and set up a stage (free concert with the chicken-fried steak) but it did give it a more intimate effect.  Audience members spotted were Ed Bagley, Jr. (is there anywhere on earth this guy isn't?) and Eric Idle.

On this DVD we have two rather attracive women gently playing their Cello's, barely being heard over the guitars etc. Yeah, so Mr Tandy tries to back the Cello's up but it's still pretty feeble. This is very noticable on two of my favourite tracks, 10538 Oveture and Roll Over Beethoven. On the former ther are no french horns, and virtually no Cello's, which were there by the dozens on the original. And what of the Violin and Cello solo's on the latter? Not even attempted!

1647483,5,B00005QBZD,"When Jeff Lynne decided to re-launch his good old Electric Light Orchestra with original keyboardist Richard Tandy and a bunchload of new friends, the media completely unnoticed it. Anyway, Jeff released the brilliant album ""Zoom"", and, surprisingly, decided also to promote it live. The fan base probably never believed that such a thing would have ever happened again, especially since Lynne's reluctance towards live music (because of the difficulty in reproducing properly the intricate ELO studio sound on stage).
But Lynne decided to surprise the world by announcing his ""Zoom tour 2001"", which launched at the CBS studios, with the recording of this DVD. Lynne goes through the many styles showcased by the Electric Light Orchestra through the years, performing almost every hit from the 70's, both faithfully and currently. The sound quality is amazing (the DTS 5.1 surround mix will blow your mind), and the performance itself is flawless.
Lynne, with his new backup band (girlfriend/vocalist Rosie Vela, keyboardist Richard Tandy, bassist Matt Bisonnette, drummer Gregg Bisonnette, guitarist/keyboardist Marc Mann and cellists Sarah O'Brien and Peggy Baldwin), are able to go through all the most classic compositions by the band (written by Lynne himself), tastefully combined with some of the newest compositions from ""Zoom"", and definitely surpass (by far) every previous incarnation's concert videos that are currently available, either by the 70's ELO (the poor sound/image quality ""Out Of The Blue Tour Live At Wembley"" comes to mind), or by a certain tribute band of the 90's who performed in Sydney with a full orchestra under the ""Part II"" tag.
And, for those who were afraid of Lynne's vocal ability deteriorating throughout the years, rest assured that Jeff's voice is as skillful as ever (or perhaps much more).
If you are a fan of ELO, past or present, you can't go wrong with this DVD. It's the best filmed/best performed/best sound-quality wise Electric Light Orchestra live document ever delivered. It was about time that a live DVD could do the band justice.",1067472000,21,2085,5.2642642642642645

I was an ELO fan back when there actually was an ""Orchestra"" part to them, but lost interest when that sound was faded out. I can still remember the excitement of hearing 10538 Overture for the first time playing from a free promo ""45 rpm"" I had picked out of a give-away bin at my local discount store because I thought the bands name sounded cool. I had no idea what I was getting then, but I've loved that sound and that song ever since I heard it. The other complaints I have with this DVD are the cellos are not nearly loud enough in the mix which takes away some of the punch they should be adding. And, the violin is missing totally. Otherwise, this is a pretty flawless disc. It sounds like a studio recording, I haven't followed if there were overdubs on this or not. If not, then you are seeing amazing performances. You are also seeing, to me, amazing classy eye-candy throughout--since Rosie stands so close to Jeff. I am glad they included some of those great old songs like 10538 and Ma-Ma-Ma Belle and Beethoven into the show, because they're the highlights.
Some of the post ""orchestra sound"" songs I never really liked on record because they were too wimpy have a little more edge to them in this live setting too. That helps make this a very enjoyable disc all the way through. Should have been complete though, shame on them.",1066348800,,1679,4.454545454545454

I have owned and played it now for 7 months on my home theater system and cannot see the criticisms at all. I lived that period and enjoyed them the first time around. This was better on nearly every song.
I have a number of others, both DTS and other formats and wish more were available in the format. It is like stereo vs mono. What an experience...especially when cranked.
The negative reviews reminded me of the ones about my second favorite DVD...Hell Freezes Over. Again, I lived in that time and it is great. Music morphs and reappears on about a twenty year cycle. Each time it usually gains the tech advantages of the time. Some of my music is teens and twenties which is digitized and reformatted and cleaned of the scratchies. Much better than the originals in sound quality and enjoyment. Not stereo, but great music. Each era has some really good musicians and presentations to savor. We now get the second times from the nearly original groups.

His girlfriend is a fine singer but her swaying and motions are annoying.  Well I guess someone had to step in for Hugh McDougall.  But seriously, I only got this DVD to see Jeff Lynne sing and play guitar.  If you want the REAL ELO, just get the CDs.",1056412800,,522,4.212121212121212

Jeff Lynne Looks great, I always appreciate the way he keeps his 1970's image.  Nothing is worse than seeing a rock star who used to look one way, cut his  hair short and change their look (like Billy Joel , The Eagles, or Pink Floyd for example)

  Although I wish more of the original ELO members would have played on this,  The new members do a fantastic job and I can't tell a difference soundwise.  I just feel like pieces of the puzzle are missing. But that is the only complaint about this otherwise ""GREAT"" concert.
  This video also reminds me of the terrorist attacks of 9/11. Although it was recorded 3 months earlier that summer. I seen this concert for the first time on PBS television on the evening of September 10th 2001.  Then I watched it over and over all night long, leading up to the morning of September 11th!  Now songs like ""Showdown, Turn to Stone, Evl Woman,and Mr. Blue Sky especially remind me of 9/11!  It brings back an Ominous feeling of what was about to happen in history.  It's like the calm before the storm!  That makes this video/DVD even MORE emotionally powerful for me!
I absolutely love this video and I'm so glad I seen it on PBS, otherwise I would not have known what I was missing.  This is the best concert that I have seen/heard since ""Queen"" played Wembley stadium in 1986!  SERIOUSLY...even if you are not a big ELO fan, you still do not want to miss this concert!

I was. From the first cut to the last Jeff Lynne and his new formed ELO sound simply great. Yes, it is not the same group, but really, it doesn't matter. Lynne's voice is in excellent form, his guitar licks are all there, and the backing vocals, strings, and synth bring to life some of the best music of an era that still today proves to be some of the most innovative in rock music. To put it succinctly, if you are (or were) and ELO fan, you *will* enjoy this DVD.

The concert builds towards a rocking end and although I did not particularly like some of the new Zoom songs it did not distract me away from a great concert. The visual and audio are well reproduced and it is fun to watch Jeff with his curly afro-like hair and sunglasses enjoy himself up on stage.

This reviewer was very hesitant to watch it because the DVD was based on the ill-fated ""Zoom"" tour and did not feature the true ELO band (except for Jeff Lynne and the keyboardist).  I began to think ""wish I had read this review before buying"".  However, as his review continued, I was pleased to read that he enjoyed the DVD once he started watching it, in fact he loved it!  When I got home, I quickly put it on.  I eagerly awaited to hear the DTS sound, and see the Widescreen footage.  Guess what - this DVD is fantastic!  Jeff Lynne sounds fantastic and the female back-up singer is not a disappointment (even if she wasn't part of the original ELO).  On top of that, there are two very talented celloists at the side, and the rest of the band are fantastic too.  The DTS sound is incredible, it certainly gives the Eagles ""Hell Freezes Over"" DVD some competition.  It's a pity the ELO ""Zoom"" tour failed before it got off the ground, because it richly deserved a chance, based on this excellent DVD.  I cannot recommend this DVD enough to ELO fans.

I would defy anyone to distinguish this incarnate from the original ELO sound.  Jeff Lynne is a genius and his genius shows through in ZOOM.  To one who thinks Jeff has no stage presence, I say some performers are visual, i.e. Cher, Tina Turner, Rod Stewart.  Some need only to be heard to be appreciated, i.e. Roy Orbison, Jeff Lynne.  When did you ever see Jeff animated and bouncing around on the stage?  And to one who thinks the dts production to be poor, both the audio and video on my dvd are very near the quality of the Eagles, ""Hell Freezes Over""...which we can all agree is THE standard.

I was delighted to hear so many classics (~16)  (and new Zoom songs ~ 7 more) reproduced so well. I am a stickler for quality harmony and good reproduction of the original songs. Lynne is religious about getting the sound perfect and chooses excellent singing and playing over jumping around on the stage. I'm glad. I wish they had done even more off Out of the Blue, and maybe some off Time, and Secret Messages which were missing. Then it would have been 2 dvds (fine by me!). He has not lost his vocal abilities (including the highs). Could have used a stronger string section, but it was decent. (Remember, I'm really picky). The cellists were beautiful in skill and appearance. My wife asked if he were to restart the tour, would I take her? The answer was yes. If you are a fan, you know Lynne is the core of ELO. The dvd is a must have, as long as it is wired to a good home theatre. My 9 year old daughter loves it too. (You hear ELO in a lot of commercials, tv, and movies, even today. Note Boogie nights, Billy Madison, 70's Show, etc). Daughter knows all the lyrics. This dvd has clean, pretty, digital sound. A 98 minute pleasure cruise. If you really love ELO, you will like this a lot.

1647498,5,B00005QBZD,"We all know Jeff Lynne is a genius.
Well, I had never gotten to see ELO in concert, and figured this would be the next best thing. It was a small-ish L.A. venue; but the sound was fantastic! From the opening song, I could see that this was going to be great. Indeed it was. Not only did the ""new"" ELO (Lynne and his keyboardist being the only original members) do all of the old hits perfectly (and by that I mean true to the original cuts), but the new songs were very good as well! How this tour was cancelled due to lack of interest baffles me.
To the reviewer who had a problem with the number of standing ovations: Of course there were a lot of standing ovations--most of the audience were standing! (By the way, did you notice Eric Idle there, enjoying himself immensely?)
As for those who would say Lynne is no ""showman,"" I must question what you're looking for in your music. I know we all have different reasons for wanting to hear our favorite music; but here's where I stand: if, for example, I were going to the symphony to hear a rendition of a Beethoven piece, what do I most want? Yeah--to hear it as it was intended. Who the hell cares if Lynne doesn't jump around and turn his wonderful songs into something less than they were?! Not me anyway. He and the remarkable group of musicians he put together give us what we wanted: All the best ELO songs, played just as we remembered--maybe better.
This DVD has blown away everyone I have shown it to. It is true ELO, and it is a gem. Buy it.",1041897600,7,1504,4.2622377622377625
1647499,4,B00005QBZD,"I can't help but wonder if the fellow reviewer from Dallas actually watched the same DVD as I did.  For one, I think Jeff did a very good job interacting with his audience, talking between numbers and displaying a sense of humor that kept everyone involved (as if the music wasn't enough!).  I don't think any of the tracks were lifeless or devoid of emotion, rather they were attempts to capture the impeccable studio work that Lynne has churned out over his 30+ years in the business.  And to blame the failure of the Zoom tour in its entirety on the quality of this concert is simply asinine.  The failure of the concert tour can be placed squarely at the feet of the promoters who chose to stage shows at arenas and amphitheatres that were simply too large to be profitable given the current fan base that ELO can attract on the road.  In fact, this DVD was released AFTER the cancellation of the tour, and the only live performance that could be seen by the public prior to the failure of the tour was VH-1's Storytellers program, which was poorly promoted itself.

1) The reviews have to support a very high rating for sound quality, and 2) hopefully it is a group that I like.
For me, at my age, that usually means that the performers are getting a little long in the tooth. So they not only have to still be alive, but also be performing within the last few years to take advantage of the new technologies.
This DVD is fantastic on both accounts.

1647504,5,B00005QBZD,"This is an excellent DVD of Jeff Lynne ""covering"" alot of older ELO material along with some new material from his new album (or excuse me - ) THEIR NEW ALBUM ZOOM!
The material is very good. I agree with a previous reviewer that Lynne's stage presence is not that invigorating or entertaining.  But the music packs a punch and all the music is played very well.
The only thing that puzzles me about this whole Zoom idea/concept is that it really is Jeff Lynne solo. I can't help that feeling when I'm watching this.
First off, there are no ""real strings"" except for 2 celloists that are barely audible to my ears - they only enhance the bass if anything.  Also there is ""mock"" violin sounds from the keyboards (BTW, which is played by the only other former ELO member Richard Tandy).
Secondly, on the album Zoom, most of it is played by Jeff Lynne himself with guests George Harrsion, Ringo Starr, a celloist, and Richard Tandy -- I'm probably missing others...but I don't think that consitutes calling it Electric Light Orchestra.
I have the suspicion that maybe it's because it may be a bigger draw that having just the Jeff Lynne name on a product.  Or is it the influence of ELO contained within that makes it qualify as ELO.
I would have prefered it being just the Jeff Lynne Project or something to that degree because of the above explanations.
Either way you slice it though, it's still a great DVD - ELO or Jeff Lynne.  The sound is superb on surround sound.

If you don't even know who ELO are, this is a perfect introduction on a DVD.
Even in their heyday, there was no-one quite like ELO.  Not that they were so much better than everyone else - but because, like Queen, for example, they had a style and a sound that really was innovative and all their own.  An acquired taste, perhaps (certainly not for anyone who thinks that Rock and Roll should never feature a string section!), but a taste worth acquiring.
What is particularly notable about this performance is the relative faithfulness to the original recordings.  Some groups seem to feel that is a betrayal of their artistic integrity to ever give a live performance that matches their recorded material.  To my mind this is like the film company that buys up a bestselling novel and re-writes it to such an extent that only the names remain the same.
I'm not suggesting that pop music should never be innovative, but if things are going to change it should at least be for the better - which is all too often not the case.
In the Zoom concert we get 23 numbers, of which 17 are old favourites, and six are from the Orchestra's new album.  At first hearing the older tracks all sound pretty much as they did way back when, but listen a little more carefully and there are SUBTLE variations, especially from keyboardist Richard Tandy, that ensure that they have renewed vigour and Kerpow!

The new material from Zoom is brilliant, Jeff is an excellent musician in his own right, rather than prostitute the name of the former ELO it is quite bewildering why Jeff Lynne did not go for it under his own name with Zoom, he certainly has the credibility.

This is ridiculous. A fifth grader could have successfully pulled off the marketing coup of actually playing snippets of the classics in the ad!?! How about internet ads that focused on the greatness of ELO and the rarity of seeing them live!?! Why not have them play smaller venues?

I saw the original Orchestra several times, including the original Space Ship at a stadium concert in Cleveland in 1978.  While the other members of the band may not have contributed much to the writing chores, they were the life to the band.
Mik Kaminsky was non-stop motion on a stage and the sight of Hugh McDowell strumming his cello like a guitar was unforgetable.  You won't see any of that here.  Jeff never strays away from the microphone while his back-up singer/girlfriend sways at his side. While the music is good, it just doesn't seem to have the punch of the old days.

It truly is a shame that they couldn't draw crowds and had to abandon their tour.  It's not Jeff's fault.  No one knew he was back.  I didn't, nor my son, nor several other ELO fans that I've talked to.  If they advertised this concert, the promoters did a poor job of it (this dvd was shot in L.A., and that's my home territory!)

On to the concert.  Jeff Lynne doesn't hold much stage presence.  He seemed nervous and self-conscious when speaking to the audience, and it seemed he was hiding behind his 70s hair, beard, and glasses (a Jeff Lynne trademark, I guess).  Be that as it may, his voice was never better.  The performances on his many hits were terrific.  Add to that two talented and attractive cello players (Peggy Baldwin and Sarah O'Brien), a knockout backup singer (Rosie Vela -- and her voice wasn't bad either;), and a keyboard wizard (Richard Tandy), and I'd say Jeff just might have something here.

Along with a fine concert, this dvd also has an interview with Lynne.  While the interview was interesting, Lynne didn't come off sounding too bright (good thing it was a short interview).  But don't let this, or his lack of stage presence, keep you from owning this concert.  It's one dvd that every ELO fan must have.  Between 1 and 10, ZOOM gets a solid 8.

Update:  Boy, does time fly by.  It's been awhile since I last seen this concert (or sat down and listened to all my ELO music), but one thing I did come away with after spending several hours listening to my Jeff Lynne / ELO collection  is his impressive body of work.  Of the many, many dozens of his creations, I doubt there is more than a handful that I do not like.  Even with my favorite groups (Pink Floyd, Alan Parsons, Moody Blues, etc.) I cannot say that.  I don't think Jeff gets near the credit and praise that he deserves.  I urge people to sit down and take another listen to this remarkable artist.  I'm saddened more than ever that this Zoom concert never took off.",1014076800,28,2113,4.4119170984455955
1647516,5,B00005QBZD,"If you're a long time ELO fan you won't regret getting your hands on this video.  I never realized how stunningly gorgeous and sexy the Cello could be!!!  Gorgeous babes aside, it was great to hear the old tunes (they sure seem to age well) mixed with some of Jeff's latest tunes.
And if you're not a long time ELO fan remember that great music is always great, whether you remember hearing it when first released or not.
I've not only purchased the VHS version but I'm about to buy the DVD as well.  I can't make much more of a recommendation than that.",1013731200,,554,4.3076923076923075
1647517,5,B00005QBZD,"What a fablulous DVD, jam, and I mean jam packed with 23 songs, of which 22 were written by Jeff Lynne and are true masterpieces both from ELO's greatest hits and ZOOM the newest ELO cd ...
Not only was Lynne singing in top form and the band up to the par of 'studio sound' but the backup vocals by a braless Rosie Vela, a certified 'hottie' in my mind, was perfect ...
I thought the flying saucer stage effects were cute and the band may look subdued compared to ELO's rock peers, (guess it's hard to jump up and down with a cello between your legs, not to mention keyboards or a full fledged grand piano) the subdued concert style reminded me of a JoeCoker concert where all the empasis is on the music and not the sideshow antics ...
Great concert DVD I love it ....",1012521600,12,769,4.202702702702703
1647518,5,B00005QBZD,"I really enjoyed this DVD. The sound was great (dts especially) and the picture quality was very good. I particularly enjoyed watching the very attractive ladies playing strings. I don't rate this dvd at the very top of my collection but, I do put in the top ten.

1647520,5,B00005QBZD,"As with all Jeff Lynne productions, this DVD concert performance is outstanding.  The live performances are tight and very true to the original recordings.
Rosie Vela turns in a great performance singing harmonies for Jeff.
I would love to have seen the inclusion of a few tracks from Time and Secret Messages.
I hope we hear from you again soon Jeff.",1011484800,,351,4.754098360655738
1647521,5,B00005QBZD,I was looking forward to watching this DVD.  I loved ELO when I was in High School and was hoping to find some of that love on the DVD.  I wasn't disappointed!  I closed my eyes and was right back there.  Made me want to go back again.  Outstanding sound and video.,1011225600,,265,4.019230769230769
1647522,4,B00005QBZD,"You may be asking, ""Why not 5 stars?"" Well, here are my feelings about this dvd:
Sound: Couldn't be better. 5.1 dolby, a perfect mix and very faithful to the original recordings. This is the most important part to me about a music dvd. 5 stars.
Picture: Again, perfect. The backgrounds are a revolving assortment of colors, and set design is everything you'd expect from the master of the futuristic vibe. And all this comes out with a perfect mastering job... (this and very nice camera work) 5 stars
Song selection: Ok, here we go. I struggled with this but in the end my personnel bias won out... (or lost out) I never got into the real old ELO stuff and the performances contained within really never made me want to run out and buy any old ELO tunes. It's a bit top-heavy on the old stuff for my tastes. Contained within the extras a ""fan"" has a brief interview before the show and he reveals that he is very much looking forward to the show... and his (like mine) fave ELO works is a little number called ""Time"". Sadly, these works aren't even brushed upon, and by the SPLENDID sounds of ""Shine A Little Love"" and ""Don't Bring Me Down"" it pains me think of how wonderful (and fitting) tunes like ""Twilight"" and ""2095"" would have went over... needless to say, I can't get it out of my head. 4 stars.
Extras: Well, there is an interview on this that is interesting... all 9.5 minutes of it. Sammy Hagars newest dvd has a seprate disc of an hour interview. Since Jeff Lynne has been out of the ELO spotlight for 15 years I would have expected a bit more thorough of an interview. 3 stars
After it's all said and done I am VERY pleased with this effort. It sounds so clean and was fairly inexpensive, I just wished for a bit more even sound selections and a bit more in the extras dept.",1010448000,3,1788,4.340298507462687
1647523,5,B00005QBZD,"Great sound mix, excellent video, and the band sounds fantastic.
You really get a sense of how appreciative Jeff Lynne is of the fans, it really is too bad the tour was cancelled.
Trust me, watching his ""co singer"" Rosie Vela is worth the price alone.
If you like ELO at all, you'll love this disk.  Did I mention 24 tracks?",1010448000,4,324,4.311475409836065
1647524,5,B00005QBZD,"When I received my DVD and opened it, I was very skeptical about it being distributed by IMAGE Entertainment. This didn't take long to change my mind, 5 stars for the digital mastering, finally a DVD done in good digital taste. This recording is a complete, full sounding 5.1 DD and DTS that makes your home theater system work the way it was suppose to.( hope you have a GOOD subwoofer)ELO always was a different type of music and listening to it on FM or CD, you never got the fulfilled sound of what this group could do, especially in the percussion dept. Richard Tandy (Piano/Keyboards) his talent has finally been recorded properly. Even though he's not an original ELO person. I recommend this to any person that wants to see or demonstrate a Home Theater System, even if your not a ELO fan...  It all falls together. Also would have loved to seen it  in High Def, which it was recorded. By the way, I don't usually give 5 STARS.",1010448000,2,935,4.461988304093567
1647525,4,B00005QBZD,"I recall the spectacle of seeing ELO in concert once before (unfortunately, it was on TV) and how ""spread out"" the band was on stage.  There were tons of flashing lights and, other than the drummer, most of the band members were at the forefront of the stage.  This show is a little different.  It feels like more of a private concert and the focus is entirely on Jeff Lynne.  Arguably, it should be, since he is the band.  But to have a guitarist and bassist stand at the back while a backup vocalist playing no instrument stands at the front?  I don't get that.  Plus, her swaying back and forth was distracting.  I admit that this vocalist, Rosie Vela (Lynne's girlfriend), was very attractive, as well as the cellists.  The only other ELO member present prior to the new album is Richard Tandy, who does a great job filling in some violin parts on keyboard.  Though Lynne doesn't look like he has aged much, Tandy reminds us how long this band has been around.
The music sounds as good as it ever did, but the presentation seems lifeless at times...until ""Roll Over Beethoven.""  Dry ice covers the stage from all sides and there are lights galore.  This part also reminded me how underrated Lynne is on guitar.  I wish more of the show was like this.  There are some other great features on the disc, including an interview with Lynne.  I would definitely recommend it to any ELO fan.",1010102400,,1388,4.496
1647526,5,B00005QBZD,"Great sound and picture with a very entertaining line up of songs. Does Jeff Lynne ever age?(the Dick Clark complex) I have never heard his voice sound better than in this concert. Such an under-rated producer,singer,and all round talent. Buy this!",1008633600,2,248,5.073170731707317
1647527,5,B00005QBZD,"Just bought the DVD after it 'finally' released on the British shores but it was well worth the wait!!  Totally excellent DVD and will go nicely next to my other ELO DVD title, 'Live at Wembley' and 'Discovery'.  A shame to hear about what happened to the Zoom tour, surely would not have any problems if the tour was to come to England.  They always loved playing back home, I'm sure there would be a sellout over here.
Come on Jeff, come back home......",1008460800,3,455,4.392857142857143
1647528,5,B00005QBZD,"WHEN I PURCHASED THIS DVD I NEVER COULD HAVE IMAGINED WHAT AN EXCELLENT SHOW THIS WOULD BE. IT WAS REALLY HARD TO BELIEVE THIS WAS A ""LIVE"" PERFORMANCE. THE MUSIC IS INCREDIBLE AND JEFF LYNNE CONTINUES TO PROVE THAT HIS MUSIC AND SONG WRITING IS RIGHT UP THERE WITH LENNON & McCARTNEY. IF YOU PURCHASE THIS DVD, YOU'LL TREASURE IT FOREVER AND YOU WILL JOIN THE RANKS OF ELO FANS FROM ALL AROUND THE GLOBE WHO FEEL THE SAME. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! YOU CAN PROBABLY TELL THAT I DON'T USUALLY WRITE REVIEWS, BUT IN THIS CASE I COULD NOT RESIST PASSING THIS ALONG.",1008201600,6,567,4.40952380952381
1647529,4,B00005QBZD,"Like a lot of rabid ELO fans, I jumped at this DVD at the first opportunity. Jeff Lynne returns to the live stage hot on the heels of his album ""Zoom"". He has put together an interesting mix of old and new faces with keyboardist Richard Tandy the only survivor from the original years to put in an appearance. Lynne's current girlfriend Rosie Vella does her best hippy impression by swaying an awful lot whilst providing excellent backing vocals. The rhythm section is as tight as one could want (the drummer even using a fire extinguisher at one point!) and the small but highly attractive cello section rounds out the ensemble. The setlist is pretty good with the expected plundering of new material dotted throughout the set which has heavy emphasis on the ""Out Of The Blue"" and ""New World Record"" albums. Sadly, the eighties have vanished in Lynne's eyes and albums such as ""Time"" and ""Secret Messages"" don't get a mention. This, in my mind, is the solitary drawback to this set. The sound is excellent and the picture good. I must admit that the moronic American crowd got on my nerves with a standing ovation after each number. Please guys, give it a break!!!!!",1008201600,10,1167,4.669902912621359
1647530,5,B00005QBZD,I can't get over how GOOD this dvd is!!! This performance really brings back the timelessness of some legendary songs and some really good new songs by jeff lynne and elo!!
