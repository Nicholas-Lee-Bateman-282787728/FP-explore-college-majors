8209419,1,B000TGWKSA,"As a Lightning Arnis Practitioner since the late 90's and having trained  under one of the Direct students of both Maestro Ybanez and Mang Ben, this video is not again IS NOT a representation of LSA. Yes there are some LSA in it but the fundamental  movements and Philosophy is not LSA. For one - it is a total contradiction in it's footwork applications. Mr. Ric Acosta  might have  modified his LSA based on his understanding and personal choice, that's his. And I giive him credit for that. But to call this video Secrets of Lightning is a true Misrepresentation. As one of my co-practitioners said when we viewed this video..' maybe that's why it's titles as such because even direct students don't know that those movements are LSA."" There is a bunch of true and slightly modified LSA practitioners videos in YouTube- but they still stick to the fundamentals of the system.",1380240000,,878,4.718954248366013
8209420,1,B000TGWKSA,"This video is a misrepresentation of the Lightning Scientific Arnis system. Nothing against Ric Acosta or his skills. However if you are looking specifically to learn LSA, this isn't the video to learn from. You are better off going to YouTube and looking for real LSA Masters like Jon Escudero, Nols DelRosario or Shawn Porter.  These are real LSA masters ranked by Grandmaster Ben Lema. Although the techniques on this video has some Lightning influences, to title it Secrets of Lightning Scientific Arnis I feel is misleading.",1380067200,3,529,5.080459770114943
8209421,5,B000TGWKSA,I greatly enjoyed this demonstration of Filipino Martial Arts. I am a practitioner myself and found his techniques to be very good.,1377216000,,131,5.0
8209422,5,B000TGWKSA,"This is a nice introduction into LSA, starting with the basic 13 count (which I actually prefer over the various Pekiti Tirsia, Modern Arnis and LaMeCo Eskrima counts) and moving on from there into more advanced topics. The instruction is good, and the movements are shown from different angles. A key thing about LSA is it delves into both speed AND power, while most other FMA systems I have seen seem to, more or less, select one or the other. For the price it is definitely a good buy.",1374796800,2,489,4.50561797752809
8209423,3,B000TGWKSA,"Looks like it was filmed for VHS sometime ago but that is alright, it captures the basics of this system in a way that some videos miss out on.  I would recommend this video for people who are trying to gain a different FMA perspective.",1366502400,2,236,4.2444444444444445
8209424,5,B000TGWKSA,"This video is jam packed with concepts and techniques. A must buy for begginers to build a base, a nice encyclopedia for more seasoned practitioners. There is no way anyone can argue with the price and the content.",1345852800,4,214,4.657894736842105
