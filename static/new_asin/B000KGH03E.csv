2690229,5,B000KGH03E,"I own all of Shiva Rea's DVD's (that I know of) and I like the style of this DVD.  The flowing movement of the different sections are sometimes exhilirating, sometimes relaxing and sometimes both. The soothing instructions and beautiful scenery make this DVD a joy just to watch.  I have only practiced 3 sections so far but I felt very energized (and emotionally better also) afterwards.

The abiity to customize the practice is such a bonus.  I appreciate Shiva Rea's effort to make her DVD's more than enough...they are excellent!",1167436800,9,533,4.888888888888889
2690230,5,B000KGH03E,"I've had this DVD for about 2 months and I love it.  It is very different from Yoga Shakti.  This is a flowing dancey yoga that dancers or dancers at heart will love.  My favorite sequence is the Creative flow.  Most of the sequences are set to drums.  Other have said that it is the same as Yoga trance dance, but I don't own that DVD yet. It is suited for all levels.  The best thing about the yoga is that it feels like dance and it is circular instead of linear like most yoga.  Your body is meant to move in a circular motion. It feels natural. I do mostly kundalini yoga and this is a perfect compliment to that.  My next purchase will be Yoga trance dance.  Dance is body joy!!",1167004800,11,684,4.082706766917293
2690231,5,B000KGH03E,"This is my favorite of all Shiva's DVD's, I continue to be astonished at each new offering she brings ~ there seems to be no end to the creative inspiration!

There are 20 segments here, enough to challenge us all, 6 pre-set practices, some 30-40 minutes and the longest being 108 minutes, this one may be a problem for the time constrained but it is a thorough, liberating workout.  I know many people will criticize this DVD as being too difficult for beginners just as they did with Yoga Shakti but Shiva clearly states in the booklet that came with the set that there are many yoga DVDs out there for beginners so she made this one for beginner-advanced to more intermediate practitioners.  In this particular situation, I would say ""beginner-advanced"" does not mean someone who has dragged their yoga mat to class a couple of times a week for a year but instead someone who has had a devoted, daily or at least several times weekly yoga practice for at least a year.  Some of the arm balances and knee workouts are intense so I would recommend healthy knees and some upper body strength for the intermediate pre-set practices called ""Backbend Flow"", ""Hip Opening Flow"" and ""Creative Flow"".  The only criticism I would bring to this workout DVD is that some of these sequences are rather complex and full of new material that most of us have never tried in a yoga pose and so may be a little confusing to some people ~ therefore I would recommend that you watch first before trying them.  (This is really a minor gripe and not enough to take away a star)

A few of these sequences can be found on the Yoga Trance Dance DVD and the Creative Core Abs DVD but don't worry, they blend beautifully and there is plenty of new stuff here to keep us all interested.

Thank you again, Shiva for all you do to make our lives rich and beautiful",1163808000,122,1837,4.479041916167665
2690232,5,B000KGH03E,"I already have this DVD for 2 months (bought it from Acacia)and I love it , I use it regularly along with her ""yoga shakti"" . This style of yoga is a little more creative and fluid than ""yoga shakti"" (hence the name) but it's definitely more ""normal"" yoga unlike ""yoga trance dance"" . On this DVD you also have lots to choose from , it has 6 preset practices :

Backbend Flow - 108 min (a tough one!)

Hip Openers Flow - 77 min

Creative Flow - 63 min

Beginning Flow - 43 min

Lunar Flow for Flexilibity - 41 min

Meditative Flow - 25 min

all of these practices are made from 20 segments you can choose from ""Matrix"" such as 7 new sun salutations (no traditional boring salutations!) standing pose flow , 2 great backbend flows and a long hip opening flow which I really love and includes some great stretches , some I've nver seen before ,there's also a handstand , a core segment (that is also on her ""creative core abs"") and opening and closing meditations, the bonus disc includes some interviews and some tips for practicing.

If you have wrist problems this DVD might not be for you since there are a lot of planks /side planks and pushups otherwise go get this DVD!",1163721600,99,1174,4.304545454545455

2690267,4,B000KGH03E,"I enjoyed this DVD and it has already introduced some new yoga poses into my practice. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is before purchasing this dvd, last year I bought Shiva Rea's Daily Energy Collection. I still LOVE this DVD and still enjoy it more then I will this one. I also liked the yoga matrix set-up better in the daily energy in comparison this one. ALSO if you are fairly new to yoga I would not recommend this DVD, but I would recommend Shiva Rea. I started with her ""Shiva Rea Flow for beginners"" then moved into the daily energy collection and then this DVD. I've been practicing yoga for a few years now and never gained the strength and flexibility I have now, until I started using Shiva Rea's DVD's.",1426896000,,731,4.266187050359712
2690268,2,B000KGH03E,This DVD is ok but for me these kind of exercises are way to slow and her set of Solar and Lunar exercises are all exercises taken from Karate practices.

2690307,5,B000KGH03E,"This is a fantastic workout for beginners to experienced. For beginners you just have to be careful to not overdue it and stick with the general preset matrix that goes for 45 minutes. It's a full body workout and not too hard, not too easy. You can go at your own pace and according to your own body's preferences. The musical accompanyment is very nice as well.",1388102400,,363,4.432835820895522
2690308,5,B000KGH03E,"Another great DVD! This DVD may not be for beginners, in fact it may be a turnoff for many first timers. This DVD explores free movement and flowing asanas and awakens your creative being. I am an experienced yogi and the first few times did some of these routines I was thinking, ""what is this lady trying to make me do?"" But then, after practicing the routines a few times, I realized what she was driving at. Shiva rea is trying to awaken the fluidity in your spine and body. My spine is loose and fluid and can be self adjusted with just a slight shift of my spine. I am a massage therapist and this DVD keeps my back pain away and inspires my creativity to do my job to my very best.",1387065600,,688,4.141791044776119

2690311,5,B000KGH03E,"Love this DVD! You work every muscle in your body, and afterwards you feel awesome! But you can't do it if you're new to yoga, better start with basic and move on to this! For those who can't go to a gym or yoga studio it's great!",1379980800,,230,3.9148936170212765
2690312,5,B000KGH03E,I never had contact with Shiva Rea before. I am a professional dancer as well Pilates instructor! I found this DVD very professional and serious! Shiva is not playing around or showing herself off. For me she seems very engaged in deliver the Yoga Flow in a very respectful way. I travel a lot and since I bought her DVD I use to do her classes while traveling! Really nice practice and restoring! Thanks Shiva for your beautiful workout and deep commitment with Yoga Flow!,1379548800,,473,4.576470588235294
2690323,2,B000KGH03E,"Recalling back to my beginning years as a yogi and now as an instructor, this is an awful video to start out because there is NO thoughtful care given with the verbal instructions in alignment, proper posture and breathing - this video would only confuse and discourage a beginner student. Also, the Sanskrit terms for postures (asanas) and breathing (pranayamas) should come secondary after the English term for the asanas that the dvd is trying to achieve for the student.
For intermediate and slightly advance students, personally I would say that it is suitable if the student is disciplined enough to care about the PROPER (I repeat, PROPER) alignments, breathing and kinesiology goals that each asana is trying to achieve for the individual.
Somehow, Yoga has been bastardized in many studios in the U.S., unlike the practices that I have been lucky enough to witness and experience in Mumbai and Kerala India, Zen Centers in Japan and Buddhist Qigong temples in China - the practice of yoga in these countries are treated with much internal respect, deep reverence and truly approached with a philosophical energy taken from the breath-work that is considered the utmost power (more so than achieving the poses) - this quality is very much lacking in many studios, as I am sad to say.",1377648000,3,1291,4.953917050691245
2690324,3,B000KGH03E,I am a beginner yoga practicioner. This was way too tough for me. I almost injured myself trying to do these advanced moves. I think its a great style and maybe some day I will be advanced enough for this DVD. She is elegant and it is well made. Wish it wasn't so..hard.,1375401600,,270,4.113207547169812
2690325,5,B000KGH03E,"I already had Yoga Shakti, and was looking for more from Shiva Rea. This was an excellent purchase. Granted, it's one of those that I do in private (like Zumba), as I would feel self-conscious doing some of the free form movement at the beginning in front of anyone else. It makes you really loosen up and free conscious thought more than the very excellent, but more traditional Yoga Shakti, and is still challenging. I recommend both as complements to one another.",1371772800,,466,4.695121951219512
2690326,3,B000KGH03E,"Lot of changes throughout her routine and the changes happen quickly. Yet I haven't practiced using her DVD enough to get into a routine, because of the quick changes.

2690329,2,B000KGH03E,"I was disappointed with this one. I have one or two of her other dvd's so this was a let down. The instruction is very poor. She does her own thing and tells you to let your body do your own thing, which to me defeats the purpose of getting a dvd. Granted I only checked out 3 of her work outs on that dvd, so maybe the other ones are better, but that's all i had patience for. Sadly this is the worst yoga dvd practice i've ever had.",1364601600,2,434,3.8333333333333335

2690332,2,B000KGH03E,"Unfortunately this foam roller is not the high quality cast foam roller that you see in the gyms.  It looks like it is, on the photo.  It is made of tiny little Styrofoam pieces, that all look like they are about to fall apart, and can easily be damaged.  It does not look like it will last, without getting lots of 'chips', and 'holes' in in very quickly after a few uses...  It is nice and long, and very dense, but the construction lacks any durability.  i am very disappointed!!  I got black thinking it would be somehow more durable than the blue ones.. Boy am I sorry!!  The description does not state it is made of tiny styrofoam pieces, not the ""foam"" rollers you see at the gym.  This one will soon have so many divots that it will impede the function!  I'm going to make some kind of protective cover in the hopes it will last longer!  Live and Learn",1359849600,,860,4.253086419753086
2690343,3,B000KGH03E,"This is an amazing dvd....Shiva Rea is so flexible and can contort her body; but it's too advanced for me.  I would have been better off with buying one for beginners.  It is a great dvd, tho.  The quality is good and the location is in my home state...
I would recommend this dvd to people who have experience with Vinyasa Flow Yoga and not novices like myself.",1354665600,,362,4.294117647058823
2690344,3,B000KGH03E,"For many of the segments, you are facing away from the screen for a significant portion of the time.  She instructs you to let her voice guide you, but the instructions are generally poor or lacking all together.  You'll be swaying your arms back and forth and she'll say something like ""flow through and bend the knee"".  Umm, HELLO, I can't see you! How about ""Swing both hands overhead, turn to the left, and come into warrior one"" or something?

The other thing I didn't like was the speed for some of the transitions.  I have been practicing yoga for quite awhile and while I don't mind a fast-paced flow, you need to give people time to at least get their feet aligned in one pose before moving on the the next.  My yoga mat was a crumpled mess within 10 minutes from having to slide my feet around to keep up; not to mention the potential for injury due to lack of alignment.",1325376000,3,881,4.341463414634147
2690345,5,B000KGH03E,"The matrix selection option allows you to design your workout to correspond to your mood.  Shivea is very innovative with the movements she presents, and thorough with the instruction.  I have become an avid fan of all of her instructional DVD's, as they break the routine which becomes all too familiar, having practiced yoga for over 30 years.  I would consider this particular DVD to be challenging with some of the movements, although she offers less difficult options, which relieves any pressure to excel.  I would categorize this DVD as advanced beginner to intermediate.  Lots of variations and choices, so there will be no boredom or ""doldrums"" with your work out choice.",1323216000,,680,5.035714285714286

2690347,5,B000KGH03E,"Shiva Rea creates another wonderful practice! I have a couple other of Shiva's DVD's, and this is one of my favorite!! Shiva mixes up it up with different exercises and techniques to keep your daily Yoga practice fresh and exciting. Let's face it, doing the same thing over and over, especially in your own home, can make you feel like your practice is becoming stagnant and repetitive. Fluid Power can take your practice to a new level, challenging your body and mind. I love the meditation aspects of the DVD, which enables you to link your cognitive mind and body together to create a beautiful state of awareness. The Yoga matrix is awesome and easy to use, there are so many ways to mix and match that you can create a different practice sequence almost every day. Some aspects of this DVD may be challenging for beginners, but if you have some basis of Yoga already, this can be a great addition to your Yoga practice.",1309996800,,924,4.572289156626506
2690348,5,B000KGH03E,I love Shiva Rea's Fluid Power DVD.  The photography is absolutely breathtaking and helps me feel transported from my living room to be right there with her.  The vinyasa flow she guides us through is very rhythmical and relaxing.  I highly recommend it.,1306886400,,254,4.8604651162790695
2690349,5,B000KGH03E,"This yoga dvd brought so much more to my practice and I would 100% recommend it! The matrix is awesome: it keeps each day fresh and new and is so easy to use. I also really like the music only option.

2690350,5,B000KGH03E,"I love Shiva Rea, and this workout is probably my new favorite. Very fluid postures which create a flexible, difficult, and effective routine. I would not recommend this for beginners however... if you are new to fluid Vinyasa practice try her other DVD which also has a matrix that allows you to build your own routine: Shiva Rea Daily Energy. I love her holistic and fluid approach to yoga and will be buying her trance DVD next. This seems like goofey ""hippy stuff"", but is a great practice!",1304294400,,494,4.625

2690352,3,B000KGH03E,This video is beautifully shot and compiled. But there is no gradual progress. You need to directly go into the deep bend and twist. It is very easy to hurt yourself if you are not an experienced yogi. It would be wise to start the practice in a warm environment.,1298073600,,263,4.28
2690363,5,B000KGH03E,"I love Shiva Rea, and this dvd is one of my favorites! If you're looking for a traditional yoga dvd, this one's not for you. I wouldn't recommend it for beginners either. It definitely helps to be familiar with Shiva's style, basic yoga poses, and modifications. It's a great workout for those who are looking for that aspect. I find Shiva challenging, but very calming. Her dvds are the best! I don't know why I waited so long to get this one!",1289520000,,444,4.426829268292683

2690365,2,B000KGH03E,"The inside of the DVD cover has a disclaimer saying that due to the amount of video she wanted to put on the DVD and the constraints of space, the yoga is much faster than she would teach in a class. For one, it makes it really difficult to move from one asana to the next, plus you don't stay in them once you get into them. I felt like she spent a lot of time on things that were less essential and I didn't find a really good practice amongst all the options. I bought this DVD for the options, and I have been practicing yoga for 15 years, but, while some of the movements are interesting, I do not like this DVD simply bc I do not feel like there is a straight forward succinct practice on it.",1277769600,8,698,3.992857142857143
2690366,3,B000KGH03E,"As much as I love yoga, what I really need is a practical approach. This is not to say that there isn't practicality to Shiva's approach, but how to say? I get REALLY bored when she starts yammering on about a bunch of googly muck. I want to hear about how to move, and how to breathe, and what to avoid tensing, and be reminded to relax what tends to get tense but she really takes it to the nth degree. I meditate when I practice yoga, too, but I find her thoughts obnoxious sometime, and actually my flow of concentration and enjoyment and focus feel very interrupted by her constant out loud meditative thoughts.",1275091200,8,616,4.3652173913043475
2690367,5,B000KGH03E,"This is probably my favorite Shiva Rea DVD.  It's so versatile and I can use it if I want a tough yoga workout or if I want a more soothing one.  This DVD has it all!

What I love about this DVD:

**Pre-set practices of varying lengths, both shorter and longer flows, ranging from 26 minutes to 108 minutes.

**the breath-taking scenery of White Sands National Park

**Shiva's soothing voice

**the unusual flows.  I particularly like the Creative Flow.  I actually feel more creative after I've done this practice!

**the movements themselves.  There is something magical about the circular movements that are such a part of this DVD.  My joints feel freer and looser, my head feels clearer, and I feel at peace with myself and with the world after doing this DVD.

Things to be aware of in this DVD.  I'm not calling these negatives, since they don't detract from the DVD.

**advanced poses like handstands.  Shiva doesn't give a lot of modifications for these, so I have to make up my own.  I don't get discouraged however.  I view these poses as something to work towards.

**the dancer, who appears in front of Shiva in some of the sections.  I find her a bit distracting when I'm trying to look at Shiva and follow her movements.

Another wonderful creation from my favorite yoga teacher, Shiva Rea.",1269907200,3,1305,4.635964912280702
2690368,4,B000KGH03E,"I bought this DVD several months after Yoga Shakti so I wouldn't get bored, and I must say, I haven't yet with Fluid Power. I agree with the one reviewer who said it was a sequel to Yoga Shakti. To get the most benefit, I think one needs to have experienced Yoga Shakti first; otherwise, I think someone new to yoga and to Shiva's teaching style could easily get overwhelmed with this DVD.

Personally, I love the segments that fall under the Creative Flow sequence on the DVD: Prana Flow Meditation, Spiral Flow Meditation, Kalari Vinyasa, Jala Namaskar, Water Core (found on Creative Core Abs as well), Prana Yoga Slow Wave, Fluid Systems Meditation, and Savasana. Some of my other favorites include Pranayama with Chanting, Standing Pose Mandala, Forward Bends and Hip Openers, and Mandala Namaskars I and  II.

These sequences showcase some really cool and creative vinyasa flows, such as the Kalari and Jala Namaskars, that I've never even seen before. Shiva, as usual, takes these traditional vinyasa sequences to a whole new level. You definitely learn a lot of new poses and techniques.

I'm still trying to master some of the harder sequences like the Dancing Warrior 1008 series and Foundation Vinyasa - a tough one for the arms! In addition, both the Backbending Sequences and Handstands are tough for me. Personally, I prefer the Backbending Sequences found on Shiva's other DVDs, ""Flow Yoga for Beginners"" and ""Yoga Shakti."" I feel the ones on here are for more for the intermediates and advanced. Hopefully, if I keep practicing these segments, I'll work my way up to Shiva's level.

Overall, a very enjoyable and different DVD. Just remember to watch a few times beforehand since there is a lot of new material to digest.",1261785600,4,1736,4.871186440677966

After lamenting my situation, I finally decided to purchase some yoga DVDs to maintain my practice and I am so happy with this one.  It is creative, challenging, and beautiful.  I did not believe that a DVD could provide energy and inspiration.  However, this one really delivers.  I recommend it to all my fellow yogis out there!  Namaste!",1259539200,,477,4.619047619047619
2690370,3,B000KGH03E,"I really wanted to like this DVD and over the past year I've tried to incorporate it into my exercise regime unfortunately I just can't get into Shiva's free-flow interpretive style of Yoga and FLUID POWER sits on the shelf (in favour of Rodney Yee) unless I'm feeling very creative (and a little drunk).

I've been practicing Yoga for many years now and would consider myself to be an intermediate to advanced Yogi who mostly practices at home so I've done my fair share of Yoga DVDs and although this is a great workout it's just not for me. On the positive side though there is a ton to discover in the 213 minutes contained here all easily accessible through the awesome Yoga Matrix menu which allows you to `create your own custom practice' (this feature should be included on all workout DVDs). The music is really good too with audio options for instruction or music only, although personally I don't know how this workout would be possible without instruction. This has also been beautifully filmed with amazing scenery and there are tons of special features included on the bonus disk.

Shiva Rea is a fantastic instructor (once she stops free-flowing) unfortunately most of this practice is un-traditional and I couldn't follow or get into her original, innovative style.  Finding myself lost unless I could see the TV (at all times) continually facing the wrong direction or using the wrong arm or leg and straining my neck to see what she was up to next.

I would also consider this to be an advanced workout and beginners should be warned that Shiva flows quickly from one position to the next with some very challenging and complex bindings and poses and unless you're fluent in the ancient language of Sanskrit or a Yoga instructor you'll be lost with the amount of Sanskrit used here without translation.

This is a really popular workout and I envy those that appreciate this style, I guess I'm just a traditionalist when it comes to my Yoga practice.",1257552000,15,1968,4.742690058479532
2690371,5,B000KGH03E,This DVD has so many choices that it's like having multiple yoga workouts. It's definitely worth more than the price because there is such a variety of levels and routines that you can pick and choose. There is an incredible matrix on the dvd that allows me to interactively build my own workout. The workouts are challenging and contain a variety of variations and levels so that it accomodates all levels of fitness. Shiva Rea has a calming voice that is both motivating and relaxing.,1255564800,,486,4.729411764705882
2690372,5,B000KGH03E,"I am a long time Kundalini yoga practitioner and I wanted to try some different types of yoga for a change.  This video is wonderful!  The introduction talks about how our bodies are composed of fluid and have a movement of their own, and then you can chose what type and length of session you would like to do after that.  The scenery is beautiful and the segments are really well explained, so you are guided through the poses as they flow.  It does require some experience in yoga and a degree of flexibility, but I would consider myself a rusty intermediate and did fine with the poses.  The flowing movements during each pose do remind my of Kundalini sets but the way it all comes together is different and really appealing.  I felt deeply relaxed by the end of the tape and I look forward to using it again.",1255219200,,814,4.3933333333333335

I love the way she incorporates the spiritual aspect of Yoga for the true Yoga is all about the spiritual practice.  Shiva Rae has thought of everything you can possibly need for your Yoga practice and motivation.

The matrix makes for a flexible practice that doesn't get old or boring, and can be adjusted to fit the time you have available.

however, i have a really hard time loving this one.  it's a bit too creative, as other reviewers have put it.  it digresses away from yogic exertion and brings you more into meditative flow.  a great practice, yes, just not something i was hoping to get out of shiva.",1249257600,2,656,4.470588235294118
2690382,5,B000KGH03E,"If you were only going to buy two discs, this should be your second one. It has 3 full yoga routines, plus the yoga matrix. This is an evolution of Shiva Rea--it is much more creative than Yoga Shakti. There are parts that I like, and parts that I don't. In fact, I don't like any of the 3 routines as a whole routine!  However, I use the matrix and use only the segments that I really like. And it is a fine workout too!  Many of the segments are too easy or too creative for me, but I just never do them!  This can be a challenging disc if you want it to be (chosing the more challenging sequences) and includes some unconventional poses that Shiva developed on her own.

The commentary is deep and interesting. She says things like ""taste the nectar of relaxation,"" or ""feel the rivers of your body flowing out."" I find her metaphors deep and inspiring, and she doesn't overuse them. The music is interesting, soothing--a perfect complement to this exceptional practice.",1245801600,6,973,4.449438202247191

This style does not seem the best for stiff people, though. Because of the frequent movements and rotations of the body, it's easy to twist a muscle. I would recommend warming up properly.
Though the DVD boosts over 200 minutes of footage, most of the segments involve breathing or dancing around ""free form."" I am not interested in the ""dance"" element of yoga, so I was disappointed. I had expected longer flow segments. (I loved the flow elements but wished there were more.)

The location, music and the flow in which she executes the movement, just left me delighted with the beauty of the experience in her brand of fluid yoga. I have experience with other yoga videos like Crunch and Yoga Makeovers by Sarah Ivanhoe. I have also taken yoga classes in college, and perform the exercises in Yoga Zone and Namaste Yoga. This DVD reminds me somewhat of an Ashtanga Yoga class that almost left me in a trance, because it was that good.  Shiva Rea - Fluid Power is not for beginners but more for people who can handle the trickier moves such as those shown in Namaste Yoga broadcasted in Fit TV.  Other reviews go into more depth on how the DVD is set up, but  I will say that I was really impressed after I opened the case to find not only a manual, but two DVDs as well.

I have to say her exercises are very different, and one needs to keep a very open mind when doing them.  From my experience, I feel that she is coming from this angle:  where the student can expand themselves through movements that are not traditionally yoga and are more modern movement.  You can move like a baby swimming in water while you lie on your back.  You curl like a fetus as if you were back in your mother's womb.  A bit imaginative, however, effective.  I say this DVD is for those yoginis who are New Age focused and are willing to try anything...or are Shiva Rhea Fans.  Namaste.",1243209600,6,771,4.373239436619718

It uses a lot of Yoga vocabulary so I had to constantly watch the TV to know what to do because I couldn't tell just from the audio.  I consider myself flexible but not particularly graceful like a dancer and I had a difficult time keeping up with the fast pase.  This DVD is not bad but just be aware that it is not for beginner to moderate.  I would consider it very advanced and you'd better know your vocab.,1241308800,4,541,4.163461538461538

the only thing i don't care for that much is the setting.  i'm a water person, not a desert person, so being in a desert with no sight of any body of water makes me feel a bit claustrophobic.  just a personal preference.  but it is a beautiful setting in white sand with mountains in the background if you enjoy that.  oh, and i'm not a huge fan of the music in the background either, although it seems to go well with the desert setting.

I have to say, though, that these flows, being very untraditional, take some getting used to, but they are a lot of fun. I use this DVD on weekends or when I have more time at my disposal to experiment.

Just as ""Yoga Shakti"" the DVD contains preset practices as well as a matrix to customize your own practice. What is better about this one is that the matrix contains the length of each segment in minutes, so it is easy to estimate how long your total practice will take.

She flays limbs around wildly with quick flow instructions, a beginner or even intermediate yoga person can easily injure body parts by wiggling in this fashion. It is good to be creative in any exercise form but yoga is meant to introduce stillness and stretching, it is not a dance form. Also teachers like Shiva must introduce level of complexity, meant for beginners, intermediate or advanced yoga, not for all.

I just want to emphasize for potential buyers that the style of her yoga in this DVD involves more dance-like movements than the product description emphasizes. Insert ""lots of spiraly swaying and coordination"" for ""fluid power."" Anyone been to a good rave lately? Alright, alright, it's not that extreme, but this DVD is quite unique and probably not suited for beginner and intermediate folks looking for a DVD to help them practice the basics more consistently at home. I have been an informal student of traditional yoga (the asanas and the philosophic system) for the past ten years, and this DVD's approach really turned me off. Obviously, Shiva Rea can move however she wants to and teach however she wants to -- and aesthetically the result on this DVD is quite beautiful.

With Shiva Rea, you  ALWAYS get the content of 5 other DVD's in one-- plus an ENDLESS ability to grow and create different practices.  So just in terms of money saving and keeping yourself interested her DVD's are fantastic.  This has pre-set practices and an ability to make your own routines.  A mini-booklet comes with you to teach you how to do that.  It's just so cool.

If you have her other DVD's you'll still feel like you're getting something really new  here.

This one is all about water based FLOW.  Stunningly creative, beautiful, fun to do.  You can make as as easy (total beginner) to advanced as you want.  And anything in between so you can start anywhere and grow with this.

She has a master's degree in world dance and grew up on the beach-- this DVD brings the ""water"" element of her life together better than any previous ones.  Her yoga flow movements always have great music.  It's rhythmic, gets you moving, gets you in the mood, always authenic but modern world music at same time.

What is so great about Shiva Rea too is she is equally fun for men and women, and any age can always enjoy her as an instructor.  Her trademark is being almost endlessly creative, and providing content that you can keep bringing out to use without being bored over months and months time.

You really can't miss with her-- she has it all.  Power, flexibility, creativity, flowing style, a dancer's beauty of movement.  Her teaching is interesting and spiritual without ANY New Agey-ness that has me about to return another DVD.

Because of the several different pre-set pracices PLUS the ability to create your own practice it's so much better than other teachers.  Shiva Rea.  In the yoga DVD world she is one of the greatest.",1207180800,7,1790,4.630573248407643

The DVD was informative and interesting, can definitely work this into my practice, but will not make it daily affair--I like to keep a pose for longer than Rea does, to hold it in stillness.  Disc one is well-stocked with practice options--disc two is just interviews, Rea discussing 'what is yoga?'--that sort of thing, so don't think you get two discs of classes. Well-filmed on the beach, at times with a small army of yogis and yoginis perched on neighboring dunes. Rea does not address risks associated with poses, and you may tire of her side-plank-to-backbend variation.",1207008000,5,717,4.782258064516129

While the cinematography is beautifully breathtaking, the movements are rather abstract and extremely hard to follow.  I was hoping for some poses, or perhaps fluid transitions between poses, but I got completely lost in the ""whirling dervish"" aspect of it all.  It contained nothing solid I could base my practice on, even though the introduction seemed very interesting and engaging.

I would look away from the TV for a second to see if I could do the moves by just listening to her, and then when I looked back I was always on the wrong move.  I'm not a stupid person and have done yoga many times.

2690468,5,B000KGH03E,"I bought myself this DVD for Christmas on a friend's recommendation, and I love it. I'm an intermediate beginner in my yoga practice, and at first I found some of the moves difficult and too fast. But I stuck with it, trying a new matrix line-up every day, but keeping my favorites, and now I am really hooked.

I like that Shiva uses the yoga names for her moves, it's part of the whole picture. I enjoy the chanting, it focuses my mind and calms the little thoughts that distract me as I think about the day ahead. I find my heart rate reaching into the training zone, and even though I've been exercising for decades, I have developed longer, leaner muscles in my arms and legs just since Christmas. Shiva's voice is never annoying or preachy, and the scenery is breathtaking.

I recommend this DVD for anyone, including beginners, who want to challenge themselves and take their yoga practice to a new level. If she goes too fast, just go at your own pace and keep your focus until you are on the same move she is on -- it doesn't matter if you miss a turn around the mat. If some of the poses seem impossible, just do what you can. Challenging yourself is how you grow.

The matrix is great, and once you've watched or tried most or all of the sections, you'll know what you like and can try adding in or switching them around for something new. I like the Water Core -- ten minutes of abs without a single crunch!

I own no other yoga DVDs yet, but I feel I can use this DVD far into the future without becoming bored or wanting more. Try it!",1202774400,5,1548,4.273037542662116
2690469,5,B000KGH03E,"I was drawn to this DVD, but afraid of the word ""Power"" in the title.  What drew me in was reviewing a clip of Shiva's introduction about our fluid natures, the tides of our breath, the rhythmic approach of the practices, and particularly her promise that the sequences are therapeutic for circulating synovial fluid through the joints and spine.

""Synovial"" was the pivotal word for me.  Joint health is a concern of mine, as are releasing stress and undoing the damage of sitting over a computer all day.  While you can undisputedly stretch, strengthen and release with the traditional schools of yoga, I thought this unusual approach - away from static holds - might very well facilitate a lubrication of the joints.

To my delight, performing these fluid movements delivers Shiva's promise.  It takes your yoga and literally pumps it through you.  The program is beautifully filmed, with colorful delights to take our minds into the practice - orange glowing sunlight, azure blue skies, white sands, dusk reflecting on the desert.  There is an amazing segment where Shiva performs a vinyasa practice while ""standing"" on the water - how did they do it?  Shiva's voice is soothing, and the music brings your practice into the realm of auditory pleasure.  In fact I will play the DVD in the ""music only"" mode while doing household chores for a mood enhancer.

Innovative core strengthening sections are incorporated to assist with gaining strength for harder poses.  Some moves involve rolling from side to side on the floor like a kid, or reclining on the mat and waving your bent knees in the air as you are invited to return to the womb and swim in amniotic fluid.  There is a nice variety of moving prana - it's so much nicer to be physically moving while breathing, which encourages deeper expansion and release, than sitting on a pillow and forcing yourself to breath in a resting pose.

I would not recommend this practice for very new beginners or people with physical problems.  That said, I find great benefit from it despite joint problems and my own bad back - but I have a good foundation in yoga and know my limitations.  I'll never be able to perform the full backbend flow but this DVD has so much material I can use, the balance of usable outweighs the overly challenging (for me).

You have to have an open mind or a playful spirit to enjoy this offering from Shiva Rea.  Dancers, swimmers and beach people will most likely embrace it; playful and creative people, check it out.  Traditionalists, Fluid Power is not for you.  I embrace the innovation and snub my nose at the office desk, e-mails, rules and regulations every time I indulge in this DVD, like dipping into a yogic box of Godiva chocolates, and savor every moment.

My one complaint for which I'd take off half a star - during the Savasana, there is a loud reed instrument playing which should have been dubbed down.  It detracts from a perfect ending.",1202515200,15,2935,4.724950884086444
2690470,5,B000KGH03E,"First I must admit I have not actually done any of the sets on the dvd but I have viewed it and it is absolutely incredible! I have every other one of Shiva's dvd's and this could become one of my favorites....eventually. I have been out of any of my yoga practices for quite some time  now and although I would consider myself an intermediate as far as knowing most of the poses, my flexibility is back to beginner. This style of yoga is inspiring and I would absolutely love it if Shiva did come out with a more basic intermediate program for those who are working on building flexibility and endurance. It not fair that we can't benefit from her incredible style because we are not up to advanced level yet! (I would say most of the sets on this are for advanced to almost advanced) Shiva...are you listening? I would bet there are plenty of beginners and intermediates that would just love a fluid program to include more basic poses in this flowing style! I would be first on line to get it! If you are already pretty flexible....go for this one. It's excellent!",1201824000,,1067,4.4438775510204085
2690471,4,B000KGH03E,"I am a relatively new yogini and not dedicated to practicing every day-YET! I used to do ballet though, so although I found this challenging I was able to modify the harder poses.

What I most liked about this DVD is that it brought out my sense of humor and made me giggle at myself. Once I fell out of pigeon pose, and during one of the 'dancier' sections I caught myself in the mirror looking a bit like an extra from Arabian Nights, and had to laugh! But why not!? Yoga doesn't have to be all serious and 'focused' every second. I enjoyed the flowing movements, having studied ballet. I usually practice Iyengar, which I love, but this made me realize that Iyengar is perhaps a bit uptight in character. This made me laugh and free my body, and when I'd finished I felt motivated and creative and less worried. 'Go with the flow' somehow absorbs into your body.

The other thing I liked was moving about within each pose. Even when I do Iyengar now, I think I will remember this and feel less intimidated about shifting my weight, position or just simply trusting my body and experimenting within the pose. This is what the DVD cultivates, for me- joy, trusting one's body, and (naturally) fluidity.

I aim to channel some of my newfound fluidity into other areas of my life. We yogis and yoginis sometimes worry way too much about essentially trivial aspects of life, because that's often in our characters. For example, with me, I often think or worry too much about whether or not I'm eating healthy food, and forget about the sensual pleasures involved or the scrumminess of chocolate and cake etc. Paradoxically, by aiming to open our hearts we sometimes become too closed to the things in the world around us which we deem 'wrong.' This Dvd made me realize this, so it must be doing something right! I highly recommend it!",1200960000,7,1832,4.562310030395137

2690473,4,B000KGH03E,"Different, challenging in some ways.  Good. Some unique undulating movements, a lot of circular motions.  I'd probably feel more enthusiastic about it if I were better at those types of movements, and then I'd feel like giving it 5 stars.",1198627200,,238,4.925
2690504,5,B000KGH03E,"I don't want to focus on other reviews too much for my own review, but I did read some and noticed a consensus by some of the negatives that there was too much dance and not enough yoga, or that it might not even be able to be properly called yoga.  I personally love this DVD.  As someone who is healthy and very fit, working out regularly with yoga and running, I find that after doing Yoga Shakti for a while, my heart rate doesn't get as high as I would like, though I still love that DVD.  I sought out the sequences in the matrix that I would like from this DVD by viewing each one and making a comparison of what I wanted versus what I didn't; I have since fallen into a regular matrix that is a GREAT workout with many yoga or yoga-like moves, and more arm and back strengthening.  As someone who has done yoga for years, I can't complain when a ""revolutionary"" or ""evolutionary"" approach comes out; I want to continue to use varied, yet healthful and safe, workouts.

I would recommend this DVD to anyone who has much strength and yoga experience to find the flows that work for you and enjoy a renewed muscular and cardiac workout.",1196899200,10,1141,4.288372093023256
2690505,5,B000KGH03E,"I have had a dedicated home practice in yoga since 2003 & a large selection of DVD's to support this effort. Shiva Rea's Fluid Power - Vinyasa Flow Yoga has provided significant variety and growth to my home practice. These sessions are not for the novice, but those experienced in yoga will find value in her detailed sequences and unique approach to this ancient discipline. The beautiful cinematography makes the experience of following her sequences all the more captivating and inspiring. My yoga DVD collection is significant, and by comparison, this DVD is packed with about 200% more content than other discs in its category offer. A treasure trove of ideas and instructions to reference in your quest for a more independent yoga practice. Thank you Shiva for this sublime treat. Namaste.",1196640000,5,796,5.037878787878788
2690506,4,B000KGH03E,"I have many Yoga DVDs and have been practicing Yoga for about 10 years.  Shiva Rea is an unusual teacher, because she strives to go beyond the usual asanas and toward a yoga practice that is kinetic and joyful as well as focused and meditative.  It's a kind of evolutionary yoga, and very interesting theoretically, as well as challenging physically.  She isn't just dancing; she's putting the asanas themselves into motion.

This DVD is absolutely not for beginners, regardless of the ""Beginners"" practice, because if you do not understand basic yoga postures, you are going to have problems executing Rea's variations.  You should also watch the segments all the way through before trying them.  Nonetheless, I would recommend this DVD to anyone who has been doing yoga for awhile and would like to develop in a new direction.  Shiva Rea is extremely creative and a very good teacher; I like this DVD and will add it to my ""core"" set, which includes Rea's Yoga Matrix and Rodney Yee's ""Power Yoga: Total Body"" and ""Total Energy Yoga,"" as well as David Swenson's ""Short Forms, First Series.""",1195171200,7,1092,4.870270270270271
2690507,5,B000KGH03E,"I absolutely love this DVD.  I am very picky when it comes to yoga.  I like a challenge, and I like to feel like I've earned my corpse pose at the end!  This DVD does not fail. You are constantly moving.  The first time through a practice, you may need to stop and watch, but after that, you don't even need to watch her, you can just listen to her with cues for the moves.  I own many yoga DVDs and this is the best one so far.  Shive Rea is amazing.  My own personal goal is to be able to be uber flexible in my back, and as a gymnast in my youth, I am hoping this is attainable.  Her back bending sequence really does a lot for the back and the spine.  I also love the fact that she includes some meditiation in the beginning, but if you don't like this feature, you can fast forward to the good stuff.  Excellent DVD, a must for your yoga library.",1195171200,5,851,3.9529411764705884
2690508,4,B000KGH03E,"Some of the practices start with chanting taken from Kundalini yoga;  it's a little disconcerting if you are avoiding the religious aspects of yoga.  That said, the chanting is a very peaceful, centering way to start a yoga practice.

This isn't a Kundalini practice, though.  It is standard power yoga with variations that are initially really hard to follow because they are unlike anything you may have seen on a yoga video.

This is a very difficult DVD.  It is doable by a beginner who has a fair amount of body awareness, and some knowledge of what exactly is supposed to happen in the basic warrior and downward dog poses.  However, unless you have unbelievable upper body strength, be prepared to do a lot of child's pose (resting on your knees)where the instructor is doing downward dog.

""Difficult"" is not a complaint, exactly:  it's more like an obvious description; this is a really challenging and emotionally meaningful practice;  it will also make you sweat buckets and feel like a total wimp--but in a good way.",1193443200,9,1028,4.822857142857143
2690509,5,B000KGH03E,"I was a Shiva Rea fan before this DVD, and I must say that it is the most engaging, challenging, beautiful yoga DVD I've ever done. The concept of fluidity in every flow, every pose creates endless opportunities for creative expression and I totally agree with something she says in the DVD that when being creative in her flows, she finds that she can go deeper and further into whatever she is doing.
I have only programmed my own flows through the matrix and this matrix is an improvement over the Yoga Shakti matrix because it tells you how long each chosen segment is going to be before you do it. That way if I only have an hour, I choose a practice that allows for that. If I want to do two hours, I can program that too.
The scenery is magnificent, the music engaging and beautiful and Shiva is, as always, amazing and inspiring. My only caution is that I wouldn't consider either of Shiva's DVDs to be for beginners, but then again, I haven't done the preset basic flows on either DVD",1190592000,10,993,4.372972972972973
2690510,1,B000KGH03E,"I was looking forward to a DVD that allowed me to customize a practice, but this isn't yoga. She asks you to inhale when contracting and exhale when expanding making it extremely difficult to focus on the breath. She begins to describe movements when she's already more than halfway into them on screen so you are always slightly behind her. At other times, she describes movements and cuts to the musician leaving you with no idea of what she is describing. She takes regular asanas and renames them. I am very disappointed and wish I had been able to preview it before I wasted the money.",1188691200,44,590,4.5754716981132075
2690511,5,B000KGH03E,"This is a highly unique, fun and effective Yoga program.  I definitely do not consider this a beginner DVD:  I have done yoga (off and on) for ten years and I cannot hang with several of the intermediate workouts.  I think even seasoned yogis will find these challenging and a nice break from the same old ashtanga-based movements.  There are many different sections to choose from that target different areas and you can put your own routines together.  My only gripe is that in her more advanced segments, the asanas can be very hard to follow, because they are so different than traditional yoga asanas.  You really have to watch some of the segments several times first to see exactly what she is doing.  Otherwise, beautifully filmed and very fun to do!",1188604800,6,758,4.696969696969697
2690512,4,B000KGH03E,"Shiva Rea is amazing but this DVD is not for regular practice.  I use it to spice up my daily practices with the moves she offers, but I wouldn't recommend it to a beginner.  For one thing, she rarely offers other levels of moves than the one really complicated one she is doing right now.  Also, the good old sun (and moon) salutations are somewhat obscured by additional dancing, which can be confusing.  It's as if Isadora Duncan was incorporating yoga into her dance.  Not a bad thing, but not really what I want to do everyday.",1188172800,6,532,4.443298969072165
2690513,5,B000KGH03E,"I have to tell you, I have tried about every yoga DVD out there.  From Baron Baptiste, to Bryan Kest & David Swenson.  I've done them all, and I'm a yoga teacher.  So I just had to do a review of Shiva's new DVD.  It's just simply the BEST.  Not only is it what I consider ""true"" yoga, but it's also an amazing workout.  I'll sweat a little with other power yoga DVDs, but with Fluid Power by Shiva, the sweat pours off of me down onto my mat!!  She keeps you constantly moving, and gets your heartrate in your target zone.  So, it's yoga and cardio all in one!!  In fact, I was so impressed with the sweat I was producing, I wore my heartrate monitor to see how many calories I was burning.  Compared with other power yoga DVDs, that only burn about 200 calories an hour, Fluid Power had me burning 300.  That's quite a big difference.

The other things to love about this DVD are the fact that the flows are so beautifully done.  You will move all around your mat in a circular fashion, doing lots of downward dogs, chatarungas & updogs.  Depending on the flow, you'll throw in some warriors, yogic squats, lunges, side angles & triangles too.  It's really a comprehensive program.  And the fact that it comes with several pre-programmed sessions is great, but you can create your own with the yoga matrix.  That's what I love to do, so I can match my practice to my mood.

You've got to buy this!!!  (I love Shiva's Yoga Shakti too, but this one is even better in my humble opinion.)

Namaste, & Happy Yoga to you.",1185235200,38,1517,4.293286219081272
2690563,4,B000KGH03E,"I bought this thinking it was a basic yoga dvd.  It isn't basic but has basic elements in it, I do think it combines Shiva's Trance dance dvd & yoga dvd so you get some dancerly movements mixed in with the yoga... I have been taking it on the road with me & have been doing it in hotel rooms across the country. It really saved me & my friend one night when we woke up at 3am & couldn't sleep so we put on the medition practice & it was fantastic, we both got back to sleep & felt relaxed & rested the next day.  I also like the music she chooses for her dvd's, although the drummer on that big fake rock is kinda distracting, I would have preferred to see more of Shiva than the drummer at times.... This & the Trance dance dvd's have inspired me to also get into NIA, which is a movement, dance, yoga, qigong flow practise! Thank you Shiva, your calming loving flow shines through!!!",1184976000,5,885,4.109826589595376
2690564,5,B000KGH03E,Feel freedom in your body with this amazing dvd. Shiva rea is a master at what she does. Through this dvd you can follow along with set practices or create your own sequence of movements with her yoga matrix. The music and the scenery are exquisite. She does offer modifications for poses which makes it accessible for different body types.,1181520000,4,340,4.683333333333334
2690565,3,B000KGH03E,"I can't decide whether I like this yoga DVD or hate it.  There are some aspects that are desirable, such as the versatility of being able to create new routines with the ""matrix"" feature. Not for beginners, I like that it has advanced positions and the routines aren't slowed down by ""teaching"" how to do poses, because that can get tiresome after the first time.  Also, the music is soothing as well as her voice.  Many times I've tossed a DVD because the voice is annoying (especially after the 50th time).

That said, I find myself rolling my eyes every time she explains things using Sanskrit terms and Asana names (or whatever it's called).  I know yoga is based from it, but I don't care to know the language because it all sounds Greek to me and I have NO IDEA what she's saying!  Also, I've been giving it my best shot at trying to get into the chanting parts, but all I can think of is how stupid it sounds.  Not my style, I guess.

I've been practicing for 5 years now, and have bought many yoga DVD's and I seem to return back to Brian Kest's Power Yoga series because nothing apparently can compare.  I thought I would give it another shot and try this one on for size.  I wouldn't mind the ""flowy"" hippy like dance moves (it does loosen up the body nicely), however some of the moves are confusing and her instructions, even the non-Sanskrit ones, are even more confusing to follow.  I find myself constantly looking back at the TV to see what pose she's doing and that's where I notice many of the camera angles are unclear to see what's going on.  Most of the workout I find myself to be frustrated and annoyed, which is the opposite of what should be happening!

I will still give it a few more tries to see if can warm up to it, but I'm guessing it's back to the tried and true Kest series.",1181088000,12,1807,4.294985250737463
2690566,3,B000KGH03E,"When I first watched this I was very confused. I wasn't sure what this was or what Shiva Rea was trying to accomplish with her trance dance infused yoga routines that are completely foreign to someone use to practicing the typical poses on most DVDs and in most studio classes. After trying it a couple times it did have an interesting energy to it that comes from the improvisational spirit and the release that the muscles experience from the undulating movements through out the vast array of practices that can be created with this DVD. However I found myself dizzy most of the time, struggling to look at the TV screen to see what exactly she was doing since verbal guidance through the poses is not enough in this case. I think this is a good DVD for someone more interested in dance combined with yoga rather than a yoga practice. I find comfort and inspiration in the familiarity of the poses when I practice and this DVD did not have that familiarity, it is uncharted territory which can be more confusing than relaxing- and relaxation is the goal of my practice.",1179619200,16,1072,4.588541666666667

I love the rolling, circular movements, I feel so in tune with the universe, so free when I do this DVD. It also helps with sore muscles and any other physical or emotional pain I happen to have. The fact that you can tailor your own practice is a great bonus. I highly recommend this DVD and I alternate it with Ana Brett and Ravi's DVD's.",1178668800,10,421,4.275
2690568,3,B000KGH03E,"A lot of these reviews say that dancers will love this yoga video.

2690569,5,B000KGH03E,"Shiva gets better and better. My only complaint about this DVD is that there is no shoulderstand sequence, but there are so many wonderful other sequences, who cares? Don't expect a traditional ashtanga-based class, this DVD charts new territory and allows you to focus your practice on specific themes of energy flow, body awareness, etc. The cinematography IS lovely, but you can't see it alot of the time because you will be facing away from the TV. To overcome this, I sometimes indulge myself by sitting back and watching the DVD while eating some cantalope, so as to fully appreciate (and better understand) what Shiva has given us.",1178150400,12,638,4.916666666666667
2690570,5,B000KGH03E,"While all great teachers impart something unique and beautiful to yoga by virtue of how they alone embody it, Shiva Rea is called to do something radical for the evolution of yoga.

Fluid Power captures, more than any of her other DVDs, what her work seems to really be about, which is, dissolving all moldy or rigid conceptions about yoga, and flowing with and rebirthing it anew each moment.

There are many subtle yet powerful evolutions in this DVD compared to previous ones. Working with spirals and free movement, sacred chanting and OMing through the body, Kalari-based (Kalarippayattu, an ancient Indian martial art) movements, and helping us to comprehend and revere the miracle of the body, as in the Fluid Systems meditation.

There is a strong focus on Fluidity, regeneration, and creativity. The DVD shares some miracles about how our bodies function, helping us to understand why movement and breath are so integral to health. (EG: Our vascular system is 50 thousand miles long and could be wrapped around the Earth 2.5 times. And except for the heart, the only pump for our fluid-filled body is that of movement.)

Shiva's energy and strength are so formidable, I find I often prefer a slower or more static pace, to calm and balance the high flowing circular energy. A nice yin practice, or a traditional linear practice, help to keep a nice balance.

Two interviews on the bonus disc are not to be missed: Sally Kempton and Daniel Odier.",1177718400,15,1454,4.870445344129554
2690571,4,B000KGH03E,"From a DVD quality stand point this video is tough to beat.  The camera work is beautiful, the locations are great, and the yoga is top notch.  Shiva found a way to actually improve upon the Yoga Matrix (i.e. you can choose specific yogic segments and practice them in any order you want).  This is a bigger, more stylistic, and better put together DVD than Yoga Shakti.  However, bigger is not always better.  I am not a dancer and I only wanted to practice yoga.  Shiva Rea has some dance and some martial arts aspects to almost all of the practice routines (hence fluid power), that puts me off a little bit.  I tried to get into it, but just couldn't.  That is why I am not going to trash Shiva's DVD, because it is very nice, but just not my taste.  If you want to try something that offers a very different take on yoga, then this DVD is a 5 star production.  If you don't think you will like the dance elements of this DVD then you may want to try her previous DVD Yoga Shakti.",1171411200,88,984,4.1861702127659575
2690572,5,B000KGH03E,"I had this brought down to Jamaica at the same time as ""Yoga Shakti"" and I made no mistake there. It continues the spirit of that DVD, with some wonderful additions.

The whole concept of adding of circular and fluid wave motion took each vinyasa to a whole new level. The sometimes abstract flow was a delightful departure from normal asana movement and i was thrilled at how easily I could release the creativity I have within. I haven't done every sequence combination yet, but already I'm a huge fan of the Mandala Namaskar, the Dancing Warrior and the Mandala variation of Upward Bow (PLEASE, PLEASE, approach these poses with gentle respect for your limitations...these will fall away with precious time)

Ooooh, one thing i preferred with ""Fluid Power"" over ""Yoga Shakti"" was that in the Yoga Matrix (like the best DVD feature EVER!)you can navigate back and forth, up AND down - with ""Yoga Shakti"", I could only go back and forth, which was a little frustrating at times)

Very challenging sequences at times, like the handstand practice, which I'm new to, but see as a great guide as I evolve.

This DVD, even more than ""Yoga Shakti"", is NOT for the neophyte - Shiva explains this in the attached handout (priceless for customising your practice) and again in the introduction Shiva exhorts you to watch the flows at least once  through before you ""dive in"".  Much Sanskrit is used for pose names and the Backbending sequences are quite challenging, from ""the splits"" to Natarajasana or 'cosmic dancer'.  I'm someone who gets bored easily, but i don't think it's possible with this DVD, what with the level of focus needed and the vast possibility of practice combinations, limited only by you, the practitioner.

A beautiful, thoroughly enjoyable way to develop a home practice.

If you have zero flexibility this is not a good yoga dvd to start with. This is definitely for intermediate flexibility. Never push yourself to do as deep a stretch as Shiva Rea is doing. The flexibility she demonstrates only develops with practice and time. Overall there is a lot of focus on creating space and flexibility in the body. The main aesthetic difference in this video compared to other Shiva Rea videos is the inclusion of some new age camera tricks that can be somewhat distracting (to me) but are meant to be artistic.,1495238400,,685,4.488
