8023942,2,B000286RTI,"Midnight Warning (also known as Eyes of Mystery) involves a cover-up sanctioned by the highest level of the Government.  The story opens with two friends exchanging pleasantries in a hotel room.  One is grazed by a bullet that doesn't seem to surprise or concern the hotel staff.  When a burnt ear bone is discovered in the fireplace, the two friends begin to wonder just what kind of establishment this is.  The more they uncover the less they know.  The same hotel room was once occupied by a man who went missing.  To cover-up his disappearance they had his sister committed to a mental facility.  When she is released and tries once again to gain the truth they try once again to gaslight her back into a mental institution.  What could have happened to her brother and why is the Government acting in accordance with the hotel to keep this a secret worth dying over.

MMMM-yeah.  When they finally revealed the BIG secret it proved to be so ridiculous I couldn't help but wonder why anyone thought this would make a great plot for a movie.  And yes, the hotel staff burned a body in the fireplace of that hotel room.  Because that made so much sense.

The transfer is about what you could expect from something made in 1932.  It's lousy but that never bothers me.",1435795200,,1268,4.553097345132743
