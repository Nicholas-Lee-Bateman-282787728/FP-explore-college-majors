8746107,5,B019WMTW6Y,"This is the 3rd dvd in the series that we own, and my 4 year old son loves them so much. The monsters are fun and make learning the letters fun as well. Smaller kids may like the singing in the dvd as well, but I'd recommend this for kids ages 3 and up.",1459468800,,253,3.7037037037037037
8746108,4,B019WMTW6Y,"Even though I am much older than the target audience for this show, I must say that the this DVD excels at introducing letters of the alphabet while making it fun and interesting. Throughout the different episodes and stories, there is letter recognition, spelling and the opportunity to write out each letter. These are just a few of the learning mechanisms contained in this volume.

This particular volume focuses on the letters I, J, K and L. Of course, it is very informative with these letters of the alphabet and, at the same time entertains little ones in this aspect of early language learning. The story revolves around the letters missing. They are nowhere to be found. The family and friends of the people that live in Capital Castle must solve riddles and clues to find these missing letters, one episode at a time.
It has many different bright colors which are visually fun and catch the attention of young viewers. The sing along songs are enjoyable and, at the beginning of every episode, I found myself singing the opening song. I enjoyed the songs and like how they transition from one letter to the next as well. My favorite character is the Princess because she is very optimistic and curious  things I relate to. She just wants to know stuff. My favorite episode is L mostly because I enjoyed the word choices. Each episode leaves you with wanting more and more. One facet of this show that I don't particularly like is the length. Each episode is about 30 minutes which, in my opinion, is a bit too long to focus on one letter and just three words associated with it.

Parents, this is a great tool to help you introduce your preschooler to words and phonics. You can even watch it with them and show how excited you are when they are learning. Learning is exciting and fun and this is a great age to do so.
I recommend this DVD for ages 2 to 5 and give it 3 out of 5 stars due to its length and limited word choice. It is a great learning DVD for preschoolers and Im sure the little ones will truly have fun and enjoy it.
