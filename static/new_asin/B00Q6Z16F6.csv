The blue-ray quality is really great.  I bought it from Amazon Italy even with shipping to the states it was <$50 only difference is there is an Italian sticker on the back of the box and well it took about two weeks to get to CA.

It's impossible to watch this without smiling to yourself and enjoy the cheese that this show was so famous for. Packaging is simple and each season (there are 3) come in its own separate slipcase, all fitting within the exterior box. It looks good and stores easily on the shelf and the  psychedelic 60's artwork on the box makes it stand out a bit. This is a LOT of Batman and it's great to finally see these episodes restored so well after waiting all these years. If you can swing it, buy this collection and enjoy yourself. Younger kids would enjoy it as well and the content is very family friendly.

I great up on the first run shows and when you see them on ME-TV the quality is not very good, but these blurays are great quality transfers and you can't beat the price to get all 3 seasons.

One Final Thing:
The limited edition blu-ray set has collectable packaging with a hot wheels replica of the Batmobile, the Adam West scrapbook, and 44 vintage trading card. Sadly, this will not be included in the dvd set.",1485561600,,6088,4.508196721311475

6859266,5,B00Q6Z16F6,"Finally! Adam West's version of Batman in all it's High Definition glory! The colors of all the costumed villains literally pop off the screen. All this and Julie Newmar in her skin tight catsuit! A little on the pricey side for the Blu ray, but oh so worth it! The only slight criticism I have is of the packaging. I wish they would've put each disc it's own section in the packing, which they DO with the season one set, which comes on three discs. The season two set contains six discs in a fold-out booklet type of packaging, in which discs one and two have their own sections, but discs three, four, five and six are sandwiched atop each other in sections of two, with the top disc in each section snapping inward and held in place by a groove in the bottom of the clear plastic disc retainer. The first disc in the section snaps in via the center groove, but there is no groove to hold the top disc in the section. What you CAREFULLY have to do is slip the bottom of the disc into the groove and GENTLY push each side of the disc into the plastic grooves. It's not the best packaging that's for sure, so you really have to be careful when either taking the top disc out or replacing it. Other than that, there are really no complaints regarding the quality or content. If you enjoyed all the zany campiness of this 60's series, you must get this set. And I say it's about time!",1470787200,5,1383,4.262357414448669

8690628,5,B00Q6Z16F6,"As a kid growing up in the 70s, I would rush home from school to try to watch this show. Now with the Blue Ray version, it looks great and you can watch the episodes in the order in which they were first broadcast. I do wish the case held the Blue Ray disks a bit more since they have a tendency to slide in the case but this is just a minor annoyance.",1527379200,,352,3.77027027027027
8690629,4,B00Q6Z16F6,"I don't really know how to rate this product. On the one hand, I love Batman, but on the other, I find the Adam West Batman era to be too cringy for my liking. That being said, it's kind of like a car wreck that I can't look away from.

I actually didn't buy this, my 13 year old son did - with his own money, no less. I kept asking him - are you SURE you want to spend your money on this? He loves the modern Batman comics, and I repeatedly told him that he would find exactly zero similarities between this TV show and the writings of Scott Snyder and Tom King. But for some reason, he loves it. He giggles and smiles nonstop, even as he covers his face with a pillow at particularly cringy lines. I must say, he is definitely getting his money's worth out of this series.",1525132800,,774,4.025974025974026

8690633,5,B00Q6Z16F6,We watch this on TV every Saturday night with our little boy.  We love it!  Not full of special effects and unbelievable stunts of today's action shows.  Just plain fun.  Plus we love seeing all of the special guests.  Bought as a surprise for boyfriend for his birthday.,1520208000,2,271,4.5625
