It's about a guy trying to do anything he can to hang out with this girl on his college team.  He's so wound up in her that he himself gets kicked off the mens team and ends up posing as a woman just to be next to her.  This movie has comedy, drama, sports, and love.  That's everything you could ask for in a movie.  This is definitely one to buy if you like tennis and you like cheesy movies.  It's my favorite movie ever, I can quote it line for line!",1009756800,2,595,3.8278688524590163

7831200,5,6302745314,A lot of funny ones liners.  I was surprised that it was so LGBT positive for the 1990's.  Lite fare to be sure but enjoyable.  The lessons on how to act like a woman are pretty funny.,1393113600,2,184,3.918918918918919

Chad Lowe is so cute and funny.  I thought it was going to turn out to be low budget and stupid but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  If you like to laugh, buy this movie!",1010361600,,333,3.925373134328358
