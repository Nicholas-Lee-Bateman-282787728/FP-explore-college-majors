8023123,1,B00027BQCW,"The Abbott and Costello TV Show was a gem ... even though Bud and Lou were near the end of their careers ... they were still top notch. The ONLY gripe I have with these volumes is that someone is really GOUGING .... the typical TV show is being sold on DVD these days at about $25-$45 a season (20 half-hour episodes, approximately). This is 4 episodes for about $17-20 or so .... way over priced. It should have been all episodes of SEASON ONE for about $35 ... a pity. I would have owned ALL of the Bud and Lou TV shows, GLADLY, if someone somewhere did not seek excessive profits. DON'T buy this Volume or any of the rest in the series ... you will only be encouraging these idiots. Wait until the prices come down to REASON !",1148688000,4,729,4.177304964539007
8023124,1,B00027BQCW,"Bud & Lou, though a bit older, can still deliver, with many of their classic routines from radio and film performed on the small screen.  In Volume 12 from their television show, we see them perform the classic ""Candle Routine"", on the show entitled-""The Haunted House""; and it's still funny!  Many of the characters from their radio show turn up and I think Joe Besser is funnier with A&C, then when he was with The Three Stooges.  You also get to look at the lovely Hillary Brooke; very easy on the eyes.  All and all, I really enjoyed the volume I purchased.",1140825600,,561,4.470588235294118
