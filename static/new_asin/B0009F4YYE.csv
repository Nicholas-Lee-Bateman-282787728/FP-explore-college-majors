No mention of Korea at all. There are a few short news clips of inconsequential events related to the war and 1 entertaining bit of pro-US propaganda where an alleged reporter describes the destruction of Seoul by mindless deranged communists. Altogether, this DVD does not contain enough content to be sold on its own.

During the current conflict much is made about comparissons with the fight in Vietnam during the 1960s and early 1970s. What is almost never mentioned is our fight in Korea 10 years beforehand.

Yet, the Korean Conflict is probably a much better analogy for what is going on today than Vietnam ever was.

After the end of World War II we needed to keep the American economy going  but suddenly there was nothing for our war based factories to make. So, we found an excuse to make a new conflict, this time in the far east.

Korea, like the fight today, was a war of choice that we thought would be an easy fight, but kept going on much longer than we could have expected.

The films on this disk give a great overview of the conflict and are essential to any true understanding of history. You get to see what we thought we were fighting for while also getting a perspective on how the war itself was being marketed back in teh homeland.

I reccomend this disk highly to anyone who is interested in the politics of our current conflict or wants to see how the way we interact with the world today was shaped by our policies in our history.",1162857600,,1330,4.317269076305221
8059978,5,B0009F4YYE,"I'm not sure why they decided to put the phrase ""Korea Goes To War"" on the front box of this DVD, since it's really about America going to war in Korea, but that's my only complaint about this product and I think that's a minor complaint. There are many, many newsreals on here that take you from the start of the conflict, into the heart of the war and then end with the peace negotiations. It shows you how very different Korea was than Vietnam - which many people seem to forget these days. This was teh last war america was really proud of and I'm glad I got the chance to learn more about it.",1148256000,5,597,4.155172413793103
