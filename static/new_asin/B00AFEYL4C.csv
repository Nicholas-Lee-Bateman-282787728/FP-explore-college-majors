8550867,5,B00AFEYL4C,"In the 30s Hollywood studios began offering double feature programs, an A film followed by a budget  or B film, offering depression customers more entertainment for the hard-earned price of a ticket. B films used older actors, possibly on the way down, and new actors on the way up. This practice continued up to the early 60s, slowly being replaced by high production costs and television. I the 50s in rural areas and small towns, the B film would sometimes stand alone. Theaters would change programs 3 times a week: Fri-Sat for children and families, Sun-Tue for new studio releases and Wed-Thur for studio B films, usually black and white and running 70-90 minutes.
BLACK GOLD(Warner Bros. 1962) was one of the last of the major studio B films that I saw in a walk-in theater.
The 4 leads are Philip Carey, hero; Claude Akins, villain; James Best, friend; and Diane McBain; girl in distress. Like a good B movie, it has good production values, good photography and direction, and good acting, B level acting. The last is not meant as a criticism. Carey, Akins, and Best had been around since the early 50s, working mostly in B films with occasional supporting roles in A films. All 3 did have starring roles on television. My respect for cinema will not allow me to state the TV show that made Best a star. McBain was promoted by Warner Bros. but did not achieve major stardom.
BLACK GOLD was a film I never forgot but never saw again until this year on a fine transfer on DVD by WARNER ARCHIVE with excellent service from AMAZON and STANDING OVATION. If you rember B movies with affection or want to see one, watch BLACK GOLD.
