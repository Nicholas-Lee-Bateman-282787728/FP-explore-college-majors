5079676,1,B007EQQ62E,I was looking for a better documentary . This one isn't worth your money or time !!! Do NOT BUY THIS,1357430400,2,100,3.8095238095238093
5079677,1,B007EQQ62E,"You can find out much more about Selena's life and discography from Wikipedia (not to mention other web sites) than from this DVD. A few no-name teenagers are interviewed but there is no interview with Selena. This DVD has no music and no music videos of Selena Gomez. Video and sound quality is amateurish, at best; sound level fluctuates from quiet to loud. I make better quality videos with my $200 HD camera and Windows Movie Maker. It's not so much a waste of money to buy this DVD (it is cheap), but it is a waste of your time waiting for the DVD to arrive in the mail and waste of time watching it. My recommendation: read about Selena on Wikipedia, download her music videos and other clips from YouTube (for free and many in high definition) and forget about this DVD.",1340064000,8,777,4.440559440559441
5079678,4,B007EQQ62E,"This is a really good movie about Selena. Since I am a Selenator, I knew most of it already. But it was fun to watch it. I just wish there was more actual interviews with Sel. I wasn't sure if it would be good or not since it is an unauthorized biography. But it was well done and the information was accurate.",1338854400,3,310,4.016129032258065
5079679,1,B007EQQ62E,"Don't waste your time. Bad voice over and pathetic ""history"" of Selena by clueless teenage girls. A waste of money.",1338422400,4,115,4.8
5079680,1,B007EQQ62E,"A really poorly produced film. Looks and feels like a home movie. Plus, it's unauthorized, so it's difficult to trust the authenticity of it.",1388966400,3,141,4.916666666666667
5079681,3,B007EQQ62E,this was completely for my child . She wanted to view this and I had no problem she was happy.,1383091200,,94,3.75
5079682,1,B007EQQ62E,Very poor quality a 6th grader could make that. I am not even a very big Selena fan but I knew all this stuff. Don't waste your money on this!,1369526400,3,142,3.7666666666666666
5079683,1,B007EQQ62E,"I watched this for free with Amazon Prime. I do not recommend spending hard-earned money on this.

General information about Selena Gomez is provided in this documentary via narration interspersed with commentary from teenage fans. If you are a fan of Selena Gomez, I think you would find that the documentary really does not tell you anything new about her. It gives you the kind of details you could find for yourself simply by searching the Internet. To make matters worse, much of the information is repeated. The narrator will tell you something, and then one (or more) of the teenagers will tell you the same thing.

The documentary also is very poorly edited. It includes low-quality, video-only clips of Selena Gomez. Some of the video actually is nothing more than a recording of someone's television playing a Selena Gomez show. If you were hoping to hear an interview with her or to hear one of her songs, you won't. If you enjoy documentaries where the clip being shown matches the topic being discussed, this documentary does not have that either. If you want the volume to remain constant throughout the duration of your programming, you are out of luck on that as well.",1369526400,12,1184,4.799019607843137
5079684,3,B007EQQ62E,"It was just okay, not a really good documentary about Selena Gomez. It did not even have any of her music in it, only clips about what her life was like and how she got her start in show business. I could not strongly recommend this show to anyone.",1368662400,,248,4.081632653061225
5079685,4,B007EQQ62E,It was good. My 6th grader is a fan of her and enjoyed the music video. It was fun and enjoyable.,1367625600,,97,3.6666666666666665
5079686,1,B007EQQ62E,It was a compliation of a bunch of young people saying basically the same thing that the last young person said about Selena Gomez.  Plus it was old.  I saw a much better documentary on her on the E network that had more info.  It's like they just copied the first half hour of that show over & over again,1366848000,3,305,4.05
5079687,1,B007EQQ62E,"it doesnt seem like a real documentary.too much talking to other people and not talking to Selena at all,weird ikr",1363737600,,114,4.75
5079688,1,B007EQQ62E,It was amazing how badly made this was. I can't think of any aspect of this that was done well. Don't waste your time on it.,1361577600,2,124,3.8076923076923075
5079689,1,B007EQQ62E,"Some interesting facts, but the whole production is just voice over dead videos of Selena. The whole thing looks like a production for a Sixth Grade video assignment. Sorry!",1361145600,3,173,5.0

8515390,2,B007EQQ62E,It was fine as an independent teen film. It was more of what a fan knows about Selena... I thought it was more bio,1465776000,,114,3.7916666666666665
8515391,3,B007EQQ62E,"I only bought this because I wanted to grow my Selena collection but when I watched it, I noticed it had a lot of incorrect information about her",1464134400,,145,4.214285714285714

8515396,1,B007EQQ62E,One of the biggest wastes of my time ever. It was like she got a bunch of her friends to tell the world she was great.  I wish I could unsee it.,1410307200,2,144,3.5

8515398,4,B007EQQ62E,"My nine-year-old daughter really enjoyed reading this book. She loves Selena Gomez. The book gave basic facts about Selena, her growing up, and how she started. She just wished the book went a little more into detail. But she really enjoyed reading the book.",1389830400,,258,4.886363636363637
