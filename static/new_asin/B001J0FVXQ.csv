3650377,5,B001J0FVXQ,"This movie is awesome, and to know that my b/f lives on this island makes it a smash hit. Being a native of Maine and knowing that this can happen to anyone, and that the lobstering industry can be a cut throat business. Nicely portrayed that the flim was well done.",1306972800,,266,4.235294117647059
3650378,4,B001J0FVXQ,"Dark, but fairly accurate - I live near a spot that is a true Maine fishing village, and there are quiet, and not-so-quiet, lobster wars.  It's a tough way to make a living, and this movie really does capture it.  That being said, there is a comraderie that is portrayed in this film that really exists - they do take care of each other.",1267228800,3,337,4.25
3650379,5,B001J0FVXQ,"I have to say this movie hit home. I am from the coast of Maine and my grandfather was a lobsterman. His father, my great grandfather, was a boat builder and was the Harbor Master at the pier in Kittery Point Maine for years. Everything about this film reminds me of growing up and the way life was for me and for most of my family members. There was one scene that was filmed in what looked like a shop where boats were built that reminded me so much of my great grandfather when he was alive working in his shop. During that scene, Baker was working on one of his boats when Hildreth starting talking to him about building boats verses fishing. This part was done perfectly as they both seemed to take their time, conversing with each other.  I could almost smell the wood shavings on the floor.
I've been to Vinalhaven three times so far. The last time was this month and that is where I purchased this film. I watched it while in the hotel.
I will continue to recommend this movie to my friends and as far as my family is concerned...well they might just get a copy for Christmas!
I hope others get a chance to see this as I am sure they would not be let down. It was refreshing! I didn't want to go back to CT after I watched it. It made me homesick!",1256515200,5,1255,4.1646090534979425
3650380,4,B001J0FVXQ,"ISLANDER is a powerful ""sleeper"" film yet to be discovered by the viewing public; but I believe it will be. It is well-written, well-directed, and powerfully-acted. It offers insight into the offshore, island fishing culture of the northesat coast, particularly the Maine lobster fishery. One-family, one-boat lobster fishing defines much of the Maine orientation toward self sufficiency, pride, and justice. This in not a warm & fuzzy feel-good film. It's down to the bone, gritty, memorable, and worth seeing.",1249084800,3,511,5.481012658227848
3650381,5,B001J0FVXQ,"Being from the coast of Maine not far from Rockland actually,I found the movie Islander not only entertaining but pretty accurate in its depiction of Coastal Maine and Maine Island life in general.  I liked it enough to purchase a total of three of them. One for my son in the D.R. and one for my daughter who is involved in the seafood industry.  I also purchased one for myself which I have already watched several times.  I recommend this film to anyone who has a fondness for the Coast and Islands of Maine.  The acting is real not overly dramatized.  YA GOTTA LOVE THAT MAINE ACCENT!!",1240790400,12,589,4.4672897196261685
3650382,3,B001J0FVXQ,"Average at best.
It has a fairly decent theme but I wouldn't have watched it if I knew then what I know now.
Slow moving, small cast, more of a TV movie when nothing else is on.",1432339200,,177,3.810810810810811

3650387,5,B001J0FVXQ,"I gave this movie 5 stars because I thought it was well done, the scenery was beautiful and I can relate to the main character. While I'm not a fisherman and live on the West coast, it still hit home. A movie about a guy who makes a mistake, pays for it and tries to rebuild his life. Yes, similar stories have previously been told but this one really hit home for many reasons. And the song at the end: Start Over by Ian McCrudden hits home as well and describes my life for the past 3 years. I purchased the song and have written out the lyrics as best I could.",1419638400,,563,4.035714285714286

3650397,3,B001J0FVXQ,"I enjoyed the film, I certainly don't think that it rates any more than 3 stars though. Filming of  the Maine coastal and island scenery was well done, I found my self watching for places that I had visited. The independent spirit of the Maine Islanders was well brought out in the film. However, It was very predictable. You could almost tell what the ending of the film was going to be after the ""deed"" was done. It could only have had one outcome due to the individual and self-suppporting attitude of the islanders.",1414540800,,519,4.5212765957446805
3650398,5,B001J0FVXQ,"One of the best movies I've ever seen, filmed in a most beautiful place. The acting was 5 stars. I was drawn in from the first 20 minutes of this film and riveted for the rest of it. What a great story, superb acting that made me forget, at times, that I wasn't watching a documentary. Really, really moving story. Kudos to all who were involved in the making of this moving story of emotion, deserved punishment and then...redemption.",1413936000,,435,4.518987341772152
