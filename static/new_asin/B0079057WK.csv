5063715,5,B0079057WK,"Misfits, usually referred to as the British version of Heroes, had to almost start from scratch with this fourth series.  Only Curtis remains from the original crew, so we have a mostly new cast.  I almost didn't bother watching it-I just did not have the energy to start from the beginning again with a new story-arch.  Fortunately there was no real attempt to top the interconnected story from series 1-3, so we are just left with a brilliant series where each episode stands alone.

The show seems to slightly shift the focus away from the team's powers.  Rudy is still here with his twin, but many episodes go by without that being mentioned.  The new crew consist of Jess and Finn.  Jess has a minor x-ray power and Finn can move objects with his mind.  Just.  These aspects are really downplayed though.

This shift away from the superhero powers really was a great idea.  This season of the show is hilarious.  Rudy in particular is great.  The show is also a lot ruder than before, and it wasn't exactly tame in series 1-3.  The show certainly isn't for the faint-hearted.  Rudy gets most of the attention, but Finn can crop up with some great lines.  One conversation with a man he thinks is his Dad is brilliant.

I actually think this is my favorite series of the show to date, but it didn't get strong ratings and I have my doubts about whether we will see a series 5.  It would be a shame if we don't.  Misfits deserves a lot more attention than it gets and should really be classified as a comedy and not as sci-fi or fantasy.

Off the wall mix of different genres - like Buffy the Vampire Slayer but a lot more adult oriented.

5063724,4,B0079057WK,"the show didn't seem promising at first with the originals gone but curtis's character arc drew me back in along with rudys friendships with the new gang. trust me, stick it out for season 5 because that's when they get back to the proper feel.",1404259200,,244,4.444444444444445
5063725,2,B0079057WK,"The show is focused on a small group of people that get ""powers"" from a storm, the powers often suck and the characters really don't find useful ways to utilize them; mostly they get into trouble with other people who have powers and death, drama, and comedy ensue.
Misfits was novel, interesting, and a bit over the top but you just wanted to see where it was going. At the end of season 3 all but one of the original characters were gone and then season 4 got rid of Curtis. The new characters just didn't work for me at all, it's good to see some people liked the transition but for me it felt like the writers had no real direction and were just seeing how far they could go with offensive behavior (for no purpose) linked with brutal murders. Shame, I would have really liked to see all of the original characters developed a lot more and to watch them find unique ways to use their powers, either for pleasure, financial gain, or to help other people or just themselves.",1391644800,,976,4.368131868131868
5063726,3,B0079057WK,"Once Curtis is gone, the show just goes downhill fast.  The only saving grace would be Finn, who actually grows on you.  I'm not too big on Rudy, because he doesn't care about anyone.  Or is that Rudy 2?  And his character is inconsistent (Example: He finds out something about God in the last episode of Season 3, and proceeds to do ""some things"" to someone in his usual way as a result.  Yet, in Season 5, he's suddenly the most religious person on the show.)  He's entertaining, but I felt he was just a substitute for Nathan.  The Misfits' powers aren't even used that much in this season, which defeats the premise of the show, and the so-called arc of this season is just too silly even for this show.  ""Someone is missing something because it was stolen"" is all I will say.",1390521600,,780,4.368055555555555
5063727,5,B0079057WK,Love this series and was sad to see the main characters leave and bring new ones in. Then it got cancelled :( Season 1-3 are the best. After that its sucky.,1389571200,,156,4.064516129032258
5063728,1,B0079057WK,"With a majority of the original cast gone, the show just doesn't have the same feel for me. Curtis and Rudy is what makes me come back, but ultimately, the show isn't the same and not as funny. I feel as if their still trying to figure this group out and their dynamic together.",1386806400,4,278,4.166666666666667
