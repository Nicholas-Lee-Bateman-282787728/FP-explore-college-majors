8538962,5,B0072JBD76,"I use this workout video all the time. Starts out very easy for beginners and advances to more difficult routines. I like the combination of cardio, bodyweight exercises, and yoga. It's a little corny production-wise, but IMO all workout videos are! I highly recommend this as the only pieces of equipment you will need is a yoga mat and a resistance band.

Although I am a gym-rat, this would still be good for beginners because there is no tough choreography or complex movements. Simple, basic, effective training techniques that anyone can do. 5 stars.",1385769600,2,556,4.914893617021277
8538963,5,B0072JBD76,The first video maybe short but it would sore your muscles. If you want to get in shape get this video set.,1347926400,2,107,3.909090909090909
8538964,5,B0072JBD76,When I started SGT. Ken's video I weighed about 230 pounds and I thought I looked good for a six foot one guy.  I did a lot of weight lifting but I never did any cardio. I knew I was going in the wrong direction when I started to buy size 38 jeans so decided to give the Start Fitness videos a try. It kicked my butt and I thought I would never make it to the third video but I stuck with it and now I am in good shape again.  I now weigh 205 pounds and I think I will go for 195. My pushups are just as good as they were when I went to basic training in the army when I was a teenager. It works!,1330560000,4,596,3.576923076923077
