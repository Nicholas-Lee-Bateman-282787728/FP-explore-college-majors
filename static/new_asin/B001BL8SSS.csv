8283471,5,B001BL8SSS,"Our Mr Sun is a classic of the Bell series. Our friend the Sun is a cute animated guy who interacts with the learned Dr. Frank Baxter and sidekick Eddie Albert. Learn about fusion, photosynthesis, solar energy, and more through various examples and clever animation. The classic Moon shorts includes Weigh Station in Space- which is a good explanation of how a space station might work, it's cool and retro. There are shorts about the Moon missions which were possibly the United States best accomplishment. Fascinating stuff!",1251158400,,526,5.057471264367816
8283472,5,B001BL8SSS,"Now you can have both! This collection of shorts about the moon are great history and information. You'll relive America's proudest moment, -the Apollo 11 moon landing. Also there's a short on the famously jinxed flight of Apollo 13. There's also a 1950's view of what a space station might look like, fascinating. Included is the classic silent short movie by Melies, -A Trip to the Moon-!
  Then there's -Our Mr Sun-, a classic of the Bell Science series directed by none other than the great Frank Capra. It's an informative and whimsical special about the Sun. There's some nice animation, the wonderful Dr Frank Baxter as the narrator, and also Eddie Albert of -Green Acres- fame! Learning was never so fun!",1214352000,3,712,4.827868852459017
