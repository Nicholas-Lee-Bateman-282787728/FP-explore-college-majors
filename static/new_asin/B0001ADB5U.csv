1984312,5,B0001ADB5U,"Superior police detective drama--it doesn't get better than this!!  I watched every episode of this series as it came out and recently rented the whole series and watched it from beginning to end. It is enthralling and mesmerizing--I never get tired of it.

I particularly like that Prime Suspect 5 is set in Manchester--great accents!  Too bad they don't do subtitles--it takes a little time to get used to.",1142553600,11,408,4.884057971014493
1984313,5,B0001ADB5U,"This is perhaps the best police series of its kind (perhaps a bit too realistic for some).Having been demoted,Jane takes a while to get her feet under her.

She has to assess her underlings,uncover a police informer,and deal with a ruthless street gang leader.

I've viewed PS 1,2,4,5. You don't easily forget any of them.",1117670400,6,322,4.836363636363636
1984314,5,B0001ADB5U,"I remember watching Prime Suspect 5: Errors Of Judgement when it was shown on PBS. Nothing was on television at the time and I was scanning different channels. I started watching the miniseries in the midst of the first episode. After the first ten minutes I was hooked! I even watched it again when PBS decided to repeat it!!Helen Mirren is amazing as Detective Jane Tennison! In this outing Tennison is demoted and starts working in Manchester. As soon as Tennison gets back on duty she recieves an assignment: a murder. I don't want to go into too many details. There are a few twists and turns and suspense moments. You will even keep guessing at the end. We even still get to see more of Jane's personal life. The standout performance in this set goes to Steven Mackintosh hands down!! Everytime he's on screen your eyes will stay on him. He's so despicable, cocky, and clever but likable at the same time.",1096243200,13,911,4.595092024539877

1984323,2,B0001ADB5U,"Ugh. So disappointing! I usually love Prime Suspect, but Season 5 is terrible. It's appalling how stupid and weak Tennison is in this season. And, that horrible, intrusive soundtrack - so trying to create a noir feeling, but it was just irritating. I was waiting for someone to say, ""It's Chinatown,"" it was trying so hard to be something it's not.",1477958400,,348,4.721311475409836

1984373,5,B0001ADB5U,"Excellent balance between the police story and the personal elements, with the crime always being paramount, and even a valid reason for some of the personal contacts (outsider who is an expert or has expertize in a needed area is also a lover or former lover of Tenneyson).  Unlike some current shows, the personal stories are included only to the extent that they humanize the hard-headed detective rather than overpowering the issues of solving the crime.  Having lived in England on several occasions, I find the settings, dialogue and plotting to be ""spot on"".  My only criticism, if any, would be that the speech or dialect of some primary characters is often difficult for the American ear to interpret.",1407369600,,710,4.949579831932773

1984376,5,B0001ADB5U,"This continued to be a series that please my wife and I. It is for an  MA showing. The writing is very well done and pulls you into the program. You can feel the action taken place. WE will regret when we reach season 7. Helen Mirren is one very , fine and talented actress. She makes you feel what it was like for a Women to come up from the ranks. I was sorry to see Season seven come. When compared to other shows of this type; DCI Banks, Inspector Morse, George Gentley and so many others that we follow we felt this rated a very high 9 out of 10. Why not a 10? Because you ended the show, however Season 7 was done in great style. DCI Banks did seem to help move a women up the ranks; sort of!  Thank you.

I also like the fact that the lead detective, Jane Tennison, is a woman and unlike most men detectives, she shows her vulnerable side as well as being crusty and demanding and very tough.  Its  fun to think I can solve the crime, but the stories are so well written that its likely the viewer will be wrong most of the time and I love that ""aha"" moment when the truth comes out.

She understands this role so well and watching her evolve over the years as she attempts to navigate the politics, the suspects, her superiors and her colleagues has been just as dynamic as the story lines.  If you appreciate great acting, good drama/suspense, and good detective stories watch these.  You won't be able to stop.  It is not the fast wrap up of Law and Order which I love.

1984429,3,B0001ADB5U,"Series 5 of Prime Suspect is a bit of a departure from the previous entries in the show.  In this incarnation, Tennison has been transferred to the relative ""peace and quiet"" of Manchester, putting her under a new boss, with a new team, and far, far away from any high-profile murder investigations.  And while her new boss seems far more accommodating to a female DCI than her previous ones, her team doesn't seem to have much respect for her, at least at first (what else is new?).

After the political fallout from the previous series, Tennison is mostly doing community outreach by giving talks at local schools - a duty which she really does not enjoy.  She begs her new boss, DCS Ballinger, to give her something more exciting, so he lets her handle a just-reported shooting/murder that is actually still in progress.  Once Tennison arrives on the scene, she gets a crash course in the fact that her new team of investigators aren't quite as sharp as she'd like them to be, and that her new stomping ground of Manchester is in far worse shape than she previously believed.  The city is run-down, impoverished, and doesn't trust the police one bit.  In fact, as an armed tactical squad enters the slum apartment building where the murder took place to apprehend the armed and injured suspect, the residents are doing their best to fight them off.  And when the arrival of the local Drug Kingpin occurs, Jane is shocked to see the people cheering him on in his efforts to diffuse the tense situation as opposed to the police.

The Drug Kingpin, known as ""The Street"" (which is one of the worst nicknames ever.  I mean, I know it was 1996, but still, no excuse) instantly gets on Tennison's nerves with his bravado and superior attitude, and she immediately locks on to him as having something to do with the murder and shooting that occurred.  However, she quickly finds that the combination of ""less than stellar"" police investigators in her squad, and the ""we don't talk to police"" attitude of the locals, is making this investigation much more difficult than it should be.

As Tennison presses the investigation, she quickly finds that there's more to this story than a simple murder.  It seems that The Street is always one step ahead of her, which leads her to believe someone on her team might be leaking him information.  She also begins to discover a much larger conspiracy between Manchester's crime bosses and the police station, which is further hindered by the resistance from members of her team and complications from a romantic relationship she enters into with the married Ballinger.

I personally did not enjoy this series as much as previous ones.  Though Tennison is always fun to watch as she overcomes all odds, I felt as though the bad guy and ""conspiracy"" storyline here were too over-the-top to be enjoyable.  The Street is played extremely obnoxiously by Steven Mackintosh (and I know he can play subtle from his role in Luther).  He comes off as a British version of Mackelmore with the attitude of Kanye West.  Though he's a formidable opponent for Tennison, all the previous ""Prime Suspects"" in the series have been relatable and realistic.  The Street was almost cartoonish in contrast.  In a way, he felt more like a Bond Villain than a ""Prime Suspect.""

I also felt that the ending was just way, way, way over the top.  The entire showdown was very contrived.  I could go one for quite a while about all the things I felt stupid and unrealistic about the ending of Series 5, but the biggest of which was Tennison going into an abandoned building in pursuit of a dangerous and armed criminal without waiting for backup or bothering to take the time to try and contact her team.  Oh yeah, and she does all this without a weapon. How she planned to single-handedly rescue a hostage from an armed killer without a gun is beyond me, but British Cops are a special breed of kung-fu bad ass I guess.  Regardless, though the ending was certainly tense and we finally get the big reveal about the ""conspiracy,"" the way it was done was just so poor, it made it difficult to enjoy.  Previous seasons were all about the showdown of wills between Tennison and her Prime Suspect - could she break them and punish them for their crimes?  This ending was more of an action scene and did not keep with the climaxes of the previous series.

That's not to say Series 5 isn't enjoyable.  It just pales in comparison to the previous installments.  I still enjoyed myself, even though I felt like I had to slog through a lot of the scenes with The Street in them.

If you're a fan of the show, then you could go ahead and watch this one.  But if I had to skip any of the Prime Suspect series, it would be this one.  I just feel other series have far better mysteries and more realistic policework (not to mention better villains) than this one.",1389139200,,4857,4.6158323632130385
1984430,3,B0001ADB5U,"I was annoyed watching this. Way too many TV-plot cliches in the writing...the overly villianous villain (he kills dogs? Really? Not puppies or kittens?), the Snidely Whiplash ""toying with the victim"" to give the police time to get there, and even The Fargo Mistake...having a supposedly sensible, hard-boiled, and by-the-book detective ""go in alone""--unarmed, even--against all good judgement, for the sake of dramatic climax. Maybe ""The Wire"" has spoiled me for even well-done police procedurals. But I think several of the others in the series are much better-written than this one.",1389052800,,585,5.43956043956044

1984460,4,B0001ADB5U,"""Prime Suspect 5"" could be seen in some ways as a British version of ""the Departed"" in that Helen Mirren's Jane Tennison is hunting a criminal who seems to have evaded the law for years with an uncanny degree of success.  This character goes by the nickname ""the Street"" and he manages to get under Tennison's skin probably more than any of the criminals she's faced.  The setting is intriguing, inner city Manchester in neighborhoods where drug gangs rule the roost more than the police could ever hope to.

To me, the story was compelling right up to the ending and then unraveled some...

<spoilers>

1.  The actions of ""the Street"" at the very end would make no sense in the real world and seem entirely designed to make for a rather phony scene where he finally gets his just desserts.

2.  Just when we are given to believe that Tennison is about to be killed by the Street, a police SWAT team magically appears and kills him...never mind the extreme unlikelihood they would have found the place where he and she were confronting each other.

3.  Tennison leads too much from the front in this story, doing a number of things I'm almost certain an officer of her high rank would delegate....

<end spoilers>

But if you can grit your teeth and consciously set aside the rather cheesy ending to this installment of Prime Suspect, it is definitely watchable and entertaining ... although not quite packing the same emotional wallop of the preceding four installments.

The only disappointment I have is my own fault, buying one and not being at all happy with it.  However, we can't know that before opening it and playing it -- in this case, a DVD -- therefore, we cannot return it.

My books have always been extraordinary and I am very happy with the pricing and shipping.  Congratulations, Amazon !!",1267833600,,462,4.597560975609756
1984483,5,B0001ADB5U,"This 5th in the Prime Suspect series is, to me, the best of them all. The action is gripping and tightly-woven, with the ethical conflicts plaguing a police department a tense secondary theme. Interwoven are the private lives of Jane Tennison and her colleagues.  The primary actors are superb, with the incomparable Helen Mirren in the lead.
Anyone enjoying the Prime Suspect series, and British mystery dramas in general, will find this a must.",1255564800,,446,5.027027027027027
1984484,2,B0001ADB5U,"I have been watching these shows for the last month and have thoroughly enjoyed all of them, until I saw 5. This is the worst writing of any of them so far with major overacting by the bad guy, completely unrealistic really. All of the gritty realism has been stripped away and replaced with soap opera antics. The writers have also turned Helen Mirren's character into a total dunderhead. What she does at the end is beyond words. It's as if the writers or producers decided to model the show after Murder She Wrote or Matlock or even Columbo. Her character is so much smarter than that and deserves better. Nobody with her level of experience and intelligence would behave so stupidly or put her life at such risk. Even the case is uninteresting. Everyone who watched it with me felt no compassion for the victims or anyone involved for that matter. Usually we are all transfixed from beginning to end. Also, the Manchester accents become hard to decipher at times and in the case of the bad guy, extremely annoying. I certainly hope that 6 and 7 are better than 5 and go back to the quality storytelling that made 1 through 4 so good.",1242000000,13,1137,4.524271844660194

1984487,4,B0001ADB5U,"I have seen this episode twice and never tire of the
story or the  acting..the characterizations are nothing
short of brilliant starting of course with dame helen
mirren..there have been few actresses of this calibre
in the british cinema for ages..the supporting cast are
equally believable and moreso in some cases..e.g. the
black boy Michael did a magnificent job as the criminal
he was portraying.  Andlast but not least Daniel Mackintosh was superb as the pyschopathic killer, the
Street..he has quite an acting history for one reasonably
young..one noteaable contrast was his protrayal of the
very young and bewildered pilot in Memphis Belle.",1194825600,,648,5.281553398058253
1984488,5,B0001ADB5U,"I originally watched the series 5 episodes while in London on the BBC. I was enthralled by the depth of the characters and the real life portrayal of the events. Helen Mirren is in a class by herself. ""The Street"" is one of the best ""bad guys"" ever created, cocky, bold and brutal. This series may be too realistic for some, it can be a little disturbing at times. Best cop series I have ever seen.",1186531200,4,398,4.25

1984491,5,B0001ADB5U,"As in every film she appears in, Helen Mirren takes my breath away in Prime Suspect 5. It's impossible to take your eyes off her when she's on screen, and I can watch her movies endlessly and always find new depth in her characterizations. This entry in the series is just as good as 1,2,3,6 and 7 (4 was still good, but broken up into shorter stories, so for me not as impactful). Mirren is divine, and as much as I love all her performances, her embodiment of the complex, lonely and deeply ethical Tennison will always be my favorite.",1172793600,20,537,4.38

Both the misses and I had to stop watching because it was just so painful. The turtle pace of the show and the poor acting. (or maybe its the writing) But out of all of the British TV we've watched so far (and we've watched alot) this one is the worst yet.",1524528000,,422,4.096385542168675
