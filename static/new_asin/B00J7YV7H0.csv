6338131,2,B00J7YV7H0,"Overall - low budget productions but mostly faithful to the text.

The book of Ruth is great because of the small cast in the story.  The scenes are well acted, but more cultural knowledge of the times would have helped.  The people wear the same garments throughout the whole movie.  Boaz wears purple which was definitely not the case since purple was extremely expensive and very rare.  There is a contradiction in the text with the implementation of a few short cut scenes with David at the beginning and end.  The present David is not knowing how to use the sling, but then do mention that he already killed a lion and a bear with it.  An odd contradiction.  But overall, this portion was well done in my Sunday school class enjoyed it.

The book of Esther is a total washout because of the obvious low-budget production.  The actors are all fine and do a good job but otherwise the movie does not match the scriptural text.  For example in chapter 1 of the biblical book, the Persian King calls over150 provincial princes, and their servants and bodyguards, and has a great feast lasting for a long time.  The movie has about a dozen characters max for the banquet.  What's up with that?  There is a much better presentation  One Night with the King.

I haven't watched the section on Peter yet",1512345600,5,1300,4.538793103448276

6338152,5,B00J7YV7H0,All three movies are great.  Esther and Ruth were very close to Scripture with only a small amount of artistic license used to make the movies flow smoothly.  Peter was excellent with quite a bit of artistic license but completely scriptural.  All three movies were very well done.  I enjoyed them all.,1482796800,9,302,4.75

6338159,5,B00J7YV7H0,"I've only watched the first movie, so far, but it's excellent. It added somethings to create more of a story line, but seems to be extremely accurate to scripture and very well put together. If you enjoy this one, I strongly recommend the book of Daniel by the same producer. Excellent biblical movie!!
