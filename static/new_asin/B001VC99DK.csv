3820553,5,B001VC99DK,"This series combines dramatic action, forensic science, and interviews with the FBI agents & local authorities who actual solved these cases and brought the bad guys to justice.
Cases in this season include: serial killers Darren O'Neal, Robert Rhodes, & Tim Ring, the bizarre Ben Yahweh cult killers, charismatic bank robber 'Hollywood' Scurlock, politician-turned-killer Thomas Capano, the violent Preacher Crew gang, and the heart-wrenching episode 'The Predator' (perhaps the best of the series & something every parent should see) which will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.",1239580800,6,596,5.633333333333334

3820560,5,B001VC99DK,"I first came to watch this programme here in the UK on the Quest Channel. I have always been a fan of American crime TV shows. So when I first watched an episode, it was truly gripping.

When I saw this show had been released on DVD, I just had to grab a copy. I have just completed watching this box set. Each episode has a story that focuses on the event. When justice is finally served.

One thing I don't like is, season 5, 6 and 7 is not available to buy here in the UK to be imported from the states.",1441670400,,506,3.9029126213592233

3820607,5,B001VC99DK,"This series season really delivers the goods as viewers get to see the cases unfold with a point of view that gives you a better look than any one party could have seen at the time. You are able to piece certain pieces of the puzzle together with the information as it's made available at just the right pace. You don't get disappointed with any spoilers but you're not completely teased beyond reason either. It's what I honestly believe is a near-perfect balance of storytelling rhythm.

Sometimes these kinds of shows as a genre can be boring, but The FBI Files Season 3 bucks the stereotype and provides good quality entertainment. I'm the type of viewer it really takes a lot to please when it comes to crime dramas as I've long been a fan of the gangster film genre. When it comes to television, there were never too many shows capable of holding my interest for an entire season, so this is high praise indeed. I really do recommend you watch it because you will be entertained. There were certain twists I never would have guessed but have seen the crimes copycatted in more than one region of the United States already since viewing this year. Kallstrom and company deserve the five stars for this work. Solid.",1428019200,,1219,4.591743119266055

The only differences are the way these great DVDs explain, investigate current case and cold, old case files. All are very informative and hold your attention with ease.  The best way to purchase is the bundle package which only Amazon offers to there customers saving you $$ and shipping fees, if any, when purchased through the Amazon Warehouse.  Still you are receiving a great deal with super saver shipping with $25.00 or more which will bring your ship fee to ZERO !!. I do not work for Amazon.
