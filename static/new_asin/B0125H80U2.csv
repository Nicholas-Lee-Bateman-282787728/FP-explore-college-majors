7342703,5,B0125H80U2,"Well, as the wife of the only father interviewed-- i am biased!!! But it is an incredibly well done movie that really focuses on the calling to religious life and how it is based primarily on a personal relationship with Christ. He does the calling. and these women -- representing twelve different orders-- are responding and give a wonderful witness to the love of God alive today!!!",1439856000,7,385,4.7611940298507465
7342704,5,B0125H80U2,"MUST WATCH SO BEAUTIFUL!!!!
You can truly see the face of Christ simply by watching the film!

If you are discerning or know someone discerning or are even wondering what Religious Life in the Catholic Church is waaaaatch it.",1439596800,7,225,4.769230769230769
7342705,5,B0125H80U2,"Just under 18 minutes long, this is a short (& mighty) film! I would recommend this film to EVERYONE because I believe the EVERYONE deserves to have access to encountering consecrated life *vibrantly* lived. I realize not every church has access to actually seeing/meeting religious sisters -- thus, in a small way, this film shares the reality that God is *still* calling women from all walks of life to love Him and to serve His Church TODAY. It's a beautiful reality to encounter and behold -- I encourage to get this film and share it with your loved ones. :) Young and old alike will enjoy it^^",1450483200,5,599,4.607476635514018
7342706,5,B0125H80U2,"Just watched this video with my husband. What a beautiful presentation of religious life in today's world! Our daughter is a sister in one of the orders highlighted--the Dominican Sisters of Saint Cecilia in Nashville--and this video can help people see evidence of the joy that surrounds us every time we visit our daughter at the convent. These women give themselves totally to service to mankind for the love of Jesus. The video, itself, is professionally produced with high quality camera and sound work. It's about 17 minutes in length, and I could have enjoyed watching similar footage for three times as long.",1446595200,3,616,4.990291262135922

7342714,5,B0125H80U2,"This film is fantastic. I think everyone needs to see it, to gain a new perspective and appreciate the beauty of the call to give one's life to Christ and His church FOR LOVE ALONE. :) The cinematography is awesome, and all the different components are put together so well. Finally there is an equivalent of ""Fishers of Men"" for women!",1440115200,7,336,4.524590163934426

8725404,5,B0125H80U2,"This was made by the same people who made a fisher of men which discusses the priesthood. It was not as moving, but it was informative and we are glad we watched it. It is short only about 20 minutes. It was appropriate for my 4th and 5th grade CCD students.",1463702400,3,258,4.078431372549019
8725405,5,B0125H80U2,Loved it,1462579200,,8,3.5
8725406,5,B0125H80U2,"This is a great, short film about the joy of living life as a Religious Sister in the Catholic Church. It really shows the unique way women are really spiritual mothers to everyone. The film also does a great job of portraying a number of different religious orders including the Dominicans and Franciscan Sisters of the Eucharist.

There is a great balance of music and visuals, with meaningful story telling about the various women that looked into religious life while leading a normal life, all within a short 17 minutes. Strongly recommend this to any vocations office or anyone thinking of a religious life or wanting to help someone discover their call.

I received a copy of this while helping out some religious sisters.",1459987200,,729,4.870967741935484
8725407,5,B0125H80U2,Beautiful!  Show it to your daughters and your youth group!,1457740800,,59,4.9
8725408,5,B0125H80U2,"This is a great DVD for teens, to introduce them to sisterhood and why women enter orders.  It shows how God actually calls an individual no matter where they are in life.",1453852800,,171,4.34375
8725409,5,B0125H80U2,"Beautiful, inspiring, great cinematography.",1451779200,,43,10.0
8725410,5,B0125H80U2,"This short film is very dynamic and profound, not featuring any specific order of nuns.  This makes it suitable for fostering deep thought on the issue of vocational discernment, particularly for young women.  The nuns in this professionally produced film are all in the traditional habits, thus making a more visual impact.  It is very theologically sound and deeply spiritual in content.",1451347200,5,389,5.241935483870968
