2526893,5,B000EQ46H8,"It is about time that one of the best TV westerns has been released on DVD. I just received my copy and after watching the shows, I can say they are as enjoyable as I hoped. To be not only treasured, but watched over and over. The interview with Clint Walker is very well done, too.

Down through the years I've seen a few re-runs of Cheyenne on TV, and for any of us from that era who watched them on TV, this is something we have long awaited. They will go on the shelf next to the Wyatt Earp, Gunsmoke DVDs,  and Sackett DVD.

Both Clint Walker and we Cheyenne fans have just been enriched.

Let er rip!

2526894,5,B000EQ46H8,"For those of us who love good westerns the mid 1950s through early 1960s was a Golden Age. Cheyenne was one of the first -- and definitely one of the best -- series in this golden era of westerns. This outstanding series featured tall, handsome Clint Walker as soft-spoken but tough Cheyenne Bodie, a veteran of the Civil War, who went west after the war for adventure and found plenty of it -- and sometimes some romance too. I hope that this release on DVD of this first season of Cheyenne will be the success it deserves to be and will result in the release of all of the seasons of Cheyenne. If we're lucky maybe we'll eventually get the various seasons of Maverick, Bronco, and Sugarfoot too.",1146960000,30,697,4.453125
2526895,5,B000EQ46H8,"Drifting from job to job, a foreman on a ranch, a trail scout for a wagon train, a recently deputized lawman encountering  plenty of villains, beautiful girls, and gunfights. Cheyenne Bodie was a tall, strapping western adventurer in the days following the Civil War.

2526896,5,B000EQ46H8,"Warner Bros is riding towards the right direction. The release of the First Season of Cheyenne is not only a wise decision of the studio, but also an essencial one. Cheyenne was the show that led Warner Brothers to be one of the biggest companies producing television series. Cheyenne was the very beginning for the studio, and it was, and still is, an important part in television history. Along with Gunsmoke, Cheyenne established the pattern for other western series to come out of Warner Bros and other studios. Clint Walker was not a good actor, but his massive physical building and his soft way of speaking were perfect for a rugged hero of a western show and he became one of the most remarkable television stars for the genre.

The first season of Cheyenne, in spite of being excellent, was not the best one. The episodes ran a bit shorter because Warner used the final minutes for a ""behind-the-scenes"", promoting the studio movies. And that pleasing song by William Lava and Stan Jones was absent. Unfortunately the first season had only 15 episodes. Nevertheless, this DVD box is a must for anybody who wants to get in touch with old television shows and learn how good and attractive they were. Let's enjoy the first season of Cheyenne, and hope that Warner Bros releases the second, the third and so on.",1144108800,73,1317,4.726086956521739
2526897,5,B000EQ46H8,"I have about 25 VHS tapes full of episodes of ""Cheyenne"" that I have taped off of the Good Life TV Network, where it aired from the late 1990's prime time and occasionally on weekend afternoons as well.  The episodes were introduced by George Clooney's father, Nick, who usually gave a bit of trivia about the episode, the star, Clint Walker, or one of the many guest stars.  As of 2004, the last time I had access to the channel, Clooney was still on the network, introducing ""Cheyenne"", as well as the other great black & white Warner Brothers westerns from the 1950's and early 1960's, like ""Bronco"" and ""Maverick"".  The network also showed ""Sugarfoot"" and ""Lawman"", but only on weekends without Clooney's introductions.

""Cheyenne"" remains my favorite of the old WB westerns, with Clint Walker a very unusual western star, given his immense size.  One might wonder why any character would have dared to give him a hard time, but they did, and usually ended up worse for the wear.  ""Bronco"" took over, off and on during Walker's lawsuit against WB.  I enjoyed that one, too, as it had a lot of action.  But Clint is the man, and I'm glad to see this series reaching DVD.

The first season does not feature the familiar theme song, which I believe does not appear until the second season.  The first season theme song is pretty unmemorable, so be prepared for that.  Also, you will find the first few shows of the series to be featuring character actor L.Q. Jones as ""Smitty"", Cheyenne Bodie's somewhat humorous sidekick.  Jones is priceless in his own right and one of my favorite western character actors.  However, this is Clint's gig, and the producers of the series soon found that out and the Smitty character is gone by the second season.  So if you are a fan of the series or good TV westerns, this set is worth it, but in my opinion, the series got even better in the second season and beyond.

And just a note on ""Maverick"", which will likely be following soon on DVD.  In my humble opinion, the opposite is true.  My favorite season of ""Maverick"" is the first season, because I am more of a fan of action in a western than humor, and James Garner's first-season Bret Maverick is a more serious and kick-ass hero than in later seasons, where he loosens up a bit and the happy-go-lucky Maverick most people know and love gradually appears.  Also, the vocal version (with words) of the great ""Maverick"" theme song does not appear in the first season. It's the same melody, but instrumental.  In nearly all cases in nearly all of these great WB westerns, any vocal theme song appears only over the ending credits, not at the beginning.  At least that is to the best of my recollection.",1143158400,137,2694,4.5845511482254695
2526898,5,B000EQ46H8,"Kudos and a big thumbs up to Warner Bros. for releasing the 1st season of Cheyenne. Yes!!!
TV historians will tell you that this program was one of the first of the so-called ""adult"" westerns broadcast, it debuted just three nights after Gunsmoke.
Clint Walker was the epitome of a western hero,:6'6"", rugged, broad-shouldered and a man of few words.  The character of Cheyenne Bodie was a loner, a white man raised by the Cheyenne tribe.  He roamed the old west, sometimes working as a lawman, wagonmaster,etc, always helping the weak.

Cheyenne, like many classic westerns, is from a bygone era when heroic characters  were uncomplicated and always defeated evil in the end.

Lets hope WB contnues to release full seasons of its former stable of classic westerns like Bronco, Maverick, Lawman, Sugarfoot and The Dakotas.  It would also be  cool to see the release of WB detective shows like 77 Sunset Strip, Surfside Six, Hawaiian Eye and Bourbon Street Beat.",1143158400,140,961,4.931677018633541

I'm a girl who likes her westerns and Cheyenne was unforgettable though I only saw a few when I was small, thank goodness for repeats.  I grew up on Bonanza with Candy, High Chaparral, the Rifle Man and Branded, the Virginian, Rawhide and I do love those Cartwright men in the Adam days best but Cheyenne always stood out in my mind.  He was everything good and right in a world that was pretty wild back then.  And Clint Walker?  Oh my, he would've made the most absolute best Superman ever!

2526957,5,B000EQ46H8,"Clint Walker single-handedly started the big studio boom of T.V. westerns in the 50's. Yeah, there were other western stars before him on T.V. oaters, but he was head and shoulders above the rest (no pun intended). Walker was big, tough, and charismatic. His big frame and deep resonant voice portrayed a more menacing western hero. Some times the story lines are contrived and predictable, but Walker makes you look past the formulaic episodes to his compelling portrayal of fiddle-footed hero Cheyenne Bodie. Because of Walker's larger than life presence, it is easily one of the best westerns to come out of the 50's. If you're a western fan like me, Cheyenne will end up being one of your favorites. Walker's easy-going moral hero is easy to watch and root for. Definitely worth the price of admission.",1459382400,,806,4.890510948905109

2526973,5,B000EQ46H8,"Clint Walker at his charismatic best. He stood 6'6"" and was a vegan long before it was hip in Hollywood. He is best known for playing ""Posey"" in the Dirty Dozen to those unfamiliar with this amazing tv western series, one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood, Mr. Walker had to live with being in the other Clints shadow. Night of the Grizzly and Killdozer rank among my personal favorites, but he made some great films over the years. This series way ahead of its time and the episodic adventures it placed in Americas face via television was greatly appreciated because the show ran several years and made a star out of Walker. For good reason as this show really was AWESOME. Clint Turns 89 soon and is one of Hollywoods true macho treasures.",1451174400,,751,4.57037037037037

2527085,5,B000EQ46H8,"Cheyenne is a wonderful vintage western series.  I had not seem these episodes since I was very young.  They are marvelous and I am so glad to find them available on DVD.  The plots are quite well written and well worth purchasing to view the old west in a very interesting perspective. Of course, Cheyenne is always the super hero no matter how many times he is hit on the head or thrown in jail, but that is so wonderful to see from our current reality perspective.  I'll take fantasy any day.  Also, this series is a cast of thousands when it comes to future stars and their early appearances before they became famous.  For example, Michael Landon is so young that he is not even listed in the ending credits of one episode. This series is priceless and I highly recommend it.  I will treasure it always now that I have it.  I also highly recommend Amazon.  Great service in every way.",1418688000,,889,4.404907975460123

2527091,3,B000EQ46H8,"One of my favorite western television series.  The first season of Cheyenne was a little rough around the edges in terms of acting and direction, but still very entertaining, especially for its time (1955).  The video quality of these DVDs suffers somewhat from the transfer, but still watchable.  The audio is acceptable.  The most disappointing aspect of this compilation is that each episode is only 40 minutes (give or take a minute), which seems way too short even after subtracting all the commercials.  I suspect that several minutes were cut from each of the episodes (although I may be wrong about that).  Overall, despite some negatives, I'm not disappointed with this purchase, especially when considering the reasonable cost (I paid less than $10).",1416528000,4,760,5.138211382113822

2527144,5,B000EQ46H8,"John who? Wayne what? Forget that cowboy! Clint Walker is the king of cowboys! I was born in 1961 but never watched many westerns. I have never been a huge fan of westerns on TV or the movies. Clint Walker changed all that. Well...I like his style of westerns anyway. I actually bought the first season years ago and set it aside. I finally started watching the episodes. Wow! I bought the first season of Cheyenne because I had seen Clint Walker in an old movie and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. Not only does Clint Walker have understated charisma on both the small and large screens, the scripts of Cheyenne were very well written. In some cases, especially as the series continued in later years, I believe the scripts were ahead of their time. Yes, there was violence in the west. However, with Clint Walker's portrayal of the character Cheyenne there seems to be the lesson that violence should not be the first answer to the problem. He always tried to find another solution to the problem. But, when it was necessary, nobody could beat Cheyenne. I am in the process of purchasing every Cheyenne season and every Clint Walker movie available on Amazon. Everyone who loves westerns seems to idolize John Wayne. I am in no way going to speak poorly of Mr. Wayne. However, Mr. Walker is, by far, the better of the two in my opinion. He should have been a much bigger star in later years than he was. If you like westerns or if you like Clint Walker and if you want TV viewing that anyone in your family can watch from young to young-at-heart, then the entire Cheyenne series should be in your DVD library while you can still get them. Don't just stop at Season 1. While you are at it, buy Mr. Walker's movies. He is great no matter what he is in!",1392336000,3,1760,4.418461538461538
2527145,5,B000EQ46H8,"Clint Walker is one of the nicest down to earth people you could ever meet.  I think his talent was under rated.  The Cheyenne series had the best writers that the industry had to offer.  Each show never failed to mention Prayer, serving God or our country.  The moral of the story was always very clear.  Children who watch this show will get a dose of patriotism, sense of God and Country and learn a life lesson.  And I haven't even mentioned to factual depiction of history that was honored by the writers.  They sure don't make em like they used to.",1392163200,2,554,4.372549019607843

2527225,4,B000EQ46H8,"I was very happy to get the first season of Cheyenne. I watch my favorite shows while on the treadmill (I know, too much information) and was enjoying the first episode although perplexed by the soundless introduction (""Warner Brothers Presents:). Warner Brothers claims to be ""The First In Sound"" and on shows a few years later over the same visual of the Warner Brothers sound stages the announcer intoned: ""FROM THE ENTERTAINMENT CAPITAL OF THE WORLD, PRODUCED FOR TELEVISION BY WARNER BROTHERS""....Well now I am watching and enjoying the first episode. I've never seen it in syndication. A typical episode from syndication is around 50 minutes long and as the episode ended and I looked at the timer on the treadmill it read...40 MINUTES!!!. What happened? What got ""CHOPPED""? Was I robbed?...After some simple research I discovered that ""Cheyenne"" was one of 3 shows under the umbrella of ""Warner Brothers Presents"" which premiered on ABC in September of 1955. The show was narrated by Gig Young and at the end of the episode featured 10 to 15 minutes of previews of Warner Brothers movies. What a treasure trove of movie history that is sitting somewhere other than on the video I purchased in good faith.. I GOT ROBBED MISTER!!! No Gig Young, No 15 minutes of previews. Thankfully one of my favorite television weaver of tales, Roy Huggins, produced the first year and even wrote an episode. What happened to ""Honest"" product descriptions. I would still have purchased this set and then not feel I was being ""ROBBED"" every time I watched it. I will bet you anything that over the desk of the head of Warner Brothers is a cartton cell of Daffy Duck yelling ""MINE, MINE, MINE! right next to a cell of Bugs Bunny counting money and saying ""One for you and three for me, SUCKER!"".",1317772800,2,1783,4.773462783171521

2527227,4,B000EQ46H8,"1955 was the year when TV Westerns suddenly transformed from kiddie fare to ""adult,"" and this series, with James Arness's Gunsmoke, was one of the most important players in that change.  Originally one of three rotating series sharing the same time slot (which accounts for this set featuring only 15 segments), Cheyenne was also among the first in a long line of well-known and successful Warner Brothers oaters.  It's also intriguing that both it and GS should focus on a man of more than ordinary stature (Clint Walker was only an inch shorter than Arness).  Drifter Cheyenne Bodie, who got his nickname from having dwelt with the Cheyenne Indians from age 10 to 18 (at the end of that time he ""walked away with their blessings""), ranges from Mexico to Wyoming, doing free-lance freighting and working variously as a lawman, a cowhand, and a government scout; in the first few episodes (#1, 2, and 4 of the set) he's the guide for a Texan-born surveyor known as Smitty (L. Q. Jones), but later he becomes a loner.  Like other Westerns of its kind, the series often addresses such issues as loyalty (betrayal by someone Cheyenne trusts is at the core of two segments), the lingering wounds of the Civil War, and the ""savagery"" of Indians.  Walker (who was 28 when the series premiered) is perhaps not a great actor, but he has real presence, and the dialogue is well written (one of the writers was Alan LeMay, known as the author of the classic novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Searchers/dp/1568497040/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Searchers</a>, and another segment appears to have been based on B. Traven's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Treasure-of-the-Sierra-Madre/dp/045103435X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</a>): Cheyenne may be laconic, but when he speaks it's memorably and to purpose.  And, like all the Westerns of its era, the series attracted a good roster of guest stars, including perpetual heavy Robert J. Wilkie, John Doucette, James Garner (who shows up no less than three times, twice as a Cavalry lieutenant, and who went on to fame in WB's series ""Maverick""), Ray Teal, Rod Taylor, Edward Andrews, Myron Healey, Leo Gordon, Dubb [sic] Taylor, Michael Landon (uncredited and looking about 15), Gerald Mohr, Trevor Bardette, Ralph Moody, Mort Mills (twice, once uncredited), Carlos Rivas (who went on to portray Lun Tha in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-King-and-I-50th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B000HT3PGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The King and I (50th Anniversary Edition)</a>), Nancy Kulp, and Peggie Castle as Mary ""Mississippi"" Brown (she was eventually a regular on the WB series ""Lawman"").  It's not entirely clear when these adventures are happening: one episode takes place during the French Intervention in Mexico, another c. 1868, several probably 1872 or later, and in one we see a typewriter (the first commercially successful model of which began production in 1873)--but, as in other Western series like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Texan/dp/B001FRNB62/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Texan</a>, the writers may simply be showing us random incidents from a long career.

My only complaint: If a particular country area code is req'd when ordering, the fact should be made more evident and understandable on the order form.

The extra feature of Clint's recent interview was certainly a bonus.  He's just the same gentleman he was way back then.  Would love to meet him in person.  He's on my ""who would you invite for dinner list""!

And how interesting to see very familiar faces appearing as co-stars perhaps for the first time - like James Garner and Rod Taylor.  Also very interesting to see between the first disc and the last disc how quickly the stories and acting became so much more sophisticated and improved in that short amount of time.

Cheyenne was an orphan raised by Indians.  While not much reference is made to this unique background, it never goes without saying in each episode that he is a large or big man.  He is a wanderer who is a Jack of All trades and a friend to all who let him be.  I especially like how much he travels because I love the old west.  Women swoon over him, but he is always a gentleman.  He is resourceful and always helping someone else.  His deep, slow monotone voice is not a distraction, but the message gets across. His facial expressions help.  Part of his character to not get excited, intimidated or riled.

When reaching adulthood, Cheyeene Bodie chose to leave the Cheyeene Tribe to return to live with the white men working as a scout for hire.

You can't find good TV like this in modern programming. Just about everything that makes Cheyenne good is missing from modern television. In any western show you expect shooting and bad guys/gals what you don't see is all the harsh, in your face, blood and gore of modern TV. Five seconds into most crime dramas today you have seen more than you want to of blood, gore, violence and too much more.

Clint Walker and his many co-stars did a fabulous job of bringing the moral challenges we continue to face today into the light. He has done it with grace, honor and integrity and we are all the richer for his efforts. Hands down this is one the best western TV dramas out there.

2527280,4,B000EQ46H8,"""Cheyenne"" is a talky, low-key western similiar in tone to Bonanza. This is a gem from the 50s however the series struggles because of Clint Walker's unexpressive acting style. The ratio of action to lots and lots of dialogue is very low and prevents ""Cheyenne"" from being as good as other westerns like ""THe Tall Man"", ""Have Gun Will Travel"" and ""Rifleman."" This series is probably the favorite western of very few however it has an overall likable feel.
Clint Walker fans need the Charles Bronson 1977 western ""The White Buffalo"", Clint has a small yet memorable part as a vicious bad guy.

2527281,5,B000EQ46H8,"Cheyenne is a western television series of 108 black-and-white episodes broadcast on ABC from 1955 to 1962. The show was the first hour-long western, the first series to be made by a major Hollywood film studio which did not derive from its established film properties,[4] and the first of a long chain of Warner Brothers original series produced by William T. Orr.

The series strength was its charismatic star and TV western icon, Clint Walker, who dominated the screen with his powerful physique. Off the set, Walker battled the studio over his contract, making Cheyenne one of the more tempestuous productions in the history of television.

The series began as a part of Warner Brothers Presents, a program that alternated three different series in rotation. In its first year, Cheyenne traded broadcast weeks with Casablanca and King's Row. Thereafter, Cheyenne was overhauled by outgoing producer Roy Huggins and left the umbrella of WBP. The show starred Clint Walker as Cheyenne Bodie, a physically huge cowboy wandering the Old West. The show ran from 1955 to 1963, except for a hiatus when Walker went on strike for higher pay (1958-1959). The interim saw the introduction of a virtual Bodie-clone called Bronco Layne, played by Ty Hardin. Hardin was featured as the quasi main character during Bodie's absence. When Warners renegotiated Walker's contract and the actor returned to the show in 1959, Bronco was spunoff as a show in its own right and became independently successful.

The two series alternated in the same time slot from 1958 to 1962, with Bronco as the junior partner (only a snippet of his theme song was heard in the opening credits, as a kind of aural footnote to Cheyenne's). Occasionally both Cheyenne and Bronco appeared together in the same episode, both deadly serious as they worked together.

At the conclusion of the sixth season, a special episode was aired. Called ""A Man Named Ragan"", it was a pilot for a program called The Dakotas that would replace Cheyenne in the middle of the next season. However, because Cheyenne Bodie never appeared in ""Ragan"", the two programs are only tenuously linked.[2]

Walker reprised the Cheyenne Bodie character in 1991 for the TV-movie The Gambler Returns: Luck of the Draw and also played Cheyenne in an episode of Kung Fu: The Legend Continues in 1995.

For the 1957-58 season, ABC offered to purchase a full season of thirty-nine episodes of Cheyenne. Warner Brothers declined, however, since each hour-long episode took six working days for principal photography alone. The studio couldn't supply a new episode each week. Because Walker appeared in virtually every scene, it was also impossible to shoot more than one episode at a time.[5]

Cheyenne Bodie, a former frontier scout, is the heroic loner who drifts without any particular motivation or purpose through the old West after the Civil War taking temporary jobs on ranches, wagon trains, or cattle drives. Sometimes he works for the federal government or finds himself deputized by local lawmen. He often meddles in the affairs of others, settling conflicts with his fists and guns rather than with his wits, mediation, conciliation, or persuasion. Producers changed Bodie's circumstances at will in order to insert him into any dramatic conflict. Several Cheyenne episodes were remakes of earlier Warner Brothers movies like To Have and Have Not (1944) and Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) with Cheyenne Bodie simply inserted into the original plot.

L. Q. Jones (Smitty) and Clint Walker (Cheyenne)Clint Walker as main character Cheyenne Bodie is the only series regular. L. Q. Jones appears as Cheyenne's sidekick Smitty in three first-season episodes. Thereafter, no recurring characters make appearances as Cheynne's circumstances change with every episode and he relocates as his drifter tastes and lifestyle dictate. Diane Brewster first appears as Samantha Crawford, the swindler with a fake southern accent, in an episode called ""Dark Rider"" before the character migrates to Maverick to become the Maverick brothers' most celebrated nemesis. Among guest stars were the child actor Roger Mobley, later on NBC's Fury and a star of Walt Disney studios.

ABC televised the show from 1955 to 1962: September 1955-September 1959 Tuesday 7:30-8:30 P.M.; September 1959-December 1962, Monday 7:30-8:30 P.M.; April 1963-September 1963, Friday 7:30-8:30 P.M..

Dell Comics produced a comic book based on the series. After 3 issues in their Four Color Comics series, it got its own title for issues #4-25 from (1957-1962). All issues had photo covers. Milton Bradley published a Cheyenne board game for children based on the series. Golden Books published an illustrated storybook for very young children while Whitman Publishing printed a novel called The Lost Gold of Lion Park for older children.

Cheyenne was a principal reason for ABC's ratings ascent during the mid-1950s. ABC had fewer national affiliates than CBS and NBC, but in markets with affiliates of all three networks, Cheyenne immediately entered the top ten; by 1957, it had become the number one program in those markets. Cheyenne finished the 1957-58 season as the second highest-rated series on ABC.

Cheyenne was a co-winner of the 1957 Golden Globe Award for Television Achievement.",1228348800,8,5297,5.211515863689777

Clint was the gentle giant who young boys of the '50's idolized and young girls dreamed of marrying. Clint's mannerism, acting style, voice and sheer size brought the Cheyenne character to life. This DVD is perfect for those of us old enough to remember the series and to those who we would like to introduce this series to. The best part of the DVD is the recent interview with Clint. Time has indeed taken its toll on this man who once looked looked like a Greek God, but its a joy seeing him for one more time. There are so many more questions that I wished had been asked  such as his interest in body building, his excperience in movies, why he felt his career did not take off as James Garner, Steve Mcqueen's etc, and how he spends his time today. Perhaps in future DVDs Clint might agree to sit down for a more extensive interview. In the meantime, may I suggest his terrific website where his fans can avail themselves of some wonderful Cheyenne autographed photos and memorabilia.

Well worn but just holding it brings back such good memories.

  Sadly, the DVD set does not have the entire Cheynenne soundtrack like the VHS version (only one show on it though) did. I also think Amazon charged me too much for it.

Maverick, Rifleman, Wagon Train, Dead or Alive, Paladin...were all showing and dinner just didn't taste right if you didn't have one of these to help the palette.

My favorite was Cheyenne.  He was strong, humble, and just short of a grizzly bear was going to whip anything that didn't stand for good.  He also liked the ladies and that was a real plus!

Clint Walker was and is the perfect choice for this role.  The plots are good, the acting is excellent and there is usally a good moral to each story.

2527352,4,B000EQ46H8,"Running 107 episodes, from 1955 through 1963, ""Cheyenne"" was one of the first ""television"" productions from the Warner Brothers film studio. Clint Walker plays the title character, an ex-frontier scout who was raised by Cheyenne Indians after his parents were killed.

Cheyenne Bodie roams the West in the days after the Civil War, having adventures and helping folks out. The tall laconic hero would eventually become television's quintessential loner but actually started out with a sidekick named Smitty (L.Q. Jones), who was a mapmaker. Cheyenne and Smitty do mapping work for the Army and in this occupation stumble across the people who make up each episode's story.

The current DVD set covers the 15 episodes from Season One and includes a recent interview with Clint Walker called ""The Lonely Gunfighter: The Legacy of Cheyenne"". The reason there are only 15 episodes is because ""Cheyenne"" was only broadcast every third week, being part of an anthology series called ""Warner Brothers Presents"" which also included ""Casablanca"" (with Marcel Dalio) and ""King's Row"" (with Robert Horton and Jack Kelly). In subsequent seasons the anthology would feature shows like ""Conflict"", ""Sugarfoot"", and ""Bronco Lane"".

Contrary to popular belief, the episodes on the 1st season DVD have not been abbreviated. Although they run less that the normal 50 minutes (60 minutes minus commercials) it is because the original broadcasts took some additional minutes for Warner Brothers to use in promoting their coming attractions; with a behind the scenes look at one of their soon to be released features.

Also unique to the first season was an attempt to add scale to the stories by inserting a lot of stock footage of cattle drives, Indian attacks, and huge wagon trains. In general they did a better job than most ""B"" westerns of matching this footage to the back lot and sound stage stuff featuring the actual cast of each episode. But this technique and the busy schedule was a nightmare for the editors. The first episode ""Mountain Fortress"" includes a particularly amusing continuity issue. Watch how the sergeant and the trooper are killed early in an Indian attack, then magically reappear in a subsequent group shot. Most likely the editors noticed the problem but there was not time to re-shoot the scene with the correct cast.

At least two episodes take actual movie plots and retell them in a Western setting. ""Fury at Rio Hondo"" is a retelling of ""To Have and to Have Not"" with Peggy Castle outstanding in the Lauren Bacall role. ""The Argonaunts"" is a retelling of ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" and features Rod Taylor.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1166745600,11,2678,5.02027027027027
2527353,4,B000EQ46H8,"Warning:  This set contains several sets, each with two disks, each with several episodes of the show on it.  Only the first set was in good condition.  When I started viewing sets 2, 3, and 4, virtually every one had severe problems - no sounds, damaged picture - virtually unwatchable.  The person who remastered this either didn't check the other sets or hoped the purchaser would not go past Set One until it was too late to return.  Shameful quality, absolutely shameful.  You would do better to purchase this from Walker's own website.

I was a child when this series debuted, and while I did remember being aware of Clint Walker's astonishing physical presence even as a five-year-old female, I didn't remember much else.  Imagine my surprise, upon taking a chance on this set, to find that these were well-scripted, well-acted, at times even touching programs.  Yes, several Old Western Movie cliches are present, most notably last-minute rescues by the Cavalry, constant attacks by screaming Indians, good girl/bad girl stereotypes, always-unshaven villains (you can spot them a mile away), and lots of killin'.  However, offsetting these are the hero's sensitivity, without sentimentality, to the plight of the Indians by this point in time; a reluctance to kill unless pushed to the wall; and a respectful gentleness toward all women, ""good"" or ""bad"". Walker imbues Cheyenne Bodie with great decency without seeming preachy or mealymouthed. In fact, Walker himself is one-quarter Cherokee and he is married to a Native American woman.  Fine performers show up in their salad days, such as the always delightful James Garner (he appears in several of these episodes) and a handsome young Rod Taylor (whose bare chest gives Clint's a run for its money, no mean feat!). It is fun watching and suddenly saying, ""Why, isn't that so and so when s/he was really young?!""  You remember how important early television was to the careers of so many who went on to films or to television shows of their own (Garner went on to ""Maverick"" and thence to movie fame, Taylor to a movie career, etc.)

These shows are, it is true, somewhat dated, but they are not without merit.  Listening to Walker gently reassuring a terrified woman returning to white society after six years of captivity with the Kiowa that she will not revolt white men, and comparing this with the parade of sadistic violence toward and humiliation of women that permeates today's television shows, I felt a real sense of affection and loss.  If you don't have a feeling for the west these may not interest you.  But if you do, or if you were one of those children whose families sat around in the evening together and watched these shows in the 1950s, I think you will enjoy this set, for itself and for the lost era in which the shows emerged.

Clint Walker is perfect as the big cowboy, a true western hero who uses his head to outsmart the villains when he can and his fists or gun to defeat them when he can't.  It is obvious that Mr. Walker had a lot of fun with the role and truly breathed life into the character of Cheyenne.  There is also underlying humor in a lot of Cheyenne's dialogue which I missed as a child, but as an adult I thoroughly enjoyed.  This DVD set of the first season includes five discs.

2527374,5,B000EQ46H8,"Was absolutely delighted to find that the ""Cheyenne"" series were going to be packaged and released by Warner Brothers, and hope like heck they do some of the other WB classics of the 50s/60s like ""77 Sunset Strip"", ""Maverick"", ""Colt .45"" , etc.

  Premiering almost simultaneously with ""Gunsmoke"" in the fall of 1955, Cheyenne (though a ""limited run"" series) held its on in the Nielson ratings wars and became a runaway hit for Warners from its premiere on.

  There were big differences between what was done with ""Cheyenne"" and what CBS did with ""Gunsmoke"". Gunsmoke was

""tied down"" to Dodge City, Kansas, for the most part...though Matt Dillon did make OCCASIONAL forays out into the ""territory""

(to transport prisoners from one jurisdiction to another,for example) but mostly anything that went on, went on in Dodge and involved the nuclear ""Gunsmoke' character ensemble.

  ""Cheyenne"", on the other hand, was all over the map. Bodie was a ""working drifter"" who roamed the west doing all sorts of odd jobs : government mapmaker, Army scout, Cattlemen's Association range detective, cowboy, part-time lawman, etc., and each of these jobs would invariably ride him into some conflict situation. And all of these conflict situations were enhanced by the fact that Warners owned reel after reel of stock footage from dozens of studio-made westerns and liberally added such to ""Cheyenne"" adventures to fill them out and give them greater ""scope"" and a more expensive look than most all the other western competition on the tube at that time. If you will notice, Cheyenne has a more varied wardrobe than any other t.v. cowpoke of the period. He has several different jackets of different colors and styles and sometimes his shirts and pants are different from episode to episode. He is also sometimes seen to wear a black hat and, at other times, a gray hat or (most likely, being a B & W show) a tan hat. All of this wardrobe variety has a specific production purpose: at some point in the episode stock footage is going to be inserted whereby the hero in whatever movie this film is taken from wore a certain outfit and Cheyenne has to be dressed appropriately

to MATCH the original. Sometimes the original here is Randolph Scott and sometimes someone else. In any event, at times the match-up only involves less than a minute(and sometimes only SECONDS) of footage, but Bodie must wear that particular clothing ensemble to make the editing trick work when it is time for it to do so.

  All this padding is, for the most part, brilliantly done. In this first season collection there are footage ""lifts"" from

Errol Flynn's ""Dodge City"" and ""Virginia City"" and, in a later season, in an episode where Bodie is held prisoner by Indians and forced to helplessly watch the Battle of the Little Big Horn, the battle itself is lifted from ""They Died With Their Boots On"" with only the Flynn close-ups removed.

  This production technique served Warners well and always insured that ""Cheyenne"" had a lot more excitement and rousing action and adventure in it than anything Matt, Chester, Festus, Doc or Kitty incurred. Another plus was that big Clint Walker

was a good actor who well understood ""eye work"" (acting with your eyes), body language, and underplaying a role (rather than ""hamming it up"" in, say, William Shatner style). Walker's performance is solid and he gives Bodie an image of courage, integrity, principles, ethics, and inner strength that embody to perfection what the idea of the Western Man was perceived to be like. But another touch was added as well : Walker also instilled, through masterfully executed nuance, a wistful air of loneliness to the character....a touch that drove female viewers wild (that, and the episodes that contrived to have the muscular Walker appear shirtless onscreen). Of all the western characters from television in the fifties and early sixties, Clint Walker's Cheyenne Bodie was...and is...far and away one of the most popular and memorable.

  This DVD collection is a great way to ""hook up"" with an old buddy if one is of the boomer generation, AND is an excellent introduction to Cheyenne to the younger crowd who haven't yet made his acquaintance. You get the pre-Maverick James Garner here in three episodes as well, two times as a cavalry officer and once as a minister (Reverend Brett Maverick??? Say Whaaat??).

  Now I would encourage one and all to buy this set because that will make the WB issue a SECOND SEASON collection, and THAT...my friends...is what I seriously want to get my hot little hands on. You see, the second season of ""Cheyenne"" produced one of the most well-remembered television episodes OF the 1950s, a long-time ""boomer"" favorite...the hair-raising

""Big Ghost Basin"". This was one of those sleep-with-the-lights-on-and-a-butcher-knife-under-your-pillow ""thriller-dillers"" that

is as vividly remembered by ""boomers"" as the episodes ""The Hungry House"", ""The Grim Reaper"", Or ""Pidgeons From Hell"" on ""Thriller"", or ""To Serve Man"" on ""Twilight Zone"". ""Big Ghost Basin"" was adapted from a short story,""Nights of Terror"", by Steve Frazee, one of the best western writers of the fifties.

It concerns cattlemen concerned by a serious rustler threat in their area, as well as ""something else"". That something else is called ""the campfire killer"" because IT attacks and kills...always by night...all pickets or cattle guards who are gathered around campfires. It crushes humans, pulverizes them, and leaves only corpses and outsized bizarre-looking tracks in its wake. On the show, it comes down to Cheyenne vs. ""the thing"" in the end.  Saw a VHS version of ""Big Ghost Basin"" recorded off of cable a couple of years back and was not disappointed. Oh, the make-up was a tad cheesy by today's standards, but the creature is only shown for a matter of seconds...and in poor light (on purpose)...so it doesn't come across as irredeemably fakey. In toto, ""Big Ghost"" stands the test of time quite well.

  So I urge you , tv fans, western fans, get out there and BUY this first season of Cheyenne....so I can hopefully get to see ""Cheyenne : Season Two, Episode 14"" by Christmas!!!!! (Better yet...by HALLOWEEN!!).",1156291200,15,6185,4.997076023391813

2527399,4,B000EQ46H8,"I gave this only 4 stars, but that is not to say it isn't the best western collection on the market, so far.  I've watched Have Gun Will Travel, Wyatt Earp, and others, and they remain enjoyable, but can't compare in terms of character development, density of plotting, overall production and involvement.  Only other Warners programs would come close. But, the first season shows the growing pains for the new show with false starts, and inconsistencies, due to two producers with different views of the character, and the shoehorning of the character into different movie remakes and reworkings.

The Cheyenne theme music, sans lyrics, is in place under the opening title from the first show, but Warners opted for a terrible western orchestral piece for the end credits.  The familiar Cheyenne theme with lyrics didn't show up until the 2nd season.

Some viewers are dismayed by the remakes they spot in Cheyenne.  I recall that Bogart's ""The Maltese Falcon"", and John Huston's ""Moby Dick"" were the 3rd versions of each film, so the shows can be judged on their on merits and compared to their sources.

#1 Mountain Fortress- **** - remake of Rocky Mountain (Errol Flynn)  Big production, some cut in from the original.

#2 Julesburg - *** - average b western with lots of action

#3 Argonauts  -****- interesting remake of Tresure o/t Sierra Madre, with Rod Taylor

#4 Border Showdown - **** - Last of the b-style westerns, fine action.  Last appearance of Smitty, who, as sidekicks go, was entertaining.

#5 The Outlander - ***** - Don't read the DVD description, if you haven't seen this before, as it gives away too much.  This marks Cheyenne as the ""First adult Western"", and Gunsmoke and Wyatt Earp as mere pretenders. Uses mature concepts and real character development.

#6 The Travelers -***- remake of Along the Great Divide

#7 Decision -****- violent calvary tale

#8 The Storm Riders -*****- Reworking of the dramatic elements of ""Bordertown"", and ""They Drive By Night"".  Excellent performances. Works better than the either earlier incarnation, as Bordertown is unwatchable, and They Drive is excellent, but uneven. The melodramatic elements are introduced early in the C. script and meshed into the other storyline seamlessly.

#9  Rendezvous at Red Rock - ****-

#10 Quicksand - **** - excellent character revelations, psychology, solid story.  Would rank higher except that everyone who watches the program has doubts about how the quicksand would actually work.  No one I know could say that this couldn't happen like this, but no one believes that anyone else really knows, either.

#11 West of the River -****- Pretty straight remake of ""Charge at Feather River"" ;  Doesn't gain or lose from the original. Inconsistency: Cheyenne seems to be heading off with the heroine to live happily ever after, as in the movie.

#12 Fury at Rio Hondo-****- Reworking of Hemingway's ""To Have and Have Not"" The movie has great photography, and sets to its credit. It's story isn't tight due to Hawks' dwelling on Bogie and Bacall, and the singing of Carmichael.  I prefer the Cheyenne story tight, direct, fast moving.  Inconsistency: they kept in the scene where Bogart's hand shakes,when he wants to kill the villain.  This doesn't work with Cheyenne's character at all.

#13 Star in the Dust- ***** - I believe this is original and my choice for the best program of the first season.  Story, character development, action, all excellent.  The character of Cheyenne, however, seems younger and more naive than in any other episode.

#14 Johnny Bravo - *** -  decent romantic tale.

#15 The Last Train West - **** -Well done and I've heard itwas a remake.  Could use a scene of Cheyenne breaking out at the beginning, and they probably would've had one, had this been filmed for the 2nd season when the times increased from 40 to 48 minutes (approximately).",1153872000,15,3867,4.93953488372093

But then again-no Maverick.

  As for the actual package, really great to see Clint Walker back in action. The extra profile and interview are really nice additions. Plus the first season has L.Q.Jones(one of my favorite character/supporting actors in westerns).

Sometimes a plot may seem a little well-worn, but most of the time I realize that the movie I am reminded of was made AFTER this first season. Even so, the writing, characters, and action are absolutely topnotch. Cheyenne is a hero in the sense that he reflects the quintessential American: he is big, tough, strong and has a compassion for the weak. He is, above all, honorable and demands justice for himself and all others. Seek his help and he will stay at your side, come hell or high water. But cross him, and he will pound you into the dust.

Sitting through this old series really takes me back. The strange thing is they don't seem dated to me at all. For instance, in one episode the settlers are griping about the ""savages"" and Cheyenne sets them straight by explaining the reason the local tribes don't trust the settlers. It struck me as an unusual trait for its time; to begin setting the story to rights. I plan to buy each season as it comes out to share with my young nephew and my older kids.

2527420,4,B000EQ46H8,"Okay, I'll admit I've only watched three of these so far. But if the rest in the series are like these, I'm onto a winner. I'd never seen Cheyenne before (I think it was relegated to afternoon tv here in New Zealand) - what gets me is how well the episodes are put together. Unlike many hour long shows before the days of multiple storylines, this one doesn't seem padded out (compared with The Big Valley which I purchased at the same time - man, those ones drag). The action moves long at a fair old clip. True, they've taken lots of stock footage from Warner Brothers movies - and even plots are lifted wholesale (Rocky Mountain, Treasure of the Sierra Madre etc etc). But the stock footage, on the whole, blends in quite nicely, and the action scenes shot specially for the show hold up very well (the Indian attack on the mountain fortress in the very first episode is as good as anything you'd find in a B western). Clint Walker may not be the greatest actor, but he exudes honesty and integrity - which is really all that the role requires. And what a roster of guest stars - three episodes down and Ray Teal, James Garner, Robert Wilkie, Rod Taylor, Edward Andrews and John Doucette have all made appearances. I love this set (in case you haven't already guessed). Great, undemanding fun with good production values (while the scripts may not be as classy as Have Gun Will Travel, the production looks one heck of a lot better).  The documentary with Clint Walker is nothing startling, but it's pleasant to see the guy talking about how he got into the show and relating some behind the scenes stories. Picture and audio quality is on the whole excellent. And yes, I got the new slimline packaging, so storage ain't a problem. Well done Warners. can't wait for season two (although was that the one with Ty Hardin after Clint Walker left due to an argument over contracts?).",1152057600,6,1882,4.535294117647059

I remember sneaking out of my bed to watch it from behind the couch, as my parents watched!

Clint Walker was truly the character. Big, strong, bold, honest, and a man of honor! He followed the code of the West. Always fun to see how a big burly man could also lose a fist fight now and then! Kudos to the release of this first season! However, I did miss the theme song, and the separate episodes are only forty minutes in length.

AS a child, I remember playing the record with the theme song over and over!

Years ago, my husband bought me the only two videos available at the time, one with Clint Eastwood as the guest star. IT was one of my favorite gifts ever! (James Garner was also in one of the first three episodes!)

I was a big fan when I was a boy in the 50s when the show first hit television, yes, I'm that old, but let me tell you, they don't make westerns like this anymore.

Cheyenne, the first season, is only the beginning of the iceberg.  The series gets better as the years continue into the 60s, but that's another story.

Cheyenne gives us a great insight into the first years of the Warner Brothers television saga, where it produced several famous western series such as Maverick, The Lawman, Colt .45, Sugarfoot, Bronco and, of course, Cheyenne.

Clint Walker brings real life cowboy lessons to the old west in this series and with the help of many top stars, many of them just beginning to rise, like James Garner, L.Q. Jones and Gerald Mohr the first season was a hit all the way.

Cheyenne lets us follow the exploits of Bodie as he goes through troubles ranging from Indians to ranchers trying to take over the entire range.  And, of course, he always has a kind word for most, but a stern warning for those who cross him.

However, I got the set and I'm watching it, and I have found the following serious issues with it:

1) The episodes only run about 40 minutes long!  This was a 1-hour show, and uncut versions with all the titles and stuff should run ~52 minutes!  What's missing?  Well, the opening credits for one...  I haven't figured out whether the show is cut, or running at a faster speed, or whatever... But for commercial DVD sets of old shows, I really expect them to be uncut!

2) No original theme music!  I guess they couldn't get the rights to it, but the nifty theme music is missing, replaced by a generic theme on the closing credits (and no opening credits at all!).  This show had a real nice theme song, so that's pretty lame!

3) On a couple of the DVDs, it defaults to subtitles in Spanish.  You can turn it off from the options menu, but this to me is a sign of sloppy production -- they didn't even check to make sure the DVD defaults were set up properly!

The packaging is nice -- I like it when they put two single-sided DVDs in the slim cases, and the whole thing in a slip case.  It's my favorite packaging method, because it takes the least space, without being double-sided.

The video transfer and audio quality is also fine (but I'm not very picky about these -- I'm used to 3rd generation VHS...).

Anyway, I like the show, and the episodes themselves are certainly worth watching.  But I'm really disappointed by the shoddy quality.  If you were looking for uncut episodes with the theme music, this isn't it.

EDIT: After reading C. M. Street's comments, I double-checked some of my old first season episodes, and indeed I was mistaken.  Running time of ~40 minutes and no opening theme music seems to be the norm for the first season episodes.  My only remaining gripe then is the sloppy titling (with a default setting to subtitles in Spanish on some disks), but that is a minor point.  This DVD release deserves 5 stars.

The video transfer is not the most ultimately remastered, highest definition transfer on the planet; but was clear and perfectly viewable.

The audio wasn't high definition 5.1 Dolby Surround; but came through loud and clear with the dialogue easily discerned, even for my 50 year old ears.

The stories in the first season of Cheyenne were well written and filmed with high standards.  (Although some of the lines in the stories will make you chuckle and now seem cliched, we must remember this was 50 years ago and they were new then and reflected the current moral climate.)

So while this first season release isn't perfect, it's highly recommended.  What is perfect about Cheyenne, however is the presence of Clint Walker.  Let's face it, Clint Walker is ""Cheyenne""!  He certainly wasn't the greatest actor to ever grace the small screen, but he had a quiet, almost brooding machismo; offering a towering physical presence, combined with an almost gentle elegance.  Honor and dignity oozed from Cheyenne.  (Geeze, sounds like I have a Man Crush on Cheyenne - so be it.)

By the way, the extra features don't abound but there is a nice, recent interview with Clint Walker, wherein he tells the story of how he got into acting and landing the part of Cheyenne.  Clint still comes across as an honest, gentle, caring man.  One of the true nice guys that came out of Hollywood.

To close, let me add that Cheyenne is good wholesome entertainment, filled with stories of honor, redemption and courage.  And believe it or not, the good guys finish first and the bad guys get what they deserve.",1149724800,19,1896,4.763803680981595
2527449,5,B000EQ46H8,"Cheyenne, Cheyenne where will you be traveling tonight. Only man Cheyenne....It simply doesn't get any better than this. Cheyenne was the precursor to Clint Eastwood's ""Man with no Name"" character in Sergio Leone's westerns. Now if Warner Bros. will only release ""Fort Dobbs"" and ""Yellowstone Kelly"" present day audiences will get a chance to see that Clint Walker was ""The Man"". Cheyenne was the baddest and coolest cowboy to ever ride the range of the small screen.",1149552000,10,467,5.077922077922078
