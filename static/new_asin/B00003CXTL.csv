1300032,5,B00003CXTL,Sly plays down on his luck race car driver trying to make a comeback.  This part fits his life at the moment.  Don't miss the scene where he drives through the streets of Las Vegas in a Formula 1 racecar.  Very interesting.,990403200,,223,4.261904761904762
1300033,1,B00003CXTL,"I was looking forward to this movie, but the writing was trite and the action predictable. Save yourself the (money) and wait for the video!",990144000,,140,4.64
1300034,3,B00003CXTL,"I guess this movie is not made for hardcore fans of the CART FedEx Championship or Formula One, but for a broad audience of thrill seeking, movie goers.  One of the real drivers said it best - this is not a documentary.  The real footage is actually more exciting than the fabricated stuff.  The big dissappointment was that the stunt cars they used were very different (CART 101 school cars) from real Champ Cars, and it was quite noticeable.  The antics on-track were very far-fetched, but when all was said and done, it was Rambo Goes Racing, and entertaining.  Stallone is actually very good, and his young student is excellent.  Stallone had unprecedented access to the real racing grids and venues and this shows.  That is the strongest part of the film.  Music is great, cinematography of the real racing and styled sequences are great, but the film really suffers from too many crashes, explosions, and by not being more accurate.  It is fun, but no where close to real.
The best racing film ever made for intrigue, real footage, and accuracy is ""LeMans"" starring Steve McQueen, from 1971.  It is hailed by people inside of real racing as the closest anyone has come to capturing the thrill, drama, and intensity of auto racing.",990144000,,1236,4.733644859813084
1300035,5,B00003CXTL,"I just saw the movie yesterday in the theater...  am still on the adrenaline high I got from watching it.  Yeah, the reviews say - it's terrible - and the story is kinda lame but the movie is a racing lover's dream come true - the sound, the race sequences, the crashes - the different race tracks - when I left the theater, I was driving a 110 mph for a few seconds before I forced myslef to leave the highway for fear of killing myself!!!
Can hardly wait for the DVD, this one will push your amp to its fullest and boy, will those surrounds and sub be abused!!!!!
Go see it!",989798400,2,576,4.088495575221239
1300036,5,B00003CXTL,"This movie was awesome.  Car racing movies can't get much better than this.  When Gone In 60 Seconds came out, everyone booed at the movie for having the stupidest plot.  People...  We watch these kind of movies for fun~  It's not a movie that makes you think and you can obviously tell that from the trailer.  Anyways, Driven had some spectacular racing/crash scenes that everyone in the theater said ""WHOA~!"" and I can see why Stallon was proud to write this movie.  The movie also focuses on Stallon's real life, which was very nicely done.  If you like car movies, this one is a MUST SEE.  10 out of 10",989193600,,606,4.4363636363636365
1300037,4,B00003CXTL,"Look, I know this movie is not awesome.  But it's chock full of some really good action sequences, like the car chase in Chicago.  Add some great music pumping in the background (songs by Filter, Tantric, Vertical Horizon to name a few), and I was clamoring for more.
The acting is average at best, and some of the dialogue is pathetic to be quite frank.  However, the pace of the film and some of the action helped me to overlook some of the flaws in this film.
If you like Days of Thunder and Gone in 60 Seconds, you will probably like this one.  It is not nearly as good a movie as Days of Thunder, but gives you more of a Gone in 60 feel (no real story but great action).  If you are one of those people that only want to see a thought-provoking movie, you will give this movie one star.  As a fan of both thought-provoking movies and mindless action movies, I actually enjoyed this one.  3 and 1/2 stars...",989193600,,911,4.2011494252873565
1300038,5,B00003CXTL,"...  I thought DRIVEN was a suspenseful thrill ride from beginning to end.  I thought we saw some fine acting from Stallone but the real star of this movie was young Kip Pardue (Jimmy Bly) I think he stole the show... I have been waiting anxiously for DRIVEN's arrival in theatres and the wait was well worth while.  The intensity and message of the movie was addicting and I encourage others to see it, as I will, AGAIN, and AGAIN, and AGAIN!",989020800,,443,4.378048780487805
1300039,2,B00003CXTL,"What is it about racing movies that turn directors into ADD-afflicted goons?  Renny Harlin has made much better movies, with far more of an attention span, not to mention a better hold on their emotional core.  Instead, it almost appears that this film was made by a graduate of the Michael Bay School of Hyper-Editing.  The fact that this film is slightly more in-depth then your average sports film (though not by much) gets completely lost in all the hubbub.
Yes, the characters and situations are entirely off-the-shelf.  We often forget that there's a reason they're up there:  sometimes, they work.  Instead of simply leaving the cliches as-is, screenwriter/star Stallone takes them in a few new and interesting directions, and it's not really as predictable as you would think from any description you would hear.  Yes, there's a pushy agent.  He's the young hotshot's brother, though, and is pushy because he really does care.  Will the girl choose the young hero/hotshot, or go back to her ex?  If you can find your way into all of this, you'd be a bit surprised how well Stallone bends the rules.
Cutting through the gloss, though, is the big problem.  Director Harlin edits like he's in a race with the afore-mentioned Bay, throwing in nifty point-of-view shots that merely serve to distract, even (especially?) in the dramatic scenes.
That's not to say that none of this works.  There's an amusing chase through the streets of Chicago that re-capture the fun of some of Harlin's previous films, and the final race is cleverly shot.  If I had come in at the beginning of said race and stayed until the end, I might have figured the movie could have been worth my while.  And I would almost have been right.
Almost.",988588800,2,1725,4.783783783783784
1300040,2,B00003CXTL,"The latest movie from Sly takes us in the direction that we are all supposed to believe that he is a F1 racer. Now a washup (what a cliche) he is called upon to assist a new racer in winning the championship. The whole problem is that Sly is too defiant to follow the rules.
The movie is directed by Renny Harlin, a man famous for blowing things up. This film affords him the opportunity of crashing numerous cars. Something that he makes full use of. This movie is supposed to be a twisted romance movie, with the occasional race thrown into keep the whitetrash at bay. The fact is that the racing action is all that any of the audience will care about, so why bother with a romantic theme.
This is a movie that does not need to have any sort of plot, but the film maker tries to make you care about every race, and every character. The real fact is that by the time of the big final race, you just do not care who wins, since you do not feel an honest connection to any of these characters. All this audience wants from these people are for them to get in their cars and drive around in a circle really fast, and to see them crash.
This film had a lot of potential, it does have a rotten washed up actor, but the director can do much better. It may be the fact that Sly wrote the screenplay, but the movie just feels disconnected in some way. There should be more to it (not much more, it is about racing, but something, anything) and when nothing is put in place, this movie starts to fall apart on itself.",988243200,2,1509,4.15358361774744
1300041,1,B00003CXTL,"Just caught a pre-screening of this on my campus, and I'll be damned if this isn't one of the worst things I've seen in a while. Stallone wrote the script, but far be it from the glory of Rocky. Remember Stallone, a big budget does not a good movie make. Awful, awful, awful. I want to sue Stallone for two hours of my life that I lost watching this. Stallone actually had a decent idea for a sports movie. Instead of the young rookie, old-timer who helps him out, and the villainous arch-rival common in sports movies, we get interesting variations on these basic characters. The rookie is the typical hotshot type, but the interesting ones COULD have been Stallone and the arch rival. Stallones character is an old-timer called back to help the rookie, but feels disrespected by the owner played by Burt Reynolds (Is it just me or does reynolds have more makeup on than Gina Gershon?). He has this desire to win, though this is dropped as the story prgresses, avoiding a potentially interesting plot. The rival is a German hotshot champion who is an incredibly insecure and sensitive guy behind his tough exterior. This character is much more original than most sports movie baddies, but his character is pushed to the side in favor of chintzy (and laughably bad) FX and dialogue. The story devolves quickly into a ""Beautiful People Doing Dangerous Things"" type flick and SUCKS. If Stallone had taken the idea of three different people all with different reasons for trying to win he could have made an interesting movie about the trials of competition and the tolls it takes on those competing. Ineptitude abounds though, and the cheese is so thick I felt my arteries clogging. It's filmed like a bad soap opera and written like an even worse one.
Oh and for those who will go anyway for the ""cool crashes"",the crashes are all computer generated and look like they were created using Atari.",988070400,4,1893,4.704819277108434

1300333,3,B00003CXTL,"One of stallone's most average films is about Car racing
with the screenplay written by sylvester stallone & Directed by Renny Harlin
the film turns out to be entertaining at best, the screenplay is Good but not excellent
i can say that the Car racing scenes are Directed brilliantly, Great work from Renny Harlin for sure
so Good screenplay but the Directing is better, brilliant infact
Burt reynolds Gives a Great performance aswell

well Warner bros has finally released this film on blu-ray with a new HD transfer
which does look very sharp & clear picture quality in 2:40:1 widescreen plus a new 5.1 master audio mix
so the picture & sound quality is much much better than the old dvd version for sure
about the special features
there are no new extras that's for sure, i would've been surprised if WB got a new interview with Sly or Renny Harlin about this film
all the same extras from the very old dvd release have been carried over that's all
which are Behind the scenes featurettes-
MAKING OF DRIVEN, CONQUERING SPEED THROUGH LIVE ACTION & VISUAL EFFECTS
plus DELETED SCENES with optional commentary by Sylvester stallone
there's about 51mins of Deleted scenes that are given new HD transfers which i've checked out
 and found out when watching them that some of these scenes could've been left in the film to make the storyline more interesting actually
i guess Sylvester was having alot of Arguments with the Warner bros executives about the film's very long runtime
so 51mins had to be cut out of the finally film version
the Theatrical cut goes for 117mins so maybe another 20mins of scenes would've been better for the storyline
there's also the usual DVD commentary from Renny Harlin aswell

so the only difference is the new HD transfer & 5.1 master mix, both the dvd & blu-ray have the same special features
so either buy the new blu-ray for much better picture quality or stay with the old dvd version
maybe 3 stars for the film, 3 stars for the blu-ray",1437091200,2,1972,4.677233429394812
1300334,3,B00003CXTL,"Stallone is not the main focus of this film. He unlike Jim Garner, Paul Newman or Steve McQueen is not closely associated with motor racing. He looks like just a gratuitous and random Hollywood star thrown into the mix to bolster the box office.

He does not seem very credible as a race driver. The story is not strong. There is however one good scene where Stallone does this stunt where he puts a stack of quarters on the track and picks them up from behind the wheel while negotiating a four wheel drift. It looks quite impossible and I wouldn't believe it possible except that I know that it is a recreation of a real stunt often performed by Fangio in the sixties.

If you don't know who Fangio was you're not likely to care for this film.",1436054400,2,745,4.35251798561151
1300335,1,B00003CXTL,"Before I trash this film, I'll suggest if you want a really great film about auto-racing, try ""Heart Like a Wheel"". 1000% better than this trash.

This movie seems like it was concocted by a boardroom of studio executives going down a laundry list of stereotypical interests of young and relatively uneducated sex-starved males in their late teens and early 20's who live in the outback of culture. They dig fast cars, scantily-clad women, ESPN auto-racing, and the cheapest beer available. They have no style, no culture, and the only thing better than sex is more sex. Oh yeah, and they love to see cars smashed to smithereens in every conceivable way. They're the kind of people whose highest cultural aspirations are ""The Man's Show"", ""Spring Break"", and ""Survivor"". They probably think ""Dawson's Creek"" and ""Beverly Hills 90210"" to be way too high-brow. In short, they're mooks. That's for whom this movie was produced. Not you? Better look elsewhere (and please do).

So, the result is: let's put all that stuff into a single movie. Make a ridiculously contrived story (if story it can be called) with lots of cars, young women, car smashes, young women, cars, more young women, more cars, and more car smashes. Oh, did I mention the cars? We'll get Sylvester Stallone to write the script and star, and the director of Die Harder to direct. It'll be a sure hit. How can it miss? All the polling says that males this age love this kind of thing. Cars and sex. We're not here to actually make movies that have a shred of originality. We're here to get kids to pay to go to the movie theatre so we can continue to live in our Beverly Hills mansions and drive our Bentleys. What happens on-screen is largely irrelevant as long as they've paid for their tickets. They can even leave if they want. In the end, we get the dough.

Stallone plays the old racing has-been who has to deal with the young rookie upstart who thinks he's the next thing since Mario Andretti. Of course, long before it happened, I knew the rookie was going to be put in his place by having some terrible race, and the mentor-ship relationship was going to going to kick in where the old guy teaches the new guy. I saw that one coming before I entered the theater. This is movie-by-the-numbers. I'm sure you could pick one up at a hobby store for about $8.00.

And of course there's a clich manage a trois. Rookie dumps supermodel, then she goes out with the current racing champion who is about as caring and understanding as the Joker. The champion is a complete you-know-what, probably learning how to be a good lover from Bluto (of Popeye). Now the rookie has something to prove to get the model back, especially away from the jerk. Oh brother. Suggestion: What if the rookie dumped the supermodel for the champ? At least that would have been unexpected. But of course that would have gone against everything this movie is about: contrived clich for the mooks.

All I can say is this: if you're a mook, this is definitely the movie for you. Buy all the cheap beer you want, order 16 Pizza Hut pizzas, and then turn on this movie after you're finished watching ESPN auto-racing. It doesn't getting any better than this. And it won't.",1433462400,2,3209,4.603146853146853

1300338,1,B00003CXTL,"This is definitely one of Sylvester Stallone's worst movies.  He had a string of bombs going in the late 1990's into the early 2000's and this one is almost unwatchable.  The whole idea of only 2 drivers winning every race in the highly competitive CART series is ridiculous. Especially when you have 30 other cars in a typical field of every race.

The movie lacks any of the true suspense and feel of auto racing.  As a viewer I did not feel like I was watching an exciting movie about race cars going 200 MPH just a sappy drama of who was sleeping with who. Therefore the film itself has an identity crisis of what it is trying to be.  Watching a movie like Days of Thunders is pure Hollywood but at least gives off the feel of what it is like to be a driver of a stock car and all the craziness that the team goes through as well as the driver.  This film focuses on none of the mechanic crew who actually keep the cars running.  There seemed to be no montage of different tracks and countries that the drivers race in.

It felt like there was no chemistry at all between Stallone and Kip Pardue, as a veteran driver helping a younger driver learn the ropes.  Til Schweiger does not even make much of a villain.  I have seen B movie films much more exciting that this.

Finally if you want to see a Race car movie done right watch the Ron Howard film RUSH.  It is far and away more realistic than this film.

Another thing I found it very far fetched in the scene where Indy cars are driving on the open street with all the potholes and natural unleveled roads, that car would have bottomed out and crashed into something fairly quickly costing thousands of dollars worth of damage.

Overall this movie is an insult to bargain bins and should be outlawed for wasting the viewers time. I got a fine for taking this movie back to the video store late and after a few minutes later I thought to myself the video store should have paid me money just to watch this film, it is that bad.",1432166400,2,1985,4.258666666666667

1300642,4,B00003CXTL,"Before saying anything else, I must immediately precise that I know next to nothing about car races and therefore, if there are inaccuracies about this subject in this film (and it seems there are) I was simply unable to notice them. But frankly, I prefer it that way, because I rather liked this little unsophisticated, relaxing, gentle ""feel good"" film.

Made in 2001 and directed by Renny Harlin (who also made the excellent ""Deep Blue Sea"") ""Driven"" was Stallone's pet project. He wrote the scenario and produced the film and of course also played in it - but he willingly took much less time screen than could be expected. There are many more or less famous faces appearing in this film and they were given quite a lot of place.

Burt Reynolds is of course the greatest star playing Carl Henry, a ruthless, efficient (and wheel-chair riding) owner of a renowned racing team. His team has a chance to win this year World Series thanks to an incredibly gifted rookie Jimmy Bly (played by a little known actor, Kip Pardue) - but as this young man shows signs of instability, Henry brings back to the team a veteran driver Joe Tanto (Stallone) to mentor and assist him. In the meantime the current world champion, Beau Brandenbourg (Til Schweiger), upset by his recent defeats, breaks in a very mean way with his gorgeous girlfriend Sophia (Estella Warren).

In significant second roles we can also see Gina Gershon as Tanto's ex-wife, Christian de la Fuente as her new husband and Robert Sean Leonard (later to become famous as Wilson in ""House, M.D"") as Bly's older brother.

The film tells the story of World Series races but also of tensions and conflicts between people mentioned above.

Although it can certainly not be considered as a masterpiece or even a major film, I was suprised by the amount of ""flak"" this movie received (and keeps receiving) on every conceivable web page I could find. Me personally, I rather liked it and I found some moments very endearing - especially the ending. I also found that Henry, Tanto and Brandebourg were all pretty interesting characters.

I was also very impressed by the scene in which Estella Warren (who, before being an actress, used to be an olympic level swimmer) gives to her boyfriend (lucky little ba..ard!) a personal show of synchronic natation - and a little bit more. And frankly, I never imagined, that a girl can say ""Ribbit, ribbit"" in such a sexy way...

For me the great quality of this film was its ""feel good"" character - when the credits started to roll, I felt pretty relaxed and I was smiling. OK, may be it was a silly smile, but still - I spend a nice moment watching it. And I found the races very interesting and pretty dramatic and finally I am quite happy that I was unable to notice what was wrong with them.

It is a nice, soothing, gentle, relaxing, a little bit silly but quite entertaining film, very much adapted to watch with your wife or girlfriend. Enjoy!",1359936000,,2942,4.655105973025048

This is just not a good movie.",1328313600,,311,3.9516129032258065
1300647,2,B00003CXTL,"...but it can be hard to find sometimes. I remember, when it first appeared in theaters, some friends called it ""Rocky on wheels."" That, it definitely is not. More of Stallone's story filtered through in Rocky. Here, I have the impression that half of the story was jettisoned for ""slowing down the action.""

For there is plenty of action. The speed and horror of crashing are well communicated, as is - strangely enough - the simple thrill of racing. Harlin does a good job with the action sequences, making the moment of impact truly impressive. Racing relies so much on instinct rather than preplanned thought; the pit crew and support staff can only prepare and plan so much - the race still revolves around the driver. Racing is an old sport, and any tried-and-true fans who rent or buy this film hoping accurate, down-to-the-nub details will be disappointed. Harlin and Stallone take plenty of dramatic license. The famous chase through the streets of Chicago? Come on. While obviously something like that would never happen, I understand that Harlin and Stallone were trying to communicate the rage of a rejected young man in a unique and forceful manner. I can allow for that; but the chase went on far too long, almost as though it were enjoying the spectacle for its own sake. Don't say you weren't warned.

Still, in between the racing montages and the overly-loud boom-boom music, there are some good parts. Robert Sean Leonard of ""House"" fame turns a really great performance. Stallone is strangely given little to do - the story of his character, Joe Tanto, is truncated, giving the impression that is where a lot of cutting happened so the film focuses more on Jimmy Bly (a suitably intense Kip Pardue). This is unfortunate, because I speculate that it is Tanto's back-story that is the real catalyst for the final climatic race. Certain elements of the story felt forced as a result. Our introduction to Joe Tanto happens with little warning or preamble, and exactly why Carl Henry (Burt Reynolds) thought Tanto could help the situation is never clearly stated. Stallone is perfectly cast as the old veteran with a few good races left in him; but , save for the ending, all his character does is dispense advice throughout the film. We see his impact on others, but never really see the impact of events on him.

And this is ultimately what drags Driven down: is it about Bly (Pardue) or Tanto (Stallone)? They assembled some good young acting talent, had Stallone ready to play the embattled-but-charming man of wisdom, had Burt Reynolds ready to chew up any scenery he was given. What was 'wrong' in the '80s for Stallone was 'right' for this movie: if it was more about his character, Joe Tanto, his relationship with Carl Henry (Reynolds), and the changes Tanto had to make to help a younger driver and allow himself to get back a little dignity, suddenly you'd have a pretty good film on your hands. Instead, what we have is an assemblage of racing montages with fragments of a story in between - a real wasted opportunity.",1315094400,,3044,4.761363636363637
1300708,3,B00003CXTL,good fun action packed movie about indy cars.  stallone shines as the older veteran driver brought in by burt reynolds to help teach a young up and comer to settle down a bit and just win races.  good light hearted movie with a good ending and some twists and turns.,1305676800,,266,4.3
1300709,1,B00003CXTL,"I'm glad I'm not the only one who found this movie ridiculously boring and ill-paced.  I'm also glad that Kip Pardue has disappeared from film, since his presence was an ink stain on anything he graced.  He is just so dull.  This flick doesn't do him any favors.  Sure, the racing sequences are exciting, but they are all so overdone and glossy that they lose their edge and become preposterous eye-soars.  The remainder of the cast is also a mess.  Estella Warren makes a pretty bland romantic interest.  She's cute enough, but she's also ridiculously dull.  Sylvester Stallone has never been `talented' in this area, and he doesn't bring any of the glimmers of promise he mustered out of that overrated 1976 boxing flick.  Instead, he grumbles through this film as if he was merely tolerating it.  The only shimmer of light comes from a predictably catty Gina Gershon who is always a delight, regardless of the fact that she can't seem to play more than one shade of character.  In the end, this tiresome bore is far from worth the price of admission.  This is easily one of the worst films 2001 had to offer, and that's saying a lot considering that the year also birthed such travesties as `Glitter', `Jurassic Park III', `Swordfish' and `The One'.",1300320000,,1252,4.692660550458716
1300710,5,B00003CXTL,Whether you like NASCAR or whether you like Indy Car racing you're gonna love this movie!,1277337600,,89,4.625
1300711,2,B00003CXTL,"""Driven"" wanted to be two films at once: it wanted to be a self-enlightened human movie and it wanted to be an extreme, stylized racing film.  It hardly succeeded on being either.  The dramatic portions are a cliched joke, the races themselves are riddled with bad CG effects and weird camera shots, and in fact trying to juggle these two aspects only left the film with a state of misshapen identity.  I doubt the pitch of 'Rocky on Wheels' actually worked in the long run, since he's not really the focus of the entire film anyway.

The story is about Jimmy Bly (Kip Pardue), a rising driver with mental constants that limited him from pushing to the edge, so a wheelchair-bound Burt Reynolds hired his former driver/ally Joe Tonto (Stallone) to be Bly's advisor.  Being the mentor, he helped Bly with driving assistance as well as making hammy speeches about finding one's true passion; that might've worked in ""Rocky Balboa"", but the speeches don't work here.  While on his path to win the championship, Bly also got involved in a goofy love triangle between his thick-accented racing rival Beau, played by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/That-One-Basterd/dp/B002T9H2L0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">That One Basterd</a>, and the rival's fiance Sophia.  It got way too personal with itself that the story is actually corny.

Even if the movie's selling point are the races themselves, the races are also poorly-done due to questionable directions.  During the races, the movie had perspective shots like cameras suddenly zooming into racer's faces, 360 degrees shots of the cars, first-person view with 'blur effects' and they're all poorly implemented; I do, however, like that behind-the-shoulder perspective on the drivers. The special effects involved in these races are obvious, and the crashes are so ridiculous, they make the speedway disaster from ""The Final Destination"" look realistic. It had a crash when the car's tires flew up in close-up slow-motion and they land towards the bleachers, but more absurd is that one big crash where a car flew in the air, get knocked by several cars, jump around, explodes, and then the gas leak lit the car in flames; I know the hardcore F1/Indy fans would point out the film's other inaccuracies that I didn't notice, but I know the latter crash is more suited for a ""Burnout"" game.

Renny Harlin tries to make an action film out of racing, and they look phony as a result. But those crash scenes are nothing compared to what I think has one of the dumbest chase sequences in movie history: Tonto and Bly riding on indy cars towards a busy traffic. First off, the indy cars have incredibly horse power and massive speed, and Tonto was going after Bly when there's lots of cars and civilians on the path, not to mention lots of turns. These two couldn't maintain such a hectic speed without making head-on collisions with vehicles, walls, or running over people; they should've crashed the second they got on the road. Nevermind how cheap the car effects look, how this even began is impractical. Bly got involved in a complicated romantic situation and in rage goes full throttle; he's putting countless lives and property in danger because he's being selfish, and he didn't think of venting his frustrations at home or ride dangerously on an empty track?  Even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Speed-Racer/dp/B001CD6FKI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Speed Racer</a>&nbsp;road rage on an empty track, and that's even more zanier than this movie. It's unrealistic, silly, and unnecessary.

Sometimes, ""Driven"" can be either moodless or nauseating.  The nausea occurs when there's not any races going on, since the film still tried to be stylistic by adding jump cuts and scene fades during public interviews and crowd shots; I know they're suppose to convey a sense of anxiety, but they're so frequent they became dizzying.  Besides the absurd touches added to the races, the races on their own are nothing special.  I didn't care about the characters, the song choices are uneven raging from a Fatboy Slim track to a sappy love ballad, and the movie just tried way too hard to be edgy.  As a result, it fell flat on the pavement.",1277078400,,4260,5.170058139534884
1300712,1,B00003CXTL,"I am giving this movie one star simply because there is no option available to give it less. Surely a more inaccurate, half-baked, cliched or pathetic storyline has ever been conceived by anyone over the age of four. The acting is attrocious with even Burt Reynolds thinly disguised portrayal of the Frank Williams style character being forced and by the numbers. The thought that you can slide an Indycar around on the bitumen like a Sprintcar picking up coins in your slick rear tyres that were deposited on the track the previous lap is mind-boggling. The fact that we are expected to believe this garbage is an insult. All this is supposedly happening on a street circuit through the city that has been closed for a private practice session. Lets not forget the flaming Indycars flying through the air and landing in ponds or the two Indycars chasing each other through city traffic at night throwing manhole covers at their opponents unhelmeted heads.

Another appealing aspect was that the three lead characters were all good guys. There are annoying ""bad people"" in the movie but they are all minor characters.

The ending is predictable and, yes, there are some of the typical things you see and hear in many Sylvester Stallone films but not as dumb as many of them (the bad ones, that is.)

Because of the superlative visuals and audio, this is a good movie to see on a nice TV and a nice surround system. Mine are okay but I can imagine what this would look and sound like on something really good.",1233964800,,819,4.446666666666666

The whole idea that a guy would dump a young talent just because he didn't win the championship in his first year is ludicrous.  The ancillary story about Estella Warren and her switching between Bly and Brandenburg is not at all compelling, and then aside from that there seem to be not a few but several auxiliary plots that are only hinted at but never fleshed out, (Tanto's ex-wife, Memo's distress at losing his job, what happened to Tanto's career, etc.)  The dialogue is just atrocious with lines such as, ""YOU DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE ANYMORE!"" and, ""Joe, you never crawl!"" Maybe you think you can forget all of that stuff and just watch the racing scenes?  Nope, they suck too, because it seems the only way they could think of to make them exciting was to have ridiculously overwrought crashes that would never happen in real life.  But the most ridiculous scene comes at the very end where suddenly Jimmy Bly pulls away from Brandenburg on a straightaway just because he suddenly realizes how much he loves racing.  The only three reasons anybody might want to watch this movie are:
1.  The racing through the streets scene is cool if you don't take it seriously (which shouldn't be too hard considering how awful this film is)
2. The music is really good.

More adult tastes will be left wondering what happened to subtlety ,characterisation and dialogue of more than monosyllables. When compared to more adult pictures on the same topic ,such as Grand Prix ,it falls short in these key areas.

Stallone ,who also co-wrote and co-produced the movie ,plays Joe ,a veteran driver called out of retirement by Team owner Burt Reynolds to act as mentor and guide to a hotshot young driver whose pursuit of the Formula One title is being hamstrung by his inability to deal with mounting pressure from the media and his own brother.the current champion -a hotshot German, Brandenburg(clearly modelled on Michael Schumaker)
The racing sequences are noisy and visceral but not exceptional ; acting is basic although Reynolds does infuse his character with some depth (no thanks to the script ) and there is a good performance  from Gena Gershon also .

1300752,1,B00003CXTL,"In his first solo-writing credit since Rocky V, Sylvester Stallone cannot get this plodding drama, with the backdrop of CART open-wheel-racing, out of neutral.

Stallone portrays a former open-wheel champion, Joe Tanto, who is brought onto a team to drive a second car and tutor hot-shot racer, Jimmy Bly (Kip Pardue); a star in the making, but whose ego is tossing away a golden opportunity for a title run and - perhaps - a career in the sport.

Banal dialogue and a generic script - which could have been dropped into any setting - ruins the unprecedented access the producers had to the CART series. The technology oftentimes takes a secondary role to scenes which makes racing look like a demolition derby at the county fair.

After seeing the film, top CART driver, Cristiano da Matta, joked that his car was always involved in spectacular wrecks. There was great potential to develop a film that would challenge the racing classics - Le Mans and Grand Prix - for the front row on the starting grid.

Much like Get Carter and Connagher, this is a movie for mature audiences - mature enough to understand such virtues as duty and honor even though we find we have failed to attain them.

But since we all know more about race cars than about manliness, is it any wonder this movie receives such low ratings?  In our time, maturity itself barely rates 1 star.",1187308800,,598,4.5

If you can get past the plot and average acting then you're left with the racing action.  While I'll admit some of the special effects were gripping I couldn't enjoy them because they were so unrealistic.  As many others have pointed out the type of fuel used doesn't burn yellow it burns clean and blue.  There is NO way that downtown race could or WOULD ever have happened.  Oh and back to the plot.  Are we really expected to believe only two people were capable of winning from week to week AND that Carl (Burt Reynolds) was ready to fire a kid who WON FIVE RACES in his rookie season?  You have got to be kidding me!  You can win the darn championship with only one win!  It's about the points (at least in NASCAR it is.)  Anyway, the movie was just bad, bad, bad...I wish it wasn't.

It has the feel it was taken from some cardboard outline drafted by a screenwriter on his lunch break. Direction is also at a bare minimum, but this is a trend that we are seeing more frequently with more recent action oriented films. Directors are taking a back seat to the editors and this film seems to be definitely editor-driven. Digital editing is a tool and like every tool it is only as good as the hand using it. It is good to see Sylvester Stallone and Burt Reynolds in the same movie but this should have and could have been a much better film.

1300810,1,B00003CXTL,"In his recently, (and miraculously) published book entitled ""Sly Moves"", Sylvestor Stalone talks about what is needed to acheive one's dream, what he did to acheive his, what he eats, and how he does sit ups...everything the 9 people in this country who admire him need to know to understand what makes him tick, and how he came to be what he is.

One thing he leaves out, however, is which minor demon he sold his soul to, in order to maintain enough influence in Hollywood to continue having movies he write and stars in produced...movies, such as Driven, which include Sly's own screenplay, in which his imagination brought such lines to the screen as,

""What am I? A piece of wood?""

and...

""I was raised by frogs. Ribbit. Ribbit.""

These two examples being the best lines in the entire film, I will not mention any more of them..they only get worse.

Driven is a film Sly obviously wrote a while back...called Rocky. Being the master of the cut and paste technique that is the mish mash of Hollywood tripe that some attempt to call movies, Stalline has simply transposed that story into the world of racing...at least his version of it.

The story goes he wanted to set this movie in the world of formula one racing, but the wise folks there said ""no way"", thereby making history as those who dodged the biggest bullet in the history of humankind.

It then became necessary for Sly to base his ""rookie with a lack of confidence, until he meets the old mentor who challenges him"" story on a racing world more suited with the level of reality depicted in same. The ideal choice would have been the land of Mario Kart, on the Nintendo 64. But they too said that his planned stunts and dialogue were just a bit too fanciful...so he settled on the now defunct world of CART racing.

Not that it matters, as in addition his script of any semblence of plot, dramatic tension, dialogue, symbolism, social significance, or remotley adequate editing, Stallone has also gotten rid of any need to include such concepts as gravity and the space-time continuem in his movie.

Yes, the movie is so abysmal that even the fundmental laws of nature that hold the actual universe itself together are neglected, as race cars running at two hundred miles an hour plus are lightly tipped by another car, only to instantly sail into a wall, flip over said wall, and gather enough momentum, ex nihlio to sammersalt aproximatley 1400 feet into the air, and then slow down while descending back towards the race track, where all of the rest of the cars, and the crowd continue to respond to the action in regular time as we know it in this dimension.

Moving ever downward, our driver floats ever so close to another car, (which by this time has inexplicably traveled around the track at least once while the victim was still in the air), and eventually is nudged in mid air by said car. The car on the ground continues, at normal speed to drive down the track, while our hero of this, the most assinine car related sequence ever filmed once again flies up into the air another several hundred feet, bursts into flames, soars out of the stadium, catching nearby trees on fire, before landing, face down in a nearby lake....while leaking fuel of course...leading us to theoretically fear that he will drown, or the whole lake will burst into flames, and ignite the nearby daycare center ablaze. (Only ONE of these ridiculous actions was made up by me. Watch the movie, if you dare, to find out which one.)

The resolution of this scene is even stupider than that, and this was the best part of the entire hackneyed, uninspired, bloated, pretentious and obviously supernaturally conceived drek.

Even the T&A in this film is not done correctly...as our hero speeds down the streets of Chicago in a RACE car, it blows up the skirt of an unsuspecting 20 something hottie on the street, revealing her hindquarters covered not in a firey red thong, but the largest, thickest, whitest set of granny panties the world has ever known. Only  a movie connected with Sly Stallone would attempt gratutious T&A, (and I do mean gratuitous) and forget to include the ""A"".

Even worse is Sly's commentary track for the deleted scenes, in which he sounds convinced that he has in fact written one of the most profound and history changing screenplays since Citizen Kane...meadering endlessly on about motivations, plot devices, back story and character development that is not so much as even hinted at in the action of this so called ""film"".

Stallone is a pompous, self congratulatory, has-been hack of a loser who should, for the sake of our children, be granted no more studio money to fund so much as a Kleenex commericial to which his name as a screen writer or actor is attached.

I really enjoy this movie, I've seen it a dozen times and it doesn't have the pretention to revolutionnize the film industry, but it's certainly a very good entertainment. The actors are all great.

Aside from the fact that none of the actors could perform their way out of old paper bags, the movie moves at such a rapid pace that it almost makes you dizzy.

And now for the degree of realism.  I understand that not all car races are electrifying, but I see no reason for there to be a spectacular crash every single race.  And I have never in 18 years of watching IndyCar races seen a car go flying off the track and into a water hazard.  THAT'S WHY THE BARRIERS ARE THERE.  Also, those IndyCars are aerodynamically designed so that if the track turned upside-down, the cars would stay glued to the course, yet they fly off the ground in this movie like they were made out of tissue paper.  And good lord, the joyride through Chicago was THE stupidest scene in the whole movie.  It would be an interesting scene aside from the fact that INDYCARS CAN'T START BY THEMSELVES.

Of course, you are also treated to lots of crash scenes with stuff flying around, junk landing on spectators, things bursting into flames, and even a car that flys off and somehow ends up landing in a pond.

The thing that elevates Driven above all of that is that, with all of it's cheesiness, it is still entertaining.  If you like special effects you will love this movie.  There are some really great computer generated effects that include: showing how the cars crash together, some decent tunnel vision stuff from the POV of the driver, and a really cool effect that shows the rain drops hitting the drivers visor and being pushed off by air currents.  There is also an extra on the DVD of a particular scene that was cut, which included a car blowing up completely - created entirely by computer.  It is a morph technology, and the scene looks great.

A friend said that this was a good movie. I knew he smoked a lot of pot, but I didn't know he smoked that much.
It starts with ridiculous racing footage. There are absolutely no laws of physics that apply to these cars. Suddenly whenever a car wants to catch up with the one in front he magically gets about a 300 shot of nitrous for more horsepower to instantly catch up and then cannot pull away.
Cars are constantly crashing and bursting into flames. Bright yellow flames, which cannot happen at any professional level because methanol burns blue.
There are absolutely no safety personnel at any of the tracks, so the drivers have to stop from 200 mph in about 50 feet to save the other driver in danger, nevermind that they would be lucky to stop within 500 feet in real life.

1300862,1,B00003CXTL,"I have been a fan of open wheel racing for a very long time and this movie just doesn't do the sport justice. First the plot is lame. It's pretty much a remake of Days of Thunder.  (I kept looking for Tom Cruise.)  You know, young hot shot gets help from crusty older man. Young hot shot meets girl, young hot shot gets girl. (Oh excuse me, Stalone's character gets girl, since he wrote the movie & is the star.)
Stalone sniffed around Formula I for a season and they refused his offer to make a movie.  Initially, I was disapointed, but now I see they made the right decision.  Then he hung around Cart for a year.  Obviously, he was too busy playing the celeb to really pay attention to the sport.
Besides, the plot that's been done before, let me tell you technically what's wrong with the movie.
1.  A lot of the in-car shots are sped up. You really don't need that in these cars, they're quite exciting enough, thank you.
2.  You see flames from fires when cars crash. Cart/Champ cars burn methanol, it burns clear, you don't see flames.
3.  I remember at least 2 crashes where cars end up in water. I can't remember when I've seen a crash in Champ, Cart or Formula 1 where anyone has ended up in the water!!!!
4.  Oh, and while the cars are in the water, they're on fire.  I've already mentioned that you can't see methanol when it burns and do you know how you put out a methanol fire?  With water!!!
5.  Plus the crashes themselves are just too over the top. About once a year you'll get a crash where a car will fly through the air like these seem to have done every time.
If you want a good race movie go get a VHS copy of Gran Prix or Le Mans. (I don't think they have been put out on DVD yet. Too bad.) Or if you want some lighthearted car action, then get Days of Thunder or Gumball Rally. There is nothing about this film to recommend it!!!!!!",1043107200,14,1857,4.170868347338936

Sly was pretty cool in the film and it seemed like a movie where Sly steps down from the hero and top action star. This movie is Highly Recommended. Pick one up.",1030147200,,399,4.194805194805195
1300920,1,B00003CXTL,"If you have ever enjoyed racing, specifically CART/IRL/F1 racing, this film will actually make you laugh out loud and shake your head in wonderment.  There are enough holes in this film that it begins to resemble Swiss cheese.
Where to start?  The characters are all familiar, as you've seen them in just about every racing movie (not to mention any other kind of sporting movie)...  I'm guessing Sly was cribbing from the Cliff Notes version of ""Days of Thunder"".
As for the problems with the ""racing footage"", let's just touch on a few things that will make you want to tear your hair out.
-In one of the opening racing scenes, the ""rookie"" is trying to pass for the lead, and right before he touches tires with another car, the crew chief's laptop screen (in the pits) starts flashing ""WARNING""...  Leading the crew chief to exclaim ""NOT AGAIN!"".  I, for one, was unaware that racing car telemetry warned the pit crew that the driver is about to collide with another car.  :)
-In just about EVERY racing scene, you will find a driver ""about to pass"" another car, and then a shot in the footbox of the car showing the driver suddenly flooring the throttle...  Like the driver was twaddling around in second place running at part-throttle on a high-speed straightaway.  SURE.
-Amazingly, only two drivers are winning any races...  The aging current champion and the rookie.  Nobody else seems capable of winning, a totally preposterous idea if you know anything about CART.
-If you are enough of a fan to tell the difference between various open-wheel racing cars will be endlessly irritated by the switching between real CART cars and the ""stand-in"" cars for the action sequences, which were Indy Lights cars and other mockups, if I am not too much mistaken.
-Absurd action sequences involve the oft-mentioned 180-deg turn to go back and save a driver submerged in a pond, the racing through the streets scene (seen this in Days of Thunder, perhaps?), cars racing UNDERNEATH other airborne cars in crash scenes, etc.  Maddening.
-Astonishingly overdone and comically exaggerated crash sequences obviously meant to appeal to the lowest common denominator of audiences.
Other problems with the film:
-Trite dialogue that should insult anyone with anything more than a room-temperature IQ.  ""Brotherhood of Speed""?  OMG, does it get any worse than THIS?
-The ""One driver steals another driver's woman"" plotline that goes back to 1966's ""Grand Prix"" at least, and has obviously been done to death in other sports films...  Not to mention the bitchy ex-wife, though Gina Gershon is aptly cast in this role.
-Film editing that will make even a frequent viewer of MTV dizzy.  Enough unnecessary cuts to make a music video producer proud.
-The dimwitted relationship between ""the rookie"" and the howlingly overdone part of his agent/manager, which of course in THIS film would be his older brother, as well.  Not only his brother, but the brother that ""the rookie"" beat into submission when they were both amateur racing drivers.  This plot detail alone made me want to drink a gallon of Drano.
*sigh*
I could go on, but we're only allowed a thousand words here.
The only thing that recommends this film is the presence of some good racing footage, but all the good racing footage is REAL footage of the racing, not the manufactured scenes for the purposes of ""plot"" development.  Problem is...  The good racing footage can be seen for free 20 weekends a year on ESPN.  Don't bother paying for this movie...  Though if it's on a movie channel you already happen to be paying for, it is worth watching if only because it will give you a good laugh.",1028419200,10,3641,4.849757673667205

I don't like like racecar driving but I still bought it because it had Sly in it. So it's kinda dissapointing unlike Happy Gilmore (with Adam Sandler) where non-golf fans can like it too.

Most of the problems of this movie are related to the ""music video"" effect, that is music used to compensate for the action of the movie.  Also, they really try to take auto racing and make it some type of melodrama. Some of the lines are laughable.  I think that many auto racing fans will look at this movie and scoff at some of the acting in it. It isn't entirely bad, as there are good action scenes. This was just not a very inspiring movie to me, despite the fact that it seemed to want to be. Stallone could do much better than this.

Too bad the producers and writers of this movie have never seen a CART, IRL or Formula 1 race before. This movie is so insulting to race fans because it is so STUPID!!

1300983,1,B00003CXTL,"The main problem with this in not the story. Its the filming.  Everything is a close-up and the camera angle is constantly changing.  Where Good Fellas and Casino are famous for the Longest continuous camera shots, this one should be equally famous for the shortest.
The camera shifts without reason every fraction of a second.  Everything is a closeup.  When a group of people are talking together.  Split seconds of facial closeups are mixed with facial closeups of the other characters talking.
Actually its worse than that, you get close-ups of eyes, then someones nose, then back to Stallone talking, Stallone at a different angle, at yet another angel, a close-up of finger tapping.
Its like they had 1000 cameras for every scene and used portions of each one for every minute of screentime.
If you can get past how absurdly it is shot, you have absurd situations like a racer getting upset taking off in one of these cars on public city streets and being pursued by another racer.  Also in a race, there is a crash, and the other racer does a 180 degree turn and goes to rescue him.
I could never get past all this to get deep enough into the relationships between the characters so I can't comment about that.

1300984,3,B00003CXTL,"Driven is an interesting film which deals with human emotions and is filled with action to pump up the audiences attention.
This movie captures the story of about 4 race car drivers and the people that are involved with them. Each person is really given the chance to shine in here. Same as the movie, the Soundrack adds pumping adreneline in the action and clarity in the dialogue.
There are many reasons why this film didn't do as well as it did, but surely for this DVD there is something to uphold, though not a great big special editon, the DVD shows more character development through the Deleted Scenes (very interesting) and the Featurette.
I wanted to give this 31/2 stars but 3 was the closest, reason being is that some of the dialogue scenes between the characters seem to missing some type of 'punch' to them. But there are really great talk between the indivuals in the film, that are very sweet and understanding.

1300985,5,B00003CXTL,"For some reason this movie didn't make any sense. Sylvester Stallone who was once the student, but is now the teacher? How is that so? Joe Tanto (Stallone) is a retired racer who has been brought back by his old circuit to teach the next best thing. Jimmy Bly is supposed to be the next best racer and he doesn't approve of Tanto's efforts to help him win. Balogna! That kid doesn't know who he's messing with. Obviously he didn't watch the Rambo trilogy or the Rocky movies. You don't mess with that deity! Tanto ran into some of his old friends and his bitter ex-wife played by Gina Gershon. This movie should have been about Stallone and Gershon. Forget the children. If the two hotshot racers want to fight over the swimming chick, then let them! Revile! I want salvation from the deity, but no, he gets disrespected by two boys. They should know that their personal problems aren't going to help them to win the championship. Back and forth they go and in the second-to-last race they both show their true colors and save a fellow driver from dying. That was estimable of them, but in the final race, Tanto could have taken the championship from both of them. He should have!

Add that to the lousy acting by just about everbody in the film, and you have a bonified loser of a movie. I wish I could give this movie negative stars.
After watching this wonderful piece of garbage DVD, I watched the deleted scenes. It then made perfect sense to me why Stabone was in charge of the screenplay. He deleted any scene dipicting him as he was originally written, as a bad person. Stabone always has to play the hero. What an ego, somebody should call him and let him know that he's no longer ""cool"". Oh wait, was he ever?",1022112000,,762,4.373239436619718
1300987,3,B00003CXTL,"I preface my review by saying that I'm an F1-fan, and of all the acidic criticism this movie has received, far the worst kind came out of the corner of F1 journalists. I also follow CART, and yes: even as a more casual fan I can see that this movie does not accurately portrait the sport in every aspect - but its shouldn't have to, after all: hello, this is fiction! As far as an action-packed race movie goes, this piece is not at all bad! Sly Stallone is subtle where nobody expects him to be and really surprises with the superb portrayal of an aging athlete. The young and confused shooting-star driver is not at all that far away from a young and goofy Jenson Button in his second season in Formula One, and as far as Burt Reynolds goes: yeah, the wheelchair business undoubtly meant to allude to Frank Williams is kinda cheesy, but he is actually OK once you get past his plastic surgery damage.
We own the DVD of this movie, and when you watch the extra footage of the movie that was cut-out, you just want to cry: the extra scenes would have made the movie SO SO SOOOO much better. The storyline, that in the existing version sometimes is sketchy would have obtained quite a bit of meat and depth.
The special effects and the cinematography are really good, absolutely no complaints there, soundtrack is cool, and, oh yes, I forgot: Till Schweiger is also really good as the German ice-man.",1021852800,,1399,4.447470817120623
1300988,4,B00003CXTL,"""Welcome to the Human Race""  This was the clever metaphor used in descibing the movie, and the movie tried to emphasise the good and the bad of human nature, interestingly enough, through the racing world.  I looked forward to the DVD, having missed it in theaters.  There were certain things about Driven that were satisfying; however, it fell short of being an awesome flick for me with a few flaws that could have been corrected.
  The F1 premise was intriguing and promising.  Obviously, you can't expect a movie like Driven to be entirely accurate - it's Hollywood.  Unlike others, I was impressed by Stallone's role.  He plays a convincing supporting character and gives a genuine performance - reminiscent of the Rocky V mentoring w/ Tommy Gunn.  Other great performances included Til Schweiger's German antagonist, Stacy Edwards as the journalist, and Christian de la Fuente as the rival driver who marries Sly's ex.  The racing graphics and effects are also superb!  The Chicago downtown race is definitely funny and memorable.  The diverse soundtrack really adds to many scenes and greatly helps the movie.  The DVD commentary and background info also helps but is more like too little, too late.
  Unfortunately, the holes in the plot and certain dialogues mortally wound this one.  I laughed out loud at some of Bly's lines and his ""transformation"" is trite and unbelievable.  Estella does a par job as 'Sophia', obviously not her full potential.  Sorry but Burt is just a big stinker in this one- part his fault and in part to the gaps in info and background surrounding his character.  Also, some scenes are terribly connected! Kudos to the editor on that :).  I asked myself if I would still like Driven if it didn't have F1 cars and the racing scenes, and the answer was unfortunately no.  The plot is just too bland- something that could have easily been fixed.  Oh well.  OH, and is it just me or does Memo Moreno's last name suddenly change to Heguy in the credits?!?  Just absurd.

Bottomline is, while I have the poster on my wall and DVD on my shelf, the movie isn't for everyone.  If you can take it for what it's worth, Driven is worth the drive but misses the pole position in my list of top action/suspense films.",1021766400,3,2239,4.7357512953367875
1300989,4,B00003CXTL,"I paid to see this movie in a theater about a month after it was in general release, after having read both a good number of the doubtful pre-release reports in the racing press as well as the post-release reviews by legitimate film critics.  In other words, I went in expecting to be disappointed, but afterwards, I left pleasantly surprised and happy.
I'm a racing fan.  I followed CART with strong interest for a long time until last year when I finally got so fed up with watching its ""management"" crash it into the wall over and over again that I eagerly switched to NASCAR.  That said, I still hope new boss Chris Pook can get CART back on track.  I have two points to make from that little bit of autobiography - I know something about racing and its business, and I know ""Driven"" does not convey the reality of either of those two things very well at all.
But it doesn't have to, nor should it.  ""Driven"" is a fictional movie, not a documentary.  Those people who know how exciting real open-wheel racing can be - and who also then know how it often isn't - who yearn for this movie to be only a highlight reel of great moves and passes will be disappointed.  The folks who know and care that burning methanol fuel produces no visible flame will be upset to see visible fuel fires here.  In short - those people looking for racing reality will not like this movie, and apparently a lot of people who reviewed the film on this site, were.
But again - it's a MOVIE, and this one does very well what movies are supposed to do: provide entertainment.  If you go into this movie looking for that you'll find plenty of it.  Enjoy the drama, the suspense, the action, and heck, the T&A - there's a cute blonde for the young guys to ogle, and Stacey Edwards' reporter character for older guys like me to appreciate.  Also, Stallone actually uses some acting range in this picture.  Contrary to some reports, there is a plot and it's actually a pretty good one.  Not contrary to other reports, Burt Reynolds is simply awful in this movie - never before has 10 minutes (at most) of a single actor's screen time been so hilariously bad.
This film could have been a sleeper hit when it was released.  It's too bad then that when the racing fans who saw it didn't get the high degree of reality they wanted, they bad-mouthed it to death.

It was precisely the kind of movie I avoid... loud, flashy, and vapid. I was like, ""What in the hell was Sly thinking?"" Cut to 5 months later: I rented the DVD, but this time, I got to see deleted scenes which fleshed out the characters, and I got to listen to Stallone's commentary, which announced his original intentions. In that context, I watched the movie again. Sly's script is actually pretty good. He was writing it in the mindset of Joe Tanto, writing it as a former mega-celebrity who has to deal with the fact that he's not as hot a commodity as he used to be, and has to make way for the new talent. It's very open and very frank, and just plain great. Unfortunately, this great material fell into the hands of Renny Harlin, a director who isn't known for his dramatic depth, nor his subtlety. Without the extra emphasis on effects, or a director who makes jump cuts like George Miller on crack, ""Driven"" could have been an Oscar contender, instead of the bomb it inevitably became.

I have to place this movie alongside LeMans, Grand Prix, and Winning as one of the best racing movies made.",1009929600,,403,4.714285714285714
1301050,2,B00003CXTL,"Driven is about CART, the open-wheel racing series. I race myself; I'm just a weekend warrior who pulls their own car behind their truck. I have lots of fun, but I don't have a huge budget, like Sylvester Stallone had. So I don't screw-up quite as much as he did.
This movie was surprising in that the story was much better than I had expected. The tale is of three drivers and a couple of owners. One driver is very young and unstable, seemingly challenged more by fitting in with his new surroundings and the expectations placed upon him than by working the car. Sly plays an older driver, a veteran who might be past his prime but is still capable of winning a few races. And there's another driver in the middle--comfortable with racing in the series, but experiencing profound self-doubt in light of a few recent setbacks.
The interaction between the three is what makes the plot. The caracters, on the surface, have balance and could make a great and rich storyline. But there's lots of missing pieces between them, their interaction, and their development.
In the automotive press, particularly in the racing world, the making of this movie received a tremendous amount of ink. That press worked a lot of hype into the movie's most critical audience--race drivers. We read about how Bernie Ecclestone, czar of F1, discontinued a long relationship with Sly after many months of involvement. CART picked up the relationship, but I think that was a mistake.
Racing films are hard to make. It's impossible to concisely capture the passion, precision, and effort put forth by everyone involved in race day. But the blunders in this movie made it nearly unbearable.
That a driver would leave a Champ car during a race and be the first one to assist a wrecked driver, that cars fly 80 feet into the air after a wreck, that raindrops are visible as you drive at 130 miles an hour ... all of the those faults quickly add up to distractions that kept me from enjoying the show. Drivers hum and sing and yell in their cars, but they don't do it with their radio mic key pressed. Drivers don't suddenly decide that they'll go a little harder and pass everyone in sight during the next lap.
Even though it could have been better developed, I was surprised at the strength of the story but I was profoundly disappointed in the visual aspects of the movie. I know that Stallone did lots of work to get footage, including using his relationship with CART to get access to pit row during live races, and offering many popular drivers cameos. But the incredulous footage puts an intolerable tarnish on a decent story.",1009756800,,2606,4.655097613882863

Stallone's character is an over-the-hill race car driver who is called back to his racing team to help groom a talented but inconsistant rookie driver.  The writing is pretty bad and doesn't give the actors much to work with.  It's difficult to imagine that drivers would stop in the middle of a race to help an injured driver, but that's what Stallone would have us believe.

Fortunately, I only rented Driven, and did not buy it or pay to see it in cinema.  Overall, the acting was so bad and the storyline to inept that I barely got halfway through the film before I was too fed up to continue with it.  While actual ABC/ESPN auto racing announcers are featured, they do not call the film's races ANYWHERE close to reality; I realize things for a film are scripted, but the passion simply is not there.

This is also the type of movie that really makes you appreciate those little ""skip"" buttons on your DVD player.  Without them, you would have to endure a lot of boring and unintelligent dialogue between races.
  I'll refrain from commenting about the acting and direction, as it really isn't essential in a movie like this.  The car racing scenes are what this movie is about, and I can definitely say that they are very well done.  This is, without a doubt, a visually impressive movie.

I suppose that Stallone forgot that Indy Cars do not have their own starters, they must be started with an external starter.  Nothing about the racing and wrecking is realistic, despite the fact that Sylvester Stallone was seen at several races in the year prior to this movies release.

The rookie looks like the American Dream and he is easy to admire. This thing isn't very bad, but the heroine also looks like this, she is an Ideal formed by male fantasies. I did not like this. In addition, Japanese people were portrayed prejudicially in this American movie. At one point it has many Japanese people portrayed as short in stature and wearing glasses. This is a stereotype. In the film there is a scene set on a twin link Motegi, and the Japanese in the audience are an old lady and an old man with glasses. I don't want to see such a stereotypical film.

This looks like a Baywatch episode on wheels (at least they have good looking babes on bikinis running around !).
I heard Sylvester tried to do this movie about Formula One but at the end could not get to an agreement with F1 owner Bernie Ecclestone over differences on the plot of the movie and money matters. Then Mr. stallone returned to the States and had to settle for CART.

By saying that, Driven may not have been the finest auto racing movie of all-times, but is a respectable and enjoyable adaptation of the ultimate speed sport. As Champ cars blow by at speeds of near 150 MPH conservatively, Renny Harlin provided excellent camera shots giving a new appreciation of motorsports in the movies, in a fashion that was never seen since Grand Prix or Le Mans.
The movie itself was very creative and enlighting as several actors and actresses including Sylvester Stallone, Kip Pardue and Burt Reynolds displayed great moments of emotions and passion within a Champ Car season. However, a shortfall within the movie was the poor depliction of an actual competition in a Champ car race. This problem was likely because the script didn't completely shake the Formula One racing template orginally planned for Driven.
In summing up, This isn't the best film when considering accuracy to the real Champ car series. However, Driven has great qualities for a smart choice for family viewing.",1004918400,,1124,5.048387096774194

Along the way we're given a tour of the racing world and the relationships of the characters, particularly between Jimmy and his brother (Robert Sean Leonard-in swarm mode).

Point: Exploding race car filled with methanol fuel does not burn yellow like gasoline does. It is colorless, maybe slightly blue.
Point: Burning methanol fuel does not spread over the surface of a pond or lake, it mixes with water and goes out.
Obvious computer generated action sequences and effects only make this film more laughable than it would be. The cast looks like they are straight out of a Japanese animated TV series as well.

The race scenes was like watching a video game on a big screen TV.  Every accident was over the top.  Even funnier were the inconsistencies regarding the cars.  You need a special starter to get the hydraulics started and then you can start the engine.  However, in ""Chicago"" both Kip & Sly were able to start the cars without them when they went racing through the streets.  The plot was not much better and the characters one-demensional.

1301168,4,B00003CXTL,"When I first saw ""Driven"", I thought it seemed sort of incomplete.  Certain characters didn't really fit in with the story, relationships didn't develop into anything.  I enjoyed the racing scenes.  I'm not knowledgeable about the sport, so I can't critique the realism (or lack of).  The racing scenes are exciting and tense, but whenever the characters talk to each other, the scenes seemed to end abruptly.
Renny Harlin has directed some very entertaining movies, one of them was ""Cliffhanger"", which also starred Sylvester Stallone.  He also directed the second ""Die Hard"" movie.  He knows what he's doing when it comes to action flicks.  So does Stallone of course, like him or not- he's starred in and wrote some of the most commercially successful action films ever.  So why wasn't this movie better?
Many other reviewers here have pointed out something that I will have to concur with.  In nearly an hours worth of deleted and extended scenes, we have a chance to see what someone (unwisely) decided was unneccessary to the film.  Scene after scene- not of extra, gratuitous racing footage- but of important drama between the characters.  The story becomes much more fleshed out and the relationships deepen.  No, this probably wouldn't have won any Oscars... But I think it definitely wouldn't have been laughed off the screen by so many critics and viewers.
This DVD really makes good use of the format.  The extra scenes also have Stallone's commentary throughout, which gives us even more information about what this movie was like before someone butchered it.  Renny Harlin has a running commentary over the feature.  There are two documentaries, one is a 15 minute look at the making of the film.  The other doc is better, though fairly short, it is about how the special effects were accomplished.",1002240000,6,1812,4.970099667774086

1301171,3,B00003CXTL,"Movie Summary: Joe Tanto is a retired and washed up Grand Prix champion with a colorful past. He is called back into the racing game by the man who tossed him out years before. Joe is needed to help a young could be champion named Jimmy Bly. Jimmy is on the verge of throwing everything away just like Joe did. Joe has a hard time getting close to Jimmy because of Jimmy's manger brother who restricts all access to Jimmy. Eventually Joe and Jimmy become friends. Joe helps Jimmy find out what he is really made of. In the process Joe finds out what he is made of as well.
My Opinion: This is a mildly entertaining story about auto racing and a men finding themselves. The plot of the feature presentation has some holes. We aren't told what happens to Joe or the Luc the reporter. This plot line is just dropped. The deleted scenes contained on this DVD edition fill out this plot line and a couple of others as well. They are interesting to watch because you get to see the evolution of the film. It was a complete story and the editors cut things out for whatever reasons and made it less than a complete story. The racing scenes are fun and it's hard no to root for Jimmy Bly. The acting isn't that great although Stallone does come off as likeable. Overall, this is a mediocre film with a decent DVD release.
DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen Anamorphic 2.35:1 Very sharp and clear video. Sound: DD5.1  Extras:  There are a lot of extras on this DVD. The biggest one for me was the deleted and extended scenes. Most of them are just extended scenes with not much extra information. The deleted scenes however do as Mr. Stallone says in his commentary. They fill out the story. You get to see plot lines finished and questions answered. Other extras include the trailers, documentaries, and a commentary by the director.  Menus: The menus were ok. Nothing special.
What You Should Do:  Rent this one if you like racing or Sylvester Stallone. It's not one of his best efforts, but it is entertaining. The deleted scenes show how they can cut a story up so that it becomes confusing and unfulfilling. It is also worth a rental for Estella Warren.

1301225,4,B00003CXTL,"This movie, as released, is a feather-weight entertainment.  Light on involving drama, high on digitally-enhanced racing sequences.  Nowhere near the best of Sly Stallone's career, but certainly better than most of the stuff he did in the '90s; like 'Specialist', 'Assassins', 'Judge Dredd'.
On many DVDs, the 'deleted scenes' are often of very little interest-  you can usually tell why they ended up cut.  That is NOT the case with ""Driven"".  The lengthy program of deleted/extended sequences gives us an idea of what Stallone's original script was like.  Character's become fleshed out, plot holes and inconsistencies are rectified.  The DRAMA of the film was clearly sacrificed for MORE ACTION.  Yes, the racing scenes are important to the movie, but this clearly was at one time a more emotionally involving movie.
This deleted scene selection can also be viewed with Stallone's running commentary.  It is very clear from listening to Mr. Stallone discuss these cut scenes that there was a lot of thought put into the script.  After watching this, it is clearly incorrect to place the blame for ""Driven""'s weaknessess on Sly.  The final product is a far cry from his original vision.
It is a shame that the editor was allowed to chop so much vitality out of this movie.  Long ago, Stallone won an Oscar nomination for his screenplay to ""Rocky"".  I wish the movie he actually wrote had made it to theaters.  This is a great example of the DVD format allowing us a glimpse into the filmmaking process.  At least Stallone was able to prove himself capable of thoughtful expression to those who doubted him.
One final thought on the extensive deleted/expanded scene segment...  These scenes are presented in their 'rough form', as Stallone explains.  There is no music or special effects added.  The sound has yet to be properly mixed.  Nevertheless, the real heart and soul of the movie can be found in these 'rough' scenes.  They pack more emotional punch than all the loud music and digital effects of the final product.
Give this film a chance.  Spend some time with the supplemental materials on the DVD.  (There is much more than what I have described).",1001894400,3,2160,4.9088397790055245
1301226,4,B00003CXTL,"Kudos to the customer reviews that confirm what my initial reaction was when I saw the deleted scenes on the DVD.....what were the editors thinking?  The deleted scenes with Stallone's commentary are excellent and confirm what Stallone insisted all along...this is a PEOPLE movie, about the relationships, with car racing as a side note.  The deleted scenes comprise a little over an hour of extra footage and serve to further develop the characters that are in this movie.  And what we find with the added insight into these characters is that ""Driven"" is not a bad movie, as the critics and moviegoers insisted, but a good movie that was poorly edited.  I agree with a fellow reviewer that I found myself angry that Stallone's rather insightful movie with highly developed characters and real life situations and conflicts was hacked to pieces in the box office and condemned to mediocrity, thanks not to bad acting and poor storyline, but because some idiot in Hollywood tried to make this into a car movie and ruined it in the process.
The racing scenes are awesome in this movie and the CG work is flawless.  I have not gotten a chance to watch this part of the DVD yet...saving it for another day.  Sure, it's not totally realistic...in watching NASCAR, cars don't pass at will like they do in this movie, and many of the crash scenes are a bit overdone, but that's not the point.  It's entertaining and fun to watch..that's what movies are supposed to be about...right?
Give this one a chance.  At least go down to your local movie store, rent the DVD, and check out the deleted scenes before you make a decision on this one.  I think you will be pleasantly surprised.",1001808000,,1675,4.689419795221843
1301227,2,B00003CXTL,"Quite possibly the worst movie I have seen this year. It really was that bad. Lacking any character development, I felt no emotion towards any of the characters and considered turning it off half way through. This movie is a piece of garbage.

1301228,4,B00003CXTL,"Rollicking good fun that finds Sylvester Stallone back on top of the action game in this drama about the carnivalesque world of race car driving. Sly also wrote the screenplay for this latest Renny Harlin flick, and as usual his running theme is that of humanity overcoming the need for competitive gain. Though his dialogue needs (and I mean needs) a lot of help, the relationships between characters in the film are much stronger than you would expect. Stallone plays an over-the-hill race car driver who quit years ago when it just got too tough, who finds himself back in the game when he's asked to mentor the new boy in town (Kip Pardue). Pardue has his own troubles, mostly those of trying to beat his racing nemesis (Til Schweiger) and maybe steal the guy's girlfriend (Olympic-medalist swimmer Estella Warren, who in all fairness can act quite measurably). The film really comes alive when Gina Gershon is on the scene; I honestly don't think any film should ever be made without her (watch the part when she wipes up the floor with Stacy Edwards and her mousy little face-it's my favourite!!) Harlin's directorial style steals greatly from the likes of Oliver Stone (particularly his work on Any Given Sunday) but as the film has three hundred percent more heart than that empty-headed football movie, all his thievery is forgiveable.",1001635200,2,1344,4.873362445414847
1301229,1,B00003CXTL,"When one considers that in the last ten years Harlin and Stallone have either directed/acted in such films as Judge Dredd, Daylight, Assassins, Demolition Man, Get Carter, Cutthroat Island, Cliffhanger(cooperatively), and Deep Blue Sea, it's almost surprising this movie isn't worse than it is.  It's bad, for sure, and if all goes well I will never see it again in my life, but I've seen worse.
But the very fact that I've seen worse did nothing to negate the way I felt after watching this film.  And on that note I will attempt to review the film.  Instead of creating an organized, developed review, I will simply cover some points I thought about as I watched the movie.
Although I know little about racing, I do know that you don't have to win every race of the season to be considered an excellent driver.  In the film it seems that every time the rookie Bly fails to finish first in a race it's like he's really blown it for himself.  And I do realize that Reynold's character is obsessed with winning, but seriously, even a second place season finish for a rookie in a major racing league would be a significant accomplishment.  And like I've said already, I don't know much about racing, but I do know that Formula 1 cars have steering wheel mounted gear shifters.  How Formula 1 differs or is related to CART I do not know, but I would be interested to find out.  After all, I would think that a stick shift would provide more of a dramatic effect(probably has something to do with the fallic undertones).
Another thing about the movie that annoyed me was how predictable it was.  I knew from the moment that Sylvestor's character met the reporter ""Luke"" that they would get something going between them...the very instant.  Also, you know that one of the main characters is going to be injured or killed, and through the process of elimination it's not long before one realizes who it's going to be.  Also, even though the racing season is 20 races long, you know that it's all going to come down to the last race, and in all probability, the very last moments of the last race.  The movie doesn't fail in following these classic cleches.
There were also other problems I had with the movie.  The night driving in the race cars through the city streets of ""Chicago"" was a joke, right?  Aside from everything else that was wrong with that segment the one thing I kept thinking about was, ""how can they see to drive with no helmets on"".  I mean, their eyes are going to dry out.  The design of the car is probably going to deflect a certain amount of air away from the cockpit, but at near 200mph speeds, you're probably still going to need some sort of visor protecting your eyes.  Also, I had to chuckle at the mid-race rescue of Memo.  Talk about some seriously contrived bologna.  Not to mention the pragmatic ridiculousness of it all.  And as far as the between race drama goes, you could eliminate all of it and still not lose any emotional affect from the film.  As for the races themselves...Harlin relies on choppy editing and pumped up music to convey excitement.  The computer effects aren't terrible, but there are many instances when you are very, very aware that it's cgi your seeing.
Ultimately, this film substitutes cleches for character development and plot, has dialogue that is only adequate at its best moments, and rarely fulfills in its capacity as an action film.  One thing I will give this film, though, is that it made me laugh out loud pretty hard once...when Stallone's character Tanto makes a flying leap to take first positon.  I would like to say one final thing, in regards to Stallone.  I am simply amazed at how much mileage he's gotten out of his Rocky and Rambo franchises.",1001548800,10,3720,4.5830815709969785
1301230,4,B00003CXTL,"I watched this movie on DVD without a whole lot of expectations when it was first available on DVD.  I was surprised with how exciting this movie is.  Fast cars, beautiful people, F-1 car chase scene, and a few more adrenaline-pumping scene!  As far as the story line and character development, there is nothing much to be said here.  Having said that, I never expect those qualities from a race car movie with Stallone anyhow.  The sound quality is good.  The deleted scenes with Stallone's commentary provides a nice touch.  The actor's profile feature gave me some problem -- not being able to access all actor's bio.  I don't know whether it was caused by my DVD player.  Overall, it is a fun movie to watch with some nice extra features.  It is worth renting.  Buying is up to each individual.",1001462400,2,798,4.588652482269503
1301231,3,B00003CXTL,"I saw this movie both on the theater and when I purchased this DVD.  The following is why you might be interested in this DVD if you skipped the movie after reading the reviews, or saw the movie and were disappointed by it.
My perspective on all this is that CART is arguably the best racing series in the world.  I've been to the races, talked to the drivers, and know a lot about the sport on many levels.  I was excited when I heard this movie was to be made.  On the other side, I was scared that it would become another laughingstock like the racing community feels ""Days of Thunder"" was in terms of realistically depicting the sport.  I also knew I was going to have to accept some ""Hollywood"" because most people don't understand enough about what goes on in CART to appreciate it at ""full realism"" setting.  Thus the need to have cars knife through the competition on any patch of road that's open (the laws of physics be hanged).
The movie was very entertaining to me as a CART fan, and ignoring the cliches, the underdeveloped characters, the sometimes iffy acting, etc.  The special effects were almost always well done, and enough real footage was used to provide the thrill ride you'd want.
My wife's take was ho hum because of the fact that the characters were not developed in spite of Sly's promises that this would be about the PEOPLE in the story as much as the racing.
The DVD confirms that Sly wasn't lying, it's just that the parts that made this a good character movie were left on the cutting room floor.  Through several scenes that were either edited down or omitted entirely, several of the characters' backgrounds were fleshed out, allowing us to empathize with them more, often see better acting.  After I was done watching the DVD and watched these omitted clips, I found myself ANGRY that a good movie was actually SHOT, it just wasn't RELEASED.  If the people behind the movie and DVD version had any brains at all after reading the reviews they got, they would have done like Terminator 2 did and folded the edited/omitted scenes back into the picture, and actually FINISHED the film, knowing the DVD audience wouldn't mind seeing a movie longer than 2 hours.  But since the theatrical release could never compete with T2 because of its flaws, I doubt we'll ever see a 'platinum release' of this DVD with that stuff back in.  But it *IS* worthwhile to see if you want to see how the people in charge of cutting the movie to size can cut out its heart, leaving the special effects to carry the movie, which rarely happens anymore unless it's a Star Wars movie.
The Visual Effects documentary on the DVD is very interesting, in that although I quickly identified some CGI work in the movie, I was amazed at how much got past me.  I swore I was looking at an actual car going around a corner from a camera behind it, and it turns out it was a CG car.  They are just getting too darned good at this stuff!
The video transfer quality was on par with other DVD's, but the sensation of being in the car is definitely hurt by the small screen.  (I have a 36"" set, and of course this is letter boxed).
The audio (no dts here...another screw-up), hits the subwoofer pretty hard, enough that I checked a few times just to be sure that I had the ""bass boost"" turned off.  Some people may need to lower that.  I don't remember the theatrical release having that much bass, so maybe it's a bad mix (With Dolby Digital, anything is possible....).
Anyway, if they could have folded back in the missing footage as a viewing option, the actual movie would be a much better addition to the library, but for many, it will simply serve to answer unanswered character questions and demonstrate how a 4 star movie can get dropped to 1 or 2 stars on the cutting room floor.
I'll keep mine because it's still a CART movie and the Effects are still worth it (and yes, manhole covers DO really get sucked up by the underbody vacuum if not welded down).",1001376000,3,3957,4.450899031811895

I loved the different racing locations such as Toronto, Chicago, Japan, and Detroit. Yet, ""Driven"" puts you (the viewer) into the driver's seat and pushes you way, way past the edge of your seat. Now, as far as the acting should go, ""Driven"" calls the attention to Sylvester Stallone as a retired race car driver that has been called back into action by his long-time friend and crew chief (Burt Reynolds) to help a rookie driver named Jimmy Bly (Kip Pardue from ""Remember The Titans""), who is slipping in the ratings due to the number of races that he lost, thanks to his nemesis, Beau Brandenburg (Til Schweiger), who also has a very, very, very hot girlfriend (Estella Warren). The features on the DVD were extraordinary, like the deleted scenes with Stallone commentary, the behind-the-scenes look at the making of ""Driven"", and the trailer for the film. But all I have to say is that if you liked ""Days of Thunder"" from 11 years ago, then you'll definitely love ""Driven""!",1001376000,5,1123,4.592039800995025

Anybody that thinks this movie portrays realistic racing scenes has obviously never watched a CART or F1 race! When is the last time you saw a driver throw quarters on the track and pick them up with the rear tires while inducing a skid at 200+ mph?

1301275,2,B00003CXTL,"""Driven"" may be the only racing flick in which no one gets killed  just as it would happen in real life. Still, this second Sylvester Stallone-Renny Harlin collaboration is fairly enjoyable on a junk-food-cinema level. The racing sequences are exciting (despite some obvious digital effects) and, surprisingly, Stallone's character takes a back seat to the young leads. However, one wishes Stallone had written a screenplay that wasn't a ""Rocky"" retread  right down to casting Burt Reynolds in the Burgess Meredith role. As a result, ""Driven"" covers the same narrative ground that you've seen in previous Stallone efforts. Though not a bad film, it's easy to see why ""Driven"" crashed and burned with audiences.",1001203200,6,710,5.274336283185841

I've been waiting for another film to be made on the world of auto racing, utilizing the technology we have today to add some incredible special effects into the film. Over a decade has passed since Days of Thunder, so how did they do this time with Indy Cars? Very well. As far as the actual basis for the film's plot, it doesn't draw quite as well as Days of Thunder's did. But the acting by both Kip Pardue and Til Schweiger, and the way the plot was acted out and presented really made the film have an unexpected impact. While neither Sly or Burt could come close to matching Robert Duvall, their performances were respectable and didn't lack much. The special effects, while a little much at times in terms of reality, were still awesome and presented very well. The filming techniques such as slo-mo and POV shots were used perfectly, and in extremely good form. As far as the DVD is concerned, the Picture and Sound quality are exceptional and the Extra's are all there, from director commentary to deleted scenes with Sly's commentary. Impressive enough to get me to go out and buy the DVD after renting it, so it's certainly worth a viewing.

  If you can go in with an open mind then you may find it a fun film, it deals more with the relationships than with racing in many ways. Sly is quite good and was enjoyable to watch.

However, this movie, while some of the scenes are very well done (driving in Champ Cars through Downtown Chicago), but the story is lacking. Movie is very comparablable to Days of Thunder where you have old crew chief helping young driver. Here you have old driver helping young driver. Days of Thunder definately had a little more story and better racing scenes as they travelled to Dover, Rockingham, Darlington and Daytona amoung other places. Most of the footage for Driven was shot in and around Chicago. Look at most of the starter's stand and see it's the same thing, just different signage. Most racing action was filmed at Chicago Motor Speedway in Cicero. Also Days of Thunder have hatred turn to friendship, Driven does, but not as strongly.

1301337,3,B00003CXTL,"Driven is a conundrum. It starts out as a movie with little action, it's slow as it gets going. Stallone tries hard in his writing of the screenplay to establish characters that are familiar with each other, have past history together, and in some cases, have conflicts. This is good. But it gets tedious and his talent as a writer seems to have severly waned since his efforts on Rocky. Then the movie moves into a more racing action orientation, this is good too, but the character development is kind of left behind. Director Renny Harlin is notorious for sacrificing character subject matter in favor of action scenes. As expected, the racing scenes in this movie are energetic and powerful at most times, but they feel fake in some ways. The computer enhanced bullet speed, Matrix-like, crash scenes are very impressive, making you catch every angle of the disaster, a true rubber neckers dream. If you pick apart this movie you can find flaw after flaw. But watching it from beginning to end without any kind of judgment can be hard. Some of the flaws stand out so much it's impossible not to notice. But at the end you do get the feeling you were entertained for the most part. A better movie like this would be Days of Thunder, although not a great movie either. True racing fans will either love Driven or hate it. The traveling scenarios that these racers take up as they move from country to country, racing in one competition after another shows how grueling these racing tours can be on the drivers and the people that do it with them. I give this movie three stars because I believe it had great potential to be better. Unfortunately, I would only recommend buying this movie if you are a true racing fan of the CART series.

I thought the movie was for the most part realistic, and I have always been somewhat intriguied by the lifestyles of F-1 and CART race car drivers. I thought the end of the last race was the only really unrealistic part in the racing sequences. I think the drama beyond the racing parts was good, even though younger kids might be bored by it because it was pretty much just about the relationship between the girl and the two drivers fighting for the championship.

I'm sure that ""Driven"" was not very realistic to those that follow the sport, and that is ironically one of the movie's best features.  As someone who is not a fan or follower of CART or any other automotive racing, I was still captivated by the action and intensity of what drivers go through.  Stallone defintely instilled in me a new respect for these men that I am now comfortable referring to as athletes.  As a movie itself, ""Driven"" certainly does not have the most original script I've come across, but it does embody the principles that have made me a loyal follower of Mr. Stallone: heart, dedication, faith, and good will.  Sly knows how to create and portray a real man who makes himself better by searching himself for his potential, and ""Driven,"" if nothing else, was an inspiration to watch.

Needless to say my optimism was not restored when viewing the final product (free, thank God), which had somehow mutated into a melodramatic, contrived, and unintentionally funny action (?) movie grafted onto something vaguely resembling the CART circuit. ""Driven"" is of value purely for the accidental laughs it incites, featuring announcers who seem to be less than familiar with their jobs or the typical spectator's intelligence (""One of the keys of winning these races is knowing when to make a pit stop..."") and a wheelchair-bound Burt Reynolds, sporting about four inches of makeup on his face. Not only that, but we are also subjected to very little raw racing footage and more of the same badly done CGI that makes about half the film resemble a Playstation game, right down to the false tension and generic aggro-rawk blasted loudly in the background.

Sly plays Joe Tanto, a Washed-up Formula One racer who is brought back by his friend Carl Henry (Burt Reynolds) to Befriend and Help out his Troubled Hotshot Driver Jimmy Blu (Kip Pardue), who is Talented, Fast and Professional, but he's also Reckless, Young and in a bit of a Slump. He has lost the Love of racing because of all the Pressure that is on him to Win. His Manager Brother (Robert Sean Leonard) and his On-Off Girlfriend (Estella Warren) don't help his Stress Factor. Sly believes if Jimmy pulls together Off the track, he'll come together On it, so Sly has to Earn Jimmy's Trust and remind him why he began racing in the First place, for the Love of the Race. Yep, that about Sum's it all Up.
The Best Scenes include a Wild Joyride involving Two Prototype Formula One Cars and Downtown Chicago, a Car Flying through the air in Super Slow Motion, and of course, the Final Race. While a lot of the film concentrates on the Behind the Scenes stuff Formula One fans don't See, (like Handling the Pressure, how Easy it is for your Racing Career to Slip away, Relationships) Race fans are Still Treated to some of the Best Formula One Racing Ever captured on Camera, the Crashes, the Casualties, the Fear, the Sound... My god, the Sound.
The Sound is actually the most Memorable part of the film, both the Sound Effects and the Soundtrack are Mind-blowing. Renny Harlin Obviously knows how to use Music, and Every Race has a Different song that suits the Mood, even some of the Dialogue fits the scenes. (eg. Filter's ""The Best Things"" in the Chase through the Streets of Chicago scene)
Overall, ""Driven"" is a film for Fans of Speed. Critics have attacked it's Rapid fire Editing and Lack of Development, but to Please the Masses, sometimes luxuries like Story, Dialogue and Development have to take a Backseat to Flashiness, Style and Sound. ""Driven"" is such a film, and I Loved it.",990662400,3,2232,4.624685138539043
1301387,4,B00003CXTL,"""Driven"" is one of those movies particularly designed with the sports fan in mind, especially those who are into the automobile circuit. Sylvester Stallone, although not quite in top form here, gives an above average performance as a has been, apparantly washed-up racer, who ends up coaching and mentoring an up and coming young star racer. Burt Reynolds also gives a fine performance as an injured former racer, who at first has a hard time coming to terms with Stallone's attempted comeback onto the racing circuit, but agrees to be an advisor of sorts to Sly's character. This movie provides many action-packed, fast paced scenes throughout various parts. So, before you plan on watching this semi-intense motion picture, it's always nice to have a large bucket of popcorn, an ice cold soda and some candy nearby. So, from a sports fan's point of view, I recommend you go and see this movie, because you may want to add the video or DVD to your library, which would be nice for any racing and/or generalized sports fan to have in their collection.",990576000,4,1051,4.8121546961325965
1301388,5,B00003CXTL,I don't care what the critics say this movie was awesome. I couldn't get enough of this movie i loved it. Im gonna go see it again thats how good it was. People are saying there is no story well are they blind because the story is plain and clear. All and all this movie was amazing and should be considered onew of the best films of this year so far.,990576000,,351,3.9577464788732395
1301389,3,B00003CXTL,"you might like this one.  This movie is loaded with enough racing scenes to satisfy most racing fans.  The plot though it's not important deals with Stallone who is retired.  He comes back because Burt Reynolds wants him to work with a new driver played by Kip Pardue.  Kip is confused and he is starting to do badly in his races.  His brother who manages him is pulling him in an opposite direction that he wants to go.  He wants to beat Til Schweiger in a race.  Kip ends up falling for Til's estranged girlfriend played by Estella Warren.  Estella is cute in her first screen role.  There's even a scene where she's in a pool and uses techniques she learned while being on the Canadian Swim Team (from real life).  Stallone ends up taking the place of Kip's driving partner who is now married to his bitter ex-wife played by Gina Gershon.  Got that?  No problem if you don't.  The first half an hour, I had no clue what was going on plot wise.  But soon, it all fits together even if I was able to predict plot turns a mile ahead.  Don't go expecting Shakespeare or you'll be disappointed.  Just grab some popcorn, sit back, enjoy the show and you'll have a good time.",990403200,6,1171,4.351851851851852
