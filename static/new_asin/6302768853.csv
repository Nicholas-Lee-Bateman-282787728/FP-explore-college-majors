7830699,4,6302768853,"This brief documentary skillfully walks the line between making fun of
and empathizing with 3 Las Vegas performers who impersonate,
respectively, Elvis, Marilyn Monroe and Judy Garland as part of a
kitschy show called 'Legends in Concert"".

These three individuals are very different in temperament, how
seriously they take the gig and what they want out of it.

At the center of it all is Johnny Stuart, the fellow who created the
show and who takes himself and his creation very seriously - while
bouncing around as if he were on uppers,

The film balances laughter at the absurdity of it all - including fans
who act like these are the real people (even if they have to be
'coached' by Johnny to scream more), and sadness at what a strange,
hermetically sealed world these people have lost themselves in.",1349654400,,807,4.75
