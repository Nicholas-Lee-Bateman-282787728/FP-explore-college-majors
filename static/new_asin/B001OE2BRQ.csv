8330555,1,B001OE2BRQ,"A terrible quality bootleg. I am not exaggerating when I say it is *literally* unwatchable.
I have since bought an old VHS that has fine picture quality, so these people have no excuse for selling this garbage. They should be put in the stockade and made to watch this until they develop cataracts.",1423267200,,298,4.6415094339622645

8330557,4,B001OE2BRQ,"I mentioned in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Allure-of-Nymphets/dp/B00B6KKY1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Allure of Nymphets</a>&nbsp;that teenage boys/young men and middle-aged women are generally opposed to age-discrepant relationships. The main reason being the competition factor:

I'll add here that, in general, the only middle-aged males that you'll find that are opposed to age-discrepant relationships are those that haven't had the privilege of being propositioned by a nymphet.

In Baby Love, which is based on the novel by Tina Chad Christian, Luci (Linda Hayden), a 15-year-old nymphet and teleiophile, seduces the mother and attempts to seduce the father of her adoptive family after her mother commits suicide. However, Luci  repeatedly rejects the advances of, Nick, the teenage son of the family.

""You stupid little boy...grow up!"" Luci demanded.
""You like old men like my father."" Nick conceded reluctantly.

Linda Hayden was 15-years-old when Baby Love was filmed and was nude in multiple scenes; however, they were non-sexual scenes and thus ""permissible"" despite her age.",1378252800,,1145,6.314102564102564
8330558,1,B001OE2BRQ,"This has to be the worst quality DVD I have ever seen. It is literally unwatchable. The colour has drained all but completely. The picture is distorted and broken up. Imagine a photo file on your computer that has become corrupted - that is what this DVD is like.

Describing it as 'remastered' is a joke. I find it incomprehensible that a company has the nerve to sell this as a 'product', and that such a high price is being charged for it, too.

If you buy this DVD you will find yourself throwing into the trash bin after a few minutes of play in your DVD player.

My advice would be to find an old VHS copy. The sound of an old VHS may be a bit dodgy, and the picture not sharp, but I promise you that the quality will be infinitely better than this company's DVD version.

The film itself (I have a VHS copy) is very good, and worth seeking out - fans of Linda Hayden won't be disappointed.",1295136000,,896,4.161849710982659
8330559,1,B001OE2BRQ,"Like the other reviewers, I thought the transfer could not be as bad as they claimed. Also, like the other reviewers, I was unpleasantly surprised.  This ""remastered edition"" is actually worse than a third (possibly fourth)generation bootleg copy I got from eBay.  I even suspect that ""edition"" was the source for this one.  The good news is one can usually distinguish the really beautiful young Linda Hayden from the other actors in most of the scenes.  There is no other good news.  The sad news is this video company was actually silly enough to advertise other movies of similar video quality. The only sharp screen in this product is the menu, and it doesn't offer much or work properly.",1265328000,,693,4.7899159663865545
8330560,1,B001OE2BRQ,"I do not normally take the time to write reviews about purchased products, but in this case I made an exception to warn others who may be contemplating acquiring the DVd copy from this source. As I knew the film from way back via rare screenings on British TV, I was aware of the storyline, setting etc. It had been a long time since viewings, and I must say the film as it stands has not lost it's earthy subject matter and portrayal. I also read a comment before purchasing from another afficiando that warned of the DVD quality being worse than his VHS copy. How bad could it be I asked, and proceeded to ignore it - to my peril. The film quality was so bad that in places it was hard to make out characters and detail due to bleaching. It appeared to be a product of recursive copying from an extremely low quality VHS (original?).
If you remember this film from it's inception, do NOT spoil the recollection by purchasing this DVD from this source, you will be sorry!",1252454400,5,972,4.346153846153846
8330561,2,B001OE2BRQ,"""Baby Love"" is a 1968 film showing how 15-year old orphaned foster child Luci Thompson (Linda Hayden) is taken in by the Quayle family in London and uses her libido to destabilize them all.  Dr. Robert Quayle (Keith Barron), his wealthy wife Amy (Ann Lynn), and their handsome son Nick (Derek Lamden) do eventually figure Luci out.  Luci and Nick have the only material skin scenes.  It's a solid, controversial, 3-star movie.

I own an old VHS tape of the film.  When this ""remastered"" DVD was offered at a reasonable price, I bought it, intending to upgrade.  The surprise was that the picture quality of this DVD was of the same order as the VHS, maybe even a bit worse.  The special features were ways of advertising films offered by [...], but even some the graphics supporting those clips were rather indistinct.  I mark the DVD down one star for the lack of sharpness and clarity of the picture.",1243468800,8,902,4.628930817610063
